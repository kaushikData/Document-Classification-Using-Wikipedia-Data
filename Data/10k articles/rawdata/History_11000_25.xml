|quote= New Anarchism is a term that Andrej Grubacic uses to describe the most recent reinvention of the anarchist thought and practice. What distinguishes the new anarchism of today from the new anarchism of the '60s and '70s, or from the work of US-UK based authors like Murray Bookchin, Paul Goodman, Herbert Read, Colin Ward and Alex Comfort, is its pronounced global perspective. Some of the useful essays on new anarchism include David Graeber's "New Anarchists" in ''A Movement of Movements: is Another World Really possible?'', ed. Tom Mertes (London: Verso, 2004); Andrej Grubacic, "Towards Another Anarchism" in ''World Social Forum: Challenging Empires, ed. Jai Sen and Peter Waterman (Montreal: Black Rose Books, 2007). A good introductory essay by David Graeber and Andrej Grubacic, "Anarchism or the Revolutionary Movement of the 21st Century," is available on line at http://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/9258. see also Leonard Williams, "The New Anarchists," paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Political Science Association, Philadelphia, PA, August 31, 2006, online, pdf, 2008-05-07 http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p152623_index.html.

==Academic career==

Following the collapse of [[Yugoslavia]], Grubačić left for the United States. He moved to Binghamton University where he participated in research working groups at the [[Fernand Braudel Center]] on anarchist implications of [[world-systems analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.readysteadybook.com/Article.aspx?page=davidgraeber&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008 he moved to San Francisco and worked in the sociology department at the University of San Francisco and urban studies department at the San Francisco Art Institute. He is now a Professor and Department Chair of Anthropology and Social Change Anthropology at the California Institute of Integral Studies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ciis.edu/Academics/Graduate_Programs/Anthropology_and_Social_Change.html&lt;/ref&gt; His interest in world systems analysis and anarchist anthropology has influenced his research perspective, which includes experiences of self-organization, voluntary association, and mutual aid on the world-scale. His ongoing research on exilic spaces in the modern capitalist world system considers how spatial expressions of concentrated mutual aid are produced and reproduced on the outside/inside of capitalist civilization. Exilic spaces and practices refer to liminal and non-state areas relatively autonomous from capitalist valorization and state control.  His principal research focus is on the autonomous "cracks" peopled by Don Cossacks, Atlantic pirates, Macedonian Roma, Jamaican Maroons and Mexican Zapatistas. This research is included in his UC Press book ''[http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520287303 Living at the Edges of Capitalism]''. Co-authored with Denis O'Hearn, the book is a winner of the 2017 American Sociological Association PEWS prize for Distinguished Scholarship. His other research interests include the history of the Balkans, militant research, and activist ethnography &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ciis.edu/Academics/Graduate_Programs/Anthropology_and_Social_Change/Anthropology_and_Social_Change_Faculty/Andrej_Grubacic.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
In 2006, Grubacic teamed up with activist and historian [[Staughton Lynd]] to write the book ''[https://secure.pmpress.org/index.php?l=product_detail&amp;p=56 Wobblies and Zapatistas]''

He went on to edit ''The Staughton Lynd Reader'', and offer a new programmatic proposal for the "libertarian socialism for the 21st century," inspired by Lynd's work.

His most recent academic book is ''Living at the Edges of Capitalism'', co-authored with Denis O'Hearn and winner of the 2017 American Sociological Association Political Economy of the World-System (PEWS) Book Award.

His other works include books in Balkan languages, chapters and numerous articles related to the history and utopian present of the Balkans, anarchism, and radical sociology. Grubačić worked with David Graeber to develop an anarchist version of world-systems analysis.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.antropologi.info/blog/anthropology/2007/get_out_of_the_library_and_into_the_stre&lt;/ref&gt;

Grubacic is a Professor and Department Chair at CIIS [[California Institute of Integral Studies]]. Grubačić also works as a guest host of the [[KPFA]] radio program [[Against the Grain (radio program)|''Against the Grain'']].

===Reviews of ''Wobblies and Zapatistas''===

{{quote|
''Wobblies and Zapatistas'' recounts a radical history and connects activist political movements and generations.

Global capitalism has suffered a major blow in the past year, the largest economic turmoil since the 1930s fuelling political discussions on possible alternatives to the current economic model. For those seeking alternatives to mainstream historical narratives, ''Wobblies and Zapatistas: Conversations on Anarchism, Marxism and Radical History'' is an important read. Spanning from the [[Cold War]] to the 1990s expansion of market-driven free-trade policies, this engaging book offers critical historical reflections on events that have shaped contemporary politics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hour.ca/books/books.aspx?iIDArticle=18578
&lt;/ref&gt;}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[World Social Forum]], in its near decade of existence, has popularized the slogan "Another World Is Possible." Although many on the left may agree, and there is broad agreement about the nature of the world we live in and the shape of the one we wish to create, there is less agreement on how to create that new world. ''Wobblies and Zapatistas'', a conversation of sorts between longtime anarchist activist Grubacic and [[Staughton Lynd]], who for the last 40 years has been one of the iconic figures of the U.S. left, is a contribution to resolving that argument—or at least turning it into a productive discussion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pmpress.org/content/article.php?story=WobsNACLA&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;More theoretical and frankly meandering is ''Wobblies and Zapatistas,''...&amp;nbsp;The conversation starts out with the Chiapas rebellion and the Industrial Workers of the World—"the Zapatistas of yesteryear," in Lynd’s phrase—but makes brief stops with the community organizing efforts of former steelworkers in post-industrial Youngstown, the [[1946 general strike in Oakland]], the Vietnam-era [[antiwar movement]], and the 1980s [[revolutionary upsurges of Central America]]. Lynd ties it all together with his concept of "accompaniment"—basically, throwing one’s lot in with oppressed, sharing the burdens and risks of their struggles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warresisters.org/node/884 "Mexico Unconquered and Wobblies and Zapatistas", ''War Resisters League'', Bill Weinberg, 2009-11-02]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This volume brings together two radical intellectuals from alternative political traditions for an extended conversation about theory, activism, and the state of radical politics today. Throughout their conversation, Staughton Lynd, the civil rights organizer, antiwar activist, lawyer, and radical historian, responds to the probing questions of Andrej Grubacic, the radical sociologist and activist from the Balkans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isreview.org/issues/67/rev-wobblies.shtml "Debating how to change the world", ''International Socialist Review'', Issue 67, September–October 2009, ERIC KERL]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Reviews of ''Don't Mourn, Balkanize!''===
&lt;blockquote&gt;This is a splendid time for the North American reader to meet the extraordinary Andrej Grubacic. After something of a letdown following the Seattle 1999 events– including what many of us perceived as an ideology-driven sectarian turn–anarchists are back in the news with the Occupations. No, not the anarchism of Bakunin or even Bookchin, but anarchism in a new key as well as a new generation, more practical and more open.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.counterpunch.org/2011/11/25/dont-mourn-balkanize/ "Andrej Grubacic on Yugoslavia", Paul Buhle 2011-11-25]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;When this writer worked in Kosovo, attempts to interview people from the small community of Serbs that remained there after the European Union took over the city almost invariably failed...Mr. Grubačić also proposes what he calls a "balkanization from below, a pluricultural concept in which, however, rejects that of the European Union." In this idea, Balkan people need to "find the strength and orientation for a new politics for another Balkans. It should be a politics of a Balkan Federation. A participatory society, built from the bottom up, through struggles for the creation of an inclusive democratic awareness, participatory social experiments, and an emancipatory practice that would win the political imagination of all people in the region." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyjournalofbooks.com/review/don%E2%80%99t-mourn-balkanize-essays-after-yugoslavia/ "Don’t Mourn, Balkanize!: Essays after Yugoslavia", Andrew Rosenbaum 2011-11-15]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Andrej Grubačić is probably the most radical writer to approach the Balkans. He does so from an anarchist perspective, and his ideas are informed by both his background and his politics.  Although he is from Belgrade, which is now the capital of Serbia, he continues to think of himself as Yugoslav, despite the fact that Yugoslavia no longer exists as a country. This paradox of identity illustrates the difficulties that the changing political landscape of the Balkans have caused for people from the region.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Don't Mourn, Balkanize! is divided into two main sections—on balkanization from above and balkanization from below—both chronologically organized and both revolving around the same themes: the politics of exclusion, intervention, and resistance, within and beyond the Balkans, but especially in Serbia, Bosnia, and Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2011/ "After Yugoslavia: Alternative Balkanization from Below", Irina Ceric 2011-04-19 ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Arndt Verlag''' is a German publishing house that belongs to the publishing group of the extremist publisher {{illm|Dietmar Munier|de|Dietmar Munier}}. It specialises in historical revisionist literature. Arndt's authors include revisionist historians and extremist authors, such as [[David Irving]], [[Wilfred von Oven]], [[Franz Kurowski]] and [[Franz W. Seidler]].

==History and reception==
Arndt Verlag was founded in 1963 by Heinz von Arndt, who was a member of the neo-Nazi [[Deutsche Reichspartei]] and later of the [[National Democratic Party of Germany|NPD]]. In 1983, the publisher {{illm|Dietmar Munier|de|Dietmar Munier}} took over the publishing house and integrated it into his publishing company. Munier built Arndt into one of the largest and most important right-wing publishing houses in Germany.&lt;ref name="NuM"&gt;{{cite web|title=Arndt-Verlag|trans-title=|periodical=Glossar der Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung im Dossier Rechtsextremismus 2010|publisher=BIKnetz|url=https://www.biknetz.de/glossar/glossary-detail/arndt-verlag.html?type=0|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2014-10-22|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=Nadja Münch und Gabriele Nandlinger|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[State Office for the Protection of the Constitution]] of [[Schleswig-Holstein]], Arndt Verlag is trying to "give readers a positive picture of the national-socialist terror".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Verfassungschutzbericht 2007 des Landes Schleswig-Holstein, S. 56ff.|trans-title=|periodical=|publisher=|url=http://www.schleswig-holstein.de/IM/DE/InnereSicherheit/Verfassungsschutz/Downloads/Verfassungsschutzbericht_2007__blob=publicationFile.pdf|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2014-10-22|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=Innenministerium des Landes Schleswig-Holstein|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution]] mentions the publishing house in its reports for 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verfassungsschutz.de/de/download-manager/_vsbericht-2009.pdf Verfassungsschutzbericht 2009], S. 136 ff., [http://www.verfassungsschutz.de/de/download-manager/_vsbericht-2010.pdf Verfassungsschutzbericht 2010], p. 114, [http://www.verfassungsschutz.de/de/download-manager/_vsbericht-2011.pdf Verfassungsschutzbericht 2011], pp. 115, 117; [http://www.verfassungsschutz.de/de/download-manager/_vsbericht-2012.pdf Verfassungsschutzbericht 2012], p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; Its illustrated books "gloss over the Nazi period" and glorify the military techniques of the "Third Reich". Arndt's publications advance a German claim over the [[Sudetenland]].&lt;ref&gt;Bundesverfassungsschutz: Verfassungsschutzbericht 2012, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main Provisions==

National teams of different countries compete at “Battle of the Nations”. Under the rules of BN, a national team has to consist of at least 8 and a maximum of 50 fighters. Any representative of any of the HMB clubs {{clarify|date=December 2016}}, as well as an individual fighter, provided he has gone through a selection process conventional for a country, can become a member of a national team.

Qualifying tournaments are competitions, where battles are held in accordance with the unified international rules for the historical medieval battle. National teams organize qualifying tournaments to find the best HMB fighters of a country. The unified international rules, according to which battles are held, have been written especially for "Battle of the Nations”. Before the unified rules were written, the countries had different HMB rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.battleofthenations.ua|title=Battle of the Nations - World Championship in Historical Medieval Battle 2017|website=www.battleofthenations.ua}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition for this combat/competition has largely come from Russia, where enthusiasts have held previous events where full contact "battles" of large numbers of armoured combatants, are held, often in historical sites. The emphasis is put on the combatants wearing historically accurate equipment and heraldry, and the use of appropriate weapons for the combat.

The [[heraldry]], however, reflects the modern competition teams, rather than necessarily historically correct [[heraldic]] device that may have been worn by combatants in the medieval period. The first tournament was held at the [[Khotyn Fortress]] in [[Ukraine]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;"Second International Festival on Historical Reenactment - World HMB Championship "Battle of the Nations" - Welcomes Guests and Participants" 19:11, ''UN-Ukrainian News'' Monday, April 18, 201&lt;/ref&gt; The combatants depict armoured fighters from the 12th - 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lepage, Bernard.

Over 200 armoured men at arms take place in the competition, and in addition to melee/hand-to-hand weapons, archery is also featured.&lt;ref&gt;"Second International Festival on Historical Reenactment - World HMB Championship "Battle of the Nations" - Welcomes Guests and Participants"  ''UN Ukrainian News'' 19:11, Monday, April 18, 201&lt;/ref&gt;

Team Quebec (also known at Ost du Quebec&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ostduquebec.com&lt;/ref&gt;) was the first non-European team to enter the tournament in Ukraine in 2011. Their captain put a team together of 9 fighters and 3 support staff who traveled from [[Montreal]] Quebec to take part in the tournament. They also held the first friendly tournament under the HMB rules in [[Saint-Eustache, Quebec|St-Eustache]] in February 2012 where participants from Ontario and USA took part. Together with Scallagrims group from Toronto they founded the National Medieval Martial Arts League in Canada.

US combatants entered a team for the first time in 2012, with a number of their members coming from the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]].&lt;ref&gt;Browning, Tamara, "Area men to compete in Battle of the Nations in Poland" ''The State Journal-Register'', 4:44, 2 April 2012 http://www.sj-r.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The US team is a cross-group association of historic martial arts organizations.

"Battle of the Nations 2012" gathered participants from 12 countries.

By the following year, that number increased to 22 teams which participated in the "Battle of the Nations 2013", which was held in [[Aigues-Mortes]] in southern [[France]]. This was the first time the event was held outside east Europe.

==History==
The first meeting for the organization of the festival and the championship was held in Kharkiv in 2009.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Its participants, captains of the first national teams, came to a consensus concerning how to hold the event. Since the rules could vary in different countries and even in different regions of one country, they also agreed of a set of unified international rules for the conduct of battles.

The first "Battle of the Nations" event was held in 2010 in Khotyn (Ukraine).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.buzzfeed.com/timchester/inside-the-violent-geeky-world-of-hardcore-international-med "Inside The Violent, Geeky World Of Hardcore International Medieval Combat"], Mar 1, 2014, Tim Chester, Buzzfeed.com&lt;/ref&gt; It was attended by the national teams of four countries: Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland. Russia won most of the first places. The program included three categories: a duel (1 vs 1), group battles (5 vs 5) and mass battles (21 vs 21). For those who were not members of the national teams, but came to support the comrades, there were non-security buhurts.

The second event, in 2011, was also held at the Khotyn Fortress. seven  national teams participated; the previous four and three novice teams: Italy, Germany, Quebec. Two more categories were added to the three classic ones, namely the “professional fight” and “all vs all”. The latter category allows  participants who are not members of the national teams to fight for their countries. The first places were won by Russia. The festival was attended by about 30,000 spectators and a documentary about the life of the participants was shot.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

The 2012 event was held in Warsaw, Poland, and included representatives of twelve countries. A feature of the festival were battles of mounted knights, that were included in the program of the traditionally foot world championship in HMB for the first time. The top four teams were Russia, Ukraine, Poland, and USA.

The 2013 event was held in [[Aigues-Mortes]], France. Twenty-two teams from Europe, the Americas, and the Pacific Rim took part. With the increase of teams, there were no "pro rules" fights or mounted jousting in the main arena. The top four teams were Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and USA.

The 2014 event was the fifth event, and was held in Trogir, Croatia.  Around 30 countries were expected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://time.com/3838579/battle-of-the-nations-documentary/ "Watch Fighters Literally Go Medieval on Each Other in This New Documentary"], Victor Luckerson, April 28, 2015, Time.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 event was the sixth event, and was held held in Prague.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

The 2016 even was the seventh event, and was held in Prague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://botn.info/news/en-battle-of-the-nations-2016-location-has-been-announced|title=Battle of the Nations 2016 location has been announced! - Battle of the Nations|website=botn.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; 35 countries were expected.&lt;ref name="botn.info"/&gt;

The 2017 event was the eighth event, and was held in Barcelona, Spain and was the first year that the Chinese, Brazilian and Turkish team joined Battle of the Nations. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://botn.info/publication/en-china-will-take-part-in-battle-of-the-nations-2017|title=China will take part in "Battle of the Nations"-2017 - Battle of the Nations|website=botn.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2018 event was the ninth even, and was held in Rome, Italy

The 2019 even will be the 10th event, and is expected to be held in Serbia.

==Valid battle categories==

Valid battle categories of the competitions held among national teams on the HMB and a brief explanation of them:

* '''"Duel Sword and Shield"''', fights 1 vs 1; Sword and Shield with an [[arming sword]] and a shield. The round lasts 90 seconds, with an optional 30 seconds added in case of a draw. The fighter to score the most points by striking the opponent with the sharp edge of the sword, wins the duel. The duellists that place 1st, 2nd or 3rd in this category, are invited to take part in the Triathlon Duel category.
* '''"Duel Sword and Buckler"''', fights 1 vs 1; Sword and Buckler with an [[arming sword]] and a buckler (a small shield, of maximum 35cm in diameter). The round lasts up to 60 seconds or five points. The first duellist to win two rounds, wins the duel. The duellists that place 1st, 2nd or 3rd in this category, are invited to take part in the Triathlon Duel category.
* '''"Duel Longsword"''', fights 1 vs 1; Longsword with a two-handed sword. The round lasts 90 seconds, with an optional 30 seconds added in case of a draw. The fighter to score the most points by striking the opponent with the sharp edge of the sword, wins the duel. The duellists that place 1st, 2nd or 3rd in this category, are invited to take part in the Triathlon Duel category.
* '''"Duel Poleaxe"''', fights 1 vs 1, using a poleaxe, halberd, bardiche or similar pole-mounted weapon. The round lasts 90 seconds, with an optional 30 seconds added in case of a draw. The fighter to score the most points by striking the opponent with the sharp edge of the sword, wins the duel.
* '''"Triathlon Duel"''', fights 1 vs 1. The category consists of three rounds with the use of different weapons. The first round lasts one and a half minutes, [[longsword]]s are used, the second round is held with the use of usual swords and [[buckler]] shields, three bouts up to three hits, and the third round lasts a minute and a half with the use of the standard [[shield]] and [[sword]]. Points are awarded for effective (a clear, stout) blow delivered with the weapon edge to the allowed zone. Since 2017, the Triathlon duel category is offered only to the medalists of the three duel categories that make up the triathlon; Sword and shield, Sword and buckler, Longsword.
* '''"Professional fight"''', fights 1 vs 1. The category consists of three rounds of three minutes each, pre-selected weapons are used. Points are awarded for effective (a clear, stout) blow delivered with a sword, shield edge, fist, leg, knee, and a good throw with the final blow. 
* '''"Five vs five"''' the group battles '''"5 vs 5"''' are the most active kind of buhurt combat. A team fights against a team on a hard bordered list field. One five-member unit includes from five to eight fighters (five fighting in the lists, and three reserve fighters). A fighter who falls down (touches the ground with the third point of support) is out of the battle. There are 3 bouts in a battle until a team wins twice.
* '''“Thirty vs thirty”''', a mass battle '''"30 vs 30"''', when up to thirty fighters representing a country fight on the field at the same time. A fighter who falls down is out of battle. A battle continues until the fighters of only one team remain standing on the lists, so their team wins. This category allows alliances between countries for the formation of teams.
* '''“Twelve vs twelve”''', a mass battle '''"12 vs 12"''', when up to twelve fighters representing a country fight on the field at the same time. There are nine reserve fighters. A fighter who falls down is out of battle. A battle continues until the fighters of only one team remain standing on the lists, so their team wins.
* '''"All vs all"''' are the largest mass battles. All fighters (including those not included in a national team) of all participating countries come to the lists. The participants are divided into equal groups, but in such a way that the representatives of one country are in the same group. A fighter is out of battle if he falls down. Since the win can not be accredited to one nation, no points are awarded. In 2019, this category will be offered as a women's category only. 


For the 10th aniversary in 2019, the [[HMBIA]] announced the 150 vs 150 category, a unique mass-battle event where alliances of teams from the 30vs30 category fight in the largest mass battle category ever offered. 


Old categories: 
* '''“Royal category”''', a mass battle '''"21 vs 21"''', when up to twenty-one fighters representing a country fight on the field at the same time. There are six reserve fighters. A fighter who falls down is out of battle. A battle continues until the fighters of only one team remain standing on the lists, so their team wins. This category was last offered in 2018. At the 2018 summit in Serbia it was replaced with both the 12vs12 and the 30vs30 categories. 
* '''"Archery tournament"''' ([[bow and arrow|bow]] and [[crossbow]]). The tournament is held at a specially equipped place and it takes place for about 2 days. Categories and regulations may vary depending on the festival.


Valid non-battle categories

* '''"Contest for the best set of armor and weapons"''' is held among fighters of the national teams, who can demonstrate only those sets that were used in battles. Assessment is done by knight marshals, the refereeing panel and the organizers of the festival, who take into account the overall level of aesthetics, historicity of a set of armor and weapons, integrity of the individual elements, quality of the items.
* '''"Contest for the best authentic field camp"''' of a national team. Authenticity, accuracy, functionality, aesthetics and originality, as well as the size of an authentic field camp is assessed by the refereeing panel and the organizers of the festival (it takes place for one day).
* '''"Contest for the best fighting progress"''' The national team that has shown the most progress in relation to the previous years is awarded this title.

'''''Boy Wonder''''' is a novel by [[James Robert Baker]] published in 1988. The novel is a mock of oral history of Los Angeles, California in which we hear the life of Hollywood [[avant-garde]] film producer Shark Trager.

==Plot==

Orange County, California 1950: GALE 'SHARK' TRAGER is born to long-suffering WINNIE TRAGER in the backseat of her car at a drive-in.  Shark's arch-conservative father MAC TRAGER (who looks uncannily like actor Glenn Ford) learns the news and ends up running someone off the road on his way to the hospital.  Shark immediately is a strange kid, suffering from childhood obesity and not helped by the fact that Winnie is a hypochondriac and Mac is a racist bully.  When Winnie grows catatonic, Mac brings in sexy GLADYS FRAZER to take over the wife/mother role in the family.  Shark grows up, making friends with gay neighbor KENNY ROBERTS, acne-ridden misfit PUS JENKINS and intellect ELLIOT BERNSTEIN. Winnie dies after climbing into an active freezer and Gladys leaves Mac soon after as the neighbors shun her for being a homewrecker.

As Shark grows up, he falls in love with the movies—his only escape from the bleakness of his own sad childhood—and he becomes an insatiable cinemaphile. Mac's sister LORNA moves in to help Mac raise Shark, but spends her nights fending off Mac's lonely drunken advances. In high school, Shark loses his baby fat and matures into a rakishly handsome young man who strongly resembles Errol Flynn. One day while working at his father's gas station, Shark notices beautiful blonde California teen KATHY PETRO for the first time and he's instantly smitten with her. Kathy is the daughter of powerful local oil magnate JACK PETRO, but everyone at school frowns upon Shark, so Kathy doesn’t give him the time of day. Obsessed with Kathy, Shark takes a movie camera over to her house one night and films her from outside her bathroom window as she masturbates. When Shark tries to get the film developed, he's arrested and Kathy's parents soon learn what a pervert Shark is. Mac freaks out, taking away all of Shark's film equipment as punishment. Shark's relationship with his father only worsens after Shark starts dating an adorable Japanese girl named JUDY OSHIMA. When Mac orders Shark to drop his pants for a VD 'drip check,' Shark accuses the old man of being a homo; Mac is thunderstruck by this accusation—possibly because it's true? Another incident occurs when Kathy Petro makes out with a boy in the local movie theater and Shark, sitting jealously in the seat behind, accosts them. Unfortunately, Shark's girlfriend Judy dies when her moped is struck on the highway. Shark soon gains another friend, easy-going WOODY HAZZARD, a local surfer and small-time drug dealer whom Shark moves in with.

One day Kathy Petro shows up, trying to buy some acid for her boyfriend, JEFF STUBEN; she gets it, but when Jeff has a bad trip and accidentally cuts his own head off with a chainsaw, the cops storm Shark and Woody's place. Shark swallows all the acid and has a bad trip himself in jail. Shark decides to go to film school at UCLA and meets the sensitive and talented NEAL RIDGES, as well as sophisticated SIMONE GATANE. Shark moves into James Dean's old house in the valley and he and Simone start hooking up as he makes his maiden film, "PILLOW FUCK", a wry deconstruction of those insipid 1960s Rock Hudson/Doris Day romantic-comedies. The film is notoriously good and Shark's personal hero, famous French director JEAN-CLAUDE CITROEN, shows up for a screening. Unfortunately Citroen utterly trashes the film afterward and Shark is so devastated that he takes off and burns the only print. Soon after, Shark is living with a gung-ho nut named DRAKE BREWSTER who helps Shark lose weight again and get a security job in Santa Barbara. Shark gets a hold of a graduate student's screenplay and contacts fellow UCLA film student, SUE SCHLOCKMANN, whose father is a low-budget film distributor in Hollywood. Shark pumps up his relationship with Sue and gets her father to give him a producing deal. To everyone's surprise, "SEX KILL A GO-GO" is a huge success. When the draft board calls Shark in, he forces himself to ejaculate on the guy in line in front of him to get out of the draft. When Sue notices Shark's infatuation with Kathy Petro, she tries to distance herself from him, but Shark proposes and the two get married instead. Elliot Bernstein, who originally dated Sue and still loves her, is devastated.

Shark next does "REDNECK SCUM", but when he learns Kathy Petro has gone to France as a model and has started dating Jean-Claude Citroen, he decides to make the movie about them. Shark's obsession with Kathy gets the best of him and he starts dating a fifteen-year-old Lolita-esque Kathy lookalike named CINDY, whom he takes to Cannes along with his latest movie, a murderous lovers-on-the-run art film entitled "WHITE DESERT." Jean-Claude uses his power to get Shark's movie banned from competition, but a late night screening wins over the hearts of the viewers and it becomes a success. Unfortunately, Jean-Claude picks up Cindy and Shark tracks him down on the beach and beats the hell out of him. Shark returns to America only to find Sue's father, angry at Shark's abuse of his daughter, has slipped in some contractual wording and Shark now owes him $6 million. Luckily for Shark, another rival studio buys the pic and Shark's production deal away. Shark makes another movie with a Kathy Petro look-alike in the lead role, an "EXORCIST"-esque thriller called "THE CONDOIST." Kathy does her own movie, however, a small art house romantic-comedy—and winds up getting critically panned for her vapid, amateurish performance; Shark sends her an apologetic note. Soon after, Kathy starts dating BETH, a militant lesbian, and Shark makes yet another movie, this time about Kathy and Beth's relationship—a lesbian variation on "THE SEARCHERS" which Shark calls "SCAR." Beth's father, however, is a powerful guy in Hollywood and he gets the movie pulled. Unfortunately, Beth's father dies when Beth angrily confronts him, and Shark continues unabated. It's then that Shark meets CAROL VAN DER HOF, a charming socialite with a club foot. Shark ends up partnering with Carol and the two form the perfect personal and professional relationship. Hollywood loves them, although Carol is secretly enamored with Shark. Their next flick, a mod late-60s film entitled "MONDO JET SET," is a huge success. Simultaneously, Woody starts having an affair with Kathy, trying his best to keep it a secret from Shark. Kathy's in love for the first time, but everything changes when Woody starts dating a gay film exec named BRIAN STRAIGHT. Brian hates Shark and when Shark messes with Woody, Brian proposes to Kathy in order to help both their careers. Shark explodes when he learns of this, and he storms over to their house and beats the hell out of Brian.

Shark decides to make a movie out of a tragedy that happened in his neighborhood when childhood friend Pus Jenkins murdered a number of local teens. He spends millions on the first scene (an uninterrupted, twenty-minute long shot) and has to blackmail the studio boss with a sex film of his wife in order to keep the movie alive. In the end, Shark comes under fire for hiring Pus himself to play the father of one of the murdered teens. Even worse, Shark starts an affair with Carol, but when he spurns her, she goes on set and cuts off her own club foot. In the climactic scene where the house explodes (they’re filming at Shark's childhood home), Shark races up and dives into the freezer his mother died in just as the bombs go off. Shark survives, but afterward is stabbed by a family member of one of the films’ victims. The studio tries to shelve the film, entitled "RED SURF," but Shark spends all his millions to buy it back. Unfortunately, it's unreleasable and becomes Shark's own "HEAVEN'S GATE", effectively destroying his career.

Afterward, Shark falls into drugs and soon becomes homeless. A theater worker, TODD JARRETT, hires Shark to be his projectionist because of his film knowledge, but another incident with Kathy Petro gets him fired. Soon, Shark is a genuine bum down on Venice Beach and all those who once hailed him, now ignore him. One day, however, Woody, Elliot and Carol are having lunch and spot Shark getting beaten up by some black bums. Woody and Elliot rescue Shark and send him to a Nevada detox unit, which just happens to be run by his ex-roommate, Drake Brewster. Even worse, Kathy Petro, in a downward spiral of sleeping pills, has ended up there too. To their own surprise, the long-simmering heat between them finally explodes and the two end up making love. At the same time, Shark is having an affair with another patient, NARGES PAHLAVI-BARDAHL, an Iranian sheik's daughter. Narges promises to bankroll Shark's next film. Shark is back and producing a science-fiction film entitled "BLUE LIGHT," a movie no one thinks will work. He takes all his old compadres, even his father Mac, to Beirut to film. An incident involving his father and Drake Brewster culminates in Muslim fanatics almost killing them, but Shark proves to be a brave man when he bluffs being wired with explosives and talks his way out of danger. The movie becomes the highest-grossing film of all time and Shark returns to the top of Hollywood, but his fascination with Kathy Petro has driven Narges into drug dependency.

One day, Shark gets a call from the White House: RONALD REAGAN wants to meet him. Shark goes, not knowing Kathy is there at the same time to meet NANCY REAGAN and discuss her biography. Shark and Kathy end up making love in the Roosevelt room, but an unfortunate situation develops when a famous movie star donkey comes through the White House and the animal goes wild, nearly having sex with Kathy. Shark saves her from that fate. Shark and Kathy begin dating, but to Shark's sad surprise, the reality of achieving his life's desire doesn’t live up to the fantasy. Soon Shark writes a touching love story and offers Kathy the lead role. He plays upon her real-life tragedies to get her to cry on demand and the movie, "HOME TO THE HEART", is an emotional masterpiece. But Shark's enemies are too many and just after the movie is nominated for all kinds of Academy Awards, rumors of Shark's transgressions, true and false, come out. Shark becomes reviled. Even worse, the White House story comes out and Kathy is made to look like she had sex with the donkey.

Shark is slowly losing his mind and when the Academy Awards come around, he and Kathy attend, but they get booed quite a lot. Shark runs into Jean-Claude Citroen in the bathroom and attacks him, and we learn Jean-Claude regrets trashing Shark's first film: turns out he actually considered it a masterpiece but was too frightened by its power to tell Shark the truth. Afterward, Kathy wins for Best Actress and thanks Shark in her acceptance speech, but when a weaker film wins for Best Picture, Shark freaks out and nearly sodomizes his director with the Oscar he believes is rightfully his. Shark and Kathy flee the Awards, but when she puts up a fight in his car, Shark pushes her out onto the freeway. Believing she's dead, a distraught Shark drives back to the theater where he once worked to grab a film canister. The cops are after him. Shark speeds back to the exact spot where he was born, now a movieplex, and drives his car through the wall, killing a bunch of neo-Nazi kids. Unfortunately, cops arrive and shoot Shark dead. Shark is portrayed as a child killer in the media and his legacy is destroyed. Only Woody, Simone and Elliot show up for his funeral. Afterward, Kathy is given the film canister Shark tried to retrieve... and she cries when she sees it's footage of her on the beach when she was fourteen years old, something a young, lovestruck Shark filmed from afar...

'''Cato the Elder''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|eɪ|t|oʊ}}; {{lang-la|Cato Major}}; 234–149 BC), born {{nowrap|'''Marcus Porcius Cato'''}}{{refn|group=n|Properly, ''Marcus Porcius Marci filius Cato'': "Marcus Porcius Cato Junior".}} and also known as {{nowrap|'''Cato the Censor'''}} (''{{lang|la|Cato Censorius}}''), {{nowrap|'''Cato the Wise'''}} (''{{lang|la|Cato Sapiens}}''), and {{nowrap|'''Cato the Ancient'''}} (''{{lang|la|Cato Priscus}}''), was a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Roman Senate|senator]] and [[Roman historiography|historian]] known for his conservatism and opposition to [[Hellenization]].&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/99975/Marcus-Porcius-Cato |title=Marcus Porcius Cato |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]] |accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first to [[history of history#Roman world|write history]] in [[Latin]].

He came from an ancient [[Plebs|Plebeian]] family who were noted for their [[Roman army|military]] service. Like his forefathers, Cato was devoted to [[Roman agriculture|agriculture]] when not serving in the army. Having attracted the attention of [[Lucius Valerius Flaccus]], he was brought to [[Rome]] and began to follow the ''[[cursus honorum]]'': he was successively [[military tribune]] (214 BC), [[quaestor]] (204 BC), [[aedile]] (199 BC), [[praetor]] (198 BC), [[Roman consul|junior consul]] (195 BC) together with Flaccus, and [[Roman censor|censor]] (184 BC). As praetor, he expelled [[usury|usurers]] from [[Sardinia]]. As censor, he tried to preserve [[mos maiorum|Rome's ancestral customs]] and combat "degenerate" [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] influences.&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; His epithet "Elder" distinguishes him from his equally famous great-grandson [[Cato the Younger]], who opposed [[Julius Caesar]].

==Biography==
[[File:Tuscolo1.jpg|thumb|The theatre at [[Tusculum]]]]
Cato the Elder was born in the municipal town of [[Tusculum]], like some generations of his ancestors. His father had earned a reputation as a brave soldier, and his great-grandfather had received a reward from the state for having had five horses killed under him in battle. However, the Tusculan [[Porcii]] had never obtained the privileges of the Roman magistracy. Cato the Elder, their famous descendant, at the beginning of his career in [[History of Rome|Rome]], was regarded as a ''[[novus homo]]'' (new man), and the feeling of his unsatisfactory position, working along with the belief of his inherent superiority, aggravated and drove his ambition. Early in life, he so far exceeded the previous deeds of his predecessors that he is frequently spoken of not only as the leader, but as the founder of the [[Porcia (gens)|Porcia Gens]].

===Cognomen Cato===
His ancestors for three generations had been named Marcus Porcius, and it was said by [[Plutarch]] that at first he was known by the additional [[cognomen]] ''Priscus'', but was afterwards called Cato&amp;mdash;a word indicating that special practical wisdom that is the result of natural sagacity, combined with the experience of civil and political affairs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Cato the Elder'', 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Priscus, like ''Major'', may have been merely an epithet used to distinguish him from the later [[Cato of Utica]]. There is no precise information as to when he first received the title of Cato, which may have been given in childhood as a symbol of distinction. The qualities implied in the word Cato were acknowledged by the plainer and less outdated title of ''Sapiens'', by which he was so well known in his old age, that [[Cicero]] says, it became his virtual ''cognomen''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''Laelius On Friendship'', 2.&lt;/ref&gt; From the number and eloquence of his speeches, he was a styled orator,&lt;ref&gt;[[Justin (historian)|Justinus]], xxxiii. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gellius]], xvii. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; but Cato the Censor (''Cato Censorius''), and Cato the Elder are now his most common, as well as his most characteristic names, since he carried out the office of Censor with extraordinary standing and was the only Cato who ever held it.

===Deducing the year of birth===
In order to determine the date of Cato's birth, we consider the records as to his age at the time of his death, which is known to have happened in 149 BC. According to the coherent chronology of Cicero,{{refn|group=n|Cicero, speaking from the perspective of Cato: "I myself saw [[Livius Andronicus]] when he was an old man, who, though he brought out a play in the consulship of [[Gaius Claudius Centho|Cento]] and [[Marcus Sempronius Tuditanus|Tuditanus]] [i.e., 240 BC], six years before I was born, yet continued to live until I was a young man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Marcus Tullius|last=Cicero|title=On old age|chapter=Section 50 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Cato was born in 234 BC, in the year before the first Consulship of [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus]], and died at the age of 85, in the consulship of Lucius Marcius Censorinus and Manius Manilius. Pliny&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Natural History'', xxix. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; agrees with [[Cicero]]. Other authors exaggerate the age of Cato. According to Valerius Maximus&lt;ref&gt;Valerius Maximus, viii. 7. § 1.&lt;/ref&gt; he survived his 86th year; according to Livy&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''History of Rome'', xxxix. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; and Plutarch&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Cato the Elder'', 15.&lt;/ref&gt; he was 90 years old when he died. The exaggerated age, however, is inconsistent with a statement recorded by Plutarch&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Cato the Elder'', 1.&lt;/ref&gt; on the asserted authority of Cato himself.

Cato is represented to have said that he served his first campaign in his 17th year, when [[Hannibal]] was overrunning Italy. Plutarch, who had the works of Cato before him but was careless in dates, did not observe that the estimation of [[Livy]] would take back Cato's 17th year to 222, when there was not a [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginian]] in Italy, whereas the computation of Cicero would make the truth of Cato's statement in harmony with the date of Hannibal's first invasion.

===Youth===

====On the Punic Wars====
[[File:Heinrich Leutemann - Hannibals Übergang über die Alpen (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|[[Hannibal's crossing of the Alps|Hannibal and his men crossing the Alps]]]]
When Cato was very young, after his father's death, he inherited a small property in the [[Sabine]] territory, at a distance from his native town. There, he spent most of his childhood hardening his body by exercise, overseeing and sharing the operations of the farm, learning business and the rural economy. Near this land was a small hut abandoned after the triumphs of its owner [[Curius Dentatus|Manius Curius Dentatus]], whose military feats and rigidly simple character were remembered and admired in the neighborhood. Cato was inspired to imitate that character, hoping to match the glory of Dentatus.

Soon, an opportunity came for a military campaign in 217 BC, during the [[Second Punic War]] against [[Hannibal|Hannibal Barca]]. Experts express some disagreement about Cato's early military life. In 214 BC, he served at [[Capua]], and the historian Wilhelm Drumann&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Drumann, ''Geschichte Roms'' (History of Rome), v. p. 99, 6 Bde. Königsberg 1834-1844.&lt;/ref&gt; imagines that already, at the age of 20, he was a [[military tribune]]. [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus]] had the command in [[Campania]], during the year of his fourth consulship, and admitted the young soldier to the honour of intimate friendship.{{clarify|date=October 2018}} While Fabius communicated the valued results of military experience, he chose not to inculcate Cato with his personal and political values and preferences. At the siege of [[Taranto|Tarentum]], 209 BC, Cato was again at the side of Fabius. Two years later, Cato was one of the select group who went with the consul Claudius Nero{{clarify|date=October 2018}} on his northern march from [[Lucania]] to check the progress of [[Hasdrubal Barca]]. It is recorded that the services of Cato contributed to the decisive and important victory of Sena at the [[Battle of Metaurus]], where Hasdrubal was slain. He later gave several vehement speeches which he often ended by saying "''[[Carthago delenda est]]''", or "Carthage must be destroyed."&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Cato the Elder'', 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Between the wars====
In the pauses between campaigns Cato returned to his Sabine farm, where he dressed simply, working and behaving like his laborers. Young as he was, the neighboring farmers liked his tough mode of living, enjoyed his old-fashioned and concise proverbs, and had a high regard for his abilities. His own active personality made him willing and eager to employ his powers in the service of his neighbors. He was selected to act, sometimes as an arbitrator of disputes, and sometimes as a supporter in local causes, which were probably tried in front of ''recuperatores'' (the judges for causes of great public interest). Consequently, he was enabled to strengthen by practice his oratorical abilities, to gain self-confidence, to observe the manners of men, to analyze the diversity of human nature, to apply the rules of law, and to practically investigate the principles of justice.

====Follower of the old Roman strictness====
In the area surrounding Cato's Sabine farm were the lands of [[Lucius Valerius Flaccus]], a young nobleman of significant influence and high patrician family. Flaccus could not help remarking on Cato's energy, his military talent, his eloquence, his frugal and simple life, and his traditional principles. Flaccus himself was a member of that purist patrician faction which displayed its adherence to the stricter virtues of the ancient Roman character. Within Roman society a transition was in progress—from [[Samnium|Samnite]] rusticity to Grecian civilization and oriental voluptuousness. The chief [[Magistratus|magistracies]] of the state had become almost the patrimony of a few distinguished families whose wealth corresponded to their upper-class birth. Popular by acts of graceful but corrupting generosity, by charming manners, and by the appeal of hereditary honours, they collected the material power granted by a multitude of clients and followers, as well as the intellectual power provided by their monopoly on philosophical education, by their taste in the fine arts, and by their knowledge of stylish literature. Nevertheless, the reaction to them was strong. The less fortunate nobles, jealous of this exclusive oligarchy, and openly watchful of the decadence and disorder associated with luxury, placed themselves at the head of a party which showed its determination to rely on purer models and to attach much importance to the ancient ways. In their eyes, rusticity, austerity, and asceticism were the marks of Sabine robustness and religion and of the old Roman inflexible integrity and love of order. [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]], [[Scipio Africanus]] and his [[Scipio (cognomen)|family]], and [[Titus Quinctius Flamininus]], may be taken as representative of the new civilization; Cato's friends, Fabius and Flaccus, were the leading men in the faction defending the old plainness.

====Path to magistracies====
[[File:roman.forum.&amp;.arch.of.septimius.rome.arp.jpg|thumb|lright|Part of the Roman Forum. The arch was erected by [[Arch of Septimius Severus|Septimius Severus]].]]

Flaccus was a perceptive politician, who looked for young and emergent men to support him. He had observed Cato's martial spirit and heard his eloquent tongue. He knew how much courage and persuasiveness were valued at Rome. He also knew that distinction achieved on the battlefield opened the way to achievements in the higher civil offices. Finally, Flaccus knew too that for a stranger like Cato, the only way to the magisterial honors was success in the [[Roman Forum]].{{refn|group=n|Compare that conception with the opinion stated by [[Montesquieu]] about the subsequent corruption of Rome during the [[Roman Republican civil wars|civil wars]] between [[Gaius Marius]] and [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]]'s factions: "But, in general, the Romans knew only the art of war, which was the sole ''path to magistracies'' and honors. Thus, the martial virtues remained after all the others were lost."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Montesquieu |author-link=Montesquieu |title=Considerations on the Causes of the Greatness of the Romans and their Decline |at=Ch.&amp;nbsp;X |date=1734 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} For that reason, he suggested to Cato that he shift his ambition to the fruitful field of Roman politics. The advice was keenly followed. Invited to the townhouse of Flaccus, and ratified by his support, Cato began to distinguish himself in the forum, and became a candidate for assuming a post in the magistracy.

===Early military career===

====Quaestor====
In 205 BC, Cato was appointed [[Quaestor]], and in the next year (204 BC) he entered upon the duties of his place of work, following [[Scipio Africanus|Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus Major]] to Sicily. When Scipio, after much opposition, obtained from the senate permission to transport armed forces from Sicily to [[Africa Province|Africa]], Cato and [[Gaius Laelius]] were appointed to escort the baggage ships. Yet there proved not to be the friendliness of cooperation between Cato and Scipio which ought to have existed between a quaestor and his [[proconsul]].

Fabius had opposed the permission given to Scipio to carry the attack to the enemy's home, and Cato, whose appointment was intended to monitor Scipio's behavior, adopted the views of his friend. Plutarch reports that the lenient discipline of the troops under Scipio's command and the exaggerated expenses incurred by the general provoked Cato's protests, such that Scipio, immediately afterward, replied angrily, saying he would give an account of victories, not of money. Cato left his place of duty after the dispute with Scipio about the latter's alleged extravagance, and returning to Rome, condemned the uneconomical activities of his general to the senate. Plutarch went on to say that at the joint request of Cato and Fabius, a commission of tribunes was sent to Sicily to examine Scipio's activity. Upon their review of his extensive and careful arrangements for the transport of the troops, they determined he was not guilty of Cato's charges.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Cato the Elder'', 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Plutarch's version, which would seem to attribute to Cato the wrongdoing of quitting his post before his time, is barely consistent with Livy's narrative. If Livy is correct, the commission was sent because of the complaints of the inhabitants of Locri, who had been harshly oppressed by [[Quintus Pleminius]], Scipio's legate. Livy says not a word of Cato's interference in this matter, but mentions the bitterness with which Fabius blamed Scipio for corrupting military discipline and for having illegally left his province to take the town of [[Locri]].&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''History of Rome'', xxix. 19, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The author of the abridged life of Cato, commonly considered the work of [[Cornelius Nepos]], asserts that Cato, after his return from Africa, put in at [[Sardinia]], and brought the poet [[Quintus Ennius]] in his own ship from the island to Italy. But because Sardinia is rather out of the line of the trip to Rome, it is more likely that the first contact between Ennius and Cato happened at a later date, when the latter was [[Praetor]] in Sardinia.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Aurelius Victor]], ''On famous Roman men'', 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aedile and praetor====
In 199 BC Cato was chosen [[aedile]], and with his colleague Helvius, restored the Plebeian Games, and gave upon that occasion a banquet in honor of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]. In 198 BC he was made [[praetor]], and obtained Sardinia as his province, with the command of 3,000 infantry and 200 cavalry. Here he took the earliest opportunity to demonstrate his main beliefs by practicing his strict public morality. He reduced official operating costs, walked his trips with a single assistant, and, by the studied lack of ceremony, placed his own frugality in striking contrast with the oppressive opulence of provincial magistrates. The rites of religion were celebrated with reasonable thrift, justice was administered with strict [[impartiality]]; [[usury]] was controlled with deep severity, and the usurers were banished. Sardinia had been for some time completely calmed, but according to Aurelius Victor,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; a revolt in the island was subdued by Cato during his Praetorship.

===Consul===

====Enactment of the Porcian Laws====
{{main|Porcian Laws}}
In 195 BC, when he was only 39 years old, Cato was elected [[junior consul]] to his old friend and patron Flaccus. During his consulship, he enacted the first two of the [[Porcian Laws]], which expanded the protections of [[Roman citizen]]s against degrading or capricious punishment under the Republic's [[Valerian Law]].

====Repeal of the Oppian Law====
{{main|Oppian Law}}
In 215 BC, at the height of the Second Punic War and at the request of the [[tribune of the plebs]] Gaius Oppius, the [[Oppian Law]] (''Lex Oppia''), intended to restrict the luxury and extravagance of women in order to save money for the public treasury, was passed. The law specified that no woman could own more than half an ounce of gold, nor wear a garment of several colours, nor drive a carriage with horses closer than a mile to the city, except to attend public celebrations of religious rites.

After [[Hannibal]] was defeated and [[Rome]] was resplendent with [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginian]] wealth, Tribunes Marcus Fundanius and Lucius Valerius proposed to abolish the Oppian law, but Tribunes Marcus Junius Brutus and Titus Junius Brutus opposed doing so. This conflict spawned far more interest than the most important state affairs. Middle-aged married Roman women crowded the streets, blocked access to the forum, and intercepted their approaching husbands, demanding to restore the ancient ornaments of Roman matrons. They even begged the Praetors, Consuls and other magistrates. Even Flaccus hesitated, but his colleague Cato was inflexible, and made a characteristically impolite speech, which was later retold by Livy.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, History of Rome, xxxiv. 1, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the dissenting tribunes withdrew their opposition and the Oppian law was repealed by vote of all tribes. Women went in procession through the streets and the forum, dressed up with their now legitimate finery.&lt;ref&gt;[[Valerius Maximus]], ix. 1. §3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Just after this controversy had been settled, Cato, who had maintained a severe and determined firm opposition, seems to have suffered no very real damage to his popularity. He soon set sail for his appointed province, [[Hispania Citerior]].

====Post in Hispania Citerior====
In his campaign in [[Hispania]], Cato behaved in keeping with his reputation of untiring hard work and alertness. He lived soberly, sharing the food and the labours of the common soldier. Wherever it was possible, he personally superintended the execution of his requisite orders. His movements were reported as bold and rapid, and he never was negligent in pushing the advantages of victory. The sequence of his operations and their combination in agreement with the schemes of other generals in other parts of Hispania appear to have been carefully designed. His stratagems and manoeuvres were accounted as original, talented, and successful; and the plans of his battles were arranged with expert skill. He managed to set tribe against tribe, benefited himself from native deceitfulness, and took native mercenaries into his pay.

[[File:Hispania 1a division provincial.PNG|thumb|250px|right|[[Hispania]] in 197 BC]]

The details of the campaign, as related by Livy,&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''History of Rome'', book xxxiv.&lt;/ref&gt; and illustrated by the incidental anecdotes of [[Plutarch]], are full of horror and they make clear that Cato reduced [[Hispania Citerior]] to subjection with great speed and little mercy. We read of multitudes who, after they had been stripped of all their arms, put themselves to death because of the dishonour, of extensive massacres of surrendered victims, and the frequent execution of harsh plunders. The phrase [[bellum se ipsum alet]]—the war feeds itself—was coined by Cato during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Latein - Deutsch: Zitaten-Lexikon|first=Ernst|last=Lautenbach|publisher=LIT Verlag|location=Berlin-Hamburg-Münster|year=2002|isbn=3-8258-5652-6|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=qepmsXSNHtsC&amp;pg=PA101|accessdate=2009-09-09|language=German|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; His proceedings in Hispania were not discrepant with the received idea of the fine old Roman soldier or with his own firm and over-assertive temper. He claimed to have destroyed more towns in Hispania than he had spent days in that country.

====Roman triumph====
After he reduced the area between the River [[Ebro|Iberus]] and the [[Pyrenees]] to a resentful and, as it turned out, temporary obedience, Cato turned his attention to administrative reforms, and increased the revenues of the province by improvements in the working of the [[iron]] and [[silver mine]]s.

For his achievements in Hispania, the senate decreed a thanksgiving ceremony of three days. In the course of the year 194 BC, he returned to Rome and was rewarded with the honor of a [[Roman triumph]], at which he exhibited an extraordinary quantity of captured [[brass]], silver, and [[gold]], both coin and ingots. Cato distributed the monetary prize to his soldiery, and was more liberal than might have been expected from his vigorous parsimony.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''History of Rome'', xxxiv. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

====End of consulship====
The return of Cato seems to have accelerated the enmity of [[Scipio Africanus]], who was Consul in 194 BC and is said to have desired the command of the province in which Cato was harvesting notoriety. There is some disagreement between Nepos (or the pseudo-Nepos), and Plutarch,&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Cato the Elder'', 11.&lt;/ref&gt; in their accounts of this topic. Nepos claims that Scipio failed to obtain the province, and, offended by the rejection, remained after his consulship in a private capacity at Rome. Plutarch claims that Scipio, who was disgusted by Cato's severity, was appointed to succeed him but could not convince the senate to censure Cato's administration, and passed his consulship in inactivity. Plutarch was probably mistaken, judging by the statement in Livy,&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''History of Rome'', xxxiv. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; that in 194 BC, Sextus Digitius was appointed to the province of Hispania Citerior. The notion that Scipio was appointed successor to Cato in Hispania may have arisen from a double confusion of name and place, since [[Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica]] was chosen in 194 BC to the province of [[Hispania Ulterior]].

However true this account, Cato used his eloquence and produced detailed financial accounts to successfully defend against criticism of his consulship. The known fragments of the speeches (or one speech under different names) made after his return attest to the strength and boldness of his arguments.

Plutarch&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Cato the Elder'', 12.&lt;/ref&gt; affirms that, after his Consulship, Cato accompanied [[Tiberius Sempronius Longus (consul 194 BCE)|Tiberius Sempronius Longus]] as [[legatus]] to [[Thrace]], but this seems incorrect because, although Scipio Africanus believed that one Consul should have [[Macedon]]ia, Sempronius was soon in [[Cisalpine Gaul]],&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''History of Rome'', xxxiv. 43, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 193 BC Cato was in Rome dedicating a small temple to [[Victoria (mythology)|Victoria]] Virgo.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''History of Rome'', xxxv. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late military career===

====Battle of Thermopylae====
The military career of Cato was not yet ended. In 191 BC, he, along with his old associate [[Lucius Valerius Flaccus (consul 195 BC)|Lucius Valerius Flaccus]], was appointed as a lieutenant-general under the Consul [[Manius Acilius Glabrio (consul 191 BC)|Manius Acilius Glabrio]], who had been dispatched to [[Hellenistic Greece|Greece]] to oppose the invasion of [[Antiochus III the Great]], King of the [[Seleucid Empire]]. In the decisive [[Battle of Thermopylae (191 BC)]], which led to the downfall of Antiochus, Cato behaved with his usual valor, and enjoyed good fortune. By a daring and difficult advance, he surprised and removed a body of the enemy's [[Aetolia]]n [[auxiliaries]], who were posted upon the Callidromus, the highest peak of the range of [[Mount Oeta]]. Then, coming to the aid of forces under Flaccus's command, he began a sudden descent from the hills above the royal camp, and the panic caused by this unexpected movement promptly turned the day in favor of the Romans, and signaled the end of the Seleucid invasion of Greece. After the action, the General hugged Cato with the greatest warmth and attributed to him the whole credit of the victory. That this is a fact rests on the authority of Cato himself, who, like [[Cicero]], often indulged in the habit, offensive to modern taste, of sounding his own praises. After an interval spent in the pursuit of Antiochus and the pacification of Greece, Cato was sent to Rome by the Consul Glabrio to announce the successful outcome of the campaign, and he performed his journey with such celerity that he had started his report in the senate before the return of [[Lucius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus|Lucius Cornelius Scipio]], the later conqueror of Antiochus, who had been sent off from Greece a few days before him.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''History of Rome'', xxxvi. 17-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Doubtful visit to Athens====
During the campaign in Greece under Glabrio, Plutarch's account (albeit rejected by historian Wilhelm Drumann) suggests that before the Battle of Thermopylae, Cato was chosen to prevent [[Corinth]], [[Patrae]], and [[Aegium]] from siding with Antiochus. During this period, Cato visited [[Athens]] where, in trying to prevent the Athenians from listening to the propositions of the Seleucid king, Cato addressed them in a [[Latin]] speech, which required an interpreter to be understood by the audience. Whether this was out of necessity or merely a choice by Cato remains unclear, however, since the assertion that he might very well have already known Greek at the time can be made from anecdotal evidence. For example, Plutarch said that while at [[Taranto|Tarentum]] in his youth he had developed a close friendship with Nearchus, who was himself a Greek [[philosopher]]. Similarly, [[Aurelius Victor]] stated he had received instruction in Greek from Ennius while praetor in Sardinia. Nevertheless, because his speech was an affair of state, it is probable that he complied with the Roman norms of the day in using the Latin language, which compliance was considered in diplomacy as a mark of Roman [[Dignitas (Roman concept)|dignity]].&lt;ref&gt;Valerius Maximus, ii, 2. § 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence in Rome===
His reputation as a soldier was now established; henceforth he preferred to serve the state at home, scrutinizing the conduct of the candidates for public honours and of generals in the field. If he was not personally engaged in the prosecution of the Scipiones (Africanus and [[Scipio Asiaticus|Asiaticus]]) for corruption, it was his spirit that animated the attack upon them. Even [[Scipio Africanus Major|Scipio Africanus]]—who refused to reply to the charge, saying only, "Romans, this is the day on which I conquered Hannibal" and was absolved by acclamation—found it necessary to retire, self-banished, to his villa at [[Liternum]]. Cato's enmity dated from the African campaign when he quarreled with Scipio for his lavish distribution of the spoil among the troops, and his general luxury and extravagance.

Cato was also opposed to the spread of Hellenic culture, which he believed threatened to destroy the rugged simplicity of the conventional Roman type. It was in the discharge of this censorship that his determination to oppose Hellenism was most strongly exhibited, and hence, the behavior from which was derived the title (the Censor) by which he is most generally distinguished. He revised with unsparing severity the lists of Senators and Knights, ejecting from either order the men whom he judged unworthy of membership, either on moral grounds or on the basis of their lack the prescribed means. The expulsion of [[L. Quinctius Flamininus]] for wanton cruelty was an example of his rigid justice.

His regulations against luxury were very stringent. He imposed a heavy tax upon dress and personal adornment, especially of women, and upon young slaves purchased as favourites. In 181 BC he supported the ''lex Orchia'' (according to others, he first opposed its introduction, and subsequently its repeal), which prescribed a limit to the number of guests at an entertainment, and in 169 BC the ''lex Voconia'', one of the provisions of which was intended to limit the accumulation of what Cato considered an undue proportion of wealth in the hands of women.

===Public works===
Among other things he repaired the [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]], cleansed the [[sanitary sewer|sewer]]s, and prevented private persons drawing off public water for their own use. The [[Aqua Appia]] was the first aqueduct of [[Rome]]. It was constructed in 312 BC by Appius Claudius Caecus, the same Roman censor who also built the important Via Appia. Unauthorised plumbing into Rome's [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]] had always been a problem, as [[Frontinus]] records much later. Cato also ordered the demolition of houses which encroached on the public way, and built the first [[basilica]] in the [[Roman Forum|Forum]] near the [[Curia]] (Livy, ''History'', 39.44; Plutarch, ''Marcus Cato'', 19).&lt;ref name="Woolf2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Greg Woolf]]|title=Rome: An Empire's Story|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AeTUAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA295|date=7 November 2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-967751-1|pages=295–}}&lt;/ref&gt; He raised the amount paid by the [[publicani]] for the right to collect taxes and, at the same time, reduced the contract prices for the construction of public works.

===Later years===
From the date of his Censorship (184 BC) to his death in 149 BC, Cato held no public office, but continued to distinguish himself in the senate as the persistent opponent of the new ideas. He was struck with horror, along with many other Romans of the graver stamp, at the licence of the [[Bacchanalian]] mysteries, which he attributed to the influence of [[Hellenistic civilization|Greek]] manners; and he vehemently urged the dismissal of the philosophers [[Carneades]], [[Diogenes of Babylon|Diogenes]], and [[Critolaus]], who had come as ambassadors from [[Athens]], on account of what he believed was the dangerous nature of their ideas. He also uttered warnings against the mischievous influence of Chaldean astrologers who had entered Italy along with Greek culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02018e.htm Astrology, Catholic Encyclopaedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

He had a horror of physicians, who were chiefly Greeks. He procured the release of [[Polybius]], the historian, and his fellow prisoners, contemptuously asking whether the Senate had nothing more important to do than discuss whether a few Greeks should die at Rome or in their own land. It was not till his eightieth year that he made his first acquaintance with Greek literature, though some think after examining his writings that he may have had a knowledge of Greek works for much of his life.

In his last years, he was known for strenuously urging his countrymen to prosecute the [[Third Punic War]] and to destroy [[Carthage]]. In 157 BC, he was one of the deputies sent to Carthage to arbitrate between the [[Carthaginians]] and [[Massinissa]], king of [[Numidia]]. The mission was unsuccessful and the commissioners returned home, but Cato was so struck by Carthage's growing prosperity that he was convinced that the security of Rome depended on its annihilation. From that time, he began concluding his speeches—on any topic whatsoever—with the cry, "Moreover, I advise that [[Carthago delenda est|Carthage must be destroyed]]" (''{{lang|la|Ceterum censeo Carthaginem esse delendam}}'').&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Plutarch |author-link=Plutarch |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cato_Major*.html |title=Life of Cato }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other times, "Carthage must be destroyed" was put more compactly as ''{{lang|la|[[Carthago delenda est]]}}'' or ''{{lang|la|delenda est Carthago}}''. [[Cicero]]'s [[dialogue (fiction)|dialogue]] ''[[De Senectute|Cato the Elder on Old Age]]'' also depicted Cato's antipathy to Carthage.{{refn|group=n|"...I enjoin upon the Senate what is to be done, and how. Carthage has long been harbouring&lt;!--sic--&gt; evil designs, and I accordingly proclaim war against her in good time. I shall never cease to entertain fears about her till I hear of her having been levelled&lt;!--sic--&gt; with the ground."&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero|Tullius Cicero, Marcus]] (44&amp;nbsp;BC), ''[http://www.bartleby.com/9/2/1.html On Old Age]'', ''[[Harvard Classics|Five Foot Shelf of Classics]]'', {{nowrap|Vol. IX,}} {{nowrap|Pt. 2,}} New York: translated for P.F. Collier &amp; Son by Evelyn Shirley Shuckburgh in 1909, [http://www.bartleby.com/9/2/1.html#15 §15].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;''{{lang|la|...Senatui quae sint gerenda praescribo et quo modo, Carthagini male iam diu cogitanti bellum multo ante denuntio, de qua vereri non ante desinam, quam illam excissam esse cognovero.}}''&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero|Tullius Cicero, Marcus]] {{nowrap|(44 BC),}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=gbnz0bljUhoC ''Cato Maior de Senectute''] [''Cato the Elder on Old Age''], ''Cambridge Classical Texts and Commentaries'', {{nowrap|№ 28,}} [[Cambridge, England|Cambridge]]: Cambridge University Press, published 1988, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gbnz0bljUhoC&amp;pg=PA62 vi, 18], {{ISBN|0-521-60704-3}}. {{la icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To Cato the individual life was a continual discipline, and public life was the discipline of the many. He regarded the individual householder as the germ of the family, the family as the germ of the state. By strict economy of time he accomplished an immense amount of work; he exacted similar application from his dependents, and proved himself a hard husband, a strict father, and a severe and cruel master. There was little difference, apparently, in the esteem in which he held his wife and his slaves; his pride alone induced him to take a warmer interest in his sons, [[Marcus Porcius Cato Licinianus]] and [[Marcus Porcius Cato Salonianus]].

To the Romans themselves little in this behavior seemed worthy of censure; it was respected rather as a traditional example of the old Roman manners. In the remarkable passage ([https://web.archive.org/web/20110216165027/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=Liv5His.sgm&amp;images=images%2Fmodeng&amp;data=%2Ftexts%2Fenglish%2Fmodeng%2Fparsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=367&amp;division=div2 xxxix. 40]) in which [[Livy]] describes the character of Cato, there is no word of blame for the rigid discipline of his household.

==Physical appearance==
Plutarch wrote that Cato's appearance was characterized by [[Red hair|reddish hair]] and keen [[grey eyes]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

==Cato's writings==
[[File:Rustici latini volgarizzati.tif|thumb|Italian translation of ''De re rustica'' (1794)]]
Cato is famous not only as statesman or soldier, but also as author. He was a historian, the first [[Latin literature|Latin]] prose writer of any importance, and the first author of a history of [[Italy]] in Latin. Some have argued that if it were not for the impact of Cato's writing, Latin might have been supplanted by Greek as the literary language of Rome. He was also one of the very few early Latin authors who could claim Latin as a native language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Dalby|1998|pp=7–8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

* His manual on running a farm (''[[De Agri Cultura]]'' or "On Agriculture") (c. 160 BC) is his only work that survives completely. It is a miscellaneous collection of rules of husbandry and management, including sidelights on country life in the 2nd century BC. Adopted by many as a textbook at a time when Romans were expanding their agricultural activities into larger scale and more specialized business ventures geared towards profitability, ''De Agri Cultura'' assumes a farm run and staffed by slaves. Cato advises on hiring gangs for the olive harvest,&lt;ref&gt;Cato, ''[[De Agri Cultura]]'' ch. 64-68.&lt;/ref&gt; and was noted for his chilling advice on keeping slaves continually at work, on reducing rations for slaves when sick, and on selling slaves that are old or sickly.&lt;ref&gt;Cato, ''[[De Agri Cultura]]'' ch. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Intended for reading aloud and discussing with farm workers, ''De Agri Cultura'' was widely read and much quoted (sometimes inaccurately) by later Latin authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Dalby|1998|pp=22–28}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Cato the Elder ranked the vineyard as the most important aspect when judging a farm. This was because of the profitability of the wine trade during that time. Grain pastures were ranked sixth due to the grain crisis.&lt;ref&gt;E.M. Jellinek, "Drinking and Alcohilics in Ancient Rome". Journal of Studies on Alcohol. Vol 7, No 11, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Probably Cato's most important work, ''[[Origines]]'', in seven books (c. 168 BC), related the history of the Italian towns, with special attention to Rome, from their legendary or historical foundation to his own day. Written to teach Romans what it means to be Roman, Cato the Elder wrote ''ab urbe condita'' (from the founding of the city), and the early history is filled with legends illustrating Roman virtues.  The ''Origines'' also spoke of how not only Rome, but the other Italian towns were venerable, and claimed the Romans were indeed superior to the Greeks.  The text as a whole is lost, but substantial fragments survive in quotations by later authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Chassignet|1986}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Under the Roman Empire a collection of about 150 political speeches by Cato existed. In these he pursued his political policies, fought verbal vendettas, and opposed what he saw as Rome's moral decline. Not even the titles of all of these speeches are now known, but fragments of some of them are preserved. The first to which we can give a date was ''On the Improper Election of the Aediles'', delivered in 202 BC. The collection included several speeches from the year of his consulship, followed by a self-justifying retrospect ''On His Consulship'' and by numerous speeches delivered when he was Censor. It is not clear whether Cato allowed others to read and copy his written texts (in other words, whether he "published" the speeches) or whether their circulation in written form began after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Malcovati|1955}}; {{Harv|Dalby|1998|p=13}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''On Soldiery'' was perhaps a practical manual comparable to ''On Farming''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Astin|1978|pp=184–185}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This work is considered lost&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8jIZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA392#v=onepage&amp;q=agriculture&amp;f=false|title=Plutarch's Lives of Illustrious Men|last=Plutarch|date=1853-01-01|publisher=Henry G. Bohn|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''On the Law Relating to Priests and Augurs'' was a topic that would follow naturally from some of the sections of ''On Farming''. Only one brief extract from this work is known.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Astin|1978|p=185}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Praecepta ad Filium'', "Maxims addressed to his son,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Astin|1978|pp=332–340}}.&lt;/ref&gt; from which the following extract survives:

{{quote|In due course, my son Marcus, I shall explain what I found out in Athens about these Greeks, and demonstrate what advantage there may be in looking into their writings (while not taking them too seriously). They are a worthless and unruly tribe. Take this as a prophecy: when those folk give us their writings they will corrupt everything. All the more if they send their doctors here. They have sworn to kill all barbarians with medicine—and they charge a fee for doing it, in order to be trusted and to work more easily. They call us barbarians, too, of course, and ''[[Oscans|Opici]]'', a dirtier name than the rest. I have forbidden you to deal with doctors.|Quoted by [[Pliny the Elder]], ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'' 29.13–14.}}

* A history of Rome from which Cato taught his son to read.
* ''Carmen de moribus'' ("Poem on morality"), apparently in prose in spite of the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Astin|1978|pp=185–186}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A collection of ''Sayings'', some of them translated from Greek.

The two surviving collections of proverbs known as ''[[Distichs of Cato]]'' and ''[[Monosticha Catonis]]'', in [[hexameter]] verse, probably belong to the 4th century AD and are not works of Cato the Elder

==Legacy==
The [[wrinkle ridge]] system [[Dorsa Cato]] on the [[Moon]] is named after Cato.

The [[comune]] of [[Monte Porzio Catone]], one of the [[Castelli Romani]] and close to the ruins of Tusculum, is named in honor of the Porcius Cato family.

Cato is portrayed by [[Vittorio Gassman]] in ''[[Scipio the African|Scipione detto anche l'Africano]]'', a 1971 Italian film starring [[Marcello Mastroianni]] as Scipio Africanus.

'''Economism''' is a term in [[Marxist]] discourse.  It was used by [[Lenin]] in his attacks on [[Karl Kautsky]] and the Social Democratic Party of late 19th and early 20th century Germany.

{{Quote|text=The Economists [in Russia] limited the tasks of the working class to an economic struggle for higher wages and better working conditions, etc., asserting that the political struggle was the business of the liberal bourgeoisie. They denied the leading role of the party of the working class, considering that the party should merely observe the spontaneous process of the movement and register events. In their deference to spontaneity in the working-class movement, the Economists belittled the significance of revolutionary theory and class-consciousness, asserted that socialist ideology could emerge from the spontaneous movement, denied the need for a Marxist party to instil socialist consciousness into the working-class movement, and thereby cleared the way for bourgeois ideology. The Economists, who opposed the need to create a centralized working-class party, stood for the sporadic and amateurish character of individual circles [or collectives]. Economism threatened to divert the working class from the class revolutionary path and turn it into a political appendage of the bourgeoisie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lenin|first1=V.I.|title=A Talk With Defenders of Economism|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1901/dec/06.htm|website=Marxists Internet Archive|accessdate=14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The charge of economism is frequently brought against revisionists by [[Anti-Revisionism|anti-revisionists]], when economics, instead of politics, is placed in command of society; when primacy of the development of the productive forces is held over concerns for the nature and relations surrounding those productive forces. This debate was most notable upon [[Deng Xiaoping]] assuming leadership of the Communist Part of China, criticising the Maoist line as ultra-leftist and accusing them of building socialism before the economy was ready. Maoists in turn criticised Deng Xiaoping for abandoning socialism in favour of opening up the Chinese economy to capitalist reforms in a needless pursuit of expertise and recognition from capitalist nations to fuel growth.{{cn|date=September 2014}}

== Other uses ==
For bourgeois capitalist economists, "economism" is [[reductionism|reduction]] of all [[social fact]]s to [[economic]] dimensions. The term is often used to criticize economics as an [[ideology]], in which [[supply and demand]] are the only important factors in decisions, and outstrip or permit ignoring all other factors. It is believed to be a side effect of [[neoclassical economics]] and blind faith in an "[[invisible hand]]" or "[[laissez-faire]]" means of making decisions, extended far beyond controlled and regulated markets, and used to make political and military decisions. Conventional [[ethics]] would play no role in decisions under pure economism, except insofar as supply would be withheld, demand curtailed, by moral choices of individuals. Thus, critics of economism insist on [[politics|political]] and other [[culture|cultural]] dimensions in [[society]]. 

[[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]] social critic [[Albert Jay Nock]] used the term more broadly, denoting a moral and social philosophy "which interprets the whole sum of human life in terms of the production, acquisition, and distribution of wealth".  He went on to say "I have sometimes thought that here may be the rock on which Western civilization will finally shatter itself.  Economism can build a society which is rich, prosperous, powerful, even one which has a reasonably wide diffusion of material well-being.  It can not build one which is lovely, one which has savor and depth, and which exercises the irresistible power of attraction that loveliness wields.  Perhaps by the time economism has run its course the society it has built may be tired of itself, bored of its own hideousness, and may  despairingly consent to annihilation, aware that it is too ugly to be let live any longer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nock |first=Albert Jay |title=Memoirs Of A Superfluous Man |page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2154">'''Genaro Estrada''' (June 2, 1887 – September 29, 1937) was a Mexican [[politician|statesman]], [[academia|academic]], and [[writer]]. He was [[Secretary of Foreign Affairs (Mexico)|Secretary of Foreign Affairs]] of Mexico between 1930 and 1932 and the architect of the [[Estrada Doctrine]], which stated that the Mexican government would acknowledge any foreign government, no matter how it came into power. This doctrine would influence Mexican politics all throughout the 20th century.

==Biography==

Estrada was born in [[Mazatlán]], [[Sinaloa]]. He served as a journalist in Mazatlán early in life and moved to [[Mexico City]] in 1912, where he was professor at the [[Escuela Nacional Preparatoria]] and entered the capital's cultural and political life. He became involved in government after the [[Mexican Revolution]]. By the end of the 1920s he served as [[ambassador]] to Spain and minister to Portugal and [[Turkey]]. He later became professor at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]], where he founded the [[Academia Mexicana de la Historia]]. He also published a novel, ''Pero Galín'' (1926), and four books of [[satire|satirical]] and political poetry. He died in Mexico City in 1937.

The '''Ghaza''' or '''Ghazi thesis''' (from {{lang-ota|غزا}}, ''ġazā'', "holy war," or simply "raid"){{refn|group=nb|The ''Cambridge History of Turkey'' defines ''ghaza'' as "a raid for plunder, later came to mean holy war fought for Islam."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor= Kate Fleet |title=The Cambridge History of Turkey |volume= 1, Byzantium to Turkey, 1071–1453 |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |place=Cambridge |page=424 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} is a historical [[paradigm]] first formulated by [[Paul Wittek]] which has been used to interpret the nature of the [[Ottoman Empire]] during the earliest period of its history, the fourteenth century,&lt;ref name=Kafadar&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State |date=1995 |page=xi–xii }}&lt;/ref&gt; and its subsequent history. The thesis addresses the question of how the Ottomans were able to expand from a small principality on the frontier of the [[Byzantine Empire]] into a centralized, intercontinental empire. According to the Ghaza thesis, the Ottomans accomplished this by attracting recruits to fight for them in the name of [[Islamic holy war]] against the [[kafir|non-believers]]. Such a warrior was known in [[Turkish Language|Turkish]] as a ''[[ghazi (warrior)|ghazi]]'', and thus this thesis sees the early Ottoman state as a "Ghazi State," defined by an ideology of holy war. The Ghaza Thesis dominated early Ottoman historiography throughout much of the twentieth century before coming under increasing criticism beginning in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Kafadar" /&gt; Historians now generally reject the Ghaza Thesis, and consequently the idea that Ottoman expansion was primarily fueled by holy war, but are conflicted with regard to what to replace it with.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor= Kate Fleet |title=The Cambridge History of Turkey |volume= 1, Byzantium to Turkey, 1071–1453 |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |place=Cambridge |last=Lindner |first=Rudi Paul |page=104 |chapter= Anatolia, 1300–1451 |quote=Scholars following in Wittek's footsteps have moved away from his strong formulation [...] It is probably safe to suggest that at the moment there is no agreed point of reference about which most scholars gather, and that a more eclectic approach, resting more on the sources than on scholarly tradition, holds the field. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ghaza/&gt;

==Formation of the Ghaza thesis==

The Ghaza thesis was first formulated in the 1930s by Turkish historian [[Mehmet Fuat Köprülü|Fuat Köprülü]] and Austrian historian [[Paul Wittek]]. Partly in response to contemporary [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] historians, who tried to marginalize the role of the Turks in Ottoman state formation, Köprülü formulated what was to become the [[Turkish nationalist]] view of early Ottoman history. According to Köprülü, the Ottoman polity was formed by Turkish tribes fleeing the advance of the [[Mongol Empire]], built upon Turkish tribal manpower, and administered by men from the Anatolian hinterland experienced in the Turco-Muslim political tradition of the [[Sultanate of Rum|Seljuks]]. Paul Wittek, responding to Köprülü's claims, accepted the Turco-Muslim basis of the early Ottoman state, agreeing that it grew out of the already highly developed civilization of Seljuk Anatolia and was fundamentally shaped by the unique conditions of the Byzantine frontier. Yet rather than Turkish ethnicity and tribal connections, he placed his primary emphasis upon the role of Islam. For Wittek, the Ottomans were first and foremost Islamic holy warriors. His primary evidence for this included the titles adopted by early Ottoman rulers, including an inscription erected in [[Bursa]] in 1337 describing [[Orhan]], the second Ottoman ruler, as "ghazi, son of ghazi." Wittek also relied upon the work of the early fifteenth-century Ottoman poet Ahmedi, who likewise described the early Ottoman rulers as ghazis. Thus in this formulation, the early Ottoman polity was built upon an "ideology of Holy War," and was able to grow powerful by attracting warriors to join in conquering the Christians of Anatolia and the Balkans. The early Ottomans harnessed the religious and martial energies of the frontier (''uc'') between the crumbling Byzantine and Seljuk states in order to conquer an empire.&lt;ref&gt;For this summary of their views, {{Cite book |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State |date=1995 |page=10–11, 35–41, 48 }} For these authors' works see {{Cite book |last=Wittek |first=Paul |title=The Rise of the Ottoman Empire |date=1938}}; and {{Cite book |last=Köprülü |first=Mehmet Fuat |title=Les origines de l'empire ottoman |place=Paris |date=1935}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was Wittek's formulation which became generally (though not unanimously) accepted among Western historians of the Ottoman Empire for much of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State |date=1995 |page=41 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revisionism==

The fundamental problem with the study of the fourteenth-century Ottomans is the lack of surviving documentation from that time period. Not a single Ottoman authentic written document has been found from the time of [[Osman I]], the first Ottoman ruler.&lt;ref name="Kafadar" /&gt; Historians are thus forced to rely upon sources produced long after the events they purport to describe. Ottoman studies have thus benefited from the techniques of [[literary criticism]], allowing historians to properly analyze Ottoman literary works from later periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State |date=1995 |page=xiii }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ghaza thesis came under attack from numerous scholars beginning in the 1980s.{{refn|group=nb|Such early critics included G. Káldy-Nagy, R. C. Jennings, Colin Heywood, Colin Imber, Şinasi Tekin, and Feridun Emecen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State |date=1995 |page=166n56 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Critics drew attention to the fact that the early Ottomans acted in ways contrary to what one would expect from zealous religious warriors. They were not strictly orthodox Muslims, but rather tolerated many heterodox and [[syncretic]] beliefs and practices. They also willingly recruited Byzantines into their ranks and fought wars against other Muslims. Thus rather than describing reality, later Ottoman writers who characterized their ancestors as ghazis were "adorning [them] with higher ideals," when in fact their original motivations had been much more mundane. For Ottomans writing in the fifteenth century, presenting the earlier Ottoman rulers as ghazis served their political objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State |date=1995 |page=11–2, 49–51 |quote=The main thrust of the critique was to underline certain actions of the early Ottomans that were now deemed contradictory to the spirit of holy war and to argue therefore that they cannot have been motivated by the ghazi ethos. [...] Rather, the critics of the ghaza thesis argue, what once were plain political and/or material motives were adorned with higher ideals in later sources written by ideologues serving the Ottoman dynasty (p. 49-50). }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lowry |first=Heath |title=The Nature of the Early Ottoman State |publisher=SUNY Press |date=2003 |page=9–11 |quote=In 1984, Pal Fodor, a Hungarian Turcologist, opened a fresh page in the debate with an important article in which he convincingly demonstrated that the ideas of ''ghaza'' and ''ghazi'' in the work of Ahmedi (Wittek's most important source), were a literary device, whereby "Ahmedi presents the Ottoman rulers as ''ghazis'' in a manner that served well-definable political objectives."}}&lt;/ref&gt; In emphasizing the mythical and legendary quality of the stories presented by Ottoman writers, the historian Colin Imber has even gone so far as to declare the entire period a "black hole," the truth about which can never truly be known.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Imber |first=Colin |editor=Elizabeth Zachariadou |title=The Ottoman Emirate (1300–1389) |chapter=The Legend of Osman Gazi |page=75 |date=1991 |publisher=Crete University Press |place=Rethymnon |quote=Almost all the traditional tales about Osman Ghazi are fictitious. The best thing a modern historian can do is to admit frankly that the earliest history of the Ottomans is a black hole. Any attempt to fill this hole will result simply in more fables. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Ottomans as a tribal group===

While many scholars criticized the Ghaza thesis, few sought an alternative to replace it. Rudi Paul Lindner was the first to try in his 1983 publication ''Nomads and Ottomans in Medieval Anatolia'', in which he argued that the peculiarities of early Ottoman activity could best be explained through tribalism. Lindner saw tribalism through the lens of [[anthropology]], which views tribes as organizations based not on shared bloodlines, but on shared political interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lindner |first=Rudi P. |title=Nomads and Ottomans in Medieval Anatolia |publisher=Indiana University Press |place=Bloomington |date=1983 |pages=vii–viii }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early Ottoman raids against the Byzantines were motivated not by religious zeal, but by the nomadic tribe's need to engage in predation against settled society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lindner |first=Rudi P. |title=Nomads and Ottomans in Medieval Anatolia |publisher=Indiana University Press |place=Bloomington |date=1983 |pages=23–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottomans were able to incorporate Byzantines and fight against Muslims because their organization was fundamentally tribal, which allowed them to assimilate individuals and groups of diverse backgrounds. Citing various instances of their heterodoxy, Lindner even suggested that the early Ottomans may have been more Pagan than Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lindner |first=Rudi P. |title=Nomads and Ottomans in Medieval Anatolia |publisher=Indiana University Press |place=Bloomington |date=1983 |pages=6–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Lindner's view, this tribal inclusiveness began to break down during the reign of Osman's son [[Orhan]] (r. 1323/4-1362), as the Ottomans began to shift from being nomadic pastoralists into settled agricultural society. Orhan subsequently attracted Islamic scholars to his realm, who brought with them ideas about ''ghaza'', and it was from them that he adopted the ''ghaza'' ideology in time for it to appear in his 1337 inscription in Bursa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lindner |first=Rudi P. |title=Nomads and Ottomans in Medieval Anatolia |publisher=Indiana University Press |place=Bloomington |date=1983 |pages=29–37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ghaza as one of many factors===
In his 1995 book ''Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State'', Turkish scholar [[Cemal Kafadar]] addressed criticism of the Ghaza thesis by arguing that previous scholars had drawn too great a distinction between "orthodox" and "heterodox" Islam – one could consider oneself a legitimate Muslim without conforming exactly to a scholarly orthodoxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State |date=1995 |page=50–3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Kafadar argued that the early Ottomans' very idea of ''ghaza'' may have differed from that of "orthodox" Islam. Citing contemporary Anatolian legends, he noted that the same figure could be portrayed as a ''ghazi'' while still cooperating with Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State |date=1995 |page=70–5 |quote=My intention here is not to provide more evidence of cooperation between Anatolian Muslim warriors and Byzantines, the prevalence of which is beyond doubt. The point is rather to show that the literature produced by or among the ghazis to glorify their deeds did not find it contradictory to present their ghazi protagonists in cooperation with Christians.  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Kafadar's view, ''ghaza'' was a real ideology which gave shape to frontier warriors as a social class, not simply an import from Muslim scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State |date=1995 |page=109–113 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the terms ''ghaza'' and ''ghazi'' had a range of different meanings which shifted over time, sometimes referring to religiously motivated warriors and sometimes not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State |date=1995 |page=91 |quote=It would thus seem inappropriate to conceptualize ghaza by assuming, like Wittek and his critics, that it was one and the same notion of "war for the faith" from its earliest emergence to the end of the empire. Another way of looking at it would be to observe that the concept of ghaza underwent transformation in Ottoman thought.  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was nevertheless ever present, and served as simply one out of many motivating forces behind Ottoman expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State |date=1995 |page=120 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ghaza as a non-religious term===
Following Kafadar, the next major reformulation of the theory of Ottoman origins was carried out by [[Heath Lowry]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |last=Imber |first=Colin |title=Review of Heath Lowry's ''The Nature of the Early Ottoman State'' |journal=The Turkish Studies Association Journal |volume=27 |date=2003 |page=108 |quote=Heath Lowry's ''The Nature of the Early Ottoman State'' is the latest in a series of works that have appeared since the 1920s, attempting to explain the origins of the Ottoman Empire and its subsequent rise to power.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lowry attacked Wittek's sources, arguing that Ahmedi's literary work cannot be interpreted as factual history, but rather was a fictionalized idealization of the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lowry |first=Heath |title=The Nature of the Early Ottoman State |publisher=SUNY Press |place=Albany |date=2003 |pages=15–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lowry, the terms ''ghaza'' and ''ghazi'' when used in the fourteenth and fifteenth-century Ottoman context had entirely non-religious meanings, as ''ghaza'' was interchangeable with the term ''akın'', simply referring to a military raid. Many ''[[akıncı]]s'' (raiders) were also Christians, and would thus be very out of place in an army devoted to Islamic holy war. Ottoman warriors were thus motivated by the desire to win plunder and slaves, not to fight in the name of Islam. It was only certain writers, educated in the Islamic tradition, who tried to draw a connection between the secular ''ghaza'' of the frontier warriors and the religious ''ghaza'' as understood by Muslim intellectuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lowry |first=Heath |title=The Nature of the Early Ottoman State |publisher=SUNY Press |place=Albany |date=2003 |pages=45–7, 51–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New consensus==

While they differ in many particulars, these new perspectives on early Ottoman history share in the belief that early Ottoman expansion was not primarily fueled by an ideology of Islamic holy war. Historians now generally regard ''ghaza'' as having been "a much more fluid undertaking, sometimes referring to actions that were nothing more than raids, sometimes meaning a deliberate holy war, but most often combining a mixture of these elements."&lt;ref name=ghaza&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ágoston |first=Gábor |editor-last=Ágoston |editor-first=Gábor |editor2=Bruce Masters |title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire |chapter=Ghaza (gaza) |date=2009 |page=231 |quote=The early Ottoman military activity described as ''ghaza'' is now thought to have been a much more fluid undertaking, sometimes referring to actions that were nothing more than raids, sometimes meaning a deliberate holy war, but most often combining a mixture of these elements. }}&lt;/ref&gt; This view also appears in Caroline Finkel's 2005 scholarly survey of Ottoman history, ''Osman's Dream''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Finkel |first=Caroline |title=Osman's Dream: The Story of the Ottoman Empire, 1300–1923 |page=10 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-465-02396-7|date=2006-02-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

Aurispa was born at [[Noto]] in [[Sicily]] in 1376.  A scholarship from the [[King of Sicily]] enabled him to study at [[Bologna]] from 1404-1410.  Soon after, in 1413-4, he went out to Greece as a private tutor for the sons of a [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] merchant, Racanelli, and settled on the island of [[Chios]].  Here he learned Greek, and began to collect books, including a Sophocles and a Euripides.&lt;ref name=BCQ /&gt; He also obtained a number of Greek texts, including a work by [[Thucydides]] which he later sold to [[Niccolo Niccoli]] in 1417.&lt;ref name=CLS&gt;{{cite book|first=Charles L.|last= Stinger|title=Humanism and the Church Fathers: Ambrogio Traversari (1386-1439 and the Revival of Patristic Theology in the Early Italian Renaissance)|publisher=State Univ of New York Press|place=Albany, New York|year=1977|pages=36–37|isbn=978-0873953047}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Italy in 1414, setting in [[Savona]], where he supported himself by teaching Greek and by selling the works he had collected in Greece.&lt;ref name=EI /&gt;

In 1418, Aurispa visited [[Constantinople]], where he remained for some years, perfecting his knowledge of [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and searching for manuscripts. He worked so hard at this that he later wrote that he had been denounced to the Byzantine emperor for buying all the sacred books in the city. Upon his return from that trip he went to [[Florence]] where he entered the service of the [[papal court]], which was then in residence in that city. He moved to [[Rome]] the following year when the court transferred there. It was there that he taught one of his most famous students, [[Lorenzo Valla]], later himself a noted classical scholar.&lt;ref name=EI /&gt;

In 1421 Aurispa was sent by [[Pope Martin V]] to act as the translator for the [[Marquis]] [[Gianfrancesco Gonzaga]] on a diplomatic mission to the Byzantine emperor, [[Manuel Paleologos]]. After their arrival, he gained the favor of the emperor's son and successor, [[John VIII Palaiologos]], who took him on as his own secretary. Two years later, he accompanied his Byzantine employer on a mission to the courts of Europe. He traveled with this mission as far as [[Venice]], where he left the imperial service.&lt;ref name=EI /&gt;

On 15 December 1423 Aurispa arrived in Venice, with the largest and finest collection of Greek texts to reach the west prior to those brought by [[Bessarion]].  In reply to a letter from the [[Camaldolese]] [[prior]] and scholar, [[St. Ambrose Traversari]], he says that he brought back 238 manuscripts.  These contained all of [[Plato]], all of [[Plotinus]], all of Proclus, much of [[Iamblichus]], many of the Greek poets, including [[Pindar]], and a great deal of Greek history, including volumes of [[Procopius]] and [[Xenophon]] which had been  given to him by the emperor.&lt;ref name=CLS /&gt;  Also the poems of [[Callimachus]] and [[Oppian]], and the Orphic verses; the historical works of [[Dio Cassius]], [[Diodorus Siculus]], and [[Arrian]].  Most of the works were hitherto unknown in the West.&lt;ref name=BD&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Il8MAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA211&amp;dq=aurispa&amp;ei=W-9KSKaTH5SCjwGe14jlDQ|title=The Biographical Dictionary of the Society for the Diffusion of useful Knowledge|volume=Vol. 4|publisher=Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans|place=London|year=1844|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further items included the oldest manuscript of [[Athenaeus Mechanicus|Athenaeus]]; a 10th-century codex containing 7 plays by [[Sophocles]], 6 by [[Aeschylus]]—the only manuscript in the world of these, plus the ''[[Argonautica]]'' of [[Apollonius of Rhodes]];&lt;ref&gt;This is the famous manuscript Laurentianus 32.9.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Iliad]]'', works by [[Demosthenes]], and many more.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Giovanni Aurispa}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A work by [[Herodotus]] was also among the collection; also the ''Geography'' of [[Strabo]].  The texts are all listed in the letter to Traversari.&lt;ref&gt;William Roscoe, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NvQFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=aurispa&amp;lr=&amp;ei=ZfdKSK20F6PujAGZxdzmDQ#PPA31,M1 The Life of Lorenzo De'Medici, Called the Magnificent], p.31; ''Epistulis Amb. Trav.'' lib. xxiv, Ep. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

The only [[patristic]] text Aurispa had brought from Greece was a volume containing about 200 letters of St. [[Gregory Nazianzen]]. In a letter to Traversari, he explained:

:I have not brought any sacred volumes from Greece except the letters of Gregory, which are, I believe, 200.  This book is in faultless condition, and all the pages can be read, but its beauty is hardly such as to invite the reluctant reader.  Long ago I sent from Constantinople to Sicily a good number of very choice sacred volumes, for I admit frankly that they were less precious to me, and a number of malicious persons often brought charges to the Greek emperor, accusing me of pillaging the city of sacred books.  With regard to the heathen books, it seemed to them not such a great crime.&lt;ref name=CLS /&gt;

Back in Venice, Aurispa is said to have been obliged to pawn his treasures for 50 gold [[florin]]s to provide for the shipping costs.  Traversari wrote to [[Lorenzo de' Medici]] on his behalf, who made a loan to Aurispa to redeem the manuscripts.  Traversari also arranged to exchange Niccolo's transcriptions of newly discovered texts by [[Cicero]] for Aurispa's transcriptions of [[Aristotle]]'s ''Rhetoric'' and ''Eudemian ethics''.

In 1424 Aurispa went to Bologna, where he became professor of Greek at the university. But this was not a success.  At the urging of Traversari, from 1425 to 1427 he held the prestigious Chair of Greek studies in [[Florence]].  This ensured that his collection was copied widely among the humanists.

Quarrels at Florence led Aurispa to leave Florence in late 1427 or early 1428 and to move to [[Ferrara]], where, on the recommendation of his friend, the scholar [[Guarino da Verona|Guarino of Verona]], he was appointed tutor to [[:it:Meliaduse d'Este|Meliaduse d'Este]], the illegitimate son of [[Niccolò III d'Este, Marquis of Ferrara]].&lt;ref name=EI /&gt;  He taught the classics there, took [[Holy Orders]] and obtained preferment in the Church.  King [[Alfonso V of Aragon|Alfonso of Naples]], asked him through his friend [[Panormita]] to move there, but he declined.&lt;ref name=BD /&gt;

By 1430 Aurispa had managed to recover a bundle of his manuscripts from Sicily.  These included a volume of lives of the saints, including one of St. [[Gregory Nazianzen]], as well as one of the [[sermon]]s of St. [[John Chrysostom]], a [[Psalter]], a volume of the [[Gospel]]s, and the comedies of [[Aristophanes]].  The remainder of his manuscripts seem to have never been returned to him.&lt;ref name=CLS /&gt; In 1433 he accompanied his student Meliaduse to the [[Council of Basel]], taking a lengthy journey along the [[Rhine]], visiting [[Mainz]], [[Cologne]] and [[Aachen]], in the course of which he discovered new [[Latin language|Latin]] [[codices]].&lt;ref name=EI /&gt;

In 1438, when the Council was transferred to Ferrara, Aurispa attracted the attention of [[Pope Eugene IV]], who appointed him an Apostolic Secretary, and so he moved to [[Rome]]. He held a similar position under [[Pope Nicholas V]], who bestowed two lucrative [[commendatory abbot|commendatory abbacies]] on him.

Aurispa returned to Ferrara in 1450 and died there in 1459, at the age of 83.

Considering his long life and reputation, Aurispa produced little: [[Latin]] translations of the commentary of [[Hierocles of Alexandria|Hierocles]] on the [[golden verses of Pythagoras]] (1474) and of ''Philisci Consolatoria ad Ciceronem'' from [[Dio Cassius]] (not published till 1510) ; and, according to [[Johann Matthias Gesner|Gesner]], a translation of the works of [[Archimedes]].&lt;ref name="eb1911" /&gt;

Aurispa's reputation rests upon the extensive collection of manuscripts copied and distributed by him, and his persistent efforts to revive and promote the study of ancient literature.&lt;ref name="eb1911"&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Aurispa, Giovanni |volume=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hard-paste porcelain''' is a [[ceramic]] material that was originally made from a compound of the [[feldspathic]] rock [[petuntse]] and [[kaolin]] fired at very high temperature, usually around 1400 °C. It was first made in [[China]] around the 7th or 8th century, and has remained the most common type of [[Chinese porcelain]].&lt;ref name=Fleming&gt;[[John Fleming (art historian)|Fleming, John]] &amp; [[Hugh Honour]]. (1977) ''The Penguin Dictionary of Decorative Arts. '' London: [[Allen Lane]], p. 622. {{ISBN|0713909412}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

From the Middle Ages onwards it was very widely exported and admired by other cultures, and fetched huge prices on foreign markets.  Eventually [[Korean porcelain]] developed in the 14th century and [[Japanese porcelain]] in the 17th, but other cultures were unable to learn or reproduce the secret of its formula in terms of materials and firing temperature until it was worked out in Europe in the early 18th century, and suitable mineral deposits of [[kaolin]], [[feldspar]] and [[quartz]] discovered.  This soon led to a large production in factories across Europe by the end of the 18th century. 

Despite the huge influence of Chinese [[porcelain]] decoration on [[Islamic pottery]], historic production was all in [[earthenware]] or [[fritware]], the latter having some of the properties of hard-paste porcelain. Europeans also developed [[soft-paste porcelain]], fired at lower temperatures (around 1200 °C), while trying to copy the Chinese, and later [[bone china]] which in modern times has somewhat replaced hard-paste across the world.

==History==
Chinese porcelain began to be exported to Europe by the Portuguese and later by the Dutch from the middle of the 16th century, creating vast demand for the material. The discovery in Europe of the secret of its manufacture has conventionally been credited to [[Johann Friedrich Böttger]] of [[Meissen|Meissen, Germany]] in 1708,&lt;ref&gt;Hildyard, Robin. (1999) ''European Ceramics''. London: V&amp;A Publications, p.46. {{ISBN|1851772596}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it has also been claimed that English manufacturers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/15814776?story_id=15814776 Pots of fame] economist.com, 31 March 2010.

Queiroz &amp; S. Agathopoulos, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly, the [[Meissen porcelain]] factory, established 1710, was the first to produce porcelain in Europe in large quantities and since the recipe was kept a trade secret by Böttger for his company, experiments continued elsewhere throughout Europe.

[[File:Lettre du pere Entrecolles 1712 du Halde 1735.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1|Section of the letter of [[François Xavier d'Entrecolles]] about Chinese porcelain manufacturing techniques, 1712, published by [[Jean-Baptiste du Halde]] in 1735.]]

[[File:Nicolas-Christiern Milly 1771 L'art de la porcelain title.jpg | thumb | right | Comte de Milly's ''L'art de la porcelaine'', 1771.]]

In 1712, the French [[Jesuit]] [[François Xavier d'Entrecolles]] described the Chinese process of manufacturing porcelain in his letters to Europe. In 1771, the comte de Milly published ''L'art de la porcelaine'', a detailed account of the processes of creating hard-paste porcelain, ending its prestige as a rare and valuable material.&lt;ref name=Coutts&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coutts|first1=Howard|title=The art of ceramics : European ceramic design 1500-1830|date=2001|publisher=Yale Univ. Press|location=New Haven, Conn.|isbn=9780300083873|page=194|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fRfIfV3Eq_sC&amp;pg=PA194|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hard-paste now chiefly refers to formulations prepared from mixtures of [[kaolin]], [[feldspar]] and [[quartz]]. Other raw materials can also be used and these include pottery stones, which historically were known as [[petunse]] although this name has long fallen out of use.&lt;ref&gt;‘Chinese Porcelain’. N.Wood. ''Pottery Q''. 12, (47), 101, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Hard-paste porcelain is now differentiated from [[soft-paste]] porcelain mainly by the firing temperature, with the former being higher, to around 1400°C, and the latter to around 1200°C.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, F. and Singer, S.S., ''Industrial Ceramics'' (Chapman Hall, 1963).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rado, Paul, ''An Introduction To The Technology Of Pottery'' (Pergamon Press, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the raw materials and firing methods used, hard-paste porcelain can also resemble [[stoneware]] or [[earthenware]]. Hard-paste porcelain can also be used for unglazed [[biscuit porcelain]]. It is a translucent and bright, white ceramic.  Hard-paste has the advantage over soft-paste that it is less likely to crack when exposed to hot liquids, but the higher firing temperature of hard-paste may necessitate a second "glost" firing for the decoration.

'''[[Arabic language|Arabic]]''' has had a great influence on other languages, especially in [[vocabulary]]. The influence of Arabic has been most profound in those countries dominated by [[Islam]] or [[Islamic state|Islamic power]]. Arabic is a major source of vocabulary for languages as diverse as [[Amharic language|Amharic]], [[Baluchi language|Baluchi]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Berber languages|Berber]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic|Chaldean]], [[Chechen language|Chechen]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Dagestani language|Dagestani]], [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Hausa language|Hausa]],
[[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], 
[[Hindi]],
[[Kazakh language|Kazakh]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Kutchi Language|Kutchi]], [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]], [[Malay language|Malay]] ([[Malaysian language|Malaysian]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]), [[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Rohingya language|Rohingya]], [[Romance languages]] ([[French language|French]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], etc.) [[Saraiki language|Saraiki]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], [[Somali language|Somali]], [[Sylheti language|Sylheti]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]], [[Urdu]], [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]], [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]], [[Visayan languages|Visayan]] and [[Wolof language|Wolof]] as well as other languages in countries where these languages are spoken. For example, the [[Kitab|Arabic word for ''book'']] (كتاب ''kitāb'') is used in most of the languages listed. Other languages such as [[Maltese language|Maltese]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9050379/Maltese-language Maltese language - Britannica Online Encyclopedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nubi]] derive from Arabic, rather than merely borrowing vocabulary. [[Spanish language|Spanish]] has the largest Arabic influenced vocabulary outside the Islamic world due to Muslim rule in the Iberian Peninsula from 711 until 1492 known as [[Al-Andalus]], although Spain's re-christianization and resulting loss of contact with Quranic Arabic has led to a significant shift in both meaning and pronunciation of Spanish words of Arabic etymology.

The terms borrowed range from religious terminology (like Berber ''taẓallit'' "prayer" &lt; [[salat]]), academic terms (like [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] ''mentiq'' "logic"), to everyday conjunctions (like Urdu/Hindi/Punjabi ''lekin'' "but".) Most Berber varieties (such as [[Kabyle language|Kabyle]]), along with Swahili, borrow some numbers from Arabic. Most religious terms used by Muslims around the world are direct borrowings from Arabic, such as ''ṣalāt'' 'prayer' and ''imām'' 'prayer leader'.  In languages not directly in contact with the Arab world, Arabic loanwords are often mediated by other languages rather than being transferred directly from Arabic; for example many older Arabic loanwords in [[Hausa language|Hausa]] were borrowed from [[Kanuri language|Kanuri]].

Outside the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]], there are more limited borrowings from Arabic, usually to denote vegetables and other articles in commerce, such as "aubergine", "alcohol" and also some other terms like "admiral". Among European languages, these mostly were transmitted through [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

==English==
{{main article|List of English words of Arabic origin}}

Like other European languages, [[English language|English]] contains many words derived from Arabic, often through other European languages, especially [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. Among them is every-day vocabulary like "[[sugar]]" (''sukkar''), "[[cotton]]" (''quṭn'') or "magazine" (''[[makhzen|{{transl|ar|DIN|maḫāzin}}]]''). More recognizable are words like "[[algebra]]" (''al-jabr''), "[[alcohol]]" (''al-kuhūl''), "[[alchemy]]" ("al-kimiya"), "[[alkali]]", "[[cipher|cypher]]" and "[[zenith]]" (see [[list of English words of Arabic origin]]).

A more indirect form of influence is the use of certain Latinate words in an unclassical sense, derived from their use in Latin translations of medieval Arabic philosophical works (e.g. those of [[Averroes]]), which entered the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] vocabulary and later came into normal use in modern languages.  Examples are "information" to mean the imparting or acquisition of knowledge (Arabic ''taṣawwur'', mental impression or representation, from a root meaning "form") and "intention" (Arabic ''ma&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;nā'', meaning).  These words may almost be regarded as [[calque]]s.

==French==
{{main article|List of French words of Arabic origin}}

French is widely spoken as a second language in France's former colonies in the Maghreb. Therefore, the list of words that are used or incorporated into the French spoken in this region (as a result of code-switching, convenience or lack of an equivalent term in standard French) is potentially endless. Such arabisms, are accepted within the local context but would not normally be known by non-maghrebi French speakers.

Arabic-derived words have entered standard or metropolitan [[French language|French]] from two main sources. As is the case for many other European languages, one principal source was Spanish. The other was directly from Maghrebi Arabic as a result of the occupation and colonisation of the Maghreb, particularly Algeria, in the 19th and 20th centuries. Examples of the latter include 'bled', a slang term for place of origin, following this word's usage in the Maghreb, as opposed to the Standard Arabic ''balad'', 'country', along with the Maghrebi term 'kif kif' and 'tabeeb', a slang term for 'doctor'. A small number of Arabic terms have entered mainstream French as a result of immigration from North Africa which began after the independence of Algeria. Other slang terms such as "niquer" (to have sex) were taken from Oriental Arabic during Napoleon's occupation of Egypt.

==Interlingua==
Dozens of Arabic words occur in [[Interlingua]], frequently because their co-occurrence in such languages as English, French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese can be used to [[Interlingua and eligibility of international words|verify their internationality]]. Many of these words entered Interlingua's vocabulary through Spanish. Arabic words in Interlingua include "algebra", "alcohol", "cifra" (cypher), "magazin", "sucro" (sugar), "zenit", and "zero".

==Indonesian==
In [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], the loanwords from Arabic are mainly concerned with religion, in particular with Islam, but to a lesser extent Christianity. Words of Arabic origin include ''dunia'' (from Arabic: دنيا dunya = the present world), ''Sabtu'' (from Arabic: السبت as-sabt = Saturday), ''kabar'' (خبر ḵabar = news), ''selamat''/''salam'' (سلام salām = a greeting), ''Jum'at'' (الجمعة al-jumʿa = Friday), ''ijazah'' (إجازة ijāza = vacation), ''kitab'' (كتاب kitāb = book), ''tertib'' (ترتيب tartīb = orderly) and ''kamus'' (قاموس qāmūs = dictionary).

===Christian usage===
Allah (Arabic: الله), as it is mostly the case for Arabic speakers, is the word for God even in Christian Bible translations.

Many early Bible translators, when they came across some unusual Hebrew words or proper names, used the Arabic cognates. In the newer translations this practice is discontinued. They now turn to Greek names or use the original Hebrew Word. For example, the name Jesus was initially translated as 'Isa (Arabic: عيسى), but is now spelt as Yesus. Several ecclesiastical terms derived from Arabic still exist in Indonesian language.

The Indonesian word for bishop is ''uskup'' (from Arabic: اسقف usquf = bishop, ultimately from Ancient Greek ''episkopos''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.etymonline.com/word/bishop&lt;/ref&gt;). This in turn makes the Indonesian term for archbishop ''uskup agung'' (literally great bishop), which is combining the Arabic word with an Old Javanese word. The term imam (from Arabic: امام imām = leader, prayer leader) is used to translate a Catholic priest, beside its more common association with an Islamic prayer leader. Some Protestant denominations refer to their congregation as ''jemaat'' (from Arabic: جماعة jamā'a = group, community). Even the name of the Bible in Indonesian translation is ''Alkitab'' (from Arabic: كتاب kitāb = book), which literally means "the Book".

==Javanese==
There are far fewer Arabic loanwords in [[Javanese language|Javanese]] than Sanskrit loanwords, and they are usually concerned with Islamic religion. Nevertheless, some words have entered the basic vocabulary, such as ''pikir'' ("to think", from the Arabic fikr), ''badan'' ("body"), ''mripat'' ("eye", thought to be derived from the Arabic ''ma'rifah'', meaning "knowledge" or "vision"). However, these Arabic words typically have native Austronesian or Sanskrit alternatives: ''pikir'' = ''galih'', ''idhĕp'' ([[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]]) and ''manah'', ''cipta'', or ''cita'' (from [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]); ''badan'' = ''awak'' (Austronesian) and ''slira'', ''sarira'', or ''angga'' (from Sanskrit); and ''mripat'' = ''mata'' (Austronesian) and ''soca'' or ''netra'' (from Sanskrit).

==Portuguese==
{{main article|List of Portuguese words of Arabic origin}}

Between the 9th century and up to 1249&lt;ref&gt;http://ler.letras.up.pt/uploads/ficheiros/6410.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; when the Arabs were expelled from the [[Algarve]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] acquired hundreds of words (between 400 and 600 estimate&lt;ref&gt;https://www.infopedia.pt/$influencia-arabe-na-evolucao-da-lingua&lt;/ref&gt;) from Arabic by influence of [[al-Andalus|Moorish Iberia]]. Although the native population spoke the Lusitanian-[[Mozarabic language|Mozarabic]], they kept some Mozarabic-derived words. These are often recognizable by the initial Arabic article ''a''(''l'')''-'', and include common words such as ''aldeia'' "village" from {{lang|ar|الضيعة}} ''aḍ-ḍī&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;ah'', ''alface'' "lettuce" from {{lang|ar|الخس}} ''al-khass'', ''armazém'' "warehouse" from {{lang|ar|المخزن}} ''al-makhzan'', and ''azeite'' "olive oil" from {{lang|ar|الزيت}} ''az-zayt''. From Arabic came also the grammatically peculiar word [[Insha'Allah|''oxalá'']] "God willing". The frequency of Arabic toponyms increases as one travels south in the country.

==Sicilian==
{{see also|Sicilian language}}

In AD 535, Emperor [[Justinian I]] made Sicily a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] province, and for the second time in Sicilian history, the [[Greek language]] became a familiar sound across the island ([[#refHull1989|Hull, 1989]]).  As the power of the Byzantine Empire waned, [[Emirate of Sicily|Sicily was progressively conquered]] by [[Muslim]]s from [[North Africa]], from the mid 9th to mid 10th centuries. The [[Arabic language]] influence is noticeable in around 800 Sicilian words, many of which relate to agriculture and related activities ([[#refHull1989|Hull]] and [[#refRuffino2001|Ruffino]]).  

Sicilian words of Arabic origin include ''azzizzari'' (to embellish, from ''&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;azīz''; precious, beautiful), ''cafisu'' (measure for liquids, from ''qafiz''), ''gèbbia'' (artificial pond, from ''gabiya''), ''giuggiulena'' (sesame seed, from ''giulgiulan'', ''ràisi'' (leader, from ''ra'īs''), ''saia'' (canal, from ''saqiya''), and ''zibbibbu'' (a type of grape, from ''zabib''). ([[#refGiarrizzo1989|Giarrizzo]])

==Spanish==
{{main article|Arabic influence on the Spanish language}}

The [[Spanish language]] has been influenced by [[Arabic language|Arabic]] as a result of the long [[Timeline of the Muslim presence in the Iberian Peninsula|Islamic presence within the Iberian Peninsula]], beginning with the Islamic conquest in 711-718 AD until the conquest of the last Islamic Kingdom in 1492 AD. Modern day Spanish, also called Castilian, gradually evolved from [[Vulgar Latin]] centuries after the Muslim conquest and was thus influenced by Arabic from its inception. Arabic influence increased when the expanding [[Kingdom of Castile]] spread southward, conquering territory from Muslim kingdoms during the Christian [[Reconquista]]. The [[Mozarab]]s, that had lived under Muslim rulers and had spoken their own varieties of Arabic-influenced romance (known today by scholars as the [[Mozarabic]] languages), probably had a formative influence on the language and indirectly contributed Arabic vocabulary. 
The presence of Mozarabic refugees can explain the presence of Arabic toponyms in areas of Northern Spain where Islamic rule was shorter.
The only Iberian Muslim kingdom in which Arabic was the sole language at all levels of society was the [[Kingdom of Granada]] in the time of the [[Nasrid dynasty]].

In many cases, both Arabic and Latin derived words are used interchangeably by Spanish speakers. For example, ''aceituna'' and ''oliva'' (olive), ''alacrán'' and ''escorpión'' (scorpion), ''jaqueca'' and ''migraña'' (headache) or ''alcancía'' and ''hucha'' (piggy bank). The influence of Arabic, whether directly or through Mozarabic, is more noticeable in the Spanish dialects of southern Spain, where the Arabic influence was heavier and of a much longer duration. The same difference also exists between [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and Valencian and in some cases, between Galician and Portuguese.

The Arabic influence can be seen in hundreds of [[toponym]]s but with a few minor exceptions, its influence on Spanish is primarily lexical. It is estimated that there are over two thousand Arabic loanwords and three thousand derivatives in the Spanish dictionary, making it 8% of the Spanish language. In the Middle Ages, Spanish was the main route by which Arabic words entered other West European languages. The majority of these words are nouns, with a more limited number of [[verb]]s, [[adjective]]s, [[adverb]]s and one [[preposition]]. Everyday Arabic loanwords include ''rincón'' (corner, from ''rukkan''), ''aceite'' (oil, from ''az-zayt''), and ''alcalde'' (mayor, from ''al-qādī''), ''ahorrar'' (to save, from ''hurr''), tarea (task, from ''tariha'')  and ''hasta'' (until, from ''hatta'').

==Turkish==
{{see also|List of replaced loanwords in Turkish}}

Following the adoption of [[Islam]] c. 950 by the [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]] and the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq Turks]], regarded as the cultural ancestors of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], the administrative and literary languages of these states acquired a large collection of loanwords from Arabic (usually by way of Persian), as well as non-Arabic [[Persian language|Persian]] words: a leading example of a Perso-Arabic influenced Turkic language was [[Chagatai language|Chagatai]], which remained the literary language of Central Asia until Soviet times. During the course of over six hundred years of the [[Ottoman Empire]] (c. 1299–1922), the literary and official language of the empire was a mixture of Turkish, Persian and Arabic, which differed considerably from the everyday spoken Turkish of the time, and is termed [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]].

After the foundation of the [[Republic of Turkey]], and following the [[Turkish language#Writing system|script reform]], the [[Turkish Language Association]] (TDK) was established under the patronage of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] in 1932, with the aim of conducting research on Turkish. One of the tasks of the newly established association was to initiate a [[language reform]] to [[List of replaced loanwords in Turkish|replace loanwords of Arabic and Persian origin]] with Turkish equivalents.&lt;ref&gt;See Lewis (2002) for a thorough treatment of the Turkish language reform.&lt;/ref&gt;  By banning the usage of replaced loanwords in the press, the association succeeded in removing several hundred foreign words from the language, thus diminishing but by no means erasing the Arabic influence on Turkish.

==Valencian Catalan==
{{see also|Catalan language|Valencian}}
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}
Arabic has notably influenced the [[Valencian]] variety of the [[Catalan language]] spoken in Spain south of Catalonia, more than Catalonia itself although it also left influences in Catalan. Due to more than 8 centuries of Arabic dominion in the Iberian Peninsula ([[Al-Andalus]]), hundreds of words from many fields (including Arabic inventions) have been adapted into Catalan; among many are ''séquia'' ("irrigation ditch"), ''nòria'' ("whaterwheel, [[noria]]"), ''algorfa'' ("loft"), ''magatzem'' ("warehouse"), ''alfàbia'' ("earthenware jar"), ''barnús'' ("bathrobe"), ''aladroc'' ("anchovy"), ''dacsa'' ("corn"), ''safanòria'' ("carrot"), ''carxofa'' ("artichoke"), ''albergínia'' ("aubergine"), ''xirivia'' ("parsnip"), ''alfals'' ("alfalfa"), ''albercoc'' ("apricot"), ''tramús'' ("lupin"), ''corfa'' ("bark, peel"), ''xara'' ("thicket"), ''matalaf/matalàs'' ("mattress"), ''alacrà'' ("scorpion"), ''fardatxo'' ("lizard") ''alfàb(r)ega'' ("basil"), etc. and expressions such as ''a la babalà'' ("randomly, to God's will") and ''a betzef'' ("abundance, plenty").

===Toponymy===
Most places of the [[Land of Valencia]] have retained their name in Arabic, such as [[Alicante|Alicante/Alacant]], [[Alzira, Valencia|Alzira]], [[Almassora]], etc. Also, a great number of places have the Arabic roots ''Beni'', ''Bena'' and ''Bene'', which mean "son of" or "sons of":
*[[Benidorm]], [[Benimuslem]], [[Benilloba]], [[Benillup]], [[Benimantell]], [[Benimarfull]], [[Benicàssim]], [[Benissa]], [[Benissoda]], [[Benirredrà]], [[Benaguasil]], [[Benasau]], [[Beneixama]], [[Benaixeve]], [[Beneixida]], [[Benetússer]], [[Beniflà]], [[Beniardà]], [[Beniarrés]], [[Beniatjar]], [[Benicarló]], [[Benicolet]], [[Benicull de Xúquer]], [[Benidoleig]], [[Benifaió]], [[Benifairó de la Valldigna]], [[Benifairó de les Valls]], [[Benifato]], [[Benigànim]], [[Benigembla]], [[Benimodo]], [[Benimassot]], [[Benimeli]], [[Beniparrell]], [[Benavites]], [[Benafigos]], [[El Poble Nou de Benitatxell/Benitachell|Benitatxell]], etc.

McNamara and on the struggle against political violence throughout the twentieth century. His work on the subject of rendition appeared in the May 2011 edition of The International Journal of Human Rights.

===The Clinton Presidency===
Following his 1995 meeting with President Bill Clinton, James D. Boys researched the first term of Clinton’s administration in an effort to explain the evolution and execution of American foreign policy during that period. His research brought him into contact with leading members of the administration, including [[Robert Reich]] (US Labour Secretary), [[Sidney Blumenthal]] (Assistant to the President), Al Gore (Vice President), [[Tony Lake]] (National Security Advisor), [[Nancy Soderberg]] (Ambassador to the UN) and [[Morton Halperin]] (Director of the Policy Planning Staff).

==Commentator==
Boys has written on a variety of subjects and has been published repeatedly on the Nth Position and the 49th Parallel.

[[File:Praha Staronova Synagoga.jpg|thumb|The old synagogue]]
'''Josefov''' (also '''Jewish Quarter'''; {{lang-de|Josefstadt}}) is a town quarter and the smallest [[cadastre|cadastral]] area of [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]], formerly the [[Jewish ghettos in Europe|Jewish ghetto]] of the town. It is completely surrounded by the [[Old Town, Prague|Old Town]]. The quarter is often represented by the flag of [[Jews of Prague|Prague's Jewish community]], a yellow Magen David ([[Star of David]]) on a red field.

==History==

Jews are believed to have settled in Prague as early as the 10th century. The first [[pogrom]] was in 1096 (the first crusade) and eventually they were concentrated within a walled [[Ghetto]]. In 1262, [[Otakar II of Bohemia|Přemysl Otakar II]] issued a ''Statuta Judaeorum'' which granted the community a degree of self-administration. In 1389, one of the worst [[pogrom]]s saw some 1,500 massacred at [[Easter Sunday]]. The [[ghetto]] was most prosperous towards the end of the 16th century when the Jewish Mayor, [[Mordecai Maisel]], became the Minister of Finance and a very wealthy man. His money helped develop the ghetto. 

In 1850, the quarter was renamed "Josefstadt" (Joseph's City) after [[Emperor Joseph II|Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]] who emancipated Jews with the [[Patent of toleration|Toleration Edict]] in 1781. Two years before Jews were allowed to settle outside of the city, so the share of the Jewish population in Josefov decreased, while only orthodox and poor Jews remained living there.

Most of the quarter was demolished between 1893 and 1913 as part of an initiative to model the city on [[Paris]]. What was left were only six synagogues, the old cemetery, and the Old Jewish Town Hall (now all part of the [[Jewish Museum in Prague]] and described below).

Currently Josefov is overbuilt with buildings from the beginning of the 20th century, so it is difficult to appreciate exactly what the old quarter was like when it was reputed to have over 18,000 inhabitants. Medieval Josefov is depicted in the 1920 film ''[[The Golem: How He Came Into the World|The Golem]]'', composed of cramped, angular, squinted buildings, but this impression is used purely to convey the [[German expressionism|expressionist]] nature of the film.

'''Joseph Stewart Fruton''' (May 14, 1912 – July 29, 2007), born '''Joseph Fruchtgarten''', was a Jewish Polish-American biochemist and historian of science.  His most significant scientific work involved [[synthetic peptide]]s and their interactions with [[protease]]s; with his wife [[Sofia Simmonds]] he also published an influential textbook, ''General Biochemistry'' (1953; 1958).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scs.uiuc.edu/~mainzv/HIST/awards/Dexter%20Papers/FrutonDexterBioJJB%20Bio.pdf Joseph S. Fruton (1912–], Division of History of Chemistry of the American Chemical Society, 2006.  Accessed April 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1970 until his death, Fruton worked extensively on the [[history of science]], particularly the [[history of biochemistry]] and [[history of molecular biology|molecular biology]].

==Childhood and education==

Joseph Fruchtgarten was born in [[Częstochowa]], [[Poland]]; his father Shama Nuta (Charles) Fruchtgarten was a grain merchant, and his mother Ella (Aisenstadt) Fruchtgarten was a French teacher.  Like many other [[Polish Jews]], the Fruchtgartens immigrated to the United States shortly before the outbreak of World War I.  They lived in New York City from 1913 to 1917, and in April 1917 they moved to [[Minsk]] (then occupied by the [[Red Army]] in the midst of the [[Russian Civil War]]).&lt;ref&gt;Fruton, ''Eighty Years'', pp. 8–12&lt;/ref&gt;    Between 1917 and 1923, Fruchtgarten attended school intermittently, moving from Minsk to [[Siedlce]] to [[Warsaw]] to [[Berlin]], and learning French, German and Latin (in addition to Polish and English).  In 1923, the Fruchtgartens returned to New York and changed their name to ''Fruton'' to avoid being targets of anti-Semitism.  Joseph Fruton followed his father in rejecting religion, but learned early on "not to advertise either [his] Jewishness or [his] atheism."&lt;ref&gt;Fruton, ''Eighty Years'', pp. 12–15; quotation from p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

After a few months at [[De Witt Clinton High School]], Fruton joined the first class of students at [[James Madison High School (New York)|James Madison High School]].  He graduated ''summa cum laude'' in 1927, excelling particularly in chemistry.  He applied to [[Columbia University]], and after an initial rejection—possibly because he was only 15 at the time, possibly because the school had already admitted the quota of New York Jews—his mother convinced an admissions official to reverse the decision.  Inspired by the character Max Gottlieb from the [[Sinclair Lewis]] novel [[Arrowsmith (novel)|Arrowsmith]], Fruton planned his Columbia education around becoming a scientist.  The lectures and lab-work of organic chemist [[John M. Nelson]] turned Fruton on to biochemistry.  He received his degree in chemistry in 1931, and entered graduate school in the Department of Biological Chemistry in the [[Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons]], working under [[Hans Thacher Clarke]].&lt;ref&gt;Fruton, ''Eighty Years'', pp. 16–23&lt;/ref&gt;  Fruton's PhD work focused on "the lability of cystine in alkali", although he developed a broad interest in the range of biochemistry-related research being pursued at the College of Physicians and Surgeons.&lt;ref&gt;Fruton, ''Eighty Years'', pp. 23–32; quotation from p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

During graduate school Fruton also became active politically, opposing fascism, militarism and anti-Semitism.  In 1933 he met Sophia "Topsy" Simmonds, whom he married in 1936.  Upon completing his PhD in May 1934, Fruton became a research assistant to [[Max Bergmann]] at the [[Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research]].&lt;ref&gt;Fruton, ''Eighty Years'', pp. 26, 32, 38&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research at the Rockefeller Institute==

Fruton was a researcher at the Rockefeller Institute from 1934 to 1945, part of Max Bergmann's long-term and very successful research program in protein chemistry.  In his earliest work there, Fruton tested the [[stereochemical]] specificity of [[dipeptidase]].  Under the tutelage of fellow Bergmann lab researcher [[Leonidas Zervas]], a pioneer in peptide synthesis, Fruton synthesized stereospecific dipeptides and other small peptides as enzyme substrates.  Fruton and his colleagues found significant instances of specificity in a range of proteases—observations that were relevant to the ongoing theoretical discussions of protein structure.  His most significant discovery at the Rockefeller Institute was a synthetic peptide substrate for [[pepsin]], contrary to the common idea that pepsin would not act on short synthetic peptides.  As a side project, he also worked on applications of Bergmann and Zervas's [[carbobenzoxy method]] of peptide synthesis and some of the associated side reactions.&lt;ref&gt;Fruton, ''Eighty Years'', pp. 38–54&lt;/ref&gt;

Between December 1941 and the end of World War II, research in Bergmann's lab shifted from basic protein chemistry to war-related research under the [[National Defense Research Committee]], part of the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]].  Fruton studied the chemistry of [[nitrogen mustards]].  In 1943, Fruton won the [[American Chemical Society]]'s  [[Eli Lilly Award]].&lt;ref&gt;Fruton, ''Eighty Years'', pp. 55–58&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biochemistry at Yale==

In 1945, after Max Bergmann's death, Fruton joined the [[Yale University]] Department of Physiological Chemistry (part of the medical school) —headed then by [[C. N. Hugh Long]]—where he taught biological chemistry to medical students.  Fruton joined a growing science faculty, which included the editor of the ''[[Journal of Biological Chemistry]]'', [[Rudolph Anderson]]; biochemist [[Edward Tatum]] also came to Yale at the same time.  In addition to research and teaching at Yale, in 1948 Fruton visited the laboratories of several eminent biochemists: [[Kaj Linderstrøm-Lang]]'s chemistry department at the [[Carlsberg Laboratory]]; [[Hugo Theorell]]'s lab in [[Stockholm]]; and [[Alexander R. Todd, Baron Todd|Alexander Todd]]'s lab at [[Cambridge University]].&lt;ref&gt;Fruton, ''Eighty Years'', pp. 92–112&lt;/ref&gt;  At the end of his five-year appointment as assistant professor, Fruton was promoted to full professor received a joint appointment in the Chemistry department—at the time, the only Jewish full professor in the medical school.&lt;ref&gt;Fruton, ''Eighty Years'', pp. 75–87&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1952, he was elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], and that year he also became chairman of the Department of Physiological Chemistry (which was renamed Biochemistry, reflecting the shift in research focus from medical to general biological problems).&lt;ref&gt;Fruton, ''Eighty Years'', pp. 114–122&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of Fruton's early research at Yale was funded by a grant from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]; [[Warren Weaver]] was making enzymology one of the Foundation's research focuses.  Fruton headed a growing lab that included doctoral students, postdoctoral researchers, and technical assistants.  The two main areas of research were the action of [[proteolytic enzyme]]s and the chemical (as opposed to biological) [[synthesis of peptides]] (the substrates used to explore the enzymatic reactions).  Members of Fruton's lab studied [[cathepsin C]] and several other peptidases, as well as proteinases that catalyzed [[wikt:transpeptidation|transpeptidation]], which was thought (and ultimately confirmed) to be part of the [[biosynthesis of proteins]].&lt;ref&gt;Fruton, ''Eighty Years'', pp. 89–92&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather than leading a team effort focused on a small number of high-priority problems, Fruton allowed members of his laboratory to choose their own problems (usually within the broad bounds of protein synthesis and proteinases).  Ph.D. students and postdoctoral researchers who worked in Fruton's lab include: [[Mary Ellen Jones (chemist)|Mary Ellen Jones]], [[Melvin Fried]], [[Hannelore Würz]], [[Peter Heinrich]], [[Karen Nilsson]], [[Bob Metrione]], [[Yoshihiro Okuda]], [[George Taborsky]], [[Christine Zioudrou]], [[Maxine Singer]], [[Louis Cohen]], [[Frederick Newth]], [[John Thanassi]], [[Charles Drey]], [[Derek George Smyth]], [[Atsuo Nagamatsu]], and [[Milton Winitz]].  A number of prominent biochemists from outside Yale also spent time in Fruton's biochemistry department during his tenure as chair, including: [[Harry Kroll]], [[Rosabelle McManus]], [[John Clark Lewis]], [[Herbert Gutfreund]], [[Max Gruber]], [[Frank Hird]], [[Vernon Ingram]], [[Hans Kornberg]], [[Dimitrios Theodoropoulos]], and [[Hans Tuppy]].&lt;ref&gt;Fruton, ''Eighty Years'', pp. 128–131&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, Fruton and Simmonds completed the textbook ''General Biochemistry'', which became one of the most influential textbooks for a generation of biochemistry students.  They produced a second edition in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Fruton, ''Eighty Years'', p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

===Administrative work===
In 1959, after offering advice to Yale president [[A. Whitney Griswold]] on strengthening the sciences at Yale, Fruton became Director of the Division of Science, a position he held until 1962.  His work led to the creation of the short-lived Department of Molecular Biology and Biophysics (MBB), although his initial proposal to create a similar department that combined the existing biophysics and biochemistry departments was rejected.  Fruton became burnt out on Yale politics after an extended conflict with provost [[Kingman Brewster]], in which Brewster attempted to bypass Fruton's science advisory committee and create a molecular biology department independent of biochemistry department; the MBB department was created only after Brewster had failed to attract a prominent scientist from outside Yale to head a molecular biology department, and the Department of Biochemistry remained separate as part of the medical school until the creation of the Department of Molecular Biophysics &amp; Biochemistry (MB&amp;B) in 1969 (which was itself created after a lengthy and unsuccessful attempt to find a suitably eminent replacement for Fruton to head the Department of Biochemistry).&lt;ref&gt;Fruton, ''Eighty Years'', pp. 138–158, 191–207&lt;/ref&gt;

Fruton and Sophia Simmonds traveled abroad during the 1962–1963 academic year, returning just as the MBB department was being created and the Department of Biochemistry was entering a "crisis" because of the loss of experienced faculty (in particular, [[Frederic M. Richards|Fred Richards]], the new head of MBB, and [[Ernest C. Pollard|Ernie Pollard]], who had left to head a biophysics department at [[Penn State]]).&lt;ref&gt;Fruton, ''Eighty Years'', pp. 158–175&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

Fruton died two days after his wife in [[New Haven]] on 29 July 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.yale.edu/opa/arc-ybc/v36.n2/story22.html |title=In Memoriam: Biochemists Joseph Fruton and Sofia Simmonds |access-date=2013-04-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324102016/http://www.yale.edu/opa/arc-ybc/v36.n2/story22.html |archive-date=2014-03-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3028">'''Joseph Othenin Bernard de Cléron, comte d'Haussonville''' (27 May 1809 – 28 May 1884), was a French politician and historian.

He was born in Paris.  His grandfather had been ''grand louvetier'' of France; his father was [[Charles Louis Bernard de Cléron, comte d'Haussonville]]  Comte Joseph had filled a series of diplomatic appointments at [[Brussels]], [[Turin]] and [[Naples]] before he entered the chamber of deputies in 1842 for [[Provins]]. Under the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]], he published a liberal anti-imperial paper at Brussels, ''Le Bulletin français'', and in 1863 he actively supported the candidature of [[Lucien Anatole Prevost-Paradol|Prévost Paradol]].

He was elected to the [[Académie française]] in 1869, in recognition of his historical writings, ''Histoire de la politique extérieure du gouvernement français de 1830 à 1848'' (2 vols., 1850), ''Histoire de la réunion de la Lorraine à la France'' (5 vols., 1854-1859), ''L'église romaine et le premier empire'' 1800-1814 (5 vols., 1864-1879). In 1870 he published a pamphlet directed against the [[Prussia]]n treatment of France, ''La France et la Prusse devant l'Europe'', the sale of which was prohibited in Belgium at the request of [[Wilhelm I of Germany|King Wilhelm of Prussia]].

He was the president of an association formed to provide new homes in [[Algeria]] for the inhabitants of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] who elected to retain their French nationality. In 1878 he was made a [[Senator for life (France)|life-senator]], in which capacity he allied himself with the Right Centre in defence of the religious associations against the anti-clericals. He died in Paris on 28 May 1884.

His wife '''[[Louise de Broglie, Countess d'Haussonville|Louise]]''' (1818-1882), a daughter of Duc [[Victor de Broglie (1785–1870)|Victor de Broglie]], published in 1858 a novel ''Robert Emuret'', followed by ''Marguerite de Valois reine de Navarre'' (1870), ''La Jeunesse de Lord Byron'' (1872), and ''Les Dernières Années de Lord Byron'' (1874). His son, [[Gabriel Paul Othenin de Cléron, comte d'Haussonville|Gabriel-Paul-Othenin]], was also a politician and historian.

This is a '''list of [[Googie architecture]] structures''' in Canada which includes a photographic gallery with a brief description of some of the structures which still remain. Googie was an original architectural style which began in [[Southern California]] during the late 1940s. Influenced by the coming of the [[Space age]], the Googie-themed architecture popularity was most notable during the mid-1960s, among [[motel]]s, [[coffee house]]s and [[gas station]]s. The term "Googie" comes from a now defunct [[Coffeehouse|coffee shop]] and [[Coffeehouse|cafe]] built in [[West Hollywood]]&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite news |first=Valerie J.|last=Nelson|title=Eldon Davis dies at 94; architect designed 'Googie' coffee shops |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/arts/la-me-eldon-davis-20110426,0,5591348.story |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher=|date=2011-04-26 |accessdate=2011-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; designed by [[John Lautner]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archdaily.com/tag/john-lautner/ John Lautner] Why Do Bad Guys Always Get The Best Houses?

'''Llanymynech Heritage Area''' is an historic former [[lime kiln]], [[quarry]] and industrial site near the village of [[Llanymynech]], Shropshire in the [[Welsh Marches]]. The site is adjacent to the [[A483 road]] and close to the [[Montgomery Canal]]. It is about {{convert|6|mi|0}} south of [[Oswestry]] on the English side of the border, and about {{convert|9|mi|0}} north of the [[Powys]] town of [[Welshpool]].

== History and significance ==

This is a nationally significant industrial heritage area, containing one of only three remaining [[Hoffmann kiln]]s in the country.&lt;ref name="shropshire"&gt;{{cite web|author=web.manager@shropshire.gov.uk |url=http://www.shropshire.gov.uk/outdoor-recreation/parks-and-countryside-sites/llanymynech-heritage-area/ |title=Llanymynech Heritage Area – Shropshire Council |publisher=Shropshire.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=4 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It provides key insights into industrial archaeology, as it was a major centre of the [[Lime (material)|lime]] industry until the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="shropshire" /&gt; It is not known when the lime industry started here, but it may date back to [[medieval]] times or possibly earlier. The first reference to the site is on a map from 1753. Evidence of early settlement locally includes a prehistoric hill fort on Llanmynech HIll, while [[Offa's Dyke]] runs close to the site on the western perimeter. The area also has a long history of industrial activity, including copper and lead mining dating back to at least the [[Roman Britain|Roman period]].&lt;ref name="cpat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpat.org.uk/projects/longer/llanymyn/llanym.htm |title=Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust – Projects – Recent projects – Llanymynech |publisher=Cpat.org.uk |date= |accessdate=4 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description of the site ==

Prior to the opening of the Montgomery Canal (then known as the [[Ellesmere Canal]]) in 1796, limestone quarrying was undertaken on the site on a relatively small scale, although lime kilns for lime burning appear to have been within the quarry from at least 1753. In 1806 a tramway and incline was constructed to transport limestone from the quarry to a new wharf on the canal. A second tramway was constructed to the east of the site sometime between 1807–1837 and this became the main transport route, remaining in use until the closure of the quarry in 1914.&lt;ref name="cpat" /&gt;

The 1863 opening of the [[Llanfyllin branch]] line, part of [[Cambrian Railways]], had a major impact on the quarry, enabling much faster transportation of limestone and opening up new potential markets. Additional track and sidings were built along with two [[Lime_kiln#Types_of_kiln|draw kilns]] – located to the west of the Hoffman kiln. Designed for continuous operation and built after 1874, these two kilns were abandoned by 1900.&lt;ref name="cpat" /&gt;

The Hoffman kiln was the last major development on the site and is believed to have been built around 1900, along with additional tramways and rail track. The kiln, which is exceptionally well preserved, measures around {{convert|44.8|xx|17.5|m|ft}} and has two tunnel vaults entered through 14 round-headed arches. The chimney, a local landmark, stands on a plinth and is around {{convert|42.5|m|0}} high.&lt;ref name="cpat" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/grant-aided-properties/hoffman-kiln-chimney-and-draw-kiln-llanymynech-sy22-6jx/ |title=Hoffman Kiln Chimney and Draw Kiln, Llanymynech |publisher=English Heritage |date=12 February 2013 |accessdate=4 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Restoration and community project ==

A restoration project ran from 2006–2009, with funding from both the Heritage Lottery Fund and [[English Heritage]]. Additional financial support also came from the Aggregates Levy Sustainability Fund and project partners, with the aim to conserve the site for visitors and educational purposes.&lt;ref name="shropshire" /&gt;

As part of the project, an archaeological investigation was carried out.&lt;ref name="invest"&gt; Discovering Shropshire's History [http://www.shropshirehistory.org.uk/html/search/verb/GetRecord/theme:20091009142647 "Archaeological investigations at the Llanymynech Limeworks Heritage Site in 2006-7"] Date retrieved: 1 August 2013 &lt;/ref&gt; Its main aim was to gather information about key features of the site – particularly the location of former tramways, ground surfaces and turntable track-beds.&lt;ref name="invest"/&gt;

A local community project also received funding from the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]], highlighting the importance of the area through initiatives including:
* Commissioning a sculpture, information boards, signage and leaflets
* Providing picnic benches and seating
* Volunteer research visit, wharf clearance, tours and opening of the canalside stable block.
* Creating a website and producing a social history archive.&lt;ref name="heritage"&gt;Llanymynech Community Project [http://www.llanymynech.org.uk/html/community_project.html "Community Project"]. Date retrieved: 1 August 2013 &lt;/ref&gt;
== Artefacts from the site ==

Some artefacts discovered at the site in recent years are on display at Oswestry Town Museum. These range from tools and a quarryman's boot to a tramway [[Railroad tie|sleeper]], [[Railway coupling|couplings]] and a [[Pulley|pulley wheel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oswestrytownmuseum.co.uk/index.php/exploring-the-museum/llanymynech-limeworks/ |title=Llanymynech Limeworks |publisher=Oswestry Town Museum |date=20 June 2012 |accessdate=4 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Walking Activities ==
This area contains a variety of short or long walks with routes leading passed lime kilns, woodland, canals, old railways, and grazed pastures.&lt;ref name="shropshire"/&gt; Along these routes are various information panels and sculptures to inform you about the area, some of these pathways are rough and so suitable footwear is recommended.&lt;ref name="shropshire"/&gt;

==Works==
Only one work of his survives, a chronicle (''Annales''), which was a continuation of [[Eusebius]]'s ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]''. It covers the period from 379 to 534, although an unknown writer added a continuation down to 566. Although his work is in [[Latin]], it primarily describes the affairs of the East; indeed the writer says that he has "followed only the [[Eastern Empire]]." Some information about [[Western Europe]], drawn from [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]'s ''Historia adversus paganos'' and [[Gennadius of Massilia|Gennadius]]' ''De viris illustribus'', is introduced insofar as it relates to Constantinople. The chronicle is filled with details and anecdotes about the city and the court. Marcellinus was uncompromisingly [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and has little good to say about heretics in his work.

'''Miguel Venegas''' (1680–1764) was a [[Jesuit]] administrator and historian. He is most known for his book ''Noticia de la California'', a standard geographical, historical, and ethnographic description of [[Baja California]], Mexico—a region he never personally visited.

== Biography ==
Miguel Venegas was born in [[Puebla]], New Spain. He received an academic degree prior to joining the Jesuit order, which he did in 1700 in Tepotzotlán. Five years later he was an ordained member and he taught philosophy and moral theology at the Colegio S. Pedro y S. Pablo de México.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Diccionario histórico de la Compañia de Jesús: biográfico-temático|last = O'Neill|first = C. E.|publisher = Institutum Historicum|year = 2001|isbn = |location = Rome|pages = 3922|last2 = Domínguez}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suffered from health problems and bodily swellings, which obliged him to retire to the Jesuit ranch of Chicomocelo, where he devoted himself to writing and botany until his death in 1764.

As a historian, he was cautious in his investigations, critical in his selection of sources and concerned with discovering the truth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In his major work on California, he cited [[Georg Marcgrave|Georg Marcgraf]] and [[Willem Piso]]'s ''[[Historia Naturalis Brasiliae]]'' (1648), an important compendium on flora and fauna in Brazil, which circulated widely in northern Europe and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Safier, "Beyond Brazilian Nature: The Editorial Itineraries of Marcgraf and Piso's ''Historia Naturalis Brasiliae'', in Michiel Van Groesen, ''The Legacy of Dutch Brazil'', New York: Cambridge University Press 2014, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1730s, he was assigned the task of writing an account of Baja California. This seems to have been, at least in part, to counter the setback to the missionaries' efforts and reputation caused by the [[Pericúes|Pericú]] revolt on the southernmost part of the peninsula in 1734. The historian was given access to the missionaries' correspondence and reports, and he was able to exchange letters with them to acquire further information, which he did through the use of questionnaires.

Venegas' 600-page manuscript, ''Empresas Apostólicas,'' was completed in 1739. It was sent to Spain, but it languished there rather than seeing publication because it was too detailed with regard to military matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Jesuit Encounters in the New World: Jesuit Chroniclers, geographers, educators and missionaries in the Americas, 1549-1767|last = Mathes|first = W.

This work by Venegas and Burriel was subsequently translated into English (1759), Dutch (1761–1762), French (1766–1767), and German (1769–1770), and it became the standard source for information about the early Californias. The original manuscript version was published in a facsimile edition in 1979.

Venegas was a prolific writer, also authoring biographical and theological treatises. Among his other works are a manual on how to administer the sacraments, which remained the official ritual for the Mexican branch of the Catholic church (1731), a biography of [[Juan María de Salvatierra]] (1754a, 1929) and another biography detailing the life of [[Juan Bautista Zappa]] (1754b). Many of these were edited extensively before publication due to Venegas' writing style, which was too lengthy for his fellow Jesuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = El apóstol Mariano representado en la vida del V.P.

'''''On Weights and Measures''''' is a historical, lexical, [[metrological]], and geographical treatise compiled in 392 [[Common Era|CE]] in [[Salamis, Cyprus|Constantia]] by [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] (c. 315&amp;ndash;403). The greater part of the work is devoted to a discussion on ancient Greek and Roman [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|weights and measures]].

The composition was written at the request of a Persian priest, sent to Epiphanius by letter from the Roman emperor in [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;Allen A. Shaw, ''On Measures and Weights by Epiphanius'', National Mathematics Magazine 11.1 (October 1936: 3–7).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, p. 11 (note 3). The letter was apparently signed jointly by [[Valentinian II]], emperor of the West, and [[Theodosius I|Theodosius]], emperor of the East, as well as Theodosius' two sons, [[Arcadius]] and [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]].&lt;/ref&gt; Although five fragments of an early Greek version are known to exist, with one entitled περὶ μέτρων καὶ στάθμων (''On Weights &amp; Measures''), added by a later hand,&lt;ref&gt;The Codex Parisinus Graecus 835, as noted by J.E. Dean (ed.), in ''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures: The Syriac Version'', (Chicago 1935), Introduction p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; this [[Syriac language|Syriac]] version is the only complete copy that has survived. Partial translations in Armenian and Georgian&lt;ref&gt;Found in the “Shatberd codex” MS. 1141, in the library of the ''Obshchestvo rasprostranenifa gramotnosti sredi gruzin'', Tiflis&lt;/ref&gt; are also known to exist. Its modern title belies its content, as the work also contains important historical anecdotes about people and places not written about elsewhere.

Two manuscripts of ''On Weights and Measures'', written in Syriac on parchment, are preserved at the [[British Museum]] in [[London]]. The older was found in [[Egypt]] and, according to the colophon, was written in the [[Seleucid era]], in "nine-hundred and sixty-[...]" (with the last digit effaced, meaning, that it was written between the years 649 CE–659 CE). The younger manuscript is designated "Or. Add. 14620".&lt;ref&gt;William Wright, [http://www.trismegistos.org/tm/detail.php?tm=115426 ''Catalogue of Syriac manuscripts in the British Museum''] 2 756 (pp. 717–718)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first to attempt a modern publication of Epiphanius' work was [[Paul de Lagarde]] in 1880, who reconstructed the original Syriac text by exchanging it with Hebrew characters,&lt;ref&gt;Paul de Lagarde, ''Veteris Testamenti ab Origene recensiti fragmenta apud Syros servata quinque. Praemittitur Epiphanii de mensuris et ponderibus liber nunc primum integer et ipse syriacus'', Gootingae 1880&lt;/ref&gt; and who had earlier published excerpts from several of the Greek fragments treating on weights and measures in his ''Symmicta''.&lt;ref&gt;Paul de Largarde, ''Symmicta'' I, Göttingen 1877, pp. 210–225&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, a critical edition of the Greek text was published by E.D. Moutsoulas in ''Theologia''.&lt;ref&gt;E.D. Moutsoulas, ed., "Epiphanius of Salamis, Concerning Weights and Measures" (Introduction, Commentary, Text and Notes), ''Theologia'', 44 (1973), pp. 157&amp;ndash;198&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Synopsis==
::&lt;small&gt;'''Part One'''&lt;/small&gt;
In folios [54b–55c], [[Hadrian]]'s journey and arrival in the East is dated "47 years after the destruction of Jerusalem."
*Translations
In folios [47a–49a]; [51d–52a]; [56d–57b] Epiphanius names four major translations of the [[Hebrew Bible]], made in the Greek tongue: the [[Septuagint|LXX]] made by the seventy-two translators, another by [[Aquila of Pontus]], one by [[Theodotion]], and yet another by [[Symmachus (translator)|Symmachus]]. A fifth Greek translation was discovered in wine jars in [[Jericho]], and a sixth in [[Nicopolis]] near Actium. Afterwards, [[Origen]] arranged six columns of the extant Greek translations and two of the Hebrew side by side, naming it the [[Hexapla]].&lt;ref&gt;''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, pp. 33&amp;ndash;34, 36&lt;/ref&gt; Epiphanius expands his description of the translation of the seventy-two translators (known as the Septuagint) and how they were assigned thirty-six cells, two to each cell, on the Pharian island. Two translators translated the [[Book of Genesis]], another two the [[Book of Exodus]], another two the [[Book of Leviticus]], and so forth, until the entire 22 canonical books of the Hebrew Bible had all been translated into the Greek tongue.&lt;ref&gt;Excluding [[Ecclesiastes]] and the [[Song of Solomon]], which books had only later been added to the canon, according to Jewish tradition.&lt;/ref&gt; The seventy-two translators were drawn from the twelve tribes of Israel, six men to each tribe who were skilled in the Greek language.
 
In folios [49a–50a] Epiphanius gives a description of the canonical books of the [[Hebrew Bible]] and translations made of the same. In his day, he notes that the Scroll of Ruth and the Book of Judges were joined together, and considered as one book. So, too, the [[Book of Ezra|Books of Ezra]] and [[Book of Nehemiah|Nehemiah]] were joined, and considered as one book, as were First and Second [[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]] (''Paraleipomena'') considered as one book, as were the First and Second [[Book of Samuel|Samuel]] (''Book of First and Second Kingdoms'') considered as one book, and the First and Second [[Books of Kings|Kings]] (''Book of Third and Fourth Kingdoms'') considered as one book.&lt;ref&gt;''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, pp. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;small&gt;'''Part Two'''&lt;/small&gt;
*Prominent figures
In spite of Epiphanius' interest in Jewish themes, his narrative often takes on a distorted and stereotypical view of [[Judaism]], based on the dogmas of his persuasion. Still, he is an invaluable source on the lives of people and places that figure highly in Jewish [[Oral tradition|lore]]. In folios [54a–55c]; [55c–55d] Epiphanius treats on the lives of two prominent persons who became [[proselytes]] to the Jewish religion; the one [[Aquila of Pontus|Aquila]] (known also as Onkelos) who was a relation of [[Hadrian]], and whom he made the overseer of Jerusalem's rebuilding around 115 [[Common Era|CE]].&lt;ref&gt;''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; The other person of interest who is described by him is [[Symmachus (translator)|Symmachus]], also known as ''Sūmkos'' ({{lang-he-n|'''סומכוס'''}}) in rabbinic literature.&lt;ref&gt;See: [[Mishnah]] ''Eruvin'' 3:1; ''Baba Metzia'' 6:5; ''Ḥullin'' 5:3 in ''The Mishnah'' (ed. Herbert Danby), Oxford University Press, 1974; the [[Babylonian Talmud]] ''Eruvin'' 13b, ''Baba Bathra'' 73a, ''Baba Kamma'' 46a, ''et al''.&lt;/ref&gt; Symmachus is mentioned as belonging originally to the [[Samaritans|Samaritan]] nation, and is said to have converted to Judaism during the reign of [[Marcus Aurelius|Verus]].&lt;ref&gt;According to Epiphanius, Marcus Aurelius was also called Verus.&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently underwent a second [[circumcision]]&lt;ref&gt;''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; and became a disciple of [[Rabbi Meir]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Babylonian Talmud]] ''Eruvin'' 13b&lt;/ref&gt; Symmachus belonged to the fifth generation (165&amp;ndash;200 [[Common Era|CE]]) of Rabbinical teachers referred to in the text of the [[Mishnah]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Mishnah'' (ed. [[Herbert Danby]]), Oxford University Press: Oxford 1977, Appendix III, pp. 799&amp;ndash;800 {{ISBN|0 19 815402 X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Emperor [[Hadrian]] is said to have passed through [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] while ''en route'' to Egypt, some 47 years after the destruction of Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;'''Part Three'''&lt;/small&gt;
*Weights and Measures
Folios [61d–73b] contain a treatise on the known weights and measures used in his day among the [[Jews|Hebrews]], the Greeks and the Romans. He states the equivalent weights for the ''[[Biblical and Talmudic units of measurement#Dry measure|kab]]'' (''cab''),&lt;ref&gt;''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; ''kor'',&lt;ref&gt;A measure of capacity equal to 30 ''modii'' (seahs). v. ''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, p. 12 (folio 45d). The same is defined in the Talmud (''Baba Bathra'' 86b, 105a) as equal to thirty ''seahs'', a capacity equal to about 395.533 cubic centimeters.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''lethekh'' ([[Biblical and Talmudic units of measurement#Dry measure|Lethek]]), [[Homer (unit)|''homer'']], [[Bath (unit)|''bath'']], ''modius'' ([[Hebrew]]: ''seah'' = lit. "measure"),&lt;ref&gt;A measure of capacity equivalent to the volume of 144 medium-sized eggs (9.6 litres); Marcus Jastrow, ''Dictionary of the Targumim, the Talmud Babli and Yerushalmi, and the Midrashic Literature'' (2nd edition), Massachusetts 2006, s.v. '''מודיא''' p. 738.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Mina (unit)|mina]]'' ([[Hebrew]]: ''maneh''),&lt;ref&gt;''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, pp. 60 (§ 51), 65; a weight in silver that was equal to 100 ''[[denarii|denaria]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; among others. In folios [62b–62c] Epiphanius distinguishes between "a handful" ({{Lang-he-n|'''מְלֹא כַף'''}}) in [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt09a17.htm#12 I Kings 17:12] and "a handful" ({{Lang-he-n|'''מְלֹא חֹפֶן'''}}) in [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0209.htm#8 Exodus 9:8] and [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0316.htm#12 Leviticus 16:12]; in the former case it refers to only one handful, but in latter cases it refers to "a measure of two handfuls."&lt;ref&gt;''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;small&gt;'''Part Four'''&lt;/small&gt;
*Geography of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Asia Minor]] and the [[Levant]]
In folios [73b–75a] Epiphanius gives the names of several cities and places of renown, both in his time and in ancient times, such as: [[Mount Ararat]] (§ 61), Aṭaṭ (§ 62), or what is known as the "threshing floor of the thorn bush" ({{Lang-he-n|'''גרן האטד'''}}), and whose description echoes that of [[Rashi]]'s commentary on Genesis 50:10,&lt;ref&gt;Said to be a place about two miles from the Jordan River, called ''Beth-ḥagla'' (lit. "the place of the circuit").&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abarim]] (§ 63); [[Eben-Ezer|Aviʿazar]] (§ 68), or what is ''Eḇen haʿezer'' of [[I Samuel]] 4:1, said to be "fourteen [Roman] miles distant east and north of [[Eleutheropolis]], in a valley"; [[Carmel (biblical settlement)|Carmel]]{{nbsp}}(§ 77); [[Mount Carmel|Carmel]] of the sea (§ 78); [[Akko]] (§ 76);  [[Anathoth]] (§ 66); [[Azekah]] (§ 64) - a city in whose time was called Ḥ&lt;sup&gt;ǝ&lt;/sup&gt;warta;&lt;ref&gt;R. Steven Notley &amp; [[Ze'ev Safrai]], in their book, "Eusebius, ''Onomasticon - The Place Names of Divine Scripture'' (Brill: Leiden 2005, p. 19, note 47), have noted: "According to his (Epiphanius') formulation, it would seem that he was of the opinion that Hiwarta, which means 'white' (''lavan''), is the translation of Azekah. About five kilometers to the southeast of Tell Zechariah is a high hill called Tell el-Beida, meaning in Arabic 'white'. In current maps, the site is named Tell Livnin, which means the hill of bricks (''livanim''), and it is to this that Eusebius (who also wrote about Azekah) most probably referred. 'Azekah' is not 'white', either in Hebrew or in Aramaic. ''Le-azek'' in Hebrew means to remove stones, and then the soil appears a bit paler. It therefore appears that Epiphanius, who was born in Beit Zedek, near [[Eleutheropolis]], identified Azekah with Tell el-Beida. Azekah is six kilometers from Eleutheropolis, and Tell Livnin is eight kilometers from there. Epiphanius adapted the new name to the identification by means of an etymological exegesis that has no linguistic basis. At any rate, no settlement existed on Tell Azekah in the Roman-Byzantine period. The early site moved from the high hill to the fields in the plain at the foot of the tell. It may possibly have moved as fr as Kh. el-Beida, although this is difficult to accept."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bethel]] (§ 73); [[Ophrah (Taybeh)|Ophrah]] (§ 67); [[Carthage]] (§ 79) - where the [[Canaanites]] had migrated from [[Phoenicia]] and who were called in his day ''Bizakanoi'' (scattered people); [[Petra|Rekem]] (§ 71), [[Jaffa]] (§ 75), [[Jerusalem]]{{nbsp}}(§ 74), ''et al.''

The regnal years of the Caesars as stated by Epiphanius differ slightly in some places from the extant Greek versions. With respect to events in Rome after the reign of [[Pertinax]], both Epiphanius and [[Jerome]] do not mention the ascension of [[Didius Julianus]] after the assassination of Pertinax, but write only that [[Septimius Severus|Severus]] succeeded him.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]'' of [[Jerome]], [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/jerome_chronicle_03_part2.htm 2005 online edition]  (tertullian.org), year 193. Epiphanius, by his own admittance (''On Weights and Measures'', p. 66 [folio 71c]), was familiar with [[Eusebius]]' ''Chronicle'' from which Jerome had based his ''Chronicon'' and may have used it to construct his own chronologies.&lt;/ref&gt; This may have been because they did not consider his 9-week reign, which he obtained through usurpation, to be legitimate. Similarly, Epiphanius does not mention the ascension of [[Aemilian]]. It can be adduced from Jerome's ''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]'' that Aemilian, who "caused a revolt in Moesia," was never officially confirmed by the Senate in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]'' of [[Jerome]], [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/jerome_chronicle_03_part2.htm 2005 online edition]  (tertullian.org), year 254&lt;/ref&gt; Epiphanius' method of recording the regnal years from Augustus to Hadrian, with his pinpoint recollection of the number of months and days to each reign, can be said to be accurate, based on [[Josephus]]' own testimony about himself, saying that he was aged 56  in the 13th year of the reign of Caesar [[Domitian]],&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''[[Antiquities of the Jews|Antiquities]]'' (20.11.3)&lt;/ref&gt; and that he (Josephus) was born in the 1st year of Caesar [[Caligula|Gaius]].&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''[[The Life of Flavius Josephus|Vita]]'' § 1&lt;/ref&gt; Using Epiphanius' chronology, the years are indeed collected as 56. By comparison, the span of years in [[Suetonius]]' ''De vita Caesarum'' (Lives of the Caesars), which gives 14 years for Claudius and 15 years for Nero, the same time frame would span a period of some 58 years!&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Lives of the Caesars'' (the Loeb Classical Library series), vol. ii, book v, paragraph xlv&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Buzzi studied [[law]] in [[Pavia]], and at the same time attended [[lecture]]s in [[literature]]. In 1891, he won the [[milanese]] ''Concorso di Poesia'' award. In 1898 with ''Rapsodie leopardiane'' his poetry career begun in ernest. In 1905 he won the title of ''Best Italian Language Poet'' in a competition in the [[literary magazine]] ''Poesia'', founded by [[Marinetti]] and [[Sem Benelli]]. He started thus to write for ''Poesia'', and became a noted futurist, experimenting with poetical and theatrical form. He also tried [[filming]]. In later years he left the futurist work ethos and worked with traditional forms of poetry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2615">The '''pataphysical calendar''' is a [[calendar]] that is inspired by Alfred Jarry, the creator of the '[[pataphysics]] and the author of [[Ubu Roi]].

The first version of the calendar was published in ''L'Almanach du Père Ubu'' in [[1889]]. The second version was released in [[1901]] in the ''L'Almanach illustré du Père Ubu''. The calendar started to get used in the [[Collège de 'Pataphysique]] in [[1948]], after the death of Jarry.

The calendar has 13 months with each 29 days. The 29th day however, is not used, except for ''29 Gidouille'' (as an exception) and ''29 Gueule'' in a [[leap year]]. The months always start on a Sunday, so that every month has a [[Friday the 13th]]. The names of the days are equal to the general calendar (the French names are mostly used), except for the 29th (the [[Imaginary number|imaginary]] day), which name is ''Hunyadi''. 29 Gueule is called ''Hunyadi gras'' (fat hunyadi).

To make it not that hard for the reader, one places the vulgar (standard) date after the date.

== Months ==
The year has the following months:
{| style="margin-bottom: 10px;" 
| &amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 
| Absolu 
|September 8 until October 5
|-
| &amp;nbsp;2 
| Haha
|October 6 until November 2
|-
| &amp;nbsp;3 
| As 
| November 3 until November 30
|-
| &amp;nbsp;4 
| Sable 
| December 1 until December 28
|-
| &amp;nbsp;5 
| Décervelage&amp;nbsp; 
| December 29 until January 25
|-
| &amp;nbsp;6 
| Gueules 
| January 26 until February 22/23
|-
| &amp;nbsp;7 
| Pédale 
| February 23/24 until March 22
|-
| &amp;nbsp;8 
| Clinamen 
| March 23 until April 19
|-
| &amp;nbsp;9 
| Palotin 
| April 20 until May 17
|-
| 10 
| Merdre 
| May 18 until June 14
|-
| 11 
| Gidouille 
| June 15 until July 13
|-
| 12 
| Tatane 
| July 14 until August 10
|-
| 13 
| Phalle
|August 11 until September 7
|}
The names are inspired by the exceptional terminology and [[neologisms]] in the work of Jarry. In his play, he wrote ''merd'''r'''e ''instead of ''merde'', which literally means poop - ''o'''n'''eille'' instead of ''oreille'', which means ear.

== Calendar era ==
The calendar era starts on 1 Absolu 1 EP (= Ère 'Pataphysique), the birth day of Alfred Jarry (September 8, 1873).

== Saints ==
The calendar has its own saints, like ''the holy [[Joseph-Ignace Guillotin|Guillotine]], medic'' (13 Décervelage = January 10), ''the holy ''[[Hieronymus Bosch]] (17 Clinamen = April 8) and ''the Childbirth of the holy ''[[Pope Joan|Johanna Pausin]] (1 Merdre = May 18)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3682">[[File:Professor Peter Davies in Tokyo, Japan, October 2011.jpg|thumb|Peter Davies in Tokyo, Japan, October 2011]]

'''Peter N. Davies''' (born 14 July 1927) is a British economic historian with interests in the port of [[Liverpool]], sea-based trade with [[West Africa]], the [[Canary Islands]] and [[Japan]], the international fruit trade and the military history of the [[Khwae Yai River|River Kwai]] campaign in [[World War II]]. He is now an Emeritus Professor in the School of History at the [[University of Liverpool]], [[England]].

Davies is the author of several books including, "The Trade Makers, [[Elder Dempster]] in West Africa" (Allen and Unwin, 1973), "Trading in West Africa" (Croom Helm, 1976), "Sir Alfred Jones: Shipping Entrepreneur par Excellence" (Europa, 1978), "[[Fyffes]] and the Banana, Musa Sapientum" (Athlone Press, 1990), "Japanese Shipping and Shipbuilding Industries: A History of Their Modern Growth" (with T. Chida, Athlone Press, 1990), "The Man Behind the Bridge: Colonel Toosey and the [[Khwae Yai River|River Kwai]]" (Athlone Press, 1991), and "From Orchard to Market" (with D.Hope-Mason, Lockwood Press, 2005).

During a long career at the [[University of Liverpool]], Davies has continued the tradition of commitment to Maritime History which had been initiated by Francis Hyde and maintained by John Harris (subsequently Professor of Economic History at the [[University of Birmingham]]) and Sheila Marriner. Taken together, Hyde, Harris, Marriner and Davies have become known as the "Liverpool School of Maritime Historians".&lt;ref&gt;Davies PN, "The Liverpool School of Maritime History". International Journal of Maritime History (2005);XVII, 2 pp249–260.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Milne G, "Trade and Traders in Mid-Victorian Liverpool: Mercantile Business and the Making of a World Port" (Liverpool University Press, 2000) pp 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Business, Life and Letters of Frederick Cornes : Aspects of the Evolution of Commerce in Modern Japan, 1861-1912"  (Global Oriental: {{ISBN|1-905246-34-X}}) was published in September 2008. In this book Davies examines the surprisingly well-preserved papers of Frederick Cornes, a merchant from [[Cheshire]], England who spent much of his life trading in Japan's port city of [[Yokohama]] during and after the [[Meiji Restoration]], including the entire correspondence of "Cornes and Company" extending over a forty-year period in the early years of Anglo-Japanese trade.

Davies's latest book, "Across the Three Pagodas Pass: The Story of the Thai-Burma Railway" (Renaissance Books: {{ISBN|978-1-898823-07-0}}), was published in August 2013. Davies acted as editor to Ewart Escritt's translation of the personal records of Japanese Railway Engineer Yoshihiko Futamatsu. Davies had come to know Futamatsu through his research for the 1991 biography of [[Philip Toosey]] "The Man Behind the Bridge" and secured his agreement that his memoirs could be published in English after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Davies PN (ed), Futamatsu Y "Across the Three Pagodas Pass: The Story of the Thai-Burma Railway" (Renaissance Books: {{ISBN|978-1-898823-07-0}}).&lt;/ref&gt; The book is therefore a rare account from the Japanese viewpoint of the construction of the Thai-Burma Railway (and the [[Khwae Yai River|River Kwai]] Bridge) during [[World War II]].

Huxley, in ''Greek, Roman and Byzantine Studies'' '''14''' (1973:137–43) places his career in the lifetime of [[Cimon]] son of [[Miltiades the Younger]].&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Greek mythology|Greek mythographer]] and [[logographer (history)|logographer]]. He came from the island of [[Leros]]. Pherecydes spent the greater part of his working life in [[Athens]], and so he was also called '''Pherecydes of Athens''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Φερεκύδης ὁ Ἀθηναῖος}}): the encyclopedic Byzantine ''[[Suda]]'' considers Pherecydes of Athens and of Leros separately.&lt;ref&gt;Suda φ 216, 217&lt;/ref&gt;

Pherecydes of Leros should not be confused with [[Pherecydes of Syros]], the mid-6th-century [[philosopher]], who was sometimes mentioned as one of the [[Seven Sages of Greece]] and was reputed to have been the teacher of [[Pythagoras]].

== Works ==
Pherecydes's great treatises—a history of his native isle, [[Leros]] (Περὶ Λέρου); an essay, ''On [[Iphigeneia]]'' (Περὶ Ἰφιγενείας); and ''On the Festivals of [[Dionysus]]'' (Περὶ τῶν Διονύσου ἑορτῶν)—are all lost. However, numerous fragments of his ten-book [[genealogy|genealogies]] of the [[god]]s and [[hero]]es, which was written in the [[Ionic dialect|Ionian]] dialect to glorify the ancestors in the heroic age of his 5th-century patrons, have been preserved. Pherecydes modified the [[legend]]s, not in order to rationalize them, but rather to adjust them to popular [[belief]]s. Therefore, Pherecydes cannot be classed with the earlier mythographer [[Hecataeus of Miletus]], whose ''Genealogiai'' ("Genealogies") were more skeptical and critical.

Pherecydes was the main source for the mythological encyclopedia, the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheke]]'' mistakenly connected with the name of [[Apollodorus of Athens]].

'''Ruda'''  is a [[deity]] that was of paramount importance in the [[Arab]] [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] of gods worshipped by the [[Tribes of Arabia|North Arabian tribes]] of [[pre-Islamic Arabia]].&lt;ref name=Lipinskip618&gt;Lipinski, 2000, pp. 618-619.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[etymology]] of his name gives the meaning "well disposed" an indication of his function as a protective deity.&lt;ref name=Lipinskip618/&gt; The oldest reference to Ruda is found in the annals of [[Esarhaddon]] who ruled over the [[Assyrian empire]] from 681 to 669 BC. The name is transliterated into Latin script  from the original [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] as ''Ru-ul-da-a-a-ú'' and he is mentioned among the gods of the Arabs.&lt;ref name=Lipinskip618/&gt; Known as [[Arsu]] among the [[Palmyra]]ns, in a later [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] inscription, Arsu/Ruda is paired with the [[Syria]]n god [[Resheph]], a protective deity for his worshippers from the 3rd millennium BC.&lt;ref name=Lipinskip618/&gt;

Dierk Lange writes that Ruda formed part of a trinity of gods worshipped by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]]-attested Yumu´il confederation of northern Arabian tribes, which he identifies with the [[Ishmaelites]].&lt;ref name=Langep268&gt;Lange, 2004, pp. 268-269.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lange, Ruda was the [[moon deity]], [[Nuha (deity)|Nuha]] the [[sun deity]], and [[Atarsamain]] the main deity was associated with [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]].&lt;ref name=Langep268/&gt;   

Inscriptions in a [[Ancient North Arabian|North Arabian]] dialect found in the region of [[Najd]] refer to Ruda and other gods of the [[Arab]] pantheon, providing evidence of how all things good and bad were attributed to the agency of gods.&lt;ref name=Hoylandp207&gt;Hoyland, 2001, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of such inscriptions referring to Ruda include, "by Ruda are we" and "by Ruda is weeping".&lt;ref name=Hoylandp207/&gt;

A trinity of gods representing the sun, moon and Venus is also found among the peoples of the South Arabian kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Awsan|Awsan]], [[Ma'in]], [[Qataban]] and [[Hadramawt]] between the 9th and 4th centuries BC.&lt;ref name=Langep268/&gt; There, the deity associated with Venus was [[Astarte]], the sun deity was [[Yam (god)|Yam]], and moon deity was variously called [[Wadd]], [[Amm (god)|Amm]] and [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]].&lt;ref name=Langep268/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6091">'''Sigebert IV''' (c. 671 - c. 679) was the son of [[Dagobert II]] and a Saxon duchess called Mathildis (also called Mechthilde),&lt;ref&gt;According to the 8th century [[Vita Sancti Wilfrithi]] ('' Life of St Wilfrid''), and also mentioned in a version of the ''Vita Sancti Arbogasti''.&lt;/ref&gt; and the grandson of [[Sigebert III]] of the [[Merovingian dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;The early 8th century ''Vita Amandi Episcopi'' referred to "Sygiberto" [http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/~db/bsb00000752/images/index.html?id=00000752&amp;fip=213.140.22.76&amp;no=1&amp;seite=450] and to "Sigebertum, Dagoberti Filium" [http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/~db/bsb00000752/images/index.html?id=00000752&amp;fip=213.140.22.76&amp;no=12&amp;seite=460]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Historians tend to ignore the importance of these references, [[François Eudes de Mézeray]], in ''Histoire de France'' (Paris, 1685) referred to an anonymous son, and doubted his existence.&lt;/ref&gt; He is believed to have died either just before or after his father and other members of the royal family, who were killed on the orders of [[Ebroin]], the [[Franks|Frankish]] [[Mayor of the Palace]] of [[Neustria]].&lt;ref&gt;René Descadeillas, ''Mythologie du Trésor de Rennes: Histoire Veritable de L'Abbé Saunière, Curé de Rennes-le-Château'', Annexe VI (Mémoires de la Société des Arts et des Sciences de Carcassonne, Annees 1971-1972, 4me série, Tome VII, 2me partie; 1974).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 10th-century biography of [[Saint Arbogast]], ''Vita Sancti Argobasti'',&lt;ref&gt;Utho Argentinensis, ''Vita Sancti Arbogasti episcopi argentinensis in Germania prima'' (Apud Bolland., Junii tom. V, p. 170). [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5523567k/f502.image] This version of the text does not refer to Mathildis.&lt;/ref&gt; Sigebert is mentioned but not named as having died during a hunting accident and later miraculously raised from the dead by Arbogast, [[Bishop of Strasbourg]] and close friend of Dagobert II.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Settipani, in ''La Prehistoire des Capetiens'' (1993) argued that the ''Vita Sancti Arbogasti'' is too late a source to be accepted without care, and points to evidence that it places Arbogast and his successor Florentius up to a century too late (Arbogast died in around 600). He argues that the trio of Dagobert II, and his alleged wife Mathildis and son Sigebert, may actually have arisen from confusion with Dagobert I, his wife Nanthilde and son Sigebert (his mother was actually Ragnetrude).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Priory of Sion ==
According to the [[Pseudohistory|pseudohistorical]] ''[[Dossiers Secrets d'Henri Lobineau]]'' and related documents, Sigebert IV, on the assassination of his father [[Dagobert II]], was rescued by his sister and smuggled to the domain of his mother the (otherwise unknown) [[Visigoths|Visigoth]] princess, Giselle de Razès in [[Rennes-le-Château]]. He is said to have arrived in the [[Languedoc]] in 681 and, at some point, adopted or inherited his uncle's titles, [[duke]] of [[Razès]] and [[count]] of [[Rhedae]]. He is also said to have adopted the surname, or nickname, of “Plant-Ard” (subsequently Plantard) from the [[French language|French]] appellation ‘''rejeton ardent''’ ‘ardently flowering shoot’ of the Merovingian vine. Under this name, and under the titles acquired from his uncle, he is said to have perpetuated his lineage.&lt;ref name="Baigent, Leigh &amp; Lincoln 1982"&gt;{{cite book| author = [[Michael Baigent|Baigent, Michael]]; [[Richard Leigh (author)|Leigh, Richard]]; [[Henry Lincoln|Lincoln, Henry]]| title = [[The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail]] | publisher = Corgi| year = 1982| isbn = 0-552-12138-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalists and scholars who have [[Debunker|debunked]] the [[Priory of Sion]] hoax argue that [[Pierre Plantard]] created the ''Dossiers Secrets d'Henri Lobineau'' and the fictitious biography of Sigebert IV to support his false claim that he was a descendant of the extinct Merovingian dynasty through this figure.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Luc Chaumeil, ''The Priory of Sion - Shedding Light on the Treasure and Legacy of Rennes-le-Château and the Priory of Sion'' (Avalonia, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Plantard revised himself by claiming he was only descended from a [[cadet branch]] of the line of Dagobert II, while arguing that the direct descendant was really [[Otto von Habsburg]],&lt;ref&gt;Quoting Pierre Plantard: "If anyone can claim to be a descendant of Sigisbert IV in the direct line it can only be Otto von Habsburg, and he alone. To all those people who write to me I have given this same reply." From ''Vaincre – Reprend le titre d'un périodique paru en 1942-1943'', Number 1, April 1990 {{cite web |url=http://jhaldezos.free.fr/lespersonnages/plantard/images/Vaincre%20avril%201990.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818232934/http://jhaldezos.free.fr/lespersonnages/plantard/images/Vaincre%20avril%201990.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who, according to Plantard, was descended from Sigebert I (the son of Bera II and the grandson of [[Wamba, Visigothic king|Wamba]]), who married Magdala, the granddaughter of Dagobert II.&lt;ref&gt;Quoting Plantard: "We would like to repeat that in no case have we found any trace of the son of Dagobert II in the list of the Visigothic Razes. This Sigibert IV found refuge with his abbess sister at Oeren and was the cousin of Sigebert de Rhedae, who was alive more or less around the same time. Historians conflate these two Sigiberts into one person. When did Sigebert IV die? We don't know. Some think that he was the founder of the Habsburg family."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Luc Chaumeil, ''Le trésor du Triangle d'Or'', page 163 (Nice: Alain Lefeuvre, 1979).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Song of the hoe''' or the '''Creation of the pickax''' is a [[Sumerian creation myth]], written on [[clay tablet]]s from the last century of the [[3rd millennium BCE]].&lt;ref name="Kramer1979"&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel Noah Kramer|title=From the poetry of Sumer: creation, glorification, adoration|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tZSdbj5Hny0C&amp;pg=PA25|accessdate=10 June 2011|date=April 1979|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-03703-8|pages=25–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disputations==

Seven debate topics are known from the Sumerian literature, falling in the category of [[disputation]]s; some examples are: The [[Debate between sheep and grain]]; The [[Debate between bird and fish]]; the [[Debate between Winter and Summer]]; and ''The Dispute between Silver and Copper'', etc.&lt;ref name="Kramer1964"&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel Noah Kramer|title=The Sumerians: their history, culture and character|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iY9xp4pLp88C&amp;pg=PA220|accessdate=23 May 2011|date=1964|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-45238-8|pages=218–}}&lt;/ref&gt; These topics came some centuries after writing was established in Sumerian [[Mesopotamia]].

==Story==
The poem is composed of the frequent use of the word "al", which means [[hoe (tool)|hoe]]. The verb-forms and nouns also frequently start with, or contain the syllable "al" (or "ar"), suggesting the writer intended it for humour as a satirical school text or as a [[tongue-twister]].&lt;ref name="HalloYounger1997"&gt;{{cite book|author1=William W. Hallo|author2=K. Lawson Younger|title=The Context of Scripture: Canonical compositions from the biblical world|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=es6BaGkU4XIC|accessdate=10 June 2011|date=January 1997|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-04-10618-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song starts with a creation myth where [[Enlil]] separates heaven and earth in [[Duranki]], the cosmic [[Nippur]] or '[[Garden of the gods (Sumerian paradise)|Garden of the Gods]]'.

{{cquote|''"Not only did the lord make the world appear in its correct form, the lord who never changes the destinies which he determines – Enlil – who will make the human seed of the Land come forth from the earth – and not only did he hasten to separate heaven from earth, and hasten to separate earth from heaven, but, in order to make it possible for humans to grow in "where flesh came forth" [the name of a cosmic location], he first raised the axis of the world at [[Dur-an-ki]].&lt;ref name="ETCSL"&gt;[http://www-etcsl.orient.ox.ac.uk/section5/tr554.htm ETCSL Translation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402070726/http://www-etcsl.orient.ox.ac.uk/section5/tr554.htm |date=2009-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The myth continues with a description of Enlil creating daylight with his hoe; he goes on to praise its construction and creation. Enlil's mighty hoe is said to be made of [[gold]], with the blade made of [[lapis lazuli]] and fastened by cord. It is inlaid with lapis lazuli and adorned with [[silver]] and gold. Enlil makes civilized man, from a [[brick]] mould with his hoe – and the [[Annanuki]] start to praise him. [[Nisaba]], [[Ninmena]], and [[Nunamnir]] start organizing things. [[Enki]] praises the hoe; they start reproducing and Enlil makes numerous shining hoes, for everyone to begin work. Enlil then founds the [[Ekur]] with his hoe whilst a "god-man" called Lord [[Nudimmud]] builds the [[Abzu]] in [[Eridug]]. Various gods are then described establishing construction projects in other cities, such as [[Ninhursag]] in [[Kesh (Sumer)|Kesh]], and [[Inanna]] and [[Utu]] in [[Zabalam]]; [[Nisaba]] and [[E-ana]] also set about building.&lt;ref name="ETCSL"/&gt; The useful construction and agricultural uses of the hoe are summarized, along with its capabilities for use as a [[weapon]] and for burying the dead. Allusions are made to the scenes of [[Enkidu]]'s [[ghost]], and [[Urshanabi]]'s ferry over the [[Hubur]], in the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]]:

{{cquote|''"dead people are also brought up from the ground by the hoe. With the hoe, the hero honoured by [[Anu|An]], the younger brother of [[Nergal]], the warrior [[Gilgamesh]] – is as powerful as a hunting net. The sage son of [[Ninsumun]] is pre-eminent with [[oar]]s. With the hoe, he is the great "kindajal" of the [[watercourse]]s.&lt;ref name="ETCSL"/&gt;}}

[[Ninmena]] is suggested to create both the [[priest]]ess and [[king]].&lt;ref name="religious of the past"&gt;{{cite book|title=religious of the past|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0sgUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA140|accessdate=10 June 2011|publisher=Brill Archive|pages=140–|id=GGKEY:SDQ069KTBZ0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hymn ends with extensive praisings of the hoe, Enlil, and Nisaba:

{{cquote|''"The hoe makes everything prosper; the hoe makes everything flourish. The hoe is good [[barley]]; the hoe is an overseer. The hoe is brick moulds; the hoe has made people exist. It is the hoe that is the strength of young manhood. The hoe and the [[basket]] are the tools for building [[cities]]. It builds the right kind of house; it cultivates the right kind of fields. It is you, hoe, that extend the good agricultural land!&lt;ref name="ETCSL"/&gt;}}

==Discussion==

Modern society may have trouble comprehending the virtue of extolling a tool such as the lowly hoe, for the Sumerians the implement had brought [[agriculture]], [[irrigation]], [[drainage]] and the ability to build roads, canals and eventually the first proto-cities.&lt;ref name="Kramer1979"/&gt; One of the tablets from the Yale Babylonian Collection was published by J.J. Van Dijk which spoke of three cosmic realms; heaven, earth and [[kur]] in a time when darkness covered an arid land, when heaven and earth were joined and the Enlil's universal laws, the [[Me (mythology)|me]] did not function.&lt;ref name="Kramer1979"/&gt; Two of the major traditions of the Sumerian concept of the creation of man are discussed in the myth. The first is the creation of mankind from brick moulds or clay. This has notable similarities to the creation of man from the dust of the earth in the [[Book of Genesis]] in the [[Bible]] ({{Bibleverse|Genesis|2:6-7|HE}}). This activity has also been associated with creating clay figurines.&lt;ref name="Frymer-Kensky2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tikva Simone Frymer-Kensky|author-link=Tikva Frymer-Kensky|title=Studies in Bible and feminist criticism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cDEtHfEpp7sC&amp;pg=PA21|accessdate=10 June 2011|date=May 2006|publisher=Jewish Publication Society|isbn=978-0-8276-0798-9|pages=21–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second Sumerian tradition which compares men to plants, made to "break through the ground", an allusion to imagery of the fertility or mother goddess and giving an image of man being "planted" in the ground.&lt;ref name="Frymer-Kensky2006"/&gt; Wayne Horowitz notes that five Sumerian myths recount a creation scene with the separation of heaven and earth. He further notes the figurative imagery relaying the relationship between the creation of agricultural implements making a function for mankind and thereby its creation from the "seed of the land".&lt;ref name="Horowitz1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wayne Horowitz|title=Mesopotamian cosmic geography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P8fl8BXpR0MC&amp;pg=PA134|accessdate=10 June 2011|date=1998|publisher=Eisenbrauns|isbn=978-0-931464-99-7|pages=134–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The myth was called the "Creation of the Pickax" by Samuel Noah Kramer, a name by which it is referred in older sorurces. In Sumerian literature, the hoe or pickaxe is used not only in creation of the Ekur but also described as the tool of its destruction in lament hymns such as the [[Lament for Ur]], where it is torn apart with a storm and then pickaxes.&lt;ref name="Dobbs-Allsopp1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=F. W. Dobbs-Allsopp|title=Weep, O daughter of Zion: a study of the city-lament genre in the Hebrew Bible|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_4m-5MqIGYsC&amp;pg=PA57|accessdate=10 June 2011|date=1993|publisher=GBPress Pont. Ist.Biblicum|isbn=978-88-7653-346-4|pages=57–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cosmological position of the hoe does not fit into [[Charles H. Long|Charles Long]]'s categorization of cosmogenic myths. Creation has been suggested to have been the responsibility of different gods via different processes. Creation via a cosmological agricultural implement seems to occupy a unique place in the creation myth genre. The song was meant to be sung aloud with the repetition of the word hoe or "al" a total of forty five times in the text with common use of the two [[syllable]]s together "al"/"ar". A cosmological link is suggested between the hoe's ''being'' and its ''doing''; making everything prosper and flourish within a [[community]]. Gary Martin discusses the sociological benefits of singing songs to a hoe, to remind people that they wield the implement of Enlil and of creation. That they can participate in creativity and work well to preserve and improve [[society]]. He suggests that "perhaps by praising the simple tool of an extremely important group of laborers, and imbuing it with cosmological significance, those wielders of the hoe are themselves brought into a grand cosmological drama."&lt;ref&gt;http://faculty.washington.edu/garmar/CosmologicalHoeSumer.pdf Martin, Gary., The Cosmological Hoe,

[[File:Nicopolis synoecism.svg|thumb|250px|"Communities participating in the synoecism of Nikopolis and the boundaries of the territory."]]
'''Synoecism''' or '''synecism''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ᵻ|ˈ|n|iː|s|ɪ|z|əm}} {{respell|si|NEE|siz-əm}}; {{lang-grc|συνοικισμóς}}, ''sunoikismos'', {{IPA-el|syːnɔi̯kismós|anc}}), also spelled '''synoikism''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ᵻ|ˈ|n|ɔɪ|k|ɪ|z|əm}} {{respell|si|NOY|kiz-əm}}), was originally the amalgamation of villages in [[Ancient Greece]] into ''poleis'', or city-states.  Etymologically the word means "dwelling together (''syn'') in the same house (''oikos'')." Subsequently, any act of civic union between polities of any size was described by the word ''synoikismos''. The closest analogy today is the incorporation of a city; in fact, "incorporation" is often used to translate synoikismos, in addition to the Latinized synoecism. Synoecism is opposed to Greek dioecism (διοικισμóς, ''dioikismos''), the creation of independent communities within the territory of a polis.

Synoecism is the result of a few major factors, mainly an increase in population density of adjacent settlements, with an incorporation proposed for economic, political or ideological advantages, such as the synoecism of the communities of [[Attica]] into [[Athens]], or by imposition of a ruling power, such as the synoecism of [[Messenia]] into the newly built city of [[Messene]]. 

A dioecism is essentially the inverse of a synoecism, the releasing of cities, towns or villages from their association with a polis. This process might manifest itself in several ways, such as the settling of new but independent communities within former territory of [[Constantinople]] on land abandoned due to a contraction of population, or the contraction of [[Thessaloniki]] out of its former neighborhoods outside the city walls due to the occupation of the countryside by the Turks.&lt;ref name="dop57"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.doaks.org/DOP57/DP57ch03.pdf |title=Dumbarton Oaks, Papers, No. 57: Symposium on Late Byzantine Thessaloniki |type=extract |first=Charalambos |last=Bakirtyis |contribution=The Urban Continuity and Size of Late Byzantine Thessalonike |editor-first=Alice-Mary |editor-last=Talbot |year=2004 |origyear=2003 |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Trustees for Harvard University, Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection |pages=40–41, 64 |accessdate=2007-04-03 |format=[[PDF]] |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221202637/http://www.doaks.org/DOP57/DP57ch03.pdf |archivedate=February 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A conqueror might break up a polis for various reasons. As part of the settlement of the [[Third Sacred War]] in 346 BC, the [[Amphictyonic League]] was commissioned to destroy 21 or 22 cities of [[Phocis (ancient region)|Phocis]], many of which had already been burned. They chose the method of dioecism, returning the ''poleis'' to their constituent ''kōmai'', or villages. The city fortifications were then dismantled. This relatively mild destruction was reversed by Athens and Thebes several years later. They were sympathetic to Phocis but their hands had been legally tied. The cities were re-synoecized. The larger states assisted Phocis to rebuild the fortifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=An inventory of archaic and classical poleis | editor1-first= Mogens Herman | editor1-last= Hansen | editor2-first= Thomas Heine | editor2-last=Nielsen | contribution= Phokis | first = Jacques | last=Oulhen | year=2004 | location= Oxford | publisher= Oxford University Press | pages = 400–1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General concept==

Although there were differences between synoecism in [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome]], the same general concept is deduced from the history of both civilizations. Before political union, the future (combined) population of the polity constituted smaller settlements that were not obligated to each other, or at least not by the contract that was later to institute their political union. A settlement or group of settlements might be constituents of another polity from which they would be annexed or transferred.

==In ancient Greece==
In [[ancient Greece]], society was divided into the ''[[deme|demos]]'' (δῆμοι, κῶμαι; "country people" or "country villages") and the "asty" (ἄστυ) or "[[polis]]" (πόλις). The polis was the situs of the princely [[nobility]], gentry, and aristocracy and the sacerdotal and martial families. The distinction between the "demos" and the "polis" was politically very important in these ancient states. There was much antagonism between the two bodies of the country and city. Where commerce and trade came to dominate culture and ideology, they encouraged men to live together in larger towns and develop democracies. In the city states of classical Greece, synoecism occurred when the "demos" combined with and subordinated, usually by force, the "politiea" in one polity.&lt;ref name="rahe"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rahe|first=Paul A |title= Republics Ancient and Modern|year=1994|series=I|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location= Chapel Hill and London |chapter=20 | page = 323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''poleis'', the ''synoikistes'' was the person who according to tradition executed the synoecism, either by charisma or outright conquest; he was subsequently worshiped as a demi-god. The most famous ''synoikistes'' was the mythic and legendary [[Theseus]], who liberated [[Attica, Greece|Attica]] from [[Knossos|Cretan]] hegemony and restored the independence of [[Greece]] under the leadership of [[Athens]].

===In Greek democracies===
In ancient [[Athens]], the villages of [[Attica]] combined with the polis of Athens; consequently the "demos" and "polis" became identical in Athens and the former word assumed preference to denote the whole polity. Popular government was first established in the wealthy and populous Greek cities in [[Ionia]].&lt;ref name ="muller1"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Müller | first1 = Karl Otfried | author1-link = Karl Otfried Müller| first2 = Henry | last2 = Tufnell | author2-link = Henry Tufnell | first3 = George Cornewall | last3 = Lewis | author3-link = George Cornewall Lewis | title = The History and Antiquities of the Doric Race | edition = 2nd | series = 2 | year = 1839 | publisher = John Murray | pages = 72, 72–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this history the word and concept of "democracy" is derived. This synoecism was one of the primary causes of [[the Kyklos]] in ancient [[Ancient Greece|Hellas]].

Synoecism also occurred in the history of [[Mantineia]]. In the fifth century, after its synoecism, it became a democracy; in the fourth century, it was again divided ("''dioikismos''") and an [[oligarchy]] formed. Later, more political upheaval caused another synoecism, thus instituting another democracy.&lt;ref name="rahe" /&gt; This further occurred in the other [[Arcadia|Arcadian]] towns of [[Tegea]] and [[Heraia, Arcadia|Heraia]].

===In Greek oligarchies===
Ancient Greek states not democratically governed used the word "polis" in their public documents to signify sovereign power. The [[Dorians|Doric]] states of [[Crete]] and [[Sparta]] preserved the polis separate from the demos. As late as the second century AD, Cretan towns continued to denote themselves with "polis". [[Sparta]], however, deviating from this use of the word, denominated itself "damos" (δᾶμoς) in ancient laws, because it never thought of itself as a body opposed to the Perioeci.&lt;ref name="muller1" /&gt;

[[Karl Otfried Müller|Müller]] states: "In [[Oligarchy|oligarchical]] states, as in Elis, the people in later times remained almost constantly in the country; and it frequently happened that grandfathers and grandchildren had never seen the town: there were also country courts of justice, and other regulations intended to make up for the advantages of a city life. Where the courts of justice were at a distance, and there was no inducement to mechanical industry and internal commerce (see the term [[banausos]]), the ancient habits of life continued much longer in existence."&lt;ref name="muller1" /&gt;

== In ancient Rome ==
In [[ancient Rome]], some of the kinds of settlement that were incorporated by synoecism into greater municipal polities were the prefecture (''praefectura''), a non-autonomous village administered by a prefect; the ''oppidum'', a fortified, autonomous town; the ''castellum'', a small fortified place under or previously under martial jurisdiction; the ''forum'', being a marketplace; the ''conciliabulum'', being a meeting place; the ''vicus'', being a small, private settlement without government; the ''[[canabae]]'', being a settlement of dependents in the vicinity of a base; the ''[[pagus]]'', being a rural village; the ''gens'', being a tribal canton; the ''saltus'', being a settlement of ''coloni'' (farmers) on a large estate, part of which they leased from the ''conductor'' (manager); and the ''[[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]]'', being a settlement of colonists from [[Rome]].{{Sfn | Abbott |Johnson|1926|pp= 10-20}}

== As an archaeological site ==
"Synoecism" also denominates an ancient [[Minoan civilization|Cretan]] archaeological site on the western fringes of [[Troullos]]. Artifacts discovered at the site include a [[terracotta]] bull figurine, a bronze statuette, and [[Minoan pottery|Late Minoan I pottery]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6465">'''Timothy Charles William Blanning''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (born 21 April 1942) is a historian and retired academic. Between 1992 and 2009, he was Professor of Modern European History at the [[University of Cambridge]].

== Career ==
Timothy Charles William Blanning was born on 21 April 1942. After attending the [[King's School, Bruton|King's School]] in [[Bruton]], he went up to [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge]], graduating with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree and then continuing to complete his [[doctorate]] there; his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] was awarded in 1967. In 1965, he was elected to a research fellowship at Sidney Sussex, and in 1968 was elected to a fellowship there. In the meantime, he was appointed to an assistant lectureship at the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1972, being promoted to lecturer four years later. He was promoted again to be Reader in Modern European History in 1987, and was appointed Professor of Modern European History in 1992. He retired in 2009, but remains at Cambridge as an [[emeritus]] professor.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/abstract/10.1093/ww/9780199540884.001.0001/ww-9780199540884-e-7829 "Blanning, Prof. Timothy Charles William"], ''Who's Who'' (online edition, Oxford University Press, December 2017). Retrieved 17 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research ===
Blanning's first book, ''Reform and Revolution in [[Electorate of Mainz|Mainz]], 1743–1803'' (1974), offered a case study which could examine the [[German Problem]], the idea that modern Germany began moving apart from Western Europe in political and cultural terms; Blanning sought to demonstrate that this process began in the eighteenth century, whereas earlier historians had emphasised the nineteenth century as a more important period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://admin.cambridge.org/sb/academic/subjects/history/british-history-general-interest/reform-and-revolution-mainz-17431803 "Reform and Revolution in Mainz, 1743–1803 "], ''Cambridge University Press''. Retrieved 17 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; His second book, ''The French Revolution in Germany: Occupation and Resistance in the Rhineland, 1792–1802'', was published in 1983, and the French Revolution was also the subject of Blanning's ''The Origins of the French Revolutionary Wars'' (1986), ''The French Revolution: Aristocrats versus Bourgeois?'' (1987; a second edition was published in 1998 as ''The French Revolution: Class War or Culture Clash?'') and ''The French Revolutionary Wars'' (1996). In the meantime, he turned to the Habsburg monarchy and produced a biography of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] in 1994; he has also published biographies of [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] (2017) and [[Frederick the Great]] of [[Prussia]] (2015),&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the latter of which won the [[British Academy Medal]] in 2016.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Since the early 2000s, Blanning's work has also focused on cultural histories of Europe, beginning in 2002 with his book ''The Culture of Power and the Power of Culture''; this was followed by ''[[The Pursuit of Glory|The Pursuit of Glory: Europe 1648–1815]]'' (2006), ''The Triumph of Music: Composers, Musicians and Audiences, 1700 to the Present'' (2008) and ''The Romantic Revolution'' (2011).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Honours==
In 1990, Blanning was elected a [[Fellow of the British Academy]] (FBA).&lt;ref name="FBA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Professor Timothy Blanning|url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/users/professor-timothy-blanning|website=British Academy|accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2016, he was awarded the [[British Academy Medal]] for his book ''[[Frederick the Great: King of Prussia]]'' (2015).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|title=British Academy announces 2016 prizes and medal winners|url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/news/british-academy-announces-2016-prize-and-medal-winners|website=British Academy|accessdate=30 July 2017|date=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blanning was awarded a [[Doctor of Letters]] degree by the University of Cambridge in 1998.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2614">The '''State Museum of Turkmenistan''' (Turkmen: Türkmenistanyň Döwlet Muzeýi), also known as the '''Saparmurat Turkmenbashi Museum''', is a [[museum]] in [[Turkmenistan]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.turkmenistan.ru/ru/node/26631 Museum renamed&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The National Museum of Turkmenistan | url=http://www.unesco.kz/heritagenet/tm/turkmen_site/museum.htm | work=[http://www.unesco.kz/ ALMATY Cluster Office for Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan] | publisher=[[UNESCO]] | accessdate=6 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum was opened on 12 November 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Museum Guidebook, Saparamyrat Türkmenbaşy adyndaky Türkmenistanyň Milli muzeyi, Asgabat 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
. The museum has seven permanent galleries incorporating history, present day culture, and ethnography.&lt;ref&gt;Museum Guidebook, Saparamyrat Türkmenbaşy adyndaky Türkmenistanyň Milli muzeyi, Asgabat 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==
As of 2013, the museum was split into three sections:  natural history, science, and the [[President of Turkmenistan]].  Photography is forbidden in any part of the museum, and all visitors are followed by a museum employee during their stay.  Many artifacts and photographs are clear fakes or digitally edited.

===Natural History===
The museum contains a large collection of ancient artifacts.  However many are overly intricate, in pristine condition, and many thousand years old leading to questions about their authenticity.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

===President===
The museum has one third of its floor space dedicated to the current [[President of Turkmenistan]].  In this section are images of the president doing a wide variety of things, including harvesting crops with his citizens, racing autos, reading with children, playing sports, and meeting world leaders.
===Science===
The section of the museum dedicated to science has no English captions, even though the rest of the museum does.

'''Thomas Ammer''' (born 19 July 1937 in [[Eisenberg, Thuringia|Eisenberg]]) is a [[Germany|German]] historian&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenTA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bundesstiftung-aufarbeitung.de/wer-war-wer-in-der-ddr-%2363%3B-1424.html?ID=46|author1=[[Ilko-Sascha Kowalczuk]]|author2=|title=Ammer, Thomas * 19.7.1937 Aktivist des frühen Widerstands, Mitbegründer des »Eisenberger Kreises« |publisher= Bundesstiftung zur Aufarbeitung der SED-Diktatur: Biographische Datenbanken |accessdate= 12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; who as a young man studied to become a physician.&lt;ref name=BerZeiEis/&gt;

Anti-government political activism in [[East Germany]] led to his arrest and imprisonment in 1958, and he never qualified as a medical doctor.   His 15-year prison sentence was cut short in August 1964 when his release [[:de:Häftlingsfreikaufe|was purchased]] by the [[West Germany|West German]] government, and at the age of 27 he relocated to the [[German Federal Republic]].

==Life==

===Early years===
Thomas Ammer was born in a small town in [[Thuringia]] in what was then central southern Germany.   His parents owned a craft-based business devoted to the production of historical key-board instruments.&lt;ref name=GeraChronik01&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gera-chronik.de/www/gerahistorie/chronik/artikelmitzi/index.htm?suche1=&amp;param=&amp;suche2=&amp;max=1500&amp;abj=1248&amp;index=0|title=19.07.1937 Thomas Ammer geboren (summary paragraph)|author=Mike Strunkowski|publisher=Marco Trampel, Team der Gera Chronik, Gera/Ostviertel|date=|accessdate=12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Ammer's father became associated with Communist opposition groups in 1943, and after 1945 when the ban on it was lifted, joined the [[German Communist Party]]; but he died in January 1946&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenTA/&gt; when Thomas was not yet nine years old.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In 1953  Thomas Ammer and his school fellows including Reinhard Spalke, Günter Schwarz, Ludwig and Wilhelm Ziehr along with Johann Frömel formed a political group which later came to be known in the western media as the [[:de:Eisenberger Kreis|Eisenberger Group]].&lt;ref name=GeraChronik02&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gera-chronik.de/www/gerahistorie/chronik/artikelmitzi/details.htm?id=136C071E574&amp;sf1=&amp;sf2=&amp;suchparam=|title=19.07.1937 Thomas Ammer geboren (Longer entry)|author=Mike Strunkowski|publisher=Marco Trampel, Team der Gera Chronik, Gera/Ostviertel|date=|accessdate=12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The background was the violent military suppression in June 1953 of the [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|strikes and street protests]] convulsing the [[German Democratic Republic]].&lt;ref name=GeraChronik02/&gt;   The group made it their business to highlight examples of politically arbitrary or despotic actions by the authorities.&lt;ref name=GeraChronik02/&gt;   They prepared leaflets and decorated walls and trucks with slogans, anti-government messages&lt;ref name=JugOpTA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jugendopposition.de/index.php?id=3394|title=Thomas Ammer|publisher=Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung und Robert-Havemann-Gesellschaft e.V, Berlin|work=Jugendopposition in der DDR |date=September 2008|accessdate=12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "modified" versions of the logo used by the country's ruling [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED (party)]].&lt;ref name=GeraChronik02/&gt;  Ammer was part of the leadership of the group.&lt;ref name=RobHavTA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.havemann-gesellschaft.de/fileadmin/Redaktion/Ausstellungen-PDF_Fotos/Jugendopposition_Ausstellung/Jugendopp_Ausstellung/Englisch/Jugendopposition_ENG_web_130807_01.pdf |title=Given the recent experience of National Socialism, no one should be able to say that we did not defend ourselves.|work=Youth Opposition in the German Democratic Republic (GDR)|author=|publisher=[[:de:Robert-Havemann-Gesellschaft|Robert Havemann Society ''(Robert-Havemann-Gesellschaft e.V.)'']] (Archiv der DDR-Opposition)|date=|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955 Ammer passed the exams that marked the end of his schooling and went on to study [[Medicine]] at the [[University of Jena|Friedrich Schiller University (FSU)]] in [[Jena]].&lt;ref name=GeraChronik02/&gt;   This greatly extended his network of contacts and the so-called (in retrospect) [[:de:Eisenberger Kreis|Eisenberger Circle]] expanded beyond its base of Eisenberg school students to become a significant opposition movement, albeit not one that ever boasted any sort of structured national organisation.

After 1945 the German Democratic Republic hosted several hundred thousand [[:de:Gruppe der Sowjetischen Streitkräfte in Deutschland|Soviet troops]], but the country made do without any army of its own until the establishment, formally in March 1956, of the [[National People's Army]] (four months after the establishment of the [[Bundeswehr|Federal Army / ''"Bundeswehr"'']] in [[West Germany]]).   This prompted Ammer and other members of the Eisenberger group, on 26 January 1956, to signal opposition to German rearmament by setting fire to a shooting stand belonging to the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Party]] [[Combat Groups of the Working Class|Battle group's]] [[Gesellschaft für Sport und Technik|"Sports and Technology Association"]].&lt;ref name=GeraChronik02/&gt;   Ammer was the man who got hold of the kindling wood and petrol/gasoline needed for the exploit.&lt;ref name=BerZeiEis&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/archiv/10--mai-1957--irgendwann-an-diesem-abend-im--stadtcafe--von-eisenberg-entschied-sich-ein-junger-theologe-zum-verrat-wie-konnte-keller-,10810590,8985004.html|title=Wie konnte Keller?  10.

"We did not want to have to face the question that our parents faced from us regarding the Nazi regime:  Why did you do nothing?"

''„Wir wollten uns nicht die Frage stellen müssen, die wir unseren Eltern mit Blick auf das Nazi-Regime stellten: Warum habt ihr nichts getan?“''

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Starting with information obtained from the theology student, the [[Stasi]] launched a lengthy investigation process, apparently in May 1957.   On 13 February 1958 they arrested Thomas Ammer and placed him inside the "MfS Investigation Prison" in [[Gera]].   By April 1958 almost 40 from the group had been taken into custody and another five, anticipating arrest, had fled to the safety of [[West Berlin]].   The Gera [[district court]] then handed out prison sentences totaling 116 years to the detainees.   Thomas Ammer himself, seen as the "head" of the group, was sentenced on 27 September 1958, receiving the longest individual sentence, at 15 years, for "Treason against the state" (''"Staatsverrat"'').&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenTA/&gt;  He was taken to the [[:de:Justizvollzugsanstalt Waldheim|Super prison]] at [[Waldheim, Saxony|Waldheim]], later being transferred to the [[Brandenburg-Görden Prison]].&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenTA/&gt;   His final few weeks in detention would be spent inside the Stasi investigation prison at [[Lichtenberg (locality)|Berlin-Lichtenberg]].

On 14 August 1964, after six years in prison, Ammer was among the first of the 33,755 political prisoners to have their freedom purchased under the terms of a (not uncontroversial) [[:de:Häftlingsfreikauf|agreement]] concluded between East and West Germany in 1962.   He was summarily delivered to the [[German Federal Republic]] where he was now able to embark on a period of study that covered [[Political sciences]], [[Law]] and [[History]], which took him to the universities of [[University of Tübingen|Tübingen]], [[University of Bonn|Bonn]] and [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg|Erlangen (by Nuremberg)]].&lt;ref name=GeraChronik02/&gt;   He then took a job editing a magazine based in Switzerland, at the same time becoming an historian at the Social Sciences Academy in [[Erlangen]].&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenTA/&gt;   His work included publishing papers and articles that dealt with the [[German Democratic Republic]] and he was therefore still subject to surveillance from the [[Stasi|East German State Security Ministry]] despite now living and working in [[West Germany]].&lt;ref name=GeraChronik02/&gt;   In 1968 he became a member of the West German [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party (SPD)]], retaining his membership till 1982.&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenTA/&gt;   In 1975 he obtained a research post at the [[:de:Gesamtdeutsches Institut|Complete Germany Institute]] in [[Bonn]].   He stayed with The Institute till [[German reunification|its mandate]] was [[Die Wende|overtaken]] by the march of history and it was dissolved in 1991:  he has lived in nearby [[Euskirchen]], in a small house filled with his books, ever  since.&lt;ref name=BerZeiEis/&gt;   In 1992 he became an "expert member" on the Secretariat of the Commission set up by the German  [[Bundestag]] to [[Vergangenheitsbewältigung|try and resolve some of the issues]] left over from the [[History of East Germany|single-party dictatorship]] that had, till 1990, been the [[German Democratic Republic]].&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenTA/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5019">'''Timaeus''' ({{lang-grc|Τιμαῖος}}&lt;!--not Τίμαιος--&gt;; c.&amp;nbsp;345 BC – c.&amp;nbsp;250 BC) was an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[historian]].

==Biography==
He was born at Tauromenium (modern [[Taormina]]) in [[Sicily]]. Driven out of [[Sicily]] by [[Agathocles of Syracuse|Agathocles]], he migrated to [[Athens]], where he studied [[rhetoric]] under a pupil of [[Isocrates]] and lived for fifty years. During the reign of [[Hiero II of Syracuse|Hiero&amp;nbsp;II]] he returned to Sicily (probably to [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]]), where he died.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Work==
While at Athens he completed his great historical work, the ''Histories'', probably some 40 books. This work was divided into unequal sections, containing the history of Greece from its earliest days till the first [[Punic wars|Punic war]]. The ''Histories'' treated the history of Italy and Sicily in early times, of Sicily alone, and of Sicily and Greece together.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Timaeus devoted much attention to [[chronology]], and introduced the system of reckoning by [[Olympiad]]s. In order to plot chronologies, he employed the years of [[Archon]]s of [[Athens]], of [[Ephor]]s of [[Sparta]], and of priestesses of [[Argos]]. This system, although not adopted in everyday life, was afterwards generally used by the Greek historians.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Timaeus can claim to be the first to recognize in his work the importance of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], which was gaining power.&lt;ref&gt;F.&amp;nbsp;W. Walbank. “Polemic in Polybius,” ''The Journal of Roman Studies'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;52, Parts&amp;nbsp;1 and 2 (1962), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Very few parts of the elaborate work of this historian were preserved after [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]]:{{cn|date=April 2016}}
* Some fragments of the 38th book of the ''Histories'' (the life of [[Agathocles of Syracuse|Agathocles]]);
* A reworking of the last part of his Histories, ''On [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]]'', treating the life of this king of [[Epirus]] until 264&amp;nbsp;BC;
* History of the cities and kings of [[Syria]] (unless the text of the ''[[Suda]]'' is corrupt);
* The chronological sketch (''The victors at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]'') perhaps formed an appendix to the larger work.

Timaeus' work was however well spread in antiquity, as many ancient historians and other writers refer to it, and/or based their work on his writings.

==Reception==
Timaeus was highly criticized by other historians, especially by [[Polybius]], and indeed his unfairness towards his predecessors, which gained him the nickname of '''Epitimaeus''' (Επιτίμαιος, fault-finder), laid him open to retaliation. Polybius was well-versed in military matters and a statesman, Timaeus a bookworm without military experience or personal knowledge of the places he described. The most serious charge against Timaeus is that he willfully distorted the truth, when influenced by personal considerations: thus, he was less than fair to [[Dionysius&amp;nbsp;I of Syracuse]] and [[Agathocles of Syracuse|Agathocles]], while loud in praise of his favourite [[Timoleon]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

On the other hand, as even Polybius admits, Timaeus consulted all available authorities and records. His attitude towards the myths, which he claims to have preserved in their simple form (hence probably his nickname γραοσυλλεκτρία, ''graosyllektria''; '''Old Ragwoman''', or "collector of old wives' tales", an allusion to his fondness for trivial details), is preferable to the rationalistic interpretation under which it had become the fashion to disguise them.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Both [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] and the [[Pseudo-Longinus]] characterized him as a model of "frigidity", although the latter admits that in other respects he is a competent writer.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

[[Cicero]], who was a diligent reader of Timaeus, expresses a far more favourable opinion, specially commending his copiousness of matter and variety of expression. Timaeus was one of the chief authorities used by [[Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus]], [[Diodorus Siculus]], and [[Plutarch]] (in his ''[[Parallel Lives|life of Timoleon]]'').{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Saturday, 6 August==

===Protest march===
On 6 August, an initially peaceful protest was held, beginning at [[Broadwater Farm]] and finishing at Tottenham police station.&lt;ref name="bolesworth"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Bolesworth| first = Sarah|author2=Barry Neild |author3=Peter Beaumont |author4=Paul Lewis |author5=Sandra Laville | title = Tottenham in flames as riot follows protest| work=The Observer| location = London| accessdate =7 August 2011| date = 7 August 2011| url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/06/tottenham-riots-protesters-police}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protest was organised by friends and relatives of Mark Duggan (who was [[Death of Mark Duggan|killed by police on 4 August 2011]]), to assert a perceived unmet need for justice for the family.&lt;ref name="guardian-06-duggan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14423942|title=Tottenham police shooting: Dead man was minicab passenger |work=BBC News  | date=5 August 2011| accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/police-patrol-tottenham-after-riots |title=Tottenham riots are a disgrace, says MP|publisher=Channel4.com |accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rioting occurred shortly after about 120 people marched from Broadwater Farm to Tottenham Police Station via the High Road.&lt;ref name="harrowobserver1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harrowobserver.co.uk/west-london-news/world-uk-news/2011/08/07/eight-officers-hurt-as-riots-erupt-116451-29192283/ |title=Eight officers hurt as riots erupt |publisher=Harrow Observer |date=2011-08-07 |accessdate=2011-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group demanded that a senior local police officer speak to them. They stayed in front of the police station hours longer than originally planned because they were not satisfied with the seniority of the officers available at the time. A younger and more aggressive crowd arrived around dusk, some of whom were armed. Violence broke out following a rumour that police had attacked a 16-year-old girl.&lt;ref name="Guardian-07-peaceful" /&gt;

===Tottenham===

A series of disturbances by people in [[Tottenham]] followed the protest march on 6 August. The rioting occurred shortly after about 120 people marched from Broadwater to Tottenham Police Station via the High Road.&lt;ref name="harrowobserver1"/&gt; Tottenham is in the [[London Borough of Haringey|London borough of Haringey]], which has the fourth highest level of child poverty in London and 8.8% unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/08/context-london-riots www.guardian.co.uk: There is a context to London's riots that can't be ignored]&lt;/ref&gt;

At 22:15, a gang of youths burned down Tottenham's post office.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} From around 22:30, attacks were carried out on [[police car]]s, a [[double-decker bus]] and local businesses and homes. Police vans and officers from the [[Territorial Support Group]] attended the disorder on [[Tottenham High Road]]. Shops windows were smashed and the shops looted by rioters.&lt;ref name="laville"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Laville| first = Sandra| title = Tottenham riot: 'very volatile' situation contained, for now| work=The Guardian| location = London| accessdate =7 August 2011| date = 7 August 2011| url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/07/tottenham-riot-situation-analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fireworks, [[petrol bomb#Britain|petrol bombs]] and other missiles were thrown at police.&lt;ref name="guardian-06-duggan"&gt;{{cite news|title=Tottenham in flames as protesters riot|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/06/police-cars-attacked-tottenham-mark-duggan|work=The Guardian|accessdate=6 August 2011|location=London|date=6 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-six officers were injured, including one who sustained head injuries.

A ''[[The Mail on Sunday|Mail on Sunday]]'' photographer was beaten and mugged.&lt;ref name=gallagher-girl&gt;{{Cite news| last = Gallagher| first = Ian|author2=Steve Farrell | title = Did rock-throwing teenage girl's 'beating' by police spark London riots?

Some of the police were on horseback.&lt;ref name="bolesworth"/&gt;

===Tottenham Hale===
The violent clashes were followed by the looting of [[Tottenham Hale]] retail park, which continued until dawn without police intervention.&lt;ref name="Guardian-07-peaceful"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Lewis| first = Paul| title = Tottenham riots: a peaceful protest, then suddenly all hell broke loose| work=The Guardian| accessdate =7 August 2011| date = 7 August 2011| url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/07/tottenham-riots-peaceful-protest| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gallagher-girl /&gt;

===London incidents===

====Enfield and Ponders End====

On Sunday evening, 7 August, violent disturbances erupted in [[Enfield Town|Enfield]], to the north of Tottenham, among a heavy presence of riot police.&lt;ref name="Guardian-07-organised"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Lewis| first = Paul| title = Trouble spreads to Enfield – and this time it was organised| work=The Guardian| location = London| accessdate =8 August 2011| date = 7 August 2011| url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/07/trouble-enfield-organised}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enfield Town centre, [[Enfield Town Park]] and alleyways between there and the Palace Garden shopping centre were guarded by police. A heavy police presence was seen outside [[Enfield Town railway station]] where people arriving were being searched for security reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heavy police presence in Enfield Town Centre, but no rioting|url=http://www.enfieldindependent.co.uk/news/9182490.Heavy_police_presence_in_Enfield__but_no_rioting/|work=Enfield Independent|accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Riot police arrived in Enfield Town the afternoon of 7 August as several small groups of hooded youngsters arrived in cars, buses and trains. Around 100 people were waiting in small groups in the vicinity of Enfield Town station in Southbury Road.&lt;ref name=enf1&gt;{{cite web|title=Tension builds in Enfield Town as small groups arrive in area|url=http://www.enfieldindependent.co.uk/news/localnews/9182506.Tension_builds_in_Enfield_Town_as_small_groups_arrive_in_area/|work=Enfield Independent|accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disorder ensued around 5:30 when a police car in Church Street was pelted with bricks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Police car trashed by Enfield Town rioters|url=http://www.enfieldindependent.co.uk/news/localnews/9182575.Police_car_trashed_by_Enfield_Town/|work=Enfield Independent|accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shops were attacked, including [[HMV Group|HMV]]'s branch in Church Street.&lt;ref name="enfieldindependent1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enfieldindependent.co.uk/news/9182568.Clashes_between_rioters_and_police_in_Enfield_Town/?ref=mr |title=Clashes between rioters and police in Enfield Town (From Enfield Independent) |work=The Independent |location=UK |accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A police helicopter hovered over the area.&lt;ref name=enf1 /&gt;

At around 19:00, police pushed a group of around thirty youths back onto Southbury Road towards the junction with [[Great Cambridge Road]]. Police dogs were deployed at the scene.&lt;ref name="enfieldindependent1"/&gt; Similar action drove back approximately 50 people along Southbury Road via Queens Street, after a preceding clash with rioters outside a supermarket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= David|last=Hardiman |url=http://www.enfieldindependent.co.uk/news/9182572.Shops_targeted_by_rioters__says_witness/ |title=Shops targeted by rioters in Enfield Town, says witness|work=Enfield Independent |location=London | date= 7 August 2011 |accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 19:30, both [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] officers and reinforcements from [[Kent Police]] cordoned off Enfield, making a "sterile area" to deal with local disturbances, including robberies at Enfield Retail Park.&lt;ref name="guardian2"&gt;{{cite news|author=Sam Jones, Paul Lewis, Matthew Taylor and Ben Quinn |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/08/london-riots-spread-second-night |title=London riots spread south of Thames| work=Guardian |location=London |date=8 July 2011 |accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scenes of Enfield were "reminiscent of Tottenham, though smaller."&lt;ref name="Guardian-07-organised" /&gt;

====Brixton====

Looting spread to Brixton that evening.&lt;ref name="gabbatt1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gabbatt|first=Adam|title=London riots: the third night – live coverage|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blog/2011/aug/08/london-riots-third-night-live|newspaper=The Guardian|date=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six fire engines fought a blaze at a [[Foot Locker]] shoe shop in [[Brixton]].&lt;ref name="channel1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/london-riots-spread |title=Theresa May returns to UK as London riots spread – Channel 4 News |publisher=Channel4.com |accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london24.com/news/crime/brixton_looting_video_shows_unrest_1_987330|title=Brixton looting: Video shows unrest|publisher=London 24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riot police and youths clashed near a local [[Currys]] store that was broken into during the disturbances.&lt;ref name="guardian2"/&gt; Speaking to ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', a local resident described "hundreds" of men and women entering the electrical shop and emerging with TVs and other electrical goods. When police arrived, the looters attacked, throwing rocks and the contents of rubbish bins at officers. A branch of [[Halfords]] was targeted and looted by youths.&lt;ref name="telegraph brixton looting"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ward|first=Victoria|title=Brixton riots: looters hit Currys, Foot Locker and Halfords|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8688357/Brixton-riots-looters-hit-Currys-Foot-Locker-and-Halfords.html|accessdate=8 August 2011|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=8 August 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One Brixton resident said: "People were coming to Brixton from outside the area. I was getting out of Brixton Tube last night about 22:30 and going up the escalator when about 10 teenagers ran up the escalator and pushed me to one side."&lt;ref name="yourlocalguardian1"/&gt; By 11:57, both [[Tesco]] and Foot Locker were targeted by looters. [[Lambeth Council]]'s leader, Councillor Steve Reed said of the mobs in Streatham, "They were looters not rioters."&lt;ref name="streathamguardian1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.streathamguardian.co.uk/news/9183409.UPDATE__Lambeth_Council_leader__They_were_looters_not_rioters_/ |title=UPDATE: Lambeth Council leader "They were looters not rioters".

====Wood Green====

Disorder broke out in Wood Green, two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) from Tottenham, during the early hours of 7 August. Widespread looting&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Riots, fires break out in North London|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/44047155/ns/world_news-europe/#.Tj433WGSk7c|work=MSNBC| date=7 August 2011 |accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; involved around 100 youths who targeted high-street game shops, electrical shops and clothing chains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Lewis| first = Paul| title = Tottenham riot: Sustained looting follows night of violence| work=The Guardian| location = London| accessdate =7 August 2011| date = 7 August 2011| url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/07/tottenham-riot-looting-north-london}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others ransacked local shops on [[A105 road|Wood Green High Road]].&lt;ref name=londondailynews&gt;{{Cite news|title=Police lose control of streets shop owners form local "protection units"|work=The London Daily News|url=http://www.thelondondailynews.com/police-lose-control-streets-shop-owners-form-local-protection-units-p-5381.html|date=7 August 2011|accessdate=7 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004082333/http://www.thelondondailynews.com/police-lose-control-streets-shop-owners-form-local-protection-units-p-5381.html|archivedate=4 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A family-run jeweller was hit.&lt;ref name="watchshop1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watchshop.com/watchnews/Jewellers-targeted-in-London-riots$800693104.html |title=Jewellers targeted in London riots – Watch News |publisher=Watchshop.com |accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 20:00, major rioting had spread to [[Wood Green]], with riot police on hand.&lt;ref name="Guardian-07-peaceful" /&gt; Again, the police did not intervene to stop the looting.&lt;ref name="Guardian-07-peaceful" /&gt; The mostly [[Turks in the United Kingdom|Turkish]] and [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] shop owners along Wood Green, [[Turnpike Lane, Haringey|Turnpike Lane]] and [[Green Lanes (London)|Green Lanes]], [[Harringay]], formed local 'protection units' around their shops.&lt;ref name=londondailynews /&gt;

===Richard Mannington Bowes===
[[File:Springbridge Mews floral tributes.jpg|thumb|right|Floral tributes at the site of the fatal assault. The flowers at the top spell out the word "why".]]

Bowes was a 68-year-old [[British people|British]] retired accountant who died as a result of being attacked in the street in Ealing. He was the fifth fatality related to events associated with the riots.

He was attacked by a mob on 8 August 2011, while attempting to extinguish an arson fire in industrial bins on Spring Bridge Road. The attack left him in a coma. The assault was caught on [[CCTV]] and filmed on mobile phones by associates of the man who hit him.&lt;ref name="sun"&gt;[http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/3750093/Fire-rages-around-riot-hero-Richard-Bowes.html "He paid a terrible price: Fire rages around riot hero"] Anthony Price, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''. 13 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Police officers arrived at 10:45pm in response to reports of looting at the Arcadia shopping centre. They were not wearing protective gear and were outnumbered by approximately 120 rioters. The attack on Bowes was witnessed by several police officers, but they were unable to respond in time. They requested assistance as they were showered with bottles and bricks. Riot squad officers who responded had to push back rioters while being attacked to reach Bowes. A line of officers then held back the rioters as paramedics arrived.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2024839/London-riots-2011-Peter-Firstbrook-saves-Richard-Mannington-Bowes-Ealing-flames.html "Face of the mystery man beaten by mob: Police finally identify victim in critical condition after riot attack"] [[Daily Mail]]. 11 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowes was hailed as a hero for his actions by the media and politicians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metro.co.uk/news/872193-uk-riots-the-heroes-that-emerged-from-the-unrest "UK riots: The heroes that emerged from the unrest"] Metro. 12 August 2011 ''Retrieved 12 August 2011''&lt;/ref&gt; Mayor Johnson was particularly vocal: "I feel desperately sorry and sad for him, and what a hero he is.

Cameron said that the government, police and intelligence services were looking at whether there should be limits on the use of social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook or services such as [[BlackBerry Messenger]] to spread organised disorder, and whether to turn off social networks or stop texting during times of [[social unrest]].&lt;ref name="mirror1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ranger |first=Steve |url=http://www.silicon.com/management/public-sector/2011/08/11/prime-minister-do-we-need-social-media-bans-for-rioters-39747797/ |title=Prime Minister: Do we need social media bans for rioters? &amp;#124; Public Sector |publisher=silicon.com |accessdate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=Ash|title=Government Control of Social Media.

Martin McRobb, the Crown Advocate for CPS Mersey-Cheshire, read out in Chester court that "Jordan Blackshaw and Perry Sutcliffe independently and from the safety of their homes may have thought that it would be acceptable to set up a Facebook page to incite others to take part in disorders in Cheshire." Cheshire Constabulary had discovered that they used a Facebook group that Blackshaw created to promote the rioting. Blackshaw was from Northwich and Sutcliffe was from Warrington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.northwichguardian.co.uk/news/9198918.RIOTS_UPDATE__Crown_prosecutor_makes_statement_over_four_year_sentence/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5398">'''William Duncan Strong''' (1899–1962) was an American [[archaeologist]] and [[anthropologist]] noted for his application of the [[direct historical approach]] to the study of indigenous peoples of [[North America|North]] and [[South America]]. 

==Early life and education==
Strong was born in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]]. 

He initially studied [[zoology]], but he changed his focus to anthropology at the [[University of California Berkeley|University of California, Berkeley]], under the influence of [[Alfred L. Kroeber]], who became his "principal teacher, mentor, and friend".&lt;ref name= Beals72&gt;{{cite book| first= Ralph L. |last= Beals| year= 1972| chapter= Forward | title= Aboriginal Society in Southern California'', by William Duncan Strong''| pages= vii-ix| publisher= Malki Museum Press| place= Banning, California| isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Strong completed his doctorate in 1926.

==Career==
Strong's doctoral dissertation, "An Analysis of Southwestern Society", was published in ''[[American Anthropologist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title= An Analysis of Southwestern Society| first= William Duncan| last= Strong| work= [[American Anthropologist]] |volume= 29| pages= 1-61}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related study of his, ''Aboriginal Society in Southern California'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title= Aboriginal Society in Southern California| first= William Duncan| last= Strong| year=1929| publisher= University of California | work= University of California Publications in American Archaeology and Ethnology| volume= 1| number= 358| place= Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt; presenting his detailed fieldwork among the [[Serrano (people)|Serrano]], [[Luiseño people|Luiseño]], [[Cupeño people|Cupeño]], and [[Cahuilla]] peoples, has been characterized as "one of the earliest and one of the best efforts by a United States anthropologist to combine structural-functional analysis with historical data and interpretation".&lt;ref name= Beals72 /&gt;{{rp|ix}} Strong also conducted ethnographic field research among the [[Naskapi]] of [[Labrador]].{{cn|date= July 2018}} 

Most of Strong's anthropological contributions were specifically in archaeology. His 1935 study, "An Introduction to Nebraska Archaeology",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| work= [[Smithsonian]] Miscellaneous Collections| title= An Introduction to Nebraska Archaeology| first= William Duncan| last= Strong| volume= 93| number= 10| place= Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt; is credited with providing a major impetus for the direct historical approach in archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first1= Gordon R. |last1= Willey | first2= Jeremy A. |last2= Sabloff| year= 1980| title= A History of American Archaeology| edition= 2nd | publisher= W. H. Freeman| place= San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1930s, Strong, [[Waldo Rudolph Wedel]] and [[A. T. Hill]] found archaeological evidence in [[Nebraska]] different from the prehistoric [[Great Plains|Central Plains]] and [[Woodland period|Woodland]] traditions. The evidence was attributed to a new culture called the [[Dismal River culture]], or Dismal River aspect, for its location on the [[Dismal River (Nebraska)|Dismal River basin]] of Nebraska,&lt;ref name=Cassells234&gt;{{cite book| last= Cassells| first= E.

Strong performed pioneering fieldwork in California's [[San Joaquin Valley]], the [[Pacific Northwest]], the American [[Great Plains]], Labrador, and [[Honduras]]. In [[Peru]], he developed statistical methods to [[Seriation (archaeology)|seriate]] [[pottery]] styles and is credited with the discovery of the tomb of the war god [[Ai apaec]] in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| title= William D. Strong| work= Hutchinson Encyclopedia of Biography| year= 2000 |publisher= Helicon| place= Abingdon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Strong held academic positions at the [[University of Nebraska]] and [[Columbia University]]. Among his notable students were the archaeologists [[Waldo Rudolph Wedel|Waldo Wedel]] and [[Gordon Willey]].

'''Xenophon of Athens''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|ɛ|n|ə|f|ən|,_|-|ˌ|f|ɒ|n}}; {{lang-grc-gre|[[wikt:Ξενοφῶν|Ξενοφῶν]]}}, {{IPA-grc|ksenopʰɔ̂ːn|anc}}, ''Xenophōn''; {{circa|430}} – 354 BC) was an ancient Greek [[philosopher]], [[historian]], [[soldier]], mercenary, and student of [[Socrates]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Mercenary#Classic era]]&lt;/ref&gt; As a soldier, Xenophon became commander of the [[Ten Thousand (Greek mercenaries)|Ten Thousand]] at about 29, with noted military historian [[Theodore Ayrault Dodge]] saying of him, “the centuries since have devised nothing to surpass the 
genius of this warrior.” &lt;ref&gt;Dodge, Theodore Ayrault.Alexander; a history of the origin and growth of the art of war from earliest times to the battle of Ipsus, B. C. 301.Boston and New York, Houghton Mifflin Company: 1890, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; He established the precedent for many logistical operations and was among the first to use flanking maneuvers, feints and attacks in depth. He was among the greatest commanders of antiquity.
As a historian, Xenophon is known for recording the history of his time, the late-5th and early-4th centuries BC, in such works as the ''[[Hellenica]]'', which covered the final seven years and the aftermath of the [[Peloponnesian War]] (431–404 BC), thus representing a thematic continuation of [[Thucydides]]' ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]''. 

As one of the [[Ten Thousand (Greek mercenaries)|Ten Thousand]] (Greek mercenaries), Xenophon participated in [[Cyrus the Younger]]'s failed campaign to claim the Persian throne from his brother [[Artaxerxes II of Persia]] and recounted the events in ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'', his most notable history. Like [[Plato]] (427–347 BC), Xenophon is an authority on Socrates, about whom he wrote several books of dialogues (the ''[[Memorabilia (Xenophon)|Memorabilia]]'') and an ''[[Apology (Xenophon)|Apology of Socrates to the Jury]]'', which recounts the philosopher's [[Trial of Socrates|trial]] in 399 BC.

Despite being born an Athenian citizen, Xenophon was also associated with [[Sparta]], the traditional enemy of Athens. His [[oligarchy|pro-oligarchic]] politics, military service under Spartan generals, in the Persian campaign and elsewhere, and his friendship with [[Agesilaus II|King Agesilaus II]] endeared Xenophon to the Spartans. Some of his works have a pro–Spartan bias, especially the royal biography ''[[Agesilaus (Xenophon)|Agesilaus]]'' and the ''Constitution of the Spartans''.

Xenophon's works span several genres and are written in plain-language [[Attic Greek]], for which reason they serve as translation exercises for contemporary students of the [[Ancient Greek]] language. In the ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'', [[Diogenes Laërtius]] observed that, as a writer, Xenophon of Athens was known as the “Attic Muse”, for the sweetness of his diction (2.6).

==Life==
===Early years===
Xenophon was born around 430 BC, near the city of Athens, to Gryllus, of the [[deme]] [[Erchia]] of [[Classical Athens|Athens]]. His father's family were a wealthy equestrian family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/650658/Xenophon |title=Xenophon |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=21 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of his youth is little attested before 401 BC, when he was convinced by his Boeotian friend Proxenus (''Anabasis'' 3.1.9) to participate in the military expedition led by Cyrus the Younger against his elder brother, King Artaxerxes II of Persia.

===''Anabasis''===
{{main|Anabasis (Xenophon)}}

====Expedition with Cyrus====
Written years after these events, Xenophon's book ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'' (Greek: ἀνάβασις, literally "going up")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29na%2Fbasis ἀνάβασις], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; is his record of the entire expedition of Cyrus against the Persians and the Greek mercenaries’ journey home. Xenophon writes that he had asked the veteran Socrates for advice on whether to go with Cyrus, and that Socrates referred him to the divinely inspired [[Pythia]]. Xenophon's query to the oracle, however, was not whether or not to accept Cyrus' invitation, but "to which of the gods he must pray and do sacrifice, so that he might best accomplish his intended journey and return in safety, with good fortune". The oracle answered his question and told him to which gods to pray and sacrifice. When Xenophon returned to Athens and told Socrates of the oracle's advice, Socrates chastised him for asking so disingenuous a question (''Anabasis'' 3.1.5–7).

Under the pretext of fighting [[Tissaphernes]], the Persian [[satrap]] of [[Ionia]], Cyrus assembled a massive army composed of native Persian soldiers, but also a large number of Greeks. Prior to waging war against Artaxerxes, Cyrus proposed that the enemy was the [[Pisidia]]ns, and so the Greeks were unaware that they were to battle against the larger army of King Artaxerxes II (''Anabasis'' 1.1.8–11). At [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]] the soldiers became aware of Cyrus's plans to depose the king, and as a result, refused to continue (''Anabasis'' 1.3.1). However, [[Clearchus of Sparta|Clearchus]], a Spartan general, convinced the Greeks to continue with the expedition. The army of Cyrus met the army of Artaxerxes II in the [[Battle of Cunaxa]]. Despite effective fighting by the Greeks, Cyrus was killed in the battle (''Anabasis'' 1.8.27–1.9.1). Shortly thereafter, Clearchus was invited to a peace conference, where, alongside four other generals and many captains, he was betrayed and executed (''Anabasis'' 2.5.31–32).

====Return====
[[File:Persian Empire, 490 BC.png|thumb|400px|Route of Xenophon and the [[Ten Thousand (Greek mercenaries)|Ten Thousand]]]]
The [[mercenary|mercenaries]], known as the [[Ten Thousand (Greek mercenaries)|Ten Thousand]], found themselves without leadership far from the sea, deep in hostile territory near the heart of [[Mesopotamia]], with a hostile population and armies to deal with. They elected new leaders, including Xenophon himself. 

Dodge says of Xenophon's generalship, "Xenophon is the father of the system of retreat, the originator of all that appertains to the science of rear-guard fighting. He reduced its management to a perfect method. More originality in tactics has come from the Anabasis than from any dozen other books. Every system of war looks to this as to the fountain-head when it comes to rearward movements, as it looks to Alexander for a pattern of resistless and intelligent advance. Necessity to Xenophon was truly the mother of invention, but the centuries since have devised nothing to surpass the genius of this warrior. No general ever possessed a grander moral ascendant over his men. None ever worked for the safety of his soldiers with greater ardor or to better effect." &lt;ref&gt; Dodge, pp. 105-106 &lt;/ref&gt;  
 
Xenophon and his men initially had to deal with volleys by a minor force of harassing Persian missile cavalry. Every day, these cavalry, finding no opposition from the Ten Thousand, moved cautiously closer and closer. One night, Xenophon formed a body of archers and light cavalry. When the Persian cavalry arrived the next day, now firing within several yards, Xenophon suddenly unleashed his new cavalry in a shock charge, smashing into the stunned and confused enemy, killing many and routing the rest. &lt;ref&gt; Witt, p. 123 &lt;/ref&gt;  Tissaphernes pursued Xenophon with a vast force, and when the Greeks reached the wide and deep [[Great Zab]] River, it seemed they were surrounded. However, Xenophon quickly devised a plan: all goats, cows, sheeps and donkeys were slaughtered and their bodies stuffed with hay, laid across the river and sewed up and covered with dirt so as not to be slippery. This created a bridge across which Xenophon led his men before the Persians could get to them. That Xenophon was able to acquire the means of feeding his force in the heart of a vast empire with a hostile population was astonishing. Dodge notes, "On this retreat also was first shown the necessary, if cruel, means of arresting a pursuing enemy by the systematic devastation of the country traversed and the destruction of its villages to deprive him of food and shelter. And Xenophon is moreover the first who established in rear of the phalanx a reserve from which he could at will feed weak parts of his line. This was a superb first conception." &lt;ref&gt; Dodge, p. 107 &lt;/ref&gt; 

The Ten Thousand eventually made their way into the land of the Carduchians, a wild tribe inhabiting the mountains of modern southeastern Turkey. The Carduchians were "a fierce, war-loving race, who had never been conquered. Once the Great King had sent into their country an army of 120,000 men, to subdue them, but of all that great host not one had ever seen his home again." &lt;ref&gt; Witt, p. 136 &lt;/ref&gt; The Ten Thousand made their way in and were fired at by stones and arrows for several days before they reached a defile where the main Carduchian host sat. In  the Battle of the Carduchian Defile, Xenophon had 8,000 men feint at this host and marched the other 2,000 to a pass revealed by a prisoner under the cover of a rainstorm, and "having made their way to the rear of the main pass, at daylight, under cover of the morning mist, they boldly pushed in upon the astonished Carducians. The blare of their many trumpets gave notice of their successful detour to Xenophon, as well as added to the confusion of the enemy. The main army at once joined in the attack from the valley side, and the Carducians were driven from their stronghold." &lt;ref&gt; Dodge, p. 109 &lt;/ref&gt; After heavy mountain fighting in which Xenophon showed the calm and patience needed for the situation, the Greeks made their way to the northern foothills of the mountains at the Centrites River, only to find a major Persian force blocking the route north. With the Carduchians surging toward the Greek rear, Xenophon again faced the threat of total destruction in battle. Xenophon's scouts quickly found another ford, but the Persians moved and blocked this as well. Xenophon, in a cunning tactic reminiscent of that of [[Robert E. Lee]] before the Seven Days Battle, sent a small force back toward the other ford, causing the anxious Persians to detach a major part of their force parallel. Xenophon stormed and completely overwhelmed the force at his ford, while the Greek detachment made a forced march to this bridgehead. This was among the first attacks in depth ever made, 23 years after [[Battle of Delium|Delium]] and 30 years before [[Epaminondas|Epaminondas’]] more famous use of it at [[Battle of Leuctra|Leuctra]].

[[File:Xenophon bust.jpg|thumb|Xenophon, [[Aphrodisias]] Museum.]]
Winter by now arrived as the Greeks marched through Armenia "absolutely unprovided with clothing suitable for such weather" &lt;ref&gt; Witt, p. 166 &lt;/ref&gt;, inflicting more casualties than they suffered during a skillful ambush of a local satrap's force and the flanking of another force in this period (although the lack of winter clothes cannot really be blamed on soldiers prepared for conquering sunny Babylon). At a period when the Greeks were in desperate need of food, they decided upon attacking a wooden castle known to have had storage. The castle, however, was stationed on a hill surrounded by forest. Xenophon ordered small parties of his men to appear on the hill road, and when the defenders fired, one soldier would leap into the trees, and he "did this so often that at last there was quite a heap of stones lying in front of him, but he himself was untouched." Then, "the other men followed his example, and made it a sort of game, enjoying the sensation, pleasant alike to old and young, of courting danger for a moment, and then quickly escaping it. When the stones were almost exhausted, the soldiers raced one another over the exposed part of the road", storming the fortress, which, with most of the garrison now neutralized, barely put up a fight. &lt;ref&gt; Witt, pp. 175-176 &lt;/ref&gt;  

Soon after, Xenophon's men reached [[Trabzon|Trapezus]] on the coast of the [[Black Sea]] (''Anabasis'' 4.8.22). Before their departure, the Greeks made an alliance with the locals and fought one last battle against the [[Colchis|Colchians]], vassals of the Persians, in mountainous country. Xenophon ordered his men to deploy the line extremely thin so as to overlap the enemy, keeping a strong reserve. The Colchians, seeing they were being outflanked, divided their army to check the Greek deployment, opening a gap in their lie through which Xenophon rushed in his reserves, scoring a brilliant Greek victory. &lt;ref&gt; Witt, pp. 181-184 &lt;/ref&gt;

They then made their way westward back to [[Greece]] via [[Üsküdar#Chrysopolis|Chrysopolis]] (''Anabasis'' 6.3.16). Once there, they helped [[Seuthes II]] make himself king of [[Thrace]], before being recruited into the army of the Spartan general [[Thimbron (fl. 400–391 BC)|Thibron]]. The Spartans were at war with Tissaphernes and [[Pharnabazus II]], Persian [[satrap]]s in [[Anatolia]], probably on account of the aforementioned treacherous slaughter of their general Clearchus. Xenophon’s military activity with these Spartans marks the final episodes of the ''Anabasis'' (Books 6–7).

Filled with a plethora of originality and tactical genius, Xenophon's conduct of the retreat caused Dodge to name the Athenian knight the greatest general that preceded Alexander the Great. &lt;ref&gt; Dodge, Theodore Ayrault. Great Captains: A Course of Six Lectures on the Art of War. Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston and New York: 1890. p. 7 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Xenophon's politics==
Xenophon has long been associated with the opposition of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, ''Xenophon'', page 19 (preface): "Xenophon has been called undemocratic in more contexts than can be mentioned." {{ISBN|9780199216185}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Xenophon seems to prefer oligarchy, or at least the aristocracy, especially in light of his associations with Sparta, none of his works explicitly attack democracy, unless his account of democratic proceedings in the Anabasis be interpreted as anti-democracy when deliberations are intimidated by cries of "pelt" if a speaker says something others disagree with. Some scholars&lt;ref&gt;Farrell, Christopher A. 2012. "Laconism and Democracy: Re-reading the Lakedaimoniōn Politeia and Re-thinking Xenophon" in Joanne Paul ed., ''Governing Diversities'', pp. 10–35, Newcastle upon Tyne: Cambridge Scholars Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; go so far as to say his views aligned with those of the democracy in his time. However, certain works of Xenophon, in particular the ''[[Cyropaedia]]'', seem to show his oligarchic politics. This historical-fiction serves as a forum for Xenophon to subtly display his political inclinations.

===''Cyropaedia''===
====Relations between Medes and Persians in the ''Cyropaedia''====
Xenophon wrote the ''Cyropaedia'' to outline his political and moral philosophy. He did this by endowing a fictional version of the boyhood of [[Cyrus the Great]],  founder of the first [[Persian Empire]], with the qualities of what Xenophon considered the ideal ruler. Historians have asked whether Xenophon's portrait of Cyrus was accurate or if Xenophon imbued Cyrus with events from Xenophon's own life. The consensus is that Cyrus’s career is best outlined in the ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' of [[Herodotus]]. But Steven Hirsch writes, "Yet there are occasions when it can be confirmed from Oriental evidence that Xenophon is correct where Herodotus is wrong or lacks information. A case in point involves the ancestry of Cyrus."&lt;ref&gt;Steven W. Hirsch, "1001 Iranian Nights: History and Fiction in Xenophon’s ''Cyropaedia''", in ''The Greek Historians: Literature and History: Papers Presented to A. E. Raubitschek''. Saratoga CA: ANMA Libr, 1985, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus contradicts Xenophon at several other points, most notably in the matter of Cyrus’s relationship with the Median Kingdom. Herodotus says that Cyrus led a rebellion against his maternal grandfather, [[Astyages]] king of Media, and defeated him, thereafter (improbably) keeping Astyages in his court for the remainder of his life (''Histories'' 1.130). The Medes were thus "reduced to subjection" (1.130) and became "slaves" (1.129) to the Persians 20 years before the capture of Babylon in 539 BC.

The ''Cyropaedia'' relates instead that Astyages died and was succeeded by his son Cyaxares II, the maternal uncle of Cyrus (1.5.2). In the initial campaign against the Lydians, Babylonians and their allies, the Medians were led by Cyaxares and the Persians by Cyrus, who was crown prince of the Persians, since his father was still alive (4.5.17).  Xenophon relates that at this time the Medes were the strongest of the kingdoms that opposed the Babylonians (1.5.2). There is an echo of this statement, verifying Xenophon and contradicting Herodotus, in the Harran Stele, a document from the court of [[Nabonidus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Pritchard |editor-first=James B. |title=Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament |publisher=Princeton Univ. Press |edition=3rd |date=1969 |location=Princeton |pages=562–63 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the entry for year 14 or 15 of his reign (542-540 BC), Nabonidus speaks of his enemies as the kings of Egypt, the Medes, and the Arabs. There is no mention of the Persians,
although according to Herodotus and the current consensus the Medians had been made "slaves" of the Persians several years previously. It does not seem that Nabonidus would be completely misled about who his enemies were, or who was really in control over the Medes and Persians just one to three years before his kingdom fell to their armies.

[[File:Persepolis carvings.JPG|thumb|Bas-reliefs of Persian soldiers together with Median soldiers are prevalent in Persepolis. The ones with rounded caps are Median.]]
Other archaeological evidence supporting Xenophon’s picture of a confederation of Medes and Persians, rather than a subjugation of the Medes by the Persians, comes from the bas-reliefs in the stairway at [[Persepolis]]. These show no distinction in official rank or status between the Persian and Median nobility. Although Olmstead followed the consensus view that Cyrus subjugated the Medes, he nevertheless wrote, "Medes were honored equally with Persians; they were employed in high office and were chosen to lead Persian armies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Olmsted |first=A. T. |title=History of the Persian Empire |location=Chicago |publisher=Univ. of Chicago Press |date=1948 |page=37 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A more extensive list of considerations related to the credibility of the ''Cyropaedia’s'' picture of the relationship between the Medes and Persians is found on the ''[[Cyropaedia#Credibility of the Cyropaedia’s account of Cyrus’s rise to power|Cyropaedia]]'' page.

Both Herodotus (1.123,214) and Xenophon (1.5.1,2,4, 8.5.20) present Cyrus as about 40 years old when his forces captured Babylon. In the [[Nabonidus Chronicle]], there is mention of the death of the wife of the king (name not given) within a month after the capture of Babylon.&lt;ref&gt;Pritchard, ''Ancient Near Eastern Texts'', p. 306b.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been conjectured that this was Cyrus’s first wife, which lends credibility to the ''Cyropaedia''’s statement (8.5.19) that Cyaxares II gave his daughter in marriage to Cyrus soon (but not immediately) after the fall of the city, with the kingdom of Media as her dowry. When Cyaxares died about two years later the Median kingdom passed peaceably to Cyrus, so that this would be the true beginning of the Medo-Persian Empire under just one monarch.

====Persians as centaurs====
The ''Cyropaedia'' as a whole lavishes a great deal of praise on the first Persian emperor, [[Cyrus the Great]], on account of his virtue and leadership quality, and it was through his greatness that the Persian Empire held together. Thus this book is normally read as a positive treatise about Cyrus. However, following the lead of [[Leo Strauss]], David Johnson suggests that there is a subtle but strong layer to the book in which Xenophon conveys criticism of not only the Persians but the Spartans and Athenians as well.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, D. M. 2005. "Persians as Centaurs in Xenophon’s ‘Cyropaedia’", ''Transactions of the American Philological Association''. Vol 135, No. 1, pp. 177–207.&lt;/ref&gt;

In section 4.3 of the ''Cyropaedia'' Cyrus makes clear his desire to institute cavalry. He even goes so far to say that he desires that no Persian ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=kalokagaqos&amp;la=greek#Perseus:text:1999.04.0058:entry=kaloka)gaqo/s-contents kalokagathos]'' ("noble and good man" literally, or simply "noble") ever be seen on foot but always on a horse, so much so that the Persians may actually seem to be [[centaur]]s (4.3.22–23). Centaurs were often thought of as creatures of ill repute,  which makes even Cyrus’ own advisors wary of the label. His minister Chrysantas admires the centaurs for their dual nature, but also warns that the dual nature does not allow centaurs to fully enjoy or act as either one of their aspects in full (4.3.19–20).

In labelling Persians as centaurs through the mouth of Cyrus, Xenophon plays upon the popular post-Persian-war propagandistic paradigm of using mythological imagery to represent the [[Greco-Persian Wars|Greco-Persian conflict]]. Examples of this include the wedding of the [[Lapiths]], giantomachy, [[Trojan War]], and [[Amazonomachy]] on the [[Parthenon Frieze|Parthenon frieze]]. Johnson reads even more deeply into the centaur label. He believes that the unstable dichotomy of man and horse found in a centaur is indicative of the unstable and unnatural alliance of Persian and Mede formulated by Cyrus.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, D. M. 2005. "Persians as Centaurs in Xenophon’s ‘Cyropaedia’", ''Transactions of the American Philological Association''. Vol 135, No. 1, pp. 177–207.&lt;/ref&gt; The Persian hardiness and austerity is combined with the luxuriousness of the Medes, two qualities that cannot coexist. He cites the regression of the Persians directly after the death of Cyrus as a result of this instability, a union made possible only through the impeccable character of Cyrus.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, D. M. 2005. "Persians as Centaurs in Xenophon’s ‘Cyropaedia’", ''Transactions of the American Philological Association''. Vol 135, No. 1, pp. 177–207.&lt;/ref&gt; In a further analysis of the centaur model, Cyrus is likened to a centaur such as [[Chiron]], a noble example from an ignoble race. Thus this entire paradigm seems to be a jab at the Persians and an indication of Xenophon’s general distaste for the Persians.

====Against empire/monarchy====
The strength of Cyrus in holding the empire together is praiseworthy according to Xenophon. However, the empire began to decline upon the death of Cyrus. By this example Xenophon sought to show that empires lacked stability and could only be maintained by a person of remarkable prowess, such as Cyrus.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, D. M. 2005. "Persians as Centaurs in Xenophon’s ‘Cyropaedia’", ''Transactions of the American Philological Association''. Vol 135, No. 1, pp. 177–207.&lt;/ref&gt; Cyrus is idealized greatly in the narrative. Xenophon displays Cyrus as a lofty, temperate man. This is not to say that he was not a good ruler, but he is depicted as surreal and not subject to the foibles of other men. By showing that only someone who is almost beyond human could conduct such an enterprise as empire, Xenophon indirectly censures imperial design. Thus he also reflects on the state of his own reality in an even more indirect fashion, using the example of the Persians to decry the attempts at empire made by Athens and Sparta.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, D. M. 2005. "Persians as Centaurs in Xenophon’s ‘Cyropaedia’", ''Transactions of the American Philological Association''. Vol 135, No. 1, pp. 177–207&lt;/ref&gt; Although partially graced with hindsight, having written the ''Cyropaedia'' after the downfall of Athens in the Peloponnesian War, this work criticizes the Greek attempts at empire and "monarchy", dooming them to failure.

====Against democracy====
Another passage that Johnson cites as criticism of monarchy and empire concerns the devaluation of the ''homotīmoi''. The manner in which this occurs seems also to be a subtle jab at democracy. ''Homotīmoi'' were highly and thoroughly educated and thus became the core of the soldiery as heavy infantry. As the name ''homotīmoi'' ("equal", or "same honours" i.e. "peers") suggests, their small band (1000 when Cyrus fought the [[Assyria]]ns) shared equally in the spoils of war.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, D. M. 2005. "Persians as Centaurs in Xenophon’s ‘Cyropaedia’", ''Transactions of the American Philological Association''. Vol 135, No. 1, pp. 177–207.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the face of overwhelming numbers in a campaign against the Assyrians, Cyrus armed the commoners with similar arms instead of their normal light ranged armament (''Cyropaedia'' 2.1.9). Argument ensued as to how the spoils would now be split, and Cyrus enforced a meritocracy. Many ''homotīmoi'' found this unfair because their military training was no better than the commoners, only their education, and hand-to-hand combat was less a matter of skill than strength and bravery. As Johnson asserts, this passage decries imperial meritocracy and corruption, for the ''homotīmoi'' now had to sychophantize to the emperor for positions and honours;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, D. M. 2005. "Persians as Centaurs in Xenophon’s ‘Cyropaedia’", ''Transactions of the American Philological Association''. Vol 135, No. 1, pp. 177–207.&lt;/ref&gt; from this point they were referred to as ''entīmoi'', no longer of the "same honours" but having to be "in" to get the honour. On the other hand, the passage seems to be critical of democracy, or at least sympathetic to aristocrats within democracy, for the ''homotīmoi'' (aristocracy/oligarchs) are devalued upon the empowerment of the commoners (''demos''). Although empire emerges in this case, this is also a sequence of events associated with democracy. Through his dual critique of empire and democracy, Xenophon subtly relates his support of oligarchy.

===''Constitution of the Spartans''===
{{main|Polity of the Lacedaemonians}}
The Spartans wrote nothing about themselves, or if they did it is lost. Therefore, what we know about them comes exclusively from outsiders like Xenophon. Xenophon’s affinity for the Spartans is clear in the Constitution of the Spartans, as well as his penchant for oligarchy. The opening line reads:

{{quote|It occurred to me one day that Sparta, though among the most thinly populated of states, was evidently the most powerful and most celebrated city in Greece; and I fell to wondering how this could have happened. But when I considered the institutions of the Spartans, I wondered no longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Xenophon, Constitution of the Lacedaimonians, chapter 1, section 1|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3atext%3a1999.01.0210%3atext%3dConst.+Lac.|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Xenophon goes on to describe in detail the main aspects of [[Laconia]], handing to us the most comprehensive extant analysis of the institutions of Sparta.

===Old Oligarch===
A short treatise on the ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Pseudo-Xenophon)|Constitution of the Athenians]]'' exists that was once thought to be by Xenophon, but which was probably written when Xenophon was about five years old. The author, often called in English the "Old Oligarch" or Pseudo-Xenophon, detests the democracy of Athens and the poorer classes, but he argues that the Periclean institutions are well designed for their deplorable purposes. Although the real Xenophon seems to prefer oligarchy over democracy, none of his works so ardently decry democracy as does the Constitution of the Athenians. However, this treatise makes evident that anti-democratic sentiments were extant in Athens in the late 5th century BC and were only increased after its shortcomings were exploited and made apparent during the Peloponnesian War.

==Socratic works and dialogues==
Xenophon’s works includes a selection of Socratic dialogues; these writings are completely preserved. Except for the dialogues of [[Plato]], they are the only surviving representatives of the genre of [[Socratic dialogue]]. These works include Xenophon's ''[[Apology (Xenophon)|Apology]], [[Memorabilia (Xenophon)|Memorabilia]], [[Symposium (Xenophon)|Symposium]],'' and ''[[Oeconomicus]]''. The ''Symposium'' outlines the character of [[Socrates]] as he and his companions discuss what attribute they take pride in. In ''Oeconomicus'', Socrates explains how to manage a household. Both the ''Apology'' and ''Memorabilia'' defend Socrates’ character and teachings. The former is set during the trial of Socrates, essentially defending Socrates’ loss and death, while the latter is a defence of Socrates, explaining his moral principles and that he was not a corrupter of the youth.

===Relationship with Socrates===
Xenophon was a student of Socrates, and their personal relationship is evident through a conversation between the two in Xenophon’s ''Anabasis''. In his ''Lives of Eminent Philosophers'', the Greek biographer Diogenes Laertius reports how Xenophon met Socrates. "They say that Socrates met [Xenophon] in a narrow lane, and put his stick across it and prevented him from passing by, asking him where all kinds of necessary things were sold. And when he had answered him, he asked him again where men were made good and virtuous. And as he did not know, he said, ‘Follow me, then, and learn.’ And from this time forth, Xenophon became a follower of Socrates."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Laertius |first=Diogenes |title=thegreatthinkers.org |url=http://thegreatthinkers.org/xenophon/introduction/ |website=Great Thinkers |accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diogenes Laertius also relates an incident "when in the [[battle of Delium]] Xenophon had fallen from his horse" and Socrates reputedly "stepped in and saved his life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers|last=Laertius|first=Diogenes|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=Socrates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Xenophon's admiration for his teacher is clear in writings such as ''Symposium'', ''Apology'', and ''Memorabilia''.  Xenophon was away on his Persian campaign during the trial and death of Socrates. Nevertheless, much of Xenophon's Socratic writing, especially ''Apology'', concerns that very trial and the defence Socrates put forward.

===Socrates: Xenophon vs. Plato===

Both Plato and Xenophon wrote an ''Apology'' concerning the death of Socrates. The two writers seem more concerned about answering questions that arose after the trial than about the actual charges. In particular, Xenophon and Plato are concerned with the failures of Socrates to defend himself. The Socrates that Xenophon portrayed was different from Plato’s in multiple respects. Xenophon asserts that Socrates dealt with his prosecution in an exceedingly arrogant manner, or at least was perceived to have spoken arrogantly. Conversely, while not omitting it completely, Plato worked to temper that arrogance in his own ''Apology''. Xenophon framed Socrates’ defense, which both men admit was not prepared at all, not as failure to effectively argue his side, but as striving for death even in the light of unconvincing charges. As Danzig interprets it, convincing the jury to condemn him even on unconvincing charges would be a rhetorical challenge worthy of the great persuader.&lt;ref&gt;Danzig, Gabriel. 2003. "Apologizing for Socrates: Plato and Xenophon on Socrates’ Behavior in Court." Transactions of the American Philological Association. Vol. 133, No. 2, pp. 281–321.&lt;/ref&gt; Xenophon uses this interpretation as justification for Socrates’ arrogant stance and conventional failure. By contrast, Plato does not go so far as to claim that Socrates actually desired death, but seems to argue that Socrates was attempting to demonstrate a higher moral standard and teach a lesson, although his defence failed by conventional standards. This places Socrates in a higher moral position than his prosecutors, a typical Platonic example of absolving "Socrates from blame in every conceivable way."&lt;ref&gt;Danzig, Gabriel. 2003. "Apologizing for Socrates: Plato and Xenophon on Socrates’ Behavior in Court." Transactions of the American Philological Association. Vol. 133, No. 2, pp. 281–321.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical reality===
Although Xenophon claims to have been present at the ''Symposium'', this is impossible as he was only a young boy at the date which he proposes it occurred. And again, Xenophon was not present at the trial of Socrates, having been on campaign in [[Anatolia]] and [[Mesopotamia]]. Thus he puts into the latter’s mouth what he would have thought him to say. It seems that Xenophon wrote his ''Apology'' and  ''Memorabilia'' as defences of his former teacher, not to explain Socrates' relationship to the actual charges incurred.&lt;ref&gt;Danzig, Gabriel. 2003. "Apologizing for Socrates: Plato and Xenophon on Socrates’ Behavior in Court." Transactions of the American Philological Association. Vol. 133, No. 2, pp. 281–321.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern reception===
Xenophon's standing as a political philosopher has been defended in recent times by [[Leo Strauss]], who devoted a considerable part of his philosophic analysis to the works of Xenophon, returning to the high judgment of Xenophon as a thinker expressed by [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury]], [[Michel de Montaigne]], [[Montesquieu]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], [[Francis Bacon]], [[John Milton]], [[Jonathan Swift]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], and [[John Adams]].

Xenophon’s lessons on leadership have been reconsidered for their modern-day value. Jennifer O’Flannery holds that "discussions of leadership and civic virtue should include the work of Xenophon ... on public education for public service."&lt;ref&gt;O’Flannery, Jennifer. 2003. "Xenophon’s (The Education of Cyrus) and Ideal Leadership Lessons for Modern Public Administration." Public Administration Quarterly. Vol. 27, No. 1/2, pp. 41–64.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Cyropaedia'', in outlining Cyrus as an ideal leader having mastered the qualities of "education, equality, consensus, justice and service to state," is the work that she suggests be used as a guide or example for those striving to be leaders (see [[mirrors for princes]]). The linking of moral code and education is an especially pertinent quality subscribed to Cyrus that O’Flannery believes is in line with modern perceptions of leadership.&lt;ref&gt;O’Flannery, Jennifer. 2003. "Xenophon’s (The Education of Cyrus) and Ideal Leadership Lessons for Modern Public Administration." Public Administration Quarterly. Vol. 27, No. 1/2, pp. 41–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of works==
Xenophon’s entire classical corpus is extant.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the ''Landmark edition of Xenophon's Hellenika''. In the preface Strassler writes (xxi), "Fifteen works were transmitted through antiquity under Xenophon's name, and fortunately all fifteen have come down to us".&lt;/ref&gt; The following list of his works exhibits the extensive breadth of genres in which Xenophon wrote.

===Historical and biographical works===
* ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'' (also: ''The Persian Expedition'' or ''The March Up Country'' or The ''Expedition of Cyrus''): Provides an early life biography of Xenophon. ''Anabasis'' was used as a field guide by [[Alexander the Great]] during the early phases of his expedition into Persia.

Some commentators, including Getzel M. Cohen, have noted that many Arab and Palestinian spokespeople have stopped calling the State of Israel by its name and have reverted to the expression 'the Zionist entity'.&lt;ref name="Cohen2006p420" /&gt; The expression "Zionist regime" is also seen.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Meaning and intent==
The term is described as a means of expressing hostility towards Israel,&lt;ref name=Kirkpatrick1988p6/&gt; refusing to acknowledge its existence,&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick1988p6" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beker1988p96" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Khalidi2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Said2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nusse1993p105" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marlin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bengio2002p134" /&gt; and denying its legitimacy or right to exist.&lt;ref name="Cohen2006p420" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Suleiman2011p131" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sank1991p289" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Terrill2010p84" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Waines2004p288" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wistrich2010" /&gt; Virginia Q. Tilley argues that the term implies condemnation of the idea of a Jewish state, but not necessarily of a Jewish presence.&lt;ref name="Tilley2005p202" /&gt; Matthew Gray writes that the term denies Israel the status of a "state", and emphasizes Israel's [[Zionism|Zionist]] philosophy. Its use by Arab state media and leaders, even though other terms are equally "politically useful", "reinforces the state's anti-Israel posture and the perception of Israel as a sinister threat".&lt;ref name="Gray2010p132" /&gt; Describing it as "derogatory, indirect language", Darrell Jodock states its intent is to "deny Israel any place in the family of nations".&lt;ref name=Jodock2008p154/&gt; Referring to it as a "common epithet", [[Eric Sundquist]] indicates that it "echoed the Arab view, repeated in the core doctrine of the PLO, that Israel was no state at all but an illegal colonialist excrescence".&lt;ref name="Sundquist2005p333" /&gt;

==Use==

===In the media===
Before 1967, "Zionist entity" was the standard term used by Arabs and the Arab media to refer to Israel,&lt;ref name="Suleiman2011p131" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kadhim2004pviii/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitchell2000p48" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mahoney2007" /&gt; and was particularly popular in official broadcasts of Egypt, Syria, and Jordan during the 1960s and '70s.&lt;ref name=Oz1995p4/&gt; The use of this term has persisted since then in Egyptian newspapers,&lt;ref name=Muravchik2009p179/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lindquist2003p116/&gt; the [[State media|state-controlled press of Syria]],&lt;ref name="Miller1997p315" /&gt; [[Lebanon]]'s ''[[Al-Manar]]'',&lt;ref name=Victor2003p119/&gt; and the [[Jordan]]ian media.&lt;ref name="Terrill2010p84" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lindquist2003p116/&gt; It is also the only term for Israel used on [[Radio Méditerranée]], a French radio station with a daily audience of around 600,000 "mainly French people of Arab descent".&lt;ref name="Wistrich2010" /&gt;

===Political===
The phrase "Zionist entity" is used by some Arab states,&lt;ref name="Patai1989p179" /&gt; and by "politicians and intellectuals throughout the Arab world".&lt;ref name="Humphreys2005p51" /&gt; Lutz Edzard describes it as "the traditional Arabic political term for Israel", stating it is used in Arabic (particularly [[Iraq]]i) international documents.&lt;ref name=Lutz1998p79/&gt; Describing its use in [[Jordan]], Joseph Nevo includes it as part of "Arab rhetoric and its traditional reluctance to use the term 'Israel'".&lt;ref name="Nevo2006p101" /&gt; Middle East journalist Barbara Victor writes that when she went to Tripoli in 1986 to interview [[Muammar Gaddafi]], it was illegal to use any term except "Zionist entity" to refer to Israel.&lt;ref name=Victor2003p119/&gt; It has been used regularly at the [[United Nations]], by (among others) [[Libya]], [[Syria]], [[Iraq]], [[Yemen]],&lt;ref name="Beker1988p96" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Selbourne" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lutz1998p79" /&gt; and the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]].&lt;ref name="Liskofsky1988p51" /&gt; It is also used by [[Iran]],&lt;ref name=Selbourne/&gt; and by groups such as [[Hezbollah]],&lt;ref name="Waines2004p288" /&gt; [[al-Quds Brigades]],&lt;ref name=Bookmiller1990p102/&gt; [[Hamas]],&lt;ref name=Selbourne/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nusse1993p105" /&gt; the [[Palestinian Authority]], and the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO).&lt;ref name=Selbourne/&gt; Use by the latter became "less prominent" in the late 1980s after the [[Camp David Accords]] and PLO recognition of Israel,&lt;ref name="Jesse2010p305" /&gt; but has since become common again.&lt;ref name="Cohen2006p420" /&gt;

===Other===
In his book ''After the Last Sky: Palestinian Lives'', [[Edward Said]] writes that the one of the differentiators between [[Arab citizens of Israel]] and other Palestinians was that the former referred to Israel "as a real country, rather than 'the Zionist entity'".&lt;ref name="Said1999p51" /&gt; In a later essay he described the phrase's use by Arabs as "a foolish and wasteful policy".&lt;ref name="Said2004" /&gt;

The Egyptian paper ''[[Al-Ahram]]'' seems to use these kinds of terms even after president El-Sadat began peace-talks with Israel. A clear change in the terminology of this paper happens first after the 'Declaration of Principles'. With some exceptions, the Jordanian paper, ''Al-Ray'', uses this kind of terminology up to the same time as ''Al-Ahram''."&lt;/ref&gt;

"One of the most notorious examples of a congruent extension and a different intension is the traditional Arabic political term for Israel, ''al-kyan as-sahyuni'' 'the Zionist element/entity', as is found frequently in letters and recorded statements in United Nations context. The use of the term ''sahyuni'' in (mainly Iraqi) Arabic international documents is indeed noteworthy... Hence, Israel as a whole is often referred to as ''al-kiyan as-sahyuni'' 'the Zionist entity' or even as ''al-kiyan as-sahyuni al-unsuri'' 'the racist Zionist entity'."&lt;/ref&gt;

"...the Israelis have suffered from repeated invasion, subjection to suicide-attacks, and the view that Israel was not a state like others. The various non-state names given to Israel in the Muslim world have been tokens of it. Of these the commonest—used by Iran, the Saddam Hussein regime, by Hamas, by the Lebanese Shi'ite movement, and many others—has been the term 'Zionist entity', or non-state. In 1991, during the Gulf War, the Iraqi army newspaper described Israel — avoiding its very name — as the 'bastard entity of the Zionists', to which it vowed 'complete annihilation'. The same term, 'Zionist entity', was used by both the Syrian and Iraqi ambassadors to the United Nations in the Security Council debates in February and March 2003, which preceded the invasion of Iraq."&lt;/ref&gt;
