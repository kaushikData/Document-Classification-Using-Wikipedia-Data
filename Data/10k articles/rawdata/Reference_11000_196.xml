}}'''800-The-Info''' (or 1-800-843-4636) was a toll-free [[directory assistance]] (DA) and information service provided in the United States by [[Verizon]].&lt;ref name="Vuong"&gt;{{cite news | last = Vuong | first = Andy| title = Free directory assistance to be tested here | publisher = [[Denver Post]] | date = 2007-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 800-The-Info was subsidized by businesses that purchase advertising space on the service. Callers did not pay for the service, but had to listen to ads.  The service offered local business listings including numbers and addresses.&lt;ref name="Vuong"/&gt;

==How it worked==
Like other advertising supported services, callers use a toll-free number to reach an automated system.  They then can ask for a particular business, or ask for business recommendations by a location in a city.  This type of category search is different from typical 411 requests that focus on asking for specific listings.  At the outset, the system plays an advertisement and there can be other ads later on in the call.  The system can also provide details to the caller's wireless phone via [[text message]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Reidy | first = Chris| title = New directory assistance service from Verizon | publisher = [[Boston Globe]] | date = 2007-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The free-DA market==
Verizon’s service competed with many new entrants providing similar services. [[1-800-FREE-411]] is currently the market leader with reportedly 20 million calls per month in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.free411.com/about/pressreleases/p20070910 | title=Jingle Networks Appoints Brian Roberts as Chief Financial Officer | year = 2007 | accessdate=2007-10-05| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071012181329/http://free411.com/about/pressreleases/p20070910| archivedate= 12 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AT&amp;T]]'s yellow pages,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.1800yellowpages.com | title=1-800-Yellowpages Website | year = 2007 | accessdate=2007-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others, are also now competing for this small but growing segment.  Current growth figures suggest the segment will reach 1.5 billion calls per year in the U.S. by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = | title = Advertiser-Paid Information Services: Understanding Free | version = | publisher = The Pierz Group | date = 2007-05-25  | url = http://www.pierzgroup.com/AvailableReports/images/Advertiser%20Supported%20DA%20Services%20Summary.pdf  | format =  | accessdate = 2007-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly all of these services targeted traditional, paid DA services, rates of which can range from $0.39 on a [[landline phone]] to $1.99 (i.e. Verizon wireless) or more on [[cell phone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.daamerica.com/rates.html | title=DA America | year = 2007 | accessdate=2007-10-05| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070911184450/http://www.daamerica.com/rates.html| archivedate= 11 September 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of pure substitution may bring in new users but it also will capture volume from traditional DA services.

What was not clear for any of these providers is whether there will be enough expansion in advertisers to support the business model.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11260">[[File: Sunrise at Creation.jpg|thumb|right|The sun rises over the circular mound of creation as goddesses pour out the primeval waters around it]]
'''Ancient Egyptian creation myths''' are the [[ancient Egypt]]ian accounts of the [[Creation myth|creation of the world]]. The [[Pyramid Texts]], tomb wall decorations and writings, dating back to the Old Kingdom (2780 – 2250 B.C.E) have given us most of our information regarding early Egyptian creation myths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In all of these myths, the world was said to have emerged from an infinite, lifeless sea when the sun rose for the first time, in a distant period known as ''zp tpj'' (sometimes transcribed as Zep Tepi), "the first occasion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | isbn = 0-521-77483-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different myths attributed the creation to different gods: the set of eight primordial deities called the [[Ogdoad (Egyptian)|Ogdoad]], the self-engendered god [[Atum]] and his offspring, the contemplative deity [[Ptah]], and the mysterious, [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] god [[Amun]]. While these differing [[Cosmogony|cosmogonies]] competed to some extent, in other ways they were complementary, as different aspects of the Egyptian understanding of creation.  

==Common elements==
The different creation myths have some elements in common. They all held that the world had arisen out of the lifeless waters of chaos, called [[Nu (mythology)|Nu]]. They also included a pyramid-shaped mound, called the ''[[benben]]'', which was the first thing to emerge from the waters. These elements were likely inspired by the flooding of the [[Nile|Nile River]] each year; the receding floodwaters left fertile soil in their wake, and the Egyptians may have equated this with the emergence of life from the primeval chaos. The imagery of the pyramidal mound derived from the highest mounds of earth emerging as the river receded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | pages = 24, 27, 30
  | isbn =  0-7054-3503-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sun was also closely associated with creation, and it was said to have first risen from the mound, as the general sun-god [[Ra]] or as the god [[Khepri]], who represented the newly-risen sun.&lt;ref name="Allen 144"&gt;Allen, ''Middle Egyptian'', p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; There were many versions of the sun's emergence, and it was said to have emerged directly from the mound or from a lotus flower that grew from the mound, in the form of a heron, falcon, scarab beetle, or human child.&lt;ref name="Allen 144"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | year = 2003
  | pages = 206–207
  | isbn = 0-500-05120-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common element of Egyptian cosmogonies is the familiar figure of the [[cosmic egg]], a substitute for the primeval waters or the primeval mound. One variant of the [[cosmic egg]] version teaches that the sun god, as primeval power, emerged from the primeval mound, which itself stood in the chaos of the primeval sea.&lt;ref&gt;Leeming, ''Creation Myths of the World'', p.104&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cosmogonies==
The different creation accounts were each associated with the cult of a particular god in one of the major cities of Egypt: [[Hermopolis]], [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]], [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], and [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]].&lt;ref&gt;Fleming and Lothian, ''Way to Eternity'', pp. 24-28.&lt;/ref&gt; To some degree, these myths represent competing theologies, but they also represent different aspects of the process of creation.&lt;ref name="Allen, p. 126"&gt;Allen, ''Middle Egyptian'', p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hermopolis===
The creation myth promulgated in the city of Hermopolis focused on the nature of the universe before the creation of the world. The inherent qualities of the primeval waters were represented by a set of eight gods, called the [[Ogdoad (Egyptian)|Ogdoad]]. The god Nu and his female counterpart Naunet represented the inert primeval water itself; [[Huh (god)|Huh]] and his counterpart [[Hauhet]] represented the water's infinite extent; [[Kek (mythology)|Kek]] and [[Kauket]] personified the darkness present within it; and Amun and [[Amaunet]] represented its hidden and unknowable nature, in contrast to the tangible world of the living. The primeval waters were themselves part of the creation process, therefore, the deities representing them could be seen as creator gods.&lt;ref name=" Allen, p. 126" /&gt; According to the myth, the eight gods were originally divided into male and female groups.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming and Lothian, ''Way to Eternity'', p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; They were symbolically depicted as aquatic creatures because they dwelt within the water: the males were represented as frogs, and the females were represented as [[Snake Goddess|snakes]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, ''Complete Gods and Goddesses'', p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; These two groups eventually converged, resulting in a great upheaval, which produced the pyramidal mound. From it emerged the sun, which rose into the sky to light the world.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming and Lothian, ''Way to Eternity'', pp. 27-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heliopolis===
In [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]], the creation was attributed to [[Atum]], a deity closely associated with Ra, who was said to have existed in the waters of Nu as an inert potential being. Atum was a self-engendered god, the source of all the elements and forces in the world, and the Heliopolitan myth described the process by which he "evolved" from a single being into this multiplicity of elements.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, ''Middle Egyptian'', p. 143–145.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, ''Complete Gods and Goddesses'', pp. 99-100.&lt;/ref&gt; The process began when [[Atum]] appeared on the mound and gave rise to the air god [[Shu (Egyptian deity)|Shu]] and his sister [[Tefnut]],&lt;ref&gt;Fleming and Lothian, ''Way to Eternity'', p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; whose existence represented the emergence of an empty space amid the waters.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, ''Middle Egyptian'', p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; To explain how [[Atum]] did this, the myth uses the metaphor of [[masturbation]], with the hand he used in this act representing the female principle inherent within him.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, ''Complete Gods and Goddesses'', pp. 18, 99.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also said to have "sneezed" and"spat" to produce Shu and Tefnut, a metaphor that arose from puns on their names.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, ''Middle Egyptian'', p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; Next, Shu and Tefnut coupled to produce the earth god [[Geb]] and the sky goddess [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]], who defined the limits of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, ''Middle Egyptian'', p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Geb and Nut in turn gave rise to four children, who represented the forces of life: [[Osiris]], god of fertility and regeneration; [[Isis]], goddess of motherhood; [[Set (mythology)|Set]], the god of chaos; and [[Nephthys]], the female complement of Set. The myth thus represented the process by which life was made possible. These nine gods were grouped together theologically as the [[Ennead]], but the eight lesser gods, and all other things in the world, were ultimately seen as extensions of Atum.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, ''Middle Egyptian'', pp. 144-145.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, ''Complete Gods and Goddesses'', p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memphis===
The Memphite version of creation centered on [[Ptah]], who was the patron god of craftsmen. As such, he represented the craftsman's ability to envision a finished product, and shape raw materials to create that product. The Memphite theology said that Ptah created the world in a similar way.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, ''Middle Egyptian'', pp.172-173.&lt;/ref&gt; This, unlike the other Egyptian creations, was not a physical but an intellectual creation by the Word and the Mind of God.&lt;ref&gt;Seton-Williams, ''Egyptian Legends and Stories'', p.13&lt;/ref&gt; The ideas developed within Ptah's heart (regarded by the Egyptians as the seat of human thought) were given form when he named them with his tongue. By speaking these names, Ptah produced the gods and all other things.&lt;ref name="Lothian, p. 25"&gt;Fleming and Lothian, ''Way to Eternity'', p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Memphite creation myth coexisted with that of [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]], as Ptah's creative thought and speech were believed to have caused the formation of Atum and the Ennead.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, ''Middle Egyptian'', p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Ptah was also associated with [[Tatjenen]], the god who personified the pyramidal mound.&lt;ref name="Lothian, p. 25" /&gt;

===Thebes===
Theban theology claimed that [[Amun]] was not merely a member of the [[Ogdoad (Egyptian)|Ogdoad]], but the hidden force behind all things. There is a conflation of all notions of creation into the personality of [[Amun]], a synthesis which emphasizes how Amun transcends all other deities in his being "beyond the sky and deeper than the underworld".&lt;ref&gt;Hart, ''Egyptian Myths'', p.22&lt;/ref&gt; One Theban myth likened Amun's act of creation to the call of a goose, which broke the stillness of the primeval waters and caused the [[Ogdoad (Egyptian)|Ogdoad]] and [[Ennead]] to form.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming and Lothian, ''Way to Eternity'', pp. 28-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Amun was separate from the world, his true nature was concealed even from the other gods. At the same time, however, because he was the ultimate source of creation, all the gods, including the other creators, were in fact merely aspects of Amun. Amun eventually became the supreme god of the [[Egyptian pantheon]] because of this belief.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, ''Middle Egyptian'', pp.182-183.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amun]] is synonymous with the growth of Thebes as a major religious capital. But it is the columned halls, obelisks, colossal statues, wall-reliefs and hieroglyphic inscriptions of the Theban temples that we look to gain the true impression of Amun's superiority. Thebes was thought of as the location of the emergence of the primeval mound at the beginning of time.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, ''Egyptian Myths'', pp.22-24&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Awn Al-Sharif Qasim''' ({{lang-ar|''' عون الشريف قاسم '''}}) (June 16, 1933 – January 19, 2006) was a prolific [[Sudan|Sudanese]] writer, [[encyclopedist]], a prominent scholar, a powerful community leader, a man of charity and one of Sudan's leading experts on [[Arabic language]] and [[Arabic literature|literature]].

He was a strong advocate of [[Arabic]]/[[Islamic]] culture and its interweaving with [[Culture of Sudan|Sudanese culture]]. Qasim authored more than 70 books in the area of [[Islamic history]] and civilization, Arabic literature, studies in the Sudanese dialect languages.

Along with Professor [[Abdalla Eltayeb]] and Professor Abu Saleem, Qasim was considered one of the scholars who shaped the Sudanese academic scene during the last 3 decades of the 20th century.

== Early life and education ==
[[Image:alsharif2.jpg|thumb|left|Qasim with Sheikh Alsharawi of Egypt 1978]]
Professor Qasim was born in [[Sudan|Sudan's]] ancient city [[Halfayat Almilook]] in 1933.  His father immigrated to Sudan from [[Yemen]] in 1925 and settled in the city of Halfayat Almilook in [[Khartoum North]] and became a known religious figure in the area teaching and educating on [[Islamic sciences]].  Due to this background, Qasim was exposed to a heritage of Islamic and [[Arabic culture]] education since his early childhood that later on shaped his life.

He graduated from the College of Liberal Arts at the [[University of Khartoum]] in 1957.  He earned his [[masters degree]] in 1960 majoring in Arabic and [[Islamic studies]] from the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]], [[University of London]].  In 1967, he earned his [[PhD]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Qasim|first=Awn Al- Sharif|date=1967|title=Main aspects of the social and political content of Basri poetry until the end of the Umayyad era|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1842/18549|journal=|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[University of Edinburgh]] in [[Scotland]].

== Career ==
Qasim served as a minister of religious affairs for 10 years (1971-1981) the longest period served by a minister in all Sudanese governments.  During this period he demonstrated exceptional qualities as a leader and political religious figure and soon became one of the most  popular and beloved ministers in Sudan's 1970s government for his strong work ethics, humbleness and honesty.  He was able to connect with different religious groups and to promote ideas of peace and harmony among these groups.  Qasim continued to write during this period and published dozens of books for the public. After the military coup by [[Omar al-Bashir|Omer Al Bashir]], he was arrested along with other ministers from [[Gaafar Nimeiry|Nimeiri']]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s government.

== Writings ==
In the mid-1990s, he authored the ''[[Sudanese Encyclopedia of Tribes and Genealogies]]'', a pioneer, state of the art series of books for the different Sudanese tribes, their roots and origins.  This project has entitled him to earn [[Az-Zubair Prize for Innovation and Scientific Excellence]], the highest prestigious prize awarded by Sudanese government.  He was also awarded the Egyptian prestigious First Class Golden Award for scientific achievements in 1992 by [[Egypt]]ian [[Hosni Mubarak|President Muhammad Husni Mubarak]].

Qasim also authored ''[[Dictionary of Sudanese Dialects]]'' another valuable source of information on Sudanese culture. His dictionary is used worldwide by scholars as a valuable reference on Sudanese dialects.

The '''BSWW World Ranking''' is a [[ranking system]] for men's national teams in [[beach soccer]], calculated by the sport's developmental body, [[Beach Soccer Worldwide]] (BSWW).&lt;ref name="regulations"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fpf.pt/Portals/0/Documentos/Noticias/Sele%C3%A7%C3%B5es/Futpraia/BSWW%20World%20Ranking%20-%20Update%20October_2016.pdf?ver=2016-11-01-092923-543 |title=Beach Soccer World Ranking Points Distribution 2016 |publisher=Beach Soccer Worldwide |date=October 2016 |accessdate=7 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rankings are currently led by [[Brazil national beach soccer team|Brazil]]&lt;ref name="Current"/&gt; who have held the number 1 spot since May 2017.

The teams (both [[List of men's national football teams|member nations]] of [[FIFA]] – the sport's governing body – and non-members) are ranked using a "points-per-event system", whereby the ranking of the team in the final standings of each event they participate in awards that team a certain amount of points; the teams that accumulate the most points are ranked highest.&lt;ref name="regulations"/&gt;

The rankings were introduced in February 2014 and are updated monthly;&lt;ref name="introduction"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.beachsoccer.com/news/930 |title=Beach Soccer World Ranking, presented! |publisher=Beach Soccer Worldwide |date=6 February 2014 |accessdate=7 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; three teams ([[Russia national beach soccer team|Russia]], [[Portugal national beach soccer team|Portugal]] and [[Brazil national beach soccer team|Brazil]]) have held the top position, of which Russia have spent the longest ranked first.

The ranking system is based upon that which is used to produce the [[FIFA World Rankings]]&lt;ref name="regulations"/&gt; in its parent sport, [[association football]], and since its establishment has been used for such purposes as seeding teams at the [[FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://resources.fifa.com/mm/document/tournament/competition/02/86/87/70/fbswcbahamas2017drawprocedures27.02.2017_neutral.pdf|title=Draw Procedures FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup Bahamas 2017|publisher=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Since the 2000s, [[BSWW]] had been producing a European ranking; it was used to seed the teams in regional events. At each competition the teams played in, they earned points depending on their final position (an approach also adapted for use in the world ranking).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.plazovakopana.cz/clanky/reprezentace/bsww-aktualni-zebricek-evropskych-zemi-2010.html |title=BSWW - aktuální žebříček evropských zemí 2010 |publisher=plazovakopana.cz |date=2010 |accessdate=27 April 2016 |language=Czech |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317185020/https://www.plazovakopana.cz/clanky/reprezentace/bsww-aktualni-zebricek-evropskych-zemi-2010.html |archivedate=17 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

BSWW believed creating a world ranking would help teams, [[football association|national associations]] and fans in understanding the "reality of beach soccer".&lt;ref name="introduction"/&gt;

The ranking was first presented at the 2nd FIFA Beach Soccer Workshop in [[Dubai]] from 22–23 November 2013 to representatives of over 100 national associations who debated the composition of its materialisation.&lt;ref name="introduction"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://beachsoccer.com/news/ii-fifa-beach-soccer-workshop-in-dubai|title=II FIFA Beach Soccer Workshop in Dubai|publisher=Beach Soccer Worldwide|date=22 November 2013|accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In building the initial version of the ranking, BSWW took into account "many aspects and factors" used to create the [[FIFA World Rankings]].&lt;ref name="inital"/&gt; Points earned from events over the previous five years (2009–13) were observed to include the outcomes of the three previous [[FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup|World Cups]], therefore providing "an extensive results record and a solid criteria" for its basis; the results of over 1400 matches from ~100 events were integrated into the ranking. The weight of a team's points was reduced by 20% going back year on year.&lt;ref name="inital"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20140626002018/http://beachsoccer.com/assets/BSWW%20World%20Ranking.pdf|title=BEACH SOCCER WORLD RANKING POINTS DISTRIBUTION 2014|publisher=Beach Soccer Worldwide|date=2014|accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The finalised version was subsequently released on 6 February 2014;&lt;ref name="introduction"/&gt; for succeeding updates, the current calculation method immediately superseded the method use to create the initial ranking.&lt;ref name="inital"/&gt;
==Current calculation method==
''As of October 2016''&lt;ref name="regulations"/&gt;
===Points distribution===
The teams are ranked using a "points-per-event system"; in each event they participate, the teams will earn ranking points (providing the event is sanctioned by [[BSWW]] and/or [[FIFA]]) – the number of points they earn is determined by their placement in the final standings of that event. The higher in the standings the team finishes, the more points they will earn. Runners-up receive 25% less points than the champions; for most subsequent places, they receive 20% less points than the position above (rounded to the nearest 5).

BSWW have divided the different types of competitions on the calendar into seven tiers of prestige for the purposes of the world ranking. Higher tier events that are deemed to be the most prestigious reward teams with more points than lower tier events. 

The following table shows exactly how many points a team will earn per their final position at each type of event:

|+ class="nowrap" | Key:
|-
!Symbol
!Description
|-
|align="center"|{{dagger}} || a) The points on offer vary for each continent due to the perceived strength of the different confederations. Strength is calculated by considering interconfederation matches at the last three FIFA Beach Soccer World Cups. The confederations that win the most points on average from these matches are considered strongest and therefore receive more points in tier 2 tournaments than the weaker ones.

b) Continental championships also act as qualification tournaments to the World Cup (WC). Since the WC hosts qualify automatically, sometimes they do not compete in their respective continental championship. To compensate for their induced absence, the team is automatically awarded with a set of points – the average they have earned from their last three appearances in the championship. 
|-
|align="center"|{{double dagger}} || Category 1 events are organised by BSWW; they involve a larger number of FIFA referees, more BSWW delegates, higher stadium standards and more TV coverage than Category 2 events which are only endorsed by BSWW.

===Points weighting &amp; assessment periods===
Only the total points earned from the above events over the '''last four years''' (counting back from the current month) go towards the team's ranking; points older than four years expire and do not count.

The four years in question are assessed as individual twelve month periods; the total points earned during each period are weighted differently to put an emphasis on the value of points earned more recently. 100% of a team's total points gained during the last twelve months count towards their ranking. However, from the three preceding twelve month periods, only a portion of their points earned during each count towards their ranking; the portion that counts gets smaller the further back in time the period in question is which are 75%, 50% and 25% of their original points totals respectively.

This is illustrated/summarised in the table below:

Three teams have been ranked world number 1, namely [[Russia national beach soccer team|Russia]], [[Portugal national beach soccer team|Portugal]] and [[Brazil national beach soccer team|Brazil]]. The rank leaders have roughly coincided with the team that is reigning World Cup champions during that time.

When the rankings debuted in February 2014, Russia were the inaugural world leaders, having amassing over 5000 points&lt;ref name="introduction"/&gt; thanks to winning the 2011 and 2013 World Cup and [[Euro Beach Soccer League]] (EBSL) titles. Portugal won the next [[2015 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup|World Cup in July 2015]] and the [[2015 Euro Beach Soccer League|EBSL in the August]]; Russia finished third in both. Despite Portugal's successes, they were not enough to knock Russia off the top spot until June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://beachsoccer.com/news/portugal-reel-in-russia-to-top-rankings|title=Portugal reel in Russia to top rankings|publisher=Beach Soccer Worldwide|date=4 July 2016|accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portugal relinquished their world crown to Brazil in May 2017 who immediately took the number 1 ranking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.beachsoccer.com/news/movers-of-the-month-brazil|title=Movers of the Month: Brazil|publisher=Beach Soccer Worldwide|date=7 June 2017|accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only one team has peaked at number 2 without yet going on to reach the top spot which is [[Iran national beach soccer team|Iran]]; [[Switzerland national beach soccer team|Switzerland]] have peaked at number 3, the highest of any [[landlocked country]].{{fact|date=November 2018}}

==''Movers of the Month''==
''Movers of the Month'' is a commendation bestowed by BSWW with the release of each new update to the rankings to give recognition to the team that during that month (providing that they have played) has moved up the rankings the most or the team which has gained the most points. It began with the September 2015 update when [[:de:Power Horse|Power Horse]] became official sponsors of the rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.beachsoccer.com/news/overall-world-ranking-show-many-changes|title=Overall World Ranking show many changes|publisher=Beach Soccer Worldwide|date=2 October 2015|accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Benjamín Carrión Palace''' ({{lang-es|Palacio Benjamín Carrión}}) is a palace and museum in [[Quito]], Ecuador. Named after [[Benjamín Carrión]], it was built in 1946-8. The building is located in the district of [[Itchimbía]], near the border with [[La Mariscal]]. Its south side is adjacent to El Arbolito and was one of the first structures completed in the complex of buildings which create the Cultural Center of Ecuador.&lt;ref name=CCE&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herrera Crespo|first1=Patricio|title=Casa de la Cultura Ecuatoriana|journal=Nuestra Casa|date=2013|pages=9–11|url=http://issuu.com/ccegobec/docs/cceguiainformativa2013web|accessdate=15 May 2015|publisher=Casa de la Cultura Ecuatoriana Benjamin Carrión|location=Quito, Ecuador|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peralta (2003)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peralta|first1=Evelia|last2=Moya Tasquer|first2=Rolanda|title=Quito : patrimonio cultural de la humanidad = Cultural heritage of humanity|date=2003|publisher=TRAMA|location=Quito, Ecuador|isbn=9978-300-02-3|pages=108–109|edition=2.|url=https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=rBc_RtIyzW8C&amp;lpg=PA108&amp;ots}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Black Country Living Museum''' (formerly The '''Black Country Museum''') is an [[open-air museum]] of rebuilt historic buildings in [[Dudley]], [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]], England.&lt;ref name="birm"&gt;[http://www.birminghamuk.com/bclm.htm Black Country Living Museum], accessed 14 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in the centre of the [[Black Country]], 10 miles west of [[Birmingham]]. The museum occupies {{convert|105000|m2|acre|0}} of former industrial land partly reclaimed from a former railway goods yard, disused [[lime kiln]]s, canal arm and former coal pits.

The museum opened to the public in 1978, and has since added over 50 shops, houses and other industrial buildings from around the Metropolitan Boroughs of [[Metropolitan Borough of Dudley|Dudley]], [[Sandwell]] and [[Metropolitan Borough of Walsall|Walsall]] and the City of [[Wolverhampton]] (collectively known as the [[Black Country]]); mainly in a specially built village.  Most buildings were relocated from their original sites to form a base from where demonstrators portray life spanning 300 years of history, with a focus on 1850-1950.

The museum is constantly improving as new exhibits, especially buildings, are being added.

==Background==
[[File:Black Country Museum - geograph.org.uk - 424167.jpg|thumb|right|View towards the Back to Back (Brook Street) houses at the Black Country Living Museum]]
The museum is close to the site where [[Dud Dudley]] first mastered the technique of smelting iron with coal instead of wood [[charcoal]] and making iron enough for industrial use. Having a claim to be "the birthplace of the [[Industrial Revolution]]", the Black Country is famous for its wide range of midsteel-based products from nails to the anchor and anchor chain for the [[RMS Titanic|Titanic]].

The site's coal mining heritage is shown by an underground drift and colliery surface buildings. The museum has a working replica of a [[Newcomen steam engine|Newcomen atmospheric engine]]. [[Thomas Newcomen]]'s invention was first successfully put to use in [[Tipton]] in 1712.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tiptoncivicsociety.co.uk/brief-history-of-tipton.php Brief History of Tipton] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120915100741/http://www.tiptoncivicsociety.co.uk/brief-history-of-tipton.php |date=15 September 2012 }}, accessed 2 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The museum's reconstruction was based on a print engraved by Thomas Barney, filemaker of Wolverhampton, in 1719.&lt;ref name=Newcomen&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=J. S.|title=The Newcomen Engine|year=1986|publisher=Black Country Museum|location=Dudley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electric trams and [[trolleybus]]es transport visitors from the entrance to the village where thirty domestic and industrial buildings have been relocated close to the canal basin. The museum is one of three in the UK with working trolleybuses. The route to the village passes the Cast Iron Houses and a 1930s fairground. A [[narrowboat]] operated by Dudley Canal Trust makes trips on the [[Dudley Canal]] and into the [[Dudley Tunnel]].

On 16 February 2012, the museum's collection was awarded designated status by Arts Council England (ACE),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/news/arts-council-news/designated-status-awarded-collections-bt-archives- |title=Designated status awarded to the collections of BT Archives and Black Country Living Museum |author=Arts Council England |authorlink=Arts Council England |accessdate=20 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130110025858/http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/news/arts-council-news/designated-status-awarded-collections-bt-archives-/ |archivedate=10 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; a mark of distinction celebrating its unique national and international importance.&lt;ref name="Arts Council Designation Scheme"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/what-we-do/raising-standards/designation-scheme/ |title=Designation Scheme |author=Arts Council England |authorlink=Arts Council England |accessdate=20 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122011556/http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/what-we-do/raising-standards/designation-scheme/ |archivedate=22 January 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum is run by the '''Black Country Living Museum Trust''', a [[Charitable organization|registered charity]] under English law.&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|504481|THE BLACK COUNTRY LIVING MUSEUM TRUST}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
[[File:BCLM exhibit 01.jpg|thumb|right|Ruby glass sweet bowl.]]
By the main entrance in the old Rolfe Street Baths are displays of local artefacts encompassing some of the many products which were made by Black Country industry, [[cast iron]] [[Holloware|hollow ware]], animal traps, vehicles, chain, anchors, enamels, weighing scales, laundry irons, nails, locks and [[fire clay]] products. The exhibition includes more fragile items such as glassware, reflecting the centuries-old industry that produced lead [[crystal glass]] and the [[Joseph Chance]] glass works between [[Oldbury, West Midlands|Oldbury]] and [[Smethwick]].

==Mining and lime kilns==
The museum site contained 42 disused mine shafts, most of which had been filled in. Two are preserved, one at [[the Racecourse Colliery]] and Brook Shaft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Black Country Living Museum|title=Collections Homepage|url=http://www.bclm.co.uk/collections.htm#.URUcJfKug40|work=BCLM Website|publisher=Black Country Living Museum|accessdate=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1712, [[Thomas Newcomen]] built the world's first successful steam engine which was used for pumping water from coal mines on Lord Dudley's estates. In 1986, after ten years of research, the museum completed the construction of a full-scale working replica of the engine. The "fire engine" is housed in a brick building from which a wooden beam projects through one wall. Rods hang from the outer end of the beam and operate pumps at the bottom of the mine shaft which raise the water to the surface. The engine has a boiler, a cylinder and piston and operating valves. A coal fire heats water in the boiler which is little more than a covered pan and the steam generated passes through a valve into the brass cylinder above it. The cylinder is more than two metres long and 52&amp;nbsp;centimetres in diameter. The steam in the cylinder is condensed by injecting cold water and the vacuum beneath the piston pulls the inner end of the beam down causing the pump to move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bclm.co.uk/locations/newcomen-engine/8.htm#.UTzsq1eev4w|title=Newcomen Engine - Black Country Living Museum|website=www.bclm.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nail shop is a replica of a back-yard workshop, built in the 1880s from 17 Chapel Street, [[Halesowen]].&lt;ref&gt;Black Country Living Museum (2012) ''Black Country Museum Guide'', p58&lt;/ref&gt; It houses equipment from the Halesowen workshop operated by Sidney Tether in the 1940s.&lt;ref name="Black Country Living Museum 2012 p58"&gt;Black Country Living Museum (2012) ''Black Country Living Museum Guide'', p58&lt;/ref&gt; It is in use on a regular basis by the resident nail maker who demonstrates the skill of forging nails by hand.

The brass foundry was built in 1869 in Shaw Street, [[Walsall]] and closed after the Second World War but re-opened in 1964 by James Powell and used until his death in 1973. The building and its equipment were relocated to the museum in 1986.&lt;ref name="Black Country Living Museum 2012 p58"/&gt; It can be seen in operation when the brass caster demonstrates traditional skills in casting horse brasses, pot hooks and other small items.

The [[rolling mill]] installed at the Birchley Works in [[Oldbury, West Midlands|Oldbury]] in 1923 ceased to operate in 1976 and it was moved to Lord Ward's Canal Arm.&lt;ref&gt;Black Country Living Museum (2012) ''Black Country Living Museum Guide'', p62&lt;/ref&gt; The museum operates the it from time to time using volunteers.

The Anchor Forge was rescued from Isiah Preston's in [[Cradley Heath]].  The steam-hammer was installed second hand in the 1920s to forge parts for ships' anchors and the other equipment including furnace and boiler also came from Prestons.  The building was saved from Johnson's Rolling Mill site in West [[Bromwich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bclm.co.uk/locations/anchor-forge/44.htm#.WRRpjFUrKUk|title=Anchor Forge - Black Country Living Museum|website=www.bclm.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chain maker's shop represents one of the many workshops that made small and medium size chain.&lt;ref name="Black Country Living Museum 2012 p60"&gt;Black Country Living Museum (2012) ''Black Country Living Museum Guide'', p60&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1800s the chain industry was mostly associated with [[Cradley, West Midlands|Cradley]], [[Cradley Heath]], [[Old Hill]], [[Quarry Bank]] and [[Netherton, West Midlands|Netherton]].&lt;ref name="Black Country Living Museum 2012 p60"/&gt; It is operational and the skill of making chain by hand can be watched daily.

An [[Oliver hammer]] was a treadle-operated hammer that forged bolts by forcing red hot lengths of iron into a [[die (manufacturing)|die]].  The machine shop contained several Oliver hammers used to forge special parts to order.  It was founded by Onan Lowe and taken over by T. W. Lench Ltd.

The building contains reconstructed offices, a news room with a digital interpretation of the background to the strike and a large hall which is used for a wide range of activities including theatre performances and concerts.

==1930s fairground==
The 1930s [[fair]]ground located behind the school represents a travelling [[fair]]ground that would have brought entertainment to people in the early 1900s. Such fairs set up on waste ground and for a few days provided thrills, entertainment and a change for those who might never go on holiday.&lt;ref name=fairground&gt;{{cite book|title=Guide Book|year=1991|publisher=Pitkin|isbn=978-0-85372-499-5|pages=15|author=Black Country Living Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection of historic rides includes a [[Helter skelter (ride)|helter skelter]] and the Ark, the latest thing in high-speed rides when introduced in the 1920s. It was updated over the years but not converted into a waltzer. It remains one of the few "fourlift" Arks in the country.&lt;ref name=fairground/&gt;

== Lord Ward's Canal Arm ==
Work began on the boat dock in 1976 and the museum aimed to recreate a typical dock that would have been found on the [[Birmingham Canal Navigations]] (BCN). Docks like the one at the museum would have been formed from recycled wooden boats. They were used to build wooden boats or maintain iron and composite boats.&lt;ref name="BCLM Boats"&gt;{{cite book|last=Black Country Living Museum|title=Black Country Living Museum Guide|year=2012|publisher=Black Country Living Museum|isbn=978-0-9562031-2-0|pages=66/67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BCLM canal.jpg|thumb|right|Dudley Canal Trust boat outside the [[Dudley Tunnel]], behind the Black Country Living Museum.]]

===Trolleybuses===
[[File:Walsall trolleybus 862.jpg|thumb|right|Walsall Corporation trolleybus 862 at the Black Country Living Museum]]
The Black Country Living Museum operates a [[trolley buses|trolleybus]] service on certain days, unlike the tram which is usually operated seven days a week. The route is one of the few double deck trolley bus services left in the world, as most of the world's trolley buses are single deckers.

The museum's fleet numbers three resident trolleybuses from the Black Country's two former trolley bus networks, and one which has been painted to resemble a local trolleybus. Unlike Birmingham's tram service, Birmingham Corporation Trolley Buses never operated in the Black Country. The Resident Fleet is listed below;

*Wolverhampton Corporation Transport 78 – A [[Guy Motors|Guy]] built 1931 Trolleybus that still requires restoration.
*[[Trolleybuses in Wolverhampton|Wolverhampton Corporation Transport]] 433 – A [[Sunbeam Commercial Vehicles|Sunbeam]] with body work by C. H. Roe, this time a W4 built in 1946 which was retired with the rest of Wolverhampton's trolley buses in 1967. Operational.
*[[Trolleybuses in Bradford|Bradford Corporation Transport]] 735 - A [[Karrier]] W built in 1946. Worked with Bradford for all its working life. Undergoing overhaul. Has been painted in Walsall Corporation blue in order to resemble trolleybuses that would have operated nearby.
*[[Trolleybuses in Walsall|Walsall Corporation Transport]] 862 – Another Sunbeam F4A with a Willowbrook Body, it was built in 1955 and retired from Walsall in 1970 on the closure of the trolleybus network. Operational.

===Motor cars===
Wolverhampton was home to some early manufacturers of motor cars, such as [[Sunbeam Motor Car Company|Sunbeam]], [[Clyno]], [[AJS]] and [[Star Motor Company|Star]]. [[Meadows Frisky|Frisky]] cars were also made in Wolverhampton, while the Black Country town of [[Kingswinford]] is home to Westfield cars.

The museum collection includes a 1903 Sunbeam, a 1912 Star and a 1931 AJS as well as examples of later vehicles such as the Kieft, Frisky and Westfield Topaz.

===Motorcycles===
There are approximately 40 motorcycles in the museum's collection, all of which were made in the Black Country. A large proportion were manufactured by [[Sunbeam Motor Car Company|Sunbeam]] and [[AJS]], but there are also examples by firms such as Wearwell Cycle Company and Rockson. The museum is affiliated to the [[British Motorcycle Charitable Trust]].&lt;ref name="British Motorcycle Charitable Trust"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmct.org/index.html|title=British Motorcycle Charitable Trust |author=British Motorcycle Charitable Trust |accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other vehicles===
The museum does not have an extensive collection of Black Country bicycles, but there are examples by manufacturers such as Harry Albino and [[Star Motor Company|Star]].

Unusual vehicles in the fleet include a 1924 [[Guy Motors|Guy]]-[[John Morris and Sons Salford|Morris]] fire engine, a Model T Ford van used by Willenhall firm Brevitt's and a [[Bean Cars|Bean]] of Tipton flatbed truck.

==Other collections==
[[File:Stone bottles - BCLM store.jpg|thumb|Variety of stone bottles in one of the museum's extensive storerooms]]
In addition to the wide range of displayed collections, the museum has extensive research collections held in store. These include historic objects, archival material and library books, all of which can be viewed by appointment.

== Filming location ==
The museum has been used as a set for many film and television productions, particularly [[Peaky Blinders]] drama produced by [[BBC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bclm.co.uk/about/film--tv-location/177.htm|title=Film &amp; TV Location - Black Country Living Museum|website=www.bclm.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Stan &amp; Ollie]]'', a feature film on the life of [[Laurel and Hardy]], shot some of its scenes on the museum's 1930s Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/entertainment/dudley-entertainment/2017/05/13/hollywood-hits-black-country-as-steve-coogan-and-john-c-reilly-shoot-stan-and-ollie-in-dudley/|title=Hollywood hits the Black Country as Steve Coogan and John C Reilly shoot Stan and Ollie in Dudley|first=Clare|last=Butler|website=www.expressandstar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future plans ==
On 15 June 2017 it was announced that the museum had been awarded £9.8 million from the National Lottery towards their £21.7m project BCLM: Forging Ahead, which will allow the museum to tell the story of the Black Country up to the closure of the Baggeridge Coal Mine in 1968. Plans include the translocation, recreation or replication at the Museum of Wolverhampton's Elephant &amp; Castle pub, Dudley's Burgin’s Newsagents, a hairdressers, an NHS clinic, West Bromwich Gas Showroom and Dudley's Woodside Library, and a butchers all dating from the 1940s to the 1960s. The new plans will see the museum space increase by one third. The plans are due to be completed in 2022. It is expected that 60 jobs would be created directly as a result of the expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-40292152|title=Black Country Living Museum move for historical buildings|date=2017-06-15|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-06-15|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bclm.co.uk/news/bclm-forging-ahead-wins-national-lottery-support/836.htm#.WULmRNzTVWw|title=BCLM: Forging Ahead wins National Lottery support - Black Country Living Museum|website=www.bclm.co.uk|access-date=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2754">The '''boat dock''' at the [[Black Country Living Museum]] was built in 1976,&lt;ref name=BCLM&gt;{{cite book|last=Black Country Living Museum|year=2012|publisher=Black Country Living Museum|isbn=978-0-9562031-2-0|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; like many boat docks in the region its buildings are made out of recycled boat timbers from derelict wooden boats. The thousands of boats that used to work the Black Country canals all needed constant maintenance.&lt;ref name="BCLM Web"&gt;{{cite web|last=Black Country Living Museum|title=Interactive Map|url=http://www.bclm.co.uk/locations/the-boat-dock--boat-collection/46.htm#.UQqPIPKug40|accessdate=2013-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this area there were many working boat yards, or docks, like this one, where boats were built and repaired. They were busy, cluttered places not unlike a modern scrap yard as it was common practice to break wooden boats, salvaging the ironwork.&lt;ref name="BCLM Web" /&gt;

Castlefields boat dock is typical of the many on the [[Birmingham Canal Navigations|Black Country canal]] system of the period and is equipped to build new working craft and to repair those of iron or composite construction. The dock can accommodate three boats, drawn sideways out of the water by winches onto the slip. There are a number of different buildings on the boat dock each serving a specific purpose.&lt;ref name="BCLM Web" /&gt;

==Blacksmith's Shop==
Based on an 1880s design the [[blacksmith]] shop would have wrought all the supplies needed for boat repair such as specialist [[nail (fastener)|nails]] and [[Screw|bolts]] and the L shaped boat 'knees' used to reinforce the boat structure. Some blacksmiths may have made [[horseshoes]] for the [[canals]] working horses.&lt;ref name=BCLM /&gt;

==Sheds==
Next to the blacksmiths shop is a series of sheds, the first is made out of the bottom of a recycled boat (see picture). The sheds consist of a nail store and a rivet store which includes a carpenters bench and cast iron stove. At the end of the row is a paint store which would have held all the essentials used in boat painting like red lead, pigments and varnishes. There is also a tackle store with a corrugated roof which would have housed lifting tackle and other boat handling equipment.&lt;ref name=BCLM /&gt;

==Miscellaneous==
The boat dock also featured a toilet (earth closet) and a stable to house the working horses. Horses provided 'hosmuck an' tar' (horsemuck and tar) that was used to seal the wooden boats.&lt;ref name=BCLM /&gt;

'''Raymond Louis Heenan''' (November 1, 1944&lt;!--Do not change! Confirmed by Heenan in his autobiography!--&gt;  – September 17, 2017), better known as '''Bobby''' "'''The Brain'''" '''Heenan''', was an American [[professional wrestling]] [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]], [[color commentator]], wrestler, and [[comedian]], best known for his time with the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA), the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF, now WWE) and [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW).

Frequently described as the greatest professional wrestling manager of all time, he was known for his skill in elevating [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villainous]] on-screen talent by drawing [[heat (professional wrestling)|negative reactions]] for himself and his wrestlers from the crowd. He was paired with numerous wrestlers, including [[Nick Bockwinkel]], whom he led to win the [[AWA World Heavyweight Championship]], and he became an integral figure in the [[1980s professional wrestling boom]] by managing [[King Kong Bundy]] and [[André the Giant]] in WWF main event matches with [[Hulk Hogan]] at [[WrestleMania 2]] and [[WrestleMania III]] respectively.

Known for his quick wit and comedic ability, Heenan also served as a color commentator and is remembered for his on-screen repartee with [[Gorilla Monsoon]]. Heenan retired from full-time appearances in 2000 after a six-year stint as a commentator in WCW but he continued to make sporadic appearances in several promotions. In 2002, he was diagnosed with [[throat cancer]], which limited his appearances in later years, and he died from complications of it in 2017. Outside of wrestling, Heenan authored two books, appeared on numerous television shows, and briefly hosted a parody talk show titled ''The Bobby Heenan Show'' on ''[[WWF Prime Time Wrestling]]''. He was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] [[WWE Hall of Fame (2004)|class of 2004]].

==Early life ==
Raymond Louis Heenan was born in [[Chicago, Illinois]], on November 1, 1944.&lt;ref name="NYT"

==Professional wrestling career==

===World Wrestling Association (1965–1974)===
In 1965, Heenan became a regular in William Afflis' (known by his in-ring persona [[Dick the Bruiser]]) Indianapolis-based [[World Wrestling Association (Indianapolis)|WWA promotion]] under the moniker "Pretty Boy" Bobby Heenan.&lt;ref name="Meltzer"/&gt; That year, he wrestled his first match against Calvin "Prince" Pullins.&lt;ref name=Slam/&gt; Heenan said that he was never trained as a wrestler and that it came naturally to him. He was booked as both a manager and a wrestler after the promoters saw how well he handled the physical aspects of his managerial duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heenan|first1=Bobby|last2=Anderson|first2=Steve|title=Bobby the Brain: Wrestling's Bad Boy Tells All|year=2002|publisher=Triumph Books|isbn=978-1572434653|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time in WWA, he managed [[Angelo Poffo]] and [[Chris Markoff]], the Assassins ([[Guy Mitchell (wrestler)|Guy Mitchell]] and Joe Tomasso), [[The Valiant Brothers]] and [[The Blackjacks]]. In particular, Heenan was credited with making [[Blackjack Lanza]] one of the top wrestling villains in the country.&lt;ref name="Meltzer"/&gt; This impressed promoter [[Sam Muchnick]], who typically hated wrestling managers, and Heenan is believed to be the only heel manager to work in Muchnick's [[St. Louis Wrestling Club]].&lt;ref name="Meltzer"/&gt; He also occasionally wrestled with a storyline "brother" Guy Heenan, portrayed by Guy Mitchell, from the Assassins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The many faces of John Hill|publisher=[[Canoe.com]]|work=Slam!

He attributed his departure to a dispute with Afflis over pay for his participation in the first-ever wrestling event held at [[Market Square Arena]], emphatically stating that he never returned to the promotion as a result.&lt;ref name="PWInsider"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pwinsider.com/article/112347/looking-back-at-the-illustrious-career-of-bobby-the-brain-heenan.html?p=1|title=Looking back at the illustrious career of  Bobby 'The Brain' Heenan|work=Pro Wrestling Insider|last=Johnson|first=Mike|date=September 17, 2017|accessdate=September 18, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918110559/https://www.pwinsider.com/article/112347/looking-back-at-the-illustrious-career-of-bobby-the-brain-heenan.html?p=1|archivedate=September 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===American Wrestling Association (1974–1979)===
After leaving WWA, Heenan announced he was now to be known as "The Brain" at his AWA debut in 1974. He took up managing the team of [[Nick Bockwinkel]] and [[Ray Stevens (wrestler)|Ray "The Crippler" Stevens]], a duo which became several-time [[AWA World Tag Team Championship|AWA World Tag Team Champions]] under his leadership.&lt;ref name="PWInsider"/&gt; While Bockwinkel and Stevens feuded with The Crusher and Dick the Bruiser, Bruiser famously called Heenan "Weasel"; this led to his rivals calling him "Weasel" throughout the rest of his wrestling career.&lt;ref name="PWInsider"/&gt; The AWA was the starting point for the first incarnation of his eponymous heel [[Stable (professional wrestling)|stable]], The [[Heenan Family]], which initially consisted of Bockwinkel, Stevens, [[Bobby Duncum Sr.]], and Blackjack Lanza.&lt;ref name=Slam/&gt;

On January 25, 1975, an angry fan fired a gun at Heenan in Chicago's [[International Amphitheatre]] after Heenan interfered in one of Bockwinkel's matches.&lt;ref name=shooting1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-bobby-heenan-chicago-shooting-column-20171016-story.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180424232418/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-bobby-heenan-chicago-shooting-column-20171016-story.html|title=Column: Remembering the time a fan shot at Bobby 'The Brain' Heenan

While Bockwinkel was AWA Champion in 1976, Lanza and Duncum captured the AWA World Tag Team Championship, making Heenan the first manager in history to simultaneously manage both a major promotion's singles and tag team champions.&lt;ref name=TSun&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2017/09/17/former-wrestling-manager-bobby-the-brain-heenan-dead-at-73|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171125121140/http://torontosun.com/2017/09/17/former-wrestling-manager-bobby-the-brain-heenan-dead-at-73/wcm/b6f33575-4686-478b-a239-7fa67c7ecfc0|title=Former wrestling manager Bobby 'The Brain' Heenan dead at 73|work=[[Toronto Sun]]|last=Van Der Griend|first=Blaine|date=September 17, 2017|accessdate=September 18, 2017|archivedate=November 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Georgia Championship Wrestling (1979)===
In early 1979, Heenan left the AWA (suspended one year, in [[Kayfabe|storyline]]) to work in [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]] (GCW). During his short tenure in GCW, Heenan managed a stable of wrestlers that included the likes of [[Killer Karl Kox]], [[Bill Eadie|Masked Superstar]], [[Ernie Ladd]] and Blackjack Lanza.&lt;ref name=Slam/&gt; Heenan met a young [[Hulk Hogan]] while in Georgia and later told AWA promoter Verne Gagne that he should hire him.&lt;ref name="PWT"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pwtorch.com/site/2017/09/17/bobby-heenan-greatest-pro-wrestling-manager-time-dead-age-73-long-battle-throat-cancer/|title=Bobby Heenan, greatest pro wrestling manager of all-time, dead at age 72 after long battle with throat cancer|work=Pro Wrestling Torch|last=Keller|first=Wade|date=September 17, 2017|accessdate=September 28, 2017|authorlink=Wade Keller|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929000334/https://www.pwtorch.com/site/2017/09/17/bobby-heenan-greatest-pro-wrestling-manager-time-dead-age-73-long-battle-throat-cancer/|archivedate=September 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Heenan, he moved his family to [[Atlanta]] after being told by GCW promoter [[Ole Anderson]] that he could work for the promotion as long as he wanted to only to fire him less than a year later. Anderson admitted to firing him but denied promising him indefinite employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mikemooneyham.com/2004/08/15/books-reunions-reignite-feuds/|title=Books, Reunions Reignite Feuds|work=The Wrestling Gospel|last=Mooneyham|first=Mike|date=August 15, 2004|accessdate=April 26, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917124134/http://www.mikemooneyham.com/2004/08/15/books-reunions-reignite-feuds/|archivedate=September 17, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to AWA (1978–1984)===
In late 1979, Heenan returned to AWA and resumed managing Nick Bockwinkel to renewed championship success, including against Hogan in 1983.&lt;ref name="TSun"/&gt; During AWA's tour of [[Japan]] in 1983, Heenan suffered a neck injury in a match with [[Atsushi Onita]] that would limit his in-ring ability going forward.&lt;ref name="TSun"/&gt;

In 1984, Heenan left AWA to join the [[World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF). While most of the AWA talent left for the WWF during this time without giving proper notice (the AWA required departing talent to work a six-week notice for booking and [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]]-based reasons, with most talent claiming that WWF promoter [[Vince McMahon]] paid them extra ''not'' to work out their notices with the AWA), only Heenan worked out his notice in good faith to the Gagne family.&lt;ref name="PWInsider"/&gt; He was written out of AWA television when [[Wally Karbo]] announced on the September 28 AWA broadcast that Heenan had been suspended indefinitely by AWA President Stanley Blackburn for initiating a brawl with [[Fabulous Ones]].&lt;ref name="TSun"/&gt;

===World Wrestling Federation (1984–1993)===

====Manager (1984–1993)====
Heenan was signed by the WWF in 1984 with the intention of him managing [[Jesse Ventura]], however Ventura's retirement due to blood clots in his lungs prevented this from happening.&lt;ref name="TSun"/&gt; Instead, Heenan managed [[Big John Studd]] in his feud against [[André the Giant]]. Studd challenged André to a [[United States dollar|US$]]15,000 bodyslam match at the first [[WrestleMania (1985)|WrestleMania]], with the stipulation being that André would have to retire had he lost. André won the match and then took the bag with the $15,000 and started throwing it out to the crowd before Heenan snatched the bag.&lt;ref name="TSun"/&gt;

[[File:Andre and Bobby Heenan.jpg|thumb|Heenan (left) managed many of the WWF's top stars, notably leading [[André the Giant]] (right)|alt=Bobby Heenan (front), a Caucasian man in a black sequin jacket, leads André the Giant to the ring]] 
Heenan reformed the Heenan Family,&lt;ref name=Slam/&gt; which over the years in the WWF would include Studd, [[Ken Patera|"Olympic Strong Man" Ken Patera]], [[Buddy Rose|"Playboy" Buddy Rose]], [[Paul Orndorff|"Mr. Wonderful" Paul Orndorff]], [[King Kong Bundy]], André the Giant, [[Sivi Afi|High Chief Sivi Afi]], [[the Brain Busters]] (former [[The Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|Four Horsemen]] members [[Arn Anderson]] and [[Tully Blanchard]]), [[Rick Rude|"Ravishing" Rick Rude]], [[Harley Race|"King" Harley Race]], [[The Islanders (professional wrestling)|the Islanders]] ([[Tonga Fifita|Haku]] and [[Sam Fatu|Tama]]), [[Hercules (wrestler)|Hercules]], [[The Barbarian (wrestler)|The Barbarian]], [[Curt Hennig|Mr. Perfect]], [[Terry Taylor|The Red Rooster]], and [[Steve Lombardi|The Brooklyn Brawler]].&lt;ref name="miamiherald"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/sports/fighting/article173893081.html|title=RIP: A life look at WWE Hall of Famer Bobby 'The Brain' Heenan|last=Varsallone|first=Jim|date=September 17, 2014|accessdate=September 18, 2017|work=[[Miami Herald]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170919005504/http://www.miamiherald.com/sports/fighting/article173893081.html|archivedate=September 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heenan and the Heenan Family had a feud with [[Hulk Hogan]] in the 1980s, and Heenan managed two [[WrestleMania]] challengers to Hogan's title, King Kong Bundy in [[WrestleMania II|1986]], and André the Giant in [[WrestleMania III|1987]]. While neither Bundy nor André won the title at that time, André later bested Hogan for the championship on ''[[WWF The Main Event|The Main Event]]'' on February 5, 1988, in a controversial win after he aligned himself with [[Ted DiBiase|"The Million Dollar Man" Ted DiBiase]].&lt;ref name="PWInsider"/&gt;

After being derided by announcers for his first five years in the WWF (mostly by Gorilla Monsoon) for never managing a champion, [[WrestleMania V]] was promoted (mostly by Jesse Ventura and later Gorilla Monsoon) as Heenan's quest, and best chance since [[WrestleMania III]] to manage a champion. Heenan finally managed his first champion in the WWF when "Ravishing" Rick Rude upset [[The Ultimate Warrior]] for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Championship]], a match Heenan insured Rude would win by holding Warrior's leg down so he could not break the pin.&lt;ref name="Slam"/&gt; Shortly thereafter, he led the Brain Busters to win the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF World Tag Team Championship]].&lt;ref name="WWFTag"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/3044541321111211 |title=WWE: History of the World Tag Team Championship|accessdate=April 26, 2018|publisher=WWE|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319053122/http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/3044541321111211|archivedate=March 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Busters had lost the titles back to [[Demolition (professional wrestling)|Demolition]] a few months later,&lt;ref name="WWFTag"/&gt; he led the [[The Colossal Connection|Colossal Connection]] (André and Haku) to win the Tag Team Championship when they defeated Demolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Royal Duncan &amp; Gary Will | title=Wrestling Title Histories | publisher=Archeus Communications | year=2006|edition=4th | isbn=0-9698161-5-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Demolition would win the titles back in [[WrestleMania VI]].&lt;ref name="WM6"/&gt; Immediately after the loss, Heenan began blaming the loss to [[André the Giant]] going as far as slapping him.&lt;ref name="WM6"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.prowrestling.net/article.php?Powell-s-WrestleMania-6-review-Hulk-Hogan-vs.-Ultimate-Warrior-for-the-WWF-Championship-and-Intercontinental-Championship-Ted-DiBiase-vs.-Jake-Roberts-Andre-the-Giant-and-Haku-vs.-Demolition-for-the-WWF-Tag-Titles-36460|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918154303/http://www.prowrestling.net/article.php?Powell-s-WrestleMania-6-review-Hulk-Hogan-vs.-Ultimate-Warrior-for-the-WWF-Championship-and-Intercontinental-Championship-Ted-DiBiase-vs.-Jake-Roberts-Andre-the-Giant-and-Haku-vs.-Demolition-for-the-WWF-Tag-Titles-36460|title=Powell's WrestleMania 6 review: Hulk Hogan vs. Ultimate Warrior for the WWF Championship and Intercontinental Championship, Ted DiBiase vs. Jake Roberts, Andre the Giant and Haku vs. Demolition for the WWF Tag Titles|date=April 5, 2014|accessdate=September 18, 2017|archivedate=September 18, 2017|last=Powell|first=Jason|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months after that, he led Mr. Perfect to Intercontinental Championship success.&lt;ref name="80s"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shields|first=Brian|title=Main Event: WWE in the Raging 80s|year=2010|publisher=WWE Books|isbn=978-1416532576|pages=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heenan also wrestled sporadically in his WWF run. In his in-ring debut at [[Madison Square Garden]] in November 1984, he pinned [[Salvatore Bellomo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/84.htm|accessdate=January 9, 2018|publisher=The History of WWE|title=The Omni – 1984|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ph1kKm14?url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/84.htm|archivedate=May 19, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heenan's most notable victory came at [[WrestleMania IV]], teaming with The Islanders to defeat [[The British Bulldogs]] and [[Koko B.

Heenan retired from managing in 1991 to become a full-time commentator. Nonetheless, Heenan crossed the line to managing sporadically. When the WWF signed [[Ric Flair]], Heenan spent several weeks talking Flair up as "The Real World's Heavyweight Champion", appearing onscreen with Flair's [[Big Gold Belt]].&lt;ref name="NYP"/&gt; He continued to act as an adviser to Flair during his WWF run from 1991 to 1993. Though he nominally managed Flair, Heenan's former protégé Mr. Perfect, who temporarily retired due to injury, would regularly accompany Flair to ringside as his "Executive Consultant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Kevin |last= Sullivan |year= 2010 |title= The WWE Championship: A Look Back at the Rich History of the WWE Championship |publisher= WWE Books |location= New York |isbn= 1439193215 |page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Royal Rumble (1993)|1993 Royal Rumble]], he introduced [[Lex Luger|"The Narcissist" Lex Luger]] to the WWF to exact revenge on his former protégé, Mr. Perfect.&lt;ref name="Luger"&gt;Wrestling 93: Rulebreaker, Spring 1993 Issue, Article "Bobby Heenan and Lex Luger: The Total Package of Brain and Brawn!", pp.48–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Commentator (1986–1994)====
[[File:Brooklyn Brawler &amp; Bobby Heenan.jpg|thumb|right|Heenan became a commentator while in the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]], but continued to manage various wrestlers, such as [[Steve Lombardi|The Brooklyn Brawler]] (behind Heenan)|alt=Bobby Heenan, dressed in a black sequin jacket, leads The Brooklyn Brawler to the ring in the late 1980s]]
In 1986, WWF owner Vince McMahon took full advantage of his microphone and comedic skills and Heenan became a [[color commentator]] in addition to his managing duties. He replaced Jesse Ventura on ''[[WWF Primetime Wrestling|Prime Time Wrestling]]'' and ''[[WWF All American Wrestling (show)|All American Wrestling]]'', aired on the [[USA Network]], teaming up with [[Gorilla Monsoon]]. He also replaced Ventura to team up with Monsoon on the syndicated ''[[WWF All-Star Wrestling|All-Star Wrestling]]'', which was replaced in the fall of 1986 with ''[[WWF Wrestling Challenge|Wrestling Challenge]]''. Although the purpose of these shows were to summarize weekly WWF events, viewers tuned in to see Heenan and Monsoon's interactions.&lt;ref name="NYP"/&gt; Heenan, calling himself a "broadcast journalist",&lt;ref name="PWHOF"/&gt;  bashed fan favorites and cheered for their opponents while they cheated or did something under-handed.&lt;ref name="Guzzo"/&gt; He referred to the fans as "humanoids", and fan favorites, especially [[Job (professional wrestling)|enhancement talent]], as "ham-and-eggers." Another moment between the pair often occurred when Heenan would go on a long rant supporting the villainous wrestlers, until an exasperated Monsoon would say either: "Will you stop?", "Give me a break!", or a sarcastic, "Please!"&lt;ref name="PWInsider"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ESPN"/&gt;

Heenan, still suffering from the broken neck he received ten years earlier and unable to cope with the long working hours, decided to leave the WWF at the end of 1993. He was given an on-air farewell by Gorilla Monsoon on the edition of December 6, 1993 of ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'', broadcast from the [[Westchester County Center]] in [[White Plains, New York]]. Fed up by Heenan's constant insults, Monsoon threw him and his belongings out of the arena and onto the street. After the show, Heenan stated that he and Monsoon embraced each other and wept for over an hour in the hotel where they both were staying.&lt;ref name="TSun"/&gt;

Heenan's original plan was to retire, spend time with his family, and relax, but he was contacted by WCW soon after he left the WWF. He was unsure at first, but accepted their offer once he found out that WCW provided lighter work schedules and health insurance. Heenan also cited the short driving distance between WCW's home base of [[Atlanta]] and his daughter's school in [[Alabama]].&lt;ref name=Gerweck&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gerweck.net/heenaninterview.htm|title=Bobby Heenan Interview|publisher=gerweck.net|accessdate=August 24, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930155123/http://www.gerweck.net/heenaninterview.htm|archivedate=September 30, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PWInsider"/&gt;

===World Championship Wrestling (1994–2000)===
On January 27, 1994, Heenan made his debut in [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW). He was originally brought in to replace [[Jesse Ventura]], his former client, as the color commentator for ''[[WCW Saturday Night]]'' and eventually took over Ventura's position as the company's lead commentator, replacing him for pay-per-view events and on the syndicated ''[[WCW Worldwide]]'' and ''[[Clash of the Champions]]'' events produced for [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]]. When ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]'' premiered in September 1995, Heenan left ''Saturday Night'' to work on the new show full-time and joined former [[Chicago Bears]] defensive lineman [[Steve McMichael]] as an analyst alongside play-by-play man [[Eric Bischoff]].&lt;ref name="TSun"/&gt; He was later frequently paired with [[Tony Schiavone]].&lt;ref name="PWT"/&gt;

In 1996, Heenan made a one-off return to ringside at [[The Great American Bash (1996)|The Great American Bash]] as the manager of two of his former clients, Ric Flair and Arn Anderson, in a tag team match against his broadcast colleague McMichael and then-[[Carolina Panthers]] linebacker [[Kevin Greene (American football)|Kevin Greene]]. Heenan was instrumental in convincing McMichael to turn on his partner, which enabled Flair and Anderson to win the match, and fill the open spot in [[Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|The Four Horsemen]] that [[Brian Pillman]] left behind when he departed the company earlier in the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2007 Wrestling Almanac &amp; Book of Facts: Great American Bash 1996|work=Wrestling's Historical Cards|publisher=Kappa Publishing|year=2007|pages=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the following pay-per-view, [[Bash at the Beach (1996)|Bash at the Beach 1996]], Heenan reacted incredulously when Hulk Hogan walked out during the main event match between [[The Outsiders (professional wrestling)|The Outsiders]] ([[Kevin Nash]] and [[Scott Hall]]) and [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]], [[Lex Luger]] and [[Randy Savage]] by shouting "Whose side is he on?"&lt;ref name="TSun"/&gt; Hogan subsequently turned his back on the fans and joined Hall and Nash to form the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]] (nWo). Despite no longer being a fan favorite, Heenan continued to bash Hogan on commentary by gloating that he had been right about him all along, continuing a rivalry that dated back to their time in AWA.&lt;ref name="SI"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2017/09/18/bobby-heenan-wwe-bruce-prichard-jimmy-hart|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005100850/https://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2017/09/18/bobby-heenan-wwe-bruce-prichard-jimmy-hart|title=Bruce Prichard, Jimmy Hart share their favorite Bobby 'The Brain' Heenan memories|last=Barrasso|first=Justin|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=September 18, 2017|accessdate=October 4, 2017|archivedate=October 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in late January 2000, WCW replaced Heenan on ''Monday Nitro'' and pay-per-view events with [[Mark Madden]]. Heenan continued to commentate on ''[[WCW Thunder|Thunder]]'' along with [[Mike Tenay]], and later Schiavone, until he was replaced by [[Stevie Ray]] beginning in July 2000. Heenan was then only seen with Scott Hudson on ''Worldwide'' until he was released by WCW in November 2000.&lt;ref name=Slam&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/heenan.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180303074432/http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/heenan.html|title=Bobby Heenan's Slam!

WCW went out of business less than a year after his release.&lt;ref name=Daytona&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daytondailynews.com/sports/local-wrestling-star-bobby-heenan-was-the-greatest-manager-ever-but-even-greater-friend/rqfJvhYWSOal0bNbVUld4J/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007120355/http://www.daytondailynews.com/sports/local-wrestling-star-bobby-heenan-was-the-greatest-manager-ever-but-even-greater-friend/rqfJvhYWSOal0bNbVUld4J/|title=Local Wrestling Star: Bobby Heenan was the greatest manager ever, but an even greater friend|work=[[Dayton Daily News]]|last=Bethel|first=B.J.|date=September 20, 2017|accessdate=October 7, 2017|archivedate=October 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career (2001–2009)===
On April 1, 2001, Heenan returned to the WWF and provided commentary to the Gimmick Battle Royal match at [[WrestleMania X-Seven]] alongside [[Gene Okerlund|"Mean" Gene Okerlund]].&lt;ref name="TSun"/&gt; Heenan was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] [[WWE Hall of Fame (2004)|class of 2004]] (WWF changed its name to WWE in 2002) by [[Blackjack Lanza]]. The following night, he appeared at [[WrestleMania XX]] in a skit with Gene Okerlund, [[Mae Young]] and [[The Fabulous Moolah]].&lt;ref name=Slam/&gt; He inducted his protégés [[Paul Orndorff]], [[The Blackjacks]] and [[Nick Bockwinkel]] into the WWE Hall of Fame [[WWE Hall of Fame (2005)|class of 2005]], [[WWE Hall of Fame (2006)|class of 2006]] and [[WWE Hall of Fame (2007)|class of 2007]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/exclusives/heenanbockwinkel|title=No "Weasel-ing" out for Heenan|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=August 24, 2007|last=Dee|first=Louie|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070528112410/http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/exclusives/heenanbockwinkel |archivedate = May 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his last WWE appearance, he was one of the speakers for "Mr McMahon appreciation night" on the June 11, 2007 episode of ''Raw''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/results/raw/raw2006/1181620600.shtml|title=Raw Results – 6/11/07 – Wilkes Barre, PA (2007 WWE Draft &amp; more)|last=Golden|first=Hunter|work=WrestleView|date=June 11, 2017|accessdate=August 24, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806064045/http://www.wrestleview.com/results/raw/raw2006/1181620600.shtml|archivedate=August 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heenan made several appearances on the [[independent circuit]]. In February 2001, Heenan did color commentary for the ''[[Women of Wrestling|WOW Unleashed]]'' pay-per-view. Also in 2001, Heenan worked briefly as a "[[sports agent]]" in the [[Xcitement Wrestling Federation]] with [[Curt Hennig]] under his tutelage.&lt;ref name="PWInsider"/&gt; In 2004, he feuded with fellow manager [[Jim Cornette]] in [[Ring of Honor]].&lt;ref name="2004ROH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rohwrestling.com/content/2004-ring-honor-results|title=2004 Ring of Honor Results|publisher=[[Ring of Honor]]|accessdate=September 28, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730201810/http://www.rohwrestling.com/content/2004-ring-honor-results|archivedate=July 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite declining health in his final years, Heenan continued to make appearances at fan conventions. He enjoyed staying in touch with former colleagues and fans.&lt;ref name="PWT"/&gt;

==Other media==

===Health and death===
In January 2002, Heenan announced that he had [[Esophageal cancer|throat cancer]].&lt;ref name="Meltzer"/&gt; By 2004, the cancer had gone into remission.&lt;ref name="Guzzo"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guzzo|first1=Paul|title= Wrestling star Bobby "The Brain" Heenan of Largo is dead at 72|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/obituaries/wrestling-star-bobby-the-brain-heenan-of-largo-is-dead-at-73/2337830|work=[[Tampa Bay Times]]|date=September 17, 2017|accessdate=September 25, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170920092651/http://www.tampabay.com/news/obituaries/wrestling-star-bobby-the-brain-heenan-of-largo-is-dead-at-73/2337830|archivedate=September 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The  treatments caused a great deal of weight loss, dramatically altering his appearance and voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/bobby-heenan-dies-wrestling-1.4294811|title=Bobby Heenan, legendary pro wrestling manager, dead at 73|date=September 18, 2017|publisher=[[CBC News]]|accessdate=September 25, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170919235841/http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/bobby-heenan-dies-wrestling-1.4294811|archivedate=September 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last few years of his life, he suffered a series of falls.

On September 17, 2017, Heenan died at the age of 72 while surrounded by family at his home in [[Largo, Florida]]. His cause of death was [[organ failure]] due to complications from the throat cancer that had been in remission since 2004.&lt;ref name="Guzzo"/&gt;

Rosenberg stated that Heenan "operated on multiple levels", adding: "If you were a little kid, he was the foil to your hero. As an adult, you look back and appreciate just how much of a comedic genius he was."&lt;ref name="ESPN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/20746914/wwe-bobby-brain-heenan-lasting-impact-world-professional-wrestling|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003224838/http://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/20746914/wwe-bobby-brain-heenan-lasting-impact-world-professional-wrestling|title=Bobby "The Brain" Heenan helped shape the world of professional wrestling|publisher=[[ESPN]]|last=Rosenberg|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Rosenberg|date=September 18, 2017|accessdate=October 3, 2017|archivedate=October 3, 2017|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Longtime on-screen rival Hulk Hogan wrote in the foreword to Heenan's ''Bad Boy Tells All'': "Bobby was a legendary wrestler ... He will go down in the books as someone who mastered the craft".&lt;ref name="indy"/&gt; These comments were echoed by [[Triple H]], who said that Heenan was one of the best in-ring talents but chose to be a manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAbEWf_9K38|title=Triple H: Bobby Heenan Wasn't Just a Manager, One of the Greatest Wrestlers Ever|work=[[TMZ|TMZ Sports]]|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=September 18, 2017|accessdate=October 3, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170930140927/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAbEWf_9K38|archivedate=September 30, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Wade Keller]] states that what sets him apart from other managers was his ability to take "tremendous [[bump (professional wrestling)|bumps]]" (falls to the mat after being attacked). Pro wrestling historian George Schire praised his in-ring ability, commenting: "Bobby was a good athlete – flipping over the ropes, he could do it all. And whether it was as the manager or as a wrestler, he could get the crowd going as well as anyone."&lt;ref name="PWT"/&gt;

His comedic ability was praised by [[Dave Meltzer]] of the ''[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]'', who wrote that Heenan could have been a successful television actor.&lt;ref name="Meltzer"/&gt; Comedian [[David Letterman]] became a fan of Heenan after seeing him in WWA.&lt;ref name="indy"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pro wrestling icon Bobby Heenan dies at 72|url=http://www.indystar.com/story/entertainment/arts/2017/09/18/pro-wrestling-icon-bobby-heenan-dies-72/676063001/|archiveurl=https://www.indystar.com/story/entertainment/arts/2017/09/18/pro-wrestling-icon-bobby-heenan-dies-72/676063001/|first=David|last=Lindquist|date=September 17, 2017|accessdate=October 2, 2017|work=[[Indy Star]]|archivedate=April 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; WWE Hall of Fame commentator [[Jim Ross]] selected Heenan as the greatest talent in the history of the wrestling business. Ross praised Heenan's ability as a color commentator, stating: "He was naturally funny ... and enhanced every single talent, including the heroes, even though Bobby did not support the fan favorites as the bad guy announcer. [Heenan] did what every announcer should strive to do and that is to make talent bigger stars than they are and to embellish every talent's TV persona."&lt;ref name=ross&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/classics/jim-ross/jim-ross-gorilla-monsoon-bobby-heenan-26041707|title=Jim Ross on Bobby Heenan, Gorilla Monsoon|date=July 31, 2012|publisher=WWE|last=Ross|first=Jim|authorlink=Jim Ross|accessdate=October 2, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902143753/http://www.wwe.com/classics/jim-ross/jim-ross-gorilla-monsoon-bobby-heenan-26041707|archivedate=September 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PigotDirectory1839Kent.jpg|thumb|An example page from [[Pigot's Directory|Pigot's 1839 directory]] of businesses in the counties of Kent, Surrey and Sussex in England.]]
A '''business directory''' is a website or [[print media|printed]] listing of [[information]] which lists businesses within niche based categories. Businesses can be categorized by niche, location, activity, or size. Business may be compiled either manually or through an automated online search software. Online [[yellow pages]] are a type of business directory, as is the traditional [[phone book]].

The details provided in a business directory may vary. They may include the business name, addresses, telephone numbers, location, contact information, type of service or products the business provides, the number of employees, the served region and any [[professional association]]s. Some directories include a section for user reviews, comments, and feedback. Business directories in the past would take a printed format but have recently been upgraded to websites due to the advent of the internet.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Many business directories offer complimentary listings in addition to the premium options. There are many business directories and some of these have moved over to the [[internet]] and away from printed format. Whilst not being [[search engine]]s, business directories often have a search function, enabling users to search businesses by [[Zip Code]], country, state, area or city.

== Formats ==
Business directories can be in either [[hard copy]] or in [[Digital formats|digital format]]. Ease of use and distribution means that many trade directories have a digital version.

{{wikt|confer}}
The abbreviation '''cf.''' (short for the {{lang-la|confer/conferatur}}, both meaning "compare")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=cf.|work=Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=n.d.|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/cf|accessdate=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used in writing to refer the reader to other material to make a comparison with the topic being discussed. It is used to form a contrast, for example: "Abbott (2010) found supportive results in her memory experiment, unlike those of previous work (cf. Zeller &amp; Williams, 2007)."&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;{{cite|title=It’s All Latin to Me: Latin Abbreviations in Scholarly Writing|first=Chelsea|date=May 13, 2010|website=APA Style Blog|publisher=American Psychological Association|last=Lee|url=http://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2010/05/its-all-latin-to-me.html|accessdate=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is recommended that "cf." be used only to suggest a comparison, and the word "see" be used to point to a source of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=Latin Terms and Abbreviations|website=The Writing Center at UNC-Chapel Hill|publisher=The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|date=n.d.|url=http://writingcenter.unc.edu/handouts/latin-terms-and-abbreviations/|accessdate=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://msupress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/ContagionStyleSheet.pdf |title=Chicago Manual of Style 15th Ed. Style Sheet |publisher=Michigan State University Press |at=p. 6, citing ''Chicago Manual of Style'' section 16.58 |accessdate=2016-07-07 |quote=There is a distinction between see and cf.; use cf. only to mean 'compare' or 'see, by way of comparison'.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological use==
In [[Open nomenclature|biological naming conventions]], cf. is commonly placed between the [[genus name]] and the [[species name]] to describe a specimen that is difficult to identify because of practical difficulties, such as the specimen being poorly preserved. For example, "''{{lang|la|Barbus}}'' cf. ''{{lang|la|holotaenia}}''" indicates that the specimen is in the genus ''[[Barbus]]'', and believed to be ''{{lang|la|[[Barbus holotaenia]]}}'' but the actual species-level identification cannot be certain.&lt;ref name="Bengtson"/&gt;

Cf. can also be used to express a possible identity, or at least a significant resemblance, such as between a newly observed specimen and a known [[species]] or [[taxon]].&lt;ref name="Bengtson"&gt;{{cite web |last=Bengtson |first=Peter |title=Open Nomenclature |url=http://cdn.palass.org/publications/palaeontology/volume_31/pdf/vol31_part1_pp223-227.pdf |work=Palaeontology |accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a usage might suggest a specimen's membership of the same genus or possibly of a shared higher taxon, such as in, "{{lang|la|Diptera: Tabanidae}}, cf. ''{{lang|la|Tabanus}}''", where the author is confident of the order and family ([[Diptera]]: [[Tabanidae]]), but can only offer the genus (''[[Tabanus]]'') as a suggestion and has no information favouring a particular species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|first=Anne|last=Hartmann|url=http://www.assess-hkh.at/downloads/Field_Key_HKH_draft.pdf|title=Field Key for Selected Benthic Invertebrates from the HKH Region|version=Daft Version|date=February 2007|accessdate=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37370">The '''comparative ranks of Nazi Germany''' contrasts the [[Military rank|ranks]] of the German [[Wehrmacht]] to a number of [[Nazi Party|national-socialist organisations]] in [[Nazi Germany]] from 1933 to 1945 in a synoptic table. Nazi organisations used a hierarchal structure, according to the so-called ''[[Führerprinzip]]'' (leader principle), and were oriented in line with the rank order system of the Wehrmacht.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Hermann Weiß |title=Biographisches Lexikon zum Dritten Reich |language=German |publisher=Fischer Taschenbuch Verlag |location= Frankfurt am Main |year=2002 |chapter=Appendix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:International rules.jpg|thumb|right|300px|An [[international rules football]] match in 2005, between teams representing [[Australia international rules football team|Australia]] and [[Ireland international rules football team|Ireland]], in [[Melbourne]]]]
The '''relationship between [[Australian rules football]] and [[Gaelic football]]''' is the subject of [[controversy]] among historians. The question of whether the two [[football|codes of football]], from Australia and Ireland respectively, have shared origins arises due to similar styles of play in both games.

Both Irish and [[Irish Australian]] historians, including [[Patrick O'Farrell]], Marcus De Búrca, Chris McConville, B. W. O'Dwyer and Richard Davis, have supported the theory that the two games have some common origins. Other Australian historians, including [[Geoffrey Blainey]], [[Leonie Sandercock]] and Ian Turner, have rejected any such connection,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: Richard Davis, 1991, "Irish and Australian Nationalism: the Sporting Connection: Football &amp; Cricket", ''Centre for Tasmanian Historical Studies Bulletin'', v.3, no.2, pp. 49–50 and; B. W. O'Dwyer, 1989, "The Shaping of Victorian Rules Football", ''Victorian Historical Journal'', v.60, no.1.&lt;/ref&gt; emphasising instead the influence of [[rugby football]] and [[English public school football games|other games emanating from English public schools]]. Some sources also suggest that the [[Indigenous Australia|Australian Aboriginal]] game of [[Marn Grook]] was an influence on Australian rules football.

In 1967, following approaches from Australian rules authorities, there was a series of games between an Irish representative team and an Australian team, under various sets of hybrid, compromise rules. In 1984, the first official representative matches of [[International rules football]] were played, and the [[Ireland international rules football team]] now plays the [[Australia international rules football team|Australian team]] annually each October. Since the 1980s, some Gaelic players, such as [[Jim Stynes]] and [[Tadhg Kennelly]], [[Irish experiment|have been recruited]] by the professional [[Australian Football League]] (AFL) clubs and have had lengthy careers with them.

Aside from game-play, a social difference between the codes is that Gaelic football is strictly amateur, whereas Australian football offers professional ([[Australian Football League]]) and semi-professional ([[VFL]], [[SANFL]], [[West Australian Football League|WAFL]], etc.) levels of competition, providing a strong financial lure for Irish players to [[List of players who have converted from one football code to another#Gaelic football to Australian Football|switch to Australian football]].

==Origins==
{{See also|Origins of Australian rules football|Gaelic_football#History}}

=== Gaelic football ===
The earliest record of a recognised precursor to the modern game date from a match in County Meath in 1670, in which catching and kicking the ball was permitted.&lt;ref name="orejan"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Orejan|first1=Jaime|title=The History of Gaelic Football and the Gaelic Athletic Association|journal=Sport Management and Related Topic Journal|date=Spring 2006|volume=2|issue=2|page=46|url=http://thesmartjournal.com/GAA.pdf|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest recorded inter-county match in Ireland was one between [[County Louth|Louth]] and [[County Meath|Meath]], at [[Slane]], in 1712, about which the poet James Dall McCuairt wrote a poem of 88 verses beginning "Ba haigeanta".

Gaelic football was codified by the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA) in 1887. GAA founder and Irish nationalist [[Michael Cusack]] wanted the rules of Gaelic football to differ from [[rugby union]], which was making headway in Ireland at the time.

=== Australian rules football ===
Australian rules football was codified in 1859 by members of the [[Melbourne Football Club]]. The first rules were devised by the Australian-born [[Tom Wills]], who was educated at [[Rugby School]]; Englishmen [[William Hammersley]] and [[J. B. Thompson]], fellow students at [[Cambridge]]'s [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]]; and Irish Australian [[Thomas H. Smith]], who played [[rugby football]] at [[Dublin University]]. Their knowledge of [[English public school football games]], and the conditions and terrain of Melbourne's parklands, influenced the first rules of Australian football. It has been suggested that Wills was influenced by an [[indigenous Australian|Australian Aboriginal]] game, [[Marn Grook]], as Wills grew up in an area where the game was played by local tribes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/deakin/stories/s291489.htm Touchstone of Australian Life] by Martin Flanagan&lt;/ref&gt; Historians such as [[Geoffrey Blainey]] have argued that the origins of Australian rules football lie purely with rugby and other English public school games.

=== Gaelic football in Australia ===
In 1843, Irish immigrants in South Australia celebrated St Patrick's day by playing a game of Caid in Thebarton.&lt;ref&gt;1843 'THE AGRICULTURAL AND HORTICULTURAL SHOW.', ''South Australian Register (Adelaide, SA : 1839 - 1900)'', 18 March, p. 4. , viewed 07 Nov 2017, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article27444196&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Some historians have argued that Gaelic football influenced Australian football. For example, Patrick O'Farrell has pointed out that the Irish sport of [[hurling]], which has similar rules to Gaelic football, was played in Australia as early as the 1840s, and may also have been an influence on the Australian game.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Davis, p.49n&lt;/ref&gt; B. W. O'Dwyer points out that Australian football has always been differentiated from rugby football by having no limitation on ball or player movement (in the absence of an offside rule), the need to bounce the ball (or toe-kick it, known as a ''solo'' in Gaelic football) while running, punching the ball (hand-passing) rather than throwing it, and other traditions. As O'Dwyer says:&lt;ref&gt;B. W. O'Dwyer, March 1989, "The Shaping of Victorian Rules Football", ''Victorian Historical Journal'', v.60, no.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|These are all elements of Irish football. There were several variations of Irish football in existence, normally without the benefit of rulebooks, but the central tradition in Ireland was in the direction of the relatively new game [i.e. rugby]...adapted and shaped within the perimeters of the ancient Irish game of [[hurling]]... [These rules] later became embedded in Gaelic football. Their presence in Victorian football may be accounted for in terms of a formative influence being exerted by men familiar with and no doubt playing the Irish game. It is not that they were introduced into the game from that motive [i.e. emulating Irish games]; it was rather a case of particular needs being met...}}

O'Dwyer's argument relies heavily on the presence of Irish immigrants on the Victorian goldfields during the [[Victorian Gold Rush|Victorian goldrushes]] of the 1850s, and a comparison of the two modern games. There is no archival evidence to prove a direct influence of caid on Australian football.

===Australian rules football in Ireland===
Another theory suggests that influences may have originated from the opposite direction: [[Archbishop Thomas Croke]], one of the founders of the GAA, was the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Auckland|Bishop of Auckland]] and lived in [[New Zealand]] between 1870 and 1875. As a result of the [[Central Otago Gold Rush|New Zealand gold rushes]] of the 1860s, there were many Australian-born settlers in New Zealand, and Victorian rules was popular there at the time. Croke therefore had an opportunity to witness the Australian game being played. Such claims are regarded by some historians as purely [[circumstantial evidence]] for a relationship between the two codes, and any resemblances are the result of something akin to [[parallel evolution|parallel]] or [[convergent evolution]]. [[Geoffrey Blainey]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Blainey|Blainey, Geoffrey]]. ''A Game of Our Own: The Origins of Australian Football''. Black Inc., 2010. {{ISBN|1863954856}}, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|If an historian of football wishes to press the argument that one code must have copied the other, then this conclusion would be difficult to escape: the style of play which Gaelic and Australian football share today was visible in Australia long before it was visible in Ireland. By that line of reasoning Gaelic football must have been the imitator. The present evidence, however, suggests that Gaelic football made its own way ... which happened to be—in the style rather than the formalities of play—in the Australian direction.}}

==Field==
[[Image:AFL stadium.svg|thumb|200px|left|Australian Football playing field]]
[[Image:Gaelic football pitch diagram.svg|thumb|150px|right|Diagram of a Gaelic football pitch]]
Both codes use grassed fields of similar length, however Australian Football fields are oval shaped, slightly longer and wider, usually [[cricket field]]s.
Another key difference is the score posts. Australian rules consists of four posts without a crossbar or net, whereas Gaelic football consists of two posts with crossbar and net.

The Gaelic football ''pitch'' is rectangular, stretching 130–145 metres long and 80–90 metres wide. There are H-shaped goalposts at each end with a net on the bottom section. Lines are marked at distances of 13 m, 20 m and 45 m from each end-line.

An Australian Football playing field, is oval shaped, and may be 135–185 m long and 110–155 m wide. It has a centre circle, centre square to control player positioning at start of play, and superficial markings including the 50-metre lines and goal squares.

Goal posts are 6.4 metres wide for both codes.

==Equipment==
[[Image:Sherrin.png|thumb|right|100px|An Australian [[football (ball)|football]].]]
[[Image:Gaelic football ball.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Gaelic football]]

===Ball===
The obvious difference is the ball used.

Australian rules uses an oval ball (a [[prolate spheroid]]), similar to a [[rugby ball]]. This makes a difference in the variety and style of [[kick (football)|kicking]]. Australian rules is capable of producing a diverse range of kicking styles, the [[drop punt]] is most commonly used in the modern game, more so at professional levels.

Gaelic football uses a round ball similar to a soccer or volleyball. The round ball can be kicked anyway you like, inside, outside and middle of your boot. The instep is the most popular style based on culture, the drop punt used in Gaelic is a far superior kick in terms of distance and accuracy, but is rarely taught.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

===Attire===
Australian rules has evolved to have sleeveless jumpers, whereas Gaelic footballers wear short sleeved outfits similar to soccer or [[Rugby football|rugby]] tops. Long sleeves (usually worn due to cold weather) are acceptable in both codes.

==Duration==
Senior Australian rules matches typically go for 80 minutes, consisting of four 20-minute quarters (plus added time on; which ensures that many quarters in the professional and semi-professional leagues go for closer to 30 minutes, making the actual game length usually 105 to 120 minutes long).

Senior Gaelic football matches go for 70 minutes consisting of two halves.

==Advancing the ball==
In both games, players must dispose of the ball correctly, by hand or by foot and the ball must not be thrown. Gaelic football deems the ''open hand tap'' to be legitimate disposal, whereas Australian rules enforces the [[handpass]] or disposal with a clenched fist.

Unlike other forms of football, both games are notably distinct because of the absence of an [[offside (sport)|offside rule]].

In both games, a player must [[running bounce|bounce]] (or ''Solo'' in Gaelic) the ball while running.

==Tackles and blocks==
{{See also|Tackle (football move)}}

Australian rules allows full tackling above the knees and below the shoulders, whereas Gaelic football explicitly disallows tackling.

Both sports allow "shepherding" or blocking, although in Australian rules, [[bump (football)|bumping]] is allowed on players not in possession of the ball, whereas in Gaelic it is limited to use on players in possession of the ball.

==Gaining possession==
Both games begin with the ball in the air. However, Australian rules has a bounce down and allows only two players to contest the bounce.

Both Gaelic football and Australian Football are openly contested and free flowing games.

The main difference is the awarding of a ''[[Mark (Australian football)|mark]]'' for any clean catch of over 15 metres off a kick in Australian rules, which results in a free kick or possession of the ball. This rule has never existed in Gaelic and is a fundamental difference between the two games. High marking or '[[specky|speckies]]' are one of the most important spectator attributes of Australian rules. In Gaelic football, regardless of a clean catch, a player must play on.

In Australian rules, when a ball is kicked ''out of bounds on the full'', it is a free kick to the opposite team to the player who kicked the ball.

Australian rules allows picking the ball up directly off the ground whereas Gaelic football does not (the ball must only be picked up by foot).

Another key difference is that in Australian rules, [[tackle (football move)|tackling]] is allowed to either dispossess a player or cause the player to be caught ''holding the ball'' which results in a free kick. Gaelic football does not have such a rule.

Possession may change in different ways in both games:-

*When an umpire/referee awards a free kick to an opposition player
*Following an unsuccessful kick at goal.
*When an opposing player [[Interception|intercepts]] a pass.
*When the player in possession drops the ball and it is recovered by an opposition player.
*When the ball is wrestled from a player's possession

In both codes, tactical kicking is an important aspect of play.

==Penalties==
In Australian rules, penalties available (in increasing order of severity) are:
*free kicks (loss of possession)
*distance penalties (often in multiples of 15, 25 or 50 metres)
*ordering off (similar to a yellow card in association football [soccer], not used in the [[Australian Football League]])
*reporting (to be sent to a tribunal post-match for suspension from future matches and/or paying a fine)

In Gaelic football, the penalties available (in increasing order of severity) are:
*free kicks (loss of possession)
*distance penalties (often in multiples of 13 metres)
*penalty kicks
*[[Penalty card#Yellow card|Yellow Card]] (cautioning a player, similar to association football (soccer))
*[[Penalty card#Black card|Black Card]] (player ejected from the remainder of the game with a replacement allowed)
*[[Penalty card#Red card|Red Card]] (player ejected from the game without replacement, similar to association football (soccer))

==Scoring==
In both codes, goals can be kicked by foot or shin. Gaelic football does not enforce this, however, and goals may also be scored by other parts of the body.

A goal is worth 3 points in Gaelic football and 6 points in Australian Football.

In both games, a point may be awarded for missing the goal. In Gaelic football, this is scored above the crossbar (known simply as a ''point''&lt;ref&gt;Gaelic Athletic Association (April 2008). [http://www.gaa.ie/files/official_guides/official_guide2_v2.pdf Gaelic Athletic Association Official Guide – Part 2], p. 60. Accessed on 23 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;). In Australian rules, this is scored between the shorter post and the goal post (known as a ''behind'').

There are usually many more goals scored in Australian rules, as there is no [[goalkeeper]] position due to the vertically limitless scoring area.

==The mark==
The [[mark (Australian rules football)|mark]] has been a feature of Australian rules football since the game was codified in 1859. After trials in the Irish game, a limited version of the mark — only for catches from kick-ins on or beyond the 45m line — was introduced from 2017.&lt;ref name="GF_mark" /&gt;

==Players==
{{See also|Australian rules football positions|Gaelic football, hurling and camogie positions}}
Many of the positions have similar names and are very similar. There is no ''ruckman'' in Gaelic football and there is no ''goalkeeper'' in Australian rules, instead there is a ''fullback'', although the fullback in Australian rules is not required to guard a goal in the same way that a goalkeeper does.

A maximum of 15 players per side can play Gaelic football on the field at any one time, whereas Australian rules permits 18 players per side.

'''[[Crowdfunding]]''' is a process in which individuals or groups pool money and other resources to fund projects initiated by other people or organizations "without standard financial intermediaries."&lt;ref name=Mollick2014&gt; Mollick, E. (2014). ''The dynamics of crowdfunding: An exploratory study.'' Journal of Business Venturing. Vol. 29, pp. 1-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Crowdfunded projects may include creative works, products, nonprofit organizations, supporting entrepreneurship, businesses, or donations for a specific purpose (e.g., to pay for a medical procedure). Crowdfunding usually takes place via an online portal that handles the financial transactions involved and may also provide services such as media hosting, social networking, and facilitating contact with contributors. It has increased since the passage of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act.

== Crowdfunding use ==
Crowdfunding has a wide reach and may be utilized by businesses, nonprofit organizations, an individual, group, or an organization. Crowdfunding is used in a variety of platforms from social media to face-to-face environments. The use of crowdfunding has increased; however, success is not guaranteed.

Funds may be sought out to start a business, to support a cause, or to reach a fundraising goal.  Most crowdfunding projects are small and “seek to raise small amounts of capital, often under $1000.”&lt;ref name=Mollick2014/&gt; An individual or organization may not qualify for a traditional bank loan, and crowdfunding provides another opportunity to gain financial support from others. The use of crowdfunding has gained an increased presence since the JOBS Act and has a significant social media presence. “Approximately 25 percent of real-world relationships start online, with people of all ages migrating online to find a partner. Crowdfunding is doing for small businesses and entrepreneurs what dating sites have done for singles.”&lt;ref name=Hollas2013&gt; Hollas, J. (2013). ''Is crowdfunding now a threat to traditional finance?'' Corporate Finance Review. Vol 18, issue 1, pp. 27-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Those unable to procure funding from traditional methods, may be interested in pursuing crowdfunding as an option; however, the success rate may be a deterrent. E. Mollick examined Kickstarter projects from 2009 through 2012 and found many projects were not successful as only “3% raise 50% of their goal,” and he stated that successful projects succeed “by relatively small margins.”&lt;ref name=Mollick2014/&gt; 

== Crowdfunding models ==
Crowdfunding is donation-based fundraising for [[business]]es or creative projects, typically via an online funding portal. Some but not all crowdfunding projects offer contributors rewards, which may differ based on the amount of money donated. Rewards can include copies of a creative work, products generated with the funding, special or personalized incentives (such as autographed works or [[promotional merchandise]]), or public recognition. One can classify crowdfunding as using one of the following models:

# [[Equity crowdfunding| Equity-based crowdfunding]]
# Reward-based crowdfunding
# Debt-based crowdfunding
# Litigation crowdfunding
# Donation-based crowdfunding

===[[Equity crowdfunding|Equity-based crowdfunding]]===
In [[equity crowdfunding]], a crowdfunding approach is used to raise investment capital, and contributors receive [[Equity (finance) |equity]] in the resulting business. It is a joint effort made between individuals to support the causes of other people or organizations in the form of equity. Contributors may act as investors and receive shares directly, or the crowdfunding service may act as a [[Agent (law)| nominated agent.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cfo-insight.com/financing-liquidity/alternative-finance/crowdfunding-sideshow-or-headline-act/ |title= Der Treasurer |work= cfo-insight.com |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130426053445/http://www.cfo-insight.com/financing-liquidity/alternative-finance/crowdfunding-sideshow-or-headline-act/ |archivedate= 2013-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Equity crowdfunding helps "the 90 percent of businesses that were left out in the cold" by traditional funding methods, which is why it has become such a viable option for business startups.&lt;ref name=Hollas2013/&gt;

Equity-based funding is illegal in many countries, such as [[India]]. In the [[United States of America | United States]] the  [[Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act | JOBS Act]] of 2012 regulated the trend. This "legislation was intended to increase access to capital for the innovative companies" in need of investment capital and allows a pool of small investors to come together.&lt;ref name=Hollas2013/&gt;

===Reward-based crowdfunding===
This mode, also known as "non-equity" funding, has become increasingly popular, with a 230 percent increase in 2012.&lt;ref name=Hollas2013/&gt; Reward-based crowdfunding may fund campaigns supporting the free development of software, the promotion of motion pictures, scientific research, development of inventions, etc. Reward-based funders expect a return from the project.

===Debt-based crowdfunding===
This is known as "Peer to Peer", "P2P", "marketplace lending", or "crowdlending". Borrowers set up campaigns to fulfill their financial needs, and lenders contribute toward the goal for an interest. This method of online funding may prove to be "a threat to the traditional banking system in the areas of consumer and business loans, as has already been demonstrated by the rapid success of [these] online lending marketplaces."&lt;ref name=Hollas2013/&gt;

===Litigation crowdfunding===
A plaintiff requests a monetary donation to fund a court case. If the claimant wins, investors may get more than their initial investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://milaap.org/stories/crowdfunding|title= The Beginners Guide To Crowdfunding|author= |date= |website= milaap.org|accessdate= 16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Donation-based crowdfunding===
This type of crowdfunding "is part of a trend in which people are relying less on [[charities]] to help them fulfill their philanthropic aims".&lt;ref&gt;
''The future of fundraising: Is crowdfunding the wave of the future?'' (2016). Third Sector. October 1, 2016. 29. 
&lt;/ref&gt;
The best example might be raising funds from individuals to support personal or social causes.

== Variables in online crowdfunding ==
People make donations for different reasons and give to different entities. Donors may give to feel good about themselves or because they believe in a cause. Some donations are made to individuals while others are made to organizations. The same is true in online crowdfunding. However, some differences exist in their method of giving, geography, and demographics. 

Online crowdfunding donors differ from traditional fundraising donors in that donors give anonymously, do not have a connection to the recipient, and donors may seek out a cause or recipient to give to.&lt;ref name= GleasureFeller2016&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10864415.2016.1171975 |title=Does Heart or Head Rule Donor Behaviors in Charitable Crowdfunding Markets? |journal=International Journal of Electronic Commerce |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=499 |year=2016 |last1=Gleasure |first1=Rob |last2=Feller |first2=Joseph }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important factor is that online donors are not limited by their geographic location and can give to individuals or organizations anywhere in the world. When it comes to motives, donations are made to individuals to help them reach a goal and typically drop off once that is met; however, donations to organizations are made for a greater societal good.&lt;ref name= GleasureFeller2016/&gt; The demographics of online donors vary from traditional donors as “online donors tend to be younger and give larger gifts than traditional donors.”&lt;ref name=SaxtonWang2013&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0899764013485159 |title=The Social Network Effect |journal=Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly |volume=43 |issue=5 |pages=850 |year=2013 |last1=Saxton |first1=Gregory D |last2=Wang |first2=Lili }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is important for online campaign organizers to note as they determine their target audience; however, those over 50 have increased their social media usage and have a presence on Facebook.&lt;ref name=SaxtonWang2013/&gt;

== Crowdfunding as a replacement method ==
More research is needed in regard to the topic of crowdfunding in general. There are benefits to online crowdfunding as it has the ability to tap into audiences that are not close in geographic proximity to an individual or organization and to increase awareness about a campaign. However, with relatively low funding success rates reported, "social networking and traditional approaches to fundraising may be complements" to help individuals and organizations raise funds but not a replacement.”&lt;ref name=SaxtonWang2013/&gt;

! [[Audio Video Interleave|AVI]]

| {{dunno}}
| {{Yes}}&lt;ref name="ACM VBR"&gt;[[Audio Compression Manager|ACM]] cannot handle VBR audio streams in AVI files. Thus, software using [[Audio Compression Manager|ACM]] to read audio from AVI files will not be able to handle VBR audio streams correctly, even though such files are compliant to the AVI file specification. This is a limitation of the [[Audio Compression Manager|ACM]], not of the AVI file format.&lt;/ref&gt;
| {{Yes}}&lt;ref name="AVI VFR"&gt;Although AVI is not designed for variable framerates, it is possible to use them without creating a non-standard file by using 0-byte chunks for skipped frames. However it requires framerate to be set to [[Least common multiple]] of all framerates used, and produces slight overhead compared to true VFR.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Curran v. Mount Diablo Council of the Boy Scouts of America''''', 17 Cal.4th 670, 952 P.2d 218, 72 Cal.Rptr.2d 410 (1998), was a landmark case which upheld the right of a private organization in [[California]] to not allow new members on the basis of their [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Timothy Curran v. Mount Diablo Council of the Boy Scouts of America |date=March 23, 1998  |publisher=Supreme Court of California |url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data2/californiastatecases/s039738.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[companion case]] was ''[[Randall v. Orange County Council]]'', 17 Cal.4th 736, 952 P.2d 261, 72 Cal.Rptr.2d 453 (1998).

==Background==
In 1980, eighteen-year-old Tim Curran, an [[Eagle Scout rank (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]], applied to be an assistant Scoutmaster in the [[Mount Diablo Council]] [[Boy Scouts of America]]. Members of the Boy Scouts of America, however, had recently learned that Curran was [[homosexuality|gay]] after reading an [[Oakland Tribune]] article on gay youth which featured an interview with Curran. Based on his sexual orientation, the Boy Scouts of America refused to allow Curran to hold a leadership position in their organization.

Curran sued in 1981, alleging that the Boy Scouts of America's membership requirements amounted to unlawful discrimination under California's [[Unruh Civil Rights Act]], which required "Full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges or services in all business establishments".

==Decision==
This case was ultimately decided in 1998, when the [[California Supreme Court]] ruled in favor of the Boy Scouts of America. The court held that because the Boy Scouts of America was not considered a “business establishment” under the Unruh Civil Rights Act, it could not be required to change its membership policies so as to include homosexuals.

Psychiatrist and lawyer [[Richard Green (sexologist)|Richard Green]] was co-counsel for Curran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=West|first1=Donald James|last2=Green|first2=Richard |title=Sociolegal Control of Homosexuality: A Multi-nation Comparison|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AwD3FNUJjXwC&amp;pg=PA152|year=1997|publisher=Plenum|location=New York|isbn=0-306-45532-3|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''emoji domain''' is a [[domain name]] with [[emoji]] in it, for example &lt;code&gt;www.😉.tld&lt;/code&gt;.

== Function == 
For an emoji domain to work, it must be converted into so-called "[[Punycode]]".  Punycode is a character encoding method used for [[internationalized domain name]]s (IDNs).  This representation is used when registering domains containing special characters.  The [[ASCII]] representation starts with the prefix "xn--" and is followed by the emoji-containing domain name encoded as Punycode, for example "xn--i-7iq".

Each emoji has a unique Punycode representation.  For example, "[[😉]]" in an IDN is represented as "xn--n28h".  There are several generators on the Internet that allow one to convert emoji to Punycode and back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.punycoder.com/ |title= Punycode converter |work=Punycoder | accessdate= 31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.charset.org/punycode |title=Punycode Converter|work=Charset.org |accessdate= 31 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Availability and registration ==
The availability of emoji domains is limited.  {{As of|2017|08}}, there are eight [[top-level domain]]s for which registration is possible, all of which are [[Country_code_top-level_domain|ccTLDs]]: [[.cf]], [[.fm]], [[.ga]], [[.gq]], [[.ml]], [[.tk]], [[.to]], and [[.ws]]. {{cn|date=October 2018}}

The registration of an emoji domain can be more difficult than with normal domain names using only [[ASCII]] characters, since it is sometimes not possible to enter emoji into the online registration forms of [[domain name registrar]]s, and instead the [[Punycode]] representation must be entered.

== History ==
The first three emoji domains were created on April 19, 2001: ♨️.com (xn--j6h.com), ♨️.net (xn--j6h.net) and ☮️.com (xn--v4h.com).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cyger|first1=Michael|title=The Definitive Guide to Emoji Domains|url=https://www.dnacademy.com/emoji-domains|website=Dnacademy|publisher=dnacademy.com|accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cabel Sasser of [[Panic (company)|Panic]] created 💩.la (xn--ls8h.la), "The World's First Emoji Domain", on April 13, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World’s First Emoji Domain|url=https://panic.com/blog/the-worlds-first-emoji-domain/|website=Panic Blog|publisher=Panic|accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2015, [[Coca-Cola]] used a domain name containing a smiley emoji in an advertising campaign aimed at mobile users in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nudd|first1=Tim|title=Coke Spreads Happiness Online With Emoji Web Addresses|url=http://www.adweek.com/creativity/coca-cola-spreads-happiness-online-first-emoji-web-addresses-163044/|accessdate=2 September 2017|publisher=AdWeek|date=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, there are approximately 25,000 emoji domains registered on the [[.ws]] TLD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Paddy|title=Emoji Domains Are the Future (Maybe)|url=https://gizmodo.com/emoji-domains-are-the-future-maybe-1823319626|accessdate=4 March 2018|publisher=Gizmodo|date=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 29, 2018, .fm (Micronesia) began allowing registration of emoji domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Roig|first1=Jon|title=Emoji Domains: Now on .fm!|url=https://medium.com/@Emoji_Domains/emoji-domains-now-on-fm-320439007d36|accessdate=31 March 2018|publisher=Domain Research Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Problems ==
Support among [[Domain_name_registrar|domain name registrars]] for emoji domains is limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dewey|first1=Caitlin|title=The surprisingly complex reason you never see emoji URLs|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/02/23/the-surprisingly-complex-reason-you-never-see-emoji-urls/|accessdate=24 September 2017|publisher=Washington Post|date=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Another problem is that emojis can look different depending on the operating system, applications, and fonts used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=ICANN Security and Stability Advisory Committee|title=SAC095: SSAC Advisory on the Use of Emoji in Domain Names|url=https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/sac-095-en.pdf|website=ICANN|publisher=ICANN|accessdate=31 August 2017|language=en|format=pdf|date=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Not all browsers support emoji domains.  On [[Google Chrome]] and [[Firefox]], emoji display as Punycode in the address bar.  In [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]], on the other hand, emoji are visible in the address bar.  Emoji domains also display as such in Google and Bing search results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emoji domains and SEO|url=https://medium.com/@Emoji_Domains/emoji-domains-and-seo-56045409bfb6|website=Medium|publisher=Domain Research Group|accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also issues with using emoji domains in social media.  While they are well supported on [[Twitter]] and [[LinkedIn]], [[Facebook]] and [[Instagram]] impose serious restrictions.  Messaging platforms are a mixed bag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harrison|first1=John|title=How to use emoji domains on social|url=https://artplusmarketing.com/how-to-use-your-emoji-domain-on-social-8e8bfc0f6e6a|accessdate=2 September 2017|publisher=ART + Marketing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At present, only Punycode encoding is supported in e-mail domains, as in "mail@xn--n28h.tld".

== Emoji subdomains ==
Emoji subdomains are like normal subdomains, except that they begin with emoji.  Emoji subdomains are possible with many popular TLDs, including .com.  As with any other emoji domain, emoji subdomains have to be converted into Punycode and can then be used as regular subdomains.  Thus, domain combinations like 👍.website.tld (xn--yp8h.website.tld) are possible.  This allows a wide scope of emoji domains outside of ccTLDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Names of London|url=https://names.of.london/|website=Names of London|publisher=Names of London|accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Fields were trustees of an estate that had a property for sale. In 1987, they entered into a sale agreement with Brent Paulin, with the buyer being referred to in the sales agreement "Brent Paulin or nominee". It was done this way, as Mr Paulin thought he could onsell this property to a 3rd party for a profit before the settlement date. Within 2 days, Fitton came along, who purchased Paulin's right to purchase for $15,000.

However, when Fitton's solicitor informed the trustees that he was now the nominee for the purchase, they refused to deal with them directly, as they were worried that by dealing with a nominee, rather than Paulin, they might be liable for 2 separate amounts of [[stamp duty]]. The trustee's continued to deal with Paulin directly, however as Paulin had sold his interest, he ignored their requests to continue with the sale process, resulting in no settlement on settlement day. As a result, the vendors cancelled the sale.

Mr Fitton, not happy with this development, sued the trustees, challenging the cancellation, claiming that under sections 4 and 8 of the Contracts (Privity) Act, he had all the [[legal rights]] to the sales agreement that Paulin had.

==Verdict==
Section 4 required a nominee to be "designated by name, description or reference to a class", and here this requirement was not met, as "or nominee" was not specific enough, as all that base nominated was a "bare nominee".

Bisson J stated "It is difficult to treat a bare nominee not designated by name, as a person identified by description or as being within a designated class of persons. The nominee could be anyone at all. In the context of 4 designated means specified or identified so that if the nominee is not named, the word nominee in the contract should be qualified by the addition of a descriptive phase or the addition of the particular class within which the nominee falls so as to specify or identify the nominee in the manner required by s 4"

This meant that the Contracts (Privity) Act did not apply here. But the [[legal argument]] was moot, as due to the fact that neither Paulin or Fitton settled the sale on the date of settlement, the trustees were able to cancel the sale contract anyway.

'''''Fire Brats''''' is a series of [[Children's literature|children's books]] about two teenagers, Matt and Dani, who both survive post apocalyptic [[World War 3]]. The books were written by [[Barbara Siegel]], [[Scott Siegel]] and [[Barbara Steiner]].  The first book, ''The Burning Land'', was published in 1987. 

==Overview==
Fire Brats is a series set in the aftermath of World War 3, it follows the  struggles of two teenagers Matt and Dani to escape a nuclear-bombed city and find a new life. 

===''The Burning Land'' (1987)===
Matt and Dani scarcely know one another when World War 3 happens. They meet each other in a [[theater]] [[basement]], where they live on [[junk food]] and suffer a mild form of [[radiation sickness]].{{cn|date=July 2014}} When an earthquake destroys the building over their heads a month later, they dig their way out to find themselves threatened by a gang of escaped convicts. They escape to head for [[California]], where Matt hopes to find the rest of his family still alive.&lt;ref name=nuclear/&gt;

===''Survivors'' (1987)===
Matt and Dani cross a hugeriver on a [[raft]], and are taken in by a kindly old survivalist who teaches them various useful techniques and helps them destroy a pack of [[bandits]].&lt;ref name=nuclear&gt;http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/nuclear/s.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Thunder Mountain'' (1987)===
As a [[dust storm]] strikes, Matt and Dani struggle to survive. They eventually reach the shelter of Thunder Mountain, but it isn't really the safe refuge they need.

===''Shockwave'' (1988)===
As nuclear [[autumn]] persists, Matt and Dani foil a band of slave-trading bikers and save Denver from [[flooding]] caused by a [[lake]] which was formed by the [[bombing]].&lt;ref name=nuclear/&gt;

==Reception==
One of the issues that has irked many readers of this series was that there was never any resolution. The first four books build up the characters, who are trying to get to California, have these characters face much adversity, and then leave them stranded with book four. The reason for there not being any fifth book is still unknown.

This series of books was very popular amongst adolescent readers, many of whom remember the series fondly, but still, all this time later, long to know the fate of Matt and Dani.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19897">'''Harry Dickson''' is a fictional pulp detective, born in America, educated in London, and was called ''The American Sherlock Holmes''. He has appeared in almost 200 [[pulp magazines]] published in [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]] and [[France]].

== History ==

The original pulp dime-novel series that later became ''Harry Dickson'' began in Germany in January 1907 under the title of ''Detektiv Sherlock Holmes und seine weltberühmten Abenteuer'' (Sherlock Holmes' Most Famous Cases), published by ''Verlagshaus für Volksliteratur und Kunst'', and comprised 230 issues in total, published until June 1911. The name ''Sherlock Holmes'' was actually used for the first 10 issues. After some concern about the rights of [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], the series was retitled ''Aus dem Geheimakten des Weltdetektivs'' (The Secret Files of the King of Detectives) with No. 11, even though the main character was still called ''Sherlock Holmes'' inside. Holmes' ''Doctor Watson'' sidekick, however, was a younger man named ''Harry Taxon''.

Sixteen issues of the original German series were adapted into French starting in October 1907 by publisher Fernand Laven for the magazine ''La Nouvelle Populaire'' under the title ''Les Dossiers Secrets de Sherlock Holmes'' (Sherlock Holmes' Secret Files) for No. 1, immediately changed to ''Les Dossiers Secrets du Roi des Détectives'' (The Secret Files of the King of Detectives) with issue No. 2.

In December 1927, the Dutch-Flemish publisher Roman-Boek-en-Kunsthandel launched a Dutch translation of the original German series, this time entitled ''Harry Dickson de Amerikaansche Sherlock Holmes'' (Harry Dickson, the American Sherlock Holmes).

The name ''Harry Dickson'' may have been inspired by that of Harry Taxon (from the German edition above), or by writer [[Arnould Galopin]]'s ''Allan Dickson, the King of Australian Detectives'' which had been created in the early 1900s. Allan Dickson even met Sherlock Holmes in ''L'Homme au Complet Gris'' (The Man in Grey) (1912).

The Dutch series lasted 180 issues, until May 1935. In it, Dickson's young assistant was renamed Tom Wills

In 1928, Belgian publisher Hip Janssens asked writer [[Jean Ray (author)|Jean Ray]] to translate the Dutch series into French, for distribution in Belgium and France. The French-language edition, also entitled ''Harry Dickson, le Sherlock Holmes Americain'', began in January 1929.

Eventually, Ray became tired of translating the mediocre original stories. Using the titles and the covers from the original pre-[[World War I]] German edition (by artist [[Alfred Roloff]], a member of the Berlin Academy) as starting points, he began to write his own stories. The French edition lasted 178 issues, until April 1938.

==Overview==

The adventures of Harry Dickson and his young assistant, Tom Wills, have delighted several generations of French readers. Because they were written by a master of [[horror fiction]], they are far more [[fantasy]]-oriented than the true Holmesian canon. The best and most fondly remembered ''Harry Dickson'' stories are those that pit the Great Detective against some [[supervillains]] such as Professor Flax, the mad scientist known as the Human Monster, and, later, his daughter, the equally deadly Georgette Cuvelier, a.k.a. The Spider (with whom Dickson had a love-hate relationship); Euryale Ellis, a beautiful woman who had the power to turn her victims into stone and who may be a reincarnation of the legendary gorgon Medusa; Gurrhu, a living Aztec god who hid in the Temple of Iron, an underground temple located beneath the very heart of London, filled with scientifically advanced devices; the last, living Babylonian mummies who found refuge under a Scottish lake; a nefarious blood-drinking serial killer dubbed the Vampire with Red Eyes; the enigmatic, tuxedo-suited avenger known as Cric-Croc, the Walking Dead; the supervillain Mysteras, who relies on elaborate and deadly illusions; the bloodthirsty Hindu god Hanuman, etc.

''Harry Dickson'''s fame in France rivals that of ''Sherlock Holmes'' and ''[[Arsène Lupin]]''.

== Fictional Biography ==
Based on various clues mentioned in the series, Harry Dickson was likely born circa 1890 in [[New York City]]. He was educated from childhood in [[England]], because his father wanted him to receive a British education. He only spent three months during his summer holidays in New York where, as a child, he befriended Reginald Marlow.

Dickson’s family background is unknown, but we know that Arsène Lupin studied [[magic (illusion)|magic]] with a stage magician named Dickson in [[Paris]] in 1893.

At age 15, Dickson was a student in England at the Pertwee Private School and solved a case involving a diamond smuggling ring. At age 20 or about, Dickson enrolled as a student at the University of [[South Kensington]] in London and became acquainted with Jean Ray’s armchair detective [[Mister Triggs]]. He also helped fellow French student Antoine de Hautefeuille solve a family mystery.

Coincidentally, Arnould Galopin began recording the adventures of a young detective named Allan Dickson also in 1910 although Galopin’s Dickson is said to be [[Australia]]n.

In 1919, Dickson was on an official intelligence mission in post-war [[Berlin]]. There, he met the brilliant Professor Krausse, whom he much impressed. Dickson met Krausse again, ten years later, i.e.: in 1929, when he was already an established detective at [[221B Baker Street]]. This supports the motion that Dickson’s published cases take place from the mid-1920s to the mid- or late 1930s when he was in his late thirties and early forties, which is consistent with his physical description and abilities.

Jean Ray's exact contribution to the ''Harry Dickson'' series is impossible to determine accurately, but all experts agree that he wrote or substantially rewrote all issues written from 1933 onward, and a number of issues published in 1932.
There has been done substantial research bij the Vriendenkring Jean Ray / L'Amicale Jean Ray, who are re-publishing all Harry Dicksons written by Jean Ray in facsimile.

Located in [[Downtown Tampa|Downtown Tampa, Florida]], the 150,000 sq. ft. [[library]] acts as the central reference and resource center for THPL, as well as the local library branch. John F. Germany Library is the largest in the THPL System and houses several special collections.&lt;ref name=HCPLC&gt;"Hillsborough County Public Library Cooperative." John F. Germany Public Library. N.p., n.d. Web. 19 Apr. 2014. http://www.hcplc.org/hcplc/locations/jfg&lt;/ref&gt;

The library features a creative space known as The HIVE and has various special collections including a Florida History collection, Genealogy Collection, and some 15,000 [[Burgert Brothers]] photographs.

==History==
===Carnegie Library===
[[File:Tampa Free Public Library03.jpg|thumbnail|The original building of the [[Tampa Free Library|Tampa Public Library]], as it looked in 1917. There have been few modifications to the building's exterior.|alt=Tampa, public library, Tampa Free Library, Florida, history, building, Carnegie]]
In 1912, the [[City of Tampa]] received a grant from the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York|Carnegie Foundation]] to start development on a building for a main Tampa library on Seventh Avenue. Architect [[Fred J. James]] designed the building, and the physical work was completed on the facility on June 30, 1915. However, opening of the facility was delayed for two years due to funding constraints. On April 17, 1917, the [[Tampa Free Library|Tampa Public Library]] opened to the public with a collection of 3,800 books.&lt;ref name=THLP&gt;"History of the John F. Germany Library." Library History. http://www.hcplc.org/hcplc/thpl/history/jfghistory.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Carnegie building on Seventh Avenue served as the main library’s building until the need for a larger building became a necessity with the increase of population in [[Tampa]] to 400,000 people. The [[Tampa City Council]], along with community aid, began plans for a new building.&lt;ref name=THLP/&gt; The new building, located less than one mile away from the original Carnegie building, began in 1965 and is still in use today.

===New library and name change to John F. Germany===
The new Tampa Public Library opened to the public on April 21, 1968. Designed by architectural firms McLane, Ranon, McIntosh &amp; Bernardo, and McElvy &amp; Jennewein, the new facility was 100,000 sq. ft. and held more than 500,000 books.&lt;ref name=THLP/&gt; Nine years later, a 50,000 sq. ft. addition to the original building was built. Designed by architectural firm McElvy, Jennewein, Stefany &amp; Howard, the new addition was connected to the original building by an elevated glass walkway. This addition was dedicated on May 23, 1976.&lt;ref name=THLP/&gt;

The [[Tampa Free Library|Tampa Public Library]] was renamed on November 1, 1999, to the John F. Germany Public Library in honor of library supporter, civic leader, and former judge, John F. Germany.&lt;ref name=THLP/&gt; In February 2015, former John F. Germany Public Library Chief Director [[Andrew S. Breidenbaugh]] was named director of the [[Tampa-Hillsborough County Public Library System]].&lt;ref&gt; Andrew Breidenbaugh takes over Tampa-Hillsborough Library System. (2015, February 6). Tampa Bay Times. Retrieved from http://www.tampabay.com/news/localgovernment/andrew-breidenbaugh-takes-over-tampa-hillsborough-library-system/2216773&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lawrence Henry Yaw Ofosu-Appiah''' (18 March 1920 – 1 June 1990) was a Ghanaian academic who taught classics at the [[University of Ghana]] and was subsequently Director of the ''[[Encyclopedia Africana]]''.

==Background==

Ofosu-Appiah was born in a village called Kukua near Adawso in the [[Eastern Region (Ghana)|Eastern Region]] of [[Ghana]]. His parents were Seth Fianko — a teacher and a descendant of the [[royal family]] of Kubease, Larteh, Ghana — and Agnes Fianko (née Reynolds) — also a teacher and a descendant of the royal family of [[Akropong]], Akwapim, Ghana.
His education started at Adawso Presbyterian Primary School. In January 1932, he joined [[Achimota Secondary School]] for his secondary education. In 1939, he began his career as a Latin and Twi teacher at Achimota School. In January 1942, he joined the Junior Staff Department. He was appointed to work as an Assistant Librarian. He went on to work as an Assistant Museum Curator.

In March 1944, the Achimota Council awarded him a scholarship to [[Oxford University]], United Kingdom, and he was accepted at [[Hertford College]]. He was the first black African to come to [[Oxford]] to study [[Classics]]. He read [[Honour Moderations]] followed by [[Literae Humaniores]].

He went to [[Jesus College, Cambridge]], United Kingdom, in October 1948 to complete a diploma in [[Anthropology]]. Shortly after that, he was appointed Assistant Lecturer in Classics at the University College, Gold Coast, now [[University of Ghana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.ghananation.com/articles/Lawrence-Henry-Yaw-Ofosu-Appiah.aspx |title=Lawrence Henry Yaw Ofosu-Appiah |accessdate=22 April 2015 |author= |date= |work=Ghana Nation |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==University College, Gold Coast, 1949–64==
Ofosu-Appiah was the first African to be appointed to the Classics Department of the University College, Gold Coast, now University of Ghana. He taught the first year Intermediate Arts class [[Latin]]. In April 1951, he took his Master of Arts Degree and ceased to be a Junior Member of [[Oxford University]] from that date.

In 1954, he had the honour of composing, in [[Latin]], the inscription that was unveiled at the official opening of Akuafo Hall in 1955. In July 1954, he married Victoria Boohemaa Addo from [[Akropong]], Akwapim. They had three daughters: Asantewa, Oseiwa and Asabea.

In April 1959, he was promoted to a Senior Lectureship in [[Classics]]. He was then appointed Senior Tutor in Akuafo Hall and presented his first students for graduation to the [[Duke of Edinburgh]] at the [[Great Hall]] of the University. He was chosen to represent the University of Ghana at the inauguration of the University Institute in [[Mogadishu]] in January 1960.

Ofosu-Appiah was elected a Fellow of the Ghana Academy of Learning in 1961. He was subsequently elected to the Standing Committee of the Ghana Academy of Sciences for 1963-64. In October 1961, he was appointed as a government representative to the [[West African Examination Council]]. In 1962, he was appointed to the Interim Council of the [[University of Cape Coast]] to represent the Arts Faculty. Also in 1962, he was elected master of Akuafo Hall, University of Ghana, Legon. He was the first African master of the hall and the installation was done by Professor [[Adu Boahen]], the Senior Tutor at the time. Ofosu-Appiah was also elected Chairman of the Board for University Primary School, Legon, in 1964.

==United States of America, 1964–66==
Ofosu-Appiah was awarded a [[Fulbright Scholarship]] and the post of Visiting Professor of Classics at [[Dartmouth College]], [[Hanover, New Hampshire|Hanover]], [[New Hampshire]], United States, for the academic year 1964-65. He was the first black person to join the faculty. He taught [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] and also helped the English Department by teaching [[English Literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Lawrence-Henry-Yaw-Ofosu-Appiah |title=Lawrence Henry Yaw Ofosu-Appiah|accessdate=22 April 2015 |author= |date= |work=The Economic Times |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was offered the distinguished scholar’s chair for 1965-66: "The Edgar B. Stern University Professor", at [[Dillard University]], [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]]. He accepted the post and was assigned to the Division of Humanities, where he taught Philosophy and Literature.

==Encyclopaedia Africana Secretariat==

Ofosu-Appiah accepted the position of Director of the [[Encyclopedia Africana|Encyclopedia Africana Project]] in [[Accra]] in August 1966.  This was a project inspired by [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He met with the then Director of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', Sir William Hailley, who advised that the biographies would make sense only if they had a historical introduction and to have several volumes of country to country biographies.

The first volume of the ''Encyclopaedia Africana Dictionary of Biographies'', ''Ethiopia-Ghana'', was published in June 1977. This was followed by the second volume, ''Sierra Leone-Zaire'', in December 1979.

==Public service for the Republic of Ghana==

Ofosu-Appiah was appointed the Chairman of the [[Ghana Library Board]] in March 1967. In 1969, he opened the [[Bolgatanga]] Library. In 1970, when asked by the government of the Second Republic to continue as the Chairman, he created a new Ghana Library Board Act, which was implemented in June 1970.

He was appointed a member of the National Advisory Committee of the [[National Liberation Council]] from 1967 to 1968. He was also appointed a member of the Committee on Imprisoned Political Offenders. In September 1967, he was appointed a member of the Board of Directors of the Ghana Airways Corporation until April 1969.

After the inauguration of the Second Republic took place in 1969, he was offered the Chairmanship of the Ghana State Housing Corporation. He was also elected to the National Executive of the [[Progress Party (Ghana)|Progress Party]] in 1970 and subsequently appointed the Chairman of a Committee on the Winneba Training College. His terms of reference included suggestions for the improvement of higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://askmeghana.com/13912/lawrence-henry-yaw-ofosu-appiah |title=Lawrence Henry Yaw Ofosu-Appiah  |accessdate=22 April 2015 |author=Askmeghana Staff |date=28 October 2014 |publisher=Askmeghana.com  |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ofosu-Appiah chaired a committee set up in 1967 to establish lectures in memory of [[J.B. Danquah]]. The lectures began in February 1968. Ofosu-Appiah delivered the anniversary lectures in 1969, as well as the eighth series of lectures in 1975 on the subject: "[[Joseph Ephraim Casely Hayford]]: The Man of Vision and Faith." This lecture was published in 1976.

In October 1968, he won a seat on the board of the Ghanaian [[Council for Scientific and Industrial Research – Ghana|Council for Scientific and Industrial Research]] (CSIR). He then went on to be elected the Honorary Secretary of the Ghana Academy of Sciences (GAS).

==Writing==

In 1962, Ofosu-Appiah translated [[Odyssey|Homer's ''Odyssey'']] into [[Twi]], and it was used as a set book by the Ministry of Education of Ghana. He wrote ''People in Bondage'', which was published in the United States by [[Lerner Publishing Group]], and ''Slavery: A Brief Survey'', which was published in Ghana by Waterville.

In 1969, he completed ''The Life and Times of J. B. Danquah'', ensuring that the part Danquah played in Gold Coast politics would not be forgotten. This was eventually published in August 1974. 1970 saw the start of yet another book: ''The Life of Lt. General [[Emmanuel Kwasi Kotoka]]''. This book was published in 1972. At the suggestion of James Moxon, Ofosu-Appiah wrote the book ''The Life of Dr. J. E. K. Aggrey''. This was published by Waterville just in time for the 100th Anniversary Celebration of the birth of Aggrey in 1975.

[[File:Lawrence Henry Yaw Ofosu-Appiah Headstone.jpg|thumb|Headstone of Lawrence Henry Yaw Ofosu-Appiah and Victoria Boohemaa Ofusu-Appiah]]

In 1975, Ofosu-Appiah tried unsuccessfully to get a Twi Language and Literature Research Unit established. He did, however, succeed in acquiring funding for his Twi translation of [[Apology (Plato)|Plato's ''Apology'']]. He also translated [[Antigone (Sophocles)|Sophocles's ''Antigone'']] for Waterville to publish. He was helped by Rev. E. K. Kwabbi, D. O. Kwapong, and E. T. Koramoa to achieve this goal.

==Death==
Again in 1975, Ofosu-Appiah began writing an English-Twi dictionary with the help of Mr E. O. Koranteng, who was, at the time, on the staff of the [[University of Ghana]] Language Centre. Ofosu-Appiah attempted to publish this dictionary in 1985 but could not find any publishers interested at the time. He also wrote an article for the ''Conspectus of the World Encyclopaedia of Black Peoples of the World'' that was published by Scholarly Press in September 1975.


Ofosu-Appiah died on 1 June 1990, at the Luton &amp; Dunstable Hospital, [[Bedfordshire]], United Kingdom. He was buried at the Vale Cemetery, [[Butterfield Green]], [[Luton]], on 11 June 1990. His wife died on 12 May 2012 in Ghana and her ashes were brought to the Vale Cemetery for interment as she requested, being buried in his grave on 21 June 2012. He is survived by his two daughters Asantewa and Asabea.

'''''Lindon v. First National Bank''''', 10 F. 894 (W.D. Pa. 1882), is one of the very earliest precedent-setting [[Federal judiciary of the United States|US federal court]] cases involving [[common law]] [[name change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bander|first1=Edward|title=Change of name and law of names|date=January 1, 1973|publisher=Oceana Publications|isbn=9780379110883|pages=37-38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i1FUGhM98eAC&amp;q=10+F.+894+name+change&amp;dq=10+F.+894+name+change&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiN9sKptpvXAhWDNiYKHQwKAfQQ6AEIKDAA|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A woman who had changed her last name to one that was not her husband's original surname was trying to claim control over her [[inheritance]]. The court ruled in her favor, "At common law a man may change his name, and he is bound by any [[contract]] into which he may enter in his adopted or reputed name, and by his known and recognized name he may sue and be sued." This set forth many things. By common law, one may lawfully change their name and be "known and recognized" by that new name. Also, one may enter into any kinds of contracts in their new adopted name. Contracts include employment (see ''[[Coppage v. Kansas]]'' 236 U.S. 1). And one can be recognized legally in court in their new name.

The '''''Oxford Classical Dictionary''''' ('''''OCD''''') is generally considered "the best one-volume dictionary on antiquity,"&lt;ref&gt;Markus Sehlmeyer, review of ''Oxford Classical Dictionary'', ed.

[http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2003/2003-11-15.html]&lt;/ref&gt; an encyclopedic work in English consisting of articles relating to [[classical antiquity]] and its civilizations.  It was first published in 1949 (''OCD''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; or ''OCD''), edited by [[Max Cary]] with the assistance of [[H. J. Rose]], H. P. Harvey, and [[Alexander Souter]].  A second edition followed in 1970 (''OCD''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), edited by [[Nicholas G. L. Hammond]] and [[H. H. Scullard]], and a third edition in 1996 (''OCD''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), edited by [[Simon Hornblower]] and [[Antony Spawforth]]. A revised third edition was released in 2003, which is nearly identical to the previous third edition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2152">'''Pippo''' was a mythical plane, unique to [[Northern Italy]], that flew during [[World War II]]. An example of [[oral history]], Pippo is not well documented even in Italy.

Pippo had a distinctive buzz, was rarely if ever seen and flew mainly at night. If people were faithful to the [[Republican Fascist Party|Fascists]], they considered it an [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] plane. If people were supporters of the Allies, it was thought to be a Luftwaffe or Italian Air Force aircraft. No matter what their political allegiances, people personified it as a “he” – the plane and the pilot as one. It is suspected that the Italian government used Pippo as a [[propaganda]] tool to turn ordinary civilians against the Allies, though there is no doubt the plane was real.

It is unclear how Pippo got its name. It may have been a play on the Italian moniker for Disney’s [[Goofy]] character or alternatively was based on the pip-pip sounds it apparently made. 

Despite the unthreatening name, people mainly interpreted Pippo as something fearful. Superstition held that one had to block the lights in one’s house or Pippo might fire upon it. It was said to drop exploding pens, poisoned candy, or so-called [[butterfly bomb]]s and to fire on farm workers in fields.

Only decades later did historians surmise the likely origin of the plane. When the Allies gained a foothold in Italy in the later years of the war, pilots began flying tactical night missions to survey and intervene in German troop movements. It never occurred to them that they were inadvertently terrorizing the countryside. In particular, the [[Royal Air Force]] used a plane called the [[de Havilland Mosquito]].

'''The Stroop Report''' is an official report prepared by General [[Jürgen Stroop]] for the [[SS]] chief [[Heinrich Himmler]], recounting the German suppression of the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] and the liquidation of the ghetto in the spring of 1943. Originally titled '''''The Jewish Quarter of Warsaw is No More!''''' ([[German language|ger.]] ''Es gibt keinen jüdischen Wohnbezirk in Warschau mehr!''), it is commonly referred to as "The Stroop Report". It was published in the 1960s.

==History==
The Report was commissioned by [[Friedrich-Wilhelm Krüger]], chief of the SS and police in [[Kraków]] and was intended as a souvenir album for Heinrich Himmler. It was prepared in three distinct leather-bound copies for Himmler, [[Friedrich Krueger]] and Jürgen Stroop, with one unbound "file" copy of the report (''das Konzept'') remaining in Warsaw, in the care of Chief of Staff Max Jesuiter.&lt;ref name=Raskin26&gt;{{cite book | author=Richard Raskin | title=A Child at Gunpoint: A Case Study in the Life of a Photo | year=2004 | editor = | pages = | chapter = | chapterurl = | publisher=Aarhus University Press | location = | isbn=978-8779340992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a statement given in 1945 by Stroop's adjutant Karl Kaleshke to US authorities in Wiesbaden, he ordered Stroop's copy of the report burnt with other secret documents in Burg Kranzberg.&lt;ref name=Stempowski&gt;{{cite web |title=Zdjęcia z powstania w getcie |url=http://fototekst.pl/zdjecia-z-powstania-w-getcie/ | author =Tomasz Stempowski |format= |website= |publisher=fototekst.pl |date=March 17, 2013 |lay-format= |accessdate=October 8, 2013 |postscript= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war only two of the four copies were discovered, those belonging to Himmler and Jesuiter.&lt;ref name =Zbikowski&gt;{{cite book | author =[[Jürgen Stroop]] | title =Żydowska dzielnica mieszkaniowa w Warszawie już nie istnieje! / Es gibt keinen jüdischen Wohnbezirk in Warschau mehr!| year =2009 | editor =Andrzej Żbikowski | pages =10–18 | chapter = | chapterurl = | publisher = [[:pl:Instytut Pamięci Narodowej|Instytut Pamięci Narodowej]], Żydowski Instytut Historyczny| location =Warsaw | isbn =  978-83-7629-455-1 | url =http://pamiec.pl/ftp/ilustracje/Raport_STROOPA.pdf | format = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Himmler's copy went to Seventh Army Intelligence Center (SAIC) and Jesuiter's to Military Intelligence Research Section (MIRS) in London.&lt;ref name=Stempowski/&gt; Several sources stated that the German [[German Federal Archives|Bundesarchiv]] also had a copy in [[Koblenz]].&lt;ref name =Zbikowski/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://collections1.yadvashem.org/notebook_ext.asp?item=47893 Yad Vashem Photo Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://resources.ushmm.org/inquery/uia_doc.php/photos/6443 United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in reply to inquiries by Richard Raskin, the Bundesarchiv stated that the third copy of report was never in their possession.&lt;ref name=Raskin26/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stempowski/&gt; Both copies were introduced as evidence at the [[International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg]], sharing the document number 1061-PS, and used in the trial as "US Exhibit 275".&lt;ref name=Raskin26/&gt; It was first displayed by the chief U.S. prosecutor [[Robert H. Jackson]] for the judges during his opening address.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holocaust-history.org/works/imt/02/htm/t126.htm International Military Tribunal "Blue Series," Vol. 2, p. 126]&lt;/ref&gt; The assistant prosecutor dealing with the persecution of the Jews referred to it as "the finest example of ornate German craftsmanship, leather bound, profusely illustrated, typed on heavy bond paper&amp;nbsp;... the almost unbelievable recital of the proud accomplishment by Major General of Police Stroop".&lt;ref&gt;Conot, Justice at Nuremberg, 1983, pp. 269-70.&lt;/ref&gt; Both copies were also used in Nuremberg in the 1947 trial of [[Oswald Pohl]] as exhibit 503.

On June 10, 1948, the Himmler/SAIC copy of the Stroop report and [[Katzmann Report]] were handed over by Fred Niebergal, head of Office of Chief of Counsel for War Crimes – OCCWC, to Bernard Acht, head of the Polish Military Mission in Nuremberg.&lt;ref name=Stempowski/&gt; It was used in Stroop's trial at Warsaw Criminal District Court in July 1951,&lt;ref name =Zbikowski/&gt; and transferred afterwards to the KC [[Polish United Workers' Party|PZPR]] archive.&lt;ref name=Stempowski/&gt; In 1952 it was transferred to the ''Główna Komisja Badania Zbrodni Hitlerowskich w Polsce'' (Main Commission for the Investigation of Nazi Crimes in Poland) archive and subsequently to its successor the [[Institute of National Remembrance]] (Polish: ''Instytut Pamięci Narodowej'' or IPN) where it remains.&lt;ref name=Stempowski/&gt; In 1948 the Jesuiter/MIRS copy of the report went to the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] (NARA) in [[Washington, D.C.]], where it remains.&lt;ref name=Raskin26/&gt;

In 2017, the Stroop Report was submitted by Poland and included in UNESCO's [[Memory of the World]] Register.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jürgen Stroop’s Report|website=Memory of the World|publisher=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-4/juergen-stroops-report/|access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
[[File:Stanisław Piotrowski - Sprawozdanie Juergena Stroopa.jpg|thumb|First book edition of the Stroop Report from 1948 by [[Stanisław Piotrowski]]]]
The Report was a 125-page typed document, bound in black pebble [[leather]], with 53 photographs. It consisted of the following sections: 
*Summary, with
**title page
**list of soldiers killed and wounded
**the list of combat units involved, and 
**introduction, signed by Jürgen Stroop in case of IPN copy 
*Collection of 31 daily reports (German: ''Tägliche Meldungen''), sent from Stroop's Chief of Staff Max Jesuiter to SS Police Leader East Friedrich-Wilhelm Krüger. The reports cover the period of 20 April to 16 May 1943, plus a report from 24 May 1943, and were all signed by Jesuiter.
*Series of 53 photographs accompanied by hand-written captions in German [[Sütterlin]] script
*The NARA report also has a fourth section with statistics about human losses, types of recovered weapons and amounts of money and valuables taken from Jews.&lt;ref name=Stempowski/&gt;

There are slight discrepancies in textual and graphical layout, and in the photographs they contain.

{{Main|Polish resistance movement in World War II}}

The Stroop Report alludes repeatedly to the participation of the Polish Resistance in the Warsaw ghetto uprising. Stroop referred to Polish underground fighters as Polnische Banditen - "Polish Bandits", and noted:

{{quote|When we invaded the Ghetto for the first time, the Jews and the Polish bandits succeeded in repelling the participating units, including tanks and armored cars, by a well-prepared concentration of fire. ... The main Jewish battle group, mixed with Polish bandits, had already retired during the first and second day to the so-called Muranowski Square. There, it was reinforced by a considerable number of Polish bandits. Its plan was to hold the Ghetto by every means in order to prevent us from invading it. ... Time and again Polish bandits found refuge in the Ghetto and remained there undisturbed, since we had no forces at our disposal to comb out this maze. ... One such battle group succeeded in mounting a truck by ascending from a sewer in the so-called Prosta [Street], and in escaping with it (about 30 to 35 bandits). ... The bandits and Jews – there were Polish bandits among these gangs armed with carbines, small arms, and in one case a light machine gun – mounted the truck and drove away in an unknown direction.|Jürgen Stroop, 1943&lt;ref name="stroop"&gt;From the [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/nowarsaw.html Stroop Report] by SS [[Gruppenführer]] Jürgen Stroop, May 1943.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

&lt;/center&gt;

== Photographs from the Stroop Report ==
The IPN copy of the report has 53 photographs on 49 pages, while the NARA copy has the same number of photographs on 52 pages. 37 photographs appear in both copies, although not always with the same size, crop or order and occasionally with different captions. Sixteen shots in each copy are different, although often very similar as they depict the same events. Altogether, in both versions of the report there are 69 unique photographs.&lt;ref name=Stempowski/&gt;&lt;ref name =Zbikowski/&gt;

The identity of the photographers who accompanied Stroop's headquarters during the operation is unknown. [[Franz Konrad (SS officer)|Franz Konrad]] confessed to taking some of the photographs; the rest were probably taken by photographers from ''Propaganda Kompanie nr 689''.&lt;ref name=Stempowski/&gt;&lt;ref name =Zbikowski/&gt; In addition to the photographs found in the reports there were about 45 additional photographs that were not included which according to [[Yad Vashem]] were found in Stroop's possession when he was captured by the Americans after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Stroop Collection|url=http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/exhibitions/warsaw_ghetto/collection.asp|website=[[Yad Vashem]]|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of those photographs were closely related to those used in the report as they depicted the same events. Many of those additional photographs are described in reputable sources as coming from the Stroop Report, even if they do not appear in either of the surviving copies.

The high-quality photographs taken for Stroop constitute a unique documentation of the final stage of liquidation of the Warsaw ghetto. The photographer was permitted access to Stroop's inner circle, to accompany the forces that participated in liquidating the ghetto, and to get close to the combat areas. Apart from a dozen candid photographs taken by Polish firefighter [[Leszek Grzywaczewski]], those are the only photographs of the Ghetto Uprising taken inside the ghetto.&lt;ref name=Stempowski/&gt; Some of them became highly recognized images of World War II and the [[The Holocaust|Shoah]].

Photographic captions in the Report are often highly racist and contain few facts about their content, but are a good reflection of the mindset of the report's authors. They are written in the German Sütterlin script, and in some cases do not match the images. Many of the places, people and events depicted were identified in the years after the report's publication.

'''''The Chanticleer''''' is [[Duke University]]’s undergraduate yearbook. It was founded while the institution was still Trinity College in 1911, and was first published in 1912.  The yearbook has kept the same title each year, with the exception of 1918 and 1919. Because of [[World War I]], there was no issue in 1918, and in 1919 the yearbook was titled ''The Victory'' to mark the war’s end.

The origin of the title ''Chanticleer'' is not verified, but there are a few theories. Chanticleer is the name of the rooster in the Nun’s Priest Tale of the ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''. One possibility is that the yearbook was named in response to a campus theater production of the ''Canterbury Tales'' in 1911. Another theater production popular at the time was titled ''Chantecler: A Play in Four Acts'', which may have inspired the title. The rooster may have been a mascot at Trinity at the time, possibly because of the presence of chickens on campus. The rooster was also a symbol for an announcement in the early 1900s.

'''''The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World''''' is a book by [[Jim Clements]] which presents a list of the bird species of the world.

The most recent printed version is the sixth edition (2007), which was published by [[Cornell University Press]]. Previous editions were published by the author's own imprint, Ibis Publishing.  The [[Cornell Lab of Ornithology]] has provided annual updates since then, usually in August, and the most recent version is available online in several formats.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.birds.cornell.edu/clementschecklist/download/&lt;/ref&gt; These updates reflect the ongoing changes to bird taxonomy based on published research.

''Clements'' is the official list used by the [[American Birding Association]] for birds globally. [[eBird]] also uses the ''Clements'' checklist as the base list for its [http://ebird.org/content/ebird/about/ebird-taxonomy eBird taxonomy], which in addition to species includes hybrids and other non-species entities reported by birders.

'''''The French Chef''''' is a television [[cooking show]] created and hosted by [[Julia Child]],&lt;ref name="PM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/post/161490-bless-this-mess-sweeping-the-kitchen-with-julia-child/|title=Bless This Mess: Sweeping the Kitchen with Julia Child|work=[[PopMatters]]|date=August 13, 2012|author=J.C. Maçek III}}&lt;/ref&gt; produced and broadcast by [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]], the [[Public television|public television station]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], from February 2, 1963 to January 14, 1973. It was one of the first [[cooking show]]s on American television.

The show grew out of a special presentation Child gave on WGBH based on the book ''[[Mastering the Art of French Cooking]]'' which she co-authored.  ''The French Chef'' was produced from 1963 to 1973 by WGBH for [[National Educational Television]] (and later for [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]). Reruns continued on PBS until 1989, and were airing on [[Cooking Channel]] as of 2010. As of September 2016, episodes were being rerun on the new Canadian cooking channel Gusto.  As recent as March, 2017, reruns of the show were also seen on the [[American Public Television]] [[Create (TV network)|Create]] channel.

==Format==
''The French Chef'' introduced [[French cuisine|French cooking]] to the United States at a time when it was considered expensive restaurant fare, not suitable for home cooking.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}  Child emphasized fresh and, at the time, unusual ingredients.  All of the recipes used on ''The French Chef'' had originally appeared in ''Mastering the Art of French Cooking,'' but for the show, Child chose mostly the more domestic recipes from the book,{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} although such showpieces as [[Beef Wellington]], various sorts of [[soufflé]], and some ambitious [[Pastry|pastries]] also made it into the mix if they seemed within the reach of a home cook without staff.

The show was done live-to-videotape from start to finish, leaving little room for mistakes.  The resulting occasional accidents became a popular trademark of Child's on air presence, used as "[[teachable moment]]s" to encourage viewers to relax about the task's demands.

Certain elements became ''[[Motif (narrative)|motif]]s'': Julia's fondness for wine; her distinctive voice; her staunch defense of the use of butter (with [[margarine]] invariably referred to as "that other spread") and [[cream]]; her standard issue "impeccably clean towel"; and her closing line at the end of every show: "''This is Julia Child, [[wikt:bon appétit|Bon appétit]]!''"

When the show began, the budget was so low that "volunteers had to be recruited to wash dishes, and the food sometimes had to be auctioned to the audience afterwards to cover expenses."&lt;ref name="time66"/&gt;

'''The Simpsons Archive''', also known by its previous [[domain name]] snpp.com or simply SNPP (named for the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]]), is a [[The Simpsons|Simpsons]] [[Fansite|fan site]] that has been online since 1994. Maintained by dozens of volunteers from—amongst other places—the [[newsgroup]] [[alt.tv.simpsons]] and ''Simpsons''-related [[internet forum|forums]], the site features information on every aspect of the show, from detailed guides to upcoming episodes and [[Product (business)|merchandise]], to the episode capsules (text files documenting [[video frame|freeze frame]] jokes, quotes, scene summaries, reviews and the like),  for which the site is well known. In a bid to steer clear of [[20th Century Fox|Fox]]'s legal department after a conflict in 1996, the site contains no multimedia or interactive features, preferring to focus on documenting the show through textual material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Confessions of a Surrogate Simpson | date=2007-07-24 |last=Menno | first=Christian | work=PlayPhilly.com | url=http://www.playphilly.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=18620922&amp;BRD=2766&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=578220&amp;rfi=6 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070920140417/http://www.playphilly.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=18620922&amp;BRD=2766&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=578220&amp;rfi=6 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2007-09-20 | accessdate=July 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of October, 2005, the site receives roughly 1.2 million hits per month. In 2013, it was moved from snpp.com (which has now expired) to simpsonsarchive.com.

The Archive began in 1994, the brainchild of Gary Goldberg, with extensive help from the members of alt.tv.simpsons at the time, including Raymond Chen, the first to compile the episode capsules, and Dave Hall, one of the first online Simpsons fans to champion list-compiling. The site, originally based on the Widener archive set up by [[Brendan Kehoe]] in 1989, featured a bright yellow and black design until 1998, when it was revamped to the more subdued style.

==Site contents==
;[[FAQ]]s, Guides and Lists : FAQs, character files, merchandise information, broadcast history and, as the name would suggest, various lists (such as the cast list, couch gags, blackboard gags, song lyrics etc.)
;Upcoming Episodes : Guides to upcoming national schedules in the countries of (including, but not limited to) [[United States|USA]], [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Russia]], as well as details on episodes in production.
;[[:Category:Lists of television series episodes|Episode Guide]] : Brief episode synopsis for each episode, including guest stars and first character appearances.
;Episode Capsules : Probably the site's most well-known feature: comprehensive text files documenting quotes and scene summaries, freeze-frame jokes, reviews, animation errors and any other insight necessary. The capsules are mostly compiled from documentation posted to alt.tv.simpsons. The episode capsule is a convention that has since crossed over to many other TV show fansites and newsgroups, including co-[[Matt Groening]] animation ''[[Futurama]]''. Episodes featured are up to and including [[The Simpsons (season 13)|thirteenth season]]'s "[[The Bart Wants What It Wants]]".
;Miscellaneous : A collection of both internal and external copies of academic papers, articles, interviews and the like relating to the show, dating back as far as 1987.
;Simpsons-L : The site's own [[Mailing list|e-mail-based discussion group]], having over 1000 members. This list was [[Internet forum#Moderators|moderated]] to prevent [[Spam (electronic)|spam]]. The mailing list was shut down in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Simpsons Archive: The Springfield Times - News Archive|url=http://www.simpsonsarchive.com/news/100410.html#simpsons-l|website=www.simpsonsarchive.com|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Web links : A comprehensive list of links to hundreds of other related sites, from fansites and character sites to the homepages of the [[Cast member|cast]] and [[official]] sites.
;The Springfield Times : A [[news]] page, home to articles on new Simpsons-related information, events and products, as well as to the two sub-sections of [[DVD]] News and [[Film|Movie]] News.

In addition to this, the site offers a search facility and an ''About the Archive'' page which allows you to contact any of the various maintainers and check which new pages and episode capsules have been added since your last visit.

==Publicity==
The site has been featured in many publications, including the UK [[magazine]] ''[[Webuser|WebUser]]'', in which the site ranked #3 in their list of the "Top 100 TV Websites" back in 2002, and several unofficial ''Simpsons'' books including the analytical ''[[Planet Simpson]]'' by [[Chris Turner (author)|Chris Turner]] and the UK-issued episode guides ''[[The Pocket Essentials]]: The Simpsons'' by Peter Mann and ''I Can't Believe It's A Bigger, Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'' by Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood. In ''Planet Simpson'', Turner thanks the Simpsons Archive, saying that the book would have been impossible without it.

[[Matt Groening]], creator of the show, was once quoted in the [[Argentina|Argentinian]] [[newspaper]] ''[[La Nación]]'' as saying: "Sometimes we have to look at fan sites to remember [what we have done before]: one of the best is www.snpp.com. I have no idea what those initials mean, but it has a lot of stuff. Though for them, every episode is the worst ever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Groening Visits The Archive |date=2003-06-29 |work=The Simpsons Channel |url=http://www.simpsonschannel.com/cgi-bin/newspro/addons/iSay.cgi?Page=Comments&amp;ID=EpVyAEFFVkYMgegBJE |accessdate=July 30, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928202728/http://www.simpsonschannel.com/cgi-bin/newspro/addons/iSay.cgi?Page=Comments&amp;ID=EpVyAEFFVkYMgegBJE |archivedate=September 28, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070426080046/http://personales.ciudad.com.ar/simpsonitos03/entrevistas2.htm Archive of article as posted on Simpsonidos]&lt;/ref&gt; Reviews from the site's episode capsules have also been mentioned in the [[Audio commentary|DVD commentaries]] by various members of the show's staff.{{fact|date=September 2014}}

'''''The Supper of the Lamb''''' is a [[Food writing|food book]] by [[Robert Farrar Capon]]. It was first published in 1969, and has been republished several times. It has been included in the [[Modern Library]] Food series.

Capon was an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] priest, and [[Lauren Winner]] describes this book as "part cookbook, part theological meditation – something like [[M. F. K. Fisher]] meets the [[Desert Fathers|desert fathers]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Winner|first=Lauren F.|author-link=Lauren Winner|title=Mudhouse Sabbath: An Invitation to a Life of Spiritual Discipline|year=2007|publisher=Paraclete Press|page=22|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3SeUeMdUBfQC&amp;pg=PA22|isbn=9781557255327}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederick Buechner]] described it as transcending category: "To call ''The Supper of the Lamb'' a cookbook would be like calling ''[[Moby Dick]]'' a whaling manual."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vitello|first=Paul|title=Robert F. Capon, Who Wrote of God and Food, Dies at 87|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/nyregion/robert-f-capon-who-wrote-of-god-and-food-dies-at-87.html?_r=1&amp;|accessdate=16 September 2013|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=14 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title is an allusion to the "marriage supper of the [[Lamb of God|Lamb]]" depicted in the [[Revelation 19|19th chapter]] of the [[Book of Revelation]], as well as a recipe for "Lamb for eight persons four times", which forms the basis for most of the book's discussions.

The book is not a [[cookbook]] in the strictest sense - it covers a wide variety of theological topics in between segments on cooking.  A reader must read a good deal of the book in order to make the flagship recipe.

'''''The Walking Man''''' ({{lang-fr|L'homme qui marche}}) is a bronze sculpture by the French sculptor [[Auguste Rodin]]. It was created by Rodin during 1877 and 1878.

The best example of Rodin’s ‘sketchy’ impressionist sculpture also happens to be his most well-known ‘incomplete’ figure. This work personifies the latter part of Rodin’s career: the dynamic pose of a partial figure. Deriving much from Rodin’s earlier work [[Saint John the Baptist (Rodin)|''St. John the Baptist Preaching'']], including the powerful stance, Rodin had stripped all academic associations from his figure, and instead focused on what he considered essential: the dynamic pose.

According to the bibliography supplied by the [[National Gallery of Art]], ''The Walking Man'' is a version of St. John without head and arms. This sculpture was previously considered a preliminary study for the complete Baptist and was based on the movement of that piece. According to Albert Elsen and [[Henry Moore]]'s suggestions, ''The Walking Man'' was created for the purpose of a Roman or Greek art without any live reference.{{Clarify|date=February 2013}}

The art historian [[Leo Steinberg]] said of ''The Walking Man''’s pose: &lt;blockquote&gt;
The stance is profoundly unclassical, especially in the digging-in conveyed by the pigeon-toed stride and the rotation of the upper torso. Unlike the balanced, self-possessed classical posture with both feet turned out, Rodin uses the kind of step that brings all power to bear on the moment’s work
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The statue has served as the inspiration for the works of other artists, such as [[Carl Sandburg]], who described it in his 1916 poem, "The Walking Man of Rodin": &lt;blockquote&gt;
THE WALKING MAN OF RODIN&lt;br /&gt;
Legs hold a torso away from the earth.&lt;br /&gt;
And a regular high poem of legs is here.&lt;br /&gt;
Powers of bone and cord raise a belly and lungs&lt;br /&gt;
Out of ooze and over the loam where eyes look and ears hear&lt;br /&gt;
And arms have a chance to hammer and shoot and run motors.&lt;br /&gt;
You make us&lt;br /&gt;
Proud of our legs, old man.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And you left off the head here,&lt;br /&gt;
The skull found always crumbling neighbor of the ankles. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Thomson Reuters Business Classification''' ('''TRBC''') is an [[industry classification]] of global companies; it is owned and operated by [[Thomson Reuters]] and is also the basis for [[Thomson Reuters Indices]].

==Coverage==
TRBC covers over 70,000 public companies from 130 countries and provides over 10 years of classification history. The classification consists of five levels of hierarchical structure. Each company is allocated an Industry, which falls under an Industry group, then Business Sector, which is then part of an overall economic sector. TRBC consists of 10 economic sectors, 28 business sectors, 54 industry groups, 143 industries and 837 Activities.

The top four levels are as follows:

==A market-based classification==
TRBC is a market-based classification schema, similar to the [[Global Industry Classification Standard|GICS]] and [[Industry Classification Benchmark|ICB]] systems. These classify companies on the basis of degree of impact on markets, rather than establishment-based classification systems such as the [[North American Industry Classification System]](NAICS).

==Use of TRBC==
TRBC is used primarily in the Financial Investment and Advisory space, where investors identify and select groups of comparable companies and look at trends. More specifically, this could be Investment Managers allocating funds and benchmarking their portfolios; Investment Bankers highlighting acquisition targets and opportunities for financial restructuring, or more generally corporates performing competitive analysis of their peers in the marketplace.

'''Tower Hill''' is a complex [[town square|city]] or [[garden square]] northwest of the [[Tower of London]], in the [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets]] just outside the [[City of London]] boundary yet inside what remains of the [[London Wall]] &amp;mdash; a large fragment of which survives toward its east.&lt;ref name=hbwheatley&gt;{{cite book |last=Wheatley |first=Henry Benjamin |authorlink=Henry B. Wheatley |year=1891 |last2=Cunningham |first2=Peter |authorlink2=Peter Cunningham (writer, born 1816) |chapter=Tower Hill |title=[[London Past and Present]] |location=London |publisher=John Murray |volume=vol. 3 |pages=400–402 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QKYPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was an [[extra-parochial area]] with moniker Great Tower Hill.&lt;ref name=hbwheatley/&gt; For centuries it hosted public executions, particularly of [[attainder|attainted peers]] and today it is notable for being the site of the [[Tower Hill Memorial]] in its '''Trinity Square Gardens''' which are adjoined by its two smaller public gardens, Wakefield and Tower Gardens. The latter are lined by a web of pavements which cut short '''Trinity Square''', rendering it a curved park-lined street.

==Location==
The set of gardens and buildings surrounding are served by [[Tower Gateway DLR station|Tower Gateway DLR]] and [[Tower Hill tube station]]s. The street Tower Hill forms an edge of the congestion charging zone between [[Byward Street]] in the west and a junction with [[Minories]] and Tower Hill Terrace in the east.

==History==

[[File:London Tower Hill Scaffold Site.JPG|thumb|Site of the Scaffold on Tower Hill]]

===Settlement===
In one of the oldest parts of London, [[archeology|archaeological]] evidence shows that there was a settlement on the hill in the [[Bronze Age]] and much later a [[Roman Britain|Roman]] village that was burnt down during the [[Boudica]] uprising. A nearby church, [[All Hallows-by-the-Tower]], is known for fragments of [[Romanesque architecture]] dating back to &lt;small&gt;AD&lt;/small&gt; 680; the church itself dates from 675.

===Local government===
Great Tower Hill was an [[extra-parochial area]] within the [[Liberties of the Tower of London|Tower Liberty]], under the direct administrative control of the Tower of London and outside the jurisdiction of the [[City of London]] and the county of [[Middlesex]]. In 1855 the area became part of the district of the [[Metropolitan Board of Works]]. 

The "District of Tower" became part of the [[Whitechapel District (Metropolis)|Whitechapel District]], under the authority of the Whitechapel District Board of Works. This was ambiguous and The Great Tower Hill Act 1869 was required to explicitly interpret it as [[Old Tower Without]], including within it Great Tower Hill.&lt;ref&gt;The Statutes of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Great Britain, His Majesty's Statute and Law Printers, (1869)&lt;/ref&gt; The Tower Liberty was abolished in 1894 and incorporated into the [[County of London]].

===Executions===
[[Capital punishment|Public executions]] of high-profile traitors and criminals were often carried out on Tower Hill, including:
* 1381 – [[Simon Sudbury]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]&lt;ref name="sitesign2"&gt;[[:File:Tower Hill scaffold location - Sign 2.jpg|Sign at site of the scaffold (2)]]&lt;/ref&gt; (beheaded by an angry mob)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9234">A '''web directory''' or '''link directory''' is an online list or catalog of [[website]]s. That is, it is a directory on the [[World Wide Web]] of (all or part of) the World Wide Web. Historically, directories typically listed entries on people or businesses, and their contact information; such directories are still in use today. A web directory includes entries about websites, including links to those websites, organized into [[Categorization|categories]] and subcategories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Web directory|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/web+directory|publisher=Dictionary|accessdate=30 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="about.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://websearch.about.com/od/enginesanddirectories/a/subdirectory.htm|title=What is a Web Directory|accessdate=2010-02-25|publisher=About.com|author=Wendy Boswell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Web Directory Or Directories|url=http://www.yourmaindomain.com/web-articles/what-is-web-directory.asp|publisher=yourmaindomain|accessdate=30 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides a link, each entry may include the title of the website, and a description of its contents. In most web directories, the entries are about whole websites, rather than individual pages within them (called "deep links"). Websites are often limited to inclusion in only a few categories. 

There are two ways to find information on the Web: by [[Web search engine|searching]] or [[browsing]]. Web directories provide links in a structured list to make browsing easier. Many web directories combine searching and browsing by providing a search engine to search the directory. Unlike search engines, which base results on a database of entries gathered automatically by [[web crawler]], most web directories are built manually by human editors. Many web directories allow site owners to submit their site for inclusion, and have editors review submissions for fitness.

Web directories may be general in scope, or limited to particular subjects or fields. Entries may be listed for free, or by paid submission (meaning the site owner must pay to have his or her website listed).

'''RSS directories''' are similar to web directories, but contain collections of [[RSS feeds]], instead of links to web sites.

==History==
During the early development of the web,  there was a list of [[webserver]]s edited by [[Tim Berners-Lee]] and hosted on the [[CERN]] webserver. One historical snapshot from 1992 remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/DataSources/WWW/Servers.html |title=World-Wide Web Servers |publisher=W3.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also created the [[World Wide Web Virtual Library]], which is the oldest web directory.&lt;ref name="searchenginehistory.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.searchenginehistory.com/|title=History of Search Engines: From 1945 to Google Today|accessdate=2017-05-16|publisher=Search Engine History|author=Aaron Wall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope of listing==
Most of the directories are general in scope and list websites across a wide range of categories, regions and languages. But some niche directories focus on restricted regions, single languages, or specialist sectors. One type of niche directory with a large number of sites in existence is the [[shopping directory]]. Shopping directories specialize in the listing of retail [[e-commerce]] sites.

Examples of well-known general web directories are [[Yahoo! Directory]] (shut down at the end of 2014) and [[DMOZ]] (shut down on March 14, 2017). DMOZ was significant due to its extensive categorization and large number of listings and its [[open content|free availability]] for use by other directories and search engines.&lt;ref name="newscom"&gt;Paul Festa (December 27, 1999), [http://www.news.com/2100-1023-234893.html Web search results still have human touch], ''CNET News.com'', retrieved September 18, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a debate over the quality of directories and databases still continues, as search engines use ODP's content without real integration, and some experiment using [[Data clustering|clustering]].

== Development ==

There have been many attempts to make building web directories easier, such as using automated submission of related links by script, or any number of available [[PHP]] portals and programs. Recently, [[social software]] techniques have spawned new efforts of categorization, with [[Amazon.com]] adding [[Tag (metadata)|tagging]] to their product pages.

== Monetizing ==
Directories have various features in their listings, often depending upon the price paid for inclusion:
* Cost
** Free submission&amp;nbsp;– there is no charge for the review and listing of the site
** Paid submission&amp;nbsp;– a one-time or recurring fee is charged for reviewing/listing the submitted link
* [[No follow]]&amp;nbsp;– there is a &lt;code&gt;rel="nofollow"&lt;/code&gt; attribute associated with the link, meaning search engines will give no weight to the link
* Featured listing&amp;nbsp;– the link is given a premium position in a category (or multiple categories) or other sections of the directory, such as the homepage. Sometimes called sponsored listing.
* Bid for position&amp;nbsp;– where sites are ordered based on bids
* [[affiliate marketing|Affiliate links]]&amp;nbsp;– where the directory earns commission for referred customers from the listed websites
* Reciprocity
** Reciprocal link&amp;nbsp;– a link back to the directory must be added somewhere on the submitted site in order to get listed in the directory. This strategy has decreased in popularity due to changes in SEO algorithms which can make it less valuable or counterproductive.&lt;ref&gt;

What you should definitely avoid are manipulative reciprocal linking schemes like automated link trading programs and three-way links or four-way links."}}

&lt;/ref&gt;
** No Reciprocal link&amp;nbsp;– a web directory where you will submit your links for free and no need to add link back to your website

==Human-edited directories==
A human-edited directory is created and maintained by editors who add links based on the policies particular to that directory.
Human-edited directories are often targeted by [[search engine optimization|SEOs]] on the basis that links from reputable sources will improve rankings in the major [[Web search engine|search engine]]s. Some directories may prevent search engines from rating a displayed link by using redirects, [[nofollow]] attributes, or other techniques. Many human-edited directories, including [[DMOZ]], [[World Wide Web Virtual Library]], [[Business.com]] and [[Jasmine Directory]], are edited by volunteers, who are often experts in particular categories. These directories are sometimes criticized due to long delays in approving submissions, or for rigid organizational structures and disputes among volunteer editors.

In response to these criticisms, some volunteer-edited directories have adopted [[wiki]] technology, to allow broader community participation in editing the directory (at the risk of introducing lower-quality, less objective entries).

Another direction taken by some web directories is the paid for inclusion model. This method enables the directory to offer timely inclusion for submissions and generally fewer listings as a result of the paid model. They often offer additional listing options to further enhance listings, including features listings and additional links to inner pages of the listed website. These options typically have an additional fee associated but offer significant help and visibility to sites and/or their inside pages.

Today submission of websites to web directories is considered a common SEO ([[search engine optimization]]) technique to get back-links for the submitted website. One distinctive feature of 'directory submission' is that it cannot be fully automated like search engine submissions. Manual directory submission is a tedious and time-consuming job and is often outsourced by [[webmasters]].

==Bid for Position directories==
'''Bid for Position directories''', also known as bidding web directories, are paid-for-inclusion web directories where the listings of websites in the directory are ordered according to their bid amount. They are special in that the more a person pays, the higher up the list of websites in the directory they go. With the higher listing, the website becomes more visible and increases the chances that visitors who browse the directory will click on the listing.

'''William (Boy) Habraken''' is a shoe collector who resides in the Netherlands. His collection is housed in the [[SONS Museum]] in Kruishouten, Belgium. In 2006 the [[Guinness Book of World Records]]&lt;ref&gt;2007 ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]''&lt;/ref&gt; recognized him as having the largest ethnographical shoe collection in the world.

== Biography ==
William (Boy) Habraken was born at the end of World War II in Eindhoven, The Netherlands. At the age of twenty he separated from his father's shoe-business and started his own import/wholesale company in footwear. In 1970 he moved to Taiwan to become one of the first people to export shoes from there and China to Europe. He stood at the base of some of the largest footwear concerns in Europe. Extensive business travel brought him all over the world, visiting over 120 countries. On many of those trips and in his spare time he collected footwear which was part of traditional indigenous clothing. As important as the shoes themselves were to him, was the related information, such as; the materials used, the way of making, the use, the age and the name in the native language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refdag.nl/achtergrond/consument/belangrijke_mensen_versieren_hun_voeten_1_220941 |title=Belangrijke mensen versieren hun voeten - Consument - RD.nl |website=Refdag.nl |date=2013-09-10 |accessdate=2016-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collections ==
[[File:YokohamaShoemaker.jpg|thumb|Yokohama shoemaker]]

=== Ethnographic collection ===
Starting with his first pair in 1968, he acquired a unique collection of over 3400 pairs of shoes out of about 155 countries, states and territories. There are exceptional specimens of North-American Indians, Arctic Inuit, African tribes, Berber, Bedouin, Mongols, the Ottoman - and the pre-Inca empires. Extensive parts of the collection originate in Japan, India, Iran, Tibet and Pakistan. Europe is represented from Iceland to Russia and from Lapland to Spain. The collection has a broad range of footwear. Examples are Kadaichi shoes made of emu feathers and human hair (used by Australian native executioners). Beautiful bride-shoes from Afghanistan, India, Syria and Turkey. As a native of the Netherlands he of course also collected many wooden shoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shoesornoshoes.com/?page=collection&amp;cat=ethno |title=SONS - Shoes Or No Shoes? |website=Shoesornoshoes.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Designer collection ===
Next to the ethnographic collection, William Habraken also collected a comprehensive collection of unique pieces of well known shoe designers from around the world. The collection comprises amongst others rare designs of 20th century designers such as [[André Perugia]] and [[Salvatore Ferragamo]], and from contemporary designers such as [[Christian Louboutin]] and [[Manolo Blahnik]].

== Works ==
===''Tribal and Ethnic Footwear of the World''===
His ethnographical collection served as a basis for his influential book ''Tribal and Ethnic Footwear of The World'', which tells stories of footwear around the world.&lt;ref name="Kawamura2016"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kanamura |first=Yuniya |title=Sneakers: Fashion, Gender, and Subculture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RCHrCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA22 |date=28 January 2016 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |isbn=978-1-4742-6292-7 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{ISBN|90-76295-12-3}}

===''Did the Gods Wear Shoes?''===
In his quest to unearth every possible detail of his collection and the history of each pair, he pondered the question of who wore the first pair of shoes. This question resulted in his second book with the title ''Did the Gods Wear Shoes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://didthegodswearshoes.com/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217102759/http://didthegodswearshoes.com/ |title=Did the Gods wear shoes? |archivedate=17 December 2014 |accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{ISBN|978-90-818079-2-0}}    

=== ''They Who Came Before Us'' ===
In the book "Did the Gods wear shoes"  the author explored the possible existence of prior civilizations. In his sequel "They who came before us" he provides the basis for that possibility. The book focuses on prehistoric mason works around the world. The author uses many detailed pictures along with personal observations to establish an alternative to mainstream historical believes.&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|9 789081 807937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Public ==
=== Lectures===
He holds lectures on a regular basis, a notable example occurred on March 14, 2016 when he was invited to give a lecture in [[British Museum|The British Museum]] in London titled: "[http://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/events_calendar/event_detail.aspx?eventId=2839&amp;title=A%20long%20journey:%20my%20footwear%20collection%20from%20the%20Islamic%20world&amp;eventType=Lecture A long journey: my footwear collection from the Islamic world]"

=== Exposition ===
In January 2017 he was invited to design the layout for an exhibition titled "[http://www.goodplanet.be/projecten/expo/docs/Flyer-HumanMigration-NL_web.pdf Human Migration]" in the peristilium of the Federal Government building in [[Brussels]] [[Belgium]]. He used shoes of his collection as a symbol to illustrate the road migrants followed in past and presence. This unique exhibition was honoured by a visit of [[Jean-Claude Juncker|Jean-Claude Junker]], President of the European Commission. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.goodplanet.be/projecten/expo/docs/03_uitleendossier-Expo-Human-Migration-NL_web.pdf|title=Expo Human Migration|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.quefaire.be/exposition-human-migration-757171.shtml|title=Exposition Human Migration|website=Quefaire.be|language=fr|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/blsde_02677023|title=Werk van striptekenaar Gilbert Declercq prominent in expo 'Human migration'|last=Groote|first=Stefaan De|work=Het Nieuwsblad|access-date=2018-02-28|language=nl-BE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="The Golden Cow"===
On December 12, 2013 the Schoenen en Lederwaren Sociëteit de Langstraat (SeLL) (Shoe and Leather Society Langstraat) announced that Mr. Habraken was the winner of The Golden Cow.
Jury chairman Ellis French said "The jury admired the innovative and dynamic entrepreneurship of Mr. Habraken. As one of the first people he successfully pioneered shoes in the Far East. His vision has adapted to the ever-changing landscape of the industry. Along with that there is the passion with which he collects ethnic footwear from around the world, the associated stories recorded in books and the more than 2000 pairs he exhibits in a private museum, are all reasons why he deserves The Golden Cow!

'''Woutherus Mol''' (21 March 1785 in [[Haarlem]] &amp;ndash; 30 August 1857 in Haarlem), was a 19th-century painter and drawer from the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="GVS"&gt;{{cite web |first1=Roeland |last1=van Eijnden |first2=Adriaan|last2=van der Willigen |url=http://www.historici.nl/retroboeken/vaderlandsche_schilderkunst/#source=III&amp;page=-1&amp;accessor=accessor_index |title=Geschiedenis der Vaderlandse Schilderkunst, 2nd part p.266-269|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KNAW"&gt;[http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00001922 Mol's record] in the [[KNAW]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Once Mol chose to make a living out of painting, he was tutored by the Haarlem painter [[Hermanus van Brussel]].&lt;ref name=RKD&gt;[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/56609 Woutherus Mol] in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1802 he became a member of the  Haarlem drawing society "[[Tekengenootschap Kunstmin en Vlijt]]". After he got excited about the Paris Art Museum where many master pieces resided, he obtained permission from his parents and moved there in 1806, provided with recommendations for the floral painter [[Gerard van Spaendonck]] who taught at the institute in Paris.&lt;ref name="GVS"/&gt; But since Mol showed much more interest in historical paintings, he took lessons from [[Jacques-Louis David]] (the famous historical painter who also taught there) and in 1807 he was awarded the [[Prix de Rome (Netherlands)|Dutch Prix de Rome]] from King [[Louis Napoleon of Holland]] and received a scholarship as "Hollandsch Kweekeling" (Hollandic pupil) to study and work in Paris.&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt; Since one of the requirements for this scholarship was that he would send in some of his work to exhibitions, his painting of the Holy Family (after [[Raphael]]) was exhibited in 1810 in the Amsterdam art exhibition. In Paris he built up a life as a painter and he never used the scholarship to actually visit and study in Rome.&lt;ref name=Aa&gt;[http://www.inghist.nl/retroboeken/vdaa?source=aa__001biog15_01.xml&amp;page_number=924 Wouterus Mol] in biography of Van der Aa&lt;/ref&gt;

After the restoration of the Netherlands in 1813, he returned to his home town Haarlem where he further developed his talent by studying the Dutch masters, for which the Amsterdam museum offered him plenty of opportunity.&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt; In 1818 he made his name with his submission to the Amsterdam art exhibition named "The Death of Prince William I", based on the only known portrait taken of [[William the Silent|Prince William I]] on his deathbed (surrounded by his family and important figures of the time) by [[Christiaen Jansz van Bieselingen]]. This was his first submission that was truly original and not mainly a copy of an existing masterpiece.&lt;ref name=Aa/&gt; 

Already during the exhibition the painting was popular, and 1000 guilders was offered for it. This painting was finally purchased by the mother of the king for 1800 florins to give as a present to her daughter-in-law. Due mostly to this success, he became an honorary member of the [[Royal Academy of Brussels]] (Koninklijke Academie voor Schone Kunsten te Brussel).&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt;&lt;ref name="GVS"/&gt; Even though he submitted multiple portraits during that very exhibition, this excellent work also caused rumors about his (lack of) portraiture abilities since it was not entirely by his own hand.&lt;ref name=Aa/&gt; In 1826 he was admitted as member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences|Koninklijk Instituut]] as a correspondent in the fourth class.&lt;ref name="KNAW"/&gt;

His later works were considered to be of inferior quality, and public opinion turned against him, though his friends continued to encourage him. Woutherus Mol had a nervous breakdown, and in 1846, he entered the "Rooms-Katholieke Wees- en armenhuis" (the Catholic alsmhouse, or Diaconie, which building is currently in use as police station) in Haarlem, where he died in 1857.&lt;ref name=Aa/&gt; During this last decade of his life he no longer painted. The [[Teylers Museum]] in Haarlem has one of his works, entitled ''Sleeping boy''.&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt; He is known for interiors and genre scenes.&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt;
