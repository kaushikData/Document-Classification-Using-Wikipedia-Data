'''OpenMeetings''' is software used for [[Web based presentation tools|presenting]], online training, [[web conferencing]], [[Collaborative software|collaborative whiteboard drawing and document editing]], and user desktop sharing. The product is based on   [[Red5 (media server)|Red5 media server,]] [[HTML5]] and  [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] which in turn are based on a number of open source components. Communication takes place in virtual "meeting rooms" which may be set to different communication, security and video quality modes. The recommended database engine for backend support is [[MySQL]]. The product can be set up as an installed server product, or used as a hosted service.

Work on OpenMeetings started in 2007 by Sebastian Wagner. Since 2009 the project became open which helped to involve other developers from different countries. Starting from 2011 main project development and technical support moved to Russia. In the meantime, web conferencing services based on OpenMeetings formally are offered by about a dozen companies around the world. Since 2012, the project is being developed under the auspices of open-source devoted [[Apache Software Foundation]] (ASF) and possesses [[Apache License]], which allows it to be used in commercial projects. Since 2012 OpenMeetings progress is presented regularly at the [[ApacheCon]].

Public facilities include the educational intranet "Koblenzer Schulnetz" in [[Koblenz]], Germany and two public demo-servers.&lt;ref&gt;http://openmeetings.apache.org/demo.html&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Contains Indic text}}

'''Bakāsana''' ({{lang-sa|बकासन}}, '''Crane Pose'''), often used interchangeably with '''Kakāsana''' ({{lang-sa|काकासन}}, '''Crow Pose''') is an [[asana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/468 | title=Yoga Journal - Crane Pose | accessdate=9 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all variations, this is an arm balancing pose in which hands are planted on the floor, shins rest upon upper arms, and feet lift up.&lt;ref name="Belling2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Belling |first=Noa |title=The Yoga Handbook |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6rTnpOiFVEMC&amp;pg=PT35 |date=20 February 2008 |publisher=New Holland Publishers |isbn=978-1-84537-935-3 |page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

The two names for the asana come from the [[Sanskrit]] words ''baka'' ("crane") or ''kak'' ("crow"), and ''asana'' (आसन) meaning "posture" or "seat".&lt;ref name="Sinha1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sinha|first=S.C.|title=Dictionary of Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-zzRvh1fRzEC&amp;pg=PA18|accessdate=9 April 2011|date=1 June 1996|publisher=Anmol Publications PVT. LTD.|isbn=978-81-7041-293-9|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KingslandKingsland1976"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Kingsland| first1=Kevin| last2=Kingsland
| first2=Venika| title=Complete hatha yoga| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GmdK1ZNOKroC | year=1976| publisher=Arco | isbn=978-0-668-03958-1| page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While different yoga lineages use one name or another for the asana, [[Dharma Mittra]] makes a distinction, citing Kakasana as being with arms bent (like the shorter legs of a crow) and Bakasana with arms straight (like the longer legs of a crane).&lt;ref name="Mittra2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mittra|first=Dharma|authorlink=Dharma Mittra|title=Asanas: 608 Yoga Postures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ev8EAAAACAAJ|accessdate=25 June 2011|date=21 March 2003|publisher=New World Library|isbn=978-1-57731-402-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the west, practitioners often mistranslate the Sanskrit "Bakasana" as the [[English language|English]] "Crow Pose".&lt;ref name="Belling2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ray Long 2009"&gt;{{cite book| last=Long| first=Ray| title=The Key Muscles of Yoga: The Scientific Keys, Volume 1| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hrx_jhsD784C&amp;pg=PA230| accessdate=9 April 2011| date=August 2009| publisher=Greenleaf Books | isbn=978-1-60743-238-8 | page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

This asana is considered an arm balance. According to [[B.K.S. Iyengar]] there are two techniques for entering into this balance. The simple method of achieving it is by pushing up from a crouching position. The advanced method is to drop down from a [[head stand]].&lt;ref name="Iyengar 1987"&gt;{{cite book|last=Iyengar|first=B.K.S.|title=Light On Yoga|origyear=1966|year=1987|publisher=Schocken Books|location=New York|isbn=0-8052-0610-8|pages=315–317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits ==

The asana strengthens the shoulders, arms, wrists and hands, as well as the core muscles and organs of the [[abdomen]].&lt;ref name="Iyengar 1987" /&gt;

== Variations ==
[[File:P kakasana wiki.png|thumb|Eka Pada Koundiyanasana I]]

Asymmetric variations include:
*[[Parsva Bakasana]] (Side Crane Pose) in which one thigh rests on the opposite upper arm and the other leg is stacked on top of the first&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/2478 | title = Yoga Journal - Side Crane Pose | accessdate=2011-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stearn1965"&gt;{{cite book| last=Stearn| first=Jess| title=Yoga, youth, and reincarnation | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VrPwAAAAIAAJ| accessdate=9 April 2011| year=1965| publisher=Doubleday| page=348}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Eka Pada Bakasana]]/Kakasana (One-Legged Crane/Crow Pose respectively) in which one leg remains in Bakasana while the other extends straight back.&lt;ref name="Hewitt1990"&gt;{{cite book
| last=Hewitt| first=James| title=Complete Yoga Book| url=https://books.google.combooks?id=EntWAAAAYAAJ| date=3 January 1990| publisher=Schocken Books| page=357}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Eka Pada Koundiyanasana I]] (Sage Koundinya Pose I)  in which one leg remains in Bakasana while the other extends diagonally back and to the side.
* [[Eka Pada Koundiyanasana II]] (Sage Koundinya Pose II) / [[Ardha Titibasana]] (Half Firefly Pose), in which one leg is as in Bakasana, and the other extends diagonally forward as in [[Titibasana]]

== Follow-up asanas ==

Crane/Crow is often followed by [[Chaturanga Dandasana]] (Four-Limbed Staff Pose) or Salamba Sirsasana II (Supported Head Stand, Second version). Some practitioners jump in and out of Crane/Crow via [[Adho Mukha Svanasana]] (Downward-Facing Dog Pose). Related hand balances include [[Astavakrasana]] (Eight-Crooks Pose) and Titibasana (Firefly Pose).

* This article '''presents an incomplete view of the subject'''.
}}
{{anchor|Minterm|Maxterm}}In [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]], any [[Boolean function]] can be put into the '''canonical disjunctive normal form''' ('''CDNF''') or '''minterm canonical form''' and its dual '''canonical conjunctive normal form''' ('''CCNF''') or '''maxterm canonical form'''.  Other canonical forms include the complete sum of prime implicants or [[Blake canonical form]] (and its dual), and the [[algebraic normal form]]  (also called Zhegalkin or Reed–Muller).

''Minterms'' are called products because they are the [[logical AND]] of a set of variables, and ''maxterms'' are called sums because they are the [[logical OR]] of a set of variables. These concepts are dual because of their complementary-symmetry relationship as expressed by [[De Morgan's laws]].

Two dual canonical forms of ''any'' Boolean function are a "sum of minterms" and a "product of maxterms." The term "'''Sum of Products'''" or "'''SoP'''" is widely used for the canonical form that is a disjunction (OR) of minterms. Its [[De Morgan dual]] is a "'''Product of Sums'''" or "'''PoS'''" for the canonical form that is  a conjunction (AND) of maxterms. These forms can be useful for the simplification of these functions, which is of great importance in the optimization of Boolean formulas in general and digital circuits in particular.

==Summary==
One application of Boolean algebra is digital circuit design.  The goal may be to minimize the number of gates, to minimize the settling time, etc.

There are sixteen possible functions of two variables, but in digital logic hardware, the simplest gate circuits implement only four of them: ''[[logical conjunction|conjunction]]'' (AND), ''[[logical disjunction|disjunction]]'' (inclusive OR), and the respective complements of those (NAND and NOR).

Most gate circuits accept more than 2 input variables; for example, the spaceborne [[Apollo Guidance Computer]], which pioneered the application of integrated circuits in the 1960s, was built with only one type of gate, a 3-input NOR, whose output is true only when all 3 inputs are false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Eldon C. |last= Hall |title= Journey to the Moon: The History of the Apollo Guidance Computer |publisher= AIAA |date= 1996 |isbn= 1-56347-185-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minterms==
For a [[boolean function]] of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; variables &lt;math&gt;{x_1,\dots,x_n}&lt;/math&gt;, a [[product term]] in which each of the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; variables appears '''once''' (in either its complemented or uncomplemented form) is called a ''minterm''. Thus, a ''minterm'' is a logical expression of ''n'' variables that employs only the ''complement'' operator and the ''conjunction'' operator.

For example, &lt;math&gt;abc&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;ab'c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;abc'&lt;/math&gt; are 3 examples of the 8 minterms for a Boolean function of the three variables &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;. The customary reading of the last of these is ''a AND b AND NOT-c''.

There are 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; minterms of ''n'' variables, since a variable in the minterm expression can be in either its direct or its complemented form—two choices per variable.

=== Indexing minterms ===

Minterms are often numbered by a binary encoding of the complementation pattern of the variables, where the variables are written in a standard order, usually alphabetical. This convention assigns the value 1 to the direct form (&lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;) and 0 to the complemented form (&lt;math&gt;x'_i&lt;/math&gt;); the minterm is then &lt;math&gt;\sum\limits_{i=1}^n2^i\operatorname{value}(x_i)&lt;/math&gt;. For example, minterm &lt;math&gt;a b c'&lt;/math&gt; is numbered 110&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; and denoted &lt;math&gt;m_6&lt;/math&gt;.

===Functional equivalence===
A given minterm ''n'' gives a true value (i.e., 1) for just one combination of the input variables. For example, minterm 5, ''a'' ''b''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''c'', is true only when ''a'' and ''c'' both are true and ''b'' is false—the input arrangement where ''a'' = 1, ''b'' = 0, ''c'' = 1 results in 1.

Given the [[truth table]] of a logical function, it is possible to write the function as a "sum of products". This is a special form of [[disjunctive normal form]]. For example, if given the truth table for the arithmetic sum bit ''u'' of one bit position's logic of an adder circuit, as a function of ''x'' and ''y'' from the addends and the carry in, ''ci'':

{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto"
!width="50"|ci
!width="50"|x
!width="50"|y
!width="50"|u(ci,x,y)
|-
|0||0||0||0
|-
|0||0||1||1
|-
|0||1||0||1
|-
|0||1||1||0
|-
|1||0||0||1
|-
|1||0||1||0
|-
|1||1||0||0
|-
|1||1||1||1
|}

Observing that the rows that have an output of 1 are the 2nd, 3rd, 5th, and 8th, we can write ''u'' as a sum of minterms &lt;math&gt;m_1, m_2, m_4,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_7&lt;/math&gt;. If we wish to verify this: &lt;math&gt; u(ci,x,y) = m_1 + m_2 + m_4 + m_7 = (ci',x',y)+(ci',x,y') + (ci,x',y')+(ci,x,y)&lt;/math&gt; evaluated for all 8 combinations of the three variables will match the table.

== Maxterms ==
For a [[boolean function]] of {{mvar|n}} variables &lt;math&gt;{x_1,\dots,x_n}&lt;/math&gt;, a sum term in which each of the {{mvar|n}} variables appears '''once''' (in either its complemented or uncomplemented form) is called a ''maxterm''. Thus, a ''maxterm'' is a logical expression of {{mvar|n}} variables that employs only the ''complement''  operator and the ''disjunction'' operator. Maxterms are a dual of the minterm idea (i.e., exhibiting a complementary symmetry in all respects). Instead of using ANDs and complements, we use ORs and complements and proceed similarly.

For example, the following are two of the eight maxterms of three variables:
: ''a'' + ''b''&amp;prime; + ''c''
: ''a''&amp;prime; + ''b'' + ''c''

There are again 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; maxterms of {{mvar|n}} variables, since a variable in the maxterm expression can also be in either its direct or its complemented form—two choices per variable.

=== Indexing maxterms===
Each maxterm is assigned an index based on the opposite conventional binary encoding used for minterms. The maxterm convention assigns the value 0 to the direct form &lt;math&gt;(x_i)&lt;/math&gt; and 1 to the complemented form &lt;math&gt;(x'_i)&lt;/math&gt;. For example, we assign the index 6 to the maxterm &lt;math&gt;a' + b' + c&lt;/math&gt; (110) and denote that maxterm as ''M''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. Similarly ''M''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of these three variables is &lt;math&gt;a + b + c&lt;/math&gt; (000) and ''M''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; is &lt;math&gt;a' + b' + c'&lt;/math&gt; (111).

===Functional equivalence===
It is apparent that maxterm ''n'' gives a ''false'' value (i.e., 0) for just one combination of the input variables. For example, maxterm 5, ''a''&amp;prime; + ''b'' + ''c''&amp;prime;, is false only when ''a'' and ''c'' both are true and ''b'' is false—the input arrangement where a = 1, b = 0, c = 1 results in 0.

If one is given a [[truth table]] of a logical function, it is possible to write the function as a "product of sums". This is a special form of [[conjunctive normal form]]. For example, if given the truth table for the carry-out bit ''co'' of one bit position's logic of an adder circuit, as a function of ''x'' and ''y'' from the addends and the carry in, ''ci'':

{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto"
!width="50"|ci
!width="50"|x
!width="50"|y
!width="50"|co(ci,x,y)
|-
|0||0||0||0
|-
|0||0||1||0
|-
|0||1||0||0
|-
|0||1||1||1
|-
|1||0||0||0
|-
|1||0||1||1
|-
|1||1||0||1
|-
|1||1||1||1
|}

Observing that the rows that have an output of 0 are the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 5th, we can write ''co'' as a product of maxterms &lt;math&gt;M_0, M_1, M_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M_4&lt;/math&gt;. If we wish to verify this:
:&lt;math&gt;co(ci, x, y) = M_0 M_1 M_2 M_4 = (ci + x + y) (ci + x + y') (ci + x' + y) (ci' + x + y)&lt;/math&gt;
evaluated for all 8 combinations of the three variables will match the table.

==Dualization==
The complement of a minterm is the respective maxterm. This can be easily verified by using [[de Morgan's law]]. For example:
&lt;math&gt;M_5 = a' + b + c' = (a b' c)' = m_5'&lt;/math&gt;

==Non-canonical PoS and SoP forms==
It is often the case that the canonical minterm form can be simplified to an equivalent SoP form.
This simplified form would still consist of a sum of product terms. However, in the simplified form,
it is possible to have fewer product terms and/or product terms that contain fewer variables.
For example, the following 3-variable function:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto"
!width="50"|a
!width="50"|b
!width="50"|c
!width="50"|f(a,b,c)
|-
|0||0||0||0
|-
|0||0||1||0
|-
|0||1||0||0
|-
|0||1||1||1
|-
|1||0||0||0
|-
|1||0||1||0
|-
|1||1||0||0
|-
|1||1||1||1
|}

has the canonical minterm representation:
&lt;math&gt;f = a'bc + abc&lt;/math&gt;, but it has an equivalent simplified form:
&lt;math&gt;f = bc&lt;/math&gt;.
In this trivial example, it is obvious that &lt;math&gt;bc = a'bc + abc&lt;/math&gt;, but the simplified form has both fewer product terms,
and the term has fewer variables.
The most simplified SoP representation of a function is referred to as a ''minimal SoP form''.

In a similar manner, a canonical maxterm form can have a simplified PoS form.

While this example was easily simplified by applying normal algebraic methods [&lt;math&gt;f = (a' + a) b c&lt;/math&gt;], in less obvious cases a convenient method for finding the minimal PoS/SoP form of a function with up to four variables is using a [[Karnaugh map]].

The minimal PoS and SoP forms are very important for finding optimal implementations of boolean functions
and minimizing logic circuits.

==Application example==
The sample truth tables for minterms and maxterms above are sufficient to establish the canonical form for a single bit position in the addition of binary numbers, but are not sufficient to design the digital logic unless your inventory of gates includes AND and OR. Where performance is an issue (as in the Apollo Guidance Computer), the available parts are more likely to be NAND and NOR because of the complementing action inherent in transistor logic. The values are defined as voltage states, one near ground and one near the DC supply voltage V&lt;sub&gt;cc&lt;/sub&gt;, e.g. +5 VDC. If the higher voltage is defined as the 1 "true" value, a NOR gate is the simplest possible useful logical element.

Specifically, a 3-input NOR gate may consist of 3 bipolar junction transistors with their emitters all grounded, their collectors tied together and linked to V&lt;sub&gt;cc&lt;/sub&gt; through a load impedance. Each base is connected to an input signal, and the common collector point presents the output signal.  Any input that is a 1 (high voltage) to its base shorts its transistor's emitter to its collector, causing current to flow through the load impedance, which brings the collector voltage (the output) very near to ground. That result is independent of the other inputs. Only when all 3 input signals are 0 (low voltage) do the emitter-collector impedances of all 3 transistors remain very high.  Then very little current flows, and the voltage-divider effect with the load impedance imposes on the collector point a high voltage very near to V&lt;sub&gt;cc&lt;/sub&gt;.

The complementing property of these gate circuits may seem like a drawback when trying to implement a function in canonical form, but there is a compensating bonus: such a gate with only one input implements the complementing function, which is required frequently in digital logic.

This example assumes the Apollo parts inventory: 3-input NOR gates only, but the discussion is simplified by supposing that 4-input NOR gates are also available (in Apollo, those were compounded out of pairs of 3-input NORs).

===Canonical and non-canonical consequences of NOR gates===
Fact #1: a set of 8 NOR gates, if their inputs are all combinations of the direct and complement forms of the 3 input variables ''ci, x,'' and ''y'', always produce minterms, never maxterms—that is, of the 8 gates required to process all combinations of 3 input variables, only one has the output value 1.  That's because a NOR gate, despite its name, could better be viewed (using De Morgan's law) as the AND of the complements of its input signals.

Fact #2: the reason Fact #1 is not a problem is the duality of minterms and maxterms, i.e. each maxterm is the complement of the like-indexed minterm, and vice versa.

In the minterm example above, we wrote &lt;math&gt;u(ci, x, y) = m_1 + m_2 + m_4 + m_7&lt;/math&gt; but to perform this with a 4-input NOR gate we need to restate it as a product of sums (PoS), where the sums are the opposite maxterms.  That is,

:&lt;math&gt;u(ci, x, y) = \mathrm{AND}(M_0,M_3,M_5,M_6) = \mathrm{NOR}(m_0,m_3,m_5,m_6).&lt;/math&gt;

In the maxterm example above, we wrote &lt;math&gt;co(ci, x, y) = M_0 M_1 M_2 M_4&lt;/math&gt; but to perform this with a 4-input NOR gate we need to notice the equality to the NOR of the same minterms.  That is,

:&lt;math&gt;co(ci, x, y) = \mathrm{AND}(M_0,M_1,M_2,M_4) = \mathrm{NOR}(m_0,m_1,m_2,m_4).&lt;/math&gt;

===Design trade-offs considered in addition to canonical forms===
One might suppose that the work of designing an adder stage is now complete, but we haven't addressed the fact that all 3 of the input variables have to appear in both their direct and complement forms.  There's no difficulty about the addends ''x'' and ''y'' in this respect, because they are static throughout the addition and thus are normally held in latch circuits that routinely have both direct and complement outputs. (The simplest latch circuit made of NOR gates is a pair of gates cross-coupled to make a flip-flop: the output of each is wired as one of the inputs to the other.) There is also no need to create the complement form of the sum ''u''. However, the carry out of one bit position must be passed as the carry into the next bit position in both direct and complement forms.  The most straightforward way to do this is to pass ''co'' through a 1-input NOR gate and label the output ''co''&amp;prime;, but that would add a gate delay in the worst possible place, slowing down the rippling of carries from right to left. An additional 4-input NOR gate building the canonical form of ''co''&amp;prime; (out of the opposite minterms as ''co'') solves this problem.

: &lt;math&gt;co'(ci, x, y) = \mathrm{AND}(M_3,M_5,M_6,M_7) = \mathrm{NOR}(m_3,m_5,m_6,m_7).&lt;/math&gt;

The trade-off to maintain full speed in this way includes an unexpected cost (in addition to having to use a bigger gate). If we'd just used that 1-input gate to complement ''co'', there would have been no use for the minterm &lt;math&gt;m_7&lt;/math&gt;, and the gate that generated it could have been eliminated. Nevertheless, it's still a good trade.

Now we could have implemented those functions exactly according to their SoP and PoS canonical forms, by turning NOR gates into the functions specified.  A NOR gate is made into an OR gate by passing its output through a 1-input NOR gate; and it is made into an AND gate by passing each of its inputs through a 1-input NOR gate.  However, this approach not only increases the number of gates used, but also doubles the number of gate delays processing the signals, cutting the processing speed in half.  Consequently, whenever performance is vital, going beyond canonical forms and doing the Boolean algebra to make the unenhanced NOR gates do the job is well worthwhile.

===Top-down vs. bottom-up design===
We have now seen how the minterm/maxterm tools can be used to design an adder stage in canonical form with the addition of some Boolean algebra, costing just 2 gate delays for each of the outputs. That's the "top-down" way to design the digital circuit for this function, but is it the best way? The discussion has focused on identifying "fastest" as "best," and the augmented canonical form meets that criterion flawlessly, but sometimes other factors predominate. The designer may have a primary goal of minimizing the number of gates, and/or of minimizing the fanouts of signals to other gates since big fanouts reduce resilience to a degraded power supply or other environmental factors. In such a case, a designer may develop the canonical-form design as a baseline, then try a bottom-up development, and finally compare the results.

The bottom-up development involves noticing that ''u = ci'' XOR (''x'' XOR ''y''), where XOR means eXclusive OR [true when either input is true but not when both are true], and that ''co'' = ''ci x'' + ''x y'' + ''y ci''. One such development takes twelve NOR gates in all: six 2-input gates and two 1-input gates to produce ''u'' in 5 gate delays, plus three 2-input gates and one 3-input gate to produce ''co''&amp;prime; in 2 gate delays. The canonical baseline took eight 3-input NOR gates plus three 4-input NOR gates to produce ''u, co'' and ''co''&amp;prime; in 2 gate delays. If the circuit inventory actually includes 4-input NOR gates, the top-down canonical design looks like a winner in both gate count and speed. But if (contrary to our convenient supposition) the circuits are actually 3-input NOR gates, of which two are required for each 4-input NOR function, then the canonical design takes 14 gates compared to 12 for the bottom-up approach, but still produces the sum digit ''u'' considerably faster.  The fanout comparison is tabulated as:
{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto"

What's a decision-maker to do?  An observant one will have noticed that the description of the bottom-up development mentions ''co''&amp;prime; as an output but not ''co''.  Does that design simply never need the direct form of the carry out? Well, yes and no. At each stage, the calculation of ''co''&amp;prime; depends only on ''ci''&amp;prime;, ''x''&amp;prime; and ''y''&amp;prime;, which means that the carry propagation ripples along the bit positions just as fast as in the canonical design without ever developing ''co''. The calculation of ''u'', which does require ''ci'' to be made from ''ci''&amp;prime; by a 1-input NOR, is slower but for any word length the design only pays that penalty once (when the leftmost sum digit is developed). That's because those calculations overlap, each in what amounts to its own little pipeline without affecting when the next bit position's sum bit can be calculated. And, to be sure, the ''co''&amp;prime; out of the leftmost bit position will probably have to be complemented as part of the logic determining whether the addition overflowed. But using 3-input NOR gates, the bottom-up design is very nearly as fast for doing parallel addition on a non-trivial word length, cuts down on the gate count, and uses lower fanouts ... so it wins if gate count and/or fanout are paramount!

We'll leave the exact circuitry of the bottom-up design of which all these statements are true as an exercise for the interested reader, assisted by one more algebraic formula: ''u'' = ''ci''(''x'' XOR ''y'') + ''ci''&amp;prime;(''x'' XOR ''y'')&amp;prime;]&amp;prime;. Decoupling the carry propagation from the sum formation in this way is what elevates the performance of a ''carry-lookahead adder'' over that of a ''ripple carry adder''.

'''Carlin Romano''' is an American writer and educator. Romano is a critic-at-large for ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]].''  He teaches at [[Ursinus College]] and the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s [[Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania|Annenberg School for Communication]] part-time.

==Career==
Romano was a writer for the [[Philadelphia Inquirer]] for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/columnists/carlin_romano/|title=Carlin Romano|work=philly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He teaches at [[Ursinus College]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ursinus.edu/netcommunity/page.aspx?pid=628|title=Faculty|work=ursinus.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s [[Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania|Annenberg School for Communication]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asc.upenn.edu/Faculty/Faculty.aspx?pageType=adjunct Teaching Adjuncts at Annenberg School for Communications U of P] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920083442/http://www.asc.upenn.edu/Faculty/Faculty.aspx?pageType=adjunct |date=September 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=University of Pennsylvania course registrar |url=http://www.upenn.edu/registrar/register/PDF/comm.pdf |format=PDF |work=upenn.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021221017/http://www.upenn.edu/registrar/register/PDF/comm.pdf |archivedate=October 21, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He previously taught philosophy at [[Bennington College]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/weekly/v46/i34/34a02001.htm Extensive report on Bennington firing]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Robin.

In 1981, Romano reviewed books about philosophers for ''[[The Village Voice]] Literary Supplement''&lt;ref&gt;"The Wittgenstein Industry: Saving Ludwig from His Friends" by Carlin Romano, ''Voice Literary Supplement'', August 1982&lt;/ref&gt; and one book for ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Carlin Romano, Books, The New Yorker, March 13, 1995, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;  His writing has appeared in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304186404576389523194617398 The Dalai Lama, Marxist?

Romano contributed an article on [[Umberto Eco]] to Oxford University Press's ''[[Encyclopedia of Aesthetics]]''. In 1993, Romano wrote an essay for ''Danto and His Critics'' entitled, "Looking Beyond the Visible: The Case of Arthur C. Dantwo," about art critic [[Arthur Danto]].&lt;ref&gt;Rollins, Mark. ''Danto and His Critics'' Oxford, UK: Blackwell, 1993.  {{ISBN|978-0631183389}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his essay, Romano sets up a dichotomy between "pragmatism" and "Hegelianism" and finds statements in Danto's books that he claims fit into one of these two schools of thought. ''The Institution of Philosophy: A Discipline in Crisis?'' (published 1989 by Open Court, edited by Avner Cohen and Marcelo Dascal), includes a proposal by Romano to set up a World Court of Philosophy in which appointed philosophers would stipulate philosophical conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ralph Dumain]], [http://autodidactproject.org/blog/culture/index.php/2008/08/the-institution-of-philosophy-2/ review of Romano’s contribution to The Institution of Philosophy: A Discipline in Crisis?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Dumain, [http://autodidactproject.org/blog/culture/index.php/category/intellectual-life/ Four-part extended review of The Institution of Philosophy: A Discipline in Crisis?]&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote ''America the Philosophical'', a book with the main claim that the current United States has the "most philosophical culture in the history of the world."&lt;ref&gt;[http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?id=651&amp;fulltext=1 "Eden of Clowns by William Giraldi"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114140833/http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?id=651&amp;fulltext=1 |date=November 14, 2012 }}''The Los Angeles Review of Books'', May 21, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/01/books/review/america-the-philosophical-by-carlin-romano.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all |title=The Best of All Possible Worlds ‘America the Philosophical,’ by Carlin Romano |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 28, 2012 |accessdate=October 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Caws|first=Peter|title=America the Philosophical by Carlin Romano|url=http://philosophynow.org/issues/100/America_The_Philosophical_by_Carlin_Romano|publisher=Philosophynow.org|accessdate=January 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversial critiques==

===Martin Heidegger===
In the October 18, 2009 issue of ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education|The Chronicle]]'' in "Heil Heidegger!", citing Heidegger's well-known past Nazi affiliations, Romano was highly critical of [[Martin Heidegger]]'s work and its continued acceptance amongst American academics and intellectuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/article/Heil-Heidegger-/48806/ "Heil Heidegger!"] ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'', October 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The article was a review of the publication in English of French philosopher [[:fr:Emmanuel Faye|Emmanuel Faye]]’s ''Heidegger: The Introduction of Nazism into Philosophy in Light of the Unpublished Seminars of 1933–1935'' (first published in 2005, in France), highly critical of Heidegger for the same reason.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300120868 Presentation of Emmanuel Faye's book] Yale University Press, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Romano called on librarians to stop stocking the collected works of the German philosopher, which appear under the term ''[[Heidegger Gesamtausgabe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20121114140833/http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?id=651&amp;fulltext=1 William Giraldi:"In a 2009 piece for The Chronicle Review he hollered support for the banning of Heidegger's books — the German philosopher was a Nazi — right after neglecting to understand that banning books is an exceedingly Nazi thing to do."&lt;/ref&gt; This controversial article renewed public dialogue about the relation between a person's politics and the merit of their work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/blogs/blogs/browbeat/archive/2009/10/23/carlin-romano-s-wrongheaded-heidegger-assessment.aspx In ''Slate'', Stephen Metcalf addresses Romano’s argumentum ad hominem-inspired call to ban Heidegger's work as hate speech and to make fun of it, as Romano advocates in his essay]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/09/books/09philosophy.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=2&amp;ref=books "An Ethical Question: Does a Nazi Deserve a Place Among Philosophers?"]''The New York Times'', November 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catharine MacKinnon===
The publication of "the most controversial by far"&lt;ref&gt;[http://mtprof.msun.edu/Fall1994/TrtArt.html "L'Affaire MacKinnon"] ''The Montana Professor'', Vol.4, No.3, Fall 1994 by Paul Trout&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Only Words (book)|Only Words]]'' book review, written by Romano, provoked a strong reaction with his imagined description of himself raping the author, [[Catharine MacKinnon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,979960,00.html "Assault by Paragraph"] ''Time'', January 17, 1994 by Richard Lacayo &amp; Bonnie Angelo&lt;/ref&gt; This performative counterexample to MacKinnon's apparent contention that a rape in words is equivalent to a rape in deeds intensified the debate about legal sanctions against pornography. The philosopher Nancy Bauer in ''How to Do Things With Pornography'' described it as "a shockingly clueless and callous review."&lt;ref&gt;''How to Do Things with Pornography'' by Nancy Bauer, Harvard University Press (2015) page 193 See also page 192.&lt;/ref&gt; David Gates wrote, "Free-speech stalwart Nat Hentoff jumped in--on MacKinnon's side, claiming Romano 'set out to debase [her] person, along with her ideas.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/id/111687 "Free Speech—Or a Hostile Act?"] ''[[Newsweek]]'' January 16, 1994 by [[David Gates (author)|David Gates]]&lt;/ref&gt; Romano said in defense of this review, "The worst thing that can happen to a flamboyant claim is to be tested by a good example." &lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20121114140833/http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?id=651&amp;fulltext=1 William Giraldi:"Romano defended his minatory spew by claiming it was a thought experiment prompted by the book, but it was really just a starved attempt to thieve attention by trivializing crimes against women."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philip Roth===
In a 2007 book review of [[Philip Roth]]'s ''[[Exit Ghost]]'', Romano revived the long-standing controversy over the extent that Roth's fiction is autobiographical. He used [[Claire Bloom]]'s 1996 memoir ''Leaving a Doll's House'' as proof that Roth's books are "more autobiographical than imaginative."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2007/09/28/the-rake-s-progress-giving-up-the-ghost.html "The Rake’s Progress Giving Up The Ghost" by David Gates], ''[[Newsweek]]'', October 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
He wrote ''America the Philosophical'', a book with the main claim that the current United States has the "most philosophical culture in the history of the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Caws|first=Peter|title=America the Philosophical by Carlin Romano|url=http://philosophynow.org/issues/100/America_The_Philosophical_by_Carlin_Romano|publisher=Philosophynow.org|accessdate=January 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?id=651&amp;fulltext=1 "Eden of Clowns by William Giraldi"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114140833/http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?id=651&amp;fulltext=1 |date=November 14, 2012 }}''The Los Angeles Review of Books'', 21 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By&amp;nbsp;Jeff Simon |url=http://www.buffalonews.com/entertainment/gusto/books/book-reviews/article875387.ece |title=Amid rancor of U.S. politics, philosopher offers surprising thesis - Book reviews |publisher=The Buffalo News |date=2012-05-28 |accessdate=2012-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/01/books/review/america-the-philosophical-by-carlin-romano.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all |title=The Best of All Possible Worlds ‘America the Philosophical,’ by Carlin Romano |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 28, 2012 |accessdate=2012-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13063">'''Physical causal closure''' is a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] theory about the nature of causation in the [[Physical property|physical]] realm with significant ramifications in the study of [[metaphysics]] and [[Philosophy of mind|the mind]]. In a strongly stated version, physical causal closure says that "all physical states have ''pure'' physical causes" — [[Jaegwon Kim]],&lt;ref name="Kim1" /&gt; or that "physical effects have ''only'' physical causes" — Agustin Vincente, p.&amp;nbsp;150.&lt;ref name=Vicente /&gt;

Those who accept the theory tend, in general although not exclusively, to the physicalist view that all entities that exist are physical entities.  As Karl Popper says, "The physicalist principle of closedness of the physical ... is of decisive importance and I take it as the characteristic principle of physicalism or materialism."&lt;ref name=Popper/&gt;

==Definition==
Physical causal closure has stronger and weaker formulations.&lt;ref name=Montero/&gt;

The stronger formulations assert that "No physical event has a cause outside the physical domain." — Jaegwon Kim.&lt;ref name=Kim1/&gt; That is, they assert that for physical events, causes ''other'' than physical causes do not exist. (Physical events that are not causally ''determined'' may be said to have their objective ''chances of occurrence'' determined by physical causes.)&lt;ref name=Sarkar/&gt;

Weaker forms of the theory state that "Every physical event has a physical cause." — Barbara Montero,&lt;ref name=Montero/&gt; or that "Every physical effect (that is, caused event) has physical sufficient causes" — Agustin Vincente,&lt;ref name=Vicente /&gt; (According to Vincente, a number of caveats have to be observed, among which is the postulate that "physical entities" are entities postulated by a true theory of physics, a theory of which we are ignorant today, and that such a true theory "will not include mental (or in general, dubious) concepts" (Note 5, p.&amp;nbsp;168).&lt;ref name=Vicente /&gt;) or that "if we trace the causal ancestry of a physical event we need never go outside the physical domain." — Jaegwon Kim.&lt;ref name=Kim1/&gt;  Weaker forms of physical causal closure are synonymous with the ''causal completeness'',&lt;ref name="VelmansSchneider2008"/&gt; the notion that "Every physical effect that has a sufficient cause has a sufficient physical cause."&lt;ref name=Sarkar/&gt; That is, weaker forms allow that ''in addition'' to physical causes, there may be other kinds of causes for physical events.

The notion of [[Reduction (philosophy)|reductionism]] supplements physical causal closure with the claim that ''all'' events ultimately can be reduced to physical events. Under these circumstances, mental events are a subset of physical events and caused by them.&lt;ref name=Kim2/&gt;

==Importance==
Physical causal closure is especially important when considering [[Mind-body dualism|dualist]] theories of [[mind]]. If no physical event has a cause outside the physical realm, it would follow that non-physical [[mental events]] would be causally impotent in the physical world. However, as Kim has agreed, it seems intuitively problematic to strip mental events of their causal power.&lt;ref name=Kim1/&gt; Only epiphenomenalists would agree that mental events do not have causal power, but [[epiphenomenalism]] is objectionable to many philosophers. One way of maintaining the causal powers of mental events is to assert [[Anomalous monism|token identity]] [[non-reductive physicalism]]—that [[mental property|mental properties]] [[supervenience|supervene]] on neurological properties. That is, there can be no change in the mental without a corresponding change in the physical. Yet this implies that mental events can have two causes (physical and mental), a situation which apparently results in [[overdetermination]] (redundant causes), and denies the strong physical causal closure.&lt;ref name=Kim1/&gt; Kim argues that if the strong physical causal closure argument is correct, the only way to maintain mental causation is to assert [[Type physicalism|type identity]] [[reductive physicalism]]—that mental properties are neurological properties.&lt;ref name=Kim2/&gt;

==Criticism==

The validity of the physical causal closure has long been debated.&lt;ref name=Libet/&gt; In modern times, it has been pointed out that science is based on removing the subject from investigations, and by seeking objectivity. This outsider status for the observer, a third-person perspective, is said by some philosophers to have automatically severed science from the ability to examine subjective issues like consciousness and free will.&lt;ref name=Hong/&gt;&lt;ref name=NagelT/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mohrhoff/&gt; A different attack upon the physical causal closure discussed by Hodgson is to claim science itself does not support the physical causal closure.&lt;ref name=Hodgson/&gt; Some philosophers have criticized the argument for the physical causal closure by supporting [[teleology]] and mental-to-physical causation via a ''soul''.&lt;ref name=Goetz/&gt;

===Ignoring phenomena===
There seem ''prima facie'' to be irreducible purpose-based (or teleological) explanations of some natural phenomena. For instance, the movement of a writer's fingers on the keyboard and a reader's eyes across the screen is irreducibly explained in reference to the ''goal'' of writing an intelligible sentence or of learning about the physical causal closure arguments, respectively. On the face of it, an exclusively non-teleological (descriptive) account of the neurological and biological features of hand movement and eye movement misses the point. To say, "I am moving my fingers ''because'' my brain signals are triggering muscle motion in my arms" is true, but does not exhaustively explain all the causes. Both are causes. In Aristotelian terms, a neurological account explains the efficient cause, while the purpose-based account explains the final cause.&lt;ref name=Falcon/&gt;

The physical causal closure thesis challenges this account. It attempts to reduce all teleological final (and formal) causes to efficient causes. Goetz and Taliaferro urge that this challenge is unjustified, partly because it would imply that the ''real'' cause of arguing for the physical causal closure is neurobiological activity in the brain, not (as we know it is) the purpose-based attempt to understand the world and explain it to others.

===Fallacious===
One way of clarifying the physical causal closure argument is to add a premise specifying that there are no irreducible teleological causes. This, of course, is the attempted conclusion of the argument. Putting the conclusion as one of the premises of the argument is formally valid, but fallacious (begging the question). It is no more sound than the argument that "I believe in the Bible because it is the written word of God through his prophets. Obviously, God would not lie to his prophets. After all, the Bible says so."{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===Trivial===
Another way of clarifying the physical causal closure argument is to specify that "Every physical effect [that has a physical cause] has a physical cause." But this is a tautology, and therefore true but trivial, like the statement "Every angel that has wings is an angel that has wings" or "Every white male who is bald is a bald white male."{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

'''Classical elements''' typically refer to the concepts in [[Classical Greece|ancient Greece]] of [[Earth (classical element)|earth]], [[Water (classical element)|water]], [[Air (classical element)|air]], [[Fire (classical element)|fire]], and [[Aether (classical element)|aether]], which were proposed to explain the nature and complexity of all matter in terms of simpler substances.&lt;ref name="Boyd2003"&gt;{{cite book |first=T.J.M. |last=Boyd |first2=J.J. |last2=Sanderson |year=2003 |title=The Physics of Plasmas |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521459129 |lccn=2002024654 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bAmqvuGTUJ4C&amp;pg=PA1 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ball2004"&gt;{{cite book |first=P. |last=Ball |year=2004 |title=The Elements: A Very Short Introduction |series=Very Short Introductions |publisher=OUP Oxford |isbn=9780191578250 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uaBczzC4wvIC&amp;pg=PT33 |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ancient cultures in [[Babylonia]], [[Ancient Japan|Japan]], [[Tibet#Early history|Tibet]], and [[Ancient India|India]] had similar lists, sometimes referring in local languages to "air" as "wind" and the fifth element as "void".  The Chinese [[Wu Xing]] system lists [[Wood (Wu Xing)|Wood]] ([[wiktionary:木|木]] ''mù''), [[Fire (Wu Xing)|Fire]] ([[wiktionary:火|火]] ''huǒ''), [[Earth (Wu Xing)|Earth]] ([[wiktionary:土|土]] ''tǔ''), [[Metal (Wu Xing)|Metal]] ([[wiktionary:金|金]] ''jīn''), and [[Water (Wu Xing)|Water]] ([[wiktionary:水|水]] ''shuǐ''), though these are described more as energies or transitions rather than as types of material.

These different cultures and even individual philosophers had widely varying explanations concerning their attributes and how they related to observable phenomena as well as [[cosmology]].  Sometimes these theories overlapped with [[mythology]] and were personified in deities.  Some of these interpretations included [[atomism]] (the idea of very small, indivisible portions of matter) but other interpretations considered the elements to be divisible into infinitely small pieces without changing their nature.

While the classification of the material world in ancient [[Mahābhūta|Indian]], [[Ancient Egypt|Hellenistic Egypt]], and [[Ancient Greece#Science and technology|ancient Greece]] into Air, Earth, Fire and Water was more philosophical, during the [[Islamic Golden Age]] medieval middle eastern scientists used practical, experimental observation to classify materials.&lt;ref name=Jim&gt;''[[Science and Islam (documentary)|Science and Islam]]'', [[Jim Al-Khalili]]. [[BBC]], 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, the Ancient Greek system of [[Aristotle]] evolved slightly into the [[#Medieval classic element systems|medieval system]], which for the first time in Europe became subject to experimental verification in the 1600s, during the [[Scientific Revolution]].

Modern science does not support the classical elements as the material basis of the physical world.  [[Atomic theory]] classifies atoms into more than a hundred [[chemical element]]s such as [[oxygen]], [[iron]], and [[Mercury (element)|mercury]].  These elements form [[chemical compound]]s and [[mixtures]], and under different temperatures and pressures, these substances can adopt different [[states of matter]].  The most commonly observed states of [[solid]], [[liquid]], [[gas]], and [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] share many attributes with the classical elements of earth, water, air, and fire, respectively, but these states are due to similar behavior of different types of atoms at similar energy levels, and not due to containing a certain type of atom or a certain type of substance.

==Ancient times==
{{anchor|Ancient classic element systems}}
In classical thought, the four elements [[Earth (classical element)|earth]], [[Water (classical element)|water]], [[Air (classical element)|air]], and [[Fire (classical element)|fire]] as proposed by [[Empedocles]] frequently occur; [[Aristotle]] added a fifth element, [[Aether (classical element)|aether]]; it has been called [[akasha]] in India and quintessence in Europe.

The concept of the five elements formed a basis of analysis in both [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]. In Hinduism, particularly in an [[Esotericism|esoteric]] context, the four states-of-matter describe matter, and a fifth element describes that which was beyond the material world. Similar lists existed in ancient [[China]], [[Korea]] and [[Japan]]. In Buddhism the four great elements, to which two others are sometimes added, are not viewed as substances, but as categories of [[sensory experience]].

===Cosmic elements in Babylonia===
In [[Babylonian mythology]], the cosmogony called ''[[Enûma Eliš]]'', a text written between the 18th and 16th centuries BC, involves four gods that we might see as personified cosmic elements: sea, earth, sky, wind. In other Babylonian texts these phenomena are considered independent of their association with deities,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A consideration of Babylonian astronomy within the historiography of science|author=Francesca Rochberg|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science|volume=33|issue=4|date=December 2002|pages=661–684|doi=10.1016/S0039-3681(02)00022-5|url=http://www.valentino-salvato.com/Astrology/pdf/Babylonian_Astronomy.pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.574.7121}}&lt;/ref&gt; though they are not treated as the component elements of the universe, as later in [[Empedocles]].

{{Main article|Mahābhūta|Guṇa}}

The system of five elements are found in [[Vedas]], especially [[Ayurveda]], the ''[[Pancha Bhoota|pancha mahabhuta]]'', or "five great elements", of [[Hinduism]] are ''[[bhūmi]]'' ([[earth (classical element)|earth]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= 78|editor=K.S. Gautam|publisher=Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Ap (water)|ap]]'' or ''jala'' ([[water (classical element)|water]]), ''[[agni|tejas]]'' or ''[[agni]]'' ([[fire (classical element)|fire]]), ''[[maruts|marut]]'', ''vayu'' or ''pavan'' ([[air (classical element)|air]] or [[wind]]) and ''vyom'' or ''shunya'' (space or zero) or ''[[akash]]'' ([[Aether (classical element)|aether]] or [[Aether (classical element)|void]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Natural Healing Through Ayurveda|author=Subhash Ranade|page=32|publisher = Motilal Banarsidass Publisher| isbn = 9788120812437|date=December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; They further suggest that all of creation, including the human body, is made up of these five essential elements and that upon death, the human body dissolves into these five elements of nature, thereby balancing the cycle of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=South Indian Hindu Festivals and Traditions|pages=60–62|author=Maithily Jagannathan|publisher=Abhinav Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The five elements are associated with the five senses, and act as the gross medium for the experience of sensations. The basest element, earth, created using all the other elements, can be perceived by all five senses&amp;nbsp;– (i) hearing, (ii) touch, (iii) sight, (iv) taste, and (v) smell. The next higher element, water, has no odor but can be heard, felt, seen and tasted. Next comes fire, which can be heard, felt and seen. Air can be heard and felt. "Akasha" (aether) is beyond the senses of smell, taste, sight, and touch; it being accessible to the sense of hearing alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Theatre and Consciousness: Explanatory Scope and Future Potential|author=Daniel Meyer-Dinkgräfe|publisher=Intellect Books|year=2005|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zGy0UglRz6IC|isbn=9781841501307}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Buddhism|author=Samir Nath|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|page=653|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cojAfyr04UAC|isbn=9788176250191|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Structural Depths of Indian Thought: Toward a Constructive Postmodern Ethics|page=81|publisher=SUNY Press|author=Poola Tirupati Raju}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Buddhism====
{{anchor|Buddhist elements}}
{{Main article|Mahābhūta}}

In the [[Pali literature]], the ''[[mahabhuta]]'' ("great elements") or ''catudhatu'' ("four elements") are earth, water, fire and air.  In early Buddhism, the four elements are a basis for understanding suffering and for liberating oneself from suffering. The earliest Buddhist texts explain that the four primary material elements are the sensory qualities solidity, fluidity, temperature, and mobility; their characterization as earth, water, fire, and air, respectively, is declared an abstraction – instead of concentrating on the fact of material existence, one observes how a physical thing is sensed, felt, perceived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lusthaus|first1=Dan|title=What is and isn't Yogācāra|url=http://www.acmuller.net/yogacara/articles/intro.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]'s teaching regarding the four elements is to be understood as the base of all observation of real sensations rather than as a philosophy. The four properties are cohesion (water), solidity or inertia (earth), expansion or vibration (air) and heat or energy content (fire). He promulgated a categorization of mind and matter as composed of eight types of "[[kalapas]]" of which the four elements are primary and a secondary group of four are color, smell, taste, and nutriment which are derivative from the four primaries.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

[[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]] (1997) renders an extract of [[Shakyamuni Buddha]]'s from Pali into English thus:
{{quote|Just as a skilled butcher or his apprentice, having killed a cow, would sit at a crossroads cutting it up into pieces, the monk contemplates this very body&amp;nbsp;– however it stands, however it is disposed&amp;nbsp;– in terms of properties: 'In this body there is the earth property, the liquid property, the fire property, &amp; the wind property.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Kayagata-sati Sutta'' |author=[[Majjhima Nikaya]] |page=119 |url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.119.than.html |accessdate=2009-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tibetan Buddhist medical literature speaks of the Panch [[Mahābhūta]] (five elements).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Gurmet | first=Padma | title='Sowa - Rigpa' : Himalayan art of healing | journal=Indian Journal of Traditional Knowledge | volume=3 | issue=2 | pages=212–218 | date=2004 | url=http://nopr.niscair.res.in/handle/123456789/9345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
{{anchor|Chinese elements}}
{{Main article|Wu Xing}}
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2009}}
The Chinese had a somewhat different series of elements, namely Fire, Earth, Metal (literally gold), Water and Wood, which were understood as different types of energy in a state of constant interaction and flux with one another, rather than the Western notion of different kinds of material.

Although it is usually translated as "element", the Chinese word ''xing'' literally means something like "changing states of being", "permutations" or "metamorphoses of being".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wolfram Eberhard |title=A Dictionary of Chinese Symbols |pages=93, 105, 309 |publisher=Routledge and Keegan Paul |location=London |year=1986|isbn=978-0-7102-0191-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact [[Sinologists]] cannot agree on any single translation. The Chinese elements were seen as ever changing and moving{{spaced ndash}}one translation of ''wu xing'' is simply "the five changes".

The Wu Xing are chiefly an ancient mnemonic device for systems with five stages; hence the preferred translation of "movements", "phases" or "steps" over "elements."

In the [[bagua]], [[Metal (Wu Xing)|metal]] is associated with the divination figure 兌 ''Duì'' (☱, the lake or marsh: 澤/泽 ''zé'') and with 乾 ''Qián'' (☰, the sky or heavens: 天 ''tiān''). [[Wood (Wu Xing)|Wood]] is associated with 巽 ''Xùn'' (☴, the wind: 風/风 ''fēng'') and with 震 ''Zhèn'' (☳, the arousing/thunder: 雷 ''léi''). In view of the durability of meteoric iron, metal came to be associated with the [[aether (classical element)|aether]], which is sometimes conflated with [[Stoicism|Stoic]] [[pneuma]], as both terms originally referred to air (the former being higher, brighter, more fiery or celestial and the latter being merely warmer, and thus [[vitalism|vital]] or [[abiogenesis|biogenetic]]). In [[Taoism]], ''[[qi]]'' functions similarly to pneuma in a prime matter (a basic principle of energetic transformation) that accounts for both biological and inanimate phenomena.

In Chinese philosophy the universe consists of heaven and earth. The five major [[planet]]s are associated with and even named after the elements: [[Jupiter]] 木星 is Wood ([[wikt:木#Han character|木]]), [[Mars]] 火星 is Fire ([[wikt:火#Han character|火]]), [[Saturn]] 土星 is Earth ([[wikt:土#Han character|土]]), [[Venus]] 金星 is Metal ([[wikt:金#Han character|金]]), and [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] 水星 is Water ([[wikt:水#Han character|水]]). Also, the [[Moon]] represents [[Yin and yang|Yin]] ([[wikt:陰#Han character|陰]]), and the [[Sun]] 太陽 represents [[Yin and yang|Yang]] ([[wikt:陽#Han character|陽]]). Yin, Yang, and the five elements are associated with themes in the [[I Ching]], the oldest of Chinese classical texts which describes an ancient system of [[cosmology]] and [[philosophy]]. The five elements also play an important part in [[Chinese astrology]] and the Chinese form of [[geomancy]] known as [[Feng shui]].

The doctrine of five phases describes two cycles of balance, a generating or creation (生, shēng) cycle and an overcoming or destruction (克/剋, kè) cycle of interactions between the phases.

''Generating''
* Wood feeds fire;
* Fire creates earth (ash);
* Earth bears metal;
* Metal collects water;
* Water nourishes wood.

''Overcoming''
* Wood parts earth;
* Earth absorbs water;
* Water quenches fire;
* Fire melts metal;
* Metal chops wood.

There are also two cycles of imbalance, an overacting cycle (cheng) and an insulting cycle (wu).

The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] belief in five basic elements, these being earth (γῆ  ''ge''), water (ὕδωρ ''hudor''), air (ἀήρ ''aer''), fire (πῦρ ''pur'') and aether (αἰθήρ ''aither''), dates from pre-Socratic times and persisted throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and into the [[Renaissance]], deeply influencing [[Europe]]an thought and culture. These five elements are sometimes associated with the five [[platonic solid]]s.

[[File:Four Classical Elements in Burning Log.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|The four classical elements of [[Empedocles]] and [[Aristotle]] illustrated with a burning log. The log releases all four elements as it is destroyed.]]

[[Magna Graecia|Sicilian]] philosopher [[Empedocles]] (ca. 450 BC) proved (at least to his satisfaction) that air was a separate substance by observing that a bucket inverted in water did not become filled with water, a pocket of air remaining trapped inside.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to Empedocles, Greek philosophers had debated which substance was the primordial element from which everything else was made; [[Heraclitus]] championed fire, [[Thales]] supported water, and [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]] plumped for air.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anaximander]] argued that the primordial substance was not any of the known substances, but could be transformed into them, and they into each other.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;  Empedocles was the first to propose four elements, fire, earth, air, and water.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, pp. 62, 75&lt;/ref&gt;  He called them the four "roots" (ῥιζώματα, rhizōmata).

Plato seems to have been the first to use the term "element (στοιχεῖον, ''stoicheion'')" in reference to air, fire, earth, and water.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plat.+Tim.+48b |author=Plato |title=Timaeus |at=48b }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ancient Greek word for element, ''stoicheion'' (from ''stoicheo'', "to line up") meant "smallest division (of a sun-dial), a syllable", as the composing unit of an alphabet it could denote a letter and the smallest unit from which a word is formed. A similar alphabetic metaphor may be the origin of the equivalent Latin word ''elementum'' (from which the English word comes), possibly based on the names of the letters 'l', 'm', and 'n', though the validity of this idea is debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lehmann|first1=R.G.|editor1-last=de Voogt|editor1-first=A.|editor2-last=Quack|editor2-first=J.F.|title=The Idea of Writing: Writing Across Borders|date=2011|publisher=Brill|pages=15–16, note 8|chapter=27-30-22-26 - How many letters needs an alphabet?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A classic diagram has one square [[inscribed]] in the other, with the corners of one being the classical elements, and the corners of the other being the properties. The opposite corner is the opposite of these properties, "hot&amp;nbsp;– cold" and "dry&amp;nbsp;– wet".

[[Aristotle]] added a fifth element, [[Aether (classical element)#Fifth element|aether]], as the quintessence, reasoning that whereas fire, earth, air, and water were earthly and corruptible, since no changes had been perceived in the heavenly regions, the [[star]]s cannot be made out of any of the four elements but must be made of a different, unchangeable, heavenly substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Lloyd | first = G.

{{anchor|Classical elements in Egypt}}
A text written in Egypt in [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Hellenistic]] or [[Roman Egypt|Roman]] times called the ''Kore Kosmou'' ("Virgin of the World") ascribed to [[Hermes Trismegistus]] (associated with the Egyptian god [[Thoth]]), names the four elements fire, water, air, and earth. As described in this book:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And Isis answer made: Of living things, my son, some are made friends with ''fire'', and some with ''water'', some with ''air'', and some with ''earth'', and some with two or three of these, and some with all. And, on the contrary, again some are made enemies of fire, and some of water, some of earth, and some of air, and some of two of them, and some of three, and some of all. For instance, son, the locust and all flies flee fire; the eagle and the hawk and all high-flying birds flee water; fish, air and earth; the snake avoids the open air. Whereas snakes and all creeping things love earth; all swimming things love water; winged things, air, of which they are the citizens; while those that fly still higher love the fire and have the habitat near it. Not that some of the animals as well do not love fire; for instance salamanders, for they even have their homes in it. It is because one or another of the elements doth form their bodies' outer envelope. Each [[soul]], accordingly, while it is in its body is weighted and constricted by these four.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Galen]], these elements were used by [[Hippocrates]] in describing the [[human body]] with an association with the [[Humorism|four humours]]: yellow [[bile]] (fire), [[Melancholia|black bile]] (earth), [[blood]] (air), and [[phlegm]] (water). Medical care was primarily about helping the patient stay in or return to his/her own personal natural balanced state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Medicine and Society in early Modern Europe |last=Lindemann |first=Mary |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-521-73256-7 |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Neoplatonic]] philosopher [[Proclus]] rejected Aristotle's theory relating the elements to the sensible qualities hot, cold, wet, and dry.  He maintained that each of the elements has three properties. Fire is sharp, subtle, and mobile while its opposite, earth, is blunt, dense, and immobile; they are joined by the intermediate elements, air and water, in the following fashion:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Proclus|title=Commentary on Plato's ''Timaeus'' | at= 3.38.1–3.39.28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tibet===
{{anchor|Bön elements}}
In [[Bön]] or ancient Tibetan philosophy, the five elemental processes of [[Earth (classical element)|earth]], [[Water (classical element)|water]], [[Fire (classical element)|fire]], [[Air (classical element)|air]] and [[Void (classical element)|space]] are the essential materials of all existent [[phenomena]] or [[skandha|aggregate]]s.  The elemental processes form the basis of the [[calendar]], [[astrology]], [[medicine]], [[psychology]] and are the foundation of the [[Spirituality|spiritual]] [[traditions]] of [[shamanism]], [[tantra]] and [[Dzogchen]].

[[Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche]] states that
{{quote|physical properties are assigned to the elements:  earth is solidity; water is cohesion; fire is temperature; air is motion; and space is the spatial dimension that accommodates the other four active elements.  In addition, the elements are correlated to different emotions, temperaments, directions, colors, tastes, body types, illnesses, thinking styles, and character.  From the five elements arise the five senses and the five fields of sensory experience; the five negative emotions and the five wisdoms; and the five extensions of the body.  They are the five primary ''pranas'' or vital energies.  They are the constituents of every physical, sensual, mental, and spiritual phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche |title=Healing with Form, Energy, and Light |page=1 |location=Ithaca, New York |publisher=Snow Lion Publications |isbn=978-1-55939-176-4 |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The names of the elements are analogous to categorised experiential sensations of the natural world.  The [[name]]s are [[symbol]]ic and key to their inherent qualities and/or modes of action by [[analogy]].  In [[Bön]] the elemental processes are fundamental [[metaphor]]s for working with external, internal and secret energetic forces.  All five elemental processes in their essential purity are inherent in the [[mindstream]] and link the [[trikaya]] and are aspects of primordial energy. As [[Herbert V. Günther]] states:
{{quote|Thus, bearing in mind that thought struggles incessantly against the treachery of language and that what we observe and describe is the observer himself, we may nonetheless proceed to investigate the successive phases in our becoming human beings. Throughout these phases, the experience (''das Erlebnis'') of ourselves as an intensity (imaged and felt as a "god", lha) setting up its own spatiality (imaged and felt as a "house" ''khang'') is present in various intensities of illumination that occur within ourselves as a "temple." A corollary of this Erlebnis is its light character manifesting itself in various "frequencies" or colors. This is to say, since we are beings of light we display this light in a multiplicity of nuances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Herber V. Günther |year=1996 |title=The Teachings of Padmasambhava |pages=115–116 |location=Leiden, Netherlands |publisher=E. J. Brill |edition=Hardcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the above block quote the [[trikaya]] is encoded as: [[dharmakaya]] "god"; [[sambhogakaya]] "temple" and [[nirmanakaya]] "house".

[[File:Fotothek df tg 0007129 Theosophie ^ Alchemie.jpg|thumb|Seventeenth century alchemical emblem showing the four Classical elements in the corners of the image, alongside the tria prima on the central triangle]]
The elemental system used in Medieval [[alchemy]] was developed primarily by the [[Alchemy and chemistry in Islam|Arab alchemist]] [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]] (Geber).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Norris |first1=John A. |title=The Mineral Exhalation Theory of Metallogenesis in Pre-Modern Mineral Science
|journal=Ambix |volume=53 |pages=43–65 |year=2006 |doi=10.1179/174582306X93183}}&lt;/ref&gt; His system consisted of the four classical elements of air, earth, fire, and water, in addition to two philosophical elements: [[Sulfur|sulphur]], characterizing the principle of combustibility, "the stone which burns"; and [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], characterizing the principle of metallic properties. They were seen by early alchemists as idealized expressions of irreducibile components of the [[universe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clulee |first=Nicholas H. |title=John Dee's Natural Philosophy |publisher=Routledge |year=1988 |pages=97 |isbn=978-0-415-00625-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are of larger consideration within philosophical alchemy.

The three metallic principles—sulphur to flammability or combustion, mercury to volatility and stability, and [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]] to solidity—became the ''tria prima'' of the Swiss alchemist [[Paracelsus]]. He reasoned that Aristotle’s four element theory appeared in bodies as three principles. Paracelsus saw these principles as fundamental and justified them by recourse to the description of how wood burns in fire. Mercury included the cohesive principle, so that when it left in smoke the wood fell apart. Smoke described the volatility (the mercurial principle), the heat-giving flames described flammability (sulphur), and the remnant ash described solidity (salt).&lt;ref&gt;Strathern, 2000. Page 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic===
{{expand section|date=December 2016}}
The [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosophers]] [[al-Kindi]], [[Avicenna]] and [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]] connected the four elements with the four natures heat and cold (the active force), and dryness and moisture (the recipients).&lt;ref name = "rafati"&gt;Rafati, Vahid. ''[http://bahai-library.com/rafati_hikmat_agents_patients Lawh-i-Hikmat: The Two Agents and the Two Patients]''. `Andalib, vol. 5, no. 19, pp. 29-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
{{anchor|Japanese elements}}
{{Main article|Five elements (Japanese philosophy)}}
[[Japan]]ese traditions use a set of elements called the {{lang|ja|五大}} (''godai'', literally "five great"). These five are [[earth (classical element)|earth]], [[water (classical element)|water]], [[fire (classical element)|fire]], [[wind (classical element)|wind]]/air, and [[Aether (classical element)|void]]. These came from Indian [[Vastu shastra]] philosophy and Buddhist beliefs; in addition, the classical Chinese elements ({{lang|ja|五行}}, ''wu xing'') are also prominent in Japanese culture, especially to the influential Neo-Confucianists during the medieval [[Edo period]].

* '''Earth''' represented things that were solid.
* '''Water''' represented things that were liquid.
* '''Fire''' represented things that destroy.
* '''Air''' represented things that moved.
* '''Void''' or '''Sky/Heaven''' represented things not of our everyday life.

==Western astrology==
{{anchor|Elements in western astrology and tarot}}
{{Main article|Astrology and the classical elements}}

Western [[astrology]] uses the four [[astrology and the classical elements|classical elements]] in connection with [[natal chart|astrological chart]]s and [[horoscopes]]. The twelve [[Astrological signs|signs]] of the [[zodiac]] are divided into the four elements: [[Fire signs]] are Aries, Leo and Sagittarius, [[Earth signs]] are Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn, [[Air signs]] are Gemini, Libra and Aquarius, and [[Water signs]] are Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Tester, S. J. | title=A History of Western Astrology | year=1999 | publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer |pages=59–61, 94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern {{anchor|Modern elements}}==
{{See also|Chemical element#History}}

The [[Physics (Aristotle)|Aristotelian tradition]] and medieval [[alchemy]] eventually gave rise to modern scientific theories and new taxonomies. By the time of [[Antoine Lavoisier]], for example, a [[History of the periodic table#Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier|list of elements]] would no longer refer to classical elements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/lavtable.html Antoine Lavoisier (1743-1794)], in [http://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/index.html Classic Chemistry], compiled by Carmen Giunta&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern scientists see a parallel between the classical elements and the four [[state of matter|states of matter]]: [[solid]], [[liquid]], [[gas]] and weakly ionized [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | last = Kikuchi | first = Mitsuru | date = 2011 | title = Frontiers in Fusion Research: Physics and Fusion | publisher = Springer Science and Business Media | place = London | page = 12 | isbn = 978-1-84996-411-1 | quote = Empedocles (495–435 BC) proposed that the world was made of earth, water, air, and fire, which may correspond to solid, liquid, gas, and weakly ionized plasma.  Surprisingly, this idea may catch the essence.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern science recognizes classes of [[elementary particle]]s which have no substructure (or rather, particles that are not made of other particles) and [[composite particle]]s having substructure (particles made of other particles).

The use of such a conduit may be entirely [[metaphor]]ic or [[Religious symbolism|symbolic]], or it may be earnestly believed to be functional.

In [[Shinto]], the public shrine is a building or place that functions as a conduit for {{Nihongo|kami|神|"spiritual essence"|commonly translated as god or spirit}}.

''' Duncan Liddel''' (also '''Duncan Liddell''';&lt;ref name="CanmoreLiddellsMonument"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dyce, Liddell's Monument|url=http://canmore.org.uk/site/19448/dyce-liddells-monument|website=Canmore|publisher=Royal Commission on Ancient and Historic Monuments of Scotland (RCAHMS)|accessdate=24 August 2015|ref=CanmoreLiddellsMonument}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1561 – 17 December 1613) was a Scottish mathematician, physician and astronomer.
[[File:Portrait of Duncan Liddel attributed to George Jamieson. Wellcome M0008733.jpg|thumb|Duncan Liddel]]

==Life==
Liddel was born in [[Aberdeen]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]]. Having received an education in languages and philosophy at the local school and university of [[King's College, Aberdeen|King's College]], he went abroad at age 18. Moving to [[Gdańsk]] in [[Royal Prussia|Polish Prussia]] first, he arrived after a few months at the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] university of [[Frankfurt (Oder)]] (''[[Viadrina European University|Viadrina]]''), where a Scot, [[John Craig (physician)|John Craig]] was teaching logic and mathematics; Craig superintended his studies.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Liddel, Duncan|volume=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three years later Craig returned to Scotland to become physician to King [[James VI and I|James VI]], and Liddel, on his advice, moved to [[Wrocław|Breslau]] in [[Silesia]], where he studied mathematics under [[Paul Wittich]], and encountered [[Andreas Dudith]]. In 1584 he returned to Frankfurt, took pupils in mathematics and philosophy, and took up the study of physic. In 1587 an epidemic drove him to the [[University of Rostock]] in [[Mecklenburg]], where he became the friend of [[Johannes Caselius]], [[Heinrich Brucaeus]] and [[Cornelius Martini]]; and received the degree of master in philosophy. With the help of his new contacts, he visited [[Tycho Brahe]] in [[Ven (Sweden)|Ven]] in 1587 and again the following year.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=16639|title=Liddel, Duncan|first=George|last=Molland}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pyle"&gt;{{ThoemmesBritish17C|Liddel, Duncan|517–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after his return to Frankfurt in 1590, Liddel joined the new [[University of Helmstedt]] established by Duke [[Julius, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Julius of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]]. Caselius had already been appointed to the chair of philosophy there. Next year Liddel obtained the lower mathematical chair vacated by [[Parcovius]], and in 1594 he succeeded [[Erhardus Hoffmann]] in the higher mathematical chair. In 1596 he became M.D. of the university, and began publicly to teach physic and to act as præses at the recitation of medical dissertations. In 1599 he was dean of the faculty of philosophy; in 1603 he resigned his mathematical professorship, and in 1604 became pro-rector of the university.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Liddel returned to Scotland in 1607, financially secure. In 1612 he endowed the university of Aberdeen with lands for the education and support of six poor scholars; and in 1613 he endowed a professorship of mathematics in [[Marischal College]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; He died on 17 December 1613, at age 51. His funeral sermon was given by [[Gilbert Gray (educator)|Gilbert Gray]] of Marischal College.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=11338|title=Gray, Gilbert|first=J. H.|last=Burns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Monument for Duncan Liddel, Pitmeddon. Wellcome M0008732.jpg|thumb|left|[[List of listed buildings in Dyce, Aberdeen|Memorial]] to Duncan Liddel in [[Pitmedden Estate]], [[Dyce]]&lt;ref name="CanmoreLiddellsMonument" /&gt;]]
Liddel bequeathed his books and instruments to Marischal College. A brass memorial figure of him was later set up in the [[Kirk of St Nicholas]], Aberdeen.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Reputation==
Liddel was reputed as a mathematician in Germany, where he was said to have been the first to teach the astronomy of [[Copernicus]] and of [[Tycho Brahe]] side by side with the [[Ptolemaic system]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; Caselius considered that Liddel was the first teacher of Brahe's system; and Brahe complained of plagiarism.&lt;ref name="Pyle"/&gt;

In theology, also, Liddel built a reputation. He found arguments against the [[Lutheran]] theologian [[Daniel Hofmann]], who had deployed the doctrine of [[double truth]] at Helmstedt in a divisive fashion.&lt;ref name="Pyle"/&gt;

==Works==
Liddel wrote medical books:&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;
[[File:Title page from Liddel, Ars medica..., 1608 Wellcome L0017173.jpg|thumb|Title page from ''Ars medica'' (1608) by Duncan Liddel]]
* ''Disputationum Medicinalium Liber'', Helmstadt, 1605; medical theses maintained by himself and his pupils, 1592–1605: the volume is dedicated to John Craig. A posthumous edition, under the title ''Universæ Medicinæ Compendium'', was published at Helmstadt in 1720. 
* ''Ars Medica'', Hamburg, 1608, in five books—I. ''De Medicinæ Definitione et Principiis''; II. ''De Physiologia''; III. ''De Pathologia''; IV. ''De Signorum Doctrina''; V. ''De Therapeutica'':’]—dedicated to James I of England. Another edition was published at Lyon in 1624 by Serranus; and in 1628 a third edition appeared at Hamburg. This and the next work were in the [[Galenic formulation|Galenic]] tradition of [[learned medicine]], but admitted some [[Paracelsian]] doctrines.&lt;ref name="Pyle"/&gt;
* ''De Febribus Libri tres'', Hamburg, 1610; republished by Serranus with the ''Ars Medica'' in 1624. 
* ''Tractatus de Dente Aureo'', Hamburg, 1628, an exposure of a supposed miracle—a boy having a golden tooth—which had imposed on the credulity of [[Gregor Horstius]]. 
* ''Artis Conservandi Sanitatem Libri duo'', Aberdeen, 1651; edited by [[Patrick Dun (college head)|Patrick Dun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=66918|title=Dun, Patrick|first=Shona MacLean|last=Vance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the time of [[William Shakespeare]], there were commonly reckoned to be '''five wits''' and '''five senses'''.&lt;ref name=Furness1&gt;{{cite book|chapter=King Lear|title=Shakespeare|pages=187|location=Philadelphia|publisher=J.B. Lippincott Co.|isbn=9780742652866|author=[[Horace Howard Furness]]|volume=5|edition=7th|year=1880}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The five wits were sometimes taken to be synonymous with the five senses,&lt;ref name=Furness1 /&gt;&amp;nbsp;but were otherwise also known and regarded as the '''five inward wits''', distinguishing them from the five senses, which were the five ''outward'' wits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopaedia|article=wit|encyclopedia=The Merriam-Webster new book of word histories|publisher=Merriam-Webster|date=1991|isbn=9780877796039|pages=508}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in Words|author=[[C. S. Lewis|Clive Staples Lewis]]|edition=2nd (republished)|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1990|isbn=9780521398312|pages=147|chapter=Sense}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of this conflation has resulted from changes in meaning.  In [[Early Modern English]], "[[wikt:wit#English|wit]]" and "[[wikt:sense#English|sense]]" overlapped in meaning.  Both could mean a faculty of perception (although this sense dropped from the word "wit" during the 17th century).  Thus "five wits" and "five senses" could describe both groups of wits/senses, the inward and the outward, although the common distinction, where it was made, was "five wits" for the inward and "five senses" for the outward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Early modern English|author=Charles Laurence Barber|pages=245|chapter=Changes of Meaning|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=1997|isbn=9780748608355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inward and outward wits are a product of many centuries of philosophical and psychological thought, over which the concepts gradually developed, that have their origins in the works of [[Aristotle]].  The concept of five outward wits came to medieval thinking from Classical philosophy, and found its most major expression in Christian [[devotional literature]] of the Middle Ages.  The concept of five inward wits similarly came from Classical views on psychology.

Modern thinking is that there are more than five (outward) senses, and the idea that there are five (corresponding to the gross anatomical features &amp;mdash; eyes, ears, nose, skin, and mouth &amp;mdash; of many higher animals) does not stand up to scientific scrutiny.  (For more on this, see [[Sense|Definition of sense]].)  But the idea of five senses/wits from Aristotelian, medieval, and 16th century thought still lingers so strongly in modern thinking that a sense beyond the natural ones is still called a "sixth sense".&lt;ref name=Postgate&gt;{{cite book|title=The outer reaches of life|author=John Raymond Postgate|chapter=Microsenses|pages=165|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1995|isbn=9780521558730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The "inward" wits ==
[[Stephen Hawes]]' poem ''Graunde Amoure'' shows that the five (inward) wits were "common wit", "imagination", "fantasy", "estimation", and "memory".&lt;ref name=Furness1 /&gt;  "Common wit" corresponds to Aristotle's concept of the ''[[sensus communis]]'', and "estimation" roughly corresponds to the modern notion of [[instinct]].&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Lewis, ''The Discarded Image: An Introduction to Medieval and Renaissance Literature'' (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1964), pp. 162, 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakespeare himself refers to these wits several times, in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' (Act I, scene 4 and Act II, scene iv), ''[[King Lear]]'' (Act III, scene iv), ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' (Act I, scene i, 55), and ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' (Act IV, scene ii, 92).&lt;ref name=Furness1 /&gt;  He distinguished between the five wits and the five senses, as can be seen from [[Sonnet 141]].&lt;ref name=Furness1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Backgrounds of Shakespeare's thought|author=John Erskine Hankins|publisher=Archon Books|year=1978|isbn=9780208017437|pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mares /&gt;

The five wits are derived from the faculties of the soul that [[Aristotle]] describes in ''[[De Anima]]''.&lt;ref name=Mares&gt;{{cite book|title=Much ado about nothing By William Shakespeare|author=Francis Hugh Mares|edition=2nd|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=9780521532501|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inward wits are part of medieval psychological thought.  [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] translated [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]]' ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'' into Middle English.  According to Chaucer's translation, "ymaginacioun" is the most basic internal faculty of perception.  One can, with the imagination, call to mind the image of an object, either one directly experienced or a purely imaginary fabrication.  Above that comes "resoun", by which such images of individual objects are related to the universal classes to which they belong.  Above that comes "intelligence", which relates the universal classes to eternal "symple forme" (akin to a [[Platonic ideal]]).  Humans are thus "sensible", "ymaginable", and "reasonable" (i.e. capable of sensing, imagination, and reason, as defined), all three of which feed into memory.  (Intelligence is the sole remit of Divine Providence.)&lt;ref name=Kolve&gt;{{cite book|title=Chaucer and the Imagery of Narrative|author=V. A. Kolve|pages=20&amp;ndash;22|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1984|isbn=0-8047-1349-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To that quartet is also added "phantasia", a creative facet of imagination.  A famous example of this is given by [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], who distinguishes between imagining [[Carthage]], from memory (since he had been there), and imagining [[Alexandria]], a pure fantasy image of a place that he had never been to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Cook|volume=VII|location=London|publisher=Whitaker &amp;amp; Co.|year=1843|chapter=King Lear}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The five (outward) senses, as described in [[Cursor Mundi]], are "hering" (hearing), "sight", "smelling" (smell), "fele" (touch) and "cheuing" (taste).&lt;ref name=Postgate /&gt;  It relates them to the five Aristotelian elements (which Aristotle describes in ''[[On the Heavens|De Caelo]]''), with sight coming from fire, hearing from the upper air (the aether), smell from the lower air, taste from water, and touch from earth.  This definition of the origins of human senses was an exceedingly popular one throughout the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe, not least because of its rough agreement with chapter 30 of the [[Second Book of Enoch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Southern Version of Cursor Mundi: Lines 1-9228|editor=Sarah M. Horrall|pages=350|publisher=University of Ottawa Press|year=1978|isbn=9780776648057}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of "wit" to describe these five senses is illustrated by ''The World and the Chylde'' (at right) and the following two quotations:&lt;ref name=Furness2&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Romeo and Juliet|title=Shakespeare|pages=60|location=Philadelphia|publisher=J.B.

{{quote|text=And this knowledge descendeth and cometh of the five corporal senses and wits of the persons, as the eyes, understanding, and hearing of the ears, smell of the nose, taste of the mouth, [&amp;hellip;]|sign=Larke|source=''Book of Wisdom''&lt;ref name=Furness2 /&gt;}}
{{quote|text=My five wits have I fondly misused and spent, in hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, and also feeling, which thou has given me [&amp;hellip;]|sign=''King Henry The Eighth's Primer'', 1546&lt;ref name=Furness2 /&gt;}}

This definition of five senses has its origins in thinkers that came after Aristotle.  Aristotle himself, in ''[[Sense and Sensibilia (Aristotle)|De Sensu et Sensibilibus]]'' defined ''four'' senses: sight (associated with water because the eye contains water), sound (corresponding to air), smell (corresponding to fire), and touch (corresponding to earth).  Aristotle viewed taste as merely a specialized form of touch, which he in turn viewed as the primary sense (because all life-forms possess it).  He rejected the earlier view by [[Democritus]] that there was in fact only one sense, touch.&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;{{cite book|title=Folk-taxonomies in early English|author=Earl R. Anderson|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press|year=2003|isbn=9780838639160|chapter=The Five Senses}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Plato]], in ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'', has Socrates stating that there are innumerable senses without names, and that the senses with names include hearing, sight, smell, senses of heat and cold, pleasure, pain, desire, and fear.&lt;ref name=Anderson /&gt;

[[Aulus Gellius]] defined five senses, saying "Ex quinque his sensibus quose animantibus natura tribit, visu, auditu, gustu, tactu, odoratu, quas Graeci αισθητεισ appellant" ("Nature has given five senses to living beings, sight, hearing, taste, touch, and smell, called αισθητεισ by the Greeks").  But there is no evidence that this [[literary topos|topos]] existed in the thinking of the Anglo-Saxons, since [[Old English]] does not possess the requisite taxonomy, and has difficulty with translations of Latin texts that do.&lt;ref name=Anderson /&gt;

The concept of there being five senses occurs in Christian sermons, devotional literature, and religious allegories of [[Middle English]], although not all authors agreed exactly which senses the five were.  [[Peter Damian]] in the 11th century correlated the five wounds that Jesus suffered during his crucifixion with the five senses, which was echoed by [[John Bromyard]] in ''Summa cantium'', although the latter only explicitly mentions hearing, touch, taste, and sight.  By the 14th century, [[Richard Rolle]] was giving the formulation of five senses that is now familiar:&lt;ref name=Anderson /&gt;

{{quote|text=And þus were all þy five wittes occupied with peyne to bote þe trespas of our v witties.  In þy syght þou were blyndfeled, [&amp;hellip;]. In þi smellynge [&amp;hellip;].  In þy tast, [&amp;hellip;].  In hyrynge, [&amp;hellip;].  In felynge, [&amp;hellip;].|sign=[[Richard Rolle]]&lt;ref name=Anderson /&gt;}}

Chaucer had the same formulation:

{{quote|text=the fyve wittes, that been sighte, herynge, smellynge, tastynge or savourynge, and feelynge|sign=[[Geoffrey Chaucer]]|source=''The Parson's Tale''&lt;ref name=Anderson /&gt;}}

'''Gangesha Upadhyaya''' ({{lang-sa|गंगेश उपाध्याय}}, ''Gaṅgeśa Upādhyāya'') (late 12th century) was an [[India]]n [[mathematician]] and [[philosopher]] from the [[monarchy|kingdom]] of  [[History of Mithila|Mithila]]. He established the [[Navya-Nyāya]] ("New Logic") school. His ''Tattvacintāmaṇi'' (The Jewel of Thought on the Nature of  Things), also known as ''Pramāṇacintāmaṇi'' (The Jewel of Thought on the Means of Valid Knowledge), is the basic text for all later developments. The [[logician]]s of this school were primarily interested in defining their terms and concepts related to non-binary logical categories.

==Life==
Gangesa was born at Karion village on the banks of the river Kamala, 19&amp;nbsp;km south-east of [[Darbhanga]] in a [[Brahmin]] family. According to tradition, he was illiterate in his early years but later he acquired the knowledge of logic as a boon from the goddess [[Kali]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0lG85RD9YZoC|title=A History of Indian Logic: Ancient, Mediaeval and Modern Schools|last=Vidyabhusana|first=Satis Chandra|date=|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|year=1920|isbn=9788120805651|location=Delhi|pages=405–6|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His son Vardhamana Upadhyaya was also a noted philosopher of the Nyaya school. Beyond this, nothing else is known of his life.

==The ''Tattvacintāmaṇi''==
{{main|Tattvacintāmaṇi}}

The founding text of Navya-Nyaya - it is divided into four khaṇḍas (books): Pratyakṣakhaṇḍa (book on perception), Anumānakhaṇḍa (book on inference), Upamānakhaṇḍa (book on comparison) and Śabdakhaṇḍa (book on verbal testimony). The first book opens with a salutation to Shiva.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0lG85RD9YZoC|title=A History of Indian Logic: Ancient, Mediaeval and Modern Schools|last=Vidyabhusana|first=Satis Chandra|date=|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|year=1920|isbn=9788120805651|location=Delhi|pages=407|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tattvacintāmaṇi (T.C.) is a systematic account of epistemology, logic, and the philosophy of grammar. Other subjects, such as the proofs of God, are treated incidentally.

Gangesa refers to his own teachings as the New Nyaya. This term New Nyaya is not to be understood as implying any great originality in theory on Gangesa's part, but rather originality in method. His work differs from the oldest Nyaya in that he accepts many tenets of the Vaisesika school, and in his arrangement of Nyaya teachings under four headings rather than under the 16 subjects ([[Padārtha|padartha]]) of the Old Nyaya.

The newness of Gangesa's method is newness of style and of organization. He is far more precise, more careful to define his terms, than were his predecessors. These virtues of his work are responsible for the fact that perhaps half of Navya-Nyaya literature is based either directly on the T.C. or on a commentary on the T.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ENvsAAAAIAAJ|title=Materials for the Study of Navya-nyāya Logic|last=Ingalls|first=Daniel Henry Holmes|date=|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|year=1951|isbn=9788120803848|location=Delhi|pages=5–6|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

H. Th. Vollenhoven]]. Other second generationers were: [[K. J. Popma]], [[S. U. Zuidema]] and [[J. P. A. Mekkes]].

From 1951 he was professor at the Institute of Technology of [[Delft]] in the Netherlands.  He held graduate degrees in engineering and in philosophy.  He studied philosophy at the Free University in Amsterdam under [[D. H. Th. Vollenhoven]].  He was an active participant in the [[Underground Movement]] during the Nazi occupation.

[[Carl Mitcham]] is to give the first Van Riessen memorial lecture.&lt;sup&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060418082301/http://www.aspecten.org/start/PosterCARLMITCHAM.pdf]&lt;/sup&gt;

'''Hip hip hooray''' (also '''hippity hip hooray'''; ''Hooray'' may also be spelled and pronounced '''hoorah''', '''hurrah''', '''hurray''' etc.) is a [[cheering|cheer]] called out to express congratulation toward someone or something, in the [[English language|English speaking]] world and elsewhere.

By a sole speaker, it is a form of [[interjection]]. In a group, it takes the form of [[call and response]]: the cheer is initiated by one person exclaiming "Three cheers for...[someone or something]" (or, more archaically, "Three times three"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dlfPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA410 ''Fraser's Magazine for Town and Country, Volume 9'']. 1834, James Fraser.

==History==
The call was recorded in England in the beginning of the 19th century in connection with making a [[Toast (honor)|toast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.2307/453841| issn = 0003-1283| volume = 36| issue = 2| pages = 83–92| last = Read| first = Allen Walker| title = The Rebel Yell as a Linguistic Problem| journal = American Speech| date = 1961-05-01| jstor = 453841}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eighteenth century dictionaries list "Hip" as an attention-getting interjection, and in an example from 1790 it is repeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Times (London)| date= 1790-11-27| page = 2}} 'Sir Charles engag'd one day at dice / Hip! hip! come hither John, he cries;'&lt;/ref&gt;"Hip-hip" was added as a preparatory call before making a toast or cheer in the early 19th century, probably after 1806.  By 1813, it had reached its modern form, hip-hip-hurrah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Peter Jensen|title=Three Cheers, Hip-Hip-Hurrah and Tom and Jerry|url=http://esnpc.blogspot.com/2014/05/three-cheers-hip-hip-hurrah-and-tom-and.html|work=Early Sports 'n Pop-Culture Blog|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the word "hip" stems from a [[medieval]] [[Latin]] [[acronym]], "''H''ierosolyma ''E''st ''P''erdita", meaning "Jerusalem is lost",&lt;ref&gt;Gabay's Copywriter's Compendium, Jonathan Gaby, pub. (Elsevier) 2006, {{ISBN|0-7506-8320-1}}, p.669&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brewer|first=Ebenezer Cobham|title=Dictionary of phrase and fable|year=1898|publisher=[[Henry Altemus Company]]|location=Philadelphia|isbn=1-58734-094-1|url=http://www.bartleby.com/81/8296.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; a term that gained notoriety in the German [[Hep hep riots]] of August to October 1819.   Cornell's Michael Fontaine disputes this etymology, tracing it to a single letter in an English newspaper published August 28, 1819, some weeks after the riots.  He concludes that the "acrostic interpretation ... has no basis in fact.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fontaine|first=Michael|title=On the Acronym Origin of the English Phrase Hep! Hep!|url=https://www.academia.edu/9305194/On_the_Acronym_Origin_of_the_English_Phrase_Hep_Hep_}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ritchie Robertson also disputes the "false etymology" of the acronym interpretation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Ritchie|last=Robertson|title=The 'Jewish Question' in German Literature, 1749-1939 : Emancipation and its Discontents|year=1999|isbn= 9780191584312}}&lt;/ref&gt; citing Katz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jacob|last=Katz|title=Die Hep-Hep-Verfolgungen des Jahres 1819|year=1994|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One theory about the origin of "hurrah" is that the Europeans picked up the Mongol exclamation "hooray" as an enthusiastic cry of bravado and mutual encouragement. See [[Jack Weatherford|Jack Weatherford's]] book ''[[Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Joseph W. (November 21, 2005 ).

'''Ignacio Ellacuría, S.J.''' ([[Portugalete]], [[Biscay]], [[Spain]], November 9, 1930 &amp;ndash; [[San Salvador]], November 16, 1989) was a [[Jesuit]] [[priest]], [[philosopher]], and [[theology|theologian]] who did important work as a [[professor]] and [[Rector (academia)|rector]] at the [[Universidad Centroamericana "José Simeón Cañas"]] (UCA), a [[Jesuit]] university in [[El Salvador]] founded in 1965. He and several other Jesuits and two others were [[1989 murders of Jesuits in El Salvador|assassinated by Salvadoran soldiers]] in the closing years of the [[Salvadoran Civil War]]. His work was defining for the shape UCA took in its first years of existence and the years to come. Ellacuría was also responsible for the development of formation programs for priests in the Jesuit Central American province. 

Ellacuría's academic work was an important contribution to "Liberation Philosophy". This school of [[philosophy]] stems from the work of [[Augusto Salazar Bondy]] (1925–1974) and [[Leopoldo Zea]] (1912–2004). It focuses on liberating the [[oppressed]] in order "to reach the fullness of humanity". Ellacuría was also a strong supporter and contributor to [[Liberation Theology]].

The political implications of Ellacuría's commitment to his ideas met strong opposition from the [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[religious]] and political forces in El Salvador. This opposition led to Ellacuría's murder by the [[Military of El Salvador|Salvadoran army]] in 1989 at his residence in UCA along with five other fellow Jesuit priests and two employees. Their murder marked a turning point in the [[Salvadoran]] [[civil war]] (see [[History of El Salvador]]). On the one hand, it increased international pressures on the Salvadoran government to sign [[peace agreement]]s with the [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] [[organisation]] [[FMLN]]. On the other, it helped make Ellacuría's ideas (until then known only in [[Latin America]] and [[Spain]]) become known worldwide.

There are different types of Latin American liberation philosophy. Ellacuría's thought represents one of the currents within this philosophical tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=La Filosofía de la Liberación Latinoamericana |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rtZqXuDLLDoC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=La+Filosof%C3%ADa+de+la+Liberaci%C3%B3n+Latinoamericana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=G9ZjUsaAMOKG4AToy4CQBw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA |author=Horacio Cerutti |year=2006 |accessdate=2013-10-20 |language=es}}{{dead link|date=January 2015}}{{page needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellacuría joined the [[Jesuits]] in 1947 and was commissioned to the [[Central America]]n [[republic]] of [[El Salvador]] in 1948. He lived and worked there for much of his life until his bloody assassination in 1989. In 1958, Ellacuría studied theology with Vatican II theologian [[Karl Rahner]], S.J., in [[Innsbruck]], [[Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mártires de la UCA |title=Ignacio Ellacuría |url=http://www.uca.edu.sv/martires/new/ella/fella.htm|accessdate=October 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also lived in [[Ecuador]] and [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Ignacio Ellacuría (1930 - 1989) |url=http://www.uca.edu.sv/martires/ellacub.html |publisher=Universidad Centroamericana "José Simeón Cañas" |accessdate=2013-10-20 |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandolfo |year=2005 |accessdate=2013-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellacuría's philosophy takes as a starting point [[Xavier Zubiri]]'s (1898–1983) critique of Western philosophy. For Zubiri, ever since [[Parmenides]], Western thought separated sensing from [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]]. This error led to two results. The first one was what Zubiri called "the [[logification of intelligence]]" and the second one was what he called "the [[entification of reality]]".

The "logification of intelligence" implied that intellect was reduced to [[logos]]. This view led philosophers to believe that what they called "[[Being]]" was the cause of [[reality]], and this in turn, explained the confusion of [[metaphysics]] with [[ontology]].

Logification of intelligence excludes sensual, not so logical, functions of intelligence. Although Zubiri recognized descriptive logos and [[reason]] as important components of [[intelligence]], he pointed out that intelligence did not reduce itself to them. For Zubiri intelligence was a unity with the modalities of [[Sense|sensual]] apprehension, logos and reason.

The logification of intelligence led to the perception of reality as "Being" in a zone in space and time (as in [[Heidegger]]'s [[Dasein]]) of identifiable [[entities]] with an [[essence]], outside the [[human brain]]. This is what Zubiri called the "entification of reality". This perception sees reality as a particular form of "Being". Thereby, for Zubiri, "Being" had been "substantivised" by [[Western philosophy]].

For Zubiri, reality is paramount to Being, which is not a [[noun]], but a [[verb]]. Being is a particular aspect of reality and not the other way around. Metaphysics studies reality and ontology studies being. [[Human beings]]' way of accessing reality is intelligence, not a logified one, but a "sentient intelligence" that is itself a part of reality.

The senses, [[logic]], [[reason]], [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] and [[imagination]] are one and the same [[skill|faculty]], because each of these things determine one another. This faculty differences human beings from other [[species]] and has been achieved through [[evolution]]. Having a [[sentient]] [[intelligence]] implies having a conscience and the possibility to imagine new realities. These formulations are in themselves real by postulation. Realities by postulation can also be realised in other forms, because sentient intelligence has the ability to recognise the processual and structural character of reality. Therefore, human beings are able to influence it, and create and [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcend]] the historical boundaries that have been reached.

For Zubiri there is no need for a [[Philosophical realism|realist]]/[[anti-realist]] discussion on if there is or not a reality that is external and independent to human beings, or if reality is a bulk of internal illusions to human beings. It is both, but not in the sense [[critical realism (philosophy of perception)|critical realism]] pretends (where human beings are seen as a reality that can be separated from an objective outer reality). For Zubiri, human beings are imbedded in reality and cannot exist without it. They need [[air]], [[food]], [[water]] and other [[beings]]. The "outer" and [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] world must also come inside human beings for them to continue existing. Sentient intelligence should be able to make sense of this existence in a way that allows human beings to realise their capabilities in the world.

In this line of thinking, Ellacuría said human reality is unavoidably personal, [[social]] and [[historical]]. Biology and society are elements of history, which means that they are always in movement. But this should not be confused with [[historical materialism]] that says human beings are passive instruments of the forces of history. Human beings certainly inherit constraints constructed in the past but they always have the possibility to transcend them because of their sentient intelligence. Praxis is the name Ellacuría gives to reflected human action aimed at changing reality. Unlike other animals that can only respond mechanically to stimuli from outside, through sentient intelligence and praxis, human beings have to "realise" their existence. Individuals in [[dialectic]] interaction with society, have to make out what sort of Ego to have, by using their sentient intelligence, and this implies transcending inherited constraints.

This means that [[Social progress|progress]] in reality happens through a combination of physical, biological and "praxical" factors. Through praxis, human beings are able to realise a wider range of possibilities for action. In other words, one praxis can lead to a wider and more complete form of praxis. When this is so, praxis can be said to contribute to increase liberty, if liberty is defined as greater possibilities for action.

According to Ellacuría, the existence of people that are marginalized from [[society]] implies that [[history]] and practice have not delivered a wider range of possibilities for realisation for every human being in the world. This situation has prevented these excluded people to realise their existence as human beings. Therefore, it is a situation that stands away from the fullness of humanity and the fullness of reality. But this situation can be changed.

Ellacuría thought that before the evolution of humanity, the further development of historical reality took place only by physical and biological forces. But since the development of human beings, praxis can also contribute to realise historical reality. Since human beings have the possibility to reflect, it is philosophy's duty to exercise this ability to reflect, in order to change reality, and allow greater possibilities for individual realisation.

This way of thinking finds its parallels in the 1990s in [[Martha Nussbaum]]'s definition of human development as the increase in human capabilities for action&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Women and Human Development: The Capabilities Approach |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Women_and_Human_Development.html?id=9R69I--rpzUC&amp;redir_esc=y |author=Martha Nussbaum |year=2001 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521003858 |accessdate=2013-10-20}}{{page needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Amartya Sen]]'s notion of development as freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Development as Freedom |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qm8HtpFHYecC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=development+as+freedom&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ANdjUuCLGuTi4QTuqYCgBg&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=development%20as%20freedom&amp;f=false |author=Amartya Sen |year=1999 |accessdate=2013-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103042841/http://books.google.com/books?id=Qm8HtpFHYecC |archivedate=January 3, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}{{page needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As many other [[theologians]] of his [[generation]], Ellacuría intended to construct a new [[theology]], which he called a [[Historical Theology]]. Methodologically, his view of [[history]] followed the [[Hegelian]] [[dialectic]] tradition, that culminated in [[Marx]]'s [[historical materialism]]. However, in terms of content, he was also critical to Hegel's eurocentric view of history. Ellacuría rejected as well Marx's view of human beings as objects of their material conditions. He stressed the importance of [[conscience]], human praxis and its possibilities for influencing the course of history, and thereby material conditions themselves. He has been unfairly accused of trying to contaminate [[theology]] with [[Marxism]], but the methodological similarities of his thought with Marxism stem from a common Hegelian view of history as progress brought about by overcoming contradictions. Some, as [[Enrique Dussel]], would claim that the similarities between liberation theology and Marx's thought (not to be confused with mainstream interpretations of it) go even beyond that. And they are to be found in more profound common origins of the narrative of liberation in the [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition of thought, which Marx also shares.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Las metáforas teológicas de Marx |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Las_met%C3%A1foras_teol%C3%B3gicas_de_Marx.html?id=fEpGOgAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y |author=Enrique Dussel |publisher=Fundación Editorial El Perro y la Rana |year=2007 |isbn=9789803964184 |accessdate=2013-10-20 |language=es}}{{page needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By [[Historical Theology]] Ellacuría meant a way of making theology: to reflect about [[faith]] from the [[historical present]] and to reflect about the historical present from faith. According to him, all theology is conditioned by its historical present. Historical theology intends to acquire [[conscience]] about its historical context and to incorporate it fully. The concept of [[locus theologicus]] (theologogical place) is very important in this theology.

[[Rudolf Bultmann]] developed [[existential]] [[biblical hermeneutics]], or the idea that each individual can only read and understand the bible from his or her personal existential condition, and the biblical text acquires life only if it can awaken an experience of faith in the reader. This generates a [[hermeneutic]]al [[circle]], since the reader understands the [[Bible]] from his historical present and the historical present from the Bible. Ellacuría placed himself in this hermeneutic tradition, and he gave a step further. For Ellacuría, the reader is not just an individual but a [[community]], just like the people of [[Israel]] in the [[Old Testament]]. This means that [[community faith]] comes first, and then [[individual faith]].

According to Ellacuría, the value of the Old Testament is not reduced with the [[New Testament]]. The New Testament makes the community character of faith from the Old Testament something radical and universal. It makes it radical, because it establishes that the alliance of God with people is much more than a simple code of laws and lithurgical rituals; it is an invitation to justice and charity, not as exceptional practices, but as a stable structure. That is why this alliance is established in a law. It mates the faith universal, because the New Testament is communicated to every human being, independently of race, culture, sex, religion or social condition.

[[Liberation Theology]] is then a new way of doing [[Historical Theology]] in a particular [[locus theologicus]]: the historical present of Latin America, where a large portion of the population is oppressed by structures that deny them the possibilities to satisfy their needs and to develop. It arises from the spirit of ''[[Gaudium et spes]]'' of the [[Second Vatican Council]] and the [[social]] [[encyclical]]s of [[Pope John XXIII]], and more specifically, the [[Episcopal Conference]]s of [[Medellín]] in 1968 and [[Puebla]] in 1978. Such a reflection on the Bible is supported on the historical present of a collectivity that desires liberation from oppression. There is a long biblical tradition about liberation that starts with the [[Book of Exodus]].

According to Ellacuría, [[Collective Salvation|salvation]] is accomplished [[historically]], not just individually, but collectively. It is not just about liberation from [[evil]], [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], personal or social offenses, [[pain]], [[disease]] and [[fetichism]]. Those forms of liberation only start by liberation from unjust structures like [[slavery]], [[political]] domination, [[psychological]] and [[social]] [[oppression]]. Besides the book of Exodus, the Bible also presents other such cases of liberation from oppression as the return from [[exile]] in [[Babylon]] in the books of [[Esdras]] and [[Nehemiah]]; the fight against [[Macedon]]ian occupation in the book of [[Maccabees]]; the [[Beatitude]]s of [[Jesus]]; and the book of [[Apocalypse]] in the face of the persecution of [[Christians]] in [[Rome]].

Other forms of doing [[historical theology]] would be for example [[Feminist Theology]]; [[African-American theology]] as developed by [[Martin Luther King]] in the fight for [[civil rights]] in the [[United States]]; [[African Liberation Theology]], that has mostly been applied to [[South Africa]] in the fight against [[apartheid]]; and [[Indigenous Theology]] that stems from [[Bartolomé de las Casas]] and other missionaries in the first [[Spain|Spanish]] [[colonies]] in the [[Americas]] in the 16th century.

==Union of science and theology==
From Ellacuría's commencement address to Santa Clara University in 1982,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Commencement Address Santa Clara University |url=http://www.scu.edu/Jesuits/ellacuria.html |author=Ignacio Ellacuría |date=June 1982 |publisher=Santa Clara University |accessdate=2013-10-20}} Republished from {{cite news |work=Santa Clara Today |date=October 1982 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellacuría was aware of the challenges implied in relating [[theology]] with [[science]]. However he managed to articulate a relationship between the two in his vision of a [[university]] that served the purpose of [[liberty|liberating]] the [[oppression|oppressed]].

According to Ellacuría, there are two aspects to every university. The most evident one is that it deals with culture, or in other words, knowledge and the use of sentient intellect. The second, and not so evident, is that it must be concerned with the [[social reality]], precisely because a university is inescapably a social force; it must transform and enlighten the society in which it lives.

Ellacuría believed that a university cannot always and in every place be the same. It must constantly look at its own peculiar [[historical reality]]. The [[Third World]] is characterized more by oppression than by [[liberty]], more by [[poverty]] than by abundance. According to Ellacuría, in such a context a university must do everything possible so that liberty overcomes oppression. He added that the university must carry out this general commitment with the means uniquely at its disposal. As an intellectual community, the university must analyse causes; use imagination and creativity together to discover the remedies to problems; communicate a consciousness that inspires the freedom of self-determination; educate professionals with a conscience, who will be the immediate instruments of such a transformation; and constantly hone an educational institution that is both academically excellent and ethically oriented.

Ellacuría thought that it is possible for reason and faith to merge in confronting the reality of the poor. Reason must open its eyes to their suffering, while faith sees in the weak of this world what salvation must mean and the conversion to which we are called.

Such a university must take into account the [[preferential option for the poor]]. This does not mean that only the poor will study at the university; it does not mean that the university should abdicate its mission of academic excellence, an excellence which is needed in order to solve complex social issues of our time. What it does mean, is that the university should be present intellectually where it is needed; to provide science for those without science; to provide skills for those without skills; to be a voice for those without voices; to give intellectual support, for those who do not possess the academic qualifications to make their rights legitimate.

In the same year Freimann took up the rabbinate of the Jewish congregation in [[Wieleń|Filehne]], later changing to the same position in Ostrowo, both then in the [[provinces of Prussia|Prussian province]] of Posen.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"/&gt; In 1865 he graduated (Ph. D.) at the [[University of Jena|Ducal Pan-Saxon University (Salana)]] (now Friedrich Schiller University) in [[Jena]] upon Saale, then [[Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"/&gt; He wrote his doctor thesis, ''Ein Beitrag zur Geschichte der Ophiten'' (A contribution to the history of the [[Ophites]]), supervised by Dean [[Johann Gustav Stickel]].&lt;ref name="Biographisches 2004 333"&gt;''Biographisches Handbuch der Rabbiner'': 2 parts, Michael Brocke and Julius Carlebach (eds.), Carsten Wilke (compil.), Part 1: 'Die Rabbiner der Emanzipationszeit in den deutschen, böhmischen und großpolnischen Ländern 1781-1871': 2 vols., Munich: Saur, 2004, vol. 1 'Aach - Juspa', p. 333. {{ISBN|3-598-24871-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 7 September 1871 on he worked as rabbi for the ''Israelitische Gemeinde Ostrowo'',&lt;ref name="Freimann 1896 16"/&gt; thus ending a vacancy since the death of his predecessor [[Aron Stössel]] (d. 31. Mai 1861).&lt;ref name="Freimann 1896 16"/&gt; Freimann served his office in Ostrowo until his death.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"/&gt; In 1875, after Rector [[Zecharias Frankel|Zacharias Frankel]]'s death Freimann declined to succeed him as rector of the Breslau-based [[Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau|Jewish Theological Seminary of Fraenckel's Foundation]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"/&gt; From 1874 to 1884 Freimann gave Jewish religion classes in the Royal Gymnasium of Ostrowo.&lt;ref&gt;Aron Freimann, ''Geschichte der Israelitischen Gemeinde Ostrowo'', Ostrowo: no publ., 1896, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900 his fellow townspeople named a street, the "Freimannstraße", in his honour.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"/&gt; Freimanns successor was Rabbi Dr. [[Elias Plessner]], son of the Preacher Salomon Plessner from Berlin.&lt;ref name="Freimann 1896 16"/&gt;

Freimann's edition of the [[midrash]]ic work ''{{Interlanguage link multi|והזהיר|he}}'' (We-Hizhir: 2 parts), to which he added the valuable commentary ''ענפי יהודה'' (ʿAnpēi Yehûdāh), is indisputable evidence of his learning.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"/&gt; The [[responsa#In Judaism|responsa]] (''בנין ציון'' [Binyan Ẓiyyon]) of his father-in-law [[Jacob Ettlinger]] contain many of Freimann's essays.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"/&gt; With his wife Helene Ettlinger (1834–1902; mar. 1860) Freimann had eight children, Josef, Nanette (mar.

{{Wiktionary|recusal}}
'''Judicial disqualification''', also referred to as '''recusal''', is the act of abstaining from participation in an official action such as a [[court case|legal proceeding]] due to a [[conflict of interest]] of the [[Judge|presiding court official]] or administrative officer. Applicable statutes or canons of [[ethics]] may provide standards for recusal in a given proceeding or matter. Providing that the judge or presiding officer must be free from disabling conflicts of interest makes the fairness of the proceedings less likely to be questioned.

== Recusal in the United States ==
In the United States, the term "recusal" is used most often with respect to court proceedings. Two sections of [[Title 28 of the United States Code]] (the Judicial Code) provide standards for judicial disqualification or recusal. Section 455, captioned "Disqualification of justice, judge, or [[United States magistrate judge|magistrate judge]]," provides that a federal judge "shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his [[impartiality]] might reasonably be questioned." The section also provides that a judge is disqualified "where he has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party, or personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding"; when the judge has previously served as a lawyer or witness concerning the same case or has expressed an opinion concerning its outcome; or when the judge or a member of his or her immediate family has a financial interest in the outcome of the proceeding.

28 U.S.C. Section 144, captioned "Bias or prejudice of judge," provides that under circumstances, when a party to a case in a [[United States District Court]] files a "timely and sufficient [[Motion (legal)|Motion]] that the judge before whom the matter is pending has a personal bias or prejudice either against him or in favor of an adverse party," the case shall be transferred to another judge.

The general rule is that, to warrant recusal, a judge's expression of an opinion about the merits of a case, or his familiarity with the facts or the parties, must have originated in a source outside the case itself. This is referred to in the United States as the "extra-judicial source rule" and was recognized as a general presumption, although not an invariable one, in the 1994 U.S. Supreme Court decision in ''Liteky v. United States''.

At times justices or judges will recuse themselves ''[[sua sponte]]'' (on their own motion), recognizing that facts leading to their disqualification are present. However, where such facts exist, a party to the case may suggest recusal. Generally, each judge is the arbiter of a motion for the judge's recusal, which is addressed to the judge's conscience and discretion. However, where lower courts are concerned, an erroneous refusal to recuse in a clear case can be reviewed on [[appeal]] or, under extreme circumstances, by a petition for a [[writ of prohibition]].

In certain special situations, circumstances that would otherwise call for recusal of a judge or group of judges may be disregarded, when otherwise no judge would be available to hear the case. For example, if a case concerns a salary increase payable to a judge, that judge would ordinarily be disqualified from hearing the case. However, if the pay increase is applicable to all of the judges in the court system, the judge will keep the case, because the grounds for recusal would be equally applicable to any other judge. The principle that a judge will not be disqualified when the effect would be that no judge could hear the case is sometimes referred to as the "rule of necessity".&lt;ref&gt;See ''United States v. Will'', 449 U.S. 200 (1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Supreme Court cases ===
In the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], the Justices typically recuse themselves from participating in cases in which they have financial interests. For example, Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] generally did not participate in cases involving telecommunications firms because she owned stock in these firms, and Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] has disqualified himself in some cases involving insurance companies because of his participation in a [[Lloyd's of London]] syndicate. Justices also have declined to participate in cases in which close relatives, such as their children, are lawyers for one of the parties. Even if the family member is connected to one of the parties but is not directly involved in the case, justices may recuse themselves – for instance [[Clarence Thomas]] recused himself in ''[[United States v. Virginia]]'' because his son was attending [[Virginia Military Institute]], whose policies were the subject of the case. On occasion, recusal occurs under more unusual circumstances; for example, in two cases, Chief Justice [[William H. Rehnquist]] stepped down from the bench when cases were argued by Arizona attorney James Brosnahan, who had testified against Rehnquist at his confirmation hearing in 1986. Whatever the reason for recusal, the ''[[United States Reports]]'' will record that the named justice "took no part in the consideration or decision of this case."

A notable case was the 2001 death penalty appeal by [[Napoleon Beazley]], convicted of a 1994 murder, in which a full three justices recused themselves due to personal ties to the victim's son, federal appeals court judge [[J. Michael Luttig]]. Luttig had previously clerked for Justice [[Scalia]], and had led the confirmation efforts on behalf of both [[David Souter]] and Clarence Thomas. The death sentence was upheld all the same.

Historically, standards for recusal in the Supreme Court and lower courts were less rigorous than they have become in more recent years. In the 1803 case of ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] participated in the decision and authored the opinion of the Court even though Marshall's actions as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] two years prior could be seen as the subject of the proceeding. On the other hand, Marshall did recuse himself in both the 1813 and 1816 hearings of ''[[Martin v. Hunter's Lessee]]'', despite its equally significant constitutional implications, as he and his brother had contracted with Martin to buy the land in dispute. Moreover, during the 19th century, the U.S. federal court system was structured so that an appeal from a judge's decision was often heard by an appellate panel containing the same judge, who was expected to sit in impartial review of his own earlier ruling. This situation is no longer permissible, and 28 U.S.C. § 47 provides that "No judge shall hear or determine an appeal from the decision of a case or issue tried by him."

A notable dispute over recusal in U.S. Supreme Court history took place in 1946, when Justice [[Hugo Black]] participated in deciding the ''[[Jewell Ridge Coal Corp. v. Mine Workers|Jewell Ridge Coal]]'' case, although a former law partner of Black argued for the prevailing side. The losing party in the 5–4 decision sought reargument on the ground that Black should have been disqualified; Black declined to recuse himself and the decision stood, but Justice [[Robert H. Jackson]] wrote a short opinion suggesting that the decision that Black should sit in the case was Black's alone and the Court did not endorse it. The dispute aggravated infighting between Black and Jackson, and it has been suggested that this was one of the reasons that, when Chief Justice [[Harlan Fiske Stone]] died, President [[Harry S. Truman]] appointed [[Fred M. Vinson]] to succeed Stone rather than promote a sitting Associate Justice to Chief Justice.

In 1973, then-Associate Justice Rehnquist wrote a lengthy [[in-chambers opinion]] declining to recuse himself in ''[[Laird v. Tatum]]'', a case challenging the validity of certain arrests, even though Rehnquist had previously served as a [[White House]] lawyer and opined that the arrest program was valid.&lt;ref&gt;''Laird v. Tatum'', 408 U.S. 824 (1972) (Rehnquist, J., in chambers).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] wrote an opinion declining to recuse himself in a case to which [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]] was a party in his official capacity, despite the contention of several [[Environmentalism|environmental]] groups that Scalia's participation created an appearance of impropriety because Scalia had recently participated in a widely publicized [[hunting]] trip with the Vice President.&lt;ref&gt;''Cheney v. United States District Court'', 541 U.S. 913 (2004) (Scalia, J., in chambers).&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, however, Scalia recused himself without explanation in ''[[Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow]]'', a [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] case challenging inclusion of the words "under God" in the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]], after giving a public speech in which Scalia stated his view that Newdow's claims were meritless.

=== Other federal cases ===
In 1974, federal judge [[Leon Higginbotham]] issued his decision in ''Comm. of Pa. v. Local 542, Int'l Union of Operating Engineers'', explaining why he as an [[African American]] judge with a history of active involvement in the civil rights struggle was not obligated to recuse himself from presiding over litigation concerning claims of racial discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leagle.com/decision/1974543388FSupp155_1516.xml/COMMONWEALTH+OF+PA.+v.+LOCAL+U.+542,+INT.+U.+OF+OP.+ENG.|title=COMMONWEALTH OF PA. v. LOCAL U. 542, INT. U. OF OP. ENG. – 388 F.Supp. 155 (1974) – Leagle.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He held, in an opinion that was followed by later judges, including a series of black judges who faced recusal requests, that a judge should not be forced to recuse solely because of their membership in a minority group.&lt;ref name="tabletmag.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/186718/jewish-judges-recusal|title=Should Jewish Judges Recuse Themselves From Cases Involving Palestinian Terrorism?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jewish federal Judge [[Paul Borman]] relied on the Higginbotham opinion in part in his 2014 decision not to recuse himself from the trial of Palestinian-American [[Rasmea Odeh]].&lt;ref name="tabletmag.com"/&gt; Similarly, in 1994, Jewish then-federal-Judge [[Michael Mukasey]] refused to recuse himself in a case concerning the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]], warning that his recusal would “disqualify not only an obscure district judge such as the author of this opinion, but also Justices [[Justice Brandeis|Brandeis]] and [[Justice Frankfurter|Frankfurter]] ... each having been both a Jew and a Zionist.”&lt;ref name="tabletmag.com"/&gt;

=== Administrative agency and other matters ===
Outside the judicial system, the concept of recusal is also applied in [[administrative agencies]]. When a member of a multi-member administrative body is recused, the remaining members typically determine the outcome. When the sole occupant of an official position is recused, the matter may be delegated to the official's deputy or to a temporarily designated official; for example, when the [[Solicitor General of the United States]] is recused from a case, the Deputy Solicitor General will handle the matter in his or her place. On March 2, 2017, [[Jeff Sessions]], [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General of the U.S.]], recused himself while the department investigated [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|Russian interference in the 2016 election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shear|first1=Eric Lichtblau, Michael D.|last2=Savage|first2=Charlie|title=Jeff Sessions Recuses Himself From Russia Inquiry|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/us/politics/jeff-sessions-russia-trump-investigation-democrats.html|work=The New York Times|date=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concepts analogous to recusal also exist in the legislative branch. The rules of the [[United States Senate]] and [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] provide that a Member should not vote on a measure as to which he or she has a personal financial interest. In such cases, the Senator or Representative may record a vote of "present" rather than "yea" or "nay".

== Applicable to most countries ==
Laws or court rules provide the recusal of judges. Although the details vary, the following are nearly universal grounds for recusal.

* The judge is related to a party, attorney, or spouse of either party (usually) within three [[degrees of kinship]].
* The judge is a [[litigant|party]].
* The judge is a material [[witness]] unless pleading purporting to make the Judge a party is false (determined by presiding judge, but see ''[[Substitution (law)|substitution]]'').
* The judge has previously acted in the case in question as an attorney for a party, or participated in some other capacity.
* The judge prepared any legal instrument (such as a [[contract]] or [[Will (law)|will]]) whose validity or construction is at issue.
* [[Appeal|Appellate]] judge previously handled case as a [[trial court|trial judge]].
* The judge has personal or financial interest in the outcome. This particular ground varies by jurisdiction. Some require recusal if there is any interest at all in the outcome, while others only require recusal if there is interest beyond a certain value.
* The judge determines he or she cannot act impartially.

== Responsibility and consequences ==
A judge who has grounds to recuse themself is expected to do so. If a judge does not know that grounds exist to recuse themselves the error is [[harmless error|harmless]]. If a judge does not recuse themselves when they should have known to do so, they may be subject to sanctions, which vary by jurisdiction. Depending on the jurisdiction, if an appellate court finds a judgment to have been made when the judge in question should have been recused, it may set aside the judgment and return the case for retrial.

== Waiver and substitution ==
The recusal rule may be avoided or ignored if all parties and the judge agree, although in practice this rarely occurs. If recusal is avoided in this manner, a full and complete record of the facts that qualify as grounds, above, must be made for the appellate court.

If a judge fails to recuse themselves ''sua sponte'' and a party believes the judge has a bias the party may motion for [[Substitution (law)|substitution]]. In some jurisdictions [[litigants]] may have the right to substitute a judge, even if no bias is demonstrated.

'''Julius Friedrich August Bahnsen''' (March 30, 1830 &amp;ndash; December 7, 1881) was a [[Germany|German]] [[philosopher]]. Bahnsen is usually considered the originator of [[characterology]] and a real-[[dialectic]]al method of [[Human self-reflection|philosophical reflection]] which he laid down in his two-volume ''Contributions to Characterology'' (1867) and developed forth with his following works, amongst others his [[masterpiece|opus magnum]] ''The Contradiction in the Knowledge and Being of the World'' (1880/82).

==Biography==
Born in [[Tønder|Tondern (Tønder)]], [[Schleswig]], in 1830 Bahnsen began his study of [[philosophy]] and (under [[Gregor Wilhelm Nitzsch]]) [[philology]] in [[University of Kiel|Kiel]]. From 1849 he fought as a [[Military volunteer|volunteer]] against the [[Denmark|Danes]] in the [[First War of Schleswig]] (1848–1851) and fled to [[University of Tübingen|Tübingen]] in the [[Kingdom of Württemberg]] after the disarming of [[Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig-Holstein’s]]  army in 1850. There he studied philosophy and in 1853 graduated under [[Friedrich Theodor Vischer]] with a topic relating to the [[aesthetics]]. Various employments as a teacher followed. In 1862, Bahnsen acquired an employment at a [[Gymnasium (school)|progymnasium]] in [[Lębork|Lauenburg (Lębork)]], [[Province of Pomerania (1815–1945)|Hinterpommern]], where he lived until his death.

==Philosophical work==
As a disciple of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], Bahnsen dared a mergence of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel’s]] dialectic (which Bahnsen, however, accepted only within the realms of the [[Abstract object|abstract]]) and Schopenhauer’s [[monism]]. Though in this connection the reasonless, all-embracing Schopenhauerian [[Will (philosophy)|will]] is still accepted as the essence of the world and the only thing real, it doesn’t regard the will as being the same within all individuals, but as just as manifold as these individuals.

This characterological element of Bahnsen’s teachings, on which the works of such philosophers as [[Ludwig Klages]] are build upon, is laid down in the ''Contributions to Characterology'' (1867) as well as the disquisitions ''On the Relationship Between Will and Motive'' (1870) and ''Mosaics and Silhouettes'' (1877). Since the nature of unreasonableness consists in contradiction—particularly the contemporaneous existence of multiple will directions attaching themselves to each other—it follows that not only reality is a continuous struggle of material contrasts (real-dialectic), but that the inside of each individual is addicted to the insolvable antagonism of opposite will directions (will collisions) as well. Bahnsen negates a redemption of the countless will units (“will henades”, as he expresses it himself) and postulates the permanence of the existence of the contradiction as a basic nature of the world, whereby the law of this world becomes a tragic world order.

The real-dialectical side of his teachings Bahnsen laid down in the paper ''On the Philosophy of History'' (1871), his central work ''The Contradiction in the Knowledge and Being of the World'' (1880/82), and his anniversary publication to the jubilee of the city Tübingen ''The Tragical as World Law and Humour as Aesthetic Shape of the Metaphysical'' (1877).

=== Philosophy&lt;!--'Realdialektik' redirects here--&gt;===

At the beginning of his delve into philosophy, Julius Bahnsen developed an interest in [[Hegelianism]], which was in decline yet still popular in early 19th century Germany. From Hegel's teachings, Bahnsen found his [[panlogism]] and radical rationalism dissatisfying. In Bahnsen's view, there was a stark mismatch between the unconcealed [[irrationality]] of the world and the naive theories, rationalizations and explanations of various philosophers. Existence itself seemed harsh, confusing and downright ''contradictory''. Starting out from these premises, Bahnsen found Hegel's idea of the [[dialectic]] appealing. The dialectic explained the ingrained opposition of the world with itself in a cycle of perpetual conflict (as [[Heraclitus]] had observed in his fragments centuries earlier). However, Bahnsen believed that Heraclitus's postulate of an underlying [[Logos]] and Hegel's idea of the rational [[Zeitgeist|spirit]] had misled them and had contaminated Hegel's formulation of the dialectic with [[progressivism]] and [[historicism]]. As a response to this "misunderstanding", Bahnsen developed his own idea of the '''''Realdialektik'''''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;. In the ''Realdialektik'', there was no notion of ''synthesis'' between two opposing forces. The opposition results only in negation and the consequent destruction of contradicting aspects. For Bahnsen, no rationality was to be found in being and thus, there was no [[Teleology|teleological]] power that led to progress at the end of every conflict.

Yet Bahnsen's philosophical system was only taking it's very first steps. He accepted a "modified" form of Hegel's dialectic, but by removing the metaphysical driving entity, there remained a void to be filled in his worldview. This led to Bahnsen's accidental discovery of the [[World as Will and Representation]]  by [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]. After carefully examining this [[magnum opus]] and discussing it personally with the [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Frankfurt philosopher]], Bahnsen realized that the metaphysical notion of an irrational will underlying all of creation was just what he needed in his own system. After several years of studying Schopenhauer's works, Bahnsen became very proficient and knowledgeable in the "philosophy of will". He was regarded as one of the most capable philosophers in the ''Schopenhauer Schule'', rivalled only by Schopenhauer's personal literary executor - [[Julius Frauenstadt]]. However, as Bahnsen's own system matured, he began to deviate from Schopenhauer's teachings in considerable ways.

Bahnsen had always harbored an interest in [[psychology]], specifically the method of examination of individual [[Characterology|characters]] and [[temperaments]]. He viewed each person as unique and as a result of this view, could not entirely accept Schopenhauer's preference for [[monism]] (the idea that every person and every thing is merely a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_Spinoza#Substance,_attributes,_and_modes modus] of a singular metaphysical entity). Similar to fellow german pessimist [[Philipp Mainländer]], Bahnsen leaned towards [[Pluralism (philosophy)|ontological pluralism]] and asserted that there is no unified will, but only ''individual wills'', with their own specific cravings, aims and wishes. However, these individual wills ("will henades"&lt;ref name="Compare with Leibniz's idea of 'monads' in the 'Monadology'"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Compare with Leibniz |first1=Gottfried |title=Monadology}}&lt;/ref&gt;) suffer from contradictory desires due to their irrational nature. This is the result of Bahnsen's combination of Schopenhauer's [[Voluntarism (philosophy)|voluntaristic]] metaphysic and his own ideas of the ''Realdialektik''. A crucial difference between Schopenhauer's worldview, which offers salvation for some via the freed Intellect's [[Arthur Schopenhauer#Ethics|silencing of the will]], and that of Bahnsen is that, in Bahnsen's philosophical system - there is no salvation. For Bahnsen, without the will the intellect is impotent. It cannot "will" [[nothingness]], for a will-to-nothingness is still a form of willing, and willing non-willing is a contradiction. Yet it is not impossible for the intellect to have such ideas as, according to Bahnsen, all ideas bred by the intellect are contradictory as the will's desires are irrational and eternally in conflict with themselves. This extremely pessimistic worldview ,which offers no escape for the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]], differentiates Bahnsen not only from Schopenhauer, but also from the rest of his pessimistic contemporaries ([[Julius Frauenstädt|Frauenstadt]], [[Philipp Mainländer|Mainlander]], [[Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann|Hartmann]]). His ideas are arguably more unsettling than Mainlander's notion of a will-to-die, yet strangely similar to [[Friedrich Nietszche]]'s idea of the [[eternal return]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Frederick |first1=Beiser |title=Weltschmerz: Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860-1900 |publisher=Oxford University Press, 2016 |pages=229–244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Correspondence with Hartmann ===

Bahnsen developed a close friendship with fellow philosopher [[Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann]], until they eventually fell out and became philosophical rivals. This is not surprising, as both thinkers had similar philosophical beginnings and influences, yet differed crucially in their interpretation of these influences. Hartmann placed Schopenhauer's idea of an ever-desiring will within the unconscious psyche of the subject, while accepting Hegel's underlying rationalism and historicism. Hartmann had an affinity for pantheist monism, and asserted that the will and the rational spirit were ultimately one and the same. In contrast, Bahnsen rejected Hegel's rationalism and accepted his dialectic in a negative form, while integrating it with a pluralized version of Schopenhauer's metaphysics of will. This is a rather ironic demonstration of Bahnsen's idea of ''existence as contradiction'', as Bahnsen and Hartmann's interest in [[Hegel|both]] [[Schopenhauer|philosophers]] both drew them together ''and'' created contention within their friendship.

Hartmann criticized Bahnsen's [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]] and claimed that the common point between all "individual wills" is a singular will. Whilst Bahnsen criticized Hartmann, claiming that his "Hegelian rationalism" corrupted the teachings of Schopenhauer's essentially purposeless will. Hegel's [[Zeitgeist|spirit]] could not be combined with the Schopenhauerian will, Bahnsen asserted, because this geist is teleological and has always had an endgoal. The will has no goals for that would require rationality and Schopenhauer was clear that the intellect was only an accidental slave to the will, and not an essential feature to it. Hartmann defended himself by claiming that the will itself was irrational and precisely because of this, it needed the spirit to direct it towards a goal. Otherwise, creation could not have occurred. The representations we observe are the will's only goals and these representations are evidently rational. Bahnsen countered that ''[[feeling]]'' is the will's non-representational goal and that not all of the will's aims are rational. This debate could not be resolved, as Hartmann regarded ''feeling'' as an [[Unconsciousness|unconscious representation]], while Bahnsen could not bring himself to accept the unprovable reality of this so-called "unconscious representation".

Additionally, Bahnsen disagreed with Hartmann on fundamental points. If the will and the (rational) ideas are different (as Hartmann claimed), how do the Ideas influence the Will at all if they don't have a will of their own? Hartmann would claim that they are ''"different, yet unified''", staying true to his [[monism]]. Yet, this would appear as a contradiction to Bahnsen and would further solidify the power of Bahnsen's own convictions and conclusions stemming from his ''Realdialektik''. As for Hartmann, he did not accept Bahnsen's theories and diagnosed him with a ''psychopathic melancholy'' and a philosophical inability to distinguish "conflict" from "contradiction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Beiser |first1=Frederick |title=Weltschmerz: Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860-1900 |publisher=Oxford University Press, 2016 |pages=246–263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theory of tragedy ===

Bahnsen's theory of [[tragedy]] derived directly and naturally from the ''contradictory'' ideas of his ''Realdialektik''. In his own time, the acclaimed theories of tragedy were those of Schiller and Hegel. For them, the correct moral choice in a tragic hero's circumstances is always clear and extremely painful, precisely because of these circumstances. I.e. no matter how clear this choice is, it is always difficult to choose it. A good example is Hegel, who claims that we must always choose the good of the collective, regardless of how difficult this would be for the particular individual. Bahnsen disagreed with such a notion. For him, a ''clear choice'' is never obvious, there's not even a clear choice to be had. In tragedy, the hero must choose between his duties and/or his values. Whatever he chooses, he will sin and be punished for not choosing the other (punished either by law or by guilt). From this observation, Bahnsen concluded that tragedy exposes precisely this inner contradiction that is inherent in the world. In his 2016 work ''Weltschmerz: Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860-1900'' the american professor of philosophy [[Frederick Beiser]] expresses Bahnsen's views:

"The fate of the modern individual is that he or she must choose between these values and these worldviews, where the choice cannot be exclusive, moral, correct or rational. This is the tragic fate."

This is why Bahnsen claims that ultimately, reason cannot help us in our lives and that our choices must be dictated by feeling. A few years before [[Nietzsche]] developed his [[perspectivism]] and [[Kierkegaard]] wrote that all [[Either/Or|choices lead to sorrow]] and regret,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kierkegaard |first1=Soren |title=Either/Order |pages=Section: An Ecstatic Discourse}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahnsen had already foreseen these conclusions. He complained that a typical christian missionary would claim that one should just "do the right thing and be rewarded", yet there is not one "right" thing. Each moral choice has consequences and all of them have both advantages and disadvantages. In the face of such a dire existence, Bahnsen views [[humour]] as almost sacred. It alone gives us the ability to "laugh&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brobjer |first1=Thomas |title=Nietzsche's Philosophical Context: An Intellectual Biography |publisher=University of Illinois Press, 2008 |page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; off&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Beiser |first1=Frederick |title=Weltschmerz: Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860-1900 |publisher=Oxford University Press, 2016 |page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;" the tragedy of being and to avoid the clutches of depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Beiser |first1=Frederick |title=Weltschmerz: Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860-1900 |publisher=Oxford University Press, 2016 |pages=263–267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transcendental realism ===
{{main|Transcendental realism (Schopenhauer)}}
During the end of his life, Bahnsen completed his philosophical project. Despite constant editions and slight changes in details, three principle premises remained throughout Bahnsen's philosophy:

1) Contradiction exists in the heart of reality, and is not a mere attribute of our thoughts about reality

2) Contradiction does not get resolved in synthesis

3) The source of contradiction is the will

Other than rejecting Hegel's progressivism and reinterpreting Schopenhauer's singular will, Bahnsen also denied all forms of [[Transcendental idealism|idealism]]. For him, the ideas of idealism are inherently [[Solipsism|solipsistic]] and do not take into consideration the unique reality of the individual wills of other people. For this reason and for other more technical purposes, Bahnsen agreed with his fellow pessimists [[Julius Frauenstädt]], [[Philipp Mainländer]] and [[Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann]] that [[Transcendental realism (Schopenhauer)|transcendental realism]] is superior to transcendental idealism.

"The will is divided, willing what it does not will and not willing what it will" - Julius Bahnsen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Beiser |first1=Frederick |title=Weltschmerz: Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860-1900 |publisher=Oxford University Press, 2016 |page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bahnsen's interpretation of pessimism ===

At the end of his life, Bahnsen wrote an article on [[pessimism]], attempting to distinguish his own pessimism from that of his contemporaries. According to this article, Bahnsen found his position to be opposed to idealistic optimism and depricating cynicism. He stated that the pessimist preserves his "idealist heart" but utilizes the "cold calculation of the head" to strike a middle ground. Thus, the pessimist realizes that alleviating the suffering of all (even of one) is next to impossible, yet the grief caused by this impossibility strengthens the pessimist's tireless pursuit of this goal, instead of demoralizing him/her. Because he feels the "weltschmerz" of being, he is fueled even further by empathy and compassion.

Bahnsen was critical of ''"hedonistic''" pessimism - the position that the pains of the world outnumber it's pleasures in quality and quantity. Once more, the philosopher reasserted his convictions regarding individualism and claimed that such a calculus was impossible to make, as it would measure each individual differently. There are other reasons to be pessimistic about the world, he claimed: To realize that all moral aims and ideals are futile, yet to pursue them nonetheless, knowing full well that there is no exit or salvation - that is true pessimism.

'''Justin Oakley''' is a [[bioethicist]] and moral [[philosopher]]. He has been part of the revival of the ethical doctrine known as [[virtue ethics]], an [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] doctrine which has received renewed interest in the past few decades.

Oakley is particularly well known for his work on professional ethics and also the so-called 'problem' of friendship. The problem of friendship looks at how a strict application of impartialist ethical doctrines, such as [[utilitarianism]] and [[Kantianism]], conflicts with our notions of friendship or 'true friendship'. In 1995, he published, with [[Dean Cocking]], the now widely cited article "Indirect Consequentialism, Friendship, and the Problem of Alienation" in the journal ''Ethics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Indirect Consequentialism, Friendship, and the Problem of Alienation |publisher= Ethics, JSTOR |url= https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2382006?uid=3737536&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21104334068361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==

Oakley was educated at [[Sydney Road Community School]], Brunswick, and studied his Bachelor of Arts at [[Swinburne University of Technology]], graduating in 1981. He completed his PhD in Philosophy at [[La Trobe University]] in 1988.&lt;ref name='bio'&gt;{{cite web |title= Associate Professor Justin Oakley » Biography |publisher= Monash University, Arts |url= http://profiles.arts.monash.edu.au/justin-oakley/biography/ |accessdate= 14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He teaches in the Master of Bioethics program run by Monash University [[Centre for Human Bioethics]].

== Work and awards ==

Oakley joined the [[Centre for Human Bioethics]] at [[Monash University]] (established by colleague [[Peter Singer]]) in 1990 and served as its Director for 13 years, from 1999 to 2012.&lt;ref name='deputy'&gt;{{cite web |title= New Centre Director |publisher= Monash University, Arts |date= 25 September 2012 |url= http://artsonline.monash.edu.au/bioethics/new-centre-director/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2012, he became Deputy Director&lt;ref name='deputy'/&gt; to spend more time on his research.

In 2004, he was awarded the [[Eureka Prizes|Eureka Prize]] for Research in Ethics.&lt;ref name='eureka'&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Eureka Prizes - 2004 Research Ethics |work= |publisher=Australia Museum |year=2004 |url=http://www.amonline.net.au/eureka/index.cfm?objectid=763A7781-E8A4-B1BA-DC2224EF17E505F9 |format= |doi= |accessdate=2008-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929111120/http://www.amonline.net.au/eureka/index.cfm?objectid=763A7781-E8A4-B1BA-DC2224EF17E505F9 |archivedate=29 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr '''Karim Azkoul''', PhD (1915-2003) was a [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] diplomat and philosopher born in [[Rashaya]], [[Lebanon]] on July 15, 1915.&lt;ref name="The International Who's Who 2004"&gt;{{cite book|title=The International Who's Who 2004|publisher=Europa Publications|page=86|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=neKm1X6YPY0C&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86&amp;dq=%22who%27s+who%22+karim+azkoul&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=l4R3BinURW&amp;sig=WVwXXGDmRJI_zztbCwyF_zzRfzo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=joUZVY6tGoKLaNidgeAB&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22who's%20who%22%20karim%20azkoul&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; His most notable achievements include his participation in the original writing of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].

==Politics and philosophy==
Although Karim Azkoul made it a point to specify he was in no way anti-Semitic or anti-Jewish, he nevertheless was of a firmly anti-Zionist political stance. He also strongly advocated Arab unification, and often spoke out against foreign national intervention in the Middle East. He predicted that tensions would worsen if the United States continued to increase its military presence in the Middle East. He also maintained that Lebanon (and the rest of the Arab world) was well on its way towards genuine democracy, as long as the western powers did not act against United Nations wishes when involving itself in the region's politics.&lt;ref name="Press Report"&gt;{{cite web|last=Azkoul|first=Karim|title=U.S. Support of Zionists Criticized by Lebanese|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19470712&amp;id=EfxOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6v8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4786,5018017|publisher=Toledo Blade|accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Karol Libelt''' (8 April 1807, [[Chwaliszewo]], [[Poznań]], [[Duchy of Warsaw]] - 9 June 1875, [[Brdowo]]) was a [[Poland|Polish]] philosopher, writer, political and social activist, social worker and [[liberalism|liberal]], [[nationalism|nationalist]] politician, and president of the [[Poznań Society of Friends of Learning]].

==Life and work==

[[File:Karol Libelt.jpg|thumb|upright 0.8|Libelt, c. 1860]]
Libelt took part in the failed [[November Uprising]] against Russia in 1830, and was imprisoned for nine months at [[Magdeburg]]. Since 1839 he became the head of a secret committee started to organise yet another uprising against the [[Partitions of Poland|partitioning powers]], which was nicknamed the ''Libelt Committee'' - ''Komitet Libelt''). For taking part in the [[Greater Poland Uprising (1846)]] He was sentenced by the [[Prussia]]n authorities to 20 years of imprisonment in a fortress for taking part in the [[Greater Poland Uprising (1846)]]. However, he was amnestied in 1848 and returned to [[Poznań|Posen]] (Poznań), where he took part in the [[Greater Poland Uprising (1848)]] and joined various organisations supporting the independence of Poland ([[Polish National Committee (1848)|Polish National Committee]] and Revolutionary Committee). During the [[Spring of Nations]] he was elected as one of the members of the [[Frankfurt Parliament]]; he also took part in the [[Slavic Congress]] in [[Prague]] in June 1848.

In 1849 he was elected a member of the Prussian parliament and became the director of the liberal ''Dziennik Polski'' (Polish Daily). The following year Libelt began to establish various scientific and social organisations in [[Greater Poland]], including the [[Society of Friends of the Sciences]] in [[Poznań|Posen]] (Poznań), which became a ''de facto'' university. Between 1868 and 1875 he headed the Society and gave lectures in [[æsthetics]].  In 1873, he was elected to the Prussian Lower House.

In his philosophical works, Libelt described the so-called [[Polish messianism]], or a belief that the history of the world would be redeemed by the Polish people, who gained moral excellence because of the suffering of their fatherland. He believed in existence of a super-rational cognitive power, visible through art. He is known internationally mainly because of the word [[intelligentsia]] popularized by him in one of his books (''Filozofia i krytyka'' - ''Philosophy and Critics'').

Tsiolkovsky spent most of his life in a [[log house]] on the outskirts of [[Kaluga]], about {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of Moscow. A [[recluse]] by nature, his unusual habits made him seem bizarre to his fellow townsfolk.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Cathleen Susan. 2008.

==Early life==
He was born in [[Izhevskoye]] (now in [[Spassky District, Ryazan Oblast|Spassky District]], [[Ryazan Oblast]]), in the [[Russian Empire]], to a middle-class family. His father, Edward Tsiolkovsky (in {{lang-pl|Ciołkowski}}), was a [[Poles|Polish]] forester of [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] faith who emigrated to Russia;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/topnav/materials/listbytype/A_Pictorial_History_of_Rockets.html|title=A Pictorial History of Rockets|last=|first=|publisher=NASA|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; his mother was of mixed [[Volga Tatars|Volga Tatar]]  and [[Russians|Russian]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;Земной путь звездоплавателя.

Биография, 18 фото|website=Top-antropos.com|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was successively a forester, teacher, and minor government official.  At the age of 10, Konstantin caught [[scarlet fever]] and became hard of hearing. When he was 13, his mother died.&lt;ref name="NotableScientists"&gt;{{citation|last=Narins|first=Brigham|title=Notable Scientists from 1900 to the Present|volume=5|pages=2256–2258|publisher=The Gale Group|location=Farmington Hills, MI|year=2001|isbn=0-7876-5454-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was not admitted to elementary schools because of his hearing problem, so he was self-taught.&lt;ref name="NotableScientists"/&gt; As a reclusive home-schooled child, he passed much of his time by reading books and became interested in mathematics and physics. As a teenager, he began to contemplate the possibility of space travel.

Tsiolkovsky spent three years attending a Moscow library where [[Russian cosmism]] proponent [[Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov|Nikolai Fyodorov]] worked. He later came to believe that [[space colonization|colonizing space]] would lead to the perfection of the human race, with immortality and a carefree existence.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;[http://www.informatics.org/museum/tsiol.html The life of Konstantin Eduardovitch Tsiolkovsky 1857–1935] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615044125/http://www.informatics.org/museum/tsiol.html |date=15 June 2012 }}. Informatics.org (19 September 1935). Retrieved 4 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, inspired by the fiction of [[Jules Verne]], Tsiolkovsky theorized many aspects of space travel and [[Spacecraft propulsion|rocket propulsion]]. He is considered the father of [[spaceflight]] and the first person to conceive the [[space elevator]], becoming inspired in 1895 by the newly constructed [[Eiffel Tower]] in Paris.

Despite the youth's growing knowledge of physics, his father was concerned that he would not be able to provide for himself financially as an adult and brought him back home at the age of 19 after learning that he was overworking himself and going hungry. Afterwards, Tsiolkovsky passed the teacher's exam and went to work at a school in [[Borovsk]] near Moscow. He also met and married his wife Varvara Sokolova during this time. Despite being stuck in [[Kaluga]], a small town far from major learning centers, Tsiolkovsky managed to make scientific discoveries on his own.

The first two decades of the 20th century were marred by personal tragedy. Tsiolkovsky's son Ignaty committed suicide in 1902, and in 1908 many of his accumulated papers were lost in a flood. In 1911, his daughter Lyubov was arrested for engaging in revolutionary activities.

==Scientific achievements==

Tsiolkovsky stated that he developed the theory of rocketry only as a supplement to philosophical research on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kazyutinski V.

Tsiolkovsky's first scientific study dates back to 1880–1881. He wrote a paper called "Theory of Gases," in which he outlined the basis of the kinetic theory of gases, but after submitting it to the Russian Physico-Chemical Society (RPCS), he was informed that his discoveries had already been made 25 years earlier. Undaunted, he pressed ahead with his second work, "The Mechanics of the Animal Organism". It received favorable feedback, and Tsiolkovsky was made a member of the Society. Tsiolkovsky's main works after 1884 dealt with four major areas: the scientific rationale for the all-metal balloon (airship), streamlined airplanes and trains, hovercraft, and rockets for interplanetary travel.

In 1892, he was transferred to a new teaching post in Kaluga where he continued to experiment. During this period, Tsiolkovsky began working on a problem that would occupy much of his time during the coming years: an attempt to build an [[Metal-clad airship|all-metal dirigible]] that could be expanded or shrunk in size.

Tsiolkovsky developed the first aerodynamics laboratory in Russia in his apartment. In 1897, he built the first Russian wind tunnel with an open test section and developed a method of experimentation using it. In 1900, with a grant from the Academy of Sciences, he made a survey using models of the simplest shapes and determined the drag coefficients of the sphere, flat plates, cylinders, cones, and other bodies. Tsiolkovsky's work in the field of aerodynamics was a source of ideas for Russian scientist [[Nikolay Yegorovich Zhukovsky|Nikolay Zhukovsky]], the father of modern aerodynamics and hydrodynamics. Tsiolkovsky described the airflow around bodies of different geometric shapes, but because the RPCS did not provide any financial support for this project, he was forced to pay for it largely out of his own pocket.

Tsiolkovsky studied the mechanics of powered flying machines, which were designated "dirigibles" (the word "airship" had not yet been invented). Tsiolkovsky first proposed the idea of an [[Metal-clad airship|all-metal dirigible]] and built a model of it. The first printed work on the airship was "A Controllable Metallic Balloon" (1892), in which he gave the scientific and technical rationale for the design of an airship with a metal sheath. Progressive for his time, Tsiolkovsky was not supported on the airship project, and the author was refused a grant to build the model. An appeal to the General Aviation Staff of the Russian army also had no success. In 1892, he turned to the new and unexplored field of heavier-than-air aircraft. Tsiolkovsky's idea was to build an airplane with a metal frame. In the article "An Airplane or a Birdlike (Aircraft) Flying Machine" (1894) are descriptions and drawings of a monoplane, which in its appearance and aerodynamics anticipated the design of aircraft that would be constructed 15 to 18 years later. In an Aviation Airplane, the wings have a thick profile with a rounded front edge and the fuselage is [[Aircraft fairing|faired]]. But work on the airplane, as well as on the airship, did not receive recognition from the official representatives of Russian science, and Tsiolkovsky's further research had neither monetary nor moral support. In 1914, he displayed his models of all-metal dirigibles at the Aeronautics Congress in St. Petersburg but met with a lukewarm response.

Disappointed at this, Tsiolkovsky gave up on space and aeronautical problems with the onset of World War I and instead turned his attention to the problem of alleviating poverty. This occupied his time during the war years until the Russian Revolution in 1917.

Starting in 1896, Tsiolkovsky systematically studied the theory of motion of rocket apparatus. Thoughts on the use of the rocket principle in the cosmos were expressed by him as early as 1883, and a rigorous theory of rocket propulsion was developed in 1896. Tsiolkovsky derived the formula, which he called the "[[Tsiolkovsky rocket equation|formula of aviation]]", establishing the relationship between:
* change in the rocket's speed (&lt;math&gt;\delta V&lt;/math&gt;)
* [[Specific impulse|exhaust velocity]] of the engine (&lt;math&gt;v_e&lt;/math&gt;)
* initial (M0) and final (M1) mass of the rocket

:&lt;math&gt;\delta V=v_e \ln\left( {M_0\over M_1} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

After writing out this equation, Tsiolkovsky recorded the date: 10 May 1897. In the same year, the formula for the motion of a body of variable mass was published in the thesis of the Russian mathematician [[Ivan Meshchersky|I. V. Meshchersky]] ("Dynamics of a Point of Variable Mass," I. V. Meshchersky, St. Petersburg, 1897).

His most important work, published in May 1903, was ''Exploration of Outer Space by Means of Rocket Devices''. &lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Tsiolkovsky |first=Konstantin E. |title=The Exploration of Cosmic Space by Means of Reaction Devices |journal=The Science Review |issue=5 |year=1903 |url=http://epizodsspace.testpilot.ru/bibl/dorev-knigi/ciolkovskiy/issl-03st.html |accessdate=22 September 2008 |language=ru |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019234511/http://epizodsspace.testpilot.ru/bibl/dorev-knigi/ciolkovskiy/issl-03st.html |archivedate=19 October 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tsiolkovsky calculated, using the [[Tsiolkovsky equation]],{{r|siddiqi2000}}{{rp|1}} that the horizontal speed required for a minimal [[orbit]] around the Earth is 8,000&amp;nbsp;m/s (5 miles per second) and that this could be achieved by means of a [[multistage rocket]] fueled by [[liquid oxygen]] and [[liquid hydrogen]]. In the article "Exploration of Outer Space by Means of Rocket Devices", it was proved for the first time that a rocket could perform space flight. In this article and its subsequent sequels (1911 and 1914), he developed some ideas of missiles and considered the use of liquid rocket engines.

The outward appearance of Tsiolkovsky's spacecraft design, published in 1903, was a basis for modern spaceship design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Dream Machines|last=Miller|first=Ron|publisher=|year=|isbn=0-89464-039-9|location=|pages=88|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The design had a hull divided into three main sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Dream Machines|last=Miller|first=Ron|publisher=|year=|isbn=0-89464-039-9|location=|pages=95|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot and copilot were in the first section, the second and third sections held the liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen needed to fuel the spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Dream Machines|last=Miller|first=Ron|publisher=|year=|isbn=0-89464-039-9|location=|pages=96|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the result of the first publication was not what Tsiolkovsky expected. No foreign scientists appreciated his research, which today is a major scientific discipline. In 1911 he published the second part of the work "Exploration of Outer Space by Means of Rocket Devices". Here Tsiolkovsky evaluated the work needed to overcome the force of gravity, determined the speed needed to propel the device into the solar system ("escape velocity"), and examined calculation of flight time. The publication of this article made a splash in the scientific world, Tsiolkovsky found many friends among his fellow scientists.

In 1926–1929, Tsiolkovsky solved the practical problem regarding the role played by rocket fuel in getting to escape velocity and leaving the Earth. He showed that the final speed of the rocket depends on the rate of gas flowing from it and on how the weight of the fuel relates to the weight of the empty rocket.

Tsiolkovsky conceived a number of ideas that have been later used in rockets. They include: gas rudders (graphite) for controlling a rocket's flight and changing the trajectory of its center of mass, the use of components of the fuel to cool the outer shell of the spacecraft (during re-entry to Earth) and the walls of the combustion chamber and nozzle, a pump system for feeding the fuel components, the optimal descent trajectory of the spacecraft while returning from space, etc.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} In the field of rocket propellants, Tsiolkovsky studied a large number of different oxidizers and combustible fuels and recommended specific pairings: liquid oxygen and hydrogen, and oxygen with hydrocarbons. Tsiolkovsky did much fruitful work on the creation of the theory of jet aircraft, and invented his chart Gas Turbine Engine.{{clarify|date=June 2012}} &lt;!--Sorry, can't repair. What does this mean?--&gt; In 1927 he published the theory and design of a train on an air cushion. He first proposed a "bottom of the retractable body" chassis.{{clarify|date=June 2012}} However, space flight and the airship were the main problems to which he devoted his life. Tsiolkovsky had been developing the idea of the [[hovercraft]] since 1921, publishing a fundamental paper on it in 1927, entitled "Air Resistance and the Express Train" .&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Gillispie|first=Charles Coulston|title=Dictionary of Scientific Biography|page=484|year=1980|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|isbn=0-684-12925-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Air Cushion Vehicle History |publisher=Neptune Hovercraft Shipbuilding Company |url=http://www.hovercraft.ru/history.html |accessdate=22 September 2008 |language=ru |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002004457/http://www.hovercraft.ru/history.html |archivedate=2 October 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, Tsiolkovsky proposed the construction of multistage rockets in his book ''Space Rocket Trains''.

[[File:TsiolkovskyCoin.jpg|thumb|right|1 ruble commemorative coin, 1987]]
Tsiolkovsky championed the idea of the diversity of life in the universe and was the first theorist and advocate of [[human spaceflight]].

Tsiolkovsky never built a rocket; he apparently did not expect many of his theories to ever be implemented.

Hearing problems did not prevent the scientist from having a good understanding of music, as outlined in his work "The Origin of Music and Its Essence."

==Later life==
Although Tsiolkovsky supported the [[Bolshevik Revolution]], he did not particularly flourish under a communist system. Eager to promote science and technology, the new Soviet government elected him a member of the [[Socialist Academy]] in 1918.{{r|siddiqi2000}}{{rp|1–2,8}} He worked as a high school mathematics teacher until retiring in 1920 at the age of 63. In 1921 he received a lifetime pension.{{r|siddiqi2000}}{{rp|1–2,8}}

Only late in his lifetime was Tsiolkovsky honored for his pioneering work. In particular, his support of [[eugenics]] made him politically unpopular.&lt;ref&gt;[http://russiapedia.rt.com/prominent-russians/space-and-aviation/konstantin-tsiolkovsky/ Konstantin Tsiolkovsky – Russiapedia Space and aviation Prominent Russians]. Russiapedia.rt.com. Retrieved 4 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; However, from the mid 1920s onwards the importance of his other work was acknowledged, and he was honoured for it and the Soviet state provided financial backing for his research. He was initially popularized in Soviet Russia in 1931-1932 mainly by two writers:&lt;ref name=siddiqi2010&gt;{{Citation|pages=62–65|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iVilfSI_5sAC&amp;pg=PA63|title=The Red Rockets' Glare: Spaceflight and the Soviet Imagination, 1857-1957|isbn=9780521897600|author1=Siddiqi|first1=Asif A|date=26 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Iakov Perel'man]] and [[Nikolai Rynin]]. Tsiolkovsky died in Kaluga on 19 September 1935 after undergoing an operation for [[stomach cancer]]. He bequeathed his life's work to the Soviet state.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

==Legacy==
Although many called his ideas impractical,{{r|siddiqi2000}}{{rp|8,117}} Tsiolkovsky influenced later rocket scientists throughout Europe, like [[Wernher von Braun]]. Russian search teams at [[Peenemünde]] found a German translation of a book by Tsiolkovsky of which "almost every page...was embellished by von Braun's comments and notes."&lt;ref name=siddiqi2000&gt;{{Citation|last=Siddiqi |first=Asif A |url=https://history.nasa.gov/printFriendly/series95.html |title=Challenge To Apollo: The Soviet Union and the Space Race, 1945–1974 |publisher=[[NASA]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061008193942/https://history.nasa.gov/printFriendly/series95.html |archivedate=8 October 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|27}} Leading Soviet rocket-engine designer [[Valentin Glushko]] and rocket designer [[Sergey Korolev]] studied Tsiolkovsky's works as youths,{{r|siddiqi2000}}{{rp|6–7,333}} and both sought to turn Tsiolkovsky's theories into reality.{{r|siddiqi2000}}{{rp|3,166,182,187,205–206,208}} In particular, Korolev saw traveling to Mars as the more important priority,{{r|siddiqi2000}}{{rp|208,333,337}} until in 1964 he decided to compete with the American [[Project Apollo]] for the moon.{{r|siddiqi2000}}{{rp|404}}

In 1989, Tsiolkovsky was inducted into the [[International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame]] at the [[San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Sprekelmeyer, Linda, editor.

==Philosophical work==
[[File:Volition-of-the-Cosmos.jpg|thumb|The cover of the book ''The Will of the Universe. The Unknown Intelligence'' by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, 1928, considered to be a work of [[Cosmism (Russian)|Cosmist]] philosophy.]]
Tsiolkovsky wrote a book called ''The Will of the Universe. The Unknown Intelligence'' in 1928 in which he propounded a philosophy of [[panpsychism]].  He believed humans would eventually [[Colonization of space|colonize the Milky Way galaxy]]. His thought preceded the [[Space Age]] by several decades, and some of what he foresaw in his imagination has come into being since his death. Tsiolkovsky also did not believe in traditional religious cosmology, but instead (and to the chagrin of the Soviet authorities) he believed in a cosmic being that governed humans as "marionettes, mechanical puppets, machines, movie characters",&lt;ref&gt;"Is There God?" by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky&lt;/ref&gt; thereby adhering to a mechanical view of the universe, which he believed would be controlled in the millennia to come through the power of human science and industry.

[[File:Ladislav Klíma.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Ladislav Klíma]]
'''Ladislav Klíma''' (22 August 1878&amp;nbsp;– 19 April 1928), was a Czech philosopher and novelist influenced by [[George Berkeley]], [[Schopenhauer]] and [[Nietzsche]]. His philosophy is referred to varyingly as [[existentialism]] and [[subjective idealism]].

==Life==
Ladislav Klíma was born in the town of [[Domažlice]] in western [[Bohemia]].
He came from a moderately wealthy family. After expulsion from the school system in 1895 for allegedly insulting the State, the Church, and — out of what he described as “historical analphabetism”&lt;ref name="Autobiography"&gt;Autobiography&lt;/ref&gt; — the Habsburgs, he lived alternately in [[county of Tyrol|Tyrol]], [[Zurich]], and [[Prague]]. As part of his philosophy he only ever took on short term work. For a time he also lived off occasional royalties from his publications and the periodic generosity of his friends. While only part of Klíma’s work was published before his death, many manuscripts were edited posthumously, among which were his stories and letters. Many manuscripts he destroyed himself. Klíma spent the later part of his life living in a hotel, shining shoes for a living, drinking spirits and eating vermin. Klíma died of [[tuberculosis]] and is buried in Prague.&lt;ref&gt;[https://billiongraves.com/grave/Ladislav-Kl%C3%ADma/18678780 Gravesite of Ladislav Klíma], BillionGraves.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Klíma rejected the norms of contemporary Czech society in both the way he lived and in what he wrote. Culture, moral values and the world itself are all rejected and reality is subjected to the will of the individual. 
Much of Klíma’s philosophy is expressed in ''"World as Consciousness and Nothing"'' ("Svět jako vědomí a nic", 1904). He took ideas from his philosophical predecessors to the extreme and tried to incorporate them into his practical life. For [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], each object exists only because it is perceived, ''to be is to be perceived''. Klíma takes this a stage further and suggests that the individual creates the world with his own will. 
Where the highest achievement for [[Schopenhauer]] is the man who denied his will, Klíma conversely suggests that the realization of one’s own will is the primary achievement. This brings Klíma close to [[Nietzsche]] with his will to power liberating itself from the bounds of the bourgeois world and affirming itself. 
Klíma's individuality lies not only in his conception of [[philosophy]], but also in his attempt to conform to it in his personal life. 
His autobiographical writings illustrate his attempts to grasp his own power and to shout his ''"Deus sum"'' ("I am God"). He tested his own deity in a life without any money, and in non-conformism that rejected all conventions, including a job. All this was to lead Klíma to control of self. However, Klíma also had friends and patrons who supported him in difficulties. ''Utrpení knížete Sternenhocha''
(''The Sufferings of Prince Sternenhoch'': Prague 1928) is his most famous novel. In a series of journal entries, the book chronicles the descent into [[Insanity|madness]] of Prince Sternenhoch, who moves from the life of a nobleman to a life filled with suffering, eccentricity, bouts of madness and self-torment. Having sunk to the lowest level, he eventually attains an ultimate state of bliss and salvation.

The '''Legion of Christ''' ('''LC''') is a [[Roman Catholic]] [[religious institute]], made up of priests and [[seminarian]]s studying for the priesthood. It is affiliated with the apostolic movement [[Regnum Christi]], founded in 1959, which includes lay persons and diocesan priests and has branches of lay [[Regnum Christi Consecrated Men|Consecrated Men]] and [[Regnum Christi Consecrated Women]].&lt;ref name="Charism2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=Principles of the Charism of the Regnum Christi Movement|url=http://www.legrc.org/regnum_db/archivosWord_db/principles_of_regnum_christi_charism_(translation_from_spanish_original).pdf|publisher=Regnum Christi|accessdate=27 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Legion was founded in [[Mexico]] in 1941, by [[Marcial Maciel]]. He directed the congregation as its [[Superior General|general director]] until made to step down in January 2005 as a result of grave sexual scandals.

The Legion of Christ has founded [[monastery|religious communities]] in 21 countries. Its members include four [[Bishop (Catholicism)|bishops]], 961 [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priests]] and 617 [[Seminary|seminarians]] (not including [[minor seminary|minor seminarians]]) as of the end of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.regnumchristi.org/en/priests/statistics-legion-christ/ | title= Statistics of the Legion of Christ as of December 31, 2016 | publisher= Regnum Christi | website= regnumchristi.org | access-date= 2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. the Legion and its lay arm, [[Regnum Christi]], operate five [[Catholic school|schools]] (and assists at several others).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://rceducation.org/rc-schools-in-na | title= RC Education Schools in North America | publisher= RC Education | website= rceducation.org | access-date= 2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Regnum Christi]] is the lay movement. Like the Legionaries, they dedicate themselves to various [[apostolates]] such as education and [[spiritual direction]].

In 2006, Maciel was investigated by the [[Holy See]] and suspended from his ministry, initially over breaches of celibacy. This followed public revelations that he had sexually abused minors, which were later confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Vatican Inquiry Reflects Wider Focus on Legion of Christ | accessdate = 2012-05-11 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/12/world/europe/vatican-inquiry-reflects-wider-focus-on-legion-of-christ.html | work=The New York Times | first=Elisabetta | last=Povoledo | date=May 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maciel died in Jacksonville, Florida, on January 30, 2008, aged 87, and was buried in his hometown of Cotija de la Paz, Michoacán, Mexico.

After Maciel's death, and following more revelations, Pope [[Benedict XVI]] ordered an [[apostolic visitation]] in 2009. At the conclusion of the visitation, Cardinal [[Velasio De Paolis]] was delegated to examine the Legionaries' constitutions and conduct a visitation of its lay affiliate Regnum Christi. On October 19, 2012, De Paolis published a cover letter for a summary of the Regnum Christi's charism which he had approved as a working document.&lt;ref name="OCT2012"&gt;{{cite web | title=letter of Velasio De Paolis to the Legionaries of Christ and members of Regnum Christi|url=http://www.legrc.org/regnum_db/archivosWord_db/vdp_20121019_presentation_of_the_principles_of_regnum_christi_charism_(tranlation_form_italian_original).pdf|publisher=Regnum Christi|accessdate=27 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Legion completed a five-year renewal process that included a revision of its constitutions, which were approved during an extraordinary general chapter.  On 4 November 2014, after an extensive process of the reform of the Legionaries of Christ, the Vatican approved the congregation's amended constitutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncronline.org/news/vatican/vatican-approves-amended-constitutions-legionaries-christ|title=Vatican approves amended constitutions for Legionaries of Christ|date=3 November 2014|publisher=|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After its scandals, the Legion has had priests and seminarians leave. Centers of formation and apostolates have also closed.

==Ethos==
{{see also|Regnum Christi#Ethos}}

Members of the Legion take [[vows]] of [[obedience, chastity, and poverty]]. For several years they additionally took a private vow of charity, promising never to criticize their superiors. This private vow was abolished in 2006.  Since then, Legionaries have been learning to "freely debate" how their congregation is governed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2014/02/07/legionaries-of-christ-elect-new-leaders/|title=Legionaries of Christ elect new leaders – CatholicHerald.co.uk|publisher=|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Love for Christ''' is, for Legionaries, a personal experience. Through the [[Gospel]], the [[Crucifix|cross]], and the [[Eucharist]], Legionaries come to know Christ intimately, and love him in a passionate way by embracing him as their model of holiness.&lt;ref name="Spirituality"&gt;[http://www.legionariesofchrist.org/eng/articulos/categoria.phtml?lc=se-246_ca-678_ci-851 Spirituality - Legion of Christ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015012828/http://www.legionariesofchrist.org/eng/articulos/categoria.phtml?lc=se-246_ca-678_ci-851 |date=2011-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Love for Mary''' flows from imitating Christ; the Blessed Virgin is loved as both Mother of the Church and of the individual Legionary's vocation. Legionaries consecrate their spiritual and apostolic lives to her care, and seek to take on her virtues of [[faith]], [[hope]], [[Charity (virtue)|charity]], [[Vow of obedience|obedience]] to God, [[humility]], and cooperation with Christ's plan of redemption and justice.&lt;ref name="Spirituality" /&gt;

'''Love for Souls''' is expressed in an ardent desire to spread Christ's kingdom in this world. Legionaries try to use every moment of their time to help the greatest number of souls know and love Christ. They want to be able to say when they get to [[Heaven]] that they never wasted one minute or one soul.&lt;ref name="Spirituality" /&gt;

==Formation==

As a whole, the Legion is dedicated to advancing the Church's mission in the world, and to this end submits candidates to a rigorous formation of four dimensions: human, spiritual, intellectual and apostolic. This formation caused critics to accuse the Legion of producing priests and religious who all spoke and behaved in the same way. The Legion's defenders argued that, just as members of a family receive similar upbringing, so the members of the Legion were formed in like ways, but still respected the freedom of the individual.  The new constitutions approved by Pope Francis present a more balanced approach to the formation of members.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/pope-francis-approves-new-constitutions-for-the-legion-of-christ&lt;/ref&gt;

Contact with family is no longer controlled. If they live in the same country as their parents, the religious and priests are permitted to visit their families for only eight days. In addition, they are permitted to visit for landmark anniversaries of parents and grandparents. Their families are encouraged to visit them two or three times a year. The novices are forbidden to go home during their two-year novitiate, but their families may visit them for a limited amount of time. The high school seminarians are permitted to go home a few times a year such as two weeks in the summer, three days for Thanksgiving and four days for Christmas.

High school seminarians are encouraged to write to their families every week; other members of the congregation are also encouraged to write their families.

Some critics used to describe the Legion as a [[cult]].&lt;ref name="ncronline.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncronline.org/news/accountability/money-paved-way-maciels-influence-vatican|title=Money paved way for Maciel's influence in the Vatican|date=6 April 2010|publisher=|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Apostolates==
[[File:Cumbres.JPG|thumb|250px|The front of a Legionary School in Valencia, Spain.]][[File:Universidad Anahuac Norte.jpg|thumb|Logo of the Universidad Anáhuac México Norte.]]The [[apostolate]] of the Legionaries has many aspects, but focuses on the following:&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.legionariesofchrist.org/eng/articulos/seccion.phtml?se=239 Legionaries'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814144942/http://www.legionariesofchrist.org/eng/articulos/seccion.phtml?se=239 |date=2011-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:*Education and teaching at all levels. 
:*Pastoral attention to youth and families.
:*Catechesis and preaching of retreats and spiritual exercises.
:*Evangelization and mission work (especially in the Mexican State of [[Quintana Roo]] in the [[Yucatán Peninsula]]).
:*Attention to the underprivileged, especially those groups that undergo the greatest spiritual, moral or material privation.
:*Works of Christian charity and mercy.
:*Supporting bishops in the formation of diocesan seminarians and in the ongoing formation of their priests.
:*Spiritual attention to ''Regnum Christi'' members and accompanying them in their formation.

In the US, the congregation runs four schools. In 2012, all three of its high schools (Everest Collegiate High School, The Highlands School and Pinecrest Academy) were named in the list of top 50 Catholic High Schools developed by the [[Cardinal Newman Society]], a Catholic group dedicated to promoting the teaching of [[Pope John Paul II]] in his 1990 Apostolic Constitution ''[[Ex Corde Ecclesiae]].''&lt;ref&gt;Article on their own site: [http://www.regnumchristi.org/english/articulos/articulo.phtml?se=362&amp;ca=966&amp;te=707&amp;id=37783&amp;csearch=966 Among the Top 50] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213184638/http://www.regnumchristi.org/english/articulos/articulo.phtml?se=362&amp;ca=966&amp;te=707&amp;id=37783&amp;csearch=966 |date=2013-12-13 }} List:[http://blog.cardinalnewmansociety.org/2012/09/20/nations-top-50-catholic-high-schools-announced/ Nation’s Top 50 Catholic High Schools Announced] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922223651/http://blog.cardinalnewmansociety.org/2012/09/20/nations-top-50-catholic-high-schools-announced/ |date=2012-09-22 }}.

In Mexico, the Legionaries administer the [[Anahuac University Network]]. Legionaries operate centers of education (minor seminaries, seminaries, schools and/or universities) in Mexico, [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], [[Brazil]], [[Republic of Korea|Korea]], [[Ireland]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[France]], [[Germany]], and [[Canada]].

In 2006, the Legion launched a test phase of [http://www.missionnetwork.com Mission Network] in the United States. ''Catholic Mission Network, Inc.'', is the umbrella organization which oversees and approves Legionary-endorsed apostolates that are not stand alone like a school or retreat center. Its purpose is to provide both 1) structure and supervision of the apostolates, and 2) An overview as to what the Legion/Regnum Christi does as a whole, with brand-name-type recognition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.demisiones.com/usa/aboutus/5.php Mission Youth USA - Mission Network and Regnum Christi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326001300/http://www.demisiones.com/usa/aboutus/5.php |date=2012-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The youth wing of ''Regnum Christi,'' offering spirituality for youth 11 to 16, is called [[ECYD]]. The commitments in ECYD vary over time, adapting to the ages of the members.&lt;ref name="ECYD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regnumchristi.org/english/articulos/articulo.phtml?se=364&amp;ca=198&amp;te=820&amp;id=26937|title=ECYD - Regnum Christi|publisher=|accessdate=30 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201192918/http://www.regnumchristi.org/english/articulos/articulo.phtml?se=364&amp;ca=198&amp;te=820&amp;id=26937|archive-date=2016-12-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many ECYD members are involved in clubs run or overseen by Legionaries or consecrated members of ''Regnum Christi''.

==Expansion and Collapse==
The Legion began in Mexico where its largest base remains. Houses of formation were established in [[Spain]] and [[Italy]] within its first decade. In the 1960s, chapters of the organization were founded in Ireland and then in the United States. In the 1970s and 80s the congregation expanded throughout [[Latin America]]. In the 90s it expanded to [[France]] and [[Central Europe]].&lt;ref name="LChist"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.legionariesofchrist.org/eng/articulos/categoria_secc.phtml?lc=se-238_ca-886_ci-|title= Who we are|date= |work= |publisher= Legion of Christ|accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the sexual scandals of Maciel came to light, some priests and seminarians left the congregation. Several schools and centers of formation closed. &lt;!-- a longer description was given that lacked sources so this is simplified to what is easy to determine from various sources like comparing annual published numbers --&gt;

==Founder==
&lt;!--These people are listed in the order they came to prominence in the Legion of Christ.--&gt;

===Marcial Maciel===
[[Image:Fr. Marcial Maciel LC Late 2004.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Fr. Marcial Maciel]]
{{Main article|Marcial Maciel}}

[[Marcial Maciel]] was born in [[Cotija, Michoacán]] on March 10, 1920, into a devout Catholic family during a time in which the Mexican government was fiercely [[anticlericalism|anticlerical]]. He became a priest after a troubled youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:IrxrF81VH8cJ:www.vowsofsilencefilm.com/news/NCR_020508.pdf+Maciel%2Bseminary%2Bexpell&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESijSQ0OOTY3N-MIr10pt_BcFM3f1ezbnRefqnf4yLTFoSHk16Xjcps_fqRV-1src69dhh-Cq_WyxnOs-jfkcndCX_FQWZzzcKU-olTPfwNPieePgA--QvSoMh5OwDH8YdvMMWh_&amp;sig=AHIEtbSdsTnwq1Jo4N042i84gag7g8WSSg |title=Analysis: Legion of Christ Founder leaves a flawed legacy |publisher=Docs.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Maciel was expelled from two seminaries for reasons that have never been explained. He became a priest only when one of his uncles ordained him after private studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1141/is_13_44/ai_n24943499/ |title=Fr. Marcial Maciel leaves behind a flawed legacy &amp;#124; National Catholic Reporter &amp;#124; Find Articles at BNET |publisher=Findarticles.com |date=2008-02-22 |accessdate=2010-09-19 | first=Jason | last=Berry  |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108034753/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1141/is_13_44/ai_n24943499/ |archivedate=2016-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After years of denial by the Congregation and the Regnum Christi movement and dismissal of accusations made by many former members, an investigation prompted by the Vatican led to the conclusion that allegations of sexual abuse of minors by Maciel were true. The superiors of the congregation did not officially inform the rest of the congregation until a year after his death, during which time, they continued to permit an internal culture of revering him as a saint. When the information was leaked to the press, the Legion was pressured into making a statement on the matter.

The Legionaries of Christ accused the founder, the Rev. Marcial Maciel Degollado, who died in 2008, of “reprehensible and objectively immoral behavior” as head of the order from its founding in 1941 until Pope Benedict XVI removed him in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/07/world/legionaries-of-christ-denounce-founder-marcial-maciel-degollado.html|title=Legionaries of Christ Denounce Founder, Marcial Maciel Degollado|date=7 February 2014|work=The New York Times|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Legion underwent a visitation by the Vatican and a process of renewal through a series of discussions revolving around the [[Spiritual gift|charism]] of the movement, the relationship of the congregation to the lay movement, and the place of both within the Church. The entire congregation revised the Constitutional document under the direction of a central committee and presented a final version to the new Pope Francis. Under the guidance of Cardinal Velasio De Paolis, the congregation announced the order's Extraordinary General Chapter in Rome in January 2014, for a "total restructuring". After the General Chapter new superiors were appointed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2846">'''Ludwig Babenstuber''' (1660 – 5 April 1726) was a [[Germany|German]] [[philosopher]] and [[theologian]] and vice-chancellor of the [[University of Salzburg]].

He was born in 1660 at [[Teining]] in [[Bavaria]]. Having completed his early studies he entered the novitiate of the [[Order of St. Benedict]] at [[Ettal Abbey]] in 1681, made his religious profession in 1682, and thereafter devoted the greater part of his life to teaching.

At the commencement of his studies he had given no promise of brilliancy, but by his untiring application and industry he shortly acquired so vast a store of knowledge, that he soon came to be regarded as one of the most learned men of his day -- "vir comsummatae in omni genere dictrinae et probitatis", as he is styled in [[Dom Egger]]'s ''Idea ordinis Hierarchico-Benedictini'', and in the ''History of the University of Salzburg''. Until 1690 Babenstuber was Director of the scholasticate of his order at [[Salzburg]], taught [[philosophy]] there from 1690 to 1693, then went to the [[Augustinian]] [[Schlehdorf Abbey]] to teach [[theology]] in the monastery of the [[Canons Regular]].

Returning to Salzburg in 1695, he took up successively the professorships of moral theology, dogmatic theology, and exegesis, in the celebrated Benedictine university of that city. He remained at Salzburg for twenty-two years, during which period he held the office of vice-rector for three years, and that of vice-chancellor of the university for six. In 1717 he returned to his monastery at Ettal, where he spent the remainder of his days.

In dogmatic theology Babenstuber was a pronounced [[Thomist]]; in moral, a vigorous defender of [[probabilism]]. He maintained, among other things, that a single author, if he were "beyond contradiction" (omni exceptione major), could, of his own authority, render an opinion probably, even against general opinion. In matters of faith, however, he rejected the principle of probabilism absolutely. In one of his disquisitions he had also stated that it was allowable to celebrate [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] privately on Maundy Thursday and Holy Saturday, but before his ''Ethica Supernaturalis'' had issued from the press, he learned that the Roman tribunals forbade it, and so he promptly corrected that assertion. Babenstuber's published works include a wide range of subjects, mainly philosophical and theological. The most important are ''Philosophia Thomistica'' (4 vols., Salzburg, 1704) and ''Ethica Supernaturalis'' (Augsburg, 1718).

He died on 5 April 1726 at the Benedictine monastery of Ettal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4436">'''Meshico''' is a term which began to be employed in the middle of the 20th century by a group of Mexican intellectuals connected to the influential magazine ''Meshico Grande'' in order to define a philosophical and [[sociological]] stance based on an authentic [[ontology]] of the Mexican person, one that would serve, as well, as a means of confronting the dependency of the official [[intelligentsia]] on ways of thinking perceived as being too foreign to permit a true understanding of Mexican reality.  

The group decided on the unusual spelling in order to differentiate itself from the official [[euro-centric|Europeanizing]] intelligentsia; they believed that the spelling "meshico" was historically more accurate as it reflected the original [[Nahuatl]] pronunciation of  the word, and, for this reason, would be an appropriate name for a group dedicated to a professedly authentic understanding of Mexican identity (''Mexicanidad''). 

Among the many notable members of the group were [[Rosario María Gutiérrez Eskildsen]], [[Manuel Sánchez Mármol]], [[Francisco Javier Santamaría]], and [[José Vasconcelos]]. The [[Tabasco|Tabascan]] Dr. Ricardo Alfonso Sarabia [[Spanish names#The particle "y"|y]] Zorrilla was one of the group's more assiduous promoters and served for a time as director of ''Meshico Grande''. He also contributed to a wider awareness of the group's goals and positions by writing, among other works, a paper entitled "Filosofía de la acción y reseña del pensamiento filosófico de Meshico" [Philosophy of Action and Review of the Philosophical Thinking of Meshico], which was originally published in the ''[[International Congress of Philosophy|Proceedings of the 11th International Congress of Philosophy]]'', [[Brussels]] 1953. 

Sarabia y Zorrilla cites, in the aforementioned work, the definition of [[Truth]] given by the obscure and retiring Mexican philosopher and mathematician Edmundo Cetina Velázquez: "[it is knowledge] which corresponds to the integral unity of being; the world of thought will always reveal to us an external world, sensible or abstract; but always unilateral. 'Truth,' which is reality, is the [[Property|patrimony]] of the totality of being." Sarabia y Zorrilla saw in such a statement a correct testimony of faith in an [[Confirmation holism|epistemological holism]] functioning in opposition to the notion of knowledge as a goal obtainable only through a [[scientific]] vision which is essentially and necessarily [[ontic]] and [[a posteriori]] (compare the avowal made by Sarabia himself in the same text: "everything is related, coordinated, linked harmoniously and amorously").   

José Gómez Robleda, a teacher, [[psychiatrist]] and [[Secretariat of Public Education|Subsecretary of Public Education]] during the [[Adolfo Ruiz Cortines]] administration, published in 1947 a book titled ''Imagen del Mexicano'' (Image of the Mexican). Sarabia y Zorrilla describes the study as "the work which for the first time studies the way of being of the Mexican man," especially in his [[Psychological anthropology|ethnopsychological]] dimensions, and praises it for a vision of the human which, owing to its philosophical balance, succeeds in avoiding the worst [[rationalism|rationalistic]] tendencies of [[Auguste Comte|Comtian]] [[Positivism]], without falling into the no less problematic [[Cosmos|cosmic]] mysticism of José Vasconcelos (who Professor Sarabia once described, with no intended harshness, as a "philosopher-artist").

==Print==
* [[Eiji Yoshikawa]]'s famous novel ''[[Musashi (novel)|Musashi]]'' (originally serialized in [[Asahi Shinbun]] prior to [[World War II]]) is more or less based on historical events with added fictitious characters. Yoshikawa's book was termed the "''Gone with the Wind'' of Japan" by translator, Japan expert and former ambassador [[Edwin O. Reischauer]] in the foreword to the book.
* The manga series ''[[Vagabond (manga)|Vagabond]]'' is loosely based on Eiji's famous novel, in which Miyamoto Musashi is the main character, noted as a 'blood-lustful beast' throughout the series' beginning. After confronting Yagyu Sekishusai and personally contemplating{{clarify|date=May 2012|reason=Contemplating?}} that he had "felt the way", Musashi became more mature in the art of the sword, vowing to become the greatest swordsman under the sun.
* [[The Necromancer: The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel|The Necromancer]], the fourth installment in Michael Scott's [[The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel]] series, refers to Niten. [[Perenelle Flamel]] states that "he is undoubtedly the greatest swordsman in the world—the only humani ever to defeat [[Scathach]] in single combat. But if you ask him what he is, he will tell you that he is an [[artist]]. And that is true: his skill with the brush is legendary. [...] Niten has traveled this world and the nearby Shadowrealms in search of opponents to fight simply to hone his skills. He was supposed to have been made immortal sometime in the seventeenth century by [[Benzaiten]], who many—including the Witch—believe may even be one of the ancient Great Elders. Niten was also known as Miyamoto Musashi."
* ''Sorekara no Musashi'' (Further Tales of Musashi), a novel by Katsukiro Kouyama. It has been made into several television specials over the years, one of which featured [[Kinnosuke Yorozuya|Kinnosuke Nakamura]].
* In [[Robert Jordan]]'s book ''[[The Dragon Reborn]],'' several references are made to a man named Jearom, the greatest swordsman of all. His only loss was to a farmer wielding a [[quarterstaff]], probably a reference to Musashi's fight with Gonnosuke in Yoshikawa's novel.
* Manga artist [[Go Nagai]] gave the name Musashi to one of the pilots on his giant robot [[mecha]] creation, ''[[Getter Robo]]''. He always carried a sword.
* The [[comic book]] ''[[Usagi Yojimbo]]'' has as its central character a [[rabbit]] samurai who is inspired by Musashi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Take one part Toshiro Mifune. Then add adventure and humor to get artist Stan Sakai's 'Usagi Yojimbo.' |publisher= The Los Angeles Times|date=1993-03-08|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1993-03-08/news/vw-1786_1_usagi-yojimbo|accessdate=2011-02-26 | first=Charles | last=Solomon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Steve Perry (author)|Steve Perry's]] Matador book series, and his novel ''The Musashi Flex'', the "Musashi Flex" is an illegal underground [[martial arts]] competition, named after Musashi.
* Musashi was the subject of ''Sword of the Samurai'' by [[Michael Reeves]] and Steve Perry from the [[Time Machine (book series)|Time Machine]] interactive book series.
* In the book ''[[The Ninja (novel)|The Ninja]]'' by [[Eric van Lustbader]] there are several references to Musashi and ''[[The Book of Five Rings]]''.
* In [[Chris Bradford]]'s [[Young Samurai]] series, Miyamoto Musashi was the basis for legendary samurai character [[Young Samurai: The Way of the Warrior#Characters|Masamoto Takeshi]].
* In the novel ''[[The Blade of the Courtesans]]'' by [[Keiichiro Ryu]], Musashi saved a baby named Matsunaga Seiichiro who is the imperial prince of Japan. As the boy grew up, he mentored him and taught him [[Niten Ichi-ryu]] in the mountains of Higo. When Seiichiro turned 26 years old, he was sent by Musashi to Edo to find Shoji Jin'emon in [[Yoshiwara]].
* In February 2013, Musashi appears in the [[Image comics]] series ''[[Five Ghosts (comics)|Five Ghosts]]'', written by Frank J. Barbiere with art by Chris Mooneyham. Musashi appears as a spirit who gives his skills to treasure hunter Fabian Gray. Musashi gives his skills along with four other spirits of unique talents, among them [[Merlin]], [[Robin Hood]], [[Sherlock Holmes]] and [[Count Dracula]].''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/08/07/five-ghosts-haunts-the-mainstream/]&lt;/ref&gt;
* David Kirk's novels ''Child of Vengeance''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Child of Vengeance|url = http://davidkirkfiction.com/child-of-vengeance|website = David Kirk - The Official Site of the Author|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2013) and ''Sword of Honor''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sword of Honour|url = http://davidkirkfiction.com/swordofhonour|website = David Kirk - The Official Site of the Author|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2015) are based on mostly historical events intertwined with legends about Musashi. The novels follow Musashi, a sickly and weak boy with eczema, who is not considered worthy by his father, [[Shinmen Munisai|Munisai]]. As he grows up, he receives training under his uncle [[Dorinbo]] in Buddhism and reading and writing, and later in the sword under his father Munisai. Musashi is described in the novels as an extremely tall man who has the advantage of reach and strength, who uses his environment and unconventional tactics to defeat multiple swordsmen at once.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Child of Vengeance|last = Kirk|first = David|publisher = Doubleday|year = 2013|isbn = 9780594563761|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sword of Honor|last = Kirk|first = David|publisher = Doubleday|year = 2015|isbn = 9780385536653|location = North America|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; After taking part in the [[Battle of Sekigahara]], Musashi abandons the ways of the samurai and develops a hatred for all samurai, deciding to go ronin. During his time as a masterless samurai, he is pursued by an adept swordsman, Akiyama, from the Yoshioka school, and later by the head of the Yoshioka school, Denshichiro.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the game, Musashi must obtain 5 legendary swords of earth, water, fire, wind, and void, vaguely representing the five rings. The main secondary weapon used, called the "Great Oar" is a take on the sword the real man created from an oar. He had this sword, in a turn of events leading up to fighting Gandrake (Kojiro).

In complement to this, Sasaki Kojiro was added as a playable character in ''Xtreme Legends'', the expansion to ''Samurai Warriors''.

== Cultural, educational and scientific-research work ==
Dražetin was the creator of the [[Correspondence Theatre]] ("Dopisno pozorište"), a specific type of theatre organization and play, which he conceived and organized in 1974 as the original theatrical movement for spread of elementary theater and ethical-aesthetic culture. He was among the founders of the [[Drama Art Scene]] ("Pozornica dramske umetnosti"), whose chief executive he was from 1994.

He showed the theatrical performances in the villages, city parks and squares, in companies, as well as in the apartments. TV show of [[Petar Ljubojev]] about this project received in 1986 the Grand Prix at the festival in [[Monte Carlo]]. Dražetin has directed over a hundred theatrical plays and recitals in amateur and professional scenes, within the Correspondence Theatre. He appeared as an actor in theatrical plays and in about ten films.

By his own script, he directed two films of silent burlesque: "Disordered thoughts" ("Rastrojene misli") (1971) and "Humorists from Novi Sad" ("Komičari iz Novog Sada") (1973). He also worked on poetry and has published seven collections of poems.

His social drama "Confession" ("Ispovest") (1972) and experimental comedy "Philosophy" ("Filozofija") (1976) were performed on professional and amateur scenes. He edited the newspaper of amateur theater "Stage" ("Pozornica") (from 1974) and the editions "Tribune of Poetry" ("Tribina poezije") (since 1981) and "Mass culture and art" ("Masovna kultura i umetnost") (since 1996), all within the publishing activity of The Drama Art Scene and The Correspondence Theatre. He was also a member of the editorial board of the magazine for culture and art titled "Krovovi" (published in [[Sremski Karlovci]]).

Besides that, he was a literary critic, theorist of theater and television. On television, he was author (director or screenwriter) of more acclaimed shows such as "Health theater" ("Zdravstveni teatar"), "75 years of Esperanto" ("75 godina Esperanta") and other.

Social drama "Confession" which Dražetin wrote was played in over fifty thousand micro - theaters of the Correspondence Theatre around the world, as an educational program.

He wrote a book on ethics, aesthetics and sociology of culture called "Eternal art of the play" ("Večna umetnost igre"), which is a result of his thirty years of scientific research and the choice of teaching material from lectures at universities, colleges and high schools, where his lectures from 1996 to 2013 were attended by more than ten thousand students.

Dražetin gave many notable lectures "On the establishment and operation of Correspondence Theatre from Novi Sad, as a universal correspondence system" ("O nastanku i delovanju Dopisnog pozorišta iz Novog Sada, kao univerzalnog korespondentnog sistema") in several countries - [[Russia]], [[Austria]], [[Slovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Romania]], [[Greece]], [[Croatia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Republika Srpska]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] and [[Montenegro]].

''Science &amp; Music'', p.62. Dover. {{ISBN|0-486-61964-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; density may be tested by using different strings]]

A '''monochord''', also known as '''sonometer''' (see [[#Sonometer|below]]), is an ancient [[Musical instrument|musical]] and scientific [[laboratory instrument]], involving one (mono) string ([[Chord (music)|Chord]]). The term ''monochord'' is sometimes used as the class-name for any musical stringed instrument having only one string and a stick shaped body, also known as [[musical bow]]s. According to the [[Hornbostel–Sachs]] system, string bows are bar zithers (311.1) while monochords are traditionally board zithers (314). The "harmonical canon", or monochord is, at its least, "merely a string having a [[fingerboard|board]] under it of exactly the same length, upon which may be delineated the points at which the string must be [[fingering (music)|stopped]] to give certain notes," allowing comparison.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Crotch (October 1, 1861). "[https://archive.org/stream/jstor-3355208/3355208#page/n1/mode/2up On the Derivation of the Scale, Tuning, Temperament, the Monochord, etc.]", ''The Musical Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[string (music)|string]] is fixed at both ends and stretched over a sound box. One or more movable [[bridge (instrument)|bridges]] are then manipulated to demonstrate mathematical relationships among the [[frequency|frequencies]] produced. "With its single string, movable bridge and [[graduation (instrument)|graduated]] [[ruler|rule]], the monochord (''kanōn'' [Greek: law]) straddled the gap between [[note (music)|notes]] and numbers, [[interval (music)|intervals]] and [[ratio]]s, sense-perception and mathematical reason."&lt;ref&gt;Creese, David (2010). ''The Monochord in Ancient Greek Harmonic Science'', p.vii. Cambridge. {{ISBN|9780521843249}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, "music, mathematics, and [[astronomy]] were [also] inexorably linked in the monochord."&lt;ref name="Alexandria"&gt;Terpstra, Siemen (1993). "An Introduction to the Monochord", ''Alexandria 2: The Journal of the Western Cosmological Traditions, Volume 2'', p.137-9. David Fideler, ed. Red Wheel/Weiser. {{ISBN|9780933999978}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a pedagogical tool for demonstrating mathematical relationships between intervals, the monochord remained in use throughout the middle ages.&lt;ref&gt;Its common use is attested to by illustrations such as this one from an 11th century Norman manuscript: "Hybride tenant un monocorde et chantant." Musiconis Database. Université Paris-Sorbonne. http://musiconis.huma-num.fr/fiche/304/Hybride+tenant+un+monocorde+et+chantant Accessed January 5, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The monochord can be used to illustrate the [[mathematics|mathematical]] properties of musical [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] and to illustrate [[Mersenne's laws]] regarding string length and tension: "essentially a tool for measuring musical intervals".&lt;ref name="Alexandria"/&gt; For example, when a monochord's string is open it vibrates at a particular frequency and produces a pitch. When the length of the string is halved, and [[Pizzicato|pluck]]ed, it produces a pitch an [[octave]] higher and the string vibrates at twice the frequency of the original (2:1) {{audio|Perfect octave on C.mid|Play}}. Half of this length will produce a pitch two octaves higher than the original—four times the initial frequency (4:1)—and so on.  Standard diatonic [[Pythagorean tuning]] (Ptolemy's Diatonic Ditonic) is easily derived starting from [[superparticular]] ratios, (n+1)/n, constructed from the first four counting numbers, the [[tetractys]], measured out on a monochord.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The mathematics involved include the [[multiplication table]], [[least common multiple]]s, and [[prime number|prime]] and [[composite number]]s.&lt;ref name="Alexandria"/&gt;

[[File:Monocordiopitagoras20060330.png|thumb|200px|Several string "monochord"]]

"As the name implies, only one string is needed to do the experiments; but, since ancient times, several strings were used, all tuned in exact unison, each with a moveable bridge, so that various intervals can be compared to each other [[consonance and dissonance|{{bracket|consonance and dissonance}}]]."&lt;ref name="Alexandria"/&gt; A "bichord instrument" is one, "having two strings in unison for each note [a [[course (music)|course]]]," such as the [[mandolin]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bichord Bichord]", ''Merriam-Webster.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; With two strings one can easily demonstrate how various musical [[interval (musical)|intervals]] sound. Both open strings are tuned to the same pitch, and then the movable bridge is put in a mathematical position on the second string to demonstrate, for instance, the [[major third]] (at 4/5th of the string length) {{audio|Just major third on C.mid|Play}} or the [[minor third]] (at 5/6th of the string length) {{audio|Just minor third on C.mid|Play}}.

Many contemporary composers focused on [[microtonality]] and [[just intonation]] such as [[Harry Partch]], [[Ivor Darreg]], [[Tony Conrad]], [[Glenn Branca]], [[Bart Hopkin]], and [[Yuri Landman]] constructed multistring variants of sonometers with movable bridges.

==Instruments==
&lt;!--[[Monopipe]] redirects directly to this section.--&gt;
[[File:MIM String Instruments.jpg|thumb|200px|Monochords]]

Parts of a monochord include a [[tuning peg]], [[nut (string instrument)|nut]], string, moveable bridge, fixed bridge, calibration marks, belly or [[resonator|resonating box]], and an [[end pin]].&lt;ref name="Alexandria"/&gt;

Instruments derived from the monochord (or its moveable bridge) include the [[guqin]], [[dan bau]], [[koto (instrument)|koto]], [[veena|vina]], [[hurdy-gurdy]], and [[clavichord]] ("hence all keyboard instruments").&lt;ref name="Alexandria"/&gt; A '''monopipe''' is the wind instrument version of a monochord; a variable open [[organ pipe|pipe]] which can produce variable [[pitch (music)|pitches]], a sliding cylinder with the numbers of the monochord marked.&lt;ref&gt;Barbour, J. Murray (2013). ''Tuning and Temperament: A Historical Survey'', p.xlviii. Dover/Courier. {{ISBN|9780486317359}}. Barbour uses quotes around "what might be called a 'monopipe'".&lt;/ref&gt; [[End correction]] must be used with this method, to achieve accuracy.

[[File:Boethius.jpeg|150px|thumb|Medieval drawing of the philosopher [[Boethius]]]]

The monochord is mentioned in [[Sumer]]ian writings, and, according to some, was reinvented by [[Pythagoras]] (sixth century BCE).&lt;ref name="Alexandria"/&gt; Dolge attributes the invention of the moveable bridge to [[Guido of Arezzo]] around 1000 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Dolge, Alfred (1911). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=O0ALAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=monochord&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjk2-advNHMAhUB42MKHSv6Cv8Q6AEIJTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=monochord&amp;f=false Pianos and Their Makers Volume 1: A comprehensive history of the development of the piano from the monochord to the concert grand player piano]'', p.28. Covina. {{pre-ISBN}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1618, [[Robert Fludd]] devised a '''mundane monochord''' (also '''celestial''' or '''divine monochord''') that linked the [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic]] universe to musical intervals. "Was it [Mersenne's discoveries through use of the monochord (1637)] physical intuition or a Pythagorean confidence in the importance of small whole numbers? ... It was the latter."&lt;ref name="Gozza"&gt;Gozza, Paolo; ed. (2013). ''Number to Sound: The Musical Way to the Scientific Revolution'', p.279. Springer. {{ISBN|9789401595780}}. Gozza is referring to statements by Sigalia Dostrovsky's "Early Vibration Theory", p.185-187.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[psalmodicon]], a similar instrument but with a chromatic fret board replacing the moveable bridge, was developed in Denmark in the 1820s and became widespread throughout Scandinavia in churches as an alternative to the organ. Scandinavian immigrants also brought it to the United States. It became quite rare by the latter 20th century, but more recently has been revived by folk musicians.

An image of the celestial monochord was used on the 1952 cover of ''[[Anthology of American Folk Music]]'' by [[Harry Everett Smith]] and in the 1977 book ''The Cosmographical Glass: Renaissance Diagrams of the Universe'' (p.&amp;nbsp;133) by [[S. K. Heninger, Jr.]], {{ISBN|978-0-87328-208-6}}. A reproduction of the '''monochordum mundanum''' ('''mundane monochord''') illustration from page 90 of Robert Fludd's "Utriusque Cosmi, Maioris scilicet et Minoris, Metaphysica, Physica, Atque Technica Historia" ("Tomus Primus"), 1617, was used as the cover art for Kepler Quartet's 2011 audio CD, ''[[Ben Johnston (composer)|Ben Johnston]]: String Quartets Nos. 1, 5 &amp; 10'' ([[New World Records]] Cat. No. 80693), which is classical music that uses pitch ratios extended to higher partials beyond the standard Pythagorean tuning system.

A modern playing technique used in [[experimental rock]] as well as [[contemporary classical music]] is [[3rd bridge]]. This technique shares the same mechanism as used on the monochord, by dividing the string into two sections with an additional bridge.

==Sonometer==
&lt;!--[[Sonometer]] redirects directly here.--&gt;
[[File:Monochord3.png|thumb|Monochord]]

A sonometer is a diagnostic instrument used to measure the tension, frequency or density of vibrations. They are used in medical settings to test both hearing and bone density. A sonometer, or audiometer, is used to determine hearing sensitivity, while a clinical bone sonometer measures bone density to help determine such conditions as the risk of osteoporosis.

In audiology, the device is used to test for hearing loss and other disorders of the ear. The audiometer measures the ability to hear sounds at frequencies normally detectable by the human ear. Several test are usually conducted using the audiometer which will then be used to assess hearing ability. Results typically are recorded on a chart known as an audiogram.

A clinical bone sonometer, approved for use in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration in 1998, is a device which tests for the risk of bone fractures associated with osteoporosis. This test, called an ultrasound bone densitometry screening, is not typically used for diagnostic purposes; it is generally used as a risk assessment tool. Testing is often recommended for those whose personal history and lifestyle choices indicate a possible high risk for osteoporosis.  Testing is usually conducted by an orthopedist, rheumatologist or neurologist specializing in the treatment of osteoporosis. The patient simply places his or her heel in the sonometer, and it is then scanned using ultrasound to determine bone density. This is a fast and low-cost procedure generally lasting 30 seconds or less.  Results typically are available immediately following the procedure. Two score results are possible: a T-score, which compares a patient's scan against that of a young person of the same gender; and a Z-score, which compares the scan against someone of similar age, weight and gender. The T-scores results are used to assess the risk of osteoporosis. A score above -1 indicates a low risk for osteoporosis; below -1 to -2.5 indicates a risk of developing osteoporosis; and a score below -2.5 indicates more intensive testing should be performed and that osteoporosis is likely present. The Z-score reports how much bone the patient has as compared to others his age. If this number is high or low, further testing may be ordered.

His given name was '''Ikcheom''' (익첨 益瞻), his [[courtesy name]] was '''Ilsin'''(일신 日新), and his pennames were '''Saeun''' (사은 思隱) and '''Samudang'''(삼우당 三憂堂).

==History==
Mun Ikjeom was born in Gangseong village (강성현) in 1329. His father was Moon Sook-sun (문숙선 文淑宣), who had passed the [[gwageo|civil service examination]] but did not work for the government. Ik-chom started working for the government as a historical recorder in 1360. In 1363, he went to [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan China]] as an ambassador for cultural exchange. On the way back to Korea he put [[cottonseed]] in his writing brush cap to bring it secretly into Korea. In 1364, he went back to his home town [[Jinju]] to spread the seed and successfully grew one of the seeds he had brought back and continued to grow the number of plants significantly. Within ten years, Korea was able to produce [[cotton]] and was able to distribute it to the citizens. He died in 1398.

The '''NIA''' Technique is a mind/body physical conditioning program that initially stood for Non-Impact Aerobics, a health and fitness alternative that emerged in the '80's, and evolved to include neurological integrative practices and teachings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vitalitylink.com/modality-NIA-previously-Non-Impact-Aerobics,-Neuromuscular-Integrative-Action-353 Vitality Link.com, "Neuromuscular Integrative Action"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healersworldwide.com/article/what-is-nia-neuromuscular-integrative-action/ Healers Worldwide, "What is NIA"]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Nia Technique was founded in 1983 by Debbie Rosas and Carlos AyaRosas in the San Francisco area. Nia combines martial arts, modern dance arts and yoga in a workout set to music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inwardboundadventures.com/nia.html Inward Bound Adventures, "What is NIA?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
From 1972 to 1983 Debbie Rosas operated an exercise business in the San Francisco Bay Area known as the Bod Squad.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=KGEEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA77&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;dq=Debbie+Rosas+Bod+Squad&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=R9jlYs4YQE&amp;sig=J11rgo3t2m_7Wir_WDXHVclgMhU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hgPNVIawA4mtU6eegqgO&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Debbie%20Rosas%20Bod%20Squad&amp;f=false Working Mother Magazine, Nov 1986, "Low-Impact Aerobics"]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1983 a series of sports related injuries prompted her to research and develop an alternative method of [[aerobic exercise]] and [[strength training]] aiming for safe, non-impact, [[bodymind]] based movement.

This led to the establishment of the Nia Technique.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nexuspub.com/articles_2006/interview_nia_06_jf.php Nexus Colorado Interview Jan/Feb 2006 "A Moving Story: Interview with Carlos Rosas and Debbie Rosas"]&lt;/ref&gt; Nia Technique headquarters moved to Portland, Oregon in 1991 and is currently overseen by Debbie Rosas, CEO.

== Nia Technique ==
Nia dance cardio fitness classes are taught by instructors licensed in the  Nia Technique.  Each class includes mindful movement guidance and [[Somatosensory system|somatic]] education; class cycles include warm-up, sustained non-impact aerobic conditioning, [[strength training]], cool down and stretching.  Nia Fitness classes are taught to music, including [[Pop music|pop]], [[electronica]], [[jazz]], [[Latin music (genre)|Latin]], [[New Age]], [[Indian music|Indian]] and [[hip hop]]. They employ 52 basic movements and techniques that draw on a combination of Jazz, Modern and [[Duncan Dance]] styles, [[Tai Chi]], [[TaeKwonDo]] and [[Aikido]]; and the [[bodymind]] [[healing arts]] of [[Feldenkrais Method]], [[Alexander Technique]] and [[Yoga]].

K. |year=2005 |title=Young Women's Dating Behavior: Why/Why Not Date a Nice Guy? |journal=Sex Roles |volume=53 |issue=5–6 |pages=347–359 |doi=10.1007/s11199-005-6758-z }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used both positively and negatively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://divalion.livejournal.com/163615.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117015253/http://divalion.livejournal.com/163615.html |archivedate=2013-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When used positively, and particularly when used as a preference or description by someone else, it is intended to imply a male who puts the needs of others before his own, avoids confrontations, does favors, gives emotional support, tries to stay out of trouble, and generally acts nicely towards others.&lt;ref&gt;Glover, Dr. Robert, http://nomoremrniceguy.com&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of a relationship, it may also refer to traits of honesty, loyalty, romanticism, courtesy, and respect. When used negatively, a nice guy implies a male who is unassertive, does not express his true feelings and, in the context of dating (in which the term is often used&lt;ref name="McDaniel" /&gt;), dishonestly uses acts of [[Wiktionary:ostensible#English|ostensible]] friendship and basic social etiquette with the unstated aim of progressing to a romantic or sexual relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.berkeleybeacon.com/opinion/2014/4/2/when-nice-guys-are-sexist-with-a-smile | title=When nice guys are sexist with a smile | publisher=Berkeley Beacon | date=2 April 2014 | accessdate=2014-12-09 | author=Blomquist, Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="maneater"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dasgupta|first1=Rivu|title=The Friend Zone is Sexist|url=http://www.themaneater.com/stories/2014/2/13/friend-zone-sexist/|website=The Maneater|accessdate=2014-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research on female preferences==
The results of the research on romantic perception of "nice guys" are mixed and often inconsistent. Herold &amp; Milhausen conclude: "The answer to the question 'Do nice guys finish last?' is complicated in that it is influenced both by the measurement instruments used and by subject characteristics."&lt;ref name="Herold98"&gt;Herold and Milhausen, 1998{{full citation needed|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies that explicitly use the term "nice guy" sometimes cite research that does not directly use the term, but which addresses behaviours which are often associated with disingenuous "niceness".{{clarifyme|date=May 2018}}{{fact|date=May 2018}}

===The "nice guy" construct===
One difficulty in studying the "nice guy" phenomenon is due to the ambiguity of the "nice guy" construct. Participants in studies interpret "nice guy" to mean different things.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

In their qualitative analysis, Herold and Milhausen&lt;ref name="Herold98"/&gt; found that women associate different qualities with the "nice guy" label: "Some women offered flattering interpretations of the 'nice guy', characterizing him as committed, caring, and respectful of women. Some women, however, emphasized more negative aspects, considering the 'nice guy' to be boring, lacking confidence, and unattractive."{{fact|date=May 2018}} The "jerks" were also divided into two categories, "as either confident, attractive, sexy, and exciting or as manipulative, unfaithful, disrespectful of women, and interested only in sex."{{elucidate|reason=Seems like an important distinction. What differences in the research results can be distinguished between such categories?|date=March 2014}}{{fact|date=May 2018}}

Researchers have therefore [[operationalize]]d the "nice guy" and "jerk" constructs in different ways, some of which are outlined below.&lt;ref name="McDaniel"/&gt;

===Results of research===
Various studies explicitly try to elucidate the success, or lack thereof, of "nice guys" with women.&lt;ref name="McDaniel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Herold98"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Urbaniak03"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jensen-Campbell |first=L. A. |last2=Graziano |first2=W. G. |last3=West |first3=S. G. |year=1995 |title=Dominance, prosocial orientation, and female preferences: Do nice guys really finish last? |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=427–440 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.68.3.427 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Jensen-Campbell et al. (1995) operationalized "niceness" as [[prosocial behavior]], which included [[agreeableness]] and [[altruism]]. They found that female attraction was a result of an interaction of ''both'' dominance and prosocial tendency. They suggest that altruism may be attractive to women when it is perceived as a form of [[agentic]] behavior.
* Herold and [[Robin Milhausen|Milhausen]] (1998) asked a sample of undergraduate women "You meet two men. One, John, is nice but somewhat shy. He has not had any sexual experience. The other, Mike, is attractive, a lot of fun, and has had intercourse with ten women. Both wish to date you. Whom do you choose?" 54% reported a preference for "John", 18% preferred "Mike", and the rest had no preference.
* Urbaniak and Killman (2003) constructed vignettes of four hypothetical dating show contestants: "Nice Todd" vs. "Neutral Todd" vs. "Jerk Todd" vs. "Michael", who was created to be a control. "Nice Todd" described a "real man" as "in touch with his feelings", kind and attentive, non-macho, and interested in putting his partner's pleasure first. "Neutral Todd" described a "real man" as someone who "knows what he wants and knows how to get it", and who is good to the woman he loves. "Jerk Todd" described a "real man" as someone who "knows what he wants and knows how to get it", who keeps everyone else on their toes, and avoids "touch-feely" stuff. "Michael" described a "real man" as relaxed and positive. In two studies, Urbaniak and Kilmann found that women claimed to prefer "Nice Todd" over "Neutral Todd" and "Jerk Todd", relative to "Michael" even at differing levels of [[physical attractiveness]]. They also found that for purely sexual relationships, "niceness appeared relatively less influential than physical attractiveness." After acknowledging that women's preference for "niceness" could be inflated by the [[social desirability bias]], especially due to their use of verbal scripts, they conclude that "our overall results did not favor the nice guy stereotype."
* McDaniel (2005) constructed vignettes of dates with a stereotypical "nice guy" vs. a stereotypical "fun/sexy guy", and attempted to make them both sound positive. Participants reported a greater likelihood of wanting a second date with the "nice guy" rather than with the "fun/sexy guy".
* A study at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces (2008) showed that "nice guys" report to have significantly fewer sexual partners than "bad boys".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=5197531&amp;page=1 |work=ABC News |title=Why Nice Guys Finish Last |date=19 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19826614.100-bad-guys-really-do-get-the-most-girls.html |work=New Scientist |title=Bad guys really do get the most girls |date=18 June 2008 |first=Mason |last=Inman }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Barclay (2010) found that when all other factors are held constant, guys who perform generous acts are rated as being more desirable for dates and long-term relationships than non-generous guys. This study used a series of matched descriptions where each male was presented in a generous or a control version which differed only whether the man tended to help others. The author suggests that niceness itself is desirable to women, but tends to be used by men who are less attractive in other domains, and this is what creates the appearance of "nice guys finish last".&lt;ref&gt;Barclay, P. 2010. Altruism as a courtship display: some effects of third-party generosity on audience perceptions. British Journal of Psychology, 101, 123-135.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Judge ''et al'' (2011) concluded that "Nice guys do not necessarily finish last, but they do finish a distant second in terms of earnings ... yet, seen from the perspective of gender equity, even the nice guys seem to be making out quite well relative to either agreeable or disagreeable women".&lt;ref&gt;Judge, Timothy A.; Livingston, Beth A.; Hurst, Charlice, "Do nice guys—and gals—really finish last? The joint effects of sex and agreeableness on income", ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 28 November 2011 ([http://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/a0026021 abstract] | [http://nd.edu/~cba/Nice--JPSPInPress.pdf full text] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215114230/http://www.nd.edu/~cba/Nice--JPSPInPress.pdf |date=15 December 2011 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

These studies also cite other research on heterosexual attraction that does not mention the "nice guy" term. They interpret various studies on female attraction to various traits in men (e.g., [[dominance (ethology)|dominance]], [[agreeableness]], physical attractiveness, [[wealth]], etc.), and on the sexual success of men with different personality traits, to shed light on the "nice guy" phenomenon.
* Sadalla, Kenrick, and Vershure (1985)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sadalla |first=E. K. |last2=Kenrick |first2=D. T. |last3=Venshure |first3=B. |year=1987 |title=Dominance and heterosexual attraction |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=730–738 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.52.4.730 }}&lt;/ref&gt; found that women were sexually attracted to dominance in men (though dominance did not make men likable to women), and that dominance in women had no effect on men.
* Bogaert and Fisher (1995)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bogaert |first=A. F. |last2=Fisher |first2=W. A. |year=1995 |title=Predictors of university men's number of sexual partners |journal=Journal of Sex Research |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=119–130 |jstor=3812964 |doi=10.1080/00224499509551782}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied the relationships between the personalities of university men and their number of sexual partners. They found a correlation between a man's number of sexual partners, and the traits of [[sensation-seeking]], [[hypermasculinity]], physical attractiveness, and [[testosterone]] levels. They also discovered a correlation between maximum monthly number of partners, and the traits of dominance and [[psychoticism]]. Bogaert and Fisher suggest that an underlying construct labelled "[[disinhibition]]" could be used to explain most of these differences. They suggest that disinhibition would correlate negatively with "agreeableness" and "[[conscientiousness]]" from the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five personality model]].
* Botwin, Buss and Shackelford (1997)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Botwin |first=M. D. |last2=Buss |first2=D. M. |last3=Shackelford |first3=T. K. |year=1997 |title=Personality and mate preferences: Five factors in mate selection and marital satisfaction |journal=Journal of Personality |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=107–136 |doi= 10.1111/j.1467-6494.1997.tb00531.x|pmid=9143146 }}&lt;/ref&gt; found that women had a higher preference for [[surgency]] and dominance in their mates than men did, in a study of dating couples and newlyweds.

==Other viewpoints==
A number of viewpoints have arisen in popular culture that revolve around the concept of the "nice guy", irrespective of the preceding research.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

===The "nice guys finish last" view===
A common [[aphorism]] is that "[[wikt:nice guys finish last|nice guys finish last]]."&lt;ref name="Urbaniak03"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Urbaniak |first=G. C. |last2=Kilmann |first2=P. R. |year=2003 |title=Physical attractiveness and the 'nice guy paradox:' Do nice guys really finish last |journal=Sex Roles |volume=49 |issue=9–10 |pages=413–426 |doi=10.1023/A:1025894203368 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase is based on a quote by [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] manager [[Leo Durocher]] in 1946, which was then condensed by journalists.&lt;ref name=yale&gt;''The Yale Book of Quotations,'' Fred R. Shapiro, Yale University Press, 2006, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ck6bXqt5shkC&amp;pg=PA221&amp;dq=%22nice+guys+finish+last%22 p. 221]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/bulletin_board/30/messages/1838.html|title="Nice guys finish last" - phrase meaning and origin|website=www.phrases.org.uk|accessdate=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original quote by Durocher, referring to the Dodgers' bitter rivals, the [[History of the New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]], was, "The nice guys are all over there, in seventh place." (1946 July 6),&lt;ref name=yale/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''N.Y. Journal American,'' 1946 July 7&lt;/ref&gt; about the [[w:1946 New York Giants (MLB) season|1946 New York Giants]] – seventh place was actually ''second-to-last'' place in the National League; many variants appear in later works,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boller, Jr. |first=Paul F. |author2=George, John  |title=They Never Said It: A Book of Fake Quotes, Misquotes, and Misleading Attributions |year=1989 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-19-505541-1}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--p. 24--&gt; including Durocher's autobiography, ''Nice Guys Finish Last''.&lt;ref&gt;''Nice Guys Finish Last,'' by Leo Durocher, with Ed Linn, Simon &amp; Schuster, 1975, renders it as "Take a look at them. All nice guys. They’ll finish last. Nice guys – finish last."&lt;/ref&gt;  The Giants would finish the 1946 season in the National League cellar, while Durocher's Dodgers would end up in second place.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

Though this is the origin of the phrase, Durocher's remark was specific to the context of baseball, and indeed to the context of that set of players, rather than intended as generally applicable to male/female relationship dynamics or in any other context and his allegation of a cause-and-effect relationship between being nice and finishing last was at most merely implicit – it can also be interpreted as "Nice guys, but they will finish last", rather than "all nice guys finish last".{{fact|date=May 2018}}

Simplistically, the term "nice guy" could be an adjectival phrase describing what appears to be a friendly, kind, or courteous man. The "nice guys finish last" phrase is also said to be coined by American biologist [[Garrett Hardin]] to sum up the [[selfish gene theory]] of life and evolution. This was disputed by [[Richard Dawkins]], who wrote the book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]''. Dawkins was misinterpreted by many as confirming the "nice guy finishing last" view, but refuted the claims in the [[BBC]] documentary ''[[Nice Guys Finish First]]''.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

The "nice guys finish last" view is that there is a discrepancy between women's stated preferences and their actual choices in men. In other words, women say that they want nice guys, but really go for men who are "jerks" or "[[bad boy (archetype)|bad boys]]" in the end. Stephan Desrochers claims, in a 1995 article in the journal ''Sex Roles'', that many "sensitive" men, based on personal experience, do not believe women actually want "nice guys".&lt;ref name="Desrochers"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Desrochers |first=Stephan |year=1995 |title=What types of men are most attractive and most repulsive to women |journal=Sex Roles |volume=32 |issue=5–6 |pages=375–391 |doi=10.1007/BF01544603 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to McDaniel, popular culture and dating advice: "...suggest that women claim they want a 'nice guy' because they believe that is what is expected of them when, in reality, they want the so-called 'challenge' that comes with dating a not-so-nice guy."&lt;ref name="McDaniel"/&gt;

Urbaniak &amp; Kilmann write that:
{{quote|"Although women often portray themselves as wanting to date kind, sensitive, and emotionally expressive men, the nice guy stereotype contends that, when actually presented with a choice between such a 'nice guy' and an unkind, insensitive, emotionally-closed, 'macho man' or 'jerk,' they invariably reject the nice guy in favor of his 'so-called' macho competitor."&lt;ref name="Urbaniak03"/&gt;}}

Another perspective is that women do want "nice guys," at least when they are looking for a romantic relationship. Desrochers (1995) suggests that "it still seems popular to believe that women in contemporary America prefer men who are 'sensitive,' or have feminine personality traits." Women have differing opinions about whether "nice guys finish last" sexually or not.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

Herold and [[Robin Milhausen|Milhausen]]&lt;ref name="Herold99"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Herold |first1=Edward S. |last2= Milhausen |first2= Robin R. |year=1999 |title=Dating preferences of university women: an analysis of the nice guy stereotype. |journal= Journal of sex &amp; marital therapy|volume= 25|issue=4 |pages=333–343 |doi= 10.1080/00926239908404010| ISSN=0092-623X}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that 56% of 165 university women claimed to agree with the statement: "You may have heard the expression, 'Nice guys finish last.' In terms of dating, and sex, do you think women are less likely to have sex with men who are 'nice' than men who are 'not nice'?" A third view is that while "nice guys" may not be as successful at attracting women sexually, they may be sought after by women looking for long-term romantic relationships (however, "nice guys need not lose all hope, with studies showing that while women like 'bad boys' for flings, they tend to settle down with more caring types" – the "bad boys" tending to exhibit the [[dark triad]], i.e., "the self-obsession of [[narcissism]], the impulsive, thrill-seeking and callous behaviour of the psychopath and the deceitful and exploitative nature of Machiavellianism". It is a possibility that women leave to escape their circumstances of abuse, disease or pregnancy to seek a chance with the nice guy (they rejected previously), afterwards.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Herold and Milhausen claim: "While 'nice guys' may not be competitive in terms of numbers of sexual partners, they tend to be more successful with respect to longer-term, committed relationships."&lt;ref name="Herold99"/&gt;

Another study indicates that "for brief affairs, women tend to prefer a dominating, powerful and promiscuous man." Further evidence appears in a 2005 study in Prague: "Since women can always get a man for a one-night stand, they gain an advantage if they find partners for child-rearing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2005/08/07/INGJ9E31DH1.DTL |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |title=Why women cheat / Birds stray the nest and so do many of our human females |first=Matt |last=Reynolds |date=7 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Nice Guy" syndrome===
The terms "Nice Guy" and "nice guy syndrome" can be used to describe a man who views himself as a prototypical "nice guy," but whose "nice deeds" are deemed to be solely motivated by a desire to court women. From said courting, the 'nice guy' may hope to form a romantic relationship or may be motivated by a simple desire to increase his sexual activity. The results of failure are often resentment toward women and/or society. The 'nice guy' is commonly said to be put by women "into the [[friend zone]]" who do not reciprocate his romantic or sexual interest. Third wave feminist interpretations tend to see this resentment as being based upon an assumption by men that they are entitled to sex and are therefore confused when they find that it is not forthcoming despite their supposed 'niceness'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feministcritics.org/blog/2010/01/04/do-nice-guys-finish-last-rp/Do|title=Do 27% of Europeans say rape may be acceptable in some circumstances?|date=30 November 2016|publisher=|accessdate=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; More male orientated interpretations claim that the resentment is down to the fact that society, and the vast majority of people in spoken conversation, claim to be attracted to traits such as honesty, integrity and kindness, when in reality more superficial considerations trigger attraction. According to this interpretation people who display wealth, good looks, dominance and confidence tend to succeed more in romance than do 'nice guys'. Nice guys are therefore resentful at the inconsistency between what people claim to be attracted to and by how they act in reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feministe.us/blog/archives/2011/09/20/what-romantic-comedies-can-teach-us-about-ourselves/|title=What romantic comedies can teach us about ourselves – Feministe|website=www.feministe.us|accessdate=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.feministing.com/2011/11/13/regarding-nice-guys-and-why-women-only-date-jerks-a-critique-of-a-masculine-victim-cult/|title=Regarding ‘Nice Guys’ and ‘Why Women Only Date Jerks’- A Critique of a Masculine Victim-Cult|publisher=|accessdate=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
In early 2002, the web site [[Heartless Bitches International]] (HBI)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Whittaker |first=Jason |title=The cyberspace handbook |publisher=Routledge |year=2004 |pages=186–187 |isbn=0-415-16835-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ulp37hq8FKIC&amp;pg=RA1-PA187 |accessdate=2009-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; published several "rants" on the concept of the Nice Guy. The central theme was that a genuinely nice male is desirable, but that many Nice Guys are insecure men unwilling to articulate their romantic or sexual feelings directly. Instead, they choose to present themselves as their paramour's friend, and hang around, doing nice things for her in hopes that she will pick up on their desire for her. If she fails to read their secret feelings, Nice Guys become embittered and blame her for taking advantage of them and their niceness. The site is particularly critical of what they see as hypocrisy and manipulation on the part of self-professed Nice Guys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heartless-bitches.com/rants/niceguys/niceguys.shtml|title=Heartless Bitches International - Why "Nice Guys" are often such LOSERS|website=www.heartless-bitches.com|accessdate=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heartless-bitches.com/rants/niceguys/nice2.shtml|title=Heartless Bitches International - Nice guys we can do without|website=www.heartless-bitches.com|accessdate=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jordan Peterson]] has also expressed criticism towards the Nice Guy concept, generally from the perspectives of the [[Involuntary celibacy|incel]] and [[Red pill movement|red pill]] movements.&lt;ref&gt;https://theoutline.com/post/3537/alt-right-recruiters-have-infiltrated-the-online-depression-community?zd=3&amp;zi=jjkx4in3&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2451">'''Luis Felipe Cires Moyano Roca''' (28 October 1946 — 7 May 1996), better known as '''Nimrod de Rosario''', was an [[Argentine]] [[esotericist]] and writer. He called the system of [[gnostic]] philosophy presented in his works "[[Hyperborean]] Wisdom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hyperborean Wisdom of Nimrod de Rosario and Gnostic Geopolitics|url=https://www.geopolitica.ru/en/article/hyperborean-wisdom-nimrod-de-rosario-and-gnostic-geopolitics|accessdate=July 19, 2017|work=Geopolitica|date=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the founder of an esoteric order known as the ''Orden de Caballeros Tirodal de la República Argentina'' (OCTRA). Moyano's most notable works are ''The Mystery of Belicena Villca'' and the ''Foundations of Hyperborean Wisdom.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gnostic Fragments|url=https://www.theforbiddenreligion.com/gnosticfragments.htm/|accessdate=July 19, 2017|work=Primordial Gnosis: The Forbidden Religion|date=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moyano was influenced considerably by the work of the Colombian gnostic [[Samael Aun Weor]] and in turn influenced his fellow Latin American, [[Miguel Serrano]]. While there are some references to [[National Socialism]] in his writings, Moyano was not as explicitly or centrally identified with such themes as the more notorious Serrano. However, Moyano was still controversial enough that his meetings with [[Carlos Menem]], a Peronist who was [[President of Argentina]] during the 1990s, still caused a stir.

'''Psychosynthesis''' is an approach to psychology that was developed by Italian psychiatrist, [[Roberto Assagioli]]. He compared psychosynthesis to the prevailing thinking of the day, contrasting psychosynthesis for example with [[existential psychology]], but unlike the latter considered loneliness not to be "either ultimate or essential".&lt;ref name="Assagioli, R. 1965 p.5"&gt;Assagioli, R. (1965). Psychosynthesis, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; Assagioli asserted that "the direct experience of the self, of pure ''self-awareness''... – is true."&lt;ref name="Assagioli, R. 1965 p.5"/&gt; Spiritual goals of "self-realization" and the "interindividual psychosynthesis" – of 'social integration...the harmonious integration of the individual into ever larger groups up to the "one humanity"'&lt;ref&gt;Assaglioli, R. (1993). Psychosynthesis, p. 7 and p.5&lt;/ref&gt; – were central to Assagioli's theory.&lt;ref name="Assagioli, R. 1965 p.5"/&gt; Psychosynthesis was not intended to be a school of thought or an exclusive method&lt;ref&gt;''A Psychology with a Soul: Psychosynthesis in Evolutionary Context'' by Jean Hardy, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; but many conferences and publications had it as a central theme and centres were formed in Italy and the United States in the 1960s.

Psychosynthesis departed from the empirical foundations of psychology in that it studied a person as a personality and a soul&lt;ref&gt;''A Psychology with a Soul: Psychosynthesis in Evolutionary Context'' by Jean Hardy, p.21.&lt;/ref&gt; but Assagioli continued to insist that it was scientific.
He developed therapeutic methods beyond those found in psychoanalysis. Although the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] is an important part of his theory, Assagioli was careful to maintain a balance with rational, conscious therapeutical work.

Assagioli was not the first to use the term "psychosynthesis". The earliest was by [[James Jackson Putnam]], who used it as the name of his [[electroconvulsive therapy]]. The term was also used by [[C. G. Jung]] and [[A. R. Orage]], who were both far closer to Assagioli's thinking than Putnam. C. G. Jung had written, comparing his goals to those of [[Sigmund Freud]], "If there is a 'psychoanalysis' there must also be a 'psychosynthesis which creates future events according to the same laws'."&lt;ref&gt;Jung quoted in J. Kerr, ''A Dangerous Method'' (2012) pp. 214-5.&lt;/ref&gt; A. R. Orage, who was publisher of the influential [[The New Age]] journal, also made use of the term, which he hyphenated as psycho-synthesis. Orage formed an early psychology study group (which included [[Maurice Nicoll]] who later studied with Carl Jung) and concluded that what humanity needed was not psychoanalysis, but psycho-synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;A. R. Orage: On Love/Psychological Exercises: With Some Aphorisms &amp; Other Essays, p.126&lt;/ref&gt;  The term was also employed by Bezzoli.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psykosyntese.dk/a-146/ Roberto Assagioli - his life and work] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/69WMBskaT?url=http://www.psykosyntese.dk/a-146/ |date=2012-07-29 }} A biography from Kentaur Institute in Denmark&lt;/ref&gt; Freud, however, was opposed to what he saw as the directive element in Jung's approach to psychosynthesis,&lt;ref&gt;J. Kerr, ''A Dangerous Method'' (2012) p. 489.&lt;/ref&gt; and argued for a spontaneous synthesis on the patient's part: "As we analyse...the great unity which we call his ego fits into itself all the instinctual impulses which before had been split off and held apart from it. The psycho-synthesis is thus achieved in analytic treatment without our intervention, automatically and inevitably."&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, "Lines of Advance in Psycho-Analytic Therapy" [1918] in Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 2003) p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==

In 1909, [[C.G. Jung]] wrote to [[Sigmund Freud]] of "a very pleasant and perhaps valuable acquaintance, our first Italian, a Dr. Assagioli from the psychiatric clinic in Florence".&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, William, ed. (1974). The Freud/Jung Letters. Vol. XCIV, Bollingen Series. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press. p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; Later however, this same [[Roberto Assagioli]] (1888–1974) wrote a doctoral dissertation, "La Psicosintesi," in which he began to move away from Freud's [[psychoanalysis]] towards what he called psychosynthesis:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A beginning of my conception of psychosynthesis was contained in my doctoral thesis on Psychoanalysis (1910), in which I pointed out what I considered to be some of the limitations of Freud's views.&lt;ref&gt;Assagioli, R. (1965). Psychosynthesis, p.280&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In developing psychosynthesis, Assagioli agreed with Freud that healing childhood trauma and developing a healthy ego were necessary aims of psychotherapy, but held that human growth could not be limited to this alone. A student of philosophical and spiritual traditions of both East and West, Assagioli sought to address human growth as it proceeded beyond the norm of the well-functioning ego; he wished also to support the blossoming of human potential into what [[Abraham Maslow]]&lt;ref&gt;Maslow, Abraham. (1962). Toward a Psychology of Being. Princeton, N.J.: D. Van Nostrand Company, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; later termed [[self-actualization]], and further still, into the spiritual or transpersonal dimensions of human experience as well.

Assagioli envisioned an approach to the human being which could address both the process of personal growth—of personality integration and self-actualization—as well as transpersonal development—that dimension glimpsed for example in [[peak experiences]] (Maslow) of inspired creativity, spiritual insight, and unitive states of consciousness.  In addition, psychosynthesis recognizes the process of Self-realization, of contact and response with one's deepest callings and directions in life, which can involve either or both personal and transpersonal development.

Psychosynthesis is therefore one of the earliest forerunners of both [[humanistic psychology]] and [[transpersonal psychology]], even preceding Jung's break with Freud by several years. Assagioli's conception has an affinity with existential-humanistic psychology and other approaches which attempt to understand the nature of the healthy personality, personal responsibility and choice, and the actualization of the personal self; similarly, his conception is related to the field of transpersonal psychology, with its focus on higher states of consciousness, spirituality, and human experiencing beyond the individual self. Accordingly, Assagioli served on the board of editors for both the ''Journal of Humanistic Psychology'' and the ''Journal of Transpersonal Psychology''.

Assagioli presents the two major theoretical models in his seminal book, ''Psychosynthesis'',&lt;ref&gt;Assagioli, R. (1965). ''Psychosynthesis''. New York: The Viking Press.&lt;/ref&gt; models that have remained fundamental to psychosynthesis theory and practice through the years. These two models are 1) a diagram and description of the human person, and the other 2) a stage theory of the process of psychosynthesis (see below).

==Aims==
In ''Psychosomatic Medicine and Bio-psychosynthesis'', Assagioli states that the principal aims and tasks of psychosynthesis are:

# the elimination of the conflicts and obstacles, conscious and unconscious, that block [the complete and harmonious development of the human personality]
# the use of active techniques to stimulate the psychic functions still weak and immature.&lt;ref&gt;http://two.not2.org/psychosynthesis/articles/PsychosomaticMedicine.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In his major book, ''Psychosynthesis: A Collection of Basic Writings'' (1965), Assagioli writes of three aims of psychosynthesis:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Let us examine whether and how it is possible to solve this central problem of human life, to heal this fundamental infirmity of man. Let us see how he may free himself from this enslavement and achieve an harmonious inner integration, true Self-realization, and right relationships with others. (p. 21)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Lower unconscious===
For Assagioli, 'the lower unconscious, which contains one's personal psychological past in the form of repressed complexes, long-forgotten memories and dreams and imaginations',&lt;ref&gt;William Stewart, ''An A-Z of Counselling Theory and Practice'' (2005) p. 386&lt;/ref&gt; stood at the base of the diagram of the mind.

The lower unconscious is that realm of the person to which is relegated the experiences of shame, fear, pain, despair, and rage associated with primal wounding suffered in life. One way to think of the lower unconscious is that it is a particular bandwidth of one's experiential range that has been broken away from consciousness. It comprises that range of experience related to the threat of personal annihilation, of destruction of self, of nonbeing, and more generally, of the painful side of the human condition. As long as this range of experience remains unconscious, the person will have a limited ability to be empathic with self or others in the more painful aspects of human life.

At the same time, 'the lower unconscious merely represents the most primitive part of ourselves...It is not ''bad'', it is just ''earlier'' '.&lt;ref&gt;Pierro Ferrucci, ''What We May Be: The Vision and Techniques of Psychosynthesis'' (London 1990) p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, 'the "lower" side has many attractions and great vitality', and – as with Freud's [[Id, ego, and super-ego|id]], or Jung's [[shadow (psychology)|shadow]] – the conscious goal must be to 'achieve a creative tension'&lt;ref&gt;Ferrucci, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; with the lower unconscious.

===Middle unconscious===
The middle unconscious is a sector of the person whose contents, although unconscious, nevertheless support normal conscious functioning in an ongoing way (thus it is illustrated as most immediate to "I"). It is the capacity to form patterns of skills, behaviors, feelings, attitudes, and abilities that can function without conscious attention, thereby forming the infrastructure of one's conscious life.

The function of the middle unconscious can be seen in all spheres of human development, from learning to walk and talk, to acquiring languages, to mastering a trade or profession, to developing social roles. Anticipating today's neuroscience, Assagioli even referred to "developing new neuromuscular patterns".&lt;ref&gt;Assagioli, R. (1973). The Act of Will. New York: Penguin Books. p.191&lt;/ref&gt; All such elaborate syntheses of thought, feeling, and behavior are built upon learnings and abilities that must eventually operate unconsciously.

For Assagioli, 'Human healing and growth that involves work with either the middle or the lower unconscious is known as ''personal psychosynthesis'' '.&lt;ref&gt;John Firman/Ann Gila, ''Psychosynthesis: a psychology of the spirit'' (2002) p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

===Higher unconscious===
Assagioli termed 'the sphere of aesthetic experience, creative inspiration, and higher states of consciousness...the ''higher unconscious'' '.&lt;ref&gt;Firman/Gila, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The higher unconscious (or superconscious) denotes "our higher potentialities which seek to express themselves, but which we often repel and repress" (Assagioli). As with the lower unconscious, this area is by definition not available to consciousness, so its existence is inferred from moments in which contents from that level affect consciousness. Contact with the higher unconscious can be seen in those moments, termed peak experiences by Maslow, which are often difficult to put into words, experiences in which one senses deeper meaning in life, a profound serenity and peace, a universality within the particulars of existence, or perhaps a unity between oneself and the cosmos. This level of the unconscious represents an area of the personality that contains the "heights" overarching the "depths" of the lower unconscious. As long as this range of experience remains unconscious – in what Desoille termed '"repression of the sublime"'&lt;ref&gt;Ferrucci, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; – the person will have a limited ability to be empathic with self or other in the more sublime aspects of human life.

The higher unconscious thus represents 'an autonomous realm, from where we receive our higher intuitions and inspirations – altruistic love and will, humanitarian action, artistic and scientific inspiration, philosophic and spiritual insight, and the drive towards purpose and meaning in life'.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, p. 386&lt;/ref&gt; It may be compared to Freud's [[Id, ego, and super-ego|superego]], seen as 'the higher, moral, supra-personal side of human nature...a higher nature in man',&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (P. F. L. 11) p. 375&lt;/ref&gt; incorporating 'Religion, morality, and a social sense – the chief elements in the higher side of man...putting science and art to one side'.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Metapsychology'' p. 377&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subpersonalities===
[[Subpersonality|Subpersonalities]] based in the personal unconscious form a central strand in psychosynthesis thinking. 'One of the first people to have started really making use of subpersonalities for therapy and personal growth was Roberto Assagioli', psychosynthesis reckoning that 'subpersonalities exist at various levels of organization, complexity, and refinement'&lt;ref&gt;John Rowan, ''Discover Your Subpersonalities'' (1993) p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; throughout the mind. A five-fold process of recognition, acceptance, co-ordination, integration, and synthesis 'leads to the discovery of the Transpersonal Self, and the realization that that is the final truth of the person, not the subpersonalities'.&lt;ref&gt;Rowan, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

Some subpersonalities may be seen 'as psychological contents striving to emulate an [[archetype]]...''degraded expressions of the archetypes of higher qualities'' '.&lt;ref&gt;Ferrucci, p. 54-5&lt;/ref&gt; Others will resist the process of integration; will 'take the line that it is difficult being alive, and it is far easier – and safer – to stay in an undifferentiated state'.&lt;ref&gt;Parfitt, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

"I" is the direct "reflection" or "projection" of Self (Assagioli) and the essential being of the person, distinct but not separate from all contents of experience. "I" possesses the two functions of consciousness, or awareness, and will, whose field of operation is represented by the concentric circle around "I" in the oval diagram – Personal Will.

Psychosynthesis suggests that "we can experience the will as having four stages. The first stage could be described as 'having no will{{' "}},&lt;ref&gt;Will Parfitt, ''The Elements of Psychosynthesis'' (Dorset 1996) p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; and might perhaps be linked with the hegemony of the lower unconscious. "The next stage of the will is understanding that 'will exists'. We might still feel that we cannot actually do it, but we know...it is possible".&lt;ref&gt;Parfitt, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; "Once we have developed our will, at least to some degree, we pass to the next stage which is called 'having a will{{' "}}, and thereafter "in psychosynthesis we call the fourth and final stage of the evolution of the will in the individual 'being will{{' "}} – which then "relates to the 'I' or self...draws energy from the transpersonal self".&lt;ref&gt;Parfitt, p. 59-60 and p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

The "I" is placed at the center of the field of awareness and will in order to indicate that "I" is the one who has consciousness and will. It is "I" who is aware of the psyche-soma contents as they pass in and out of awareness; the contents come and go, while "I" may remain present to each experience as it arises. But "I" is dynamic as well as receptive: "I" has the ability to affect the contents of awareness and can even affect awareness itself, by choosing to focus awareness (as in many types of meditation), expand it, or contract it.

Since "I" is distinct from any and all contents and structures of experience, "I" can be thought of as not a "self" at all but as "noself". That is, "I" is never the object of experience. "I" is who can experience, for example, the ego disintegrating and reforming, who can encounter emptiness and fullness, who can experience utter isolation or cosmic unity, who can engage any and all arising experiences. "I" is not any particular experience but the experiencer, not object but subject, and thus cannot be seen or grasped as an object of consciousness. This "noself" view of "I" can be seen in Assagioli's discussion of "I" as a reflection of Self: "The reflection appears to be self-existent but has, in reality, no autonomous substantiality. It is, in other words, not a new and different light but a projection of its luminous source".&lt;ref name="Assagioli, R. 1965 p.20"&gt;Assagioli, R. (1965). Psychosynthesis. New York: The Viking Press. p.20&lt;/ref&gt;  The next section describes this "luminous source", Self.

===Self===
Pervading all the areas mapped by the oval diagram, distinct but not separate from all of them, is Self (which has also been called Higher Self or Transpersonal Self). The concept of Self points towards a source of wisdom and guidance within the person, a source which can operate quite beyond the control of the conscious personality. Since Self pervades all levels, an ongoing lived relationship with Self—Self-realization—may lead anywhere on the diagram as one's direction unfolds (this is one reason for not illustrating Self at the top of the diagram, a representation that tends to give the impression that Self-realization leads only into the higher unconscious). Relating to Self may lead for example to engagement with addictions and compulsions, to the heights of creative and religious experience, to the mysteries of unitive experience, to issues of meaning and mortality, to grappling with early childhood wounding, to discerning a sense of purpose and meaning in life.

The relationship of "I" and Self is paradoxical. Assagioli was clear that "I" and Self were from one point of view, one.  He wrote, "There are not really two selves, two independent and separate entities. The Self is one".&lt;ref name="Assagioli, R. 1965 p.20"/&gt; Such a nondual unity is a fundamental aspect of this level of experience. But Assagioli also understood that there could be a meaningful relationship between the person and Self as well:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Accounts of religious experiences often speak of a "call" from God, or a "pull" from some Higher Power; this sometimes starts a "dialogue" between the man [or woman] and this "higher Source"...&lt;ref&gt;Assagioli, R. (1973). The Act of Will. New York: Penguin Books. p.114&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Assagioli did not of course limit this relationship and dialogue to those dramatic experiences of "call" seen in the lives of great men and women throughout history. Rather, the potential for a conscious relationship with Self exists for every person at all times and may be assumed to be implicit in every moment of every day and in every phase of life, even when one does not recognize this. Whether within one's private inner world of feelings, thoughts, and dreams, or within one's relationships with other people and the natural world, a meaningful ongoing relationship with Self may be lived.

== Stages ==

Writing about the model of the person presented above, Assagioli states that it is a "structural, static, almost 'anatomical' representation of our inner constitution, while it leaves out its dynamic aspect, which is the most important and essential one".&lt;ref&gt;Assagioli, R. (1965). Psychosynthesis. New York: The Viking Press. p.16&lt;/ref&gt; Thus he follows this model immediately with a stage theory outlining the process of psychosynthesis. This scheme can be called the "stages of psychosynthesis", and is presented here.

It is important to note that although the linear progression of the following stages does make logical sense, these stages may not in fact be experienced in this sequence; they are not a ladder up which one climbs, but aspects of a single process. Further, one never outgrows these stages; any stage can be present at any moment throughout the process of Psychosynthesis, Assaglioli acknowledging 'persisting traits belonging to preceding psychological ages' and the perennial possibility of 'retrogression to primitive stages'.&lt;ref&gt;Assaglioli, ''Psychosynthesis'' p. 77 and p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

The stages of Psychosynthesis may be tabulated as follows:
# Thorough knowledge of one's personality.
# Control of its various elements.
# Realization of one's true Self—the discovery or creation of a unifying center.
# Psychosynthesis: the formation or reconstruction of the personality around a new center.&lt;ref&gt;Assagioli, R. (1965). Psychosynthesis. New York: The Viking Press. p.21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==

Psychosynthesis was regarded by Assagioli as more of an orientation and a general approach to the whole human being, and as existing apart from any of its particular concrete applications. This approach allows for a wide variety of techniques and methods to be used within the psychosynthesis context. 'Dialogue, [[Gestalt therapy|Gestalt]] techniques, dream work, guided imagery, affirmations, and meditation are all powerful tools for integration', but 'the attitude and presence of the guide are of far greater importance than the particular methods used'.&lt;ref&gt;Molly Young Brown, ''Unfolding Self'' (2004) p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; Sand tray, art therapy, journaling, drama therapy, and body work; cognitive-behavioral techniques; object relations, self psychology, and family systems approaches, may all be used in different contexts, from individual and group psychotherapy, to meditation and self-help groups. Psychosynthesis offers an overall view which can help orient oneself within the vast array of different modalities available today, and be applied either for therapy or for self-actualization.

Recently, two psychosynthesis techniques were shown to help student sojourners in their acculturation process. First, the self-identification exercise eased anxiety, an aspect of culture shock. Secondly, the subpersonality model aided students in their ability to integrate a new social identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lombard|first=Catherine Ann|date=2014|title=Coping with anxiety and rebuilding identity: A psychosynthesis approach to culture shock|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/KmPD4Cfz6NhcyXEsdraS/fullaccess-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another recent study, the subpersonality model was shown to be an effective intervention for aiding creative expression, helping people connect to different levels of their unconscious creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lombard|first=Catherine Ann|last2=Müller|first2=Barbara C. N.|date=2016-06-30|title=Opening the Door to Creativity A Psychosynthesis Approach|url=http://jhp.sagepub.com/content/early/2016/06/24/0022167816653224|journal=Journal of Humanistic Psychology|language=en|pages=0022167816653224|doi=10.1177/0022167816653224|issn=0022-1678}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, psychosynthesis psychotherapy has proven to activate personal and spiritual growth in self-identified atheists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lombard|first=Catherine Ann|date=2017-01-27|title=Psychosynthesis: A Foundational Bridge Between Psychology and Spirituality|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11089-017-0753-5|journal=Pastoral Psychology|language=en|pages=1–25|doi=10.1007/s11089-017-0753-5|issn=0031-2789}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One broad classification of the techniques used involves the following headings: ' '''Analytical''': To help identify blocks and enable the exploration of the unconscious'.&lt;ref name="Stewart, p. 392"&gt;Stewart, p. 392&lt;/ref&gt; Psychosynthesis stresses 'the importance of using obstacles as steps to growth'&lt;ref&gt;Ferrucci, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; – 'blessing the obstacle...blocks are our helpers'.&lt;ref&gt;Parfitt, p. 79 and p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; 
' '''Mastery'''...the eight psychological functions need to be gradually retrained to produce permanent positive change'.&lt;ref name="Stewart, p. 392"/&gt; 
' '''Transformation'''...the refashioning of the personality around a new centre'.&lt;ref name="Stewart, p. 392"/&gt; 
' '''Grounding'''...into the concrete terms of daily life.&lt;ref name="Stewart, p. 392"/&gt;
' '''Relational'''...to cultivate qualities such as love, openness and empathy'.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, p. 393&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychosynthesis allows practitioners the recognition and validation of an extensive range of human experience: the vicissitudes of developmental difficulties and early trauma; the struggle with compulsions, addictions, and the trance of daily life; the confrontation with existential identity, choice, and responsibility; levels of creativity, peak performance, and spiritual experience; and the search for meaning and direction in life. None of these important spheres of human existence need be reduced to the other, and each can find its right place in the whole. This means that no matter what type of experience is engaged, and no matter what phase of growth is negotiated, the complexity and uniqueness of the person may be respected—a fundamental principle in any application of psychosynthesis.

==Criticism==

In the December 1974 issue of ''[[Psychology Today]]'', Assagioli was interviewed by [[Sam Keen]] and was asked to comment on the limits of psychosynthesis. He answered paradoxically: "The limit of psychosynthesis is that it has no limits. It is too extensive, too comprehensive. Its weakness is that it accepts too much. It sees too many sides at the same time and that is a drawback."&lt;ref&gt;Keen, S. (1974). "The Golden Mean of Roberto Assagioli". ''Psychology Today''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychosynthesis "has always been on the fringes of the 'official' therapy world" and it "is only recently that the concepts and methods of psychoanalysis and group analysis have been introduced into the training and practice of psychosynthesis psychotherapy".&lt;ref&gt;Reinhard Kowalski, ''Discovering Your Self'' (1993) p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, the movement has been at times exposed to the dangers of fossilisation and [[cult]]ism, so that on occasion, having "started out reflecting the high-minded spiritual philosophy of its founder, [it] became more and more authoritarian, more and more strident in its conviction that psychosynthesis was the One Truth".&lt;ref&gt;Walter T. Anderson, ''The Upstart Spring'' (2004) p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

A more technical danger is that premature concern with the transpersonal may hamper dealing with personal psychosynthesis: for example, "evoking serenity ... might produce a false sense of well-being and security".&lt;ref&gt;Assaglioli, ''Psychosynthesis'' p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Practitioners have noted how "inability to ... integrate the superconscious contact with everyday experience easily leads to inflation", and have spoken of "an 'Icarus complex', the tendency whereby spiritual ambition fails to take personality limitations into account and causes all sorts of psychological difficulties".&lt;ref&gt;Ferrucci, pp. 159-161.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional analogies==

[[Stephen Potter]]'s "Lifemanship Psycho-Synthesis Clinic", where you may "find the psycho-synthesist lying relaxed on the couch while the patient will be encouraged to walk up and down"&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Potter, ''Some Notes on Lifemanship'' (London 1950) p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; would seem a genuine case of "[[parallel evolution]]", since its clear targets, as "the natural antagonists...of the lifeplay, are the psychoanalysts".&lt;ref&gt;Potter, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5612">'''Religious epistemology''' as a broad label covers any approach to [[epistemology|epistemological]] questions from a [[religion|religious]] perspective, or attempts to understand the epistemological issues that come from religious belief. The questions which epistemologists may ask about any particular belief also apply to religious beliefs and propositions: whether they seem rational, justified, warranted, reasonable, based on evidence and so on. Religious views also influence epistemological theories, such as in the case of [[Reformed epistemology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

Reformed epistemology has developed in contemporary Christian religious epistemology, as in the work of [[Alvin Plantinga]] (born 1932), [[William P. Alston]] (1921-2009), [[Nicholas Wolterstorff]] (born 1932) and [[Kelly James Clark]],&lt;ref name="Clark1990"&gt;{{cite book

[[D. Z. Phillips]] (1934-2006) takes this further and says that the argument of the reformed epistemologists goes further and challenges a view he dubs "[[foundationalism]]":
{{quotation|The essence of the Reformed challenge is to accuse the foundationalist of claiming to have a criterion of rationality which, in fact, he does not possess. By means of this alleged criterion the foundationalist claims to discern which epistemic practices are rational and which are not. Non-rational practices, he claims, include those of religion.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;|Phillips|Faith after Foundationalism}}

Much work in recent epistemology of religion goes beyond debates over foundationalism and reformed epistemology to consider contemporary issues deriving from social epistemology (especially concerning the epistemology of testimony, or the epistemology of disagreement), or formal epistemology's use of probability theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/knowledge-belief-and-god-9780198798705|title=Knowledge, Belief, and God: New Insights in Religious Epistemology|last=Benton, et. al.|first=Matthew A.|date=2018-04-22|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2018|isbn=9780198798705|location=Oxford, New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable work draws on the idea that knowing God is akin to knowing a person, which is not reducible to knowing propositions about a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stump |first1=Eleonore |title=Wandering in Darkness: Narrative and the Problem of Suffering |date=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780199277421}}, and {{cite journal |last1=Benton |first1=Matthew |title=God and Interpersonal Knowledge |journal=Res Philosophica |date=2018 |volume=95 |issue=3 |pages=421-447 |url=https://www.pdcnet.org/resphilosophica/content/resphilosophica_2018_0095_0003_0421_0447}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11515">'''Return of results''' is a concept in [[research ethics]] which describes the extent of the duty of a researcher to reveal and explain the results of research to a research participant.

Return of results is particularly discussed in the field of [[biobanks]], where a typical case would be that many members of a community donate [[biobank specimens]] for [[medical research]]. In the course of the research, especially in human [[genomics]] research, scientists may discover personal health information which could influence the behavior of specimen donors if they had this information. For different cases, there are arguments for and against revealing study information to participants and in many cases the morally correct choice is not self-evident.

==Example situation==
The following example shows some possible outcomes of trying to fulfill the return of results in genomic research.&lt;ref name="underpinnings"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Greely | first1 = H. T. | title = The Uneasy Ethical and Legal Underpinnings of Large-Scale Genomic Biobanks | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 8 | pages = 343–364 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17550341 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.7.080505.115721}} this example is a restatement of examples given in the article&lt;/ref&gt;

A healthy person donates a biological specimen and agrees to have that specimen and associated data put into a [[genome-wide association study]]. The goal of the study would be something unrelated to the donor's identified interests, and may be, for example, to build the base of [[fundamental research]] or to study [[rare disease]].

The sample is stored for years. Later a researcher gets access to data from the sample, and this data has been de-identified so that the researcher can use the data without invading the [[privacy for research participants|research participant's privacy]]. This researcher finds that the donor's specimen displays [[biomarkers]] which indicate that the person is at risk for developing a genetic disease. If an individual's personal physician had this genetic information, the [[standard of care]] might be to take action. One outcome of this scenario could be that the researcher contacts the specimen donor, gives this information, and the donor is more informed and happy for this.

Another outcome of this situation is that the researcher may not be a medical doctor, and in any case, it is not usual for a person to receive a diagnosis outside of a doctor-patient relationship. Even if the participant understands that the information is not a diagnosis, it can be confusing to know what to do when getting health information from an unknown person. Even if the researcher ought to tell the specimen donor about this development, it may not be the case that the researcher has the means to contact the participant because time has passed since the sample was collected and the means of contacting the participant may be unknown because there are research protections in place to prevent researchers from knowing the identity of the donor for the donor's own sake and right to privacy. The donor, for whatever reason, may not even want to know about a genetic problem, and may find the information unwelcome if tracked and informed. In addition to these stated problems, other problems can arise.

==Return of individual results==
There is debate as to whether researchers should give participants in research studies individual results based on their contribution to the study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bookman | first1 = E. B. | last2 = Langehorne | first2 = A. A. | last3 = Eckfeldt | first3 = J. H. | last4 = Glass | first4 = K. C. | last5 = Jarvik | first5 = G.

I. | last2 = Miller | first2 = F. G. | title = Disclosing Individual Results of Clinical Research: Implications of Respect for Participants | doi = 10.1001/jama.294.6.737 | journal = JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 294 | issue = 6 | pages = 737–40 | year = 2005 | pmid =  16091577| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arguments in favor===
Proponents of offering individual results most often cite "respect for persons" as the ethical basis for this practice. The following reasons support this argument: some studies have shown that participants want such results;&lt;ref name="bottle"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ossorio | first1 = P. N. | title = Letting the Gene Out of the Bottle: A Comment on Returning Individual Research Results to Participants | doi = 10.1080/15265160600935555 | journal = The American Journal of Bioethics | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages = 24–25; author 25 W10–25 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17085399 | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; returning results is a way of demonstrating respect to for donors' contributions to research;&lt;ref name="bottle"/&gt; research results, and especially genetic data, can be valuable information for individuals;&lt;ref name="bottle"/&gt; and when participants have access to more information about themselves it increases their personal autonomy.&lt;ref name="bottle"/&gt; Aside from medical health, having access to information may have social meaning to participants such as solidifying a [[cultural identity]], membership in an [[ethnic group]], or identifying a [[non-paternity event]].&lt;ref name="Ravitsky"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ravitsky | first1 = V. | last2 = Wilfond | first2 = B. S. | doi = 10.1080/15265160600934772 | title = Disclosing Individual Genetic Results to Research Participants | journal = The American Journal of Bioethics | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages = 8–17 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17085395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arguments against===
The definition of research is a major argument against offering research results. Research is not treatment and guidelines including the [[Belmont Report]] distinguish between "clinical practice" which has the goal of improving an individual's health and "research" which has the goal of developing general knowledge.&lt;ref name="elsi"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Haga | first1 = S. | last2 = Beskow | first2 = L. | doi = 10.1016/S0065-2660(07)00418-X | chapter = Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications of Biobanks for Genetics Research | title = Genetic Dissection of Complex Traits | series = Advances in Genetics | volume = 60 | pages = 505–544 | year = 2008 | isbn = 9780123738837 | pmid = 18358331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers must take care to not allow participants to be confused as to whether they are participating in research or receiving personal clinical care; a researcher is not a study participant's personal health advisor.&lt;ref name="merz"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Merz | first1 = J. F. | last2 = Sankar | first2 = P. | last3 = Taube | first3 = S. E. | last4 = Livolsi | first4 = V. | title = Use of human tissues in research: Clarifying clinician and researcher roles and information flows | journal = Journal of Investigative Medicine | volume = 45 | issue = 5 | pages = 252–257 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9249997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Study participants often have a tendency to perceive researchers as their physicians and research as personal treatment designed to benefit them.&lt;ref name="merz"/&gt;  When participants get information from researchers they may interpret it as health advice.&lt;ref name="merz"/&gt;

The nature of the results is problematic as well. Research data is often not comprehensible to participants and no one would want them to take health action based on unsubstantiated misinterpretations of the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Beskow | first1 = L. M. | doi = 10.1080/15265160600938328 | title = Considering the Nature of Individual Research Results | journal = The American Journal of Bioethics | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages = 38–40; author reply W10–2 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17085406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternate uses of term==
"Return of results" usually refers to the return of study data of personal or community interest to participants.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Research may result in other products besides data, such as the development of commercially valuable product which was a research goal. When the term "return of results" is used, it usually does not refer to the return of results of research (such as profit generated) other than an explanation of what the research showed.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} The debate about non-informational study results being returned is discussed as "ownership of results" or under other headings.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Issues relating to return of results==
There is no universally recognized authoritative policy on whether or how researchers should return results to research participants, and the views and practices of researchers in the field vary widely.&lt;ref name="elsi"/&gt;

==Research==
In September 2011 the [[National Human Genome Research Institute]] awarded grants totaling USD 5.7 million to study ethics relating to the return of results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bioethicsbulletin.org/archive/nhgri-funds-return-of-results-studies-forms-expert-consortium/|title=NHGRI funds return of results studies, forms expert consortium|first=|last=|work=bioethicsbulletin.org|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics]]|date=26 September 2011|accessdate=2 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426013429/http://bioethicsbulletin.org/archive/nhgri-funds-return-of-results-studies-forms-expert-consortium/|archivedate=26 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hypnosis|applications}}
'''Self-hypnosis''' or '''auto-hypnosis''' (as distinct from '''hetero-hypnosis''') is a form, a process, or the result of a [[hypnosis|self-induced hypnotic state]].

Frequently, self-hypnosis is used as a vehicle to enhance the efficacy of [[Autosuggestion|self-suggestion]]; and, in such cases, the subject "plays the dual role of suggester and suggestee".&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson (!909), p.167.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--"Self-hypnosis can make a person more yielding than normal.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}" A controversial statement that needs considerable support -- and, as well, needs to clearly describe how, when, where, and why "self-hypnosis" makes one any more "yielding" (whatever that ambiguous expression might mean) than one might be in a "normal" (i.e. "non self-hypnotic") condition. Also the extremely ambiguous language needs to be made precise; and, as well, whatever it is supposed to mean, requires a lucid explanation, rather than just a throwaway slogan.--&gt;

The nature of the auto-suggestive practice may be, at one extreme, "''concentrative''", wherein "all attention is so totally focused on [the words of the auto-suggestive formula, e.g. "Every day, in every way, I'm getting better and better"] that everything else is kept out of awareness" and, at the other, "''inclusive''", wherein subjects "allow all kinds of thoughts, emotions, memories, and the like to drift into their consciousness".&lt;ref&gt;Fromm &amp; Kahn (1990), pp.6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typological distinctions==
From their extensive investigations, Erika Fromm and Stephen Kahn (1990) identified significant and distinctive differences between the application of the wide variety of practices that lie within the domain commonly, equivocally, and ambiguously identified as "self-hypnosis".&lt;ref&gt;Fromm &amp; Kahn (1990) passim, especially pp.43-99.&lt;/ref&gt; Based upon their distinctions, "self-hypnosis" practices can be separated into, at least, thirteen different types:&lt;ref&gt;Based upon, and expanded from Fromm &amp; Kahn (1990), pp.43-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

On his return, Meares induced her to resume his "extremely simple and profound form of meditation in which she was originally instructed" and, once again, she went into full remisssion.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===James Braid===
The English term "hypnotism" was introduced in 1841 by the Scottish physician and surgeon [[James Braid (surgeon)|James Braid]].&lt;ref&gt;Yeates (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Braid, he first employed "self-hypnotism" (as he elsewhere refers to it) two years after discovering hypnotism, first teaching it to his clients before employing it on himself:
::"My first experiments on this point [i.e., self-hypnosis] were instituted in the presence of some friends on the 1st May, 1843, and following days. I believe they were the first experiments of the kind which had ever been tried, and they have succeeded in every case in which I have so operated."&lt;ref&gt;Braid (1843), p.xix.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a later work, ''Observations on Trance or Human Hybernation'' (1850), Braid provides probably the first account of self-hypnosis by someone using hypnotism upon themselves:
{{quotation

'''Braid's Account of Self-Hypnotism'''&lt;br /&gt;
It is commonly said that seeing is believing, but feeling is the very truth. I shall, therefore, give the result of my experience of hypnotism in my own person. In the middle of September, 1844, I suffered from a most severe attack of rheumatism, implicating the left side of the neck and chest, and the left arm. At first the pain was moderately severe, and I took some medicine to remove it; but, instead of this, it became more and more violent, and had tormented me for three days, and was so excruciating, that it entirely deprived me of sleep for three nights successively, and on the last of the three nights I could not remain in any one posture for five minutes, from the severity of the pain. On the forenoon of the next day, whilst visiting my patients, every jolt of the carriage I could only compare to several sharp instruments being thrust through my shoulder, neck, and chest. A full inspiration was attended with stabbing pain, such as is experienced in pleurisy. When I returned home for dinner I could neither turn my head, lift my arm, nor draw a breath, without suffering extreme pain. In this condition I resolved to try the effects of hypnotism. I requested two friends, who were present, and who both understood the system, to watch the effects, and arouse me when I had passed sufficiently into the condition; and, with their assurance that they would give strict attention to their charge, I sat down and hypnotised myself, extending the extremities. At the expiration of nine minutes they aroused me, and, to my agreeable surprise, I was quite free from pain, being able to move in any way with perfect ease. I say agreeably surprised, on this account; I had seen like results with many patients; but it is one thing to hear of pain, and another to feel it. My suffering was so exquisite that I could not imagine anyone else ever suffered so intensely as myself on that occasion; and, therefore, I merely expected a mitigation, so that I was truly agreeably surprised to find myself quite free from pain. I continued quite easy all the afternoon, slept comfortably all night, and the following morning felt a little stiffness, but no pain. A week thereafter I had a slight return, which I removed by hypnotising myself once more; and I have remained quite free from rheumatism ever since, now nearly six years.&lt;ref&gt;Braid (1850), pp.63-64.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Émile Coué===
[[Émile Coué]] was one of the most influential figures in the subsequent development of self-hypnosis.&lt;ref&gt;See Yeates (2016a, 2016b, and 2016c).&lt;/ref&gt; His method of "conscious autosuggestion" became an internationally renowned self-help system at the start of the 20th century. Although Coué distanced himself from the concept of "hypnosis", he sometimes referred to what he was doing as self-hypnosis, as did his followers such as [[Charles Baudouin]]. Modern hypnotherapists regard Coué as part of their own field.

===Autogenic training===
[[Autogenic training]] is a relaxation technique developed by the German psychiatrist [[Johannes Heinrich Schultz|Johannes Schultz]] and first published in 1932. Schultz based his approach on the work of the German [[hypnotist]] [[Oskar Vogt]]. The technique involves a step-by-step progression that begins from physiological conditioning, such as muscle relaxation, breathing control and heart rate control. Then it advances to psychic conditioning through mental imagery, acoustic therapy, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Babcock (1968).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Steps commonly used for self-hypnosis==
Self-hypnosis requires four distinct steps.
#'''''Motivation'''''. Without proper motivation, an individual will find it very difficult to practice self-hypnosis
#'''''Relaxation''''': The individual must be thoroughly relaxed and must set aside time to perform this act. Additionally, distractions should be eliminated as full attention is needed.
#'''''Concentration''''': the individual needs to concentrate completely as progress is made each time the mind focuses on a single image.
#'''''Directing''''': This is an option used only when the individual wants to work on a specific goal. The individual must direct their concentration on visualizing the desired result.&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt;

==Uses==
Self-hypnosis is used extensively in modern [[hypnotherapy]]. It can take the form of hypnosis carried out by means of a learned routine.

Hypnosis may help pain management,&lt;ref&gt;Patterson (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; anxiety,&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, et al. (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Holland"&gt;Holland (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; depression,&lt;ref&gt;Lynn &amp; Kirsch (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; sleep disorders,&lt;ref&gt;Graci &amp; Hardie (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; [[obesity]], asthma, and skin conditions.&lt;ref name="Mendoza et al"&gt;Mendoza &amp; Capafons (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; When this practice is mastered, it can improve concentration, recall, enhance problem solving, alleviate headaches and even improve one's control of [[emotions]].&lt;ref name="Moss"&gt;Moss (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pain===
Fromm &amp; Kaplan observe that the value, significance, and importance of self-hypnosis is not just that it promotes relaxation, relieves tension and anxiety, and reduces the level of physical pain and suffering, but also that, in teaching patients self-hypnosis, clinicians sensibly recognize that they can't be with their patients at all times — especially, at those times when they are in pain — and, through that process of teaching self-hypnosis, they actively provide their patients with a 24-hours-a-day-available "tool by means of which they can learn to control and master it, or at least be able to live with reduced pain".&lt;ref&gt;Fromm &amp; Kaplan (1990), p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;
::"Self-hypnosis permits the individual to be in charge and therefore helps the patient to get out of the role of the victim who suffers and into the role of the person who masters or attempts to master her pain. Through practicing self-hypnosis, patients can learn to isolate the feared pain that accompanies many a medical intervention; they can productively dissociate themselves into a position in which they can enjoy pleasurable fantasies and memories, away from the negative aspects of their current reality."&lt;ref&gt;Fromm &amp; Kaplan (1990), p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-hypnosis and stress===
Patients who are stressed and/or lack self-esteem can be taught self-hypnotic techniques which can induce relaxation and/or strengthen their self-esteem. Specifically, once the patient is in a self-hypnotic state the therapist can communicate messages to the patient, allowing the relaxation and strengthening process to occur.&lt;ref name="Sachs"&gt;Sachs (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, when teaching self-hypnosis, subjects are taught specific "trigger word" (that will only induce self-hypnosis when the subject deliberately uses the word hypnotize themselves) to facilitate the rapid induction of the hypnotic state.&lt;ref name="Sachs"/&gt;{{rp|114}} Also, a phrase (often termed an "autosuggestion") might be taught to the subject for them to repeat to themselves when in self-hypnosis.

In addition, since stress prevents well-functioning of the immune system, researchers from the Ohio State University came to a conclusion that self hypnosis to prevent stress can also help in protecting the immune system against the negative effects of it. They proved this by showing that students who performed self-hypnosis during stressful exam weeks showed a stronger immune system when compared to those who did not learn the technique of this phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Holland"/&gt;

===Childbirth anesthesia===
Self-hypnosis can help laboring women alleviate their pain. [[Joseph DeLee]], an obstetrician, stated in the early 20th century that hypnosis was the only risk-free childbirth anesthetic. Common self-hypnotic techniques include:&lt;ref&gt;Ketterhagen, et al. (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Glove anesthesia:''' Pretending the hand is numb and placing it upon a painful region to remove the sensation there.
# '''Time distortion:''' Perceiving periods of time accompanied by pain as shorter in length and those free of pain as longer lasting.
# '''Imaginative transformation:''' Viewing the pain as a non-threatening, acceptable sensation (perhaps merely pressure) that causes no trouble.

===Other uses===
Self-directed thought which is based in hypnosis can be used for many other issues and behavioral problems.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==Research==
Reviewing the findings of three previous studies in this area, [[John Kihlstrom|John F. Kihlstrom]] concluded: "Comparisons of self-hypnosis with more traditional 'hetero'-hypnosis show that they are highly correlated."&lt;ref name="Kihlstrom"&gt;Kihlstrom (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Kihlstrom questioned the extent to which most self-hypnosis qualitatively resembled the experience of traditional hetero-hypnosis.

'''Shlomo Kalo''' (25 February 1928 – 30 August 2014) was an Israeli prolific author and thinker, poet, composer, and medical microbiologist who published approx. 80 books, fiction and nonfiction. Some of his works are translated and published in 17 countries. He was longlisted for the Nobel Prize in Literature during the last years of his career.

== Biography ==
Shlomo Kalo was born on 25 February 1928, in [[Sofia]], [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]. At the age of 12, Kalo joined the anti-Fascist underground in Bulgaria. Aged 15, when Bulgaria was under Nazi occupation, Kalo was imprisoned in an improvised [[concentration camp]] in [[Somovit]].",&lt;ref&gt;biographical details of early years from: Kalo, Shlomo. ''Athar''. D.A.T. Publications, 2009 (English edition), an autobiographic novel.&lt;/ref&gt;
Aged 18, in 1946, he won a prize in a poetry competition and went to [[Prague]], where he studied medicine at the [[Charles University]], worked as a [[freelance]] journalist and wrote short stories.

When the state of Israel was founded in 1948, Shlomo Kalo joined the MAHAL ("Volunteers from abroad": individuals outside Israel who volunteered to fight together with the Israeli forces in its war of independence) and was trained as a pilot in [[Olomouc]], [[Czechoslovakia]]. In 1949, at the age of 21 he immigrated to Israel. In 1958 he got his M.Sc. in [[microbiology]] at the [[Tel Aviv University]]. For 26 years till his retirement (in 1988)  he worked as director of the medical laboratories of Kupat Holim Klalit health services, in Rishon-leZion. His first book in Hebrew, a collection of short stories, was published in 1954 by "Sifriyat ha-Poalim".

In 1969, a sharp turn in his life occurred (described in the last pages of his autobiographic novel "Erral"). It affected his life, thoughts and literary activity ever since. Kalo wrote about it:
"First Sunday of the year 1969 AD, twelve noon.
Body tensed like a bow-string. Not he.
Warmth rising from the region of the heart. Not he.
He stopped being what he was. He will no longer be as
he was, forever and ever, for all eternity.
He was, he is, he will be, forever and ever, for all
eternity."&lt;ref&gt;Kalo, Shlomo. ''Erral''. D.A.T. Publications, 2006 (English edition), p. 197. This book is a source for biographical details of adulthood years&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1979 an informal group known as "DAAT" (Hebrew acronym, meaning knowledge, standing for "know yourself always") formed around Shlomo Kalo. This group had a varying number of members or supporters till it disbanded in 2009. Some well-known and influential journalists and artists (Shlomo Bar-Abba, Odetta Schwartz and Rivka Zohar, for example) were associated at times with the group. Kalo's many books influenced people who had never met him.

In 2009, the Israeli Newspaper Ha'aretz reported that rumours were persistent that Shlomo Kalo was among few Israeli writers who had been shortlisted as candidates for the Nobel Prize for Literature,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/israeli-writer-amos-oz-hot-favorite-for-nobel-in-literature-1.6509] "Haaretz" newspaper, English internet site&lt;/ref&gt; similar reports were made by other news sites in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishliteraryreview.com/2010/10/nobel-prize-in-literature-who-will-win |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130127083333/http://www.jewishliteraryreview.com/2010/10/nobel-prize-in-literature-who-will-win |archivedate=2013-01-27 |df= }} Jewish Literary Review, Oct. 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;"Yediot Aharonot" newspaper, Oct. 2, 2011 page 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Shlomo Kalo was married to [[Rivka Zohar-Kalo]], a prominent Israeli singer, who performs and records, among others, songs he has written (music and lyrics).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shiron.net/artist?type=works&amp;lang=1&amp;prfid=1577&amp;sort=alpha&amp;class=2] A list of Shlomo Kalo's songs performed by Rivka Zohar at "shironet", Israeli songs &amp; music database site.&lt;/ref&gt;
Shlomo Kalo died at his home on August 30, Shabbat morning. His wife said on a Channel 2 TV interview&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lezUuDqrqE4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;list=UUwspuCv1L5rEptbYxKlpGhw] The "Medabrim Al Zeh" talk-show on September 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; that his summarizing last words were: "Everything is excellent to the one who is not subjugated".

== Literary activity ==
In the 1960s two other works of his were published by "Am Oved" and won great appreciation. In 1969 he established a publishing house named "DAAT Publications", from which he retired after a few years, though he continued to publish most of his following titles there. During the 1970s he translated into Hebrew classical writings of Far-Eastern schools such as: Patanjeli's Yoga verses, The Bhagavadgita, Budha's Dhamapada, Tao-Te-Ching and others. During these years and later in the 1980s Kalo published several nonfiction titles dealing with philosophical, moral and spiritual topics (two out of his seven volumes of lectures were published in this decade). Some other titles were literary fiction about a philosophical issue ("The Self as Fighter", "The Gospel of the Absolute Free Will" and the novel "Like the Scarlet Thread"). A lot of his music and songs were written in this period.

During the following two decades Kalo continued to write prolifically in a variety of genres and styles. In the 1990s his first titles written in a newly introduced genre (the so-called "documented" stories) were published: "Forevermore" and "Moments of Truth", as well as his best-selling historical novel title "The Chosen", printed in first edition. During these two decades translation rights of some of his books were sold over in 17 countries.

Short stories written by Shlomo Kalo were published in literary magazines in Israel, among them literary supplements of large newspapers. Some of his stories were included in various anthologies celebrating Israel's Jubilee year and other occasions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shats.com/maamarim/antology.htm . Shamush, Amnon (editor) ''50 Writers Choose a Story'' (Hebrew), 1998&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Prof. Gershon Shaked (Hebrew University) maintains in his Modern Fiction study (Indiana University, 2000; p 102-3) that Kalo's book "The Heap" marked 'two turning points in Hebrew Literary History; the beginning of modernist fiction in Israel, and the advent of Sephardi and Ashkenazi authors who wrote about the immigrant Sephardic community'. "The Heap," prof. Shaked continues, "has a special place in the history of Hebrew fiction because it is a neo-modernist social protest of an immigrant author". The novel is built around a number of immigrants who, reflecting their existential crisis, 'embody the archetype of human failure'.

Some 40 out of Kalo's 80 titles were published during the years 2000–2011.

== Other activities ==
1988 was the year when the extensive media exposure of Shlomo Kalo's contemplative and spiritual lifework began. Since that time, messages and solutions to a variety of issues have been both aired by national TV and radio channels, and widely covered by the press.&lt;ref&gt;The highest rating of which: news article in the only TV Channel about his new novel "The Chosen", 1994-12-30; Portraits in weekend issues of "Hadashot", "Maariv" and "Yidiot" newspaper, etc..&lt;/ref&gt;

Few years later, Kalo broke all ties with the media and almost always refused to interview requests saying his words and ideas were mistakenly quoted by the media.

During the Kosovo Crisis in 1999 Shlomo Kalo was the most prominent Israeli intellectual who publicly protested against US and NATO military attacks on Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;Westi newspaper published Kalo's manifest ''As a Human being and as a Jew'', 1999-6-13, and covered public activities he initiated or took place in.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kalo was never involved in any academic activity outside his M.Sc studies. Some of his nonfiction works nevertheless are listed in syllabi of various courses in social sciences and humanities in Israeli universities.

'''''Shōbōgenzō Zuimonki''''' ({{CJKV|j=正法眼蔵隨聞記}}), sometimes known by its English translation '''''The Treasury of the True Dharma Eye: Record of Things Heard''''', is a collection of informal [[Dharma talks]] given by the 13th century [[Sōtō]] [[Zen]] monk [[Eihei Dōgen]] and recorded by his primary disciple [[Koun Ejō]] from 1236 to 1239. The text was likely further edited by other disciples after Ejō's death.

The work is generally considered to be the easiest to understand of Dōgen's due to its concrete examples and the infrequent use of [[allusion]], [[metaphor]], and [[word play]] characteristic of his other writings. According to [[Shohaku Okumura]], a modern Zen priest, the fundamental message in Dōgen's talks is the importance of seeing [[impermanence]]. Dōgen also stresses the importance of [[Buddhist monasticism|monastic]] practice with a group of practitioners, practicing for the sake of the [[Buddhism|Buddhadharma]] alone, gainless [[zazen]], intentional [[Simple living|poverty]], and taking steps to benefit others.&lt;ref name=Okumura&gt;{{citation|last=Okumura|first=Shohaku|last2=Wright|first2=Tom|title=Shōbōgenzō Zuimonki|publisher=Soto-shu Shumucho|year=1988|pages=5–15|place=Tokyo, Japan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several different versions of the ''Shōbōgenzō Zuimonki'' exist. The most widely read was first published in 1770 by [[Menzan Zuihō]], a highly influential Zen scholar monk. This text is known as the ''rufu-bon'', which means "popular version". A second, older version is called the ''Chōenji-bon'', or "Chōen-ji version" after the temple in [[Aichi Prefecture]] where it was discovered in 1942 by Dōshū Ōkubo.

'''Southern [[hospitality]]''' is a phrase used in [[American English]] to describe the [[stereotype]] of residents of the [[Southern United States]] as particularly warm, sweet, and welcoming to visitors to their homes, or to the South in general. The term has engendered some controversy due to the connection of related practices to the culture of [[slavery]], and its continued use during periods of both overt and covert [[racism]], and other forms of [[prejudice]].

==Origins==
Southern hospitality "first existed as a narrowly defined body of social practices among the antebellum planters classes".&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Szczesiul, "Re-mapping southern hospitality: discourse, ethics, politics", ''European Journal of American Culture'' (2007), Issue 26, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the origin of the practice was intimately tied to [[slavery in the United States|slavery]].  One analysis notes:

{{quote|African Americans had little place in this initial conceptualization of hospitality beyond the role of servant. Yet, it was the labor and hardships of the enslaved that allowed southern planters to entertain their guests so lavishly and seemingly so effortlessly. Southern hospitality from and for whites was in large part achieved by being inhospitable and inhumane to African Americans.&lt;ref name="Alderman"&gt;Derek H. Alderman and E. Arnold Modlin Jr., "[https://www.academia.edu/2252782/Southern_Hospitality_and_the_Politics_of_African_American_Belonging_An_Analysis_of_Photographs_in_North_Carolina_Tourism_Brochures Southern hospitality and the politics of African American belonging: an analysis of North Carolina tourism brochure photographs]", ''Journal of Cultural Geography'' (December, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Over time, however, the concept "developed into a discourse that stretches far beyond the image of the [[planter class]]", and the principles of Southern hospitality were eventually adopted by African Americans in the South, and incorporated into materials used to advertise destinations in the South to African American tourists.&lt;ref name="Alderman"/&gt; The concept of Southern hospitality has also been examined as a reflection of the deeply held religious beliefs of the region; the idea that one should be good to strangers is an outgrowth of such [[Parables of Jesus|Biblical parable]]s as the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan|Good Samaritan]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Szczesiul, ''The Southern Hospitality Myth: Ethics, Politics, Race, and American Memory'' (2017), p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; Early [[travel writer]] Ernest Hamlin Abbott wrote in 1902, "as religious observances are in the South as naturally included in the hospitality of the home as anything else, so, conversely, hospitality in the South is an integral part of the church services".&lt;ref name="Abbott1902"&gt;{{cite book |last=Abbott |first=Ernest Hamlin |title=Religious Life in America: A Record of Personal Observation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fUcaAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PR111 |date=1902 |publisher=Outlook Company |page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
Some characteristics of Southern hospitality were described as early as 1835, when [[Jacob Abbott]] attributed the poor quality of taverns in the South to the lack of need for them, given the willingness of Southerners to provide for strangers.&lt;ref name="Abbott1835"/&gt; Abbott writes:

{{quote|[T]he hospitality of southerners is so profuse, that taverns are but poorly supported. A traveler, with the garb and the manners of a gentleman, finds a welcome at every door. A stranger is riding on horseback through Virginia or Carolina. It is noon. He sees a plantation, surrounded with trees, a little distance from the road. Without hesitation he rides to the door. The gentleman of the house sees his approach and is ready upon the steps.&lt;ref name="Abbott1835"&gt;{{cite book |last=Abbott |first=Jacob |title=New England and her Institutions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m7ETAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR223 |publisher=John Allen |date=1835 |page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Abbott further describes how the best stores of the house are at the disposal of visitors.&lt;ref name="Abbott1835"/&gt; Furthermore, says Abbott:

{{quote|Conversation flows cheeringly, for the southern gentleman has a particular tact in making a guest happy. After dinner you are urged to pass the afternoon and night, and if you are a gentleman in manners and information, your host will be in reality highly gratified by your so doing.&lt;br /&gt;Such is the character of southern hospitality.&lt;ref name="Abbott1835"/&gt;}}

Food figures highly in Southern hospitality, a large component of the idea being the provision of [[Cuisine of the Southern United States|Southern cuisine]] to visitors. A cake or other delicacy is often brought to the door of a new neighbor as a mechanism of introduction. Many club and church functions include a meal or at least a [[dessert]] and beverage. Churches in the South frequently have large commercial style kitchens to accommodate this tradition, but many "fellowship suppers" are "covered dish": everyone attending brings a dish. However, if a newcomer arrives without a dish, he or she will be made to feel welcome and served generously. When a death or serious illness occurs, neighbors, friends, and church members generally bring food to the bereaved family for a period of time. A number of [[cookbooks]] promise [[recipe]]s advancing this concept.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Winifred Green Cheney, ''The Southern Hospitality Cookbook'' (1976) {{ISBN|0-8487-0417-7}}; Sara Pitzer, ''Enjoying the Art of Southern Hospitality: Menus, Recipes, and Suggestions for Entertaining Simply and Graciously'' (1990) {{ISBN|0-87483-121-0}}; Lisette Verlander, Susan Murphy, ''The Cookin' Cajun Cooking School Cookbook'' (1997) {{ISBN|0-87905-784-X}} (stating "I learned to love the tastes and smells of good food, and that true Southern hospitality begins in the kitchen, the soul of a home"); James Villas, ''The Glory of Southern Cooking'' (2007) {{ISBN|0-7645-7601-1}} (discussing "the sacred tradition of preparing and serving lots of good food and drink to large numbers of family, friends, and even strangers — better known as Southern hospitality").&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Taishang Ganying Pian''''' (太上感應篇), or '''''Lao Tse's Treatise on the Response of the Tao''''', is a [[Taoist]] scripture from the 12th century that has been very influential in China. Li Ying-Chang,&lt;ref name="Laotzutreatise"&gt;Lao-tzu's treatise on the response of the Tao: translated with an introduction by Eva Wong. San Francisco, CA : Harper, c1994. p. xxvii&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Confucian]] scholar who retired from civil administration to teach Taoism, authored this. It is traditionally attributed to [[Lao Tse]] himself.

==Interpretation and themes==
The Treatise covers thoughts, words, and deeds in terms of ''[[ganying]]''. It has a simple, practical&lt;ref name="Laotzutreatise" /&gt; approach to ethics, lacking any esoteric details. It is all about good deeds.&lt;ref&gt;The Shambhala guide to Taoism 1st ed. / Eva Wong. Boston : Shambhala, c1997. p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; These are rewarded by longevity&lt;ref name="Laotzutreatise" /&gt; and health. Lists&lt;ref&gt;Lao-tzu's treatise on the response of the Tao: translated with an introduction by Eva Wong. San Francisco, CA : Harper, c1994. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; of deeds, both good and evil, are given in this tract. They focus on crimes, business practices, and other every day actions and events. It represents&lt;ref&gt;Lao-tzu's treatise on the response of the Tao: translated with an introduction by Eva Wong. San Francisco, CA : Harper, c1994. p. xxx&lt;/ref&gt; a turn away from previous Taoism in that it focuses not on meditative practices or self cultivation but on action in the world. 
Taoism represents a variety of different viewpoints and practices hard to categorize by era or sect. Categorizations are disputed by scholars. The Lushan&lt;ref name="Laotzutreatise_a"&gt;Lao-tzu's treatise on the response of the Tao: translated with an introduction by Eva Wong. San Francisco, CA : Harper, c1994. p. xx&lt;/ref&gt; Sect of Taoism, from the [[Southern Song]] Dynasty (1127-1297 ce) is a Taoist sect representative of the type of Taoism in the treatise, called 'acts and karma Taoism'&lt;ref&gt;The Shambhala guide to Taoism 1st ed. / Eva Wong. Boston : Shambhala, c1997. p. 86, 190, 191&lt;/ref&gt; by Eva Wong. There are few texts that represent this type of Taoism, this being the main one. Most of the others are morality tales that grew up around this Treatise. The lack of scriptures for this current of belief has in no way detracted from its popularity. 
[[Mahayana]] [[Buddhist]] viewpoint influenced&lt;ref name="Laotzutreatise_a" /&gt; this scripture. This book was most popular during the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] dynasty, (1368-1644 ce)

==Impact==
The Treatise has attracted both Taoists and Non-Taoists. It has gained a large&lt;ref&gt;Lao-tzu's treatise on the response of the Tao: translated with an introduction by Eva Wong. San Francisco, CA : Harper, c1994. p. xxiv&lt;/ref&gt; population base among the commoner, because it does not require a monastery to practice.&lt;ref name="Laotzutreatise_a" /&gt;

==Text==
It is a short tract, written before&lt;ref name="Laotzutreatise_b"&gt;Lao-tzu's treatise on the response of the Tao: translated with an introduction by Eva Wong. San Francisco, CA : Harper, c1994. p. xxxiii&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism were deliberately synthesized by scholars or the state. The stories that accompany it were written during or after this synthesis. The time of writing is after folk beliefs had begun to influence&lt;ref name="Laotzutreatise_b" /&gt; Taoism, which may have begun with [[Zhuang Zhou|Chuang Tse]].

==Translations==
It was first translated into English by Christian missionary Douglas Legge,&lt;ref&gt;Lao-tzu's treatise on the response of the Tao: translated with an introduction by Eva Wong. San Francisco, CA : Harper, c1994. p. xxviii&lt;/ref&gt; in 1891. He thought it was crucial for the understanding of Chinese people's moral thought. There is a recent translation by Eva Wong and co. A new English Liturgy Version has also been recently published by Terebess Asia Online (see external links).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7654">'''US Organization''', or '''Organization Us''', is a [[Black nationalism|Black nationalist]] group in the [[United States]] founded in 1965.  It was established as a community organization by [[Hakim Jamal]] together with [[Maulana Karenga]]. It was a rival to the [[Black Panther Party]] in [[California]]. One of the early slogans was, "Anywhere we are US is." "US" referred to "[us] black people" in opposition to their oppressors ("them").

==Foundation (1965)==
After the  assassination of [[Malcolm X]] in February 1965 and the [[Watts riots]] the following August, Maulana Karenga and Hakim Jamal began a discussion group called the "circle of seven". Hakim Jamal, cousin of Malcolm X, created a magazine entitled ''US''. It was a pun on the phrase "us and them" and the standard abbreviation of "United States" and/or "United Slaves", referring to "Us Black People" as a nation.&lt;ref&gt;http://unitedblackamerica.com/black-history-maulana-karenga/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Hayes, III | first = Floyd W. | last2 = Jeffries | first2 = Judson L. | title = Black Power in the Belly of the Beast | pages = 74–75 | publisher = University of Illinois Press | place = Chicago }}&lt;/ref&gt; This promoted the idea of black cultural unity as a distinct national identity.&lt;ref name = "scot"&gt;Scott Brown, ''Fighting for US: Maulana Karenga, the US organization, and Black cultural nationalism'', NYU Press, 2003, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

Jamal and Karenga founded the US Organization.  They published a magazine ''Message to the Grassroot'' in 1966, in which Karenga was listed as chairman and Jamal as founder of the new group.&lt;ref name = "scot"/&gt;

===Aims===
Its aim was to promote African-American cultural unity. Haiba Karenga and Dorothy Jamal, the wives of the two founders, ran the organization's "US School of Afroamerican Culture", to educate children with the group's ideals.  However, their husbands soon differed about how to achieve the group's aims. Jamal argued that the ideas of Malcolm X should be the main ideological model for the group, while Karenga wished to root black Americans in [[African culture]].&lt;ref name="scot"/&gt;

Karenga became the main active force in the group, organizing projects such as teaching [[Swahili language|Swahili]] and promoting traditional African rituals.&lt;ref name = "scot"/&gt;  Jamal believed that these had no relevance to modern African-American life, so he left "US" to establish the rival Malcolm X Foundation, based in Compton, California.  Karenga became the driving force behind "US."

==Creation of Kwanzaa (1966)==
Karenga's ideas culminated in the invention of the [[Kwanzaa]] festival in 1966, designed as the first specifically African-American holiday. It was to be celebrated over the Christmas/New Year period.&lt;ref name="Kwanzaa Date"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F00B1EFD395C0C738FDDAB0994DB484D81|work=[[New York Times]]"|title=The Evening Hours|date=1983-12-30 |accessdate=2006-12-15 | first=Ron | last=Alexander}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karenga said his goal was to "give Blacks an alternative to the existing holiday and give Blacks an opportunity to celebrate themselves and history, rather than simply imitate the practice of the dominant society."&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.www.brookhavencourier.com/media/storage/paper807/news/2008/11/24/News/Kwanzaa.Celebrates.Culture.Principles-3560412.shtml Kwanzaa celebrates culture, principles] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708095122/http://media.www.brookhavencourier.com/media/storage/paper807/news/2008/11/24/News/Kwanzaa.Celebrates.Culture.Principles-3560412.shtml |date=July 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group's ideals are summed up in the seven principles: Unity (Umoja), Self-Determination (Kujichagulia), Collective Work and Responsibility (Ujima), Cooperative Economics (Ujamaa), Purpose (Nia), Creativity (Kuumba), and Faith (Imani).

For Karenga, a major figure in the Black Power movement of the 1960s and 1970s, the creation of the holiday also underscored an essential premise that "you must have a cultural revolution before the violent revolution. The cultural revolution gives identity, purpose and direction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Keith A. |last=Mayes |year=2009 |title=Kwanzaa: Black Power and the Making of the African-American Holiday Tradition | pages=63–65 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vhgk72OGBRYC&amp;pg=PA52#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn= 978-0415998550  |accessdate= December 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kwanzaa – celebrates its 50th year anniversary|url=https://unityfirst.com/2016/kwanzaa-celebrates-its-50th-year-anniversary/|website=UnityFirst|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rivalry with the Black Panthers (1969)==
The Black Panthers and US had different aims and tactics but often found themselves competing for potential recruits. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] intensified this antipathy, sending forged letters to each group which purported to be from the other group, so that each would believe that the other was publicly humiliating them.&lt;ref&gt;Gentry, Curt, ''[[J. Edgar Hoover]]: The Man and the Secrets''. W. W. Norton &amp; Company (2001) p. 622&lt;/ref&gt; This rivalry came to a head in 1969, when the two groups supported different candidates to head the [[African American studies|Afro-American Studies]] Center at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="taste"&gt;Brown, Elaine. ''A Taste of Power: A Black Woman's Story.'' (New York: Doubleday, 1992) p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gun battle at UCLA ===
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Huggins and Carter dead.jpg|thumb|250px|[[John Huggins]] and [[Bunchy Carter]], members of the Black Panther Party, were shot and killed at UCLA on January 17, 1969.]] --&gt;

On January 17, 1969, a gun battle between the groups on the UCLA campus ended in the deaths of two Black Panthers: [[John Huggins]] and [[Bunchy Carter|Alprentice "Bunchy" Carter]]. This led to a series of retaliatory shootings that lasted for months. Later in 1969, two other Black Panther members were killed and one other was wounded by US members.&lt;ref name="taste"/&gt;

The Panthers referred to the US organization as the "United Slaves", a name never actually used by members of US but which is often mistaken for the group's official name.&lt;ref&gt;Floyd W. Hayes III and Judson L. Jeffries.  "Us Does Not Stand for United Slaves!" in ''Black Power in the Belly of the Beast'', edited by Judson L. Jeffries. (Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 2006) 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conviction of Karenga (1971)==
In 1971, Karenga, Louis Smith, and Luz Maria Tamayo were convicted of felony assault.

He was sentenced to 1-to-10 years in prison.

==Re-establishment (1971–present)==
In 1971, the women of organization continued organizing while Karenga was imprisoned. After his release in 1975 Karenga re-established the organization under a new structure and it continues to operate.

'''Ursula de Jesus''' (1604–1668) She was born in Lima, Peru and was the legitimate daughter of Juan Castilla and Isabel de los Rios. Isabel de los Rios was a slave leaving Ursula to inherit her mother's status. Ursula de Jesus was an [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]]-[[Peruvian]] who rose out of [[slavery]] who became a donada (religious servant) in the [Roman Catholic Church]. She lived under her mother’s owner, Gerònima De Los Rios, until she was roughly eight years old.  The daughter of slaves was her first experience with mysticism when she became the property of Luisa de Melgarejo Sotomayor, a mystic and beata, lay pious woman,(very religious women) in Lima. In 1647, she went to the Convent of Santa Clara in Lima as the servant of Ines del Pulgar, a 16-year-old novice and the niece of the woman who owned her parents. She labored as a slave for forty-three of her sixty-two years.&lt;ref name=UDJ&gt;Van Deusen, Nancy E. “The Souls of Purgatory.” University of New Mexico Press, 2004. {{ISBN|0-8263-2827-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1642, Ursula was known to have a reputation of vanity within the convent and liked to dress well. Ursula saw herself as self-centered, temperamental and vain. She lent a skirt to someone as a favor and they returned it to her soiled. Ursula was eager to wash the skirt as soon as she possibly could. She went to the well to wash it and the platform in which the well stood on collapsed, leavening Ursula suspended by her own grip and holding on to her life. This was a near fatal fall and she prayed to the Virgin of Carmen to rescue her.  Miraculously, she was able to regain balance and enough leverage to reach safety.  This was her testimonial awakening.  This near death experience lead Ursula to change her materialistic views and habits; causing her to devote her life to spirituality and become a servant of God.&lt;ref name="UDJ"/&gt;

For the remainder of her life, Ursula de Jesus sought a life of religious spirituality. In 1645, one of the nuns of the convent purchased her freedom. Although she was denied the ability to become a nun because of her race, she remained at the convent as a donada. She stated that she experienced divine visions, particularly with the souls in purgatory who sought her intercession to gain their release. Throughout her lifetime, she was notable for her mystical visions and her claims of communicating with the souls of those who died and went to purgatory. She felt she had the ability to do so because of her near death experience. A diary of her visions and life experiences was created between 1650 and 1661; it was first published in English in 2004. Ursula claimed that trapped nuns within the Purgatory would contact her. Some of the nuns whom she came in contact with told her that they were paying a very painful consequence for their behavior during their life and allegedly answered many of Ursula's questions by stating many of them should have paid closer attention during mass rather than participating in spreading gossip and negotiating business. These dead souls of the Purgatory are supposedly trapped there and are communicating with Ursula with high hopes that her prayers may have the ability to alleviate their suffering with in Purgatory.&lt;ref name="UDJ"/&gt;

Throughout Ursula's personal journal she recorded complaints about the demanding nuns and how she was spat upon and ridiculed. She endures an excessive amount of work and chores when compared to the other pampered nuns. Despite the fact that Ursula completely devoted herself to serving God after being freed from slavery, she was never able to come out of the hovering shadow of discrimination. She was still treated differently for her Afro-descent and dark completion.  Often times she showed her vulnerability in her diary when she questioned God why she had to be the one who suffered.  According to her their conversations went as stated,

{|
||
| " Frequently I asked my God why do I have to be the one to work excessively long hours ? He reminded me of the excruciating suffering that He endured during the Passion.  I stated that if it were not for Him I would not persevere in this, He responded that although the Son of God was quite well off in His kingdom of Glory, He came to suffer and travail for our sake."

Towards the end of her life, Ursula was sure she would be granted a direct and safe passage to Heaven. She was sure she would be saved because of her selfless efforts and her self-sacrificing ways. Ursula de Jesus died February 23, 1666. A nun by the name of doña Leonor Basques, a well-respected nun, declared her death to be seen as a "good death" and stated that Ursula de Jesus indeed entered Heaven by preparing her will, disposing of worldly possessions, confessed her sins, and received extreme unction.&lt;ref name="UDJ"/&gt;

A '''whispering campaign''' or '''whisper campaign''' is a method of [[persuasion]] in which damaging [[rumor]]s or [[innuendo]] are spread about the target, while the source of the rumors seeks to avoid being detected while spreading them (for example, a [[political campaign]] might distribute anonymous flyers attacking the other candidate). It is generally considered [[ethics|unethical]] in [[open society|open societies]], particularly in matters of public policy.  The speed and anonymity of communication made possible by modern technologies like the [[Internet]] has increased public awareness of whisper campaigns and their ability to succeed. This phenomenon has also led to the failure of whisper campaigns, as those seeking to prevent them are able to publicize their existence much more readily than in the past. Whisper campaigns are defended in some circles as an efficient mechanism for [[Underdog (competition)|underdog]]s who lack other resources to attack the powerful.

==Marketing==
Alcohol and tobacco companies have used whisper campaigns to promote their products since the early 20th century. Liquor companies have, and in some areas still do, send attractive people into bars to order specific drinks in voices that can be overheard.{{fact|date=December 2015}} Other tactics include "buying" drinks, or giving away cigarettes to patrons, without making known that the benefactor is a representative of the company. More recently, companies are also paying bloggers to mention products or causes. Also, companies can hire employees to post comments on blogs, forums, [[Conflict-of-interest editing on Wikipedia|online encyclopedias]], etc. that steer online conversations in desired directions, as a form of [[astroturfing]].

==Politics==

[[File:Jadams.jpeg|thumb|left|Portrait of [[John Adams]] by John Trumbull, 1792–93]]
[[File:Mather Brown - Thomas Jefferson - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Thomas Jefferson]] while in London in 1786, by [[Mather Brown]]]]
Whisper campaigns in the [[United States]] began with the conflict between [[John Adams]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]] as the two were vying for the [[United States presidential election, 1800|1800 presidential election]]. The [[Federalist Party|Federalists]] (those on Adams' side) accused Jefferson of having robbed a widow and her children of a [[trust fund]] and of having fathered numerous mulatto children by his own [[Female slavery|slave women]].

Whisper campaigns are frequently used in [[electoral politics]] as a method of shaping the discussion without being seen to do so.  [[U.S. President]] [[Grover Cleveland]] was the target of a whisper campaign in 1884, when [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] claimed that Cleveland had fathered an illegitimate child while he was still Governor of New York.  President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] was frequently a topic of whisper campaigns resulting from his support for civil rights and other topics.  

During the [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2000|2000 Republican presidential primary]], Senator [[John McCain]] was the target of a whisper campaign implying that he had fathered a [[black people|black child]] out of wedlock. (McCain's adopted daughter is a dark-skinned child from [[Bangladesh]]). Voters in South Carolina were reportedly [[push poll|asked]], "Would you be more likely or less likely to vote for John McCain if you knew that he fathered an illegitimate black child?".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/dirty-tricks-south-carolina-and-john-mccain/|title=Dirty Tricks, South Carolina and John McCain|newspaper=The Nation|issn=0027-8378|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCain would later lose the South Carolina primary, and the nomination, to [[George W. Bush]].

In addition, on the week of the nomination vote, dozens of radio stations were called on the same day asking talk show hosts what they thought of McCain's fathering of a [[black people|black child]] out of wedlock. McCain later said of the incidents:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dadmag.com/archive/060400jmccain.php |title=Senator John McCain Talks About the Challenges of Fatherhood, from |publisher=DadMag.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;There were some pretty vile and hurtful things said during the South Carolina primary. It's a really nasty side of politics. We tried to ignore it and I think we shielded [our daughter] from it. It's just unfortunate that that sort of thing still exists. As you know she's [[Bengali people|Bengali]], and very dark skinned. A lot of phone calls were made by people who said we should be very ashamed about her, about the color of her skin. Thousands and thousands of calls from people to voters saying, 'You know, the McCains have a black baby.' I believe that there is a special place in hell for people like those.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2018, when the question of what the United States should do about the [[disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi]] was an open question, a whispering campaign was mounted attacking the character of Khashoggi.&lt;ref name="WP101818"&gt;{{cite news |author1=Robert Costa |author2=Karoun Demirjian |title=Conservatives mount a whisper campaign smearing Khashoggi in defense of Trump |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/conservatives-mount-a-whisper-campaign-smearing-khashoggi-in-defense-of-trump/2018/10/18/feb92bd0-d306-11e8-b2d2-f397227b43f0_story.html |accessdate=October 19, 2018 |work=The Washington Post |date=October 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Forward101918"&gt;{{cite news |author1=Ron Kampeas |title=Pro-Israel Voices Join Smear Campaign Against Jamal Khashoggi |url=https://forward.com/news/breaking-news/412347/pro-israel-voices-join-smear-campaign-against-jamal-khashoggi/ |accessdate=October 20, 2018 |work=The Forward |date=October 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
