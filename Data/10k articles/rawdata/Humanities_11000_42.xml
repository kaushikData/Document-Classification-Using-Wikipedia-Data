'''African-American English''' ('''AAE'''), also known as '''Black English''' in [[North America]]n [[linguistics]], is the set of English dialects primarily spoken by most [[black people]] in [[North America]];{{sfnp|Edwards|2004|p=383}} most commonly, it refers to a dialect continuum ranging from [[African-American Vernacular English]] to a more [[standard English]].&lt;ref&gt;Di Paolo, Marianna; Spears, Arthur K. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=j5D8AgAAQBAJ&amp;q=%22the+term+aave%22 Languages and Dialects in the U.S.: Focus on Diversity and Linguistics]''. Routledge. p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; African-American English shows variation such as in vernacular versus standard forms, rural versus urban characteristics, features specific to singular cities or regions only, and other sociolinguistic criteria. There has also  been a significant body of [[African-American literature]] and [[oral tradition]] for centuries.

African-American English began as early as the seventeenth century, when the [[Atlantic slave trade]] brought African slaves into the majority-white culture of [[British colonization of the Americas|British-colonial North America]] in an area that became the [[Southern United States]] in the late eighteenth century.{{sfnp|Kautzsch|2004|p=341}} During the development of [[Plantations in the American South|plantation culture]] in this region, [[nonstandard dialect]]s of English were widely spoken by British settlers,{{sfnp|McWhorter|2001|pp=162, 182}} as well as likely some [[English-based creole languages|creolized varieties]], probably resulting in both first- and second-language English varieties developed by African Americans.{{sfnp|Kautzsch|2004|p=341}} The nineteenth century's evolving cotton-plantation industry, and eventually the twentieth century's [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], certainly contributed greatly to the spread of the first of these varieties as stable dialects of English. The most widespread modern dialect is known as [[African-American Vernacular English]].

==African-American Vernacular English==
{{main|African-American Vernacular English}}
African-American Vernacular (AAVE) is the native [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] of the vast majority of [[working class|working-]] and [[middle class|middle-class]] [[African Americans]], particularly in urban areas,{{sfnp|Edwards|2004|p=383}} with its own unique accent, grammar, and vocabulary features. Typical features of the grammar include a [[zero copula|"zero" copula]] (e.g., ''she my sister'' instead of ''she's my sister''), simplification of the possessive form (e.g., ''my momma friend'' instead of ''my mom's friend''), and complexification of verb aspects and tenses beyond those of other English dialects (e.g., constructions like ''I'm a-run'', ''I be running'', ''I been runnin'', ''I done ran'', etc.). Common features of the phonology include [[Rhoticity in English|non-rhoticity]] (dropping the ''r'' sound at the end of syllables), the [[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathetic use]] of ''aks'' instead of ''ask'', simplification of diphthongs (e.g., ''eye'' typically sounds like ''ah''), a [[raising (phonetics)|raising]] [[chain shift]] of the [[front vowel]]s, and a wider range of intonation or "melody" patterns than most [[General American]] accents. AAVE is used by middle-class African Americans in casual, intimate, and informal settings as one end of a sociocultural language continuum, and AAVE shows some slight variations by region or city.

==African-American Standard English==
African-American Standard English is the prestigious end of the middle-class African-American language continuum, used for more formal, careful, or public settings than AAVE. This variety exhibits [[standard English]] vocabulary and grammar but often retains certain elements of the unique AAVE accent,{{sfnp|Rickford|2015|pp=302, 310}}{{sfnp|Spears|2015}} with intonational or rhythmic features maintained more than phonological ones.&lt;ref name="Green 2002 125"&gt;{{Cite book|title=African American English a linguistic introduction|last=Green|first=Lisa J.|publisher=The Press Syndicate of The University of Cambridge|year=2002|isbn=0 521 81449 9|location=The Edinburgh Building, Cambridge CB2 2RU, UK 40 West 20th Street, New York, NY 10011-4211, USA|pages=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most middle-class African Americans are typically [[wikt:bidialectal|bi-dialectal]] between this standard variety and AAVE, learning the former variety through schooling, so that adults will frequently even [[codeswitch]] between the two varieties within a single conversation. Of the phonological features maintained in this standard dialect, they tend to be less [[markedness|marked]] features that, for instance, even appear in some white standard dialects of English.&lt;ref name="Green 2002 125"/&gt; One such characteristic is the omission of the final consonant in word-final [[consonant clusters]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/what-ebonics-african-american-english|title=What is Ebonics (African American English)? {{!}} Linguistic Society of America|website=www.linguisticsociety.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; so words such as ''past'' or ''hand'' may lose their final consonant sound.

==African-American Appalachian English==
The small numbers of black [[Appalachian Americans]] have been reported as increasingly accommodating to the [[Appalachian English|Appalachian]]/[[Southern American English|Southern dialect]] commonly associated with white Appalachians. These similarities include an accent that is rhotic, the categorical use of the grammatical construction "he works" or "she goes" (rather than the AAVE "he work" and "she go"), and Appalachian vocabulary (such as ''airish'' for "windy"). However, even African-American English in [[Appalachia]] is diverse, with African-American women linguistically divided along sociocultural lines: culturally conservative and "proper" church-goers tending to use more Appalachian regional features, but "porch sitters" affiliated with nationwide black youth culture and music tending to use more AAVE features.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram, Walt. (2013). "[http://artsandsciences.sc.edu/appalachianenglish/sites/default/files/African%20American%20Speech%20in%20Appalachia.pdf African American speech in southern Appalachia]". In ''Talking Appalachian: Voice, Identity, and Community'', edited by Nancy Hayward and Amy Clark. pp. 81-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

==African-American Outer Banks English==
African-American English in the North Carolina [[Outer Banks]] is rapidly accommodating to urban AAVE through the recent generations, despite having aligned with local [[High Tider|Outer Banks English]] for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram, Walt; Kohn, Mary E. (forthcoming). "[https://www.academia.edu/20295897/The_Regional_Development_of_African_American_Language The regional development of African American Language]". In Sonja Lanehart, Lisa Green, and Jennifer Bloomquist (eds.), ''The Oxford Handbook on African American Language''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Older African-American English==
Older or earlier African-American English refers to a set of many heterogeneous varieties studied and reconstructed by linguists as [[Theoretical linguistics|theoretically spoken]] by the first African Americans and African slaves in the United States. Of primary interest is the direct theoretical predecessor to AAVE. Mainly four types of sources have been used for the historical reconstruction of older AAVE: written interviews, ex-slave audio recordings, the modern [[African-American diaspora|diaspora]] dialects of isolated black communities, and letters written by eighteenth- and nineteenth-century African Americans.{{sfnp|Kautzsch|2004|pp=342-344}} The use of the [[zero copula]] (the absence of ''is'' or ''are'', as in ''she gonna leave''), nonstandard plural forms (''the three man'', ''mans'', or even ''mens'') and [[multiple negative]]s (as in ''no one didn't leave me nothing'') were occasional or common variants in these earlier dialects, and the latter item even the preferred variant in certain grammatical contexts.{{sfnp|Kautzsch|2004|pp=347-349}} Other nonstandard grammatical constructions associated with AAVE are documented in older dialects too; however, many of them are not, evidently being recent innovations of twentieth-century urban AAVE.{{sfnp|Kautzsch|2004|pp=347}}

==Gullah==
[[Gullah language|Sea Island Creole English]], or "Gullah", is the distinct language of some African Americans along the South Carolina and Georgia coast. Gullah is an [[English creole]]: a natural language grammatically independent from English that uses mostly English vocabulary. Most Gullah speakers today probably form a continuum with the English language. A sub-dialect of Gullah is also spoken in Oklahoma and Texas, known as [[Afro-Seminole Creole]].

==In literature==
There is a long tradition of representing the speech of blacks in [[American literature]].  A number of researchers&lt;ref&gt;For example,{{Harvcoltxt|Holloway|1978}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Holloway|1987}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Baker|1984}}, and {{Harvcoltxt|Gates|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; have looked into the ways that American authors have depicted the speech of black characters, investigating how black identity is established and how it connects to other characters.  {{Harvcoltxt|Brasch|1981|p=x}} argues that early mass media portrayals of black speech are the strongest historical evidence of a separate variety of English for blacks.&lt;ref&gt;cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Green|2002|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Early popular works are also used to determine the similarities that historical varieties of black speech have in common with modern AAVE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Green|2002|p=166}}, citing {{Harvcoltxt|Dillard|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Walser|1955|p=269}}

The earliest depictions of black speech came from works written in the eighteenth century,{{sfnp|Rickford|Rickford|2000|p=13}} primarily by white authors. A notable exception is ''[[Clotel]]'', the first novel written by an African American ([[William Wells Brown]]).{{sfnp|Rickford|1999|p=??}}{{sfnp|Rickford|Rickford|2000|p=19}}  Depictions have largely been restricted to dialogue and the first novel written entirely in AAVE was [[June Jordan]]'s ''His Own Where'' (1971),{{sfnp|Rickford|Rickford|2000|p=21}} though [[Alice Walker]]'s [[epistolary novel]] ''[[The Color Purple]]'' is a much more widely known work written entirely in AAVE.{{sfnp|Rickford|Rickford|2000|p=22}}  [[Lorraine Hansberry]]'s 1959 play ''[[A Raisin in the Sun]]'' also has near exclusive use of AAVE.{{sfnp|Rickford|Rickford|2000|p=28}} The poetry of [[Langston Hughes]] uses AAVE extensively.&lt;ref&gt;The Collected Poems of Langston Hughes, edited by Arnold Rampersad and David Roessel (New York: Vintage Classics, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2014}}

Some other notable works that have incorporated representations of black speech (with varying degrees of perceived authenticity) include:&lt;ref&gt;Examples listed in {{Harvcoltxt|Rickford|Rickford|2000|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Edgar Allan Poe]]: "[[The Gold-Bug]]" (1843)

* [[Joel Chandler Harris]]: ''[[Uncle Remus]]'' (1880)
* [[Mark Twain]]: ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'' (1885)
* [[Thomas Nelson Page]]: ''In Ole Virginia'' (1887)
* [[Thomas Dixon, Jr.|Thomas Dixon]]: ''[[The Clansman]]'' (1905)
* [[William Faulkner]]: ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]'' (1929)

* [[Push (novel)|Sapphire: ''Push: A Novel'']] (1996)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Push|last=Sapphire|first=|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|year=1996|isbn=9780679446262|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As there is no established spelling system for AAVE,{{sfnp|Green|2002|p=238}} depicting it in literature is instead often done through spelling changes to indicate its phonological features,{{sfnp|Green|2002|pp=168, 196}} or to contribute to the impression that AAVE is being used ([[eye dialect]]).{{sfnp|Rickford|Rickford|2000|p=23}} More recently, authors have begun focusing on grammatical cues,{{sfnp|Rickford|1999|p=??}} and even the use of certain rhetorical strategies.{{sfnp|Green|2002|p=196}}

Portrayals of black characters in movies and television are also done with varying degrees of authenticity.{{sfnp|Green|2002|p=?}}  In ''[[Imitation of Life (1934 film)|Imitation of Life]]'' (1934), the speech and behavioral patterns of Delilah (an African American character) are reminiscent of minstrel performances that set out to exaggerate stereotypes, rather than depict black speech authentically.{{sfnp|Green|2002|p=202}} More authentic performances, such as those in the following movies and TV shows, occur when certain speech events, vocabulary, and syntactic features are used to indicate AAVE usage, often with particular emphasis on young, urban African Americans:{{sfnp|Green|2002|pp=206–209, 211}}
* ''[[Do the Right Thing]]'' (1989)
* ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel Air]]'' (1990–1996)
* ''[[Jungle Fever]]'' (1991)
* ''[[Laurel Avenue]]'' (1993)
* ''[[Fresh (1994 film)|Fresh]]'' (1994)
* ''[[The Best Man (1999 film)|The Best Man]]'' (1999)
* ''[[The Wire]]'' (2002–2008){{sfnp|Trotta|Blyahher|2011}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dialectblog.com/2011/08/09/accents-in-the-wire/ |title=Language Log on the Accents in "The Wire" |first=Ben T. |last=Smith |date=9 August 2011 |website=dialect blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In education ==
{{main|African-American Vernacular English and education}}

Nonstandard African-American varieties of English have been stereotypically associated with a lower level of education and low social status. Since the 1960s, however, linguists have demonstrated that each of these varieties, and namely [[African-American Vernacular English]], is a "legitimate, rule-governed, and fully developed dialect".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=L. Bond|first=Bowie|date=1994|title=Influencing Future Teachers' Attitudes toward Black English: Are We Making a Difference?|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022487194045002005?journalCode=jtea|journal=Journal of Teacher Education|volume=45|pages=112|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The techniques used to improve the proficiency of African-American students learning standard written English have sometimes been similar to that of teaching a second language.&lt;ref name="using_ebonics"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ascd.org/publications/classroom-leadership/apr1999/Using-Ebonics-or-Black-English-as-a-Bridge-to-Teaching-Standard-English.aspx|title=Using Ebonics or Black English as a Bridge to Teaching Standard English|last=ASCD|website=www.ascd.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Contrastive analysis]] is used for teaching topics in African-American Vernacular English. Both the phonological and syntactic features of a student's speech can be analyzed and recorded in order to identify points for contrast with Standard American English.&lt;ref name="using_ebonics" /&gt; Another way AAE can be taught is based on a strategy, communicative flexibility, that focuses on language used at home and analyzes speech during dramatic play.&lt;ref name="writing_instruction"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Glover|first=Crystal|date=2013-03-01|title=Effective Writing Instruction for African American English|url=https://journals.uncc.edu/urbaned/article/view/26/20|journal=Urban Education Research &amp; Policy Annuals|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|issn=2164-6406}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using this method, children are taught to recognize when SAE is being used and in which occasions, rather than conforming to the speech around them in order to sound correct.&lt;ref name="writing_instruction" /&gt;

Although the stigmatization of AAE has continued, AAE remains because it has functioned as a social identity marker for many African-Americans.&lt;ref name="ebonics_SE"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mufwene.uchicago.edu/gurt99.html|title=Salikoko Mufwene: Ebonics and Standard English in the Classroom: Some Issues|website=mufwene.uchicago.edu|access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal with teaching SAE is not to end its use, but to help students differentiate between settings where its use is and is not appropriate.&lt;ref name="ebonics_SE" /&gt;

'''''All the Women Are White, All the Blacks Are Men, But Some of Us Are Brave''''' (1982) is a landmark [[Feminism|feminist]] [[anthology]] in Black Women's Studies printed in numerous editions, co-edited by [[Akasha Gloria Hull]], [[Patricia Bell-Scott]], and [[Barbara Smith]].&lt;ref name="Butsomeofus_1982"&gt;{{cite book|title = All the Women Are White, All the Blacks Are Men, But Some of Us Are Brave: Black Women's Studies |caption =  |editor1-first=Akasha Gloria |editor1-last=Hull|editor2-first = Patricia |editor2-last=Bell-Scott|editor3-first=Barbara |editor3-last=Smith|publisher = [[Feminist Press]] |date=1982|location=[[Old Westbury, New York]]|pages=401|isbn=0912670959 |oclc=8165060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Hull received the National Institute's Women of Color Award for her contribution to this book. Her contribution to this "landmark scholarship directed attention to the lives of Black women and, combined with the numerous articles she wrote thereafter, helped remedy the emphasis within Feminist Studies on white women and within Black studies on Black men".&lt;ref name=Warrior&gt;{{cite web |title=Word Warrior: Local poet helped forge links between feminism, black power, and new literature |first=Ryan|last= Masters |date=January 29, 2004 |work=Monterey County Weekly |url=http://m.montereycountyweekly.com/news/2004/jan/29/word-warrior/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130129074239/http://m.montereycountyweekly.com/news/2004/jan/29/word-warrior/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 29, 2013 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Context==
{{Further|First-wave feminism|Second-wave feminism|Third-wave feminism|Fourth-wave feminism}}

The interest in [[black feminism]] was on the rise in the 1970s, through the writings of [[Mary Helen Washington]], [[Audre Lorde]], [[Alice Walker]], and others.&lt;ref name="Spencer"&gt;{{citation|editor2-last=Spencer |editor2-first=Stephen |series=On Hurston's Contribution to the Canon |title=Bloom's Guides - Zora Neale Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God |editor-first=Harrold |editor-last=Bloom |location=New York |publisher=Infobase Publishing |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|87}}

In 1981, the anthology ''[[This Bridge Called My Back]]'', edited by [[Cherríe Moraga]] and [[Gloria E. Anzaldúa]], was published and ''But Some of Us Are Brave'' was published the following year. In both anthologies, the emphasis was placed on the intersection between race and gender. The contributors argued that previous waves of feminism had focused on issues related to white women. They wanted to negotiate a large space for women of color. According to [[Teresa de Lauretis]], ''This Bridge Called My Back'' and ''But Some Women Are Brave'' revealed "the feelings, the analyses, and the political positions of feminists of color, and their critiques of white or mainstream feminism" and created a "shift in feminist consciousness."&lt;ref name=delauretis&gt;de Lauretis, Teresa, "The Technology of Gender" in {{cite book

==Impact==
In the 2000 reprint of their anthology, editors Hull, Bell-Scott, and Smith described how in 1992 black feminists mobilized "a remarkable national response" - ''African American Women in Defense of Ourselves'' - to the controversy&lt;ref name="all the women_2000"&gt;{{cite book|title=But Some Of Us Are Brave: All the Women Are White, All the Blacks Are Men: Black Women's Studies |editor1-first=Akasha Gloria |editor1-last=Hull|editor2-first = Patricia |editor2-last=Bell-Scott|editor3-first=Barbara |editor3-last=Smith|publisher=Feminist Press at CUNY|year=2000|page=xvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xvi}} surrounding the [[Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination|nomination]] of [[Clarence Thomas]] to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] against the backdrop of allegations by law professor [[Anita Hill]], about [[sexual harassment]] that became part of Thomas' confirmation hearings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Excerpt from Nina Totenberg's breaking National Public Radio report on Anita Hill's accusation of sexual harassment by Clarence Thomas.|url=http://jwa.org/feminism/_html/_transcripts/transcript_JWA071a.htm|accessdate=October 5, 2008|date=October 6, 1991|publisher=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/12/us/the-thomas-nomination-excerpts-from-senate-s-hearings-on-the-thomas-nomination.html |title=The Thomas Nomination; Excerpts From Senate's Hearings on the Thomas Nomination |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 12, 1991 |access-date=October 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal scholar [[Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw|Kimberlé Crenshaw]] cited ''But Some of Us Are Brave'', at the beginning of her seminal 1989 paper, "Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics" in which she introduced the concept of [[Intersectionality]]. Crenshaw is known for introducing and developing [[Intersectionality|intersectional theory]] to feminism.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/lifestyle/2014/04/kimberl-crenshaw-intersectionality-i-wanted-come-everyday-metaphor-anyone-could|first=Bim|last=Adewunmi|title=Kimberlé Crenshaw on intersectionality: 'I wanted to come up with an everyday metaphor that anyone could use'|work=[[New Statesman]] |date=April 2, 2014|access-date=March 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crenshaw noted that it was one of the "very few Black women's studies books". She used the title ''All the Women Are White; All the Blacks Are Men, But Some of Us are Brave'', as her "point of departure" to "develop a Black feminist criticism".&lt;ref name="Crenshaw 1989"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Crenshaw | first = Kimberlé | author-link =Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw| title = Demarginalizing the intersection of race and sex: a Black feminist critique of antidiscrimination doctrine, feminist theory and antiracist politics | journal = [[University of Chicago Legal Forum]], special issue: Feminism in the Law: Theory, Practice and Criticism | pages = 139–168 | publisher = [[University of Chicago Law School]] | date = 1989| url = https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1052&amp;context=uclf |access-date=October 7, 2018 |oclc=

Barbara Y.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5559">'''Arirang-2''', also known as '''KOMPSAT-2''', is a [[South Korea]]n multipurpose [[reconnaissance satellite]].  It was launched from [[Plesetsk Cosmodrome]], Russia at 4:05 PM [[Korea Standard Time|KST]] on 28 July 2006.  It began to transmit signals at 11 PM the same day.  Like the earlier [[Arirang-1]] satellite, it takes its name from the popular Korean folk song [[Arirang]]. Its launch was the culmination of a project begun in 1999.

Arirang-2 orbits at a height of 685 kilometers, circling the Earth 14 times per day, and is expected to maintain that orbit for 3 years.  It weighs 765 kilograms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreaherald.co.kr/SITE/data/html_dir/2006/07/28/200607280025.asp|title=Multipurpose satellite Arirang 2 set for launch|work=Korea Herald, ''28 July 2006''|accessdate=29 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The satellite carries a high-powered digital camera which can distinguish to a 1-meter resolution, allowing the identification of individual vehicles on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/200607/kt2006072317294410440.htm|work=Korea Times ''23 July 2006''|title=Arirang-2 to Monitor North Korea|accessdate=29 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among other purposes, this will allow the South Korean intelligence service to observe North Korean military activities. Prior to the launch of this satellite, the South Koreans had been largely dependent upon surveillance information provided by the [[United States]].

The satellite was succeeded by Arirang-3 and Arirang-3A, which were launched on 2012 and 2015 respectively.
== History ==
South Korea started the KOMPSAT programme in 1995 to nurture its national Earth-imaging industry and supply services for remote-sensing applications.
The South Korean KOMPSAT-2 Earth-imaging satellite was developed by KARI (Korea Aerospace Research Institute), in partnership with EADS Astrium, to assure continuity with the KOMPSAT-1 satellite launched in 1999. KOMPSAT-2 was orbited on 28 July 2006 by a Rockot launcher from Plessetsk, Russia. [[Spot Image]] was the distributor of KOMPSAT-2 imagery until April, 2011. [[SI Imaging Services]] is the worldwide exclusive distributor of KOMPSAT imagery including KOMPSAT-2 since November, 2012.

== Technologies ==

=== Orbit ===
KOMPSAT-2 operates in a near-polar, circular Sun-synchronous orbit. The orbital parameters are:
*Mean altitude: 685&amp;nbsp;km
*Mass: 800&amp;nbsp;kg
*Inclination: 98° (Sun-synchronous)
*Orbital period: 1 h 38 min 27 s
*Orbital cycle: 28 d

=== Instruments ===
KOMPSAT-2’s instruments are designed to acquire high- and very-high-resolution imagery with a footprint of 15&amp;nbsp;km. The satellite has the capacity to acquire 20 minutes of imagery on each orbit and it can steer its sensors both ways out to 30° off track. Panchromatic and multispectral images can be acquired at the same time.

|}

=== Ground receiving stations ===
Two receiving stations deliver KOMPSAT-2 imagery 1 to 3 days after acquisition and in under 24 hours in Europe. The Deajeon station in South Korea is responsible for tasking the satellite. The Toulouse station in France is responsible for updating the catalogue, producing imagery and delivering it to its customers.

== Advantages and applications of KOMPSAT-2 imagery ==
KOMPSAT-2 is designed for very-high-resolution (VHR) remote-sensing applications, such as:
*Land planning: to detect and identify features smaller than 1 sq.m., e.g. vehicles, street furnishings, roads and bushes
*Agriculture: to pinpoint crop or tree diseases
*Urban planning and demographics: to locate detached houses
*Defence: to describe high-value assets or military sites
*Civil engineering: to plan road, railroad and oil pipeline corridors

[[File:Bhavai Artist.jpg|thumb|Bhavai, Artist]]

'''Bhavai''', also known as '''''Vesha''''' or '''''Swang''''', is a popular folk theatre form of western India, especially in [[Gujarat]].

==Etymology ==
''Bhavai'' may derive from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''Bhava'', meaning expression or emotion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is also associated with Hindu goddess [[Durga|Amba]]. ''Bhav'' means universe and ''Aai'' means mother, so it may be considered an art form dedicated to the Mother of the Universe, Amba. Bhavai is also known as ''Vesha'' or ''Swang'', which literally means 'get-up'.&lt;ref name=as&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6ZrjC24PuDQC&amp;pg=PA173&amp;lpg=PA174&amp;focus=viewport&amp;dq=bhavai&amp;output=html_text|title=History of Indian Theatre|volume=2|first=Manohar Laxman|last=Varadpande|isbn=9788170172789|publisher=Abhinav Publications|year=1992|pages=173–174}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=enc&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ienxrTPHzzwC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;vq=bhavai&amp;dq=bhavai&amp;output=html_text&amp;source=gbs_search_r&amp;cad=1|title=South Asian Folklore: An Encyclopedia : Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka|first=Peter J.

==History==
Bhavai is believed to have originated in the 14th century. Asaita Thakar is traditionally credited for its origin.&lt;ref name=as/&gt;&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;&lt;ref name=cam/&gt;&lt;ref name="Datta1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=Amaresh Datta|title=Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature: A-Devo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ObFCT5_taSgC&amp;pg=PA236|year=1987|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=978-81-260-1803-1|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Folklore===
In 14th century, Ganga, a daughter of [[Unjha]] headman Hema Patel, was kidnapped by Muslim [[subedar]]. Their family priest, Asaita Thakar who was a [[brahmin]], went to subedar claiming Ganga as his daughter. To prove, subedar asked him to dine with Ganga as during those time, brahmins did not dine with lower castes. He dined with her to save her but upon return, he was outcaste by Brahmins. He started performing plays to earn his living which developed into specific dramatic form. Out of gratitude, Hema Patel also gave him a plot of land and financial support which mark the start of patronage of ''Bhavaiya'', the performers of Bhavai, by villages.&lt;ref name=as/&gt;&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;&lt;ref name=cam/&gt;&lt;ref name="Datta1987"/&gt;

It is believed that Asaita Thakar wrote about 360 plays or ''Vesha'' (lit. dress) but only 60 have survived including some with his own names. In one of his plays, Asaita had dated his composition as AD 1360.&lt;ref name=as/&gt;&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;&lt;ref name=cam/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Bhavai performance appear clearly to have evolved from earlier forms of folk entertainment. It may have originated from medieval Sanskrit ''uparupaka (''forms) which were performed in open.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The word Bhavai in the sense of show or spectacle occurs in the 13th century [[Apabhramsa]] [[Jain]] religious verse. It says: "In a tree-less tract even a bunch of eranda (caster oil plant) makes a good show (Bhavai)." [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abul Fazal]]’s [[Ain-e-Akbari]] also mentions Bhavai while mentioning some communities.&lt;ref name=as/&gt;&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;

The Bhavai performers belong to a [[caste]] that came to be known as ''Taragala''.&lt;ref name=as/&gt;&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;&lt;ref name="Datta1987"/&gt;

==Overview==
Bhavai is partly entertainment and partly a ritual offering made to Goddess Amba.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is performed in open spaces in front of the temple.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the courtyard of the [[Ambaji]] temple near Mount Abu the Navratri festival is celebrated with Bhavai performances. Amba is the presiding deity of Bhavai.&lt;ref name=as/&gt;&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;&lt;ref name=cam/&gt;

Subtle social criticism laced with pungent humour is the speciality of Bhavai. The pompous and incongrous behaviour of high caste people is scoffed at in Bhavai. Probably the anger over injustice suffered by the originator of Bhavai, Asaita Thakar, permeated the art of Bhavai. Some of the Bhavai plays present a scathing review of the caste-ridden social structure. People belonging to different levels of social strata ranging from king to knave are portrayed in Bhavai.&lt;ref name=as/&gt;&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;&lt;ref name=cam/&gt;

==Bhavai plays==
Bhavai Veshas portray people from all classes of society. The barbers and knife-sharpeners, robbers, bangle sellers and social and economic thieves, banjaras, odas, darjis, fakirs and sadhus. There is a Vesha depicting the story of an unsuccessful love affair of a Bania woman and a [[Muslim]] Thanedar. At the end of the play [[Jasma Odan]], a Muslim fakir appears to whom people request to revive Jasma.&lt;ref name=as/&gt;&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;&lt;ref name=cam/&gt;

Humor plays a vital part in any Bhavai performance and comes into play even while dealing with mythological personages. This predominance makes Bhavai unique among the traditional arts of India.&lt;ref name=as/&gt;&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;&lt;ref name=cam/&gt;

The chief of the Bhavai troupe is called the [[Nayak (title)|Nayak]]. He first marks the performing arena, then offers [[Kumkuma|kumkum]] to the oil-torch or earthen lamp which is a symbol of goddess Amba and sings prayer songs in her praise.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Then enters an actor covering his face with a plate, he is Lord [[Ganesha]], the remover of obstacles. Goddess [[Kali]] is the next to enter and after she departs comes the [[Brahmana]]. The Vesha actually starts only after these preliminary appearances.&lt;ref name=as/&gt;&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;&lt;ref name=cam/&gt;

The Nayak and the jester always remain on stage and direct the course of action with their commentary and intervention. The story unfolds through songs, dialogues and speeches in prose as well as verse. There is lot of dancing and singing in Bhavai. Female characters are acted by men.&lt;ref name=as/&gt;&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;&lt;ref name=cam/&gt;

The language of Bhavai is a blend of [[Hindi]], [[Urdu]], and Marwari. Veshas were published for the first time in the nineteenth century and performances were linked to their predecessors through practice and the oral tradition.&lt;ref name=as/&gt;&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;&lt;ref name=cam/&gt;

The Bhungal is a four feet long copper pipe that provides a strong note and is unique to Bhavai. The bhungals are played during dance sequences and otherwise to indicate important characters. Other musical instruments that Bhavai performances include the [[pakhawaj]] (drums), [[jhanjha]] (cymbals), the [[sarangi]] (a stringed instrument), and the harmonium. The style of music is always [[Hindustani music]] interspersed with local tunes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=as/&gt;&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;&lt;ref name=cam/&gt;

Bhavai is also prevalent in Rajasthan as a folk dance called [[Bhavai dance]].

==Contemporary performances==
[[Muljibhai Nayak]], [[Pransukh Nayak]], and Chimanlal Naik are some well known Bhavai performers of 20th century. With advent of cinema and television, the entertainment in village changed radically and the popularity of Bhavai declined and is decaying. The modern [[Gujarati theatre]] people tried to revive it with new plays but no coordinated effort is carried out.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''Jasma Odan'' based on Gujarati folk tale, written and directed by [[Shanta Gandhi]]; Rasiklal Parikh's ''Mena Gurjari'' (Mena of Gujarat, 1953) produced by [[Deena Gandhi]] and [[C. C. Mehta]]'s ''Hololika'' (1956) were some of the most popular Bhavai musicals of modern times.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2006/20060611/spectrum/main2.htm|title=From Gujarat with grace |date=June 11, 2006|publisher=The Tribune|accessdate=5 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Dear, Michael J., H. Eric Schockman, and Greg Hise, eds. ''Rethinking Los Angeles'' (1996) interprets LA in terms of "postmodern urbanism" model. It consists of several fundamental characteristics: a global-local connection; a ubiquitous social polarization; and a reterritorialization of the urban process in which hinterland organizes the center (in direct contradiction to the Chicago School model of cities). The resultant urbanism is distinguished by a centerless urban form termed "keno capitalism."

[[File:Cafedudome2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Le Dôme Café]] in Paris.]]
'''Café society''' was the description of the "Beautiful People" and "Bright Young Things" who gathered in fashionable cafes and restaurants in New York, Paris, and London beginning in the late 19th century. [[Maury Henry Biddle Paul]] is credited with coining the phrase "cafe society" in 1915. [[Lucius Beebe]] created the term "chromium mist" for the cafe society lifestyle he chronicled in his weekly column, ''This New York,'' for the'' [[New York Herald Tribune]]'' during the 1920s and 1930s.

They attended each other's private dinners and balls, and took holidays in exotic locations or at elegant resorts. In the United States, café society came to the fore with the end of [[Repeal of Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] in December 1933 and the rise of [[photojournalism]], to describe the set of people who tended to do their entertaining semi-publicly, in restaurants and night clubs, and who would include among them movie stars and sports celebrities. Some of the American night clubs and New York City restaurants frequented by the denizens of café society included the [[21 Club]], [[El Morocco]], Restaurant Larue, and the [[Stork Club]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Cavender]], who compiled the work under the [[anagrammatic]] [[pen name]] of '''H.C. Decanver'''.&lt;ref name="Catalogue of Works in Refutation of Methodism: Reference 1"/&gt;

A [[reference work]] of [[religious criticism]], the ''Catalogue'' is Decanver's debut publication, and his only written work. It is notable as one of the most prominent writings critical of [[Methodist]] doctrine ever written, and remains the only compilation of books written from a primarily anti-Methodist perspective.

== Background ==

An otherwise virtually unknown individual, the only evidence which suggests that the author Decanver ever existed was the publication of his ''Catalogue'' in 1846. He was self-evidently opposed to the doctrines of [[Methodism]], a branch of [[Protestant Christianity]] which emerged from the teachings of [[John Wesley]] in 18th century England, and in 1846 compiled the catalogue under the full [[title]] of '''''Catalogue of Works in Refutation of Methodism: from its Origin in 1729, to the Present Time: of Those by Methodist Authors on Lay-Representation, Methodist Episcopacy, Etc., Etc., and of the Political Pamphlets Relating to Wesley's "Calm Address to Our American Colonies"'''''.&lt;ref name="Catalogue of Works in Refutation of Methodism: Reference 1"/&gt; The pseudonym "H.C. Decanver" is an anagram of the author's actual name, Curtis H. Cavender.

The book was first published in both hardback and paperback by the presently-defunct [[John Penington (publisher)|John Penington]] publishing company, once located on 10 South Fifth Street in eastern [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name="Catalogue of Works in Refutation of Methodism: Reference 3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.hsp.org/collections/manuscripts/p/penington1435.htm |title=Penington Family Papers, The Historical Society of Pennsylvania |first= |last= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |month= |year= |work= |publisher=The Historical Society of Pennsylvania |location=Philadelphia |page= |pages= |at= |trans-title=|doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=3 April 2010 |quote=The eldest of the children of Edward and Sarah Shoemaker Penington, John, devoted his professional life to the literary pursuits his father favored. Born on August 1, 1799, John Penington was the proprietor of a well-known Philadelphia bookshop at '''10 South Fifth Street''', specializing in international trade, rare books, and classical texts both in their original languages and in translation. |ref= |separator= |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original printings were attributed to an individual "C. Sherman, printer" from 19 St. James Street in the same city.&lt;ref name="Catalogue of Works in Refutation of Methodism: Reference 1"/&gt;

There are several editions of the book, some including minor changes deviating from former editions.

The catalogue as a whole lists over 100 individual documents, books, pamphlets and articles — many of which today are regarded as historical texts. As a whole the works listed assumedly refute certain doctrines of Methodist thought, although – if somewhat ironically – many of them are by Methodist authors themselves.

== Contents ==

The book is divided into two sections, the first being a [[preface]]                    entitled either "Prefatory Remarks" or "Preliminary Remarks", depending upon the edition of the book (the first edition of the work was printed containing the latter title), and the second being the catalogue proper – in all editions simply deemed "Catalogue". The Catalogue section is itself divided further, the first group of works representing those called "Anti-Methodistical", the second group listed under "Methodist Authors" (being by Methodist authors themselves), the third called "Miscellaneous", and the last group listed as "Political".

'''Collaborative fiction''' is a form of [[writing]] by a group of three or more authors who share creative control of a [[Storytelling|story]].{{citation needed|reason=Exactly how does the seemingly arbitrary minimum of three authors arise?|date=August 2018}}

Collaborative fiction can occur for commercial gain, as part of education, or recreationally – many collaboratively written works have been the subject of a large degree of academic research.

== Process ==
{{Quote box
| quote = Our overall process changes from book to book. Usually while I'm working on another project, Mary will come up with an idea, run it by me for my input, then get on with plotting and research. Nothing's ever set in concrete. No two books follow quite the same procedure.
| source = The author [[Dixie Browning|Bronwyn Williams]]&lt;ref name="McGoldrickMcGoldrick200079"&gt;[[#McGoldrickMcGoldrick2000|McGoldrick]], p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Collaboration|collaborative]] author may focus on a specific [[protagonist]] or character in the [[narrative thread]], and then pass the story to another writer for further additions or a change in focus to a different protagonist. Alternatively, authors might write the text for their own particular [[subplot]] within an overall narrative, in which case one author may have the responsibility of integrating the story as a whole. In Italy, various groups of authors have developed more advanced methods of interaction and production&lt;ref&gt;https://readingitaly.wordpress.com/2016/10/03/collective-writing-memory/&lt;/ref&gt;

The methods used by commercial collaborative writers vary tremendously. When beginning writing the short story 'the toy mill' [[Karl Schroeder]] and David Nickle began by writing alternating sentences,&lt;ref name="mcGoldrick85"&gt;[[#McGoldrickMcGoldrick2000|McGoldrick]] p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; whereas when English authors [[Terry Pratchett]] and [[Neil Gaiman]] wrote ''[[Good Omens]]'' they largely wrote separate plotlines and then collaborated much more heavily when revising the manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;[[#neil|Neil Gaiman's Journal]], 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The collaboration may be very limited indeed, when [[John Green (author)|John Green]] and [[David Levithan]] wrote ''[[Will Grayson, Will Grayson]]'' the only plot point they decided on  was that two characters would meet at some point in the novel and that their meeting would have a tremendous effect on their lives. After this decision, they separately wrote the first three chapters for their half and then shared them with each other. After sharing, they then "knew immediately it was going to work", as stated by Levithan.&lt;ref&gt;[[#seattle|The Seattle Times, April 30th 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#sanfran|San Francisco Chronicle, May 12th 2010]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic perspectives and projects ==
&lt;!--the redirect from collaborative authorship goes to this section --&gt;
From an academic perspective, there is anxiety about collaborative authorial endeavors.  Academics are concerned with being able to discover who wrote what, and which ideas belong to whom.&lt;ref&gt;[[#york|York]], p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, in the humanities collaborative authorship has been frowned upon in favor of the individual author. In these instances, antiquated ideas of individual genius influence how scholars look at issues of attribution and tenure.&lt;ref name="ede"&gt;[[#ede|Ede &amp; Lunsford (2001)]],pp. 354–69&lt;/ref&gt; Collaboration scholars Ede and Lunsford note, "everyday practices in the humanities continue to ignore, or even to punish, collaboration while authorizing work attributed to (autonomous) individuals".&lt;ref name="ede" /&gt; In particular, literary-critical essays often move to "settle" questions of authorship before moving on to their central interpretive purposes.&lt;ref name="Masten1997"&gt;[[#textual|Masten (1997)]], p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; 
Woodmansee uses studies of writing practices since the Renaissance to conclude that  the modern definition of authorship, is a 'relatively recent formation'  and that previously 'more corporate and collaborative' forms of writing prevailed,&lt;ref name="WoodmanseeJaszi1994"&gt;[[#woodmansee|Woodmansee]]&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting a long history of Collaborative Fiction. She further argues that the concept that 'genuine authorship consists in individual acts of origination' is an entirely modern myth.&lt;ref name="WoodmanseeJaszi1994"/&gt;

For Renaissance playwrights, collaboration appears to have been the norm, Bently notes that nearly two-thirds of plays mentioned in Henslowe's papers reflect the participation of more than one writer.&lt;ref name="Bentley1971"&gt;[[#bentley1971|Bentley (1971)]], p.199&lt;/ref&gt; There is also an issue of continuous revision, it was common practice in [[Renaissance English theatre]] for professional writers attached to a company to compose new characters, scenes, prologues and epilogues for plays in which they did not originally have a hand.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[[#textual|Masten (1997)]], p 14&lt;/ref&gt; Scott McMillin has exported revision as a deconstruction of authorial individuality in the [[Sir Thomas More]] manuscript.&lt;ref name="McMillin1987"&gt;[[#McMillin1987|McMillin (1987)]], pp. 153–159&lt;/ref&gt;

In an artistic sense, as Lorraine York notes, "Critics and readers feel a persistent need to 'de-collaborate' these works, to parse the collective text into the separate contributions of two or more authors".&lt;ref&gt;[[#york|York]], p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; This is part of a tradition in criticism to view collaboration as a subset or aberrant kind of individual authorship – such that later readers could separate out by examining the collaborative text.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[[#textual|Masten (1997)]], p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Particular examples of this approach to criticism include [[Cyrus Hoy]] who studies authorship in the [[Beaumont/Fletcher plays]].&lt;ref name="Masten1997" /&gt;

There have been several university-based projects that investigated collaborative fiction, both from a writing perspective and as a testbed for scientific techniques, such as visualization of narrative structure.&lt;ref name="scientists "&gt;[[#scientists|Murtagh et al(2010)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Caverns'' ===
{{See also|Caverns (novel)| l1=''Caverns'' (novel)}}
''Caverns'' is a 1989 novel written collaboratively as an experiment by [[Ken Kesey]] and a creative writing class that he taught at the [[University of Oregon]].  The cover of the book says it was written by O.U. Levon—the name of this supposed author, spelled backwards, is "novel U.O." (University of Oregon).&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;[[#NYT|New York Times (January 21, 1990)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of Kesey's attachment to the project, the book was widely reviewed in newspapers and magazines.  Critics were generally intrigued by the book but ultimately critical of its shortcomings: noting in particular the lack of a coherent voice and a too-large cast of characters.  Writing in ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'', [[Bob Sipchen]] noted, "''Caverns'' is an amusing lark, full of weird characters and goofy plot twists. It was a sufficiently intriguing project to make The Mainstream Media swarm around Kesey again.  But no one is calling ''Caverns'' literature."&lt;ref name=LAT&gt;[[#LAT|The Los Angeles Times (February 11, 1990)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''A Million Penguins'' ===
The first well-known wikinovel was ''A Million Penguins'', an experimental work launched in 2007 by [[Penguin Books]] in collaboration with [[Kate Pullinger]] on behalf of the Institute of Creative Technologies at [[De Montfort University]], apparently inspired by the success of [[Wikipedia]]. Its website was heavily advertised&lt;ref name="a wiki-novelty"/&gt; and it quickly became a target for [[vandalism]].&lt;ref name=researchReport /&gt; On March 7, 2007, the Penguin Books UK [[blog]] announced that the project had come to an end.&lt;ref&gt;[[#sleep|Penguin Blog, March 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The story could be contributed to by any site visitor, although a team of students at the University moderated contributions, in an attempt to keep the project on-track.&lt;ref name=researchReport /&gt;  Due to the site receiving more than 100 edits every hour, Penguin imposed "reading windows"&lt;ref name="a wiki-novelty"&gt;[http://www.futureofthebook.org The Institute For The Future Of The Book]&lt;/ref&gt; that froze the novel so that editors could read over what had been changed to get their bearings on where the story was going.

Reactions to the project were mixed, with some commentators expressing interest in seeing how the project took shape, including the potential educational benefits&lt;ref&gt;[[#educaus|Alexander (2008)]]&lt;/ref&gt; while some described its progress as "predictably horrible".&lt;ref name="millionPenguins"&gt;[[#millionPenguins|Bloomberg.com, 2007-02-07]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2008, the Institute of Creative Technologies of De Montfort University published ''A Million Penguins Research Report'', which concluded:

{{quote|Certainly, some of the participants in the project did attempt to 'write a novel' but it remains unclear as to whether they succeeded. What today appears not to be a novel as we know it may in time come to be seen as one, just as work once judged not to be poetry is often later brought into the critical fold. But for the moment at least the answer to whether or not a community can write a novel appears to be 'not like this'. Our research has shown that "A Million Penguins" is something other than a novel and, thereby, opened up new questions and avenues for exploration. It has treated the final product not as a variation of a printed novel or something which could be turned into one, but as type of performance. The contributors did not form a community, rather they spontaneously organised themselves into a diverse, riotous assembly. We have demonstrated that the wiki novel experiment was the wrong way to try to answer the question of whether a community could write a novel, but as an adventure in exploring new forms of publishing, authoring and collaboration it was, ground-breaking and exciting.&lt;ref name=researchReport &gt;[[#report|''A Million Penguins Research Report''(2008)]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== ''The Painted Sky'' and ''The Shifting Light'' ===

=== In Australia ===
Australia has a number of famous writing teams. In 1944 [[James McAuley]] and [[Harold Stewart]] collaborating as [[Ern Malley]] wrote seventeen poems in one day as a hoax against [[Max Harris (poet)|Max Harris]] and his magazine ''[[Angry Penguins]]''. From the late 1920s to the late 1940s [[Flora Eldershaw]] and [[Marjorie Barnard]] wrote under the name of [[M. Barnard Eldershaw]]. During that time they published an impressive body of work that included 5 novels. Evidently Barnard did more of the actual writing whilst Eldershaw concentrated on development and structure of the works. Louise E Rorabacher who wrote about the collaboration stated: "that in their early collaborative novels it is impossible to distinguish their separate contributions." The partnership worked because according to [[Nettie Palmer]], a leading literary critic of the time: "Any difference in the characters of the two women doesn't make for a difference in their point of view or values." [[Dymphna Cusack]] wrote twelve novels, two of which were collaborations. She wrote ''[[Come in Spinner]]'', a novel set in Sydney during the end of World War II, with [[Florence James]]. The completed book was submitted and won the 1948 ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|Daily Telegraph]]'' novel competition. Cusack also collaborated with another writer – [[Miles Franklin]] on the 1939 novel ''Pioneers on Parade''. The 2015 Australian outback novel The Painted Sky was written by a group of five, and its 2017 sequel The Shifting Light by four authors who collaboratively write under the pseudonym [[Alice Campion]]. Both novels were published by Penguin Random House in Australia. As 'Group Fiction', three of the collective have also written a guide to collaborative fiction writing called How to Write Fiction as a Group.

== Community and educational uses ==
[[File:826Books.jpg|thumb|Selection of books written collaboratively as part of the 826 Valencia Project]]

Collaborative writing has been used to increase community engagement in writing: one of the three 2008 [[TED (conference)|TED]] Prizes was given to [[Dave Eggers]], partially for his work with the [[826 Valencia|826 project]], which uses many collaborative techniques to engage school children, and community groups in writing. The 826 Valencia chapter consists of a writing lab, a street-front pirate supply store that partially funds the programs, and two satellite classrooms in nearby middle &lt;!-- need to sort out the americanisation here--&gt; schools. Over 1,400 volunteers—including published authors, magazine founders, SAT-course instructors, and documentary filmmakers—have donated time to work with thousands of students since the chapter was founded.&lt;ref name="TEDprize"&gt;[[#TEDprize|TED blog (2008)]]&lt;/ref&gt; His TED Prize wish was for community members to personally engage with local public schools.&lt;ref&gt;[[#tedtalk|Dave Eggers TED talk(2008)]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#tedprize|TED Prize (2008)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other educationally motivated work has been developed by the [[University of London]] and used both to improve the writing skills of the participants and as a testing ground for scientific techniques, such as visualization of narrative structure.&lt;ref name="scientists " /&gt;&lt;!-- next ref is for the scientific stuff rather than the collaborative stuff – this project isn't mentioned but the uses are... not sure if it counts--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#ratings|The Guardian (December 01, 2009)]]&lt;/ref&gt; The project attempted to show students the workflow of a novel from inception to production and to improve teamwork and feedback skills.&lt;ref name="WordPlay"&gt;[[#WordPlay|WordPlay 2011]]&lt;/ref&gt; Workshops lasted up to a week and aimed to produce a full-length novel from a plot idea provided by an established author, with younger students producing smaller sized novels.&lt;ref&gt;[[#novel|'Novel' idea taken to schools to encourage budding young authors']]&lt;/ref&gt; Because the workshops were very short the use of collaborative writing was required so that a novel could be produced in the timeframe.&lt;ref name="WordPlay" /&gt;  Techniques from [[software engineering]] were used to arrange the workload amongst the students.&lt;ref name="WordPlay" /&gt;

== Recreational collaborative writing ==
{{See also|Storytelling game|Role-playing game}}
Collaborative [[fiction]] can be fully open with no rules or enforced structure as it moves from author to author; however, many collaborative fiction works adopt some set of rule on what constitutes an acceptable contribution.&lt;ref name="SpierlingSzilas2008" /&gt;

Writing games for collaborative writing have a tradition in literary groups such as the [[dadaism|Dadaists]] and the [[Oulipo]]. The advent of the [[internet]] has seen many such collaborative writing games go online, resulting both in [[hypertext fiction]] and in more conventional literary production. For example, the [[Baen's bar]] forum, known as [[1632 Tech]], has been a prime force behind the many works in the popular [[alternate history]] [[1632 series]] under the aegis of [[Eric Flint]] — especially [[The Grantville Gazettes]]. Author and scholar Scott Rettber's paper "Collective Narrative" discusses connections between [[Avant-garde|avant garde]] literary groups and online collaborative fiction.&lt;ref name="scott"&gt;[[#scott|Scott (2011)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influence of tabletop gaming ===
Other forms of collaborative fiction have evolved from the practices of [[tabletop role-playing game|tabletop]] and [[role-playing video game]] gamers and related '[[fandom]]' activities. Role-playing games such as [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons|Dungeons and Dragons]] are often seen as a process to generate narratives though each characters interactions&lt;ref name="SpierlingSzilas2008"&gt;[[#SpierlingSzilas2008|Spierling &amp; Szilas (2008)]], p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;
Such table top role-playing has always been an exercise in collaborative fiction, but can possess more structured rules: players acting out in an antisocial way can be penalised by the game mechanics (though they are just as likely to be penalised socially).&lt;ref name="Harrigan2004"&gt;[[#Harrigan2004|Harrigan (2004)]], p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, these tabletop behaviors merged with hypertext fiction to create text-based interactive role-playing environments, like roleplaying [[MUSH]]es. In 2001, [[OtherSpace]] became the first such game to publish a novel taken from these interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Platt | first = Wes | authorlink = Wes Platt| title = OtherSpace: End of the World, Arcs IV-V| publisher = [[iUniverse]]| year = 2002| isbn = 978-0595230464| pages = ix-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== World creation ====
[[Ring of Fire (series)]], a series of alternate history books by Eric Flint and other authors set in a universe created by Eric Flint with the intention of integrating multiple authors into the fabric of the universe structure.

Sites such as [[Orion's Arm]],  [[Galaxiki]], and [[Epic Legends Of The Hierarchs: The Elemenstor Saga]] encourage the development of fictional universes rather than novels (though 'Epic Legends' is parody of fantasy universes).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orionsarm.com Orions arm universe project]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Online collaboration platforms ==
With the development of the internet collaborative writing is gaining new relevance with various online collaborative writing platforms emerging. Most popular are [[Collaborative real-time editor|collaborative real-time editors]] such as [[Etherpad]] and [[Google Docs]] which are however mostly used for coordinating projects and brainstorming. Nevertheless, they have also been used to collectively write works of fiction, such as ''The Legacy of Totalitarianism in a Tundra'' &lt;!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Fixuture/The_Legacy_of_Totalitarianism_in_a_Tundra ; more examples needed--&gt; – an over 300 page book written by &lt;!-- 3532 --&gt;anonymous users of the Literature (''/lit/'') board of [[4chan]] from over 71 countries using &lt;!-- a web-app which incorporated --&gt;GoogleDocs.{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}

== Commercial collaborations ==
Traditional [[fiction]] writers and [[writing circle]]s have experimented in creating group stories, such as [[Robert Asprin]]'s [[Thieves World]] and [[MythAdventures]] – such approaches date back at least as far as ''[[The Floating Admiral]]'' in 1931. There are many highly regarded collaborations, but also some collaborative work produced as spoofs or hoaxes such as ''[[Naked Came the Stranger]]'', which was allegedly written  to illustrate the point that popular American literary culture had become mindlessly vulgar.&lt;ref name="Schroeder1997"&gt;[[#Schroeder1997|Schroeder (1997)]]&lt;/ref&gt;
The Australian genre fiction collaborators known as [[Alice Campion]] are thought to be the first in the world to publish commercial fiction as a team of five, now four. Their popular novels, ''The Painted Sky''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://penguin.com.au/books/the-painted-sky-9780143784630|title=The Painted Sky {{!}} Penguin Books Australia, ISBN 9780857984852, 384 pages|website=penguin.com.au|access-date=2017-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2015) and ''The Shifting Light''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://penguin.com.au/books/the-shifting-light-9780143781110|title=The Shifting Light {{!}} Penguin Books Australia, ISBN 9780143781110, 368 pages|website=penguin.com.au|access-date=2017-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2017) were published by Penguin Random House.

=== Legal aspects ===
The disadvantages of the collaborative writing process can include problems with series or [[sequel]]s to successful books, if one partner has other commitments or is bored with the project, then losses, delays and pressure on the relationship may occur.&lt;ref name="Maass1996"&gt;[[#maass|Maass]], p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; The Association of Authors' Representatives recommends that "a collaboration agreement must deal with termination of the collaboration: How the collaborators can part ways, who keeps the money, who keeps the rights to the material".&lt;ref&gt;[[#minutes|Association of Authors' Representatives, March 4, 1992]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, there can be legal complications if, for example, two authors are under contract to write other books individually for different publishers – if there is any overlap on the types of books then the contractual responsibilities need to be thoroughly examined to avoid copyright problems.&lt;ref name="McGoldrickMcGoldrick200071"&gt;[[#McGoldrickMcGoldrick2000|McGoldrick]], p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Constant visual observation''', often abbreviated to "constant visual", is a term used in various [[Mental Health]] [[Service (economics)|Services]], [[Prison]]s and [[Special School]]s to describe the status of a prisoner or [[patient]] who poses a threat to himself or a third party, and must therefore be kept under constant observation.

There are essentially two levels of constant visual observations. The highest level, employed only for those patients who are considered to be extremely high risk to either themselves or a third party, involves a care worker remaining within arms reach of the service user at all times. The second level involves only maintaining a constant watch on a patient, sometimes from a distance.

Constant visual observations have been criticised by many service user groups.

'''Critical legal studies'''  ('''CLS''') is a school of [[critical theory]] that first emerged as a [[Critical Legal Conference|movement]] in the United States during the 1970s.&lt;ref name = Hunt86&gt;Alan Hunt, "The Theory of Critical Legal Studies," Oxford Journal of Legal Studies, Vol. 6, No. 1 (1986): 1-45, esp. 1, 5.

DOI, 10.1093/ojls/6.1.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Critical Legal Studies adherents claim that laws are used to maintain the [[status quo]] of society's power structures; it is also held that the law is a codified form of society's biases against marginalized groups&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/critical_legal_theory "Critical Legal Theory"], ''Cornell Law School''&gt; Retrieved 2017-08-10.&lt;/ref&gt;. Despite wide variation in the opinions of critical legal scholars around the world there is general consensus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cyber.harvard.edu/bridge/CriticalTheory/critical2.htm|title=legal theory:Critical Legal Studies Movement|publisher=Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts USA (Bridge Program)|accessdate=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; regarding the key goals of Critical Legal Studies:

* to demonstrate the [[ambiguity]] and possible [[preferential attachment|preferential]] outcomes of supposedly impartial and rigid [[legal doctrine]]s.
* to publicize historical, social, economic and psychological [[Outcomes theory|results]] of [[Rational-legal authority|legal decisions]]
* to demystify [[legal positivism|legal analysis]] and [[legal realism|legal culture]] in order to impose [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]] on legal processes so that they earn the general support of [[Social responsibility|socially responsible citizens]]

The abbreviations "'''CLS'''" and "'''Crit'''" are sometimes used to refer to the movement and its adherents.&lt;ref name=TurleyHitchhikers/&gt;

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
Although the intellectual origins of the critical legal studies (CLS) can be generally traced to American [[legal realism]], as a distinct scholarly movement CLS fully emerged only in the late 1970s. Many first-wave American CLS scholars entered legal education, having been profoundly influenced by the experiences of the civil rights movement, women's rights movement, and the anti-war movement of the 1960s and 1970s. What started off as a critical stance towards American domestic politics eventually translated into a critical stance towards the dominant legal ideology of modern Western society. Drawing on both domestic theory and the work of European social theorists, the "crits" sought to demystify what they saw as the numerous myths at the heart of mainstream legal thought and practice.

The British critical legal studies movement started roughly at a similar time as its American counterpart. However, it centered around a number of conferences held annually, particularly the [[Critical Legal Conference]] and the [[National Critical Lawyers Group]]. There remain a number of fault lines in the community; between theory and practice, between those who look to [[Marxism]] and those who worked on [[Deconstruction]], between those who look to explicitly political engagements and those who work in aesthetics and ethics.

==Relation to American legal realism==

Critical legal studies had its intellectual origins in the American legal realist movement in the 1930s. Prior to the 1930s, American jurisprudence had been dominated by a [[legal formalism|formalist]] account of how courts decide cases, an account which held that judges decide cases on the basis of distinctly legal rules and reasons that justify a unique result. The legal realists argued that statutory and case law is indeterminate, and that appellate courts decide cases not based upon law, but upon what they deem fair in light of the facts of a case. Considered "the most important jurisprudential movement of the 20th century",&lt;ref&gt;Leiter, Brian, American Legal Realism. U of Texas Law, Public Law Research Paper No. 42. Available at [http://ssrn.com/abstract=339562 SSRN]. DOI, 10.2139/ssrn.339562.&lt;/ref&gt; American legal realism sent a shock through American legal scholarship by undermining the formalist tenets that were long considered a bedrock of jurisprudence.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

The influence of legal realism unsettled American jurisprudence for decades. Alan Hunt writes that the period "between the realism of the 1930s and the emergence of critical legal studies in the late 1970s has been a series of unsuccessful attempts to recover from the shock of realism some basis for a legal theory which articulates an image of the objectivity of the legal process, even though the explanation offered by post-realism had to be more complex than that provided by a doctrine of rule-following."&lt;ref name = Hunt86/&gt;

==As a literature and a network==

The critical legal studies movement emerged in the mid-1970s as a network of leftist law professors in the United States who developed the realist indeterminacy thesis in the service of leftist ideals. According to Roberto Unger, the movement "continued as an organizing force only until the late 1980s. Its life as a movement lasted for barely more than a decade."&lt;ref name=Unger2015p24&gt;Unger 2015, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Duncan Kennedy, a Harvard law professor who along with Unger was one of the key figures in the movement, has said that, in the early days of critical legal studies, "just about everyone in the network was a white male with some interest in 60s style radical politics or radical sentiment of one kind or another. Some came from Marxist backgrounds--some came from democratic reform."&lt;ref name=Clark94&gt;Gerard J. Clark, "A Conversation with Duncan Kennedy," The Advocate: The Suffolk University Law School Journal, Vol. 24, No. 2 (1994): 56-61. See [http://duncankennedy.net/documents/The%20Advocate_A%20Conversation%20with%20Duncan%20Kennedy.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy has emphasized the twofold nature of critical legal studies, as both a network of leftist scholar/activists and a scholarly literature:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[C]ritical legal studies has two aspects. It’s a scholarly literature and it has also been a network of people who were thinking of themselves as activists in law school politics. Initially, the scholarly literature was produced by the same people who were doing law school activism. Critical legal studies is not a theory. It’s basically this literature produced by this network of people. I think you can identify some themes of the literature, themes that have changed over time.&lt;ref name=Clark94/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Scholars affiliated with critical legal studies often identified with the movement in several ways: by including in their articles an opening footnote mentioning the Conference on Critical Legal Studies and providing the organization’s contact information, by attending conferences of the CCLS, and by citing the work of fellow critical legal studies scholars. A 1984 bibliography of CLS works, compiled by Duncan Kennedy and Karl Klare and published in the Yale Law Journal, included dozens of authors and hundreds of works.&lt;ref name="Karl E. Klare 1984"/&gt;

A 2011 collection of four volumes edited by Costas Douzinas and Colin Perrin, with the assistance of J-M Barreto, compiles the work of the British Critical Legal Studies, including their philosophical mentors. It showcases scholarship elaborated since its origins in the late 1980s in areas such as [[philosophy of law|legal philosophy]], literature, psychoanalysis, aesthetics, feminism, gender, sexuality, post-colonialism, race, ethics, politics and human rights.&lt;ref name=Douzinas2011&gt;Douzinas, Costas and Perrin, Colin. Critical Legal Theory, London: Routledge, 2011. See [https://www.routledge.com/Critical-Legal-Theory/Douzinas-Perrin/p/book/9780415486736].&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, a new perspective is born in Brazil, in the context of Latin America, so called the Theory of Realistic Humanism as a Critical Theory in the Theory of Law.&lt;ref&gt;Bittar, Eduardo C. B.

==Intellectual and political context==

Roberto Unger, a key member of critical legal studies whose influence had continued to be far-reaching in the decades following the movement’s decline, has written that the founders of critical legal studies "never meant it to become an ongoing school of thought or genre of writing. They wanted to intervene in a particular circumstance ..."&lt;ref name=Unger2015p24/&gt;

That circumstance was the dominant practice of legal analysis which Unger calls the "method of reasoned elaboration".&lt;ref&gt;Unger 2015, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  A close descendant of nineteenth-century doctrinal formalism, which sought through legal analysis to identify the "inbuilt legal content of a ... free society",&lt;ref&gt;Unger 2015, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; the method of reasoned elaboration treated law materials as containing an "ideal element", an inherent legal substance underlying the contradictions and ambiguities in the law's text.&lt;ref&gt;Unger 2015, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the practice of reasoned elaboration, this inherent legal substance forms a prescriptive system that judges gradually uncover by reasoning through the policies and principles of law without questioning the "basic institutional arrangements of the market economy, of democratic politics, and of civil society outside the market and the state".&lt;ref&gt;Unger 2015, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reasoned elaboration was a pernicious influence for several reasons, Unger and others argued: it de-emphasized the contingent nature of law as a product of deals and compromise, instead treating it as containing a coherent prescriptive system that needed simply to be uncovered by legal interpretation; it obscured how judges usurp authority by denying their own role in making law; and finally, reasoned elaboration inhibited the use of law as a mechanism of social change.&lt;ref&gt;Unger 2015, p. 11f.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the context of legal interpretation, critical legal studies also emerged in response to its political context, namely a setting in which the social-democratic settlement that was finalized after World War II had become canonical,&lt;ref&gt;Unger 2015, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; and active dispute over the organization of society severely declined, effectively enshrining a reigning consensus about social organization that Unger describes as including a "combination of neoliberal orthodoxy, state capitalism, and compensatory redistribution by tax and transfer."&lt;ref&gt;Unger 2015, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Critical legal scholars challenged that consensus and sought to use legal theory as a means to explore alternative forms of social and political organization.

In accordance with the [[Critical rationalism]] the German jurist Reinhold Zippelius uses Popper's method of "trial and error" in his 'Legal Philosophy'.&lt;ref&gt;Reinhold Zippelius, Die experimentierende Methode im Recht, Akademie Mainz, 1991, {{ISBN|3-515-05901-6}}; Rechtsphilosophie, 6. Aufl. 2011, § 11 III, {{ISBN|978-3-406-61191-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
Although the CLS (like most schools and movements) has not produced a single, monolithic body of thought, several common themes can be generally traced in its adherents' works. These include:
* A first theme is that contrary to the common perception, legal materials (such as [[statute]]s and [[case law]]) do not completely determine the outcome of legal disputes, or, to put it differently, the law may well impose many significant constraints on the adjudicators in the form of substantive rules, but, in the final analysis, this may often not be enough to bind them to come to a particular decision in a given particular case. Quite predictably, once made, this claim has triggered many lively debates among jurists and legal philosophers, some of which continue to this day (see further [[indeterminacy debate in legal theory]]).
* Secondly, there is the idea that all "law is politics". This means that legal decisions are a form of political decision, but not that it is impossible to tell judicial and legislative acts apart. Rather, CLS have argued that while the form may differ, both are based around the construction and maintenance of a form of social space. The argument takes aim at the positivist idea that law and politics can be entirely separated from one another. A more nuanced view has emerged more recently. This rejects the reductivism of 'all law is politics' and instead asserts that the two disciplines are mutually intertwined. There is no 'pure' law or politics, but rather the two forms work together and constantly shift between the two linguistic registers.
* A third strand of the traditional CLS school is that far more often than is usually suspected the law tends to serve the interests of the wealthy and the powerful by protecting them against the demands of the poor and the [[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]] (women, ethnic minorities, the working class, indigenous peoples, the disabled, homosexuals, etc.) for greater justice. This claim is often coupled with the legal realist argument that what the law says it does and what it actually tends to do are two different things. Many laws claim to have the aim of protecting the interests of the poor and the subaltern. In reality, they often serve the interests of the power elites. This, however, does not have to be the case, claim the CLS scholars. There is nothing intrinsic to the idea of law that should make it into a vehicle of social injustice. It is just that the scale of the reform that needs to be undertaken to realize this objective is significantly greater than the mainstream legal discourse is ready to acknowledge.
* Furthermore, CLS at times claims that legal materials are inherently contradictory, i.e. the structure of the positive legal order is based on a series of binary oppositions such as, for instance, the opposition between individualism and altruism or formal realizability (i.e. preference for strict rules) and equitable flexibility (i.e. preference for broad standards).
* Finally, CLS questions law's central assumptions, one of which is the [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] notion of the autonomous individual. The law often treats individual petitioners as having full agency vis-à-vis their opponents. They are able to make decisions based on reason that is detached from political, social, or economic constraints. CLS holds that individuals are tied to their communities, socio-economic class, gender, race, and other conditions of life such that they cease to be autonomous actors in the Kantian mode. Rather, their circumstances determine and therefore limit the choices presented to them. People are not "free"; they are instead determined in large part by social and political structures that surround them.

Increasingly, however, the traditional themes are being superseded by broader and more radical critical insights. Interventions in [[intellectual property law]], [[human rights]], [[jurisprudence]], [[criminal law]], [[property law]], [[international law]], etc., have proved crucial to the development of those discourses. Equally, CLS has introduced new frameworks to the legal field, such as [[postmodernism]], [[queer theory]], literary approaches to law, [[psychoanalysis]], law and [[aesthetics]], and [[post-colonialism]].

==Continued influence==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
CLS continues as a diverse collection of schools of thought and social movements. The CLS community is an extremely broad group with clusters of critical theorists at law schools and socio-legal studies departments such as [[Harvard Law School]], [[Georgetown University Law Center]], [[Northeastern University]], [[University at Buffalo]], [[Chicago-Kent College of Law]], [[Birkbeck, University of London]], [[University of Melbourne]], [[University of Kent]], [[Carleton University]], [[Keele University]], the [[University of Glasgow]], the [[University of East London]] among others.

In the American legal academy its influence and prominence seems to have waned in recent years. However, offshoots of CLS, including [[critical race theory]] continue to grow in popularity. Associated schools of thought, such as contemporary [[feminist theory]] and [[ecofeminism]] and critical race theory now play a major role in contemporary legal scholarship. An impressive stream of CLS-style writings has also emerged in the last two decades in the areas of international and comparative law.

In addition, CLS has had a practical effect on legal education, as it was the inspiration and focus of [[Georgetown University Law Center|Georgetown University Law Center's]] alternative first year curriculum, (Termed "Curriculum B", known as "Section 3" within the school). In the UK both Kent and Birkbeck have sought to draw critical legal insights into the legal curriculum, including a critical legal theory based LLM at Birkbeck's School of Law. Various research centers and institutions offer CLS-based taught and research courses in a variety of legal fields including human rights, jurisprudence, constitutional theory and criminal justice.

In [[New Zealand]], the [[University of Otago]] Legal Issues Centre was established at the University's law faculty in 2007.

''[[Law and Critique]]'' is one of the few UK journals that specifically identifies itself with critical legal theory. In America, ''[[The Crit]]'' is the only journal that continues to explicitly position itself as a platform for critical legal studies. However, other journals such as ''Law, Culture and the Humanities'', ''Unbound: The Harvard Journal of the Legal Left'', the ''Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review'', ''[[The National Lawyers Guild Review]]'', ''Social and Legal Studies'', and ''[[The Australian Feminist Law Journal]]'' all published avowedly critical legal research.

'''Dan Sperber''' (born 20 June 1942 in [[Cagnes-sur-Mer]]) is a French [[Social science|social]] and [[Cognitive science|cognitive scientist]]. His most influential work has been in the fields of [[cognitive anthropology]] and linguistic [[pragmatics]]: developing, with British psychologist [[Deirdre Wilson]], [[relevance theory]] in the latter; and an approach to [[cultural evolution]] known as the 'epidemiology of representations' in the former. Sperber currently holds the positions of ''Directeur de Recherche émérite'' at the ''[[French National Centre for Scientific Research|Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]]'' and Director of the International Cognition and Culture Institute.

==Background==

Sperber is the son of Austrian-French novelist [[Manès Sperber]]. He was born in France and raised an [[Atheism|atheist]] but his parents, both non-religious [[Ashkenazi Jews]], imparted to the young Sperber a "respect for my Rabbinic ancestors and for religious thinkers of any persuasion more generally".&lt;ref name="GE interview"&gt;{{cite web|last=Khan|first=Razib|title=10 questions for Dan Sperber|url=http://www.gnxp.com/blog/2005/12/10-questions-for-dan-sperber.php|work=Gene Expression|accessdate=3 March 2011|date=17 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became interested in [[anthropology]] as a means of explaining how rational people come to hold mistaken religious beliefs about the supernatural.&lt;ref name="Edge interview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Edge: AN EPIDEMIOLOGY OF REPRESENTATIONS: A Talk with Dan Sperber|url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/sperber05/sperber05_index.html|publisher=Edge|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Sperber was trained in anthropology at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] and the [[University of Oxford]]. In 1965 he joined the [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]] (CNRS) as a researcher, initially in the ''Laboratoire d'Études Africaines'' ({{lang-fr|[[African studies]] laboratory}}). Later he moved to the ''Laboratoire d'ethnologie et de sociologie comparative'' ([[Ethnology]] and [[Comparative Sociology]]), the ''[[Centre de Recherche en Epistémelogie Appliquée]]'' and finally, from 2001, the ''[[Institut Jean Nicod]]''.&lt;ref name="Sperber bio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dan Sperber — Biography|url=http://www.dan.sperber.fr/?page_id=2|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sperber's early work was on the [[anthropology of religion]],&lt;ref name="Edge interview" /&gt; and he conducted [[Ethnography|ethnographic fieldwork]] among the [[Dorze people]] of [[Ethiopia]].&lt;ref name="Sperber 1975"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sperber|first=Dan|title=Rethinking Symbolism|year=1975|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-09967-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sperber was an early proponent of [[structural anthropology]], having been introduced to it by [[Rodney Needham]] at Oxford, and helped popularise it in British social anthropology.&lt;ref name="Dosse 1997 pp. 268-270"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dosse|first=François|title=History of Structuralism: The rising sign, 1945-1966 volume 1|year=1997|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-2241-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the CNRS he studied under [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], credited as the founder of structuralism, who encouraged Sperber's "untypical theoretical musings".&lt;ref name="Sperber 2008a"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0003975608000118 | last1 = Sperber | first1 = Dan | title = Claude Lévi-Strauss, a precursor? | journal = European Journal of Sociology | volume = 49 | issue = 02 | pages = 309 | year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, however, Sperber came to be identified with [[post-structuralism]] in French anthropology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sperber|first=Dan|title=Le Structuralisme en Anthropologie|year=1973|publisher=Editions du Seuil|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1353/anq.2010.0012 | last1 = David Berliner | title = ''Lévi-Strauss and Beyond'' (review) | journal = Anthropological Quarterly | volume = 83 | issue = 3 | pages = 679–689 | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and criticised the theories of Lévi-Strauss and other structuralists for using [[interpretive]] ethnographic data as if it were an objective record,&lt;ref name="Sperber OAK"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sperber|first=Dan|title=On Anthropological Knowledge|year=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-26748-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for its lack of explanatory power.&lt;ref name="Sperber ExC"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sperber|first=Dan|title=Explaining culture: a naturalistic approach|year=1998|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford|isbn=0-631-20045-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Sperber has persistently defended the legacy of Lévi-Strauss' work as opening the door for naturalistic social science, and as an important precursor to [[cognitive anthropology]].&lt;ref name="Sperber 2008a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sperber 2008b"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sperber|first=Dan|title=Claude Lévi-Strauss at 100: echo of the future|url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/article/claude-levi-strauss-at-100-echo-of-the-future|publisher=openDemocracy.net|accessdate=3 March 2011|date=28 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After moving away from structuralism, Sperber sought an alternative naturalistic approach to the study of culture. His 1975 book ''Rethinking Symbolism'',&lt;ref name="Sperber 1975" /&gt; outlined a theory of [[Symbolic system|symbolism]] using concepts from the burgeoning field of [[cognitive psychology]]. It was formulated as a reply to [[Semiotics|semiological]] theories which were becoming widespread in anthropology through the works of [[Victor Turner]] and [[Clifford Geertz]] (which formed the basis of what come to be known as [[symbolic anthropology]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Basso|first=Keith H.|title=Review: Rethinking Symbolism|journal=Language in Society|year=1976|volume=5|issue=2|doi=10.1017/s0047404500007077 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hurtig|first=Richard|title=Book Reviews: Rethinking Symbolism|journal=Journal of Psycholinguistic Research|year=1977|volume=6|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sperber's later work has continued to argue for the importance of cognitive processes understood through psychology in understanding cultural phenomena and, in particular, [[cultural transmission]]. His '[[epidemiology of representations]]'&lt;ref name="Sperber OAK" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sperber ExC" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sperber|first=Dan|title=Analytical sociology and social mechanisms|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|url=http://www.dan.sperber.fr/?p=751|editor=Pierre Demeulenaere|chapter=A naturalistic ontology for mechanistic explanations in the social sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an approach to [[cultural evolution]] inspired by the field of [[epidemiology]]. It proposes that the distribution of cultural representations (ideas about the world held by multiple individuals) within a population should be explained with reference to biases in transmission (illuminated by cognitive and [[evolutionary psychology]]) and the "ecology" of the individual minds they inhabit. Sperber's approach is broadly [[Darwinism|Darwinist]]—it explains the macro-distribution of a trait in a population in terms of the cumulative effect micro-processes acting over time—but departs from [[memetics]] because he does not see representations as replicators except for in a few special circumstances (such as [[chain letters]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sperber|first=Dan|title=Darwinizing Culture: The Status of Memetics as a Science|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=163–173|editor=Robert Aunger|chapter=An objection to the memetic approach to culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cognitive and epidemiological approach to cultural evolution has been influential,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Richerson|first=Peter J.|title=Not by genes alone: how culture transformed human evolution|year=2008|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, Il.|isbn=978-0-226-71284-0|author2=Boyd, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; but as a means of explaining culture more generally it is pursued by only a small minority of scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuper|first=Adam|title=Anthropology and anthropologists: the modern British school|year=1996|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-11895-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; His latest work, published with cognitive scientist Hugo Mercier, has developed their argumentative theory of [[reason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1017/S0140525X10000968 |url = https://repository.upenn.edu/goldstone/15/| volume = 34| issue = 2| pages = 57–74| last1 = Mercier| first1 = Hugo| last2 = Sperber| first2 = Dan| title = Why Do Humans Reason?

His most influential work is arguably in [[linguistics]] and [[philosophy]]: with the British linguist and philosopher [[Deirdre Wilson]] he has developed an innovative approach to linguistic interpretation known as [[relevance theory]] which {{as of | 2010 | lc = on}} has become mainstream in the area of [[pragmatics]], [[linguistics]], [[artificial intelligence]] and [[cognitive psychology]]. He argues that cognitive processes are geared toward the maximisation of relevance, that is, a search for an optimal balance between cognitive efforts and cognitive effects.

As well as his emeritus position at the CNRS, Sperber is currently the Director of the [[International Cognition and Culture Institute]], a cross-disciplinary research institution based at the [[London School of Economics]] and ''Institut Jean Nicod''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ICCI - The Institute |url=http://www.cognitionandculture.net/the-institute.html |publisher=International Cognition and Culture Institute |accessdate=3 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213211438/http://www.cognitionandculture.net/the-institute.html |archivedate=13 December 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is a Corresponding Fellow of the [[British Academy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=British Academy - Fellowship Directory |url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/fellowship/directory/cor.asp?letter=S |accessdate=3 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606120329/http://www.britac.ac.uk/fellowship/directory/cor.asp?letter=S |archivedate=6 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2009 was awarded the inaugural Claude Lévi-Strauss Prize for excellence of French research in the humanities and social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dan Sperber, 1er lauréat du Prix Claude Levi-Strauss|url=http://www.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/cid28486/dan-sperber-1er-laureat-du-prix-claude-levi-strauss.html|publisher=Ministère de l'Enseignement supérieur et de la Recherche (MESR)|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 he gave a Turku [[Agora Lecture]].&lt;ref&gt;http://aboagora.wordpress.com/2011/11/14/agora-lecture-%E2%80%93-dan-sperber-culture-and-minds/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Corporate law|doctrines}}

''' ''De facto'' corporation''' and '''corporation by estoppel''' are both terms that are used by [[court]]s in most [[common law]] [[jurisdiction]]s to describe circumstances in which a business organization that has failed to become a '''[[De jure corporation|''de jure'' corporation]]''' (a corporation by law) will nonetheless be treated as a corporation, thereby shielding [[shareholder]]s from liability.

==''De facto'' corporation==
In order for a ''de facto'' corporation to be created, the following elements must exist:

#There must be an incorporation [[statute]] that lays out the various requirements under which legal incorporation can be accomplished;
#There must have been a good faith attempt to comply with the statute by the intended incorporators;
#:For example, if the [[articles of incorporation]] were mailed to the appropriate office, but addressed to the wrong person, lost in the mail, or not filed by the corporation by the time the corporation began acting in an official capacity.
#There must have been an act made on the corporation's behalf by its purported officers or [[agency (law)|agents]].

If all of these requirements are met, then the business will be treated as a corporation for all purposes, except with respect to acts by the state itself. However, most states will not apply this doctrine to protect a  person who was ''aware'' that the incorporation effort was defective at the time that they purported to act on behalf of the corporation.

==Corporation by estoppel==
Corporation by estoppel, on the other hand, applies against someone who operates a business ''as if it were'' a limited liability entity or corporation, irrespective of whether there was a good faith effort by the business to incorporate. The person doing business with such an entity, as if it were a limited liability entity or corporation, may later be [[estoppel|estopped]] from arguing that it is not in fact a limited liability entity, in an attempt to reach the assets of the incorporators. For the same reason, defendants who had acted as a corporation will be estopped from denying liability as a corporation when sued by a plaintiff who had relied on the defendant's corporate form when dealing with the defendant.

==Differences between ''de facto'' corporation and corporation by estoppel==
Both doctrines are applicable in the contract context but the estoppel concept typically does not apply where tort liability is sought because knowledge of corporate existence is irrelevant to the commission of tort.  The harm caused by a tortious act normally does not depend on knowledge, or lack thereof, of a corporation's existence.

In the annals of the Gdansk University of Technology the Department of Geodesy appears for the first time at the Technical University (Preussische Königliche Technische Hochschule) and the Faculty of Civil Engineering (1904). The first head of the Department of Geodesy was Prof. [[Otto Eggert|Hermann Otto Paul Eggert]] (b. 4 February 1874 in [[Sovetsk, Kaliningrad Oblast|Tilsit]], d. January 20, 1944 in [[Gdańsk|Gdansk]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Digitale Bibliothek - Münchener Digitalisierungszentrum|url = http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/~db/0001/bsb00016320/images/index.html?id=00016320&amp;groesser=&amp;fip=qrsyztsfsdryztsxdsydewqyztseayafsdr&amp;no=3&amp;seite=349|website = daten.digitale-sammlungen.de|accessdate = 2015-11-10|language = DE}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In 1921–1937 the next head of the Institute of Geodesy was Prof. Dr. Wilhelm Lührs. In 1938–1945 the Institute of Geodesy and Geometry was led by Prof. Paul Albert Ulrich Graf (February 6, 1908, in [[Wolgast]] – September 11, 1954, in [[Düsseldorf]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Beiträge und Dokumente zur Geschichte der Technischen Hochschule Danzig 1904-1945.

The '''Diptych of the Lampadii''' is an [[ivory]] [[diptych]], measuring 27x9x2 cm) dating to the beginning of the Fifth century AD. Only the left plate, which is kept in the [[Museo di Santa Giulia]] in [[Brescia]], survives. 

It was acquired by Cardinal [[Angelo Maria Quirini]] in the eighteenth century and was donated to the Museo dell'Era Cristiana in the nineteenth century.

== History ==
The work, datable to the beginning of the fifth century, was made to celebrate an important event in the life of the person named in the inscription, whose only legible fragment reads "''AMPADIORVM''" - probably indicating a member of the family of the Lampadii.

In general, diptychs were [[Consular diptychs|commissioned to celebrate]] an individual's appointment to the [[Roman consul|consulship]], so one possible identity of the person named by the inscription is [[Flavius Lampadius]], who was consul in 530. However, since the diptych is dated to the beginning of the fifth century on stylistic grounds, it is possible that it was produced on the appointment of another member of the family, a poorly known [[Lampadius (praefectus urbi)|Lampadius]] who was [[praefectus urbi]] of Rome in 398.&lt;ref name="libro"&gt;Stradiotti, p. 351.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lombardiabeniculturali.it/fotografie/schede/IMM-3a010-0004072/ Reference to the work on the site www.lombardiabeniculturali.it]&lt;/ref&gt;

Only the left plate is conserved and that is damaged on several sides. It was acquired by the Cardinal and collector Angelo Maria Querini in the first half of the eighteenth century and he left it to the commune of Brescia in his will.&lt;ref name="libro" /&gt;

It was initially displayed in the Museo dell'Era Cristiana, which was located in some rooms of the suppressed [[Monastery of St. Julia]] at the beginning of the nineteenth century. There it remained until 1998, when, with the opening of the [[Museo di Santa Giulia]], the diptych reached its current location in the "Collectibles and Applied Art" department, in the vitrines dedicated to Querini's collection.&lt;ref name= libro /&gt;

== Description and style ==
The image on the surviving panel is divided into two parts.

On the upper register there is an important individual, most likely the [[senator]] Lampadius, who holds a sceptre topped by an image of the Emperor in one hand and the white cloth (or ''mappa'') for giving the signal to begin the games in his other hand. Either side of him, depicted at a smaller scale are two other functionaries, perhaps his sons. The three individuals are inside a box decorated with panels with geometric patterns. Behind them a cornice supports a curvilinear [[architrave]], above which the fragmentary inscription is found.&lt;ref&gt;Elsner, p.39.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the lower register of the panel is a stylisted version of the race course in the [[Circus (building)|circus]], which four [[quadriga]]e, each drawn by four horses which run around the ''spina'' (the median strip) which has an [[obelisk]] in the centre, covered with stylised simplifications of [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]. This might recall the [[Circus Maximus]] and its obelisks. At the two ends of the ''spina'' are things which seem to represent groups of statuary. 

The depiction of the race track is very interesting both for its subject matter and for its technical execution, which stylises the course and all its features within the restricted space of the panel in a very efficient way, using side, front, and back views of the space alternately.&lt;ref name="libro" /&gt;

'''''East European Politics''''' is a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] academic journal covering the [[government]], [[politics]] and [[international relations]] of the post-communist space, including East Central Europe, the Baltic republics, South Eastern Europe, and the Western Balkans, as well as all the countries of the former Soviet Union. It is published quarterly (4 issues per year) by [[Routledge]] ([[Taylor &amp; Francis|Taylor &amp; Francis Group]])'''.''' The editors-in-chief are '''Adam Fagan''' ([[Queen Mary University of London]]) and '''Petr Kopecky''' ([[Leiden University]]).

== Journal information ==
''East European Politics'' publishes original scholarship on political developments in individual countries, together with cross-country comparative analyses and studies of the relations between post-communist regions and other parts of the world, including internationally based organizations such as the [[European Union]].

In addition to research articles and book reviews, ''East European Politics'' publishes thematic special issues as well. The journal also publishes regular ‘symposium’ sections and review articles devoted to briefer analysis of particular events, political issues and important theoretical and conceptual developments. All research articles in ''East European Politics'' have undergone rigorous peer review, based on initial editor screening and anonymized refereeing by at least two anonymous referees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=aimsScope&amp;journalCode=fjcs21|title=East European Politics :|website=www.tandfonline.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication history ==
The ''Journal of Communist Studies'' was founded in 1984 by a group of scholars (Michael Waller, Richard Gillespie, Ron Hill, David Goodman, David Bell, and Michael Williams) with a shared intellectual interest in communist political systems, successors to an editorial team that had produced ''Documents in communist affairs'' (published in the early 1980s by Butterworths) and other publications dealing with the communist movement. While the journal set out to reflect the growing complexity of the communist world and movements, in the 1980s, its focus was on the ‘core’ countries and parties that had historically been part of the world of the [[Communist International]]. The primary emphasis was on politics, but history, sociology, non-technical economics, biography, and comparative studies also featured.

In 1992, ''and Transition Politics'' was added to the title to reflect changing realities. Following the change of title, the scope both widened, to embrace regime change and democratisation, and in practice also narrowed, to concentrate somewhat more on political analysis. The volumes published under the revised title included analyses of the politics and political science of the new democracies, several of which are now considered to be seminal works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fagan|first=Adam|last2=Kopecky|first2=Petr|year=2012|title=East European politics (Editorial)|journal=East European Politics|volume=28|issue=1|pages=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2012, the journal is published under the title ''East European Politics''.

The '''Enron scandal''', publicized in October 2001, eventually led to the [[bankruptcy]] of the [[Enron|Enron Corporation]], an [[United States|American]] energy company based in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Texas]], and the ''de facto'' dissolution of [[Arthur Andersen]], which was one of the [[Big Four auditors|five largest]] [[audit]] and [[accountancy]] partnerships in the world. In addition to being the largest bankruptcy reorganization in American history at that time, Enron was cited as the biggest audit failure.&lt;ref name="DarkSide61"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bratton|first=William W.|title=Does Corporate Law Protect the Interests of Shareholders and Other Stakeholders?: Enron and the Dark Side of Shareholder Value|journal=[[Tulane Law Review]]|volume=|issue=1275|page=61|publisher=[[Tulane University Law School]]|location=New Orleans|date=May 2002|ssrn=301475|format=PDF|doi=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enron was formed in 1985 by [[Kenneth Lay]] after merging [[Houston Natural Gas]] and [[InterNorth]]. Several years later, when [[Jeffrey Skilling]] was hired, he developed a staff of executives that – by the use of accounting loopholes, [[special purpose entity|special purpose entities]], and poor financial reporting – were able to hide billions of dollars in debt from failed deals and projects. Chief Financial Officer [[Andrew Fastow]] and other executives not only misled Enron's Board of Directors and Audit Committee on high-risk accounting practices, but also pressured Arthur Andersen to ignore the issues.

Enron [[shareholder]]s filed a $40 billion lawsuit after the company's stock price, which achieved a high of [[United States dollar|US$]]90.75 per share in mid-2000, plummeted to less than $1 by the end of November 2001.&lt;ref name="Enron"&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|title=Enron shareholders look to SEC for support in court|journal=[[The New York Times]]|volume=|issue=|page=|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|location=|date=May 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/10/business/worldbusiness/10iht-enron.1.5648578.html?_r=0|format=WEB|doi=|accessdate=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) began an investigation, and rival Houston competitor [[Dynegy]] offered to purchase the company at a very low price. The deal failed, and on December 2, 2001, Enron filed for bankruptcy under [[Chapter 11]] of the [[Bankruptcy in the United States|United States Bankruptcy Code]]. Enron's $63.4 billion in assets made it the largest corporate bankruptcy in U.S. history until [[WorldCom]]'s bankruptcy the next year.&lt;ref name="Quality12"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Benston |first=George J. |title=The Quality of Corporate Financial Statements and Their Auditors Before and After Enron |journal=Policy Analysis |volume= |issue=497 |page=12 |publisher=[[Cato Institute]] |location=Washington D.C. |date=November 6, 2003 |url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa497.pdf |format=PDF |doi= |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ00qIbE?url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa497.pdf |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many executives at Enron were indicted for a variety of charges and some were later sentenced to prison. Andersen was found guilty of illegally destroying documents relevant to the SEC investigation, which voided its license to audit public companies and effectively closed the firm. By the time [[Arthur Andersen LLP v. United States|the ruling was overturned]] at the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]], the company had lost the majority of its customers and had ceased operating. Enron employees and shareholders received limited returns in lawsuits, despite losing billions in pensions and stock prices.

As a consequence of the scandal, new regulations and legislation were enacted to expand the accuracy of financial reporting for public companies.&lt;ref name="Ayala1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ayala |first=Astrid |author2=Giancarlo Ibárgüen, Snr |title=A Market Proposal for Auditing the Financial Statements of Public Companies |journal=Journal of Management of Value |page=1 |publisher=[[Universidad Francisco Marroquín]] |location= |date=March 2006 |url=http://www.mba.ufm.edu.gt/journalofmanagement/content/ENG_MarketProposal.pdf |format=PDF |doi= |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ0THjI8?url=http://www.mba.ufm.edu.gt/journalofmanagement/content/ENG_MarketProposal.pdf |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One piece of legislation, the [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act]], increased penalties for destroying, altering, or fabricating records in federal investigations or for attempting to defraud shareholders.&lt;ref name="Trends5"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Daniel A. |author2=Dey Aiyesha |author3=Thomas Z.

As Enron became the largest seller of natural gas in North America by 1992, its trading of gas contracts earned $122 million (before interest and taxes), the second largest contributor to the company's net income. The November 1999 creation of the [[EnronOnline]] trading website allowed the company to better manage its contracts trading business.&lt;ref name="Healy7"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Healy |first=Paul M. |author2=Krishna G. Palepu |title=The Fall of Enron |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume=17 |issue=2 |page=7 |date=Spring 2003 |url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~kathrynd/JEP.FallofEnron.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ0YEF6T?url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~kathrynd/JEP.FallofEnron.pdf |archivedate=2010-10-18 |doi=10.1257/089533003765888403 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to achieve further growth, Enron pursued a diversification strategy. The company owned and operated a variety of assets including gas pipelines, electricity plants, pulp and paper plants, water plants, and broadband services across the globe. The corporation also gained additional revenue by trading contracts for the same array of products and services with which it was involved.&lt;ref name="Healy5"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Healy |first=Paul M. |author2=Krishna G.

This included setting up power generation plants in developing countries and emerging markets including [[The Philippines]] ([[Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority|Subic Bay]]), [[Indonesia]] and [[India]] ([[Dabhol Power Company|Dabhol]]).&lt;ref name="outlook"/&gt;

Enron's stock increased from the start of the 1990s until year-end 1998 by 311%, only modestly higher than the average rate of growth in the [[S&amp;P 500|Standard &amp; Poor 500 index]].&lt;ref name="Healy1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Healy |first=Paul M. |author2=Krishna G.

By December 31, 2000, Enron's stock was priced at $83.13 and its market capitalization exceeded $60 billion, 70 times [[P/E ratio|earnings]] and six times [[Net asset value|book value]], an indication of the stock market's high expectations about its future prospects. In addition, Enron was rated the most innovative large company in America in [[Fortune (magazine)#Fortune lists|''Fortune'''s Most Admired Companies survey]].&lt;ref name="Healy1" /&gt;

==Causes of downfall==
Enron's complex financial statements were confusing to shareholders and analysts.&lt;ref name="DarkSide6"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bratton|first=William W.|title=Does Corporate Law Protect the Interests of Shareholders and Other Stakeholders?: Enron a ol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=301475|format=PDF|doi=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MackOther"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mack |first=Toni |url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2002/1014/062_print.html |work=[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]] |title=The Other Enron Story |date=2002-10-14 |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ0qQyoO?url=http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2002/1014/062_print.html |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, its complex business model and unethical practices required that the company use accounting limitations to misrepresent earnings and modify the [[balance sheet]] to indicate favorable performance.&lt;ref name="Healy9"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Healy |first=Paul M. |author2=Krishna G. Palepu |title=The Fall of Enron |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume=17 |issue=2 |page=9 |date=Spring 2003 |url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~kathrynd/JEP.FallofEnron.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ0YEF6T?url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~kathrynd/JEP.FallofEnron.pdf |archivedate=2010-10-18 |doi=10.1257/089533003765888403 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The combination of these issues later resulted in the bankruptcy of the company, and the majority of them were perpetuated by the indirect knowledge or direct actions of Lay, [[Jeffrey Skilling]], [[Andrew Fastow]], and other executives such as [[Rebecca Mark]]. Lay served as the chairman of the company in its last few years, and approved of the actions of Skilling and Fastow, although he did not always inquire about the details. Skilling constantly focused on meeting [[Wall Street]] expectations, advocated the use of [[mark-to-market accounting]] (accounting based on market value, which was then inflated) and pressured Enron executives to find new ways to hide its debt. Fastow and other executives "created off-balance-sheet vehicles, complex financing structures, and deals so bewildering that few people could understand them."&lt;ref name="McLean1323"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room]]|last=McLean|first=Bethany|author2=Peter Elkind|pages=132–133|isbn=1-59184-008-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revenue recognition===
{{Main|Revenue recognition}}
Enron and other energy suppliers earned profits by providing services such as wholesale trading and [[risk management]] in addition to building and maintaining electric power plants, natural gas pipelines, storage, and processing facilities.&lt;ref name="FossRevol"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Foss |first=Michelle Michot |title=Enron and the Energy Market Revolution |journal= |volume= |issue= |page=1 |publisher=[[University of Houston Law Center]] |location= |date=September 2003 |url=http://www.beg.utexas.edu/energyecon/energy-inc/members/Course_Modules/Class_Info/Foss_Enron%20Chapter_Final_9%205%2003.pdf |doi= |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ0uZXuG?url=http://www.beg.utexas.edu/energyecon/energy-inc/members/Course_Modules/Class_Info/Foss_Enron%20Chapter_Final_9%205%2003.pdf |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When accepting the risk of buying and selling products, merchants are allowed to report the selling price as revenues and the products' costs as cost of goods sold. In contrast, an "[[Agent (economics)|agent]]" provides a service to the customer, but does not take the same risks as merchants for buying and selling. Service providers, when classified as agents, are able to report trading and brokerage fees as revenue, although not for the full value of the transaction.&lt;ref name="DharanRed102"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dharan |first=Bala G. |author2=William R. Bufkins |title=Red Flags in Enron's Reporting of Revenues and Key Financial Measures |pages=101–103 |publisher=[[Social Science Research Network]] |date=July 2008 |url=http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~bala/files/dharan-bufkins_enron_red_flags.pdf |doi= |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ0yCA9i?url=http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~bala/files/dharan-bufkins_enron_red_flags.pdf |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although trading companies such as [[Goldman Sachs]] and [[Merrill Lynch]] used the conventional "agent model" for reporting revenue (where only the trading or brokerage fee would be reported as revenue), Enron instead selected to report the entire value of each of its trades as revenue. This "merchant model" was considered much more aggressive in the accounting interpretation than the agent model.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dharan |first=Bala G. |author2=William R. Bufkins |title=Red Flags in Enron's Reporting of Revenues and Key Financial Measures |page=102 |publisher=Social Science Research Network |date=July 2008 |url=http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~bala/files/dharan-bufkins_enron_red_flags.pdf |doi= |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ0yCA9i?url=http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~bala/files/dharan-bufkins_enron_red_flags.pdf |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Enron's method of reporting inflated trading revenue was later adopted by other companies in the energy trading industry in an attempt to stay competitive with the company's large increase in revenue. Other energy companies such as [[Duke Energy]], [[Reliant Energy]], and [[Dynegy]] joined Enron in the wealthiest 50 of the [[Fortune 500|''Fortune'' 500]] mainly due to their adoption of the same trading revenue accounting as Enron.&lt;ref name="DharanRed105"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dharan |first=Bala G. |author2=William R. Bufkins |title=Red Flags in Enron's Reporting of Revenues and Key Financial Measures |page=105 |publisher=Social Science Research Network |date=July 2008 |url=http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~bala/files/dharan-bufkins_enron_red_flags.pdf |doi= |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ0yCA9i?url=http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~bala/files/dharan-bufkins_enron_red_flags.pdf |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1996 and 2000, Enron's revenues increased by more than 750%, rising from $13.3 billion in 1996 to $100.8 billion in 2000. This extensive expansion of 65% per year was unprecedented in any industry, including the energy industry which typically considered growth of 2–3% per year to be respectable. For just the first nine months of 2001, Enron reported $138.7 billion in revenues, which placed the company at the sixth position on the [[Fortune Global 500|''Fortune'' Global 500]].&lt;ref name="DharanRed97100"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dharan |first=Bala G. |author2=William R.

===Mark-to-market accounting===
{{Main|Mark-to-market accounting}}
In Enron's natural gas business, the accounting had been fairly straightforward: in each [[Accounting period|time period]], the company listed actual costs of supplying the gas and actual revenues received from selling it. However, when Skilling joined the company, he demanded that the trading business adopt mark-to-market accounting, citing that it would represent "true economic value."&lt;ref name="McLean3942"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room]]|last=McLean|first=Bethany|author2=Peter Elkind|pages=39–42|isbn=1-59184-008-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enron became the first non-financial company to use the method to account for its complex long-term contracts.&lt;ref name="MackRisk"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mack|first=Toni|url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=421703&amp;sid=3&amp;Fmt=3&amp;clientId=17862&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD|registration=yes|work=[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]|title=Hidden Risks|date=1993-05-24|accessdate=2010-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark-to-market accounting requires that once a long-term contract was signed, income is estimated as the present value of net future cash flow. Often, the viability of these contracts and their related costs were difficult to estimate.&lt;ref name="Healy10"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Healy |first=Paul M. |author2=Krishna G. Palepu |title=The Fall of Enron |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume=17 |issue=2 |page=10 |date=Spring 2003 |url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~kathrynd/JEP.FallofEnron.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ0YEF6T?url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~kathrynd/JEP.FallofEnron.pdf |archivedate=2010-10-18 |doi=10.1257/089533003765888403 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the large discrepancies of attempting to match profits and cash, investors were typically given false or misleading reports. While using the method, income from projects could be recorded, although they might not have ever received the money, and in turn increasing financial earnings on the books. However, in future years, the profits could not be included, so new and additional income had to be included from more projects to develop additional growth to appease investors.&lt;ref name="McLean3942"/&gt; As one Enron competitor stated, "If you accelerate your income, then you have to keep doing more and more deals to show the same or rising income."&lt;ref name="MackRisk"/&gt; Despite potential pitfalls, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) approved the accounting method for Enron in its trading of natural gas futures contracts on January 30, 1992.&lt;ref name="McLean3942"/&gt; However, Enron later expanded its use to other areas in the company to help it meet Wall Street projections.&lt;ref name="McLean127"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room]]|last=McLean|first=Bethany|author2=Peter Elkind|page=127|isbn=1-59184-008-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For one contract, in July 2000, Enron and [[Blockbuster Inc.|Blockbuster Video]] signed a 20-year agreement to introduce on-demand entertainment to various U.S. cities by year-end. After several pilot projects, Enron recognized estimated profits of more than $110 million from the deal, even though analysts questioned the technical viability and market demand of the service.&lt;ref name="Healy10"/&gt; When the network failed to work, Blockbuster withdrew from the contract. Enron continued to recognize future profits, even though the deal resulted in a loss.&lt;ref name="BlockbusterUSA"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hays |first=Kristen |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/techinvestor/corporatenews/2005-04-17-new-enron-trial_x.htm |work=[[USA Today]] |title=Next Enron trial focuses on broadband unit |date=2005-04-17 |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ1Btmp1?url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/techinvestor/corporatenews/2005-04-17-new-enron-trial_x.htm |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special purpose entities===
{{Main|Special purpose entity}}
Enron used special purpose entities—limited partnerships or companies created to fulfill a temporary or specific purpose to fund or manage risks associated with specific [[asset]]s. The company elected to disclose minimal details on its use of "special purpose entities".&lt;ref name="Healy11"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Healy |first=Paul M. |author2=Krishna G. Palepu |title=The Fall of Enron |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume=17 |issue=2 |page=11 |date=Spring 2003 |url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~kathrynd/JEP.FallofEnron.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ0YEF6T?url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~kathrynd/JEP.FallofEnron.pdf |archivedate=2010-10-18 |doi=10.1257/089533003765888403 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These shell companies were created by a sponsor, but funded by independent [[Private equity|equity investors]] and debt financing. For financial reporting purposes, a series of rules dictate whether a special purpose entity is a separate entity from the sponsor. In total, by 2001, Enron had used hundreds of special purpose entities to hide its debt.&lt;ref name="Healy10"/&gt; Enron used a number of special purpose entities, such as partnerships in its Thomas and Condor tax shelters, [[financial asset securitization investment trust]]s (FASITs) in the Apache deal, [[real estate mortgage investment conduit]]s (REMICs) in the Steele deal, and REMICs and [[real estate investment trust]]s (REITs) in the Cochise deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= After Enron: Lessons for Public Policy | first= William A. | last= Niskanen | year= 2007 | pages= 306–307 | publisher= Rowman &amp; Littlefield | isbn= 978-0-7425-4434-5 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9rBTY25Q5ncC&amp;pg=PA306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The special purpose entities were used for more than just circumventing accounting conventions. As a result of one violation, Enron's balance sheet understated its [[Liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]] and overstated its [[Equity (finance)|equity]], and its earnings were overstated.&lt;ref name="Healy11"/&gt; Enron disclosed to its shareholders that it had [[Hedge (finance)|hedged]] downside risk in its own illiquid investments using special purpose entities. However, investors were oblivious to the fact that the special purpose entities were actually using the company's own stock and financial guarantees to finance these hedges. This prevented Enron from being protected from the downside risk.&lt;ref name="Healy11"/&gt; Notable examples of special purpose entities that Enron employed were JEDI, Chewco, Whitewing, and [[LJM (company)|LJM]].

====JEDI and Chewco====
{{Main|Chewco}}
In 1993, Enron established a joint venture in energy investments with [[CalPERS]], the California state pension fund, called the Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI).&lt;ref name="McLean67"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room]]|last=McLean|first=Bethany|author2=Peter Elkind|page=67|isbn=1-59184-008-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, Skilling, serving as [[Chief Operating Officer]] (COO), asked CalPERS to join Enron in a separate investment. CalPERS was interested in the idea, but only if it could be terminated as a partner in JEDI.&lt;ref name="DarkSide30"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bratton|first=William W.|title=Does Corporate Law Protect the Interests of Shareholders and Other Stakeholders?: Enron and the Dark Side of Shareholder Value|journal=[[Tulane Law Review]]|volume=|issue=1275|page=30|publisher=[[Tulane University Law School]]|location=New Orleans|date=May 2002|ssrn=301475|format=PDF|doi=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Enron did not want to show any debt from assuming CalPERS' stake in JEDI on its balance sheet. [[Chief Financial Officer]] (CFO) Fastow developed the special purpose entity [[Chewco|Chewco Investments]] [[limited partnership]] (L.P.) which raised debt guaranteed by Enron and was used to acquire CalPERS's joint venture stake for $383 million.&lt;ref name="Healy11"/&gt; Because of Fastow's organization of Chewco, JEDI's losses were kept off of Enron's balance sheet.

In autumn 2001, CalPERS and Enron's arrangement was discovered, which required the discontinuation of Enron's prior accounting method for Chewco and JEDI. This disqualification revealed that Enron's reported earnings from 1997 to mid-2001 would need to be reduced by $405 million and that the company's indebtedness would increase by $628 million.&lt;ref name="DarkSide31"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bratton|first=William W.|title=Does Corporate Law Protect the Interests of Shareholders and Other Stakeholders?: Enron and the Dark Side of Shareholder Value|journal=[[Tulane Law Review]]|volume=|issue=1275|page=31|publisher=[[Tulane University Law School]]|location=New Orleans|date=May 2002|ssrn=301475|format=PDF|doi=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Whitewing====
Whitewing was the name of a special purpose entity used as a financing method by Enron.&lt;ref name="WhiteWing"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCullough |first=Robert |title=Understanding Whitewing |page=1 |publisher=McCullough Research |location=Portland, Oregon |date=January 2002 |url=http://www.mresearch.com/pdfs/13.pdf |format=PDF |doi= |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ1HEEuA?url=http://www.mresearch.com/pdfs/13.pdf |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1997, with funding of $579 million provided by Enron and $500 million by an outside investor, Whitewing Associates L.P. was formed. Two years later, the entity's arrangement was changed so that it would no longer be consolidated with Enron and be counted on the company's balance sheet. Whitewing was used to purchase Enron assets, including stakes in power plants, pipelines, stocks, and other investments.&lt;ref name="Cornford18"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cornford |first=Andrew |title=Internationally Agreed Principles For Corporate Governance And The Enron Case |journal=G-24 Discussion Paper Series No. 30 |page=18 |publisher=[[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] |location=New York |date=June 2004 |url=http://www.unctad.org/en/docs/gdsmdpbg2420046_en.pdf |format=PDF |doi= |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ1KQjhV?url=http://www.unctad.org/en/docs/gdsmdpbg2420046_en.pdf |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1999 and 2001, Whitewing bought assets from Enron worth $2 billion, using Enron stock as [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]]. Although the transactions were approved by the Enron board, the asset transfers were not true sales and should have been treated instead as loans.&lt;ref name="Lambert35"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lambert|first=Jeremiah D.|title=Energy Companies and Market Reform|publisher=[[PennWell Corporation]]|location=[[Tulsa]]|date=September 2006|page=35|isbn=1-59370-060-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====LJM and Raptors====
{{Main|LJM (Lea Jeffrey Michael)}}
In 1999, Fastow formulated two [[limited partnership]]s: LJM Cayman. L.P. (LJM1) and LJM2 Co-Investment L.P. (LJM2), for the purpose of buying Enron's poorly performing stocks and stakes to improve its financial statements.

Morgan Chase]], [[Credit Suisse First Boston]], [[Citigroup]], and other investors. [[Merrill Lynch]], which marketed the equity, also contributed $22 million to fund the entities.&lt;ref name="DarkSide31"/&gt;

Enron transferred to "Raptor I-IV", four LJM-related special purpose entities named after the [[velociraptor]]s in ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', more than "$1.2 billion in assets, including millions of shares of Enron [[common stock]] and long term rights to purchase millions more shares, plus $150 million of Enron [[notes payable]]" as disclosed in the company's financial statement footnotes.&lt;ref name="Velociraptors"&gt;{{cite news|last=Levine |first=Greg |url=https://www.forbes.com/2006/03/07/enron-fastow-two-cx_gl_0307autofacescan16.html |work=[[Forbes]] |title=Fastow Tells Of Loss-Hiding Enron 'Raptors' |date=2006-03-07 |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ1O8XIc?url=http://www.forbes.com/2006/03/07/enron-fastow-two-cx_gl_0307autofacescan16.html |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DarkSide33"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bratton|first=William W.|title=Does Corporate Law Protect the Interests of Shareholders and Other Stakeholders?: Enron and the Dark Side of Shareholder Value|journal=[[Tulane Law Review]]|volume=|issue=1275|page=33|publisher=[[Tulane University Law School]]|location=New Orleans|date=May 2002|ssrn=301475|format=PDF|doi=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CloudedBooks"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hiltzik|first=Michael A.|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/103911266.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jan+31%2C+2002&amp;author=MICHAEL+A.+HILTZIK&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=A.1&amp;desc=THE+NATION%3B+THE+FALL+OF+ENRON%3B+Enron%27s+Web+of+Complex+Hedges%2C+Bets%3B+Finances%3A+Massive+trading+of+derivatives+may+have+clouded+the+firm%27s+books%2C+experts+say.|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|title=Enron's Web of Complex Hedges, Bets; Finances: Massive trading of derivatives may have clouded the firm's books, experts say|format=Fee required|date=2002-01-31|accessdate=2010-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The special purpose entities had been used to pay for all of this using the entities' [[Bond (finance)|debt instruments]]. The footnotes also declared that the instruments' face amount totaled $1.5 billion, and the entities [[notional amount]] of $2.1 billion had been used to enter into [[derivative contract]]s with Enron.&lt;ref name="DarkSide33"/&gt;

Enron capitalized the Raptors, and, in a manner similar to the accounting employed when a company issues stock at a [[public offering]], then booked the notes payable issued as assets on its [[balance sheet]] while increasing the [[Equity (finance)|shareholders' equity]] for the same amount.&lt;ref name="DarkSide38"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bratton|first=William W.|title=Does Corporate Law Protect the Interests of Shareholders and Other Stakeholders?: Enron and the Dark Side of Shareholder Value|journal=[[Tulane Law Review]]|volume=|issue=1275|page=38|publisher=[[Tulane University Law School]]|location=New Orleans|date=May 2002|ssrn=301475|format=PDF|doi=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This treatment later became an issue for Enron and its auditor [[Arthur Andersen]] as removing it from the balance sheet resulted in a $1.2 billion decrease in net [[Equity (finance)|shareholders' equity]].&lt;ref name="1BillionSE"&gt;{{cite news|last=Flood |first=Mary |url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/special/enron/3657249.html |work=[[Houston Chronicle]] |title=Spotlight falls on Enron's crash point |date=2006-02-14 |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ1jZ1Zd?url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/special/enron/3657249.html |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually the derivative contracts worth $2.1 billion lost significant value. [[Swap (finance)|Swaps]] were established at the time the stock price achieved its maximum. During the ensuing year, the value of the portfolio under the swaps fell by $1.1 billion as the stock prices decreased (the loss of value meant that the special purpose entities technically now owed Enron $1.1 billion by the contracts). Enron, which used a "mark-to-market" accounting method, claimed a $500 million gain on the swap contracts in its 2000 [[annual report]]. The gain was responsible for offsetting its stock portfolio losses and was attributed to nearly a third of Enron's earnings for 2000 (before it was properly restated in 2001).&lt;ref name="DarkSide39"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bratton|first=William W.|title=Does Corporate Law Protect the Interests of Shareholders and Other Stakeholders?: Enron and the Dark Side of Shareholder Value|journal=[[Tulane Law Review]]|volume=|issue=1275|page=39|publisher=[[Tulane University Law School]]|location=New Orleans|date=May 2002|ssrn=301475|format=PDF|doi=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corporate governance===
{{Main|Corporate governance}}
On paper, Enron had a model [[board of directors]] comprising predominantly outsiders with significant ownership stakes and a talented audit committee. In its 2000 review of best corporate boards, ''[[Chief Executive (magazine)|Chief Executive]]'' included Enron among its five best boards.&lt;ref name="Gillan21"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gillan|first=Stuart|author2=John D. Martin|title=Financial Engineering, Corporate Governance, and the Collapse of Enron|page=21|publisher=[[Alfred Lerner College of Business and Economics, The University of Delaware]]|date=November 2002|ssrn=354040|doi=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even with its complex corporate governance and network of intermediaries, Enron was still able to "attract large sums of capital to fund a questionable business model, conceal its true performance through a series of accounting and financing maneuvers, and hype its stock to unsustainable levels."&lt;ref name="Healy4"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Healy |first=Paul M. |author2=Krishna G. Palepu |title=The Fall of Enron |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume=17 |issue=2 |page=4 |date=Spring 2003 |url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~kathrynd/JEP.FallofEnron.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ0YEF6T?url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~kathrynd/JEP.FallofEnron.pdf |archivedate=2010-10-18 |doi=10.1257/089533003765888403 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Executive compensation====
Although Enron's compensation and performance management system was designed to retain and reward its most valuable employees, the system contributed to a dysfunctional [[Organizational culture|corporate culture]] that became obsessed with short-term earnings to maximize bonuses. Employees constantly tried to start deals, often disregarding the quality of cash flow or profits, in order to get a better rating for their performance review. Additionally, accounting results were recorded as soon as possible to keep up with the company's stock price. This practice helped ensure deal-makers and executives received large cash bonuses and stock options.&lt;ref name="DharanRed1120"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dharan |first=Bala G. |author2=William R. Bufkins |title=Red Flags in Enron's Reporting of Revenues and Key Financial Measures |page=112 |publisher=Social Science Research Network |date=July 2008 |url=http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~bala/files/dharan-bufkins_enron_red_flags.pdf |doi= |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ0yCA9i?url=http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~bala/files/dharan-bufkins_enron_red_flags.pdf |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was constantly emphasizing its stock price. Management was compensated extensively using [[stock options]], similar to other U.S. companies. This policy of stock option awards caused management to [[Pump and dump|create expectations of rapid growth]] in efforts to give the appearance of reported earnings to meet Wall Street's expectations.&lt;ref name="DVD-ENRON"&gt;{{cite video|title=[[Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room]]|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Magnolia Pictures]]|time=32:58|date=January 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stock ticker was located in lobbies, elevators, and on company computers.&lt;ref name="McLean187"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Smartest Guys in the Room|last=McLean|first=Bethany|author2=Peter Elkind|page=187|isbn=1-59184-008-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; At budget meetings, Skilling would develop target earnings by asking "What earnings do you need to keep our stock price up?" and that number would be used, even if it was not feasible.&lt;ref name="McLean127"/&gt; On December 31, 2000, Enron had 96 million shares outstanding as [[Employee stock option|stock option plans]] (approximately 13% of [[common shares]] outstanding). Enron's proxy statement stated that, within three years, these awards were expected to be exercised.&lt;ref name="Healy13"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Healy |first=Paul M. |author2=Krishna G. Palepu |title=The Fall of Enron |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume=17 |issue=2 |page=13 |date=Spring 2003 |url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~kathrynd/JEP.FallofEnron.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ0YEF6T?url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~kathrynd/JEP.FallofEnron.pdf |archivedate=2010-10-18 |doi=10.1257/089533003765888403 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using Enron's January 2001 stock price of $83.13 and the directors' beneficial ownership reported in the 2001 proxy, the value of director stock ownership was $659 million for Lay, and $174 million for Skilling.&lt;ref name="Gillan21"/&gt;

Skilling believed that if employees were constantly worried about cost, it would hinder original thinking.&lt;ref name="McLean119"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Smartest Guys in the Room|last=McLean|first=Bethany|author2=Peter Elkind|page=119|isbn=1-59184-008-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, extravagant spending was rampant throughout the company, especially among the executives. Employees had large expense accounts and many executives were paid sometimes twice as much as competitors.&lt;ref name="McLean401"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Smartest Guys in the Room|last=McLean|first=Bethany|author2=Peter Elkind|page=401|isbn=1-59184-008-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, the top 200 highest-paid employees received $193 million from salaries, bonuses, and stock. Two years later, the figure jumped to $1.4 billion.&lt;ref name="McLean241"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Smartest Guys in the Room|last=McLean|first=Bethany|author2=Peter Elkind|page=241|isbn=1-59184-008-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Risk management====
{{Main|Risk management}}
Before its scandal, Enron was lauded for its sophisticated [[financial risk management]] tools.&lt;ref name="DynamicFT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kim |first=W. Chan |author2=Renée Mauborgne |url=http://knowledge.insead.edu/abstract.cfm?ct=6973 |work=[[Financial Times]] |title=New dynamics of strategy in the knowledge economy |date=1999-10-11 |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720210527/http://knowledge.insead.edu/abstract.cfm?ct=6973 |archivedate=2011-07-20 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Risk management was crucial to Enron not only because of its regulatory environment, but also because of its [[business plan]]. Enron established long-term fixed commitments which needed to be hedged to prepare for the invariable fluctuation of future energy prices.&lt;ref name="Rosen1171"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosen|first=Robert|title=Risk Management and Corporate Governance: The Case of Enron|journal=[[Connecticut Law Review]]|volume=35|issue=1157|page=1171|publisher=|location=|year=2003|ssrn=468168|doi=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enron's bankruptcy downfall was attributed to its reckless use of derivatives and special purpose entities. By hedging its risks with special purpose entities which it owned, Enron retained the risks associated with the transactions. This arrangement had Enron implementing hedges with itself.&lt;ref name="Gillan17"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gillan|first=Stuart|author2=John D. Martin|title=Financial Engineering, Corporate Governance, and the Collapse of Enron|journal=|volume=|issue=|page=17|publisher=[[Alfred Lerner College of Business and Economics, The University of Delaware]]|location=|date=November 2002|ssrn=354040|doi=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enron's aggressive accounting practices were not hidden from the board of directors, as later learned by a Senate subcommittee. The board was informed of the rationale for using the Whitewing, LJM, and Raptor transactions, and after approving them, received status updates on the entities' operations. Although not all of Enron's widespread improper accounting practices were revealed to the board, the practices were dependent on board decisions.&lt;ref name="Rosen1170"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosen|first=Robert|title=Risk Management and Corporate Governance: The Case of Enron|journal=[[Connecticut Law Review]]|volume=35|issue=1157|page=1170|publisher=|location=|year=2003|ssrn=468168|doi=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though Enron extensively relied on derivatives for its business, the company's Finance Committee and board did not have enough experience with derivatives to understand what they were being told. The Senate subcommittee argued that had there been a detailed understanding of how the derivatives were organized, the board would have prevented their use.&lt;ref name="Rosen1175"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosen|first=Robert|title=Risk Management and Corporate Governance: The Case of Enron|journal=[[Connecticut Law Review]]|volume=35|issue=1157|page=1175|publisher=|location=|year=2003|ssrn=468168|doi=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Financial audit====
{{Main|Financial audit}}
Enron's [[auditor]] firm, [[Arthur Andersen]], was accused of applying reckless standards in its audits because of a [[conflict of interest]] over the significant consulting fees generated by Enron. During 2000, Arthur Andersen earned $25 million in audit fees and $27 million in consulting fees (this amount accounted for roughly 27% of the audit fees of public clients for Arthur Andersen's [[Houston]] office). The auditor's methods were questioned as either being completed solely to receive its annual fees or for its lack of expertise in properly reviewing Enron's revenue recognition, special entities, derivatives, and other accounting practices.&lt;ref name="Healy15"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Healy |first=Paul M. |author2=Krishna G. Palepu |title=The Fall of Enron |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume=17 |issue=2 |page=15 |date=Spring 2003 |url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~kathrynd/JEP.FallofEnron.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ0YEF6T?url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~kathrynd/JEP.FallofEnron.pdf |archivedate=2010-10-18 |doi=10.1257/089533003765888403 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enron hired numerous [[Certified Public Accountant]]s (CPAs) as well as accountants who had worked on developing accounting rules with the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]] (FASB). The accountants searched for new ways to save the company money, including capitalizing on loopholes found in [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]] (GAAP), the accounting industry's standards. One Enron accountant revealed "We tried to aggressively use the literature [GAAP] to our advantage. All the rules create all these opportunities. We got to where we did because we exploited that weakness."&lt;ref name="McLean142"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Smartest Guys in the Room|last=McLean|first=Bethany|author2=Peter Elkind|page=142|isbn=1-59184-008-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andersen's auditors were pressured by Enron's management to defer recognizing the charges from the special purpose entities as its [[credit risk]]s became known. Since the entities would never return a profit, accounting guidelines required that Enron should take a [[write-off]], where the value of the entity was removed from the balance sheet at a loss. To pressure Andersen into meeting Enron's earnings expectations, Enron would occasionally allow accounting companies [[Ernst &amp; Young]] or [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] to complete accounting tasks to create the illusion of hiring a new company to replace Andersen.&lt;ref name="McLean148"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Smartest Guys in the Room|last=McLean|first=Bethany|author2=Peter Elkind|page=148|isbn=1-59184-008-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Andersen was equipped with internal controls to protect against conflicted incentives of local partners, it failed to prevent conflict of interest. In one case, Andersen's Houston office, which performed the Enron audit, was able to overrule any critical reviews of Enron's accounting decisions by Andersen's Chicago partner. In addition, after news of [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) investigations of Enron were made public, Andersen would later shred several tons of relevant documents and delete nearly 30,000 e-mails and computer files, causing accusations of a cover-up.&lt;ref name="Healy15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DVD132"&gt;{{cite video|title=[[Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room]]|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Magnolia Pictures]]|time=1:32:33|date=January 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McLean383"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Smartest Guys in the Room|last=McLean|first=Bethany|author2=Peter Elkind|page=383|isbn=1-59184-008-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Revelations concerning Andersen's overall performance led to the break-up of the firm, and to the following assessment by the Powers Committee (appointed by Enron's board to look into the firm's accounting in October 2001): "The evidence available to us suggests that Andersen did not fulfill its professional responsibilities in connection with its audits of Enron's financial statements, or its obligation to bring to the attention of Enron's Board (or the Audit and Compliance Committee) concerns about Enron's internal contracts over the related-party transactions".&lt;ref name="Cornford30"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cornford |first=Andrew |title=Internationally Agreed Principles For Corporate Governance And The Enron Case |journal=G-24 Discussion Paper Series No. 30 |page=30 |publisher=[[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] |location=New York |date=June 2004 |url=http://www.unctad.org/en/docs/gdsmdpbg2420046_en.pdf |format=PDF |doi= |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ1KQjhV?url=http://www.unctad.org/en/docs/gdsmdpbg2420046_en.pdf |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Audit committee====
Corporate [[Audit committee]]s usually meet just a few times during the year, and their members typically have only modest experience with accounting and finance. Enron's audit committee had more expertise than many. It included:&lt;ref name="AuditComitMembers"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lublin|first=Joann S.|url=http://bodurtha.georgetown.edu/enron/Enron%20Audit%20Panel%20Is%20Scrutinized%20For%20Its%20Cozy%20Ties%20With%20the%20Firm.htm|work=The Wall Street Journal|title=Enron Audit Panel Is Scrutinized For Its Cozy Ties With the Firm|date=2002-02-01|accessdate=2009-08-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121214180037/http://bodurtha.georgetown.edu/enron/Enron%20Audit%20Panel%20Is%20Scrutinized%20For%20Its%20Cozy%20Ties%20With%20the%20Firm.htm|archivedate=2012-12-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enron's audit committee was later criticized for its brief meetings that would cover large amounts of material. In one meeting on February 12, 2001, the committee met for an hour and a half. Enron's audit committee did not have the technical knowledge to question the auditors properly on accounting issues related to the company's special purpose entities. The committee was also unable to question the company's management due to pressures on the committee.&lt;ref name="Healy14"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Healy |first=Paul M. |author2=Krishna G.

====Ethical and political analyses====
Commentators attributed the mismanagement behind Enron's fall to a variety of ethical and political-economic causes. Ethical explanations centered on executive greed and hubris, a lack of corporate social responsibility, situation ethics, and get-it-done business pragmatism.&lt;ref&gt;Kristen Hayes, "Executives' greed big factor in Enron crash, probe shows" ''The Seattle Times, ''August 23, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bethany McLean, "Why Enron Went Bust: Start with Arrogance," ''Fortune'', December 24, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duane Windsor, "Business Ethics at 'The Crooked E'" in ''Enron: Corporate Fiascos and Legal Implications'', ed. Nanacy Rapoport and Bala Dharan, 659—87. New York: Foundation Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Charles Raul, "In Era of Broken Rules, Society Breaks," ''Los Angeles Times'', October 11, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Enron: Whatever happened to risk management?" ''Personnel Today'', March 19, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Political-economic explanations cited post-1970s deregulation, and inadequate staff and funding for regulatory oversight.&lt;ref&gt;David Leonhardt, "How Will Washington Read the Signs?" ''The New York Times'', February 10, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Staff of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, United States Senate, "Financial Oversight of Enron: The SEC and the Private-Sector Watchdogs," October 7, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; A more libertarian analysis maintained that Enron's collapse resulted from the company's reliance on political lobbying, [[rent-seeking]], and the gaming of regulations.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Bradley Jr., "Enron: The Perils of Interventionism", Library of Economics and Liberty&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other accounting issues===
Enron made a habit of booking costs of cancelled projects as assets, with the rationale that no official letter had stated that the project was cancelled. This method was known as "the snowball", and although it was initially dictated that such practices be used only for projects worth less than $90 million, it was later increased to $200 million.&lt;ref name="McLean77"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Smartest Guys in the Room|last=McLean|first=Bethany|author2=Peter Elkind|page=77|isbn=1-59184-008-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, when analysts were given a tour of the [[Enron Energy Services]] office, they were impressed with how the employees were working so vigorously. In reality, Skilling had moved other employees to the office from other departments (instructing them to pretend to work hard) to create the appearance that the division was larger than it was.&lt;ref name="McLean1798"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Smartest Guys in the Room|last=McLean|first=Bethany|author2=Peter Elkind|pages=179–180|isbn=1-59184-008-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ruse was used several times to fool analysts about the progress of different areas of Enron to help improve the stock price.

In  February 2001, [[Chief Accounting Officer]] Rick Causey told budget managers: "From an accounting standpoint, this will be our easiest year ever. We've got 2001 in the bag."&lt;ref name="McLean299"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Smartest Guys in the Room|last=McLean|first=Bethany|author2=Peter Elkind|page=299|isbn=1-59184-008-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 5, [[Bethany McLean]]'s ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' article ''Is Enron Overpriced?'' questioned how Enron could maintain its high stock value, which was trading at 55 times its earnings.&lt;ref name="EnronOverpriced"&gt;{{cite news|last=McLean |first=Bethany |authorlink=Bethany McLean |url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/01/13/news/companies/enronoriginal_fortune/index.htm |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |publisher=[[CNNMoney.com]] |title=Is Enron Overpriced? |date=2001-03-05 |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ26rnac?url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/01/13/news/companies/enronoriginal_fortune/index.htm |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She argued that analysts and investors did not know exactly how Enron was earning its income. McLean was first drawn to the company's situation after an analyst suggested she view the company's [[Form 10-K|10-K report]], where she found "strange transactions", "erratic cash flow", and "huge debt."&lt;ref name="WaitedToldWP"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kurtz |first=Howard |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A64769-2002Jan17.html |work=[[The Washington Post]] |title=The Enron Story That Waited To Be Told |date=2002-01-18 |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ27Sokp?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A64769-2002Jan17.html |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She telephoned Skilling to discuss her findings prior to publishing the article, but he called her "unethical" for not properly researching the company.&lt;ref name="QuestionsNoticeNYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Barringer |first=Felciity |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/28/us/enron-s-many-strands-early-scrutiny-10-months-ago-questions-enron-came-went-with.html |work=The New York Times |title=10 Months Ago, Questions on Enron Came and Went With Little Notice |date=2002-01-28 |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ2Dguty?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/28/us/enron-s-many-strands-early-scrutiny-10-months-ago-questions-enron-came-went-with.html |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fastow cited two ''Fortune'' reporters that Enron could not reveal earnings details as the company had more than 1,200 trading books for assorted commodities and did "... &amp;nbsp;not want anyone to know what's on those books. We don't want to tell anyone where we're making money."&lt;ref name="EnronOverpriced"/&gt;

In a conference call on April 17, 2001, then-[[Chief Executive Officer]] (CEO) Skilling verbally attacked Wall Street analyst Richard Grubman,&lt;ref name="million"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pasha |first=Shaheen |url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/04/10/news/newsmakers/enron_trial/index.htm |publisher=[[CNNMoney.com]] |title=Skilling comes out swinging |date=2006-04-10 |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ2GOn06?url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/04/10/news/newsmakers/enron_trial/index.htm |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who questioned Enron's unusual accounting practice during a recorded conference call. When Grubman complained that Enron was the only company that could not release a balance sheet along with its earnings statements, Skilling stammered "Well uh ... Thank you very much, we appreciate it ... &amp;nbsp;Asshole."&lt;ref name="WellThankYou"&gt;{{cite news|last=Tolson |first=Mike |author2=Katherine Feser |url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/jenny/2404018.html |work=[[Houston Chronicle]] |title=Jeff Skilling's spectacular career |date=2004-06-20 |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ2J4D0c?url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/jenny/2404018.html |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This became an inside joke among many Enron employees, mocking Grubman for his perceived meddling rather than Skilling's offensiveness, with slogans such as "Ask Why, Asshole", a variation on Enron's official slogan "Ask why".&lt;ref name="EmpAskWhy"&gt;{{cite news|last=Niles |first=Sam |url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/07/10/ceo-anger-management-ceonetwork-leadership-outbursts_slide_2.html |work=[[Forbes]] |title=In Pictures: 10 All-Time Great CEO Outbursts: Jeffrey Skilling |date=2009-07-10 |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ2MXiZi?url=http://www.forbes.com/2009/07/10/ceo-anger-management-ceonetwork-leadership-outbursts_slide_2.html |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Skilling's comment was met with dismay and astonishment by press and public, as he had previously disdained criticism of Enron coolly or humorously.

By the late 1990s Enron's stock was trading for $80–90 per share, and few seemed to concern themselves with the opacity of the company's financial disclosures. In mid-July 2001, Enron reported revenues of $50.1 billion, almost triple year-to-date, and beating analysts' estimates by 3 cents a share.&lt;ref name="40QuarterNYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Norris |first=Floyd |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/13/business/enron-net-rose-40-in-quarter.html |work=The New York Times |title=Enron Net Rose 40% in Quarter |date=2001-07-13 |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ2QkcFd?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/13/business/enron-net-rose-40-in-quarter.html |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Enron's profit margin had stayed at a modest average of about 2.1%, and its share price had decreased by more than 30% since the same quarter of 2000.&lt;ref name="40QuarterNYT"/&gt;

As time passed, a number of serious concerns confronted the company. Enron had recently faced several serious operational challenges, namely logistical difficulties in operating a new broadband communications trading unit, and the losses from constructing the [[Dabhol Power Company|Dabhol Power project]], a large gas powered [[Dabhol Power Company|power plant in India]] that had been mired in controvery since the beginning in relation to its high pricing and bribery at the highest level.&lt;ref name="outlook"&gt;{{cite news |title=The real story of Dabhol |url=https://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/the-real-story-of-dabhol/211469 |accessdate=26 November 2018 |publisher=Outlook India |date=30 April 2001|first1=Ranjit|last1=Bhushan}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were subsequently confirmed in the 2002 Senate investigation.&lt;ref name="factsheet"&gt;{{cite web|author= US Government Senate Minority Staff Committee on Government Reform|title=FACT SHEET - Background on Enron's Dabhol Power Project (22 February 2002)|url=http://www.finance-mba.com/Dabhol_fact_sheet.pdf|publisher=U.S. House of Representatives|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There was also increasing criticism of the company for the role that its subsidiary [[Enron Energy Services]] had in the [[California electricity crisis]] of 2000–2001.

On August 14, Skilling announced he was resigning his position as CEO after only six months. Skilling had long served as president and COO before being promoted to CEO. Skilling cited personal reasons for leaving the company.&lt;ref name="6MonthsNYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Oppel |first=Richard A., Jr. |author2=Alex Berenson |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/15/business/enron-s-chief-executive-quits-after-only-6-months-in-job.html |work=The New York Times |title=Enron's Chief Executive Quits After Only 6 Months in Job |date=2001-08-15 |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ2TcFgb?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/15/business/enron-s-chief-executive-quits-after-only-6-months-in-job.html |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Observers noted that in the months before his exit, Skilling had sold at minimum 450,000 shares of Enron at a value of around $33 million (though he still owned over a million shares at the date of his departure).&lt;ref name="6MonthsNYT"/&gt; Nevertheless, Lay, who was serving as chairman at Enron, assured surprised market watchers that there would be "no change in the performance or outlook of the company going forward" from Skilling's departure.&lt;ref name="6MonthsNYT"/&gt; Lay announced he himself would re-assume the position of chief executive officer.

The next day, however, Skilling admitted that a very significant reason for his departure was Enron's faltering price in the stock market.&lt;ref name="OverboardNYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Krugman |first=Paul |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/17/opinion/reckonings-enron-goes-overboard.html |work=The New York Times |title=Enron Goes Overboard |date=2001-08-17 |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ2W2ew2?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/17/opinion/reckonings-enron-goes-overboard.html |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The economist [[Paul Krugman]] asserted in his ''The New York Times'' column that Enron was an illustration of the consequences that occur from the deregulation and [[commodification]] of things such as energy.&lt;ref name="OverboardNYT"/&gt; A few days later, in a letter to the editor, Kenneth Lay defended Enron and the philosophy of the company:&lt;ref name="DefendingNYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lay |first=Ken |authorlink=Kenneth Lay |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/22/opinion/l-defending-free-markets-805351.html |work=The New York Times |title=Defending Free Markets |date=2001-08-22 |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ2ZOPmb?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/22/opinion/l-defending-free-markets-805351.html |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The broader goal of [Krugman's] latest attack on Enron appears to be to discredit the free-market system, a system that entrusts people to make choices and enjoy the fruits of their labor, skill, intellect and heart. He would apparently rely on a system of monopolies controlled or sponsored by government to make choices for people. We disagree, finding ourselves less trusting of the integrity and good faith of such institutions and their leaders.

The example Mr. Krugman cites of "[[financialization]]" run amok (the electricity market in California) is the product of exactly his kind of system, with active government intervention at every step. Indeed, the only winners in the California fiasco were the government-owned utilities of Los Angeles, the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia. The disaster that squandered the wealth of California was born of regulation by the few, not by markets of the many.}}

On August 15, [[Sherron Watkins]], vice president for corporate development, sent an anonymous letter to Lay warning him about the company's accounting practices. One statement in the letter said: "I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals."&lt;ref name="LayLies"&gt;{{cite news|last=Foley|first=Stephen|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/enron-whistleblower-tells-court-of-lay-lies-6106609.html|work=[[The Independent]]|title=Enron whistleblower tells court of Lay lies|date=2006-03-16|accessdate=2010-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watkins contacted a friend who worked for Arthur Andersen and he drafted a memorandum to give to the audit partners about the points she raised. On August 22, Watkins met individually with Lay and gave him a six-page letter further explaining Enron's accounting issues. Lay questioned her as to whether she had told anyone outside of the company and then vowed to have the company's law firm, [[Vinson &amp; Elkins]], review the issues, although she argued that using the law firm would present a conflict of interest.&lt;ref name="McLean357"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Smartest Guys in the Room|last=McLean|first=Bethany|author2=Peter Elkind|page=357|isbn=1-59184-008-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SmokingGun"&gt;{{cite news|last=Zellner |first=Wendy |author2=Stephanie Forest Anderson |author3=Laura Cohn |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/02_04/b3767702.htm |work=[[BusinessWeek]] |title=A Hero—and a Smoking-Gun Letter |date=2002-01-28 |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ2gVYWk?url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/02_04/b3767702.htm |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lay consulted with other executives, and although they wanted to dismiss Watkins (as Texas law did not protect company [[whistleblower]]s), they decided against it to prevent a lawsuit.&lt;ref name="McLean358"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Smartest Guys in the Room|last=McLean|first=Bethany|author2=Peter Elkind|page=358|isbn=1-59184-008-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 15, Vinson &amp; Elkins announced that Enron had done nothing wrong in its accounting practices as Andersen had approved each issue.&lt;ref name="CrookedE"&gt;{{cite news |last=Duffy |first=Michael |url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,195268,00.html |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |title=By the Sign of the Crooked E |date=2002-01-19 |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ2jHkfU?url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,195268,00.html |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of August 2001, his company's stock value still falling, Lay named Greg Whalley, president and COO of Enron Wholesale Services and Mark Frevert, to positions in the chairman's office. Some observers suggested that Enron's investors were in significant need of reassurance, not only because the company's business was difficult to understand (even "indecipherable")&lt;ref name="SelfWoundNYT"/&gt; but also because it was difficult to properly describe the company in financial statements.&lt;ref name="TwoPromotedNYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Oppel |first=Richard A., Jr. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/29/business/two-are-promoted-as-enron-seeks-executive-stability.html |work=The New York Times |title=Two are promoted as Enron seeks executive stability |date=2001-08-29 |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ2mtLUH?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/29/business/two-are-promoted-as-enron-seeks-executive-stability.html |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One analyst stated "it's really hard for analysts to determine where [Enron] are making money in a given quarter and where they are losing money."&lt;ref name="TwoPromotedNYT"/&gt; Lay accepted that Enron's business was very complex, but asserted that analysts would "never get all the information they want" to satisfy their curiosity. He also explained that the complexity of the business was due largely to tax strategies and position-hedging.&lt;ref name="TwoPromotedNYT"/&gt; Lay's efforts seemed to meet with limited success; by September 9, one prominent hedge fund manager noted that "[Enron] stock is trading under a cloud."&lt;ref name="SelfWoundNYT"/&gt; The sudden departure of Skilling combined with the [[Opaque context|opacity]] of Enron's accounting books made proper assessment difficult for Wall Street. In addition, the company admitted to repeatedly using "related-party transactions," which some feared could be too-easily used to transfer losses that might otherwise appear on Enron's own balance sheet. A particularly troubling aspect of this technique was that several of the "related-party" entities had been or were being controlled by CFO Fastow.&lt;ref name="SelfWoundNYT"/&gt;

After the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], media attention shifted away from the company and its troubles; a little less than a month later Enron announced its intention to begin the process of selling its lower-margin assets in favor of its core businesses of gas and electricity trading. This policy included selling [[Portland General Electric]] to another Oregon utility, [[Northwest Natural Gas]], for about $1.9 billion in cash and stock, and possibly selling its 65% stake in the Dabhol project in India.&lt;ref name="OregonBillionNYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sorkin |first=Andrew Ross |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/06/business/enron-reaches-a-deal-to-sell-oregon-utility-for-1.9-billion.html |work=The New York Times |title=Enron Reaches a Deal to Sell Oregon Utility for $1.9 Billion |date=2001-10-06 |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ2sgdmO?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/06/business/enron-reaches-a-deal-to-sell-oregon-utility-for-1.9-billion.html |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restructuring losses and SEC investigation===
On October 16, 2001, Enron announced that restatements to its financial statements for years 1997 to 2000 were necessary to correct accounting violations. The restatements for the period reduced earnings by $613 million (or 23% of reported profits during the period), increased liabilities at the end of 2000 by $628 million (6% of reported liabilities and 5.5% of reported equity), and reduced equity at the end of 2000 by $1.2 billion (10% of reported equity).&lt;ref name="Healy11"/&gt; Additionally, in January Jeff Skilling had asserted that the broadband unit alone was worth $35 billion, a claim also mistrusted.&lt;ref name="OneBillionLossNYT"/&gt; An analyst at [[Standard &amp; Poor's]] said, "I don't think anyone knows what the broadband operation is worth."&lt;ref name="OneBillionLossNYT"/&gt;

Enron's management team claimed the losses were mostly due to investment losses, along with charges such as about $180 million in money spent restructuring the company's troubled broadband trading unit. In a statement, Lay revealed, "After a thorough review of our businesses, we have decided to take these charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential of our core energy businesses."&lt;ref name="OneBillionLossNYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gilpin |first=Kenneth N. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/17/business/enron-reports-1-billion-in-charges-and-a-loss.html |work=The New York Times |title=Enron Reports $1 Billion In Charges And a Loss |date=2001-10-17 |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ33QXrm?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/17/business/enron-reports-1-billion-in-charges-and-a-loss.html |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some analysts were unnerved. David Fleischer at [[Goldman Sachs]], an analyst termed previously 'one of the company's strongest supporters' asserted that the Enron management "... lost credibility and have to reprove themselves. They need to convince investors these earnings are real, that the company is for real and that growth will be realized."&lt;ref name="OneBillionLossNYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DoubtsNYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Norris |first=Floyd |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/24/business/enron-tries-to-dismiss-finance-doubts.html |work=The New York Times |title=Enron Tries To Dismiss Finance Doubts |date=2001-10-24 |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ33jJJD?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/24/business/enron-tries-to-dismiss-finance-doubts.html |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fastow disclosed to Enron's [[board of directors]] on October 22 that he earned $30 million from compensation arrangements when managing the LJM limited partnerships. That day, the share price of Enron decreased to $20.65, down $5.40 in one day, after the announcement by the SEC that it was investigating several suspicious deals struck by Enron, characterizing them as "some of the most opaque transactions with insiders ever seen".&lt;ref name="WhereValueNYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Norris |first=Floyd |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/23/business/the-markets-market-place-where-did-the-value-go-at-enron.html |work=The New York Times |title=Where Did The Value Go At Enron? |date=2001-10-23 |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ368YHe?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/23/business/the-markets-market-place-where-did-the-value-go-at-enron.html |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Attempting to explain the billion-dollar charge and calm investors, Enron's disclosures spoke of "share settled costless collar arrangements," "derivative instruments which eliminated the contingent nature of existing restricted [[forward contract]]s," and strategies that served "to hedge certain merchant investments and other assets." Such puzzling phraseology left many analysts feeling ignorant about just how Enron managed its business.&lt;ref name="WhereValueNYT"/&gt; Regarding the SEC investigation, chairman and CEO Lay said, "We will cooperate fully with the S.E.C. and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest."&lt;ref name="WhereValueNYT"/&gt;

Two days later, on October 25, despite his reassurances days earlier, Lay dismissed Fastow from his position, citing "In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO."&lt;ref name="OustsCFONYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Norris |first=Floyd |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/25/business/enron-ousts-finance-chief-as-sec-looks-at-dealings.html |work=The New York Times |title=Enron Ousts Finance Chief As S.E.C.

On October 27 the company began buying back all its [[commercial paper]], valued at around $3.3 billion, in an effort to calm investor fears about Enron's supply of cash. Enron financed the re-purchase by depleting its [[Line of credit|lines of credit]] at several banks. While the company's [[debt rating]] was still considered [[investment-grade]], its [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] were trading at levels slightly less, making future sales problematic.&lt;ref name="TapsCreditNYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Norris |first=Floyd |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/27/business/enron-taps-all-its-credit-lines-to-buy-back-3.3-billion-of-debt.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/S/Securities%20and%20Commodities%20Violations |work=The New York Times |title=Enron Taps All Its Credit Lines To Buy Back $3.3 Billion of Debt |date=2001-10-27 |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322153429/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/27/business/enron-taps-all-its-credit-lines-to-buy-back-3.3-billion-of-debt.html?n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes%20Topics%2FSubjects%2FS%2FSecurities%20and%20Commodities%20Violations |archivedate=2012-03-22 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the month came to a close, serious concerns were being raised by some observers regarding Enron's possible manipulation of accepted accounting rules; however, analysis was claimed to be impossible based on the incomplete information provided by Enron.&lt;ref name="PlumbingNYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Norris |first=Floyd |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/28/business/plumbing-mystery-of-deals-by-enron.html |work=The New York Times |title=Plumbing Mystery Of Deals By Enron |date=2001-10-28 |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ3HAHpe?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/28/business/plumbing-mystery-of-deals-by-enron.html |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Industry analysts feared that Enron was the new [[Long-Term Capital Management]], the hedge fund whose bankruptcy in 1998 threatened systemic failure of the international financial markets. Enron's tremendous presence worried some about the consequences of the company's possible bankruptcy.&lt;ref name="MightyNYT"/&gt; Enron executives accepted questions in written form only.&lt;ref name="MightyNYT"/&gt;

===Credit rating downgrade===
The main short-term danger to Enron's survival at the end of October 2001 seemed to be its credit rating. It was reported at the time that [[Moody's]] and [[Fitch Ratings|Fitch]], two of the three biggest credit-rating agencies, had slated Enron for review for possible downgrade.&lt;ref name="MightyNYT"/&gt; Such a downgrade would force Enron to issue millions of shares of stock to cover loans it had guaranteed, which would decrease the value of existing stock further. Additionally, all manner of companies began reviewing their existing contracts with Enron, especially in the long term, in the event that Enron's rating were lowered below investment grade, a possible hindrance for future transactions.&lt;ref name="MightyNYT"/&gt;

Analysts and observers continued their complaints regarding the difficulty or impossibility of properly assessing a company whose financial statements were so cryptic. Some feared that no one at Enron apart from Skilling and Fastow could completely explain years of mysterious transactions. "You're getting way over my head," said Lay during late August 2001 in response to detailed questions about Enron's business, a reaction that worried analysts.&lt;ref name="MightyNYT"/&gt;

On October 29, responding to growing concerns that Enron might have insufficient cash on hand, news spread that Enron was seeking a further $1–2 billion in financing from banks.&lt;ref name="SeekAddNYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Oppel |first=Richard A., Jr. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/29/us/enron-seeks-additional-financing.html |work=The New York Times |title=Enron Seeks Additional Financing |date=2001-10-29 |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ3K9eb2?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/29/us/enron-seeks-additional-financing.html |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, as feared, Moody's lowered Enron's credit rating from Baa1 to Baa2, two levels above [[junk bond|junk status]]. Standard &amp; Poor's affirmed Enron's rating of BBB+, the equivalent of Moody's Baa1. Moody's also warned that it would downgrade Enron's commercial paper rating, the consequence of which would likely prevent the company from finding the further financing it sought to keep solvent.&lt;ref name="CutSuffersNYT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/30/business/enron-credit-rating-is-cut-and-its-share-price-suffers.html |work=The New York Times |title=Enron Credit Rating Is Cut, And Its Share Price Suffers |date=2001-10-30 |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ3MKFxX?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/30/business/enron-credit-rating-is-cut-and-its-share-price-suffers.html |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

November began with the disclosure that the SEC was now pursuing a formal investigation, prompted by questions related to Enron's dealings with "related parties". Enron's board also announced that it would commission a special committee to investigate the transactions, directed by [[William C. Powers]], the dean of the [[University of Texas]] law school.&lt;ref name="SECOpenNYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Berenson |first=Alex |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/01/business/sec-opens-investigation-into-enron.html |work=The New York Times |title=S.E.C.

===Proposed buyout by Dynegy===
Sources claimed that Enron was planning to explain its business practices more fully within the coming days, as a confidence-building gesture.&lt;ref name="SkittishNYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Oppel |first=Richard A., Jr. |author2=Andrew Ross Sorkin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/07/business/enron-looks-for-investors-but-finds-them-skittish.html |work=The New York Times |title=Enron Looks for Investors, But Finds Them Skittish |date=2001-11-07 |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ3XHkOL?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/07/business/enron-looks-for-investors-but-finds-them-skittish.html |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Enron's stock was now trading at around $7, as investors worried that the company would not be able to find a buyer.

After it received a wide spectrum of rejections, Enron management apparently found a buyer when the board of Dynegy, another energy trader based in Houston, voted late at night on November 7 to acquire Enron at a very low price of about $8 billion in stock.&lt;ref name="DynegyNearNYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Oppel |first=Richard A., Jr. |author2=Andrew Ross Sorkin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/08/business/dynegy-is-said-to-be-near-to-acquiring-enron-for-8-billion.html |work=The New York Times |title=Dynegy Is Said to Be Near to Acquiring Enron for $8 Billion |date=2001-11-08 |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ3ZeAeO?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/08/business/dynegy-is-said-to-be-near-to-acquiring-enron-for-8-billion.html |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron Texaco]], which at the time owned about a quarter of Dynegy, agreed to provide Enron with $2.5 billion in cash, specifically $1 billion at first and the rest when the deal was completed. Dynegy would also be required to assume nearly $13 billion of debt, plus any other debt hitherto occluded by the Enron management's secretive business practices,&lt;ref name="DynegyNearNYT"/&gt; possibly as much as $10 billion in "hidden" debt.&lt;ref name="RivalBuyNYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Berenson |first=Alex |author2=Andrew Ross Sorkin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/10/business/rival-to-buy-enron-top-energy-trader-after-financial-fall.html?pagewanted=2 |work=The New York Times |title=Rival to Buy Enron, Top Energy Trader, After Financial Fall |date=2001-11-10 |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322145049/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/10/business/rival-to-buy-enron-top-energy-trader-after-financial-fall.html?pagewanted=2 |archivedate=2012-03-22 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dynegy and Enron confirmed their deal on November 8, 2001.

Commentators remarked on the different corporate cultures between Dynegy and Enron, and on the "straight-talking" personality of the CEO of Dynegy, [[Charles Watson (businessman)|Charles Watson]].&lt;ref name="SurestStepsNYT"/&gt; Some wondered if Enron's troubles had not simply been the result of innocent accounting errors.&lt;ref name="ActLikeItNYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Norris |first=Floyd |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/09/business/does-enron-trust-its-new-numbers-it-doesn-t-act-like-it.html |work=The New York Times |title=Does Enron Trust Its New Numbers?

Another major correction of Enron's earnings was announced on November 9, with a reduction of $591 million of the stated revenue of years 1997–2000. The charges were said to come largely from two special purpose partnerships (JEDI and Chewco). The corrections resulted in the virtual elimination of profit for fiscal year 1997, with significant reductions for the other years. Despite this disclosure, Dynegy declared it still intended to purchase Enron.&lt;ref name="OverProfitsNYT"/&gt; Both companies were said to be anxious to receive an official assessment of the proposed sale from Moody's and S&amp;P presumably to understand the effect the completion of any buyout transaction would have on Dynegy and Enron's credit rating. In addition, concerns were raised regarding antitrust regulatory restrictions resulting in possible [[divestiture]], along with what to some observers were the radically different corporate cultures of Enron and Dynegy.&lt;ref name="RivalBuyNYT"/&gt;

Both companies promoted the deal aggressively, and some observers were hopeful; Watson was praised for  attempting to create the largest company on the energy market.&lt;ref name="RushGambleNYT"/&gt; At the time, Watson said: "We feel [Enron] is a very solid company with plenty of capacity to withstand whatever happens the next few months."&lt;ref name="RushGambleNYT"/&gt; One analyst called the deal "a whopper ... a very good deal financially, certainly should be a good deal strategically, and provides some immediate balance-sheet backstop for Enron."&lt;ref name="SuitorNYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Berenson |first=Alex |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/13/business/the-markets-suitor-for-enron-receives-approval-from-wall-st.html |work=The New York Times |title=Suitor for Enron Receives Approval From Wall St. |date=2001-11-13 |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ3mhTHa?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/13/business/the-markets-suitor-for-enron-receives-approval-from-wall-st.html |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Credit issues were becoming more critical, however. Around the time the buyout was made public, Moody's and S&amp;P both reduced Enron's rating to just one notch above junk status. Were the company's rating to fall below investment-grade, its ability to trade would be severely limited if there was a reduction or elimination of its credit lines with competitors.&lt;ref name="RushGambleNYT"/&gt; In a conference call, S&amp;P affirmed that, were Enron not to be bought, S&amp;P would reduce its rating to low BB or high B, ratings noted as being within junk status.&lt;ref name="GasPipeNYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Norris |first=Floyd |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30C1FFC3B5C0C708DDDA80994D9404482 |work=The New York Times |title=Gas Pipeline Is Prominent as Dynegy Seeks Enron |date=2001-11-13 |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ3omWvx?url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res%3DF30C1FFC3B5C0C708DDDA80994D9404482 |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, many traders had limited their involvement with Enron, or stopped doing business altogether, fearing more bad news. Watson again attempted to re-assure, attesting at a presentation to investors that there was "nothing wrong with Enron's business".&lt;ref name="SuitorNYT"/&gt; He also acknowledged that remunerative steps (in the form of more stock options) would have to be taken to redress the animosity of many Enron employees towards management after it was revealed that Lay and other officials had sold hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of stock during the months prior to the crisis.&lt;ref name="SuitorNYT"/&gt; The situation was not helped by the disclosure that Lay, his "reputation in tatters",&lt;ref name="SeveranceNYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Oppel |first=Richard A., Jr. |author2=Floyd Norris |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/14/business/the-markets-market-place-enron-chief-will-give-up-severance.html |work=The New York Times |title=Enron Chief Will Give Up Severance |date=2001-11-14 |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ3sQFZE?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/14/business/the-markets-market-place-enron-chief-will-give-up-severance.html |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; stood to receive a payment of $60 million as a change-of-control fee subsequent to the Dynegy acquisition, while many Enron employees had seen their retirement accounts, which were based largely on Enron stock, ravaged as the price decreased 90% in a year. An official at a company owned by Enron stated "We had some married couples who both worked who lost as much as $800,000 or $900,000. It pretty much wiped out every employee's savings plan."&lt;ref name="PlanTumblesNYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Oppel |first=Richard A., Jr. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/22/business/employees-retirement-plan-is-a-victim-as-enron-tumbles.html |work=The New York Times |title=Employees' Retirement Plan Is a Victim as Enron Tumbles |date=2001-11-22 |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ3uoZLE?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/22/business/employees-retirement-plan-is-a-victim-as-enron-tumbles.html |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Watson assured investors that the true nature of Enron's business had been made apparent to him: "We have comfort there is not another shoe to drop. If there is no shoe, this is a phenomenally good transaction."&lt;ref name="GasPipeNYT"/&gt; Watson further asserted that Enron's energy trading part alone was worth the price Dynegy was paying for the whole company.&lt;ref name="UnderstandNYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Norris |first=Floyd |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/16/business/did-ken-lay-understand-what-was-happening-at-enron.html |work=The New York Times |title=Did Ken Lay Understand What Was Happening at Enron? |date=2001-11-16 |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ3xZWGk?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/16/business/did-ken-lay-understand-what-was-happening-at-enron.html |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By mid-November, Enron announced it was planning to sell about $8 billion worth of underperforming assets, along with a general plan to reduce its scale for the sake of financial stability.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news|last=Oppel|first=Richard A., Jr.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/15/business/enron-will-sell-some-assets-in-hope-of-raising-billions.html|work=The New York Times|title=Enron Will Sell Some Assets In Hope of Raising Billions|date=2001-11-15|accessdate=2010-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 19 Enron disclosed to the public further evidence of its critical state of affairs. Most pressingly that the company had debt repayment obligations in the range of $9 billion by the end of 2002. Such debts were "vastly in excess" of its available cash.&lt;ref name="SqueezeNYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Oppel |first=Richard A., Jr. |author2=Floyd Norris |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/20/business/in-new-filing-enron-reports-debt-squeeze.html |work=The New York Times |title=In New Filing, Enron Reports Debt Squeeze |date=2001-11-20 |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ43l8Uf?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/20/business/in-new-filing-enron-reports-debt-squeeze.html |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the success of measures to preserve its solvency were not guaranteed, specifically as regarded asset sales and debt refinancing. In a statement, Enron revealed "An adverse outcome with respect to any of these matters would likely have a material adverse impact on Enron's ability to continue as a going concern."&lt;ref name="SqueezeNYT"/&gt;

Two days later, on November 21, Wall Street expressed serious doubts that Dynegy would proceed with its deal at all, or would seek to radically renegotiate. Furthermore, Enron revealed in a [[Form 10-Q|10-Q filing]] that almost all the money it had recently borrowed for purposes including buying its commercial paper, or about $5 billion, had been exhausted in just 50 days. Analysts were unnerved at the revelation, especially since Dynegy was reported to have also been unaware of Enron's rate of cash use.&lt;ref name="RaisesDoubtNYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Oppel |first=Richard A., Jr. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/21/business/enron-s-growing-financial-crisis-raises-doubts-about-merger-deal.html |work=The New York Times |title=Enron's Growing Financial Crisis Raises Doubts About Merger Deal |date=2001-11-21 |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ45yLYo?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/21/business/enron-s-growing-financial-crisis-raises-doubts-about-merger-deal.html |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to end the proposed buyout, Dynegy would need to legally demonstrate a "material change" in the circumstances of the transaction; as late as November 22, sources close to Dynegy were skeptical that the latest revelations constituted sufficient grounds.&lt;ref name="CirclingNYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sorkin |first=Andrew Ross |author2=Riva D.

On November 28, 2001, Enron's two worst-possible outcomes came true: Dynegy Inc. unilaterally disengaged from the proposed acquisition of the company, and Enron's credit rating was reduced to junk status. Watson later said "At the end, you couldn't give it [Enron] to me."&lt;ref name="McLean403"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Smartest Guys in the Room|last=McLean|first=Bethany|author2=Peter Elkind|page=403|isbn=1-59184-008-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company had very little cash with which to operate, let alone satisfy enormous debts. Its stock price fell to $0.61 at the end of the day's trading. One editorial observer wrote that "Enron is now shorthand for the perfect financial storm."&lt;ref name="ImplosionNYT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/29/opinion/an-implosion-on-wall-street.html |work=The New York Times |title=An Implosion on Wall Street |date=2001-11-29 |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ4Idwjw?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/29/opinion/an-implosion-on-wall-street.html |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Systemic consequences were felt, as Enron's creditors and other energy trading companies suffered the loss of several percentage points. Some analysts felt Enron's failure indicated the risks of the post-September 11 economy, and encouraged traders to lock in profits where they could.&lt;ref name="PullBackNYT"&gt;{{cite news|agency=[[Reuters]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/29/business/the-markets-stocks-bonds-investors-pull-back-as-enron-drags-down-key-indexes.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Investors%20Pull%20Back%20as%20Enron%20Drags%20Down%20Key%20Indexes&amp;st=cse |work=The New York Times |title=Investors Pull Back as Enron Drags Down Key Indexes |date=2001-11-29 |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ4L9Hze?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/29/business/the-markets-stocks-bonds-investors-pull-back-as-enron-drags-down-key-indexes.html?scp%3D1%26sq%3DInvestors%20Pull%20Back%20as%20Enron%20Drags%20Down%20Key%20Indexes%26st%3Dcse |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The question now became how to determine the total exposure of the markets and other traders to Enron's failure. Early calculations estimated $18.7 billion. One adviser stated, "We don't really know who is out there exposed to Enron's credit. I'm telling my clients to prepare for the worst."&lt;ref name="NovelOneNYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Henriques |first=Diana B. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/29/business/enron-s-collapse-the-derivatives-market-that-deals-in-risks-faces-a-novel-one.html |work=The New York Times |title=Market That Deals in Risks Faces a Novel One |date=2001-11-29 |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ4NMUHH?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/29/business/enron-s-collapse-the-derivatives-market-that-deals-in-risks-faces-a-novel-one.html |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enron was estimated to have about $23 billion in liabilities from both debt outstanding and guaranteed loans. [[Citigroup]] and [[JP Morgan Chase]] in particular appeared to have significant amounts to lose with Enron's bankruptcy. Additionally, many of Enron's major assets were pledged to lenders in order to secure loans, causing doubt about what, if anything, unsecured creditors and eventually stockholders might receive in bankruptcy proceedings.&lt;ref name="MightBeNYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Glater |first=Jonathan D. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/29/business/enron-s-collapse-last-resort-bankruptcy-filing-might-be-best-remaining-choice.html |work=The New York Times |title=A Bankruptcy Filing Might Be the Best Remaining Choice |date=2001-11-29 |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ4Q31hJ?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/29/business/enron-s-collapse-last-resort-bankruptcy-filing-might-be-best-remaining-choice.html |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enron's European operations filed for bankruptcy on November 30, 2001, and it sought [[Chapter 11]] protection two days later on December 2. It became the largest [[bankruptcy]] in U.S. history, surpassing the 1970 bankruptcy of the [[Penn Central]] ([[WorldCom]]'s bankruptcy the next year surpassed Enron's bankruptcy so the title was short held), and resulted in 4,000 lost jobs.&lt;ref name="Quality12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DayReckonCNN"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pasha |first=Shaheen |author2=Jessica Seid |url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/05/25/news/newsmakers/enron_verdict/index.htm |title=Lay and Skilling's Day of Reckoning |publisher=[[CNNMoney.com]] |date=2006-05-25 |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ4T7JAj?url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/05/25/news/newsmakers/enron_verdict/index.htm |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The day that Enron filed for bankruptcy, the employees were told to pack their belongings and were given 30 minutes to vacate the building.&lt;ref name="DVD138"&gt;{{cite video|title=Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Magnolia Pictures]]|time=1:38:02|date=January 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 62% of 15,000 employees' savings plans relied on Enron stock that was purchased at $83 in early 2001 and was now practically worthless.&lt;ref name="Ayala51"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ayala |first=Astrid |author2=Giancarlo Ibárgüen, Snr |title=A Market Proposal for Auditing the Financial Statements of Public Companies |journal=Journal of Management of Value |volume= |issue= |page=51 |publisher=[[Universidad Francisco Marroquín]] |location= |date=March 2006 |url=http://www.mba.ufm.edu.gt/journalofmanagement/content/ENG_MarketProposal.pdf |format=PDF |doi= |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ0THjI8?url=http://www.mba.ufm.edu.gt/journalofmanagement/content/ENG_MarketProposal.pdf |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lay and Skilling went on trial for their part in the Enron scandal in January 2006. The 53-count, 65-page [[indictment]] covers a broad range of financial crimes, including bank fraud, [[making false statements]] to banks and auditors, securities fraud, wire fraud, money laundering, conspiracy, and insider trading. United States [[United States federal judge|District Judge]] Sim Lake had previously denied motions by the defendants to have separate trials and to relocate the case out of Houston, where the defendants argued the negative publicity concerning Enron's demise would make it impossible to get a fair trial. On May 25, 2006, the jury in the Lay and Skilling trial returned its verdicts. Skilling was convicted of 19 of 28 counts of securities fraud and wire fraud and acquitted on the remaining nine, including charges of [[insider trading]]. He was sentenced to 24 years and 4 months in prison.&lt;ref name="Skilling24Years"&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson |first=Carrie |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/23/AR2006102300287_pf.html |work=[[The Washington Post]] |title=Skilling Gets 24 Years for Fraud at Enron |date=2006-10-24 |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ4meIIM?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/23/AR2006102300287_pf.html |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the [[United States Department of Justice]] reached a deal with Skilling, which resulted in ten years being cut from his sentence.&lt;ref name="JeffSkilling Resentencing"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ex-Enron Chief's Sentence is Cut by 10 Years to 14|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/06/21/prison-sentence-of-ex-enron-ceo-skilling-cut-by-10-years-2/|accessdate=2013-06-21|publisher='''The New York Times'''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Sarbanes-Oxley Act}}
Between December 2001 and April 2002, the [[United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs|Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs]] and the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services|House Committee on Financial Services]] held multiple hearings about the Enron scandal and related accounting and investor protection issues. These hearings and the corporate scandals that followed Enron led to the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act on July 30, 2002.&lt;ref name="Chhaochharia79"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chhaochharia |first=Vidhi |author2=Yaniv Grinstein |title=Corporate Governance and Firm Value: the Impact of the 2002 Governance Rules |journal=Johnson School Research Paper Series No. 23-06 |pages=7–9 |publisher=[[Johnson School of Management]] |date=March 2007 |url=http://www.afajof.org/afa/forthcoming/2312.pdf |format=PDF |doi= |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ5wCYTh?url=http://www.afajof.org/afa/forthcoming/2312.pdf |archivedate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act is nearly "a mirror image of Enron: the company's perceived corporate governance failings are matched virtually point for point in the principal provisions of the Act."&lt;ref name="Deakin1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deakin |first=Simon |author2=Suzanne J.

The main provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act included the establishment of the [[Public Company Accounting Oversight Board]] to develop standards for the preparation of [[audit report]]s; the restriction of public accounting companies from providing any non-auditing services when auditing; provisions for the independence of audit committee members, executives being required to sign off on financial reports, and relinquishment of certain executives' bonuses in case of financial restatements; and expanded financial disclosure of companies' relationships with unconsolidated entities.&lt;ref name="Chhaochharia79"/&gt;

On February 13, 2002, due to the instances of corporate malfeasances and accounting violations, the SEC recommended changes of the stock exchanges' regulations. In June 2002, the [[New York Stock Exchange]] announced a new governance proposal, which was approved by the SEC in November 2003. The main provisions of the final NYSE proposal include:&lt;ref name="Chhaochharia79"/&gt;
* All companies must have a majority of independent directors.
* Independent directors must comply with an elaborate definition of independent directors.
* The compensation committee, nominating committee, and audit committee shall consist of independent directors.
* All audit committee members should be financially literate. In addition, at least one member of the audit committee is required to have accounting or related financial management expertise.
* In addition to its regular sessions, the board should hold additional sessions without management.

===Criticism of the Bush Administration===
Kenneth Lay was a longtime supporter of U.S. president [[George W. Bush]] and a donor to his various political campaigns, including his successful bid for the presidency in [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]].  As such, critics of Bush and his administration attempted to link them to the scandal.  A January 2002 article in [[The Economist (magazine)|''The Economist'']] claimed that Lay had been a close personal friend of Bush's family and had backed him financially since his unsuccessful campaign for Congress in [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1978|1978]].  Allegedly, Lay was even rumored at one point to be in the running to serve as [[Secretary of Energy]] for Bush.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.economist.com/news/2002/01/11/bush-and-enrons-collapse |title=Bush and Enron's collapse |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=January 11, 2002 |website=The Economist |publisher=The Economist |access-date=June 20, 2018 |quote="The problem for Mr Bush is that the ties between the company and his administration were especially intricate and close. Mr Lay has been a supporter of Mr Bush ever since the president's unsuccessful campaign for Congress in 1978, and has been known as a close personal friend of Mr Bush and his family. At one stage, Mr Lay was mooted as a possible energy secretary under Mr Bush."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article that same month, [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine accused the Bush administration of making desperate attempts to distance themselves from the scandal.  According to author Frank Pellegrini, various Bush appointments held connections to Enron, including deputy White House Chief of Staff [[Karl Rove]] as a stockholder, [[Secretary of the Army]] [[Thomas White Jr.]] as a former executive, and [[Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] chairman [[Harvey Pitt]], a former employee of Arthur Andersen.  Former [[Governor of Montana|Montana governor]] [[Marc Racicot]], whom Bush considered for appointment for [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]], briefly served as a lobbyist for the company after leaving office.  After opening a criminal investigation into the scandal, [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[John Ashcroft]] recused himself and his chief of staff from the case when Democratic Congressman [[Henry Waxman]] accused Ashcroft of receiving $25,000 from Enron for [[United States Senate election in Missouri, 2000|his failed reelection campaign to the Senate in 2000]].  As Pellegrini wrote, "The Democrats will have the company-he-keeps, guilt-by-association thing on their side, and with all the ... general whiff of rich man's cover-up about the whole affair, they'll have a class warfare card to play this spring." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,192920,00.html |title=Bush's Enron Problem |last=Pellegrini |first=Frank |date=January 10, 2002 |website=Time |publisher= Time Inc.|access-date=June 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Feminism sidebar |Variants}}
'''Feminist theology''' is a movement found in several religions, including [[Buddhism]], [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]], and [[New Thought]], to reconsider the traditions, practices, scriptures, and theologies of those religions from a [[feminism|feminist]] perspective. Some of the goals of feminist [[theology]] include increasing the role of women among the [[clergy]] and religious authorities, reinterpreting male-dominated imagery and language about [[God]], determining women's place in relation to career and [[motherhood]], and studying images of women in the religion's sacred texts and [[matriarchal religion]].

== Methodology ==

===Development of theology===
According to Grenz and Olson in their review of Feminist Theology, "it was developed in three distinct steps. They begin with a critique of the past” such that they review the ways women have been oppressed; “they seek alternative biblical and extrabiblical traditions that support” the ideals Feminists are trying to advance; and finally “feminists set forth their own unique method of theology, which includes the revisioning of Christian categories.”&lt;ref&gt;Grenz and Olson, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; Grenz and Olson also mention, however, while all feminists agree there is a flaw in the system, there is disagreement over how far outside of the Bible and the Christian tradition women are willing to go to seek support for their ideals.&lt;ref&gt;Grenz and Olson, p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has frequently been said that feminist theology draws on women's experience as a basic source of content as well as a criterion of truth.
There has been a tendency to treat this principle of "experience" as unique to feminist theology (or, perhaps to liberation theologies) and to see it as distant from "objective" source of truth of classical theologies. This seems to be a misunderstanding of the experimental base of all theological reflection. What have been called the objective sources of theology; Scripture and tradition, are themselves codified collective human experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Jvlmr5ePKnsC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR13&amp;dq=feminist+theology&amp;ots=zpn33QEC8b&amp;sig=_wsq9XBaROiWamCAH-PA7rP7nOs#v=onepage&amp;q=feminist+theology&amp;f=false|title=Sexism and God-talk: Toward a Feminist Theology : with a New Introduction|first=Rosemary Radford|last=Ruether|date=22 May 1993|publisher=Beacon Press|accessdate=22 May 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prehistoric religion and archaeology===
{{further|Mother Nature|Goddess|feminist archaeology}}
The primacy of a monotheistic or near-monotheistic "Great Goddess" is advocated by some modern [[matriarchists]] as a female version of, preceding, or analogue to, the [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic God]] associated with the historical rise of [[monotheism]] in the Mediterranean [[Axis Age]].

[[Mother Nature]] (sometimes known as ''Mother Earth'') is a common representation of [[nature]] that focuses on the life-giving and nurturing features of nature by embodying it in the form of the mother. Images of women representing mother earth, and mother nature, are timeless. In prehistoric times, [[goddess]]es were worshipped for their association with [[fertility]], [[fecundity]], and agricultural bounty. Priestesses held dominion over aspects of [[Inca Empire|Incan]], [[Assyria]]n, [[Babylonia]]n, [[Slavic peoples|Slavonic]], [[Roman mythology|Roman]], [[Greek mythology|Greek]], [[Religion in India|Indian]], and [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]] religions in the millennia prior to the inception of [[Patriarchal religion]].

===Gender and God===
{{main|Gender of God}}
Others who practice feminist spirituality may instead adhere to a feminist re-interpretation of Western monotheistic traditions. In those cases, the notion of [[God]] as having a male gender is rejected, and God is not referred to using male pronouns. Feminist spirituality may also object to images of God that they perceive as authoritarian, parental, or disciplinarian, instead emphasizing "maternal" attributes such as nurturing, acceptance, and creativity.

[[Carol P. Christ]] is the author of the widely reprinted essay "Why Women Need the Goddess",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= per Carol P Christ biography for Signs Out of Time Project|url=http://www.belili.org/marija/bios/carol_christ.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; which argues in favor of the concept of there having been an ancient religion of a supreme [[goddess]]. This essay was presented as the keynote address to an audience of over 500 at the "Great Goddess Re-emerging" conference at the [[University of Santa Cruz]] in the spring of 1978, and was first published in ''Heresies: The Great Goddess Issue'' (1978), pgs. 8-13.&lt;ref name="goddessariadne.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goddessariadne.org/#!why-women-need-the-goddess-part-1/cufo|title=Goddess Tours Greece-Sacred Sites Tour-Goddess Pilgrimage Crete|website=Goddess Tours Greece-Sacred Sites Tour-Goddess Pilgrimage Crete|accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carol P. Christ also co-edited the classic feminist religion anthologies ''Weaving the Visions: New Patterns in Feminist Spirituality'' (1989) and ''Womanspirit Rising'' (1979/1989); the latter included her essay ''Why Women Need the Goddess''.&lt;ref name="goddessariadne.org"/&gt;

===New Thought movement===
{{main|New Thought}}
New Thought as a movement had no single origin, but was rather propelled along by a number of spiritual thinkers and philosophers and emerged through a variety of religious denominations and churches, particularly the [[Unity Church]], [[Religious Science]], and [[Church of Divine Science]].&lt;ref name=lewis16&gt;{{cite book |title=Perspectives on the New Age |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U1werz4a1BIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA16#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |first=James R. |last=Lewis |year=1992 |publisher=SUNY Press |pages=16–18 |isbn=978-0-7914-1213-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a [[feminist]] movement in that most of its teachers and students were women; notable among the founders of the movement were [[Emma Curtis Hopkins]], known as the "teacher of teachers" [[Myrtle Fillmore]], [[Malinda Cramer]], and [[Nona L.

== Within specific religions ==

===Judaism===
{{main|Jewish feminism|Women in the Bible}}
[[Jewish feminism]] is a movement that seeks to make the religious, legal, and social status of Jewish women equal to that of Jewish men. Feminist movements, with varying approaches and successes, have opened up within all major branches of Judaism.

Various versions of feminist theology exist within the Jewish community.

Some of these theologies promote the idea that it is important to have a feminine characterisation of God within the [[siddur]] (Jewish prayerbook) and service.

In 1976, [[Rita Gross]] published the article "Female God Language in a Jewish Context" (Davka Magazine 17), which Jewish scholar and feminist [[Judith Plaskow]] considers "probably the first article to deal theoretically with the issue of female God-language in a Jewish context".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/beliefs/Issues/Gender_and_Feminism/Feminist_Thought/Theology.shtml |title=Jewish Feminist Theology: A Survey |publisher=My Jewish Learning |date= |accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhushara.com/book/torah/cardoza/ssin.htm |title=Standing at Sinai |publisher=Dhushara.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;Gross was Jewish herself at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SJs-aLqCiF8C&amp;pg=PA200&amp;dq=rita+gross+jew&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=j1I9T8y6Loy_0QGp4qHpBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDYQ6wEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=rita%20gross%20jew&amp;f=false |title=Jewish Mysticism and Kabbalah: New Insights and Scholarship - Frederick Greenspahn - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]] [[Rabbi]] [[Rebecca Alpert]] (''Reform Judaism'', Winter 1991) comments:
{{quote|The experience of praying with ''Siddur Nashim'' [the first Sabbath prayer book to refer to God using female pronouns and imagery]  ... transformed my relationship with God. For the first time, I understood what it meant to be made in God's image. To think of God as a woman like myself, to see Her as both powerful and nurturing, to see Her imaged with a woman's body, with womb, with breasts – this was an experience of ultimate significance. Was this the relationship that men have had with God for all these millennia? How wonderful to gain access to those feelings and perceptions.}} ''Siddur Nashim'' was self-published in 1976 by Naomi Janowitz and [[Margaret Wenig]].

In 1990 Rabbi [[Margaret Wenig]] wrote the sermon, "God Is a Woman and She Is Growing Older", which as of 2011 has been published ten times (three times in German) and preached by rabbis from Australia to California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://huc.edu/faculty/faculty/MargaretWenig.shtml ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925104018/http://huc.edu/faculty/faculty/MargaretWenig.shtml |date=September 25, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Paula Reimers]] ("Feminism, Judaism, and God the Mother", ''Conservative Judaism'' '''46''' (1993)) comments:
{{quote|Those who want to use God/She language want to affirm womanhood and the feminine aspect of the deity. They do this by emphasizing that which most clearly distinguishes the female experience from the male. A male or female deity can create through speech or through action, but the metaphor for creation which is uniquely feminine is birth. Once God is called female, then, the metaphor of birth and the identification of the deity with nature and its processes become inevitable}}

Ahuva Zache affirms that using both masculine and feminine language for God can be a positive thing, but reminds her Reform Jewish readership that God is beyond gender (''Is God male, female, both or neither? How should we phrase our prayers in response to God’s gender?'', in the [[Union for Reform Judaism]]'s iTorah, [http://urj.org/Articles/index.cfm?id=11422]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}):

{{quote|Feminine imagery of God does not in any way threaten Judaism. On the contrary, it enhances the Jewish understanding of God, which should not be limited to masculine metaphors. All language that humans use to describe God is only a metaphor. Using masculine and feminine metaphors for God is one way to remind ourselves that gendered descriptions of God are just metaphors. God is beyond gender.}}

These views are highly controversial even within liberal Jewish movements.&lt;ref&gt;"This genderless God also represents a profound betrayal of the Torah narrative."  Matthew Berke, "God and Gender in Judaism", in Copyright (c) 1996 ''First Things'' 64 (June/July 1996): 33–38&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]] and many [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative Jews]]
hold that it is wrong to use English female pronouns for God, viewing such usage as an intrusion of modern feminist ideology into Jewish tradition.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Liberal prayerbooks tend increasingly to also avoid male-specific words and pronouns, seeking that all references to God in translations be made in gender-neutral language. For example, the [[Liberal Judaism (UK)|UK Liberal movement]]'s ''Siddur Lev Chadash'' (1995) does so, as does the [[Movement for Reform Judaism|UK Reform Movement]]'s ''Forms of Prayer'' (2008).&lt;ref&gt;[http://thejc.com/articles/the-slimline-siddur-a-touch-bob-dylan The slimline siddur with a touch of Bob Dylan | The Jewish Chronicle&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bwpjc.org/slc.htm Siddur Lev Chadash&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705015023/http://www.bwpjc.org/slc.htm |date=July 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mishkan T'filah]], the American Reform Jewish prayer book released in 2007, references to God as “He” have been removed, and whenever Jewish patriarchs are named (Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob), so also are the matriarchs (Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah.) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/03/us/03prayerbook.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times | first=Laurie | last=Goodstein | title=In New Prayer Book, Signs of Broad Change | date=3 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 the Reform Jewish [[High Holy Days]] prayer book [[Mishkan HaNefesh]] was released; it is intended as a companion to Mishkan T'filah.&lt;ref name="jweekly1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/74278/gates-of-repentance-replacement-advances-reform-trends/ |title=‘Gates of Repentance’ replacement advances Reform trends &amp;#124; j. the Jewish news weekly of Northern California |publisher=Jweekly.com |date=2015-03-26 |accessdate=2015-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes a version of the High Holy Days prayer [[Avinu Malkeinu]] that refers to God as both "Loving Father" and "Compassionate Mother."&lt;ref name="jweekly1"/&gt; Other notable changes are replacing a line from the Reform movement’s earlier prayerbook, "Gates of Repentance," that mentioned the joy of a bride and groom specifically, with the line "rejoicing with couples under the chuppah [wedding canopy]", and adding a third, non-gendered option to the way worshippers are called to the Torah, offering “mibeit,” Hebrew for “from the house of,” in addition to the traditional “son of” or “daughter of.”&lt;ref name="jweekly1"/&gt;

In 2003 ''The Female Face of God in Auschwitz: A Jewish Feminist Theology of the Holocaust'', the first full-length feminist theology of the Holocaust, written by Melissa Raphael, was published.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0415236657 The Female Face of God in Auschwitz: A Jewish Feminist Theology of the Holocaust (Religion and Gender): Melissa Raphael: 9780415236652: Amazon.com: Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Judith Plaskow]]’s ''Standing Again at Sinai: Judaism from a Feminist Perspective'' (1991), and [[Rachel Adler]]’s ''Engendering Judaism: An Inclusive Theology and Ethics'' (1999) are the only two full-length Jewish feminist works to focus entirely on theology in general (rather than specific aspects such as Holocaust theology.) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/feminist-theology|title=Feminist Theology - Jewish Women's Archive|website=jwa.org|accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, ''Standing Again at Sinai: Judaism from a Feminist Perspective'' (1991) is the first book of Jewish feminist theology ever written.

===Christianity===

[[Christian feminism]] is an aspect of feminist theology which seeks to advance and understand the [[sexual equality|equality]] of men and women morally, socially, spiritually, and in leadership from a [[Christian]] perspective.

Two authors whose works are vital to an understanding of feminist theology are Mary Daly and Rosemary Radford Ruether.

[[Mary Daly]] grew up an Irish Catholic and all of her education was received through Catholic schools. She has three doctorate degrees. One from St. Mary’s College in sacred theology, and two from University of Fribourg, Switzerland in theology and philosophy. From 1966 till the end of her career she taught at Boston College. While in her early works Daly expressed a desire to reform Christianity from the inside, she would later come to the same point as several other feminists, that Christianity is not able to enact the necessary changes as it is. (Prologue Daly). “On November 14, 1971, when she was invited to be the first woman to preach at Harvard Memorial Chapel. She used the opportunity to denounce Christianity as irredeemable for women and to call for women (and men) to make an exodus from the Church. Almost all the women who attended this service walked out with her, as well as a few men.”&lt;ref&gt;Ruether, p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt; Her works include: ''The Church and the Second Sex'' (1968), ''Beyond God the Father'' (1973), ''Gyn/ecology: The Metaethics of Radical Feminism'' (1978), ''Pure Lust: Elemental Feminist Philosophy'' (1984), ''Webster’s First Intergalactic Wickedary of the English Language'' (1987), and ''Outercourse: The Be-Dazzling Voyage'' (1992). According to Ford’s The Modern Theologians, “Mary Daly has done more than anyone to clarify the problems women have concerning the central core symbolism of Christianity, and its effects on their self-understanding and their relationship to God.”&lt;ref&gt;Ford, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rosemary Radford Ruether]] grew up Roman Catholic and attended Catholic schools through her sophomore year of high school. She was a classics major at Scripps College, worked for the Delta Ministry in 1965 and taught at Howard University School of Religion from 1966 to 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Ruether, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; She has also “been responsible for the production of some twenty-two books…and at least five hundred articles.”&lt;ref&gt;Ford, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; “Rosemary Ruether has written on the question of Christian credibility, with particular attention to ecclesiology and its engagement with church-world conflicts; Jewish-Christian relations…; politics and religion in America; and Feminism".&lt;ref&gt;Ford, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s [[Phyllis Trible]] pioneered a [[Christian feminism|Christian feminist]] approach to [[biblical scholarship]], using the approach of [[rhetorical criticism]] developed by her dissertation advisor, [[James Muilenburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tull|first1=Patricia K.|editor1-last=Haynes|editor1-first=Stephen R.|editor2-last=McKenzie|editor2-first=Steven L.|title=To each its own meaning : an introduction to biblical criticisms and their applications|date=1999|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|location=Louisville, Ky.|isbn=978-0664257842|edition=Rev. and expanded.|chapter=Chapter 8: Rhetorical Criticism and Intertextuality}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|158-159}}&lt;ref name=UTSaid&gt;{{cite web|title=Finding Aid for Phyllis Trible Papers, 1954-2015|url=http://library.columbia.edu/content/dam/libraryweb/locations/burke/fa/awts/ldpd_5635427.pdf|publisher=Archives of Women in Theological Scholarship The Burke Library Columbia University Libraries Union Theological Seminary, New York|accessdate=4 April 2018|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vater|first1=Ann M.|title=Review of God and the Rhetoric of Sexuality|journal=Journal of Biblical Literature|date=1980|volume=99|issue=1|pages=131–133|doi=10.2307/3265712|jstor=3265712}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian feminist theology has sometimes been critiqued as being focused on white women. This has resulted in the development of movements such as [[womanist theology]], [[Asian feminist theology]], and [[mujerista theology]].

The term [[Christian egalitarianism]] is sometimes preferred by those advocating gender equality and equity among Christians who do not wish to associate themselves with the feminist movement.
Women apologists have become more visible in Christian academia. Their defense of the faith is differentiated by a more personal, cultural and listening approach "driven by love".&lt;ref&gt;Dilley, Andrea Palpant. "The Unexpected Defenders". Christianity Today. 59(April 2015)3. p. 40 [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2015/april/unexpected-defenders-meet-women-apologists.html?share=ezcmAqxPq8f4zfXVlfXVSEuYxmnuj0YV CT online edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
{{main|Islamic feminism}}
[[Islamic feminism]] is a form of feminism concerned with the role of [[Women and Islam|women in Islam]]. It aims for the full equality of all [[Muslims]], regardless of gender, in public and private life. Islamic feminists advocate [[women's rights]], [[gender equality]], and [[social justice]] grounded in an Islamic framework. Although rooted in [[Islam]], the movement's pioneers have also utilised [[Secularity|secular]] and European or non-Muslim feminist discourses and recognise the role of Islamic feminism as part of an integrated global feminist movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.feminismeislamic.org/eng/index.htm II International Congress on Islamic Feminism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208033317/http://www.feminismeislamic.org/eng/index.htm |date=December 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of the movement seek to highlight the deeply rooted teachings of equality in the [[Quran]] and encourage a questioning of the [[patriarchal]] interpretation of [[Islamic]] teaching through the Quran (holy book), ''[[hadith]]'' (sayings of [[Muhammad]]) and ''[[sharia]]'' (law) towards the creation of a more equal and just society.&lt;ref name="ahram"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2002/569/cu1.htm|title=Al-Ahram Weekly &amp;#124; Culture &amp;#124; Islamic feminism: what's in a name?|author=Margot Badran|publisher=weekly.ahram.org.eg|accessdate=2015-03-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320074746/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2002/569/cu1.htm|archivedate=2015-03-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muslim majority countries]] have produced more than seven female [[head of state|heads of state]], including [[Benazir Bhutto]] of [[Pakistan]], [[Mame Madior Boye]] of [[Senegal]], [[Tansu Çiller]] of [[Turkey]], and [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]] of [[Indonesia]].

===Sikhism===
{{Main|Women in Sikhism}}

In [[Sikhism]] women are equal to men, see the verse from the Sikh scripture the Guru Granth Sahib

"From woman, man is born;
within woman, man is conceived; to woman he is engaged and married.
Woman becomes his friend; through woman, the future generations come.
When his woman dies, he seeks another woman; to woman he is bound.
So why call her bad? From her, kings are born.
From woman, woman is born; without woman, there would be no one at all."

— Guru Nanak

===Hinduism===
{{See also|Feminism in India#Hindu feminism|Kalavati tantra}}
Within Ancient Hinduism, women have been held in equal honour as men. [[Manusmriti]] for example states: ''The society that provides respect and dignity to women flourishes with nobility and prosperity. And a society that does not put women on such a high pedestal has to face miseries and failures regardless of how so much noble deeds they perform otherwise.'' Manusmrithi Chapter 3 Verse 56.

Within the [[Vedas]] the Hindu holy texts, women were given the highest possible respect and equality. The [[Vedic]] period was glorified by this tradition. Many [[rishis]] were women. Indeed, several of them authored many of the slokas in the Vedas. For instance, in the Rigveda there is a list of women rishis. Some of them are: [[Ghosha]], [[Godha]], [[Gargi]], [[Vishwawra]], Apala, Upanishad, Brahmjaya, [[Aditi]], [[Indrani]], Sarma, Romsha, [[Maitreyi]], [[Kathyayini]], [[Urvashi]], [[Lopamudra]], Yami, [[Shashwati]], Sri, Laksha and many others. In the Vedic period women were free to enter into [[brahmacharya]] just like men, and attain [[salvation]].

During [[Hindu marriage]] ceremonies the following slokas are uttered by the grooms but, these days, their import little understood or ever attempted to understand.

"O bride! I accept your hand to enhance our joint good fortune. I pray to you to accept me as your husband and live with me until our old age. ..." ''Rigveda Samhita'' Part -4, sukta 85, sloka 9702

"O bride! May you be like the empress of your mother-in-law, father-in-law, sisters-in-law and brothers-in-law (sisters and brothers of the groom). May your writ run in your house." ''Rigveda Samhita'' Part -4, sukta 85, sloka 9712

This beautifully lyrical sloka from the Atharvaveda clearly states that the woman leads and the man follows: "The Sun God follows the first illuminated and enlightened goddess Usha (dawn) in the same manner as men emulate and follow women." ''Athravaveda Samhita'', Part 2, Kanda 27, sukta 107, sloka 5705.

Women were considered to be the embodiment of great virtue and wisdom. Thus we have: "O bride! May the knowledge of the Vedas be in front of you and behind you, in your centre and in your ends. May you conduct your life after attaining the knowledge of the Vedas. May you be benevolent, the harbinger of good fortune and health and live in great dignity and indeed illuminate your husband's home." ''Atharva Veda'' 14-1-64. Women were allowed full freedom of worship. "The wife should do agnihotra (yagna), sandhya (puja) and all other daily religious rituals. If, for some reason, her husband is not present, the woman alone has full rights to do yagna". ''Rigveda Samhita'', part 1, sukta 79, sloka 872.

Moving on towards the Monotheistic era of Hinduism when such ideals such as [[Shaivism]] and [[Vaishnavism]], a specific deity for feministic worship was bought about under the [[Shaktism]] branch. From a Hinduism point of view women are equal in all measures to men in comparison.

===Neopaganism===
{{main|Goddess movement|Dianic Wicca}}
Some currents of [[Neopaganism]], in particular [[Wicca]], have a [[Dualistic cosmology|ditheistic]] concept of a single goddess and a single god, who in [[hieros gamos]] represent a united whole. [[Polytheistic reconstructionism|Polytheistic reconstructionists]] focus on reconstructing polytheistic religions, including the various goddesses and figures associated with indigenous cultures.

The term ''[[thealogy]]'' is sometimes used in the context of the Neopagan Goddess movement, a pun on [[theology]] and ''thea'' θεά "goddess" intended to suggest a [[feminist]] approach to [[theism]].

The Goddess movement is a loose grouping of social and religious phenomena that grew out of [[second-wave feminism]], predominantly in North America, Western Europe, Australia, and New Zealand in the 1970s, and the metaphysical community as well. Spurred by the perception that women were not treated equitably in many religions, some women turned to a Female Deity as more in tune with their spiritual needs. Education in the Arts became a vehicle for the study of humanitarian philosophers like [[David Hume]] at that time. A unifying theme of this diverse movement is the femaleness of [[Deity]] (as opposed and contrasted to a [[patriarchal]] [[God]]).

[[Goddess]] beliefs take many forms: some people in the Goddess movement recognize multiple goddesses; some also include gods; others honour what they refer to as "the Goddess," which is not necessarily seen as monotheistic, but is often understood to be an inclusive, encompassing term incorporating many goddesses in many different cultures. The term "the Goddess" may also be understood to include a multiplicity of ways to view deity personified as female, or as a metaphor, or as a process. (Christ 1997, 2003) The term "The Goddess" may also refer to the concept of The One Divine Power, or the traditionally worshipped "Great Goddess" of ancient times.

In the latter part of the 20th century, feminism was influential in the rise of [[Neopaganism]] in the [[United States]], and particularly the [[Dianic tradition]]. Some feminists find the worship of a [[goddess]], rather than a [[god]], to be consonant with their views. Others are polytheists, and worship a number of goddesses. The collective set of beliefs associated with this is sometimes known as [[thealogy]] and sometimes referred to as the [[Goddess movement]]. See also [[Dianic Wicca]].

===Buddhism===

The '''Harlem Children's Zone''' (HCZ) is a [[non-profit organization]] for poverty-stricken children and families living in [[Harlem]], providing free support in the form of parenting workshops, a [[pre-school]] program, three [[charter school]]s, and child-oriented health programs for thousands of children and families. The HCZ is "aimed at doing nothing less than breaking the cycle of [[Cycle of poverty|generational poverty]] for the thousands of children and
families it serves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hcz.org/what-is-hcz/history |title=Harlem Children's Zone History |accessdate=2008-10-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202093451/http://hcz.org/what-is-hcz/history |archivedate=2009-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In part because not enough time has passed, there is not evidence available that the HCZ achieves its central goal.

The Harlem Children's Zone Project has expanded the HCZ's comprehensive system of programs to nearly 100 blocks of Central Harlem and aims to keep children on track through college and into the job market.&lt;ref name="TheHczProject"&gt;{{cite web

The HCZ and its promotion as a model of education to aspire to, especially in the recent documentary ''[[Waiting for "Superman"]],'' have been criticized as an example of the privatization of education in the U.S.&lt;ref name = "AyersHP"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rick-ayers-/an-inconvenient-superman-_b_716420.html?view=print An Inconvenient Superman: Davis Guggenheim's New Film Hijacks School Reform] by Rick Ayers, ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', September 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; University of San Francisco Adjunct Professor in Education, Rick Ayers writes that ''Waiting for "Superman"'' "never mentions the tens of millions of dollars of private money that has poured into the Harlem Children's Zone, the model and superman we are relentlessly instructed to aspire to."&lt;ref name = "AyersHP" /&gt; One year after this film was made, the Grassroots Education Movement&lt;ref&gt;[http://gemnyc.org/ Grassroots Education Movement (NYC)]&lt;/ref&gt; made a film titled ''[[The Inconvenient Truth Behind Waiting for Superman]]'', which accused the original film of exaggerating the success of the HCZ.

==Principles and programs==

The HCZ designs, funds, and operates a holistic system of education, social-services and community-building programs in [[Harlem]] to counter the negative influences of crime, drugs and poverty and help children complete college and go on to the job market.&lt;ref name="TheHczProject" /&gt; Providing this "full network of services... to an entire neighborhood from birth to college" is a key element of the Obama administration's Promise Neighborhoods program modeled after the HCZ.&lt;ref name="Obama20Promise" /&gt;

The two fundamental principles of The Zone Project are to help kids as early in their lives as possible and to create a critical mass of adults around them who understand what it takes to help children succeed.&lt;ref name="TheHczProject" /&gt;

Components of the HCZ programs include the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2008 President Obama, inspired by the Harlem Children's Zone immense progress toward breaking the generational cycle of poverty, proposed the creation of [[Promise Neighborhoods]]. Obama's commitment to alleviating poverty is put into place with this initiative which uses HCZ's "cradle to college" approach. "The initiative seeks to help selected local communities dramatically improve outcomes and opportunities for children and families in defined neighborhoods. The initiative will be diverse in its application, reflecting local needs and context." The initiative's goal follows the HCZ's paradigm to improve every aspect of life in impoverished communities, its purpose states: "all children growing up in Promise Neighborhoods have access to effective schools and strong systems of family and community support that will prepare them to attain an excellent education and successfully transition from college to career." This purpose statement directly reflects the mission of HCZ. HCZ, in collaboration with the national action institute PolicyLink, assists in providing ongoing guidance for the Obama administration in this initiative.&lt;ref name="policylink.org"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.policylink.org/site/c.lkIXLbMNJrE/b.5136647/k.3BB1/Creating_Promise_Neighborhoods.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-08-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713152718/http://www.policylink.org/site/c.lkIXLbMNJrE/b.5136647/k.3BB1/Creating_Promise_Neighborhoods.htm |archive-date=2010-07-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the Obama administration allocated $75 million in the federal budget for the program. More than 330 communities across the nation applied for Promise Neighborhood planning grants. Twenty-one communities were awarded one-year grants between $400,000 and $500,000. Planning grantees are given a year to produce a strategic paradigm which will address the issues specific to their community in pursuit of an implementation grant. The grantees submitted their plans that summer, with the implementation phase for Promise Neighborhoods expected to begin in September 2011.&lt;ref name="policylink.org"/&gt;

They also report that "because it lost more ground than comparable schools, it got a C from the city on its annual A-to-F report card, and an F in the student progress category," while giving credit for the increased math scores of many students in the school.

The U.S. radio show ''[[This American Life]]'' produced an episode about the HCZ which aired on 26 September 2008, 11 October 2008, and 14 August 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Evaluation ==

In part because not enough time has passed, there is not evidence available to know whether the HCZ achieves its central goal of ending intergenerational poverty.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.impact.upenn.edu/lets_not_dismiss_the_harlem_childrens_zone_just_yet/&lt;/ref&gt;

HCZ has had many impacts, on its students, community, and federal programs. President Obama created a grant program to copy HCZ's block-by-block approach to ending poverty. Obama requested $210 million for the program.&lt;ref name=nyt2010/&gt;

Thirty-eight percent of Promise Academy I's students in third through sixth grade passed the 2010 English test, placing it in the lower half of charter schools citywide and below the city's overall passing rate of 42 percent. It outperformed Harlem as a whole, where just 29 percent of children passed.&lt;ref name=nyt2010/&gt;

Promise Academy II, an elementary school that occupies part of a public school building, did better, with 62 percent passing in English, among the top 10 percent of charters. But because it lost more ground than comparable schools, it got a C from the city on its annual A-to-F report card and an F in the student progress category. Both schools continued to outperform the city in math, with 60 percent passing in one school and 81 percent in the other.&lt;ref name=nyt2010/&gt;

One Harvard study found that Promise Academy students who entered the sixth grade in 2005 had raised their test scores so much by the eighth grade that they had "reversed the black-white achievement gap in mathematics" and reduced it in English. In 2009, nearly all the students passed the math test.&lt;ref name=nyt2010/&gt;

HCZ's after-school college advice office has helped place 650 students in college. Its asthma initiative has drastically reduced emergency room visits and missed school days among its 1,000 participants. Preschool students have made bounds in kindergarten readiness. Parent satisfaction in the charter schools, as measured by city surveys, is high.&lt;ref name=nyt2010/&gt;

A Brookings report finds that the HCZ increased middle school math test scores more than other academic indicators, yet it finds inconclusive data to support the holistic approach taken by the HCZ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Harlem Children's Zone, Promise Neighborhoods, and the Broader, Bolder Approach to Education |url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/reports/2010/07/20-hcz-whitehurst}}&lt;/ref&gt; For elementary school years, however, some research has concluded that the HCZ has positive impacts on both math and English language arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Will Dobbie |author2=Roland G. Fryer, Jr |title=Are High Quality Schools Enough to Close the Achievement Gap? Evidence from a Social Experiment in Harlem|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w15473|accessdate=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A March 2010 report in ''[[City Limits (New York magazine)|City Limits]]'' discusses the "stunning rate of teacher turnover the Promise Academies have posted. In 2006-07, a third of Promise Academy I's teachers left or were dismissed. The year before 48 percent were fired or quit. Only one of the original teachers is still with the Promise Academy middle school." It goes on to quote the treasurer of the board of the HCZ, Mitch Kurz as saying, "We developed a lot of grand plans, educational philosophies, and we overlooked sort of the fundamental aspect of running a successful school, and that is managing the culture of the school."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is the Promise Real: The Harlem Children's Zone Becomes a Template for National Change|author=Helen Zelon|url=http://www.phoenixworks.org/PLSC240/Zelon.pdf|date=March 2010|accessdate=2012-10-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130909015154/http://www.phoenixworks.org/PLSC240/Zelon.pdf|archive-date=2013-09-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13704">{{Environmental law}}
An '''international environmental agreement''' or sometimes '''environmental [[Protocol (politics)|protocol]]''', is a type of [[treaty]] binding in [[international law]], allowing them to reach an [[environment (biophysical)|environmental]] goal. In other words, it is "an intergovernmental document intended as legally binding with a primary stated purpose of preventing or managing human impacts on natural resources."&lt;ref&gt;Kanie (2007) Governance with Multi-lateral Environmental Agreements: A healthy or ill-equipped fragmentation? in Global Environmental Governance: Perspectives on the Current Debate, edited by Walter Hoffmann and Lydia Swart: 67-86. New York: Center for UN Reform Education&lt;/ref&gt; An agreement between two nations is known as a '''bilateral environmental agreement'''.

If the agreement is made among three or more nations, it is called a '''multilateral environmental agreement''' (MEA). Such agreements, primarily produced by the [[United Nations]], cover subjects such as [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] policies, freshwater policies, [[hazardous waste]] and substance policies, the marine environment, nature conservation policies, [[noise pollution]] and nuclear safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/stable/20096800|title=Birnie, P. (1977). The Development of International Environmental Law. British Journal of International Studies,3(2), 169-190.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=={{anchor|History|The need for environmental action through MEAs}}History and use==
The use of multilateral environment agreements began in 1857, when a German agreement regulated the flow of water from [[Lake Constance]] to [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; International environmental protocols came to feature in [[environmental governance]] after trans-boundary [[pollution|environmental problems]] became widely perceived in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Haas"&gt;Haas, Keohane and Levy (1993) Institutions for the Earth: Sources of effective international environmental protection Massachusetts Institute of Technology&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1857 and 2012, a total of 747 multilateral environmental agreements have been concluded.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Following the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment|Stockholm Intergovernmental Conference]] in 1972, creation of international environmental agreements proliferated.&lt;ref name="zurn"&gt;Zürn (1998) The Rise of International Environmental Politics: A Review of Current Research  World Politics, Vol. 50, No. 4, pp. 617-649&lt;/ref&gt; MEAs were popularized by the [[United Nations]], the majority of MEAs have been implemented since the 1972 at the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] (also known as the Stockholm Conference).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Environment Canada. (2007). Negotiator's handbook: multilateral environment agreement.   Joensuu, Finland: University of Joensuu.&lt;/ref&gt; The Stockholm Declaration was adopted by all 113 countries in attendance at the conference, and was the first universal document of importance on an environmental issue.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A complex networking system is needed for a functional MEA system.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Kim, R. E. (2013). The emergent network structure of the multilateral environmental agreement system. Global Environmental Change, 23(5), 980-991. doi:10.1016/j.gloenvcha. 2013.07.006.&lt;/ref&gt; Levels of government within a nation may impede each other about [[climate change]] (for example) due to opposing views or parties,&lt;ref&gt;Eckersley, P. (2016). "Cities and climate change: how historical legacies shape policymaking in   English and German municipalities." Politics: 1-16.&lt;/ref&gt; making implementation more difficult and impacting external relationships.

Policies surrounding an MEA are determined by the participating countries. The United Nations and the [[World Trade Organization]] are key [[intergovernmental organization]]s for forging and implementating the agreements.

==Effectiveness==
Protocols can take flexible approaches to improve effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Tolba (1998) Global Environmental Diplomacy: Negotiating agreements for the world 1973-1992 Massachusetts Institute of Technology&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the use of sanctions: under the [[Montreal Protocol]], signatories were forbidden to purchase [[chlorofluorocarbons]] from nonsignatories, in order to prevent any windfall benefits.&lt;ref name="French"/&gt; Funding has also been used to overcome North-South conflict: members of the Montreal Protocol created a fund of $240 million to redistribute the costs of transition. Differential obligations as seen in the [[Kyoto Protocol]] can also encourage wider participation.

While protocols appear to be the ultimate [[Top-down and bottom-up design|top-down]] mode of governance, having "scant provisions for [[public participation]],"&lt;ref name="French"/&gt; it is widely thought that the influence of transnational networks has been growing&lt;ref name="zurn"/&gt; Public opinion is relevant, as concern must exist to prompt action and dedication of government resources.&lt;ref name="Haas"/&gt; [[Non-governmental organization]]s also fulfill certain roles, from gathering information and devising policies to mobilising support. Science plays an important part, although Susskind asserts that sometimes this role is diminished by uncertainty, disagreement, and the rise of "adversary science."&lt;ref&gt;Susskind (1994) Environmental diplomacy: negotiating more effective global Oagreements Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;  The business community can also be involved with positive outcomes.

How we view the effectiveness of protocols depends on what we expect from them. With little administrative force or actual power, protocols succeed in increasing government concern, enhancing the contractual environment, and heightening capacity through transfer of assets. Yet as long as sovereignty is intact, environmental protocols will not affect changes in the face of state or public apathy, guarantee national action, or materialize overnight. The progress of international environmental law might be, as Wiener suggests, like the tortoise, slow but steady.&lt;ref&gt;Wiener (1999) On the political economy of global environmental regulation   Georgetown Law Journal, Volume 87, pp. 749 - 794&lt;/ref&gt;

==Barriers and criticism==
The world's existing political systems pose barriers to the creation of environmental protocols. First, maintenance of [[sovereignty]] means that no country can be forced to participate, only urged to do so. Consequently, as French states, "International law has the force of moral suasion, but few real teeth."&lt;ref name="French"&gt;French (1994) Strengthening International Environmental Governance The Journal of Environment Development 3: 59&lt;/ref&gt; Second, [[North–South divide|North-South conflict]] can block cooperation: the countries in the global South generally see the countries of the North as needing to take responsibility for [[environmental degradation]] and make significant changes in their way of living, neither of which the North deems reasonable. 

Finally, countries may lack motivation to change their environmental policies due to conflict with other interests, especially economic prosperity. If environmental protocols will cause economic difficulties or harm to a country, it may shirk the protocols while other countries adhere to them, creating a classic [[Free rider problem|free-rider problem]]. Additionally, environmental protocols may be criticized for [[Uncertainty|scientific uncertainty]], or at least a lack of synthesis of scientific information, which may be used for "blocking interests and doing mischief."&lt;ref name="zurn"/&gt;

Due to these barriers, environmental protocols become an obvious target for several criticisms, such as being slow to produce the desired effects (due to the convention-protocol-ratification-implementation process), tending to the [[lowest common denominator]], and lacking monitoring and enforcement. They can also be criticized for taking an incremental approach where [[sustainable development]] principles suggest that environmental concern should be mainstreamed.

=== United Nations ===
The United Nations is involved in MEAs worldwide on a number of issues, including biological diversity, chemicals and waste, and climate and the atmosphere. One example would be the [[Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer]], which was brought together to address the hazardous effects of [[Chlorofluorocarbon|Chlorofluorocarbons]] on the atmosphere. The United Nations Information Portal (InforMEA) brings together MEAs by harvesting COP decisions and resolutions, news, events, MEA membership, national focal points, national reports and implementation plans from MEA secretariats and organizes this information around a set of agreed terms, for the benefit of Parties and the environment community at large&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.informea.org/en|title=InforMEA - United Nations Information Portal on Multilateral Environmental Agreements|website=www.informea.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World Trade Organization ===
The [[World Trade Organization]] has been involved in MEA negotiations due to the agreements' trade implications. The organization has trade and environmental policies which promote the protection and preservation of the environment. Its objective is to reduce trade barriers and coordinate trade-related measures with [[Environmental policy|environmental policies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wto.org/|title=World Trade Organization - Home page|website=www.wto.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since MEAs protect and preserve the environment, they may help ease restrictions on trade.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, L. (2014). Trade and Environment: Mutually Supportive Interpretation of WTO Agreements in Light of Multilateral Environmental Agreements. New Zealand Journal of Public and International Law 12(2), 379-412.&lt;/ref&gt; The WTO’s principles are based on non-discrimination, free trade through reduction of trade barriers and fair competition, and MEAs have been rejected for not being in accordance with the organization's principles. The WTO is working with and implementing over 350 MEAs worldwide.{{cn|date=November 2017}} Most of the agreements involve five core countries{{which|date=November 2017}} which are committed to environmental improvement and free trade.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Millimet, D. L., &amp; Roy, J. (2015). Multilateral environmental agreements and the WTO. Economics Letters,134, 20-23. doi:10.1016/j.econlet.2015.05.035&lt;/ref&gt; WTO members are legally bound to respect negotiated reductions of barriers to trade.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, conflict has arisen due to trade restriction.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== {{anchor|Countries contributing to MEAs}}Major MEA participants ==
=== Australia ===
[[Australia]] is noted for its wide variety of animal species and diverse environment, which includes [[beach]]es, [[desert]]s and mountains,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/about-us/international|title=Department of the Environment and Energy|website=Department of the Environment and Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[climate change]] is a major concern. The country is under the largest [[Ozone depletion|ozone hole]] in the world,{{cn|date=November 2017}} with environmental impact. Australia's proximity to [[Antarctica]] raises concerns about sea-level rise and changes in ocean currents which influence climate.

=== Canada ===
[[Canada]]'s multilateral environmental agreements encompass air, [[biodiversity]] and [[ecosystem]]s, chemicals and waste, [[climate change]], environmental cooperation, marine and the oceans, and [[meteorology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ec.gc.ca/international/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=0E5CED79-1#X-++201501201052415|title=Participation in international environmental agreements - Canada.ca|first=Environment and Climate Change|last=Canada|website=www.ec.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada has taken an initiative due to the country's variety of [[natural resource]]s, [[climate]]s and populated areas, all of which can contribute to environmental stress.

=== United States===
The United States has committed to the [[Montreal Protocol]] on Substances that Deplete the [[Ozone layer|Ozone Layer]], and global negotiations on [[Mercury (element)|mercury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ustr.gov/issue-areas/environment/multilateral-environmental-agreements|title=Multilateral Environmental Agreements - United States Trade Representative|website=ustr.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of MEAs in which the U.S. is involved is substantially lower than Canada's, despite its greater population and larger [[carbon footprint]] and economy.

In addition to holdings by central banks and other institutions, there are many private holdings, which are believed{{By whom|date=February 2011}} to be mostly in one-hundred-dollar [[banknotes]] (indeed, most American banknotes actually are held outside the United States). All holdings of U.S.-dollar bank deposits held by non-residents of the United States are known as "[[eurodollar]]s" (not to be confused with the [[euro]]), regardless of the location of the bank holding the deposit (which may be inside or outside the U.S.).

Economist [[Paul Samuelson]] and others (including, at his death, [[Milton Friedman]]) have maintained that the overseas demand for dollars allows the United States to maintain persistent [[trade deficit]]s without causing the value of the currency to depreciate or the flow of trade to readjust.  But Samuelson stated in 2005 that at some uncertain future period these pressures would precipitate a run against the U.S. dollar with serious global financial consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.people.com.cn/200512/26/eng20051226_230852.html |title=China, U.S. should adjust approach to economic growth |publisher=English.people.com.cn |date=2005-12-26 |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International reserve currency==
{{main|Reserve currency}}
The U.S. dollar is an important international [[reserve currency]] along with the [[euro]]. The euro inherited this status from the [[German mark]], and since its introduction, has increased its standing considerably, mostly at the expense of the dollar. Despite the dollar's recent losses to the euro, it is still by far the major international reserve currency, with an accumulation more than double that of the euro.

In August 2007, two scholars affiliated with the government of the People's Republic of China threatened to sell its substantial reserves in American dollars in response to American legislative discussion of trade sanctions designed to revalue the [[Chinese yuan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2007/08/07/bcnchina107a.xml | title=China threatens 'nuclear option' of dollar sales.  | accessdate=September 26, 2007 | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | first=Ambrose | last=Evans-Pritchard | date=2007-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese government denied that selling dollar-denominated assets would be an official policy in the foreseeable future.

Former [[Federal Reserve]] Chairman [[Alan Greenspan]] said in September 2007 that the euro could replace the U.S. dollar as the world's primary reserve currency. It is "absolutely conceivable that the euro will replace the dollar as reserve currency, or will be traded as an equally important reserve currency."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Reuters | work=Euro could replace dollar as top currency - Greenspan | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/bondsNews/idUSL1771147920070917 | accessdate=September 17, 2007 | date=2007-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. Dollar Index==

{{Main|U.S. Dollar Index}}

The U.S. Dollar Index (Ticker: USDX) is the creation of the [[New York Board of Trade]] (NYBOT), renamed in September 2007 to ICE Futures US. It was established in 1973 for tracking the value of the USD against a [[Currency basket|basket of currencies]], which, at that time, represented the largest trading partners of the United States. It began with 17 currencies from 17 nations, but the launch of the euro subsumed 12 of these into one, so the USDX tracks only six currencies today.

|}

The Index is described by the ICE as "a geometrically-averaged calculation of six currencies weighted against the U.S. dollar."&lt;ref name="ICE" /&gt;&amp;nbsp; The baseline of 100.00 on the USDX was set at its launch in March 1973. This event marks the watershed between the wider margins arrangement of the [[Smithsonian Agreement|Smithsonian]] regime and the period of generalized floating that led up to the Second Amendment of the Articles of Agreement of the [[International Monetary Fund]]. Since 1973, the USDX has climbed as high as the 160s and drifted as low as the 70s.

The USDX has not been updated to reflect new trading realities in the global economy, where the bulk of trade has shifted strongly towards new partners like China and Mexico and oil-exporting countries while the United States has [[Deindustrialization|de-industrialized]].

==Dollarization and fixed exchange rates==

{{main|Dollarization}}

Other nations besides the United States use the U.S. dollar as their official currency, a process known as official [[dollarization]]. For instance, [[Panama]] has been using the dollar alongside the [[Panamanian balboa]] as the legal tender since 1904 at a conversion rate of 1:1. [[Economy of Ecuador|Ecuador]] (2000), [[Economy of El Salvador|El Salvador]] (2001), and [[Economy of East Timor|East Timor]] (2000) all adopted the currency independently. The former members of the U.S.-administered [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]], which included [[Palau]], the [[Federated States of Micronesia]], and the [[Marshall Islands]], chose not to issue their own currency after becoming independent, having all used the U.S. dollar since 1944. Two British dependencies also use the U.S. dollar: the [[British Virgin Islands]] (1959) and [[Turks and Caicos Islands]] (1973). The islands [[Bonaire]], [[Sint Eustatius]] and [[Saba]], now collectively known as the [[Caribbean Netherlands]], adopted the dollar on January 1, 2011, as a result of the [[dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sxmislandtime.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=10606|title=Introduction of the US dollar on Bonaire, St Eustatius and Saba|publisher=sxmislandtime.com|date=26 May 2010|accessdate=2010-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rnw.nl/english/bulletin/us-dollar-introduced-dutch-caribbean-islands|title=US dollar introduced in Dutch Caribbean islands|publisher=Radio Netherlands Worldwide|date=1 Jan 2011|accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. dollar is an official currency in [[Zimbabwe]], along with the [[Euro]], the [[Pound Sterling]], the [[Botswana Pula|Pula]], the [[South African rand|Rand]], and several other currencies.

Some countries that have adopted the U.S. dollar issue their own coins: See [[Ecuadorian centavo coins]], [[Panamanian balboa|Panamanian Balboa]] and [[East Timor centavo coins]].

A series of [[Zimbabwean Bond Coins]] was put into circulation on 18 December 2014 in 1, 5, 10, and 25 cent denominations. A 50 cent Bond Coin was released in March 2015. These coins are pegged at the same rate as American coins.

Some other countries link their currency to U.S. dollar at a [[fixed exchange rate]]. The local currencies of [[Economy of Bermuda|Bermuda]] and [[Economy of the Bahamas|the Bahamas]] can be freely exchanged at a 1:1 ratio for USD. [[Argentina]] used a fixed 1:1 [[exchange rate]] between the [[Argentine peso]] and the U.S. dollar from 1991 until 2002. The currencies of [[Economy of Barbados|Barbados]] and [[Economy of Belize|Belize]] are similarly convertible at an approximate 2:1 ratio. The [[Netherlands Antillean guilder]] (and its successor the [[Caribbean guilder]]) and the [[Aruban florin]] are pegged to the dollar at a fixed rate of 1:1.79. The [[East Caribbean dollar]] is pegged to the dollar at a fixed rate of 2.7:1, and is used by all of the countries and territories of the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States|OECS]] other than the [[British Virgin Islands]].  In [[Economy of Lebanon|Lebanon]], one dollar is equal to 1500 [[Lebanese pound]], and is used interchangeably with local currency as de facto legal tender. The exchange rate between the [[Hong Kong dollar]] and the United States dollar has also been [[linked exchange rate|linked]] since 1983 at HK$7.8/USD, and [[Macanese pataca|pataca]] of [[Macau]], pegged to Hong Kong dollar at MOP1.03/HKD, indirectly linked to the U.S. dollar at roughly MOP8/USD. Several oil-producing [[Arab]] countries on the Persian Gulf, including [[Saudi Arabia]], peg their currencies to the dollar, since the dollar is the currency used in the international oil trade.

The [[People's Republic of China]]'s [[renminbi]] was informally and controversially pegged to the dollar in the mid-1990s at ¥ 8.28/USD. Likewise, [[Malaysia]] pegged its [[Malaysian ringgit|ringgit]] at RM3.8/USD in September 1998, after the [[1997 Asian financial crisis|financial crisis]]. On July 21, 2005, both countries removed their pegs and adopted managed floats against a basket of currencies. [[Kuwait]] did likewise on May 20, 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kuwait pegs dinar to basket of currencies |url=https://www.forbes.com/markets/feeds/afx/2007/05/20/afx3739653.html |publisher=[[Forbes]] |date=2007-05-20 |accessdate=2007-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110003139/http://www.forbes.com/markets/feeds/afx/2007/05/20/afx3739653.html |archivedate=November 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Syria]] did likewise in July 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Syria to Drop Dollar Peg in July |url=http://moneynews.newsmax.com/money/archives/articles/2007/6/4/120846.cfm |publisher=Reuters |date=2007-06-04 |accessdate=2007-09-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110051911/http://moneynews.newsmax.com/money/archives/articles/2007/6/4/120846.cfm |archivedate=2008-01-10 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after three years of slow appreciation, the Chinese yuan has been ''de facto'' re-pegged to the dollar since July 2008 at a value of ¥6.83/USD; although no official announcement had been made, the yuan has remained around that value within a narrow band since then, similar to the Hong Kong dollar.

Several countries use a [[crawling peg]] model, wherein currency is [[devaluation|devalued]] at a fixed rate relative to the dollar. For example, the [[Nicaraguan córdoba]] is devalued by 5% per annum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nicaragua seeks to de-dollarize economy |first=Tim |last=Rogers |date=May 13, 2014 |work=The Nicaragua Dispatch |url=http://nicaraguadispatch.com/2014/05/nicaragua-seeks-to-de-dollarize-economy/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Belarus]], on the other hand, pegged its currency, the [[Belarusian ruble]], to a basket of foreign currencies (U.S. dollar, euro and [[Russia]]n ruble) in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = New exchange rate will make Belarusian exports competitive, NBRB vows | url = http://gtk.gov.by/en/news?id=1587 | publisher = State Customs Committee of the Republic of Belarus | date = 2009-01-06 | accessdate = 2009-01-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 this led to a [[currency crisis]] when the government became unable to honor its promise to convert Belarusian rubles to foreign currencies at a fixed exchange rate. BYR exchange rates dropped by two thirds, all import prices rose and living standards fell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-14919823 | work=BBC News | title=Belarusian rouble falls sharply in value | date=2011-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, such as [[Costa Rica]] and [[Honduras]], the U.S. dollar is commonly accepted, although not officially regarded as legal tender. In Mexico's northern border area and major tourist zones, it is accepted as if it were a second legal currency. Many Canadian merchants close to the border, as well as large stores in big cities and major tourist hotspots in [[Peru]] also accept U.S. dollars, though usually at a value that favours the merchant. In [[Cambodia]], U.S. notes circulate freely and are preferred over the [[Cambodian riel]] for large purchases,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Chinese University of Hong Kong]] |url=http://intl.econ.cuhk.edu.hk/exchange_rate_regime/index.php?cid=13 |title=Historical Exchange Rate Regime of Asian Countries: Cambodia |accessdate=2007-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208100605/http://intl.econ.cuhk.edu.hk/exchange_rate_regime/index.php?cid=13 |archivedate=2006-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kurt Schuler |url=http://users.erols.com/kurrency/asia.htm |title=Tables of Modern Monetary History: Asia |accessdate=2007-02-21 |quote=The U.S. dollar also circulates freely |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219231722/http://users.erols.com/kurrency/asia.htm |archivedate=2007-02-19 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the riel used for change to break 1 USD. After the U.S. liberation of Afghanistan, U.S. dollars are accepted as if it were legal tender.

Not long after the introduction of the [[euro]] (€; [[ISO 4217]] code EUR) as a cash currency in 2002, and the [[Financial cost of the Iraq War|Iraq War costs]] from 2003,{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} the dollar began to depreciate steadily in value, as it did against other major currencies.&lt;ref name="2007depreciation"&gt;

In addition to the trade deficit, the U.S. dollar's decline was linked to a variety of other factors, including [[2000s energy crisis|a major spike in oil prices]].&lt;ref name="2008oilprices"&gt;

==Chinese-issued U.S. dollar bonds==

The issuance of U.S dollar-denominated bond issued by Chinese institutions doubled to $214 billion in 2017 as tighter domestic regulations and market conditions saw Chinese companies look offshore to conduct their fund-raising initiatives. This has far outpaced many of the other major foreign currency bonds issued in Asia in the last few years.

The anticipated continuation of a prudent monetary policy in China to curb financial risks and asset bubbles, along with the expectation of a stronger yuan will likely see Chinese companies to continue to issue U.S. dollar bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201801/03/WS5a4c1bb6a31008cf16da4bd1.html|title=Sales of bonds look set to rise this year|accessdate=2018-11-27 | author=Li Xiang|work=China Daily| date=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major issuers of U.S. dollar denominated bonds have included Tencent Holdings Limited, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited and Sinopec Group. In 2017, China’s Ministry of Finance revealed plans to sell US$2 billion worth of U.S. dollar sovereign bonds in Hong Kong, its first dollar bond offering since October 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.scmp.com/business/money/stock-talk/article/2114932/china-issue-first-dollar-bonds-2004-hong-kong|title=China to sell first dollar bond in 13 years in Hong Kong to set benchmark for Chinese issuers|accessdate=2018-11-27 | author=Karen Yeung | work=South China Morning Post | date=2017-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technology and communications sector in China is a taking significant share of the offshore U.S. dollar bond market. Tencent priced $5 billion of notes in January 2018 as a string of Asian technology firms continued to issue debt as market values swelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/tencent-joins-asia-tech-debt-rush-with-its-biggest-bond-sale-1515742849|title=Tencent Joins Asia-Tech Debt Rush With Its Biggest Bond Sale|accessdate=2018-11-27 | author=Manju Dalal| work=The Wall Street Journal | date=2018-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These were developed by travelling Showman groups in the 1800s for both shelter and transportation. They were quickly adopted by itinerant groups in Europe.]]

Traveller peoples in Europe and the British Isles, including both Indigenous Travellers and [[Romani people|Romani people]].

There are a number of traditionally itinerant or travelling groups in Europe who are known as "travellers" or "[[Gypsy (term)|gypsies]]".

The largest of these groups are the [[Romani people]], of [[Indian subcontinent|Indian]] origin, who entered Europe in the 14th–15th century; this includes the [[Sinti|Sinti people]], who are themselves the second largest group. The third largest group in Europe is the [[Yenish people|Yenish]], an indigenous [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] group.

The origins of the indigenous itinerant groups are unclear. They have been assumed to have taken up the travelling lifestyle out of necessity at some point during the [[Early Modern period]] but to not be ethnically distinct from their source population. However, recent DNA testing has shown that the [[Irish Travellers]] are genetically distinct from their settled counterparts, and more groups are being studied.

Many groups speak their own language or dialect (distinct from the settled population); it's often a blend of the local settled language and [[Romani language]], even in non-Romani groups.

As opposed to [[Nomadic peoples of Europe|nomads]] who travel with and subsist on herds of livestock, itinerant groups traditionally travel for trade or other work for the [[sedentism|sedentary]] populations amongst which they live.

== Indigenous Dutch Travellers ==
Indigenous Travellers in the Netherlands ("caravan dwellers" or "Woonwagenbewoner") are first mentioned in the 1879 census, although boat dwellers who practised the same professions (chair bottomers, traders, peddlers, artisans, etc.) were common before then.&lt;ref&gt;''Gypsies and Other Itinerant Groups: A Socio-Historical Approach'' by Leo Lucassen, Wim Willems, Anne-Marie Cottaar, the Centre for the History of Migrants, University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands, 1998 Macmillan Press Ltd, {{ISBN|978-1-349-26343-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Indigenous Norwegian Travellers ==
{{main|Indigenous Norwegian Travellers}}
A group who call themselves Reisende; i.e. indigenous Norwegian Travellers. Confusingly, this term is also used by the [[Tater people]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}, the biggest population of Romani people in Norway and Sweden.
Unlike the Tater people, the indigenous Norwegian Travellers are non-Roma by culture and origins, and they do not speak any form of Romani language.

==Irish Travellers (Pavee)==
{{main| Irish Travellers }}
The Pavee are ethnically [[Irish people|Irish]], but have a separate language and culture than the settled Irish.&lt;ref&gt;Ethnicity and the American cemetery by Richard E. Meyer. 1993. "... though many of them crossed the Atlantic in centuries past to play their trade".&lt;/ref&gt; They live predominantly in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;''Questioning Gypsy identity: ethnic narratives in Britain and America'' by Brian Belton &lt;!-- ISBN#? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Travellers refer to themselves as Minceir or Pavees in their own language or in Irish as an Lucht Siúil, meaning literally "the walking people". The term '''Pikey''' is a [[pejorative]] [[slang]] term used mainly in the United Kingdom to refer to Irish Travellers. The language of the Irish Travellers, [[Shelta]], is mainly based on an [[Irish language|Irish Gaelic]] lexicon and an English grammar. There are two dialects of this language: Gammon (or Gamin) and Cant. It has been dated back to the eighteenth century but may be older.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Gmlech, op. cit., p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of Irish Travellers are [[Roman Catholics]] who maintain their traditions and culture in a close knit community of families.

In 2011 an analysis of DNA from 40 Travellers showed that Irish Travellers are a distinct Irish ethnic minority who separated from the settled Irish community at least 1000 years ago; the claim was made that they are as distinct from the settled community as [[Icelanders]] are from [[Norwegians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hough|first=Jennifer|date=2011-05-31|title=DNA study: Travellers a distinct ethnicity|website=irishexaminer.com|location=Blackpool, IE|publisher=Irish Examiner|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/health/dna-study-travellers-a-distinct-ethnicity-156324.html|access-date=2016-05-17|quote=separated from the settled community between 1,000 and 2,000 years ago.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other itinerant groups they have often been racially discriminated against in the past and still are today. They were only recognised as an official [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] group in the [[Republic of Ireland]] on March 1, 2017.

== Quinqui ==
{{main|Quinqui}}
The ''[[Quinqui]]'' or ''[[mercheros]]'' of Spain are a minority group, formerly nomadic, who share a similar way of life with the Spanish Roma. There are a few theories about their origin: they may be peasants who lost their land in the 16th century, descendants of Muslims who took to nomadism to avoid persecution, or marginalised people who have mixed with Roma. Most likely they are a mixture of all of the above. In spite of sharing persecution and mores with the Roma, the Quinqui have often set themselves apart from them.

== Romani ==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J0525-0500-003, Rheinland, Sinti und Roma mit Wohnwagen auf Landstraße.jpg|thumb|[[Sinti]] Romanies in the [[Rhineland]], 1935.]]
{{main|Romani people}}
The best known of these communities are the [[Romani people]] (also ''Romany'', ''Romanies'' ''Tzigani'', ''Rromani'', and variants).
The Romani are of [[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] origin and first entered Europe via the Middle East during the 14th century. They spread further through Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries, separating into various subgroups in the process.

== Scottish Gypsy and Traveller groups==
{{main|Scottish Gypsy and Traveller groups}}
There are multiple Gypsy and Traveller groups in Scotland: the indigenous Scottish Highland Travellers also known as ''Ceardannan'' ([[Scottish Gaelic]] which means "the craftsmen" or 'Black Tinkers') or more poetically as the "Summer Walkers", Scottish Border Gypsies (who are a Romani group), and Lowland Scottish Gypsy/Travellers, whose origins are unclear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambaile.org.uk/en/sub_section.jsp?SectionID=6&amp;currentId=199 The Summer Walkers]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambaile.org.uk/en/education/travelling_people/src1.jsp Origins of the Summer Walkers].&lt;/ref&gt; The English term 'Travelling People' has been adopted into contemporary Gaelic as "luchd siubhail" (people of travel) but this is a wider term covering other groups of itinerant communities within Scotland.

The Scottish Highland Travellers have their own now nearly extinct language based on Scottish Gaelic called [[Beurla Reagaird]] (or English Backwards). Highland Travellers are closely tied to their native Highlands the native Gaelic speaking population; they may follow a [[nomadic]] or a settled lifestyle. They have played an essential role in the preservation of traditional Gaelic culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambaile.org.uk/en/education/travelling_people/src1.jsp Travelling People — Highland Travellers].&lt;/ref&gt; Travellers' outstanding contribution to Highland life has been as custodians of an ancient and vital Gaelic singing, storytelling and folklore tradition of great importance. It is estimated that only 2,000 '''Scottish Highland Travellers''' continue to lead their traditional lifestyle on the roads.

== Yenish ==
[[File:Jenische um1890 Muotathal CHe.jpg|thumb|upright|Two Jenische in [[Muotathal]], Switzerland, ca. 1890]]
{{main|Yenish people}}
In [[German-speaking Europe]], [[France]] and [[Wallonia]],
there are the [[Yenish people|''Jenische'' or ''Yeniche'']] (in German and French spelling, respectively).
An early description of this group was published by Johann Ulrich Schöll in 1793.

== Travelling Showpeople/Show Travellers ==

Travelling Showpeople/Show Travellers (known in France as Forains Industriel), [[Circus]] and Bargees are Occupational Travellers. These groups formed around particular crafts and professions that required frequent mobility and usually follow a set pattern of nomadism year after year. Membership of these groups have, over the years, been drawn from other communities (including, in the case of [[travelling funfair]]s and circuses, Romani people).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/fairground/guilds.html National Fairground Archive].&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, Occupational Travellers are not defined as an ethnic group, even though they display certain common features; they tend to be insular favouring intermarriage resulting in long lineages and a strong sense of cultural homogeneity (The Showman's Guild of Great Britain and Ireland requires that applicants for membership have a parent from the Show Traveller community).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/fairground/guilds.html National Fairground Archive].&lt;/ref&gt;

Further examples include the use of Parlyaree/[[Polari]] among Fairground Travellers in the UK and the development of unique jargons, customs and traditions &lt;ref&gt;Dallas, Duncan, (1971) ''The Travelling People'', {{ISBN|9780333002971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguistically, many Occupational Travellers in the fairground and circus worlds have cultural affinities with Romani groups, such as significant traces of the Romani language and [[matriarchial]] forms of social organisation.

{{About|titles and honorifics in Japan|more on the implementation of honorifics in the Japanese language|Honorific speech in Japanese}}
{{More footnotes|date=December 2014}}
The [[Japanese language]] makes use of [[honorific]] [[suffix]]es when referring to others in a conversation. These suffixes are attached to the end of names, and are often gender-neutral. Honorific suffixes also indicate the level of the speaker and referred individual's relationship and are often used alongside other components of Japanese honorific speech, called {{nihongo||敬語|[[keigo]]}}.

== Usage ==
Although honorifics are not part of the basic [[grammar]] of the Japanese language, they are a fundamental part of the [[sociolinguistics]] of Japanese, and proper use is essential to proficient and appropriate speech. Referring to oneself using an honorific, or dropping an honorific when it is required, is a serious faux pas, in either case coming across as clumsy or arrogant.{{fact|date=September 2017}}

They can be applied to either the first or last name depending on which is given. In situations where both the first and last names are spoken, the suffix is attached to whichever comes last in the word order.

An honorific is generally used when referring to the person one is talking to (one's ''[[interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutor]]''), or when referring to an unrelated third party in speech. It is dropped, however, by some superiors, when referring to one's [[Uchi-soto|in-group]], or in formal writing, and is never used to refer to oneself, except for dramatic effect, or some exceptional cases.

Dropping the honorific suffix when referring to one's interlocutor, which is known as to {{nihongo||呼び捨て|yobisute}}, implies a high degree of intimacy and is generally reserved for one's spouse, younger family members, social inferiors (as in a teacher addressing students in traditional arts), and very close friends. Within [[team sport|sports teams]] or among [[school|classmates]], where the interlocutors approximately have the same age or seniority, it can be acceptable to use family names without honorifics. Some people of the younger generation, roughly born since 1970, prefer to be referred to without an honorific. However, dropping honorifics is a sign of informality even with casual acquaintances.

When referring to a third person, honorifics are used except when referring to one's family members while talking to a non-family member, or when referring to a member of one's company while talking to a customer or someone from another company—this is the [[uchi-soto|uchi–soto]] ([[in-group]]/out group) distinction. Honorifics are not used to refer to oneself, except when trying to be arrogant (''[[#Sama|ore-sama]]''), to be cute (''[[#Chan|-chan]]''), or sometimes when talking to young children to teach them how to address the speaker.

Use of honorifics is correlated with other forms of [[honorific speech in Japanese]], such as use of the polite form (''-masu, desu'') versus the plain form—using the plain form with a polite honorific (''-san, -sama'') can be jarring, for instance.

While these honorifics are solely used on proper nouns, these suffixes can turn common nouns into proper nouns when attached to the end of them. This can be seen on words such as {{nihongo||猫ちゃん|neko-chan|}} which turns the common noun {{nihongo3|cat||neko}} into a proper noun which would refer solely to that particular cat, while adding the honorific ''-chan'' can also mean cute

==Translation==
When [[translate|translating]] honorific suffixes into English, separate pronouns or adjectives must be used in order to convey 
characteristics to the person they are referencing as well. While some honorifics such as ''-san'' are very frequently used due to their gender neutrality and very simple definition of polite unfamiliarity, other honorifics such as ''-chan'' or ''-kun'' are more specific as to the context in which they must be used as well as the implications they give off when attached to a person's name. These implications can only be translated into English using either adjectives or adjective word phrases.

==Common honorifics==

===''San''===

[[File:遠藤さん.JPG|thumb|{{nihongo3|Happy birthday, Mr. Endō||Endō-san tanjōbi omedetō}}]]
{{nihongo||さん|San}} (sometimes pronounced {{nihongo||はん|han}} in [[Kansai dialect]]) is the most commonplace honorific and is a title of respect typically used between equals of any age. Although the closest analog in English are the honorifics "Mr.", "Miss", "Ms.", or "Mrs.", ''-san'' is almost universally added to a person's name; ''-san'' can be used in formal and informal contexts and for both genders. Because it is the most common honorific, it is also the most often used to convert common nouns into proper ones, as seen below.

''San'' may be used in combination with workplace nouns, so a bookseller might be addressed or referred to as {{nihongo|||hon'ya-san|"bookstore" + ''san''}} and a butcher as {{nihongo|||nikuya-san|"butcher's shop" + ''san''}}.

''San'' is sometimes used with company names. For example, the offices or shop of a company called Kojima Denki might be referred to as "Kojima Denki''-san''" by another nearby company. This may be seen on small maps often used in phone books and business cards in Japan, where the names of surrounding companies are written using ''-san''.

''San'' can be attached to the names of animals or even inanimate objects. For example, a pet rabbit might be called {{nihongo|||usagi-san}}, and fish used for cooking can be referred to as {{nihongo|||sakana-san}}, but both would be considered childish (akin to "Mr. Fish" or "Mr. Fishy" in English) and would be avoided in formal speech. Married people often refer to their spouse with ''-san''.

Due to ''-san'' being gender neutral and commonly used, it can be used to refer to people who are not close or whom one does not know. However, it may not be appropriate when using it on someone who is close or when it is clear that other honorifics should be used.

Online, Japanese gamers often append a numeral 3 to another player's name to denote ''-san''{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} (e.g., ''Taro3'' conveys ''Taro-san''), since the number three is [[Homophone|also pronounced]] ''san''.

===''Sama''===
[[File:現金、有価証券等貴重品 (4725731927).jpg|thumb|Okyaku-sama]]
{{nihongo||様【さま】|Sama}} is a more respectful version for people of a higher rank than oneself or divine, toward one's guests or customers (such as a sports venue announcer addressing members of the audience), and sometimes toward people one greatly admires. It is seemingly said to be the origin word for ''-san'' but there is no major evidence otherwise. Deities such as native [[Shinto]] ''[[kami]]'' and the [[Christianity in Japan|Christian God]] are referred to as {{nihongo|||[[kami]]-sama}}, meaning "Revered spirit''-sama''". When used to refer to oneself, ''-sama'' expresses extreme arrogance (or self-effacing irony), as in praising one's self to be of a higher rank, as with {{nihongo||俺様|ore-sama|"my esteemed self"}}.

''Sama'' customarily follows the addressee's name on postal packages and letters and in business email.

''Sama'' also appears in such [[set phrase]]s as {{nihongo|||omachidō sama|"thank you for waiting"}}, {{nihongo|||gochisō sama|"thank you for the meal"}}, or {{nihongo|||otsukare sama|"thank you for a good job"}}.

With the exception of the [[Emperor of Japan]], ''-sama'' can be used to informally address the [[Empress of Japan|Empress]] and other members of the [[Imperial House of Japan|Imperial Family]]. The Emperor is, however, always addressed as {{nihongo3|"Your Majesty"||Heika}}. (See "[[#Royal and official titles|Royal and official titles]]" below).

===''Kun''===
[[Chan]]
{{nihongo||君【くん】|Kun}} is generally used by people of senior status addressing or referring to those of junior status, by anyone addressing or it can be used when referring to men in general, male children or male teenagers, or among male friends. It can be used by males or females when addressing a male to whom they are emotionally attached, or who they have known for a long time. Although it may seem rude in workplaces, the suffix is also used by juniors when referring to seniors in both academic situations and workplaces, more typically when the two people are associated. {{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=January 2015}}

Although ''-kun'' is generally used for boys, it is not a hard rule. For example, ''-kun'' can be used to name a close personal friend or family member of any gender. In business settings, young female employees are addressed as ''-kun'' by older males of senior status. It can be used by male teachers addressing their female students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mogi |first1=Norie |title=Japanese Ways of Addressing People |url=https://pressto.amu.edu.pl/index.php/il/article/view/9013 |website=Investigationes Linguisticae |publisher=Investigationes Linguisticae |accessdate=21 October 2018 |location=Poland |pages=14 |doi=10.14746/il.2002.8.3 |date=10 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kun'' can mean different things depending on the gender. ''Kun'' for females is a more respectful honorific than ''-chan'', which implies childlike cuteness. ''Kun'' is not only used to address females formally; it can also be used for a very close friend or family member. Calling a female ''-kun'' is not insulting, and can also mean that the person is respected, although that is not the normal implication. Rarely, sisters with the same name, such as "Miku", may be differentiated by calling one "Miku''-chan''" and the other "Miku''-san''" or "''-sama''", and on some occasions "''-kun''". ''Chan'' and ''-kun'' occasionally mean similar things. General use of ''-kun'' for females implies respectful endearment, and that the person being referred to is sweet and kind.

In the [[National Diet]] (Legislature), the Speaker of the House uses ''-kun'' when addressing Diet members and ministers. An exception was when [[Takako Doi]] was the Speaker of the lower house, where she used the title ''[[#San|-san]]''.

===''Chan''===
[[File:Many metal badges printed Japanese popular first names or nicknames (2654745043).jpg|thumb|Chan]]
[[File:2016 0504 Kiyotaka Taguti Sign.jpg|thumb|Tan]]
{{nihongo||ちゃん|Chan}} is a [[diminutive]] suffix; it expresses that the speaker finds a person endearing. It is seemingly said to have come from a "cute" pronouncing of ''-san'' (in Japanese, replacing ''s'' sounds with ''ch'' sounds is seen as cute), although there is no evidence otherwise as this suffix has been used since the early days of ancient Japan. In general, ''-chan'' is used for babies, young children, close friends, grandparents and sometimes female adolescents. It may also be used towards cute animals, lovers, close friends, or a youthful woman. Using ''-chan'' with a superior's name is considered to be condescending and rude.

Although traditionally, honorifics are not applied to oneself, some people adopt the childlike affectation of referring to themselves in the third person using ''-chan'' (childlike because it suggests that one has not learned to distinguish between names used for oneself and names used by others). For example, a young woman named ''Kanako'' might call herself ''Kanako-chan'' rather than using a first person pronoun. "Chan" is only used between people who have known each other for a long time or who are of the same gender. Otherwise, using this for someone, especially adults, only known for a short period of time, can be seen as offensive.

====''Tan''====
{{nihongo||たん|Tan}} is an even more [[Kawaii|cute]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ashcraft|first1=Brian|title=Legendary Sega Consoles Turned into Colorful Anime Ladies|url=http://kotaku.com/5980040/legendary-sega-consoles-turned-into-colorful-anime-ladies|accessdate=30 January 2017|work=[[Kotaku]]|date=30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or affectionate variant of ''-chan''. It evokes a small child's mispronunciation of that form of address, or [[baby talk]] – similar to how, for example, a speaker of English might use "widdle" instead of "little" when speaking to a baby. [[Moe anthropomorphism]]s are often labeled as ''-tan'', e.g., the commercial mascot [[Habanero-tan]], the manga figure [[Afghanis-tan]] or the [[OS-tan]]s representing operating systems.

====''Bō''====
{{nihongo||坊【ぼう】|Bō}} is another [[hypocoristic|diminutive]] that expresses endearment. Like ''-chan'', it is used for babies or young children, but is exclusively used for boys instead of girls.

===''Senpai'' and ''kōhai''===
{{Main|Senpai and kōhai}}
{{nihongo||先輩【せんぱい】|Senpai}} is used to address or refer to one's elder colleagues in a school, dojo, or sports club. So at school, the students in higher grades than oneself are ''senpai''. Teachers are not ''senpai'', but rather they are ''sensei''. Neither are students of the same or lower grade: they are referred to as ''kōhai''. In a business environment, those with more experience are ''senpai''.

===''Sensei'' and ''hakase''===
{{nihongo||先生【せんせい】|[[Sensei]]|literally meaning "former-born"}} is used to refer to or address teachers, doctors, politicians, lawyers, and other authority figures. It is used to show respect to someone who has achieved a certain level of mastery in an art form or some other skill, such as accomplished novelists, musicians, artists and [[martial artists]]. In [[Budō|Japanese martial arts]], ''sensei'' typically refers to someone who is the head of a [[dojo]]. As with ''senpai'', ''sensei'' can be used not only as a suffix, but also as a stand-alone title. The term is not generally used when addressing a person with very high academic expertise; the one used instead is {{nihongo||博士【はかせ】|hakase|lit. "Doctor" or "[[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]]"}}.

''Sensei'' can be used fawningly, and it can also be employed sarcastically to ridicule such fawning. The Japanese media invoke it (rendered in [[katakana]], akin to [[scare quotes]] or [[Italic type|italics]] in English) to highlight the [[megalomania]] of those who allow themselves to be sycophantically addressed with the term.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===''Shi''===
[[File:アップル・サムスン裁判 講演 (8558393225).jpg|thumb|氏]]
{{nihongo||氏【し】|Shi}} is used in formal writing, and sometimes in very formal speech, for referring to a person who is unfamiliar to the speaker, typically a person known through publications whom the speaker has never actually met. For example, the ''-shi'' title is common in the speech of newsreaders. It is preferred in legal documents, academic journals, and certain other formal written styles. Once a person's name has been used with ''-shi'', the person can be referred to with ''-shi'' alone, without the name, as long as there is only one person being referred to.

==Other titles==

===Occupation-related titles===
{{main|Corporate title#Japan and South Korea}}
It is common to use a job title after someone's name, instead of using a general honorific. For example, an {{nihongo|athlete|選手|senshu}} named Ichiro might be referred to as "''Ichiro-senshu''" rather than "''Ichiro-san''", and a {{nihongo|master carpenter|棟梁|tōryō}} named Suzuki might be referred to as "''Suzuki-tōryō''" rather than "''Suzuki-san''".

In a business setting, it is common to refer to people using their rank, especially for positions of authority, such as {{nihongo|department chief|部長|buchō}} or {{nihongo|company president|社長|shachō}}. Within one's own company or when speaking of another company, title + ''san'' is used, so a president is ''Shachō-san''. When speaking of one's own company to a customer or another company, the title is used by itself or attached to a name, so a department chief named Suzuki is referred to as ''Buchō'' or Suzuki-''buchō''.

However, when referring to oneself, the title is used indirectly, as using it directly is perceived as arrogant. Thus, a department chief named Suzuki will introduce themselves as 部長の鈴木 ''Buchō''-''no''-Suzuki, rather than ×鈴木部長 *Suzuki-''buchō.''

===For criminals and the accused===
Convicted and suspected criminals were once referred to without any title, but now an effort is made to distinguish between {{nihongo|suspects|容疑者|yōgisha}}, {{nihongo|defendants|被告|hikoku}}, and {{nihongo|convicts|受刑者|jukeisha}}, so as not to presume guilt before anything has been proven.  These titles can be used by themselves or attached to names.

However, although "suspect" and "defendant" began as neutral descriptions, they have become derogatory over time. When actor and musician [[Goro Inagaki|Gorō Inagaki]] was arrested for a traffic accident in 2001, some media referred him with the newly made title {{nihongo||メンバー|menbā}}, originating from the English word "member", to avoid use of {{nihongo3|suspect|容疑者|yōgisha}}.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} But in addition to being criticized as an unnatural term, this title also became derogatory almost instantly—an example of [[euphemism treadmill]].

===For companies===
There are several different words for "our company" and "your company". "Our company" can be expressed with the humble {{nihongo||弊社|heisha|"clumsy/poor company"}} or the neutral {{nihongo||自社|jisha|"our own company"}}, and "your company" can be expressed with the honorific {{nihongo||貴社|kisha|"noble company", used in writing}} or {{nihongo||御社|onsha|"honorable company", used in speech}}. Additionally, the neutral {{nihongo||当社|tōsha|"this company"}} can refer to either the speaker's or the listener's company.  All of these titles are used by themselves, not attached to names.

When mentioning a company's name, it is considered important to include its status depending on whether it is {{nihongo|[[Kabushiki kaisha|incorporated]]|株式会社|kabushiki-gaisha}} or {{nihongo|[[Yugen kaisha|limited]]|有限会社|yūgen-gaisha}}. These are often abbreviated as 株 and 有 respectively.

===''Dono''/''tono''===

{{nihongo||殿【との】|Tono}}, pronounced {{nihongo||どの|-dono}} when attached to a name, roughly means "lord" or "master". It does not equate noble status; rather it is a term akin to "[[milord]]" or French "''[[monseigneur]]''", and lies below ''-sama'' in level of respect. This title is not commonly used in daily conversation, but it is still used in some types of written business correspondence, as well as on certificates and awards, and in written correspondence in [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremonies]]. It is also used to indicate that the person referred to has the same (high) rank as the referrer, yet commands respect from the speaker.

===''No kimi''===
{{nihongo||の君|No kimi}} is another suffix coming from [[Japanese history]]. It was used to denominate Lords and Ladies in the Court, especially during the [[Heian period]]. The most famous example is the Prince [[Hikaru Genji]], protagonist of ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' who was called {{nihongo||光の君|Hikaru no kimi}}. Nowadays, this suffix can be used as a metaphor for someone who behaves like a prince or princess from ancient times, but its use is very rare. Its main usage remains in historical dramas.

This suffix also appears when addressing lovers in letters from a man to a woman, as in {{nihongo|||Murasaki no kimi|"My beloved Ms. Murasaki}}.

===''Ue''===
{{nihongo||上|Ue}} literally means "above", and denotes a high level of respect. While its use is no longer common, it is still seen in constructions like {{nihongo||父上|chichi-ue}}, {{nihongo||母上|haha-ue}} and {{nihongo||姉上|ane-ue}}, reverent terms for "father", "mother" and "older sister" respectively. Receipts that do not require specification of the payer's name are often filled in with ''ue-sama''.

===Royal and official titles===
*'''{{nihongo||陛下|Heika}}''' is used for sovereign royalty, similar to "[[Majesty]]" in English. For example, {{nihongo||天皇陛下|Tennō Heika}} means "His Majesty the Emperor", which is used to address the [[Emperor of Japan]], and {{nihongo||皇后陛下|Kōgō Heika}} means "Her Majesty the Empress", used to address the [[Empress of Japan|Empress]]. {{nihongo||国王陛下|Kokuō Heika}} means "His Majesty the King", and {{nihongo||女王陛下|Joō Heika}} means "Her Majesty the Queen". ''Heika'' by itself can be used as a direct term of address, equivalent to "Your Majesty".
*'''{{nihongo||殿下|Denka}}''' is used for non-sovereign royalty, similar to "[[Highness]]". For example, {{nihongo||佳子内親王殿下|Kako Naishinnō Denka|"Her Imperial Highness, [[Princess Kako of Akishino]]"}}, and {{nihongo||スウェーデン王国ヴィクトリア王太子殿下|Suwēden Ōkoku, Vikutoria Ōtaishi Denka|"Her Royal Highness, Crown [[Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden|Princess Victoria of the Kingdom of Sweden]]"}}. ''Denka'' can be used by itself, equivalent to "Your Highness."
*'''{{nihongo||妃殿下|Hidenka}}''' is used for addressing the consort of a prince, and is used the same way as the other royal titles.
*'''{{nihongo||閣下|Kakka}}''' means "[[Excellency]]", and is used for [[heads of state]] (except those addressed by ''Heika'' or ''Denka''), [[heads of government]] including the [[Prime Minister of Japan]], cabinet ministers, ambassadors and other high-rank officials such as the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]], or for generals in an army. It can be used by itself or attached to a specific title like other royal titles.
*'''{{nihongo||大統領|Daitōryō}}''' means "President", and is used for any national president, such as the President of the United States. It is most commonly attached to a name. For example, {{nihongo||トランプ大統領|Trump-Daitōryō|"[[President of the United States|President]] [[Donald Trump|Trump]]"}}.

===Martial arts titles===
{{see also|Japanese martial arts}}
Martial artists often address their teachers as ''[[sensei]]''. Junior and senior students are organized via a ''[[Senpai and kōhai|senpai/kōhai]]'' system.
Also in some systems of karate, ''O-Sensei'' is the title of the (deceased) head of the style. This is how the founder of [[Aikido]], [[Morihei Ueshiba]] is often referred to by practitioners of that art. The ''O-'' prefix itself, translating roughly as "great[er]" or "major," is also an honorific.

Various titles are also employed to refer to senior instructors. Which titles are used depends on the particular licensing organization.

====''Shōgō''====
{{nihongo||称号|Shōgō|"title", "name", "degree"}} are martial arts titles developed by the [[Dai Nippon Butoku Kai]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fighttimes.com/magazine/magazine.asp?article=293|title=Dai Nippon Butokukai|author=Patrick McCarthy|accessdate=2007-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Kokusai Budoin and the International Martial Arts Federation Europe. Many organizations in Japan award such titles upon a sincere study and dedication of Japanese martial arts. The below mentioned titles are awarded after observing a person's martial arts skills, his/her ability of teaching and understanding of martial arts and the most importantly as a role model and the perfection of one's character.
*{{nihongo||錬士【れんし】|Renshi}}: Polished Instructor. (Skilled person or expert teacher) Awarded to 4th Dan and above.
*{{nihongo||教士【きょうし】|Kyōshi}} refers to an advanced teacher. (Senior Teacher/Expert). Awarded to 6th Dan and above.
*{{nihongo||範士【はんし】|Hanshi}} refers to a senior expert considered a "teacher of teachers". This title is used by many different arts for the top few instructors of that style, and is sometimes translated "Grand Master". Awarded to 8th Dan and above.
*{{nihongo||名人|[[Meijin]]}}: awarded by a special board of examiners.

====Other martial arts titles====
*{{nihongo||親方【おやかた】|[[Glossary of sumo terms#oyakata|Oyakata]]}}, master, especially a [[sumo]] coach. The literal sense is of someone ''[[in loco parentis]]''. Also used by the [[Yakuza]]. In ancient times, it was also used by samurai to address the [[Daimyō]] they serve, as he was ''Oyakata-sama'', the clan's don. 
*{{nihongo||師範【しはん】|[[Shihan]]}}, merely means chief instructor; unlike the titles above it is not related to grade.
*{{nihongo||指導員【しどういん】|Shidōin}}, intermediate instructor, also unrelated to grade.
*{{nihongo||師匠【ししょう】|Shishō}} is another title used for martial arts instructors.
*{{nihongo||関【ぜき】|Zeki|literally "barrier"}}, used for sumo wrestlers in the top two divisions (sekitori).

Levels of black belts sometimes used as martial arts titles

* {{nihongo|||[[Shodan (rank)|Shodan]]}} – 1st [[Dan (rank)|dan]]
* {{nihongo|||Nidan}} – 2nd dan
* {{nihongo|||Sandan}} – 3rd dan
* {{nihongo|||Yodan}} – 4th dan
* {{nihongo|||Godan}} – 5th dan
* {{nihongo|||Rokudan}} – 6th dan
* {{nihongo|||Shichidan}} – 7th dan
* {{nihongo|||Hachidan}} – 8th dan
* {{nihongo|||Kudan}} – 9th dan
* {{nihongo|||Jūdan}} – 10th dan

===Other titles===
*{{Nihongo||神父【しんぷ】|Shinpu}}, Orthodox or Catholic priest (lit. Godfather). A {{nihongo|Catholic priest|司祭【しさい】|shisai|lit. minister of worship}} receives this title.
*{{Nihongo||牧師【ぼくし】|Bokushi}}, Protestant priest. This title is given to a {{nihongo|Protestant priest|司祭【しさい】|shisai}}.

==Euphonic suffixes and wordplay==
In informal speech, some Japanese people may use contrived suffixes in place of normal honorifics. This is essentially a form of wordplay, with suffixes being chosen for their sound, or for friendly or scornful connotations. Although the range of such suffixes that might be coined is limitless, some have gained such widespread usage that the boundary between established honorifics and wordplay has become a little blurred. Examples of such suffixes include variations on ''-chan'' (see below), ''-bee'' (scornful), and ''-rin'' (friendly).&lt;ref&gt;''Rin'' is thought to have been inspired by European girl's names like ''Katherine'' and ''Marilyn''; [http://kotobakai.seesaa.net/article/8173861.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
Note that unlike a proper honorific, use of such suffixes is governed largely by how they sound in conjunction with a particular name, and on the effect the speaker is trying to achieve.

===Baby talk variations===
Some honorifics have [[baby talk]] versions—mispronunciations stereotypically associated with small children and cuteness, and more frequently used in popular entertainment than in everyday speech. The baby talk version of ''-sama'' is {{nihongo||ちゃま|-chama}}.

There are even baby talk versions of baby talk versions. ''Chan'' can be changed to {{nihongo||たん|-tan}}, and less often, {{nihongo||ちゃま|-chama}} to {{nihongo||たま|-tama}}.

==Familial honorifics==
Words for family members have two different forms in Japanese. When referring to one's own family members while speaking to a non-family-member, neutral, descriptive nouns are used, such as {{nihongo||母|haha}} for "mother" and {{nihongo||兄|ani}} for "older brother". When addressing one's own family members or addressing or referring to someone else's family members, honorific forms are used. Using the suffix ''[[#San|-san]]'', as is most common, "mother" becomes {{nihongo||お母さん|okāsan}} and "older brother" becomes {{nihongo||お兄さん|oniisan}}. The honorifics ''[[#Chan|-chan]]'' and ''[[#Sama|-sama]]'' may also be used instead of ''-san'', to express a higher level of closeness or reverence, respectively.

The general rule is that a younger family member (e.g., a young brother) addresses an older family member (e.g., a big brother) using an honorific form, while the older family member calls the younger one only by name.

The honorific forms are:
*{{nihongo||お父さん|Otōsan}}: father. The descriptive noun is {{nihongo||父|chichi}}.
**{{nihongo||叔父さん／小父さん／伯父さん|Ojisan}}: uncle, or also "middle-aged gentleman".
**{{nihongo||お祖父さん／御爺さん／お爺さん／御祖父さん|Ojiisan}}: grandfather, or also "male senior-citizen".
*{{nihongo||お母さん|Okāsan}}: mother. The descriptive noun is {{nihongo||母|haha}}.
**{{nihongo||伯母さん／小母さん／叔母さん|Obasan}}: aunt, or also "middle-aged lady".
**{{nihongo||お祖母さん／御祖母さん／御婆さん／お婆さん|Obāsan}}: grandmother, or also "female senior-citizen".
*{{nihongo||お兄さん|Oniisan}}: big brother, or also "a young gentleman". The descriptive noun is {{nihongo||兄|ani}}.
*{{nihongo||お姉さん|Onēsan}}: big sister, or also "a young lady". The descriptive noun is {{nihongo||姉|ane}}.

The initial {{nihongo||お|o-}} in these nouns is itself an honorific [[prefix]]. In more casual situations the speaker may omit this prefix but will keep the suffix.
*{{nihongo||兄ちゃん|Niichan}} or {{nihongo||兄さん|Niisan}}: when a young sibling addresses his or her own "big brother".
*{{nihongo||姉ちゃん|Nēchan}} or {{nihongo||姉さん|Nēsan}}: when a young sibling addresses his or her own "big sister".
*{{nihongo||母さん|Kāsan}}: when a man addresses his own "wife" (the "mother" of their children).
*{{nihongo||父さん|Tōsan}}: when a woman addresses her own "husband" (the "father" of their children)
*{{nihongo||祖母ちゃん|Bāchan}}: when grandchildren address their "grandma".
*{{nihongo||祖父ちゃん|Jiichan}}: when grandchildren address their "grandpa".

[[File:Koper (30) (3957507831).jpg|thumbnail|Koper Regional Museum]]
The '''Koper Regional Museum''' ({{lang-sl|Pokrajinski muzej Koper}}; {{lang-it|Museo regionale di Capodistria}}) has been housed since 1954 in the spacious early 17th century Belgramoni Tacco Palace, and is responsible for the movable cultural heritage in [[Primorska]] region of [[Slovenia]]. The museum originated in 1911 as the '''Municipal Museum of History and Art''' (''Museo Civico di Storia e d'Arte''). At its centenary in 2011, the museum opened a new permanent exhibition ''Between the Serenissima, Napoleon and the Habsburgs'' and enriched its collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.culture.si/en/Koper_Regional_Museum | title = Koper Regional Museum | date = 3 July 2011 | publisher = Culture.si}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first initiatives to establish a museum in Koper-Capodistria took place as early as the late 18th century, but the main push for its foundation was provided by the first exhibition of the Istrian Region in Koper (Prima Esposizione Provinciale Istriana) in 1910.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}} One year later the then [[Municipality of Koper-Capodistria]] established the Municipal Museum of History and Art (Museo Civico di Storia e d'Arte), and after the First World War the spacious early 17th century Belgramoni Tacco Palace building was set aside for use as a museum.

During the [[Second World War]], the permanent collection was seriously impaired when many precious works of art were evacuated to [[Friuli]] (Villa Manin in [[Passariano]]). When 'Zone B' was incorporated into Slovenia in 1954, the museum was renamed the District Museum, and in 1967 its name was changed to Koper Regional Museum (Museo Regionale di Capodistria). From 1981–1985, the museum's central building was completely renovated and this made it possible to expand the museum's activities and to rearrange its collections.

== Mission ==
The museum has a wide scope of coverage, mainly concerning Primorska region: archaeology, history, art and cultural history, ethnology and cultural heritage of coastal and karst areas. Important attention is being paid to participation in cultural, scientific and educational establishments and associations, with particular emphasis on cooperation with Slovenian institutions abroad and Italian and Croatian institutions in Istria and Dalmatia.

Today, the parent museum building presents an archaeological collection and collections covering the history of culture, art and history of Istria from its very beginning to the end of the 19th century. The conservation restoration workshop preserves the museum material and organizes the technical days and workshops at the temporary exhibitions in the context of educational activities.

== Venues ==
The museum manages three satellites; in 1983 the Ethnological Collection of Koper Regional Museum was established as an independent branch, and in 1990 the museum also assumed responsibility for the Tartini Memorial Room, housed in the Piran birthplace of composer and violinist [[Giuseppe Tartini]]. The third satellite collection was opened in [[Prem Castle]] in 2008, presenting castles and building sites in the Reka river basin.

== Collections ==
[[File:Benedetto Carpaccio -Vergine tra santi Bartolomeo e Tommaso - Museo Capodistria.jpg|thumbnail|''Virgin between Saints Bartholomew and Thomas'' by [[Benedetto Carpaccio]]]]
The recent permanent exhibition ''Between the Serenissima, Napoleon and the Habsburgs'' covers the period from 16h to 19th century and presents some of the most prominent residents such as the bishops [[Paolo Naldini (bishop)|Paolo Naldini]] and [[Pier Paolo Vergerio]] jr. (1498–1565), [[Santorio Santorio]] (1561–1636), a doctor and researcher who invented the thermometer, and the writer and historian [[Giovanni Rinaldo]] (1720–1795). The display includes the weapon collection, presented for the first time. 

Both the lapidary collection and the open air collection in the palace garden present the oldest material culture of the coastal and karst areas. The culture and art history collection consists of sculptures, paintings and arts and crafts products, arranged in chronological order and by theme, from early medieval sculptures with guilloche ornamentation (9th–11th centuries) to a fresco copy of ''The Dance of Death'' from Hrastovlje and inscriptions in the Glagolitic alphabet. 

Pinakoteka presents paintings, sculptures and products of the arts and crafts, complemented by 17th- and 18th-century furnishings from the Venetian cultural area, while historical material from the 18th and 19th centuries presents some eminent figures from the fields of medicine, pharmacy, the Enlightenment and political life in the Koper area. 

In the pavilion along the Museum's lapidary, a collection of the recent history of the Southern Primorska region is presented, the fight for survival in [[Brkini]], Slovenska Bistrica and Istra, portrayed also on ''Rapallo'' painting by [[Tone Kralj]], while at Gramsci Square an ethnological collection is on permanent display.

== Exhibitions ==
The museum presents several own and travelling exhibitions through the year. In 1995–1998 an exhibition of recent history was assembled in the pavilion adjacent to the museum's lapidary collection, presenting the national and political struggle of the Istrian Slovenes and people from Primorje (the coast land) at the turn of the 20th century. This exhibition covers the periods from the national awakening of the Istrian Slovenes before the First World War up to the incorporation of Zone B of the Free Territory of Trieste and the diplomatic struggle for the incorporation of the area into the Slovene homeland (London Memorandum 1954).

In February 2010 a joint exhibition of Koper Museum and several other Slovenian museums, together with a Town Museum Trieste ''With a Fibula into Fable'' is being planned. The exhibition presents brooches which were found in Western Slovenian area, adjacent to the Friuli region. It follows the development of fibulae in that area from prehistoric to [[Roman times]] and the early [[Middle Ages]].

{{multiple issues|{{Tone|date=July 2008}}
{{primary sources|date=August 2008}}}}

The terms '''legal case management''' ('''LCM''') or '''matter management''' refer to a subset of [[law]] practice management and cover a range of approaches and technologies used by law firms and courts to leverage [[knowledge]] and methodologies for managing the life cycle of a case or matter more effectively.&lt;ref&gt;In the U.S., the term 'case' is customarily applied to a matter in which there are opposing parties or which involves a conflict between parties ''Capturing More Time ... And Keeping Your Clients Happy While Doing It'', Law Practice Today, March 2007.[http://www.abanet.org/lpm/lpt/articles/bot03071.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the terms refer to the sophisticated information management and workflow practices that are tailored to meet the legal field's specific needs and requirements.

As attorneys and law firms compete for clients they are routinely challenged to deliver services at lower costs with greater efficiency, thus firms develop practice-specific processes and utilize contemporary technologies to assist in meeting such challenges. Law practice management processes and technologies include case and matter management, time and billing, litigation support, research, communication and collaboration, [[data mining]] and modeling, and [[data security]], storage, and archive accessibility.

==Case management software==
Legal case or matter management software has two primary functions: it helps to better use, manage, consolidate, share, and protect information, and it tracks and shapes the business process. Because the most useful forms of such software can integrate data from multiple systems, departments, users, and business entities, its use can increase a firm's business advantage.

Case or matter management systems having the capacity to push and pull data over the Internet, whether within the software itself or within an integrated software framework or environment became an industry standard with the advent of the [[LexisNexis|Lexis]] and [[Westlaw]] legal research platforms.

Case management software is marketed to specific segments of the legal marketplace, with some products designed for small firms and others for large multinational firms, and a few claim to be scalable to all. Cost-containment and competition concerns facing small-to-mid-size firms that cannot afford a full-time IT staff often drive custom solutions incorporating muliple integrated products.

==In-house legal departments==
In-house legal teams (in the public and private sectors) have their own needs: generally these require less emphasis on billing and accounts (since clients tend to be internal), and even more on traceability, real-time integration and configurability. The need to improve productivity of the team and reduce costs to taxpayers, or the business, is often a key driver.  Some in-house teams have reduced their external legal bills by using case management software to increase their capacity and bring case work in-house.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Teh, Telegraph Media Group on [http://www.iken.biz www.iken.biz] January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case management in the U.S. federal courts==
As electronic court systems continue to increase their online presence, many now require case filings to be accomplished electronically.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., News Release, ''Electronic Case Filing in Federal Courts Reaches Milestone'', November 21, 2005.{{cite web |url=http://www.uscourts.gov/Press_Releases/cmecfat10.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515005302/http://www.uscourts.gov/Press_Releases/cmecfat10.html |archivedate=2009-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Courts, ''About Case Management/Electronic Case Files (CM/ECF)'', July 2009.{{cite web |url=http://www.uscourts.gov/cmecf/cmecf_about.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090602021153/http://www.uscourts.gov/cmecf/cmecf_about.html |archivedate=2009-06-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many legal software vendors' products include the ability to take advantage of such electronic filing by pulling data from the case management product and pushing it into court filing systems.

==e-Discovery systems==
In litigation, the discovery process often results in enormous amounts of information that must be managed, and with the revision of the U.S. [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] in 2006 to include electronic means of discovery&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/#chapter_v FRCP]&lt;/ref&gt; came a new subset of case management systems that incorporated those changes, often dubbed 'electronic evidence' or 'e-discovery' management systems.&lt;ref&gt;See Kaplan, ''Industry Research Report, A Conversation with Corporate Counsel: e-Discovery Trends and Perspectives'', Fios, Inc. and Ari Kaplan Advisors, 2008.[http://www.abanet.org/lpm/lpt/docs/LPT608AriKaplan-ResearchStudy.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abanet.org/lpm/lpt/articles/tch04081.shtml Blake, ''Are You Litigation-Ready?'', Law Practice Today, April 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the new rules took effect, e-Discovery firms as outside service vendors have flourished.

== Case management and the regulation of mediation in Australia ==
The term '''case management''' is also used to refer to systems in which court or tribunal officials assume closer administrative control over the litigation process than is traditionally associated with [[common law]] [[litigation]].&lt;ref name="Boulle"&gt;Boulle, L. (2005). Mediation: Principles Process Practice. 2nd Edition. Queensland, Australia. LexisNexis Butterworths.&lt;/ref&gt; The Assisted Dispute Resolution program was introduced into the [[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]] in 1990 after a number of cases failed to reach resolutions having several directional hearings. In those cases the parties were not able to isolate the issues requiring determination. With the new program, judges can refer the parties to a court registrar for mediation. This is stated in the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 Section 53A(1):&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s53a.html|title=Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) s 53A|last=|first=|date=|website=www.austlii.edu.au|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504050856/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s53a.html|archive-date=2007-05-04|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|(1)  Subject to the Rules of Court, the Court may by order refer the proceedings in the Court, or any part of them or any matter arising out of them, to a mediator or an arbitrator for mediation or arbitration, as the case may be, in accordance with the Rules of Court. 

(1A)  Referrals under subsection (1) to a mediator may be made with or without the consent of the parties to the proceedings. However, referrals to an arbitrator may be made only with the consent of the parties.}} 

Case management in the State of New South Wales includes governing civil court proceedings by court management rules, which are the ''Civil Procedure Act 2005'' (NSW)[http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/act/2005/28/full] and ''Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005'' (NSW)[http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/regulation/2005/418/full]. The overriding purpose of case management in the ''Civil Procedure Act 2005'' is 'to facilitate the just, quick and cheap resolution' to the matter at dispute in the civil court proceedings (s56(1), ''Civil Procedure Act 2005'' (NSW) [http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/act/2005/28/part6/div1/sec56]).

In Australia, mediation as an [[alternative dispute resolution]] (ADR) method is designed to avoid resorting to formal court-based adjudication and is now also being applied to criminal matters. Traditional theories of criminal justice view the matter as one between the offender and the state.&lt;ref&gt;Sarre, R. and Earle, K. (2004). Restorative Justice in Key Issues in Criminal Justice Sarre R, and Tomaino, J. (eds) Key Issues in Criminal Justice, Adelaide: Australian Humanities Press&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not necessary to have the parties consent to the mediation process and a judge can direct the mediation. In this sense, case management is designed to identify and define issues in dispute and to reduce delays, costs and unnecessary pre-trial activities. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]hat was born of resistance and opposition to the formal justice system has been extensively integrated and co-opted into the system.&lt;ref&gt;Astor, H &amp; Chinkin, C. M. (2nd Edition, 2002). Dispute Resolution in Australia. Sydney Australia.. LexisNexis Butterworths&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The following is a list of notable albums with controversial [[album art]], especially where that controversy resulted in the album being banned, [[censorship|censored]] or sold in packaging other than the original one.  They are listed by the type of controversy they were involved in.

==Nudity and sexuality==
&lt;!--IMPORTANT! If you add an album without providing a reference or providing an explanation for why or how its album cover is "controversial", THE ALBUM WILL BE REMOVED! See discussion page.--&gt;
* [[Alice Cooper (band)|Alice Cooper]] – ''[[Love It to Death]]'' (1971)
** The album features a portrait of the original Alice Cooper band, with frontman [[Alice Cooper]] posed with his thumb protruding from underneath his cape as if it were his penis. The album was later reissued with Cooper's entire right arm airbrushed out of the photograph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Gavin |last=Edwards |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/banned-in-the-u-s-a-20-wildest-censored-album-covers-20150115 |title=Banned in the U.S.A.: 20 Wildest Censored Album Covers |publisher=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=2018-05-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180520193123/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/banned-in-the-u-s-a-20-wildest-censored-album-covers-20150115 |archivedate=2018-05-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Arca (producer)|Arca]] – ''[[Xen (album)|Xen]]'' (2014)
** The album cover is a [[computer-generated image|computer-generated]] androgynous alter-ego named Xen. With her head tilted back, Xen displays her broad shoulders, breasts, and large hips on the album cover with her skin rippling "as if about to peel and fall off."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/558-new-flesh-jesse-kandas-music-videos-subvert-the-myth-of-the-feminine-pristine/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623100145/http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/558-new-flesh-jesse-kandas-music-videos-subvert-the-myth-of-the-feminine-pristine/ |archivedate=2015-06-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though no genitals appear, [[Spotify]] and [[iTunes]] [[Pixelization|pixelate]] the area, as well as the breasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://play.spotify.com/album/5FLsmazQWaDK9JGqdzHlN4|title=Xen|date=3 November 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/xen/id915861599|title=Xen by Arca|date=4 November 2014|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417200346/https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/xen/id915861599|archivedate=17 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Biffy Clyro]] – ''[[The Vertigo of Bliss]]'' (2003)
** The cover shows a woman sitting down with her hand up her dress, presumably [[Masturbation|masturbating]], with a look of pleasure on her face. The controversy of the album cover is accompanied by the erotic artwork of the singles "[[The Ideal Height]]", "[[Questions and Answers (Biffy Clyro song)|Questions and Answers]]" and "[[Eradicate the Doubt]]" (all designed by [[Milo Manara]]). Despite being considered offensive and sexist by some, ''[[ShortList]]'' magazine praised the band for their bravery and originality when they mentioned it in their list of "50 Coolest Album Covers Ever".
* [[The Black Crowes]] – ''[[Amorica]]'' (1994)
** The album cover's depiction of [[pubic hair]], taken from an issue of ''[[Hustler]]'' magazine, caused controversy.&lt;ref name="Boston Globe"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Morse |first=Steve |title=The Black Crowes: Rock rebels take home-grown spirit on tour  |publisher=''[[The Boston Globe]]'' |page=18 |date=March 23, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image was replaced with a black background cover which blacked out the hair.
* [[Blind Faith]] – ''[[Blind Faith (Blind Faith album)|Blind Faith]]'' (1969)
** The cover featured a topless [[puberty|pubescent]] girl, holding in her hands a silver space ship, which some perceived as [[phallic]]. Photographer [[Bob Seidemann]] used a girl, Mariora Goschen, who was 11 years old.&lt;ref name=bestcovers&gt;{{cite book |title=100 Best Album Covers: The Stories Behind the Sleeves |last=Thorgerson |first= Storm |author2=Powell, Aubrey  |year=1999 |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |isbn=0-7513-0706-8  |page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article2870010.ece Interview with Mariora Goschen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517065455/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article2870010.ece |date=2011-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baacorsham.co.uk/cached/MarioraGoshen.htm|title=Mariora Goschen|website=www.baacorsham.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608094747/http://www.baacorsham.co.uk/cached/MarioraGoshen.htm|archivedate=2010-06-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US record company issued it with an alternative cover which showed a photograph of the band on the front.
* [[Bon Jovi]] – ''[[Slippery When Wet]]'' (1986)
** The album originally was to feature a busty, 34DD woman in a wet yellow T-shirt with the album name on the front of the shirt. However, the artwork was rejected because record executives feared that the dominant record store chains at the time would not sell the album with a sexist cover, or [[Jon Bon Jovi]]'s complaint that the record company had put a bright pink border around the photograph that the band had submitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegauntlet.com/article/1225/12753/top-10-banned-metal-album-covers.html|title=The Gauntlet - Top 10 Banned Metal Album Covers|website=www.thegauntlet.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727082844/http://www.thegauntlet.com/article/1225/12753/top-10-banned-metal-album-covers.html|archivedate=2014-07-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/bon-jovi-most-shocking-album-covers/|title=Bon Jovi – Most Shocking Album Covers|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811215521/http://ultimateclassicrock.com/bon-jovi-most-shocking-album-covers/|archivedate=2014-08-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the cover was changed before the album's release to an image of a wet garbage bag with the words "Slippery When Wet" written on it.
* [[Bow Wow Wow]] – ''[[See Jungle! See Jungle! Go Join Your Gang Yeah, City All Over! Go Ape Crazy!]]'' (1981)
** The cover of the album features a rendition of [[Édouard Manet]]’s painting ''[[Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe]]'' featuring the band members. The band's then-14-year old lead singer [[Annabella Lwin]] is nude on the cover. The cover caused outrage in the United Kingdom that led to an investigation by [[Scotland Yard]], instigated by Lwin's mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Craig |last=McLean |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/apr/19/bow-wow-wow-leigh-gorman-annabella-lwin |title=Bow Wow Wow haven't lost their bite &amp;#124; Music |publisher=theguardian.com |accessdate=2014-02-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228130803/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/apr/19/bow-wow-wow-leigh-gorman-annabella-lwin |archivedate=2014-02-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cover was replaced, and never appeared on the American issue.
* [[Chumbawamba]] – ''[[Anarchy (Chumbawamba album)|Anarchy]]'' (1994)
** The cover originally depicted a baby's head emerging from a woman's vagina during birth. As some stores would not sell the album due to the cover, the baby image was replaced with an image of several flowers.
* [[Cradle of Filth]] – ''[[Thornography]]'' (2006)
** In news posted on the official Cradle of Filth website in mid-May 2006, it was revealed that the planned artwork for ''Thornography'' had been vetoed by [[Roadrunner Records]]. A replacement was soon forthcoming, although numerous CD booklets had already been printed with the original image. The controversy was over the nakedness of the female figure's legs on the original cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/cradle-of-filth-thornography-cover-banned-in-the-u-s/ |title=Blabbermouth - Cradle cover banned |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427202131/http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/cradle-of-filth-thornography-cover-banned-in-the-u-s/ |archivedate=2014-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[David Bowie]] – ''[[Diamond Dogs]]'' (1973)
** The album features Bowie as a half-dog half-man hybrid, and the back cover features the creature's genitals. Following controversy, later copies of the album have the genitals airbrushed out of the painting.&lt;ref name="stonelist"/&gt;
* [[Dead Kennedys]] – ''[[Frankenchrist]]'' (1985)
** A poster inserted in the original record sleeve, [[H. R. Giger]]'s ''Landscape #XX'', or ''[[Penis Landscape]]'', was a painting depicting rows of penises in sexual intercourse. The band and its record label [[Alternative Tentacles]] were brought to criminal trial for distributing harmful matter to minors.&lt;ref name=WishniaNation&gt;Wishnia, Steven. "Of Punk and Pornography: Rockin' With the First Amendment". ''The Nation''.

Additionally, the album's actual cover – a 1970s ''[[Newsweek]]'' photograph of [[Shriners]] in a parade – prompted a 1986 lawsuit from the four elderly Shriners included in the photograph.&lt;ref name=united-press-shriners-suit-1986&gt;{{cite news|title=Album Cover Prompts Suit From Shriners|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1986-10-03/news/8602280346_1_four-shriners-record-store-album|accessdate=4 September 2015|agency=United Press International|publisher=Sun Sentinel|date=October 3, 1986|ref=united-press-shriners-suit-1986|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151128065359/http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1986-10-03/news/8602280346_1_four-shriners-record-store-album|archivedate=28 November 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Death Grips]] – ''[[No Love Deep Web]]'' (2012)
** The cover shows the erect penis of drummer [[Zach Hill]] with the album's title written in black marker. The cover caused such controversy, along with its spontaneous release without their label's permission, that the band were forced to put a disclaimer on their website. An alternative cover was subsequently released depicting a man wearing socks with the words "Suck my dick" on them.
* [[Emerson, Lake and Palmer]] — ''[[Brain Salad Surgery]]'' (1973)
** The cover was taken from a triptych by [[H. R. Giger]], which was produced based on ELP’s music. The artwork features a phallus below a woman’s chin, which was later airbrushed into a shaft of glowing light by another artist.
* [[Frenzal Rhomb]] – ''[[Dick Sandwich]]'' (1994)
** The cover shows several severed penises, some of which are being used as filling in a sandwich. They were subsequently banned from some venues and record stores.&lt;ref name="Nim"&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl = http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/14231/20020415-0000/www.howlspace.com.au/en3/frenzalrhomb/frenzalrhomb.htm | url = http://www.howlspace.com.au/en3/frenzalrhomb/frenzalrhomb.htm | title = Frenzal Rhomb | last = Nimmervoll | first = Ed | authorlink = Ed Nimmervoll | publisher = Howlspace – The Living History of Our Music.

* [[Gob (band)|Gob]] – ''Dildozer'' (1995)
** The cover for the EP depicted a crowd of people being chased through a city by a massive bulldozer with a [[penis]] attached to it. The cover also has the title with a penis in place of the "I". Many stores refused to carry the EP because of the cover. As of 2000, ''Dildozer'' is [[out of print]].
* [[Guns N' Roses]] – ''[[Appetite for Destruction]]'' (1987)
** The album's original [[cover art]], based on [[Robert Williams (artist)|Robert Williams]]' painting "Appetite for Destruction", depicted an open-shirted woman leaning against a wooden fence after clearly being raped by a robotic rapist which is about to be crushed by a dagger-toothed monster. After several music retailers refused to stock the album, the label compromised and moved the offending image to the inside sleeve, replacing it with a new image depicting a cross and skulls of the five band members.&lt;ref name="musicstak.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.musicstack.com/articles/historic-controversial-album-covers-part-two |title=Album cover info at |publisher=Musicstack.com |date=February 9, 2009 |accessdate=November 11, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817010302/http://www.musicstack.com/articles/historic-controversial-album-covers-part-two |archivedate=August 17, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The band stated the artwork is "a symbolic social statement, with the robot representing the industrial system that's raping and polluting our environment."&lt;ref name="AfDcover"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-08-16/entertainment/ca-1533_1_artwork |title=Geffen's Guns N' Roses Fires A Volley At PMRC |last1=Goldstein |first1=Patrick |date=August 16, 1987 |website=LATimes.com |access-date=June 9, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623121611/http://articles.latimes.com/1987-08-16/entertainment/ca-1533_1_artwork |archivedate=June 23, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[The Hotelier]] – ''[[Goodness (The Hotelier album)|Goodness]]'' (2016)
** The album cover shows a group of middle-aged [[naturism|nudists]] posing in the middle of a forest. The group consists of five women and three men. The album cover was completely pixelated for its iTunes release,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/goodness/id1093222186|title=Goodness by The Hotelier|date=27 May 2016|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160607084954/https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/goodness/id1093222186|archivedate=7 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many online news outlets overlaid a black box over the explicit areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soundinthesignals.com/2016/02/the-hotelier-goodness-album.html|title=The Hotelier - Goodness (Album Artwork/Track List/Vinyl Details)|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617002600/http://www.soundinthesignals.com/2016/02/the-hotelier-goodness-album.html|archivedate=2016-06-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[The Jimi Hendrix Experience]] – ''[[Electric Ladyland]]'' (1968)
** The intended artwork for the UK version of the album did not arrive in time to press the album, so a cover of naked women lounging in front of a black background was issued in its place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cracked.com/article_20196_6-alternate-album-covers-you-wont-believe-almost-happened_p2.html|title=6 Alternate Album Covers You Won't Believe Almost Happened|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829000053/http://www.cracked.com/article_20196_6-alternate-album-covers-you-wont-believe-almost-happened_p2.html|archivedate=2014-08-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[John Lennon]] &amp; [[Yoko Ono]] – ''[[Unfinished Music No. 1: Two Virgins|Unfinished Music No.1: Two Virgins]]'' (1968)
** The front cover displayed Lennon and Ono frontally nude, while the rear cover featured them from behind. Distributors were prompted to sell the album in a plain brown wrapper,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/asia/2003/heroes/yoko_ono.html Yoko Ono] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502000218/http://www.time.com/time/asia/2003/heroes/yoko_ono.html |date=2009-05-02 }}, Time magazine&lt;/ref&gt; and copies of the album were impounded as obscenity in several jurisdictions.&lt;ref name=StickeredStock&gt;{{cite journal|last=Christman|first=Ed|title=Stickered Stock: Retail's Reaction To Increased Responsibility|journal=Billboard|date=26 March 1994|page=42|volume=106|issue=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Kanye West]] - "[[Cold (Kanye West song)|Cold]]" (2012) (Single)
** The cover designed by [[George Condo]] features a woman body with bare [[breasts]]. It was intended to be the cover art of the song when the name was "Theraflu". When Kanye West changed the name of the song to "Cold", a new cover was revealed, which also caused controversies for bare breasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/earshot/kanye-west-theraflu-name-change-way-too-cold-312198|title=Kanye West's Theraflu changes title and artwork|publisher=HollywoodReporter|accessdate=June 3, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180522041436/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/earshot/kanye-west-theraflu-name-change-way-too-cold-312198|archivedate=May 22, 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Kanye West]]  – ''[[My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy]]'' (2010)
** The cover originally showed a painting by [[George Condo]] depicting West being straddled by a [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]]. As certain retail stores refused to sell the album due to the cover, Condo created a less-offensive artwork, showing a ballerina with a glass of cherry juice. However, many versions of the album still feature the original artwork, but pixelated.
* [[Led Zeppelin]] – ''[[Houses of the Holy]]'' (1973)
** The [[Hipgnosis]] cover, based on the novel ''[[Childhood's End]]'' by [[Arthur C. Clarke]], features a group of naked children ascending the [[Giant's Causeway]]. The interior art also depicts a distant figure of a naked Overlord standing on mossy ruins (nearby [[Dunluce Castle]]) while holding one of the children aloft in a ceremonial gesture. Although the album was originally released with the nudity intact, [[Atlantic Records]] were allowed to add a wrap-around paper title band to US and UK copies of the sleeve that had to be broken or slid off to access the record.&lt;ref&gt;Dave Lewis (1994), ''The Complete Guide to the Music of Led Zeppelin'', Omnibus Press, {{ISBN|0-7119-3528-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hid the children's buttocks from general display, but still the album was either banned or unavailable in some parts of the Southern United States for several years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dangerousage.com/householy.html Classic Rock Covers: Led Zeppelin; ''Houses of the Holy''.

* [[Lady Gaga]] – ''[[Artpop]]'' (2013)
** The album artwork is a sculpture of Lady Gaga by [[Jeff Koons]] with her legs open and a [[Yard globe|gazing ball]] placed between them. Although no nudity is visible on the artwork, the album cover was still censored in the [[Middle East]] and [[China]]. Rather than traditional [[censorship]], the gazing ball between her legs was enlarged to fully cover her breasts, and her legs were colored black so they don't appear naked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gigwise.com/news/87840/lady-gagas-artpop-cover-gets-photoshopped-for-censored-china-release|title=Lady Gaga's ARTPOP cover gets photoshopped for censored China release|website=www.gigwise.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623094057/http://www.gigwise.com/news/87840/lady-gagas-artpop-cover-gets-photoshopped-for-censored-china-release|archivedate=2015-06-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Lady Gaga]] – "[[Do What U Want]]" featuring [[R. Kelly]] (2013) (Single)
** The single cover is a close-up of Lady Gaga's buttocks wearing a blue, floral [[Thong (clothing)|thong]]. Lady Gaga's blonde wig hangs just above her thong-clad buttocks. The image was taken by photographer [[Terry Richardson]]. A censored version of the cover featuring a pale mauve coloured skirt edited over the top of her buttocks was used in selected countries in the [[Middle East]].
* [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]] – ''[[Mechanical Animals]]'' (1998)
** The cover shows a picture of a naked [[Marilyn Manson]] with airbrushed genitalia. Some retail stores, including [[Wal-Mart]] and [[Kmart]], refused to stock the album.
* [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] – ''[[Dark Side of the Spoon]]'' (1999)
** The album's cover depicts a naked obese woman seated in front of a blackboard where the words "I will be god" are written numerous times. The album was banned from [[Kmart]] due to the offending cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/photos/warning-these-album-covers-may-contain-explicit-content/1572579/2643346/photo.jhtml |title=Ministry's Dark Side Of The Spoon (1999) was banned by Kmart due to its cover. |date=2007-10-26 |publisher=MTV |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125054719/http://www.mtv.com/photos/warning-these-album-covers-may-contain-explicit-content/1572579/2643346/photo.jhtml |archivedate=2012-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the album's insert, the same woman covers her breasts with her hands, and her [[Buttocks|behind]] is also exposed on both the insert and back cover. The woman and the words on the blackboard were later airbrushed out.
* [[Mom's Apple Pie]] – ''[[Mom's Apple Pie]]'' (1972)
** The album was originally released with the album cover featuring a woman licking her lips and holding a pie with a slice removed showing a subtle depiction of a woman's [[vulva]] and some [[semen]] leaking from the pie. The cover was later reprinted with the vulva replaced by a miniature brick wall, topped with razor wire and removing the semen.
* [[Nicki Minaj]] – "[[Anaconda (Nicki Minaj song)|Anaconda]]" (2014) (Single)
** The artwork for this digital single depicts the subject with her back towards the camera, emphasizing her [[Thong (clothing)|thong]]-clad buttocks. Some stores censored this art by obscuring the buttocks with the [[Parental Advisory]] seal, or a black box on the edited version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/jul/25/nicki-minaj-anaconda-cover-too-sexy-instagram|title=Nicki Minaj's Anaconda cover artwork: too racy for its own good?|first=Tshepo|last=Mokoena|date=25 July 2014|website=the Guardian|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120170558/http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/jul/25/nicki-minaj-anaconda-cover-too-sexy-instagram|archivedate=20 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] – ''[[Nevermind]]'' (1991)
** The album cover featured a naked baby with his penis exposed, swimming after a dollar bill. Chain stores such as [[Wal-Mart]] and [[Kmart]] initially refused to carry ''Nevermind''. However, eventually due to such high demand, Nirvana compromised and put a sticker that read "If you're offended by this, you must be a closet pedophile" over the genitals.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad 1993, p. 180–81&lt;/ref&gt; Nirvana saw continued controversy for their next album, ''[[In Utero (album)|In Utero]]''.
* [[NOFX]] – ''[[Heavy Petting Zoo]]'' (1996)
** The album features two covers, one for the CD version and one for the LP version; both of them caused controversy. The CD version features a man sitting down on the ground in a petting zoo cuddling a sheep with his hand on the sheep's genitalia area. The LP version sparked even more controversy than the CD version, as it features the same man in a [[69 (sex position)|69 position]] with the same sheep. The album is known as ''Eating Lamb'' on the LP. The LP version was banned from [[Germany]] due to the cover's subject matter.
* [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] – ''[[Mother's Milk]]'' (1989)
** The album cover features a black and white photograph of the band sprawled across the arms of a proportionately larger naked woman. A rose conceals one of her nipples while singer [[Anthony Kiedis]]' standing body conceals the other. Several national chains refused to sell the record because they believed the female subject displayed too much nudity. A stricter censored version was manufactured for some retailers that featured the band members in far larger proportion than the original.&lt;ref name=apterartwork&gt;Apter, 2004. pp. 196–197&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Rob Zombie]] – ''[[Mondo Sex Head]]'' (2012)
** The cover features a nude female's buttocks, but after controversy arose, it was replaced by an image of a cat, which was referred to as a "[[pussy]] shot".&lt;ref name="rollingstone"&gt;{{cite web| title = Rob Zombie Unveils 'Mondo Sex Head' Album Art| work = [[Rolling Stone]]| date = July 2, 2012| url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/q-a-rob-zombie-on-his-new-album-art-20120702| accessdate = November 10, 2012| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130105232311/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/q-a-rob-zombie-on-his-new-album-art-20120702| archivedate = January 5, 2013| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Roger Waters]] – ''[[The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking]]'' (1984)
** The cover features a rear-view and nude image of model and pornography actress [[Linzi Drew]]. It was condemned by many feminist groups and was also accused of promoting rape. [[Columbia Records]] was forced to place a black box covering the nudity for future releases to avoid more controversy.
* [[Roxy Music]] – ''[[Country Life (Roxy Music album)|Country Life]]'' (1974)
** The album features scantily clad models Constanze Karoli and Eveline Grunwald – the sister and girlfriend, respectively, of [[Can (band)|Can]] guitarist [[Michael Karoli]] – posed in front of a bush. Although no nudity is directly shown in the photograph, Grunwald is topless. For a later American release of the album, the front cover was replaced by mirroring the photograph on the album's back cover, which features the foliage and forest, but neither woman.&lt;ref name="billboardlist"&gt;{{cite web|title=20 Banned Album Covers {{!}} Billboard|url=http://www.billboard.com/photos/426842/20-banned-album-covers/1|website=Billboard|accessdate=7 October 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920201101/http://www.billboard.com/photos/426842/20-banned-album-covers/1|archivedate=20 September 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]] – ''[[Virgin Killer]]'' (1976)
** This cover featured a photo of a naked [[puberty|prepubescent]] girl, with her pubic area partially obscured by a "cracked glass" effect.  Her pose and the title "Virgin Killer" added to the image's notoriety. The [[Internet Watch Foundation]], a British non-profit group who provides content blacklists for major [[Internet service provider|ISPs]] in the country, also notably [[Internet Watch Foundation and Wikipedia|blacklisted]] pages on [[Wikipedia]] for featuring the cover on its article about the album.&lt;ref name="efluxmedia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.efluxmedia.com/news_UK_Censors_Wikipedia_Article_with_Nude_Girl_Album_Cover_30919.html |title=UK Censors Wikipedia Article with Nude Girl Album Cover |first=Eric |last=Blair |work= |accessdate=9 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211002806/http://www.efluxmedia.com/news_UK_Censors_Wikipedia_Article_with_Nude_Girl_Album_Cover_30919.html |archivedate=11 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This block was later retracted due to technical problems which occurred as a result of the blocking mechanisms and due to the already "wide availability" of the image.&lt;ref name="c42"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/science_technology/iwf+lifts+wikipedia+ban/2878257|title=IWF lifts Wikipedia ban|date=9 December 2008|work=[[Channel 4 News]]|publisher=[[Channel 4 News]]|accessdate=10 December 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AkVJZ3hj?url=http://www.channel4.com/news/|archivedate=17 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Suede (band)|Suede]] – ''[[Suede (album)|Suede]]'' (1993)
** The gender-ambiguous cover art provoked controversy in the press,&lt;ref name="Metro"&gt;"[http://www.metro.co.uk/metrolife/music/article.html?Past_Mercury_Music_Prize_winners&amp;in_article_id=706475&amp;in_page_id=25 Past Mercury Music Prize winners"]. ''[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]]''. Retrieved on 3 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; prompting Anderson to comment, "I chose it because of the ambiguity of it, but mostly because of the beauty of it." The cover image of the androgynous kissing couple was taken from the 1991 book ''Stolen Glances: Lesbians Take Photographs'' edited by Tessa Boffin and Jean Fraser. The photograph was taken by [[Tee Corinne]] and in its entirety shows a woman kissing an acquaintance in a wheelchair.&lt;ref name="B114"&gt;Barnett, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[The Strokes]] – ''[[Is This It]]'' (2001)
** The original cover art featured a photograph of a woman's nude bottom and hip, with a leather-gloved hand suggestively resting on it. Although British retail chains [[HMV]] and [[Woolworths Group|Woolworths]] objected to the photograph's controversial nature, they stocked the album without amendment.&lt;ref name="strokes"&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Miles, Barry |editor2=Scott, Grant |editor3=Morgan, Johnny |title=The Greatest Album Covers of All Time|year=2008 |page=251|publisher=[[Anova Books]]|isbn=1-84340-481-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the band's native United States, the cover was changed to a photograph of [[subatomic particle]] tracks in a [[bubble chamber]]. This decision was made by frontman [[Julian Casablancas]] because he liked this image more than the original cover, and was independent of any controversy or label demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,254810,00.html|title=Hear &amp; Now|author=Willman, Chris|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=September 14, 2001|accessdate=November 20, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425175122/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,254810,00.html|archivedate=April 25, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Tin Machine]] – ''[[Tin Machine II]]'' (1991)
** The original cover featured a row of four nude [[Kouros|Kouroi]]. In the U.S., the genitalia of the statues were airbrushed out, leading band member [[David Bowie]] to exclaim, "Only in America!"&lt;ref name=RM91&gt;"Beaming Bowie excited about current direction of his life, music" by Patrick MacDonald, The Seattle Times, 20 December 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

** Photos in the liner notes of a nude obese woman, a nude man of normal weight, a cow licking its genitals, and the band members with pins in the sides of their heads generated controversy, resulting in the album being removed from stores such as [[Kmart]] and [[Walmart|Wal-Mart]].&lt;ref name="Axcess"&gt;{{cite web | last =Griffin | first =J.R. | title =Tool on Videos, Censorship, Art, And Why You Should Never Let A Guy Named Maynard Put You In A Cage | work =Axcess | year =1994 | url =http://toolshed.down.net/articles/index.php?action=view-article&amp;id=Sometime_1994--Axcess.html | accessdate =2007-05-13 | quote =It came as no surprise when Wal-Mart and Kmart refused to carry the album.

** The explicit cover shows a big picture in the bottom. The picture shows there are some balloons and there is a woman in these balloons appearing topless, showing off her breast outside in the balloons. When the mixtape was sold separately for retail release on iTunes and in stores in 2015, the cover was then censored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theweeknd.com/store/house-balloons-cd-or-mp3-0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316112959/https://www.theweeknd.com/store/house-balloons-cd-or-mp3-0 |archivedate=2017-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

** The cover features a stained-glass image of an African-American [[Jesus]] wearing a red bandanna across his lower face, a [[Jesus Piece (jewelry)|Jesus piece]] necklace, and a [[teardrop tattoo]]. After the [[Roman Catholic Church]] complained to [[Interscope Records]] about the cover, Game decided to make this cover for the deluxe edition and use a different cover for the standard edition. The standard cover features a black-and-white photo of the rapper's deceased brother Jevon Danell Taylor, who died on May 21, 1995 at the age of 20 after being shot.
* [[Jimi Hendrix]] – ''[[Axis: Bold as Love]]'' (1967)

** An alternative cover was reportedly created by Justin Bieber's team for his ''Purpose'' album after several Muslim nations across the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]] as well as [[Indonesia]], took issue with Bieber being shirtless in the original artwork and flaunting his cross tattoo, promoting Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Justin Bieber Purpose album cover banned in Middle East for promoting Christianity|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/justin-bieber-purpose-album-cover-banned-middle-east-promoting-christianity-1523812|website=IB Times|date=October 13, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016024157/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/justin-bieber-purpose-album-cover-banned-middle-east-promoting-christianity-1523812|archivedate=October 16, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

** The cover depicts a mutilated, stoned [[Jesus Christ|Christ]] in a sea of blood with mutilated heads. For stores who refused to sell the album with the original cover, an alternative cover was provided instead. In India, Joseph Dias, general secretary of the Mumbai Christian group [[Catholic Secular Forum]], took "strong exception" to the original album artwork, and issued a memorandum to Mumbai's police commissioner in protest. As a result, all Indian stocks were recalled and destroyed.&lt;ref name="IllusionRecalled"&gt;{{cite web

* [[Steve Taylor]] – ''[[I Predict 1990]]'' (1987)
** The album's cover, influenced by early 20th century French [[Neo-impressionism|neo-impressionist]] poster art and painted by Taylor's wife, was controversial with some Christian retailers who instead believed it to be a reference to [[tarot]] and [[New Age]] philosophy. The album was pulled from several stores as a result.&lt;ref name="WD_145"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Peterson |first=Doug |title=Door Magazine, This Is Your Life!

Some Christian bookstores which did not pull the album for its cover pulled it due to the song or its title, either because its critique of the pro-life movement offended store owners and customers, or because these same individuals missed the song's satirical point, and believed Taylor advocated such violence.&lt;ref name="CCM"&gt;''Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music''; Powell; p931; Hendrickson Publishers; paperback edition (August 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tenacious D]] – ''[[Tenacious D (album)|Tenacious D]]'' (2001)
** The album cover received controversy due to its parody of [[The Devil (Tarot card)|the Devil tarot card]]. On the back of the CD were two babies locked to Satan. This caused the album to be pulled from many stores and in later US copies of the CD the babies were airbrushed out. Though for the July 2002 CD release of the album in the UK and also the 2013 re-release on vinyl, the babies were kept in.

* [[Matchbox Twenty]] – ''[[Yourself or Someone Like You]]'' (1996)
** The album's cover depicts a man with glasses wearing a shirt on his left shoulder and a pilot hat. Frank Torres, the man featured on the cover image sued the band in May 2005, claiming Matchbox Twenty had no permission from him to use his photo on the album's cover and that the photo had been the cause of mental anguish.

** The cover features the album title, "U2", as a very large logo, with the band's name in small text beneath the album. [[Island Records]] sued the band for the use of the misleading album cover because "U2" is trademark of the label. The songs on the album were controversial too, as they were versions of [[U2]]'s song "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" which were copied without permission.
* [[Richard Pryor]] – ''[[Richard Pryor (album)|Richard Pryor]]'' (1968)
** The debut album of comedian Richard Pryor was recorded live at [[The Troubadour (Los Angeles)|The Troubadour]] in West Hollywood, California. The cover was art-directed and designed by [[Gary Burden]]. According to Burden, "As a result of the Richard Pryor album cover, which I loved doing, I got two letters: One was a letter from the [[National Geographic Society]]’s attorneys offering to sue me for defaming their publication. The second letter was a [[1970 Grammy Awards|Grammy nomination]] for the best album cover."&lt;ref&gt;[http://garyburdenforrtwerk.com/2009/09/richard-pryor/ Richard Pryor | Gary Burden For R.

* [[Sonic Youth]] – ''[[Sister (Sonic Youth album)|Sister]]'' (1987)
** The album's artwork has been edited two separate times to obscure images; the first of which was a [[Richard Avedon]] image depicting a 12-year-old girl, due to a lawsuit threat.

In July 2010, the band and their label were sued by the model, Kirsten Kennis.

** In early 1966, photographer [[Robert Whitaker (photographer)|Robert Whitaker]] had the Beatles in the studio for a [[conceptual art]] piece titled ''A Somnambulant Adventure''. For the shoot, Whitaker took a series of pictures of the group dressed in butcher smocks and draped with pieces of meat and body parts from plastic baby dolls.

* [[Cannibal Corpse]] – Various albums (1990–2006)
** [[Death metal]] band Cannibal Corpse's albums were all banned from Germany until 2006 due to their graphic album covers and disturbing lyrics. The band was also forbidden to play any songs from those albums while touring in Germany. This prohibition was not lifted until June 2006. In an interview from 2004, George Fisher attempted to recall what originally provoked the ban: "A woman saw someone wearing one of our shirts, I think she is a schoolteacher, and she just caused this big stink about it. So [now] we can't play anything from the first three records. And it really sucks because kids come up and they want us to play all the old songs — and we would — but they know the deal.

A blimp on the left in the sky says "Bad Year" (possibly a parody of the [[Goodyear Blimp]]) and on the right is a man with a harp in a cloud. Retailers [[Walmart]] and [[Kmart]] refused to sell the album because of this. Despite the controversy, no alternative cover has existed.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} However, later printings of the album edited the back cover for copyright reasons, airbrushing out a puppet of [[Ernie (Sesame Street)|Ernie]] from ''[[Sesame Street]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feelnumb.com/2011/03/31/ernie-from-sesame-street-had-to-be-airbrushed-off-the-back-cover-of-the-green-day-album-dookie/|title=Ernie From Sesame Street Had To Be Airbrushed Off The Back Cover Of The Green Day Album “Dookie”|date=31 March 2011|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150717214105/http://www.feelnumb.com/2011/03/31/ernie-from-sesame-street-had-to-be-airbrushed-off-the-back-cover-of-the-green-day-album-dookie/|archivedate=17 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ice-T]] – ''[[Home Invasion (album)|Home Invasion]]'' (1993)
** The album's cover depicted a white boy listening to rap music in the midst of a home invasion in which Blacks are attacking Whites (presumably the boy's parents). [[Sire Records]], owned by [[Time Warner]], refused to release the album with the cover, and Ice-T left the label as a result.&lt;ref&gt;''The Ice Opinion'', Ice-T as dictated to Heidi Siegmund, St. Martin's Press, New York, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] – ''[[Street Survivors]]'' (1977)
** The original cover sleeve for ''Street Survivors'' had featured a photograph of the band, particularly Steve Gaines, standing in the street of a town engulfed in flames. Three days after the album was released, three of the band members were killed in a plane crash due to fuel exhaustion. Out of respect for the deceased (and at the request of Teresa Gaines, Steve Gaines' widow), MCA Records withdrew the original cover and replaced it with a similar image of the band against a simple black background.  Thirty years later, for the deluxe CD version of Street Survivors, the original "flames" cover was restored.&lt;ref name=Check-Six&gt;{{cite web |title=The 'Lynyrd Skynyrd' Crash |url=http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/LynyrdSkynyrd-N55VM.htm |work=Check-Six.com |date=May 2007 |accessdate=July 5, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AxpnRuHV?url=http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/LynyrdSkynyrd-N55VM.htm |archivedate=September 26, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Manic Street Preachers]] – ''[[Journal for Plague Lovers]]'' (2009)
** The album art depicts a painting by [[Jenny Saville]].  A number of UK supermarkets deemed the red/[[ochre]] colours on the portrait to be blood, and therefore used alternative packaging to stock the item.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/may/15/manic-street-preachers-album-supermarkets Manic Street Preachers album cover censored by supermarkets] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420234758/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/may/15/manic-street-preachers-album-supermarkets |date=2017-04-20 }} The Guardian, 15 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The alternative packaging in question is a [[longbox]], a type of outer packaging used for some CDs in the 1980s and early to mid-1990s.
* [[Metallica]] – ''[[Kill 'Em All]]'' (1983)
** The album was originally set to be titled ''Metal Up Your Ass'', with the cover featuring a toilet bowl with a hand clutching a dagger emerging from it. However, at the request of [[Megaforce Records]] (who thought the original album title would be inappropriate),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encycmet.com/biography/ |title=ENCYCLOPEDIA METALLICA – Complete history |publisher=Encycmet.com |date=September 3, 1983 |accessdate=June 21, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130710070554/http://www.encycmet.com/biography/ |archivedate=July 10, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the band changed the album title to ''Kill 'Em All''. They also changed the artwork, this time depicting a shadow of a hand releasing a bloodied hammer.
* [[The Offspring]] – ''[[The Offspring (album)|The Offspring]]'' (1989)
** The album's original artwork depicted an image of a man's body exploding as the [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|xenomorph]] from the ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'' franchise holding a [[Fender Stratocaster|Stratocaster]] guitar emerges from his chest. The album was reportedly banned for being "too grotesque",&lt;ref name="Barker"/&gt; and on the 1995 reissue, the artwork was replaced by a blurry black-and-white picture of a man. It was later admitted that the band and their studio never really liked the original artwork.
* [[Pink Floyd]] – ''[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish You Were Here]]'' (1975)
** The artwork depicts two men shaking hands in an alley at [[Warner Bros. Studios]], with one on fire. As some retailers deemed it "too violent" and refused the sell the album, the cover was replaced on some re-releases with a black background featuring the album's four-elements sticker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/goodlife/11574460/10-banned-album-covers.html?frame=3287295|title=10 Banned Album Covers|first=Rachel|last=Thompson|work=The Telegraph|date=1 May 2015|accessdate=24 June 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626155420/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/goodlife/11574460/10-banned-album-covers.html?frame=3287295|archivedate=26 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[The Mamas and the Papas]] – ''[[If You Can Believe Your Eyes and Ears]]'' (1966)
** The album cover, which features the four members in a bathtub, also featured a toilet in the far right corner. The inclusion of this toilet was controversial for the time and copies with the cover were pulled due to complaints of indecency. The copies were re-issued with a text-box pasted on top of the toilet.

** When ''In Utero'' was released, there were many objections to the song "[[Rape Me]]", despite the band's claims that the lyrics were "anti-rape." Retailers [[Wal-Mart]] and [[Kmart]] refused to sell the album because of the back cover artwork (featuring model fetuses), so a "clean" version was released for them which featured an altered version of the back cover and listed the title "Rape Me" as "Waif Me", though the song remained unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nirvanaclub.com/get.php?section=info/general&amp;file=nfc_faq2.htm#96 Nirvana fan club FAQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107055629/http://www.nirvanaclub.com/get.php?section=info%2Fgeneral&amp;file=nfc_faq2.htm |date=2017-11-07 }} Retrieved on 10 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ericnuzum.com/banned/incidents/90s.html Banned albums of the 90s] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621101224/http://ericnuzum.com/banned/incidents/90s.html |date=2007-06-21 }} Retrieved on 10 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The band acquiesced to the demands to change the artwork because members [[Kurt Cobain]] and [[Krist Novoselic]] were only able to buy music from the two chain stores as children; as a result they wanted to "make their music available to kids who don't have the opportunity to go to mom-and-pop stores".&lt;ref&gt;Gordinier, Jeff.

{{Indo-European topics}}
'''Marija Gimbutas''' ({{lang-lt|Marija Gimbutienė}}; January 23, 1921 – February 2, 1994) was a Lithuanian-American [[archaeology|archaeologist]] and [[anthropologist]] known for her research into the [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] cultures of "[[Old European Culture|Old Europe]]" and for her [[Kurgan hypothesis]], which located the [[Proto-Indo-European homeland]] in the [[Pontic Steppe]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Born as '''Marija Birutė Alseikaitė''' to Veronika Janulaitytė-Alseikienė and Danielius Alseika in [[Vilnius]], the capital of [[Republic of Central Lithuania]]; her parents were members of the Lithuanian intelligentsia.&lt;ref name="WareBraukman234"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ware|Braukman|2004|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her mother received a doctorate in [[ophthalmology]] at the [[University of Berlin]] in 1908 and became the first female physician in Lithuania, while her father received his medical degree from the [[University of Tartu]] in 1910. After the 1917 [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], Gimbutas's parents founded the first Lithuanian hospital in the capital.&lt;ref name="WareBraukman234"/&gt;

During this period, her father also served as the publisher of the newspaper ''Vilniaus Žodis'' and the cultural magazine ''Vilniaus Šviesa'' and was an outspoken proponent of Lithuanian independence during the [[Polish–Lithuanian War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marler|1998|p=114}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gimbutas's parents were connoisseurs of traditional Lithuanian folk arts and frequently invited contemporary musicians, writers, and authors to their home, including [[Vydūnas]], [[Juozas Tumas-Vaižgantas]], and [[Jonas Basanavičius]].&lt;ref name="Marler115"&gt;{{Harvnb|Marler|1998|p=115}}.&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to her strong cultural upbringing, Gimbutas said:&lt;blockquote&gt;I had the opportunity to get acquainted with writers and artists such as Vydūnas, Tumas-Vaižgantas, even Basanavičius, who was taken care of by my parents. When I was four or five years old, I would sit in Basanavičius's easy chair and I would feel fine. And later, throughout my entire life, Basanavičius's collected folklore remained extraordinarily important for me.&lt;ref name="Marler115"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1931, Gimbutas settled with her parents in [[Kaunas]], the [[temporary capital of Lithuania]], where she continued her studies. After her parents separated that year, she lived with her mother and brother, Vytautas, in Kaunas. Five years later, her father died suddenly. At her father's deathbed, Gimbutas pledged that she would study to become a scholar: "All of a sudden I had to think what I shall be, what I shall do with my life. I had been so reckless in sports—swimming for miles, skating, bicycle riding. I changed completely and began to read."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marler|1998|p=116}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marler|1997|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, she married architect Jurgis Gimbutas. During the [[Second World War]], Gimbutas lived under both Soviet and German occupations from 1940–41 and 1941–43, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ware|Braukman|2004|pp=234–35}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emigration===
Their first daughter, Danutė, was born in June 1942; early in 1944 the young Gimbutas family fled the country in the face of an advancing Soviet army, first to Vienna and then to Innsbruck and Bavaria.&lt;ref name="WareBraukman235"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ware|Braukman|2004|p=235}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In her reflection of this turbulent period, Gimbutas remarked, "Life just twisted me like a little plant, but my work was continuous in one direction."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marler|1998|p=118}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

While holding a postdoctoral fellowship at Tübingen the following year, Gimbutas gave birth to her second daughter, Živilė. She did postgraduate work at the University of Heidelberg and the University of Munich from 1947 to 1949. The Gimbutas family left Germany and relocated to the United States in 1949.&lt;ref name="WareBraukman235"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chapman|1998|p=300}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marler|1998|p=119}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her third daughter, Rasa Julija, was born in August 1954 in Boston.

===Death===
She died in Los Angeles in 1994, at age 73. Soon afterwards, she was interred in Kaunas's [[Petrašiūnai Cemetery]].

==Career==
From 1936, she participated in [[ethnography|ethnographic]] expeditions to record traditional folklore and studied Lithuanian beliefs and rituals of death.&lt;ref name="WareBraukman234"/&gt; She graduated with honors from Aušra Gymnasium in Kaunas in 1938 and enrolled in the [[Vytautas Magnus University]] the same year, where she studied [[linguistics]] in the Department of Philology. She then attended the [[University of Vilnius]] to pursue graduate studies in archaeology (under [[Jonas Puzinas]]), linguistics, ethnology, folklore and literature.&lt;ref name="WareBraukman234"/&gt;

In 1942 she completed her master's thesis, "Modes of Burial in Lithuania in the Iron Age", with honors.&lt;ref name="WareBraukman234" /&gt; She received her Master of Arts degree from the University of Vilnius, Lithuania, in 1942.

In 1946, Gimbutas received a doctorate in archaeology, with minors in ethnology and [[history of religion]], from [[Tübingen University]] with her dissertation "Prehistoric Burial Rites in Lithuania" (in German), which was published later that year.&lt;ref name="WareBraukman235" /&gt;

After arriving in the United States, Gimbutas immediately went to work at [[Harvard University]] translating Eastern European archaeological texts. She then became a lecturer in the Department of Anthropology. In 1955 she was made a Fellow of Harvard's [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology|Peabody Museum]].

Gimbutas was Professor Emeritus at UCLA, where she became Professor of European Archaeology and Indo-European Studies in 1964 and Curator of Old World Archaeology in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.brown.edu/Research/Breaking_Ground/results.php?d=1&amp;first=Marija&amp;last=Gimbutas|title=Women in Old World Archaeology|website=Brown.edu|accessdate=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marija Gimbutas papers are held at OPUS Archives and Gimbutas's personal library is held in The Joseph Campbell and Marija Gimbutas Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opusarchives.org/marija-gimbutas-collection/|title=The Marija Gimbutas Collection - OPUS Archives and Research Center|website=Opusarchives.org|accessdate=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kurgan hypothesis===
In 1956 Gimbutas introduced her ''[[Kurgan hypothesis]]'', which combined archaeological study of the distinctive ''[[Kurgan]]'' burial mounds with linguistics to unravel some problems in the study of the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE) speaking peoples, whom she dubbed the "Kurgans"; namely, to account for their origin and to trace their migrations into Europe. This hypothesis, and the act of bridging the disciplines, has had a significant impact on [[Indo-European studies]].

During the 1950s and early 1960s, Gimbutas earned a reputation as a world-class specialist on [[Bronze Age Europe]], as well as on Lithuanian folk art and the [[prehistory]] of the [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]], partly summed up in her definitive opus, ''Bronze Age Cultures of Central and Eastern Europe'' (1965). In her work she reinterpreted European prehistory in light of her backgrounds in linguistics, ethnology, and the history of religions, and challenged many traditional assumptions about the beginnings of European civilization.

As a Professor of European Archaeology and Indo-European Studies at [[UCLA]] from 1963 to 1989, Gimbutas directed major excavations of Neolithic sites in southeastern Europe between 1967 and 1980, including Anzabegovo, near [[Štip]], Republic of Macedonia, and [[Sitagroi]] and [[Achilleion (Thessaly)|Achilleion]] in [[Thessaly]] (Greece). Digging through layers of earth representing a period of time before contemporary estimates for Neolithic habitation in Europe – where other archaeologists would not have expected further finds – she unearthed a great number of artifacts of daily life and of religious cults, which she researched and documented throughout her career. During her successful career, Gimbutas stated, "After a millennium when the Hun Empire collapsed, a distinct [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] culture re-emerged and spread rapidly," and "Neither [[Bulgars]] nor [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] colonized the [[Balkan]] Peninsula, after storming Thrace, Illyria and Greece they went back to their territory north of the Danube. It was the [[Slavs]] who did the colonizing."{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Three genetic studies in 2015 gave support to the [[Kurgan theory]] of Gimbutas regarding the [[Indo-European Urheimat]]. According to those studies, haplogroups R1b and R1a, now the most common in Europe (R1a is also common in South Asia) would have expanded from the Russian steppes, along with the Indo European languages; they also detected an autosomal component present in modern Europeans which was not present in Neolithic Europeans, which would have been introduced with paternal lineages R1b and R1a, as well as Indo European Languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/02/10/013433|title=Massive migration from the steppe is a source for Indo-European languages in Europe|first1=Wolfgang|last1=Haak|first2=Iosif|last2=Lazaridis|first3=Nick|last3=Patterson|first4=Nadin|last4=Rohland|first5=Swapan|last5=Mallick|first6=Bastien|last6=Llamas|first7=Guido|last7=Brandt|first8=Susanne|last8=Nordenfelt|first9=Eadaoin|last9=Harney|first10=Kristin|last10=Stewardson|first11=Qiaomei|last11=Fu|first12=Alissa|last12=Mittnik|first13=Eszter|last13=Bánffy|first14=Christos|last14=Economou|first15=Michael|last15=Francken|first16=Susanne|last16=Friederich|first17=Rafael Garrido|last17=Pena|first18=Fredrik|last18=Hallgren|first19=Valery|last19=Khartanovich|first20=Aleksandr|last20=Khokhlov|first21=Michael|last21=Kunst|first22=Pavel|last22=Kuznetsov|first23=Harald|last23=Meller|first24=Oleg|last24=Mochalov|first25=Vayacheslav|last25=Moiseyev|first26=Nicole|last26=Nicklisch|first27=Sandra L.|last27=Pichler|first28=Roberto|last28=Risch|first29=Manuel A.

===Late archaeology===
[[File:Marija-Gimbutas-newgrange.jpg|thumb|right|187px|Marija Gimbutas by Kerbstone 52, at the back of [[Newgrange]], [[Co. Meath]], [[Ireland]], in September 1989]]
Gimbutas gained fame and notoriety in the English-speaking world with her last three English-language books: ''The Goddesses and Gods of Old Europe'' (1974); ''The Language of the Goddess'' (1989), which inspired an exhibition in [[Wiesbaden]], 1993–94; and the last of the three, ''The Civilization of the Goddess'' (1991), which, based on her documented archaeological findings, presented an overview of her conclusions about Neolithic cultures across Europe: housing patterns, social structure, art, religion, and the nature of literacy.

''The Civilization of the Goddess'' articulated what Gimbutas saw as the differences between the Old European system, which she considered goddess- and woman-centered ([[gynocentric]]), and the Bronze Age Indo-European [[patriarchal]] ("androcratic") culture which supplanted it. According to her interpretations, gynocentric (or ''[[matristic]]'') societies were peaceful, honored women, and espoused [[Economic egalitarianism|economic equality]].

The androcratic, or male-dominated, Kurgan peoples, on the other hand, invaded Europe and imposed upon its natives the hierarchical rule of male warriors.

Gimbutas's work, along with that of her colleague, mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]], is housed in the [[Pacifica Graduate Institute#Marija Gimbutas Collection at OPUS|OPUS Archives and Research Center]] on the campus of the [[Pacifica Graduate Institute]] in [[Carpinteria, California]]. The library includes Gimbutas's extensive collection on the topics of archaeology, mythology, folklore, art and linguistics. The Gimbutas Archives house over 12,000 images personally taken by Gimbutas of sacred figures, as well as research files on Neolithic cultures of Old Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opusarchives.org/gimbutas_overview.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606092451/http://www.opusarchives.org/gimbutas_overview.shtml |archivedate=2010-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doctorate===
In 1946, Marija Gimbutas received her PhD in Archeology &amp; Applied Sciences from the University of Tübingen, Germany. Her doctoral dissertation was titled, "Die Bestattung in Litauen in der vorgeschichtlichen Zeit" ("Burials in Lithuania in Prehistoric Times") and was published by J.C.B. Mohr, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[https://katalog.ub.uni-tuebingen.de/opac/RDSRecord/RDSDetails?id=010331530] {{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; She often said that she had the dissertation under one arm and her child under the other arm when she and her husband fled the city of Kaunas, Lithuania in the face of an advancing Soviet army in 1944.

In 1993, Marija Gimbutas received an honorary doctorate at Vytautas Magnus University in Kaunas, Lithuania.

===Influence===
Gimbutas's theories have been extended and embraced by a number of [[neopaganism]] authors. Gimbutas did identify the diverse and complex Paleolithic and Neolithic female representations she recognized as depicting a single universal Great Goddess, but also as manifesting a range of female deities: snake goddess, bee goddess, bird goddess, mountain goddess, Mistress of the Animals, etc., which were not necessarily ubiquitous throughout Europe.

In a tape entitled "The Age of the Great Goddess," Gimbutas discusses the various manifestations of the Goddess which occur, and stresses the ultimate unity behind them: all of the Earth as feminine.

In 2003, filmmaker [[Donna Read]] and neopagan author and activist [[Starhawk]] released a collaborative documentary film about the life and work of Gimbutas, ''Signs Out of Time''. The film produced under the label Belili Productions examines "her theories, her critics, and her influence on scholars, feminists and social thinkers."

==Assessment==
[[File:Gimbutas.jpg|thumb|Marija Gimbutienė commemorative plaque in [[Kaunas]], Mickevičius Street]]

===Praise===
[[Joseph Campbell]] and [[Ashley Montagu]]&lt;ref&gt;"According to anthropologist Ashley Montagu, "Marija Gimbutas has given us a veritable Rosetta Stone of the greatest heuristic value for future work in the hermeneutics of archaeology and anthropology." {{cite web|url=http://www.online.pacifica.edu/cgl/Gimbutasbio |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2004-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040204135051/http://www.online.pacifica.edu/cgl/Gimbutasbio |archivedate=2004-02-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Steinfels90"&gt;[[Peter Steinfels]] (1990) ''[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE1DD1631F930A25751C0A966958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all Idyllic Theory Of Goddesses Creates Storm]''. NY Times, February 13, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; each compared the importance of Marija Gimbutas's output to the historical importance of the [[Rosetta Stone]] in deciphering [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]. Campbell provided a foreword to a new edition of Gimbutas's ''The Language of the Goddess'' (1989) before he died, and often said how profoundly he regretted that her research on the Neolithic cultures of Europe had not been available when he was writing ''[[The Masks of God]]''. The [[ecofeminist]] [[Charlene Spretnak]] argued in 2011 that a "backlash" against Gimbutas's work had been orchestrated, starting in the last years of her life and following her death.&lt;ref&gt;Spretnak C., (2011), in Marler J. and Haarmann H., (eds.), [http://www.charlenespretnak.com/files/JoA_article_by_CS_on_MG.pdf "Anatomy of a Backlash: Concerning the Work of Marija Gimbutas"], Journal of Archaeomythology, 7: 1–27, ISSN 2162-6871&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception===
Mainstream archaeology dismissed Gimbutas's later works.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kiparsky, "[http://web.stanford.edu/~kiparsky/Papers/handbook.pdf New perspectives in historical linguistics]", [http://web.stanford.edu/~kiparsky/ To appear in Claire Bowern (ed.)Handbook of Historical Linguistics.]&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologist Bernard Wailes (1934–2012) of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] commented to ''The New York Times'' that most of Gimbutas's peers&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times book of science literacy: what everyone needs to know from Newton to the knuckleball, page 85, Richard Flaste, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; believe her to be "immensely knowledgeable but not very good in critical analysis. ... She amasses all the data and then leaps from it to conclusions without any intervening argument." He said that most archaeologists consider her to be an eccentric.&lt;ref name="Steinfels90"/&gt;

[[David W. Anthony]] has praised Gimbutas's insights regarding the Indo-European Urheimat, but also disputed Gimbutas's assertion that there was a widespread peaceful society before the Kurgan incursion, noting that Europe had hillforts and weapons, and presumably warfare, long before the Kurgan.&lt;ref name="Steinfels90"/&gt; A standard textbook of European prehistory corroborates this point, stating that warfare existed in neolithic Europe and that adult males were given preferential treatment in burial rites.&lt;ref&gt;S. Milisauskas, ''European prehistory'' (Springer, 2002), p.82, 386, etc. See also Colin Renfrew, ed., ''The Megalithic Monuments of Western Europe: the latest evidence'' (London : Thames and Hudson, 1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Ucko]] and Andrew Fleming were two early critics of the "Goddess" theory, with which later Gimbutas came to be associated. Ucko, in his 1968 monograph ''Anthropomorphic figurines of predynastic Egypt'' warned against unwarranted inferences about the meanings of statues. He notes, for example, that early Egyptian figurines of women holding their breasts had been taken as "obviously" significant of maternity or fertility, but the Pyramid Texts revealed that in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] this was the female gesture of grief.&lt;ref&gt;P. Ucko, ''Anthropomorphic figurines of predynastic Egypt and neolithic Crete with comparative material from the prehistoric Near East and mainland Greece'' (London, A. Szmidla, 1968).&lt;/ref&gt;

Fleming, in his 1969 paper "The Myth of the Mother Goddess", questioned the practice of identifying neolithic figures as female when they weren't clearly distinguished as male and took issue with other aspects of the "Goddess" interpretation of Neolithic stone carvings and burial practices.&lt;ref&gt;A. Fleming (1969), [http://stevewatson.info/readings/ancient_interests/Fleming-Mother_Goddess.pdf "The Myth of the Mother Goddess"], ''World Archaeology'' 1(2), 247–261.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009 book ''Knossos and the Prophets of Modernism'' by Cathy Gere examines the political influence on archaeology more generally. Through the example of [[Knossos]] on the island of [[Crete]], which had been represented as the paradigm of a pacifist, matriarchal and sexually free society, Gere claims that archaeology can easily slip into reflecting what people want to see, rather than teaching people about an unfamiliar past.&lt;ref&gt;Cathy Gere (2009), ''Knossos and the Prophets of Modernism'', University of Chicago Press, pp. 4–16ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

In semantics, a '''meaning postulate''' is the notion that lexical items  can be defined in terms of relations with other lexical items.  The classic example (formulated by [[Rudolf Carnap]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}) is: bachelor = unmarried male.

Meaning Postulate is a formula to express an aspect of the sense of a predicate. The formula is expressed with - so-called - connectives.
The used connectives are:
   paraphrase ≡ "if and only if"
   entailment → "if"
   binary antonomy ~ "not"

Following examples will simplify this:

1. "If and only if X is a man, then X is a human being." In meaning postulate this would look like this:
   x MAN ≡ x HUMAN BEING

2. "If X is a girl, then X is female." In meaning postulate this would look like this:
   x GIRL → x FEMALE

3. "X is not awake, therefore X is asleep." In meaning postulate this would look like this:
   x ASLEEP → ~x AWAKE

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23377">In the United States, '''LGBTQ youth of colour''' are [[marginalized]] adolescents in the [[LGBT community|LGBTQ community]]. Social issues include [[Homelessness among LGBT youth in the United States|homelessness]]; [[cyberbullying]]; [[physical abuse|physical]], [[verbal abuse|verbal]] and [[sexual abuse]]; [[Suicide among LGBT youth|suicide]]; [[drug addiction]]; street violence; immigration surveillance; engagement in high-risk sexual activity; [[self-harm]], and [[Depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref name="Brockenbrough"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vaccaro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GSA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shared Differences"&gt;Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network,. Shared Differences: The Experiences Of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual And Transgender Students Of Color In Our Nation's Schools. New York: Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network, 2009. Web. 10 Apr. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The rights of LGBTQ youth of colour are reportedly not addressed in discussions of sexuality and race in the larger context of [[Gay Rights|LGBTQ rights]].&lt;ref name="Clay"&gt;Clay, Andreana. The Hip-Hop Generation Fights Back. 1st ed. New York: New York University Press, 2012. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brockenbrough"&gt;Brockenbrough, Ed. "Becoming Queerly Responsive: Culturally Responsive Pedagogy For Black And Latino Urban Queer Youth". Urban Education 51.2 (2014): 170-196. Journal.&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific issues primarily stem from the framework of [[intersectionality]].&lt;ref name="Terriquez"&gt;Terriquez, Veronica. "Intersectional Mobilization, Social Movement Spillover, And Queer Youth Leadership In The Immigrant Rights Movement: Table 1.". Social Problems 62.3 (2015): 343-362. Journal.&lt;/ref&gt; LGBTQ youth of colour may experience [[sexism]], [[homophobia]], [[transphobia]], [[Racism in the LGBT community|racism]], [[heterosexism]], [[white supremacy]] or [[poverty]], sometimes simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Brockenbrough"/&gt; Concerns for marginalized individuals in an already-marginalized community include [[intercultural competence]], the [[school-to-prison pipeline]], and school expulsions.&lt;ref name="GSA"&gt;{{cite web|title=GSA Network and Crossroads Collaborative,.

Activities aimed at providing safe spaces and support for LGBTQ youth of colour activities are generally held in libraries, schools, non-profit agencies and designated community spaces.&lt;ref name="Vaccaro"&gt;Vaccaro, AnneMarie, Gerri August, and Megan S. Kennedy. Safe Spaces: Making Schools And Communities Welcoming To LGBT Youth. California: ABC-CLIO, 2012. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; These activities, which provide practical sex education, mental-health support, empowerment and positive role models,&lt;ref name="Brockenbrough"/&gt; usually require state funding as HIV/AIDS prevention.&lt;ref name="Brockenbrough"/&gt;

==Activism through media==
Theater, drag shows and street theater have been used as resources for queer communities in response to LGBTQ rights, such as during the AIDS crisis in the United States during the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref name="Clay"/&gt; LGBTQ youth of colour have been using performances to tell their stories, in addition to social media, video production, blogging, and podcasting.&lt;ref name="mystoryoutloud"&gt;{{cite web|author=YTH |url=http://yth.org/mystoryoutloud-digital-storytelling-lgbtq-youth-color/ |title=#MyStoryOutLoud: Digital Storytelling for LGBTQ Youth of Color |publisher=YTH |date=2016-06-10 |accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="qwoc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qwoc.org/2013/04/amplify-true-colors-documentary-film-featuring-lgbt-youth-of-color-in-love-friendship-and-theater/ |title=[Amplify&amp;#93; True Colors: Documentary Film Featuring LGBT Youth of Color in Love, Friendship, and Theater! - QWOC Media Wire |website=Qwoc.org |date= |accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sketch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sketch.ca/bqy-creating-space-creating-history/ |title=BQY: Creating Space, Creating History - SKETCH |website=Sketch.ca |date=2015-02-10 |accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media initiatives==
There has been an increase in media initiatives to include youth who identify as members of the LGBTQ community.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/about-us/programs-and-initiatives/1067?task=view&lt;/ref&gt; Many platforms have channels which can be considered safe or welcoming for LGBTQ youth of colour.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

=== Hashtags ===
The hashtag #morecolormorepride celebrates the addition of brown and black stripes, changing the rainbow flag designed by Gilbert Baler.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Baker: The Gay Betsy Ross (video). In the Life Media. June 23, 2016. Event occurs at 2:31. Retrieved 2017-06-02 – via YouTube.&lt;/ref&gt; The stripes were added to make the LGBTQ community more inclusive and advocate against racial discrimination.
[[File:Philadelphia Pride Flag.svg|thumb|alt=Eight-color pride flag|Philadelphia City Hall pride flag]]

The hashtag #VisibleMe was created to highlight stories from LGBT youth worldwide. The hashtag was used by a diverse community on a number of platforms, including Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Many young teens shared their stories and created an Instagram channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/instagram-launches-lgbtq-channel-visibleme|title=Instagram Just Launched Its First LGBTQ Channel|last=Webster|first=Emma Sarran|work=Teen Vogue|access-date=2017-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Movements such as the #40toNoneDay raised awareness regarding youth-of-color homelessness, particularly in the LGBT community.&lt;ref name="truecolorsfund.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://truecolorsfund.org/40tononeday/|title=#40toNoneDay - Ending LGBT Youth Homelessness|author=|date=|website=TrueColorsFund.org|access-date=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sara Ramirez, who plays a bisexual doctor on ''Grey’s Anatomy'', advocates the movement to bring attention to the 40&amp;nbsp;percent of homeless youth who identify as part of the LGBT community; LGBT youth are less than seven percent of the general youth population.&lt;ref name="truecolorsfund.org"/&gt;

=== Blogs ===
Representations of, and expressions by, LGBTQ youth of colour can be found in blog posts. Author and transgender activist [[Janet Mock]] began blogging in 2010, and writes about gender, race and representation. Mock was named as one of ''Time'' magazine’s 30 most influential people on the Internet.{{cn|date=July 2018}} Her blog has a number of posts relevant to teens, ranging from bullying to the phenomenon known as [[Black Girl Magic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-is-black-girl-magic-video_us_5694dad4e4b086bc1cd517f4|title=The Meaning Of #BlackGirlMagic, And How You Can Get Some Of It|last=Wilson|first=Julee|date=2016-01-12|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-11-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black Girl Dangerous, a social-justice blog written from a QTPoC perspective, was begun by [[Mia McKenzie]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bgdblog.org/category/the-bgd-podcast/|title=The BGD Podcast Archives - BGD|author=|date=|website=BGD|access-date=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blog has featured over 300 queer and transgender writers who have contributed their voices to topics like the queer male gaming experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackgirldangerous.com/|title=Black Girl Dangerous -|author=|date=|website=Black Girl Dangerous|access-date=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With over seven million readers, Black Girl Dangerous ended its online publication on July 31, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bgdblog.org/about-bgd/|title=About BGD Press and BGD Blog|author=|date=|website=BGDBlog.org|access-date=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The social-networking site [[Tumblr]] has a number of blogs geared towards LGBT youth of colour, including Fuck Yeah Queer People of Color and LGBT + PoC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fuckyeahqueerpeopleofcolor.tumblr.com/|title=Fuck Yeah Queer People of Color!|author=|date=|website=fuckyeahqueerpeopleofcolor.Tumblr.com|access-date=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blogs provide a space for LGBT youth of colour to contact other LGBT PoC youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=16 Thought Provoking Social Justice Blogs on Tumblr|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/16-thought-provoking-social-justice-blogs-on-tumblr_us_562f8638e4b06317990f591d}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Podcasts ===
With the rise in popularity of podcasts, the LGBTQ-of-colour community has connected with one another and discussed the triumphs and issues they face. In [[Louisville, Kentucky]], Kaila Story and Jaison Gardner (two black members of the LGBTQ community) discuss a variety of topics weekly on their ''Strange Fruit'' podcast.&lt;ref name="wfpl.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wfpl.org/category/podcasts/strange-fruit/|title=Strange Fruit - 89.3 WFPL News Louisville|author=|date=|website=89.3 WFPL News Louisville|access-date=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some, such as “politics, pop culture, and black gay life", appeal to many youth.&lt;ref name="wfpl.org"/&gt; Nia King produces the podcast ''We Want the Airwaves'', which focuses on queer and transgender people of colour (particularly artists).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qtpocart.libsyn.com/|title=We Want the Airwaves|author=|date=|website=qtpocart.Libsyn.com|access-date=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, King focused on fighting oppression of this marginalized group and raising awareness of queer and transgender artists of colour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ww2.kqed.org/arts/2015/05/27/nia-kings-urgent-message-we-were-here-and-our-lives-matter/|title=Nia King’s Urgent Message: "We Were Here and Our Lives Matter"|author=|date=|website=KQED.org|access-date=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Trans Youth Equality Foundation funds a podcast, ''TransWaves'', which emphasizes education, advocacy and support for transgender youth and their families. Focusing on popularizing the trans-child movement, the podcast has interviews and anonymous advice for listeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trans Youth Equality Foundation|url=http://www.transyouthequality.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advocates for Youth ===
Advocates for Youth, an online activism and resource portal for all youth, emphasizes initiatives for  LGBTQ youth.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/|title=Advocates for Youth|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of its segments is Youth Resource, a website "created by and for gay, lesbian, transgender, and questioning young people" which encourages online peer educators to create an inclusive space. One of the most successful features of Youth Resource has been MyStoryOutLoud, a digital storytelling campaign for LGBTQ youth of colour to use technology to allow their voices to be heard and raise awareness of the need for safe spaces in communities. Using platforms such as Tumblr, Twitter and Instagram, LGBTQ+ People of Color can highlight their experiences in video or written narratives or other forms of art (including poetry and pictures).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.glaad.org/blog/vidcon-2017-lgbtq-creators-and-panels-check-out|title=VidCon 2017: LGBTQ creators and panels to check out|date=2017-06-14|work=GLAAD|access-date=2017-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another resource, Amplify (sponsored by Advocates for Youth) is an "online youth activism hub."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Advocates for Youth also has a cultural advocacy and mobilization initiative to empower youth through leadership training and encourage them to educate the community about safe spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/publications/publications-a-z/425-the-impact-of-homophobia-and-racism-on-glbtq-youth-of-color|title=The Impact of Homophobia and Racism on GLBTQ Youth of Color|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media impact==
Studies of racism, hetero- and homonormativity and positive role models for queer youth in media indicate that the lack of LGBTQ people of colour in media can affect LGBTQ youth of colour in coming out and their psychological development.&lt;ref name="Clay"/&gt; 

According to the northwestern journal of law and social policy homelessness has risen over the years in the U.S., and homelessness has been addressed providing services and programs to help homelessness youth, however, these improvements regarding homelessness have not considered the differences among this population, the LGBTQ youth of color. According to Alone Without a Home, which reviewed state by state laws affecting unaccompanied youth, one of the biggest reasons for LGBTQ youth of color homelessness is that when the person decides to open up and say how they feel, their families turn against them and do not accept them; because of this, 20% of the youth have ended up leaving their houses. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Michelle|first=Page,|date=2017|title=Forgotten Youth: Homeless LGBT Youth of Color and the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act|url=https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/njlsp/vol12/iss2/2|journal=Northwestern Journal of Law &amp; Social Policy|language=en|volume=12|issue=2|issn=1557-2447}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosario|first=Margaret|last2=Schrimshaw|first2=Eric W.|last3=Hunter|first3=Joyce|date=January 2012|title=Risk factors for homelessness among lesbian, gay, and bisexual youths: A developmental milestone approach|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2011.09.016|journal=Children and Youth Services Review|volume=34|issue=1|pages=186–193|doi=10.1016/j.childyouth.2011.09.016|issn=0190-7409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homeless LGBTQ youth of colour rely on media (such as cellphones) for jobs, Internet access, resisting police harassment and documenting police misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Post |url=https://www.slideshare.net/JessieNYC/lgbt-youth-of-color-and-mobile-technology |title=LGBT Youth of Color and Mobile Technology |website=Slideshare.net |date= |accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actress [[Laverne Cox]], a black trans woman, has supported trans-youth rights on- and offscreen. With a spot on ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''{{'s}} 100 Most Influential People List and an icon of LGBT History Month, she has used her fame and success to influence policy and increase acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/collection-post/3822970/laverne-cox-2015-time-100/|title=Laverne Cox by Jazz Jennings: TIME 100|website=Time|access-date=2017-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In speaking engagements and a documentary,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2017/09/laverne-cox-gavin-grimm-vs-transgender-lgbt-video-1201879297/|title=Laverne Cox Rallies Trans Youth in Short Doc ‘Gavin Grimm Vs.’ — Watch {{!}} IndieWire|last=Dry|first=Jude|website=www.indiewire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cox has created a dialogue for youth of colour and provided support and resources to her young transgender followers.

=== Gay and bisexual men ===
[[RuPaul]] became known for his drag-queen performances, his 1993 single "[[Supermodel (You Better Work)|Supermodel]]" and the reality-TV ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race]]''. On the show other drag queens lip-sync to remain in the competition, and it examines the issues of masculinity, male femininity, living with HIV, recovering from addiction, the transgender community and the fight for marriage equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cinema.usc.edu/archivedassets/31_2/3_Hargraves.pdf|title="You Better Work:" The Commodification of HIV in RuPaul’s Drag Race|last=Hargraves|first=Hunter|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hip hop singer and songwriter [[Frank Ocean]] released his debut studio album, ''[[Channel Orange]]'', in 2012. Days before the album's release, Ocean used [[Tumblr]] to post an open letter reminiscing about his feelings for another young man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://frankocean.tumblr.com/post/26473798723|title=Frank Ocean|website=Frank Ocean|access-date=2017-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Frank_Ocean_December_2011.jpg|thumb|alt=Frank Ocean, looking to his right|Frank Ocean]]
''Channel Orange'' received critical praise and six Grammy Award nominations. [[Def Jam Recordings|Def Jam Records]] co-founder [[Russell Simmons]] and other music-industry figures voiced support for Ocean. As one of the first openly-gay hip hop artists, he is credited with breaking barriers in hip hop and R&amp;B (which have had a history of homophobia).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2012/07/04/156261612/a-close-look-at-frank-oceans-coming-out-letter|title=A Close Look At Frank Ocean's Coming Out Letter|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-11-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kiki culture ===
Inspired by New York's underground drag ballroom culture, Kiki is a subculture of the ballroom scene (which is spearheaded by LGBT youth of colour).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gamarel|first=Kristi E.|last2=Walker|first2=Ja’Nina J.|last3=Rivera|first3=Lillian|last4=Golub|first4=Sarit A.|date=2014-07-03|title=Identity Safety and Relational Health in Youth Spaces: A Needs Assessment with LGBTQ Youth of Color|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19361653.2013.879464|journal=Journal of LGBT Youth|volume=11|issue=3|pages=289–315|doi=10.1080/19361653.2013.879464|issn=1936-1653}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less formal than the ballroom scene, it provides a space for LGBT youth of colour to express themselves through performance and allows them to meet other LGBT youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/kiki-movie-highlights-activism-young-ballroom-scene-n566446|title=Kiki movie highlights activism in young ballroom scene|work=NBC News|access-date=2017-11-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kiki culture differs from ballroom culture in its focus on political and social activism, bringing attention to LGBT issues such as homelessness and HIV.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5664">A '''morals clause''' (or '''morality clause''' or '''bad boy clause''' or '''bad girl clause''') is a provision within instruments of a [[contract]] which curtail, or restrain, or proscribe certain [[behavior]] of individuals or party(s) to the contract.

A moral clause within contracts used as a means of holding the individual or party(s) to a certain behavioral standard so as not to bring disrepute, [[contempt]] or [[scandal]] to other individual or party to the contract and their interests. It attempts to preserve a public and private image of such a party to the contract. In essence one party to the contract is purchasing the other party's good name or reputation. These clauses are most seen in contracts between [[actor]]s and actresses and their studios, [[sportsperson|athlete]]s and their organization or proprietors of a product that the athlete(s) may endorse or as a part of a marital settlement. Commonly proscribed activity include the use or abuse of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], the use of illegal drugs or [[narcotics]] or illegal or illicit [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/m/morals-clause/ |title=Morals Clause |work=uslegal.com |publisher=US Legal |accessdate=15 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The impetus for a morals clause in contracts for 'talent,' i.e., artistic performers appears to have been a reaction to the [[Fatty Arbuckle|Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle]] [[Fatty Arbuckle#The scandal|case in 1921]]. Subsequent to media outcry, [[Universal Studios]] decided to add a morals clause to contracts. The text of the 1921 Universal Studios clause read as follows: "The actor (actress) agrees to conduct himself (herself) with due regard to public conventions and morals and agrees that he (she) will not do or commit anything tending to degrade him (her) in society or bring him (her) into public hatred, contempt, scorn or ridicule, or tending to shock, insult or offend the community or outrage public morals or decency, or tending to the prejudice of the Universal Film Manufacturing Company or the motion picture industry. In the event that the actor (actress) violates any term or provision of this paragraph, then the Universal Film Manufacturing Company has the right to cancel and annul this contract by giving five (5) days' notice to the actor (actress) of its intention to do so."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|accessdate=November 22, 2013|url=http://www.nmmlaw.com/pdf/FMP%20-%20Morals%20-%20Seton%20Hall%20-%20Nov.%202009.pdf|format=PDF|title=Morals? Who Cares About Morals? An Examination Of Morals Clauses In Talent Contracts And What Talent Needs To Know |publisher=Seton Hall School of Law|journal=Seton Hall Journal of Sports and Entertainment Law |first1= Fernando M. |last1=Pinguelo|first2=Timothy D.|last2= Cedrone|volume=19 |number=2 |date=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first morals clause for a professional athlete may be a November 11, 1922 contract addendum for [[Babe Ruth]]. The clause stated: {{quote|text=It is understood and agreed by and between the parties hereto that the regulation above set forth, numbered '2' shall be construed to mean among other things, that the player shall at all times during the term of this contract and throughout the years 1922, 1923 and 1924, and the years 1925 and 1926 if this contract is renewed for such years, refrain and abstain entirely from the use of intoxicating liquors and that he shall not during the training and playing season in each year stay up later than 1 o'clock A.M. on any day without the permission and consent of the Club's manager, and it is understood and agreed that if at any time during the period of this contract, whether in the playing season or not, the player shall indulge in intoxicating liquors or be guilty of any action or misbehavior which may render him unfit to perform the services to be performed by him hereunder, the Club may cancel and terminate this contract and retain as the property of the Club, any sums of money withheld from the player's salary as above provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Grantland|url=http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7367918/being-babe-ruth-daughter|title=Being Babe Ruth's Daughter|accessdate= December 5, 2013|first=Jane|last= Leavy|date=December 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Apparently, Colonel [[Jake Ruppert]] (owner of the Yankees) had also hoped to curtail the Babe's notorious womanizing. Ruth is quoted as replying, "I'll promise to go easier on drinking and to get to bed earlier, but not for you, fifty thousand dollars, or two-hundred and fifty thousand dollars will I give up women. They're too much fun."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iYY6LBA_DUwC|page=158|title=Baseball As I Have Known It|first=Fred|last= Lieb|publisher=Cowar, McCann and Geoghagen|location=New York|year= 1977|isbn= 9780803279629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==21st century use==
{{expand section|date=September 2017}}
{{as of|August 2016}} morals clauses still exist widely for athletes, and in fact, may be invoked more quickly than in the past, as in the case of [[Ryan Lochte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/ryan-lochte-and-the-impatience-of-corporate-sponsors|title=Ryan Lochte and the impatience of corporate sponsors|work=[[The New Yorker]]|author=[[James Surowiecki|Surowiecki, James]]|date=August 23, 2016|accessdate=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nagarjunakonda''' ([[IAST]]: Nāgārjunikoṇḍa, meaning '''Nagarjuna Hill''') is a historical town, now an island located near [[Nagarjuna Sagar]] in [[Guntur district]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[India]].&lt;ref name="AHL_1938"&gt;[http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-ENG/long.htm The Great Stupa at Nagarjunakonda in Southern India]&lt;/ref&gt; It is 160&amp;nbsp;km west of another important historic site [[Amaravati Stupa]].

The ruins of several [[Mahayana]] [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and [[Hinduism|Hindu]] shrines are located at Nagarjunakonda.&lt;ref name="TRB_1993"&gt;{{cite book |author=T. Richard Blurton |title=Hindu Art |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xJ-lzU_nj_MC&amp;pg=PA53 |year=1993 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-39189-5 |pages=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of India's richest Buddhist sites, and now lies almost entirely under the Nagarjunasagar Dam. It is named after [[Nagarjuna]], a southern Indian master of [[Mahayana Buddhism]] who lived in the 2nd century, who is believed to have been responsible for the Buddhist activity in the area. The site was once the location of many Buddhist universities and monasteries, attracting students from as far as [[China]], [[Gandhara]], [[Bengal]] and [[Sri Lanka]].

Because of the construction of the [[Nagarjuna Sagar Dam]], the archaeological relics at Nagarjunakonda were submerged, and had to be excavated and transferred to higher land on the hill, which has become an island.

== Names and etymology ==

The modern name of the site originates from its presumptive association with the Buddhist scholar [[Nagarjuna]] (''konda'' is the [[Telugu language|Telugu]] word for "hill"). However, the archaeological finds at the site do not prove that it was associated with Nagarjuna. The 3rd-4th century inscriptions discovered here make it clear that it was known as "Vijayapuri" in the ancient period: the name "Nagarjunakonda" dates from the medieval period. The [[Andhra Ikshavaku|Ikshavaku]] inscriptions invariably associate their capital Vijayapuri with the Sriparvata hill, mentioning it as ''Siriparvate Vijayapure''.{{sfn|K. Krishna Murthy|1977|p=1}}

==History==

Coins issued by the later [[Satavahana]] kings (including [[Gautamiputra Satakarni]], [[Vasishthiputra Pulumavi|Pulumavi]], and [[Yajna Sri Satakarni|Yajna Satakarni]]) have been discovered at Nagarjunakonda.{{sfn|K. Krishna Murthy|1977|pp=2-3}} An inscription of Gautamiputra Vijaya Satakarni, dated to his 6th regnal year, has also been discovered at the site, and proves that Buddhism had spread in the region by this time.{{sfn|K. Krishna Murthy|1977|p=3}}

The site rose to prominence after the decline of the Satavahanas, in the first quarter of the 3rd century, when the [[Andhra Ikshvaku|Ikshvaku]] king Vashishthiputra Chamamula established his capital Vijayapuri here. The coins and inscriptions discovered at Nagarjunakonda name four kings of the Ikshavaku dynasty: Vashishthi-putra Chamtamula, Mathari-putra Vira-purusha-datta, Vashishthi-putra Ehuvala Chamtamula, and Vashishthi-putra Rudra-purusha-datta. An inscription dated to the 30th regnal year of the [[Abhira tribe|Abhira]] king Vashishthi-putra Vasusena has also been discovered at the ruined Ashtab-huja-svamin temple.{{sfn|K. Krishna Murthy|1977|p=3}} This has led to speculation that the Abhiras, who ruled the region around [[Nashik]], invaded and occupied the Ikshavaku kingdom. However, this cannot be said with certainty.{{sfn|K. Krishna Murthy|1977|p=4}}

The Ikshavaku kings constructed several [[Brahmanism|Brahmanical]] temples dedicated to the deities such as Sarva-deva, Pushpabhadra, [[Karttikeya]], and [[Shiva]]. Their queens, as well as Buddhist [[Upāsaka and Upāsikā|upasikas]] such as Bodhishri and Chandrashri, constructed several Buddhist monuments at the site.{{sfn|K. Krishna Murthy|1977|p=10}} It is believed that Sadvaha authorised the first monastic construction at Nagarjunakonda. During the early centuries, the site housed more than 30 Buddhist [[vihara]]s; excavations have yielded art works and inscriptions of great significance for the scholarly study of the history of this early period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/india/nkonda/nk01.html Ancient India: Nagarjunakonda]&lt;/ref&gt;

The last extant Ikshavaku inscription is dated to the 11th year (c. 309 CE) of Rudra-purusha: the subsequent fate of the dynasty is not known, but it is possible that the [[Pallavas]] conquered their territory by the 4th century.{{sfn|K. Krishna Murthy|1977|pp=8-9}} The site declined after the fall of the Ikshavaku power. Some brick shrines were constructed in the Krishna River valley between 7th and 12th centuries, when the region was controlled by the [[Chalukyas of Vengi]]. Later, the site formed the part of the [[Kakatiya]] kingdom and the [[Delhi Sultanate]]. During the 15th and the 16th centuries, Nagarjunakonda once again became an important site. The contemporary texts and inscriptions allude to a hill fortress at Nagarjunakonda, which was probably built by the [[Reddy dynasty|Reddi rulers]] as a frontier fortress protecting their main fort of [[Kondaveedu Fort|Kondaveedu]]. It later appears to have come under the control of the [[Gajapati Kingdom|Gajapatis]]: a 1491 CE inscription dated to the reign of the Gajapati king [[Purushottama Deva|Purushottama]] indicates that the Nagarjunakonda fortress was controlled by his subordinate Sriratharaja Shingarayya Mahapatra. In 1515, the [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagara]] king [[Krishnadevaraya]] stormed the fortress during his invasion of the Gajapati kingdom.{{sfn|K. Krishna Murthy|1977|p=9}}

The region was later ruled by the [[Qutb Shahi dynasty]] and the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]]. It was subsequently granted as an [[agrahara]] to the pontiff of the [[Pushpagiri Temple Complex|Pushpagiri Math]].{{sfn|K. Krishna Murthy|1977|p=3}}

===Archaeological research===
[[File:Division of Buddha Relics - Limestone - Circa 3rd-4th Century AD - Nagarjunakonda - Archaeological Museum - Nagarjunakonda - Andhra Pradesh - Indian Buddhist Art - Exhibition - Indian Museum - Kolkata 2012-12-21 2355.JPG|thumb|Division of Buddha Relics, Nagarjunakonda.]]
In 1926, a local schoolteacher, Suraparaju Venkataramaih, saw an ancient pillar at the site, and reported his discovery to the [[Madras Presidency]] government. Subsequently, Shri Sarasvati, the [[Telugu language]] Assistant to the Archaeological Superintendent for Epigraphy of Madras, visited the site, and it was recognized as a potential archaeological site.{{sfn|K. Krishna Murthy|1977|p=2}}

The first discoveries were made in 1926 by French archaeologist [[Gabriel Jouveau-Dubreuil]] (1885-1945).&lt;ref name="RAS"/&gt; Systematic digging was organized by English archaeologists under [[A. H. Longhurst]] during 1927-1931. The team excavated the ruins of several Buddhist stupas and chaityas, as well as other monuments and sculptures.&lt;ref name="RAS"&gt;''The Buddhist Antiquities of Nagarjunakonda, Madras Presidency'' by A. H. Longhurst. Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, Volume 72, Issue 2-3 June 1940 , pp. 226-227 [https://doi.org/10.1017/S0035869X00096921]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|K. Krishna Murthy|1977|p=2}}

In 1938, T N Ramachandran led another excavation at the site, resulting in the discovery of some more monuments. In 1954, when the construction of the proposed [[Nagarjuna Sagar Dam]] threatened the site with submergence, a large-scale excavation led by R Subrahmanyam was started to salvage the archaeological material. The excavation, conducted during 1954-1960, resulted in the discovery of a number of relics, dating from the [[Early Stone Age]] to the 16th century. Later, around 14 large replicas of the excavated ruins and a museum were established on the Nagarjunakonda hill. Some of the sculptures excavated at Nagarjunakonda are now at other museums in Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Paris and New York.{{sfn|K. Krishna Murthy|1977|p=2}}

An archaeological catastrophe struck in 1960, when an irrigation dam was constructed across the nearby [[Krishna River]], submerging the original site under the waters of a reservoir In advance of the flooding, several monuments were dug up and relocated to the top of Nagarjuna's Hill, where a museum was built in 1966 Other monuments were relocated to the mainland, east of the flooded area. Dedicated archaeologists managed to recover almost all of the relics.

Archaeological inscriptions at the site show that the [[Andhra Ikshvaku]] kings Virapurusadatta, Ehuvula and family members patronized Buddhism. The inscriptions also show state-sponsorship of construction of temples and monasteries, through the funding of the Ikshvaku queens. Camtisiri in particular, is recorded as having funded the building of the main stupa for ten consecutive years. The support also spread beyond the noble classes, many non-royal names being inscribed in the relics. At its peak, there were more than thirty monasteries and it was the largest Buddhist centre in [[South India]]. Inscriptions showed that there were monasteries belonging to the [[Bahusrutiya|Bahuśrutīya]] and [[Aparamahavinaseliya]] sub-schools of the [[Mahāsāṃghika]], the [[Mahisasaka]], and the [[Mahaviharavasin]], from [[Buddhism in Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]]. The architecture of the area reflects that of these traditions. There were other monasteries for Buddhist scholars originating from the [[Ancient Tamil country|Tamil]] kingdoms, [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]], [[Gandhara]], [[Bengal]], [[Ceylon]] (the Culadhammagiri) and [[China]]. There is also a footprint at the site of the Mahaviharavasin monastery, which is believed to be a reproduction of that of [[Gautama Buddha]].

The great stupa at Nagarjunakonda belongs to the class of uncased stupas, its brickwork being plastered over and the stupa decorated by a large garland-ornament.&lt;ref name="AHL_1938"/&gt; The original stupa was renovated by the Ikshvaku princess Chamtisiri in the 3rd century, when ayaka-pillars of stone were erected. The outer railing, if any, was of wood, its uprights erected over a brick plinth. The stupa, 32.3 m in diameter, rose to a height of 18 m with a 4 m wide circumambulatory. The medhi stood 1.5 m and the ayaka-platforms were rectangular offsets measuring 6.7 by 1.5 m.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitlordbuddha.com/cities/nagarjunakonda.htm Visit Lord Budha - Nagarjunakonda&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060104025215/http://www.visitlordbuddha.com/cities/nagarjunakonda.htm |date=January 4, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hindu ruins ===
Most of the Hindu ruins at Nagarjunakonda can be identified as [[Shaivism|Shaivite]], wherever an identification is possible. One of the temples has an inscription naming the god as "Mahadeva Pushpabhadraswami" (Shiva). Stone images of [[Kartikeya]] (Skanda) were found at two other shrines. An inscription found at another excavated shrine refers to yet another Shiva shrine. At least one temple, attested by a 278 CE inscription, can be identified as [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavite]], based on the image of an eight-armed god. A large sculpture of [[Shaktism|Devi]] has also been discovered at the site.&lt;ref name="TRB_1993"/&gt;

===Greco-Roman artifacts===

==Nagarjunakonda inscriptions==
The Nagarjunakonda inscriptions are a series of epigraphical inscriptions found in the area of Nagarjunakonda. The inscriptions are associated with the blossoming of Buddhist structures and the rule of the [[Andhra Ikshvaku|Ikshvaku]], in the period covering approximately 210-325 CE.&lt;ref name=US&gt;{{cite book |last1=Singh |first1=Upinder |title=The Idea of Ancient India: Essays on Religion, Politics, and Archaeology |date=2016 |publisher=SAGE Publications India |isbn=9789351506478 |page=45-55 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KIWTCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA45 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nagarjunakonda inscriptions tends to stress the cosmopolitan nature of Buddhist activities there, explained that a variety of Buddhist monks came from various lands.&lt;ref name=US/&gt; An inscription in a monastery (Site No.38) describes its residents as [[acarya]]s and [[thera|theriya]]s of the [[Vibhajyavada]] school, "who had gladdened the heart of the people of [[Kashmir|Kasmira]], [[Gandhara|Gamdhara]], [[Yavana]], [[North Kanara|Vanavasa]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Longhurst |first1=A.

The inscriptions are either in [[Prakrit]], in [[Sanskrit]], or a mix of both, and are all in the [[Brahmi script]].&lt;ref name=US/&gt; The Nagarjunakonda inscriptions are the earliest substantial South Indian Sanskrit inscriptions, probably from the late 3rd-century to early 4th-century CE. These inscriptions are related to Buddhism and to the [[Shaivism]] tradition of Hinduism, and parts of them reflect both standard Sanskrit and hybridized Sanskrit.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=90-91}} 

The spread of the usage of Sanskrit inscriptions to the south can probably be attributed to the influence of the [[Western Satraps]] who promoted the usage of Sanskrit in epigraphy, and who were in close relation with southern Indian rulers: according to Salomon "a Nagarjunakonda memorial pillar inscription of the time of King [[Rudrapurusadatta]] attests to a marital alliance between the Western Ksatrapas and the [[Andhra Ikshvaku|Iksvaku]] rulers of Nagarjunakonda".{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=93-94}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Majumdar |first1=Ramesh Chandra |title=Vakataka - Gupta Age Circa 200-550 A.D. |date=1986 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ. |isbn=9788120800267 |page=66 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OswUZtL1_CUC&amp;pg=PA66 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one of the inscriptions, Iksvaku king Virapurushadatta (250-275 CE) had multiple wives,{{sfn|K.

The area is also known for panoramic views of the valley from a viewing area near the dam, and is also the site of natural waterfalls, [[Ethipothala Falls]] which cascade down 22 m into a blue lagoon that is also a breeding centre for [[crocodile]]s. The nearby [[Srisailam]] wildlife sanctuary and the [[Nagarjunsagar-Srisailam Tiger Reserve]] are refuge for diverse reptiles, birds and animals.

'''Passionism''' is a [[contemporary art]] movement in [[Scandinavia]], anti-avantgarde in its approach. The term was coined by art critique [[Merete Sanderhoff]] in her work ''Sorte Billeder'' [Black Pictures] &lt;ref&gt;Merete Sanderhoff (2007): Sorte Billeder&amp;nbsp;– kunst og kanon. Rævens Sorte Bibliotek.&lt;/ref&gt; as an attempt to categorise talents outside the avantgarde canon, that did not fit into any known art category. They are referred to as the black sheep of the contemporary art scene.&lt;ref&gt;Merete Sanderhoff (2007): Sorte Billeder&amp;nbsp;– kunst og kanon. Rævens Sorte Bibliotek, p. 37ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The passionist artists are concerned with the continuation of pre-avantgarde painting traditions without turning into a repetition of these works. They are not simply postmodernists because they actually take the content and the techniques of these traditional paintings seriously. The content focuses on [[narratives]] of riddles, yearning, and solemnity. That does not mean they lack humour, but their paintings are meant to be taken seriously. There is a tendency to create very dark paintings hence the title ''black pictures''. Furthermore, they often comment on the [[doctrine]]s of the [[Modernism|modern]] and [[postmodern]] art and art theories, moving beyond these rigid constraints.&lt;ref&gt;Merete Sanderhoff. This is not a canon. Canonization and its effect on contemporary art. In Nordisk Museologi 2005/2. pp. 74-88. Abstract: ''How does canonization affect contemporary art and the definition of cultural heritage? This subject is right now topical in Denmark, where the Ministry of Culture recently issued a much debated canon of Danish culture. This article looks behind the concept of canonization and examines the structures that determine why some artists and art works are canonized, while others are disregarded. The focus of the article is a marginalized group of contemporary Danish artists, named passionists, who have deliberately chosen to oppose the prevailing standards of art production. These standards are based on the tradition of the avant-garde, which itself forms a canon within art historiography today.'' {{cite web |url=http://www.nordiskmuseologi.com/Summaries/Abstracts061.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007233653/http://www.nordiskmuseologi.com/Summaries/Abstracts061.html |archivedate=2007-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, Passionism differs from the Scandinavian's in that these Passionist artists claim their art is "born independently of the will of the artist, with no pre-planning or founding concept" (www.passionism.com). This strain of Passionism was created by Cat Moss and [[metcuc]] in May 2000, and launched to the public at the Forum de Nice in 2002 (see press and radio archive footage, Nice Matin Press and Radio FR3). It further claims to be "the first French artistic movement of the 21st Century, and the first artistic movement in the history of art to be spearheaded by women and followed by artists of all types around the globe. Passionist artists include writers, painters, photographers, poets, musicians, film directors, and fashion designers" (www.passionism.com)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39601">[[Raymond Chandler]] (1888–1959) was an American-British novelist and screenwriter. He was born in Chicago, Illinois and lived in the US until he was seven, when his parents separated and his Anglo-Irish mother brought him to live near London; he was educated at [[Dulwich College]] from 1900.{{sfn|Marling|2000}}{{sfn|McCarron|2004}} After working briefly for the British [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|Civil Service]], he became a part-time teacher at Dulwich, supplementing his income as a journalist and writer—mostly for ''[[The Westminster Gazette]]'' and ''[[The Academy (periodical)|The Academy]]''.{{sfn|McCarron|2004}} His output—consisting largely of poems and essays—was not to his taste, and his biographer Paul Bishop considers the work as "lifeless", while ''[[Contemporary Authors]]'' describes it as "lofty in subject and mawkish in tone".&lt;ref name="Gage CA" /&gt; Chandler returned to the US in 1912 where he trained to become an accountant in Los Angeles.{{sfn|Williams|2012|pp=57–57}} In 1917 he enlisted in the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]], saw combat in the trenches in France where he was wounded, and was undergoing flight training in the fledgling [[Royal Air Force]] when the war ended.{{sfn|Williams|2012|pp=67–68}}

Chandler returned to the US in 1919 to rekindle his literary career, but instead took a job with an oil company until he was fired in 1932 following a bout of depression, womanizing and heavy drinking.{{sfn|McCarron|2004}} He began writing crime stories for the [[pulp magazine]]s ''[[Black Mask (magazine)|Black Mask]]'', ''Detective Fiction Weekly'', ''The Fortnightly Intruder'' and ''Dime Detective''.{{sfn|Marling|2000}} The stories were subsequently brought together in collected editions.{{sfn|Macleod|1988|p=6}} In 1939, at the behest of the publisher [[Alfred A. Knopf, Sr.]], Chandler wrote his first novel, ''[[The Big Sleep]]'', for which he used parts of his short stories "Killer in the Rain" (1935) and "The Curtain" (1936).{{sfn|Durham|1972|p=viii}}{{sfn|Williams|2012|pp=142–43}} He went on to write seven novels, many of which featured the character [[Philip Marlowe]].&lt;ref name="Gage CA" /&gt;

In 1944 Chandler was asked by [[Paramount Pictures]] to write the script for the film ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' with [[Billy Wilder]]; the film was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]].{{sfn|Macleod|1988|pp=197–98}} It was the first of seven scripts Chandler wrote, although two of them were unused.{{sfn|Bruccoli|1979|pp=135–36}} In 1959 Chandler died of pneumonia, brought on by alcoholism.{{sfn|McCarron|2004}} In the aftermath of his death, many of his unpublished writings—including letters, literary criticism and prose and poetry—were released. His biographer Tom Williams considers that Chandler's name has become "a touchstone for crime writing, representing not just excellent fiction, but also a type of writing that is at once powerful and beautiful."{{sfn|Williams|2012|p=348}}

==Publications in periodicals and newspapers==
"The Rose Leaf Romance" and "Organ Music" are two early short stories that were included in a collection, but their first printing is unknown.{{sfn|Bruccoli|1979|p=115}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3457">A '''regional council''' (''Consiglio regionale'') in [[Italy]] is the elected legislative assembly of a [[Regions of Italy|region of Italy]]. In [[Emilia-Romagna]] and [[Sicily]], the legislative bodies are called [[Sicilian Regional Assembly]] and [[Legislative Assembly of Emilia-Romagna]] respectively.

==Origins==
The ''[[regional idea]]'' was born, in Italy, during the national [[Risorgimento]] and the first decades after the [[Unification of Italy]], but any proposal was rejected until the [[Second World War]]. After the collapse of [[Italian Fascism|Fascism]] and the end of the war a violent independence movement that led to the institution of the region and the concession of the [[autonomous regions with special statute (Italy)|Statute]], based on the model of [[federal state]]s was born in Sicily. A similar route followed [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]], [[Sardinia]], [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]] and [[Valley of Aosta]].

The other regions were instituted by the [[Italian Constitution|Constitution]] of 1948, but the first elections of regional councils were in 1970.&lt;ref name="constitution"&gt;{{cite web|title=ICL - Italy - Constitution|url=http://servat.unibe.ch/icl/it00000_.html|website=servat.unibe.ch|accessdate=May 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers==
Councils had the power to elect the president and other members ([[assessor (Italy)|assessors]]) of regional government (''Giunta Regionale''). With the constitutional reforms of 1999 and 2001, they lost these powers (because the president is elected by the people and the assessors are appointed by the president). On the other hand, the regional councils obtained a lot of new legislative powers, including the regional electoral system, which had been decided by the State.

==Electoral system==
Until the 1990s, all councils were elected with [[proportional representation]]. In order to prevent political instability, a new electoral law, called ''[[Legge Tatarella]]'', was introduced for the ordinary regions in 1995, and gradually extended with little changes to the other regions. Now, the coalition of parties that receives the biggest number of votes obtains the absolute majority of the council's seats, and its leader is elected as the President of the region. In Aosta Valley the President is elected by the council. In Trentino- South Tirol, the council is the joint session of the two provincial councils, each one with its own electoral law.

==List==
{{see also|Composition of Regional Councils of Italy}}
The 20 Italian regional councils are as follows:
* [[Regional Council of Aosta Valley]]
* [[Regional Council of Piedmont]]
* [[Regional Council of Lombardy]]
* [[Regional Council of Trentino-Alto Adige]]
* [[Regional Council of Veneto]]
* [[Regional Council of Friuli-Venezia Giulia]]
* [[Legislative Assembly of Emilia-Romagna]]
* [[Regional Council of Liguria]]
* [[Regional Council of Tuscany]]
* [[Legislative Assembly of Marche]]
* [[Legislative Assembly of Umbria]]
* [[Regional Council of Lazio]]
* [[Regional Council of Abruzzo]]
* [[Regional Council of Molise]]
* [[Regional Council of Campania]]
* [[Regional Council of Apulia]]
* [[Regional Council of Basilicata]]
* [[Regional Council of Calabria]]
* [[Sicilian Regional Assembly]]
* [[Regional Council of Sardinia]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3991">The '''SAT Subject Test in United States History''' is the name of a one-hour [[multiple choice]] [[Standardized test|test]] given on [[United States History]] by [[The College Board]]. A [[student]] chooses whether to take the test depending upon [[college]] entrance requirements for the schools in which the student is planning to apply. Until 1994, the [[SAT Subject Tests]] were known as '''Achievement Tests'''; and from 1995 until January 2005, they were known as '''SAT IIs'''. Of all SAT subject tests, United States History is taken the second most, with 119,903 administrations in 2009.&lt;ref name=SATsubjectpercentile&gt;{{cite web |url=http://professionals.collegeboard.com/profdownload/SAT-Subject-Test-Percentile-Ranks-2009.pdf |title=SAT Subject Test Percentile Ranks, 2009 College-Bound Seniors |accessdate=May 12, 2010 |format=[[PDF]] |publisher=[[The College Board]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
The test has 90 multiple choice questions that are to be answered in one hour.&lt;ref name="SAT Prep"&gt;{{cite web|title=SAT Subject Test in U.S. History Practice|url=http://sat.collegeboard.org/practice/sat-subject-test-preparation/us-history|publisher=The College Board|accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; All questions have five answer choices. Students' scores are based entirely on their performance in answering the multiple choice questions.

The questions cover a broad range of topics.  Approximately 31–35% of questions focus on [[political history]], 13–17% focus on [[Economic history of the United States|economic history]], 20–24% focus on [[social history]], 13–17% focus on [[Intellectual history|intellectual]] and [[Cultural history of the United States|cultural history]], and 13–17% focus on [[Foreign relations of the United States|foreign policy]].&lt;ref name="SAT Prep" /&gt;

The questions also vary with respect to time period; approximately 20% focus on period of the [[Pre-Columbian era]] to 1789, 40% focus on the period between 1790 and 1898, and 40% focus on the period between 1899 and the present day.&lt;ref name="SAT Prep" /&gt;

== Scoring ==
For each of the multiple choice questions, students receive 1 point for every correct answer, lose {{frac|1|4}} of a point for each incorrect answer, and receive 0 points for questions left blank. This creates a ''raw score'', which is then converted into a ''scaled score''. The conversion between these numbers varies depending on the difficulty of a particular test administration. The ''scaled score'' is the only score reported to either students or colleges and ranges from 200 to 800, with 800 being the best possible score. The [[mean]] and [[standard deviation]] of the test scores in 2009 were 599 and 115, respectively.&lt;ref name=SATsubjectpercentile&gt;{{cite web |url=http://professionals.collegeboard.com/profdownload/SAT-Subject-Test-Percentile-Ranks-2009.pdf |title=SAT Subject Test Percentile Ranks, 2009 College-Bound Seniors |accessdate=May 12, 2010 |format=[[PDF]] |publisher=[[The College Board]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation==
The College Board suggests as preparation for the test a year-long course in United States History at the college preparatory level.&lt;ref name="SAT Prep" /&gt;  The test requires understanding of historical data and concepts, [[causality|cause and effect]] relationships, [[geography]], and the ability to effectively synthesize and interpret data from charts, maps, and other [[visual media]]. However, most questions from this test are derived from/similar to the [[AP US History]] Multiple Choice questions from 2014 and earlier (the 2015 exam has been revised). By taking an [[Advanced Placement Program|AP class]], IB History of the Americas, or a class with similar rigor, the chances at doing well on this test are much improved.

== International level ==
{{See also|List of LGBT-related cases before international courts and quasi-judicial bodies}}
Several attempts have been made to establish a right to same-sex marriage at the international level through strategic litigation, at the [[Human Rights Committee]] of the United Nations and at the [[European Court of Human Rights]], both of which currently have not yet recognized an equal right to marry for same-sex couples. The Human Rights Committee case was in 1999, with two same-sex couples as the plaintiffs/petitioners and the government of New Zealand as the defender/respondent. The ECHR case, ''[[Schalk and Kopf v Austria]]'', was in 2010, with a same-sex couple as the plaintiffs/petitioners and the government of Austria as the respondents. Although both New Zealand and Austria then responded against the petitions then in each case, both countries now legally recognize same-sex unions, New Zealand in the form of same-sex marriage and Austria in the form of a registered partnership.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="550">'''Semanticity''' is one of [[Charles Hockett]]'s 16 [[design features of language]]. Semanticity refers to the use of arbitrary or nonarbitrary signals to transmit meaningful messages.&lt;ref&gt;Hockett, C. F. (1960) "[http://www.columbia.edu/~rmk7/HC/HC_Readings/Hockett.pdf The origin of speech]". ''Scientific American'', 203:2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Semantics is the meaning of words. Therefore, semanticity is its noun form.

The '''Taíno Ritual Seat''' is a [[Pre-Columbian era|Pre-Columbian]] wooden seat made in the form of a man on all fours. It was made by the [[Taíno people|Taino]] people and found in a cave near the city of [[Santo Domingo]] in the Dominican Republic.&lt;ref name="bm"/&gt; The seat was made before [[Christopher Columbus]] landed in the [[Caribbean]] and is an important remnant of the Taino culture and [[civilisation]] that existed before the arrival of Europeans.

==Description==
The seat is made from the dense hardwood called [[Lignum vitae]]. In this case the Lignum vitae is from the ''[[Guaiacum officinale]]'' tree.&lt;ref name="bm"&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/aoa/t/taino_ritual_seat.aspx Taino ritual seat] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018032430/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/aoa/t/taino_ritual_seat.aspx |date=2015-10-18 }}, British Museum, accessed 6 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This tree's flowers are the national flower of [[Jamaica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jis.gov.jm/special_sections/Independence/symbols.html |title=National Symbols |work=Emancipation &amp; Independence |publisher=Jamaica Information Service |accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The small chair is made in the form of a man on all fours. The head is decorated with gold and the figure is carved with male genitals underneath.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=651811&amp;partId=1&amp;place=27462&amp;plaA=27462-3-1&amp;page=1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance==
Duhos are carved seats found in the houses of Taino caciques or [[Paramount chief|chiefs]] throughout the [[Caribbean]] region. Duhos “figured prominently in the maintenance of Taino political and ideological systems . . . [and were] . . . literally seats of power, prestige, and ritual.”  Duhos made of wood and stone have both been found, though those made of wood tend not to last as well as the stone chairs and are, therefore, much rarer.&lt;ref&gt;Conrad, Geoffrey W., John W. Foster, and Charles D. Beeker, “Organic artifacts from the Manantial de la Aleta, Dominican Republic: preliminary observations and interpretations”, ''Journal of Caribbean Archaeology''. 2:6, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  This seat is one of two Taíno seats called ''Duho'' in the British Museum that were originally found on the island of [[Hispaniola]]. The other is also modelled anthropomorphically on a man, but in that case the resemblance to a man on his stomach is more proportional.&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Taíno of the West Indies|url=http://www.worldtimelines.org.uk/world/americas/central_meso/AD1000-1521/taino|work=World Tim Line|publisher=British Museum|accessdate=7 October 2010}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=664915&amp;partId=1&amp;place=11287&amp;plaA=11287-3-1&amp;page=1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; There is another wooden duho in the collections of the [[British Museum]] that was found on the island of [[Eleuthera]] in the [[Bahamas]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=659469&amp;partId=1&amp;place=9650&amp;plaA=9650-3-2&amp;page=1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
Some of the first people that Christopher Columbus met in the American continent were the [[Taino]] people. Their 7,000-year-old civilisation did not benefit from pre-colonial contact as many were later enslaved or died of disease. It was noted by early explorers that some of their time the Taino people were using [[hallucinogenic]] drugs. The drug and the [[Smoking pipe|pipes]] that were used are called [[cohoba]]. It is likely that one of these chiefs used this seat to smoke these drugs. The British Museum's seat has a bowl above the figures head, which may have been used to hold [[cohoba]] during rituals involving the [[Zemi]] gods.&lt;ref name=heil&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/08/canc/ho_1979.206.380.htm "Deity Figure (Zemi) Dominican Republic; Taino (1979.206.380)"] In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000 October 2006; retrieved 22 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the World==
This chair from the British Museum was chosen to be one of the [[A History of the World in 100 Objects|History of the World in 100 Objects]] which was a series of radio programmes that started in 2010 and that were created in a partnership between the [[BBC]] and the British Museum.&lt;ref name="ahotw"&gt;{{cite web|title=Taíno Ritual Seat|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/nknww6EoQO-nKTncBvhNbw Taíno Ritual Seat|publisher=BBC|accessdate=11 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Human Voice''''' ({{lang-fr|La Voix humaine}}) is a monodrama first staged at the [[Comédie-Française]] in 1930, written two years earlier by [[Jean Cocteau]].&lt;ref name=T&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|url=http://time.com/77116/locke-movie-review-tom-hardy/|title=REVIEW: Locke: Trapped in a Car, and Tom Hardy’s the Driver|author=Corliss, Richard|authorlink=Richard Corliss|date=April 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is set in Paris, where a still-quite-young woman is on the phone with her lover of the last five years. He is to marry another woman the next day, which causes her to despair. The monologue triggers the woman's crippling depression. 

In 1948, [[Roberto Rossellini]] directed the film version of the play,&lt;ref name=T/&gt; an [[anthology film]] ''[[L'Amore (film)|L'Amore]]'' which had two segments, "Il Miracolo" and "Una Voce Umana", the latter based on Cocteau's play. In 1958 [[Francis Poulenc]] composed an [[la voix humaine|opera]] to Cocteau's text. Cocteau loved it: ''"Mon cher Francis, tu as fixé, une fois pour toutes, la façon de dire mon texte'' (My dear Francis:  you have worked out, once and for all, how to speak what I have written)".  On May 4, 1967, the final installment of the television series ''[[ABC Stage 67]]'' was a production of the play, starring [[Ingrid Bergman]], who produced  a commercial recording of it. There was also a 1998 [[BBC Radio]] production by [[Robin Rimbaud]].

'''The Tiger Lillies''' are a cult British musical trio formed in 1989 by singer-songwriter [[Martyn Jacques]]. Described as the forefathers of Brechtian Punk Cabaret,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Meads|first=Glenn|title=Tiger Lillies play Queer Contact Date: 21 December 2011|url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/blackpool-theatre/news/12-2011/tiger-lillies-play-queer-contact_5887.html|work=What's on Stage|accessdate=11 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Tiger Lillies are well known for their unique sound and style which merges "the macabre magic of pre-war Berlin with the savage edge of punk".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mann|first=Tom|title=The Tiger Lillies – 20 years of deviant theatrics|url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/local/19268/The-Tiger-Lillies--20-years-of-deviant-theatrics|work=Faster Louder|accessdate=5 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307021532/http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/local/19268/The-Tiger-Lillies--20-years-of-deviant-theatrics|archive-date=7 March 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Formation and recent activity===
The band's name is rumoured to have been inspired by a murdered Soho prostitute called Lillie who used to dress up in animal print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McCall|first=Chris|title=Music Beyond The Edge: The Tiger Lillies|url=http://www.festmag.co.uk/archive/2010/99729-music_beyond_edge_tiger_lillies|accessdate=5 July 2015|newspaper=Fest|date=15 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407034230/https://www.festmag.co.uk/archive/2010/99729-music_beyond_edge_tiger_lillies|archive-date=7 April 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldsmith|first=Kenneth|title=Criminal Castrati: The Tiger Lillies|url=http://wfmu.org/~kennyg/popular/articles/tigerlillies.html|accessdate=5 July 2015|newspaper=New York Press|date=13 May 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacques, however, has stated that he named the band after a painting he had on his wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview: The Tiger Lillies|url=https://www.tigerlillies.com/news/deviant-nationcom-interview|work=Deviant Nation|accessdate=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band formed in 1989 when Martyn Jacques placed an ad on [[Loot (magazine)|Loot]] looking for a drummer and a bass player for a new band. Adrian Huge and Phil Butcher (the band's first bassist who was succeeded by Adrian Stout in 1995)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tigerlillies.com/655884/band/bios|title=Bios|publisher=The Tiger Lillies|website = www.tigerlillies.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201063509/http://tigerlillies.com/655884/band/bios|archivedate=December 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; were the only musicians that got in touch with him and therefore became the original Tiger Lillies' drummer and bassist respectively.

In Spring 2012 Adrian Huge decided to take a leave of absence and was replaced by drummer Mike Pickering who toured with the Tiger Lillies from 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tigerlillies.com/450596/news/mister-huge.|title=Mister Huge.|date=April 3, 2012|website = www.tigerlillies.com|publisher=The Tiger Lillies|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425102722/http://www.tigerlillies.com/450596/news/mister-huge.|archivedate=April 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2015 Pickering was in turn replaced by band's current drummer, Jonas Golland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Jonas Golland {{!}} Band {{!}} The Tiger Lillies|url = https://www.tigerlillies.com/band/jonas-golland|website = www.tigerlillies.com|access-date = 2016-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical style==
''[[The Independent]]'' has described The Tiger Lillies as "a provocative and avant-garde three-piece band that combines cabaret, vaudeville, music-hall and street theatre",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cripps|first=Charlotte|title=Dark Tales of the Unexpected|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/dark-tales-of-the-unexpected-77750.html|accessdate=5 July 2015|newspaper=The Independent|date=11 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Tim Arthur of [[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]] has given a more imaginative description: "Imagine Kurt Weill conjuring up images of prewar Berlin while a falsetto vocalist screams, squeaks and squawks his way through every number like some rambling madman, and you've got the picture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Arthur|first=Tim|title=Time Out Review|url=https://www.tigerlillies.com/music/the-brothel-to-the-cemetary#roll-up|accessdate=5 July 2015|newspaper=Time Out London|date=9 November 1996|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706121242/https://www.tigerlillies.com/music/the-brothel-to-the-cemetary#roll-up|archivedate=6 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Notorious for singing controversial songs involving bestiality, prostitution, blasphemy and all other vice imaginable, The Tiger Lillies are undoubtedly not for the easily offended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=D.|first=Keith|title=FRINGE REVIEW – The Tiger Lillies Live in Concert (Pleasance)|url=http://www.edinburghspotlight.com/2010/08/review-the-tiger-lillies-live-in-concert-pleasance/|work=Edinburgh Spotlight|accessdate=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cobley|first=Mike|title=The Tiger Lillies: Stories Full Of Eccentricity, Blasphemy &amp; Weirdness!|url=http://magazine.brighton.co.uk/?SEC_ID=1&amp;CAT_ID=21&amp;ART_ID=2406|accessdate=5 July 2015|newspaper=Brighton Magazine|date= 4 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Music review: The Tiger Lillies|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/music-review-the-tiger-lillies-1-766400|accessdate=5 July 2015|newspaper=The Scotsman|date=23 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their musical style is mainly influenced by [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Kurt Weill]]'s masterpiece [[The Threepenny Opera]] and pre-war Berlin cabaret but other influences such as gypsy and circus music, French chanson and British music hall tunes are also evident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fractal|first=Suicide|title=Interviews: Martyn Jacques of The Tiger Lillies|url=http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Martyn+Jacques+of+The+Tiger+Lillies/|work=Suicide Girls|accessdate=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4339">"'''The War on Poverty: 50 Years Later'''" is a report by the [[United States House Committee on the Budget|Budget Committee]] of the [[United States House of Representatives]] published on March 3, 2014. It was published in recognition of the 50th anniversary of [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s 1964 [[State of the Union address]], in which he declared "an unconditional war on poverty in America".&lt;ref name="WOPReportDocument"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://budget.house.gov/waronpoverty/|title=The War on Poverty: 50 Years Later|publisher=Budget Committee of the House of Representatives|accessdate=March 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The American Presidency Project|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=26787|publisher=University of South Carolina Beaufort|accessdate=March 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Report ==
The reports advances the argument that federal antipoverty programs suffer from defects that “penalize families for getting ahead” and that  “the complex web of federal programs and sudden drop-off in benefits create extraordinarily high effective marginal tax rates,” both of which “reduce the incentive to work”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Ryan Gets Serious About Poverty|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-03-06/paul-ryan-gets-serious-about-poverty|publisher=Bloomberg BusinessWeek|accessdate=9 March 2014|date=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the core of the report are recommendations to enact cuts to welfare, child care, college Pell grants and several other federal assistance programs.&lt;ref name="WOP_report"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mascaro|first=Lisa|title=Rep. Paul Ryan calls for cuts in anti-poverty programs|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-ryan-poverty-20140304,0,24042.story#ixzz2v8iTKEln|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=March 6, 2014|date=March 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an appendix titled "Measures of Poverty", when the poverty rate is measured by including non-cash assistance from food stamps, housing aid and other federal programs, the report states that these measurements "[have] implications for both conservatives and liberals. For conservatives, this suggests that federal programs have actually decreased poverty. For liberals, it lessens the supposed need to expand existing programs or to create new ones."&lt;ref name="WOPReportDocument"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WOP_report"/&gt; 

== Reception ==
{{expand section|date=March 2014}}
Several economists and social scientists,  Amy Finkelstein, Jane Waldfogel, Chris Wimer, [[Jeffrey Brown (professor)|Jeffrey Brown]] and Barbara Wolfe,  whose work had been referenced in the report said that [[Paul Ryan]], the committee's chairman, either misunderstood or misrepresented their research. One of the issues raised was that the report cites data from 1969 onward, and according to Waldfogel this ignores a full 36 percent of the decline in poverty using the Supplemental Poverty Measurement since 1967. &lt;ref name="misrepresented"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/03/04/Economists-Say-Paul-Ryan-Misrepresented-Their-Research |title=Economists Say Paul Ryan Misrepresented Their Research |last1=Garver |first1=Rob |date=March 4, 2014 |work=The Fiscal Times |accessdate=March 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown stated after the article's publication that Ryan quoted his research accurately, and that the ''Fiscal Times'' misrepresented his comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.economics21.org/commentary/war-paul-ryan |title=The War on Paul Ryan |publisher=Manhattan Institute |date=March 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Financial Times '' later updated the article based on Brown's comment.&lt;ref name="misrepresented"/&gt; All of the statistical errors were later corrected, and Waldfogel's criticism was fixed.&lt;ref name="WOPReportDocument"/&gt;

The '''Trans-Universal Zombie Church of the Blissful Ringing''' ({{lang-sl|Čezvesoljska Zombi Cerkev blaženega zvonjenja}}) is a contemporary religion in [[Slovenia]], founded in March 2013 and registered in the national registry of religious communities in 2014.&lt;ref name="rtvslo1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtvslo.si/mmc-priporoca/zombi-cerkev-zalitev-je-da-nam-recejo-da-nismo-vera/335694 |title=Zombi cerkev: Žalitev je, da nam rečejo, da nismo vera :: Prvi interaktivni multimedijski portal, MMC RTV Slovenija |publisher=Rtvslo.si |date=2014-04-29 |accessdate=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of late 2014, the church had over 10,000 members, making it the fifth largest religion in Slovenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.24ur.com/ekskluziv/zanimivosti/zombi-cerkev-dobila-svojo-biblijo.html |title=Zombi cerkev dobila svojo biblijo |publisher=24ur.com |date=2014-10-29 |accessdate=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/news/217235-slovenia-zombie-church-corruption/ |title='In the name of the Holy Pot': Zombie Church preaches against corruption in Slovenia — RT News |publisher=Rt.com |date=2014-12-24 |accessdate=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The religion's origins are tied to the [[2012–13 Slovenian protests]] where thousands of people protested against members of the Slovenian political elite, including the mayor of [[Maribor]] [[Franc Kangler]], the Prime Minister of Slovenia [[Janez Janša]], the opposition leader and mayor of [[Ljubljana]] [[Zoran Jankovič]], and corruption in politics in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.delo.si/novice/ljubljana/v-zivo-protesti-v-ljubljani.html |title=(V živo): Protesti v Ljubljani |publisher=Delo.si |date= |accessdate=2016-11-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161121171319/http://www.delo.si/novice/ljubljana/v-zivo-protesti-v-ljubljani.html |archive-date=2016-11-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=I.

Zombi Cerkev |publisher=Delo.si |date=2014-05-11 |accessdate=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; the former because of the ruling [[Slovenian Democratic Party]] labelling the protesters as [[zombie]]s during the people's uprising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/janseva-stranka-ne-vidi-protestnikov-temvec-zombije.html |title=SDS na Twitterju: Vstaja zombijev, ne pa vstaja naroda |publisher=24ur.com |date=2012-12-21 |accessdate=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official name was chosen using a [[Facebook]] poll and the church uses this social network for various activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sobotainfo.com/novica/globalno/zombi-cerkev-zalitev-je-ce-nam-recejo-parodija-mi-smo-zelo-resna-cerkev/97387 |title=Zombi cerkev: Žalitev je, če nam rečejo parodija. Mi smo zelo resna cerkev |language=sl|publisher=Sobotainfo.com |date=2014-12-05 |accessdate=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the church was registered in the national registry of religious communities, which, as of 2016, contains 48 churches and other religious communities.&lt;ref name="mk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mk.gov.si/si/delovna_podrocja/urad_za_verske_skupnosti/register_cerkva_in_drugih_verskih_skupnosti/|publisher=mk.gov.si|title=Register cerkva in drugih verskih skupnosti - Ministrstvo za kulturo|accessdate=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church also started gaining members in the neighbouring [[Croatia]].&lt;ref name="rtvslo1"/&gt; With more than 10,000 members, the church is the fifth largest religion in Slovenia, after the [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Islam]], [[Serbian Orthodox Church]], and the [[Lutheran Church]].&lt;ref name="delo"/&gt;

==Beliefs and activities==
[[File:Sveta maša pred hramom korupcije 5.JPG|thumb|Holy mass of the church in front of the National Assembly building]]
According to the members of the church, the theology and the rituals are not strictly defined. The members should believe in the "Bell" and that the Universe begun with a "Big Bong", which took place before the [[Big Bang]]. Among other things, the church requires members to have sex once per week and forbids planting of [[genetically modified crops]] and sexual assaults. Initially, the holy drinks of the church were [[beer]], [[piña colada]], and water, but this was later extended to include all drinks that members enjoy.&lt;ref name="delo"/&gt; The church states that it allows its members to adhere to some other religion as well but requires all members to be at least 15 years old. The church plans to officiate weddings, including same-sex marriages.&lt;ref name="delo"/&gt;

Every Wednesday, the members of the church gather around the "Temple of Corruption" (the [[National Assembly Building of Slovenia]]) for holy mass. During the mass, they use pots, pans, and bells to produce clanking sounds.&lt;ref name="yahoo1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Bojan Kavcic |url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/zombie-church-helps-slovenia-crucify-corrupt-leaders-042155991.html?ref=gs |title='Zombie church' helps Slovenia crucify corrupt leaders |publisher=Yahoo.com |date=2014-12-23 |accessdate=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the members are active in various charity activities, such as helping people without health insurance, homeless, single mothers, and in 2016 also [[Syrian refugees]].&lt;ref name="delo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Polona Krušec |url=http://svet24.si/clanek/zanimivosti/54e5bd748fbe2/slovenska-zombi-cerkev-pomaga |title=Slovenska Zombi cerkev pomaga |publisher=Svet24.si |date= |accessdate=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Posted by Teja R |url=https://glassroomglobe.com/2015/09/26/zombies-saving-refugees/ |title=Zombies saving refugees – The Glassroom Globe |publisher=Glassroomglobe.com |date=2015-09-26 |accessdate=2016-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161121045726/https://glassroomglobe.com/2015/09/26/zombies-saving-refugees/ |archivedate=2016-11-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public perception==
The Trans-Universal Zombie Church of the Blissful Ringing received a mixed reception upon formation. It has been labelled as a [[parody religion]] by a sociologist dr. Marjan Smrke,&lt;ref name="delo"/&gt; who compared it to the [[Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster]] and [[Jediism]]. He considered the role of the church positive since it acts a reflection of the problems facing the Roman Catholic Church in Slovenia. The registration of the church drew criticism from a Catholic association Zavod za družino in kulturo življenja KUL, as being an insult to the Catholic community in Slovenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.delo.si/novice/slovenija/upasana-in-zombi-cerkev-sta-uzalili-del-katolicanov.html |title=Upasana in Zombi cerkev sta užalili del katoličanov |publisher=Delo.si |date=2014-04-16 |accessdate=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Archbishop of Ljubljana, [[Stanislav Zore]], stated that the registration of religious communities falls within the responsibility of the government which has to outline clear criteria to see what constitutes a religious community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reporter.si/clanek/slovenija/nadskof-zore-ne-zelim-nic-vec-in-nic-manj-pravic-kot-jih-imajo-kristjani-drugje-po-evropi-436575 |title=Nadškof Zore: Ne želim nič več in nič manj pravic, kot jih imajo kristjani drugje po Evropi - Revija Reporter |publisher=Reporter.si |date= |accessdate=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics mentioned that a motivation for the formation of the church included avoiding the upcoming real estate tax, from which certain religious objects are exempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/nove-verske-skupnosti-so-upasana-cezvesoljska-zombi-cerkev-kairos/353243 |title=Nove verske skupnosti so Upasana, Čezvesoljska zombi cerkev, Kairos... :: Prvi interaktivni multimedijski portal, MMC RTV Slovenija |publisher=Rtvslo.si |date= |accessdate=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Ales Crnic, a cultural studies professor at Ljubljana University, stated that "[The church] is a criticism of the modern state that has been failing to fulfil its social commitments."&lt;ref name="yahoo1"/&gt;

'''Vrelo Bune''' is the natural and architectural ensemble at the [[Buna (Neretva)|Buna river]] spring near [[Blagaj]] ''kasaba'' (village-town) and a part of the wider ''"Townscape ensemble of the town of Blagaj - Historical and Natural Heritage of Bosnia and Herzegovina"'' ([[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman Mediterranean architecture]], 1520), southeast of [[Mostar]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].
It is impossible to separate the natural values from the cultural and historical heritage of [[Blagaj]], since its distinctive quality is in the coexistence of the natural and the man-made, in the integration of the physical structure into the [[landscape]].

== Vrelo Bune ==
[[File:Well of the Buna.jpg|thumb|left|A spring of Buna inside the cavern]]
The [[Buna (Neretva)|Buna river]] is a short river in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and it is a left bank tributary of the [[Neretva]] river. Its source (''[[Bosnian language|Bosnian]]'': '''''Vrelo Bune''''') is a strong [[karst]]ic spring, emerging from a huge [[karstic]] cavern beneath a high vertical cliff.
This region is specific for the diversity of its above-ground and underground [[hydrography]]. The source of the [[Buna (Neretva)|Buna river]] is the finest example of an underground [[karst]] river. It's one of the largest and most beautiful springs in Europe, producing approx. 30&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s with extremely cold and clean water.&lt;ref name="The natural and architectural ensemble of Blagaj"&gt;{{cite web|title=The natural and architectural ensemble of Blagaj |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5280/ |publisher=[http://whc.unesco.org/ UNESCO World Heritage Centre] |accessdate=2009-05-21 Tentative List of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical and Natural Heritage ==
[[Blagaj]] is one of the most valuable urban-cum-rural structures in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. [[Blagaj]] reached its peak of development in the 15th and 16th centuries, building in stone also reached its greatest extent. The first stone-built houses were the privilege of the wealthier class, but later, and lower-class families are also built sizeable stone houses and summer residences in large numbers.&lt;ref name="The natural and architectural ensemble of Blagaj"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tekke in Blagaj on the Buna Spring, the natural and architectural ensemble of Blagaj"&gt;{{cite web |title=Tekke in Blagaj on the Buna Spring, the natural and architectural ensemble of Blagaj |url=http://www.aneks8komisija.com.ba/main.php?mod=galerija&amp;action=spomenici&amp;do=view&amp;id_spomenika=1867&amp;lang=4 |publisher=[http://www.aneks8komisija.com.ba/ Commission to Preserve National Monuments of Bosnia and Herzegovina] |accessdate=2009-05-22 "Tekke in Blagaj on the Buna Spring, the natural and architectural ensemble of Blagaj" }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The natural and architectural ensemble of [[Blagaj]] forms a spatially and topographically self-contained ensemble. 
The region is also known for the diversity of its flora and a number of endemic species. At lower altitudes there are many evergreen plant and deciduous thicket species, while at higher altitudes in the hills there is sparse forest. Fertile cultivable land is suitable for the agriculture typical of the [[Mediterranean]] climate.

=== Blagaj Tekke ===
The architectural ensemble of the [[Blagaj]] [[Khanqah|Tekke]] (a [[Sufi]] lodge) stands by the source of the [[Buna (Neretva)|Buna river]], not far from the centre of [[Blagaj]].  The musafirhana (guest house) and [[türbe]] (mausoleum) are tucked into the natural surroundings, constituting a single entity with the cliffs, source of the [[Buna (Neretva)|Buna river]] and mills. The musafirhana of the [[Blagaj]] [[Zawiyya|tekke]] and the türbe have been preserved to this day. The musafirhana was built before 1664, and rebuilt in 1851 - its original appearance is not known. The building was subsequently repaired on several occasions.  The ensemble of the Blagaj Tekke was presumably built very soon after [[History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1463–1878)|Ottoman rule]] was established in [[Herzegovina]], around 1520 at the latest.&lt;ref name="The natural and architectural ensemble of Blagaj"/&gt;

=== Bridges ===
There were four bridges over the 9&amp;nbsp;km of the [[Buna (Neretva)|Buna river]], two in [[Blagaj]], one in Kosor and one in [[Buna village]]. Blagaj's bridges, the Karađoz-beg bridge and Leho bridge, differ in certain features from the typological form of 16th century [[Ottoman architecture]].&lt;ref name="The natural and architectural ensemble of Blagaj"/&gt;
* The '''Karađoz-beg bridge''' was endowed by ''Zaim hajji Mehmed-beg'', known as Karađoz, and was built before 1570, on the road to town of [[Stolac]]. The bridge has five arches, of increasing span towards the centre.
* The '''Leho bridge''' or '''Lehina ćuprija''' in Donja Mahala was built before 1664 It is assumed to have been commission by ''Haseći Ali-aga Kolaković''. It had three arches, considerably wider than those of the Karađoz-beg bridige.

=== Mills ===
[[Gristmill|Mill]] buildings on the [[Buna (Neretva)|Buna river]] are simple stone-built structures with gabled roofs clad with stone slabs, and with one or more [[millstone|mill]]s.&lt;ref name="The natural and architectural ensemble of Blagaj"/&gt;
* The '''''mills by the Tekke'''''. Very close to the source of the [[Buna (Neretva)|Buna river]], channels branch off leading water to power the [[Watermill|mill]]s. Several mills, one stamping and two fulling mills were built. There was one on each bank of the river. Part of the mill on the right bank of the river has been converted into a souvenir shop. All that remains of the rest of the structure is the stone walls.
* The mills in the '''''Velagić residential complex'''''. Part of the mill is on the bank and the greater part on the branch of the [[Buna (Neretva)|Buna river]] that flows beneath the ''Velagić residential complex''. The mill building consists of two parts, one built on dry land with a ground and an upper storey, and the other a single-storey structure built over the river spanning the two banks by means of a system of arches. The first part was the miller's living quarters, and the other contained seven mills arranged at regular intervals. Stamping [[Stamp mill|mill]]s were used for washing wool and fulling cloth.

=== Residential quarters ===
Residential complexes were entirely isolated in relationship with the outside world, so that the [[courtyard]] became the most important area of the house. These complexes consisted of several different buildings serving different purposes, standing on a plot that was entirely open to the natural surroundings and forming a single unit with the [[architecture]] of the buildings.&lt;ref name="The natural and architectural ensemble of Blagaj"/&gt;
* The '''''Kolaković house''''' is one of the most striking examples of residential [[architecture]] in [[Mediterranean]] [[Herzegovina]], and illustrates the evolution of the "[[History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1463–1878)|Ottoman Bosnian]]" house.
* The '''''Velagić residential complex''''' (www.velagomed.ba), built sometime before 1776, is a unique complex of the residential [[architecture]] of that time, with a large number of the functional components required for life. Although separated from the outside world, with a high wall enclosure, the interior of the complex is open to the natural environment and the [[Buna (Neretva)|Buna river]]. All the courtyards are interconnected and paved with river pebbles. The ''complex of the Velagić house'' is the most complete example of a family house complex with outbuildings, where the full scope of the residential lifestyle of [[Mediterranean]] [[Herzegovina]] in the past is revealed
* The '''''Kosić tower''''', as an offshoot of mediaeval residential [[architecture]], is a typical fortified house. It is stone-built and stands at the edge of the town, so it probably served some defence purpose, given that the [[Blagaj]] fort was on the other side.

According to the nomination for the list of national monuments in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]&lt;ref name="The natural and architectural ensemble of Blagaj"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tekke in Blagaj on the Buna Spring, the natural and architectural ensemble of Blagaj"/&gt; with the title "''Townscape ensemble of the town of Blagaj''", drawn up by the '''''Institute for the Protection of the Cultural, Historical and Natural Heritage of Bosnia and Herzegovina''''', the source of the [[Buna (Neretva)|Buna river]] with its cliffs constitutes a geomorphological natural monument, and the source of the [[Buna (Neretva)|Buna river]] a hydrological natural monument. [[Blagaj]]'s architectural heritage and old urban quarters (''mahalas'') indicates that buildings of major monumental and townscape value occupy a relatively confined area along the [[Buna (Neretva)|Buna river]]. Urban structures, spatial physiognomy and organization can be traced from the [[mediaeval]] outskirts of the fort, which were transformed in the [[History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1463–1878)|Ottoman period]] into a ''kasaba'' (village-town). Both [[Oriental]] and [[Mediterranean]] features are to be seen in [[Blagaj]]'s urban layout, while the settlement itself was the outcome of the influence of the natural phenomenons and configuration of the [[terrain]], as well as socio-economic relations. A perfect harmony between each buildings and its environs was achieved.&lt;ref name="The natural and architectural ensemble of Blagaj"/&gt;
