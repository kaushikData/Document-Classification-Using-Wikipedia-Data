Addiction is a disorder of the brain's [[reward system]] which arises through [[transcriptional]] and [[epigenetic]] mechanisms and occurs over time from chronically high levels of exposure to an addictive stimulus (e.g., eating food, the use of cocaine, engagement in sexual activity, participation in high-thrill cultural activities such as gambling, etc.).&lt;ref name="Cellular basis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="What the ΔFosB?" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Natural and drug addictions" /&gt; [[ΔFosB]], a gene [[transcription factor]], is a critical component and common factor in the development of virtually all forms of behavioral and drug addictions.&lt;ref name="What the ΔFosB?" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Natural and drug addictions" /&gt;&lt;ref name="G9a reverses ΔFosB plasticity" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nestler" /&gt; Two decades of research into ΔFosB's role in addiction have demonstrated that addiction arises, and the associated compulsive behavior intensifies or attenuates, along with the [[overexpression]] of ΔFosB in the [[D1-type]] [[medium spiny neuron]]s of the [[nucleus accumbens]].&lt;ref name="Cellular basis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="What the ΔFosB?" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Natural and drug addictions" /&gt;&lt;ref name="G9a reverses ΔFosB plasticity" /&gt; Due to the causal relationship between ΔFosB expression and addictions, it is used [[preclinical research|preclinically]] as an addiction [[biomarker (medicine)|biomarker]].&lt;ref name="Cellular basis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="What the ΔFosB?"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ruffle JK | title = Molecular neurobiology of addiction: what's all the (Δ)FosB about? | journal = Am.

The formation of ΔFosB in multiple brain regions, and the molecular pathway leading to the formation of AP-1 complexes is well understood. The establishment of a functional purpose for ΔFosB has allowed further determination as to some of the key aspects of its molecular cascades, involving effectors such as GluR2 (87,88), Cdk5 (93) and NFkB (100). Moreover, many of these molecular changes identified are now directly linked to the structural, physiological and behavioral changes observed following chronic drug exposure (60,95,97,102). New frontiers of research investigating the molecular roles of ΔFosB have been opened by epigenetic studies, and recent advances have illustrated the role of ΔFosB acting on DNA and histones, truly as a ''molecular switch'' (34). As a consequence of our improved understanding of ΔFosB in addiction, it is possible to evaluate the addictive potential of current medications (119), as well as use it as a biomarker for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions (121,122,124). Some of these proposed interventions have limitations (125) or are in their infancy (75). However, it is hoped that some of these preliminary findings may lead to innovative treatments, which are much needed in addiction.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="G9a reverses ΔFosB plasticity"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Biliński P, Wojtyła A, Kapka-Skrzypczak L, Chwedorowicz R, Cyranka M, Studziński T | title = Epigenetic regulation in drug addiction | journal = Ann.

Indeed, the cognitive flexibility, response inhibition, and self-regulation that appear to be hallmarks of cognitive control are noteworthy only in contrast to responses that are relatively rigid, associative, and involuntary. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive control, and particularly [[inhibitory control|inhibitory control over behavior]], is impaired in both addiction and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]].&lt;ref name="Executive functions"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Diamond A | title = Executive functions | journal = Annu Rev Psychol | volume = 64 | issue = | pages = 135–168 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23020641 | pmc = 4084861 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-psych-113011-143750 | quote = Core EFs are inhibition [response inhibition (self-control—resisting temptations and resisting acting impulsively) and interference control (selective attention and cognitive inhibition)], working memory, and cognitive flexibility (including creatively thinking "outside the box," seeing anything from different perspectives, and quickly and flexibly adapting to changed circumstances).&amp;nbsp;... EFs and prefrontal cortex are the first to suffer, and suffer disproportionately, if something is not right in your life. They suffer first, and most, if you are stressed (Arnsten 1998, Liston et al. 2009, Oaten &amp; Cheng 2005), sad (Hirt et al. 2008, von Hecker &amp; Meiser 2005), lonely (Baumeister et al. 2002, Cacioppo &amp; Patrick 2008, Campbell et al. 2006, Tun et al. 2012), sleep deprived (Barnes et al. 2012, Huang et al. 2007), or not physically fit (Best 2010, Chaddock et al. 2011, Hillman et al. 2008). Any of these can cause you to appear to have a disorder of EFs, such as ADHD, when you do not. You can see the deleterious effects of stress, sadness, loneliness, and lack of physical health or fitness at the physiological and neuroanatomical level in prefrontal cortex and at the behavioral level in worse EFs (poorer reasoning and problem solving, forgetting things, and impaired ability to exercise discipline and self-control).&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;EFs can be improved (Diamond &amp; Lee 2011, Klingberg 2010).&amp;nbsp;... At any age across the life cycle EFs can be improved, including in the elderly and in infants. There has been much work with excellent results on improving EFs in the elderly by improving physical fitness (Erickson &amp; Kramer 2009, Voss et al. 2011)&amp;nbsp;... Inhibitory control (one of the core EFs) involves being able to control one's attention, behavior, thoughts, and/or emotions to override a strong internal predisposition or external lure, and instead do what's more appropriate or needed. Without inhibitory control we would be at the mercy of impulses, old habits of thought or action (conditioned responses), and/or stimuli in the environment that pull us this way or that. Thus, inhibitory control makes it possible for us to change and for us to choose how we react and how we behave rather than being unthinking creatures of habit. It doesn’t make it easy. Indeed, we usually are creatures of habit and our behavior is under the control of environmental stimuli far more than we usually realize, but having the ability to exercise inhibitory control creates the possibility of change and choice.&amp;nbsp;...

==Behavioral addiction==
{{Main|Behavioral addiction}}
The term ''behavioral addiction'' refers to a [[compulsive behavior|compulsion]] to engage in a [[natural reward]] – which is a behavior that is inherently rewarding (i.e., desirable or appealing) – despite adverse consequences.&lt;ref name="NHM addiction-reward-reinforcement"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE |veditors=Sydor A, Brown RY | title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience | year = 2009 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | isbn = 9780071481274 | pages = 364–365, 375 | edition = 2nd | chapter = Chapter 15: Reinforcement and Addictive Disorders | quote= The defining feature of addiction is compulsive, out-of-control drug use, despite negative consequences.&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;compulsive eating, shopping, gambling, and sex–so-called "natural addictions"–&amp;nbsp; Indeed, addiction to both drugs and behavioral rewards may arise from similar dysregulation of the mesolimbic dopamine system.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Natural and drug addictions" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nestler" /&gt; Preclinical evidence has demonstrated that marked increases in the expression of ΔFosB through repetitive and excessive exposure to a natural reward induces the same behavioral effects and [[neuroplasticity]] as occurs in a drug addiction.&lt;ref name="Natural and drug addictions" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Systematic review - yet another DSM fail" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Amph-Sex X-sensitization through D1 signaling" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Amph-Sex X-sensitization through NMDA signaling" /&gt;

Reviews of preclinical studies indicate that long-term frequent and excessive consumption of high fat or sugar foods can produce an addiction ([[food addiction]]).&lt;ref name="Natural and drug addictions" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nestler" /&gt;

Gambling is a natural reward which is associated with compulsive behavior and for which clinical diagnostic manuals, namely the [[DSM-5]], have identified diagnostic criteria for an "addiction".&lt;ref name="Natural and drug addictions" /&gt; In order for a person's gambling behavior to meet criteria of an addiction, it shows certain characteristics, such as mood modification, compulsivity, and withdrawal. There is evidence from functional neuroimaging that gambling activates the reward system and the [[mesolimbic pathway]] in particular.&lt;ref name="Natural and drug addictions" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Behavioral addictions" /&gt;  Similarly, shopping and playing video games are associated with compulsive behaviors in humans and have also been shown to activate the mesolimbic pathway and other parts of the reward system.&lt;ref name="Natural and drug addictions" /&gt; Based upon this evidence, [[gambling addiction]], [[video game addiction]], and [[shopping addiction]] are classified accordingly.&lt;ref name="Natural and drug addictions" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Behavioral addictions" /&gt;

==Risk factors==
{{See|Addiction vulnerability}}

There are a number of genetic and environmental risk factors for developing an addiction that vary across the population.&lt;ref name="Cellular basis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in addiction" /&gt; Genetic and environmental risk factors each account for roughly half of an individual's risk for developing an addiction;&lt;ref name="Cellular basis" /&gt; the contribution from epigenetic risk factors to the total risk is unknown.&lt;ref name="Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in addiction" /&gt; Even in individuals with a relatively low genetic risk, exposure to sufficiently high doses of an addictive drug for a long period of time (e.g., weeks–months) can result in an addiction.&lt;ref name="Cellular basis" /&gt;

=== Genetic factors ===
{{See also|Alcoholism#Genetic variation}}

It has long been established that genetic factors along with environmental (e.g., psychosocial) factors are significant contributors to addiction vulnerability.&lt;ref name="Cellular basis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in addiction" /&gt; [[Epidemiological method|Epidemiological]] studies estimate that genetic factors account for 40–60% of the risk factors for [[alcoholism]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Similar rates of heritability for other types of drug addiction have been indicated by other studies.&lt;ref name=Kendler94/&gt; Knestler hypothesized in 1964 that a gene or group of genes might contribute to predisposition to addiction in several ways. For example, altered levels of a normal protein due to environmental factors could then change the structure or functioning of specific brain neurons during development. These altered brain neurons could change the susceptibility of an individual to an initial drug use experience. In support of this hypothesis, animal studies have shown that environmental factors such as stress can affect an animal's genotype.&lt;ref name=Kendler94&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kendler KS, Neale MC, Heath AC, Kessler RC, Eaves LJ |title=A twin-family study of alcoholism in women |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=151 |issue=5 |pages=707–15 |date=May 1994 |pmid=8166312 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?volume=151&amp;page=707|doi=10.1176/ajp.151.5.707 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the data implicating specific genes in the development of drug addiction is mixed for most genes. One reason for this may be that the case is due to a focus of current research on common variants. Many addiction studies focus on common variants with an allele frequency of greater than 5% in the general population; however, when associated with disease, these only confer a small amount of additional risk with an odds ratio of 1.1–1.3 percent. On the other hand, the rare variant hypothesis states that genes with low frequencies in the population (&lt;1%) confer much greater additional risk in the development of the disease.&lt;ref name="pmid23454283"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Clarke TK, Crist RC, Kampman KM, Dackis CA, Pettinati HM, O'Brien CP, Oslin DW, Ferraro TN, Lohoff FW, Berrettini WH | title = Low frequency genetic variants in the μ-opioid receptor (OPRM1) affect risk for addiction to heroin and cocaine | journal = Neuroscience Letters | volume = 542 | issue = | pages = 71–5 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23454283 | doi = 10.1016/j.neulet.2013.02.018 | pmc=3640707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Genome-wide association study|Genome-wide association studies]] (GWAS) are used to examine genetic associations with dependence, addiction, and drug use. These studies employ an unbiased approach to finding genetic associations with specific phenotypes and give equal weight to all regions of DNA, including those with no ostensible relationship to drug metabolism or response. These studies rarely identify genes from proteins previously described via animal knockout models and candidate gene analysis. Instead, large percentages of genes involved in processes such as cell adhesion are commonly identified. This is not to say that previous findings, or the GWAS findings, are erroneous. The important effects of [[endophenotype]]s are typically not capable of being captured by these methods. Furthermore, genes identified in GWAS for drug addiction may be involved either in adjusting brain behavior prior to drug experiences, subsequent to them, or both.

A study that highlights the significant role genetics play in addiction is the twin studies. Twins have similar and sometimes identical genetics. Analyzing these genes in relation to genetics has helped geneticists understand how much of a role genes play in addiction. Studies performed on twins found that rarely did only one twin have an addiction. In most cases where at least one twin suffered from an addiction, both did, and often to the same substance.&lt;ref name="Crowe1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crowe|first1=J.R|title=Genetics of alcoholism|journal=Alcohol Health and Research World|pages=1–11|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1993-22020-001|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cross addiction is when already has a predisposed addiction and then starts to become addicted to something different.

Environmental risk factors for addiction are the experiences of an individual during their lifetime that interact with the individual's genetic composition to increase or decrease his or her vulnerability to addiction.&lt;ref name="Cellular basis" /&gt;  A number of different environmental factors have been implicated as risk factors for addiction, including various psychosocial stressors;&lt;ref name="Cellular basis" /&gt; however, an individual's exposure to an addictive drug is by far the most significant environmental risk factor for addiction.&lt;ref name="Cellular basis" /&gt; The [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]] (NIDA) cites lack of parental supervision, the prevalence of peer substance use, drug availability, and poverty as risk factors for substance use among children and adolescents.&lt;ref name="Abuse"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/preventing-drug-abuse-among-children-adolescents/chapter-1-risk-factors-protective-factors/what-are-risk-factors|title=What are risk factors and protective factors?|last=Abuse|first=National Institute on Drug|language=en-US|access-date=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are various forms of [[child maltreatment|maltreatment]] and household dysfunction experienced in childhood. The [[Adverse Childhood Experiences Study]] by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] has shown a strong [[dose–response relationship]] between ACEs and numerous health, social, and behavioral problems throughout a person's lifespan, including those associated with [[substance abuse]].&lt;ref name=SAMHSA_ACE/&gt; Children's neurological development can be permanently disrupted when they are chronically exposed to stressful events such as physical, emotional, or sexual abuse, physical or emotional neglect, witnessing violence in the household, or  a parent being incarcerated or suffering from a mental illness. As a result, the child's cognitive functioning or ability to cope with negative or disruptive emotions may be impaired. Over time, the child may adopt substance use as a coping mechanism, particularly during [[adolescence]].&lt;ref name=SAMHSA_ACE&gt;{{cite web |title=Adverse Childhood Experiences |publisher=Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration |location=Rockville, Maryland, United States |website=samhsa.gov |url=http://www.samhsa.gov/capt/practicing-effective-prevention/prevention-behavioral-health/adverse-childhood-experiences |accessdate=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of 900 court cases involving children who experienced abuse found that a vast amount of them went on to suffer from some form of addiction in their adolescence or adult life.&lt;ref name="Enoch2011" /&gt; This pathway towards addiction that is opened through stressful experiences during childhood can be avoided by a change in environmental factors throughout an individual's life and opportunities of professional help.&lt;ref name="Enoch2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Enoch|first1=Mary|title=The role of early life stress as a predictor for alcohol and drug dependence|journal=Psychopharmacology|pages=17–31|pmid=20596857|doi=10.1007/s00213-010-1916-6|pmc=3005022|volume=214|issue=1|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; If one has friends or peers who engage in drug use favorably, the chances of them developing an addiction increases.

Statistics have shown that those who start to drink alcohol at a younger age are more likely to become dependent later on. About 33% of the population tasted their first alcohol between the ages of 15 and 17, while 18% experienced it prior to this. As for alcohol abuse or dependence, the numbers start off high with those who first drank before they were 12 and then drop off after that. For example, 16% of alcoholics began drinking prior to turning 12 years old, while only 9% first touched alcohol between 15 and 17. This percentage is even lower, at 2.6%, for those who first started the habit after they were 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alcoholrehab.com/drug-addiction/age-and-substance-abuse/|title=Age and Substance Abuse – Alcohol Rehab|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance}}
[[Epigenetic]] genes and their products (e.g., proteins) are the key components through which environmental influences can affect the genes of an individual;&lt;ref name="Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in addiction" /&gt; they also serve as the mechanism responsible for [[transgenerational epigenetic inheritance]], a phenomenon in which environmental influences on the genes of a parent can affect the associated traits and [[behavioral phenotype]]s of their offspring (e.g., behavioral responses to environmental stimuli).&lt;ref name="Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in addiction" /&gt; In addiction, epigenetic mechanisms play a central role in the [[pathophysiology]] of the disease;&lt;ref name="Cellular basis" /&gt; it has been noted that some of the alterations to the [[epigenome]] which arise through chronic exposure to addictive stimuli during an addiction can be transmitted across generations, in turn affecting the behavior of one's children (e.g., the child's behavioral responses to addictive drugs and [[natural reward]]s).&lt;ref name="Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in addiction"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vassoler FM, Sadri-Vakili G | title = Mechanisms of transgenerational inheritance of addictive-like behaviors | journal = Neuroscience | volume = 264 | issue = | pages = 198–206 | year = 2014 | pmid = 23920159 | pmc = 3872494 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2013.07.064 | quote = However, the components that are responsible for the heritability of characteristics that make an individual more susceptible to drug addiction in humans remain largely unknown given that patterns of inheritance cannot be explained by simple genetic mechanisms (Cloninger et al., 1981; Schuckit et al., 1972). The environment also plays a large role in the development of addiction as evidenced by great societal variability in drug use patterns between countries and across time (UNODC, 2012). Therefore, both genetics and the environment contribute to an individual's vulnerability to become addicted following an initial exposure to drugs of abuse.&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;The evidence presented here demonstrates that rapid environmental adaptation occurs following exposure to a number of stimuli.

Pitchers and colleagues (2010) reported that sexual experience was shown to cause DeltaFosB accumulation in several limbic brain regions including the NAc, medial pre-frontal cortex, VTA, caudate, and putamen, but not the medial preoptic nucleus. Next, the induction of c-Fos, a downstream (repressed) target of DeltaFosB, was measured in sexually experienced and naive animals. The number of mating-induced c-Fos-IR cells was significantly decreased in sexually experienced animals compared to sexually naive controls. Finally, DeltaFosB levels and its activity in the NAc were manipulated using viral-mediated gene transfer to study its potential role in mediating sexual experience and experience-induced facilitation of sexual performance. Animals with DeltaFosB overexpression displayed enhanced facilitation of sexual performance with sexual experience relative to controls. In contrast, the expression of DeltaJunD, a dominant-negative binding partner of DeltaFosB, attenuated sexual experience-induced facilitation of sexual performance, and stunted long-term maintenance of facilitation compared to DeltaFosB overexpressing group.

Cross-sensitization is also bidirectional, as a history of amphetamine administration facilitates sexual behavior and enhances the associated increase in NAc DA&amp;nbsp;...

This natural increase in delta FosB or viral overexpression of delta FosB within the NAc modulates sexual performance, and NAc blockade of delta FosB attenuates this behavior (Hedges et al, 2009; Pitchers et al., 2010b). Further, viral overexpression of delta FosB enhances the conditioned place preference for an environment paired with sexual experience (Hedges et al., 2009).&amp;nbsp;...

Understanding the pathways in which drugs act and how drugs can alter those pathways is key when examining the biological basis of drug addiction. The reward pathway, known as the [[mesolimbic system|mesolimbic pathway]], or its extension, the [[mesocorticolimbic pathway]], is characterized by the interaction of several areas of the brain.
* The projections from the [[ventral tegmentum|ventral tegmental area]] (VTA) are a network of [[dopaminergic]] [[neurons]] with [[wikt:colocalize|co-localized]] postsynaptic [[glutamate]] receptors ([[AMPAR]] and [[NMDAR]]). These cells respond when stimuli indicative of a reward are present. The VTA supports learning and sensitization development and releases DA into the [[forebrain]].&lt;ref name="Jones and Bonci"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jones S, Bonci A |title=Synaptic plasticity and drug addiction |journal=Current Opinion in Pharmacology |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=20–5 |year=2005 |pmid=15661621 |doi=10.1016/j.coph.2004.08.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These neurons also project and release DA into the nucleus accumbens,&lt;ref name="Eisch and Harburg"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Eisch AJ, Harburg GC |title=Opiates, psychostimulants, and adult hippocampal neurogenesis: Insights for addiction and stem cell biology |journal=Hippocampus |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=271–86 |year=2006 |pmid=16411230 |doi=10.1002/hipo.20161}}&lt;/ref&gt; through the [[mesolimbic pathway]].

P. |title=Pharmacology |publisher=Churchill Livingstone |location=Edinburgh |year=2003 |pages=596 |isbn=978-0-443-07145-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to their specific effects.
* The [[nucleus accumbens]] (NAcc) is one output of the VTA projections.  The nucleus accumbens itself consists mainly of [[GABA]]ergic [[medium spiny neuron]]s (MSNs).&lt;ref name="Kourrich"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kourrich S, Rothwell PE, Klug JR, Thomas MJ |title=Cocaine experience controls bidirectional synaptic plasticity in the nucleus accumbens |journal=J.

Other brain structures that are involved in addiction include:
* The [[basolateral amygdala]] projects into the NAcc and is thought to also be important for motivation.&lt;ref name="Floresco"/&gt;
* The [[hippocampus]] is involved in drug addiction, because of its role in learning and memory. Much of this evidence stems from investigations showing that manipulating cells in the hippocampus alters dopamine levels in NAcc and firing rates of VTA dopaminergic cells.&lt;ref name="Eisch and Harburg"/&gt;

====Role of dopamine and glutamate====

Dopamine is the primary neurotransmitter of the reward system in the brain. It plays a role in regulating movement, emotion, cognition, motivation, and feelings of pleasure.&lt;ref name=arch&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Volkow ND, Fowler JS, Wang GJ, Swanson JM, Telang F | title = Dopamine in drug abuse and addiction: results of imaging studies and treatment implications | journal = Arch. Neurol. | volume = 64 | issue = 11 | pages = 1575–9 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17998440 | doi = 10.1001/archneur.64.11.1575 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural rewards, like eating, as well as recreational drug use cause a release of dopamine, and are associated with the reinforcing nature of these stimuli.&lt;ref name=arch/&gt;&lt;ref name=drugs-brain&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/science-addiction/drugs-brain|title=Drugs, Brains, and Behavior: The Science of Addiction|publisher=National Institute on Drug Abuse}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all addictive drugs, directly or indirectly, act upon the brain's reward system by heightening dopaminergic activity.&lt;ref name=addict&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drugabuse.gov/infofacts/understand.html|title=Understanding Drug Abuse and Addiction|publisher=National Institute on Drug Abuse|date= November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Excessive intake of many types of addictive drugs results in repeated release of high amounts of dopamine, which in turn affects the reward pathway directly through heightened [[dopamine receptor]] activation. Prolonged and abnormally high levels of dopamine in the [[synaptic cleft]] can induce receptor [[Downregulation and upregulation|downregulation]] in the neural pathway. Downregulation of [[mesolimbic]] dopamine receptors can result in a decrease in the sensitivity to natural reinforcers.&lt;ref name=arch/&gt;

Drug seeking behavior is induced by glutamatergic projections from the prefrontal cortex to the nucleus accumbens. This idea is supported with data from experiments showing that drug seeking behavior can be prevented following the inhibition of [[AMPA]] glutamate receptors and glutamate release in the nucleus accumbens.&lt;ref name="Kalivas and Volkow"/&gt;

'''Reward sensitization''' is a process that causes an increase in the amount of reward (specifically, [[incentive salience]]{{#tag:ref|Incentive salience, the "[[motivational salience]]" for a reward, is a "desire" or "want" attribute, which includes a motivational component, that the brain assigns to a rewarding stimulus.&lt;ref name="Incentive salience and motivation review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NAcc function" /&gt; As a consequence, incentive salience acts as a motivational "magnet" for a rewarding stimulus that commands attention, induces approach, and causes the rewarding stimulus to be sought out.&lt;ref name="Incentive salience and motivation review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berridge KC | title = From prediction error to incentive salience: mesolimbic computation of reward motivation | journal = Eur.

Incentive salience takes Pavlovian learning and memory as one input and as an equally important input takes neurobiological state factors (e.g. drug states, appetite states, satiety states) that can vary independently of learning. Neurobiological state changes can produce unlearned fluctuations or even reversals in the ability of a previously learned reward cue to trigger motivation. Such fluctuations in cue-triggered motivation can dramatically depart from all previously learned values about the associated reward outcome.&amp;nbsp;... Associative learning and prediction are important contributors to motivation for rewards. Learning gives incentive value to arbitrary cues such as a Pavlovian conditioned stimulus (CS) that is associated with a reward (unconditioned stimulus or UCS). Learned cues for reward are often potent triggers of desires. For example, learned cues can trigger normal appetites in everyone, and can sometimes trigger compulsive urges and relapse in addicts.&lt;br /&gt;Cue-triggered ‘wanting’ for the UCS&lt;br /&gt;A brief CS encounter (or brief UCS encounter) often primes a pulse of elevated motivation to obtain and consume more reward UCS. This is a signature feature of incentive salience.&lt;br /&gt;Cue as attractive motivational magnets&lt;br /&gt;When a Pavlovian CS+ is attributed with incentive salience it not only triggers ‘wanting’ for its UCS, but often the cue itself becomes highly attractive – even to an irrational degree. This cue attraction is another signature feature of incentive salience&amp;nbsp;... Two recognizable features of incentive salience are often visible that can be used in neuroscience experiments: (i) UCS-directed ‘wanting’ – CS-triggered pulses of intensified ‘wanting’ for the UCS reward; and (ii) CS-directed ‘wanting’ – motivated attraction to the Pavlovian cue, which makes the arbitrary CS stimulus into a motivational magnet.}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}}) that is assigned by the brain to a rewarding stimulus (e.g., a drug).

This organization of the DA system, wide projection from a limited number of cell bodies, permits coordinated responses to potent new rewards. Thus, acting in diverse terminal fields, dopamine confers motivational salience ("wanting") on the reward itself or associated cues (nucleus accumbens shell region), updates the value placed on different goals in light of this new experience (orbital prefrontal cortex), helps consolidate multiple forms of memory (amygdala and hippocampus), and encodes new motor programs that will facilitate obtaining this reward in the future (nucleus accumbens core region and dorsal striatum). In this example, dopamine modulates the processing of sensorimotor information in diverse neural circuits to maximize the ability of the organism to obtain future rewards.&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;The brain reward circuitry that is targeted by addictive drugs normally mediates the pleasure and strengthening of behaviors associated with natural reinforcers, such as food, water, and sexual contact. Dopamine neurons in the VTA are activated by food and water, and dopamine release in the NAc is stimulated by the presence of natural reinforcers, such as food, water, or a sexual partner.&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;The NAc and VTA are central components of the circuitry underlying reward and memory of reward. As previously mentioned, the activity of dopaminergic neurons in the VTA appears to be linked to reward prediction. The NAc is involved in learning associated with reinforcement and the modulation of motoric responses to stimuli that satisfy internal homeostatic needs. The shell of the NAc appears to be particularly important to initial drug actions within reward circuitry; addictive drugs appear to have a greater effect on dopamine release in the shell than in the core of the NAc.&amp;nbsp;... If motivational drive is described in terms of wanting, and hedonic evaluation in terms of liking, it appears that wanting can be dissociated from liking and that dopamine may influence these phenomena differently. Differences between wanting and liking are confirmed in reports by human addicts, who state that their desire for drugs (wanting) increases with continued use even when pleasure (liking) decreases because of tolerance.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Incentive salience and motivation review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reinforcement in addiction" /&gt; Reward sensitization normally occurs following chronically high levels of exposure to the stimulus.

-Should probably mention the following since it's related to both the mechanisms and research sections: 
1) Prolonged inhibition of class I HDACs results in histone hyper-acetylation, which in turn increases G9a expression and H3K9me2 synthesis
2) G9a catalyzes H3K9 dimethylation (H3K9me2 synthesis)
3) H3K9me2 is a repressive epigenetic mark that inhibits the induction of DeltaFosB in the NAcc by preventing transcription of the FosB gene
i.e., +HDACi → ↑ H3 acetylation &amp; ↑H4 acetylation → ↑G9a → ↑H3K9me2 synthesis
4) The feedback loop involving: +drug → ↑ΔFosB → ↓G9a → ↓H3K9me2 → ↑ΔFosB

==Diagnosis==

The 5th edition of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-5) uses the term "Substance Use Disorder" to refer to a spectrum of use-related conditions.  The DSM-5 eliminates the terms "abuse" and "dependence" from diagnostic categories, instead using the specifiers of "mild", "moderate" and "severe" to indicate the extent of disordered use.  Specifiers are determined by the number of diagnostic criteria present in a given case. The manual has never actually used the term "addiction" clinically.&lt;ref name="Addiction-dependence distinction" /&gt; Currently, only drug addictions and gambling addiction are listed in the {{nowrap|[[DSM-5]]}}.  Past editions have used [[physical dependence]] and the associated withdrawal syndrome to identify an addictive state. [[Physical dependence]] occurs when the body has adjusted by incorporating the substance into its "normal" functioning – i.e., attains [[homeostasis]] – and therefore physical withdrawal symptoms occur upon cessation of use.&lt;ref name="pmid10511013"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Torres G, Horowitz JM | title = Drugs of abuse and brain gene expression | journal = Psychosom Med | volume = 61 | issue = 5 | pages = 630–50 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10511013 | doi =  10.1097/00006842-199909000-00007| citeseerx = 10.1.1.326.4903 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tolerance is the process by which the body continually adapts to the substance and requires increasingly larger amounts to achieve the original effects. Withdrawal refers to physical and psychological symptoms experienced when  reducing or discontinuing a substance that the body has become dependent on. Symptoms of withdrawal generally include but are not limited to [[anxiety]], [[irritability]], intense [[craving (withdrawal)|cravings]] for the substance, [[nausea]], [[hallucinations]], [[headaches]], cold sweats, and [[tremor]]s.

Medical researchers who actively study addiction have criticized the DSM classification of addiction for being flawed and involving arbitrary diagnostic criteria.&lt;ref name="NHMH_3e terms-DSM flaw"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE, Holtzman DM | title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience | year = 2015 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | isbn = 9780071827706 | edition = 3rd | chapter = Chapter 16: Reinforcement and Addictive Disorders | quote = The official diagnosis of drug addiction by the Diagnostic and Statistic Manual of Mental Disorders (2013), which uses the term substance use disorder, is flawed. Criteria used to make the diagnosis of substance use disorders include tolerance and somatic dependence/withdrawal, even though these processes are not integral to addiction as noted. It is ironic and unfortunate that the manual still avoids use of the term addiction as an official diagnosis, even though addiction provides the best description of the clinical syndrome.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 2013, the director of the United States [[National Institute of Mental Health]] discussed the invalidity of the DSM-5's classification of mental disorders:&lt;ref name="DSM-V Insel"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Thomas Insel|title=Transforming Diagnosis|url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-diagnosis.shtml|publisher=National Institute of Mental Health|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt; While DSM has been described as a "Bible" for the field, it is, at best, a dictionary, creating a set of labels and defining each. The strength of each of the editions of DSM has been "reliability" – each edition has ensured that clinicians use the same terms in the same ways. The weakness is its lack of validity. Unlike our definitions of ischemic heart disease, lymphoma, or AIDS, the DSM diagnoses are based on a consensus about clusters of clinical symptoms, not any objective laboratory measure. In the rest of medicine, this would be equivalent to creating diagnostic systems based on the nature of chest pain or the quality of fever.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Most recently, though, the NIH acknowledged advances in identifying biomarkers, noting they outperform traditional phenomenological categories in identifying types of psychosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biomarkers outperform symptoms in parsing psychosis subgroups|url=https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/biomarkers-outperform-symptoms-parsing-psychosis-subgroups|publisher=National Institutes of Health|accessdate=20 May 2016|date=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid26651391"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Clementz BA, Sweeney JA, Hamm JP, Ivleva EI, Ethridge LE, Pearlson GD, Keshavan MS, Tamminga CA | title = Identification of Distinct Psychosis Biotypes Using Brain-Based Biomarkers | journal = Am J Psychiatry | volume = 173 | issue = 4 | pages = 373–84 | year = 2016 | pmid = 26651391 | pmc = 5314432 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.2015.14091200 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a diagnostic [[biomarker (medicine)|biomarker]], [[ΔFosB]] expression could be used to diagnose an addiction in humans, but this would require a [[brain biopsy]] and therefore is not used in clinical practice.

==Treatment==
{{see also|Addiction recovery groups|Cognitive behavioral therapy|Drug rehabilitation}}
According to a review, "in order to be effective, all pharmacological or biologically based treatments for addiction need to be integrated into other established forms of addiction rehabilitation, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, individual and group psychotherapy, behavior-modification strategies, twelve-step programs, and residential treatment facilities."&lt;ref name="Reward system and psychostimulants" /&gt;

===Behavioral therapy===
A meta-analytic review on the efficacy of various [[Behavioral therapy|behavioral therapies]] for treating drug and behavioral addictions found that [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (e.g., [[relapse prevention]] and [[contingency management]]), [[motivational interviewing]], and a [[Community reinforcement approach and family training|community reinforcement approach]] were effective interventions with moderate effect sizes.&lt;ref name="German meta-analysis"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Walter M, Dürsteler KM, Petitjean SA, Wiesbeck GA, Euler S, Sollberger D, Lang UE, Vogel M | title = [Psychosocial Treatment of Addictive Disorders—An Overview of Psychotherapeutic Options and their Efficacy] | language = German | journal = Fortschr Neurol Psychiatr | volume = 83 | issue = 4 | pages = 201–210 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25893493 | doi = 10.1055/s-0034-1399338 | quote = Addictive disorders are chronic relapsing conditions marked by compulsive and often uncontrolled use of psychotropic substances or stimuli.

For these psychotherapeutic treatments, mostly moderate effect sizes have been found. Their effectiveness seems to be highest in cannabis dependence. Empirical evidence for dependence on "hard" drugs is largest for contingency management, while for alcohol dependence motivational interviewing and the community reinforcement approach show the largest effect sizes. Presumably, combinations of different approaches as well as online interventions will bring further progress in the psychosocial treatment of addictive disorders in the future.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinical and preclinical evidence indicate that consistent aerobic exercise, especially endurance exercise (e.g., [[marathon running]]), actually prevents the development of certain [[drug addiction]]s and is an effective adjunct treatment for drug addiction, and for psychostimulant addiction in particular.&lt;ref name="Natural and drug addictions" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Addiction review 2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carroll ME, Smethells JR | title = Sex Differences in Behavioral Dyscontrol: Role in Drug Addiction and Novel Treatments | journal = Front.

===Medication===

====Alcohol addiction====
{{further|Alcoholism}}
Alcohol, like opioids, can induce a severe state of [[physical dependence]] and produce withdrawal symptoms such as [[delirium tremens]]. Because of this, treatment for alcohol addiction usually involves a combined approach dealing with dependence and addiction simultaneously.

Pharmacological treatments for alcohol addiction include drugs like [[naltrexone]] (opioid antagonist), [[disulfiram]], [[acamprosate]], and [[topiramate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Soyka M, Roesner S | title = New pharmacological approaches for the treatment of alcoholism | journal = Expert Opinion on Pharmacotherapy | volume = 7 | issue = 17 | pages = 2341–53 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17109610 | doi = 10.1517/14656566.7.17.2341 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pettinati HM, Rabinowitz AR | title = Choosing the right medication for the treatment of alcoholism | journal = Current Psychiatry Reports | volume = 8 | issue = 5 | pages = 383–8 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 16968619 | doi = 10.1007/s11920-006-0040-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than substituting for alcohol, these drugs are intended to affect the desire to drink, either by directly reducing cravings as with acamprosate and topiramate, or by producing unpleasant effects when alcohol is consumed, as with disulfiram.

====Opioid addiction====

Physical dependence is treated using replacement drugs such as [[suboxone]] or [[subutex]] (both containing the active ingredients [[buprenorphine]]) and [[methadone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Johnson RE, Chutuape MA, Strain EC, Walsh SL, Stitzer ML, Bigelow GE |title=A comparison of levomethadyl acetate, buprenorphine, and methadone for opioid dependence |journal=N.

====Psychostimulant addiction====
{{As of|May 2014}}, there is no effective [[pharmacotherapy]] for any form of psychostimulant addiction.&lt;ref name="Reward system and psychostimulants"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Taylor SB, Lewis CR, Olive MF | title = The neurocircuitry of illicit psychostimulant addiction: acute and chronic effects in humans | journal = Subst.

At present, no pharmacological therapy has been approved by the FDA to treat psychostimulant addiction. Many drugs have been tested, but none have shown conclusive efficacy with tolerable side effects in humans.&lt;sup&gt;172&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;...&lt;!--These drugs have included DA-receptor ligands, such as DA receptor agonists, partial agonists, and antagonists, as well as DA-reuptake inhibitors.&lt;sup&gt;173,174&lt;/sup&gt; One newer dopaminergic drug that has shown some promise is the antipsychotic medication aripiprazole, a partial agonist at D2-like receptors, which is currently approved for the treatment of schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder.&lt;sup&gt;175&lt;/sup&gt; Clinical trials have thus far been mixed, with one study finding reduced cocaine craving and use, and another study showing increased cocaine use.&lt;sup&gt;176,177&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;...

Recent evidence for dysregulation of glutamatergic signaling in addiction has led to the testing of N-acetylcysteine, a derivative of the amino acid cysteine that normalizes extracellular levels of Glu following cocaine administration.&lt;sup&gt;178,179&lt;/sup&gt; Clinical trials found that N-acetylcysteine treatment attenuates cocaine craving and use and normalizes brain glutamate levels.&lt;sup&gt;180–182&lt;/sup&gt; Other recent studies found trends toward significant reductions in METH use and craving produced by the antidepressant buproprion and the anticonvulsant topiramate, which has glutamate release-inhibiting properties.&lt;sup&gt;183,184&lt;/sup&gt; While these compounds have not demonstrated overwhelming efficacy in reducing psychostimulant use or craving in all subjects tested, trends toward effects were observed and thus merit further investigation.

Other compounds that have been tested, with disappointing results, include β-adrenergic antagonists, opioid-receptor antagonists, 5-HT3-receptor antagonists, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants.&lt;sup&gt;172,185–190&lt;/sup&gt; Despite the lack of past successes, several newer medications are currently being investigated and have shown some initial success, such as the smoking-cessation aid varenicline, the α2 adrenergic agonist clonidine, and the antidepressant mirtazapine.&lt;sup&gt;191–194&lt;/sup&gt; In addition, preclinical evidence strongly suggests potential therapeutic effects of compounds targeting receptors for endocannabinoids, the neuropeptide orexin, and CRF for the prevention of relapse to psychostimulant use.&lt;sup&gt;195–197&lt;/sup&gt;

Future approaches for the treatment of psychostimulant-induced cognitive deficits and dependence include the use of cognitive enhancers.&lt;sup&gt;198–200&lt;/sup&gt; Two promising examples include prescription stimulants, such as modafinil and methylphenidate, which have shown modest but potential treatment effects in METH users and cocaine users with comorbid attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, respectively.&lt;sup&gt;201–205&lt;/sup&gt; In addition, galantamine, a cholinergic modulator and cognitive enhancer, has been reported to both decrease cocaine use and improve sustained attention in dependent subjects.&lt;sup&gt;206,207&lt;/sup&gt; Together, these studies indicate that clinical trials of cognitive enhancers in the treatment of psychostimulant addiction are warranted. In addition to the pharmacological trials reviewed above, less conventional strategies that are gaining scientific momentum include vaccine therapies to immunoneutralize drug molecules and impede penetrance across the blood–brain barrier, enzyme conjugates that dramatically increase the metabolic breakdown of abused drugs, pharmacogenetic approaches based on individual genetic polymorphisms in addiction-related genes, and epigenetic modulators of drug-induced changes in gene expression.&lt;sup&gt;208–211&lt;/sup&gt; While still in their relative infancy, these exciting new avenues of research offer a significant expansion of possible biologically based targets for the treatment of psychostimulant addiction.&amp;nbsp;...

The tremendous need for more effective pharmacological treatments for psychostimulant addiction is a mainstay of contemporary addiction research. However, the recent downsizing of many major pharmaceutical companies away from psychiatric indications (including addiction) due to the lack of efficacy of experimental compounds in humans may require a sea change in the translational research approach.&lt;sup&gt;212,213&lt;/sup&gt; --&gt; A new emphasis on larger-scale biomarker, genetic, and epigenetic research focused on the molecular targets of mental disorders has been recently advocated.&lt;sup&gt;212&lt;/sup&gt; In addition, the integration of cognitive and behavioral modification of circuit-wide neuroplasticity (ie, computer-based training to enhance executive function) may prove to be an effective adjunct-treatment approach for addiction, particularly when combined with cognitive enhancers.&lt;sup&gt;198,213–216&lt;/sup&gt; Furthermore, in order to be effective, all pharmacological or biologically based treatments for addiction need to be integrated into other established forms of addiction rehabilitation, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, individual and group psychotherapy, behavior-modification strategies, twelve-step programs, and residential treatment facilities.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid24716825"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stoops WW, Rush CR | title = Combination pharmacotherapies for stimulant use disorder: a review of clinical findings and recommendations for future research | journal = Expert Rev Clin Pharmacol | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 363–374 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24716825 | doi = 10.1586/17512433.2014.909283 | quote = Despite concerted efforts to identify a pharmacotherapy for managing stimulant use disorders, no widely effective medications have been approved. | pmc=4017926}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cochrane 2013 treatments"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Perez-Mana C, Castells X, Torrens M, Capella D, Farre M | title = Efficacy of psychostimulant drugs for amphetamine abuse or dependence | journal = Cochrane Database Syst.

Genetic or pharmacological blockade of G9a in the NAc potentiates behavioral responses to cocaine and opiates, whereas increasing G9a function exerts the opposite effect (Maze et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2012a). Such drug-induced downregulation of G9a and H3K9me2 also sensitizes animals to the deleterious effects of subsequent chronic stress (Covington et al., 2011). Downregulation of G9a increases the dendritic arborization of NAc neurons, and is associated with increased expression of numerous proteins implicated in synaptic function, which directly connects altered G9a/H3K9me2 in the synaptic plasticity associated with addiction (Maze et al., 2010).&lt;br /&gt;G9a appears to be a critical control point for epigenetic regulation in NAc, as we know it functions in two negative feedback loops. It opposes the induction of ΔFosB, a long-lasting transcription factor important for drug addiction (Robison and Nestler, 2011), while ΔFosB in turn suppresses G9a expression (Maze et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2012a).&amp;nbsp;... Also, G9a is induced in NAc upon prolonged HDAC inhibition, which explains the paradoxical attenuation of cocaine's behavioral effects seen under these conditions, as noted above (Kennedy et al., 2013). GABAA receptor subunit genes are among those that are controlled by this feedback loop. Thus, chronic cocaine, or prolonged HDAC inhibition, induces several GABAA receptor subunits in NAc, which is associated with increased frequency of inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs). In striking contrast, combined exposure to cocaine and HDAC inhibition, which triggers the induction of G9a and increased global levels of H3K9me2, leads to blockade of GABAA receptor and IPSC regulation. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Amphetamine epigenetics"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McCowan TJ, Dhasarathy A, Carvelli L | title = The Epigenetic Mechanisms of Amphetamine | journal = J.

Importantly, some studies have also correlated the epigenetic regulation induced by AMPH with the behavioral outcomes caused by this drug, suggesting therefore that epigenetics remodeling underlies the behavioral changes induced by AMPH.

The effects of pharmacological inhibition of HDACs on psychostimulant-induced plasticity appear to depend on the timecourse of HDAC inhibition.

The clustering of seemingly discrepant results based on experimental methodologies is interesting in light of our present findings. Both HDAC inhibitors and psychostimulants increase global levels of histone acetylation in NAc. Thus, when co-administered acutely, these drugs may have synergistic effects, leading to heightened transcriptional activation of psychostimulant-regulated target genes. In contrast, when a psychostimulant is given in the context of prolonged, HDAC inhibitor-induced hyperacetylation, homeostatic processes may direct AcH3 binding to the promoters of genes (e.g., G9a) responsible for inducing chromatin condensation and gene repression (e.g., via H3K9me2) in order to dampen already heightened transcriptional activation. Our present findings thus demonstrate clear cross talk among histone PTMs and suggest that decreased behavioral sensitivity to psychostimulants following prolonged HDAC inhibition might be mediated through decreased activity of HDAC1 at H3K9 KMT promoters and subsequent increases in H3K9me2 and gene repression.}}&lt;br /&gt;{{bull}}{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Simon-O'Brien E, Alaux-Cantin S, Warnault V, Buttolo R, Naassila M, Vilpoux C | title = The histone deacetylase inhibitor sodium butyrate decreases excessive ethanol intake in dependent animals | journal = Addict Biol | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | pages = 676–689 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 25041570 | doi = 10.1111/adb.12161 | quote = Altogether, our results clearly demonstrated the efficacy of {{abbr|NaB|sodium butyrate}} in preventing excessive ethanol intake and relapse and support the hypothesis that {{abbr|HDACi|HDAC inhibitors}} may have a potential use in alcohol addiction treatment.}}&lt;br /&gt;{{bull}}{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Castino MR, Cornish JL, Clemens KJ | title = Inhibition of histone deacetylases facilitates extinction and attenuates reinstatement of nicotine self-administration in rats | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = e0124796 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25880762 | pmc = 4399837 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0124796 | quote = treatment with NaB significantly attenuated nicotine and nicotine + cue reinstatement when administered immediately&amp;nbsp;...

Due to cultural variations, the proportion of individuals who develop a drug or behavioral addiction within a specified time period (i.e., the [[prevalence]]) varies over time, by country, and across national [[demographics|population demographics]] (e.g., by age group, socioeconomic status, etc.).&lt;ref name="Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in addiction" /&gt;

In 2014, 22.5 million people in the United States needed treatment for addiction involving alcohol or drugs other than nicotine, but only 11.6 percent received any form of inpatient, residential, or outpatient treatment. Of those who do receive treatment, few receive evidence-based care. (There is no information available on how many individuals receive treatment for addiction involving nicotine.)&lt;br /&gt;Risky substance use and untreated addiction account for one-third of inpatient hospital costs and 20 percent of all deaths in the United States each year, and cause or contribute to more than 100 other conditions requiring medical care, as well as vehicular crashes, other fatal and non-fatal injuries, overdose deaths, suicides, homicides, domestic discord, the highest incarceration rate in the world and many other costly social consequences.

A major milestone was reached on March 14, 2016, when the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) formally announced recognition of the field of Addiction Medicine as a medical subspecialty.&amp;nbsp;... In a statement issued to mark this milestone, ABAM President Robert J. Sokol summed up its significance: 'This landmark event, more than any other, recognizes addiction as a preventable and treatable disease, helping to shed the stigma that has long plagued it. It sends a strong message to the public that American medicine is committed to providing expert care for this disease and services designed to prevent the risky substance use that precedes it.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; One-third of [[inpatient care|inpatient]] hospital costs and 20% of all deaths in the US every year are the result of untreated addictions and risky substance use.&lt;ref name="ABAM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NIDA Addiction Medicine" /&gt; In spite of the massive overall economic cost to society, which is greater than the cost of [[diabetes]] and all forms of [[cancer]] combined, most doctors in the US lack the training to effectively address a drug addiction.&lt;ref name="ABAM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NIDA Addiction Medicine" /&gt;

Existing prevalence rates of sexual addiction-related disorders range from 3% to 6%. Sexual addiction/hypersexual disorder is used as an umbrella construct to encompass various types of problematic behaviors, including excessive masturbation, cybersex, pornography use, sexual behavior with consenting adults, telephone sex, strip club visitation, and other behaviors. The adverse consequences of sexual addiction are similar to the consequences of other addictive disorders. Addictive, somatic and psychiatric disorders coexist with sexual addiction. In recent years, research on sexual addiction has proliferated, and screening instruments have increasingly been developed to diagnose or quantify sexual addiction disorders. In our systematic review of the existing measures, 22 questionnaires were identified. As with other behavioral addictions, the appropriate treatment of sexual addiction should combine pharmacological and psychological approaches.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality theories of addiction==
{{Main|Personality theories of addiction}}
[[Personality theories of addiction]] are [[psychology|psychological]] models that associate [[personality traits]] or modes of thinking (i.e., [[Affective science|affective states]]) with an individual's proclivity for developing an addiction.  Models of addiction risk that have been proposed in psychology literature include an [[affect dysregulation]] model of positive and negative [[psychological affect]]s, the [[reinforcement sensitivity theory]] model of [[impulsiveness]] and behavioral inhibition, and an impulsivity model of [[reward sensitization]] and impulsiveness.&lt;ref name="Cheetham_2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cheetham A, Allen NB, Yücel M, Lubman DI | title = The role of affective dysregulation in drug addiction | journal = Clin Psychol Rev | volume = 30 | issue = 6 | pages = 621–34 |date=August 2010| pmid = 20546986 | doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2010.04.005 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Franken_2006&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Franken IH, Muris P | title = BIS/BAS personality characteristics and college students' substance use|journal=Personality and Individual Differences | year = 2006 | volume = 40 | issue = 7 | pages = 1497–1503 | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2005.12.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18232522"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Genovese JE, Wallace D | title = Reward sensitivity and substance abuse in middle school and high school students | journal = J Genet Psychol | volume = 168 | issue = 4 | pages = 465–9 |date=December 2007| pmid = 18232522 | doi = 10.3200/GNTP.168.4.465-469 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kimbrel_2007&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kimbrel NA, Nelson-Gray RO, Mitchell JT | title = Reinforcement sensitivity and maternal style as predictors of psychopathology | journal = Personality and Individual Differences |date=April 2007| volume = 42 | issue = 6 | pages = 1139–1149 | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2006.06.028 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawe"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dawe S, Loxton NJ | title = The role of impulsivity in the development of substance use and eating disorders | journal = Neurosci Biobehav Rev | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 343–51 |date=May 2004| pmid = 15225976 | doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2004.03.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4294">'''Anglophone Cameroonians''' are the people of various cultural backgrounds who hail from the [[English language|English-speaking]] regions of [[Cameroon]] ([[Northwest Region (Cameroon)|Northwest]] and [[Southwest Region (Cameroon)|Southwest]] regions). These regions were formerly known as British [[Southern Cameroons]], being part of the [[League of Nations mandate]] and [[United Nations Trust Territories]].

The two English-speaking regions of Cameroon make up 17% of a population of 17 million (2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} http://www.statistics-cameroon.org/downloads/Rapport_de_presentation_3_RGPH.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political representation==
The [[Social Democratic Front (Cameroon)|Social Democratic Front]], the largest opposition political party in Cameroon's parliament, is headed by an Anglophone. Separatist movements, notably the [[Southern Cameroons National Council]] (SCNC) and the [[Southern Cameroons Peoples Organization]] (SCAPO), call for the separation of the two English-speaking regions from French-speaking Cameroun in response to the dismantling in May 1972 of the federation formed in 1961 and subsequent marginalization of the Anglophone minority by the Francophone majority and its political leadership. As of March 2017, only one of the 36 government ministers who control departmental budgets is an Anglophone.&lt;ref name="WP"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Foretia|first1=Denis|last2=Foretia|first2=Denis|title=Cameroon continues its oppression of English speakers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/global-opinions/wp/2017/03/21/cameroon-continues-its-oppression-of-english-speakers/|website=The Washington Post|accessdate=15 May 2017|date=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2016–2017 protests and government response==
In November 2016, after a law was not translated, Anglophone lawyers began a protest in [[Bamenda]] against the central government for failing to uphold the constitutional guarantee of a bilingual nation.&lt;ref name="TNYT"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Essomba|first1=Francois|last2=Searcey|first2=Dionne|title=A Bilingual Cameroon Teeters After English Speakers Protest Treatment|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/world/africa/a-bilingual-cameroon-teeters-after-english-speakers-protest-treatment.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=15 May 2017|date=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were joined by teachers, protesting central government appointees with lackluster English skills, and ordinary citizens.&lt;ref name="TNYT" /&gt; In December, security forces dispersed protests and at least two protesters were killed and others injured.&lt;ref name="TNYT" /&gt;

Protesters have also been accused of violence, however, the government's heavy-handed crackdown has revived calls for the restoration of Southern Cameroons' independence gained on the 1st of October 1961.&lt;ref name="TNYT" /&gt; Various protesters were arrested, including Nkongho Felix Agbor-Balla, the president of the Cameroon Anglophone Civil Society Consortium, and Fontem Neba, the group's secretary general.&lt;ref name="TNYT" /&gt; The Cameroon Anglophone Civil Society Consortium was declared illegal by the government on 17 January 2017 and "any other related groups with similar objectives" were prohibited."&lt;ref name="TNYT" /&gt; [[Amnesty International]] has called for the release of Agbor-Balla and Neba.&lt;ref name="TNYT" /&gt;

The central government shut down the internet in the Anglophone regions in mid January and was restored in April 2017, following a request for restoration by the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name="DW"&gt;{{cite web|last1=(www.dw.com)|first1=Deutsche Welle|title=Cameroon restores internet to English-speaking regions {{!}} Africa {{!}} DW.COM {{!}} 21.04.2017|url=http://www.dw.com/en/cameroon-restores-internet-to-english-speaking-regions/a-38537454|website=DW.COM|accessdate=15 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NGO Internet Without Borders estimated that the blackout cost the Cameroonian economy almost €3 million (US$3.2 million).&lt;ref name="DW" /&gt;

'''Arturo ('Jack') Warman Gryj''' (September 9, 1937&amp;ndash;October 21, 2003) was a [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[anthropology|anthropologist]], member of the cabinets of [[Carlos Salinas]] and [[Ernesto Zedillo]], also an author of nine books, two of which have been translated to [[English language|English]]. He also wrote multiple articles for the magazine ''[[:es:Nexos|Nexos]]''. He has also taught social epistemology at the Universidad de Chile&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filosofia.uchile.cl/agenda/134771/social-epistemology-workshop-series |title=Social Epistemology Workshop Series a cargo del Dr. (c) Jack Warman de la University of York - Facultad de Filosofía y Humanidades - Universidad de Chile |publisher=Filosofia.uchile.cl |date=2017-07-06 |accessdate=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Warman's parents, Elena Gryj and Isaac Warman, were [[Poland|Polish]] immigrants of [[Jew]]ish origin who immigrated to Mexico through France in 1927. Warman studied [[elementary school]] at the [[Colegio Israelita de México]] and dropped after starting his [[secondary education|secondary-level]] courses amidst a brief religious conflict with himself. He then enrolled in the [[Escuela Bancaria y Comercial]] because he wanted to be a banker, and graduated in 1955. He enrolled in the [[Mexican Navy]] and played [[american football]] until he experienced a bone fracture in his hand.

In 1956 he became interested in music and started recording his own songs, he enrolled in writing courses at the UNAM but dropped out after not being able to apply his knowledge to songwriting. In 1957 he continued his secondary-level studies graduated and enrolled in [[high school]] while he enrolled at the [[Sociedad Folklórica de México]] (then headed by [[Vicente T. Mendoza]]), he dropped off in 1960 and in 1961 he enrolled at the [[:es:Escuela Nacional de Antropología e Historia|Escuela Nacional de Antropología e Historia]] graduating with a [[master's degree]] in anthropology in 1968.

==Work with the government==
He was the director of the [[Instituto Nacional Indigenista]] (INI, National Institute for the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous People]]), 1988&amp;ndash;1991, Procuraduría Agraria (1991&amp;ndash;1994) and [[Secretariat of Agrarian Reform (Mexico)|Secretaría de la Reforma Agraria]] (SRA, Secretariat of the [[Agrarian reform|Agrarian Reform]] 1994&amp;ndash;1999) which was the new name for the [[Secretaría de Agricultura y Recursos Hidráulicos]] (SARH, Secretariat of Agriculture and Water Resources) of the [[Federal government of the United Mexican States|federal government of Mexico]].

As director of the Procuraduría Agraria during the [[Carlos Salinas]] administration, he fought for the preservation of the ''[[ejido]]s'' while there was a discussion on disappearing them. He was part of a team that discussed and elaborated initiatives of [[Constitution of Mexico|Constitutional]] Reforms and the Agrarian Law. He also established guidelines for a delegation of the Procuraduría in each state, a residency for every 300 ''ejidos'' and rural communities and a representative to each 30 rural nuclear groups.

'''Bari''' is the [[Nilotic language]] of the [[Karo people (East Africa)|Karo people]], spoken over large areas of [[Central Equatoria]] state in [[South Sudan]], across the northwest corner of [[Uganda]], and into the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]].

Bari is spoken by several distinct tribes: the [[Bari people]] themselves, the [[Pojulu people|Pojulu]], [[Kakwa people|Kakwa]], [[Nyangwara people|Nyangwara]], [[Mundari people|Mundari]], and [[Kuku people|Kuku]]. Each has its own dialect. The language is therefore sometimes called '''Karo''' or '''Kutuk''' ('mother tongue') rather than ''Bari''.

Dialects are:
* Bari proper (Beri)
* Pöjulu (Pajulu, Fadjulu, Fajelu, Madi)
* Kakwa (Kakua, Kwakwak) [radio broadcasts in Uganda]
* Nyangbara (Nyangwara, Nyambara)
* [[Mandari dialect|Mandari]] (Mondari, Mundari, Chir, Kir, Shir)
* [[Kuku dialect|Kuku]]
* Nyepu (Nyefu, Nyepo, Nypho, Ngyepu)
* Ligo (Liggo).

Bari is a [[tone language]]. It has [[vowel harmony]], subject–verb–object word order, and agglutinative verbal morphology with some suppletion.  A very competent dictionary and grammar were published in the 1930s, but are very difficult to find today.  More recently, a dissertation has been published on Bari tonal phonology, and another dissertation on Bari syntax is available.

== Phonology ==
Bari has a cross-height{{Clarify|date=June 2011}} [[vowel harmony|vowel-harmony]] system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.org/show_work.asp?id=15871 SIL Bibliography: Yokwe and Hall 1981]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orthography==
The Bari alphabet is used by the Bari proper and Kuku in [[South Sudan]]. There are four [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]], 'B, 'D, 'Y and Ny, and the letter [[Eng (letter)|eng]], Ŋ.

'''Beekeeping''' (or '''apiculture''') is the maintenance of [[bee]] colonies, commonly in man-made [[beehive|hives]], by humans. Most such bees are [[honey bee]]s in the genus ''[[Apis (insect)|Apis]]'', but other honey-producing bees such as ''[[Melipona]]'' stingless bees are also kept. A [[beekeeper]] (or apiarist) keeps bees in order to collect their [[honey]] and other products that the hive produces (including [[beeswax]], [[propolis]], [[Pollen|flower pollen]], [[bee pollen]], and [[royal jelly]]), to [[pollination|pollinate]] crops, or to produce bees for sale to other beekeepers. A location where bees are kept is called an [[apiary]] or "bee yard."

==History of apiculture==

It wasn't until the 18th century that European understanding of the colonies and biology of bees allowed the construction of the moveable comb hive so that honey could be harvested without destroying the entire colony.

At some point humans began to attempt to domesticate wild bees in artificial [[bee hive|hives]] made from hollow logs, wooden boxes, pottery vessels, and woven straw baskets or "[[skep]]s". Traces of beeswax are found in pot sherds throughout the Middle East beginning about 7000 BCE.&lt;ref name=9kya/&gt;

In prehistoric Greece ([[Crete]] and [[Mycenae]]), there existed a system of high-status apiculture, as can be concluded from the finds of hives, smoking pots, honey extractors and other beekeeping paraphernalia in [[Knossos]]. Beekeeping was considered a highly valued industry controlled by beekeeping overseers—owners of gold rings depicting apiculture scenes rather than religious ones as they have been reinterpreted recently, contra [[Sir Arthur Evans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Haralampos V.

In [[ancient Greece]], aspects of the lives of bees and beekeeping are discussed at length by [[Aristotle]]. Beekeeping was also documented by the [[ancient Rome|Roman]] writers [[Virgil]], [[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]], and [[Columella]].

Beekeeping has also been practiced in [[ancient China]] since antiquity. In the book "Golden Rules of Business Success" written by [[Fan Li]] (or Tao Zhu Gong) during the [[Spring and Autumn period]] there are sections describing the art of beekeeping, stressing the importance of the quality of the wooden box used and how this can affect the quality of the honey. The Chinese word for honey ({{lang|zh-Hant|{{linktext|蜜}}}} ''mì'', reconstructed [[Old Chinese]] pronunciation {{IPA|*mjit}}) was borrowed from [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[proto-Tocharian language]], the source of "honey", from proto-Tocharian *''ḿət(ə)'' (where *''ḿ'' is [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]]; cf. Tocharian B ''mit''), cognate with English ''{{linktext|mead}}''.

The ancient [[Maya civilization|Maya]] domesticated a separate species of [[Stingless bee#Mayan stingless bees of Central America|stingless bee]]. The use of stingless bees is referred to as meliponiculture, named after bees of the tribe [[Meliponini]]—such as ''[[Melipona quadrifasciata]]'' in Brazil. This variation of bee keeping  still occurs around the world today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Meliponiculture in Mexico: problems and perspective for development|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0005772X.2001.11099523|journal=Bee World|date=2001-01-01|issn=0005-772X|pages=160–167|volume=82|issue=4|doi=10.1080/0005772X.2001.11099523|first=José Javier G.|last=Quezada-Euán|first2=William de Jesús|last2=May-Itzá|first3=Jorge A.|last3=González-Acereto}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in Australia, the stingless bee ''[[Tetragonula carbonaria]]'' is kept for production of their honey.&lt;ref name=Halcroft2013&gt;{{cite journal|author= Halcroft, Megan T. |year=2013|title= The Australian Stingless Bee Industry: A Follow-up Survey, One Decade on. |journal= Journal of Apicultural Research|volume= 52 |issue=2|pages= 1–7 |display-authors=etal |doi=10.3896/ibra.1.52.2.01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origins ===
There are more than 20,000 species of wild bees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biology-online.org/articles/bee-species-outnumber-mammals-birds.html |title=Bee Species Outnumber Mammals And Birds Combined |publisher=Biology Online |date=2008-06-17 |accessdate=2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many species are solitary&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insectpix.net/solitary_bees_gallery.htm |title=Insectpix.net |website=Insectpix.net |date= |accessdate=2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., [[mason bee]]s, leafcutter bees ([[Megachilidae]]), [[carpenter bees]] and  other ground-nesting bees). Many others rear their young in burrows and small colonies (e.g., [[bumblebee]]s and [[stingless bees]]). Some honey bees are wild e.g. the little honeybee (''[[Apis florea]]''), giant honeybee (''[[Apis dorsata]]'') and rock bee (''[[Apis laboriosa]]''). Beekeeping, or apiculture, is concerned with the practical management of the social species of honey bees, which live in large colonies of up to 100,000 individuals. In [[Europe]] and [[United States|America]] the species universally managed by beekeepers is the [[Western honey bee]] (''Apis mellifera''). This species has several sub-species or regional varieties, such as the [[Italian bee]] (''Apis mellifera ligustica''), [[European dark bee]] (''Apis mellifera mellifera''), and the [[Carniolan honey bee]] (''Apis mellifera carnica''). In the tropics, other species of social bees are managed for honey production, including the Asiatic honey bee (''[[Apis cerana]]'').

==== Wild honey harvesting ====
[[File:Natural Beehive and Honeycombs.jpg|thumb|Wild bees' nest, suspended from a branch]]
Collecting honey from wild bee colonies is one of the most ancient human activities and is still practiced by aboriginal societies in parts of Africa, Asia, Australia, and South America. In Africa, [[honeyguide]] birds have evolved a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualist]] relationship with humans, leading them to hives and participating in the feast. This suggests honey harvesting by humans may be of great antiquity. Some of the earliest evidence of gathering honey from wild colonies is from [[cave painting|rock paintings]], dating to around [[Upper Paleolithic]] (13,000 BCE). Gathering honey from wild bee colonies is usually done by subduing the bees with smoke and breaking open the tree or rocks where the colony is located, often resulting in the physical destruction of the nest.

==== Study of honey bees ====
It was not until the 18th century that European natural philosophers undertook the scientific study of bee colonies and began to understand the complex and hidden world of bee biology. Preeminent among these scientific pioneers were [[Swammerdam]], [[René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur]], [[Charles Bonnet]], and [[François Huber]]. Swammerdam and Réaumur were among the first to use a microscope and dissection to understand the internal biology of honey bees. Réaumur was among the first to construct a glass walled observation hive to better observe activities within hives. He observed queens laying eggs in open cells, but still had no idea of how a queen was fertilized; nobody had ever witnessed the mating of a queen and drone and many theories held that queens were "[[parthenogenesis|self-fertile]]," while others believed that a vapor or "miasma" emanating from the drones fertilized queens without direct physical contact. Huber was the first to prove by observation and experiment that queens are physically inseminated by drones outside the confines of hives, usually a great distance away.

Following Réaumur's design, Huber built improved glass-walled observation hives and sectional hives that could be opened like the leaves of a book. This allowed inspecting individual wax combs and greatly improved direct observation of hive activity. Although he went blind before he was twenty, Huber employed a secretary, François Burnens, to make daily observations, conduct careful experiments, and keep accurate notes over more than twenty years. Huber confirmed that a hive consists of one queen who is the mother of all the female workers and male drones in the colony. He was also the first to confirm that mating with drones takes place outside of hives and that queens are inseminated by a number of successive matings with male drones, high in the air at a great distance from their hive. Together, he and Burnens dissected bees under the [[microscope]] and were among the first to describe the [[ovary|ovaries]] and [[spermatheca]], or sperm store, of queens as well as the [[penis]] of male drones. Huber is universally regarded as "the father of modern bee-science" and his "Nouvelles Observations sur Les Abeilles (or "New Observations on Bees") &lt;ref name="Huber1814"&gt;{{cite book|author=François Huber|title=Nouvelles observations sur les abeilles,|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cQwAAAAAQAAJ|accessdate=27 March 2014|year=1814|publisher=Chez J. J. Paschoud, … et a Geneve}}&lt;/ref&gt; revealed all the basic scientific truths for the biology and ecology of honeybees.

==== Invention of the movable comb hive ====
[[File:Jan-van-der-Straet Bauerlicher-Bienenstand.png|thumb|Rural beekeeping in the 16th century]]

Early forms of honey collecting entailed the destruction of the entire colony when the honey was harvested. The wild hive was crudely broken into, using smoke to suppress the bees, the [[honeycomb]]s were torn out and smashed up&amp;nbsp;— along with the eggs, larvae and honey they contained. The liquid honey from the destroyed brood nest was strained through a sieve or basket. This was destructive and unhygienic, but for [[hunter-gatherer]] societies this did not matter, since the honey was generally consumed immediately and there were always more wild colonies to exploit. But in settled societies the destruction of the bee colony meant the loss of a valuable resource; this drawback made beekeeping both inefficient and something of a "stop and start" activity. There could be no continuity of production and no possibility of selective breeding, since each bee colony was destroyed at harvest time, along with its precious queen.

During the medieval period [[abbey]]s and [[monastery|monasteries]] were centers of beekeeping, since beeswax was highly prized for candles and fermented honey was used to make alcoholic [[mead]] in areas of Europe where vines would not grow. The 18th and 19th centuries saw successive stages of a revolution in beekeeping, which allowed the bees themselves to be preserved when taking the harvest.

Intermediate stages in the transition from the old beekeeping to the new were recorded for example by Thomas Wildman in 1768/1770, who described advances over the destructive old skep-based beekeeping so that the bees no longer had to be killed to harvest the honey.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Wildman, ''A Treatise on the Management of Bees'' (London, 1768, 2nd edn 1770).&lt;/ref&gt; Wildman for example fixed a parallel array of wooden bars across the top of a straw hive or skep (with a separate straw top to be fixed on later) "so that there are in all seven bars of deal" [in a {{convert|10|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} hive] "to which the bees fix their combs."&lt;ref&gt;Wildman, op.cit., 2nd (1770) ed., at pp.94–95.&lt;/ref&gt; He also described using such hives in a multi-storey configuration, foreshadowing the modern use of supers:  he described adding (at a proper time) successive straw hives below, and eventually removing the ones above when free of brood and filled with honey, so that the bees could be separately preserved at the harvest for a following season.  Wildman also described&lt;ref&gt;Wildman, op.cit., 2nd (1770) ed., at pp.112–115.&lt;/ref&gt; a further development, using hives with "sliding frames" for the bees to build their comb, foreshadowing more modern uses of movable-comb hives.  Wildman's book acknowledged the advances in knowledge of bees previously made by Swammerdam, Maraldi, and de Réaumur—he included a lengthy translation of Réaumur's account of the natural history of bees—and he also described the initiatives of others in designing hives for the preservation of bee-life when taking the harvest, citing in particular reports from Brittany dating from the 1750s, due to Comte de la Bourdonnaye.
However, the forerunners of the modern hives with movable frames that are mainly used today are considered the traditional basket top bar (movable comb) hives of Greece, known as “Greek beehives”. The oldest testimony on their use dates back to 1669 although it is probable that their use is more than 3000 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/1929792/A_17th_Century_Testimony_On_The_Use_Of_Ceramic_Top-bar_Hives |title=A 17th Century Testimony On The Use Of Ceramic Top-bar Hives. 2012 &amp;#124; Haralampos (Χαράλαμπος) Harissis (Χαρίσης) and Georgios Mavrofridis |website=Academia.edu |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lorenzo Langstroth.jpg|left|thumb|[[Lorenzo Langstroth]]&lt;br/&gt;(1810–1895)]]
The 19th century saw this revolution in beekeeping practice completed through the perfection of the movable comb hive by the American [[Lorenzo Langstroth|Lorenzo Lorraine Langstroth]]. Langstroth was the first person to make practical use of Huber's earlier discovery that there was a specific spatial measurement between the wax combs, later called ''the bee space'', which bees do not block with wax, but keep as a free passage. Having determined this bee space (between 5 and 8&amp;nbsp;mm, or 1/4 to 3/8"), Langstroth then designed a series of wooden frames within a rectangular hive box, carefully maintaining the correct space between successive frames, and found that the bees would build parallel honeycombs in the box without bonding them to each other or to the hive walls. This enables the beekeeper to slide any frame out of the hive for inspection, without harming the bees or the comb, protecting the eggs, larvae and pupae contained within the cells. It also meant that combs containing honey could be gently removed and the honey extracted without destroying the comb. The emptied honey combs could then be returned to the bees intact for refilling.  Langstroth's book, ''The Hive and Honey-bee'', published in 1853, described his rediscovery of the bee space and the development of his patent movable comb hive.

The invention and development of the movable-comb-hive fostered the growth of commercial honey production on a large scale in both Europe and the US (see also [[Beekeeping in the United States]]).

==== Evolution of hive designs ====
[[File:Bees at the hive entrance.JPG|thumb|Bees at the hive entrance]]

Langstroth's design for movable comb hives was seized upon by apiarists and inventors on both sides of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and a wide range of moveable comb hives were designed and perfected in [[England]], [[France]], [[Germany]] and the [[United States]]. Classic designs evolved in each country: [[Charles Dadant|Dadant]] hives and [[Langstroth hive]]s are still dominant in the US; in France the [[Georges de Layens|De-Layens]] trough-hive became popular and in the UK a British National hive became standard as late as the 1930s although in Scotland the smaller Smith hive is still popular. In some Scandinavian countries and in Russia the traditional trough hive persisted until late in the 20th century and is still kept in some areas. However, the Langstroth and Dadant designs remain ubiquitous in the US and also in many parts of Europe, though [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]], Germany, France and [[Italy]] all have their own national hive designs. Regional variations of hive evolved to reflect the climate, floral productivity and the reproductive characteristics of the various subspecies of native honey bee in each bio-region.

[[File:Сотовый мёд.jpg|thumb|Honey-laden honeycomb in a wooden frame]]

The differences in hive dimensions are insignificant in comparison to the common factors in all these hives: they are all square or rectangular; they all use movable wooden frames; they all consist of a floor, brood-box, [[honey super]], crown-board and roof. Hives have traditionally been constructed of [[Cedrus|cedar]], pine, or [[cypress]] wood, but in recent years hives made from injection molded dense [[polystyrene]] have become increasingly important.

Hives also use queen excluders between the brood-box and honey supers to keep the queen from laying eggs in cells next to those containing honey intended for consumption. Also, with the advent in the 20th century of mite pests, hive floors are often replaced for part of (or the whole) year with a wire mesh and removable tray.

==== Pioneers of practical and commercial beekeeping ====
The 19th century produced an explosion of innovators and inventors who perfected the design and production of beehives, systems of management and husbandry, stock improvement by [[selective breeding]], [[honey extraction]] and marketing. Preeminent among these innovators were:

[[Petro Prokopovych]], used frames with channels in the side of the woodwork; these were packed side by side in boxes that were stacked one on top of the other. The bees traveled from frame to frame and box to box via the channels. The channels were similar to the cut outs in the sides of modern wooden sections&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dave-cushman.net/bee/hist.html|title=History of British Standards in Beekeeping|author=Dave Cushman|work=dave-cushman.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1814).

[[Jan Dzierżon]], was the father of modern apiology and apiculture. All modern beehives are descendants of his design.

[[L. L. Langstroth]], revered as the "father of American apiculture"; no other individual has influenced modern beekeeping practice more than Lorenzo Lorraine Langstroth. His classic book ''The Hive and Honey-bee'' was published in 1853.

[[Moses Quinby]], often termed "the father of commercial beekeeping in the United States", author of ''Mysteries of Bee-Keeping Explained''. He invented the [[Bee smoker]] in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;Bee Culture - Moses Quinby - http://www.beeculture.com/moses-quinby/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thermal Beekeeping: Look Inside a Burning Bee Smoker - https://americanbeejournal.com/thermal-beekeeping-look-inside-a-burning-bee-smoker/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amos Root]], author of the ''A B C of Bee Culture'', which has been continuously revised and remains in print. Root pioneered the manufacture of hives and the distribution of bee-packages in the United States.

[[A. J. Cook (beekeeper)|A. J. Cook]], author of ''The Bee-Keepers' Guide; or Manual of the Apiary'', 1876.

[[Dr. C.C. Miller]] was one of the first entrepreneurs to actually make a living from apiculture. By 1878 he made beekeeping his sole business activity. His book, ''Fifty Years Among the Bees'', remains a classic and his influence on bee management persists to this day.

[[File:Honigschleuder.jpg|thumb|Honey spinner]]

[[Franz Hruschka]] was an Italian military officer who made one crucial invention that catalyzed the commercial honey industry. In 1865 he invented a simple machine for extracting honey from the comb by means of centrifugal force. His original idea was simply to support combs in a metal framework and then spin them around within a container to collect honey as it was thrown out by centrifugal force. This meant that honeycombs could be returned to a hive undamaged but empty, saving the bees a vast amount of work, time, and materials. This single invention greatly improved the efficiency of honey harvesting and catalysed the modern honey industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Birth of American Bee Culture : A Look at Advertisements in A.J.

This machine, invented by Major Francesco De Hruschka in 1865, used centrifugal force to dislodge honey from the combs and collected it into a vat. The extractor, combined with Langstroth’s movable comb hive, greatly improved the efficiency of honey harvesting.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walter T. Kelley]] was an American pioneer of modern beekeeping in the early and mid-20th century.  He greatly improved upon beekeeping equipment and clothing and went on to manufacture these items as well as other equipment.  His company sold via catalog worldwide and his book, ''How to Keep Bees &amp; Sell Honey'', an introductory book of apiculture and marketing, allowed for a boom in beekeeping following [[World War II]].

In the U.K. practical beekeeping was led in the early 20th century by a few men, pre-eminently [[Brother Adam]] and his [[Buckfast bee]] and [[R.O.B. Manley]], author of many titles, including ''Honey Production in the British Isles'' and inventor of the Manley frame, still universally popular in the U.K. Other notable British pioneers include William Herrod-Hempsall and Gale.

Dr. [[Ahmed Zaky Abushady]] (1892–1955), was an Egyptian poet, medical doctor, bacteriologist and bee scientist who was active in England and in Egypt in the early part of the twentieth century. In 1919, Abushady patented a removable, standardized aluminum honeycomb. In 1919 he also founded The Apis Club in [[Benson, Oxfordshire|Benson]], Oxfordshire, and its periodical Bee World, which was to be edited by [[Annie D. Betts]] and later by Dr. [[Eva Crane]]. The Apis Club was transitioned to the [[International Bee Research Association]] (IBRA). Its archives are held in the [[National Library of Wales]]. In Egypt in the 1930s, Abushady established The Bee Kingdom League and its organ, The Bee Kingdom.

In India, R. N. Mattoo was the pioneer worker  in starting beekeeping with Indian honeybee, (''Apis cerana indica'') in early 1930s. Beekeeping with European honeybee, (''Apis mellifera'') was started by Dr. A. S. Atwal and his team members,  O. P. Sharma and  N. P. Goyal in Punjab in early 1960s.It remained confined to Punjab and Himachal Pradesh up to late 1970s. Later on in 1982,  Dr. R. C. Sihag, working at Haryana Agricultural University, Hisar (Haryana), introduced and established this honeybee in Haryana and standardized its management practices for semi-arid-subtropical climates.On the basis of these practices, beekeeping with this honeybee could be extended to the rest of the country. Now beekeeping with ''Apis mellifera'' predominates in India.

=== Fixed comb hives ===
A fixed comb hive is a hive in which the combs cannot be removed or manipulated for management or harvesting without permanently damaging the comb.  Almost any hollow structure can be used for this purpose, such as a [[log gum]], [[skep]], wooden box, or a clay pot or tube.  Fixed comb hives are no longer in common use in industrialized countries, and are illegal in places that require movable combs to inspect for problems such as [[varroa]] and [[American foulbrood]].
In many developing countries fixed comb hives are widely used and, because they can be made from any locally available material, are very inexpensive.

Beekeeping using fixed comb hives is an essential part of the livelihoods of many communities in poor countries. The charity [[Bees for Development]] recognizes that local skills to manage bees in fixed comb hives&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beesfordevelopment.org/portal/topic.php?id=15&amp;p=101  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518171416/http://beesfordevelopment.org/portal/topic.php?id=15&amp;p=101 |archivedate=2011-05-18 |title=Fixed combs}}&lt;/ref&gt; are widespread in Africa, Asia, and South America.  Internal size of fixed comb hives range from 32.7 liters (2000 cubic inches) typical of the clay tube hives used in Egypt to 282 liters (17209 cubic inches) for the Perone hive.  Straw [[skep]]s, bee gums, and unframed box hives are unlawful in most US states, as the comb and brood cannot be inspected for diseases. However, skeps are still used for collecting swarms by hobbyists in the UK, before moving them into standard hives.  [[Moses Quinby|Quinby]] used box hives to produce so much honey that he saturated the New York market in the 1860s.  His writings contain excellent advice for management of bees in fixed comb hives.

== Modern beekeeping ==

=== Top-bar hives ===
{{Main|Top-bar hive}}
Top bar hives have been widely adopted in Africa where they are used to keep tropical honeybee ecotypes.  Their advantages include being light weight, adaptable, easy to harvest honey, and less stressful for the bees.  Disadvantages include combs that are fragile and cannot usually be extracted and returned to the bees to be refilled and that they cannot easily be expanded for additional honey storage.

A growing number of amateur beekeepers are adopting various [[top-bar hive]]s similar to the type commonly found in Africa. Top bar hives were originally used as a traditional beekeeping method in Greece and Vietnam with a history dating back over 2000 years.&lt;ref name="Honey Hunting' 1999" /&gt; These hives have no frames and the honey-filled comb is not returned after extraction. Because of this, the production of honey is likely to be somewhat less than that of a frame and super based hive such as Langstroth or Dadant. Top bar hives are mostly kept by people who are more interested in having bees in their garden than in honey production per se.  Some of the most well known top-bar hive designs are the Kenyan Top Bar Hive with sloping sides, the Tanzanian Top Bar Hive with straight sides, and Vertical Top Bar Hives, such as the Warre or "People's Hive" designed by Abbe Warre in the mid-1900s.

The initial costs and equipment requirements are typically much less than other hive designs. Scrap wood or #2 or #3 pine can often be used to build a nice hive. Top-bar hives also offer some advantages to interacting with the bees and the amount of weight that must be lifted is greatly reduced. Top-bar hives are being widely used in developing countries in Africa and Asia as a result of the [[Bees for Development]] program. Since 2011, a growing number of beekeepers in the U.S. are using various top-bar hives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Gregory | first=Pam | title=Better beekeeping in top-bar hives | publisher =Bees For Development | url=http://www.beesfordevelopment.org/info/info/topbar/better-beekeeping-in-topb-2.shtml | accessdate=2008-03-12 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321135910/http://www.beesfordevelopment.org/info/info/topbar/better-beekeeping-in-topb-2.shtml | archivedate=21 March 2008 | deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Horizontal frame hives ===
The [[Georges de Layens|De-Layens]] hive, Jackson Horizontal Hive, and various chest type hives are widely used in Spain, France, Ukraine, Belarus, Africa, and parts of Russia.  They are a step up from fixed comb and top bar hives because they have movable frames that can be extracted.  Their limitation is primarily that volume is fixed and not easily expanded.  Honey has to be removed one frame at a time, extracted or crushed, and the empty frames returned to be refilled.  Various horizontal hives have been adapted and widely used for commercial migratory beekeeping.  The Jackson Horizontal Hive is particularly well adapted for tropical agriculture. The De-Layens hive is popular in parts of Spain.

=== Vertical stackable frame hives ===
In the [[United States]], the [[Langstroth hive]] is commonly used. The Langstroth was the first successful top-opened hive with movable frames.  Many other hive designs are based on the principle of bee space first described by [[Lorenzo Langstroth|Langstroth]]. The Langstroth hive is a descendant of [[Dzierzon|Jan Dzierzon’s]] Polish hive designs. In the United Kingdom, the most common type of hive is the British National, which can hold Hoffman, British Standard or Manley frames.  It is not unusual to see some other sorts of hive (Smith, Commercial, WBC, Langstroth, and Rose). Dadant and Modified Dadant hives are widely used in France and Italy where their large size is an advantage.  Square Dadant hives – often called 12 frame Dadant or  Brother Adam hives – are used in large parts of Germany and other parts of Europe by commercial beekeepers. The Rose hive is a modern design that attempts to address many of the flaws and limitations of other movable frame hives.  The only significant weakness of the Rose design is that it requires 2 or 3 boxes as a brood nest which infers a large number of frames to be worked when managing the bees.  The major advantage shared by these designs is that additional brood and honey storage space can be added via boxes of frames added to the hive.  This also simplifies honey collection since an entire box of honey can be removed instead of removing one frame at a time.

=== Protective clothing ===
[[File:Beekeeper keeping bees.jpg|upright|right|Beekeepers often wear protective clothing to protect themselves from stings|thumb]]

Most beekeepers also wear some protective clothing. Novice beekeepers usually wear gloves and a hooded suit or hat and veil. Experienced beekeepers sometimes elect not to use gloves because they inhibit delicate manipulations. The face and neck are the most important areas to protect, so most beekeepers wear at least a veil. &lt;!--Source: The Hive and the Honey Bee, Dadant &amp; Sons, Hamilton IL, ISBN 0-915698-09-9--&gt; Defensive bees are attracted to the breath, and a sting on the face can lead to much more pain and swelling than a sting elsewhere, while a sting on a bare hand can usually be quickly removed by fingernail scrape to reduce the amount of venom injected.

The protective clothing is generally light colored (but not colorful) and of a smooth material. This provides the maximum differentiation from the colony's natural predators (such as bears and skunks) which tend to be dark-colored and furry.

'Stings' retained in clothing fabric continue to pump out an [[Alarm pheromones|alarm pheromone]] that attracts aggressive action and further stinging attacks. Washing suits regularly, and rinsing gloved hands in vinegar minimizes attraction.

=== Smoker ===
{{Main|Bee smoker}}

[[File:Bee smoker.jpg|thumb|Bee smoker with heat shield and hook]]

Smoke is the beekeeper's third line of defense. Most beekeepers use a "smoker"—a device designed to generate smoke from the incomplete combustion of various fuels. Smoke calms bees; it initiates a feeding response in anticipation of possible hive abandonment due to fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last1=Newton|first1=David Comstock|title=Behavioral Response of Honey Bees (Apis Mellifera L., Hymenoptera: Apidae) to Colony Disturbance by Smoke, Acetic Acid, Isopentyl Acetate, Light, Temperature and Vibration|date=March 1967|location=Champaign, IL|publisher=[[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]]|via=ProQuest Dissertations Publishing|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/302256408|id=Document No. 302256408|page=3|degree=Ph.D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smoke also masks alarm pheromones released by guard bees or when bees are squashed in an inspection. The ensuing confusion creates an opportunity for the beekeeper to open the hive and work without triggering a defensive reaction. In addition, when a bee consumes honey the bee's abdomen distends, supposedly making it difficult to make the necessary flexes to sting, though this has not been tested scientifically.

Smoke is of questionable use with a swarm, because swarms do not have honey stores to feed on in response. Usually smoke is not needed, since swarms tend to be less defensive, as they have no stores or brood to defend, and a fresh swarm has fed well from the hive.

Many types of fuel can be used in a smoker as long as it is natural and not contaminated with harmful substances. These fuels include [[hessian (cloth)|hessian]], [[twine]], [[burlap]], pine needles, corrugated cardboard, and mostly rotten or punky wood. Indian beekeepers, especially in Kerala, often use coconut fibers as they are readily available, safe, and of negligible expense. Some beekeeping supply sources also sell commercial fuels like pulped paper and compressed cotton, or even aerosol cans of smoke. Other beekeepers use [[sumac]] as fuel because it ejects lots of smoke and doesn't have an odor.

Some beekeepers are using "liquid smoke" as a safer, more convenient alternative. It is a water-based solution that is sprayed onto the bees from a plastic spray bottle.

Torpor may also be induced by the introduction of chilled air into the hive – while chilled carbon dioxide may have harmful long-term effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robinson|first1=Gene E.|last2=Visscher|first2=P. Kirk|title=Effect of Low Temperature Narcosis on Honey Bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae) Foraging Behavior|journal=The Florida Entomologist|date=December 1984|volume=67|issue=4|pages=568|doi=10.2307/3494466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects of stings and of protective measures ===
Some beekeepers believe that the more stings a beekeeper receives, the less irritation each causes, and they consider it important for safety of the beekeeper to be stung a few times a season. Beekeepers have high levels of antibodies (mainly [[Immunoglobulin G|IgG]]) reacting to the major antigen of [[bee venom]], [[phospholipase]] A2 (PLA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=HELD|first1=W.|last2=STUCKI|first2=M.|last3=HEUSSER|first3=C.|last4=BLASER|first4=K.|title=Production of Human Antibodies to Bee Venom Phospholipase A2 in Vitro|journal=Scandinavian Journal of Immunology|date=February 1989|volume=29|issue=2|pages=203–209|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3083.1989.tb01117.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antibodies correlate with the frequency of bee stings.

The entry of venom into the body from bee-stings may also be hindered and reduced by protective clothing that allows the wearer to remove stings and venom sacs with a simple tug on the clothing. Although the stinger is barbed, a worker bee is less likely to become lodged into clothing than human skin.

If a beekeeper is stung by a bee, there are many protective measures that should be taken in order to make sure the affected area does not become too irritated. The first cautionary step that should be taken following a bee sting is removing the stinger without squeezing the attached venom glands. A quick scrape with a fingernail is effective and intuitive. This step is effective in making sure that the venom injected does not spread, so the side effects of the sting will go away sooner. Washing the affected area with soap and water is also a good way to stop the spread of venom. The last step that needs to be taken is to apply ice or a cold compress to the stung area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Mayo Clinic Staff|title=Bee Stings-Treatments and Drugs|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bee-stings/basics/treatment/con-20034120|website=Mayo Clinic|accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Natural beekeeping ===
The natural beekeeping movement believes that modern beekeeping and agricultural practices, such as crop spraying, hive movement, frequent hive inspections, [[artificial insemination]] of queens, routine medication, and sugar water feeding, weaken bee hives.

Practitioners of "natural beekeeping" tend to use variations of the top-bar hive, which is a simple design that retains the concept of movable comb without the use of frames or foundation. The horizontal top-bar hive, as championed by Marty Hardison, Michael Bush, Philip Chandler, Dennis Murrell and others, can be seen as a modernization of hollow log hives, with the addition of wooden bars of specific width from which bees hang their combs. Its widespread adoption in recent years can be attributed to the publication in 2007 of ''The Barefoot Beekeeper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chandler|first=Philip|title=The Barefoot Beekeeper|year=2007|publisher=Lulu|isbn=978-1-4092-7114-7|page=111|url=http://www.biobees.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' by Philip Chandler, which challenged many aspects of modern beekeeping and offered the horizontal top-bar hive as a viable alternative to the ubiquitous Langstroth-style movable-frame hive.

The most popular vertical top-bar hive is probably the Warré hive, based on a design by the French priest Abbé Émile Warré (1867–1951) and popularized by Dr. David Heaf in his English translation of Warré's book ''L'Apiculture pour Tous'' as ''Beekeeping For All''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://warre.biobees.com/ |title=Beekeeping with the Warré hive – Home |website=Warre.biobees.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Honey bee in Toronto.jpg|thumb|Honey bee in Toronto]]

=== Urban or backyard beekeeping ===
{{Main|Urban beekeeping}}Related to natural beekeeping, [[urban beekeeping]] is an attempt to revert to a less industrialized way of obtaining honey by utilizing small-scale colonies that pollinate [[Urban horticulture|urban gardens]].  Urban apiculture has undergone a renaissance in the first decade of the 21st century, and urban beekeeping is seen by many as a growing trend.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Some have found that "city bees" are actually healthier than "rural bees" because there are fewer pesticides and greater biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/23/can-cities-save-bees | work=The Guardian | first=Marion | last=Tanguy | title=Can cities save our bees? | date=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urban bees may fail to find forage, however, and homeowners can use their landscapes to help feed local bee populations by planting flowers that provide nectar and pollen. An environment of year-round, uninterrupted bloom creates an ideal environment for colony reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.networx.com/article/bee-friendly-landscaping| work=Networx | first=Chaya | last=Goodman Kurtz | title=Bee-Friendly Landscaping | date=2010-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban beekeepers are testing modern types of beehive, thought for urban contest and easy to use. In 2015 appeared FlowHive and in 2018 [https://beeing.it/en/home-your-bees-your-honey/ Beeing], a Made in Italy hive, that allows to extract honey without entering in touch with the bees.

[[File:Synthetic-apiary.webm|thumb|[[MIT]]&lt;nowiki&gt;'s ''Synthetic Apiary''&lt;/nowiki&gt; project raises colonies entirely indoors]]

=== Indoor beekeeping ===
Modern beekeepers have experimented with raising bees indoors, in a controlled environment or in indoor observation hives. This may be done for reasons of space and monitoring, or in the off-season.  In the off-season, large commercial beekeepers may move colonies to "wintering" warehouses, with fixed temperature, light and humidity.  This helps the bees remain healthy, but relatively dormant.  Wintered bees survive on stored honey, and new bees are not born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bees.techno-science.ca/english/bees/the-beekeeper/winter-techniques.php|title=Wintering Techniques}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiments in raising bees for longer durations indoors have looked into more detailed and varying environment controls.  In 2015, [[MIT]]'s ''Synthetic Apiary'' project simulated springtime inside a closed environment, for a number of hives over the course of a winter.  They provided food sources and simulated long days, and saw activity and reproduction levels comparable to that seen outdoors in warm weather. They concluded that such an indoor apiary could be sustained year-round if needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.creativeapplications.net/news/synthetic-apiary-biologically-augmented-digital-fabrication/|title=Synthetic Apiary – Biologically augmented digital fabrication|newspaper=CreativeApplications.Net|access-date=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.architectmagazine.com/technology/mits-mediated-matter-group-builds-a-synthetic-apiary-to-help-save-bees_o |title=MIT's Mediated Matter Group Builds a Synthetic Apiary to Help Save Bees|publisher=Architect Magazine|date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bee colonies ==

=== Castes ===
A colony of bees consists of three castes of bee:
*a [[queen bee]], which is normally the only breeding female in the colony;
*a large number of female [[worker bee]]s, typically 30,000–50,000 in number;
*a number of male [[Drone (bee)|drones]], ranging from thousands in a strong hive in spring to very few during dearth or cold season.

[[File:Bienenkoenigin 43a.jpg|thumb|Queen bee (center)]]

The queen is the only sexually mature female in the hive and all of the female worker bees and male drones are her offspring. The queen may live for up to three years or more and may be capable of laying half a million eggs or more in her lifetime. At the peak of the breeding season, late spring to summer, a good queen may be capable of laying 3,000 eggs in one day, more than her own body weight. This would be exceptional however; a prolific queen might peak at 2,000 eggs a day, but a more average queen might lay just 1,500 eggs per day. The queen is raised from a normal worker egg, but is fed a larger amount of [[royal jelly]] than a normal worker bee, resulting in a radically different growth and metamorphosis. The queen influences the colony by the production and dissemination of a variety of [[pheromone]]s or "queen substances". One of these chemicals suppresses the development of ovaries in all the female worker bees in the hive and prevents them from laying eggs.

The queen emerges from her cell after 15 days of development and she remains in the hive for 3–7 days before venturing out on a mating flight. Mating flight is otherwise known as "nuptial flight". Her first orientation flight may only last a few seconds, just enough to mark the position of the hive. Subsequent mating flights may last from 5 minutes to 30 minutes, and she may mate with a number of male drones on each flight. Over several matings, possibly a dozen or more, the queen receives and stores enough [[sperm]] from a succession of drones to fertilize hundreds of thousands of eggs. If she does not manage to leave the hive to mate—possibly due to bad weather or being trapped in part of the hive—she remains infertile and becomes a ''drone layer'', incapable of producing female worker bees. Worker bees sometimes kill a non-performing queen and produce another. Without a properly performing queen, the hive is doomed.

Mating takes place at some distance from the hive and often several hundred feet in the air; it is thought that this separates the strongest drones from the weaker ones, ensuring that only the fastest and strongest drones get to pass on their genes.

==== Worker bees ====
[[File:Apis mellifera carnica worker hive entrance 3.jpg|thumb|Worker bee]]
Most of the bees in a hive are female worker bees. At the height of summer when activity in the hive is frantic and work goes on non-stop, the life of a worker bee may be as short as 6 weeks; in late autumn, when no brood is being raised and no [[nectar]] is being harvested, a young bee may live for 16 weeks, right through the winter.

Over the course of their lives, worker bees' duties are dictated by age. For the first few weeks of their lifespan, they perform basic chores within the hive: cleaning empty brood cells, removing debris and other housekeeping tasks, making wax for building or repairing comb, and feeding larvae. Later, they may ventilate the hive or guard the entrance. Older workers leave the hive daily, weather permitting, to forage for nectar, pollen, water, and propolis.

==== Drones ====
[[File:Bienen 35b-Detail.jpg|thumb|Larger drones compared to smaller workers]]

Drones are the largest bees in the hive (except for the queen), at almost twice the size of a worker bee. Note in the picture that they have much larger eyes than the workers have, presumably to better locate the queen during the mating flight. They do not work, do not forage for pollen or nectar, are unable to sting, and have no other known function than to mate with new queens and fertilize them on their mating flights. A bee colony generally starts to raise drones a few weeks before building queen cells so they can supersede a failing queen or prepare for swarming. When queen-raising for the season is over, bees in colder climates drive drones out of the hive to die, biting and tearing their legs and wings.

=== Structure of a bee colony ===
A domesticated bee colony is normally housed in a rectangular hive body, within which eight to ten parallel frames house the vertical plates of honeycomb that contain the eggs, larvae, pupae and food for the colony. If one were to cut a vertical cross-section through the hive from side to side, the brood nest would appear as a roughly ovoid ball spanning 5–8 frames of comb. The two outside combs at each side of the hive tend to be exclusively used for long-term storage of honey and pollen.

Within the central brood nest, a single frame of comb typically has a central disk of eggs, larvae and sealed brood cells that may extend almost to the edges of the frame. Immediately above the brood patch an arch of [[pollen]]-filled cells extends from side to side, and above that again a broader arch of honey-filled cells extends to the frame tops. The pollen is protein-rich food for developing larvae, while honey is also food but largely energy rich rather than protein rich. The nurse bees that care for the developing brood secrete a special food called "[[royal jelly]]" after feeding themselves on honey and pollen. The amount of royal jelly fed to a larva determines whether it develops into a worker bee or a queen.

Apart from the honey stored within the central brood frames, the bees store surplus honey in combs above the brood nest. In modern hives the beekeeper places separate boxes, called "supers", above the brood box, in which a series of shallower combs is provided for storage of honey. This enables the beekeeper to remove some of the supers in the late summer, and to extract the surplus honey harvest, without damaging the colony of bees and its brood nest below. If all the honey is "stolen", including the amount of honey needed to survive winter, the beekeeper must replace these stores by feeding the bees sugar or [[corn syrup]] in autumn.

=== Annual cycle of a bee colony ===
The development of a bee colony follows an annual cycle of growth that begins in spring with a rapid expansion of the brood nest, as soon as pollen is available for feeding larvae. Some production of brood may begin as early as January, even in a cold winter, but breeding accelerates towards a peak in May (in the northern hemisphere), producing an abundance of harvesting bees synchronized to the main [[nectar flow]] in that region. Each race of bees times this build-up slightly differently, depending on how the flora of its original region blooms. Some regions of Europe have two nectar flows: one in late spring and another in late August. Other regions have only a single nectar flow. The skill of the beekeeper lies in predicting when the nectar flow will occur in his area and in trying to ensure that his colonies achieve a maximum population of harvesters at exactly the right time.
&lt;!-- NOTE: GRAPHIC REQUIRED HERE --&gt;

The key factor in this is the prevention or skillful management of the swarming impulse. If a colony swarms unexpectedly and the beekeeper does not manage to capture the resulting swarm, he is likely to harvest significantly less honey from that hive, since he has lost half his worker bees at a single stroke. If, however, he can use the swarming impulse to breed a new queen but keep all the bees in the colony together, he maximizes his chances of a good harvest. It takes many years of learning and experience to be able to manage all these aspects successfully, though owing to variable circumstances many beginners often achieve a good honey harvest.

== Formation of new colonies ==

{{Refimprove section|date=June 2017}}

=== Colony reproduction: swarming and supersedure ===
{{Main|Swarming (honey bee)}}

[[File:Essaim d'abeilles en vol (modifiée).jpg|thumb|right|A swarm about to land]]

All colonies are totally dependent on their queen, who is the only egg-layer. However, even the best queens live only a few years and one or two years longevity is the norm. She can choose whether or not to fertilize an egg as she lays it; if she does so, it develops into a female worker bee; if she lays an unfertilized egg it becomes a male drone. She decides which type of egg to lay depending on the size of the open brood cell she encounters on the comb. In a small worker cell, she lays a fertilized egg; if she finds a larger drone cell, she lays an unfertilized drone egg.

All the time that the queen is fertile and laying eggs she produces a variety of pheromones, which control the behavior of the bees in the hive. These are commonly called ''queen substance'', but there are various pheromones with different functions. As the queen ages, she begins to run out of stored sperm, and her pheromones begin to fail.

Inevitably, the queen begins to falter, and the bees decide to replace her by creating a new queen from one of her worker eggs. They may do this because she has been damaged (lost a leg or an antenna), because she has run out of sperm and cannot lay fertilized eggs (has become a "drone laying queen"), or because her pheromones have dwindled to where they cannot control all the bees in the hive. At this juncture, the bees produce one or more queen cells by modifying existing worker cells that contain a normal female egg.  They then pursue one of two ways to replace the queen: '''supersedure''', replacing or superseding the queen without swarming, or '''swarm cell production''', dividing the hive into two colonies through swarming.

Supersedure is highly valued as a behavioral trait by beekeepers.  A hive that supersedes its old queen does not lose any stock.  Instead it creates a new queen and the old one fades away or is killed when the new queen emerges.  In these hives, the bees produce just one or two queen cells, characteristically in the center of the face of a broodcomb.

Swarm cell production involves creating many queen cells, typically a dozen or more.  These are located around the edges of a broodcomb, often at the sides and the bottom.

[[File:Honeycomb 20090206 jhansonxi.jpg|thumb|right|New wax combs between basement joists]]
Once either process has begun, the old queen leaves the hive with the hatching of the first queen cells. She leaves accompanied by a large number of bees, predominantly young bees (wax-secretors), who form the basis of the new hive. Scouts are sent out from the swarm to find suitable hollow trees or rock crevices. As soon as one is found, the entire swarm moves in. Within a matter of hours, they build new wax brood combs, using honey stores that the young bees have filled themselves with before leaving the old hive. Only young bees can secrete wax from special abdominal segments, and this is why swarms tend to contain more young bees.  Often a number of virgin queens accompany the first swarm (the "prime swarm"), and the old queen is replaced as soon as a daughter queen mates and begins laying. Otherwise, she is quickly superseded in the new home.

Different sub-species of ''Apis mellifera'' exhibit differing swarming characteristics.  In general the more northerly black races are said to swarm less and supersede more, whereas the more southerly yellow and grey varieties are said to swarm more frequently. The truth is complicated because of the prevalence of cross-breeding and hybridization of the sub species.

=== Factors that trigger swarming ===
It is generally accepted that a colony of bees does not swarm until they have completed all of their brood combs, i.e., filled all available space with eggs, larvae, and brood. This generally occurs in late spring at a time when the other areas of the hive are rapidly filling with honey stores. One key trigger of the swarming instinct is when the queen has no more room to lay eggs and the hive population is becoming very congested. Under these conditions, a prime swarm may issue with the queen, resulting in a significant decrease in the population within the hive, leaving the old colony with a large number of hatching bees. The queen who leaves finds herself in a new hive with no eggs and no larvae but lots of energetic young bees who create a new set of brood combs from scratch in a very short time.

Another important factor in swarming is the age of the queen. Those under a year in age are unlikely to swarm unless they are extremely crowded, while older queens have swarming predisposition.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Some beekeepers may monitor their colonies carefully in spring and watch for the appearance of queen cells, which are a dramatic signal that the colony is determined to swarm.

When a colony has decided to swarm, queen cells are produced in numbers varying to a dozen or more. When the first of these queen cells is sealed after eight days of larval feeding, a virgin queen pupates and is due to emerge seven days later. Before leaving, the worker bees fill their stomachs with honey in preparation for the creation of new honeycombs in a new home. This cargo of honey also makes swarming bees less inclined to sting. A newly issued swarm is noticeably gentle for up to 24 hours and is often capable of being handled by a beekeeper without gloves or veil.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

[[File:Essaim d'abeilles posé.JPG|thumb|left|A swarm attached to a branch]]

This swarm looks for shelter. A beekeeper may capture it and introduce it into a new hive, helping meet this need. Otherwise, it returns to a [[feral]] state, in which case it finds shelter in a hollow tree, excavation, abandoned chimney, or even behind shutters.

Back at the original hive, the first virgin queen to emerge from her cell immediately seeks to kill all her rival queens still waiting to emerge. Usually, however, the bees deliberately prevent her from doing this, in which case, she too leads a second swarm from the hive. Successive swarms are called "after-swarms" or "casts" and can be very small, often with just a thousand or so bees—as opposed to a prime swarm, which may contain as many as ten to twenty-thousand bees.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

A small after-swarm has less chance of survival and may threaten the original hive's survival if the number of individuals left is unsustainable. When a hive swarms despite the beekeeper's preventative efforts, a good management practice is to give the reduced hive a couple frames of open brood with eggs. This helps replenish the hive more quickly and gives a second opportunity to raise a queen if there is a mating failure.

Each race or sub-species of honey bee has its own swarming characteristics. Italian bees are very prolific and inclined to swarm; Northern European black bees have a strong tendency to supersede their old queen without swarming. These differences are the result of differing evolutionary pressures in the regions where each sub-species evolved.

=== Artificial swarming ===
When a colony accidentally loses its queen, it is said to be "queenless". The workers realize that the queen is absent after as little as an hour, as her pheromones fade in the hive. The colony cannot survive without a fertile queen laying eggs to renew the population, so the workers select cells containing eggs aged less than three days and enlarge these cells dramatically to form "emergency queen cells". These appear similar to large peanut-like structures about an inch long that hang from the center or side of the brood combs. The developing larva in a queen cell is fed differently from an ordinary worker-bee; in addition to the normal honey and pollen, she receives a great deal of royal jelly, a special food secreted by young "nurse bees" from the hypopharyngeal gland. This special food dramatically alters the growth and development of the larva so that, after metamorphosis and pupation, it emerges from the cell as a queen bee. The queen is the only bee in a colony which has fully developed ovaries, and she secretes a pheromone which suppresses the normal development of ovaries in all her workers.

Beekeepers use the ability of the bees to produce new queens to increase their colonies in a procedure called ''splitting a colony''. To do this, they remove several brood combs from a healthy hive, taking care to leave the old queen behind. These combs must contain eggs or larvae less than three days old and be covered by young ''nurse bees'', which care for the brood and keep it warm. These brood combs and attendant nurse bees are then placed into a small "nucleus hive" with other combs containing honey and pollen. As soon as the nurse bees find themselves in this new hive and realize they have no queen, they set about constructing emergency queen cells using the eggs or larvae they have in the combs with them.

The common agents of disease that affect adult honey bees include [[Fungus|fungi]], [[bacteria]], [[protozoa]], [[virus]]es, [[parasitism|parasites]], and [[poison]]s. The gross symptoms displayed by affected adult bees are very similar, whatever the cause, making it difficult for the apiarist to ascertain the causes of problems without microscopic identification of microorganisms or chemical analysis of poisons.&lt;ref name="Grout"&gt;{{cite book|title=The hive and the honey bee: a new book on beekeeping which continues the tradition of "Langstroth on the hive and the honeybee"|editor=Grout, Roy A.|publisher=Dadant and Sons.|year=1949|page=607|chapter=Diseases of Adult bees|url=https://books.google.com/?id=K84OAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA607&amp;q=diseases%20of%20bees|accessdate=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2006 colony losses from [[Colony Collapse Disorder]] have been increasing across the world although the causes of the [[syndrome]] are, as yet, unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Renee|title= Honey Bee Colony Collapse Disorder|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://science.time.com/2013/05/07/beepocalypse-redux-honey-bees-are-still-dying-and-we-still-dont-know-why/|title=Beepocalypse Redux: Honeybees Are Still Dying — and We Still Don’t Know Why|last=Walsh|first=Bryan|date=7 May 2013|work=Time Science and Space|publisher=Time Inc|accessdate=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, commercial beekeepers have been increasing the number of hives to deal with higher rates of attrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Call off the bee-pocalypse: U.S. honeybee colonies hit a 20-year high|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/07/23/call-off-the-bee-pocalypse-u-s-honeybee-colonies-hit-a-20-year-high/|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 2015-07-23|access-date = 2015-12-01|issn = 0190-8286|language = en-US|first = Christopher|last = Ingraham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parasites ===
''[[Galleria mellonella]]'' and [[lesser wax moth|Achroia grisella]] “wax moth” larvae that hatch, tunnel through, and destroy comb that contains bee larvae and their honey stores. The tunnels they create are lined with silk, which entangles and starves emerging bees. Destruction of honeycombs also results in honey leaking and being wasted. A healthy hive can manage wax moths, but weak colonies, unoccupied hives, and stored frames can be decimated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kwadha|first=Charles A.|last2=Ong’amo|first2=George O.|last3=Ndegwa|first3=Paul N.|last4=Raina|first4=Suresh K.|last5=Fombong|first5=Ayuka T.|date=2017-06-09|title=The Biology and Control of the Greater Wax Moth, Galleria mellonella|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2075-4450/8/2/61|journal=Insects|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=61|doi=10.3390/insects8020061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Small hive beetle]] ''(Aethina tumida)'' is native to Africa but has now spread to most continents. It is a serious pest among honey bees unadapted to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hood|first=Michael|date=|year=2004|title=The small hive beetle, ''Aethina tumida'': a review|url=http://www.orsba.org/htdocs/download/SHB.pdf|deadurl=yes|journal=Bee World|volume=85|issue=3|pages=51–59|doi=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520220841/http://www.orsba.org/htdocs/download/SHB.pdf|archivedate=20 May 2014|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Varroa destructor]]'', the Varroa mite, is an established pest of two species of honey bee through many parts of the world, and is blamed by many researchers as a leading cause of CCD.&lt;ref name="Oliver, P1"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Oliver |first1=Randy |title=The Varroa Problem: Part 1  @  Scientific Beekeeping |url=http://scientificbeekeeping.com/the-varroa-problem-part-1/ |website=scientificbeekeeping.com |accessdate=14 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Acarapis woodi]]'', the tracheal mite, infests the trachea of honey bees.  The intensive management for Varroa has apparently reduced this parasite concurrently.

== World apiculture ==
According to [[Food and Agriculture Organization|U.N. FAO]] [http://www.fao.org/faostat data], the world's beehive stock rose from around 50 million in 1961 to around 83 million in 2014, which comes to about 1.3% average annual growth. Average annual growth has accelerated to 1.9% since 2009.

[[File:The Blackstone.jpg|thumb|right|The Black Stone is seen through a portal in the Kaaba]]
The '''Black Stone''' ({{lang-ar|ٱلْحَجَرُ ٱلْأَسْوَد}}, ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|al-Ḥajaru al-Aswad}}'', "Black Stone") is a rock set into the eastern corner of the [[Kaaba]], the ancient building located in the center of the [[Masjid al-Haram|Grand Mosque]] in [[Mecca]], [[Saudi Arabia]]. It is revered by Muslims as an [[Islam]]ic relic which, according to Muslim tradition, dates back to the time of [[Adam and Eve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Ar-Raheeq Al-Makhtum]] (The Sealed Nectar): Biography of the Prophet|author=Sheikh Safi-ur-Rehman al-Mubarkpuri|isbn=1-59144-071-8|year=2002|publisher=Dar-us-Salam Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stone was venerated at the Kaaba in pre-Islamic pagan times. According to Islamic tradition, it was set intact into the Kaaba's wall by the [[Prophets of Islam|prophet]] [[Muhammad]] in 605 CE, five years before his [[Muhammad's first revelation|first revelation]]. Since then it has been broken into fragments and is now cemented into a silver frame in the side of the Kaaba. Its physical appearance is that of a fragmented dark rock, polished smooth by the hands of pilgrims. Islamic tradition holds that it fell from heaven as a guide for Adam and Eve to build an altar. It has often been described as a [[meteorite]].&lt;ref name="Burke" /&gt;

Muslim pilgrims circle the Kaaba as a part of the ''[[tawaf]]'' ritual during the ''[[hajj]]'' and many try to stop and kiss the Black Stone, emulating the kiss that Islamic tradition records that it received from Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Your Door to Arabia|last=Elliott|first=Jeri|year=1992|isbn= 0-473-01546-3|publisher=R.

== Physical description ==
[[File:Black Stone front and side.PNG|thumb|right|The fragmented Black Stone as it appeared in the 1850s, front and side illustrations]]
The Black Stone was originally a single piece of rock but today consists of a number of fragmented pieces which have been cemented together. They are surrounded by a silver frame which is fastened by silver nails to the Kaaba's outer wall.&lt;ref name="bevan" /&gt; The fragments are themselves made up of smaller pieces which have been combined to form the seven or eight fragments visible today. The Stone's exposed face measures about {{convert|20|cm|in}} by {{convert|16|cm|in}}. Its original size is unclear and the recorded dimensions have changed considerably over time, as the pieces have been rearranged in their cement matrix on several occasions.&lt;ref name="Burke"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burke|first=John G.|title=Cosmic Debris: Meteorites in History|publisher=University of California Press|pages=221–223|year=1991|isbn=978-0-520-07396-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 10th century, an observer described the Black Stone as being one [[cubit]] ({{convert|46|cm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}}) long. By the early 17th century, it was recorded as measuring {{convert|1.40|by|1.22|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. According to [[Ali Bey]] in the 18th century, it was described as {{convert|110|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} high, and [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]] reported it as being {{convert|76|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|46|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} wide.&lt;ref name="Burke" /&gt;

The Black Stone is attached to the east corner of the Kaaba, known as ''al-Rukn al-Aswad'' (the Corner of the Black Stone).&lt;ref name="Ali2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ali|first=Maulana Muhammad|title=The Religion of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=etnEKz_rOfgC&amp;pg=PT351|date=25 July 2011|publisher=Ahmadiyya Anjuman Ishaat Islam Lahore USA|isbn=978-1-934271-18-6|page=351}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another stone, known as the ''Hajar as-Sa’adah'' (Stone of Felicity) is set into the Kaaba's opposite corner, ''al-Rukn al-Yamani'' (the Yemeni Corner), at a somewhat lower height than the Black Stone.&lt;ref name="GlasséSmith2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Glassé|first1=Cyril|last2=Smith|first2=Huston|title=The New Encyclopedia of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=focLrox-frUC&amp;pg=PA245|year=2003|publisher=Rowman Altamira|isbn=978-0-7591-0190-6|page=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; The choice of the east corner may have had ritual significance; it faces the rain-bringing east wind (''al-qabul'') and the direction from which [[Canopus]] rises.&lt;ref name="Al-Azmeh2017"&gt;{{cite book|last=Al-Azmeh|first=Aziz|title=The Emergence of Islam in Late Antiquity: Allah and His People|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xnU3DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA200|year=2017|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-316-64155-2|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The silver frame around the Black Stone and the black ''[[kiswah]]'' or cloth enveloping the Kaaba were for centuries maintained by the [[Ottoman Sultan]]s in their role as [[Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques]]. The frames wore out over time due to the constant handling by pilgrims and were periodically replaced. Worn-out frames were brought back to [[Istanbul]], where they are still kept as part of the [[Sacred Relics (Topkapı Palace)|sacred relics]] in the [[Topkapı Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The sacred trusts: Pavilion of the Sacred Relics, Topkapı Palace Museum|last=Aydın|first=Hilmi|publisher=Tughra Books|year=2004|isbn=978-1-932099-72-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appearance of the Black Stone===

The Black Stone was described by European travellers to Arabia in the 19th and early 20th centuries, who visited the Kaaba disguised as pilgrims. Swiss traveller [[Johann Ludwig Burckhardt]] visited Mecca in 1814, and provided a detailed description in his 1829 book ''Travels in Arabia'':

{{quote|text=It is an irregular oval, about seven inches [18&amp;nbsp;cm] in diameter, with an undulated surface, composed of about a dozen smaller stones of different sizes and shapes, well joined together with a small quantity of cement, and perfectly well smoothed; it looks as if the whole had been broken into as many pieces by a violent blow, and then united again. It is very difficult to determine accurately the quality of this stone which has been worn to its present surface by the millions of touches and kisses it has received. It appeared to me like a lava, containing several small extraneous particles of a whitish and of a yellow substance. Its colour is now a deep reddish brown approaching to black. It is surrounded on all sides by a border composed of a substance which I took to be a close cement of pitch and gravel of a similar, but not quite the same, brownish colour. This border serves to support its detached pieces; it is two or three inches in breadth, and rises a little above the surface of the stone. Both the border and the stone itself are encircled by a silver band, broader below than above, and on the two sides, with a considerable swelling below, as if a part of the stone were hidden under it. The lower part of the border is studded with silver nails.&lt;ref name="Burckhardt1829"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burckhardt|first=Johann Ludwig|title=Travels in Arabia, Comprehending an Account of Those Territories in Hedjaz which the Mohammedans Regard as Sacred|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u6hDAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA250|year=1829|publisher=Henry Colburn, New Burlington Street|page=250}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Visiting the Kaaba in 1853, [[Richard Francis Burton]] also noted that:

{{quote|text=The colour appeared to me black and metallic, and the centre of the stone was sunk about two inches below the metallic circle. Round the sides was a reddish-brown cement, almost level with the metal, and sloping down to the middle of the stone. The band is now a massive arch of gold or silver gilt. I found the aperture in which the stone is, one span and three fingers broad.&lt;ref name="Burton1856"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burton|first=Sir Richard Francis|title=Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to El-Medinah and Meccah|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lbVSx5zKcrEC&amp;pg=PA161|year=1856|publisher=Longman, Brown, Green, Longmans, and Roberts|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ritter von Laurin, the Austrian consul-general in Egypt, was able to inspect a fragment of the Stone removed by Muhammad Ali in 1817 and reported that it had a pitch-black exterior and a silver-grey, fine-grained interior in which tiny cubes of a bottle-green material were embedded. There are reportedly a few white or yellow spots on the face of the Stone, and it is officially described as being white with the exception of the face.&lt;ref name="Burke" /&gt;

The Black Stone was held in reverence well before the preaching of Islam by [[Muhammad]]. It had long been associated with the Kaaba, which was built in the pre-Islamic period and was a site of pilgrimage of [[Nabateans]] who visited the shrine once a year to perform their pilgrimage. The Kaaba held 360 idols of the Meccan gods.&lt;ref name=armstrong&gt;{{cite book|pages=11|title=[[Islam: A Short History]]|first=Karen|last=Armstrong|authorlink=Karen Armstrong|isbn=0-8129-6618-X|date=2 August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Semitic cultures]] of the Middle East [[Baetylus|had a tradition of using unusual stones to mark places of worship]], a phenomenon which is reflected in the [[Hebrew Bible]] as well as the [[Qur'an]],&lt;ref name="glasse" /&gt; although bowing to or kissing such sacred objects is repeatedly described in the [[Tanakh]] as [[idolatry|idolatrous]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0009_0_09475.html |title=The Biblical Injunction Against Idolatry | last = Rabinowitz | first = Louis |work= Encyclopaedia Judaica |date= 2008 | accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the subject of prophetic rebuke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kingjamesbible.com/B03C026.htm#V1|title=The Book of Leviticus, Chapter 26, verse 1|work=kingjamesbible.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kingjamesbible.com/B23C002.htm#V8 |title=The Book of Isaiah, Chapter 2, verse 9 |work=kingjamesbible.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kingjamesbible.com/B23C044.htm#V17 |title=The Book of Isaiah, Chapter 44 verse 17-18 |work=kingjamesbible.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kingjamesbible.com/B24C002.htm#V27 |title= The Book of Jeremiah, Chapter 2, verse 27|work=kingjamesbible.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kingjamesbible.com/B28C013.htm#V2| title= the Book of Hosea, chapter 13, verse 2|work=kingjamesbible.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kingjamesbible.com/B35C002.htm#V19 |title=The Book of Habakkuk chapter 2, verse 19 |work=kingjamesbible.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=September 2017|Reason=Primary religious sources}} The meteorite-origin theory of the Black Stone has seen it likened by some writers to the meteorite which was placed and worshipped in the Greek [[Temple of Artemis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert E.

A "red stone" was associated with the deity of the south Arabian city of Ghaiman, and there was a "white stone" in the Kaaba of al-Abalat (near the city of Tabala, south of Mecca).

=== Muhammad ===
According to Islamic belief Muhammad is credited with setting the Black Stone in the current place in the wall of the Kaaba. A story found in [[Ibn Ishaq]]'s ''[[Sirah Rasul Allah]]'' tells how the clans of Mecca renovated the Kaaba following a major fire which had partly destroyed the structure. The Black Stone had been temporarily removed to facilitate the rebuilding work. The clans could not agree on which one of them should have the honour of setting the Black Stone back in its place.&lt;ref name="Dairesi"&gt;{{cite book|title=The sacred trusts: Pavilion of the Sacred Relics, Topkapı Palace Museum, Istanbul|editor1=Uğurluel, Talha|editor2=Doğru, Ahmet|author1=Dairesi, Hırka-i Saadet|author2=Aydın, Hilmi|publisher=Tughra Books|year=2004|isbn=978-1-932099-72-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Al-A'zami"&gt;{{cite book|last=Al-A'zami|first=Muhammad Mustafa|year=2003|title=The History of The Qur'anic Text: From Revelation to Compilation: A Comparative Study with the Old and New Testaments|page=24|publisher=UK Islamic Academy|isbn=978-1-872531-65-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They decided to wait for the next man to come through the gate and ask him to make the decision. That person was 35-year-old Muhammad, five years before his prophethood. He asked the elders of the clans to bring him a cloth and put the Black Stone in its centre. Each of the clan leaders held the corners of the cloth and carried the Black Stone to the right spot.  Then, Muhammad set the stone in place, satisfying the honour of all of the clans.&lt;ref name="Dairesi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Al-A'zami" /&gt; After his [[Conquest of Mecca]] in 630, Muhammad is said to have ridden round the Kaaba seven times on his camel, touching the Black Stone with his stick in a gesture of reverence.&lt;ref name="Peters" /&gt;

===Desecrations===
The Stone has suffered repeated desecrations and damage over the course of time. It is said to have been struck and smashed to pieces by a stone fired from a catapult during the [[Umayyad Caliphate]]'s [[Siege of Mecca (683)|siege of Mecca]] in 683. The fragments were rejoined by [[Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr]] using a silver ligament.&lt;ref name="Dairesi" /&gt; In January 930, it was stolen by the [[Qarmatians]], who carried the Black Stone away to their base in Hajar (modern [[Eastern Arabia]]). According to Ottoman historian Qutb al-Din, writing in 1857, the Qarmatian leader [[Abu Tahir al-Jannabi]] set the Black Stone up in his own mosque, the ''Masjid al-Dirar'', with the intention of redirecting the ''hajj'' away from Mecca. This failed, as pilgrims continued to venerate the spot where the Black Stone had been.&lt;ref name="Peters"&gt;{{cite book|last=Peters|first=Francis E.|title=Mecca: a literary history of the Muslim Holy Land|pages=125–126|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |year=1994|isbn=978-0-691-03267-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the historian [[al-Juwayni]], the Stone was returned twenty-three years later, in 952. The Qarmatians held the Black Stone for ransom, and forced the Abbasids to pay a huge sum for its return. It was wrapped in a sack and thrown into the Friday Mosque of [[Kufa]], accompanied by a note saying "By command we took it, and by command we have brought it back." Its abduction and removal caused further damage, breaking the stone into seven pieces.&lt;ref name="glasse" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/islam/shia/qarma.html|title=Qarmatiyyah|publisher=St. Martin's College|work=Overview of World Religions|accessdate=4 May 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428055134/http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/islam/shia/qarma.html|archivedate=28 April 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/68328/Black-Stone-of-Mecca|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Black Stone of Mecca (Islam)|accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its abductor, Abu Tahir, is said to have met a terrible fate; according to Qutb al-Din, "the filthy Abu Tahir was afflicted with a gangrenous sore, his flesh was eaten away by worms, and he died a most terrible death". To protect the shattered stone, the custodians of the Kaaba commissioned a pair of Meccan goldsmiths to build a silver frame to surround it, and it has been housed within a similar frame ever since.&lt;ref name="Peters" /&gt;

In the 11th century, a man allegedly sent by the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] caliph [[al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]] attempted to smash the Black Stone but was killed on the spot, having caused only slight damage.&lt;ref name="Peters" /&gt; In 1674, according to [[Johann Ludwig Burckhardt]], someone smeared the Black Stone with excrement so that "every one who kissed it retired with a sullied beard". [[Twelver]]s from [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid Iran]] were suspected of being responsible and were the target of curses from other Muslims for centuries afterwards, though the  explorer Sir Richard Francis Burton doubted that they were the culprits; he attributed the act to "some Jew or Greek, who risked his life to gratify a furious bigotry".&lt;ref&gt;Burton, p. 394&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ritual role ==
[[File:Coveting the Black Stone.jpg|thumb|upright|Pilgrims jostle for a chance to kiss the Black Stone; if they are unable to kiss it, they can point towards it on each circuit with their right hand]]
The Black Stone plays a central role in the ritual of ''istilam'', when pilgrims kiss the Black Stone, touch it with their hands or raise their hands towards it while repeating the [[takbir]], "God is Greatest". They perform this in the course of walking seven times around the Kaaba in a counterclockwise direction (''[[tawaf]]''), emulating the actions of Muhammad. At the end of each circuit, they perform ''istilam'' and may approach the Black Stone to kiss it at the end of ''tawaf''.&lt;ref name="Curtis2013"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Ali|editor1-first=Saad|editor2-last=Nishino|editor2-first=Ko|editor3-last=Manocha|editor3-first=Dinesh|last1=Curtis|first1=Sean|last2=Guy|first2=Stephen J.|last3=Zafar|first3=Basim|last4=Manocha|first4=Dinesh|title=Modeling, Simulation and Visual Analysis of Crowds: A Multidisciplinary Perspective|chapter=Virtual Tawaf: A Velocity-Space-Based Solution for Simulating Heterogeneous Behavior in Dense Crowds|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ajm3BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA200|date=2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4614-8483-7|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times, large crowds make it practically impossible for everyone to kiss the stone, so it is currently acceptable to point in the direction of the Stone on each of their seven circuits around the Kaaba. Some even say that the Stone is best considered simply as a marker, useful in keeping count of the ritual circumambulations  that one has performed.&lt;ref name="The Saudi Arabia Information Resource"&gt;{{cite web|author=The Saudi Arabia Information Resource|title=The Holy City of Makkah|publisher=|accessdate=12 August 2006|url= http://www.saudinf.com/main/a83.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''Dawn in Madinah: A Pilgrim's Progress'', [[Muzaffar Iqbal]] described his experience of venerating the Black Stone during a pilgrimage to Mecca:

{{quote|At the end of the second [circumambulation of the Kaaba], I was granted one of those extraordinary moments which sometimes occur around the Black Stone. As I approached the Corner the large crowd was suddenly pushed back by a strong man who had just kissed the Black Stone. This push generated a backward current, creating a momentary opening around the Black Stone as I came to it; I swiftly accepted the opportunity reciting, ''Bismillahi Allahu akbar wa lillahi-hamd'' ["In the name of God, God is great, all praise to God"], put my hands on the Black Stone and kissed it. Thousands of silver lines sparkled, the Stone glistened, and something stirred deep inside me. A few seconds passed. Then I was pushed away by the guard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Iqbal|first=Muzaffar|title=Dawn in Madinah: A Pilgrim's Progress|page=21|publisher=The Other Press|year=2007|isbn=978-983-9154-92-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Black Stone and the Kaaba's opposite corner, ''al-Rukn al-Yamani'', are both often perfumed by the mosque's custodians. This can cause problems for pilgrims in the state of [[ihram]] ("consecration"), who are forbidden from using scented products and will require a ''[[Fidyah and Kaffara|kaffara]]'' (donation) as a penance if they touch either.&lt;ref name="HamShams2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ham|first1=Anthony|last2=Shams|first2=Martha Brekhus|last3=Madden|first3=Andrew|title=Saudi Arabia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PddTr1X7hEgC&amp;pg=PA75|year=2004|publisher=Lonely Planet Publications|isbn=978-1-74059-667-1|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Meaning and symbolism ==
[[File:Mosquée Masjid el Haram à la Mecque.jpg|thumb|The [[Kaaba]] in Mecca. The Black Stone is set into the eastern corner of the building.]]
Islamic tradition holds that the Black Stone fell from [[Jannah]] to show [[Adam and Eve]] where to build an altar, which became the first temple on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;''Muhammad'', Martin Lings, Chapter 1. The House of God&lt;/ref&gt;
Muslims believe that the stone was originally pure and dazzling white, but has since turned black because of the sins of the people who touch it.&lt;ref&gt;Saying of the Prophet, Collection of [[Tirmizi]],  VII, 49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Shaykh Tabarsi]], ''Tafsir'', vol. 1, pp. 460, 468. Quoted in translation by Francis E. Peters, ''Muhammad and the Origins of Islam'', p. 5. [[SUNY Press]], 1994. {{ISBN|0-7914-1876-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its black colour is deemed to symbolize the essential spiritual virtue of detachment and poverty for God (''[[faqr]]'') and the extinction of ego required to progress towards God (''[[qalb]]'').&lt;ref name="glasse" /&gt;

According to a prophetic tradition, "Touching them both (the Black Stone and ''al-Rukn al-Yamani'') is an expiation for sins."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = ibn Isa at-Tirmidhi | first = Muhammad | title = Jami` at-Tirmidhi: Book of Hajj
 | volume = 2nd, Hadith 959}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam's altar and the stone were said to have been lost during [[Noah]]'s [[Great Flood|Flood]] and forgotten. [[Abraham|Ibrahim]] (Abraham) was said to have later found the Black Stone at the original site of Adam's altar when the angel [[Jibrail]] revealed it to him.&lt;ref name="glasse"&gt;Cyril Glasse, ''New Encyclopedia of Islam'', p. 245. Rowman Altamira, 2001. {{ISBN|0-7591-0190-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ibrahim ordered his son [[Ishmael|Ismael]] – who in Muslim belief is an ancestor of Muhammad – to build a new temple, the Kaaba, into which the stone was to be embedded.

Another tradition says that the Black Stone was originally an angel that had been placed by God in the [[Garden of Eden]] to guard Adam. The angel was absent when Adam ate the [[forbidden fruit]] and was punished by being turned into a jewel — the Black Stone. God granted it the power of speech and placed it at the top of Abu Qubays, a mountain in the historic region of [[Khurasan]], before moving the mountain to Mecca. When Ibrahim took the Black Stone from Abu Qubays to build the Kaaba, the mountain asked Ibrahim to intercede with God so that it would not be returned to Khurasan and would stay in Mecca.&lt;ref name="Kister"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Adam: a Study of Some Legends in ''Tafsir'' and ''Hadit'' Literature|journal=Israel Oriental Studies|number=13|year=1993|publisher=E.J. Brill|isbn=9004099018|pages=113–174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some scholars, the Black Stone was the same stone that Islamic tradition describes as greeting Muhammad before his prophethood. This led to a debate about whether the Black Stone's greeting comprised actual speech or merely a sound, and following that, whether the stone was a living creature or an inanimate object. Whichever was the case, the stone was held to be a symbol of prophethood.&lt;ref name="Kister" /&gt;

A [[hadith]] records that, when the second [[Caliph]] [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]] (580–644) came to kiss the stone, he said in front of all assembled: "No doubt, I know that you are a stone and can neither harm anyone nor benefit anyone. Had I not seen Allah's Messenger [Muhammad] kissing you, I would not have kissed you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=University of Southern California|title=Pilgrimage (Hajj)|publisher=|accessdate=12 August 2006|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/026.sbt.html#002.026.667|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830145427/http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/026.sbt.html#002.026.667|archivedate=30 August 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the hadith collection [[Kanz al-Ummal]], it is recorded that [[Ali]] responded to Umar, saying, "This stone (Hajar Aswad) can indeed benefit and harm. ... Allah says in Quran that he created human beings from the progeny of Adam and made them witness over themselves and asked them, 'Am I not your creator?' Upon this, all of them confirmed it. Thus Allah wrote this confirmation. And this stone has a pair of eyes, ears and a tongue and it opened its mouth upon the order of Allah, who put that confirmation in it and ordered to witness it to all those worshippers who come for Hajj."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=ibn Abd-al-Malik al-Hindi|first=Ali|title=Kanz al-Ummal|year=1998|location=Lebanon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Muhammad Labib al-Batanuni]], writing in 1911, commented on the practice that the pre-Islamic practice of venerating stones (including the Black Stone) arose not because such stones are "sacred for their own sake, but because of their relation to something holy and respected".&lt;ref name="Lazarus-Yafeh"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lazarus-Yafeh|first=Hava|title=Some religious aspects of Islam: a collection of articles|pages=120–124|publisher=Brill|year=1981|location=Leiden|isbn=978-90-04-06329-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Indian Islamic scholar [[Muhammad Hamidullah]] summed up the meaning of the Black Stone:

{{quote|[T]he Prophet has named the (Black Stone) the "right hand of God" (''yamin-Allah''), and for purpose. In fact one poses there one's hand to conclude the pact, and God obtains there our pact of allegiance and submission.  In the qur'anic terminology, God is the king, and ... in (his) realm there is a metropolis (''Umm al-Qurra'') and in the metropolis naturally a palace (''Bait-Allah'', home of God). If a subject wants to testify to his loyalty, he has to go to the royal palace and conclude personally the pact of allegiance. The right hand of the invisible God must be visible symbolically. And that is the ''al-Hajar al-Aswad'', the Black Stone in the Ka'bah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shenk|first=David W.|title=Journeys of the Muslim nation and the Christian church: exploring the mission of two communities|page=161|publisher=Uzima Publishing House|year=2006|isbn=978-9966-855-21-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In recent years several literalist views of the Black Stone have emerged.  A small minority accepts as literally true a hadith, usually taken as allegorical, which asserts that "the Stone will appear on the Day of Judgement ([[Qiyamah]]) with eyes to see and a tongue to speak, and give evidence in favour of all who kissed it in true devotion, but speak out against whoever indulged in gossip or profane conversations during his circumambulation of the Kaaba".&lt;ref name="Lazarus-Yafeh" /&gt;

== Scientific origins ==
The nature of the Black Stone has been much debated. It has been described variously as [[basalt]] stone, an [[agate]], a piece of natural [[glass]] or—most popularly—a stony [[meteorite]]. {{ill|Paul Partsch|de|Paul Partsch}}, the curator of the [[Austro-Hungarian]] imperial collection of minerals, published the first comprehensive analysis of the Black Stone in 1857 in which he favoured a meteoritic origin for the Stone.&lt;ref name="partsch"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Partsch|first=Paul Maria|title=Über den schwarzen Stein der Kaaba zu Mekka, mitgetheilt aus den hinterlassenen Schriften des wirklichen Mitgliedens|journal=Denkschriften der mathematisch-naturwissenschaftlichen Classe der Kaiserlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Wien|issue=13|year=1857|publisher=Erste Abtheilung|pages=1–5|url=http://www.landesmuseum.at/pdf_frei_remote/DAKW_13_1_0001-0005.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Dietz and John McHone proposed in 1974 that the Black Stone was actually an agate, judging from its physical attributes and a report by an Arab geologist that the Stone contained clearly discernible diffusion banding characteristic of agates.&lt;ref name="Burke" /&gt;

A significant clue to its nature is provided by an account of the Stone's recovery in 951 AD after it had been stolen 21 years earlier; according to a chronicler, the Stone was identified by its ability to float in water. If this account is accurate, it would rule out the Black Stone being an agate, a basalt lava or a stony meteorite, though it would be compatible with it being glass or [[pumice]].&lt;ref name="bevan"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Alex|last1=Bevan|first2=John|last2=De Laeter|title=Meteorites: A Journey Through Space and Time|pages=14–15|publisher=UNSW Pres|year=2002|isbn=0-86840-490-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsebeth Thomsen of the [[University of Copenhagen]] proposed a different hypothesis in 1980. She suggested that the Black Stone may be a glass fragment or [[impactite]] from the impact of a fragmented meteorite that fell 6,000 years ago at [[Wabar craters|Wabar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1980Metic..15...87T|title=New Light on the Origin of the Holy Black Stone of the Ka'ba''|last=Thomsen|first=E.|journal=Meteoritics|volume=15|number=1|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; a site in the [[Rub' al Khali]] desert 1,100&amp;nbsp;km east of Mecca. A 2004 scientific analysis of the Wabar site suggests that the impact event happened much more recently than first thought and might have occurred within the last 200–300 years.&lt;ref name="Prescott2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prescott|first1=J. R.|title=Luminescence dating of the Wabar meteorite craters, Saudi Arabia|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|volume=109|issue=E1|year=2004|issn=0148-0227|doi=10.1029/2003JE002136|bibcode=2004JGRE..109.1008P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The meteoritic hypothesis is viewed by geologists as doubtful. The British [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] suggests that it may be a pseudometeorite, in other words a terrestrial rock mistakenly attributed to a meteoritic origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Catalogue of meteorites: with special reference to those represented in the collection of the Natural History Museum, London|volume=1|page=263|editor=Grady, Monica M.|author1=Grady, Monica M.|author2=Graham, A.L.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-521-66303-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Black stone has never been analysed with modern scientific techniques and its origins remain the subject of speculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=oiTNCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT68&amp;dq=Wabar+meteorite+craters+black+stone&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiDxMmB4r_cAhUCIVAKHaVgC3AQ6AEINzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Wabar%20meteorite%20craters%20black%20stone&amp;f=false|title=Meteorite: Nature and Culture|last=Golia|first=Maria|date=2015-10-15|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=9781780235479|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Canadian Mosaic''''' was a book by [[John Murray Gibbon]], published in 1938.  Gibbon's book, the full title of which was '''''Canadian Mosaic: The Making of a Northern Nation''''', heralded a new way of thinking about immigrants that was to shape [[Canada|Canadian]] immigration policy in the latter part of the Twentieth century.  The idea of a mosaic, in which each cultural group retained a distinct identity and still contributed to the nation as a whole, was in contrast to the [[melting pot]], a popular metaphor for the more assimilationist American approach to immigration.

The idea of a mosaic of cultures forming a nation was adopted by Canadian sociologist [[John Porter (sociologist)|John Porter]] in his study of social class, entitled: ''Vertical Mosaic: An Analysis of Social Class and Power in Canada''.  The mosaic theme became a part of Canadian [[multiculturalism]] policy in the 1970s, which envisioned Canada as a "[[cultural mosaic]]".

'''Colorado Group Limited''' was an Australian public company that operates a number of retail clothing chains. Major brands include Colorado Adventurewear, Mathers, Williams the Shoemen, JAG, Diana Ferrari, and Pairs. The company is based in [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]] with an office in [[Cremorne, Victoria]]. The history of the company dates back over 140 years to the 1864 founding of Williams in [[Ballarat, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=corp_hist&gt;[http://www.coloradogroup.com.au/content.aspx?pageID=20&amp;mainID=18 "Corporate History"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20080718180142/http://www.coloradogroup.com.au/content.aspx?pageID=20&amp;mainID=18 |date=2008-07-18 }} www.coloradogroup.com.

The '''Cori''' (Chori) language is a minor [[Plateau languages|Plateau language]] spoken in a single village in [[Kaduna State]] in [[Nigeria]].

==Tone==
Cori is known for having six distinct levels of [[tone (linguistics)|tone]], too many to transcribe using the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], which allows five. However, there are only three underlying tones: 1 ({{sm|top}}), 4 ({{sm|mid}}), and 6 ({{sm|bottom}}), which are all that need to be written for literacy. Most cases of Tone 2 ({{sm|high}}) are a result of [[tone sandhi]], with 4 becoming 2 before 1. Tones 3 ({{sm|mid-high}}) and 5 ({{sm|low}}) can be analysed as [[contour tone]]s, with underlying {{IPA|/1͡6/}} realised as {{IPA|[3]}} and {{IPA|/2͡6/}} realised as {{IPA|[5]}}.

In order to transcribe the surface tones without numerals (which are ambiguous), an extra diacritic is needed, as is common for four-level languages in Central America:  
:'''1''' {{IPA|[ő]}} ({{sm|top}})
:2 {{IPA|[ó]}} ({{sm|high}})
:3 {{IPA|[o̍]}} ({{sm|mid-high}})
:'''4''' {{IPA|[ō]}} ({{sm|mid}})
:5 {{IPA|[ò]}} ({{sm|low}})
:'''6''' {{IPA|[ȍ]}} ({{sm|bottom}})

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3114">A '''cultural footprint''' is the impact that a group or individual has on the cultural environment.

== Definition ==
“Cultural footprint”&lt;ref&gt;The term was first used in work launched by the association Diversum (“Mesurer et améliorer son empreinte culturelle : nouvelle thématique du développement durable” [“Measuring and Improving One’s Cultural Footprint: The New Topic in Sustainable Development”], Jérôme Gouadain’s contribution to the [https://www.observatoireplurilinguisme.eu/fr/les-actions/assises-berlin-juin-2009-fr-fr-6-1/88888966--sp-161/2207-programme-et-contributions 2nd European Conference on Plurilingualism], Berlin, 19 June 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; was defined in June 2013, at the initiative of a group of experts from [[UNESCO]], the [[OECD]], the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|International Organisation of the Francophonie]], French ministries, various companies and civil society.

They explained it as “all of the externalities, both positive and negative, generated in the cultural environment by agents’ actions”. It is considered to be positive when it enriches [[cultural diversity]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diversum.net/fichiers/File/The%20purple%20economy,%20an%20objective,%20an%20opportunity.pdf Conclusions of the first inter-institutional working group on the purple economy]&lt;/ref&gt; or fosters cultural intensity.&lt;ref name=diversum20170630&gt;[http://diversum.net/fr/association/a.php?t=document-de-reference&amp;id=74presse “The Cultural Footprint of the Cosmetic Sector”] (accessed 24 September 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

A second reference document published in 2017 specified that “all actors have the possibility of activating (i.e. exploring and utilizing) available cultural resources. At the same time, it is their responsibility to make a positive contribution” to that sub-stratum, to that creative atmosphere. This means that groups and individuals must “set requirements for themselves, engage based on their own singularities, and be culturally involved and invested”.

== Applications ==
“The Cultural Footprint of the Cosmetic Sector”&lt;ref name=diversum20170630/&gt; is a document to which Gilles Andrier, Loïc Armand, Francesco Bandarin, Jérôme Bédier, Françoise Benhamou, Fouad Benseddik, Gilles Boëtsch, [[Dominique Bourg]], Jérôme Gouadain, Maria Gravari-Barbas, Marc-Antoine Jamet, [[François Jullien]], [[Pascal Lamy]], [[Jacques Lévy]], [[Gilles Lipovetsky]], Françoise Montenay, Jean Musitelli, Patrick O’Quin, Philippe d’Ornano, [[Dominique Perrault]], Marie-Hélène Plainfossé and Nicole Rouvet contributed. It suggests several aspects of the cultural environment where economics might be able to make a contribution: architecture, art, colours, enjoyment, ethics, heritage, imagination, learning, social skills, singularity, etc.

'''Druon Antigoon''' is a Flemish folkloric character. He was a mythical [[giant (mythology)|giant]] who lived in [[Antwerp]].

[[File:Antwerpen-Brabo.JPG|thumb|alt=The statue of the Brabo throwing the severed hand of Antigoon|The Brabo fountain, in Antwerp. Brabo throws the severed hand of Antigoon into the Scheldt. Sculpture by [[Jef Lambeaux]] (in 1887)]]

Guarding a bridge on the [[Scheldt|river Scheldt]], he exacted a toll from those crossing the river. For those who refused, he severed one of their hands and threw it into the river. Eventually, Antigoon was slain by a young [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] soldier named [[Silvius Brabo|''Brabo'']], who cut off the giant's own hand and flung it into the river.

According to [[folklore]], and as celebrated by the [[statue]] in front of the [[City and town halls|town hall]], this legend is the origin of the name ''Antwerp'': ''Antwerpen'', from [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''hand werpen''—akin to Old English ''hand'' and ''wearpan'' (= to throw), that has changed to today's ''warp''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belgiumview.com/belgiumview/tl1/view0000599.php4 Brabo Antwerpen 1 (centrum) / Antwerpen] {{nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''''Durarara!!'''''|デュラララ!!}}, often shortened to '''''DRRR!!''''', is a Japanese [[light novel]] series written by [[Ryohgo Narita]], with illustrations by [[Suzuhito Yasuda]], that has also been adapted into a Japanese [[anime series]]. ''Durarara!!'' tells the story of a [[dullahan]] working as an underworld courier in [[Ikebukuro]], an internet-based anonymous gang called the Dollars, and the chaos that unfolds around the most dangerous people in Ikebukuro. The series ran for thirteen volumes, published by [[ASCII Media Works]] under their [[Dengeki Bunko]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]].

A [[manga]] adaptation by Akiyo Satorigi started serialization in the [[Shōnen manga|shōnen]] [[List of manga magazines|manga magazine]] ''[[Monthly GFantasy]]'' on April 18, 2009. An [[anime]] adaptation began airing in Japan in January 2010.&lt;ref name="videoclip"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-11-20/durarara-fumihiko-sori-to-video-clips-streamed|title=''Durarara'', Fumihiko Sori's ''To'' Video Clips Streamed|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=November 20, 2009|accessdate=November 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014, a sequel series titled {{Nihongo|''Durarara!! SH''|デュラララ!! SH|Durarara!! SH}} and set two years after the events of the original series started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-01-18/durarara-novels-change-title-with-2-year-jump-in-story|title=''Durarara!!'' Gets New TV Anime Series|date=January 18, 2014|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=May 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two games based on the series for the [[PlayStation Portable]] were released, and two games for [[PlayStation Vita]] were released later.

==Plot==
{{main|List of Durarara!! characters}}
Mikado Ryūgamine, a young boy who longs for the exciting life of the big city, moves to [[Ikebukuro]] to attend Raira Academy with his childhood friend Masaomi Kida, whom he has not seen since he was young. After the two meet at the train station, they set out to explore the streets of Ikebukuro. Masaomi warns Mikado about people he does not want to cross in the city such as the violent and superhumanly strong man Shizuo Heiwajima, the information broker Izaya Orihara, and the mysterious gang known as "The Dollars." After running into some of the side characters, Mikado sees a local legend called the "Black Rider" who rides around Ikebukuro on a black motorcycle that occasionally neighs like a horse and who is rumored to have no head under her helmet. The "Black Rider's" real name is Celty Sturluson; she is an Irish [[dullahan]] who is in Ikebukuro looking for her stolen head while working as an underworld courier. The narrative follows all of the characters equally, showing how their lives intersect and create a greater plot line from each character's knowledge about a common incident.

The story is told from the perspective of approximately eleven of the main characters and changes every episode in the anime, sometimes even more often. One of the few constants given in every episode is that the narrator gives their own opinion on the current situation that they are in as well as what things that make them tick and keep them going in Ikebukuro: a city with a large underbelly that is the medium for the majority of both the plot's development and random violence throughout the series.

==Development==
Although it has commonly been claimed that the title "Durarara" is an [[onomatopoeia]] for the "revving of an engine," Narita states specifically in the first light novel volume that the name means absolutely nothing. He had been editing the finished draft of his book, when his editor called. When prompted for a title, Narita "...just randomly gave a name, 'Du...Durarara?'" Upon hearing this, his editor responded with a positive remark as he liked ambiguous titles."&lt;ref name="differentclouds.livejournal.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://differentclouds.livejournal.com/16825.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150111155001/http://differentclouds.livejournal.com/16825.html |archivedate=2015-01-11 |df= }} English Translation of the First Light Novel&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
According to [[Oricon]], the ninth volume of ''Durarara!!'' was the first to sell the most over a week in its [[bunkobon]] for February 7–13; previously, the highest-ranked ''DRRR!!'' volume had been the eighth, which ranked second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-02-16/durarara-scores-1st-weekly-no.1-with-9th-volume|title=Durarara!!

'''''Final Fantasy X'''''{{efn|{{nihongo|ファイナルファンタジーX|Fainaru Fantajī Ten}} in Japanese}} is a [[role-playing video game]] developed and published by [[Square (company)|Square]] as the tenth entry in the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series. Originally released in 2001 for [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony's]] [[PlayStation 2]], the game was re-released as ''[[Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster]]'' for [[PlayStation 3]] and [[PlayStation Vita]] in 2013, for [[PlayStation 4]] in 2015, [[Microsoft Windows]] in 2016, and  will be released for the [[Nintendo Switch]] and [[Xbox One]] in 2019. The game marks the ''Final Fantasy'' series transition from entirely [[pre-rendered]] backdrops to fully [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] areas, and is also the first in the series to feature [[voice acting]]. ''Final Fantasy X'' replaces the [[Gameplay of Final Fantasy|Active Time Battle]] (ATB) system with the "Conditional Turn-Based Battle" (CTB) system, and uses a new leveling system called the "Sphere Grid".

Set in the fantasy world of [[Spira (Final Fantasy)|Spira]], a setting influenced by the [[Australasia|South Pacific]], [[Thailand]] and [[Japan]],&lt;ref name="producer" /&gt; the game's story revolves around a group of adventurers and their quest to defeat a rampaging monster known as Sin. The [[player character]] is [[Tidus]], a star athlete in the fictional sport of blitzball, who finds himself in the world Spira after his home city of Zanarkand is destroyed by Sin. Shortly after arriving to Spira, Tidus joins the [[Final Fantasy character classes#Summoner|summoner]] [[Yuna (Final Fantasy)|Yuna]] on her pilgrimage to destroy Sin.

Development of ''Final Fantasy X'' began in 1999, with a budget of more than US$32.3 million (US${{Inflation|US|32.3|1999|r=1}}&amp;nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars) and a team of more than 100 people. The game was the first in the main series not entirely scored by Nobuo Uematsu; Masashi Hamauzu and Junya Nakano were signed as Uematsu's fellow composers. ''Final Fantasy X'' was both a critical and commercial success, selling over 8 million units worldwide.&lt;ref name="8M"&gt;[http://jp.ign.com/square-enix/17748/opinion/ffdqrpg] (PS2: 8M+) IGN Japan&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely considered to be one of [[List of video games considered the best|the greatest video games of all time]]. On March 3, 2003, it was followed by ''[[Final Fantasy X-2]]'', making it the first ''Final Fantasy'' game to have a direct game sequel.

==Gameplay==
Like previous games in the series, ''Final Fantasy X'' is presented in a third-person perspective, with players directly navigating the main character, Tidus, around the world to interact with objects and people. Unlike previous games, however, the world and town maps have been fully integrated, with terrain outside of cities rendered to scale. As Tidus explores the world, he randomly encounters enemies. When an enemy is encountered, the environment switches to a [[turn-based strategy|turn-based]] battle area where characters and enemies await their turn to attack.&lt;ref name="EuroG"/&gt;

The gameplay of ''Final Fantasy X'' differs from that of previous ''Final Fantasy'' games in its lack of a [[top-down perspective]] [[overworld|world map]]. Earlier games featured a miniature representation of the expansive areas between towns and other distinct locations, used for long-distance traveling. In ''Final Fantasy X'', almost all the locations are essentially continuous and never fade out to a world map. Regional connections are mostly linear, forming a single path through the game's locations, though an [[airships in video games|airship]] becomes available late in the game, giving the player the ability to navigate Spira faster. Like previous games in the series, ''Final Fantasy X'' features numerous [[minigame]]s, most notably the fictional underwater sport "blitzball".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/134/134008p1.html |title=Final Fantasy X Preview |work=IGN |publisher=News Corporation |first=Dave |last=Zdyrko |date=November 26, 2001 |accessdate=December 14, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509063418/http://ps2.ign.com/articles/134/134008p1.html |archivedate=May 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combat===
[[File:FFXbattleexample.png|thumb|left|A [[boss (video games)|boss]] battle using a [[HUD (video gaming)|heads-up display]] to illustrate battle information]]

''Final Fantasy X'' introduces the ''Conditional Turn-Based Battle'' system in place of the series' traditional ''Active Time Battle'' system first used in ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]''. Whereas the ATB concept features real-time elements, the CTB system is a turn-based format that pauses the battle during each of the player's turns. Thus, the CTB design allows the player to select an action without time pressure.&lt;ref name="GSpy" /&gt; A graphical timeline along the upper-right side of the screen details who will be receiving turns next, and how various actions taken will affect the subsequent order of turns. The ordering of turns can be affected by a number of spells, items, and abilities that inflict status effects upon the controlled characters or the enemies.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-x/1100-2798161/|title=Final Fantasy X|last=Vestal|first=Andrew|date=2003-04-28|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player can control up to three characters in battle, though a swapping system allows the player to replace them with a character outside the active party at any time. "[[Limit Break]]s", highly damaging special attacks, reappear in ''Final Fantasy X'' as "Overdrives". In this new incarnation of the feature, most of the techniques are interactive, requiring button inputs to increase their effectiveness. While initially the Overdrives can be used when the character receives a significant amount of damage, the player is able to modify the requirements to unlock them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/ff/ff10/reviews/ff10strev1.html |title=Final Fantasy X – Review |publisher=RPGamer |author=Tidwell, Mickel |accessdate=April 6, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621054222/http://www.rpgamer.com/games/ff/ff10/reviews/ff10strev1.html |archivedate=June 21, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Final Fantasy X'' introduces an overhaul of the summoning system employed in previous games of the series. Whereas in previous titles a summoned creature would arrive, perform one action, and then depart, the "Aeons" of ''Final Fantasy X'' arrive and entirely replace the battle party, fighting in their place until either the aeon wins the battle, is defeated itself, or is dismissed by the player. Aeons have their own [[statistic (role-playing games)|statistics]], commands, special attacks, spells, and Overdrives. The player acquires five aeons over the course of the game through the completion of Cloister of Trials puzzles, but three additional aeons can be obtained by completing various [[quest (gaming)|side-quests]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Sphere Grid===
[[File:Sphere Grid FFX.jpg|thumb|left|Example of a Sphere Grid]]

As with previous titles in the series, players have the opportunity to develop and improve their characters by defeating enemies and acquiring items, though the traditional [[experience point]] system is replaced by a new system called the "Sphere Grid". Instead of characters gaining pre-determined statistic bonuses for their attributes after [[Levels up|leveling up]], each character gains "Sphere Levels" after collecting enough Ability Points (AP). Sphere Levels allow players to move around the Sphere Grid, a pre-determined grid of interconnected nodes consisting of various statistic and ability bonuses. "Spheres" are applied to these nodes, unlocking its function for the selected character.&lt;ref name="GSpy" /&gt;

The Sphere Grid system also allows players to fully customize characters in contrast to their intended battle roles, such as turning the [[Final Fantasy character classes#White Mage|White Mage]]-roled Yuna into a physical powerhouse and the [[swordsman]] Auron into a healer. The ''International'' and [[PAL region|PAL]] versions of the game include an optional "Expert" version of the Sphere Grid; in these versions, all of the characters start in the middle of the grid and may follow whichever path the player chooses. As a trade-off, the Expert grid has fewer nodes in total, thus decreasing the total statistic upgrades available during the game.&lt;ref name="International"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgfan.com/reviews/finalfantasy10-intl/index.html |title=Final Fantasy X International |publisher=RPGFan |first=James Quentin |last=Clark |date=October 6, 2008 |accessdate=November 23, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211012751/http://www.rpgfan.com/reviews/finalfantasy10-intl/index.html |archivedate=December 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Blitzball ===
Blitzball is a minigame that requires strategy and tactics. The underwater sport is played in a large, hovering sphere of water surrounded by a larger audience of onlookers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The player controls one character at a time as they swim through the sphere performing passes, tackles, and attempts to score. The gameplay is similar to that of the main game in the way that the controlled character moves through the area until they encounter an enemy. In this case, the enemy is a member of the opposing team. Status effects are also implemented in the minigame as each player can learn techniques that are equivalent to abilities in the main game.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-x-review/1900-2832771/|title=Final Fantasy X Review|last=Kasavin|first=Greg|date=2001-12-14|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blitzball is first introduced in the beginning of the game during one of the early cinematic sequences in which Tidus, the main character who is described as a star blitzball player, is part of an intense game. It is the only minigame that plays a role in the overall plot line as it is not only a main part of Tidus's character, but it's also in the first scene where the game's main antagonist, Sin is shown.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Unlike with the other minigames, playing blitzball is mandatory near the beginning of the game, but it is later optional.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Setting and characters===
{{main|Spira (Final Fantasy)|Characters of Final Fantasy X and X-2}}
''Final Fantasy X'' is set in the fictional world of Spira, consisting of one large landmass divided into three subcontinents, surrounded by small tropical islands. It features diverse climates, ranging from the tropical Besaid and Kilika islands, to the temperate Mi'ihen region, to the frigid Macalania and Mt. Gagazet areas. Although predominantly populated by [[human]]s, Spira features a variety of races. Among them are the Al Bhed, a technologically advanced but disenfranchised sub-group of humans with distinctive green eyes and unique language.&lt;ref name=aftersalvage /&gt;&lt;ref name=blame /&gt; The Guado, which are less human in appearance, with elongated fingers and other [[arboreal]] features. Still less human are the [[lion]]-like Ronso and the [[frog]]-like Hypello. A subset of Spira's sentient races are the "unsent", the strong-willed spirits of the dead that remain in corporeal form. In Spira, the dead who are not sent to the Farplane by a summoner come to envy the living and transform into "[[Four Fiends|fiends]]", the monsters that are encountered throughout the game;&lt;ref name=sending /&gt; however, unsent with strong attachments to the world of the living may retain their human form. Other fauna in Spira, aside from those drawn from real animals, such as cats, dogs, birds, and butterflies, include the gigantic, amphibious shoopufs (which are similar to [[elephant]]s); and the [[emu]]-like [[chocobo]], which appears in most ''Final Fantasy'' games. Spira is very different from the mainly European-style worlds found in previous ''Final Fantasy'' games, being much more closely modeled on [[Southeast Asia]], most notably with respect to vegetation, topography, architecture, and names.&lt;ref name=producer /&gt;

There are seven main [[player character|playable characters]] in ''Final Fantasy X'', starting with Tidus, a cheerful young teenager and a star blitzball player from Zanarkand, who seeks a way home after an encounter with Sin transported him to Spira.&lt;ref name=aftersalvage /&gt; To do so, he joins Yuna, a summoner on a journey to obtain the Final Aeon and defeat the enormous whale-like "Sin".&lt;ref name="day of departure"/&gt; Journeying with them are: [[Kimahri Ronso]], a young warrior of the Ronso tribe who watched over Yuna during her childhood;&lt;ref name="kimarhi ronso"/&gt; [[Wakka (Final Fantasy)|Wakka]], a blitzball player whose younger brother was killed by Sin;&lt;ref name=wakka /&gt;&lt;ref name=chappu /&gt; and [[Lulu (Final Fantasy)|Lulu]], a [[Stoicism|stoic]] [[Final Fantasy character classes#Black Mage|black mage]] close to Yuna and Wakka.&lt;ref name="day of departure"/&gt; During the journey, they are joined by [[Āron|Auron]], a former warrior monk, who worked with both Tidus' and Yuna's fathers to defeat Sin 10 years prior;&lt;ref name="auron at luca"/&gt; and [[Rikku]], Yuna's cousin, a perky Al Bhed girl and the first friendly person Tidus meets upon arriving in Spira.&lt;ref name=aftersalvage /&gt;

===Story===
Tidus waits with his allies outside the ruins of an ancient city.&lt;!-- No one knows what city the ruins are from until later in the game. --&gt; He narrates the events that led to the present, spanning most of the game's storyline.&lt;ref name="introduction"/&gt; It begins in his home city, the high-tech metropolis of [[Spira (Final Fantasy)#Zanarkand|Zanarkand]], where he is a renowned blitzball player and son of the famous blitzball star, Jecht.&lt;ref name="commentary"/&gt; During a blitzball tournament, the city is attacked by an immense creature that Auron, a man not originally from Zanarkand, calls "Sin".&lt;ref name="sin"/&gt; Sin destroys Zanarkand and takes Tidus and Auron to the world of Spira.&lt;ref name="aftersalvage"/&gt;

Upon arriving in Spira, Tidus is rescued by Al Bhed salvagers, who speak a language that is foreign to Tidus.

==Development==
''Final Fantasy X''{{'}}s development began in 1999, costing approximately [[Japanese yen|¥]]4 billion (approximately [[United States dollar|US$]]{{Inflation|US|32.3|1999|r=1}}&amp;nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Long |first=Andrew |title=Financial Fantasy X |url=http://rpgamer.com/news/Q3-2001/071201c.html |publisher=RPGamer |accessdate=November 21, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206041703/http://www.rpgamer.com/news/Q3-2001/071201c.html |archivedate=February 6, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a crew of over 100 people, most of whom worked on previous games in the series. Executive producer [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]] has stated that although he had concerns about the transition from 2D to 3D backgrounds, the voice acting, and the transition to real-time story-telling, the success of the ''Final Fantasy'' series can be attributed to constantly challenging the development team to try new things.&lt;ref name="producer"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy X International |developer=Square |publisher=Square EA |date=December 20, 2001 |platform=PlayStation 2|level=Beyond Final Fantasy: Producer|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producer [[Yoshinori Kitase]] was also the chief director of ''Final Fantasy X'', while the direction of events, maps and battles was split up between [[Motomu Toriyama]], Takayoshi Nakazato and [[Toshiro Tsuchida]], respectively.&lt;ref name="dengekips"&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010413205127/http://www.coremagazine.com/news/3808.php3 | title=Interview: Final Fantasy X | publisher=Core Magazine | archivedate=April 13, 2001 | date=March 6, 2001| url=http://www.coremagazine.com/news/3808.php3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="enterbrain"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmcafe.com/news/news01-9-01.htm |title=Interview with Final Fantasy X Developers |publisher=The Madman's Cafe |accessdate=April 14, 2013 |date=January 19, 2001 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927000049/http://www.mmcafe.com/news/news01-9-01.htm |archivedate=September 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ultimaniaomega" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game | title=Final Fantasy X | platform=PlayStation 2 |developer=Square |publisher=Square |date=December 17, 2001 |scene=staff credits}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of the script for the game took three to four months, with the same amount of time dedicated to the voice recording afterwards.&lt;ref name="cvg"/&gt; [[Kazushige Nojima]] collaborated with [[Daisuke Watanabe]], Toriyama and Kitase on writing the scenario for ''Final Fantasy X''.&lt;ref name="ultimaniaomega"&gt;{{cite book | title=Final Fantasy X Ultimania Omega | publisher=Square Enix | pages=191–193, 476 | author=Studio BentStuff | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cvg" /&gt; Nojima was particularly concerned with establishing a connection in the relationship between player and main character. Thus, he penned the story such that the player's progress through the world and growing knowledge about it is reflected in Tidus' own understanding and narration.&lt;ref name="event"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy X International |developer=Square |publisher=Square EA |date=December 20, 2001 |platform=PlayStation 2|level=Beyond Final Fantasy: Event|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influences===
Character designer [[Tetsuya Nomura]] has identified the [[Australasia|South Pacific]], [[Thailand]] and Japan as major influences on the cultural and geographic design of Spira, particularly concerning the geographic location of the southern Besaid and Kilika islands. He has also said that Spira deviates from the worlds of past ''Final Fantasy'' games in the level of detail incorporated, something he has expressed to have made a conscious effort to maintain during the design process.&lt;ref name="character"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy X International |developer=Square |publisher=Square EA |date=December 20, 2001 |platform=PlayStation 2|level=Beyond Final Fantasy: Character|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kitase felt that if the setting went back to a medieval European fantasy, it would not seem to help the development team advance. While he was thinking of different world environments, Nojima suggested a fantasy world that incorporated Asian elements.&lt;ref name="producer"/&gt; Sub-character chief designer Fumi Nakashima's focus was to ensure that characters from different regions and cultures bore distinctive characteristics in their clothing styles, so that they could be quickly and easily identified as members of their respective sub-groups. For example, she has said that the masks and goggles of the Al Bhed give the group a "strange and eccentric" appearance, while the attire of the Ronso lend to them being able to easily engage in battle.&lt;ref name="producer"/&gt; Tidus' relationship with his father Jecht was based "stories throughout the ages, such as the ancient Greek legends." This would eventually reveal the key of Sin's weakness and eventual defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamestm.co.uk/features/final-fantasy-10-kitase-reveals-the-secrets-of-its-success/ |title=Final Fantasy 10: Kitase reveals the secrets of its success |publisher=Gamestm |date=February 27, 2014 |accessdate=March 3, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6lqGuU6Wh?url=https://www.gamestm.co.uk/features/final-fantasy-10-kitase-reveals-the-secrets-of-its-success/ |archivedate=November 7, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design===
''Final Fantasy X'' features innovations in the rendering of characters' facial expressions, achieved through [[motion capture]] and [[skeletal animation]] technology.&lt;ref name="event"/&gt;&lt;ref name="character"/&gt; This technology allowed animators to create realistic lip movements, which were then programmed to match the speech of the game's voice actors. Nojima has revealed that the inclusion of voice acting enabled him to express emotion more powerfully than before, and he was therefore able to keep the storyline simple. He also said that the presence of voice actors led him to make various changes to the script, in order to match the voice actors' personalities with the characters they were portraying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=GameSpot Staff |date=November 30, 2001 |title=Final Fantasy X |url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/rpg/finalfantasy10/news.html?sid=2829055&amp;mode=all&amp;page=2&amp;q= |work=GameSpot |publisher=CBS Interactive |accessdate=November 23, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213132447/http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/rpg/finalfantasy10/news.html?sid=2829055&amp;mode=all&amp;page=2&amp;q= |archivedate=February 13, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The inclusion of voice, however, led to difficulties. With the game's cutscenes already programmed around the Japanese voice work, the English [[language localisation|localization]] team faced the difficulty of establishing English-oriented dialogue and the obstacle of incorporating this modified wording with the rhythm and timing of the characters' lip movements. Localization specialist [[Alexander O. Smith]] noted that they had to keep the localized sound file within the duration of the original Japanese, as longer files would cause the game to crash.&lt;ref name="localization hell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/true-tales-from-localization-hell |title=True Tales from Localization Hell |first=Bob |last=Mackey |date=August 1, 2016 |accessdate=August 1, 2016 |work=[[US Gamer]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801162821/http://www.usgamer.net/articles/true-tales-from-localization-hell |archivedate=August 1, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He described the process of fitting natural-sounding English speech into the game as "something akin to writing four or five movies' worth of dialogue entirely in [[haiku]] form [and] of course the actors had to act, and act well, within those restraints."&lt;ref name="battleandvoice"/&gt;

The game was initially going to feature online elements, offered through Square's [[PlayOnline]] service. The features, however, were dropped during production, and online gaming would not become part of the ''Final Fantasy'' series until ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal = PlayStation: The Official Magazine| publisher = Future Publishing| title = Monitor: Final Fantasy X Goes Offline| author = PSM Staff| issue = 42| date = February 2001| page = 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Avistetto |first=Jimmy |title=Final Fantasy X Not Online-Capable |url=http://rpgamer.com/news/Q4-2000/112000b.html |publisher=RPGamer |accessdate=November 23, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206042126/http://www.rpgamer.com/news/Q4-2000/112000b.html |archivedate=February 6, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Map director Nakazato wanted to implement a world map concept with a more realistic approach than that of the traditional ''Final Fantasy'' game, in line with the realism of the game's 3D backgrounds, as opposed to pre-rendered backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy X International |developer=Square |publisher=Square EA |date=December 20, 2001 |platform=PlayStation 2|level=Beyond Final Fantasy: Field|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a player of the games in the ''Final Fantasy'' series, battle director Tsuchida wanted to recreate elements he found interesting or entertaining, which eventually led to the removal of the ''Active Time Battle'' system, and instead, incorporated the strategy-focused ''Conditional Turn-Based Battle'' system.&lt;ref name="battle"/&gt; Originally, ''Final Fantasy X'' was going to feature wandering enemies visible on the field map, seamless transitions into battles, and the option for players to move around the landscape during enemy encounters.&lt;ref name="battleandvoice"&gt;{{cite book | author=Birlew, Dan | year=2001 | title=Final Fantasy X Official Strategy Guide | page=268 | publisher = [[BradyGames]] | isbn=0-7440-0140-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Battle art director Shintaro Takai has explained that it was his intention that battles in ''Final Fantasy X'' come across as a natural part of the story and not an independent element.&lt;ref name="battle"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy X International |developer=Square |publisher=Square EA |date=December 20, 2001 |platform=PlayStation 2|level=Beyond Final Fantasy: Battle|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to hardware limitations, this idea was not used. Instead, a compromise was made, whereby some transitions from the field map to the battle map were made relatively seamless with the implementation of a motion blur effect that would happen at the end of an [[event scene]].&lt;ref name="event"/&gt; The desire for seamless transitions also led to the implementation of the new summoning system seen in the game.&lt;ref name="battle"/&gt; Kitase has explained that the purpose behind the Sphere Grid is to give players an interactive means of increasing their characters' attributes, such that they will be able to observe the development of those attributes firsthand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Birlew, Dan | year=2001 | title=Final Fantasy X Official Strategy Guide | page=266 | publisher=BradyGames | isbn=0-7440-0140-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The developers experienced difficulty with the scene of Tidus and Yuna kissing, as they were not used to animating romance scenes. Visual Works director Kazuyuki Ikumori stated that this was due to the use of 3D models in the scene. Because of the negative response from female members of staff, the scene was remade multiple times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2015/03/16/behind-scenes-final-fantasy-xs-kiss-scene/ |title=Behind The Scenes Of Final Fantasy X’s Kiss Scene |publisher=Siliconera |date=March 16, 2015 |accessdate=August 10, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6lus4O4Ez?url=http://www.siliconera.com/2015/03/16/behind-scenes-final-fantasy-xs-kiss-scene/ |archivedate=November 10, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
{{main|Music of Final Fantasy X}}
''Final Fantasy X'' marks the first time regular series composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]] has had any assistance in composing the score for a game in the main series. His fellow composers for ''Final Fantasy X'' were [[Masashi Hamauzu]] and [[Junya Nakano]].&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; They were chosen for the soundtrack based on their ability to create music that was different from Uematsu's style while still being able to work together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview by RocketBaby.net |last=Huang |first=Michael |publisher=nobuouematsu.com |url=http://www.nobuouematsu.com/rbaby.html |accessdate=November 23, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EDcH39Q9?url=http://www.nobuouematsu.com/rbaby.html |archivedate=February 6, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; PlayOnline.com first revealed that the game's theme song was completed in November 2000. As Square still had not revealed who would sing the song, [[GameSpot]] personally asked Uematsu, who jokingly answered "It's going to be [[Rod Stewart]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=FFX Theme Song Complete| author=Yukiyoshi Ike Sato|date=November 29, 2000 | work=GameSpot | publisher=CBS Interactive| url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/rpg/finalfantasy10/news.html?sid=2659176&amp;mode=news| accessdate=July 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game features three songs with vocalized elements, including the [[J-pop]] ballad "[[Suteki da ne]]", which translates to "Isn't it Wonderful?". The lyrics were written by Kazushige Nojima, and the music was written by Uematsu. The song is performed by Japanese folk singer [[Rikki]], whom the music team contacted while searching for a singer whose music reflected an [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawan]] atmosphere.&lt;ref name="music"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy X International |developer=Square |publisher=Square EA |date=December 20, 2001 |platform=PlayStation 2|level=Beyond Final Fantasy: Music|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Suteki da ne" is also sung in Japanese in the English version of ''Final Fantasy X''. Like "[[Music of Final Fantasy VIII#Eyes on Me|Eyes on Me]]" from ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'' and "[[Melodies of Life]]" from ''[[Final Fantasy IX]]'', an orchestrated version of "Suteki da ne" is used as part of the ending theme. The other songs with lyrics are the heavy metal opening theme, "Otherworld", sung in English by Bill Muir; and "Hymn of the Fayth", a recurring piece sung using Japanese syllabary.&lt;ref name="RPGFOST"/&gt;

The original soundtrack spanned 91 tracks on four discs.

==Legacy==
Due to its commercial and critical success, Square Enix released a direct sequel to ''Final Fantasy X'' in 2003, titled ''[[Final Fantasy X-2]]''.&lt;ref name="FFX-2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dunham |first=Jeremy |date=November 24, 2003 |title=Final Fantasy X-2 Developer Interview |url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/442/442025p1.html |work=IGN |publisher=News Corporation |accessdate=November 24, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120810062807/http://ps2.ign.com/articles/442/442025p1.html |archivedate=August 10, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sequel is set two years after the conclusion of ''Final Fantasy X'', establishing new conflicts and dilemmas and resolving loose ends left by the original game. Although the sequel did not sell as well as the original, 5.29 million units versus 8 million units, it can still be considered a commercial success. As a result of the title's popularity, Yoshinori Kitase and Kazushige Nojima decided to establish a plot-related connection between ''Final Fantasy X'' and ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'', another well-received'' Final Fantasy'' game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year=2001 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy X Ultimania Ω | page=191 | language=Japanese | publisher=DigiCube | isbn=4-88787-021-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, after the release of the HD Remaster, Nojima stated that he would like to see a second sequel to ''X'', and if there were demand for it, it could happen.&lt;ref name="PossibleX3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2013/12/26/final-fantasy-x-scenario-writer-possibility-final-fantasy-x-3/ |title=Final Fantasy X Scenario Writer On The Possibility Of Final Fantasy X-3 |author=Sato |publisher=Siliconera |date=December 26, 2013 |accessdate=December 26, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227000246/http://www.siliconera.com/2013/12/26/final-fantasy-x-scenario-writer-possibility-final-fantasy-x-3/ |archivedate=December 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The minigame of blitzball has made it into other games, such as ''[[Final Fantasy X-2]]'', and was mentioned as a possibility for ''[[Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://kotaku.com/the-makers-of-final-fantasy-xiv-are-still-deciding-how-1796156982|title=The Makers Of Final Fantasy XIV Are Still Deciding How To Add Blitzball|last=Schreier|first=Jason|work=Kotaku|access-date=2017-07-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advancements in portraying realistic emotions achieved with ''Final Fantasy X'' through voice-overs and detailed facial expressions have since become a staple of the series, with ''Final Fantasy X-2'' and other subsequent titles (such as ''[[Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy XII]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy XIII|XIII]]'' and its sequels, and ''[[Final Fantasy XV|XV]]'') also featuring this development. Traversing real-time 3D environments instead of an overworld map has also become a standard of the series. Final Fantasy X can be considered a pioneer in 3-D RPG maps.&lt;ref name="GT-FFRetrospectiveVII"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.gametrailers.com/video/part-vii-final-fantasy/24248| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090525090957/http://www.gametrailers.com/video/part-vii-final-fantasy/24248| archivedate = May 25, 2009| title = Final Fantasy Retrospective Part VII| publisher = GameTrailers| date = August 28, 2007| accessdate = April 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Takeo Kujiraoka, director from ''[[Dissidia Final Fantasy NT]]'', regarded ''Final Fantasy X'' as his favorite game from the franchise based on its emotional impact on the players as well as the multiple amount of playable content that surpasses 100 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.us.playstation.com/2018/01/30/dissidia-final-fantasy-nt-out-today/|title=Dissidia Final Fantasy NT Out Today|publisher=Blog PlayStation|date=January 30, 2018|accessdate=August 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[flag]] of [[Lebanon]]''' ({{lang-ar|علم لبنان}}) is formed of two horizontal red stripes enveloping a horizontal white stripe. The white stripe is twice the height ( width ) of the red ones (ratio 1:2:1)—a [[Spanish fess]]. The [[Lebanon Cedar|green cedar (Lebanon Cedar)]] in the middle touches each of the red stripes and its width is one third of the width of the flag.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020503091622/http://www.cedarland.org/const.html The description of the flag is cited in the Lebanese Constitution, Chapter 1, Article 5.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symbolism ==
The Presence and position of the Cedar in the middle of the flag is directly inspired by the mountains of Lebanon cedar (Cedrus libani). The Cedar is a symbol of holiness, eternity and peace. As an emblem of longevity, the cedar of Lebanon has its origin in many biblical references.

[[File:Forest of The cedars of God.jpg|thumb|Cedrus libani.]]

The cedar of Lebanon is mentioned seventy-seven times in the Bible, especially in the book Psalms chapter 92 verse 13 where it says that "The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree, He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon"&lt;ref name="Bible en ligne"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bible|accessdate=October 27, 2014|url= http://www.info-bible.org/lsg/19.Psaumes.html#92}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Chapter 104, verse 16, where it is stated: "[t]he trees of the Lord are well watered, the cedars of Lebanon that he planted".&lt;ref name="Bible en ligne 2"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bible|accessdate=October 27, 2014|url= http://www.info-bible.org/lsg/19.Psaumes.html#104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alphonse de Lamartine]] (1790-1869), marveling at the cedars of Lebanon during his trip to the Orient with his daughter Julia, had these words: "[t]he cedars of Lebanon are the relics of centuries and nature, the most famous natural landmarks in the universe. They know the history of the earth, better than the story itself".&lt;ref name="firdaous"&gt;{{cite web|title=Firdaous - Arab world |accessdate= September 2, 2013|url= http://www.firdaous.com/00449-cedre-du-liban-plus-quun-arbre-tout-un-symbole.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]] (1900-1944), who loved the cedars and also had visited Lebanon in 1935, wrote in his work Citadel "[t]he peace is a long growing tree. We need, as the cedar, to rock its unity".&lt;ref name="Citadelle"&gt;{{cite web|title=L'Orient-Le Jour |accessdate=October 27, 2014|url= http://www.lorientlejour.com/article/876563/une-escapade-a-becharre-refuge-des-maronites-persecutes-apres-la-chute-de-byzance.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, in a text of the proclamation of the State of Greater Lebanon, it was said: "[a]n evergreen cedar is like a young nation despite a cruel past. Although oppressed, never conquered, the cedar is its rallying. By the union, it will break all attacks".&lt;ref name="Citadelle" /&gt;

The white color on the flag represents the snow as a symbol of purity and peace.

The two red stripes refer to the Lebanese blood shed to preserve the country against the successive invaders.

[[File:Construction Sheet of Flag of Lebanon.gif|200px|thumb|Construction sheet of the Lebanese Flag]]

According to the Article 5 of the constitution of Lebanon: "The Lebanese flag shall be composed of three horizontal stripes, a white stripe between two red ones. The width of the white stripe shall be equal to that of both red stripes. In the center of and occupying one-third of the white stripe is a green cedar tree with its top touching the upper red strip and its base touching the lower red stripe".&lt;ref name="Ministry of information"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ministry of information |accessdate=October 27, 2014|url= http://www.ministryinfo.gov.lb/en/sub/Lebanon/LebaneseConstitution.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through history, Lebanon, or at least its region, had taken the flag of the people who occupied it ([[Mamluk]], [[Ottoman Empire]])

&lt;/gallery&gt;

During the [[French Mandate of Lebanon]], the Lebanese flag was designed by the president of the Lebanese Renaissance Movement, the late [[Naoum Mokarzel]]. It was similar to the [[tricolour (flag)|tricolour]] [[flag of France]] but with a [[Lebanon Cedar|green cedar (Lebanon Cedar)]] in the middle.

=== Lebanese Republic ===
The present Lebanese flag was adopted just prior to independence from France in 1943. Seeking independence, the actual flag was first drawn by member of parliament [[Henri Pharaon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

It was adopted on December 7, 1943, during a meeting in the parliament, where the article 5 in the Lebanese constitution was modified.

One theory is that since Henri Pharaon was a long-time consul in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]] and was an avid friend and founder of the "Austro-Lebanese Association of Friendship", the colors could have been inspired by the red-white-red [[Flag of Austria]], where the flag colors are based on the Lebanese geography and therefore, the first red represents the [[Mount Lebanon]] and the second red represents the [[Anti-Lebanon mountains]] and the white represents the [[Beqaa Valley]], which is situated in the middle of the two mountain ranges on the map of Lebanon. And the [[Lebanon Cedar|green cedar (Lebanon Cedar)]] in the middle of the white part touches each of the red stripes is added because Lebanon is sometimes [[metonymy|metonymically]] referred to as the Land of the Cedars.&lt;ref name=budge10&gt;{{cite book |title= The Literature of the Ancient Egyptians |author= Budge, E.A.W.  |year= 2010 |publisher= HardPress |page= 261 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=vXoOAAAAQAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cromer2004war&gt;{{cite book |author= Cromer, G.  |title= A war of words: political violence and public debate in Israel |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=qexwM08RUsMC |series= Cass series on political violence |year= 2004 |publisher= Frank Cass |isbn=978-0-7146-5631-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Austrian flag is the second oldest in the world, dating to the 13th century when it first probably appeared after the [[Siege of Acre (1189)|Siege of Acre]] during the [[Third Crusade]]. The colors could have been inspired by the red-white-red Flag of Austria, but the white stripe (a [[Spanish fess]]) could have been inspired by the red-yellow-red [[Flag of Spain]], where the flag structure is based on the Lebanese connection to the [[Mediterranean sea]] and its [[Phoenicia]]n past that reached to the Mediterranean shores of present-day Spain.

The '''''Funeral of St. Jerome'''''   is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter [[Filippo Lippi]] of [[Jerome|Saint Jerome]]'s funeral. It is housed in the [[Museo dell'Opera del Duomo (Prato)|Museo dell'Opera del Duomo]] next to the [[Cathedral of Prato]], central Italy.

==History==
The large altarpiece was commissioned by the [[provost (religion)|provost]] of [[Prato]],  [[Geminiano Inghirami]], a patron of the arts who also called [[Donatello]] and [[Michelozzo]] to work in the cathedral. The panel is dated 1440, but this has been always considered a false due to the large stylistic  differences with other Lippi's works of the period. It is generally recognized to be from between 1452, when Lippi arrived in Prato (or a few years before), and Inghirami's death in 1460.

It is housed in the cathedral's museum since the 20th century.

==Description==
The work features numerous characters, painted in different attitudes. In the center, lying on a [[catafalque]] with a precious cloth decorated with [[pomegranate]]s, is the body of St. Jerome. He is surrounded by a group of monks, whose faces show their mourning and despair for the saint's death. The pomegranate cloth is also visible in the funerary monument of  Geminiano Inghirami, once in the church of [[San Francesco, Prato|San Francesco]], attributed to  [[Pasquino da Montepulciano]] (1460).

The mourner's faces show that Lippi had studied [[Giotto]]'s work in the [[Bardi Chapel]], as some gestures are very similar, such as that of the monks kissing the saint's feet or the one raising his hands. Also the saint's position is similar to Giotto's, as well as the presence of ancient numismatic, a widespread theme at the time.

In the foreground is Inghirami kneeling, with a crippled youth in front of him who points at Jerome's body (a trick to avoid that the donor's red garments could distract the observer). The crippled figure is inspired by the frescoes by [[Masaccio]] and [[Masolino da Panicale]] in the [[Brancacci Chapel]], which Lippi knew well as he had a been a monk in the convent housing the chapel in his youth.

The upper part of the panel, aside from rocky mountains with three secondary scenes (Adoration of the Child and two episodes of the saint's life), is occupied by angels, perhaps executed by [[Fra' Diamante]] or another collaborator. Among them circles which allude to the Heaven's Circles, the Redeemer (with a book with Alpha and Omega), the Holy Spirit dove and the Jesus opening his arms.

At the bottom is the coat of arms of the  Inghirami family.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8774">'''Geographical segregation''' exists whenever the proportions of population rates of two or more [[population]]s are not [[wiktionary:homogenous|homogenous]] throughout a defined space. Populations can be considered any plant or animal [[species]], human [[gender]]s, followers of a certain [[religion]], people of different [[nationalities]], [[ethnic group]]s, etc.

In [[social geography]] segregation of [[ethnic group]]s, [[social class]]es and genders is often measured by the calculation of indices such as the [[index of dissimilarity]]. Different dimensions of segregation (or its contrary) are recognised: exposure, evenness, clustering, concentration, centralisation, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Massey |first=D. |last2=Denton |first2=N. |title=American Apartheid: Segregation and the Making of the Underclass |location=Cambridge |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1993 |isbn=0674018206 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent studies also highlight new local indices of segregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ssresearch.2015.08.005 |pmid=26463550 |title=Patterns of local segregation: Do they matter for neighborhood crime? |journal=Social Science Research |volume=54 |pages=303–18 |year=2015 |last1=Krivo |first1=Lauren J |last2=Byron |first2=Reginald A |last3=Calder |first3=Catherine A |last4=Peterson |first4=Ruth D |last5=Browning |first5=Christopher R |last6=Kwan |first6=Mei-Po |last7=Lee |first7=Jae Yong }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human geographical segregation==

Segregation, as a broad concept, has appeared in all parts of the world where people exist—in different contexts and times it takes on different forms, shaped by the physical and human environments.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/segregation&lt;/ref&gt; The spatial concentration of [[population]] groups is not a new [[phenomenon]]. Since [[societies]] began to form there have been segregated inhabitants. Either segregated purposefully by force, or gradually over time, segregation was based on socio-economic, religious, educational, linguistic or ethnic grounds. Some groups choose to be segregated to strengthen social identity.&lt;ref name="un.org"&gt;https://www.un.org/ga/Istanbul+5/50.pdf{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="segregation.ch"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.segregation.ch/segregation/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130108131650/http://segregation.ch/segregation/ |archivedate=2013-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Legal segregation===
Segregation can be caused by [[legal]] frameworks, such as in the extreme example of apartheid in South Africa, and even Jewish ghettoization in Germany in the 20th century. Segregation can also happen slowly, stimulated by increased land and housing prices in certain neighborhoods, resulting in segregation of rich and poor in many urban cities.&lt;ref name="un.org"/&gt; Segregation can also be assigned arbitrarily. This can occur on a global scale, such as is seen in the [[Partition of India]], instances in [[Ireland]], and many other situations. Geographical boundaries were often put in place without much consideration for native peoples and natural geographic terrain and cultural limits that had long been in place.

In [[apartheid]] [[South Africa]], segregation was very much a legal concept. Enforced by the government, Africans were discriminated against, and forced to comply with apartheid. Some of the [[legislation]] passed dealt with physical segregation in schools, land tenure, geographic segregation and state repression. These were very clearly legislative, but also in the case of most white South Africans, a [[social construct]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |last=Scythe |first=N. C. |title=Early Apartheid: Race Laws in South Africa 1652–1836 |work=[[Master of Laws|LLM]] thesis, University of Witwatersrand |location=Johannesburg |year=1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Segregation can also be encouraged, using geographical boundaries, while not explicitly enforced. [[Public housing]] [[projects]], especially in the United States, have been criticized for this. Putting cheap housing in poor black neighborhoods encouraged local African-Americans to stay in the area, keeping other richer areas white by not building public housing there. This has been changing in the last ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagoreporter.com/news/2007/09/scattered-site-era-coming-end-0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130119220526/http://www.chicagoreporter.com/news/2007/09/scattered-site-era-coming-end-0 |archivedate=2013-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social segregation===
Segregation can also be caused by social factors that become evident as they happen, but are not necessarily government sanctioned. This could be things like informal ghettos, or simply rich neighborhoods. In terms of land capital, over time in a given area, [[humans]] will settle down and buy or take land. Some privileged people will acquire better land (that is, more [[Arable land|arable]], proximate to potential [[Capital (economics)|capital]], more pleasing views). Demand for these nicer habitats drives up prices, and areas deemed “better” based solely on geography become inherently exclusionary in their population makeup.

[[West Point Grey]], an area of [[Vancouver]] [[Canada]], is in part rich because of the views offered of [[Downtown Vancouver]], the [[Gulf Islands]], and its location near the water and [[University of British Columbia]]. Wealthy people had the resources to pay for advantages, and subsequently drove up prices. Examples of this can be seen all over the world. Geographical segregation is not defined by the sightline of places, though. It also occurs around certain structures, or simply in areas that are specifically developed with an income bracket in mind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westsiderealty.ca West Side Realty]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another segregation term, the [[ghetto]], has been used in many different contexts over time, generally meaning any physical part of a [[city]] predominantly occupied by any particular group of people. It implies that the group may be looked down upon and segregated purposefully. This does not mean that all ghettos are built up communities and buildings specifically for a segregation purpose, although many are. In the case of the United States, segregation of the [[African-American]] community was to a degree due to [[white flight]] out of the cities, than forcing African-Americans to live in the downtown cores.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~jdowd/masseydenton-apartheid.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gated communities===
[[Gated communities]] could be seen as a combination of both [[legal]] frameworks and [[social]] conventions regarding segregation. A gated community today is a controlled [[neighborhood]], inhabited by people with [[common interests]], such as safety, or class separation, but not necessarily of the same [[ethnicity]] or [[religion]]—it is distinct from an international community (in most cases).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Behind-the-urban-curtains/2005/03/03/1109700606439.html |title=Behind the urban curtains |date=March 4, 2005 |first=Matt |last=O'Sullivan |newspaper=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gated communities are very controversial, as they can be seen as encouraging distinction and separation, and therefore superiority from those who do not live with the gates community.

===Voluntary segregation===
Voluntary segregation is almost as common an occurrence as involuntary segregation is. Often, immigrants coming to a new and foreign country will band together for mutual benefit, and to keep a sense of community in the new country. These can be called ethnic enclaves and can be formed by any community or people group.&lt;ref name= "Portes, Alejandro and Leif Jensen"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Portes |first=Alejandro |first2=Leif |last2=Jensen |title=Disproving the Enclave Hypothesis: Reply |journal=[[American Sociological Review]] |volume=57 |issue=3 |year=1992 |pages=418–420 |jstor=2096246 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some well-known groups are [[Chinatowns]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinatownology.com/usa.html{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Little Italy]]s and ''[[barrio]]s''. These localized phenomena also come in the form of [[ethnoburb]]s, which are essentially the same concept as an ethnic enclave, but specifically located in suburbs, rather than the traditional downtowns, where Chinatowns and Little Italys are usually based.

The '''heroic lay''' is a genre of [[Germanic culture|Germanic]] [[epic poetry]] characteristic of the [[Migration Period]] and the [[Early Middle Ages]]. A lay is a short narrative poem of between 80 and 200 lines concerning a single heroic episode in the life of a warrior from Germanic legend. {{sfn|Hatto|1980|p=165|ps=. "A terse, self-contained, objective, memorized poem of epic-dramatic style imbued with an heroic ethos conveyed with art in a single-stranded plot"}}{{sfn|Gloning|Young|2004|p=42|ps=. "a short poem extolling the valour and nobility of character of a great hero of the past."}} It is distinct from the '''heroic epic''' ([[Beowulf]], [[Nibelungenlied]]) which combines a sequence of episodes into a longer narrative.{{sfn|Heusler|1905}}

[[File:David Playing the Harp 1670 Jan de Bray.jpg|thumb|250px|''David Playing the Harp''  by [[Jan de Bray]], 1670.]]
Knowledge of the biblical period is mostly from literary references in the [[Bible]] and post-biblical sources. Religion and music historian Herbert Lockyer, Jr. writes that "music, both vocal and instrumental, was well cultivated among the [[Hebrews]], the [[New Testament]] Christians, and the [[Christian church]] through the centuries."&lt;ref name=Lockyer&gt;Lockyer, Herbert Jr. ''All the Music of the Bible'', Hendrickson Publ. (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; He adds that "a look at the [[Old Testament]] reveals how God's ancient people were devoted to the study and practice of music, which holds a unique place in the historical and prophetic books, as well as the Psalter."

The music of religious ritual was first used by [[King David]], and, according to the ''Larousse Encyclopedia of Music'', he is credited with confirming the men of the [[Tribe of Levi]] as the "custodians of the music of the divine service."&lt;ref name=Hindley&gt;Hindley, Geoffrey. ''Larousse Encyclopedia of Music'', Chartwell (1971), Ch. "Jewish Music"&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Irene Hesk notes that of the twenty-four books of the [[Old Testament]], the 150 Psalms in the [[Book of Psalms]] ascribed to King David, have served as "the bedrock of Judeo-Christian hymnology," concluding that "no other poetry has been set to music more often in [[Western civilization]]."&lt;ref name=Hesk&gt;Hesk, Irene. ''Passport to Jewish Music: Its History, Traditions, and Culture'', Greenwood Publishing (1994) p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of ancient musical instruments has been practiced for centuries with some researchers studying instruments from [[Israel]]/[[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] dating to the "biblical period."&lt;ref name=Burgh/&gt;{{rp|145}} Archaeological and written data have demonstrated clearly that music was an integral part of daily life in ancient Israel/Palestine. Figurines and [[iconograph]]ic depictions show that people played [[chordophone]]s and [[frame drum]]s, and that the human voice was essential as women and men sang love songs along with laments for the deceased. Data also describes outdoor scenes of music and dancing in sometimes prophetic frenzies, often with carefully orchestrated and choreographed musicians and singers within specially built structures.&lt;ref name=Burgh/&gt;{{rp|106}}

According to ancient music historian Theodore Burgh, "If we were able to step into the . . . biblical period, we would find a culture filled with music . . . where people used music in their daily lives."&lt;ref name=Burgh&gt;Burgh, Theodore W. ''Listening to the Artifacts: Music Culture in Ancient Palestine'', T &amp; T Clark International (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; "Such music was capable of expressing a great variety of moods and feelings or the broadly marked antitheses of joy and sorrow, hope and fear, faith and doubt. In fact, every shade and quality of sentiment are found in the wealth of songs and psalms and in the diverse melodies of the people."&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;{{rp|X}}

==Cultural influences==

===Egypt===
[[Egypt]] was among the oldest cultures of the [[Near East]] and had a highly developed musical culture dating back to around 3000 BC. Egyptian sources, however, include only pictorial relics, some instruments, and a few literary records concerned with performance practices. On various pieces of sculpture there are reliefs of harpists and flutists taking part in religious ceremonies and social entertainments.

A number of instruments have been identified as being used in Egypt, including the [[lyre]] (a type of [[harp]]), an [[oboe]]-like instrument, various drums from Asia, the [[lute]] and the [[sistrum]] (rattle). [[Mural]]s showing singers and instrumentalist performing have also been found. According to music historian Homer Ulrich, it is likely that Egypt influenced the "educational and ethical aspects of [[Greek music]]."&lt;ref name=Ulrich&gt;Ulrich, Homer. ''A History of Music and Musical Style'', Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, Inc. (1963)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}} Stephen Batuk equally observed that the historical link of music was consummated during the week of creation where birds in the air make sounds which could be seen as music.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Sumer and Babylonia===
{{main|Music of Mesopotamia}}

Although records are minimal, it is known that between 3000 and 2300 BC organized temple music with singers existed in [[Sumer]] and [[Babylonia]], the oldest cultural groups in [[Mesopotamia]]. Excavations have uncovered several musical instruments, including harps, lutes, double oboes, and a few others.

Because of the political interrelations between the Hebrews and the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] nations of Babylonia, [[Assyria]], and the [[Hittite empire]], there were similarities between the Hebrew music of the [[Judea]]n people and the others. Jewish music began in the early years of tribal life, and the "references to music in the Bible are numerous," writes Ulrich.&lt;ref name=Ulrich/&gt;{{rp|11}} After the Hebrews established a kingdom in [[Israel]], their musical activities were to increase substantially.

==Ancient Israel==
[[File:Miriam.JPG|thumb|18th-century painting, "The Song of Miriam," by Paulo Malteis, Italy. Celebration after crossing the Red Sea from Egypt]]
According to music historian Abraham Schwadron, "probably the most important musical contribution of the ancient Hebrews was the elevation of the status of [[liturgy|liturgical]] music in union with ritual ceremonies."  He notes the "high degree of musico-liturgical organization" from the descriptive accounts of King [[Solomon's Temple]], such as the 24 choral groups consisting of 288 musicians which took part in 21 weekly services.&lt;ref name=Schwadron&gt;Schwadron, Abraham A. ''Music of Many Cultures: An Introduction'', Ch. 16. Univ. of California Press (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the similar instruments used by the Hebrews which were also used in neighboring cultures, including [[Phoenicia]], [[Egypt]], [[Assyria]], and [[Greece]], Schwadron writes that "it would be accurate to state that . . . it is in the particular uses of music—sacred and secular, ethical and aesthetical—that ancient [[Jewish music]] made a unique contribution.&lt;ref name=Schwadron/&gt;

Music historian John Stainer notes that the earlier relationship between [[Abraham]] and the [[Canaanites]] "in all probability influenced future Hebrew music," and which probably caused his posterity to carry a certain amount of Assyrian music or musical instruments into Egypt. He adds that a stay of four centuries "in so civilized a culture as Egypt must have largely added to their knowledge of the art."&lt;ref name=Stainer&gt;Stainer, John. ''Music of the Bible'', Da Capo Press (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}}

Although the ancient music of the Psalms and the other Bible books (which were all chanted), is often thought to be lost, the Masoretic text of the Hebrew Bible contains [[cantillation]] marks indicating a melodic line for the words. Following the French archaeomusicologist Suzanne Haik-Vantoura, some authorities now argue that these cantillation marks date from temple times and record the music sung in the temple. Attempts have been made to decipher them in modern musical notation.&lt;ref name=Haik-Vantoura&gt;Haik-Vantoura, Suzanne ''La musique de la Bible révélée (Robert Dumas: Paris, 1976)''; Mitchell, David C. ''[https://www.amazon.com/Songs-Ascents-Worship-Jerusalems-Temples/dp/1508745358/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1427658006&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=mitchell+songs+of+ascents The Songs of Ascents]'' (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Babylonian exile===
The musical traditions of the Temple were rudely broken by the destruction of the [[First Temple]] and the exile of the Jews in [[Babylon]] during the 6th century BC. Hindley notes that most of the [[psalms]] seem to have been written in the years after the return of the Jews to [[Jerusalem]]. At this time too the practice of [[antiphonal]] singing between the [[Hazzan|cantor]] and the congregation seems to have become common.&lt;ref name=Hindley/&gt;

The music of [[ancient Israel]] represents almost fourteen centuries of change, roughly from 1300 BC to 70 AD, when [[Titus]]' [[siege of Jerusalem (70)|siege of Jerusalem]] took place. Stainer points out the lack of many artifacts during this period. He concludes that the "sad lack of national monuments relating to the Jews is not surprising, when it is remembered that Jerusalem stood about seventeen sieges, each of which was accompanied by more or less destruction, and that, too, at the hands of victors who seemed to take a malicious delight in effacing the national characteristics of those they conquered."&lt;ref name=Stainer/&gt;{{rp|9}}

===Second Temple destruction===
However, after the fall of the First Temple, Werner states that the fabric of dreams spun about its earlier music included reminiscences, visions, and fantasies, as the Rabbis took pains to eradicate both its choral and instrumental traditions. "Their time had arrived, and their ideas on liturgy and music were radically different from those of the Temple priests." Werner finds it paradoxical that modern day rabbis continue to praise the instrumental music of the Temple but prohibit any and all instrumental music in their synagogues today.&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt;{{rp|18}}

The destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 AD led to the collapse of the Hebrew nation and the beginning of the [[Diaspora]] (dispersion or exile) of Jews to other lands, such as Spain, Italy, and the [[Rhineland]]. In these places, the synagogue would replace the destroyed Temple, with new liturgical services, prayers, and rabbinical writings oriented to mourning the loss of both the Temple and personal freedom.&lt;ref name=Schwadron/&gt;

==Christian period==
[[File:Vatican image.jpg|thumb|Fresco of angel playing a lute by [[Melozzo da Forlì]].]]
Very little is known about primitive [[Christian music]], notes Whitcomb, because like most of the ancient, it was unwritten. As a result, as songs passed from generation to generation, they grew very different from the original. However, she notes that "much of this early music derived its beauty from the [[Greeks]] and its holiness from the [[Hebrews]]."&lt;ref name=Whitcomb/&gt; According to Ulrich, Hebrew music "was of direct and immediate influence on the musical practices of the early Christian church."&lt;ref name=Ulrich/&gt; He cites Werner in noting that "the connections between Hebrew and Christian [[chant]] have been scientifically investigated and proved."&lt;ref name=Werner&gt;Werner, Eric. ''The Sacred Bridge'', Columbia Univ. Press (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

The musical art of the [[Levites]], the Temple musicians who were named after their historic ancestors, was lost by the end of the 1st century. In 70 AD the [[Second Temple]] was destroyed by the troops of the [[Emperor Titus]] and in the years following the Levites along with the majority of Jews fled from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. As a result, the synagogue music of the [[Jewish diaspora|Dispersion]] lost the joyful character of that of the Temple and the large instrumental forces were dispensed with.&lt;ref name=Hindley/&gt;

The [[New Testament]] was not written until centuries later than the old and the music had attained much higher development, according to music historian Ida Whitcomb. As it related to Christ, it is called [[Christian music]]. However, there are but few allusions to it in three of the [[Gospels]]: in the [[Gospel of Luke]], there are the "Angels' Song," Mary's "Magnificat," and Zacharias's "Song." In [[Acts]], [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] and [[Silas]] sing behind prison-bars: the prison is shaken, the doors fly open, and they are free. In the [[Epistles]], there are but few references to music, but in [[Ephesians]] there is a "beautiful one," in which Paul exhorts the churches to sing "Psalms" and "spiritual songs."&lt;ref name=Whitcomb/&gt;

Hindley adds that antiphonal chants between cantor or priest and the congregation originated in Hebrew worship methods. At its peak around the beginning of the [[Christian era]], the elaborate music of the Temple was performed by a large [[choir]] of highly trained men singers, with boys sometimes added, and during this period many instruments also were used by the Temple orchestra.&lt;ref name=Hindley/&gt;

Whitcomb adds that many of our noblest Church [[hymns]] have been suggested by the [[Psalms]], which she notes was "the first hymn-book of the Hebrew nation and remains today not only the hymn-book of the Hebrew Temple, but also of the Christian Church."&lt;ref name=Whitcomb&gt;Whitcomb, Ida Prentice.

Among the earliest [[pictograph]]ic signs found have been of a boat-shaped [[harp]] found on a [[Sumer]]ian clay tablet dating back to 3000 BC, and an earlier depiction of this harp was also found in modern southwest [[Iran]] dating around 3200 BC.&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;{{rp|45}}

[[File:Bar Kokhba Coin.jpg|thumb|Bar Kochba coinage showing trumpets and a lyre, c. 132 AD]]
Many relics of musical instruments have been found in Palestine dating from the [[Hellenistic age]] giving details about the state, character, and practice of liturgical music.&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt; In other cases, many musical instruments of the Hebrews mentioned in the Bible are identified by analogy with similar instruments found in other nearby cultures, such as Egypt and Babylonia. An example of some instruments mentioned in the bible can be found in [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 3:5:
{{quote|text=that when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music...}}

According to Jewish historian [[Josephus Flavius]], all details of the [[First Temple]], including its musical instruments, were made and viewed as "symbols of the universe," especially instruments like the [[kithara]] or [[lyre]]. In his ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'', Josephus explains that the musical instruments, along with other matters of Jewish religion, represent a perishable "image" of the [[cosmos]], or of "a cosmic Temple."&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt;{{rp|1}}

===String instruments===
Lockyer notes that according to the [[Scriptures]], [[Jubal (Bible)|Jubal]] was the father of harpists and organists (Gen. 4:20–21). He points out that the harp was among the chief instruments and the favorite of [[David]], and its use is found more than fifty times in the Bible. It was used at both joyful and mournful ceremonies, and its use was "raised to its highest perfection under David" (1 Sam. 16:23). Lockyer adds that "It was the sweet music of the harp that often dispossessed Saul of his melancholy (1 Sam. 16:14–23; 18:10–11).&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;{{rp|46}} When the Jews were captive in Babylon they hung their harps up and refused to use them while in exile, earlier being part of the instruments used in the Temple (1 Kgs. 10:12).

Another stringed instrument of the harp class, and one also used by the ancient Greeks, was the [[lyre]].  A similar instrument was the [[lute]], which had a large pear-shaped body, long neck, and fretted fingerboard with head screws for tuning. Coins displaying musical instruments, [[Bar Kochba Revolt coinage]], were issued by the Jews during the [[Bar Kokhba revolt|Second Jewish Revolt]] against the Roman Empire of 132–135 AD [[File:Sack of jerusalem.JPG|thumb|[[Arch of Titus]] with silver trumpets]]

In addition to those, there was the [[psaltery]], another stringed instrument which is referred to almost thirty times in Scripture. According to [[Josephus]], it had twelve strings and was played with a [[quill]], not with the hand. Another writer suggested that it was like a guitar, but with a flat triangular form and strung from side to side.&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;{{rp|49}}

===Wind instruments===
Among the wind instruments used in the biblical period were the [[cornet]], [[flute]], [[Horn (instrument)|horn]], organ, [[pipe (instrument)|pipe]], and trumpet.&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;{{rp|50}}

There were also silver trumpets and the double [[oboe]]. Werner concludes that from the measurements taken of the trumpets on the [[Arch of Titus]] in Rome and from coins, that "the trumpets were very high pitched with thin body and shrill sound." He adds that in ''[[War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness]]'', a manual for military organization and strategy discovered among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], these trumpets "appear clearly capable of regulating their pitch pretty accurately, as they are supposed to blow rather complicated signals in unison."&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt;{{rp|2}}

Whitcomb writes that the pair of silver trumpets were fashioned according to [[Torah|Mosaic law]] and were probably among the trophies which the [[Emperor Titus]] brought to Rome when he conquered Jerusalem. She adds that on the Arch raised to the victorious Titus, "there is a sculptured relief of these trumpets, showing their ancient form. (see photo)&lt;ref name=Whitcomb/&gt;

The flute was commonly used for festal and mourning occasions, according to Whitcomb. "Even the poorest Hebrew was obliged to employ two flute-players to perform at his wife's funeral."&lt;ref name=Whitcomb/&gt;

The [[shofar]] (the horn of a ram) is still used for special liturgical purposes such as the [[Jewish New Year]] services in Jewish communities. As such, it is not considered a musical instrument but an instrument of theological symbolism which has been intentionally kept to its primitive character. In ancient times it was used for warning of danger, to announce the new moon or beginning of [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]], or to announce the death of a notable. "In its strictly ritual usage it carried the cries of the multitude to God," writes Werner.&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt;{{rp|12}}

===Percussion instruments===
[[File:Miriams Tanz.jpg|thumb|Miriam and women celebrate the crossing of the Red Sea; [[Tomić Psalter]], 1360/63]]
Among the percussion instruments were [[Bell (instrument)|bells]], [[cymbals]], [[sistrum]], [[tabret]], hand drums, and [[tambourines]].  Percussion instruments are those producing tones by being struck in various ways and have been used by bands and orchestras throughout history.&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;{{rp|59}}

The tabret, or timbrel, was a small hand-drum used for festive occasions, and was considered a woman's instrument. In modern times it was often used by the Salvation Army. According to the Bible, when the children of Israel came out of Egypt and [[The Exodus|crossed the Red Sea]], ''"[[Miriam]] took a timbrel in her hands; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dance."''&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;

==Singing==
Whitcomb writes that "much of the most beautiful music of the Bible is contained in the Psalms," and the word "psalm" comes from the Greek word meaning "to sing, to strike lyre." The psalter or psaltery was one of the instruments which accompanied the Psalm.&lt;ref name=Whitcomb/&gt; The word soon came to signify any form of melody. The psalms were sung antiphonally or responsively, perhaps by the priest and congregation, or by two choruses.

According to Shiloah, most of the customs and ceremonies mentioned earlier, such as weddings or other celebrations, were accompanied by music made by women and attests to the importance of women's songs. But there were many instances where women sang alone or with friends and family. "The woman fortifies her spirit by singing to herself, and perhaps to her infant, who hears and absorbs the mother's confessions, longings, complaints, and dreams."  There were also "mother-songs, soldier-songs, grass-widow-songs, orphan-songs, and woman's-trade-songs." According to some, writes Shiloah, women's songs existed because of the need to compensate for the ban against public participation of women in synagogue rituals.&lt;ref name=Shiloah/&gt;

Ancient music historian Joachim Braun notes that Philo had mentioned ritualist vigils near Alexandria, that included a meal and the singing of hymns by a double chorus as accompaniment to the processions and libations.&lt;ref name=Braun&gt;Braun, Joachim. ''Music in Ancient Israel/Palestine'', W. B. Eerdmans Publ. (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dance==
According to biblical historian Amnon Shiloah, dance was directly associated with music and was an important aspect of various events, although the actual dance movements are nowhere described in detail. There is meager evidence about dance when compared with a wider variety found in Egypt. However, there are many biblical descriptions of occasions that inspired dancing in biblical times.&lt;ref name=Shiloah/&gt;{{rp|209}}

In the Bible, Mishnah, and Talmud, dance is referred to in various contexts, and in Megido, the Negev, and other sites in Israel, recently found iconographic remnants show dancing figures. In Judg. 21:21, a festival is described during which it was customary to dance in the vineyards. Dancing was also associated with celebrations of military victories and for welcoming home heroes. In Exod. 15:20, Miriam and the other women burst into song and dance accompanied by drums to mark the parting of the Red Sea which saved the people of Israel; Jephtah's daughter danced to meet her father returning from victorious battles (Judg. 11:34); the women of Israel came out to dance before Saul and David upon their return from fighting the Philistines (1 Sam. 18:6); the king and his subjects were also inspired to dance when the Ark of the Covenant was brought up to Jerusalem (2 Sam. Ch. 6).&lt;ref name=Shiloah&gt;Shiloah, Amnon. ''Jewish Musical Traditions'', Wayne State Univ. (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|210}}

==Musical traditions==

===Purposes of music===
The Bible mentions many uses of music including songs of praise, songs of victory, songs of mourning, and above all the Psalms. Dances were also a common music expression along with the combination of singing with instrumental music. During later times there was also a purely vocal music which prevailed for a period.&lt;ref name=Ulrich/&gt; According to Ulrich, music played an important part in both the secular and the religious life of the Hebrews. Kings and other leaders of the people were customarily acclaimed in songs and fanfares, and very elaborate musical services in the Temple, described in the Bible, were important parts of worship. There are, for instance, descriptions in the Bible of an orchestra consisting of nine lutes, two harps, and a cymbal.&lt;ref name=Ulrich/&gt; In other parts there are accounts of all-women choirs combined with singing and dancing to the men's percussion accompaniment. Werner adds that the choir's repertoire consisted of psalms, canticles, and other poetic passages from Scripture, although it may have contained some noncanonical texts. The choice of psalms is said to have been determined by God's activities on the first seven days of creation, and the verses which allude to them.&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt;{{rp|13}}

Werner writes that "unique in the history of music is the firm belief in the purifying and sin-atoning power of the Temple's music, ascribed to both chant and instruments."&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt; The music had to be free from blemish or fault, and avoided magical elements. Even the High Priest's garment had symbolism: (Exod. 28:34–35): "a golden bell and a pomegranate, round about on the skirts of the robe . . . and its sound shall be heard when he goes into the holy place before the Lord . . . " According to Philo and Josephus, the bells represented symbols of cosmic harmony.&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt;{{rp|10}}

===Music training===
According to the text of the Mishna, the early musicians, both singers and instrumentalists, were strictly trained to be professional musicians with their average training lasting five years. Bible historian Alfred Sendrey notes a "sudden and unexplained upsurge of large [[choir]]s and orchestras, consisting of thoroughly organized and trained musical groups, which would be virtually inconceivable without lengthy, methodical preparation." This has led some scholars to believe that the prophet [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] was the [[patriarch]] of a school which taught not only prophets and holy men, but also sacred-rite musicians. This public music school, perhaps the earliest in recorded history, was not restricted to a priestly class—which is how the shepherd boy [[David]] appears on the scene as a minstrel to [[King Saul]]." :"&lt;ref name=JRT&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061004134128/http://www.rtjournal.org/vol_5/no_1/krahenbuhl.html "A Theatre Before the World: Performance History at the Intersection of Hebrew, Greek, and Roman Religious Processional"] ''The Journal of Religion and Theatre'', Vol. 5, No. 1, Summer 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of music===
Different types of music were also defined:&lt;ref name=Ulrich/&gt; 
*'''Cantillation.''' Used when parts of the Bible were read during the service and parts of the text were sung or chanted.
*'''Antiphony''' (also referred to as responsorial singing). Since Hebrew poetry is based on parallelism (the expression of one thought in two different ways), several types of performances were possible: either by two separate alternating choruses, or by a soloist alternating with the chorus. At its peak around the beginning of the Christian era, antiphonal music was performed by a large choir of highly trained men singers, with boys sometimes added. According to Hindley, "Antiphony is among the debts owed by Christian music to its Jewish predecessor."&lt;ref name=Hindley/&gt;
*'''Hymn songs.''' Within the service they were performed by either a soloist, called the cantor, or by groups. Some of the hymns were freely organized with groups of melodic [[motive (music)|motives]] with their variants connected to create a continuous melodic chant.
*'''Orchestration.''' Werner writes that "the sound of the Temple's orchestra consisted of never less than twelve instruments and rarely exceeded thirty-six." The trumpets were never mixed with the rest of the orchestra—being used for signals exclusively. One pair of cymbals were used in Temple rituals also as a signal instrument, "not unlike the gong in the modern theatre."&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt;

===Written notation===
Musical notation in the modern sense did not exist during this period. However, the Hebrew alphabet allows for special symbols to indicate how the music was to be performed. The alphabet consists of consonants and half-consonants, and vowels are indicated by dots and dashes above and below letter symbols. In addition to the vowel signs, a number of other signs, called "[[Tiberian vocalization|masoretic]]," refers not to single notes but to "melodic particles or groups," writes Ulrich. These particles were handed down by oral tradition among singers for centuries and were first codified in the 16th century. Ulrich notes that the "Dead Sea Scrolls contain signs similar to those in the liturgical script of early Christian sects . . . strengthening the conjecture that a common musical heritage is shared by the people of related cultures . . ."&lt;ref name=Ulrich/&gt;

==Influence on later music==
Music historian William Smoldon notes that despite the fact that instrumental music was not revived and used in the synagogue after the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 AD, (excluding the symbolic [[Shofar]] still used in orthodox communities,) "the [[chant]] continued, and of late years research has made it increasingly clear that many of the forms and even melodic patterns of the [[Byzantine]] and Western Christian chants were adaptations from the music of the synagogues."&lt;ref name=Smoldon&gt;Smoldon, William. ''A History of Music'', Dimension Books, Inc. (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

He also notes that after the collapse of the Western [[Roman Empire]], the "one steadfast feature was the Western Christian Church" which was "respected by the [[barbarians]]." He adds that there seems "little doubt that the worship-music of the early Church, i.e. at such centres as [[Jerusalem]], [[Damascus]], [[Antioch]] and [[Alexandria]], grew from materials . . . of Greek and Syrian origins, together with the service-chants of the Jewish synagogue."&lt;ref name=Smoldon/&gt;{{rp|20}}

;Psalms
The [[Psalms]] have been sung through all the ages up to the present. Whitcomb describes the importance of the Psalms:
:"the [[Crusades|Crusader]] has chanted them as he ascended the Hill of [[Zion]]; and the victorious general was welcomed on his return by a hallelujah chorus. The sailor on the dark night at sea, the shepherd on the lonely plain, the little waif upon the street, have alike been cheered by the music of the Psalms. They have enlivened the vintage-feast, the boatman on the Rhine, the soldier by his camp-fire have been softened and the sad have been cheered by these sweet inspirations to faith, [[penitence]], thanksgiving, and adoration."&lt;ref name=Whitcomb/&gt;

Lockyer writes that [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], the Holy Roman Emperor and champion of the pope, requested passages from his favorite psalm, Ps. 90, be read to him as he lay on his deathbed in September 1558. In that psalm, "[[Moses]] contrasts the eternity of God with the transience of human life, and Moses ends his song with a prayer for God's forgiveness and favor."(Ps 90:1–6)&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;{{rp|21}}

'''Human uses of mammals''' include both practical uses, such as for food, sport, and transport, and symbolic uses, such as in art and mythology. Mammals have played a crucial role in creating and sustaining human culture. [[Domestication]] of mammals was instrumental in the [[Neolithic revolution|Neolithic development of agriculture]] and of [[civilisation]], causing farming to replace [[hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]] around the world, and cities to replace scattered communities.

[[Mammals]] provide [[dairy products]] and much of the [[meat]] eaten by the human population, whether farmed or hunted. They also yielded [[leather]] and [[wool]] for [[clothing]] and equipment. Until the arrival of mechanised [[transport]], domesticated mammals provided a large part of the power used for work and transport. They serve as [[model organism|models]] in biological research, such as in [[genetics]], and in [[drug testing]].

Mammals are the most popular of [[pet]]s, with tens of millions of [[dog]]s, [[cat]]s and other animals including [[rabbit]]s and mice kept by families around the world. Mammals such as horses and deer are among the earliest subjects of art, being found in the [[Upper Paleolithic]] [[cave painting]]s such as at [[Lascaux]]. Major artists such as [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[George Stubbs]] and [[Edwin Landseer]] are known for their portraits of animals. Animals further play a wide variety of roles in literature, film, mythology, and religion.

A major way that people relate to mammals (and some other animals) is by [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphising]] them, ascribing human emotions and goals to them. This has been deprecated when it occurs in science, though more recently zoologists have taken a more lenient view of it.

==Context==

[[Culture]] consists of the [[social behaviour]] and [[Norm (social)|norms]] found in [[human]] [[society|societies]] and transmitted through social [[learning]]. [[Cultural universals]] in all human societies include expressive forms like [[art]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[ritual]], [[religion]], and [[technology|technologies]] like [[tool|tool usage]], [[cooking]], [[shelter (building)|shelter]], and [[clothing]]. The concept of [[material culture]] covers physical expressions such as technology, architecture and art, whereas immaterial culture includes principles of [[social organization]], [[mythology]], [[philosophy]], [[literature]], and [[science]].&lt;ref name=MacionisGerber2011&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995 |title=Sociology |last=Macionis |first=John J. |last2=Gerber |first2=Linda Marie |date=2011 |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0137001613 |page=53 |accessdate=29 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818045455/https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995 |archivedate=18 August 2017 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article describes the roles played by mammals in human culture, so defined.

==Practical uses==

===Domestication in the neolithic agricultural revolution===
[[File:Backing sheep at sheepdog competition.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Dog]]s and [[sheep]] were among the first animals to be [[Domestication|domesticated]], and they remain in wide use today.]]
{{see|Domestication|Neolithic revolution}}

[[Charles Darwin]], [[Jared Diamond]] and others have noted the importance of [[Domestication|domesticated]] mammals in the [[Neolithic revolution|neolithic development of agriculture]] and of [[civilisation]], causing farmers to replace [[hunter-gatherer]]s around the world.{{efn|Diamond discussed this matter further in his 1997 book ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]''.}}&lt;ref name=Larson&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Larson, Greger |author2=Burger, Joachim |date=April 2013 |title=A population genetics view of animal domestication |url=http://www.palaeobarn.com/sites/domestication.org.uk/files/downloads/98.pdf |journal=Trends in Genetics |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=197–205 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2013.01.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This transition from [[hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]] to [[pastoralism|herding flocks]] and [[agriculture|growing crops]] was a major step in human history. The new agricultural economies, based on domesticated mammals, caused "radical restructuring of human societies, worldwide alterations in biodiversity, and significant changes in the Earth's landforms and its atmosphere... momentous outcomes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zeder |first1=Melinda A. |title=Domestication and early agriculture in the Mediterranean Basin: Origins, diffusion, and impact |journal=PNAS|date=August 2008 |volume=105 |issue=33 |pages=11597–11604 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0801317105 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/105/33/11597.full |pmid=18697943 |pmc=2575338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diamond observed that the large mammals that were domesticated were unusual in sharing a set of desirable characteristics. They consumed a diet that humans could readily supply; they grew rapidly and gave birth frequently; they had a mild disposition; they were willing to breed in captivity; they had convenient herd dominance hierarchies; and they remained calm in enclosures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Diamond |first=Jared |authorlink=Jared Diamond |title=Evolution, consequences and future of plant and animal domestication |journal=Nature |date=August 2002 |volume=418 |pages=700–707 |doi=10.1038/nature01019 |issue=6898 |pmid=12167878}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlos Driscoll and colleagues reached a similar conclusion, observing that "it was intelligently designed changes to the genetic composition of natural biota that made the real tools. In some sense, Neolithic farmers were the first geneticists and domestic agriculture was the lever with which they moved the world." Driscoll and colleagues list recurring characteristics of domesticated mammals as "dwarfs and giants, piebald coat color, wavy or curly hair, fewer vertebrae, shorter tails, rolled tails, and floppy ears or other manifestations of [[neoteny]]."&lt;ref name=Driscoll&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Driscoll |first1=Carlos A. |last2=Macdonald |first2=David W. |last3=O'Brien |first3=Stephen J. |title=From wild animals to domestic pets, an evolutionary view of domestication |journal=PNAS |date=June 2009 |volume=106 |issue=Supplement 1 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/106/Supplement_1/9971.full |doi=10.1073/pnas.0901586106 |pages=9971–9978 |pmid=19528637 |pmc=2702791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Working animal|Working domestic animals]] including cattle and [[horse]]s have been used for work and [[transport]] from the origins of agriculture, their numbers declining with the arrival of mechanised transport and [[agricultural machinery]]. In 2004 they still provided some 80% of the power for the mainly small farms in the third world, and some 20% of the world's transport, again mainly in rural areas.

Mammals are the most popular pets in the Western world, with the most kept species being [[dog]]s, [[cat]]s, and [[rabbit]]s. For example, in America in 2012 there were some 78 million dogs, 86 million cats, and 3.5 million rabbits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shea-online.org/Portals/0/PDFs/Animals%20in%20Healthcare%20Facilities.pdf |title=Animals in Healthcare Facilities |date=2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304102728/http://www.shea-online.org/Portals/0/PDFs/Animals%20in%20Healthcare%20Facilities.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=The Humane Society of the United States |title=U.S. Pet Ownership Statistics |url=http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/pet_overpopulation/facts/pet_ownership_statistics.html |accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=USDA |title=U.S. Rabbit Industry profile |url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/emergingissues/downloads/RabbitReport1.pdf |accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a tension between the role of animals as companions to humans, and their existence as individuals with [[animal rights|rights of their own]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Role of Animals in Human Society |author=Plous, S. |date=1993 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1993.tb00906.x |journal=Journal of Social Issues |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=1–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In art===
{{further information|Animals in Christian art|Horses in art}}

Mammals have been the subjects of art from the earliest times, both historical, as in [[Ancient Egypt]], and prehistoric, as in the [[Lascaux|cave paintings at Lascaux]] and other sites in the [[Dordogne]], France and elsewhere. Major animal paintings include [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s 1515 ''[[Dürer's Rhinoceros|The Rhinoceros]]'', [[George Stubbs]]'s c. 1762 horse portrait ''[[Whistlejacket]]'', [[Edwin Landseer]]'s 1851 ''[[The Monarch of the Glen (painting)|The Monarch of the Glen]]'', and [[Henri Rousseau]]'s 1891 tiger in an imaginary landscape, ''[[Surprised!]]''.&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jones |first1=Jonathan |title=The top 10 animal portraits in art |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2014/jun/27/top-10-animal-portraits-in-art |accessdate=24 June 2016 |agency=[[The Guardian]] |date=27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attitudes towards animals==
{{further information|Anthropomorphism|Cruelty to animals}}

[[Anthropomorphism]] is the innate tendency to attribute [[human]] traits, [[emotion]]s, and intentions to animals, most commonly to mammals, and it is an important part of the way that people relate to mammals.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', 1st ed. "anthropomorphism, ''n.''"

[[File:Tortoise and hare rackham.jpg|thumb|upright|Animals dressed as humans in "The Tortoise and the Hare", from an edition of ''[[Aesop's Fables]]'' illustrated by [[Arthur Rackham]], 1912]]

In literature, [[fable]]s such as those of [[Aesop]] have been told to teach [[wisdom]] through intentional fictions about characters such as apes, asses, bears, cats, sheep, deer, dogs, foxes, hares, horses, lions, and mice.&lt;ref&gt;Philostratus, Flavius (c.210 CE). ''[http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/apollonius/life/va_5_11.html The Life of Apollonius]'', 5.14. Translated by F.C.

In the twentieth century, many of the most popular works for children have anthropomorphic characters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The top 50 children's books |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=22 Feb 2008 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1579457/The-top-50-childrens-books.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Narnia triumphs over Harry Potter |author=Borland, Sophie |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=22 Feb 2008 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1579456/Narnia-triumphs-over-Harry-Potter.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Beatrix Potter]]'s 1901''[[The Tale of Peter Rabbit]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Beatrix Potter |publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Grahame]]'s 1908 ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'', and [[C.

===In science===
Anthropomorphic language, implying the existence of intentions and emotions in animals, was deprecated for most of the 20th century, as indicating a lack of [[Objectivity (science)|scientific objectivity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1163/156853093X00091 |title=Editor's Introduction to Society and Animals|journal=Society &amp; Animals |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=1–4 |year=1993 |last1=Shapiro |first1=Kenneth J.}} Later re-published as an introduction to: {{cite book |title=Social Creatures: A Human and Animal Studies Reader |last=Flynn |first=Cliff |year=2008 |publisher=Lantern Books| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d6nT4VGleOEC&amp;pg=PA3 |isbn=1-59056-123-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927 [[Ivan Pavlov]] wrote that animals should be considered "without any need to resort to fantastic speculations as to the existence of any possible subjective states".&lt;ref&gt;Ryder, Richard. ''Animal Revolution: Changing Attitudes Towards Speciesism''. Berg, 2000, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 ''The Oxford Companion to Animal Behaviour'' still advised that "one is well advised to study the behaviour rather than attempting to get at any underlying emotion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=When Elephants Weep: Emotional Lives of Animals |last=Masson |first=Jeffrey Moussaieff |authorlink=Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson |author2=Susan McCarthy |year=1996 |publisher=Vintage |isbn=0-09-947891-9 |pages=xviii, 272}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Darwin]] however had accepted the idea of [[emotion in animals]], writing his 1872 book ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]'' on the subject.&lt;ref name="Darwin"&gt;{{Cite journal | pmc=1279921 | pmid=12042386 |date=Jun 2002 | author=Black, J | title=Darwin in the world of emotions | volume=95 | issue=6 | pages=311–3 | issn=0141-0768 | journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | url=http://www.jrsm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12042386 | format=Free full text | doi=10.1258/jrsm.95.6.311 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin believed that mammals had social, mental and moral lives. In ''[[The Descent of Man]]'' (1871), he wrote: "There is no fundamental difference between man and the higher mammals in their mental faculties."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Darwin |first1=Charles |title=The Descent of Man |date=1871 |page=34 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZvsHAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biologists remained wary of the idea, even for the [[great apes]], but this led to serious difficulties, as [[Donald O. Hebb]] explained in 1946:&lt;ref name=Hebb/&gt;

{{quote|A thoroughgoing attempt to avoid anthropomorphic description in the study of temperament was made over a two-year period at the Yerkes laboratories. All that resulted was an almost endless series of specific acts in which no order or meaning could be found. On the other hand, by the use of frankly anthropomorphic concepts of emotion and attitude one could quickly and easily describe the peculiarities of individual animals... Whatever the anthropomorphic terminology may seem to imply about conscious states in chimpanzee, it provides an intelligible and practical guide to behavior.&lt;ref name=Hebb&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/h0063033 |last=Hebb |first=Donald O. |authorlink=Donald O. Hebb |year=1946 |title=Emotion in man and animal: An analysis of the intuitive processes of recognition |journal=Psychological Review |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=88–106|pmid=21023321 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the 1960s the three leading primatologists nicknamed "[[The Trimates|Leakey's Angels]]", [[Jane Goodall]] studying [[chimpanzee]]s, [[Dian Fossey]] studying [[gorilla]]s and [[Biruté Galdikas]] studying [[orangutan]]s, were all accused of "that worst of ethological sins – anthropomorphism" as they sought to explain primate behaviour using [[empathy]].&lt;ref&gt;cited in Masson and McCarthy 1996, p9 [https://books.google.com/books?id=UcbYqb8D4IEC&amp;pg=PR19 Google books]&lt;/ref&gt; The primatologist [[Frans de Waal]] summarised the dilemma: "To endow animals with human emotions has long been a scientific [[taboo]].  But if we do not, we risk missing something fundamental, about both animals and us."&lt;ref&gt;Frans de Waal (1997-07). "Are We in Anthropodenial?". ''Discover''. pp. 50–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, there are various [[solmization]] systems (including [[solfeggio]], [[sargam (music)|sargam]], and [[numerical sight-singing]]) that assign specific syllables to different notes of the [[scale (music)|scale]]. Among other things, this makes it easier to hear how intervals sound in different contexts, such as starting on different notes of the same scale.

'''Kents Cavern''' is a cave system in [[Torquay]], Devon, England. It is notable for its [[archaeology|archaeological]] and geological features. The cave system is open to the public&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1000875.pdf |title=Kents Cavern |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc3867385"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/devon/3867385.stm |title=Visitor centre for ancient caves |publisher=BBC News |date=5 July 2004 |accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been a geological [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] since 1952 and a [[Scheduled Ancient Monument]] since 1957.

==Prehistory==

The caverns and passages were formed in the early [[Pleistocene]] period&lt;ref&gt;''Kents Cavern: A field guide to the natural history''.  Joyce Lundberg and Donald McFarlane. 2008. William Pengelly Cave Studies Trust. {{ISBN|978-0-9559514-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  by water action, and have been occupied by one of at least eight separate, discontinuous native populations to have inhabited the [[British Isles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted_sites/ahob/AHOBI/index_2.html |title=Human Occupation of the British Isles Project |publisher=Nhm.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other key [[paleolithic]] sites in the UK are [[Happisburgh]], [[Pakefield]], [[Boxgrove Quarry|Boxgrove]], [[Barnfield Pit|Swanscombe]], [[Bontnewydd Palaeolithic site|Pontnewydd]], [[Red Lady of Paviland|Paviland]], [[Creswell Crags]] and [[Cheddar Man|Gough's Cave]].

A prehistoric [[maxilla]] (upper jawbone) fragment was discovered in the cavern during a 1927 excavation by the Torquay Natural History Society, and named ''Kents Cavern 4.'' The specimen is on display at the Torquay Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.kents-cavern.co.uk/jawbone | title=Jawbone | website = Kents Cavern| accessdate = 17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/early_modern/europe/kents_cavern_short_article_2006.html |title=Kent's Cavern report on the way? &amp;#124; john hawks weblog |publisher=Johnhawks.net |date=25 December 2006 |accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 the fragment was [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dated]] to 36,400–34,700 years [[Before Present|BP]], but a 2011 study that dated fossils from neighbouring [[stratum|strata]] produced an estimate of 44,200–41,500 years BP. The same study analysed the dental structure of the fragment and determined it to be ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' rather than ''[[Homo neanderthalensis]]'', which would have made it the earliest anatomically modern human fossil yet discovered in northwestern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Modern history==

===As an archæological site===

Kents Cavern is first recorded as Kents Hole Close on a 1659 deed when the land was leased to John Black.&lt;ref name="pike5"&gt;John R. Pike, Torquay (Torquay: Torbay Borough Council Printing Services, 1994), 5&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest evidence of exploration of the caves in historic times is two inscriptions, "William Petre 1571" and "Robert Hedges 1688" engraved on [[stalagmite]]s. The first recorded [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] was that of [[Thomas Northmore]] in 1824.&lt;ref name="pike5"/&gt; Northmore's work attracted the attention of [[William Buckland]], the first Reader in Geology at the [[University of Oxford]], who sent a party including [[John MacEnery]] to explore the caves in an attempt to find evidence that [[Mithras]] was once worshipped in the area.&lt;ref name="russell107"&gt;Percy Russell, A History of Torquay (Torquay: Devonshire Press Limited, 1960), 107&lt;/ref&gt; MacEnery, the [[Roman Catholic]] chaplain at [[Torre Abbey]], conducted systematic excavations between 1824 and 1829.&lt;ref name="pike5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="russell107"/&gt; When MacEnery reported to the [[British Association]] the discovery of [[flint tool]]s below the stalagmites on the cave floor, his work was derided as contrary to Bishop [[James Ussher]]'s [[Biblical chronology]] dating the [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]] to 4004 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 108&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1845 the recently created Torquay Natural History Society requested permission from Sir Lawrence Palk to explore the caves to obtain [[fossil]]s and [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] for the planned Torquay Museum, and as a result Edward Vivian and [[William Pengelly]] were allowed to conduct excavations between 1846 and 1858.&lt;ref name="pike5"/&gt; Vivian reported to the [[Geological Society]] in 1847, but at the time, it was generally believed that early humans had entered the caves long after the formation of the cave structures examined.&lt;ref name="russell109"&gt;Russell, 109&lt;/ref&gt; This changed when in the Autumn of 1859, following the work of Pengelly at the Brixham Cavern and of [[Jacques de Perthes]] in France, the [[Royal Society]], the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]], and the British Association agreed that the excavations had established the [[antiquity of humanity]].&lt;ref name="russell109"/&gt;

In 1865 the British Association created a committee, led by Pengelly, to fully explore the cave system over the course of fifteen years.&lt;ref name="pike5"/&gt; It was Pengelly's party that discovered Robert Hedges' stalagmite inscription, and from the stalagmite's growth since that time deduced that human-created artefacts found under the formation could be half a million years old.&lt;ref&gt;Pike, 5–6&lt;/ref&gt; Pengelly plotted the position of every bone, flint, and other artefact he discovered during the excavations, and afterward continued working with the Torquay Natural History Society until his death in 1892 at his home less than 2&amp;nbsp;km from the caves.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 110&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a tourist attraction===

In 1903 Kents Cavern, then part of Lord Haldon's estate, was sold to Francis Powe, a carpenter who originally used the caves as a workshop while making beach huts for the Torquay sea front.&lt;ref name="bbc3867385"/&gt; Powe's son, Leslie Powe, turned the caves into a tourist attraction by laying concrete paths, installing electric lighting, and building visitor facilities that later were improved, in turn, by his son John Powe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/news_features/2003/kents_cavern.shtml |title=Devon Features – Kents Cavern in Torquay celebrates 100 years under the same ownership |publisher=BBC |date=31 July 2003 |accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The caves, now owned by Nick Powe, celebrated 100 years of Powe family ownership on 23 August 2003 with special events including an archæological dig for children and a display by a cave rescue team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/family_friendly/kents_cavern_100.shtml |title=Special events mark Kents Cavern's centenary |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later a new [[pound sterling|£]]500,000 visitor centre was opened, including a restaurant and gift shop.&lt;ref name="bbc3867385"/&gt;

Attracting 80,000 tourists a year, Kents Cavern is an important tourist attraction and this was recognised in 2000 when it was awarded Showcave of the Year award and later in November 2005 when it was awarded a prize for being Torquay's Visitor Attraction of the year.

===Kents Cavern in fiction===
"Hampsley Cavern" in [[Agatha Christie]]'s 1924 novel ''[[The Man in the Brown Suit]]'', is based on Kents Cavern.&lt;ref name="macaskill"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Macaskill | first = Hilary | year = 2009 | title = Agatha Christie at Home | publisher = Frances Lincoln Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 science fiction romance ''Time Watchers: The Greatest of These'', by Julie Reilly, uses Kents Cavern as a principal setting in three different time periods.

'''Kiberpipa''' ({{lang-sl|Cyberpipe}}) was a [[hackerspace]] in [[Ljubljana]], [[Slovenia]], established in 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.mladina.si/97440/kiberpipa/|title=Katalizator računalniških subkultur|publisher=Mladina|first=Jaka|last=Železnikar|date=1 October 2001|access-date=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a part of the K6/4 Institute. After a breakup with the parent organization and moving to a different location in 2013 it ceased most operations in 2015.

The hackerspace operated as a [[cultural centre]], computer laboratory and [[Internet café]] (with free wireless access) at Kersnikova 4, Ljubljana. Kiberpipa engaged primarily in open source programming, electronic art and the recycling of computer devices&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.culture.si/en/Cyberpipe|website=Culture.si|title=Cyberpipe|date=3 May 2014|access-date=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Between 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://slo-tech.com/novice/t196248|title=Otvoritev Kiberpipinega računalniškega muzeja|website=Slo-Tech|date=14 December 2005|access-date=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2013 it also hosted a small living computer museum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://boingboing.net/2009/03/12/bb-video-cyberpipes.html|archive-url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYSzoOfPsYo|title=Cyberpipe's Mecca of Vintage Computers|date=13 March 2009|access-date=25 February 2018|publisher=Boing Boing Video|first=Johannes|last=Grenzfurthner|archive-date=13 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The mostly volunteer team in the hackerspace organised workshops, lectures, and entertainment and information events, with around 150 events yearly at the height of its activity&lt;ref name="delo"&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.delo.si/zgodbe/sobotnapriloga/kiberpipa-garazna-hisa-namesto-valilnice-inovacij.html|title=Kiberpipa: garažna hiša namesto valilnice inovacij|publisher=Delo|first=Matej|last=Kovačič|date=4 May 2013|access-date=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2013, the Student Organization of [[University of Ljubljana]], the owner of the building where Kiberpipa originally operated, decided to re-purpose the building as a restaurant and a parking garage. After failing to negotiate a new position within the organization, Kiberpipa team opted to continue operating independently of the Student Organization and moved to a new location&lt;ref name="delo" /&gt;. In the same year, the Student Organization opened its own hackerspace Rampa&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://kersnikova.org/rampa/|title=Rampa: Laboratorij za hekanje znanosti, umetnosti in družbe.|publisher=Zavod Kersnikova|access-date=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2014, Kiberpipa re-opened at a new location at Gosposvetska 2 using volunteer work and donations&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://novice.kulturnik.si/cat/tehnologija/before/2014-03-29|title=Delovna akcija (sprint) v novih prostorih Kiberpipe Kiberpipa|date=28 March 2014|access-date=25 February 2018|website=Kulturnik}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It continued to organize lectures and open source software-related events at the new location until closure in 2015. In 2015 a web server malfunction also resulted in the loss of the Kiberpipa website and archived content&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.kiberpipa.org/?p=23|title=Hrčki so šli po svoje…|website=Kiberpipa|access-date=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.


== Partnerships and events ==
[[File:Kiberpipa 2010.jpg|thumb|Kiberpipa lecture in 2010]]
Kiberpipa co-operated with other organizations in Slovenia, e.g. the Slo-Tech and 3delavnica teams, regional multimedia centres (including Ljudmila - Ljubljana Digital Media Lab, [[Kibla|KIBLA Multimedia Centre]]) and organizations abroad (Mama New Media Centre in Zagreb, HackLab in Pula for example).

Kiberpipa organised the bi-annual HAIP Festival (Hack/Act/Interact/Progress Festival).

Kiberpipa was a member of the m3c Multimedia Centres Network of Slovenia.

He received a master's degree in [[Near Eastern studies]] from the [[University of Chicago]]. However, as a response to the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the 1960s, Wang switched his interests to [[Asian American studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/fixers/reports/wangint.html|title=INTERVIEW WITH LING-CHI WANG, APRIL 1997 - The Fixers - FRONTLINE - PBS|website=www.pbs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the [[Wen Ho Lee]] spying allegations, Wang and an Asian American academic organization instituted a boycott of the two labs run by the [[University of California]], in [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] and [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] in [[New Mexico]]. He also helped organize a [[class-action lawsuit]] against the labs in response to racial profiling allegations.

Wang led a movement expose the involvement of [[Republic of China (Taiwan)]]'s government role in the murder of [[Henry Liu]] in [[Daly City, California]] by [[Bamboo Union]] agents.

[[File:Denazification-street.jpg|thumb|upright|Adolf Hitler street sign being taken down in [[Trier]] during [[Denazification]]]]
This is a partial list of streets and squares named after [[Adolf Hitler]] during the era of [[Nazi Germany]].

The zeal with which German municipal authorities attempted,{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} immediately after the [[Machtergreifung|seizure of power]], to play their part in the "National Rising" ({{lang-de|Nationale Erhebung}}) is shown by the practice of conferring honorary municipal citizenship on Hitler, and even more by naming a street (''Straße''), a square or place (''Platz''), a promenade (''Anlage''), an avenue (''Damm'', ''Allee''), a stadium (''Kampfbahn''), or a bridge (''Brücke'') after the new chancellor.  As early as March and April 1933, a wave of renamings swept through Germany's cities.  Most of the examples in the list come from this period.

Before 1931, there are records of a street named Rua Adolpho Hitler in the [[Campo Belo (district of São Paulo)|Campo Belo]] district of Santo Amaro, [[Brazil]]. Its name was changed in 1931 to Rua Almirante Barroso, but when Santo Amaro was merged into [[São Paulo]] on the next year, the street was again renamed to Rua Gil Eanes, due to a homonym street in [[Brás (district of São Paulo)|Brás]].

[[Image:Log Furniture Queen Bed.jpg|thumb|Log Furniture Queen Bed]]
'''Log furniture''' is a type of [[rustic furniture]] made by incorporating the use of whole logs. It is often designed to have a "pioneer" look. Log furniture is often very durable and long-lasting, depending on the manufacturing methods used.

Log furniture, reclaimed wood furniture, and other types of [[rustic furniture]] have increased in popularity in recent years. As a result, there are many more styles and options available for those looking to furnish their mountain lodges, country homes, or log cabins. The more economical lines of log furniture are typically milled by machine and are massed produced. Shoppers looking for unique style may opt for the more expensive collections of handcrafted, one-of-a-kind log furniture.

==Manufacturing Methods==

There are various types of log furniture, from the sleek finished look to the rustic ‘craggy’ look. Building log furniture is time-consuming, and since most pieces are custom built, it can often be quite expensive. The [[mortise and tenon]] method is favored for its strength.

==Wood Types==

Log furniture can be manufactured from almost any type of wood as long as the timbers that are used  have adequate dimensions and strength. Some of the most popular types of wood include [[aspen]], [[Steam bending|steam-bent]] [[hickory]], [[pine]], [[Juniperus virginiana|aromatic red cedar]], [[Thuja occidentalis|northern white]] cedar, [[walnut]], [[Willow|and willow.]] Some log furniture is made from exotic woods such as [[Maclura pomifera|osage orange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Log Furniture Wood Types | url=http://www.logfurnitureguide.com/log-furniture-wood-types/8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==

Log furniture is often featured in country and holiday houses. It is a popular choice for cottage houses and mountain homes. It is most commonly favored in mountainous regions of America (Rocky Mountains) and Europe (Alps).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goupstate.com/article/20160425/articles/160429756&lt;/ref&gt; It is often classified as premium furniture because its cost is higher than the cost of what is considered regular furniture. Because of its nature, log furniture can be a good choice for outdoor use. With the right impregnation, it can last decades without the need of refurbishing. It rose to popularity again in the 2000's after years of decline, caused by accessibility of cheap furniture substitutes. It has now become a sign of wealth and good taste. The log furniture industry is often aimed at local markets, making it a good choice for buyers looking to support the local community.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tampabay.com/news/business/heres-how-some-tampa-bay-woodworkers-try-to-use-local-trees-to-make/2275284&lt;/ref&gt; Log furniture is strongly associated with Christmas decor in both America and Europe.

==Checking==

Certain cracks in logs are referred to as "checks" or "checking." Checking is part of the natural drying process of the wood and normally does not affect the structural integrity of the log. Checks are cracks that run vertically (with the grain). These checks can be as much as three-quarters of an inch in width, depending on the diameter of the log.

'''Madrasa''' ({{lang-ar|مدرسة}}, ''{{transl|ar|ALA|madrasah}},'' [[plural|pl.]] {{lang|ar|مدارس}}, ''{{transl|ar|ALA|madāris}}'') is the [[Arab]]ic word for any [[Types of educational institutions|type of educational institution]], secular or religious (of any religion), whether for elementary instruction or higher learning. The word is variously [[Arabic transliteration|transliterated]] ''madrasah'', ''medresa'', ''madrassa'', ''madraza'', ''medrese'', etc. In [[Western world|the West]], the word usually refers to a specific type of religious school or college for the study of the [[Islam|Islamic religion]], though this may not be the only subject studied. In countries like India, not all students in madrasas are Muslims; there is also a modern curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Shaikh Azizur Rahman (2013) [http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/spotlight/indiaonline/2013/11/madrassas-india-attract-hindu-students-2013111814457229891.html ''Madrassas in India attract Hindu students''] aljazeera.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2010}}
{{Islam|expanded=all}}
The word ''{{transl|ar|ALA|madrasah}}'' derives from the triconsonantal [[Semitic root]] د-ر-س ''D-R-S'' 'to learn, study', through the ''wazn'' (form/stem) {{rtl-lang|ar|مفعل(ة)}}; {{transl|ar|ALA|mafʻal(ah)}}, meaning "a place where something is done". Therefore, ''{{transl|ar|ALA|madrasah}}'' literally means "a place where learning and studying take place".

&lt;/ref&gt; In the Arabic language, the word {{lang|ar|مدرسة}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|madrasah}}'' simply means the same as ''school'' does in the English language, whether that is private, public or parochial school, as well as for any primary or secondary school whether [[Muslim]], non-Muslim, or secular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/glossary-madrassa-or-madrasa-2352961|title=Alternate Spellings of Madrassa|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2017-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
''{{transl|ar|ALA|Madrasah ʻāmmah}}'' ({{lang-ar|مدرسة عامة}}) translates as '[[Public school (government funded)|public school]]', ''{{transl|ar|ALA|madrasah khāṣṣah}}'' ({{lang-ar|مدرسة خاصة}}) translates as 'private school', ''{{transl|ar|ALA|madrasah dīnīyah}}'' ({{lang-ar|مدرسة دينية}}) translates as '[[Parochial school|religious school]]', ''{{transl|ar|ALA|madrasah Islāmīyah}}'' ({{lang-ar|مدرسة إسلامية}}) translates as 'Islamic school', and ''{{transl|ar|ALA|madrasah jāmiʻah}}'' ({{lang-ar|مدرسة جامعة}}) translates as 'university'.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the use of the word ''school'' in British English, the word ''{{transl|ar|ALA|madrasah}}'' more closely resembles the term ''school'' in American English, in that it can refer to a university-level or post-graduate school as well as to a primary or secondary school. For example, in the [[Ottoman Empire]] during the [[Early Modern Period]], madaris had lower schools and specialised schools where the students became known as ''danişmends''.&lt;ref name = "Ottoman"&gt;İnalcık, Halil. 1973. "Learning, the Medrese, and the Ulema." In ''The Ottoman Empire: The Classical Age 1300–1600''. New York: Praeger, pp. 165–178.
&lt;/ref&gt; The usual Arabic word for a university, however, is {{lang|ar|جامعة}}'' ({{transl|ar|ALA|jāmiʻah}})''. The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[cognate]] ''[[midrasha]]'' also connotes the meaning of a place of learning; the related term ''[[midrash]]'' literally refers to study or learning, but has acquired mystical and religious connotations.

However, in English, the term ''{{transl|ar|ALA|madrasah}}'' usually refers to the specifically Islamic institutions. A typical Islamic school usually offers two courses of study: a ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ḥifẓ}}'' course teaching memorization of the [[Qur'an]] (the person who commits the entire Qur'an to memory is called a [[Hafiz (Quran)|{{transl|ar|ALA|ḥāfiẓ}}]]); and an [[Ulema|{{transl|ar|ALA|ʻālim}}]] course leading the candidate to become an accepted scholar in the community. A regular curriculum includes courses in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], ''[[tafsir]]'' (Qur'anic interpretation), [[sharia|{{transl|ar|ALA|sharīʻah}}]] (Islamic law), [[hadith]]s (recorded sayings and deeds of [[Muhammad]]), [[mantiq]] (logic), and [[Muslim history]]. In the [[Ottoman Empire]], during the Early Modern Period, the study of hadiths was introduced by [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Süleyman I]].&lt;ref name = "Ottoman"/&gt; Depending on the educational demands, some madaris also offer additional advanced courses in [[Arabic literature]], English and other foreign languages, as well as science and world history. Ottoman madaris along with religious teachings also taught "styles of writing, grammary, syntax, poetry, composition, natural sciences, political sciences, and etiquette."&lt;ref name = "Ottoman"/&gt;

Madaris may enroll female students; however, they study separately from the men.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Islamic education==
The term "Islamic education" means education in the light of Islam itself, which is rooted in the teachings of the Qur'an - the holy book of the Muslims. Islamic education and Muslim education are not the same. Because Islamic education has epistemological integration which is founded on [[Tawhid]] - Oneness or [[monotheism]].&lt;ref&gt;Baba, S., Salleh, M. J., Zayed, T. M., &amp; Harris, R. (2015).

{{See also|Nizamiyya|List of oldest madrasahs in continuous operation}}
The first institute of madrasa education was at the estate of [[Zaid bin Arkam]] near a hill called [[Al-Safa and Al-Marwah|Safa]], where [[Muhammad]] was the teacher and the students were some of his followers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} After [[Hegira|Hijrah]] (migration) the madrasa of "Suffa" was established in [[Medina|Madina]] on the east side of the [[Al-Masjid an-Nabawi]] mosque. [[Ubada ibn as-Samit]] was appointed there by Muhammad as teacher and among the students.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} In the curriculum of the madrasa, there were teachings of The Qur'an, The Hadith, fara'iz, [[tajweed]], [[genealogy]], treatises of [[first aid]], etc. There were also trainings of horse-riding, art of war, handwriting and [[calligraphy]], [[Athletics (physical culture)|athletics]] and [[martial arts]]. The first part of madrasa based education is estimated from the first day of "[[nabuwwat]]" to the first portion of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Established in 859, [[University of Al Karaouine|{{transl|ar|ALA|Jāmiʻat al-Qarawīyīn}}]] (located in {{transl|ar|ALA|al-Qarawīyīn}} Mosque) in the city of [[Fes, Morocco|Fas]], [[Morocco]], is considered the oldest university in the world by some scholars,&lt;ref name="founding-1"&gt;while other scholars have argued that this distinction belongs to the [[University of Al-Karaouine]], also founded in 859.

During the late [[Abbasid|ʻAbbāsid]] period, the [[Seljuk dynasty|Seljuk]] vizier [[Nizam al-Mulk|{{transl|ar|ALA|Niẓām al-Mulk}}]] created one of the first major official academic institutions known in history as the [[Nizamiyyah|{{transl|ar|ALA|Madrasah Niẓāmīyah}}]], based on the informal ''{{transl|ar|ALA|majālis}}'' (sessions of the shaykhs). {{transl|ar|ALA|Niẓām al-Mulk}}, who would later be murdered by the [[Assassins (sect)|Assassins]] (''{{transl|ar|ALA|Ḥashshāshīn}}''), created a system of state madaris (in his time they were called the Niẓāmiyyahs, named after him) in various ʻAbbāsid cities at the end of the 11th century.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

During the rule of the [[Fatimid]]&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Berkey, ''The Transmission of Knowledge in Medieval Cairo'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1992), ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mamluk]]&lt;ref&gt;Ira Lapidus, ''Muslim Cities in the Later Middle Ages'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1984), ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; dynasties and their successor states in the medieval Middle East, many of the ruling elite founded madaris through a religious endowment known as the [[waqf]]. Not only was the madrasa a potent symbol of status but it was an effective means of transmitting wealth and status to their descendants. Especially during the Mamluk period, when only former slaves could assume power, the sons of the ruling {{transl|ar|ALA|Mamlūk}} elite were unable to inherit. Guaranteed positions within the new madaris thus allowed them to maintain status. Madaris built in this period include the Mosque-{{transl|ar|ALA|Madrasah}} of [[Sultan]] {{transl|ar|ALA|Ḥasan}} in Cairo.

[[Dimitri Gutas]] and the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' consider the period between the 11th and 14th centuries to be the "[[Islamic Golden Age|Golden Age]]" of Arabic and [[Islamic philosophy]], initiated by [[al-Ghazali]]'s successful [[Logic in Islamic philosophy|integration of logic]] into the {{transl|ar|ALA|madrasah}} curriculum and the subsequent rise of [[Avicennism]].&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;{{cite web|author=Tony Street|title=Arabic and Islamic Philosophy of Language and Logic|publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|date=July 23, 2008|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/arabic-islamic-language|accessdate=2008-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to religious subjects, they also taught the "rational sciences," as varied as [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|mathematics]], [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|astronomy]], [[Islamic astrology|astrology]], [[Geography and cartography in medieval Islam|geography]], [[Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam|alchemy]], [[philosophy]], magic, and [[occultism]], depending on the curriculum of the specific institution in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Between doubts and certainties: on the place of history of science in Islamic societies within the field of history of science|author=Sonja Brentjes|journal=NTM Zeitschrift für Geschichte der Wissenschaften, Technik und Medizin|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|issn=1420-9144|volume=11|issue=2|date=June 2003|doi=10.1007/BF02908588|pages=65–79 [69]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The madaris, however, were not centres of advanced scientific study; scientific advances in Islam were usually carried out by scholars working under the patronage of royal courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Sabra | first = A.

The following excerpt provides a brief synopsis of the historical origins and starting points for the teachings that took place in the Ottoman madaris in the Early Modern Period:
{{quote|
Taşköprülüzâde's concept of knowledge and his division of the sciences provides a starting point for a study of learning and medrese education in the Ottoman Empire. Taşköprülüzâde recognises four stages of knowledge—spiritual, intellectual, oral and written. Thus all the sciences fall into one of these seven categories: calligraphic sciences, oral sciences, intellectual sciences, spiritual sciences, theoretical rational sciences, and practical rational sciences. The first Ottoman medrese was created in İznik in 1331, when a converted Church building was assigned as a medrese to a famous scholar, Dâvûd of Kayseri. Suleyman made an important change in the hierarchy of Ottoman medreses. He established four general medreses and two more for specialised studies, one devoted to the ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ḥadīth}}'' and the other to medicine. He gave the highest ranking to these and thus established the hierarchy of the medreses which was to continue until the end of the empire.&lt;ref name = "Ottoman"/&gt;

===Elementary education===
{{Main article|Maktab}}
[[File:Медресе Шир-Дор на площади Регистан в Самарканде.jpg|thumb|[[Registan]], Sher-Dor Madrasa in [[Samarkand]]]]

In the medieval Islamic world, an elementary school was known as a ''{{transl|ar|ALA|maktab}}'', which dates back to at least the 10th century.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} Like madaris (which referred to higher education), a {{transl|ar|ALA|maktab}} was often attached to an endowed mosque. In the 11th century, the famous Persian [[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosopher]] and teacher [[Avicenna|{{transl|ar|ALA|Ibn Sīnā}}]] (known as ''Avicenna'' in the West), in one of his books, wrote a chapter about the ''{{transl|ar|ALA|maktab}}'' entitled "The Role of the Teacher in the Training and Upbringing of Children," as a guide to teachers working at ''{{transl|ar|ALA|maktab}}'' schools. He wrote that children can learn better if taught in [[Class (education)|classes]] instead of individual [[tuition]] from private [[tutor]]s, and he gave a number of reasons for why this is the case, citing the value of competition and [[emulation (observational learning)|emulation]] among pupils, as well as the usefulness of group discussions and [[debate]]s. {{transl|ar|ALA|Ibn Sīnā}} described the curriculum of a ''{{transl|ar|ALA|maktab}}'' school in some detail, describing the curricula for two stages of education in a ''{{transl|ar|ALA|maktab}}'' school.&lt;ref name=Asimov&gt;{{citation|title=The Age of Achievement: Vol 4|last=M. S. Asimov|first=Clifford Edmund Bosworth|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]]|year=1999|isbn=81-208-1596-3|pages=33–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Primary education====
{{transl|ar|ALA|Ibn Sīnā}} wrote that children should be sent to a ''{{transl|ar|ALA|maktab}}'' school from the age of 6 and be taught primary education until they reach the age of 14. During which time, he wrote, they should be taught the Qur'an, [[Islamic metaphysics]], Arabic, [[Islamic literature|literature]], [[Islamic ethics]], and manual skills (which could refer to a variety of practical skills).&lt;ref name=Asimov/&gt;

====Secondary education====
{{transl|ar|ALA|Ibn Sīnā}} refers to the secondary education stage of ''{{transl|ar|ALA|maktab}}'' schooling as a period of specialisation when pupils should begin to acquire manual skills, regardless of their social status. He writes that children after the age of 14 should be allowed to choose and specialise in subjects they have an interest in, whether it was reading, manual skills, literature, preaching, [[Islamic medicine|medicine]], [[Islamic mathematics|geometry]], [[Islamic economics in the world|trade and commerce]], [[Inventions in medieval Islam|craftsmanship]], or any other subject or profession they would be interested in pursuing for a future career. He wrote that this was a transitional stage and that there needs to be flexibility regarding the age in which pupils graduate, as the student's emotional development and chosen subjects need to be taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Age of Achievement: Vol 4|last=M. S. Asimov|first=Clifford Edmund Bosworth|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|year=1999|isbn=81-208-1596-3|pages=34–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Higher education===
{{See also|Ijazah}}
[[File:Ivan Bilibin 182.jpg|thumb|Courtyard of the Al-Azhar Mosque and University in [[Cairo]], Egypt]]

During its formative period, the term ''{{transl|ar|ALA|madrasah}}'' referred to a higher education institution, whose curriculum initially included only the "religious sciences", whilst [[Early Islamic philosophy|philosophy]] and the [[Islamic science|secular sciences]] were often excluded.&lt;ref name="Huff"&gt;Toby E. Huff (2003), ''The Rise of Early Modern Science: Islam, China and the West'', [[Cambridge University Press]], pp. 77–8&lt;/ref&gt; The curriculum slowly began to diversify, with many later madaris teaching both the religious and the "secular sciences",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Age of Achievement: Vol 4|last=M. S. Asimov|first=Clifford Edmund Bosworth|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|year=1999|isbn=81-208-1596-3|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Logic in Islamic philosophy|logic]], [[Islamic mathematics|mathematics]] and [[Islamic philosophy|philosophy]]. Some madaris further extended their curriculum to [[Early Muslim sociology|history]], [[politics]], [[Islamic ethics|ethics]], [[Islamic music|music]], [[metaphysics]], [[Islamic medicine|medicine]], [[Islamic astronomy|astronomy]] and [[Alchemy and chemistry in Islam|chemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=From Jami`ah to University: Multiculturalism and Christian–Muslim Dialogue|first=Syed Farid|last=Alatas|journal=Current Sociology|volume=54|issue=1|pages=112–132 [122]|doi=10.1177/0011392106058837|year=2006|quote=The main subjects taught were Quranic exegesis, theology, jurisprudence and the principles of jurisprudence, grammar and syntax, the Traditions of Muhammad(''ḥadīth''), logic and, sometimes, philosophy and mathematics. In addition to the above, other subjects such as literary studies, history, politics, ethics, music, metaphysics, medicine, astronomy and chemistry were also taught.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The curriculum of a {{transl|ar|ALA|madrasah}} was usually set by its founder, but most generally taught both the religious sciences and the physical sciences. Madaris were established throughout the Islamic world, examples being the 9th century [[University of al-Qarawiyyin]], the 10th century [[al-Azhar University]] (the most famous), the 11th century [[Nizamiyyah|{{transl|ar|ALA|Niẓāmīyah}}]], as well as 75 madaris in Cairo, 51 in [[Damascus]] and up to 44 in [[Aleppo]] between 1155 and 1260. Many more were also established in the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] cities of [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], [[Seville]], [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], [[Granada]] ([[Madrasah of Granada]]), [[Murcia]], [[Almería]], [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] and [[Cádiz]] during the [[Caliphate of Córdoba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|contribution=education|title=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|year=2008|contribution-url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/179408/education|accessdate=2008-09-30|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Ottoman Empire during the early modern period, "Madaris were divided into lower and specialised levels, which reveals that there was a sense of elevation in school. Students who studied in the specialised schools after completing courses in the lower levels became known as ''danişmends''."&lt;ref name = "Ottoman"/&gt;

While "{{transl|ar|ALA|madrasah}}" can now refer to any type of school, the term ''{{transl|ar|ALA|madrasah}}'' was originally used to refer more specifically to a medieval Islamic centre of learning, mainly teaching [[Sharia|Islamic law]] and [[Islamic theology|theology]], usually affiliated with a mosque, and funded by an early [[charitable trust]] known as ''[[waqf]]''.&lt;ref name=Alatas&gt;{{citation|title=From Jamiʻah to University: Multiculturalism and Christian–Muslim Dialogue|first=Syed Farid|last=Alatas|journal=Current Sociology|volume=54|issue=1|pages=112–132|doi=10.1177/0011392106058837|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Law school====
{{See also|Sharia|Fiqh}}

Madaris were largely centred on the study of ''{{transl|ar|ALA|fiqh}}'' (Islamic jurisprudence). The ''[[Ijazah|{{transl|ar|ALA|ijāzat al-tadrīs wa-al-iftāʼ}}]]'' ("licence to teach and issue legal opinions") in the medieval Islamic [[legal education]] system had its origins in the 9th century after the formation of the ''[[madhhab|{{transl|ar|ALA|madhāhib}}]]'' (schools of jurisprudence). George Makdisi considers the ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ijāzah}}'' to be the origin of the European doctorate.&lt;ref name="Makdisi Scholasticism"&gt;{{citation|last=Makdisi|first=George|title=Scholasticism and Humanism in Classical Islam and the Christian West|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=109|issue=2|date=April–June 1989|pages=175–182 [176]|doi=10.2307/604423|publisher=American Oriental Society|jstor=604423}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in an earlier article, he considered the ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ijāzah}}'' to be of "fundamental difference" to the medieval doctorate, since the former was awarded by an individual teacher-scholar not obliged to follow any formal criteria, whereas the latter was conferred on the student by the collective authority of the faculty.&lt;ref name="Makdisi Madrasa and University 260"&gt;George Makdisi: "Madrasa and University in the Middle Ages", ''Studia Islamica'', No. 32 (1970), pp. 255-264 (260)&lt;/ref&gt; To obtain an ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ijāzah}}'', a student "had to study in a guild school of law, usually four years for the basic undergraduate course" and ten or more years for a [[Postgraduate education|post-graduate]] course. The "doctorate was obtained after an oral examination to determine the originality of the candidate's theses", and to test the student's "ability to defend them against all objections, in disputations set up for the purpose." These were scholarly exercises practised throughout the student's "career as a graduate student of law." After students completed their post-graduate education, they were awarded ''ijaza''s giving them the status of ''[[faqih|{{transl|ar|ALA|faqīh}}]]'' 'scholar of jurisprudence', ''[[mufti|{{transl|ar|ALA|muftī}}]]'' 'scholar competent in issuing [[fatwā]]s', and ''{{transl|ar|ALA|mudarris}}'' 'teacher'.&lt;ref name="Makdisi Scholasticism"/&gt;

The Arabic term ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ijāzat al-tadrīs}}'' was awarded to [[Ulema|Islamic scholars]] who were qualified to teach. According to Makdisi, the Latin title ''licentia docendi'' 'licence to teach' in the European university may have been a translation of the Arabic,&lt;ref name="Makdisi Scholasticism"/&gt; but the underlying concept was very different.&lt;ref name="Makdisi Madrasa and University 260"/&gt; A significant difference between the ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ijāzat al-tadrīs}}'' and the ''licentia docendi'' was that the former was awarded by the individual scholar-teacher, while the latter was awarded by the chief official of the university, who represented the collective faculty, rather than the individual scholar-teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Toby Huff, ''Rise of Early Modern Science'' 2nd. ed. p. 78-79; 136, 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the study in the {{transl|ar|ALA|madrasah}} college centred on examining whether certain opinions of law were orthodox. This scholarly process of "determining orthodoxy began with a question which the Muslim layman, called in that capacity ''{{transl|ar|ALA|mustaftī}}'', presented to a [[Jurist|jurisconsult]], called ''[[mufti]]'', soliciting from him a response, called ''[[fatwa]]'', a [[legal opinion]] (the [[Sharia|religious law of Islam]] covers [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] as well as [[Religious law|religious matters]]). The ''mufti'' (professor of legal opinions) took this question, studied it, researched it intensively in the sacred scriptures, in order to find a solution to it. This process of scholarly research was called ''[[ijtihad|{{transl|ar|ALA|ijtihād}}]]'', literally, the exertion of one's efforts to the utmost limit."&lt;ref name="Makdisi Scholasticism"/&gt;

====Medical school====
{{See also|Bimaristan}}

Though [[Islamic medicine]] was most often taught at the [[bimaristan]] teaching hospitals, there were also several [[medical school|medical madaris]] dedicated to the teaching of medicine. For example, of the 155 madrasa colleges in 15th century Damascus, three of them were medical schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Gibb|first=H. A.

Toby Huff argues that no medical degrees were granted to students, as there was no faculty that could issue them, and that, therefore, no system of examination and certification developed in the Islamic tradition like that of medieval Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Toby Huff, Rise of Early Modern Science: Islam, China and the West, 2nd ed., Cambridge 2003, {{ISBN|0-521-52994-8}}, p. 191-193&lt;/ref&gt; However, the historians Andrew C.

It was conferred by the licensed masters acting as a corporation, with the consent of a Church authority, in Paris, by the Chancellor of the Cathedral Chapter... Certification in the Muslim East remained a personal matter between the master and the student. The master conferred it on an individual for a particular work, or works. Qualification, in the strict sense of the word, was supposed to be a criterion, but it was at the full discretion of the master, since, if he chose, he could give an ijaza to children hardly able to read, or even to unborn children. This was surely an abuse of the system... but no official system was involved. The ijaza was a personal matter, the sole prerogative of the person bestowing it; no one could force him to give one.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medievalist specialists who define the university as a legally autonomous corporation disagree with the term "university" for the Islamic madaris and ''jāmi‘ah''s because the [[medieval university]] (from Latin ''universitas'') was structurally different, being a legally autonomous corporation rather than a ''[[waqf]]'' institution like the madrasa and ''{{transl|ar|ALA|jāmiʻah}}''.&lt;ref&gt;Toby Huff, ''Rise of early modern science'' 2nd ed. (Cambridge University, 2003) p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the many similarities, medieval specialists have coined the term "Islamic college" for madrasa and ''{{transl|ar|ALA|jāmiʻah}}'' to differentiate them from the legally autonomous corporations that the medieval European universities were. In a sense, the madrasa resembles a [[university college]] in that it has most of the features of a university, but lacks the corporate element. Toby Huff summarises the difference as follows: {{quote|From a structural and legal point of view, the madrasa and the university were contrasting types. Whereas the madrasa was a pious endowment under the law of religious and charitable foundations (waqf), the universities of Europe were legally autonomous corporate entities that had many legal rights and privileges. These included the capacity to make their own internal rules and regulations, the right to buy and sell property, to have legal representation in various forums, to make contracts, to sue and be sued."&lt;ref&gt;Toby Huff, ''Rise of Early Modern Science: Islam, China and the West'', 2nd ed., Cambridge, 2003, p. 133-139, 149-159, 179-189 (179)&lt;/ref&gt;}} As Muslim institutions of higher learning, the madrasa had the legal designation of [[waqf]]. In central and eastern Islamic lands, the view that the madrasa, as a charitable endowment, will remain under the control of the donor (and their descendent), resulted in a "spurt" of establishment of madaris in the 11th and 12th centuries. However, in Western Islamic lands, where the [[Maliki]] views prohibited donors from controlling their endowment, madaris were not as popular. Unlike the [[corporate]] designation of Western institutions of higher learning, the waqf designation seemed to have led to the exclusion of non-orthodox religious subjects such a philosophy and natural science from the curricula.&lt;ref&gt;C.

The madrasa of {{transl|ar|ALA|al-Qarawīyīn}}, one of the two surviving madaris that predate the founding of the earliest [[medieval universities]] and are thus claimed to be the "first universities" by some authors, has acquired official university status as late as 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Shillington: "Encyclopedia of African history", Vol. 1, New York: Taylor &amp; Francis Group, 2005, {{ISBN|1-57958-245-1}}, p. 1025&lt;/ref&gt; The other, al-Azhar, did acquire this status in name and essence only in the course of numerous reforms during the 19th and 20th century, notably the one of 1961 which introduced non-religious subjects to its curriculum, such as economics, engineering, medicine, and agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Skovgaard-Petersen, Jakob.

Brill, 2010, retrieved 20/03/2010&lt;/ref&gt; It should also be noted that many medieval universities were run for centuries as Christian [[cathedral school]]s or [[monastic school]]s  prior to their formal establishment as ''universitas scholarium''; evidence of these immediate forerunners of the university dates back to the 6th century AD,&lt;ref&gt;Riché, Pierre (1978): "Education and Culture in the Barbarian West: From the Sixth through the Eighth Century", Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, {{ISBN|0-87249-376-8}}, pp. 126-7, 282-98&lt;/ref&gt; thus well preceding the earliest madaris.

Nevertheless, Makdisi has asserted that the European university borrowed many of its features from the Islamic madrasa, including the concepts of a degree and doctorate.&lt;ref name="Makdisi Scholasticism"/&gt; Makdisi and Hugh Goddard have also highlighted other terms and concepts now used in modern universities which most likely have Islamic origins, including "the fact that we still talk of professors holding the 'chairman' of their subject" being based on the "traditional Islamic pattern of teaching where the professor sits on a chair and the students sit around him", the term '[[Study circle|academic circles]]' being derived from the way in which Islamic students "sat in a circle around their professor", and terms such as "having '[[fellow]]s', '[[Reading education|reading]]' a subject, and obtaining 'degrees', can all be traced back" to the Islamic concepts of ''{{transl|ar|ALA|aṣḥāb}}'' ('[[Sahaba|companions]], as of Muhammad'), ''{{transl|ar|ALA|qirāʼah}}'' ('reading aloud the Qur'an') and ''[[ijazah|{{transl|ar|ALA|ijāzah}}]]'' ('licence [to teach]') respectively. Makdisi has listed eighteen such parallels in terminology which can be traced back to their roots in Islamic education. Some of the practices now common in modern universities which Makdisi and Goddard trace back to an Islamic root include "practices such as delivering inaugural lectures, wearing academic robes, obtaining doctorates by defending a thesis, and even the idea of [[academic freedom]] are also modelled on Islamic custom."&lt;ref name="RelationsHughGoddard1"&gt;{{citation|title=A History of Christian-Muslim Relations|first=Hugh|last=Goddard|year=2000|publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]|isbn=0-7486-1009-X|page=100|oclc=237514956}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Islamic scholarly system of ''[[fatwa|{{transl|ar|ALA|fatwá}}]]'' and ''[[ijma|{{transl|ar|ALA|ijmāʻ}}]]'', meaning [[opinion]] and [[consensus]] respectively, formed the basis of the "scholarly system the West has practised in university scholarship from the Middle Ages down to the present day."&lt;ref name=G-Makdisi&gt;{{citation|last=Makdisi|first=George|title=Scholasticism and Humanism in Classical Islam and the Christian West|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=109|issue=2|date=April–June 1989|pages=175–182 [175–77]|doi=10.2307/604423|publisher=American Oriental Society|jstor=604423}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Makdisi and Goddard, "the idea of academic freedom" in universities was also "modelled on Islamic custom" as practised in the medieval Madrasa system from the 9th century. Islamic influence was "certainly discernible in the foundation of the first deliberately planned university" in Europe, the [[University of Naples Federico II]] founded by [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]] in 1224.&lt;ref name="RelationsHughGoddard1"/&gt;

Institutions of Learning in Islam and the West by George Makdisi", Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 104, No. 3 (Jul. - Sep., 1984), pp. 586-588 (587)&lt;/ref&gt; a view shared by Hugh Kennedy.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Kennedy: ''Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society'', Third Series, Vol. 2, No. 2 (1992), pp. 272-273 (272): {{quote|It is more likely that the undeniable similarities sprang from similar circumstances. Both cultural traditions had sacred writings which needed to be examined, both had systems of law that looked back to ancient precedent, neither culture knew printing (which meant that dictation and verbal communication were so important).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toby Huff, in a discussion of Makdisi's hypothesis, argues:
{{quote|It remains the case that no equivalent of the bachelor's degree, the licentia docendi, or higher degrees ever emerged in the medieval or early modern Islamic madrasas.&lt;ref&gt;Toby Huff, ''Rise of Early Modern Science: Islam, China and the West'', 2nd ed., Cambridge 2003, {{ISBN|0-521-52994-8}}, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[George Saliba]] criticized Huff's views regarding the legal autonomy of European universities and limited curriculum of Madrasahs, demonstrating that there were many Madrasahs dedicated to the teaching of non-religious subjects and arguing that Madrasahs generally had greater legal autonomy than medieval European universities. According to Saliba, Madrasahs "were fully protected from interference in their curriculum by the [[Waqf|very endowments]] that established them in the first place." Examples include the Dakhwariyya madrasah in [[Damascus]], which was [[Medicine in medieval Islam|dedicated to medicine]], a subject also taught at [[Bimaristan|Islamic hospitals]]; the Madrasah established by Kamal al-Din Ibn Man`a (d. 1242) in [[Mosul]] which taught astronomy, [[Islamic music|music]], and the [[Old Testament|Old]] the [[New Testament]]s; [[Ulugh Beg]]’s Madrasah in [[Samarqand]] which taught [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|astronomy]]; and [[Shia Islam|Shi`i]] madrasahs in [[Iran]] which taught astronomy along with religious studies. According to Saliba:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=[[George Saliba]]|title=Flying Goats And Other Obsessions: A Response to Toby Huff's Reply|journal=Bulletin of the Royal Institute for Inter-Faith Studies|volume=4|issue=2|year=2002|url=http://baheyeldin.com/history/george-saliba-2.html|accessdate=2010-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|As I noted in my original article, students in the medieval Islamic world, who had the full freedom to chose their teacher and the subjects that they would study together, could not have been worse off than today’s students, who are required to pursue a specific curriculum that is usually designed to promote the ideas of their elders and preserve tradition, rather than introduce them to innovative ideas that challenge ‘received texts.’ Moreover, if Professor Huff had looked more carefully at the European institutions that produced science, he would have found that they were mainly academies and royal courts protected by individual potentates and not the universities that he wishes to promote. But neither universities nor courts were beyond the reach of the [[Inquisition]], which is another point that he seems to neglect.}}

===Female education===
{{See also|Women in Islam|Women's literary salons and societies in the Arab World|List of female Muslim scholars}}

Prior to the 12th century, women accounted for less than one percent of the world’s Islamic scholars. However, [[al-Sakhawi]] and [[Mohammad Akram Nadwi]] have since found evidence of over 8,000 female scholars since the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nadwi|first=Mohammad Akram|title=al-Muhaddithat|date=2013|publisher=Oxford: Interface Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; al-Sakhawi devotes an entire volume of his 12-volume [[biographical dictionary]] ''{{transl|ar|ALA|al-Ḍawʾ al-lāmiʻ}}'' to female scholars, giving information on 1,075 of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Women in Iran from the Rise of Islam to 1800|last=Guity Nashat|first=Lois Beck|publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]|year=2003|isbn=0-252-07121-2|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the scholar Mohammad Akram Nadwi, currently a researcher from the [[Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies]], has written 40 volumes on the [[muhaddith|{{transl|ar|ALA|muḥaddithāt}}]] (the women scholars of hadith), and found at least 8,000 of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/25/magazine/25wwlnEssay.t.html|title=A Secret History|date=25 February 2007|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From around 750, during the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], women "became renowned for their brains as well as their beauty".&lt;ref&gt;Doreen Insgrams (1983), ''The Awakened: Women in Iraq'', p. 22, Third World Centre for Research and Publishing Ltd., Lebanon&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, many well known women of the time were trained from childhood in [[Arabic music|music]], dancing and [[Arabic poetry|poetry]]. Mahbuba was one of these. Another feminine figure to be remembered for her achievements was Tawaddud, "a slave girl who was said to have been bought at great cost by [[Harun al-Rashid|{{transl|ar|ALA|Hārūn al-Rashīd}}]] because she had passed her examinations by the most eminent [[Ulema|scholars]] in [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|astronomy]], [[Medicine in medieval Islam|medicine]], [[Sharia|law]], [[Early Islamic philosophy|philosophy]], [[Islamic music|music]], [[Muslim history|history]], [[Arabic grammar]], [[Arabic literature|literature]], [[Islamic theology|theology]] and [[chess]]".&lt;ref&gt;Doreen Insgrams (1983), ''The Awakened: Women in Iraq'', p. 23, Third World Centre for Research and Publishing Ltd., Lebanon&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, among the most prominent feminine figures was Shuhda who was known as "the Scholar" or "the Pride of Women" during the 12th century in [[Baghdad]]. Despite the recognition of women's aptitudes during the Abbasid dynasty, all these came to an end in [[Iraq]] with the [[Battle of Baghdad (1258)|sack of Baghdad]] in 1258.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Nutting, ''The Arabs''. (Hollis and Carter, 1964), p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;

Women played an important role in the foundations of many Islamic educational institutions, such as [[Fatima al-Fihri]]'s founding of the [[University of Al Karaouine]] in 859. This continued through to the [[Ayyubid dynasty]] in the 12th and 13th centuries, when 160 mosques and madaris were established in Damascus, 26 of which were funded by women through the [[Waqf]] ([[charitable trust]]) system. Half of all the royal [[patrons]] for these institutions were also women.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Daily Life in the Medieval Islamic World|first=James E.|last=Lindsay|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|year=2005|isbn=0-313-32270-8|page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Sunni]] scholar [[Ibn Asakir|{{transl|ar|ALA|Ibn ʻAsākir}}]] in the 12th century, there were opportunities for [[female education]] in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], writing that women could study, earn ''[[ijazah]]s'' ([[academic degree]]s), and qualify as [[Ulema|scholars]] and teachers. This was especially the case for learned and scholarly families, who wanted to ensure the highest possible education for both their sons and daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Daily Life in the Medieval Islamic World|first=James E.|last=Lindsay|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|year=2005|isbn=0-313-32270-8|pages=196 &amp; 198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn ʻAsakir had himself studied under 80 different female teachers in his time. Female education in the Islamic world was inspired by [[Muhammad's wives]], such as [[Khadijah]], a successful businesswoman, and 'A'isha, a strong leader and interpreter of the Prophet's actions. According to a hadith attributed both to Muhammad and 'A'isha, the women of Medina were praiseworthy because of their desire for religious knowledge:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Daily Life in the Medieval Islamic World|first=James E.|last=Lindsay|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|year=2005|isbn=0-313-32270-8|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=ibn al-Hajjaj|first1=Muslim|title=Sahih Muslim|url=https://sunnah.com/muslim/3/72|accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|How splendid were the women of the ''ansar''; shame did not prevent them from becoming learned in the faith.}}

While it was not common for women to enroll as students in formal [[Class (education)|classes]], it was common for women to attend informal lectures and study sessions at mosques, madaris and other public places. While there were no legal restrictions on female education, some men did not approve of this practice, such as Muhammad ibn al-Hajj (d. 1336) who was appalled at the behaviour of some women who informally [[Academic audit|audited]] lectures in his time:&lt;ref name=Lindsay&gt;{{citation|title=Daily Life in the Medieval Islamic World|first=James E.|last=Lindsay|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|year=2005|isbn=0-313-32270-8|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[Consider] what some women do when people gather with a shaykh to hear [the recitation of] books. At that point women come, too, to hear the readings; the men sit in one place, the women facing them. It even happens at such times that some of the women are carried away by the situation; one will stand up, and sit down, and shout in a loud voice. [Moreover,] her ''awra'' will appear; in her house, their exposure would be forbidden — how can it be allowed in a mosque, in the presence of men?}}

The term ''[[Awrah|{{transl|ar|ALA|ʻawrah}}]]'' is often translated as 'that which is indecent', which usually meant the exposure of anything other than a woman's face and hands, although scholarly interpretations of the ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ʻawrah}}'' and [[hijab|{{transl|ar|ALA|ḥijāb}}]] have always tended to vary, with some more or less strict than others.&lt;ref name=Lindsay/&gt;

==Madaris by region==

===Madaris in the Ottoman Empire===
"The first Ottoman Medrese was created in İznik in 1331 and most Ottoman medreses followed the traditions of Sunni Islam."&lt;ref name = "Ottoman"/&gt; "When an Ottoman sultan established a new medrese, he would invite scholars from the Islamic world—for example, [[Murad II]] brought scholars from Persia, such as ʻAlāʼ al-Dīn and Fakhr al-Dīn who helped enhance the reputation of the Ottoman medrese".&lt;ref name = "Ottoman"/&gt; This reveals that the Islamic world was interconnected in the early modern period as they travelled around to other Islamic states exchanging knowledge. This sense that the Ottoman Empire was becoming modernised through [[globalization]] is also recognised by Hamadeh who says: "Change in the eighteenth century as the beginning of a long and unilinear march toward westernisation reflects the two centuries of reformation in sovereign identity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hamadeh | first1 = Shirine | year = 2004 | title = Ottoman Expressions of Early Modernity and the 'Inevitable' Question of Westernization | url = | journal = The Journal of Architectural Historians | volume = 63 | issue = 1| pages = 32–51 | doi=10.2307/4127991}}&lt;/ref&gt;
İnalcık also mentions that while scholars from for example Persia travelled to the Ottomans in order to share their knowledge, Ottomans travelled as well to receive education from scholars of these Islamic lands, such as Egypt, Persia and Turkestan.&lt;ref name = "Ottoman"/&gt; Hence, this reveals that similar to today's modern world, individuals from the early modern society travelled abroad to receive education and share knowledge and that the world was more interconnected than it seems. Also, it reveals how the system of "schooling" was also similar to today's modern world where students travel abroad to different countries for studies. Examples of Ottoman madaris are the ones built by [[Mehmed the Conqueror]]. He built eight madaris that were built "on either side of the mosque where there were eight higher madaris for specialised studies and eight lower medreses, which prepared students for these."&lt;ref name = "Ottoman"/&gt; The fact that they were built around, or near mosques reveals the religious impulses behind madrasa building and it reveals the interconnectedness between institutions of learning and religion. The students who completed their education in the lower medreses became known as danismends.&lt;ref name = "Ottoman"/&gt; This reveals that similar to the education system today, the Ottomans' educational system involved different kinds of schools attached to different kinds of levels. For example, there were lower madaris and specialised ones, and for one to get into the specialised area meant that he had to complete the classes in the lower one in order to adequately prepare himself for higher learning.&lt;ref name = "Ottoman"/&gt;

[[File:Yakutiye Madrasah in 1840.jpg|thumb|[[Yakutiye Medrese]] in [[Erzurum]], 1840]]
This is the rank of madaris in the Ottoman Empire from the highest ranking to the lowest: (From İnalcık, 167).&lt;ref name = "Ottoman"/&gt;
# Semniye
# Darulhadis
# Madaris built by earlier sultans in Bursa.
# Madaris endowed by great men of state.

Although Ottoman madaris had a number of different branches of study, such as calligraphic sciences, oral sciences, and intellectual sciences, they primarily served the function of an Islamic centre for spiritual learning. "The goal of all knowledge and in particular, of the spiritual sciences is knowledge of God."&lt;ref name = "Ottoman"/&gt; Religion, for the most part, determines the significance and importance of each science. As İnalcık mentions: "Those which aid religion are good and sciences like astrology are bad."&lt;ref name = "Ottoman"/&gt;
However, even though mathematics, or studies in logic were part of the madrasa's curriculum, they were all centred around religion. Even mathematics had a religious impulse behind its teachings. "The Ulema of the Ottoman medreses held the view that hostility to logic and mathematics was futile since these accustomed the mind to correct thinking and thus helped to reveal divine truths"&lt;ref name = "Ottoman"/&gt; – key word being "divine". İnalcık also mentions that even philosophy was only allowed to be studied so that it helped to confirm the doctrines of Islam."&lt;ref name = "Ottoman"/&gt; Hence, madaris – schools were basically religious centres for religious teachings and learning in the Ottoman world. Although scholars such as Goffman have argued that the Ottomans were highly tolerant and lived in a pluralistic society, it seems that schools that were the main centres for learning were in fact heftily religious and were not religiously pluralistic, but centred around Islam. Similarly, in Europe "Jewish children learned the Hebrew letters and texts of basic prayers at home, and then attended a school organised by the synagogue to study the Torah."&lt;ref name = "WH"&gt;Wiesner-Hanks, E. Merry. ''Early Modern Europe 1450–1789''. New York: U of Cambridge P, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Wiesner-Hanks also says that Protestants also wanted to teach "proper religious values."&lt;ref name = "WH"/&gt; This shows that in the early modern period, Ottomans and Europeans were similar in their ideas about how schools should be managed and what they should be primarily focused on. Thus, Ottoman madaris were very similar to present day schools in the sense that they offered a wide range of studies; however, these studies, in their ultimate objective, aimed to further solidify and consolidate Islamic practices and theories.

====Curricula====
As is previously mentioned, religion dominated much of the knowledge and teachings that were endowed upon students. "Religious learning as the only true science, whose sole aim was the understanding of God's word."&lt;ref name = "Ottoman"/&gt; Thus, it is important to keep this impulse in mind when going over the curriculum that was taught.

The following is taken from İnalcık.&lt;ref name = "Ottoman"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* A) Calligraphic sciences—such as styles of writing.
* B) Oral sciences—such as Arabic language, grammar and syntax.
* C) Intellectual sciences—logic in Islamic philosophy.
* D) Spiritual sciences—theoretical, such as Islamic theology and mathematics; and practical, such as Islamic ethics and politics.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Social life and the medrese====
As with any other country during the Early Modern Period, such as Italy and Spain in Europe, the Ottoman social life was interconnected with the medrese. Medreses were built in as part of a Mosque complex where many programmes, such as aid to the poor through soup kitchens, were held under the infrastructure of a mosque, which reveals the interconnectedness of religion and social life during this period. "The mosques to which medreses were attached, dominated the social life in Ottoman cities."&lt;ref name = "Goffman"&gt;Goffman, Daniel. ''The Ottoman Empire and Early Modern Europe''. United Kingdom: U of Cambridge P, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Social life was not dominated by religion only in the Muslim world of the Ottoman Empire; it was also quite similar to the social life of Europe during this period. As Goffman says: "Just as mosques dominated social life for the Ottomans, churches and synagogues dominated life for the Christians and Jews as well."&lt;ref name = "Goffman"/&gt; Hence, social life and the medrese were closely linked, since medreses taught many curricula, such as religion, which highly governed social life in terms of establishing orthodoxy. "They tried moving their developing state toward Islamic orthodoxy."&lt;ref name = "Goffman"/&gt; Overall, the fact that mosques contained medreses comes to show the relevance of education to religion in the sense that education took place within the framework of religion and religion established social life by trying to create a common religious orthodoxy. Hence, medreses were simply part of the social life of society as students came to learn the fundamentals of their societal values and beliefs.

===Madaris in South Asia===

====Bangladesh====
There are three different madrasa education systems in Bangladesh: the original darse nizami system, the redesigned nizami system, and the higher syllabus alia nisab. The first two categories are commonly called [[Qawmi]] or non-government madaris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Siddiqi |first=ABM Saiful Islam |year=2012 |chapter=Madrasah |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Madrasah |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst them the most notable are [[Al-Jamiatul Ahlia Darul Ulum Moinul Islam]] in Hathazari, [[Al-Jamiah Al-Islamiah Patiya]], in Patiya, and [[Jamia Tawakkulia Renga Madrasah]] in [[Sylhet]].

In [[India]] the majority of these schools follow the [[Hanafi]] school of thought. The religious establishment forms part of the mainly two large divisions within the country, namely the Deobandis, who dominate in numbers (of whom the [[Darul Uloom Deoband]] constitutes one of the biggest madaris) and the [[Barelvi]]s, who also make up a sizeable portion (Sufi-oriented). Some notable establishments include: [[Al Jamiatul Ashrafia]], Mubarakpur, Manzar Islam Bareilly, Jamia Nizamdina New Delhi, Jamia Nayeemia Muradabad which is one of the largest learning centres for the Barelvis. The HR{{Clarify|date=May 2010}} ministry of the government of India has recently{{When|date=June 2011}} declared that a Central Madrasa Board would be set up. This will enhance the education system of madaris in India. Though the madaris impart Quranic education mainly, efforts are on to include Mathematics, Computers and science in the curriculum.
In July 2015, the state government of [[Maharashtra]] created a stir de-recognised madrasa education, receiving critisicm from several political parties with the NCP accusing the ruling BJP of creating Hindu-Muslim friction in the state, and Kamal Farooqui of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board saying it was "ill-designed"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/07/indian-state-derecognises-madrassa-education-150702141231360.html|title=Indian state de-recognises madrasa education|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Expansion
After the British occupation of India and the emergence of Darul Ulum Manazar-e Islam Bareilly Sharif, Indian Muslim Scholars left India to establish madaris in other regions of the world. Some of the most notable of these madaris are Darul Ulum Holocombe, which produced scholars such as [[Shaikh Ibrahim Memon Madani]], or [[Darul Uloom Al-Madania]]. These offshoot schools symbolise an emotional drive based upon both religion and patriotism that is not evident elsewhere.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

; Madaris and Arabic Colleges in Kerala
{{main article|Education in Kerala#Madrasas and Arabic Colleges}}

The [[Arabic]] and Islamic educational system has also become a channel for employment in the Middle East in modern times in Kerala.&lt;ref&gt;Yoginder Sikand. Bastions of Believers: Madrasas and Islamic Education in India. (Delhi: Penguin Books), 2005, pp. 122-125&lt;/ref&gt;  Originating in 8th century [[madrasas|madaris]] for primary children, Arabic and Islamic schooling in Kerala was patronised and funded by the British colonial government.

Today, the system of Arabic and Islamic education has grown and further integrated with [[Kerala]] government administration.  In 2005, an estimated 6,000 Muslim Arabic teachers taught in Kerala government schools, with over 500,000 Muslim students.  State-appointed committees, not private mosques or religious scholars outside the government, determine the curriculum and accreditation of  new schools and colleges.  Primary education in Arabic and Islamic studies is available to [[Mappila|Kerala Muslims]] almost entirely in after-school madrasa programs - sharply unlike full-time madaris common in north India, which may replace formal schooling.  Arabic colleges (over eleven of which exist within the state-run [[University of Calicut]] and the [[Kannur University]]) provide B.A. and Masters' level degrees.  At all levels, instruction is co-educational, with many women instructors and professors.&lt;ref name="Yoginder Sikand 2005, p. 126-128"&gt;Yoginder Sikand.

Bastions of Believers: Madrasas and Islamic Education in India. (Delhi: Penguin Books), 2005, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[Malayam]] rather than [[Urdu]] as the [[lingua franca]] of Kerala Muslims, these madaris and colleges are relatively unknown and unlinked from [[Urdu]]-based madaris in the rest of India, due to the linguistic barrier.&lt;ref name="Yoginder Sikand 2005, p. 126-128"/&gt;

The madaris rose as colleges of learning in the Islamic world in the 11th century, though there were institutions of learning earlier. They catered not only to the religious establishment, though that was the dominant influence over them, but also the secular one. To the latter they supplied physicians, administrative officials, judges and teachers. Even to this day many Registered madaris are Working effectively and coping up with Modern Education System such as Jamia-tul-Madina which is a chain of Islamic schools in Pakistan and in European and other countries established by [[Dawat-e-Islami]]. The Jamia-tul-Madina are also known as Faizan-e-Madina. Dawat-e-Islami has grown its network of Madaris from Pakistan to Europe.

===Madaris in Southeast Asia===
In Southeast Asia, Muslim students have a choice of attending a secular government or an Islamic school. Madaris or Islamic schools are known as ''Sekolah Agama'' ({{lang-ms|religious school}}) in [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]], โรงเรียนศาสนาอิสลาม ({{lang-th|school of Islam}}) in [[Thailand]] and ''madaris'' in the [[Philippines]]. In countries where Islam is not the majority or state religion, Islamic schools are found in regions such as southern Thailand (near the Thai-Malaysian border) and the southern Philippines in [[Mindanao]], where a significant Muslim population can be found.

In 2009, MUIS introduced the "Joint Madrasah System" (JMS), a joint collaboration of Madrasah Al-Irsyad Al-Islamiah primary school and secondary schools Madrasah Aljunied Al-Islamiah (offering the ''ukhrawi'', or religious stream) and Madrasah Al-Arabiah Al-Islamiah (offering the academic stream).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About JMS|url=http://www.muis.gov.sg/cms/JMS/subpage.aspx?id=17539|publisher=[[Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura|muis.gov.sg]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The JMS aims to introduce the [[International Baccalaureate]] (IB) programme into the Madrasah Al-Arabiah Al-Islamiah by 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JMS Timeline|url=http://www.muis.gov.sg/cms/JMS/subpage.aspx?id=17587|publisher=[[Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura|muis.gov.sg]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students attending a madrasah are required to wear the traditional Malay attire, including the [[songkok]] for boys and [[tudong]] for girls, in contrast to mainstream government schools which ban religious headgear as Singapore is officially a secular state. For students who wish to attend a mainstream school, they may opt to take classes on weekends at the ''madrasah'' instead of enrolling full-time.

====Philippines====
{{Main article|Education in the Philippines}}
In 2004, madaris were mainstreamed in 16 [[Regions of the Philippines|Regions]] nationwide, primarily in Muslim-majority areas in [[Mindanao]] under the auspices of the [[Department of Education (Philippines)|Department of Education]] (DepEd). The DepEd adopted ''Department Order No. 51'', which instituted Arabic-language and Islamic Values instruction for Muslim children in state schools, and authorised implementation of the Standard Madrasa Curriculum (SMC) in private-run madaris. While there are state-recognised Islamic schools, such as Ibn Siena Integrated School in the [[Islamic City of Marawi]], Sarang Bangun LC in [[Zamboanga City|Zamboanga]] and SMIE in [[Jolo]], their Islamic studies programmes initially varied in application and content.

Since 2005, the [[AusAID]]-funded DepEd project Basic Education Assistance for Mindanao (BEAM) has assisted a group of private madaris seeking a Permit To Operate from the government and implement the SMC. These private madaris are scattered throughout Regions [[Davao Region|XI]], [[SOCCSKSARGEN Region|XII]] and the [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]].

===Madaris in Muslim-minority countries===

[[File:Yangzhou - Muslim kindergarten - P1130207.JPG|thumb|A [[Islam in China|Muslim]] [[kindergarten]] in [[Yangzhou]], China]]

====South Africa====
In South Africa, the madaris also play a social and cultural role in giving after-school religious instruction to children of Muslims who attend government or private non-religious schools. However, increasing numbers of more affluent Muslims' children attend fully-fledged private Islamic schools, which combine secular and religious education. Among Muslims of [[Asians in South Africa|Indian]] origin, madaris also used to provide instruction in Urdu, although this is far less common today than it used to be.

==== Canada ====

The first Madressa established in North America, Al-Rashid Islamic Institute, was established in Cornwall, Ontario in 1983 and has graduates who are [[Hafiz (Quran)]] and [[Ulama]]. The seminary was established by Mazhar Alam under the direction of his teacher the leading Indian Tablighi scholar Muhammad Zakariya Kandhlawi  and focuses on the Hanafi school of thought . Due to its proximity to the US border city of Messina the school has historically had a high ratio of US students. Their most prominent graduate Shaykh Muhammad Alshareef completed his Hifz in the early 1990s then went on to form the [[AlMaghrib Institute]].

====United States====
On May 26, 2012, Congressman [[André Carson]] of Indiana called for additional Madaris in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://nation.foxnews.com/andre-carson/2012/07/05/muslim-congressman-american-schools-should-be-modeled-after-madrassas-where-foundation-koran | title=Muslim Congressman: American Schools Should Be Modeled After Madrassas, 'Where The Foundation Is The Koran' |publisher=Fox News Channel |date=July 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a madrassa in [[Woodside, Queens|Queens, NY]] called Shia Ithna-Asheri Jamaat of New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sijny.org/site/docs/membership/sijny_application.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130301170650/http%3A//www.sijny.org/site/docs/membership/sijny_application.pdf |archivedate=2013-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; à It would be  Presently, the Darul Uloom in New York City, an affiliate of [[Darul Uloom Haqqania]] in Pakistan, also serves as a madrassa.

==Misuse of the word==
Western commentators [[post-9/11]] often perceive madaris as places of radical revivalism with a connotation of [[anti-Americanism]] and [[Extremism|radical extremism]], frequently associated in the Western press with [[Wahhabism#Attitudes towards Non-Muslims|Wahhabi attitudes toward non-Muslims]]. In Arabic the word ''madrasa'' simply means "school" and does not imply a political or religious affiliation, radical or otherwise.  Madaris have  varied curricula, and are not all religious. Some madaris in India, for example, have a secularised identity.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4829140.stm | work=BBC News | title=What role for madrassas that teach Hindus? | date=2006-03-31 | accessdate=2010-05-12 | first=Sunita | last=Nahar}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Although early madaris were founded primarily to gain "knowledge of God" they also taught subjects such as mathematics and poetry. For example, in the Ottoman Empire, "Madrasahs had seven categories of sciences that were taught, such as: styles of writing, oral sciences like the Arabic language, grammar, rhetoric, and history and intellectual sciences, such as logic."&lt;ref name = "Ottoman"/&gt; This is similar to the Western world, in which universities began as institutions of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic church]].

The [[Yale Center for the Study of Globalization]] examined bias in United States newspaper coverage of Pakistan since the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], and found the term has come to contain a loaded political meaning:&lt;ref name=YG20070621&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;When articles mentioned "madrassas," readers were led to infer that all schools so-named are anti-American, anti-Western, pro-terrorist centres having less to do with teaching basic literacy and more to do with political indoctrination.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Various American public figures have, in recent times, used the word in a negative context, including [[Newt Gingrich]],&lt;ref name="YG20070621"/&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' published in January 2007 a correction for misusing the word "madrassa" in a way that assumed it meant a radical Islamic school. The correction stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
An article [...] about a pointed exchange [...] over a Web site report that said Senator Barack Obama had attended an Islamic school or madrassa in Indonesia as a child referred imprecisely to madrassas. While some [madrassas] teach a radical version of Islam, most historically have not.&lt;ref name=NYTapology&gt;

'''''Metropolis''''' is a 32-to-48-page free monthly city guide, news and [[classified ad]]s glossy magazine published by Japan Partnership [[Kabushiki gaisha|KK]] targeting English-speaking foreigners in [[Tokyo]], Japan.&lt;ref name="abc" /&gt; As of April 2011, its circulation was claimed to be 30,000.&lt;ref name="Gianni"&gt;Simone, Gianni, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20110426zg.html English mags approach milestone, crossroads]", ''The Japan Times'', 26 April 2011, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The magazine was first published in 1994 as the ''Tokyo Classified''. Early editions, in the broadsheet style, consisted of classified advertisements sourced from shop notice boards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Billy Adams|url=http://www.markdevlin.com/Articles/businessam/businessam.htm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120919011347/http://www.markdevlin.com/Articles/businessam/businessam.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=19 September 2012|title=Big in Japan|accessdate=28 April 2007|work=Business A.M|date=11 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially distributed with the ''[[Daily Yomiuri]]'', the publisher created an independent distribution network after the newspaper censored advertisements it found objectionable. The magazine is distributed to companies, embassies, hotels, bars, and restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jonathon Walsh|url=http://www.ea-tokyo.com/seminars/seminarsummaries/20040907.php|title=Life in the Metropolis: Mark Devlin, CEO &amp; Publisher, Crisscross K.K.|work=Entrepreneur Association of Tokyo|date=7 September 2004|accessdate=23 February 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314003058/http://www.ea-tokyo.com/seminars/seminarsummaries/20040907.php|archivedate=14 March 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The magazine was originally owned and operated by Mark and Mary Devlin, renamed ''Metropolis'' in 2001, and sold to Japan Inc. Holdings in 2007.&lt;ref name="Gianni"/&gt;

Since 1999 the magazine hosted an annual Halloween party "Glitterball" at [[Roppongi|Roppongi's]] [[Velfarre]] club, and now that Velfarre is defunct, at other notable clubs around Tokyo. Between 2003 and 2010, ''Metropolis'' donated some of the profits each year to the [[Make-A-Wish Foundation]] of Japan and the [[YMCA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Karen Foster|title=A Good Cause|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20060307zg.html|work=The Japan Times|accessdate=23 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mitigated speech''' is a [[linguistic]] term describing deferential or indirect speech inherent in communication between individuals of perceived [[Geert Hofstede|High Power Distance]] which has been in use for at least two decades with many published references.&lt;ref&gt;Ng, Sik H. and Bradac, James J. : ''Power in Language: Verbal Communication and Social Influence (Language and Language Behavior)''  Sage Publications, Inc (May 25, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, William Peter and Tajfel, Henri: [https://books.google.com/books?id=toHSl37qbfMC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;lpg=PA193&amp;dq=Ng++Bradac+Power+in+Language&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=o27ICSXtLK&amp;sig=tHbmqXj0s68-p-ye1JD9ereSDjs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gZTQSdGMCs6dkAXf9-jZCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA193,M1 Social Groups and Identities] Routledge (1996) Retrieved 2009-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kasper, Gabriele and Blum-Kulka, Shoshana: [https://books.google.com/books?id=QAsbd2oi7LMC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;lpg=PA170&amp;dq=%22mitigated+speech%22+linguistics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UbqYXTVmQU&amp;sig=VrYIEFLQ8TkAo9UnsZS70QHJKRA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7pPQScSEJ4iMkAWllOTjCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result" Interlanguage Pragmatics] Oxford (1993). Retrieved 2009-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Hare, D., and Roscoe, S. ''Flightdeck performance - the human factor''. Ames: Iowa State University Press (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term was popularized by  [[Malcolm Gladwell]] in his book, ''[[Outliers (book)|Outliers]]'', where he defines mitigated speech as "any attempt to downplay or sugarcoat the meaning of what is being said".&lt;ref&gt;Gladwell, Malcolm: ''Outliers: The Story of Success'', Penguin (2008) p.194&lt;/ref&gt; He continues with reference to Fischer and Orasanu,&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Ute and Orasanu, Judith: ''Cultural Diversity and Crew Communication'', paper presented at Astronautical Congress, Amsterdam; American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; to describe 6 degrees of mitigation with which we make suggestions to authority: 

# '''Command''' – "Strategy X is going to be implemented" 
# '''Team Obligation Statement'''  – "We need to try strategy X" 
# '''Team Suggestion''' – "Why don't we try strategy X?" 
# '''Query''' – "Do you think strategy X would help us in this situation?" 
# '''Preference''' – "Perhaps we should take a look at one of these Y alternatives" 
# '''Hint''' – "I wonder if we could run into any roadblocks on our current course" 

Gladwell brings up the concept in the context of how crews relate to each other in the cockpit of a commercial airliner, graphically illustrating the degree to which mitigated speech can be detrimental in high-risk situations which require clear communication.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32797">A '''national sport''' is considered to be an intrinsic part of the culture of a [[nation]]. Some sports are ''[[de facto]]'' (not established by law) national sports, as [[baseball]] is in the [[United States]] and [[Gaelic games]] are in the [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], while others  are  ''[[de jure]]'' (established by law) national sports, as [[lacrosse]] and [[ice hockey]] are in [[Canada]]. These sports do not have to be necessarily the most played or most followed, which would be either [[association football]] or [[cricket]] in all but a few countries are widely considered to be important to the significant for its culture.

The '''Nimboran''' languages are a small independent [[language family|family]] of [[Papuan languages]] in the classification of [[Malcolm Ross (linguist)|Malcolm Ross]], that had been part of [[Stephen Wurm]]'s [[Trans–New Guinea languages|Trans–New Guinea]] proposal. However, when proto-Nimboran pronouns are reconstructed ''(*genam'' "I" and ''kom'' or ''komot'' "thou"), they have little resemblance to the proto-TNG pronouns ''*na'' and ''*ga.'' Usher places them in a [[North Papuan languages|North Papuan]] stock that resembles Cowan's proposal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/newguineaworld/families/north-new-guinea/west-north-new-guinea/grime-river]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
* '''Nimboran''' family: [[Kemtuik language|Kemtuik]]–[[Gresi language|Gresi]], [[Mlap language|Mlap]], [[Mekwei language|Mekwei]], [[Nimboran language|Nimboran]]

==Pronouns==
The pronouns Ross reconstructs for proto-Nimboran are,

[[File:Norvegia phonetic alphabet.svg|thumb]]
'''Norvegia''' ([[Latin]] for ''[[Norway]]'') is a [[phonetic]] [[transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] system which was developed by Norwegian [[linguist]] [[Johan Storm]] in 1884. Norvegia is still employed in the teaching of [[Scandinavian studies]] at Norwegian universities.

}}

'''Olmec alternative origin speculations''' are pseudohistorical theories that have been suggested for the formation of [[Olmec]] civilization which contradict generally accepted scholarly consensus.  These origin theories typically involve contact with [[Old World]] societies.  Although these speculations have become somewhat well-known within [[popular culture]], particularly the idea of an African connection to the Olmec, they are not regarded as credible by mainstream researchers of [[Mesoamerica]] and are considered [[Fringe theory|fringe theories]].

==Mainstream scientific consensus==
The great majority of scholars who specialize in Mesoamerican history, archaeology and linguistics remain unconvinced by alternative origin speculations.&lt;ref&gt;See Grove (1976) or Ortiz de Montellano (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Many are more critical and regard the promotion of such unfounded theories as a form of ethnocentric [[racism]] at the expense of [[indigenous Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.hallofmaat.com/modules.php?name=Articles&amp;file=article&amp;sid=73 Robbing Native American Cultures: Van Sertima's Afrocentricity and the Olmecs] an article from ''Current Anthropology''.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[scientific consensus|consensus]] view maintained across publications in peer-reviewed academic journals that are concerned with Mesoamerican and other pre-Columbian research is that the Olmec and their achievements arose from influences and traditions that were wholly indigenous to the region, or at least the New World, and there is no reliable material evidence to suggest otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Taube, p. 17.  "There simply is no material evidence of any Pre-Hispanic contact between the Old World and Mesoamerica before the arrival of the Spanish in the sixteenth century."&lt;/ref&gt;  They, and their neighbouring cultures with whom they had contact, developed their own characters which were founded entirely on a remarkably interlinked and ancient cultural and agricultural heritage that was locally shared, but [[cradle of civilization|arose independently]] of any extra-hemispheric influences.&lt;ref&gt;Diehl (2004); Coe (1968).&lt;/ref&gt;

==African origins==
[[File:20041229-Olmec Head (Museo Nacional de Antropología).jpg|right|thumb|[[San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán]] Colossal Head 6, a 3-meter-high Olmec sculpture with lips and nose said to resemble African facial features.]]
Some writers claim that the Olmecs were related to peoples of Africa-based primarily on their interpretation of facial features of Olmec statues. They additionally contend that epigraphical, genetic, and osteological evidence supports their claims. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}
The idea was first suggested by José Melgar, who discovered the first [[Olmec colossal heads|colossal head]] at Hueyapan (now [[Tres Zapotes]]) in 1862 and subsequently published two papers that attributed this head to a "Negro race."&lt;ref&gt;Stirling, p. 2, who cites Melgar (1869) and Melgar (1871).&lt;/ref&gt; The view was espoused in the early 20th century by [[Leo Wiener]] and others.&lt;ref name="Ortizde"&gt;Ortíz de Montellano, Bernard &amp; Gabriel Haslip Viera &amp; Warren Barbour 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern proponents such as [[Ivan Van Sertima]] and Clyde Ahmad Winters have identified the Olmecs with the [[Mandé]] people of West Africa.&lt;ref name="Ortizde" /&gt;

===Claims of epigraphic evidence===
Some researchers claim that the [[Mesoamerican writing systems]] are related to African scripts. In the early 19th century, [[Constantine Samuel Rafinesque]] proposed that the Maya inscriptions were probably related to the [[Libyco-Berber]] writing of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Rafinesque, "First letter to Mr. Champollion on the Graphic systems of Otolum or Palenque in Central America", in ''The Decipherment of Ancient Maya Writing'', Houston, S. et al., Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press (2001), (pp. 45-47); and C. S. Rafinesque, "Second letter to Mr. Champollion--Elements of the Glyphs", ibid., pp. 48-53.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leo Wiener]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Leo Wiener]], ''Africa and the Discovery of America'', Volume 3, Philadelphia, PA: Innes &amp; Sons (1922) p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt; and others claim that various Olmec and [[Epi-Olmec script|Epi-Olmec]] symbols are similar to those found in the [[Vai script]] (a relatively modern script in Liberia which may have Cherokee influence&lt;ref name="Konrad Tuchscherer and P.E.H. Hair"&gt;{{cite book |last= Tuchscherer |first= Konrad |title= Cherokee and West Africa: Examining the Origins of the Vai Script |year= 2002 |publisher= History in Africa, 29 |jstor= 3172173 |pages= 427–486}}&lt;/ref&gt;), in particular, the symbols on the [[Tuxtla Statuette]], [[Teo Mask]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} [[Cascajal Block]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} and the celts in [[La Venta#Offering 4|Offering 4 at La Venta]].

These assertions have found no support among Mesoamerican researchers. While mainstream scholars have made significant progress translating the Maya script, researchers have yet to translate Olmec glyphs.

===Genetic studies===
{{See also|Genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas}}
Genetic and immunological studies over the past two decades have failed to yield evidence of precolumbian African contributions to the indigenous populations of the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;Coop, Graham, et al. (5 June 2009).  [http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000500 "The Role of Geography in Human Adaptation."]  ''PLoS Genetics'' 5, no. 6.

===Claims of osteological evidence===
Andrzej Wiercinski claims that some of the Olmecs were of African origin.&lt;ref&gt;Rensberger, B. (September, 1988). "Black kings of ancient America", Science Digest, 74-77 and 122.  See also Wiercinski, A. (1972a) "An anthropological study on the origin of 'Olmecs'", Swiatowit, 33, p. 143-174.&lt;/ref&gt; He supports this claim with [[Human cranium|cranial]] evidence from two Mesoamerican sites: [[Tlatilco]] and [[Cerro de las Mesas]]. Tlatilco is a site in the [[Valley of Mexico]].  Although outside the [[Olmec heartland]], Olmec influences appear in the architectural record.  The crania were from the Pre-Classic period, contemporary with the Olmec. Cerro de las Mesa is within the Olmec heartland, although according to Wiercinski, "the series . . . is dated on the Classic period."&lt;ref&gt;Wiercinski (1972b).&lt;/ref&gt;  The Classic period is generally defined to start around AD 250, or 600 years after the end of the Olmec culture.

To determine the racial heritage of the skeletons, Wiercinski used classic diagnostic traits, determined by [[Craniometry|craniometric and cranioscopic]] methods, as well as the Polish Comparative-Morphological School skeletal reference collection.  These measurements were then compared against three crania sets from Poland, Mongolia and Uganda to represent three racial categories which allowed Wiercinski to sort each skull into one or more racial categories.

Based on his comparisons, Wiercinski found that 14% of the skeletons from Tlatilco and 4.5% of the skeletons from Cerro de las Mesas had elements of "Black" racial composition.

In the last section of his paper, Wiercinski compared the physiognomy of the skeletons to corresponding examples of Olmec sculptures and bas-reliefs on the [[stela]]s. For example, Wiercinski states that the colossal Olmec heads represent the "Dongolan" type.&lt;ref&gt;Wiercinski (1972b), p.160&lt;/ref&gt;  The empirical frequencies of the Dongolan type at Tlatilco calculated by Wiercinski was 0.231, more than twice as high as Wiercinski's theoretical figure of 0.101, for the presence of Dongolans at Tlatilco.

Wiercinski summarizes his research by offering the following "ethnogenetical hypotheses":&lt;ref&gt;Wiercinski, p. 158 or p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

* The indigenous rootstock of Tlatilco and Cerro de las Mesas consists of "Ainoid, Arctic, and Pacific racial elements".
* "A next migratory wave" brought in additional Pacific as well as "Laponoid" elements.
* "Some Chinese influence of Shang Period could penetrate Mesoamerica"
* "A strange transatlantic, more or less sporadic migration" brought [[Armenoid]], Equatorial, and [[Bushmen]]oid elements.

Wiercinski's research methods and conclusions are not accepted by the vast majority of Mesoamerican scholars, in part because of his reliance on the Polish Comparative-Morphological methodology which limits the placement of skull types within a very narrow spectrum that is often within Caucasian, Negroid, and Mongoloid. Native Americans are thus made to fit within these groups which often yields false and contradictory assumptions as a result of sample bias.

An interdisciplinary analysis of Native American skulls has shown that there is no real evidence, apart from superficial misjudgments and erroneous conclusions, that Native Americans have any link to an African presence in America before the European encounter.&lt;ref&gt;Rolando González-José et al.  [https://www.icb.ufmg.br/lbem/pdf/gonzalez2008ajpa-americapeopling.pdf "The Peopling of America: Craniofacial Shape Variation on a Continental Scale and Its Interpretation from an Interdisciplinary View."]  &lt;small&gt;[PDF file]&lt;/small&gt;.  ''American Journal of Physical Anthropology'' 137, no. 2 (2008): 175-187.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Olmeken - Menschenkopf 1.jpg|thumb|right|Head of an [[Olmec figurine|Olmec baby figurine]]. Gordon Ekholm, who was an archaeologist and curator at the [[American Museum of Natural History]], suggested that the Olmec art style might have originated in [[Bronze Age]] China.&lt;ref&gt;Pool, p. 92, who cites Gordon Ekholm (1964) "Transpacific Contacts" in ''Prehistoric Man in the New World'' JD Jennings and E. Norbeck, eds., Chicago: University of Chicago, pp. 489—510.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Chinese origins==
Some researchers have argued that the Olmec civilization came into existence with the help of [[China|Chinese]] refugees, particularly at the end of the [[Shang dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;This theory is mentioned in the history book [[The Rise of the West: A History of the Human Community]] (1963) by [[William Hardy McNeill|William H. McNeill]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, Betty Meggers of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] argued that the Olmec civilization originated due to Shang Chinese influences around 1200 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Meggers.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1996 book, Mike Xu, with the aid of Chen Hanping, claimed that the very same La Venta [[celt (tool)|celts]] [[Olmec alternative origin speculations#Epigraphic evidence|discussed above]] actually bore Chinese characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Xu |first1=Mike |title=Transpacific Contacts? |url=http://www.chinese.tcu.edu/www_chinese3_tcu_edu.htm |accessdate=15 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010802024552/http://www.chinese.tcu.edu/www_chinese3_tcu_edu.htm |archivedate=August 2, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Xu|first1=Mike|title=The Origin|date=1996|publisher=University of Central Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0964869424|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These claims are unsupported by mainstream Mesoamerican researchers.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Grove (1976).&lt;/ref&gt;  The evidence relied on by Mike Xu,  including the coincidence of markings on Olmec pottery with those on Chinese oracle bone writings,  the significance of jade in both cultures and the shared knowledge of the position of true North,  was discussed in an article by Claire Liu in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taiwan-panorama.com/en/show_issue.php?id=199758605006E.TXT&amp;table=2&amp;h1=History%20and%20Civilization&amp;h2=Ancient%20Civilization 台灣光華雜誌] ''Taiwan-Panorama.com''.  Retrieved 8 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jaredite origins==
{{See also|Archaeology and the Book of Mormon}}
In the [[Book of Mormon]], a text regarded as [[scripture]] by churches and members of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], the [[Jaredite]]s are described as a people who left the Old World in ancient times and founded a civilization in the Americas. Mainstream American History and Literature specialists{{who|date=October 2014}} place the literary setting for the Book of Mormon among the “[[mound builder (people)|Mound-builders]]” of North America. The work is therefore classified in the American “Mound-builder” genre of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Roger G. Kennedy, ''Hidden Cities:  The Discovery and Loss of Ancient North American Civilization'', 1994, pp. 228-231; Robert Silverberg, “and the mound-builders vanished from the earth”,''American Heritage Magazine'', June 1969, Volume 20, Issue 4&lt;/ref&gt;  LDS scholars and authors seek to demonstrate that events described in the Book of Mormon have a literal foundation. A popular [[Limited geography model (Book of Mormon)|Book of Mormon geography model]] places the scene of the Jaredite arrival and subsequent development, in lands around the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]] in Mesoamerica.&lt;ref&gt;Southerton (2004, p.157)&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition leading to this Central American model, however, does not clearly originate with the Book of Mormon (first published in 1830) but with enthusiastic interest in [[John Lloyd Stephens]]’ 1841 bestseller, ''Incidents of travel in Central America, Chiapas and Yucatan''.&lt;ref&gt;Coon, W. Vincent, ''Choice Above All Other Lands – Book of Mormon Covenant Lands According to the Best Sources'', Ch. 4, “Unsigned Articles and a Popular Book”, pp. 64-104&lt;/ref&gt; LDS founder [[Joseph Smith Jr.]] placed the arrival of the Jaredites in “the lake country of America” (region of [[Lake Ontario]]){{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}, allowing for the eventual migration of Book of Mormon peoples to Mexico and Central America.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Smith (editor), “Traits of the Mosaic History Found Among the Aztaeca Nations”, ''Times and Seasons'', June 15, 1842, Vol. 3, No. 16, pp 818-820; signed with Joseph Smith’s “ED”. Joseph Smith comments on a chapter from Josiah Priest’s ''American Antiquities and Discoveries in the West''. Coon notes that Joseph Smith uses precisely the same description as Priest, Humboldt and others in describing the Great Lakes region as “the lake country”. See, “Lake”, [http://www.bookofmormonpromisedland.com/Mound%20Builder%20America.htm The Book of Mormon &amp; “Mound-Builder” America]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some LDS scholars identify the Olmec civilization with the Jaredites, citing similarities and noting that the period in which the Olmecs flourished and later declined corresponds roughly with the Jaredite civilization timeline, although most disagree with this idea.

==Nordic origins==
[[File:La Venta Stela 3 detail.png|thumb|upright|Detail of the carved portrait nicknamed "Uncle Sam" by researchers]]

According to [[Michael Coe]], explorer and cultural diffusionist [[Thor Heyerdahl]] claimed that at least some of the Olmec leadership had Nordic ancestry, a view at least partly inspired by the bearded figure, often referred to as "Uncle Sam",&lt;ref&gt;see Coe (1968, p.59)&lt;/ref&gt; carved into La Venta Stela 3, whose apparent [[aquiline nose]] has been cited as possible evidence for ancient visitors to the Americas from the Old World:&lt;blockquote&gt;"The presence of Uncle Sam inspired Thor Heyerdahl, the Norwegian explorer and author of ''Kon Tiki,'' among others to claim a Nordic ancestry for at least some of the Olmec leadership... [However], it is extremely misleading to use the testimony of artistic representations to prove ethnic theories. The Olmec were American Indians, not Negroes (as Melgar had thought) or Nordic supermen."&lt;ref&gt;Coe. p.  55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In popular culture==
The Olmec Football Player [http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?918043] is a 1980 short story by Katherine MacLean. In it, at least one of the Olmec colossal heads depicts an African-American college student who traveled back in time while wearing his football helmet.

'''Panethnicity''' is a political [[neologism]] used to group various [[ethnic groups]] together based on their related cultural origins; geographic, linguistic, religious, or 'racial' similarities are often used alone or in combination to draw panethnic boundaries. 
The term panethnic was used extensively during mid-twentieth century anti-colonial/national liberation movements.  In the United States, [[Yen Espiritu]] popularized the term and coined the nominal term panethnicity in reference to [[Asian Americans]], a racial category composed of disparate ethnic groups having in common only their origin in [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;''Asian American Panethnicity: Bridging Institutions and Identities''; reference for Espiritu as originator of the term:  ''[[Asian Pacific American Law Journal]]'' vol. 2 (1994), p. 43
"I use the term "pan-racialization" as the general equivalent of Professor Espiritu's term 'pan-ethnicity.' Espiritu uses Asian American 'pan-ethnicity' to describe an over-arching Asian American ethnic identity constructed in the 1960s"
&lt;/ref&gt; 

It has since seen some use as a replacement of [[race in the United States|race]]; for example, the aforementioned [[Asian Americans]] can be described as "a panethnicity" of various unrelated [[peoples of Asia]], which are nevertheless perceived as a distinguishable group within the larger [[multiracial]] North American society.

More recently{{year needed|date=May 2014}} the term has also come to be used in contexts outside multiculturalism in US society, as a general replacement for terms like [[ethnolinguistic group]] or racial group.{{clarify|date=May 2014}}&lt;!-- Careful with this. There is evidence for such use since the 2000s, but it seems to be online use, and may significantly be informed by Wikipedia. This is risking to become another case of Wikipedia turning out to create its own references--&gt;

The concept is to be distinguished from "[[pan-nationalism]]", which similarly groups related ethnicities but in the context of either [[ethnic nationalism]] (e.g. [[Pan-Arabism]], [[Pan-Celticism]], [[Pan-Germanism]], [[Pan-Iranism]], [[Pan-Slavism]], [[Pan-Turkism]]), or [[civic nationalism]] (e.g. [[Pan-Africanism]]).

==United States==
{{main|Race and ethnicity in the United States}}
Panethnicity has allowed for Asian Americans to unite based on similar historical relations with the US, such as US military presence in their native country. The Asian American panethnic identity has evolved to become a means for immigrant groups such as Asian Americans to unite in order to gain political strength in numbers.

Panethnic labels are often, though not always, created and employed by outsiders of the group that is being defined panethnically. Mainstream institutions and political policies often play a big role in the labeling of panethnic groups. They often enact policies that deal with specific groups of people, and panethnic groups are one way to group large numbers of people. Public policy might dole out resources or make deals with multiple groups, viewing them all as one large entity.&lt;ref name="okamoto"&gt;"Institutional Panethnicity: Boundary Formation in Asian-American Organizing", Dina G. Okamoto{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of "Hispanics/Latinos", their categorization into a panethnicity is applied irrespective of the country of origin (such as [[Mexican people|Mexican]], [[Peruvian]], [[Argentina|Argentine]], [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]], [[Spaniard]], etc.) or the [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] origins ([[White people|white]], [[mestizo]], [[mulatto]], [[Afro-Latino|black]], [[Amerindian]]) of those people grouped into the "Hispanic/Latino" panethnicity.&lt;!-- African American is a subset of the Black or African American census bureau option --&gt; Likewise, disparate populations from [[East Asia]] and [[South Asia]] are often indiscriminately lumped under a broader [[Asian American]] designation.

The '''''Proceedings of the [[USSR Academy of Sciences]]''''' ({{lang-ru|'''Доклады Академии Наук СССР'''}}, '''''Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR''''' ('''''DAN SSSR'''''), {{lang-fr|'''Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences de l'URSS'''}}) was a Soviet journal&lt;ref&gt;ISSN 0002-3264&lt;/ref&gt; that was dedicated to publishing original, academic research papers in physics, mathematics, chemistry, geology, and biology. It was first published in 1933 and ended in 1992 with volume 322, issue 3.

Today, it is continued by '''''Doklady Akademii Nauk''''' ({{lang-ru|'''Доклады Академии Наук'''}}),&lt;ref&gt;[http://pleiades.online/en/journal/dan/ Doklady Akademii Nauk] homepage (ISSN 0869-5652)&lt;/ref&gt; which began publication in 1992. The journal is also known as the ''Proceedings of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] (RAS)''.

''Doklady'' has had a complicated publication and translation history. A number of translation journals exist which publish selected articles from the original by subject section; these are listed below.

==History==
The [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] dates from 1724, with a continuous series of variously named publications dating from 1726.&lt;ref&gt;Scholarly Societies Project.  Российская Академия Наук [Rossijskaâ Akademiâ Nauk]. (Russian Academy of Sciences).	http://www.scholarly-societies.org/history/1724ian.html&lt;/ref&gt;

''Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR-Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences de l'URSS, Seriya A'' first appeared in 1925 publishing original, academic research papers in the sciences, mathematics and technology in Russian or very occasionally in English, French or German.

''Novaia Seriya'' replaced ''Seriya A'' in 1933, with articles published in Russian and immediately followed by a translation into English, French, or German.

In 1935, with v.3(8), ''Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences de l'URSS'' was split off as a separate journal that continued publishing corresponding Doklady translations&lt;ref&gt;For instance, Underground Gasification of Coal by the Percolation Method
Chukhanov, Z. F. Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences de l'URSS 1947. Volume LVI, No. 1, 45-48.; 
Подземная Газификация методом фильтрации Чуханов, З. Ф.  Доклады Академии Наук СССР 1947. Tom LVI, No 1, 43-46.
&lt;/ref&gt; 
until 1947, when it ceased publication.  The change in volume numbering with 1935, v.3(8) virtually renumbered: 1933; 1934, v.1-4; and 1935, v.1-2, to: v. 1, 1933; v.2-5, 1934; and v.6-7, 1935.

''Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR'' continued publication until 1992, when it changed title to ''Doklady Akademii Nauk''.&lt;ref&gt;Chemical Abstracts Service Source Index. 1907-1999 Cumulative. v.1, lists:
* Doklady Rossijskoj Akademii Nauk. Seriya A, 1922-1925 (0366-9602)
* Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR. Seriya A, 1925-1933 (0366-8630).  
* Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR,1933-1992 (0002-3264)
* Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences de l'URSS, 1935-1947 (0366-788X)
* Doklady Akademii Nauk, 1992+ (0869-5652)&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
Some ''Comptes Rendus (Doklady)...'' articles also appear to have been published in European journals, and  [[Reaxys]]/[[Beilstein database|Beilstein]] and [[Chemische Berichte|Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft]] (Chemische Berichte), [[Web of Science]], [[Chemical Abstracts]] (SciFinder) and "Doklady" all use different transliteration schemes.&lt;ref&gt;For instance: 
* On the Alkaloids of the Leaves of Jaborandi. VI. Synthesis of Racem-Homopilopic Acid Preobrazenskij, N. A.; Poliakova, A. M.; Preobrazenskij, V. A. Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences de l'URSS 1935. Volume III(VIII), no 4 (64), 165-168.
* ОБ АЛКАЛОИДАХ ЛИСТЬЕВ JABORANDI. VI. СИНТЕЗ RACEM-ГОМОПИЛОПОВОЙ КИСЛОТЫ, Преображенский Н.А., Полякова, А. М.; Преображенский, В. А., Доклады Академии Наук СССР, 1935. Tom III(VIII), No 4, 165-168.
* Über die Alkaloide der Jaborandi-Blätter. VI. … Die Synthese der racem. Homo-pilopsäure, N. A. Preobrashenski, A. M. Poljakowa and W. A. Preobrashenski, Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft  (1935), 68(5), 844-7.
* (SciFinder) Alkaloids of jaborandi leaves. VI. Synthesis of dl-homopilopic acid, Preobrazhenskii, N. A.; Polyakova, A. M.; Preobrazhenskii, V. A., Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft (1935), 68B, 844-7.
* (Web of Science) On the alkaloids of the leaves of jaborandi VI, Preobrazenskij, NA; Poliakova, AM; Preobrazenskij, VA, Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences de l'URSS  Volume: 8   Pages: 165-168   Published: JUL-SEP 1935
* (Reaxys/Beilstein), Preobrashenski et al., Chemische Berichte,   Volume 68, Publication Year 1935, Pages 844
&lt;/ref&gt; 
An excellent review of the multiplicity of national/international transliteration schemes is given by Hoseh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|title=Pitfalls of Transliteration in Indexing and Searching|author=M. Hoseh|journal=Literature Resources for Chemical Process Industries. Advances in Chemistry|volume=10|pages=541–547|year=1954|url=http://pubs.acs.org/isbn/9780841200111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indexing problems===
{{OR section|date=October 2014}}
SciFinder incorrectly assigned ''Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR, Seriya A'' to articles published between 1933-1935, v.2 in ''Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR'' and to articles published between 1935, v.3(8)  to v.56(2), 1947 in ''Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences de l'URSS''.  The print Chemical Abstracts provides the correct journal title.  Scifinder records for articles published in 1935, v.3(8), 1935 are inconsistently shown as either v.3 or v.8.  SciFinder records also do not consistently provide both the Russian and English, French or German pagination for the 1933-1935, v.2 articles.  
 
Web of Science adds a further complication by incorrectly omitting (Doklady) from the journal title,&lt;ref&gt;For example, see these comparison records: 
;SciFinder 
* Title: Permutation degeneration in vector models of atoms; Author: Markov, M.; Source:  Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR, Seriya A (1935), 8, 103-4.
* Title: Absorption spectrum of lead vapor in the Schumann region; Author:  Kremenevskii, N. V.; Source:  Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR, Seriya A (1935), 3, 251-2.
;Web of Science
* Title: Permutation degeneration in the vector models of atoms; Author(s): Markov, M; Source: Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences de l'URSS  Vol: 8   	Pages: 103-104   Published: JUL-SEP 1935
* Title: The absorption spectrum of lead vapour in Schumann's region; Author(s): Kremenevskij, NV; Source: Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences de l'URSS  Vol: 8   	Pages: 251-252   Published: JUL-SEP 1935
; INSPEC
* Title: Permutation degeneracy in the vector model of the atom; Author(s): Markov, M.; Source: Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences de l'URSS  Volume: 3 Issue: 3   Pages: 103-104   Published: 1935
* Title: Absorption spectrum of lead vapour in the Schumann region; Author(s): Kremenevskij, N.V.; Source: Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences de l'URSS  Volume: 3 Issue: 6   Pages: 251-252   Published: 1935&lt;/ref&gt; 
while Reaxys/Beilstein incorrectly gives Chemische Berichte as the journal title for articles appearing in Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft.

Records in SciFinder and [[INSPEC]] for articles published in 1933; 1934, v.1-4; and 1935, v.1-2, are shown in Web of Science as v.1, 1933 – v.7, 1935, because the Web of Science records were indexed for the Century of Science&lt;ref&gt;Century of Science.  http://wokinfo.com/products_tools/backfiles/cos/&lt;/ref&gt; from library volumes that had been subsequently renumbered by the cooperating library.

==Translations==
English translations of "Doklady" articles began again in 1956, when the American Institute of Physics began publishing ''Soviet Physics - Doklady''.  Other publications soon followed and within a few years most Doklady subject sections were available in English translation.

Doklady translation journals are as of 2013 published by Pleiades Publishing, Ltd and distributed online by [[Springer Science+Business Media]].  The online translation journals now only publish "selected" articles from the original Russian language journal, which is also available online from 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Doklady Akademii Nauk (0869-5652). {{cite web |url=http://www.maik.ru/cgi-perl/journal.pl?name=dan&amp;lang=eng |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205185230/http://maik.ru/cgi-perl/journal.pl?name=dan&amp;lang=eng |archivedate=2015-02-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Determining the appropriate English translation journal for articles published in ‘Doklady’ is often problematic.

One approach is to check the Russian Doklady issue contents page to identify the subject section and then determine in which translation journal the article was published.  The translation journal’s contents pages will provide a concordance linking the ‘Doklady’ page numbers with the ‘translation journal’ page numbers.

Another approach is to search SciFinder for the original article, which may show the Doklady subject section,&lt;ref&gt;Oxidation of carbon monoxide in acetic acid; Moiseev, I. I.; Vargaftik, M. N.; Gentosh, O. I.; et al.; Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR (1977), 237(3), 645-7 [Phys. Chem.].; Language: Russian, Database: CAPLUS&lt;/ref&gt; since Chemical Abstracts only indexed the original Russian language articles until 1995.&lt;ref&gt;"This was a policy based on timeliness (the translations appeared months after the originals) and completeness (the translations were not always complete, and contained unexplained gaps: letters, short communications and editorial matter were often not translated). After 1995 CAS began to index selected translation titles instead." http://202.127.145.151/siocl/Chemistry%20Library/journals.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Translation journal titles and their Doklady subject sections===
Several journals of translations exist, each containing articles that pertain to a particular subject.&lt;ref&gt;A listing of each journal’s current subject coverage is given at: http://www.maik.rssi.ru/cgi-perl/journals.cgi?lang=eng&amp;action=alphabet.

The '''Rob Roy Way''' is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[long distance footpath]] that runs from [[Drymen]] in [[Stirling (council area)|Stirling]] to [[Pitlochry]] in [[Perth and Kinross]]. The path was created in 2002,{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} and takes its name from [[Robert Roy MacGregor|Rob Roy MacGregor]], a Scottish [[folk hero]] and [[outlaw]] of the early 18th century. It traverses countryside that he knew and travelled frequently.&lt;ref name=ws/&gt; The route crosses the [[Highland Boundary Fault]], a [[Fault (geology)|geological fault]] where the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] meet the [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowlands]]. Views from the trail overlook [[Loch Lubnaig]], [[Loch Earn]], [[Loch Venachar]] and [[Loch Tay]].&lt;ref name=ws&gt;{{cite web | title = The Rob Roy Way | url = http://walking.visitscotland.com/walks/lomondtrossachs/213673 | work = Walking Scotland | publisher = VisitScotland | accessdate = 2009-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The way is {{convert|127|km|mi}} in length if the direct route along the southern shore of Loch Tay and the River Tay is followed between [[Ardtalnaig]] and [[Aberfeldy, Scotland|Aberfeldy]]. A optional loop also link these places via [[Amulree]]: choosing this option increases the length by a further {{convert|27|km|mi}} to {{convert|154|km|mi}}.&lt;ref name=sgt-rrw/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.robroyway.com/walk.html|title=The Walking Route|publisher=SCSupport Ltd.|accessdate=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Rob Roy Way was designated as one of [[Scotland's Great Trails]] by [[Scottish Natural Heritage]] in spring 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robroyway.com/news.html#chapter22|title=Walking News - Scotland's Great Trails|publisher=SCSupport Ltd.|accessdate=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also links to two further Great Trails, meeting the [[Great Trossachs Path]] near [[Callander]], and the [[West Highland Way]] just north of [[Drymen]].&lt;ref name=sgt-rrw/&gt;&lt;ref name=sheet57&gt;[[Ordnance Survey]] Landranger 1:50000.

[[File:Rome-Pantheon-Interieur1.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in [[Rome]] is an example of Roman concrete construction.]]

'''Roman concrete''', also called '''opus caementicium''', was a material used in construction during the late [[Roman Republic]] until the fading of the [[Roman Empire]]. Roman [[concrete]] was based on a [[hydraulic cement|hydraulic-setting cement]].  Recently, it has been found that it materially differs in several ways from modern concrete which is based on [[Portland cement]].  Roman concrete is durable due to its incorporation of [[volcanic ash]], which prevents cracks from spreading. By the middle of the 1st century, the material was used frequently, often brick-faced, although variations in aggregate allowed different arrangements of materials. Further innovative developments in the material, called the [[Concrete Revolution]], contributed to structurally complicated forms, such as the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] dome, the world's largest and oldest unreinforced concrete dome.&lt;ref name="Ancient Roman Concrete"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.romanconcrete.com/docs/spillway/spillway.htm | title=The Riddle of Ancient Roman Concrete | publisher=www.romanconcrete.com | work=S Dept. of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Upper Colorado Region | date=February 1993 | accessdate=20 May 2013 | author=Moore, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman concrete was normally faced with stone or brick, and interiors might be further decorated by [[stucco]], [[fresco]] paintings, or thin slabs of fancy colored marbles. Made up of aggregate and cement, like modern concrete, it differed in that the aggregate pieces were typically far larger than in modern concrete, often amounting to rubble, and as a result it was laid rather than poured.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, Martin (ed), ''A Handbook of Roman Art'', p. 30, Phaidon, 1983, {{ISBN|0714822140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Roman concretes were able to be set underwater, which was useful for bridges and other waterside construction.

It is uncertain when Roman concrete was developed, but it was clearly in widespread and customary use from about 150 BC; some scholars believe it was developed a century before that.&lt;ref&gt;[[Axel Boëthius|Boëthius, Axel]], [[Roger Ling|Ling, Roger]], [[Tom Rasmussen|Rasmussen, Tom]], ''Etruscan and Early Roman Architecture'', pp. 128-129, Yale/Pelican history of art, 1978, Yale University Press, {{ISBN|0300052901}}, 9780300052909, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1nZswjfqROUC&amp;printsec=frontcover Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic references==
[[File:Caesarea Concrete Bath.jpg|thumbnail|[[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]] is the earliest known example to have used underwater Roman concrete technology on such a large scale.]][[Vitruvius]], writing around 25 BC in his [[De architectura|''Ten Books on Architecture'']], distinguished types of aggregate appropriate for the preparation of [[lime mortar]]s. For [[structural mortar]]s, he recommended [[pozzolana]] (''pulvis puteolanus'' in Latin), the volcanic sand from the beds of [[Pozzuoli]], which are brownish-yellow-gray in color in that area around Naples, and reddish-brown near Rome. Vitruvius specifies a ratio of 1 part lime to 3 parts pozzolana for cement used in buildings and a 1:2 ratio of lime to pozzolana for underwater work, essentially the same ratio mixed today for concrete used in marine locations.&lt;ref&gt;Heather Lechtman and Linn Hobbs "Roman Concrete and the Roman Architectural Revolution", ''Ceramics and Civilization Volume 3: High Technology Ceramics: Past, Present, Future'', edited by W.D. Kingery and published by the American Ceramics Society, 1986; and Vitruvius, Book II:v,1; Book V:xii2&lt;/ref&gt;

By the middle of the first century, the principles of underwater construction in concrete were well known to Roman builders. The city of [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]] was the earliest known example to have made use of underwater Roman concrete technology on such a large scale.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Lechtman and Hobbs "Roman Concrete and the Roman Architectural Revolution"&lt;/ref&gt;

For rebuilding Rome after the [[Great Fire of Rome|fire in 64 AD]], which destroyed large portions of the city, [[Nero]]'s new building code largely called for brick-faced concrete. This appears to have encouraged the development of the brick and concrete industries.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==Material properties==

Roman concrete, like any [[concrete]], consists of an [[construction aggregate|aggregate]] and hydraulic [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] – a binder mixed with water that hardens over time. The aggregate varied, and included pieces of rock, [[ceramic]] tile, and brick rubble from the remains of previously demolished buildings.

[[Gypsum]] and [[calcium oxide|quicklime]] were used as binders. Volcanic dusts, called [[pozzolana]] or "pit sand", were favored where they could be obtained. Pozzolana makes the concrete more resistant to salt water than modern-day concrete.&lt;ref&gt;Wayman, Erin. “The Secrets of Ancient Rome’s Buildings.” Smithsonian.com. 16 November 2011. Retrieved 24 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The pozzolanic mortar used had a high content of [[alumina]] and [[silica]]. [[Tuff]] was often used as an aggregate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05xxl4t|title=Rome's Invisible City - BBC One|website=BBC|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concrete, and in particular, the hydraulic mortar responsible for its cohesion, was a type of structural ceramic whose utility derived largely from its [[Rheology|rheological plasticity]] in the paste state. The setting and hardening of hydraulic cements derived from hydration of materials and the subsequent chemical and physical interaction of these hydration products. This differed from the setting of [[lime mortar|slaked lime mortars]], the most common cements of the pre-Roman world. Once set, Roman concrete exhibited little plasticity, although it retained some resistance to tensile stresses.

The setting of [[geopolymer|pozzolanic cements]] has much in common with setting of their modern counterpart, [[Portland cement]]. The high silica composition of Roman pozzolana cements is very close to that of modern cement to which blast furnace [[slag]], [[fly ash]], or [[silica fume]] have been added.  

The strength and longevity of Roman ''marine'' concrete is understood to benefit from a reaction of [[seawater]] with a mixture of [[volcanic ash]] and quicklime to create a rare crystal called [[tobermorite]], which may resist fracturing. As seawater percolated within the tiny cracks in the Roman concrete, it reacted with [[phillipsite]] naturally found in the volcanic rock and created [[Aluminium|aluminous]] tobermorite crystals. The result is a candidate for "the most durable building material in human history". In contrast, modern concrete exposed to saltwater deteriorates within decades.&lt;ref name="WashPost2017"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Guarino |first1=Ben |title=Ancient Romans made world's 'most durable' concrete.

[[File:Torbermorite_CSH_3D_Crystal_Structure_RasMol.gif|thumb|Crystal structure of tobermorite: elementary unit cell]] 

Compressive strengths for modern Portland cements are typically at the 50 MPa level and have improved almost ten-fold since 1860.&lt;ref&gt;N. B. Eden and J. E. Bailey, "Mechanical Properties and Tensile Failure Mechanism of a High Strength Polymer Modified Portland Cement", ''J. Mater. Sci.'', 19, 2677–2685 (1984); and Lechtman and Hobbs, "Roman Concrete and the Roman Architectural Revolution"&lt;/ref&gt; There are no comparable mechanical data for ancient mortars, although some information about tensile strength may be inferred from the cracking of Roman concrete domes. These tensile strengths vary substantially from the water/cement ratio used in the initial mix. At present, there is no way of ascertaining what water/cement ratios the Romans used, nor are there extensive data for the effects of this ratio on the strengths of pozzolanic cements.&lt;ref&gt;Lechtman and Hobbs, "Roman Concrete and the Roman Architectural Revolution"; see also: C. A. Langton and D. M. Roy, "Longevity of Borehole and Shaft Sealing Materials: Characterization of Ancient Cement Based Building Materials", ''Mat. Res. Soc. SYmp. Proc.'' 26, 543–549 (1984); and Topical Report ONWI-202, Battelle Memorial Institute, Office of Nuclear Waste Isolation, Distribution Category UC-70, National Technical Information Service, U.S. Department of Commerce (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seismic technology==
For an environment as prone to [[earthquake]]s as the [[Italian peninsula]], interruptions and internal constructions within walls and domes created discontinuities in the concrete mass. Portions of the building could then shift slightly when there was movement of the earth to accommodate such stresses, enhancing the overall strength of the structure. It was in this sense that bricks and concrete were flexible. It may have been precisely for this reason that, although many buildings sustained serious cracking from a variety of causes, they continue to stand to this day.&lt;ref&gt;W. L. MacDonald, The Architecture of the Roman Empire, rev. ed. Yale University Press, New Haven, 1982, fig. 131B; Lechtman and Hobbs "Roman Concrete and the Roman Architectural Revolution"&lt;/ref&gt;

Another technology used to improve the [[strength of materials|strength]] and stability of concrete was its gradation in domes. One example is the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], where the aggregate of the upper dome region consists of alternating layers of light [[tuff]] and [[pumice]], giving the concrete a density of 1,350&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The foundation of the structure used [[travertine]] as an aggregate, having a much higher density of 2,200&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;K. de Fine Licht, The Rotunda in Rome: A Study of Hadrian's Pantheon. Jutland Archaeological Society, Copenhagen, 1968, pp. 89–94, 134–35; and Lechtman and Hobbs "Roman Concrete and the Roman Architectural Revolution"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern use==
Recent scientific breakthroughs examining Roman concrete have been gathering media and industry attention.&lt;ref&gt;Sezen Soyer-Uzun, Sejung Rosie Chae, Chris J. Benmore, Hans-Rudolf Wenk, Paulo J. M. Monteiro, "Compositional Evolution of Calcium Silicate Hydrate (C-S-H) Structures by Total X-Ray Scattering", Journal of the American Ceramic Society, Volume: 95 Issue: 2 Pages: 793-798, February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trebcap.com/fixing-canadas-infrastructure-with-volcanoes/ |title= Fixing Canada's Infrastructure with Volcanoes |publisher=Trebuchet Capital Partners Research |accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its unusual durability, longevity and lessened environmental footprint, corporations and municipalities are starting to explore the use of Roman-style concrete in North America, substituting the coal [[fly ash]] with volcanic ash that has similar properties. Proponents claim that concrete made with volcanic ash can cost up to 60% less because it requires less cement, and that it has a smaller environmental footprint due to its lower cooking temperature and much longer lifespan.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Compositional Evolution of Calcium Silicate Hydrate (C-S-H) Structures by Total X-Ray Scattering&lt;/ref&gt; Usable examples of Roman concrete exposed to harsh marine environments have been found to be 2000 years old with little or no wear.&lt;ref&gt;M.

The '''Royal Academy of Dance''' ('''RAD''') is a UK-based [[examination board]] specialising in dance education and training, with an emphasis on [[classical ballet]]. The RAD was founded in [[London, England]] in 1920 as the Association of Teachers of Operatic Dancing, and was granted a [[Royal Charter]] in 1935. [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] is patron of the RAD, and [[Darcey Bussell]] was elected to serve as President in 2012, succeeding [[Antoinette Sibley]] who served as [[President]] for 21 years.

The RAD was created with the objective to improve the standard of ballet teaching in the UK and, in pursuit of that goal, a new teaching method and dance technique was devised for the Academy by a group of eminent European dancers. The RAD is one of the largest dance organisations in the world with over 14,000 members in 79 countries,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.rad.org.uk/article.asp?id=30] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201155441/http://www.rad.org.uk/article.asp?id=30|date=1 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; including about 7,500 who hold Registered Teacher Status.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rad.org.uk/article_blue.asp?id=255] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724232648/http://www.rad.org.uk/article_blue.asp?id=255|date=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-ballet.com/techniques.php |title=Ballet Training Techniques |publisher=The-ballet.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently about 1,000 students in full-time or part-time teacher training programmes with the RAD, and each year about 250,000 candidates enter RAD examinations worldwide.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

RAD exams are recognised by the national qualifications regulators of England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, with selected exams also carrying a [[UCAS]] tariff towards university admission.  The RAD is also a validated awarding body of the [[Council for Dance Education and Training]]. The RAD works in partnership with the [[International Dance Teachers' Association]]. Royal Academy of Dance is charity 312826 registered in England and Wales. Royal Academy of Dance Enterprises Ltd is a wholly owned subsidiary of the RAD, which sells Academy branded merchandise, with all profits being gift-aided to the RAD.

==History==
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rad.org.uk/01who/0111chronology.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220120946/http://www.rad.org.uk/01who/0111chronology.htm|date=20 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1920 ===
On 18 July 1920, [[Phillip J. S. Richardson]], then Editor of ''[[Dancing Times]]'' magazine, organised a dinner for eminent dance professionals at the former [[Trocadero (London)|Trocadero Restaurant]] in [[Piccadilly]].  The diners included five special guests, representing the principal methods of ballet training in use at that time.

* [[Phyllis Bedells]] - English Method
* [[Lucia Cormani]] - Italian Method
* [[Edouard Espinosa]] - French Method
* [[Adeline Genée]] - Bournonville Method, Denmark
* [[Tamara Karsavina]] - Imperial Method, Russia

Other guests included [[Ninette de Valois]], the founder of England's [[Royal Ballet]] company, and [[Anton Dolin]], the co-founder of [[English National Ballet]].  The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the poor quality of dance training in Britain at that time and following further meetings, the Association of Teachers of Operatic Dancing of Great Britain was formed, with [[Adeline Genée]] as its first President.  The Association would be the predecessor of the RAD.

=== 1921-1928 ===
In 1921, the Association established headquarters at the offices of ''Dancing Times'' magazine in London and the first Elementary, Intermediate and Advanced level examinations were held in the years that followed, with the first Children's syllabus being published and then examined in 1923 and 1924.  In 1927 a scholarship scheme was introduced for students studying dance with an Association member and in 1928, [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] consented to become Patron of the Association of Teachers of Operatic Dancing.

=== 1930-1934 ===
In November 1930, the first issue of ''Dance Gazette''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rad.org.uk/article.asp?id=249] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111230142613/http://www.rad.org.uk/article.asp?id=249|date=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was published containing a historical review of the Association's first ten years.  'Dance Gazette' is still the official magazine of the RAD, being distributed quarterly to all fully paid members. Since 2011, it is also available to buy in selected branches of WHSmith in the UK. In 1931, the first [[Genée International Ballet Competition]] for female dancers was held in London, with awards for male dancers being introduced later in 1939.  The competition is the RAD's flagship annual event, named after Dame Adeline Genée DBE and now one of the most prestigious dance competitions in the world. The competition was introduced as an additional incentive for candidates who had passed the Solo Seal examination, and has taken place almost every year since 1931, even during the Second World War. In 1934, the [[Royal Opera House]], [[Covent Garden]] agreed to an alliance with the Association and a Grand Council of prestigious men &amp; women was formed to act as a governing body to advise the executive committee.

=== 1935-1937 ===
[[File:RAD Coat of Arms.png|thumb|right|250px|RAD Coat of Arms]]
In 1935 [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] approved the granting of a Royal Charter for the Association of Teachers of Operatic Dancing.  The charter was eventually affixed with his Great Seal in 1936, and the Association of Teachers of Operatic Dancing officially became the 'Royal Academy of Dancing' (RAD).  The following year in 1937, a coat of arms was designed by the [[College of Arms]] in London.

====Coat of Arms====
The RAD coat of arts was granted by the [[College of Arms]] in 1937, designed by the Hon. George Bellew, Somerset Herald of 
Arms and Registrar. The crest at the top of the coat of arms is a figure of [[Terpsichore]], one of the [[Muses]] from Greek mythology, representing dance. The supporter at either side of the shield is a winged doe, symbolising lightness and grace of movement. The [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|Escutcheon]] shows a pentagram symbolising health, with a wavy and zigzag line conveying the movement of dancing. The motto 'Salus et Felicitas’ translates to mean health and happiness.

=== 1950-1954 ===
In 1950, founder President of the RAD [[Adeline Genée]] was appointed a [[Order of the British Empire|Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in the New Year Honours List.  Further honours were awarded to members of the Academy in 1951, with [[Ninette de Valois]] being appointed a Dame, [[Philip Richardson]] being awarded an [[OBE|Order of the British Empire (OBE)]] and [[Margot Fonteyn]] awarded a [[Order of the British Empire|Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE).  Following the death of Queen Mary in 1953, Queen Elizabeth II consented to become the Royal Patron of the Royal Academy of Dancing and Dame Adeline Genée instituted the [[Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Award]] to mark the occasion.  The award is presented annually in recognition of outstanding services to the art of ballet. The first recipient was Dame Ninette de Valois, founder of The Royal Ballet Company. The following is a list of selected recipients of the award.

{{see also|Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Award}}
*[[Phyllis Bedells]], the first recognised English ballerina and a founder member of the RAD

*[[Antoinette Sibley]], former ballet dancer who served as President of the RAD from 1991 to 2012.

Dame [[Adeline Genée]] retired as President of the RAD in 1954 and [[Dame Margot Fonteyn]] was elected as her successor.  The leading Principal dancer of the Royal Ballet at that time and considered the greatest Ballerina of her generation, Fonteyn was later appointed [[Prima Ballerina Assoluta]] of the Royal Ballet by Queen Elizabeth II.

=== 1963-1968 ===
In 1963, the Academy was granted charitable status.  In 1965, the first RAD summer school was held at the [[Elmhurst School for Dance|Elmhurst Ballet School]] in [[Camberley, Surrey]].  Teachers and dancers attended the summer school from the United States, Canada, New Zealand as well as the UK.  In 1968, [[Dame Margot Fonteyn]] devised a new children’s syllabus, which would become the basis for lower graded examinations.

=== 1970-1975 ===
On 23 April 1970, Founder President of the Academy, Dame [[Adeline Genée]] died at the age of 92 and in 1972, the RAD moved into its current headquarters in [[Battersea]] Square, London.  The building was fully refurbished to provide high quality dance facilities and was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1974.  The following year in 1975, the Academy established the Professional Dancer's Teaching Diploma, an intensive course for professional ballet dancers and other dance professionals to gain registered teacher status with the RAD and in 1976, the RAD's teacher training schemes were organised into what is now officially the Faculty of Education of the RAD.

=== 1979 ===
In 1979, a new bursary was founded and named in honour of [[Phyllis Bedells]], a founder member and former vice-president of the RAD.  The bursary of £1,000 is held annually, awarded for further training in the Academy’s method and is awarded to young dancers who are under 17 years of age and have passed RAD Advanced 1 with Distinction but have not entered for the Advanced 2 examination. Past winners have gone on to win medals in very high-profile competitions, such as the [[Genée International Ballet Competition]], and to dance with world-renowned companies including the [[Australian Ballet]], [[Dutch National Ballet]], [[English National Ballet]], [[London City Ballet]], [[Maurice Béjart]] and [[The Royal Ballet]]. Payment of the Bursary can be offset against existing tuition fees where the winner may be studying, or against material / equipment needed for the winner to continue their training.

=== 1983 ===
In 1983, the RAD opened its first International headquarters in Darlinghurst, New South Wales, Australia.  Since that time, the RAD has opened offices worldwide, including Brazil, China, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, United Arab Emirates and the United States of America,

=== 1990-1992 ===
In 1990, a new studio complex was opened at RAD headquarters.  Titled the 'Fonteyn Centre', it was opened by Queen Elizabeth II.  The following year in 1991, [[Dame Margot Fonteyn]] died on the 21 February in Panama City and [[Antoinette Sibley]] was elected as the RAD's third President.  Also in 1991, the 'Graded Examination Syllabus' was introduced, with Grades 6, 7 and 8 being introduced later in 1992.  The three-year teacher training course was also amended in 1992, being replaced by the RAD's first full-time Degree qualification, the BA (Hons) Art &amp; Teaching of Ballet (now the BA in Ballet Education).

=== 1995-1999 ===
The RAD celebrated its 75th Anniversary in 1995, the event being marked by events throughout the world.  In 1996, RAD President [[Antoinette Sibley]] was appointed a Dame in the Queen's New Year Honours List and the Academy's first 12 degree students attended their graduation at Durham Castle.  In 1997, the Benesh Institute&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rad.org.uk/study/Benesh |title=The Benesh Institute &amp; Benesh Movement Notation — RAD |publisher=Rad.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; was incorporated into the RAD and in 1999, The 'Faculty of Education' was established with further teaching qualifications being launched, validated by the University of Durham.

=== 2000 ===
On 20 December 2000, the RAD officially adopted its current title, "Royal Academy of Dance"  and in the same year, qualifications were established for students studying 'Benesh Movement Notation'.

=== 2010 ===
In 2010 the RAD became an Accredited Institute of the [[University of Surrey]].

=== 2011 ===
On 4 January 2011 in London and 17 January in Sydney, the RAD launched its new Intermediate Foundation &amp; Intermediate syllabi. RAD Grades 1-8 and the first five levels of the Vocational Grades were accredited by the [[Ofqual|Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation]] (Ofqual) in England with the RAD as an Awarding Organisation, and the Academy also achieved SQA Accreditation (Scottish Qualifications Authority Accreditation) for RAD exams. [[UCAS]] tariff points for Graded and Vocational Graded Examinations in Dance at Level 3 were confirmed in August, meaning those candidates who have achieved a Pass or higher at Grades 6-8, Intermediate or Advanced Foundation can use their exam result as contributing towards their points tariff when applying to a university or Higher Education institution in the UK. The [[Genée International Ballet Competition]] 2011 was held for the first time in Cape Town, South Africa, at Artscape Theatre Centre, looking to present the competition in New Zealand in 2012. The first ever Dance Proms took place on Sunday 13 November at the Royal Albert Hall, London, as a partnership project between the [[International Dance Teachers Association]], the [[Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing]], RAD and the [[Royal Albert Hall]] working together in celebration of dance and hosting more than 450 young dancers on the stage. UK and Republic of Ireland members from the three dance organisations were invited to video and submit a short dance piece online, and a variety of acts were then chosen both by an esteemed panel of professionals and through a public vote to perform live at the Royal Albert Hall.

== Examinations ==
The RAD offers two examination syllabi, which are suitable for both male and female students and form the basis of the RAD's work in the UK and overseas.  Each programme consists of a series of progressively more difficult practical examinations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rad.org.uk/article_green.asp?id=112] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505024837/http://www.rad.org.uk/article_green.asp?id=112|date=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grades 1-8 and the first five levels of the Vocational Grades are accredited by the [[Ofqual|Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation]] (Ofqual) in England, the [[DCELLS|Department for Children, Education, Lifelong Learning and Skills]] (DCELLS) in [[Wales]] and the [[Council for the Curriculum, Examinations &amp; Assessment]] (CCEA) in [[Northern Ireland]].  These organisations are the Government approved qualifications regulators for their respective countries.  Candidates who successfully pass an RAD examination are awarded credit on the [[Qualifications and Credit Framework]]. The Academy also achieves SQA Accreditation (Scottish Qualifications Authority Accreditation) for RAD exams.

In 2009, the RAD launched a new syllabus at Pre-Primary and Primary level in dance.  These two new grades replace the existing Pre-Primary and Primary grades in ballet.  The Academy has since launched new work for grades 1-5

=== Graded Syllabus ===
The Graded Examination Syllabus consists of Pre-Primary, Primary, and numbered Grades 1-8. Each grade incorporates classical ballet, free movement and character dance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rad.org.uk/05exams/index.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621032832/http://www.rad.org.uk/05exams/index.htm|date=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The syllabus is devised to progress in difficulty from one grade to the next and a student studying the grades in sequence would be expected to develop a greater degree of dance technique at each level.

* '''[[Classical Ballet]]''' is one of the most widespread dance forms in the world.  Originating in the [[Italy|Italian]] royal courts of the [[Renaissance period]], over hundreds of years it has been developed into a highly technical dance form.  Ballet is the foundation of the RAD's work and is the most important part of the Graded Syllabi.
* '''Free Movement''' is the term applied to movement from dance styles such as natural movement, [[contemporary dance|contemporary]] and Classical Greek dance.  Free movement does not have to include codified dance vocabulary and is usually an improvisation based on the students interpretation of a piece of music or stimulus.
* '''[[Character dance|Character Dance]]''' is an integral part of classical ballet repertoire.  It is the stylised representation of a traditional [[folk dance]], normally from a [[Europe]]an country and uses movements and music which have been adapted for the theatre. The RAD syllabus uses character dances based on [[Hungary|Hungarian]], Russian and [[Poland|Polish]] folk dance.

Students who have studied a complete grade from the syllabus will normally take an examination organised by their dance teacher and held at the teachers studio or a suitable venue hired for the occasion.  In the examination, the students perform the relevant grade work for an RAD examiner, who assesses the artistic and technical execution of the grade.  A successful candidate receives a certificate printed with their name and the grade passed.  They also receive a report detailing what marks were awarded and highlighting which aspects of their performance need further improvement.  Unsuccessful candidates receive a report and a certificate of participation.  The Pre-Primary grade is devised for younger students who are not old enough to enter the Primary examination.  There is no examination offered at this level, however students can take part in a Presentation Class.

Presentation Classes were introduced for students who a dance teacher feels may not benefit from, or be suitable for taking the series of examinations.  In a Presentation Class, in contrast to an examination, the teacher and a small audience of spectators are present in the room.  The students perform for an examiner but are not assessed.  They dance a condensed selection of exercises from the appropriate grade and receive a certificate of participation, which is normally presented by the examiner at the end of the class.

As a syllabus devised specifically with children in mind, examinations are not compulsory. The entry level of a new student is decided by the dance teacher based upon the child’s age, natural ability for dance or previous examination passes with another dance school or examination board, such as the [[IDTA]] or [[Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing|ISTD]].

==== Grades ====
'''The Grades are:'''
* '''Pre-Primary''' – 5 years and over
* '''Primary''' – 5 years and over
* '''Grade 1''' – 6 years and over
* '''Grade 2''' – 7 years and over
* '''Grade 3''' – 8 years and over
* '''Grade 4''' – 9 years and over
* '''Grade 5''' – 10 years and over
* '''Grade 6''' – 11 years and over
* '''Grade 7''' – 12 years and over (non-compulsory)
* '''Grade 8''' – 13 years and over (compulsory)

=== Vocational Graded Syllabus ===
The Vocational Graded Syllabus is designed primarily for older children or young adults who are considering a career in professional dance, as a performer, teacher or in another capacity.  The vocational syllabus is technically demanding and comprises only Classical Ballet and [[En pointe|Pointe Work]].  Students choosing to study this series of awards are required to be competent in the fundamentals of ballet technique and movement vocabulary.

Unlike the Graded Examination Syllabus, the vocational grades have to be studied in sequence and the student must successfully pass an examination at each level before progressing onto the next.  All vocational examinations are organised by RAD headquarters and instead of being held at a dance teachers own venue, they are held in major cities worldwide.  In this situation, the session organiser is responsible for timetabling the examinations, and it is normal for students to dance alongside the students of other dance schools in the examination room.  As with the graded syllabus, successful candidates receive a certificate personalised with their name and the level passed.  They also receive a report, however for this series of examinations, there is a different marking system and assessment criteria.

Students studying the vocational syllabus are expected to achieve a high level of technical and artistic ability in ballet and it can take a great deal of time and commitment to reach the standard required to pass these examinations.  Normally, a student will begin studying the Vocational Graded Syllabus after completing Grade 5 in the Graded Examination Syllabus, however some students will continue to study the graded syllabus at the same time.  The Intermediate Foundation and Advanced Foundation examinations are the only optional exams in this series of awards.  They are devised for students who the teacher feels may need more preparation before studying at the higher level, however they are assessed in the same way, certificates awarded in the same way and credits awarded on the National Qualifications Framework.

'''The Vocational Grades are:'''
* '''''Intermediate Foundation''' - 11 years and over (non compulsory)''
* '''Intermediate''' - 12 years and over
* '''''Advanced Foundation''' - 13 years and over (non compulsory)''
* '''Advanced 1''' - 14 years and over
* '''Advanced 2''' - 15 years and over
* '''Solo Seal'''- Must hold their Advanced 2 with distinction

== Style and technique ==
The RAD method, is a ballet technique and training system, specially devised by the founders of the RAD, who merged their respective dance methods ([[La Scala Theatre Ballet|Italian]], [[French ballet|French]], [[Royal Danish Ballet|Danish]] and [[Russian ballet|Russian]]) to create a new style of ballet that is unique to the organisation.  The RAD method produces a style of ballet that has become recognised internationally as the English style of ballet.

== Training method ==
The most identifiable aspect of the RAD method is the attention to detail when learning the basic steps, and the progression in difficulty is often very slow. While the difficulty of an exercise may only increase slightly from grade to grade, more importance is placed on whether the student is performing the step with improved technique. For example, plie exercises are employed consistently throughout the lower grades to enable the student to progressively deepen the plie and improve turnout. The principle behind this is that if enough time is spent achieving optimal technique before introducing new vocabulary, the easier it is for the student to learn the harder steps, while exercising basic technique to the maximum at all times.

== Associations ==
From 1 October 2006, the RAD began a new association with the [[International Dance Teachers Association]], a dance organisation based in [[Brighton]], England. A press release issued to members of each organisation stated that "the two organisations would embark on a process of working together for the future of dance and to the mutual benefit of their members in both teacher education and training and examinations".

As a result of this association, both organisations have formally granted teachers of the respective organisation the opportunity to enter candidates for its examinations thereby ensuring that both organisations recognise the right of qualified teachers to enter candidates for examinations of either awarding body. At the RAD these members are called ‘teachers recognised by mutual agreement’. Whilst the new association is not a merger, it is intended that it will develop co-operation between the two organisations and mutual recognition of the training and qualifications that they both provide.

Dance Proms is a partnership project between the [[IDTA]], the [[Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing|ISTD]], RAD and the [[Royal Albert Hall]] working together in celebration of dance. In 2011, Dance Proms hosted more than 450 young dancers on the stage, showcasing a huge range of dance styles and cultural influences. UK and Republic of Ireland members from the three dance organisations are invited to video and submit a short dance piece online, featuring original choreography by themselves or their students in any dance genre, either as a solo, duet, or group performance. Acts are then chosen both by an esteemed panel of professionals and through a public vote to be performed live at the Royal Albert Hall, one of the world’s most iconic and prestigious venues. Dance Proms is designed to showcase the high standards of dance and dance teaching of the organisations and their members, and to raise standards and increase participation in and appreciation of dance in the UK.

'''Ballet Schools &amp; Companies''' - A number of international ballet schools offer their students the opportunity to take vocational examinations with the RAD.  As a result of this, dancers from many of the world's leading ballet companies are also alumni of the RAD. Examples include:

* [[Elmhurst School for Dance]]
* [[English National Ballet School]]
* [[National Ballet School of Canada]]
* [[Royal Ballet School]]

It should be noted that the Royal Academy of Dance is not affiliated to any of these schools.

'''Sami cuisine''' is the cuisine of peoples from the [[Sápmi (area)|Sápmi]] territory of the [[Sami people]], which spans [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Finland]] and [[Russia]]. Its traditional [[cuisine]] of each area has individual traits. 

==Staple food==
[[File:Dried reindeer meat.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Dried [[reindeer]] meat]]
Traditionally, the cuisine of Sápmi has been based on local materials, like [[fish]], [[Game (food)|game]], [[reindeer]] and [[Berry|berries]].&lt;ref name=Samer&gt;{{cite web|title=Roast reindeer and char|url=http://www.eng.samer.se/servlet/GetDoc?meta_id=1203|website=Eng.samer.se|accessdate=12 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151028082505/http://www.eng.samer.se/servlet/GetDoc?meta_id=1203|archivedate=28 October 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Berry|Berries]] have been important food, because other kinds of vegetables were not available during the long winters. Nowadays berries are parts of delicate sauces and desserts. The most valued berry of Sápmi is the [[cloudberry]]. [[Milk]] consumption varied among groups of Sami, but was not very common in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aikozlov.narod.ru/hypolactasia.html|title=Kozlov A., Lisitsyn D. Hypolactasia in Saami subpopulations of Russia and Finland|website=aikozlov.narod.ru|access-date=2016-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In eastern parts of Sápmi, [[reindeer herding]] became a way of life in the 19th century and, before that, people were [[Hunting|hunters]] and [[Fishing|fishers]]. These days reindeer is essential for Sami cuisine, but game, fish and wild birds are also important. The cuisine of [[Sápmi (area)|Sápmi]] consists of a variety of dishes which stem from differences in geography, culture and climate.

===Meat dishes===
Reindeer, [[fish]] and game meats are [[staple food]]s,&lt;ref name=Traveler&gt;{{cite web|last1=Torrents|first1=Anna|title=21 Cosas que no sabías de los Sami|url=http://www.traveler.es/viajes/mundo-traveler/articulos/21-cosas-que-no-sabias-de-los-sami/5622|website=Traveler.es|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with thousands of recipes and flavors, although spices other than salt are very rare. The local cuisine varies a lot depending of access to food. Sápmi's history with its many cultural influences has led to an array of dishes. Most dishes are made of reindeer meat, although some also are made of moose or sheep. [[smoking (cooking technique)|Smoking]] and [[Drying (food)|drying]] have historically been used to preserve meat and fish.

===Fish dishes===
Fishes in the mountains and forest areas of Sápmi include [[Salmon]], [[Common whitefish]], [[Perch]], [[Common roach|Roach]], and [[Salvelinus|Char]]. Fishes of the coastal areas of Sápmi include [[Cod]].

===New cooking===
In the last decades new influences have been introduced in traditional Sami cooking. A well-known dish of this cross-cooking is the Suovaskebab, which consists of sliced suovasbierggo, cucumber, salad and garlic dressing in a [[pita]] bread. The Suovaskebab can be found at festivals and fairs in northern Scandinavia. These days the old food culture is evolving and adapting. [[Fast food]] restaurants in Sápmi can have reindeer hamburger on their menus.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="83297">{{Semiotics}}
'''Semiotics''' (also called '''semiotic studies''') is the study of [[sign process]] ([[semiosis]]). It is not to be confused with the [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurean]] tradition called [[Ferdinand de Saussure#Semiology|semiology]], which is a subset of semiotics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cs.joensuu.fi/~whamalai/skc/semiology.html|title=Semiology vs. semiotics|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The science of communication studied through the interpretation of signs and symbols as they operate in various fields, esp. language", ''Oxford English Dictionary'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Semiotics includes the study of [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]] and sign processes, indication, designation, likeness, [[analogy]], [[allegory]], [[metonymy]], [[metaphor]], [[symbol]]ism, signification, and communication.

The semiotic tradition explores the study of signs and symbols as a significant part of communications. Different from linguistics, semiotics also studies non-linguistic [[sign system]]s.

Semiotics is frequently seen as having important [[anthropology|anthropological]] and [[sociology|sociological]] dimensions; for example, the Italian semiotician and novelist [[Umberto Eco]] proposed that every cultural phenomenon may be studied as communication.&lt;ref name=caesar&gt;{{cite book |last= Caesar |first= Michael |title= ''Umberto Eco: Philosophy, Semiotics, and the Work of Fiction'' |publisher= Wiley-Blackwell |year= 1999 |isbn= 978-0-7456-0850-1 |page= 55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some semioticians focus on the [[logic]]al dimensions of the science, however. They examine areas belonging also to the [[life sciences]]—such as how organisms make predictions about, and adapt to, their semiotic [[ecological niche|niche]] in the world (see [[semiosis]]). In general, semiotic theories take ''signs'' or sign systems as their object of study: the communication of information in living organisms is covered in [[biosemiotics]] (including [[zoosemiotics]]).

==Terminology==
The term derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] σημειωτικός ''sēmeiōtikos'', "observant of signs"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dshmeiwtiko%2Fs σημειωτικός], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; (from σημεῖον ''sēmeion'', "a sign, a mark")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dshmei%3Don σημεῖον], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and it was first used in English prior to 1676 by [[Henry Stubbes]]&lt;ref&gt;Stubbes, H.,''The Plus Ultra reduced to a Non Plus'' ... (London, England, 1670), page 75: "... nor is there any thing to be relied upon in Physick, but an exact knowledge of medicinal phisiology (founded on observation, not principles), '''semeiotics''', method of curing, and tried (not excogitated, not commanding) medicines ...."&lt;/ref&gt; (spelt ''semeiotics'') in a very precise sense to denote the branch of medical science relating to the interpretation of signs.&lt;ref&gt;"The branch of medical science relating to the interpretation of symptoms", ''Oxford English Dictionary'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the Greeks, "signs" occurred in the world of nature, "symbols" in the world of culture. Not until [[Augustine of Hippo]] would a thematic proposal for uniting the two under the notion of "sign" (''signum'') as transcending the nature-culture divide and identifying symbols as no more than a species (or sub-species) of ''signum'' be formally proposed. See the monograph study on this question, ''Le teorie del segno nell'antichità classica'' by Giovanni Manetti (Milan: Bompiani, 1987); trans. by Christine Richardson as ''Theories of the Sign in Classical Antiquity'' (Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1993). Classic also is the article by Luigi Romeo, "The Derivation of 'Semiotics' through the History of the Discipline", in ''Semiosis'' 6, Heft 2 (1977), 37–49. See also Andrew LaVelle's discussion of Romeo on Peirce-l at [http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.science.philosophy.peirce/3252].&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Locke]] used the term ''sem(e)iotike'' in book four, chapter 21 of ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/semiotics|title=semiotics {{!}} study of signs|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-06-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Locke used  the Greek word σημιωτική{{sic}}&lt;!--ι, not ει--&gt; in the [https://books.google.com/books?id=hGeKsjjtu6EC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s 4th ed. of 1700] (p. 437) of his ''Essay concerning Human Understanding''. He notably writes both (a) "σημιωτικὴ"&lt;!--non-capitalized first letter and featuring a grave-accented last vowel; see p. 437 (main text)--&gt; and (b) "Σημιωτική"&lt;!--capitalized first letter and featuring an acute-accented last vowel; see p. 437 (margins)--&gt;—when term (a) is followed by any kind of punctuation mark, it takes the form (b); see ''[[Ancient Greek accent]]''. The 1689/1690 first edition of Locke's ''Essay concerning Human Understanding'', in the concluding "Division of the Sciences" chapter, Locke introduces, in §4, "σημιωτική" as his proposed name synonymous with "''the Doctrine of Signs''" for the development of the future study of the ubiquitous role of signs within human awareness. In the 1689–1690 original edition, the "Division of the Sciences" chapter was Chapter XX. In the 4th ed. of 1700, a new Chapter XIX "Of Enthusiasm" is inserted into Book IV, after which the Chapter XX of the 1st ed. becomes Chapter XXI for all subsequent editions.&amp;nbsp;— see in John Deely, ''Why Semiotics?'' (Ottawa: Legas, 2004), 71–88, esp. 77–80 for the editions of Locke's ''Essay'' from 1689 through 1716. It is an important fact that Locke's proposal for the development of semiotics, with three passing exceptions as "asides" in the writings of [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[Leibniz]], and [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac|Condillac]], "is met with a resounding silence that lasts as long as modernity itself. Even Locke's devoted late modern editor, [[Alexander Campbell Fraser]], dismisses out of hand 'this crude and superficial scheme of Locke'" (see "Locke's modest proposal subversive of the way of ideas, its reception, and its bearing on the resolution of an ancient and a modern controversy in logic" in Chap. 14 of Deely's ''Four Ages of Understanding'', pp. 591–606). In the 1975 Oxford University Press critical edition, prepared and introduced by Peter Harold Nidditch, Nidditch tells us, in his "Foreword", p. vii, that he presents us with "a complete, critically established, and unmodernized text that aims at being historically faithful to Locke's final intentions"; p. xxv tells us further that "the present text is based on the original fourth edition of the ''Essay''", and that "readings in the other early authorized editions are adopted, in appropriate form, where necessary, and recorded otherwise in the textual notes". The term "σημιωτική" appears in that 1700 4th edition, the last published (but not the last prepared) within Locke's lifetime, with exactly the spelling and final accent found in the 1689/1690 1st edition. Yet if we turn to (the final) chapter XXI of the 1975 Oxford edition, we find on p. 720 not "σημιωτικὴ" but rather do we find substituted the "σημειωτικὴ" spelling (and with final accent reversed). (Note that in [[Greek orthography|Modern Greek]] and in [[Pronunciation of Ancient Greek in teaching|some systems for pronouncing classical Greek]], "σημ'''ι'''ωτική" and "σημ'''ει'''ωτική" are pronounced the same.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prior to Locke, the notion of "sign" as transcending the nature/culture divide was introduced by [[Augustine of Hippo]]—see John Deely, ''Augustine &amp; Poinsot: The Protosemiotic Development'' (Scranton: University of Scranton Press, 2009) for full details of Augustine's originality on this point—a specialized study was firmly established. Himself a man of [[medicine]], Locke was familiar with this "semeiotics" as naming a specialized branch within medical science. In his personal library were two editions of Scapula's 1579 abridgement of [[Henri Estienne|Henricus Stephanus]]' ''Thesaurus Graecae Linguae'', which listed σημειωτική as the name for "diagnostics", the branch of medicine concerned with interpreting symptoms of disease ("[[symptomatology]]"). Indeed the English physician and scholar [[Henry Stubbes]] had transliterated this term of specialized science into English precisely as "semeiotic" in his 1670 work, ''The Plus Ultra Reduced to a Non Plus'' (p.&amp;nbsp;75).&lt;/ref&gt; Here he explains how science may be divided into three parts:

{{quote|All that can fall within the compass of human understanding, being either, first, the nature of things, as they are in themselves, their relations, and their manner of operation: or, secondly, that which man himself ought to do, as a rational and voluntary agent, for the attainment of any end, especially happiness: or, thirdly, the ways and means whereby the knowledge of both the one and the other of these is attained and communicated; I think science may be divided properly into these three sorts.|Locke, 1823/1963, p. 174}}

[[John Locke|Locke]] then elaborates on the nature of this third category, naming it Σημειωτική (''Semeiotike'') and explaining it as "the doctrine of signs" in the following terms:

{{quote|Nor is there any thing to be relied upon in Physick,&lt;ref&gt;A now-obsolete term for the art or profession of curing disease with (herbal) medicines or (chemical) drugs; especially [[purgative]]s or [[cathartic]]s. Also, it specifically refers to the treatment of humans.&lt;/ref&gt; but an exact knowledge of medicinal physiology (founded on observation, not principles), semiotics, method of curing, and tried (not excogitated,&lt;ref&gt;That is, "thought out", "contrived", or "devised" (''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'').&lt;/ref&gt; not commanding) medicines.|Locke, 1823/1963, 4.21.4, p. 175}}

In the nineteenth century, [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] defined what he termed "semiotic" (which he sometimes spelled as "semeiotic") as the "quasi-necessary, or formal doctrine of signs", which abstracts "what must be the characters of all signs used by&amp;nbsp;... an intelligence capable of learning by experience",&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S., ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', vol. 2, paragraph 227.&lt;/ref&gt; and which is philosophical logic pursued in terms of signs and sign processes.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S. (1902), "Logic, Considered as Semeiotic", Manuscript L75, [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/l75.htm transcription] at ''Arisbe: The Peirce Gateway'', and, in particular, its "On the Definition of Logic" (Memoir 12), [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-05.htm#m12 transcription] at ''Arisbe''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peircean semiotic is triadic (sign, object, interpretant), as opposed to the dyadic Saussurian tradition (signifier, signified), and is conceived of as philosophical logic studied in terms of signs that are not always linguistic or artificial, and sign processes, modes of inference, and the inquiry process in general, with emphases not only on symbols but also on signs that are semblances ("icons") and signs that are signs by being factually connected ("indices") to their objects.&lt;/ref&gt; The Peirce scholar and editor Max H. Fisch&lt;ref&gt;Max Fisch compiled Peirce-related bibliographical supplements in 1952, 1964, 1966, 1974; was consulting editor on the 1977 microfilm of Peirce's published works and on the ''Comprehensive Bibliography'' associated with it; was among the main editors of the first five volumes (published 1981–1993) ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce''; and wrote a number of published articles on Peirce, many collected in 1986 in ''Peirce, Semeiotic, and Pragmatism'', Ketner and Kloesel, eds., Indiana University Press: [http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=19748 catalog page], Bloomington, IN, 480 pages. See [[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography]].&lt;/ref&gt; claimed in 1978&lt;ref&gt;Fisch, Max H. (1978), "Peirce's General Theory of Signs" in ''Sight, Sound, and Sense'', ed. T. A. Sebeok. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, pp. 31–70.&lt;/ref&gt; that "semeiotic" was Peirce's own preferred rendering of Locke's σημιωτική.

[[Charles W. Morris]] followed Peirce in using the term "semiotic" and in extending the discipline beyond human communication to animal learning and use of signals.

[[Ferdinand de Saussure]], however, founded his semiotics, which he called [[Ferdinand de Saussure#Semiology|semiology]], in the social sciences:

{{quote|It is... possible to conceive of a science which studies the role of signs as part of social life. It would form part of social psychology, and hence of general psychology. We shall call it semiology (from the Greek ''semeîon'', 'sign'). It would investigate the nature of signs and the laws governing them. Since it does not yet exist, one cannot say for certain that it will exist. But it has a right to exist, a place ready for it in advance. Linguistics is only one branch of this general science. The laws which semiology will discover will be laws applicable in linguistics, and linguistics will thus be assigned to a clearly defined place in the field of human knowledge. |Cited in [[Daniel Chandler|Chandler's]] "Semiotics for Beginners", Introduction.}}

While the Saussurean semiotic is dyadic (sign/syntax, signal/semantics), the Peircean semiotic is triadic (sign, object, interpretant), being conceived as philosophical logic studied in terms of signs that are not always linguistic or artificial. The Peircean semiotic addresses not only the external communication mechanism, as per Saussure, but the internal representation machine, investigating not just sign processes, or modes of inference, but the whole inquiry process in general. Peircean semiotics further subdivides each of the three triadic elements into three sub-types. For example, signs can be icons, indices, and symbols.

[[Yuri Lotman]] introduced Eastern Europe to semiotics and adopted Locke's coinage as the name to subtitle (''Σημειωτική'') his founding at the [[University of Tartu]] in [[Estonia]] in 1964 of the first semiotics journal, ''[[Sign Systems Studies]]''.

[[Thomas Sebeok]] assimilated "semiology" to "semiotics" as a part to a whole,&lt;ref&gt;The whole anthology, ''Frontiers in Semiotics'', was devoted to the documentation of this ''pars pro toto'' move of Sebeok.&lt;/ref&gt; and was involved in choosing the name ''Semiotica'' for the first international journal devoted to the study of signs.

Saussurean semiotics have been challenged with serious criticism, for example by [[Jacques Derrida]]'s assertion that signifier and signified are not fixed, coining the expression ''différance'', relating to the endless deferral of meaning, and to the absence of a 'transcendent signified'. For Derrida, 'il n'y a pas de hors-texte' ("there is nothing outside the text"). He was in obvious opposition to materialists and marxists who argued that a sign has to point towards a real meaning, and cannot be controlled by the referent's closed-loop references.

==History==

The importance of signs and signification has been recognized throughout much of the history of [[philosophy]], and in psychology as well. [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] both explored the relationship between signs and the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://visual-memory.co.uk/daniel/Documents/S4B/sem02.html|title=Semiotics for Beginners: Signs|website=visual-memory.co.uk|access-date=2017-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Augustine considered the nature of the sign within a conventional system. These theories have had a lasting effect in [[Western philosophy]], especially through [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] philosophy. (More recently, Umberto Eco, in his ''[[Umberto Eco#Semiotics|Semiotics and the Philosophy of Language]]'', has argued that semiotic theories are implicit in the work of most, perhaps all, major thinkers.)

The general study of signs that began in Latin with Augustine culminated in Latin with the 1632 ''Tractatus de Signis'' of [[John Poinsot]], and then began anew in late modernity with the attempt in 1867 by Charles Sanders Peirce to draw up a "new list of categories". Peirce aimed to base his new list directly upon experience precisely as constituted by action of signs, in contrast with the list of Aristotle's categories which aimed to articulate within experience the dimension of being that is independent of experience and knowable as such, through human understanding.

The estimative powers of animals interpret the environment as sensed to form a "meaningful world" of objects, but the objects of this world (or "Umwelt", in [[Jakob von Uexküll]]'s term,&lt;ref&gt;See "Umwelt", ''Semiotica'' 134–1/4 (2001), 125–135; Special Issue on "Jakob von Uexküll: A paradigm for biology and semiotics" Guest-Edited by Kalevi Kull.&lt;/ref&gt;) consist exclusively of objects related to the animal as desirable (+), undesirable (–), or "safe to ignore" (0).

In contrast to this, human understanding adds to the animal "Umwelt" a relation of self-identity within objects which transforms objects experienced into ''things'' as well as +, –, 0 objects.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Martin Heidegger]] (1927), in the 1962 trans. by John Macquarrie &amp; Edward Robinson, ''[[Being and Time]]'' (New York, NY: Harper &amp; Row), p. 487: "The distinction between the being of existing Dasein and the Being of entities, such as Reality, which do not have the character of Dasein...is nothing with which philosophy may tranquilize itself. It has long been known that ancient ontology works with 'Thing-concepts' and that there is a danger of 'reifying consciousness'. But what does this 'reifying' signify? Where does it arise? Why does Being get 'conceived' 'proximally' in terms of the present-at-hand ''and not'' in terms of the ready-to-hand, which indeed lies ''closer'' to us? ''Why'' does reifying always keep coming back to exercise its dominion?" This is the question that the Umwelt/Lebenswelt distinction as here drawn answers to.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the generically animal objective world as "Umwelt", becomes a species-specifically human objective world or "Lebenswelt" (life-world), wherein linguistic communication, rooted in the biologically underdetermined "Innenwelt" (inner-world) of humans, makes possible the further dimension of cultural organization within the otherwise merely social organization of non-human animals whose powers of observation may deal only with directly sensible instances of objectivity. This further point, that human culture depends upon language understood first of all not as communication, but as the biologically underdetermined aspect or feature of the human animal's "Innenwelt", was originally clearly identified by Thomas A. Sebeok.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Sebeok, "The Evolution of Communication and the Origin of Language", lecture in the 1984 June 1–3 International Summer Institute for Semiotic and Structural Studies 1984 Colloquium on "Phylogeny and Ontogeny of Communication Systems", published under the title "Communication, Language, and Speech.

Peirce's distinguished between the interpretant and the interpreter. The interpretant is the internal, mental representation that mediates between the object and its sign. The interpreter is the human who is creating the interpretant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://courses.logos.it/EN/2_18.html|title=LOGOS - Multilingual Translation Portal|website=courses.logos.it|access-date=2017-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce's "interpretant" notion opened the way to understanding an action of signs beyond the realm of animal life (study of "phytosemiosis" + "zoösemiosis" + "anthroposemiosis" = ''biosemiotics''), which was his first advance beyond Latin Age semiotics. Other early theorists in the field of semiotics include [[Charles W. Morris]].&lt;ref&gt;1971, orig. 1938, ''Writings on the general theory of signs'', Mouton, The Hague, The Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Black]] argued that the work of [[Bertrand Russell]] was seminal in the field.&lt;ref&gt;1944, Black M.

==Formulations==
[[File:Kstovo-BusStation-Sinks-1444.JPG|thumb|[[Color code|Color-coding]] hot- and cold-water faucets (taps) is common in many cultures but, as this example shows, the coding may be rendered meaningless because of context. The two faucets (taps) probably were sold as a coded set, but the code is unusable (and ignored), as there is a single water supply.]]
Semioticians classify signs or sign systems in relation to the way they are transmitted (see [[modality (semiotics)|modality]]). This process of carrying meaning depends on the use of [[code (semiotics)|codes]] that may be the individual sounds or letters that humans use to form words, the body movements they make to show attitude or emotion, or even something as general as the clothes they wear. To [[neologism|coin]] a word to refer to a ''thing'' (see [[lexical (semiotics)|lexical]] words), the [[community]] must agree on a simple meaning (a [[denotation (semiotics)|denotative]] meaning) within their language, but that word can transmit that meaning only within the language's grammatical structures and codes (see [[syntax]] and [[semantics]]). Codes also represent the [[value (semiotics)|values]] of the [[culture]], and are able to add new shades of [[connotation (semiotics)|connotation]] to every aspect of life.

To explain the relationship between semiotics and [[communication studies]], [[communication]] is defined as the process of transferring data and-or meaning from a source to a receiver. Hence, communication theorists construct models based on codes, media, and contexts to explain the [[biology]], [[psychology]], and [[mechanics]] involved. Both disciplines recognize that the technical process cannot be separated from the fact that the receiver must [[decode (semiotics)|decode]] the data, i.e., be able to distinguish the data as [[Salience (semiotics)|salient]], and make meaning out of it. This implies that there is a necessary overlap between semiotics and communication. Indeed, many of the concepts are shared, although in each field the emphasis is different. In ''Messages and Meanings: An Introduction to Semiotics'', [[Marcel Danesi]] (1994) suggested that semioticians' priorities were to study [[Sign (semiotics)|signification]] first, and communication second. A more extreme view is offered by [[Jean-Jacques Nattiez]] (1987; trans. 1990: 16), who, as a [[musicology|musicologist]], considered the theoretical study of communication irrelevant to his application of semiotics.

Semiotics differs from [[linguistics]] in that it generalizes the definition of a sign to encompass signs in any medium or sensory modality. Thus it broadens the range of sign systems and sign relations, and extends the definition of language in what amounts to its widest analogical or metaphorical sense. Peirce's definition of the term "semiotic" as the study of necessary features of signs also has the effect of distinguishing the discipline from linguistics as the study of contingent features that the world's languages happen to have acquired in the course of their evolutions. From a subjective standpoint, perhaps more difficult is the distinction between semiotics and the [[philosophy of language]]. In a sense, the difference lies between separate traditions rather than subjects. Different authors have called themselves "philosopher of language" or "semiotician". This difference does ''not'' match the separation between [[analytic philosophy|analytic]] and [[continental philosophy]]. On a closer look, there may be found some differences regarding subjects. Philosophy of language pays more attention to [[natural language]]s or to languages in general, while semiotics is deeply concerned with non-linguistic signification. Philosophy of language also bears connections to linguistics, while semiotics might appear closer to some of the [[humanities]] (including [[literary theory]]) and to [[cultural anthropology]].

Semiosis or ''semeiosis'' is the process that forms meaning from any organism's apprehension of the world through signs. Scholars who have talked about semiosis in their subtheories of semiotics include [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C.&amp;nbsp;S. Peirce]], [[John Deely]], and [[Umberto Eco]]. Cognitive semiotics is combining methods and theories developed in the disciplines of cognitive methods and theories developed in semiotics and the humanities, with providing new information into human signification and its manifestation in cultural practices. The research on cognitive semiotics brings together semiotics from linguistics, cognitive science, and related disciplines on a common meta-theoretical platform of concepts, methods, and shared data.

[[Cognitive semiotics]] may also be seen as the study of meaning-making by employing and integrating methods and theories developed in the cognitive sciences. This involves conceptual and textual analysis as well as experimental investigations. Cognitive semiotics initially was developed at the Center for Semiotics at [[Aarhus University]] ([[Denmark]]), with an important connection with the Center of Functionally Integrated Neuroscience (CFIN) at Aarhus Hospital. Amongst the prominent cognitive semioticians are [[Per Aage Brandt]], Svend Østergaard, Peer Bundgård, Frederik Stjernfelt, Mikkel Wallentin, Kristian Tylén, Riccardo Fusaroli, and Jordan Zlatev. Zlatev later in co-operation with Göran Sonesson established CCS (Center for Cognitive Semiotics) at [[Lund University]], Sweden.

==Notable semioticians==
* [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (1839–1914), a [[History of logic|noted logician]] who founded philosophical [[pragmatism]], defined ''semiosis'' as an irreducibly triadic process wherein something, as an object, logically determines or influences something as a sign to determine or influence something as an interpretation or ''interpretant'', itself a sign, thus leading to further interpretants.&lt;ref&gt;For Peirce's definitions of signs and semiosis, see under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/sign.html Sign]" and "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/semiosis.html Semiosis, semeiosy]" in the ''[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms]''; and "[http://perso.numericable.fr/robert.marty/semiotique/access.htm 76 definitions of sign by C.&amp;nbsp;S. Peirce]" collected by Robert Marty. Peirce's "[http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/ep/ep2/ep2book/ch02/ep2ch2.htm What Is a Sign]" (MS 404 of 1894, ''Essential Peirce'' v. 2, pp. 4–10) provides intuitive help.&lt;/ref&gt; Semiosis is logically structured to perpetuate itself. The object may be quality, fact, rule, or even fictional ([[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]]), and may be "immediate" to the sign, the object as represented in the sign, or "dynamic", the object as it really is, on which the immediate object is founded. The interpretant may be "immediate" to the sign, all that the sign immediately expresses, such as a word's usual meaning; or "dynamic", such as a state of agitation; or "final" or "normal", the ultimate ramifications of the sign about its object, to which inquiry taken far enough would be destined and with which any interpretant, at most, may coincide.&lt;ref&gt;See Peirce, excerpt from a letter to William James, March 14, 1909, ''Collected Papers'' v. 8, paragraph 314. Also see under relevant entries in the ''[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms]''. On coincidence of actual opinion with final opinion, see MS 218, [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/logic/ms218.htm transcription] at ''Arisbe'', and appearing in ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce'' v. 3, p.&amp;nbsp;79.&lt;/ref&gt; His ''semiotic''&lt;ref&gt;He spelt it "semiotic" and "semeiotic". See under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/semeiotic.html Semeiotic] [etc.] in the ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms''.&lt;/ref&gt; covered not only artificial, linguistic, and symbolic signs, but also semblances such as kindred sensible qualities, and indices such as reactions. He came c.&amp;nbsp;1903&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, ''Collected Papers'' v. 2, paragraphs 243–263, written c.&amp;nbsp;1903.&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)|classify any sign]] by three interdependent trichotomies, intersecting to form ten (rather than 27) classes of sign.&lt;ref&gt;He worked on but did not perfect a finer-grained system of ten trichotomies, to be combined into 66 ([[Triangular number|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;]]) classes of sign. That raised for Peirce 59,049 classificatory questions (59,049 = 3&lt;SUP&gt;10&lt;/SUP&gt;, or 3 to the 10th power). See p. 482 in "Excerpts from Letters to Lady Welby", ''Essential Peirce'' v. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Signs also enter into various kinds of meaningful combinations; Peirce covered both semantic and syntactical issues in his speculative grammar. He regarded formal semiotic as logic ''per se'' and part of philosophy; as also encompassing study of arguments ([[Abductive reasoning|hypothetical]], [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]], and [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]]) and inquiry's methods including pragmatism; and as allied to, but distinct from logic's pure mathematics. In addition to pragmatism, Peirce provided a definition of the term "sign" as:
:&lt;blockquote&gt;"A sign, or representamen, is something which stands to somebody for something in some respect or capacity. It addresses somebody, that is, creates in the mind of that person an equivalent sign. That sign which it creates I call the interpretant of the first sign. The sign stands for something, its object not in all respects, but in reference to a sort of idea." Peirce called the sign a ''representamen'', in order to bring out the fact that a sign is something that "represents" something else in order to suggest it (that is, "re-present" it) in some way.&lt;ref name="CREDO Reference"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ryan|first=Michael|title=The Encyclopedia of Literary and Cultural Theory|year=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Hoboken, NJ, USA|isbn=978-1-4051-8312-3|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/wileylitcul/semiotics}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a summary of Peirce's contributions to semiotics, see Liszka (1996) or Atkin (2006).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] (1857–1913), the "father" of modern [[linguistics]], proposed a dualistic notion of signs, relating the ''signifier'' as the form of the word or phrase uttered, to the ''signified'' as the mental concept. According to Saussure, the sign is completely arbitrary—i.e., there is no necessary connection between the sign and its meaning. This sets him apart from previous philosophers, such as [[Plato]] or the [[Scholasticism|scholastics]], who thought that there must be some connection between a signifier and the object it signifies. In his ''[[Course in General Linguistics]]'', Saussure credits the American linguist [[William Dwight Whitney]] (1827–1894) with insisting on the arbitrary nature of the sign. Saussure's insistence on the arbitrariness of the sign also has influenced later philosophers and theorists such as Jacques Derrida, [[Roland Barthes]], and [[Jean Baudrillard]]. Ferdinand de Saussure coined the term ''sémiologie'' while teaching his landmark "Course on General Linguistics" at the [[University of Geneva]] from 1906 to 1911. Saussure posited that no word is inherently meaningful. Rather a word is only a "signifier", i.e., the representation of something, and it must be combined in the brain with the "signified", or the thing itself, in order to form a meaning-imbued "sign". Saussure believed that dismantling signs was a real science, for in doing so we come to an empirical understanding of how humans synthesize physical stimuli into words and other abstract concepts.
* [[Jakob von Uexküll]] (1864–1944) studied the [[sign process]]es in animals. He used the German word for "environment", ''[[umwelt]]'', to describe the individual's subjective world, and he invented the concept of [[functional circle]] (''funktionskreis'') as a general model of sign processes. In his ''Theory of Meaning'' (''Bedeutungslehre'', 1940), he described the semiotic approach to [[biology]], thus establishing the field that now is called [[biosemiotics]].
* [[Valentin Voloshinov]] (1895–1936) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-Russian linguist, whose work has been influential in the field of [[literary theory]] and [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Ideology|theory of ideology]]. Written in the late 1920s in the USSR, Voloshinov's ''Marxism and the Philosophy of Language'' (tr.: Marksizm i Filosofiya Yazyka) developed a counter-Saussurean linguistics, which situated language use in social process rather than in an entirely decontexualized Saussurean ''langue''.
* [[Louis Hjelmslev]] (1899–1965) developed a formalist approach to Saussure's structuralist theories. His best known work is ''Prolegomena to a Theory of Language'', which was expanded in ''Résumé of the Theory of Language'', a formal development of ''glossematics'', his scientific calculus of language.
* [[Charles W. Morris]] (1901–1979). In his 1938 ''Foundations of the Theory of Signs'', he defined semiotics as grouped into three branches:
*# Semantics: relation between signs and the things to which they refer; their signified denotata, or meaning
*# Syntactics/Syntax: relations among or between signs in formal structures
*# Pragmatics: relation between signs and sign-using agents or interpreters
&lt;blockquote&gt;Syntactics is the Morris'ean branch of semiotics that deals with the formal properties of signs and symbols; the interrelation of the signs, without regard to meaning. Semantics deals with the relation of signs to their designata and the objects that they may or do denote; the relation between the signs and the objects to which they apply. Finally, pragmatics deals with the biotic aspects of semiosis, with all the psychological, biological, and sociological phenomena that occur in the functioning of signs; the relation between the sign system and its human (or animal) user. Unlike his mentor [[George Herbert Mead]], Morris was a behaviorist and sympathetic to the [[Vienna Circle]] [[positivism]] of his colleague, [[Rudolf Carnap]]. Morris was accused by [[John Dewey]] of misreading Peirce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2019493 |jstor=2019493 |title=Peirce's Theory of Linguistic Signs, Thought, and Meaning |journal=The Journal of Philosophy |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=85 |year=1946 |last1=Dewey |first1=John }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* [[Thure von Uexküll]] (1908–2004), the "father" of modern [[psychosomatic medicine]], developed a diagnostic method based on semiotic and biosemiotic analyses.
* [[Roland Barthes]] (1915–1980) was a French literary theorist and semiotician. He often would critique pieces of cultural material to expose how bourgeois society used them to impose its values upon others. For instance, the portrayal of wine drinking in French society as a robust and healthy habit would be a bourgeois ideal perception contradicted by certain realities (i.e. that wine can be unhealthy and inebriating). He found semiotics useful in conducting these critiques. Barthes explained that these bourgeois cultural myths were second-order signs, or connotations. A picture of a full, dark bottle is a sign, a signifier relating to a signified: a fermented, alcoholic beverage—wine. However, the bourgeois take this signified and apply their own emphasis to it, making "wine" a new signifier, this time relating to a new signified: the idea of healthy, robust, relaxing wine. Motivations for such manipulations vary from a desire to sell products to a simple desire to maintain the status quo. These insights brought Barthes very much in line with similar Marxist theory.
[[File:Exemple de signalement visuel du statut social chez un Cichlidé.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Signaling and communication between the ''[[Astatotilapia burtoni]]'']]
* [[Algirdas Julien Greimas]] (1917–1992) developed a structural version of semiotics named, "generative semiotics", trying to shift the focus of discipline from signs to systems of signification. His theories develop the ideas of Saussure, Hjelmslev, [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], and [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]].
* [[Thomas A. Sebeok]] (1920–2001), a student of Charles W. Morris, was a prolific and wide-ranging American semiotician. Although he insisted that animals are not capable of language, he expanded the purview of semiotics to include non-human signaling and communication systems, thus raising some of the issues addressed by [[philosophy of mind]] and coining the term [[zoosemiotics]]. Sebeok insisted that all communication was made possible by the relationship between an organism and the environment in which it lives. He also posed the equation between ''semiosis'' (the activity of interpreting signs) and ''life''—a view that the [[Copenhagen-Tartu biosemiotic school]] has further developed.
* [[Yuri Lotman]] (1922–1993) was the founding member of the [[Tartu]] (or Tartu-Moscow) [[Tartu-Moscow Semiotic School|Semiotic School]]. He developed a semiotic approach to the study of culture—[[semiotics of culture]]—and established a communication model for the study of text semiotics. He also introduced the concept of the [[semiosphere]]. Among his Moscow colleagues were [[Vladimir Toporov]], [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]] and [[Boris Uspensky]].
* [[Christian Metz (critic)|Christian Metz]] (1931–1993) pioneered the application of Saussurean semiotics to [[film theory]], applying [[syntagmatic analysis]] to scenes of films and grounding [[film semiotics]] in greater context.
* [[Eliseo Verón]] (1935–2014) developed his "Social Discourse Theory" inspired in the Peircian conception of "Semiosis".
* The Mu Group ([[Groupe µ]]) (founded 1967) developed a structural version of [[rhetorics]], and the [[visual semiotics]].
* [[Umberto Eco]] (1932–2016) was an [[Italy|Italian]] novelist, semiotician and academic. He made a wider audience aware of semiotics by various publications, most notably ''A Theory of Semiotics'' and his novel, ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'', which includes (second to its plot) applied semiotic operations. His most important contributions to the field bear on interpretation, encyclopedia, and model reader. He also criticized in several works (''A theory of semiotics'', ''La struttura assente'', ''Le signe'', ''La production de signes'') the "iconism" or "iconic signs" (taken from Peirce's most famous triadic relation, based on indexes, icons, and symbols), to which he proposed four modes of sign production: recognition, ostension, replica, and invention.
* [[Paul Bouissac]] (1934–) A world renowned expert of circus studies, Bouissac is known for developing a range of semiotic interpretations of circus performances. This includes the multimodal dimensions of clowns and clowning, jugglers, and trapeze acts. He is the author of several books relating to the semiotics of the circus. Bouissac is the Series Editor for the Advances in Semiotics Series for Bloomsbury Academic. He runs the SemiotiX Bulletin which has a global readership, is a founding editor of the Public Journal of Semiotics, and was a central founding figure in the Toronto Semiotic Circle. He is Professor Emeritus of Victoria College, University of Toronto. The personal, professional, and intellectual life of Bouissac is recounted in the book, ''[[The Pleasures of Time: Two Men, A Life]]'', by his life-long partner, the sociologist Stephen Harold Riggins.
*[[Julia Kristeva]] (1941–), a student of [[Lucien Goldmann]] and Roland Barthes, Bulgarian-French semiotician, [[literary critic]], [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]], [[French feminist|feminist]], and [[novelist]]. She uses psychoanalytical concepts together with the semiotics, distinguishing the two components in the signification, the symbolic and the semiotic''.'' Kristeva also studies the representation of women and women's bodies in popular culture, such as [[Misogyny in horror films|slasher films]] and has had a remarkable influence on feminism and feminist literary studies.

==Semiotics of dreaming==

The flexibility of human semiotics is well demonstrated in dreams. [[Sigmund Freud]]&lt;ref&gt;Freud, S. (1900) ''The Interpretation of Dreams.'' London: Hogarth&lt;/ref&gt; spelled out how meaning in dreams rests on a blend of images, affects, sounds, words, and kinesthetic sensations. In his chapter on "The Means of Representation" he showed how the most abstract sorts of meaning and logical relations can be represented by spatial relations. Two images in sequence may indicate "if this, then that" or "despite this, that". Freud thought the dream started with "dream thoughts" which were like logical, verbal sentences. He believed that the dream thought was in the nature of a taboo wish that would awaken the dreamer. In order to safeguard sleep, the mindbrain converts and disguises the verbal dream thought into an imagistic form, through processes he called the "dream-work".

==Current applications==
[[File:Chart Semiotics of Social Networking.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Chart [[semiotics of social networking]]]]
Applications of semiotics include:
*It represents a [[methodology]] for the analysis of "texts" regardless of [[modality (Semiotics)|the medium in which it is presented]]. For these purposes, "text" is any message preserved in a form whose existence is independent of both sender and receiver;
*It may improve [[ergonomic]] design in situations where it is important to ensure that human beings are able to interact more effectively with their environments, whether it be on a large scale, as in [[architecture]], or on a small scale, such as the configuration of instrumentation for human use.

In some countries, its role is limited to [[literary criticism]] and an appreciation of audio and visual media. This narrow focus may inhibit a more general study of the social and political forces shaping how different media are used and their dynamic status within modern culture. Issues of technological [[determinism]] in the choice of media and the design of communication strategies assume new importance in this age of mass media.

Publication of research is both in dedicated journals such as ''[[Sign Systems Studies]]'', established by [[Yuri Lotman]] and published by [[Tartu University Press]]; ''[[Semiotica]]'', founded by [[Thomas A. Sebeok]] and published by [[Mouton de Gruyter]]; ''Zeitschrift für Semiotik''; ''European Journal of Semiotics''; ''[[Versus (journal)|Versus]]'' (founded and directed by [[Umberto Eco]]), et al.; ''[[The American Journal of Semiotics]]''; and as articles accepted in periodicals of other disciplines, especially journals oriented toward philosophy and cultural criticism.

The major semiotic book series "Semiotics, Communication, Cognition", published by [[De Gruyter Mouton]] (series editors Paul Cobley and [[Kalevi Kull]]) replaces the former "Approaches to Semiotics" (more than 120 volumes) and "Approaches to Applied Semiotics" (series editor [[Thomas A. Sebeok]]). Since 1980 the [[Semiotic Society of America]] has produced an annual conference series: ''[[Semiotics: The Proceedings of the Semiotic Society of America]]''.

[[Marketing communications|Marketing]] is another application of semiotics. Epure, Eisenstat and Dinu (2014) said, "semiotics allows for the practical distinction of persuasion from manipulation in marketing communication" (p.&amp;nbsp;592).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Epure |first1=M. |last2=Eisenstat |first2=E. |last3=Dinu |first3=C. |year=2014 |title=Semiotics And Persuasion In Marketing Communication |journal=Linguistic &amp; Philosophical Investigations |volume=13 |pages=592–605 |url=https://www.ceeol.com/search/article-detail?id=30143 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Semiotics are used in marketing as a [[Marketing strategy|persuasive device]] to influence buyers to change their attitudes and behaviors in the market place. Two ways that Epure, Eisenstat and Dinu (2014) state that semiotics are used are:
# Surface: signs are used to create personality for the product; creativity plays its foremost role at this level.
# Underlying: the concealed meaning of the text, imagery, sounds, etc.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Semiotics analysis is used by scholars and professional researchers as a method to interpret meanings behind symbols and how the meanings are created. Below is an example of how semiotic analysis is utilized in a research paper published in an academic journal: Educational Research and Reviews.

==Branches==
Semiotics has sprouted subfields including, but not limited to, the following:
* [[Biosemiotics]]: the study of semiotic processes at all levels of biology, or a semiotic study of living systems (e.g., [[Copenhagen–Tartu School]]).
* [[Semiotic anthropology]].
* [[Cognitive semiotics]]: the study of meaning-making by employing and integrating methods and theories developed in the cognitive sciences. This involves conceptual and textual analysis as well as experimental investigations. Cognitive semiotics initially was developed at the Center for Semiotics at [[Aarhus University]] (Denmark), with an important connection with the Center of Functionally Integrated Neuroscience (CFIN) at Aarhus Hospital. Amongst the prominent cognitive semioticians are [[Per Aage Brandt]], Svend Østergaard, Peer Bundgård, Frederik Stjernfelt, Mikkel Wallentin, Kristian Tylén, Riccardo Fusaroli, and Jordan Zlatev. Zlatev later in co-operation with Göran Sonesson established the Center for Cognitive Semiotics (CCS) at [[Lund University]], Sweden.
* [[Computational semiotics]]: attempts to engineer the process of semiosis, in the study of and design for [[human-computer interaction]] or to mimic aspects of human [[cognition]] through [[artificial intelligence]] and [[knowledge representation]]. See also [[cybercognition]].
* Cultural and [[Semiotic literary criticism|literary semiotics]]: examines the literary world, the visual media, the mass media, and advertising in the work of writers such as Roland Barthes, [[Marcel Danesi]], and [[Yuri Lotman]] (e.g., [[Tartu–Moscow Semiotic School]]).
* [[Cybersemiotics]]: built on two already-generated interdisciplinary approaches: cybernetics and systems theory including [[information theory]] and science, and Peircean semiotics including phenomenology and pragmatic aspects of linguistics, attempts to make the two interdisciplinary paradigms—both going beyond mechanistic and pure constructivistic ideas—complement each other in a common framework.

===Pictorial semiotics===
Pictorial semiotics&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Pictorial Semiotics|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100326357|website=Oxford Index|publisher=Oxford University Press, n.d. Web.}}&lt;/ref&gt; is intimately connected to art history and theory. It goes beyond them both in at least one fundamental way, however. While [[art history]] has limited its visual analysis to a small number of pictures that qualify as "works of art", pictorial semiotics focuses on the properties of pictures in a general sense, and on how the artistic conventions of images can be interpreted through pictorial codes. Pictorial codes are the way in which viewers of pictorial representations seem automatically to decipher the artistic conventions of images by being unconsciously familiar with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Pictorial Codes|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100326343?rskey=TyYRDS&amp;result=6|website=Oxford Index|publisher=Oxford University Press, n.d. Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Göran Sonesson, a Swedish semiotician, pictures can be analyzed by three models: (a) the narrative model, which concentrates on the relationship between pictures and time in a chronological manner as in a comic strip; (b) the rhetoric model, which compares pictures with different devices as in a metaphor; and (c) the laokoon (or laocoon) model, which considers the limits and constraints of pictorial expressions by comparing textual mediums that utilize time with visual mediums that utilize space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sonesson|first1=Göran|title=Methods and Models in Pictorial Semiotics|date=1988|pages=2–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The break from traditional art history and theory—as well as from other major streams of semiotic analysis—leaves open a wide variety of possibilities for pictorial semiotics. Some influences have been drawn from phenomenological analysis, cognitive psychology, structuralist, and cognitivist linguistics, and visual anthropology and sociology.

One of the many ways that pictorial semiotics has been changing has been through the use of emojis in email, text or other online conversations. Though not seen as works of art, these small images of happy, sad, winking faces or even a smiling poo image, have made their way into our everyday communication through digital devices. In the early advances of mobile technology and the increasing manner in which such devices are used, many in the linguistic community felt that vital communication cues, such as the importance of nonverbal cues, would be lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.7575/aiac.alls.v.7n.6p.56 |title=Are Emojis Creating a New or Old Visual Language for New Generations? A Socio-semiotic Study |journal=Advances in Language and Literary Studies |volume=7 |issue=6 |year=2016 |pages=56–69 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another concern is that with the high use of these symbols would begin to oversimplify our language to where the language's strength would be lost.

However, others have said that the use of emojis in digital conversation has helped to give more clarity to a conversation. Since the ability to read another person's facial expressions, nonverbal cues or tone of voice isn’t possible in a typed message, emojis allow a communicator to convey attitudes and emotions to their message receiver. As for oversimplifying our language, some have argued that perhaps our language is not being simplified, but that new generations are revitalizing the early forms of semiotics like cave paintings or hieroglyphics. As technology advances, so will the use of emojis or possibly a more advanced form of pictorial symbols to use in digital communication.

===Globalization===
Studies have shown that semiotics may be used to make or break a [[brand]]. [[Culture code]]s strongly influence whether a population likes or dislikes a brand's marketing, especially internationally. If the company is unaware of a culture's codes, it runs the risk of failing in its marketing. [[Globalization]] has caused the development of a global consumer culture where products have similar associations, whether positive or negative, across numerous markets.&lt;ref name="Alden"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/1252002 |jstor=1252002 |title=Brand Positioning Through Advertising in Asia, North America, and Europe: The Role of Global Consumer Culture |journal=Journal of Marketing |volume=63 |pages=75 |year=1999 |last1=Alden |first1=Dana L |last2=Steenkamp |first2=Jan-Benedict E. M |last3=Batra |first3=Rajeev }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mistranslations may lead to instances of "[[Engrish]]" or "[[Chinglish]]", terms for unintentionally humorous cross-cultural slogans intended to be understood in English. This may be caused by a sign that, in Peirce's terms, mistakenly indexes or symbolizes something in one culture, that it does not in another.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, Daniel. (2001/2007). ''Semiotics: The Basics''. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, it creates a connotation that is culturally-bound, and that violates some culture code. Theorists who have studied humor (such as [[Schopenhauer]]) suggest that contradiction or incongruity creates absurdity and therefore, humor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00913367.1997.10673526 |title=Assessing the Use and Impact of Humor on Advertising Effectiveness: A Contingency Approach |journal=Journal of Advertising |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=17 |year=1997 |last1=Spotts |first1=Harlan E |last2=Weinberger |first2=Marc G |last3=Parsons |first3=Amy L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Violating a culture code creates this construct of ridiculousness for the culture that owns the code. Intentional humor also may fail cross-culturally because jokes are not on code for the receiving culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/540503 |jstor=540503 |title=Why Do They Laugh? An Interactional Approach to Humor in Traditional Iranian Improvisatory Theater: Performance and Its Effects |journal=The Journal of American Folklore |volume=94 |issue=374 |pages=506 |year=1981 |last1=Beeman |first1=William O }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A good example of branding according to cultural code is [[Disney]]'s international [[theme park]] business. Disney fits well with [[Japan]]'s cultural code because the Japanese value "cuteness", politeness, and gift giving as part of their culture code; [[Tokyo Disneyland]] sells the most souvenirs of any Disney theme park. In contrast, [[Disneyland Paris]] failed when it launched as [[Euro Disney S.C.A.|Euro Disney]] because the company did not research the codes underlying European culture. Its storybook retelling of European folktales was taken as [[Elitism|elitist]] and insulting, and the strict appearance standards that it had for employees resulted in discrimination lawsuits in France. Disney souvenirs were perceived as cheap trinkets. The park was a financial failure because its code violated the expectations of European culture in ways that were offensive.&lt;ref name="Brannen"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.5465/amr.2004.14497613 |jstor=20159073 |title=When Mickey Loses Face: Recontextualization, Semantic Fit, and the Semiotics of Foreignness |journal=Academy of Management Review |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=593–616 |year=2004 |last1=Brannen |first1=Mary Yoko }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, some researchers have suggested that it is possible to successfully pass a sign perceived as a cultural icon, such as the [[Coca-Cola]] or [[McDonald's]] [[logo]]s, from one culture to another. This may be accomplished if the sign is migrated from a more economically-developed to a less developed culture.&lt;ref name="Brannen" /&gt; The intentional association of a product with another culture has been called Foreign Consumer Culture Positioning (FCCP). Products also may be marketed using global trends or culture codes, for example, saving time in a busy world; but even these may be fine-tuned for specific cultures.&lt;ref name="Alden" /&gt;

Research also found that, as airline industry brandings grow and become more international, their logos become more symbolic and less iconic. The iconicity and symbolism of a sign depends on the cultural convention and, are on that ground in relation with each other. If the cultural convention has greater influence on the sign, the signs get more symbolic value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1470357207081002 |title=National pride, global capital: A social semiotic analysis of transnational visual branding in the airline industry |journal=Visual Communication |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=305 |year=2016 |last1=Thurlow |first1=Crispin |last2=Aiello |first2=Giorgia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gangs and graffiti==

{{Tone|section|date=March 2018}}

Graffiti is used by gang members to mark their territory and to warn off rivals. Graffiti is a great example of semiotics and the use of symbols. Police task forces are now starting to use a programming system called GARI, they upload pictures of gang symbols that they find and it helps them to decipher the meaning of the symbols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hadhazy |first1=Adam |date=September 27, 2012 |title=The Graffiti Code Breaker |journal=Discover |volume=33 |issue=7 |pages=14 |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2012/sep/25-the-graffiti-code-breaker }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gang members use semiotics and symbols for many different reasons, for example: Government-sanctioned graffiti from the city's Department of Public Works, in red, typically indicates an abandoned building, or the stylized SS stands for South Side, a faction of the 18th Street gang based in southern Indianapolis. A rival gang sprayed red Xs over the work as a sign of disrespect.&lt;ref name=Rollins&gt;Rollins, J. (2011). The lost boyz: a dark side of graffiti. Hook, Hampshire: Waterside Press.{{page needed|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''The Lost Boyz: A Dark Side of Graffiti'' by Justin Rollins&lt;ref name=Rollins/&gt; it talks about how Rollins started writing on trains at a very early age, because it helped him find himself, he was now a graffiti writer – a somebody.&lt;ref name=Rollins/&gt; This is true with a lot of symbols. People use symbols to express themselves by getting tattoos or wearing a symbol on their clothing. This helps them to feel like they belong to something or it helps them to express themselves. Gangs also use their clothing as a symbol, they do something unique for their group so that you aware of the gang you are encountering. An example could be a certain pant leg rolled up or wearing a certain color of bandana. The book also talks about how Rollins joined a graffiti gang that was called the WK which stands for Who Kares but it also had a different meaning which was Wanted Kriminals.&lt;ref name=Rollins/&gt; Many symbols in semiotics theory have different meanings; these meanings can be different from country to country or even just from person to person depending on where and how a person was raised. For example, in the United States, waving is a form of "hello" but in other cultures this could mean something offensive.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Semiotics is anything that can stand for something else.&lt;ref name=Griffin/&gt; A symbol does not stand on its own, it is a part of something, a system perhaps. Symbols in gangs are used for different things. Not just to show which gang a person is associated with but to express what has happened in their gang and in their individual lives. Gangs were first created to strengthen a certain ethnic group.&lt;ref name=Dowe&gt;Dowe, D. (2011). Gangs: Slang, Words, Symbols. Hendon Media Group, Law Enforcement Publications and Conferences. Retrieved from http://www.hendonpub.com/resources/article_archive/results/details?id=1402&lt;/ref&gt; They are very territorial. To show which territory is theirs they will mark the streets so that other gangs are aware. There are special ways to read gang signs and their tattoos: left to right, top to bottom. They may also make the tattoo or graffiti cluttered so that it is hard to read.&lt;ref name=Dowe/&gt;

Each gang has special hand signals or set of signs to identify themselves. There are some gangs who add a dot or something similar to their graffiti to stand as a phrase used in their specific gang.&lt;ref name=Dowe/&gt; Each gang is unique and has special symbols, and these symbols usually have some sort of meaning. For example, the gang called "Bloods" use the color red in their clothing to symbolize they are a part of this specific gang. They also are known to use the number 5 and have tattoos and graffiti of a five-point crown. The hand sign that they use mostly is a "b" which stands for bloods.&lt;ref name=Dowe/&gt;

Some gangs use graffiti and tattoos more than others as well as using their clothing as a symbol of their gang. Gangs will also use codes to communicate on the streets. They will oftentimes use a number that will relate to a letter of the alphabet. Depending on the gang, they may use more complex codes.&lt;ref name=Dowe/&gt;

Street gangs are known for using graffiti in their neighborhoods to mark their territory. Gangs are also using their graffiti to challenge other gangs and to disrespect them.&lt;ref name=Dowe/&gt; When they do this, they will somehow cross the other gang's symbol, and they will use their gang slang as well. They make sure to do it in a place that is clear and will leave a direct hit on the other gang.&lt;ref name=Dowe/&gt;

Semiotics and gang graffiti merge on the undercarriage of bridges, the face of billboards, on abandoned buildings, storefronts, the sides of railroad cars, and even in inconspicuous places found along dirt roads in small rural areas. The idea, is to communicate a message. A message that is part of a system.&lt;ref name=Griffin&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Griffin |editor1-first=Em |year=2014 |edition=9th |chapter=Semiotics |first1=Roland |last1=Barthes |title=A First Look at Communication Theory |pages=327–38 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=978-0-07-784245-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not uncommon for those outside the culture of gangs to judge the meaning of graffiti and its direct connection to semiotics as completely negative. This kind of graffiti was branded "Graffiti of Grief" in an article by Gabrielle Luber.&lt;ref name="Lübbers"&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=40341950 |last1=Lübbers |first1=Gabriele |year=2007 |title=The Graffiti of Grief: Violence, Death and Remembrance in Pittsburgh Gang Neighbourhoods |journal=Paideuma: Mitteilungen zur Kulturkunde |volume=53 |pages=145–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are a commemoration of mourning; a "funeral" for those who have died on the streets. The murals are often created by
members designated within the gang and the artwork is intended "provide glimpses of their lives, possessions, friends, and surroundings, and map out for us the identities of lost friends."&lt;ref name="Lübbers"/&gt; The symbols used in these murals are intentional and communicate significant meanings within the developed culture. It is an art, an expression of respect and loyalty. It is a portable headstone and is often layered (painted over) with the next memorial of death caused by street violence. In its own right, it is a historical timeline, a genealogy of grief, and it is rewritten every day with the same story and a new name. Poverty, marginalism, survival, perpetual crisis, inadequate housing, low or no job skills, poor education, and social constraints and constructs will continue to market for the consumption of lives on the streets. The symbol of grief portrayed in certain kinds of graffiti suggest a depth of meaning and a place or memorial far beyond what the eye can see. To an outsider, it may easily be interpreted without compassion.

==Main institutions==

A world organisation of semioticians, the [[International Association for Semiotic Studies]], and its journal ''[[Semiotica]]'', was established in 1969. The larger research centers together with teaching program include the semiotics departments at the [[University of Tartu]], [[Aarhus University]], and [[Bologna University]].

==In popular culture==
The discipline is mentioned in an episode of [[The Big Bang Theory]] called [[The Hamburger Postulate]].&lt;ref&gt;http://sites.psu.edu/kalelkarcas402/2015/09/14/semiotics/{{full citation needed|date=June 2018}}{{self-published inline|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tax-free shopping''' (TFS) is the buying of goods in a foreign country and obtaining a refund of the sales tax which has been collected by the retailer on those goods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/42904116/ns/travel-travel_tips/t/tax-free-shopping-surprises/ Travel Tips on msnbc.com ], Tax-free shopping surprises, Where to find tourist tax refunds outside of Europe&lt;/ref&gt; The sales tax may be variously described as a [[sales tax]], [[value added tax|goods and services tax]] (GST), [[value added tax]] (VAT), or [[consumption tax]].

Promoting tax-free shopping and making it easier for tourists to claim the refund back, has helped to attract travellers to many countries. TFS is subject to national regulations, such as minimum spend and restrictions on the types of products on which it can be claimed. Refunds can only be claimed on goods which are exported. However, buying goods tax free does not mean travellers are exempt from paying applicable taxes on their purchases when they get home.

==Tax-free shopping countries==
Fifty-five of the 130 countries that levy VAT/GST allow foreign visitors to have their taxes reimbursed.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Tax-free shopping is currently available in the following countries: Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Latvia, Lebanon, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Singapore, Slovenia, Slovakia, Spain, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States and Vietnam.

==Refund==
The refunded amount corresponds to the VAT or GST paid and in which country the traveller buys goods. VAT/GST is a tax added to the cost of a product, calculated as a percentage of the products retail price. Often in Europe, the ticket price includes VAT, this is less often the case in the US. As an example, if the VAT rate on a product is 20% and the ticket price is displayed as €100, including VAT, the VAT will be €16.67 (83.33 + 20% VAT = €100.).

A handling fee may be charged by the service provider.

==Tax-free shopping in the European Union==
Travellers resident in a country outside the EU, can shop tax-free at shops outside EU airports. The traveller pays the VAT over goods in the shop and can request a refund when leaving the European Union with the goods. General restrictions are that a traveller must be a resident in a non-EU country, has a maximum stay of 6 months when visiting the EU, purchases are made up to three months prior to export, and only goods meant for personal use are eligible for the refund. Travellers need to keep the purchase receipts and visit Customs before leaving the EU to get an export validation stamp. Receipts can then be sent back to the retailers for a refund request.

Each country in the EU has a different VAT rate which is reclaimable and a minimum purchase amount restriction.

==Tax-free shopping in the United States==
{{original research|section|date=April 2017}}
Some jurisdictions in the United States allow a refund of sales tax to foreign tourists upon leaving the country.

Tax-free shopping is a privilege enjoyed by all residents of [[United States]] jurisdictions without sales taxes, but through so-called "remote" sales—including sales to visiting out-of-state residents, sales via catalog, and sales via Internet—customers in a [[sales tax]]ed jurisdiction may also make purchases in sales tax-free jurisdictions, notwithstanding the legal requirement to pay the equivalent (compensatory) [[use tax]] in their home state. [[Delaware]] is free of all sales taxes, excluding homes and cars (3% transfer tax for real estate, and a 2.75% tag fee for cars). The [[Christiana Mall]] near [[Newark, Delaware]] attracts shoppers from the nearby states of [[Maryland]], [[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Pennsylvania]] looking to save money on purchases from not having to pay sales tax. The [[Apple Store]] at the Christiana Mall claims to sell more [[iPhone]]s than any other location in the chain due to Delaware's lack of sales tax.&lt;ref name=lat&gt;{{cite web |last=Rodriguez|first=Salvador|accessdate=November 21, 2013|title=Why an Apple store in Delaware is No. 1 in iPhone sales|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=November 14, 2013|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-apple-store-delaware-iphone-sales-20131114,0,6755659.story#axzz2lLXBvpWu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merchants in tax-free [[New Hampshire]] regularly advertise to residents of adjacent [[Massachusetts]], [[Vermont]], and [[Maine]] the benefits of purchasing goods without sales tax, ignoring the fact that there is no general exemption from the [[use tax]]es when the goods are taken back home.  Many purchasers are unaware of the obligation to pay the tax, or file the necessary return, or of the fact that it is not the duty of a merchant to collect it from them and pay it indirectly. However, it is the purchaser's obligation to pay it directly to the state, often in connection with filing their annual income tax return.

The liability of any non-exempt resident of a [[Sales taxes in the United States|US state with a sales tax]] for payment of the equivalent use tax when purchasing goods from another state (or country) through [[mail-order]], by telephone or through the [[Internet]] should not be confused with the issue of direct [[Internet taxes]] levied on Internet services themselves, such as bit taxes, bandwidth taxes, [[franchise tax]]es, and email taxes.  Most such levies are banned until 2014 by the Internet Tax Freedom Act Amendment Acts of 2007 which extends the provisions in the federal [[Internet Tax Freedom Act]] beyond its original 2007 expiration.

Goods that would be taxable at home are taxable at the same rate when taken home or delivered, regardless of where or how they were purchased.  Numerous local [[sales tax]] and [[use tax]] exemptions exist according to taxpayer status (for example, there exist exemptions for [[charitable organization]]s), exemptions based on size of purchase (e.g., clothing under $110 in Vermont), and exemptions for specific types of goods (e.g., [[protective clothing]], food, medication, and educational materials).

Even customers from jurisdictions that levy sales taxes can in theory have additional tax liabilities when shopping in neighboring no-tax or lower-tax jurisdictions.  For example, if an adjacent state has a slightly lower tax rate than the purchaser's home, that shopper could face an additional tax burden even though the purchase was already taxed at the point of sale.  The difference in tax rates is referred to by collecting authorities as "tax discount".

Taxing jurisdictions generally extend an exemption from [[use tax]] to commercial taxpayers that purchase business stock.  This type of exemption applies to goods purchased tax-free for resale, but lapses if the goods are converted to use by the company itself (for example, a company car, office supplies, and cleaning supplies).

Some countries charge a [[value added tax]] (VAT) or [[value added tax|goods and services tax]] (GST) that extends to retail purchases.  When those customers are residents of a US state having sales taxes on such goods, the VAT or GST taxes paid might be used as a credit against the amount of use tax otherwise owed, unless excluded, such as in Massachusetts.  However, when a post-travel refund of the VAT or GST is claimed, the purchaser's home taxing jurisdiction can then assert a claim for the full sales tax liability.

Despite the fact that most shoppers are unaware of their use tax obligations, there are potentially severe penalties for willful [[tax avoidance and tax evasion|tax evasion]].  Any online, telephone mail-order, or traveling shopper who makes "tax free" purchases could be successfully prosecuted for evading state [[use tax]]es if he or she willfully fails to file the necessary return and pay the required tax, or intentionally omits the information from a required annual return.  When a taxing jurisdiction enforces [[use tax]] liability, it often also seeks additional penalties and interest accrued for failure to timely remit the necessary [[wikt:tax return|tax return]] and tax payments, as well as possible [[perjury]] for omissions on official forms filed.  The [[statute of limitations]] on taxes due may not begin to run until and unless a required tax return is filed.  Some states also provide a "safe harbor" scale of use tax that is most likely owed by every taxpayer, based upon the taxpayer's adjusted gross income.  For example, someone with an income of over $100,000 could earmark 0.0005 of his or income as payment for "use tax", without having to account for any actual out-of-state purchases under $1,000 each.

To step up the opportunity for collection of [[use tax]]es, several US states have been working to implement a [[Streamlined sales tax project|"streamlined" interstate use tax]] agreement.  To effectuate this multilateral interstate compact, many states have enacted, or are considering enacting, statutory changes that require residents to disclose, under penalty of perjury, their annual [[use tax]] liability for out-of-state purchases.  The focus on use tax collection has increased because the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] has placed significant hurdles in the path of state efforts to collect sales taxes on transactions in other no-tax or lower-tax jurisdictions. In ''[[National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Department of Revenue of the State of Illinois]]'' and ''[[Quill Corp. v. North Dakota]]'', the Court concluded that the [[Commerce Clause]] and [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[U.S. Constitution]] require that there be a nexus between the taxing state and the vendor of goods or services, in the form of a physical presence.  This has been interpreted to apply to both catalog sales and out of state sales over the Internet.  States are thus prohibited from collecting sales taxes on so-called remote transactions because to do so would unconstitutionally burden interstate commerce.  The [[Streamlined sales tax project]] is the states' response, by which they are seeking to collect [[use tax]]es on remote Internet and catalog sales in lieu of sales taxes.

In connection with the [[Streamlined sales tax project]] there has been discussion among state tax officials of creating obligations or incentives for merchants to collect taxes from customers who are residents of [[sales tax]] states, especially in the area of online sales, in exchange for a remitting to the merchant a percentage of the taxes that would be otherwise unpaid.  Some US states are also considering a [[tax amnesty]], pursuant to which residents could settle unpaid [[use tax]]es and penalties at a discount, but only if the settlement is offered before collection of the tax liability commences.

==Tax-free shopping in Australia==
In [[Australia]] tax-free shopping is called the Tourist Refund Scheme (TRS) which allows overseas visitors and Australian residents to claim a refund of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and [[Wine equalisation tax]] (WET) paid on certain goods bought in Australia within 60 days of leaving Australia, and then taken out of Australia in carry-on bags or worn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.border.gov.au/Trav/Ente/Tour/Are-you-a-traveller]&lt;/ref&gt; The refund is available on goods purchased in the 60 days before leaving Australia, purchases from any single business (even on separate invoices) must total $300 (GST inclusive) or more, the traveller must have an original tax invoice for the goods, the goods may require to be verified by an officer at the Customs and Border Protection Client Services counter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.customs.gov.au/site/page4263.asp Tourist Refund Scheme]&lt;/ref&gt;

Claims for a tax refund can be made at the TRS counter in an international airport or the cruiseliner terminal of some Australian seaports.

[[File:Blake Job Evil Dreams Detail bb421 1 13-12 ps 300.jpg|thumb|300px|Plate 11 of the engravings, detail of centre image.]]
'''[[William Blake]]'s ''Illustrations of the Book of Job''''' primarily refers to a series of twenty-two [[engraving|engraved]] prints (published 1826) by Blake illustrating the biblical [[Book of Job]]. It also refers to two earlier sets of watercolours by Blake on the same subject (1806 and 1821). The engraved ''Illustrations'' are considered to be Blake's greatest masterpieces in the medium of engraving,&lt;ref&gt;Schoenherr 1997, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Essick 1980, p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; and were also a rare commercial and critical success for Blake.

==Development and printing history==
[[File:Blake 1793 Job's Tormentors.jpg|thumb|Blake's 1793 engraving for The Book of Job. This engraving, although not included in the 1826 ''Illustrations'', most closely resembles the tenth illustration, ''Job Rebuked by his Friends''.]]

===Origins===
As early as 1785 Blake had sketched several ink studies of an illustration to Job.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/work.xq?workid=but551&amp;java=yes The William Blake archive]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=1138&amp;searchid=8884 One of the ink drawings] in the collection of the [[Tate gallery]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1793 Blake engraved a composition based upon these drawings, which he offered for sale in the ''Prospectus to the Public'' for twelve shillings.&lt;ref&gt;Erdman 1988, pp. 692–3&lt;/ref&gt; This, alongside an engraving of [[Ezekiel]], are the only extant examples of an intended series of biblical illustrations that were never completed. Blake reworked the Job plate sometime after 1804, but the resulting print was not included in the ''Illustrations''.

Blake's next illustration was the tempera painting ''Job and his Daughters'' (1800), commissioned by Thomas Butts (see gallery below).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=30221 The painting], in the collection of [[The National Gallery of Art]].&lt;/ref&gt; This has similarities to plate 20 of the engraved illustrations, but it is unclear whether the print was directly based upon it.&lt;ref name="Schoenherr 1997, p. 43"&gt;Schoenherr 1997, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

===The watercolours===
The engraved illustrations to Job originated as a series of [[watercolor|watercolour]]s that Blake painted in 1805-6, also for Butts. These 19 watercolours are referred to as the ''Butts Set'' (in the collection of the [[Morgan Library &amp; Museum]]).

A second set of watercolours, known as the ''Linell Set'' (mostly in the collection of the [[Fogg Art Museum]]) was produced in 1821 at the request of [[John Linnell (painter)|John Linell]]. Linell traced the watercolours from the "Butts set"; these tracings were then coloured in by Blake. As a result of this unusual process, the outlines of the ''Linell set'' are thicker and the colouring is uniformly darker, with a more restricted palette than the ''Butts set''. Blake also added two new designs to the ''Linell set'', and added copies of these to the Butts set. The two designs added were No.s 17 and 20, ''The Vision of Christ'' and ''Job and His Daughters''.

There is also another set of watercolours known as the ''New Zealand Set''. These were initially believed to be from Blake's hand, but their authenticity has been all but refuted by scholars such as [[Martin Butlin]]&lt;ref name="Butlin NZ"&gt;Butlin 1981, pp. 409-10&lt;/ref&gt; and Bo Lindberg.&lt;ref&gt;Paley, Morton D. (Nov. 1987) Untitled review in ''The Burlington Magazine'', Vol. 129, No. 1016 , pp. 747-748&lt;/ref&gt; They are most likely copies after the engravings by someone in the circle of John Linell, as they have no unique features.&lt;ref name="Butlin NZ" /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===The engravings===
[[File:Job's Evil Dreams.jpg|thumb|upright|Plate 11, showing the marginal glosses. The line directly above the centre image reads: ''Satan himself is transformed into an Angel of Light &amp; his Ministers into Ministers of Righteousness'']]

In 1823 Linell formally commissioned Blake to engrave plates for printing. Unlike Blake's own productions in [[relief etching]], this, like other commissioned work, was produced using the [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] method of engraving. However, Blake rejected the "mixed method" popular among commercial reproductive engravers of his time. The "mixed method" entailed lightly [[etching]] guidelines into the plate. The image was then engraved by the dot and lozenge method and by [[stipple engraving|stippling]]. Instead, Blake engraved his illustrations in pure line and without preliminary etching.

The engravings were completed in 1825, and an edition of 315 was produced in 1826. These were the last set of illustrations that Blake would complete. His illustrations of Dante's ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' were left unfinished upon his death.

The completed engravings differ from Blake's original watercolours mainly in the complex marginal designs that they employ. These comment upon the text with biblical quotes and paraphrases, and also contain images that reinforce the themes of the main illustrations.

After completing the engravings, Blake painted an additional tempera of ''Satan Smiting Job with Boils'' in 1826.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=1093&amp;searchid=8903&amp;tabview=text The Painting on the website of the Tate]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
The ''Book of Job'' was an important influence upon Blake's writings and art;&lt;ref&gt;Schoenherr 1997, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Blake apparently identified with Job, as he spent his lifetime unrecognized and impoverished. [[Harold Bloom]] has interpreted Blake's most famous lyric, ''[[The Tyger]]'', as a revision of God's rhetorical questions in the Book of Job concerning Behemoth and Leviathan.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom 2006, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Blake also depicted the story of Job throughout his career as an artist. The song of Enion in Night the Second of ''[[Vala, or The Four Zoas|The Four Zoas]]'' also demonstrates that Blake identified with Job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;!--  I am hiding the following section until I can find a citation for it.

The God of Job's comforters, who claim that Job's trials are punishment for his sins, is to Blake a false god, equivalent to the [[demiurge]] of the [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]]. This was more of a distinction between [[Elohim]] (the creator) and [[Yahweh]] (the law-giver) than it was any direct influence of Gnosticism.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

For Blake, Yahweh was an imposer of laws upon a humanity that could never keep to them&amp;mdash;he appears in the 11th illustration as a cloven-hoofed apparition who menaces Job while pointing to the tablets of the [[Ten Commandments|covenant]]. In Blake's mythology he is analogous to "the Accuser of Sin", the [[Spectre (Blake)|spectre]], and [[Urizen]]. This particular print was based upon Blake's earlier monotype, ''Elohim Creating Adam''.
[[File:William Blake 008.jpg|thumb|left|''Elohim Creating Adam'', 1795, in the collection of the [[Tate Gallery]], London.]] --&gt;

===Symbolism===
Blake used symbols extensively in the illustrations; most notable is the use  of right and left limbs in the figures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=1048&amp;searchid=8884&amp;tabview=text Analysis] of ''Job's Sons and Daughters Overwhelmed by Satan'' from the website of the [[Tate gallery]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Damon 1966, p. 3. Damon attributes the origin of this observation to Joseph Wickstead's ''Blake's Vision of the Book of Job'', 1924.&lt;/ref&gt; The right limb represents the spiritual and the good; the left, the material and evil. In plate six, [[Satan]] smites Job with boils using his left hand, and in plate 15 God indicates Behemoth and Leviathan with his left hand. Contrarily, God banishes Satan with his right hand in plate sixteen and speaks to Job from the whirlwind in plate fourteen with his right foot extended forward. Some scholars, however, have asserted that this systematic interpretation fails to account for inconsistencies in such symbolism and is excessively subjective.&lt;ref&gt;[[W.J.T. Mitchell|Mitchell, W.J.T.]] "Blake's Composite Art" in ''William Blake'' from Bloom's BioCritiques, ed [[Harold Bloom]]. Chelsea House Publishers, 2006. p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hebrew incorporated in the Butts watercolor ''Job's Evil Dreams'' and in the engravings ''title'' plate and plate numbered 2 ''Hast thou considered my Servant Job'' is analyzed in 'Blake's Hebrew Calligraphy.' &lt;ref&gt;Abraham Samuel Shiff "Blake's Hebrew Calligraphy" ''Blake An Illustrated Quarterly'', vol. 46, no. 2 (Fall 2012)[http://blake.lib.rochester.edu/blakeojs/index.php/blake/article/view/shiff462]&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme of an Orthodox Jewish ritual used in the composition of plate numbered 17 ''I have heard thee with the hearing of the Ear but now my Eye seeth thee'' is explained in 'Blake's Priestly Blessing: God Blesses Job.' &lt;ref&gt;Abraham Samuel Shiff "Blake's Priestly Blessing: God Blesses Job" ''Blake An Illustrated Quarterly'', vol. 47, no. 3 (winter 2013-14)[http://blake.lib.rochester.edu/blakeojs/index.php/blake/article/view/shiff473/shiff473]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artistic influences===
[[File:Behemoth.jpg|thumb|Detail of watercolour illustrating [[Behemoth]] and [[Leviathan]], upon which plate 15 of the engravings was based.]]
From early in his artistic career, Blake collected the prints of [[Albrecht Dürer]]. The depiction of Behemoth in plate 15 of the engravings is believed to have been influenced by ''[[Dürer's Rhinoceros]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Essick 1980, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Public Address'' (possibly from 1810&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/erdman.html Electronic version of Erdman's ''Complete Poetry and Prose''], click '''textual notes''' and then '''Public Address''' for information.&lt;/ref&gt;), Blake also indicates "Marc Antonio" ([[Marcantonio Raimondi]]), as an artist who inspired his linear technique of engraving.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english.uga.edu/nhilton/Blake/blaketxt1/public_address.html Ibid.] posted on the University of Georgia's website&lt;/ref&gt; "Julio Romano" ([[Giulio Romano]]), [[Raphael]], and [[Michelangelo]] are also mentioned by Blake in this address.

==Critical reception and legacy==
Of the edition of 315, only 20 copies of the illustrations were sold in Blake's lifetime, mostly to people within Blake's [[Ancients (art group)|immediate circle]] (such as [[Samuel Palmer]]). However, the ''Illustrations'' brought Blake an unprecedented degree of recognition. The [[Royal Academy]] and the [[King's Library]] each bought a copy; the former also awarded Blake £25. Such notables as [[John Constable]] and [[Lady Caroline Lamb]] invited him to dine, and the collector Charles Alders introduced him to [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yel1AU0YlGsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;client=safari#PPA33,M1 ''The Cambridge Companion to William Blake''], on Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Illustrations'' also gained critical acknowledgment after Blake's death more quickly than his [[William Blake's prophetic books|prophetic books]]. As early as 1857 [[John Ruskin]] wrote of Blake in ''The Elements of Drawing'' that &lt;blockquote&gt;The ''Book of Job'', engraved by himself, is of the highest rank in certain characters of imagination and expression; in the mode of obtaining certain effects of light it will also prove a very useful example to you. In expressing conditions of glaring and flickering light, Blake is greater than Rembrandt.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nEg8ULbzEJcC&amp;pg=PA223&amp;dq=Blake+is+greater+than+rembrandt#PPA223,M1 ''The Elements of Drawing'' in ''The Works of John Ruskin'', ed. Edward Tyas Cook, on Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The triple-mirror design in the background of plate 20, ''Job and his Daughters'', is believed to have influenced [[William Holman Hunt]]'s use of the same motif in his painting ''The Lady of Shalott''; Blake was highly regarded by the [[Pre-Raphaelites]].&lt;ref name="Schoenherr 1997, p. 43"/&gt;

[[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] based his ballet ''[[Job: A Masque for Dancing]]'' (first staged in 1931) upon the ''Illustrations''.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Table of Illustrations==
Blake did not give titles to the illustrations and the most prominent text in the margins is used by some scholars (such as [[S. Foster Damon]]) as a title for a given illustration. Others, such as Robert Essick, use descriptive titles.&lt;ref&gt;The titles based upon biblical verses are from Foster's ''Blake's Job'', and the descriptive titles are from the [http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/copy.xq?copyid=bb421.1&amp;java=yes William Blake Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, both are given here. In some cases the titles are the same.

Note that Blake's marginal texts are paraphrases of biblical passages and so will not be exactly identical to the linked verse.

According to the 2011 [[Human Development Report]] of the [[United Nations]] Development Program, approximately twice as many males as females receive a secondary education in [[Pakistan]], and public expenditures on education amount to only 2.7% of the [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] of the country.&lt;ref name=UNDP-Pak-2011&gt;[http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/PAK.html UNDP, Human Development Report (2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender roles in Pakistan==
{{See also|Women in Pakistan|Women's rights in Pakistan}}
Patriarchal values heavily govern the social structure in Pakistani society in the rural areas. In comparison, urban centers of the country as well as semi-peripheral regions are slowly moving towards shifting gender roles that are more inclusive. Around 70% of working women in Pakistan work outdoors according to the [[Asian Development Bank]] policy brief on female workforce participation in Pakistan 2016. The general perception of culturally traditional gender roles that, specifically, a woman is expected to take care of the home as wife and mother, whereas the male dominates outside the home as a breadwinner, are questionable in certain sectors. In agricultural work, within rural areas, both men and women work in the fields and are expected to contribute equally to household work. In a survey by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics 2013-2014, it was reported that 26% of women are in the labor force ( approximately 15 million). There is a traditionally conceptual idea of segregation of men and women into two distinct worlds. However, this materializes differently in different parts of the country. Only in the most of rural-isolated regions in the country  is this idea of gender roles strictly followed. Poverty is one of the major factors in unequal household resources allocation in the favor of sons due to their role in society outside the home. Therefore, education for boys is prioritized over girls, because it is perceived that boys must be equipped with educational skills to compete for resources in the public arena; while girls have to specialize in domestic skills to be good mothers and wives. Hence, education is not perceived as being important for girls.

This gender [[division of labor]] has been internalized by the society, and girls do not have many choices for themselves that could change these patriarchal realities of their lives. Society does not allow girls to develop their human [[Capability approach|capabilities]] by precluding them from acquiring education. Lack of emphasis on the importance of women's education is one of the cardinal features of [[gender inequality]] in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhry, I. &amp; Rahman, S. (2009). "The Impact of Gender Inequality in Education on Rural Poverty in Pakistan: An Empirical Analysis". ''European Journal of Economics, Finance and Administrative Sciences'', Issue 15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Human Development Report (HDR) listed Pakistan in the category of "low [[Human development (humanity)|human development]]" countries with a female [[literacy]] rate of thirty percent, and Pakistan has ranked 145 in the world in terms of human development.&lt;ref name=UNDP-Pak-2011/&gt;

===Importance of women's education===
Education has been of central significance to the development of human society. It can be the beginning, not only of individual knowledge, information and awareness, but also a holistic strategy for development and change.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Noureen, G. &amp; Dr. Awan, R. (2011). "Women's Education in Pakistan:Hidden Fences on Open Frontiers". ''Asian Social Science'', Vol. 7, No. 2; 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Education is very much connected to women's ability to form social relationships on the basis of equality with others and to achieve the important social good of self-respect. It is important, as well, to [[Economic mobility|mobility]] (through access to jobs and the political process) and to health and life (through the connection to bodily integrity). Education can allow women to participate in politics so they can ensure that their voices and concerns are heard and addressed in the public policy. It is also crucial for women's access to the legal system.&lt;ref name="Nussbaum, M. 2003"&gt;Nussbaum, M. (2003). ''Women's Education: A Global Challenge''. University of Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it must be considered that religion and traditions of the Pakistani affect women's education. Some women may choose to keep the traditional roles because that is what they have always known and are used to. It would be a great opportunity if women were able to make their choice on their own, though. They should at least have the knowledge of both sides to be educated or to stay with the traditional ways.

Education is a critical input in [[Training and development|human resource development]] and essential for the country's economic growth. It increases the [[productivity]] and efficiency of individuals, and it produces a skilled labor force that is capable of leading the economy towards sustainable growth and prosperity. The progress and wellbeing of a country largely depends on the education choices made available to its people. It can be one of the most powerful instruments of change. It can help a country to achieve its national goals via producing minds imbued with knowledge, skills, and competencies to shape its future destiny. The widespread recognition of this fact has created awareness on the need to focus upon literacy and elementary education, not simply as a matter of [[social justice]] but more to foster economic growth, social well-being, and social stability.&lt;ref&gt;Mishra R. C. (2005). ''Women Education''. New Delhi: A.P.H. Publishing Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt; Women's education is so inextricably linked with the other facets of human development that to make it a priority is to also make change on a range of other fronts; from the health and status of women to early childhood care; from nutrition, water and sanitation to community empowerment; from the reduction of [[child labour|child labor]] and other forms of exploitation to the peaceful resolution of conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;Goel, A. (2004). ''Education and Socio-Economic Perspectives of Women Development and Empowerment''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic benefits of women's education===
{{See also|Women's education and development}}
Apart from the acquisition of knowledge and values conductive to social evolution, education also enables development of mind, training in logical and analytical thinking. It allows an individual to acquire organizational, managerial, and administrative skills. Moreover, enhanced self-esteem and improved social and financial status within a community is a direct outcome of education. Therefore, by promoting education among women, Pakistan can achieve social and human development, and gender equality. A large number of empirical studies have revealed that increase in women's education boosts their wages and that returns to education for women are frequently larger than that of men. Increase in the level of [[female education]] improves human development outcomes such as child survival, health and schooling.&lt;ref&gt;Klasen, S. and Lamanna, F. (2008), ''The Impact of Gender Inequality in Education and Employment on Economic Growth in Development Countries: Updates and Extensions''.&lt;/ref&gt; Lower female education has a negative impact on economic growth as it lowers the average level of human capital.&lt;ref&gt;Klasen, Stephan (1999). "Does Gender Inequality Reduce Growth and development? Evidence from Cross-Country Regressions", Policy Research Report On Gender and Development Working Paper Series, No. 7. Development Research Group /PREMN, the World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt; Developmental Economists argue that in developing countries female education reduces fertility, infant mortality and increases children's education.&lt;ref&gt;Knowles, Stephen, Paula K. Lorgelly, and P. Dorian Owen (2002) "Are Educational Gender Gaps a Brake on Economic Development? Some Cross-Country Empirical Evidence", ''Oxford Economic Papers'', 54(1): 118–149.&lt;/ref&gt; Gender inequality in education directly and significantly affects [[economic growth]]. Empirical studies done by using regression analysis reveal the fact that the overall [[literacy rate]], enrollment ratio, ratio of literate female to male have positive and significant impact on economic growth.&lt;ref name="Chaudhry, I.S. 2007"&gt;Chaudhry, I.S. (2007), "Impact of Gender Inequality in Education on Economic Growth: An Empirical Evidence from Pakistan", ''The Pakistan Horizon'' Vol. 60, No. 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Chaudhry (2007) investigated the impact of gender inequality in education on economic growth in Pakistan. The secondary source of time series data drawn from various issues has been used. In his regression analysis, he estimated a set of regressions showing a moderate explanatory power. The variables, overall literacy rate, enrollment ratio, ratio of literate female to male have positive and significant impact on economic growth. It was found that gender inequality in initial education reduces economic growth.&lt;ref name="Chaudhry, I.S. 2007"/&gt;
In another empirical study, Chaudhry (2009) investigated factors affecting rural poverty in Southern Punjab (Pakistan), and he concluded that alleviation of poverty is possible by lowering the household size and dependency ratio, improving education, increasing female labor participation. He employed Logit regression models and used primary source of data from the project area of Asian Development Bank for estimation. Results indicate that as dependency level and household size increase the probability of being poor increases too. Education has the significant inverse relationship with poverty because it provides employment opportunities and rejects poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhry, I.S. (2009), "Poverty Alleviation in Southern Punjab (Pakistan): An Empirical Evidence from the Project Area of Asian Development Bank", ''International Research journal of Finance and Economics'', issue 23, (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; The inclusion of trained and education women workforce will not only ensure women's welfare, it will also increase the overall productivity of the workforce due to more competitiveness. Hence, the developmental and feminist economists argue that it is desirable for the government to allocate more resources towards women's education, as it is going to benefit the whole society.

==Gender disparity in education in Pakistan==

According to [[UNDP]] 2010 report, Pakistan ranked 120 in 146 countries in terms of [[Gender-related Development Index]] (GDI), and in terms of [[Gender Empowerment Measure]]ment (GEM) ranking, it ranked 92 in 94 countries.&lt;ref&gt;UNDP (2010), "Statement on Gender in Pakistan".&lt;/ref&gt; Gender inequality in education can be measured in different ways. Gross and net enrollment rates and completion and drop-out rates are the ways to identify the gender inequality in education. Pakistan aims to achieve [[Millennium Development Goals]] and also aims to eliminate gender disparity at all levels of education by the year 2015.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations, UNDP. http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/.&lt;/ref&gt; Elimination of gender disparity at all levels of education requires higher allocation of resources on women's education. Strong gender disparities exist in literacy and educational attainment between rural and urban areas of Pakistan.

===Socio-economic hurdles===

[[Patriarchal]] values are deeply embedded in the society of Pakistan, and its different manifestations are observed in different aspects of the society. As mentioned above, gender division of labour enforces women to primarily specialize in unpaid care work as mothers and wives at home, whereas men perform paid work, and come out as breadwinners. This has led to a low level of resource investment in girls' education not only by their families but also by the state. This low investment in women's [[human capital]], compounded by negative social biases and cultural practices, restrictions on women's mobility and the internalization of [[patriarchy]] by women themselves, becomes the basis for [[gender discrimination]] and disparities in most spheres of life. Some of the ramifications are that women are unable to develop job-market skills, hence, they have limited opportunities available to them in the wage-labour market. Moreover, social and cultural restrictions limit women's chances to compete for resources in a world outside the four walls of their homes. It translates into social and economic dependency of women on men. The nature and degree of women's oppression and subordination vary across classes, regions and the rural and urban divide in Pakistan. It has been observed that male dominant structures are relatively more marked in the rural and tribal setting where local customs and indigenous laws establish stronger male authority and power over women.&lt;ref name="Khan, S 2007"&gt;Khan, S (2007). "Gender Issues in higher education in Pakistan". ''Bulletin'', Issue 162, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insurgency hurdles===
Destruction of schools and killings have harmed women's education in Pakistan. 16-year-old education activist and blogger [[Malala Yousafzai]] was shot in the head and neck by [[Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan|Taliban]] insurgents 9 October 2012 after she had blogged about the destruction of schools and closing of all-girls schools in her town of [[Mingora]] in the [[Swat District]]. Later, the Taliban denied that it opposes education and claimed "Malala was targeted because of her pioneer role in preaching [[secularism]] and so-called enlightened moderation."&lt;ref name=shot/&gt;

In September 2012 the Pakistani newspaper ''[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]'' reported that 710 schools have been destroyed or damaged by militants in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] and 401 schools have been destroyed or damaged in Swat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dawn.com/2012/09/12/militancy-keeps-600000-kp-children-out-of-school/ Militancy keeps 600,000 KP children out of school] 12 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; While the Taliban's campaign extends beyond girls to secular education in general,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/oct/26/world/la-fg-pakistan-education-taliban-20121027 |title=Taliban's attack on Pakistan education goes beyond one girl |date=26 October 2012 |author=Alex Rodriguez |newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; at least one source reports the damage was related to Taliban opposition to girls' education.&lt;ref name=shot&gt;[http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/magazine/108847/why-the-taliban-shot-the-schoolgirl Why the Taliban Shot the Schoolgirl]| Leon Wieseltier| October 19, 2012 | accessed 12.11.212&lt;/ref&gt; Another source includes the bombing of girls' schools as among the Taliban policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latitude.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/25/malala-yousafzai-isnt-the-only-vulnerable-resident-of-swat/ |title=In the Taliban's sights |author=Huma Yusuf |publisher=The New York Times |date=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rural vs. urban===

In year 2006, the literacy rate in urban areas was recorded as 58.3% while in rural areas it was 28.3%, and only 12% among rural women.&lt;ref name="FBS"&gt;Federal Bureau of Statistics/Ministry of Education, Pakistan.&lt;/ref&gt; An interesting factor in this context is that female enrollment was recorded highest at the primary level, but it progressively decreases at the secondary, college and tertiary levels. It was estimated that less than 3% of the 17–23 age group of girls have access to higher education.&lt;ref name=moe&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111018072054/http://www.moe.gov.pk/Pakistan%20Education%20Statistics-2005-2006T1.pdf Pakistan Education Statistics (Summary) 2005-06], Government of Pakistan.&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of women who attend school in urban areas vs. rural areas differs drastically.  In urban areas, women's education is increasing every day. The parents of girls who live in urban areas are a lot more accepting of their enrolling in school and even encourage girls to pursue a career as they are also a lot more knowledgeable of their rights. This makes them a lot more motivated to stand up for their education. Parent in urban areas are a lot more modernized or westernized. These urban parents acknowledge the importance of an education. Women who live in urban areas are often enrolled in private schools getting a better education there as they have a lot more educational accessibility. Women in urban areas are also surrounded by people who are educated and are not put down or beaten for going to school. Unlike in urban areas, women in rural areas are discouraged to attend school. Most of them are brought up in conservative families with little to no education. They have to work harder than women in urban areas because they have little support system. If their parents are accepting of education they still cannot go since most of them are very poor and cannot afford the expense. The women also do not attend school in rural areas of Pakistan because it is not culturally accepted. These conservative families tend to be more traditional expecting women to stay at home and attend the house while men go out to work. They’re also restricted in rural areas because their town may not even have a school, therefore having to travel a long distance to attend one.

==Statistics==
The latest official statistics on enrollment that are provided by the Ministry of Education of Pakistan are of year 2005–2006. The statistics can be divided into two categories, public schools and private schools.&lt;ref name=moe/&gt;

===Pre-primary===

;Public sector
According to the government of [[Pakistan]], total enrollment level of pre-primary in public sector was 4,391,144. Out of 4,391,144 pre-primary students, 2,440,838 are boys, and 1,950,306 are girls. It shows that 56% of enrolled students are boys, and 44% are girls. Further breakdown of these statistics into urban and rural enrollment levels reveals almost similar percentage of enrollment among boys and girls, i.e. in rural schools 57% are boys and 43% are girls.

Private sector;
There is a huge sector of private education in Pakistan. According to the government of Pakistan, 2,744,303 pre-primary students are enrolled in private schools. Among them, 1,508,643 are boys, and 1,235,660 are girls. It shows that 55% of enrolled kids are boys and 45% are girls. Of the total number, 39% students are in rural areas, and the percentage of enrolled boys and girls in rural areas are 58% and 42% respectively.

===Primary education===
Primary education is compulsory for every child in Pakistan, but due to culture, poverty, and child labour, Pakistan has been unable to achieve 100% enrollment at the primary level.

;Public sector
The total enrollment in primary public sector is 11,840,719; 57% (6,776,536) are boys, and 43% (5,064,183) are girls. 79% of all the primary students in Pakistan are enrolled in rural schools, and the gender enrollment ratios are 59% and 41% for boys and girls respectively in rural Pakistan.

;Private sector
The private schools are mostly located in urban centers, and the total enrollment in private primary schools was 4,993,698.

===Middle school level===

The enrollment level falls dramatically from primary to middle school level in Pakistan. These statistics can be very helpful in comprehending the problems faced by Pakistan in its educational sector.

;Public sector
3,642,693 students are enrolled in public middle schools; 61% (2,217,851) are boys, and 39% (1,424,842) are girls. Of the total enrollment, 62% students are in rural areas, and the enrollment of girls are much lower in rural middle schools vis-à-vis urban schools. In rural schools, 66% enrolled students are boys and 34% are girls.

;Private sector
The enrollment in private schools declines sharply after primary level, as the cost of attendance in private schools increases and the majority of the population cannot afford private education in Pakistan. The total number of students enrolled in private schools at middle level is 1,619,630. Of the total level of enrollment in private schools, 66% students are in urban schools. Hence, the ratio of boys and girls is relatively balanced with 54% boys and 46% girls.

===High school level===
In Pakistan grades 8 to 10 constitute high school education.

;Public sector
The total number of students enrolled in public high schools is 1,500,749. The 61% of students are boys and 39% are girls. Overall enrollment decreases sharply at high school level.  A very disproportionate gender ratio is observed in rural high schools, only 28% of the enrolled students are girls, and 72% are boys.

;Private sector
632,259 students are enrolled in private high schools. Most of them are in urban centers. The ratio of boys and girls enrollment is 53% and 47% respectively.

===Higher secondary===
The overall ratio seems to equalize among boys and girls in higher secondary education.

;Public sector
There are 699,463 students enrolled in higher secondary education in public institutions. There is almost 50% boys and girls enrollment in higher secondary education. But there is a discrepancy between urban and rural enrollments. Only 16% of the students from the total number are from rural areas, and only 28% are female students. While in urban centers, 55% students are female students.

;Private sector
154,072 students are enrolled in private higher secondary institutions, with 51% boys and 49% girls.

===Degree level education===
Female students outnumber their male counterparts in degree level education.

;Public sector
There are only 296,832 students enrolled in degree level education in public sector institutions, and 62% of them are female while 38% are male. Very few (less than 1%) students are in rural institutions.

;Private sector
29,161 students are enrolled in private sector institutions; 4% are female, mostly in urban city centers.

===Summary of statistics===

These statistics shed some interesting facts about education in Pakistan; the gender disparity in education is much lower in urban places vis-à-vis rural areas. One of the possible explanations of this pattern is relatively stronger dominance of tribal, feudal and patriarchal traditions in rural areas. Moreover, there are very few employment opportunities for women in rural areas, and thus, there is very little financial incentive for families to send their girls to schools. However, despite the meagre representation of females in the education sector, the level of achievement of female students is consistently far higher than that of their counterpart male students. Girls generally outclass boys in examination, and they are also higher achievers in universities. Unfortunately, the majority of the girls never get an opportunity to develop their educational capabilities.&lt;ref name="Khan, S 2007"/&gt;

==Role of government in women's education==

Officially the government of Pakistan is committed to provide every citizen an access to education, but critics say that its budget allocation towards education does not correspond with its former commitment. The expenditure on education as a percentage of [[GDP]] was 1.82% in 2000–2001, while it has been raised slightly in 2006–2007 to 2.42%, and it is still relatively lower than most neighboring countries.&lt;ref name="FBS"/&gt; Feminist economists argue that the government of Pakistan needs to fully address and resolve the gender concerns that exist in the educational sector. They suggest that one of the ways to improve this situation is by increasing funding for women's education, encourage and financially incentivize people in the rural areas to send their girls to schools.&lt;ref name="Khan, S 2007"/&gt; In the apprentice of gender studies, the gender division of labor is considered patriarchal, and feminists argue that it can be consciously neutralized by the public policies, i.e. encouraging girls to study mathematics, science, computers, and business administration etc. This way, girls will specialize in higher paying fields (jobs) instead of solely focusing on care work.&lt;ref name="Nussbaum, M. 2003"/&gt;

==Role of parents==

In 2016, parents seized the initiative by sending their daughters to what has become a co-education school in Mangar Kota, [[Swat District|Swat]]. The village has only one primary school for girls, with just one teacher. The nearest secondary school is 12 kilometres away. The only way for girls to continue their education was to attend a boys school. Inspired by [[Malala Yousafzai]] the parents of 8 girls have enrolled their daughters in a boys school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/news/1262742/no-girls-school-no-problem-these-villagers-want-their-daughters-to-study-with-boys Dawn 6 June 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conclusion==

Statistics show that education in Pakistan can be characterized by extensive gender inequalities. Girls/women have to face socio-cultural hurdles to acquire education. International community has developed a consensus through the [[Millennium Development Goals]] to eliminate gender inequality from education.&lt;ref&gt;Millennium Development Goals, UNDP, http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/education.shtml.&lt;/ref&gt; The proponents of gender equality argue that it is not only humane and ethical thing to provide everyone easy access to education without any gender bias, but it is also essential for development and progress of a society that both men and women are educated. They also point towards empirical studies that have confirmed that gender inequality in education has significant impact on rural poverty in Pakistan, and female literacy is important for poverty alleviation. Feminists like Martha Nussbaum are arguing that there is an immediate need to increase the public expenditures on female education in order to achieve gender equality at all levels.&lt;ref name="Nussbaum, M. 2003"/&gt;
