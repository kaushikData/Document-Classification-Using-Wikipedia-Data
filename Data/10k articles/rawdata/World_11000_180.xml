The '''All People Front''' ({{lang-el|Παλλαϊκό Μέτωπο}}) was an electoral coalition formed between the [[Communist Party of Greece]], the [[Common Front of Workers, Farmers and Professionals]] and the [[United Front of Workers and Peasants]]. It participated in the [[Greek legislative election, 1935|elections of 1935]] as '''Communists and Allies''' and took 9,59% without electing any MPs.

Before the [[Greek legislative election, 1936|elections of 1936]], the [[Agricultural Party of Greece]] and several independent left-wing personalities entered the coalition in order to contest the [[Greek legislative election, 1936|1936 Greek legislative election]]. The All People Front took 5.76% of the vote and won 15 seats.

At the height of the city's prominence, it served as a major hub of trade, with trading stations extending throughout the region.

For much of its history, Carthage was on hostile terms with the [[Magna Graecia|Greeks in Sicily]] and with the [[Roman Republic]]; tensions led to a series of armed conflicts known as the [[Sicilian Wars]] ({{circa|lk=no|600}}–265 BC) and the [[Punic Wars]] (264–146 BC) respectively.

==History==
===Foundation legends===
[[File:Ruines de Carthage.jpg|thumb|Carthage]]
According to Roman sources, Phoenician colonists from modern-day [[Lebanon]], led by [[Dido]] (also known as Queen Elissa), founded Carthage ''circa'' 814 BC.&lt;ref name="Moscati2001654"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sabatino Moscati|title=The Phoenicians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1EEtmT9Tbj4C&amp;pg=PA654|date=January 2001|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-85043-533-4|page=654}}&lt;/ref&gt; Queen Elissa (also known as "Alissar") was an exiled princess of the ancient Phoenician city of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]. At its peak, the metropolis she founded, Carthage, came to be called the "shining city",{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} ruling 300 other cities around the western [[Mediterranean Sea]] and leading the Phoenician world.

Elissa's brother, [[Pygmalion of Tyre]], had murdered Elissa's husband, the high priest. Elissa escaped the tyranny of her own country, founding the "new city" of Carthage and subsequently its later dominions. Details of her life are sketchy and confusing, but the following can be deduced from various sources. According to [[Justin (historian)|Justin]], Princess Elissa was the daughter of King Belus II of Tyre. When he died, the throne was jointly bequeathed to her brother, Pygmalion, and her. She married her uncle [[Acerbas]], also known as Sychaeus, the High Priest of [[Melqart]], a man with both authority and wealth comparable to the king. This led to [[Political science of religion|increased rivalry between the religious elite and the monarchy]]. Pygmalion was a tyrant, lover of both gold and intrigue, who desired the authority and fortune enjoyed by Acerbas.&lt;ref name="Aubet2001215"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maria Eugenia Aubet|title=The Phoenicians and the West: Politics, Colonies and Trade|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B7SLWT2vpNcC&amp;pg=PA215|date=6 September 2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-79543-2|page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pygmalion assassinated Acerbas in the temple and kept the misdeed concealed from his sister for a long time, deceiving her with lies about her husband's death. At the same time, the people of Tyre called for a single sovereign.

In the Roman epic of Virgil, the ''[[Aeneid]]'', Queen Dido, the Greek name for Elissa, is first introduced as a highly esteemed character. In just seven years, since their exodus from Tyre, the Carthaginians have rebuilt a successful kingdom under her rule. Her subjects adore her and present her with a festival of praise. Her character is perceived by Virgil as even more noble when she offers asylum to [[Aeneas]] and his men, who have recently escaped from [[Troy]]. A spirit in the form of the messenger god, [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], sent by [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], reminds Aeneas that his mission is not to stay in Carthage with his new-found love, Dido, but to sail to Italy to found Rome. Virgil ends his legend of Dido with the story that, when Aeneas tells Dido, her heart broken, she orders a [[pyre]] to be built where she falls upon Aeneas' sword. As she lay dying, she predicted eternal strife between Aeneas' people and her own: "rise up from my bones, avenging spirit" (4.625, trans. Fitzgerald) she says, an invocation of [[Hannibal]]. The details of Virgil's story do not, however, form part of the original legend and are significant mainly as an indication of Rome's attitude towards the city she had founded, exemplified by [[Cato the Elder]]'s much-repeated utterance, "''[[Carthago delenda est]]''", "Carthage must be destroyed".&lt;ref&gt;Carthage and the Carthaginians, R Bosworth Smithp16&lt;/ref&gt;

He captured the smaller cities of Selinus (modern [[Selinunte]]) and [[Himera]] before returning triumphantly to Carthage with the spoils of war. But the primary enemy, Syracuse, remained untouched and, in 405 BC, Hannibal Mago led a second Carthaginian expedition to claim the entire island.

The fighting in Sicily swung in favor of Carthage in 387 BC. After winning a naval battle off the coast of Catania, Himilco laid siege to Syracuse with 50,000 Carthaginians, but yet another epidemic struck down thousands of them.

Sicily by this time had become an obsession for Carthage. Over the next fifty years, Carthaginian and Greek forces engaged in a constant series of skirmishes. By 340 BC, Carthage had been pushed entirely into the southwest corner of the island, and an uneasy peace reigned over the island.

In 315 BC, [[Agathocles of Syracuse|Agathocles]], the tyrant (administrating governor) of Syracuse, seized the city of [[Messene]] (present-day Messina). In 311 BC he invaded the last Carthaginian holdings on Sicily, breaking the terms of the current peace treaty,&lt;ref name="Ray2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fred Eugene Ray|title=Greek and Macedonian Land Battles of the 4th Century B.C.: A History and Analysis of 187 Engagements|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AUyzyRyBvxsC|accessdate=12 February 2013|year=2012|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-1-4766-0006-2|pages=195–197}}&lt;/ref&gt; and laid siege to [[Agrigentum|Akragas]].

[[Hamilcar]], grandson of [[Hanno the Great]], led the Carthaginian response and met with tremendous success. By 310 BC, he controlled almost all of Sicily and had laid siege to Syracuse itself. In desperation, Agathocles secretly led an expedition of 14,000 men to the mainland,&lt;ref name="Finley1979"&gt;{{cite book|author=Moses I.

In this, he was successful: Carthage was forced to recall Hamilcar and most of his army from Sicily to face the new and unexpected threat. Although Agathocles's army was eventually defeated in 307 BC, Agathocles himself escaped back to Sicily and was able to negotiate a peace which maintained Syracuse as a stronghold of Greek power in Sicily.

===Pyrrhic War===
{{main article|Pyrrhic War}}
[[File:Romtrireme.jpg|thumb|Roman [[trireme]] on a mosaic in the [[Bardo National Museum|Bardo Museum]], Tunisia]]

Between 280 and 275 BC, [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]] waged two major campaigns in the western Mediterranean: one against the emerging power of the [[Roman Republic]] in southern Italy, the other against Carthage in Sicily.&lt;ref name="Richard2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carl J.

Pyrrhus sent an advance guard to Tarentum under the command of Cineaus with 3,000 [[infantry]]. Pyrrhus marched the main army across the Greek peninsula and engaged in battles with the Thessalians and the Athenian army. After his early success on the march Pyrrhus entered Tarentum to rejoin with his advance guard.

In the midst of Pyrrhus's Italian campaigns, he received envoys from the Sicilian cities of [[Agrigentum]], [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], and [[Leontini]], asking for military aid to remove the Carthaginian dominance over that island.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Pyrrhus'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pyrrhus*.html#22 22:1–22:3]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoyos2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter Ameling|editor=Dexter Hoyos|title=A Companion to the Punic Wars|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DeHoLjPOtTUC|accessdate=12 February 2013|date=13 January 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-9370-5|chapter=3 The Rise of Carthage to 264 BC&amp;nbsp;— Part I}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Pyrrhus agreed, and fortified the Sicilian cities with an army of 20,000 [[infantry]] and 3,000 [[cavalry]]&lt;ref name="Cowan2007"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ross Cowan|title=For the Glory of Rome: A History of Warriors and Warfare|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PZR_GNJjJioC|accessdate=1 March 2013|date=1 June 2007|publisher=MBI Publishing Company|isbn=978-1-85367-733-5|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 20 war elephants,&lt;ref name="KistlerLair2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John M.

Initially, Pyrrhus's Sicilian campaign against Carthage was a success, pushing back the Carthaginian forces, and capturing the city-fortress of [[Erice|Eryx]], even though he was not able to capture [[Lilybaeum]].&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Pyrrhus'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pyrrhus*.html#22 22:4–22:6]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following these losses, Carthage sued for peace, but Pyrrhus refused unless Carthage was willing to renounce its claims on Sicily entirely. According to [[Plutarch]], Pyrrhus set his sights on conquering Carthage itself, and to this end, began outfitting an expedition. However, his ruthless treatment of the Sicilian cities in his preparations for this expedition, and his execution of two Sicilian rulers whom he claimed were plotting against him led to such a rise in animosity towards the Greeks, that Pyrrhus withdrew from Sicily and returned to deal with events occurring in southern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Pyrrhus'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pyrrhus*.html#23 Chapter 23]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tucker2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Spencer C.

Pyrrhus's campaigns in Italy were inconclusive, and Pyrrhus eventually withdrew to Epirus. For Carthage, this meant a return to the status quo. For Rome, however, the failure of Pyrrhus to defend the colonies of ''[[Magna Graecia]]'' meant that Rome absorbed them into its "[[sphere of influence]]", bringing it closer to complete domination of the Italian peninsula. Rome's domination of Italy, and proof that Rome could pit its military strength successfully against major international powers, would pave the way to the future Rome-Carthage conflicts of the [[Punic Wars]].

When Agathocles died in 288 BC, a large company of Italian mercenaries who had previously been held in his service found themselves suddenly without employment. Rather than leave Sicily, they seized the city of Messana. Naming themselves [[Mamertines]] (or "sons of Mars"), they became a law unto themselves, terrorizing the surrounding countryside.&lt;ref name="Bagnall2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nigel Bagnall|title=The Punic Wars: Rome, Carthage and the Struggle for the Mediterranean|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W9u9mCSV4AgC|accessdate=25 February 2013|date=4 September 2008|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4090-2253-4|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mamertines became a growing threat to Carthage and Syracuse alike. In 265 BC, [[Hiero II of Syracuse|Hiero II]], former general of Pyrrhus and the new tyrant of Syracuse, took action against them.&lt;ref name="Hoyos2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=B. Dexter Hoyos|title=Truceless War: Carthage's Fight for Survival, 241 to 237|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ln7kyVlArk0C|accessdate=25 February 2013|year=2007|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-16076-7|page=xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with a vastly superior force, the Mamertines divided into two factions, one advocating surrender to Carthage, the other preferring to seek aid from Rome. While the [[Roman Senate]] debated the best course of action, the Carthaginians eagerly agreed to send a garrison to Messana. A Carthaginian garrison was admitted to the city, and a Carthaginian fleet sailed into the Messanan harbor. However, soon afterwards they began negotiating with Hiero. Alarmed, the Mamertines sent another embassy to Rome asking them to expel the Carthaginians.

Hiero's intervention had placed Carthage's military forces directly across the narrow channel of water that separated Sicily from Italy. Moreover, the presence of the Carthaginian fleet gave them effective control over this channel, the [[Strait of Messina]], and demonstrated a clear and present danger to nearby Rome and her interests.

As a result, the Roman Assembly, although reluctant to ally with a band of mercenaries, sent an expeditionary force to return control of Messana to the Mamertines.

The Roman attack on the Carthaginian forces at Messana triggered the first of the [[Punic Wars]].&lt;ref name="Boardman2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Boardman|title=The Oxford Illustrated History of the Roman World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w95Nb-BJWRcC|accessdate=1 March 2013|date=18 January 2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-285436-0|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the next century, these three major conflicts between Rome and Carthage would determine the course of Western civilization. The wars included a Carthaginian invasion led by [[Hannibal Barca]], which nearly prevented the rise of the [[Roman Empire]].

In 256-255 BC the Romans, under the command of [[Marcus Atilius Regulus]], landed in Africa and after suffering some initial defeats the Carthaginian forces eventually repelled the Roman invasion.&lt;ref name="Hoyos2007" /&gt;

Shortly after the First Punic War, Carthage faced a major [[Mercenary War|mercenary revolt]] which changed the internal political landscape of Carthage (bringing the [[Barcid]] family to prominence),&lt;ref name="AstinFrederiksen1990"&gt;{{cite book|author1=A.

The [[Third Punic War]] (149 to 146 BC) was the third and last of the Punic Wars.

==Government==
[[File:Quartier Punique.JPG|thumb|left|Punic district of Carthage]]

The government of Carthage changed dramatically after the total rout of the Carthaginian forces at the battle of Himera on Sicily in 483 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Miles|title=Carthage Must Be Destroyed: The Rise and Fall of an Ancient Civilization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eOQ9JLtGj0UC|accessdate=12 February 2013|date=21 July 2011|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1-101-51703-1|pages=115–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[List of monarchs of Carthage|Magonid clan]] was compelled to compromise and allow representative and even some democratic institutions.

At the head of the Carthaginian state were now two annually elected, not hereditary, [[Shophet|Suffets]] &lt;ref name="Miles130"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Miles|title=Carthage Must Be Destroyed: The Rise and Fall of an Ancient Civilization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eOQ9JLtGj0UC|accessdate=12 February 2013|date=21 July 2011|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1-101-51703-1|pages=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;(thus rendered in Latin by [[Livy]] 30.7.5, attested in Punic inscriptions as SPΘM {{IPA|/ʃuftˤim/}}, meaning "judges" and obviously related to the [[Bible|Biblical]] [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ruler title {{lang|he-Latn|Shophet}} "[[Biblical Judges|Judge]]"),&lt;ref name="Silva2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Moises Silva|title=Biblical Words and Their Meaning: An Introduction to Lexical Semantics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tOz8L_ApkIoC|accessdate=12 February 2013|date=11 May 2010|publisher=Zondervan|isbn=978-0-310-87151-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
similar to modern day executive [[president]]s. Greek and Roman authors more commonly referred to them as "kings", as they were in effect, if not in name, the [[List of monarchs of Carthage|monarchs of Carthage]]. SPΘ {{IPA|/ʃufitˤ/}} might originally have been the title of the city's governor, installed by the mother city of Tyre.

In the historically attested period, the two Suffets were elected annually from among the most wealthy and influential families and ruled collegially, similarly to [[Roman consul]]s (and equated with these by Livy). This practice might have descended from the [[plutocracy|plutocratic]] oligarchies that limited the Suffet's power in the first Phoenician cities.&lt;ref name="Aristotle2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Aristotle|title=Politics: A Treatise on Government|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UnDKjwEACAAJ|accessdate=11 February 2013|date=5 November 2012|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|isbn=978-1-4802-6588-2|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; A range of more junior officials and special commissioners oversaw different aspects of governmental business such as public works, tax-collecting, and the administration of the state treasury.&lt;ref name="Miles130"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. p. 2.11.3–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

The aristocratic families were represented in a supreme council (Roman sources speak of a Carthaginian "[[Senate]]", and Greek ones of a "council of [[Elder (administrative title)|Elders]]" or a [[gerousia]]), which had a wide range of powers; however, it is not known whether the Suffets were elected by this council or by an assembly of the people. Suffets appear to have exercised judicial and executive power, but not military, as generals were chosen by the administration. The final supervision of the Treasury and Foreign Affairs seems to have come under the Council of Elders.&lt;ref name="Miles130"/&gt;

There was a body known as the Tribunal of the [[Hundred and Four]], which Aristotle compared to the Spartan [[ephors]]. These were judges who acted as a kind of higher constitutional court and oversaw the actions of generals,&lt;ref name="Aristotle2012"/&gt; who could sometimes be sentenced to [[crucifixion]], as well as other officials. Panels of special commissioners, called pentarchies, were appointed from the Tribunal of One Hundred and Four: they appear to have dealt with a variety of affairs of state.&lt;ref name="Miles130"/&gt;

[[Aristotle]] reported in his [[Politics (Aristotle)|''Politics'']] that unless the Suffets and the Council reached a unanimous decision, the Carthaginian popular assembly had the decisive vote&amp;nbsp;— unlike the situation in Greek states with similar constitutions such as [[Sparta]] and [[Crete]]. [[Polybius]], in his History book 6, also stated that at the time of the Punic Wars, the Carthaginian public held more sway over the government than the people of Rome held over theirs (a development he regarded as evidence of decline).&lt;ref name="Champion2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Craige B.

[[Eratosthenes]], head of the [[Library of Alexandria]], noted that the Greeks had been wrong to describe all non-Greeks as barbarians, since the Carthaginians as well as the Romans had a constitution.

These troops were supported by mercenaries from different ethnic groups and geographic locations across the Mediterranean, who fought in their own national units; [[Celts]] and [[Balearic Islands|Balearics]] and [[Iberians]] were especially common. Later, after the [[Barcids]] conquered [[Iberia]]{{dubious|date=May 2017}} (modern Spain and Portugal), [[Iberians]] came to form an even greater part of the Carthaginian forces.

Carthage seems to have fielded a formidable cavalry force, especially in its Northwest African homeland; a significant part of it was composed of light [[Numidian cavalry]]. Other mounted troops included [[North African elephant]]s (now extinct), trained for war, which, among other uses, were commonly used for frontal assaults or as anticavalry protection. An army could field up to several hundred of these animals, but on most reported occasions fewer than a hundred were deployed. The riders of these elephants were armed with a spike and hammer to kill the elephants, in case they charged toward their own army. The Carthaginians also fielded troops such as [[Sling (weapon)|slingers]], soldiers armed with straps of cloth used to toss small stones at high speeds.

The navy of Carthage was one of the largest in the Mediterranean, using [[serial production]] to maintain high numbers at moderate cost. The sailors and [[marine (military)|marines]] of the Carthaginian navy were predominantly recruited from the Phoenician citizenry, unlike the multiethnic allied and [[mercenary]] troops of the Carthaginian armies. The navy offered a stable profession and financial security for its sailors. This helped to contribute to the city's political stability, since the unemployed, debt-ridden poor in other cities were frequently inclined to support revolutionary leaders in the hope of improving their own lot.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Goldsworthy&amp;nbsp;– The Fall of Carthage&lt;/ref&gt; The reputation of her skilled sailors implies that training of oarsmen and coxswains occurred in peacetime, giving their navy a cutting edge in naval matters.

The trade of Carthaginian merchantmen was by land across the Sahara and especially by sea throughout the Mediterranean and far into the Atlantic to the tin-rich [[Cassiterides]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Iain Stewart (geologist)|Professor Iain Stewart]], BBC series "How the Earth Made Us", episode 1: Deep Earth (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; and also to Northwest Africa. Evidence exists that at least one Punic expedition, that of [[Hanno the Navigator|Hanno]], may have sailed along the West African coast to regions south of the [[Tropic of Cancer]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia.2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|title=World Exploration From Ancient Times|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jfmcAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63|date=1 February 2011|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|isbn=978-1-61535-455-9|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Polybius]] wrote in the sixth book of his history that the Carthaginians were "more exercised in maritime affairs than any other people."&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, History Book 6&lt;/ref&gt; Their navy included some 300 to 350 warships. The Romans, who had little experience in naval warfare prior to the First Punic War, managed to finally defeat Carthage with a combination of reverse-engineered, captured Carthaginian ships, recruitment of experienced [[Greeks|Greek]] sailors from the ranks of its conquered cities, the unorthodox [[Corvus (weapon)|corvus]] device, and their superior numbers in marines and rowers. In the Third Punic War, Polybius describes a tactical innovation of the Carthaginians, augmenting their few triremes with small vessels that carried hooks (to attack the oars) and fire (to attack the hulls). With this new combination, they were able to stand their ground against the numerically superior Romans for a whole day.

Carthaginian commerce extended by sea throughout the Mediterranean and perhaps into the Atlantic as far as the [[Canary Islands]], and by land across the [[Sahara]] desert.

Carthage also sent caravans into the interior of Africa and [[Fars Province#Persis|Persia]]. It traded its manufactured and agricultural goods to the coastal and interior peoples of Africa for salt, gold, timber, ivory, ebony, apes, peacocks, skins, and hides.&lt;ref&gt;Bogucki 2008, p. 390&lt;/ref&gt; Its merchants invented the practice of sale by auction and used it to trade with the African tribes. In other ports, they tried to establish permanent warehouses or sell their goods in open-air markets. They obtained amber from Scandinavia, and from the Celtiberians, Gauls, and Celts they got amber, tin, silver, and furs. Sardinia and Corsica produced gold and silver for Carthage, and Phoenician settlements on islands such as [[Malta]] and the [[Balearic Islands]] produced commodities that would be sent back to Carthage for large-scale distribution. The city supplied poorer civilizations with simple products such as pottery, metallic objects, and ornamentations, often displacing the local manufacturing, but brought its best works to wealthier ones such as the Greeks and Etruscans. Carthage traded in almost every commodity wanted by the ancient world, including spices from Arabia, Africa and India, and slaves (the empire of Carthage temporarily held a portion of Europe and sent conquered barbarian warriors into Northern African slavery).&lt;ref name="Lange2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dierk Lange|title=Ancient Kingdoms of West Africa: Africa-centred and Canaanite-Israelite Perspectives : a Collection of Published and Unpublished Studies in English and French|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=syATJKcx5A0C|accessdate=11 February 2013|year=2004|publisher=J.H.Röll Verlag|isbn=978-3-89754-115-3|page=278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek version of the Periplus of Hanno describes his voyage.

Carthaginian religion was based on Phoenician religion (derived from the faiths of the [[Levant]]), a form of [[polytheism]]. Many of the gods the Carthaginians worshiped were localized and are now known only under their local names.

A pantheon was presided over by the father of the gods, but a goddess was the principal figure in the Phoenician pantheon.

The Greek and Roman critics, according to Charles Picard, objected not to the killing of children but to the religious nature of it. As in both ancient Greece and Rome, inconvenient children were commonly killed by exposure to the elements.&lt;ref name="Charles-PicardCharles-Picard1968"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gilbert Charles-Picard|author2=Colette Picard|title=The life and death of Carthage: a survey of Punic history and culture from its birth to the final tragedy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7INyAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=10 February 2013|year=1968|publisher=Pan Macmillan|pages=46–48, 153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern [[archaeology]] in formerly Punic areas has discovered a number of large cemeteries for children and infants, representing a civic and religious institution for worship and sacrifice called the [[Tophet]] by archaeologists. These cemeteries may have been used as graves for [[Stillbirth|stillborn]] infants or children who died very early.&lt;ref&gt;Carhtage a History, S Lancel, trans A Nevill, pp251&lt;/ref&gt; Modern archeological excavations have been interpreted by many archeologists&lt;ref name="Brown1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susanna Shelby Brown|title=Late Carthaginian child sacrifice and sacrificial monuments in their Mediterranean context|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mh-1AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=10 February 2013|year=1991|publisher=JSOT|isbn=978-1-85075-240-0|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; as confirming Plutarch's reports of Carthaginian child sacrifice.&lt;ref name="MeyersResearch1997"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eric M. Meyers|author2=American Schools of Oriental Research|title=The Oxford encyclopedia of archaeology in the Near East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KYzrAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=7 April 2013|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 20,000 urns were deposited between 400 BC and 200 BC in the tophet discovered in the Salammbô neighbourhood of present-day Carthage with the practice continuing until the early years of the Christian period.&lt;ref&gt;Aubet 2001, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; The urns contained the charred bones of newborns and in some cases the bones of fetuses and two-year-olds. There is a clear correlation between the frequency of cremation and the well-being of the city. In bad times (war, poor harvests) cremations became more frequent, but it is not known why. One explanation for this correlation is the claim that the Carthaginians prayed for divine intervention via child sacrifice; however, bad times would naturally lead to increased child mortality, and consequently, more child burials via cremation.

Accounts of child sacrifice in Carthage report that beginning at the founding of Carthage in about 814 BC, mothers and fathers buried their children who had been sacrificed to Ba`al Hammon and Tanit in the
tophet.&lt;ref name="Miles2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Miles|title=Carthage Must Be Destroyed: The Rise and Fall of an Ancient Civilization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eOQ9JLtGj0UC|accessdate=12 February 2013|date=21 July 2011|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1-101-51703-1|page=1797}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice was apparently distasteful even to Carthaginians, and they began to buy children for the purpose of sacrifice or even to raise servant children instead of offering up their own. However, Carthage's priests demanded the youth in times of crisis such as war, drought, or famine. Special ceremonies during extreme crisis saw up to 200 children of the most affluent and powerful families slain and tossed into the burning pyre.&lt;ref name="WalbankAstin1990"&gt;{{cite book|author1=F. W. Walbank|author2=A. E. Astin|author3=M. W. Frederiksen|author4=R. M.

Sceptics maintain that the bodies of children found in Carthaginian and Phoenician cemeteries were merely the cremated remains of children who died naturally. Sergio Ribichini has argued that the tophet was "a child necropolis designed to receive the remains of infants who had died prematurely of sickness or other natural causes, and who for this reason were "offered" to specific deities and buried in a place different from the one reserved for the ordinary dead".&lt;ref&gt;Moscati 2001, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;
However, recent study of archeological evidence confirms that the Carthaginians practice human sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Carthaginians sacrificed own children, archaeologists say https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jan/21/carthaginians-sacrificed-own-children-study accessed 4 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portrayals in fiction==
Carthage features in [[Gustave Flaubert]]'s historical novel ''[[Salammbô]]'' (1862). Set around the time of the [[Mercenary War]], it includes a dramatic description of child sacrifice, and the boy Hannibal narrowly avoiding being sacrificed. [[Giovanni Pastrone]]'s [[Epic (genre)|epic]] [[silent film]] ''[[Cabiria]]'' is narrowly based on Flaubert's novel.

''The Young Carthaginian'' (1887) by [[G. A. Henty]] is a boys' adventure novel told from the perspective of Malchus, a fictional teenage lieutenant of Hannibal during the Second Punic War.

In ''[[The Dead Past]]'', a science fiction short story by [[Isaac Asimov]], a leading character is a historian studying ancient times who is trying to disprove the allegation that the Carthaginians carried out child sacrifice.

''The Purple Quest'' by [[Frank G. Slaughter]] is about the founding of Carthage.

''Die Sterwende Stad'' (The Dying City) is a novel written in [[Afrikaans]] by Antonie P. Roux and published in 1956. It is a fictional account of life in Carthage and included the defeat of Hannibal by Scipio Africanus at the Battle of Zama. For several years it was prescribed reading for South African year 11 and 12 high school students studying the Afrikaans language.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

"[[Delenda Est]]", a short story in [[Poul Anderson]]'s Time Patrol series, is an [[alternate history]] where Hannibal won the Second Punic War, and Carthage exists in the 20th century.

A duology by [[John Maddox Roberts]], comprising ''[[Hannibal's Children]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Seven Hills]]'' (2005), is set in an [[alternate history]] where Hannibal defeated Rome in the Second Punic War, and Carthage is still a major Mediterranean power in 100 BC.

[[Mary Gentle]] used an [[alternate history]] version of Carthage as a setting in her novels ''[[Ash: A Secret History]]'' and ''[[Ilario, A Story of the First History]]''. In these books, Carthage is dominated by Germanic tribes, and the premise is that the [[Visigoths]] conquered Carthage and set up a huge empire that repelled the Muslim conquest. In these novels, titles such as "lord-amir" and "scientist-magus" indicate a fusion of European and Northwest African cultures, and Arian Christianity is the state religion.

[[Stephen Baxter (historian)|Stephen Baxter]] also features Carthage in his [[alternate history]] [[Northland trilogy]]; in Baxter's narrative it is Carthage that prevails and subjugates Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Baxter, ''Iron Winter'' (Gollancz, 2012), esp. p334.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5220">'''Aro History''' starts from Ibibio migration to the present [[Arochukwu]] area.

== Ibibio presence ==
Before Igbo arrival in the Aro territory, a [[Semi-Bantu]] group of the [[Ibibio people|Ibibio]] arrived around 300 AD from the [[Benue valley]]. They mainly inhabited the area now known as Southeastern [[Nigeria]]. Prominent settlements were [[Ibom]] and [[Obong Okon Ita]]. These hunters and farmers perhaps lived peacefully until foreign settlers invaded.

== Igbo migration and invasion ==
The [[Igbo people|Igbo]] migration led by [[Eze Agwu]] clan from [[Abiriba]] among the Ibibio in the Aro territory started around the 17th century. Tensions escalated between the Eze Agwu group led by Agwu Inobia and Obong Okon Ita kingdom led by [[Akpan Okon]] resulting in the [[Aro-Ibibio Wars]]. Neither group had a victorious position in the war. Eze Agwu asked [[Priest]] [[Nnachi]] of the [[Edda]] clan near [[Afikpo]] for help. The alliance also supported prince [[Kakpokpo Okon]]'s coup against his brother Akpan Okon. The war escalated and Nnachi called on Eastern Cross River allies for assistance.

== Akpa invasion and the foundation of Arochukwu ==
[[Osim and Akuma Nnubi]] were [[Akpa]] merchant princes from the [[Akamkpa]] area. They led Akpa forces into the Aro territory to assist their Igbo allies to victory. However, this came at the cost of Osim losing his life at the start of the 18th century. With the Akpas and Igbos being victorious, the [[Arochukwu]] kingdom was founded with Akuma as its first king or EzeAro. After Akuma died, the Igbo took over the throne starting with Nnachi's son Oke Nnachi in 1720. Many changes occurred as Arochukwu expanded into 19 [[city-states]] due to the increasing population and Aro colonies were forming throughout the area now known as Southern Nigeria.

== Aro Confederacy ==

By the mid-18th century, there were mass migrations of several Aro business families all over Eastern Nigeria and surrounding areas. This migration, influence of their god Ibini Ukpabi through priests, and their military power supported by alliances with several related neighboring Igbo and eastern Cross River militarized states (particularly [[Ohafia]], [[Abam]], [[Abiriba]], [[Afikpo]], [[Ekoi people|Ekoi]], etc.) quickly established the [[Aro Confederacy]] as a regional economic power.

Aro activities helped coastal [[Niger Delta]] city-states become important centers for the export of palm oil and slaves. Such city-states included [[Opobo]], [[Kingdom of Bonny|Bonny]], [[Brass]], [[Calabar]], as well as other slave trading city-states controlled by the [[Ijaw people|Ijaw]], [[Efik people|Efik]], and Igbo. The Aros formed a strong trading network, colonies, and incorporated hundreds of communities that formed into powerful kingdoms. The [[Ajalli]], [[Arondizuogu]], and [[Bende Kingdom|Bende]] Kingdoms were the most powerful Aro states in the Confederacy after Arochukwu. Some were founded and named after Commanders and Chiefs like [[Izuogu Mgbokpo]] and [[Iheme]] whom led Aro forces to conquer [[Ikpa Ora]] and founded Arondizuogu. Later Aro commanders such as [[Okoro Idozuka]] also of Arondizuogu expanded the state's borders through warfare in the start of the 19th century. The Aro Confederacy's power, however, was mostly derived from its economic and religious position. With [[European ethnic groups|European]] colonists on their way at the end of the 19th century, things changed.

==British conquest ==
[[United Kingdom|British]] colonialism in the late 19th century turned Anglo-Aro relations sour. Aro leaders knew that [[Christianity]], colonialism, and end of their monopoly would destroy Aro economic rule. Also the British felt that repeated Aro attacks rendered outright war inescapable. They made plans for war in 1899. The conflict had both religious and economic causes. Aro traders and the [[Royal Niger Company]], had their own issues. An Aro invasion of [[Obegu]] in 1901 started the [[Anglo-Aro War]]. In 1902, following a direct attack on Arochukwu and months of fighting, the British were victorious. The Aro Confederacy's power was shattered, making it easier for the British to take over the Eastern Nigerian region although resistance in the area was far from over. Although Aro dominance crumbled in March 1902, many Aros took part in later resistances against the British in the region such as [[Afikpo]] (1902–1903), [[Ezza]] (1905), and other areas where the Aro had a particularly significant presence.

== Nigeria ==
When [[Nigeria]] won independence from Great Britain in 1960, ethnic tensions rose between the regions resulting in the [[Nigerian Civil War]] in 1967-1970. After the war, the Aros and the rest of the Igbo People suffered discrimination from other Nigerians.  Aro culture suffered. However, they are currently efforts to unite Aro people and revive their culture.

[[Image:Sino-Indian Geography.png|right|thumb|330px|China and [[India]] have the two largest [[populations]] in the world, and are expected to grow rapidly economically (see [[:Image:Sino-Indian Geography.png#Note|note]]).]]

The '''Asian Century''' is the projected 21st-century dominance of Asian politics and culture, assuming certain demographic and economic trends persist.  The concept of Asian Century parallels the characterization of the 19th century as [[Britain's Imperial Century]], and the 20th century as the [[American Century]].

A 2011 study by the [[Asian Development Bank]] found that an additional 3&amp;nbsp;billion Asians could enjoy living standards similar to those in Europe today, and the region could account for over half of global output by the middle of this century. It warned, however, that the Asian Century is not preordained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adb.org/publications/asia-2050-realizing-asian-century |title=Asia 2050: Realizing the Asian Century &amp;#124; Asian Development Bank |publisher=Adb.org |date=26 March 2012 |accessdate=2012-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
In 1924, [[Karl Haushofer]] used the term "Pacific age," envisaging the growth of Japan, China and India: "A giant space is expanding before our eyes with forces pouring into it which ... await the dawn of the Pacific age, the successor of the Atlantic age, the over-age Mediterranean and European era."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[Hans Weigert]], "Haushofer and the Pacific," ''Foreign Affairs'', 20/4, (1942): p 735.&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase ''Asian Century'' arose in the mid to late 1980s, and is attributed to a 1988 meeting with People's Republic of China (PRC) leader [[Deng Xiaoping]] and Indian Prime Minister [[Rajiv Gandhi]] in which Deng said that '[i]n recent years people have been saying that the next century will be the century of Asia and the Pacific, as if that were sure to be the case. I disagree with this view.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Xiaoping|first=Deng|title=Deng Xiaoping Wenxuan (Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping)|year=1993|publisher=(People's Publishing House)|location=Vol. 3, Beijing: Renmin chubansh|page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this, it made an appearance in a 1985 [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]] hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kDTn49nu1pwC&amp;q=%22asian+century%22+date:0-1990&amp;dq=%22asian+century%22+date:0-1990 |title=Security and Development Assistance |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-28|year=1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been subsequently reaffirmed by Asian political leaders, and is now a popularly used term in the media.

==Reasons==
{{See also|Potential superpowers}}
Asia's robust economic performance over the three decades preceding 2010, compared to that in the rest of the world, made perhaps the strongest case yet for the possibility of an Asian Century. Although this difference in economic performance had been recognized for some time, specific individual setbacks (e.g., the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]]) tended to hide the broad sweep and general tendency. By the early 21st century, however, a strong case could be made that this stronger Asian performance was not just sustainable but held a force and magnitude that could significantly alter the distribution of power on the planet. Coming in its wake, global leadership in a range of significant areas—international diplomacy, military strength, technology, and [[soft power]]—might also, as a consequence, be assumed by one or more of Asia's nation states.

Among many scholars have provided factors that have contributed to the significant Asian development, [[Kishore Mahbubani]] provides seven pillars that rendered the Asian countries to excel and provided themselves with the possibility to become compatible with the Western counterparts.  The seven pillars include: free-market economics, science and technology, meritocracy, pragmatism, culture of peace, rule of law and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mahbubani|first=Kishore|title=The New Asian Hemisphere: The irresistible shift of global power to the east|year=2008|publisher=Public Affairs|pages=51–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further information|World population}}
Population growth in Asia is expected to continue through at least the first half of the 21st century, though it has slowed significantly since the late 20th century. At four billion people in the beginning of the 21st century, the Asian population is predicted to grow to more than five billion by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prb.org/datafind/prjprbdata/wcprbdata7.asp?DW=DR&amp;SL=&amp;SA=1 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430164404/http://www.prb.org/datafind/prjprbdata/wcprbdata7.asp?DW=DR&amp;SL=&amp;SA=1 |date=30 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While its percent of the world population is not expected to greatly change, North American and European shares of the global population are expected to decline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prb.org/Content/NavigationMenu/PRB/Educators/Human_Population/Population_Growth/Population_Growth.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220191024/http://www.prb.org/Content/NavigationMenu/PRB/Educators/Human_Population/Population_Growth/Population_Growth.htm |date=20 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major driver is continued productivity growth in Asia, particularly in China and India, as living standards rise.  Even without completely converging with European or North American living standards, Asia's might produce half of global GDP by 2050. This is a large shift compared to the immediate post-cold war, when North America and Europe combined produced half of global GDP.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A 2011 study by the [[Asian Development Bank]] stated that: "By nearly doubling its share of global gross domestic product (GDP) to 52 percent by 2050, Asia would regain the dominant economic position it held some 300 years ago, before the industrial revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/asia2050-executive-summary.pdf |title=Asia 2050: Realizing the Asian Century |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of the Asian Century assumes that Asian economies can maintain their momentum for another 40 years, adapt to shifting global economic and technological environment, and continually recreate comparative advantages. In this scenario, according to 2011 modelling by the Asian Development Bank Asia's GDP would increase from $17&amp;nbsp;trillion in 2010 to $174&amp;nbsp;trillion in 2050, or half of global GDP. In the same study, the [[Asian Development Bank]] estimates that seven economies would lead Asia's powerhouse growth; under the Asian Century scenario, the region would have no poor countries, compared with eight in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/asia2050-executive-summary.pdf |title=Asian 2050: Realizing the Asian Century |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since China's economic reforms in the late 1970s (in farm privatization) and early 1990s (in most cities), the [[Economy of China|Chinese economy]] has enjoyed three decades of economic growth rates [[Historical GDP of the People's Republic of China|between 8 and 10%]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chinadigitaltimes.net/china/economic-growth-rates/ |title=Tag: economic growth rates |publisher=Chinadigitaltimes.net |date= |accessdate=2012-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Economy of India|Indian economy]] began a similar albeit slower ascent at the end of the 1980s and early 1990s, and has averaged around 4% during this period, though growing slightly over 8% in 2005, and hitting 9.2% in 2006 before slowing to 6% in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibef.org/economy/economyoverview.aspx |title=Indian Economy Overview |publisher=Ibef.org |date=20 April 2012 |accessdate=2012-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; then reaching 8.9% in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-30/india-economy-grows-faster-than-estimated-8-9-adding-inflation-pressure.html | work=Bloomberg | first1=Kartik | last1=Goyal | first2=Unni | last2=Krishnan | title=Growth May Surpass Government Target for Year, Ushering Higher India Rates | date=1 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Goldman Sachs]] report suggests that the Indian economy could surpass the [[Economy of the United States|US economy]] by 2043, but India "will remain a low-income country for several decades, with per capita incomes well below its other [[BRIC]] peers. If [[India]] fulfills its growth potential, it can become a motor for the world economy, and a key contributor to generating spending growth".&lt;ref name="potential"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usindiafriendship.net/viewpoints1/Indias_Rising_Growth_Potential.pdf |title=India's Rising Growth Potential |publisher=Goldman Sachs |year=2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724120152/http://www.usindiafriendship.net/viewpoints1/Indias_Rising_Growth_Potential.pdf |archivedate=24 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both of these developments involved policy of a degree of managed [[liberalisation]] of the economy as well as a turning outwards of the economy towards [[globalization]] (both exports and attracting inward investment). The magnitude of this liberalisation and globalisation is still subject to debate. They were part of conscious decisions by key political leaders, especially in India and the PRC. Also, the populations of the two countries offer a potential market of over two and a quarter billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/ipc/idbrank.pl |title=Countries Ranked by Population: 1999 |date=1998-12-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19991128111024/http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/ipc/idbrank.pl |archivedate=28 November 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of the internal consumer market in these two countries has been a major basis for economic development. This has enabled much higher national growth rates for China and India in comparison to Japan, the EU and even the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/statistics/ |title=Indices &amp; Data &amp;#124; Human Development Reports (HDR) &amp;#124; United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) |publisher=Hdr.undp.org |date=2 November 2011 |accessdate=2012-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The international cost advantage on goods and services, based on cheaper labor costs, has enabled these two countries to exert a global competitive pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Global_Economy/KH06Dj02.html |title=Asia Times Online :: Asian news and current affairs |publisher=Atimes.com |date=6 August 2009 |accessdate=2012-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term Easternization has been used to refer to the spread of oriental (mainly Japanese) management techniques to the West.&lt;ref&gt;Raffin, Anne, "Easternization Meets Westernization: Patriotic Youth Organizations in French Indochina during World War 2"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaplinsky, Raphael, Easternization: The spread of Japanese Management Techniques to Developing Countries&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kwang-Kuo Hwang, Easternization: Socio-cultural Impact on Productivity&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Colin Campbell, Easternization of the West" p. 376&lt;/ref&gt;

The trend for greater Asian economic dominance has also been based on the extrapolations of recent historic economic trends. [[Goldman Sachs]], in its [[BRIC]] economic forecast, highlighted the trend towards mainland China becoming the largest and India the second largest economies by the year 2050 in terms of GDP. The report also predicted the type of industry that each nation would dominate, leading some to deem mainland China 'the industrial workshop of the world' and India 'one of the great service societies'.&lt;ref&gt;David, Jacques-Henri. "[http://www.watchingamerica.com/lefigaro000043.html In 2020, America Will Still Dominate Global Economy]", ''Le Figaro'', 25 August 2005. Retrieved 21 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2009, the majority of the countries that are considered [[Newly industrialized country|newly industrialized]] are in Asia.

By 2050, the East Asian and South Asian economies will have increased by over 20 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cap-lmu.de/publikationen/1999/asias_future_globalization.php |title=Asia's Future in a Globalized World |publisher=Cap-lmu.de |date= |accessdate=2012-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; With that comes a rise in [[Human Development Index]], the index used to measure the standards of living. India's HDI will approach .8. East Asia's would approach .94 or fairly close to the living standards of the western nations such as the EU and the US. This would mean that it would be rather difficult to determine the difference in wealth of the two. Because of East Asian and Indian populations, their economy would be very large, and if current trends continue, India's long-term population could approach double that of China. East Asia could surpass all western nations' combined economies as early as 2030. South Asia could soon follow if the hundreds of millions in poverty continue to be lifted into middle class.

====Construction projects====
[[File:2ifc at twilight.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[International Finance Centre (Hong Kong)|International Finance Centre]] in Hong Kong]]
It is projected that the most groundbreaking construction projects will take place in Asia within the approaching years. As a symbol of economic power, [[supertall]] skyscrapers have been erected in Asia, and more projects are currently being conceived and begun in Asia than in any other region of the world. Completed projects include: the [[Petronas Towers]] of [[Kuala Lumpur]], the [[Shanghai World Financial Center]], [[International Finance Centre (Hong Kong)|International Finance Centre]] in Hong Kong, [[Taipei 101]] in Taiwan, and the [[Burj Khalifa]] in [[Dubai]], [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]]. Future buildings promise to be taller, like the [[Shanghai Tower]] and the [[India Tower]].

===Culture===

Culturally, the Asian century is symbolized by [[Cinema of India|Indian]] genre films ([[Bollywood]], [[Parallel Cinema]]), [[Cinema of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] genre films ([[martial arts films]], [[Hong Kong action cinema]]), Japanese [[Anime|animation]], and the [[Korean Wave]]. The awareness of Asian cultures may be a part of a much more culturally aware world, as proposed in the [[Clash of Civilizations]] thesis. Equally, the affirmation of Asian cultures affects the identity politics of Asians in Asia and outside in the Asian [[diaspora]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianamericanalliance.com/Culture-of-Asia.html |title=Culture of Asia – Music, Art and Language |publisher=Asianamericanalliance.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Feng shui]] books topped the nonfiction best-seller lists and feng shui schools have multiplied. Major banks and multinational corporations employ feng shui consultants to advise them on the organization of their offices. There has been a readiness to supplement Eastern forms of medicine, therapy, and massage and reject traditional Western medicine in favor of techniques, such as acupressure and acupuncture. Practices such as [[moxibustion]] and [[shiatsu]] enjoy enormous popularity in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Campbell, Easternization of the West" p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; So do virtually all the Eastern martial arts, such as kung fu, judo, karate, aikido, taekwondo, kendo, jujitsu, tai chi, qigong, ba gua, and xing yi, with their many associated schools and subforms.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Campbell, Easternization of the West" p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Asian cuisine is quite popular in the West due to Asian immigration and subsequent interest from non-Asians into Asian ingredients and food. Even small towns in Britain, Canada, Scandinavia, or the United States generally have at least one Indian or Chinese restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Campbell, Easternization of the West" p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Restaurants serving pan-Asian and Asian-inspired cuisine have also opened across North America, Australia and other parts of the world. [[P.F.

In Australia, New Zealand, Ireland and the UK an Asian-inspired range of noodles known as ''Maggi Fusian'' and a long running range in Germany and Austria known as, ''Maggi Magic Asia'' includes a range of noodles inspired by food dishes found in China, Japan, Korea, India, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.maggi.co.uk/products/fusian/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nestle-marktplatz.de/view/produkte/maggi-magic-asia-noodle-cup-chicken-7613035087583&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the use of English continues to spread, [[Asian languages]] are becoming more popular to teach and study outside the continent.

In the early years of the twentieth century very few people were vegetarians. The figure given for the United Kingdom during World War 2 was 100,000 out of a population of some 50 million – around 0.2 percent of the total. By the 1990s the figure was estimated as between 4.2 percent and 11 percent of the British population and rising rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; As Porritt and Winner observe, as recently as the 1960s and early '70s, "being a vegetarian was considered distinctively odd," but "it is now both respectable and common place."&lt;ref&gt;Porritt Jonathan, and David Winner, The Coming of the Greens&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Colin Campbell, "Easternization of the West" p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread of the Korean wave, particularly [[K-pop]] and [[Korean drama]]s, outside Asia has led to the establishment of services to sustain this demand. [[Viki (website)|Viki]] and [[DramaFever]] are examples of services providing Korean dramas to international viewers alongside other Asian content.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.viki.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dramafever.com/&lt;/ref&gt; [[SBS PopAsia]] and Asian Pop Radio are two radio-related music services propagating the proliferation of K-pop throughout Australia. Apart from K-pop, Asian Pop Radio is also devoted to other Asian pop music originating from Indonesia, Thailand, Japan, Malaysia and Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asianpopradio.com/about.html&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, SBS PopAsia focuses on other East Asian pop music from China and Japan and to some extent Southeast Asian pop music in conjunction with K-pop. The rising popularity of Asian-related content has resulted in "SBS PopAsia" becoming a brand name for [[SBS (Australian TV channel)|SBS]] content such as TV shows and news originating from Asia such as China, South Korea, Japan and India.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=nkCDBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing awareness and popularity of Eastern culture and philosophies in the West has led to Eastern cultural objects being sold in these countries. The most well known being [[Buddharupa|statues of the Buddha]] which range from statues sold for the garden to items sold for the house. Statues of Hindu gods such as [[Ganesha]] and East Asian iconography such as the [[Yin and yang]] are also sold in many stores in Western countries. Ishka a [[chain store]] in Australia sells many Asian-origin content particularly from India. The selling of Eastern cultural objects has however been met by criticism, with some saying many who buy these items do not understand the significance of them and that it is a form of [[Orientalism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2014/08/19/4069992.htm Appreciation or Appropriation?

As recently as the 1950s, Crane Brinton, the distinguished historian of ideas, could dismiss "modern groups that appeal to Eastern wisdom" as being in effect "sectarian", "marginal", and "outside the main current of Western thought and feeling".&lt;ref&gt;Colin Campbell, Easternization of the West" p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Yet some Westerners have converted to Eastern religions or at least have shown an interest in them. An example is Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, whom the Beatles followed, first to Bangor in Wales in 1967, and subsequently to India to study Transcendental Meditation in 1968. The Dalai Lama, whose book The Art of Happiness became a best-seller, can attract huge crowds in New York's Central Park or London's Wembley Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Campbell, Easternization of the West" p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Buddhism]] in some countries is the second biggest religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/2820377.stm | work=BBC News | title=Buddhism becomes second religion | date=4 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
FWBO is one of the biggest and fastest-growing Buddhist organizations in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Campbell, Easternization of the West" p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Belief in [[reincarnation]] has never been a part of official Christian or Jewish teaching, or at least, in Christianity, it has been a formal heresy since it was rejected by a narrow margin at the Second Council of Constantinople in AD 553.&lt;ref&gt;Weatherhead, Leslie D., The Christian Agnostic&lt;/ref&gt; However nearly all polling in Western countries reveals significant levels of this belief. "Puzzled People" undertaken in the 1940s suggested that only 4 percent of people in Britain believed in reincarnation. Geoffrey Gorer's survey, carried out a few years later, arrived at 5 percent (1955, p.&amp;nbsp;262). However, this figure had reached 18 percent by 1967 (Gallup, 1993), only to increase further to a sizable 29 percent by 1979, a good six-fold increase on the earlier "Puzzled People" figure. Eileen Barker has reported that around one-fifth of Europeans now say that they believe in reincarnation.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Campbell, Easternization of the West" pp. 72–73&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karma]], which has its roots in ancient India and is a key concept in [[Hinduism]], Buddhism and other [[Eastern religions]], has entered the cultural conscience of many in the Western world. [[John Lennon]]'s 1970 single, "[[Instant Karma!]]" is credited towards the popularization of ''karma'' in the Western world and is now a widely known and popular concept today giving rise to catchphrases and [[Internet meme|memes]] and figuring in other forms of Western popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;https://people.howstuffworks.com/karma2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/radio/tapestry/the-truth-about-karma-my-twin-the-dalai-lama-documentary-if-you-can-breathe-1.2967747/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-karma-but-were-too-polite-to-ask-1.2975361&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/karma-is-a-bitch&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mindfulness]] and [[Buddhist meditation]], both very popular in Asia, have both been gaining popularity in the West.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alternet.org/personal-health/how-mindfulness-movement-went-mainstream-and-backlash-came-it&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
[[Image:Jawaharlal Nehru Trust Port.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The cargo of a container ship from East Asia being unloaded at the [[Jawaharlal Nehru Port]] in [[Navi Mumbai]], India. Increasing economic integration of Asian countries has also brought them closer politically.]]
The global political position of China and to a lesser extent India has risen in international bodies and amongst the world powers, leading the United States and [[European Union]] to become more active in the process of engagement with these two countries. China is also a permanent member of the [[UN Security Council]]. Although India is not a permanent member, it is possible that it will become one or at the least gain a more influential position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3679968.stm | work=BBC News | title=Analysis: India's Security Council seat bid | date=22 September 2004 | accessdate=25 April 2010 | first=Ethirajan | last=Anbarasan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan is also attempting to become a permanent member,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A46196-2005Mar18.html?nav=rss_politics | work=The Washington Post | title=U.S. to Back Japan Security Council Bid | first=Glenn | last=Kessler | date=18 March 2005 | accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the attempts of both are opposed by other Asian countries (i.e. India's bid is opposed by Pakistan; Japan's bid is opposed by China, South Korea, North Korea).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yQmxq0olW4AC&amp;pg=PA151&amp;lpg=PA151&amp;dq=japan+security+council+korea+oppose |title=Japan's Quest for a Permanent Security Council Seat: A Matter of Pride Or ... – Reinhard Drifte – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 14 January 2000|accessdate=2012-07-28|isbn=9780312228477 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Asian regional bloc may be further developed in the 21st century around [[ASEAN]] and other bodies on the basis of free trade agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asean.org/afp/87.htm |title=ASEAN and India Seal Trade, Cooperation Pacts With Eye on "Asian century" |publisher=Asean.org |date=15 October 2003 |accessdate=2012-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404053545/http://www.asean.org/afp/87.htm |archivedate=4 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is some political concern amongst the national leaderships of different Asian countries about PRC's hegemonic ambitions in the region. Another new organization, the [[East Asian Summit]], could also possibly create an EU-like trade zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4524214.stm | work=BBC News | title=Asian powers reach for new community | date=14 December 2005 | accessdate=25 April 2010 | first=Sarah | last=Buckley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian Prime Minister [[Yevgeny Primakov]] encouraged the idea of a triple alliance between Russia, the PRC and India first formulated by Indian strategist [[Madhav Das Nalapat]] in 1983,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1061119/asp/nation/story_7021867.asp | location=Calcutta, India | work=The Telegraph | first=Jehangir S. | last=Pocha | title=China and US in trophy tug of war | date=19 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and supported the idea of a [[Polarity in international relations|multipolar]] world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asianaffairs.com/jan2003/diplomacy.htm |title=at |publisher=Asianaffairs.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the November 2006 visit of [[Hu Jintao]] to India, the idea seems to be gaining some momentum.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

===Human Capital===
The 2007 World Bank Report on globalization notes that "rising education levels were also important, boosting Asian growth on average by 0.75 to 2 percentage points."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Economic Prospects: Managing the next wave of globalization|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2006/12/06/000112742_20061206155022/Rendered/PDF/381400GEP2007.pdf|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rapid expansion of human capital through quality education throughout Asia has played a significant role in experiencing "higher life expectancy and economic growth, and even to the quality of institutions and whether societies will make the transition into modern democracies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Asian Century Will Be Built on Human Capital|url=http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2013/04/03/the-asian-century-will-be-built-on-human-capital/|publisher=East Asia Forum|accessdate=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===3G (Global Growth Generators)===
The Asian countries with the most promising growth prospects are: Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Mongolia, Pakistan,  Philippines, Sri Lanka and Vietnam. Developing Asia is projected to be the fastest growing region until 2050, driven by population and income growth: 9 of 11 3G countries came from Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sme.com.ph/sme-news/news.php?newsid%3D2324 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110424124759/https://www.sme.com.ph/sme-news/news.php?newsid=2324 |archivedate=24 April 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vietnam has the highest Global Growth Generators Index, China is second with 0.81, followed by India's 0.71.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saigon-gpdaily.com.vn/National/2011/3/90136/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110309073113/http://www.saigon-gpdaily.com.vn/National/2011/3/90136/ |archivedate=9 March 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on a report from the HSBC Trade Confidence Index (TCI) and HSBC Trade Forecast, there are 4 countries with significant trade volume growth – Egypt, India, Vietnam and Indonesia – with growth is projected to reach at least 7.3 percent per year until 2025&lt;ref&gt;.{{cite web |url=http://www.antaranews.com/en/news/76753/indonesia-fourth-in-worlds-trade-volume-growth |title=Indonesia fourth in world's trade volume growth |date=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Next Eleven===
The '''Next Eleven''' (known also by the [[numeronym]] '''N-11''') are the eleven countries – [[Bangladesh]], [[Egypt]], [[Indonesia]], [[Iran]], [[Mexico]], [[Nigeria]], [[Pakistan]], [[Philippines]], [[Turkey]], [[South Korea]], and [[Vietnam]] – identified by [[Goldman Sachs]] [[investment bank]] and economist [[Jim O'Neill (economist)|Jim O'Neill]] in a [[Academic paper|research paper]] as having a high potential of becoming, along with the [[BRIC]]s/[[BRICS]], the world's largest economies in the 21st century. The bank chose these [[sovereign state|states]], all with promising outlooks for investment and future growth, on 12 December 2005. At the end of 2011, the four major countries (Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria and Turkey) also known as [[MINT (economics)|MINT]], made up 73 percent of all Next Eleven GDP. BRIC GDP was $13.5&amp;nbsp;trillion, while MIKT GDP at almost 30 percent of that: $3.9 trillion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waspada.co.id/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=256538:indonesia-negara-jagoan-masa-depan&amp;catid=77:fokusutama&amp;Itemid=131 |title=Indonesia negara jagoan masa depan |accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges to realizing the Asian Century==
Asia's growth is not guaranteed. Its leaders will have to manage multiple risks and challenges, particularly:

* Growing inequality within countries, in which wealth and opportunities are confined to the upper echelons. This could undermine social cohesion and stability.
* Many Asian countries like India and Pakistan will not be able to make the necessary investments in infrastructure, education and government policies that would help them avoid the [[Middle Income Trap]].
* Intense competition for finite natural resources, such as land, water, fuel or food, as newly affluent Asians aspire to higher standards of living.
* Global warming and climate change, which could threaten agricultural production, coastal populations, and numerous major urban areas.
* Rampant corruption, which plagues many Asian governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/asia2050-executive-summary.pdf |title=ASIA 2050 – Realizing the Asian Century – Executive Summary |format=PDF |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Aging population can have a direct influence on the continuous economic development of Asian countries in terms of such as, but not limited to, declining labor force, change of consumption patterns, strain on public finances and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Impact of Population Aging on Asia's Future Growth|url=http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/economics-wp281.pdf|publisher=Asian Development Bank|accessdate=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Despite forecasts that predict the rising economic and political strength of Asia, the idea of an Asian Century has faced criticism. This has included the possibility that the continuing high rate of growth could lead to revolution, [[recession|economic slumps]], and [[List of environmental issues|environmental problems]], especially in mainland China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/surveys/displaystory.cfm?story_id=5623226 | work=The Economist | title=Coming out | date=23 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe that the 21st century will be [[Polarity in international relations|multipolar]], and no one country or continent will have such a concentration of influence. However some proponents of the Asian Century respond that since the two most populous countries (China and India) are in Asia then it's only natural that they will play a bigger role in the world's affairs than smaller countries and thus it won't be a multipolar century. Finally, although the British Empire was a superpower during the nineteenth century, controlling nearly a quarter of the world's area and population, during the 20th century there was still a balance of political power with the [[British Empire|British]] and other European colonial empires from 1900 until 1945, and with the US and the [[Soviet Union]] from 1945 until 1991.

The '''Battle of Cerro Muriano''' took place during the [[Spanish Civil War]] in 1936.

==Location==
Cerro Muriano is a village currently within the municipal terms of [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Córdoba]] and [[Obejo]] in the [[Province of Córdoba (Spain)|Province of Córdoba]].

==History==
The battle followed the August [[Córdoba offensive]] and lasted two days, 5 and 6 September 1936. After a 36-hour siege the ''[[Regulares]]'' and the [[Spanish Legion]] troops overran the Republican positions of the ''Columna Miaja'' leaving many dead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.photographers.it/articoli/cerro_muriano.htm La battaglia di Cerro Muriano]&lt;/ref&gt;

The battle is famous owing to the picture of a [[The Falling Soldier|"falling militiaman"]] taken by [[Robert Capa]], a picture that sought to represent the tragic fate of the Spanish Republic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laguerracivilencordoba.es/art_combatecerromuriano.htm El combate de Cerro Muriano y la foto de robert capa]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturandalucia.com/GCE/Taino/La_identidad_de_Federico_Antonio_Borrell_Garc%C3%ADa_Taino.htm La identidad de "Taino" en una foto atribuida a Robert Capa]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bright House Networks, LLC''' was an American telecom company. Prior to its purchase by [[Charter Communications]], it was the tenth-largest multichannel video service provider and the 6th largest cable internet provider (based on coverage) in the United States.&lt;ref name="NCTA Top 25 MSO's"&gt;[http://www.ncta.com/industry-data/item/217 NCTA Top 25 MSO's]&lt;/ref&gt; The company served more than 2.2 million customers.&lt;ref name="brighthouse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brighthouse.com/corporate/about|title=About Bright House Networks|publisher=Bright House Networks|accessdate=2014-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bright House Networks' primary service offerings included [[digital television]], high-speed internet, home security and automation and voice services.&lt;ref name="brighthouse" /&gt;

Bright House Networks also  owned and operated two 24-hour local news operations; Central Florida [[News 13]] serving the [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] area, and [[Bay News 9]] serving the [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa Bay]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baynews9.com/content/news/baynews9/news/about/bright-house-networks.html|title=About Bright House Networks |publisher=Bay News 9|accessdate=2014-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Prior to 1994, some of the systems were fully owned by Advance/Newhouse under the names Vision Cable and Cable Vision (no relation to Cablevision in the [[New York City]] metro area), while in other areas, Bright House Networks is the successor to [[TelePrompTer Corporation|TelePrompTer Cable TV]], [[Westinghouse Broadcasting|Group W Cable]], Strategic Cable, [[Paragon Cable]], [[Shaw Communications]] and the Tampa Bay/Orlando Time Warner Communications systems in Florida.

All of the systems that eventually came to be owned by Bright House Networks were previously owned by the [[Time Warner]] Entertainment–[[Advance Publications|Advance/Newhouse]] Partnership. Bright House Networks, LLC was formerly known as TWEAN Subsidiary, LLC and changed its name to Bright House Networks, LLC in April 1, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=9316967&lt;/ref&gt; Under a deal struck in 2003, Advance/Newhouse took direct management and operational responsibility for a portion of the partnership cable systems roughly equal to their equity. Bright House Networks offers video, high-speed data, home security and automation and voice services. In addition, Bright House Networks operated two regional local news channels – [[Bay News 9]] in the Tampa Bay market, and [[News 13]] in the Orlando market. Bright House Networks had an extensive fiber optic network in the Florida area and used it to provide commercial services including dedicated Internet access, VPN services, and private network transport as well as telecom facilities such as SIP trunking and PRI service.

On March 31, 2015, [[Charter Communications]] announced it would acquire Bright House in a $10.4 billion deal, contingent on [[Time Warner Cable]] waiving its [[right of first refusal]] to acquire the latter company, which was not expected to be exercised given the then-pending [[Comcast–Time Warner Cable merger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/os-charter-to-buy-bright-house-cable-20150331-story.html|title=Charter to buy Bright House cable |work=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |date=March 30, 2015|accessdate=April 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 26, 2015, after Comcast had abandoned its plans to buy Time Warner Cable, Charter announced its own plans to merge with TWC, as well as a renegotiated arrangement for the purchase of Bright House. If both deals are completed, [[Advance Publications|Advance/Newhouse]] will gain a stake of roughly 14 percent in the combined company.&lt;ref name=nyt-merger&gt;{{cite web|title=Charter Communications Agrees to Acquire Time Warner Cable|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/27/business/dealbook/charter-communications-agrees-to-acquire-time-warner-cable.html |website=The New York Times|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 25, 2016 regulators approved both mergers. As a result of the deal, the Bright House and Time Warner Cable brands will be phased out and eliminated completely, with both services amalgamated under Charter's Spectrum brand over the coming months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-charter-time-warner-cable-20160517-snap-story.html |title=Charter completes purchase of Time Warner Cable, Bright House|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=May 18, 2016|accessdate=June 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service area==

The company provided service to areas including [[Indianapolis]], [[Central Florida]] ([[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] / [[Daytona Beach, Florida|Daytona Beach]] areas), [[Tampa Bay Area|Tampa]]/[[Lakeland, Florida|Lakeland]] area, [[Birmingham–Hoover Metropolitan Area|Birmingham–Hoover]] area, west suburban [[Detroit]], and [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]]. Most of its former business was concentrated in Central Florida.

==Naming rights==
Bright House Networks owns the naming rights to [[University of Central Florida|UCF]]'s Bright House Networks Stadium (now [[Spectrum Stadium]]) in Orlando, Florida; Bright House Field (now [[Spectrum Field]]) in Clearwater, Florida, the spring training home of the [[Philadelphia Phillies|Phillies]]; and the [[The Park at River Walk|Bright House Networks Amphitheatre]] in Bakersfield, California. They formerly served as title sponsor of the [[Symetra Tour|Futures Tour]] [[Bright House Networks Open]] golf tournament, held in Lakeland, Florida.

==Carriage disputes==
When Bright House Networks was separate from Time Warner Cable, most of its carriage deals were still negotiated on its behalf by Time Warner Cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/features/media/bright-house-viewers-lose-wtog-showtime-in-cbs-time-warner-dispute/2134972| title=Bright House viewers lose WTOG, Showtime| publisher=TampaBay.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Bright House customers were affected whenever there were carriage disputes between TWC and a content provider, which has happened several times.

[[File:Bright_House_Networks_Spectrum.png|right|thumb|150px|Bright House Networks Spectrum]]
* From its inception in 2003, Bright House's systems in central Florida, including [[Orlando]], refused to carry [[Fox Sports Florida]]. This dated back to when the central Florida cable franchise was held by Cablevision, and then Time Warner Cable. As Bright House is by far the largest cable provider in central Florida, this left most of the Orlando area without most [[Orlando Magic]] games. The dispute ended in 2009, when Bright House added Fox Sports Florida to its lineup.
* On September 15, 2008, Bright House temporarily dropped stations owned by the [[LIN TV Corporation]] on its [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]], [[DeFuniak Springs, Florida|DeFuniak Springs]] and Indiana systems. Affected stations were [[WALA-TV]] in [[Mobile, Alabama]], [[WISH-TV]]/[[WNDY-TV]]/[[WIIH-CD|WIIH-CA]] in [[Indianapolis]] and [[WANE-TV]] in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]]. Even though the controversy was focused on Time Warner Cable systems, Bright House was included in the dispute, in areas where they were formerly owned by Time Warner. With both companies factored in, a total of 15 markets were affected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lintv.com/news/images/PDFs/news_releases/TVL%20-%20LIN%20TV%20Announces%20Retransmission%20Contract%20with%20Time%20Warner%20Expires%20October%202,%202008%20-%209-15-08.pdf LIN TV Corp.: Time Warner Contract Expires October 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003193412/http://lintv.com/news/images/PDFs/news_releases/TVL%20-%20LIN%20TV%20Announces%20Retransmission%20Contract%20with%20Time%20Warner%20Expires%20October%202%2C%202008%20-%209-15-08.pdf|date=October 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On December 31, 2008, Time Warner Cable and [[Viacom]]'s [[MTV Networks]] had not agreed to renew any Viacom channel beyond the end of year. Therefore, Time Warner and Bright House Networks would have lost all 19 Viacom channels (including [[Comedy Central]] and [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]]) starting on January 1, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20670001&amp;refer=us&amp;sid=algojFpM7.Ho Viacom May Pull Channels Off Time Warner Cable in Contract Spat]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28440958/|title=Time Warner may cut ‘Colbert,’ ‘Spongebob’|publisher=msnbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This blackout was narrowly avoided when a zero-hour deal was reached shortly after 12 Midnight ET on January 1, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-viacom2-2009jan02,0,1305999.story Los Angeles Times: "Viacom, Time Warner Cable settle contract dispute", 1/1/2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In December 2009, the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] announced that a dispute with Time Warner Cable could lead to Fox's owned and operated affiliates to be pulled from Bright House systems in the Detroit, Tampa Bay, Orlando and Gainesville markets, along with Fox's cable and sports channels in all markets served by Bright House. The carriage protests were announced shortly before Fox was to carry the [[Bowl Championship Series]], which included the [[2009 Florida Gators football team|Florida Gators]] in the [[2010 Sugar Bowl|Sugar Bowl]]. The dispute excluded [[Fox News Channel]], [[Fox Business Network]] and some regional sports channels, which are on separate contracts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keepfoxon.com/ keepfoxon.com, Fox's official carriage protest site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125132932/http://www.keepfoxon.com/|date=January 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5BH2FX20091218 Reuters: "Fox says Time Warner Cable may drop Fox TV shows", December 18, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before the 12 midnight ET deadline on December 31, 2009, Fox granted Time Warner Cable and Bright House a brief extension during New Year's Day as talks continued, so viewers would not miss the Sugar Bowl, though the other bowl games and the NFL lineup remained at risk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/sns-ap-us-tec-cable-tv-dispute,0,4676419.story AP (via Chicago Tribune): "Fox grants 'brief extension', keeps signal going as dispute with Time Warner Cable continues", January 1, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; A settlement between the two parties was reached the evening of January 1, 2010, though no terms were disclosed; during the discussions that day, none of Fox's channels or stations were blacked out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/nfl-idol-time-warner-cable-fox-reach-deal/story?id=9460090 ABC News: "NFL, 'Idol' After All: Time Warner Cable, Fox Announce Deal on Broadcasts; Football Fans Breathe Easier as Cable Giants Reach an Unspecified Agreement", January 1, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In July 2010, ABC's parent company, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], announced that Disney was involved in a carriage dispute with Time Warner Cable for the first time since 2000 (because Bright House Networks deals are negotiated by Time Warner Cable, Bright House customers were also affected). In Bright House-served areas, the dispute involved the [[Disney Channel]], [[Disney XD]], [[ABC Family]], and all the networks of [[ESPN]]. Despite word of an early agreement on August 30, 2010,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/p/news/busines/time_warner_cable_disney_set_tv_gOJz9nDkeJfwnj5hEjytAJ New York Post: "Time Warner Cable, Disney set TV deal", August 30, 2010.]{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020061059/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/busines/time_warner_cable_disney_set_tv_gOJz9nDkeJfwnj5hEjytAJ |date=October 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it was not until the evening of the September 2 deadline that an agreement was reached between Disney and Time Warner Cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/triad/stories/2010/08/30/daily33.html|title=ABC, ESPN stay on air as Disney-Time Warner talks continue|date=September 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-09-02/disney-keeps-channels-on-time-warner-cable-as-talks-extend-past-deadline.html|work=Bloomberg|first=Kelly|last=Riddell|title=Disney Keeps Channels on Time Warner Cable as Talks Extend Past Deadline|date=September 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=11540715|title=Business News, Personal Finance and Money News|publisher=ABC News|date=|accessdate=2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On July 9, 2012, [[Hearst Television]] removed its stations from Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks systems when the parties failed to reach a deal.&lt;ref name=adweek070912a&gt;[http://www.adweek.com/news/television/hearst-and-time-warner-cable-part-ways-over-retrans-141788 Adweek: "Hearst and Time Warner Cable Part Ways Over Retrans", July 10, 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; In the interim, [[WESH]] Orlando was replaced on Bright House systems in Central Florida with [[WBRE-TV]] [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania]], a station owned by the [[Nexstar Media Group|Nexstar Broadcasting Group]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adweek.com/news/television/imported-signals-retrans-fight-raise-regulatory-questions-141798 Adweek: "Imported Signals in Retrans Fight Raise Regulatory Questions", July 10, 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; while other Hearst stations on Bright House were replaced with other cable channels offered by Bright House. Nexstar complained that Bright House has used WBRE's signal outside their markets without permission, while Bright House argued it was within its rights to use that station's signal as a replacement until a deal with Hearst was reached.&lt;ref&gt;[http://networkedblogs.com/zJMOu Tampa Bay Times: "Hearst dispute with Bright House pulls WMOR-Ch. 32 and digital THIS TV off Tampa Bay cable system", July 10, 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Time Warner Cable, the dispute stemmed from Hearst's demand of a 300% increase in its retransmission fees.&lt;ref name=adweek070912a/&gt; The substitutions lasted until July 19, 2012, when the deal was reached between Hearst and Time Warner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/487486-Hearst_TV_Time_Warner_Cable_End_Viewer_Blackout.php Broadcasting &amp; Cable: "Hearst TV, Time Warner Cable End Viewer Blackout", July 19, 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* On August 2, 2013 at 5 pm, the carriage deal between CBS and Time Warner Cable expired, with no renewal deal being reached until a month later. Time Warner had major markets affected by the blackout, while only a few Bright House markets lost access to [[CBS]] and [[The CW|CW]] stations owned by [[CBS Television Stations]], as well as cable channels FLIX and The Smithsonian Channel; Bright House's territory includes CBSTS-owned broadcast stations Tampa CW station [[WTOG-TV]] and Detroit's [[WKBD-TV]] and [[WWJ-TV]] on their [[Livonia, Michigan]] system, which were blacked out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clickorlando.com/station/Local-6-issues-programming-alert/-/1636714/8861484/-/r9yebxz/-/index.html|title=Local 6 issues programming alert|publisher=ClickOrlando.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Premium channels Showtime and The Movie Channel, which are also owned by CBS, were similarly pulled from the cable lineup, including the corresponding Video On Demand services. Bright House said that CBS withdrew permission to air Showtime, while CBS denied that and called the blackout a "punitive" measure by TWC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment/blogs/tv-guy/os-showtime-off-bright-house-in-fee-dispute-20130802,0,2608071.post|title=Showtime off Bright House in fee dispute|publisher=The Orlando Sentinel}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In October of 2017, a dispute began between Charter and Viacom. Charter and Viacom did work out a temporary agreement, although a final decision has not been reached.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1172">The '''Capitol Theatre''', located just off [[O'Connell Street]], [[Dublin]], began life on 10 August 1920 as the ''La Scala Theatre and Opera House''. Despite its name, the La Scala was a cinema. [[Paramount Pictures]] took over the lease on the building and renamed it the Capitol. Under new management, the Capitol ran a live show every week to accompany the current film. Well-known [[Ireland|Irish]] acts to appear in these shows included [[Peggy Dell]], [[Martin Crosbie]], brother of [[Paddy Crosbie]], creator of the School Around the Corner, and [[Sean Mooney]]. The last stage show was on 29 October 1953. The Capitol continued as a cinema until 1972. It was demolished along with the adjacent [[Metropole Cinema]] and a branch of the department store chain [[British Home Stores]] was built on the site. This in turn closed and was replaced by a branch of the Irish [[Penneys]] chain.

The '''Conference of the Committee on Disarmament''' was a [[United Nations]] [[disarmament]] committee authorized by a [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] resolution. It began work in 1969 as the successor to the [[Eighteen Nation Committee on Disarmament]].

==History==
The Conference of the Committee on Disarmament (CCD) succeeded the Eighteen Nation Committee Disarmament (ENCD) as the U.N.'s disarmament committee in 1969.&lt;ref name=mango&gt;[[Edmund Osmańczyk|Osmańczyk, Edmund Jan]] and Mango, Anthony. ''Encyclopedia of the United Nations and International Agreements: A to F'', ([https://books.google.com/books?id=M734r1ZXW2cC&amp;pg=PA434&amp;dq=Conference+of+the+Committee+on+Disarmament&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=pGQtTI64Bsb9nAfK0MmNBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Conference%20of%20the%20Committee%20on%20Disarmament&amp;f=false Google Books link]), Taylor &amp; Francis, 2003 p. 434,({{ISBN|0415939216}}).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the name change General Assembly Resolution 2602(XXIV) expanded the membership from the ENDC's 18 to the new CCD's 26.&lt;ref name=mango/&gt; The CCD was enlarged again by the General Assembly from 26 to 31 nations in 1975.&lt;ref name=fartash&gt;Fartash, Manoutchehr.

''The Oxford Handbook on the United Nations'', ([https://books.google.com/books?id=CRDQy1thH-sC&amp;pg=PA291&amp;dq=%22Conference+of+the+Committee+on+Disarmament%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=13ctTPvhApKjnQeL25CIBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwBDge#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Conference%20of%20the%20Committee%20on%20Disarmament%22&amp;f=false Google Books link]), Oxford University Press, 2007, pp. 291-92, ({{ISBN|0199279519}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Member nations==
The CCD included the original members of the [[Ten Nation Committee on Disarmament]] (TNCD) as well as the eight additional member nations of the ENCD.&lt;ref name=legault2/&gt;&lt;ref name=legault3&gt;Legault, p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; The ENCD actually only included the participation of seventeen nations, as France did not participate in an official capacity. However, they were involved in an unofficial role in consultations with the other Western representatives.&lt;ref name=legault/&gt; While France was an original member of the ENCD, it again chose not to participate in the negotiations or sessions of the CCD.&lt;ref name=barnaby&gt;[[Frank Barnaby|Barnaby, Frank]].

Nations added to CCD (1969): [[Argentina]], [[Morocco]], [[Japan]], [[Hungary]], [[Mongolia]], [[Netherlands]], [[Pakistan]], [[Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref name=mango/&gt;

Nations added to the CCD (1975): [[Federal Republic of Germany]] ([[West Germany]]), [[German Democratic Republic]], [[Peru]], [[Iran]], [[Zaire]].&lt;ref name=fartash/&gt;

==Results and legacy== 
The CCD (1969–1979) was one of several predecessors to the current UN disarmament organization, the [[Conference on Disarmament]] (CD).&lt;ref name=unog&gt;"[http://www.unog.ch/80256EE600585943/(httpPages)/2D415EE45C5FAE07C12571800055232B?OpenDocument Disarmament]", The United Nations Office at Geneva, United Nations, 2009, accessed July 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The ENCD (1962–69) followed the short-lived Ten Nation Committee on Disarmament (1960), and was succeeded by the CCD (1969–78) until the CD was formed in 1979.&lt;ref name=unog/&gt;

Discussions in the CCD played a role in the interpretation of the [[Geneva Protocol]]. The United States had argued that the Protocol did not apply to non-toxic gases and [[herbicide]]s, prompting the [[UN Secretary-General]] to request a "clear affirmation" that the Protocol prohibited the use of all [[Chemical agent|chemical]] and [[biological agent]]s. Most member nations of the CCD agreed that it did and discussions ultimately led to a UN General Assembly resolution affirming that the use of all chemical and biological agents in war was against [[international law]].&lt;ref name=graham&gt;Graham, Thomas. ''Disarmament Sketches: Three Decades of Arms Control and International Law'', ([https://books.google.com/books?id=SNxp-gqDb1EC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=%22Conference+of+the+Committee+on+Disarmament%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2HEtTJQyhpGfB8GWndUD&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Conference%20of%20the%20Committee%20on%20Disarmament%22&amp;f=false Google Books link]), University of Washington Press, 2002, pp. 22–23, ({{ISBN|0295982128}}).&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution eventually passed 80–3; the U.S. voted "no" and 36 nations abstained.&lt;ref name=graham/&gt;

'''''Eesti Aeg''''' ({{lang-et|Time of Estonia}}) was a newspaper in the [[Republic of Estonia]], published as a weekly [[broadsheet]] newspaper in 1991&amp;ndash;1995 and four issues as a monthly newsmagazine in 1996.  One of the first truly independent (of the Soviet ruling [[clique]] influences) newspapers, it was set up in 1991 after a [[mass exodus]] of staff from [[Eesti Ekspress]] after its Soviet parent company, [[Cross Development FSP]], fired [[Hans H. Luik]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Eesti Ekspress]] 22 March 2007: [http://paber.ekspress.ee/viewdoc/C8CB430C4D282789C22572A500369B1B Nädalalõpu lemmiku teekond hotellitoast aktsiaturule] by [[Tiina Jõgeda]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The newspaper was known for its courageous approach to journalism, for example by gathering fame through publishing a list of [[KGB]] collaborationist in Estonia.

It is still considered one of the best [[Central Europe]]an schools of architecture, offering academic education in the fields of architecture, interior design, urban design, graphic design, product design, as well as professional research in the areas.

Enrolment entails an entrance exam. Each year 135 regular and 45 part-time students are accepted. There are almost 700 students enrolled in the graduate course.

The teaching and associate staff includes some 65 employees.

Since the year 2000, within students exchange [[Erasmus programmes]] there are annually 50 incoming (each year increasing) and around 40 outgoing students (both exchanges and placements).

==Building==
In the 1950s, [[Jože Plečnik]] added the front gate to the building after the school moved to the present location.

HealthMap is used both as an early detection system and supports [[situation awareness|situational awareness]] by providing current, highly local information about outbreaks, even from areas relatively invisible to traditional global public health efforts. Currently, HealthMap monitors information sources in English, Chinese, Spanish, Russian, French, Portuguese, and Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson R (2008).

In March 2014, the Healthmap software tracked early press and social media reports of a hemorrhagic fever in West Africa, subsequently identified by WHO as Ebola. The HealthMap team subsequently created a dedicated HealthMap visualization at [https://healthmap.org/ebola/ healthmap.org/ebola].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Associated Press|title=Online tool nailed Ebola epidemic|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/08/healthmap-ebola-outbreak-109881.html?hp=l8|website=www.politico.com|publisher=Politico|accessdate=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How an algorithm detected the Ebola outbreak a week early, and what it could do next|url=http://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-an-algorithm-detected-the-ebola-outbreak-a-week-early-and-what-it-could-do-next/|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''I Corps (South Korea)''' was created July 24, 1950, just before the [[Battle of Pusan Perimeter]].

I Corps consisted of the [[8th Infantry Division (South Korea)|8th Infantry Division]] and the [[Capital Division (South Korea)|Capital Division]].

During the battle of the Pusan Perimeter (July–September, 1950), its headquarters was at [[Sangju]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.history.army.mil/brochures/KW-Outbreak/outbreak.htm | title = The Korean War: The Outbreak| publisher = [[United States Army Center of Military History]]| first = William J.| last =Webb| id = CMH Pub 19-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, I Corps is the largest corps in the [[Republic of Korea Army|ROK Army]]. I Corps is organized with three infantry divisions, one mechanized infantry division, and several separate brigades.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/rok/i-corps.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Korean War ==
=== Wonsan (1950) ===
Under the direction of U.S. Army General Walker, the ROK I Corps participated in the crossing of the 38th parallel on October 1, 1950. They rushed north to the North Korean port of Wonsan on October 10, 1950. Leaving parts of their force in Wonsan, the I Corps also went west. The U.S. Army X Corps under the command of General MacArthur had planned a second amphibious landing at Wonsan but after the ROK I Corps victory there, no assault was needed. The X Corps walked ashore. U.S General Almond then added the ROK I Corps to his command.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Overview of the Korean War -  Korean War Project|url = http://www.koreanwar.org/html/kdata/overview_of_the_war.htm|website = www.koreanwar.org|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clearing North Korea (1950) ===
After adding the ROK I corps to his command, General Almond used them to clear northeastern North Korea. Columns of troops were sent up over the mountains to clear and maintain the coast towards the Yalu River and Changjin Reservoir.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Fighting the Chinese ===
In November 1950, the I Corps fought at Sudong against the Chinese. Along with the help of the United States Marine corps, they were able to defeat the Chinese and cause at least 662 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Battle of the Chosin Reservoir {{!}} Korean War|url = http://www.britannica.com/event/Battle-of-the-Chosin-Reservoir|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shango of the Oyo Empire==
[[File:Yoruba Shango.jpg|thumb|Statue of Shango, the [[Yorùbá mythology|Yoruba]] orisha of thunder]]

[[Shango]] was the fourth king of the [[Oyo Kingdom|Oyo]] clan in Yorubaland who brought prosperity to the Empire he inherited. Many stories have been told about him, and several myths surround him. He stands as the cornerstone of many Afro-Caribbean religions.

In the [[Yoruba religion]], '''Shango''' ('''Xangô''' or '''Changó''' in [[Latin America]]), is perhaps the most popular [[Orisha]]. He is the orisha of [[thunder]] and one of the principal ancestors of the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] people. In the Santeria religion of the Caribbean, Shango is considered to be the focal point as he represents the [[Oyo Empire|Oyos]] of West Africa. The Oyo empire sold a lot of people to the Atlantic slave trade who then took them to the Caribbean and South America. It is primarily for this reason that every major Orisha initiation ceremony performed in the New World within the past few hundred years has been based on the traditional Shango ceremony of Ancient Oyo. Such ceremonies survived the [[Middle Passage]] and are considered to be the most complete traditional practices to have arrived on American shores.

Shango's sacred colors are '''red'' and ''white''; his sacred number is ''6''; his symbol is the ''[[double-axe|oshe]]'', which represents swift and balanced justice. He is owner of the ''bata'' (3 double-headed drums) and of music in general, as well as the art of dance.

Shango is venerated in [[Santería]], [[Candomblé Ketu]], [[Umbanda]], and [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://religion-cults.com/art/chango.htm Shango syncretism] - religion-cults.com {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061030223853/http://religion-cults.com/art/chango.htm |date=October 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In art, Shango is depicted with a double-axe on his three heads. He is associated with the holy animal, the [[ram (sheep)|ram]].

==Shaka  Zulu==

[[File:Jaja of Opobo.jpg|right|220px|thumb|Jaja of Opobo]]

'''Shaka''' (sometimes spelled '''Tshaka''', '''Tchaka''' or '''Chaka'''; c. 1787 – c. 22 September 1828) was a [[Zulu people|Zulu]] leader.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackhistorypages.net/pages/shaka.php Blackhistorypages.net]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.nbufront.org/html/MastersMuseums/JHClarke/HistoricalPersonalities/hp18.html NBUfront.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208050343/http://www.nbufront.org/html/MastersMuseums/JHClarke/HistoricalPersonalities/hp18.html |date=February 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is widely credited with transforming the Zulu tribe from a small clan into the beginnings of a nation that held sway over the large portion of Southern Africa that stretches between the [[Phongolo River|Phongolo]] and [[Mzimkhulu River|Mzimkhulu]] rivers. His military prowess and destructiveness have been widely studied by modern scholarship. One ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' article (Macropaedia Article "Shaka" 1974 ed) asserts that he was something of a military genius for his reforms and innovations. Other writers take a more limited view of his achievements. Nevertheless, his statesmanship and vigour in assimilating some neighbours and ruling by proxy marks him as one of the greatest of the Zulu chieftains.

==King Jaja of Opobo==
{{main|Jaja of Opobo}}

King Jaja of Opobo (1821–1891)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=David, Emru |author2=Tamu Townsend |url=http://www.blackhistorypages.net/pages/jaja.php |title=King Jaja of Opobo |publisher=Blackhistorypages.net |date= |accessdate=2010-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early life, Jubo Jubogha===
Born in [[Igboland]] and sold as a slave to a Bonny trader at the age of twelve, he was named Jubo Jubogha by his first master. He was later sold to Chief Alali, the powerful head of the Opobu Manila Group of Houses. Called Jaja by the British, this gifted and enterprising individual eventually became one of the most powerful men in the eastern Niger Delta.

===The Niger Delta===
The Niger Delta, where the Niger empties itself into the [[Gulf of Guinea]] in a system of intricate waterways, was the site of unique settlements called city-states.

From the 15th to the 18th centuries, Bonny, like the other city-states, gained its wealth from the profits of the [[slave trade]]. Here, an individual could attain prestige and power through success in business and, as in the case of Jaja, a slave could work his way up to head of state. The House was a socio-political institution and was the basic unit of the city-state.

In the 19th century—after the abolition of the slave trade in 1807—the trade in slaves was supplanted by the trade in palm oil, which was so vibrant that the region was named the Oil Rivers area.

The Houses in Bonny and other city-states controlled both the internal and external palm oil trade because the producers in the hinterland were forbidden to trade directly with the Europeans on the coast; the Europeans never left the coast for fear of malaria.

===The rise of King Jaja===
Astute in business and politics, Jaja became the head of the Anna Pepple House, extending its activities and influence by absorbing other houses, increasing operations in the hinterland and augmenting the number of European contacts. A power struggle ensued among rival factions in the houses at Bonny, leading to the breakaway of the faction led by Jaja. He established a new settlement, which he named Opobo. He became King Jaja of Opobo and declared himself independent of Bonny.

Strategically located between Bonny and the production areas of the hinterland, King Jaja controlled trade and politics in the delta. In so doing he curtailed trade at Bonny, and at the end of his ascendancy, fourteen of the eighteen Bonny houses had moved to Opobo.

In a few years, he had become so wealthy that he was shipping palm oil directly to [[Liverpool]] himself. The British consul could not tolerate this situation. Jaja was offered a treaty of "protection", in return for which the chiefs usually surrendered their sovereignty. After Jaja's initial opposition, he was reassured, in rather vague terms, that neither his authority nor the sovereignty of Opobo would be threatened.

===The fall of Jaja and scramble for Africa===
Jaja continued to regulate trade and levy duties on British traders, to the point where he ordered a cessation of trade on the river until one British firm agreed to pay duties. Jaja refused to comply with the consul's order to terminate these activities, despite British threats to bombard Opobo. Unknown to Jaja, the [[Scramble for Africa]] had taken place and Opobo was part of the territories allocated to Great Britain. This was the era of gunboat diplomacy, where Great Britain used her naval power to negotiate conditions favorable to her people.

Lured into a meeting with the British consul aboard a warship, Jaja was arrested and sent to Accra, where he was summararily tried and found guilty of "treaty breaking" and "blocking the highways of trade".

He was deported to St. Vincent ([[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]]), West Indies, and four years later, he died en route to Nigeria after he was permitted to return.

Ironically, Jaja's dogged insistence on African independence and effective resistance exposed British imperialism and made him the first victim of foreign territorial intrusion in West Africa. The fate of Jaja reverberated through the entire Niger delta. Amazed at this turn of events, the other delta chiefs quickly capitulated.

In addition, the discovery of quinine as the cure for malaria enabled the British traders to bypass the middlemen and deal directly with the palm oil producers, thus precipitating the decline of the city-states.

King Jaja's downfall ensured a victory for British supremacy, paving the way for the eventual imposition of the colonial system in this region by the end of the century.

==Askia Mohammed I (Askia the Great) of Timbuktu==
{{main|Askia Mohammad I}}

'''Mohammed Ben Abu Bekr "Askia the Great" (1538)'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.blackhistorypages.net/pages/askia.php |title=Blackhistorypages.net |access-date=2007-01-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523140527/http://www.blackhistorypages.net/pages/askia.php |archive-date=2007-05-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbufront.org/html/MastersMuseums/JHClarke/HistoricalPersonalities/hp15.html NBUfront.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070214065509/http://www.nbufront.org/html/MastersMuseums/JHClarke/HistoricalPersonalities/hp15.html |date=February 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mohammed Ben Abu Bekr, the favored general of Sunni Ali, believed that he was entitled to the throne after Sunni Ali's death, rather than Ali's son, Abu Kebr.

Claiming that the power was his by right of achievement, Mohammed attacked the new ruler a year after his acsession and defeated him in one of the bloodiest battles in history. When one of Sunni Ali's daughters heard the news, she cried out "Askia", which means "forceful one." This title was taken by Mohammed as his [[regnal name]].

Askia began by consolidating his vast empire and establishing harmony among the conflicting religions and political elements. Under the leadership of Askia, the [[Songhay Empire]] flourished until it became one of the richest empires of that period, from any region. [[Timbuktu|Timbuctoo]] became known as "The Center of Learning", "The Mecca of the Sudan", and "The Queen of the Sudan".

[[File:Askia.jpg|left|thumb|250px|right|Tomb of Askia]]
With his empire firmly established, Askia resumed his attack on the ''unbelievers'', carrying the rule of Islam into new lands.
[[Askia the Great]] made '''[[Timbuktu]]''' ([[English language|Archaic English]]: ''Timbuctoo''; [[Koyra Chiini language|Koyra Chiini]]: ''Tumbutu''; {{lang-fr|Tombouctou}}) one of the most famous centers of commerce and learning on Earth. The brilliance of the city was such that it still shines in the imagination after three centuries like a star which, though dead, continues to send its light toward us.

Such was its splendor that in spite of its many vicissitudes after the death of Askia, the vitality of [[Timbuktu]] is not extinguished.

===The Empire===
[[File:WestAfrica1625.png|left|thumb|300px|Oyo Empire and surrounding states, c. 1625.]]

The '''Oyo Empire''' (c. 1400&amp;ndash;1835) was a [[West Africa]]n empire of present-day [[Nigeria]]. The empire was established by the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] in the 15th century and grew to become one of the largest West African states encountered by colonial explorers. It rose to pre-eminence through wealth gained from trade and its possession of a powerful [[cavalry]]. The Oyo Empire was the most politically important state in the region from the mid-17th to the late 18th century, holding sway not only over other Yoruba kingdoms in modern-day [[Nigeria]], [[Benin]], and [[Togo]], but also over other African kingdoms, most notable being the [[Fon people|Fon]] [[Kingdom of Dahomey|Dahomey]] (in present-day Benin).

===Mythical origins===
The mythical origins of the Oyo Empire lie with [[Oranyan]] (also known as Oranmiyan), the second prince of the Yoruba Kingdom of Ile-Ife. Oranyan made an agreement with his brother to launch a punitive raid on their northern neighbors for insulting their father, the [[Oba (ruler)|Oba]] Oduduwa, first of the Oonis of Ife. On the way to the battle, the brothers quarrelled and the army split up.&lt;ref name="Stride290"&gt;Stride &amp; Ifeka 1971 p.&amp;nbsp;290&lt;/ref&gt; Oranyan's force was too small to make a successful attack, so he wandered the southern shore until reaching Bussa. There the local chief entertained him and provided a large snake with a magic charm attached to its throat. The chief instructed Oranyan to follow the snake until it stopped somewhere for seven days and disappeared into the ground. Oranyan followed the advice and founded Oyo where the serpent stopped. The site is remembered as [[Ajaka]]. Oranyan made Oyo his new kingdom and became the first "oba" (meaning 'king' or 'ruler' in the [[Yoruba language]]) with the title of "Alaafin of Oyo" (Alaafin means 'owner of the palace' in Yoruba), leaving all his treasures in Ife and allowing another king named Adimu to rule there in his stead.&lt;ref name="Stride291"&gt;Stride &amp; Ifeka 1971, p.&amp;nbsp;291&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early period===
[[File:OyoIle plan bw.gif|thumb|right|150px|A Survey of Old Oyo Palace Compound]]

Oranyan, the first oba of Oyo, was succeeded by Oba Ajaka, Alaafin of Oyo. Ajaka was deposed because he was seen to be lacking Yoruba military virtues and allowing his sub-chiefs too much independence. Leadership was then conferred upon Ajaka's brother, Jakuta, who was later deified as the deity Shango. Ajaka was restored after Shango's death. Ajaka returned to the throne thoroughly more warlike and oppressive. His successor, Kori, managed to conquer the rest of what later historians would refer to as metropolitan Oyo.&lt;ref name="Stride291"/&gt;

===Oyo-Ile===
The heart of metropolitan Oyo was its capital at Oyo-Ile, (also known as ''Katunga'', ''Old Oyo'', or Oyo-oro).&lt;ref name="Goddard"&gt;Goddard 1971, pp.&amp;nbsp;207-211.&lt;/ref&gt;  The two most important structures in Oyo-Ile were the 'afin', or palace of the Oba, and his market. The palace was at the center of the city, close to the Oba's market which was called 'Oja-oba'. Around the capital was a tall earthen wall for defense with 17 gates. The importance of the two large structures (the palace and the Oja Oba) signified the importance of the king in Oyo.

{{main|Ashanti people}}
[[File:Gold Coast Map 1896.jpg|thumb|right|Map of the Ashanti Region within Ghana]]

The '''Ashanti''', or '''Asante''', are a major [[ethnic group]] in modern [[Ghana]].  The Ashanti speak [[Twi]], an [[Akan languages|Akan language]] similar to [[Fante language|Fante]]. For the Ashanti (Asante) Confederacy, see [[Asanteman]].

Prior to European colonization, the Ashanti people developed a large and influential empire in West Africa.  The Ashanti later created the powerful Ashanti Confederacy and became the dominant presence in the region.

The [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]], [[Adansi]], [[Akyem]], [[Assin]], and [[Denkyira]] peoples of [[Ghana]], like the [[Baule]] of [[Côte d'Ivoire]], are subgroups of the West African [[Akan people|Akan]] nation which is said to have migrated from the vicinity of the north-western [[Niger River]] after the fall of the [[Ghana Empire]] in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acona-usacanada.org/asantehistory1.html|title=Asantes Of Ghana History|last=Boateng|first=Agyenim|date=|website=Asanteman Council Of North America ACONA -USA Canada|publisher=|accessdate=October 22, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224011728/http://acona-usacanada.org/asantehistory1.html|archivedate=February 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of this is seen in royal courts of the Akan kings reflected by that of the Ashanti kings whose processions and ceremonies show remnants of ancient Ghana ceremonies.  [[Ethnolinguistics|Ethnolinguists]] have substantiated the migration by tracing word usage and speech patterns along West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/history/ History of Ghana&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, although the Ghana Empire was geographically different from present-day Ghana, some of its people, specifically the Akan, moved to what is today Ghana, hence the historicity of the name. In fact, the North African [[Almoravid dynasty]] gold coin was renowned throughout the medieval world as being made of the purest of golds, since West African gold was 92 percent pure at the time it was mined, higher than old Egyptian gold ore, which started at 85 percent, a figure which was later refined to 95 percent. Evidence of early Ashanti connections to the Islamic world is the Ashanti word for money &amp;ndash; "sikka" &amp;ndash; the same as the Arabic word for minting money.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-Ashanti.html Ashanti - Encyclopedia.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bambara Empire==
{{main|Bambara Empire}}
[[File:Mali historic places.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Some of the cities in Mali which were under the control of the Bambara Empire.]]

The '''Bamana Empire''' (also '''Bambara Empire''' or '''Ségou Empire''') was a large pre-colonial West African state based at [[Ségou]], now in [[Mali]].  It was ruled by the Kulubali or Coulibaly dynasty established circa 1640 by Fa Sine also known as Biton-si-u. The empire existed as a centralized state from 1712 to the 1861 invasion of [[Toucouleur people|Toucouleur]] conqueror El Hadj [[Umar Tall]].

The Bambara Empire was structured around traditional Bambara institutions, including the ''kòmò'', a body to resolve [[theology|theological]] concerns.  The ''kòmò'' often consulted religious sculptures prior to making their decisions, particularly the four state ''boliw'', large altars designed to aid the acquisition of political power.

In the Battle of Noukouma, in 1818, Bambara forces met and were defeated by Fula Muslim fighters rallied by the jihad of [[Cheikou Amadu]] (or Seku Amadu) of Massina.  The Bambara Empire survived but was irreversibly weakened.  Seku Amadu's forces decisively defeated the Bambara, taking [[Djenné]] and much of the territory around [[Mopti]], and forming it into a [[Massina Empire]].  Timbuktu would fall as well in 1845.

The real end of the empire, however, came at the hands of El Hadj [[Umar Tall]], a Toucouleur conqueror who swept across West Africa from [[Dinguiraye]]. Umar Tall's [[mujahideen]] readily defeated the Bambara, seizing Ségou itself on March 10, 1861, forcing the population to convert to [[Islam]], and declaring an end to the Bambara Empire (which effectively became part of the newly declared [[Toucouleur Empire]]).

==Mali Empire==
{{main|Mali Empire}}
[[File:MALI empire map.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Mali Empire.]]
[[File:Great Mosque of Djenné 1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Rebuilt [[Mosque of Djenné]]]]

The '''Mali Empire''' or '''Manding Empire''' or '''Manden Kurufa''' was a [[medieval]] West African state of the [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] from 1235 to 1645. The empire was founded by [[Sundiata Keita]] and became renowned for the [[wealth]] of its rulers, especially [[Mansa (title)|Mansa]] [[Mansa Musa|Musa I]]. The Mali Empire had many profound cultural influences on West Africa, allowing the spread of its language, laws and customs along the [[Niger River]].

The Mali Empire grew out of an area referred to by its contemporary inhabitants as Manden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=fr&amp;u=http://www.manden.org/article.php3%3Fid_article%3D2&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3DFarin,%2BMali%2BEmpire%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D |title=Google Translate |publisher=Translate.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manden, named for its inhabitants the Mandinka (initially Manden’ka with "ka" meaning people of),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fakoli.net/nko/tutorial/intro.html |title=N'ko Language - Tutorial |publisher=Fakoli.net |date=2001-02-20 |accessdate=2010-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; comprised most of present-day northern [[Guinea]] and southern [[Mali]].  The empire was originally established as a federation of Mandinka tribes called the Manden Kurufa (literally Manden Federation), but it later became an empire ruling millions of people from nearly every ethnic group imaginable in West Africa.

The naming origins of the Mali Empire are complex and still debated in scholarly circles around the world.  While the meaning of "Mali" is still contested, the process of how it entered the regional lexicon is not.  As mentioned earlier, the Mandinka of the [[Middle Ages]] referred to their ethnic homeland as "Manden".

Among the many different ethnic groups surrounding Manden were [[Pulaar]] speaking groups in [[Macina, Mali|Macina]], [[Tekrur]] and [[Fouta Djallon]]. In Pulaar, the Mandinka of Manden became the [[Malinke]] of Mali.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.cocc.edu/cagatucci/classes/hum211/CoursePack/coursepackpast/sundjata.htm The Epic of Sundjata] Humanities Department, Central Oregon Community College&lt;/ref&gt;

So while the Mandinka people generally referred to their land and capital province as Manden, its semi-nomadic Fula subjects residing on the heartland's western (Tekrur), southern (Fouta Djallon) and eastern borders (Macina) popularized the name Mali for this kingdom and later empire of the Middle Ages.

The Mandinka kingdoms of Mali or Manden had already existed several centuries before Sundiata's unification as a small state just to the south of the [[Soninke people|Soninké]] empire of [[Wagadou]], better known as the [[Ghana Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=fr&amp;u=http://www.soninkara.org/histoire-soninkara/wagadou/recherches/index.php&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3DWagadou,%2BGhana%2BEmpire%26hl%3Den Wagadou or Empire of Ghana] Translated from French. Soninkara.org {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This area was composed of mountains, savannah and forests, providing ideal protection and resources for the population of hunters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=fr&amp;u=http://www.histoire-afrique.org/article73.html%3Fartsuite%3D4&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dmalimassa%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D History of Africa] translated from French {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Those not living in the mountains formed small city-states such as Toron, Ka-Ba and [[Niani, Mali|Niani]].

The Keita dynasty from which nearly every Mali emperor came traces its lineage back to [[Bilal ibn Ribah|Bilal]],&lt;ref name=sundiata&gt;Niane, D.T: "Sundiata: An Epic of Old Mali". Longman, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; the faithful [[muezzin]] of Islam's prophet [[Muhammad]].  It was common practice during the Middle Ages for both [[Christian]] and [[Muslim]] rulers to tie their bloodline back to a pivotal figure in their faith's history.  So while the lineage of the Keita dynasty may be dubious at best, oral chroniclers have preserved a list of each Keita ruler from Lawalo (supposedly one of Bilal's seven sons whom settled in Mali) to Maghan Kon Fatta (father of Sundiata Keita).

[http://www.historywiz.com/ife.htm Ife]&lt;/ref&gt; Ile-Ife, also known as Ife, is the holy city of the Yoruba people, a large proportion of which live in Nigeria in West Africa. Ile-Ife appears in myths as the birthplace of life and the location where the first humans sprang forth.

===The myth - Where the world began===
According to Yoruba mythology, the world was originally a marshy, watery wasteland. In the sky above lived many gods, including the supreme God Olodumare. These gods sometimes descended from the sky on spiderwebs and played in the marshy waters, but there was no land or human being there.

One day Olorun called orisha-nla (the great god) Obatala, and told him to create solid land in the marshy waters below. He gave the Orisha a pigeon, a hen, and the shell of a snail containing some loose earth. Obatala descended to the waters and threw the loose earth into a small space. He then set loose the pigeon and hen, which began to scratch the earth and move it around. Soon the birds had covered a large area of the marshy waters and created solid ground.

The Orisha reported back to Olorun, who sent a chameleon to see what had been accomplished. The chameleon found that the earth was wide but not very dry. After a while, Olorun sent the creature to inspect the work again. This time the chameleon discovered a wide, dry land, which was called Ife (meaning "wide") and Ile (meaning "house"). All other earthly dwellings later evolved from colonies of Ile-Ife, and it was revered forever after as a sacred spot. It remains the home of the Oni, the spiritual leader of the Yoruba.

===Ancient history===
The peoples who lived in Yorubaland, at least by the 4th century BCE, were not initially known as the Yoruba, although they shared a common language group. Both archaeology and traditional Yoruba oral historians confirm the existence of people in this region for several millennia. Yoruba spiritual heritage maintains that the Yoruba clans are a unique people who were originally created at Ile-Ife.

Legend holds that the creation was delegated by the supreme spiritual force, Olodumare, as stated above. This task, which was first attributed to orisha-nla Obatala may have actually been conducted by the Orishas [[Oduduwa]] and [[Eshu]], who himself served as the divine messenger.

The name "Yoruba" is most likely an adaptation of 'Yo ru ebo', meaning "will venerate (make offerings to the) Orisha". This refers to the Aborisha spiritual religion of the Yoruba, which existed for centuries prior to Islamic and Christian proselytism. The Yoruba civilization remains one of the most technologically and artistically advanced in West Africa to this time.

===Oduduwa===
Some contemporary historians contend that the Yoruba are not indigenous to Yorubaland, but are descendants of immigrants to the region. This version of history contends that Oduduwa was, in fact, a mortal king, from Arabia, under whose leadership the Oyo region of Yorubaland was conquered sometime in the 11th century and the kingdom of Ife as it is currently constituted was established. Oduduwa's relatives established kingdoms in the rest of Yorubaland.

One of Oduduwa's sons, Oranmiyan, took the throne of Benin and expanded the Oduduwa Dynasty eastwards. Further expansion led to the establishment of the Yoruba in what are now Southwest Nigeria, Benin, and Togo, with Yoruba city-states acknowledging the spiritual primacy of the ancient city of Ile Ife. The southeastern Benin Empire, ruled by a dynasty that traced its ancestry to Ifẹ and Oduduwa but largely populated by the Edo and other related ethnicities, also held considerable sway in the election of nobles and kings in eastern Yorubaland.

==The Benin Kingdom, Benin City&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060814005827/http://blackhistorypages.net/pages/fallbenin.php The Fall of Benin City]&lt;/ref&gt;==
{{main|Kingdom of Benin|Benin City}}

Founded around the 10th century, Benin served as the capital of the [[Kingdom of Benin]], the empire of the [[Oba of Benin]], which flourished from the 14th through the 17th century. No trace remains of the structures admired by European travellers to the Great Benin because the kingdom was looted, blown up and razed to the ground by British forces for their resistance to colonial rule, though the fabled [[Walls of Benin]] have been undergoing preservation and restoration procedures for years. After Benin was visited by the Portuguese in 1472, historical Benin grew rich during the 16th and 17th centuries through the export of some tropical products.

The [[Bight of Benin]]'s shore was part of the so-called "[[Slave Coast of West Africa|Slave Coast]]", from where many West Africans were sold (usually by local rulers) to foreign slave traders. In the early 16th century the Oba sent an ambassador to [[Lisbon]], and the [[King of Portugal]] sent [[Christian]] [[missionaries]] to Benin. Some residents of Benin could still speak a [[pidgin]] Portuguese in the late 19th century.

To preserve Benin's independence, bit by bit the Oba banned the export of goods from Benin, until the trade was exclusively in palm oil.

On 1 February 1852, the whole [[Bight of Benin]] became a British protectorate where a [[Consul (representative)]] represented the protector, until on the 6th of August, 1861, the Bights of Biafra and Benin became a united British protectorate, again under a British Consul.

In the "[[Punitive Expedition]]" of 1897, a 1200-strong British force, under the command of Admiral [[Sir Harry Rawson]], conquered and burned the city, destroying much of the country's treasured art and dispersing nearly all that remained. Due to this the "[[Benin Bronzes]]": portrait figures, busts, and groups created in [[iron]], carved [[ivory]], and especially in [[brass]] (conventionally called "bronze"), are on display in [[museum]]s around the world. A scattered catalogue of some 2,500 pieces, the collection arguably constitutes the most argued over pool of antiquities after the disputed treasures of [[Ancient Egypt]] itself.
After the fall of Benin, the British set apart [[Warri]] province in a bid to punish the Oba and curb his imperial power. The Benin monarchy was restored in 1914, but true power now lay with the colonial administration of Nigeria. The defeat, capture and subjugation of the empire's war-like people marked the sovereign end of one of Africa's greatest medieval states.

==Queen Amina of Zaria&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackhistorypages.net/pages/amina.php Queen Amina of Zaria]&lt;/ref&gt;==
{{main|Amina}}

The seven original states of [[Hausa Kingdoms|Hausaland]]: [[Katsina Emirate|Katsina]], [[Daura Emirate|Daura]], [[Kano Emirate|Kano]], [[Zazzau Emirate|Zazzau]], [[Gobir]], Rano, and Garun Gabas cover an area of approximately {{convert|500|sqmi|km2|order=flip}} and comprise the heart of the Hausa realm. In the 16th century, Queen Bakwa Turunku built the capital of Zazzau at Zaria, named after her younger daughter. Eventually, the entire state of Zazzau was renamed Zaria, which is now a province and traditional kingdom in present-day Nigeria.

However, it was her elder daughter, the legendary Amina (or Aminatu), who inherited her mother's warlike nature. Amina was 16 years old when her mother became queen and she was given the traditional title of ''Magajiya'', an honorific borne by the daughters of monarchs. She honed her military skills and became famous for her bravery and military exploits, as she is celebrated in song as "Amina, daughter of Nikatau, a woman as capable as a man."

Amina is credited as the architectural overseer who created the strong earthen walls that surround her city, which were the prototype for the fortifications used in all Hausa states. She subsequently built many of these fortifications, which became known as ganuwar Amina or Amina's walls, around various conquered cities.

The objectives of her conquests were twofold: extension of her nation beyond its primary borders and reducing the conquered cities to a vassal status. Sultan Muhammad Bello of [[Sokoto]] stated that, "She made war upon these countries and overcame them entirely so that the people of Katsina paid tribute to her and the men of Kano and... also made war on cities of Bauchi till her kingdom reached to the sea in the south and the west." Likewise, she led her armies as far as [[Nupe Kingdom|Nupe]] and, according to the Kano Chronicle, "The Sarkin Nupe sent her (i.e. the princess) 40 eunuchs and 10,000 kola nuts. She was the first in Hausaland to own eunuchs and [[kola nut]]s."{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Amina was a pre-eminent gimbiya (princess) but various theories exist as to the time of her reign or if she ever was a queen. One explanation states that she reigned from approximately 1536 to 1573, while another posits that she became queen after her brother Karama's death, in 1576. Yet another claims that although she was a leading princess and de facto ruler, she was never a titular queen.

Despite the discrepancies in the tale of her life, one thing is certain, over a 34-year period, her many conquests and subsequent annexation of the territories conquered extended the borders of Zaria, which also grew in importance as a result and which became the center of the North-South Saharan trade and the East-West Sudan trade.

==Makeda, The Queen of Sheba (960 BC)==
{{main|Makeda}}

The '''Queen of Sheba''', ([[Arabic]] '''Malekat sabaa''' '''ملكة سبأ''', [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]]: '''Nigista Saba''' '''ንግሥተ ሳባ''', [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]]: '''Ayaba ile Seba'''), referred to in the [[Bible]] books of 1 [[Books of Kings|Kings]] and 2 [[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]], the [[New Testament]], the [[Qur'an]], [[Ethiopia]]n history and even the tribal traditions of the [[Yoruba people]] of West Africa, was the ruler of [[Sheba]], an ancient kingdom which modern [[archaeology]] speculates was located in present-day [[Yemen]] or [[Eritrea]], [[Ethiopia]].

Unnamed in the Biblical text, she is called '''Makeda''' ([[Ge'ez alphabet|Ge'ez]]: ማክዳ ''mākidā'') in the Ethiopian tradition, and in Islamic tradition her name is '''Bilqis'''. In some books she is referred to as '''Belkis'''. Alternative names given for her have been '''Nikaule''', '''Nicaula''' and '''Bilikisu Sungbon'''. She supposedly lived in the 10th century BC.

She is better known to the world as the '''[[Queen of Sheba]]'''.

In his book, "World's Great Men of Color", J.A. Rogers, gives this description: "Out of the mists of three thousand years, emerges this beautiful story of a Black Queen, who attracted by the fame of a Judean monarch, made a long journey to see him."{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The Queen of Sheba is said to have undertaken a long and difficult journey to Jerusalem, in order to learn of the wisdom of the great King Solomon. Makeda and King Solomon were equally impressed with each other. Out of their relationship was born a son, according to the Ethiopian Book of the Glory of Kings, Menelik I.

This Queen is said to have reigned over Sheba and Arabia as well as Ethiopia. The queen of Sheba's capital was Debra Makeda, which she built for herself.

In Ethiopia's church of Axum, there is a copy of what is said to be one of the Tables of Law that Solomon gave to Menelik I.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The story of the Queen of Sheba is deeply cherished in Ethiopia as part of the national heritage. This African Queen serves as one of the exclusive group of people that appear in the traditions of several different religions, with her being mentioned in two holy books- the Bible and the Koran.

==Usman dan Fodio==
{{main|Uthman Dan Fodio}}

'''Shaihu Usman dan Fodio''' ({{lang-ar|عثمان بن فودي ، عثمان دان فوديو}}) (also referred to as '''Shaikh Usman Ibn Fodio''', Shehu Uthman Dan Fuduye, or '''Shehu Usman dan Fodio''', 1754&amp;ndash;1817) was a writer, preacher, Islamic reformer and [[Sultan of Sokoto]]. Dan Fodio was one of a class of urbanized ethnic [[Fula people|Fulani]] living in the [[Hausa people|Hausa]] city-states in what is today northern [[Nigeria]]. He lived in the city-state of [[Gobir]], and is considered an Islamic revivalist; he encouraged the education of women in religious matters, and several of his daughters emerged as scholars and writers (with the most prominent of them being the Princess [[Nana Asmau]]).

Dan Fodio was well-educated in classical Islamic science, philosophy and theology, and became a revered religious thinker in his own right. His teacher, Jibril ibn 'Umar, argued that it was the duty and within the power of religious movements to establish the ideal society, free from oppression and vice. Dan Fodio used his influence to secure approval to create a religious community in his hometown of [[Degel]] that would, or so he hoped, be a model town.

After the [[Fulani War]], he became the reigning commander of the largest state in the Africa of its day, the [[Fulani Empire]]. Dan Fodio worked to establish an efficient government, one grounded in Islamic law. Already aged at the beginning of the war, he retired in 1815 and passed the title of [[Sokoto Caliphate|Sultan of Sokoto]] to his son, [[Muhammed Bello]].

Dan Fodio's uprising inspired a number of later [[West African]] [[jihad]]s, including those of [[Massina Empire]] founder [[Seku Amadu]], [[Toucouleur Empire]] founder El Hadj [[Umar Tall]] (who married one of dan Fodio's granddaughters), [[Wassoulou Empire]] founder [[Samori Ture|Samori]], and [[Adamawa Emirate]] founder [[Modibo Adama]], who served as one of dan Fodio's provincial chiefs.

==Queen Nzingha of Ndongo (1582&amp;ndash;1663)==
{{main|Nzinga of Ndongo and Matamba}}

'''Ann Nzingha "Queen of Ndongo" (1582–1663)'''

In the 16th century, the Portuguese stake in the slave trade was threatened by England and France. This caused the Portuguese to transfer their slave-trading activities southward to the Congo and South West Africa. Their most stubborn opposition, as they entered the final phase of the conquest of Angola, came from a queen who was a great head of state, and a military leader with few peers in her time.
The important facts about her life are outlined by Professor Glasgow of Bowie, Maryland:

"Her extraordinary story begins about 1582, the year of her birth. She is referred to as Nzingha, or Jinga, but is better known as Ann Nzingha. She was the sister of the then-reigning King of Ndongo, Ngoli Bbondi, whose country was later called Angola. Nzingha was from an ethnic group called the Jagas. The Jagas were an extremely militant group who formed a human shield against the Portuguese slave traders. Nzingha never accepted the Portuguese conquest of Angola, and was always on the military offensive. As part of her strategy against the invaders, she formed an alliance with the Dutch, who she intended to use to defeat the Portuguese slave traders."

In 1623, at the age of forty-one, Nzingha became Queen of Ndongo. She forbade her subjects to call her Queen, preferring to be called King, and when leading an army in battle, dressed in men's clothing.

In 1659, at the age of seventy-five, she signed a treaty with the Portuguese, bringing her no feeling of triumph. Nzingha had resisted the Portuguese most of her adult life. African bravery, however, was no match for gunpowder. This great African woman died in 1663, which was followed by the massive expansion of the Portuguese slave trade.

'''Lichtenstein's hartebeest''' (''Alcelaphus buselaphus lichtensteinii'')&lt;ref name=WilsonReeder2005&gt;Wilson, Don E. &amp; Reeder, DeeAnn M. (editors). 2005. Mammal Species of the World. A Taxonomic and Geographic Reference (3rd ed), Johns Hopkins University Press, 2,142 pp. [http://www.bucknell.edu/msw3 Available online]&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[antelope]] that dwells in [[savannah]]s and [[floodplain]]s of [[Southeast Africa|Southeastern]]&lt;ref name="Cambridge2011Selous"&gt;{{cite book |last=Selous |first=F. C. |author-link=Frederick Selous |title=Travel and Adventure in South-East Africa |chapter=XXV |page=445 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CdWemHZX4BQC&amp;pg |location=New York |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-1108031165 |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;-[[Central Africa]]. By some, this species is classified as ''Sigmoceros lichtensteinii''.

It typically stands about {{convert|1.25|m|ft|abbr=on}} at the shoulder and have a mass of around {{convert|150|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. It has a red brown colour, which is lighter on the underbelly. The horns found on both sexes appear from the side to be shaped like the letter 'S', and appear from the front to be shaped like the letter 'O' with its upper portions missing. The horns are slightly ridged and reach over {{convert|0.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length.

They live on areas where they eat [[grass]]es. They are [[diurnal animal|diurnal]] (active in the day). They gather in herds of five to 15 females and calves with a single male, which leads them. The male stands sentry duty on [[termite]] mounds and the like. Males hold large territories, which they mark by digging up soil with their horns around the borders. Lichtenstein's hartebeest have good eyesight but a poor sense of smell. Their main sounds are a bellow and a sneeze-snort sound.

It derives its name from zoologist [[Martin Lichtenstein]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12633">This is a list of all 102 of the [[ultra-prominent peak]]s (with [[topographic prominence]] greater than 1,500 metres) in [[West Asia]]. It includes peaks on the islands of Cyprus and Socotra. It also includes the 10 ultras of the [[Caucasus]] (also listed under [[List of European ultra prominent peaks#Caucasus Mountains|Europe]]) as they are geographically more connected to the mountains of West Asia. Two of these peaks (Mount Aragats and Kapudzhukh Lerr) are on the Asian side of the ridge of the Greater Caucasus, which forms the usual boundary between Europe and Asia, and four more are on the border itself and so in both Europe and Asia.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Do NOT add candies, pastries, breads, or desserts here.  There are separate "List of..." articles for these categories
that should be added to instead.

Please add entries in ALPHABETICAL ORDER, to make duplicate entries less likely.

New food entries here require a Wikilink to an EXISTING article for the food item described.  
This List article relies on the references and Talk discussion in the backup article.  If necessary, create and
add references to a backup article first, then Wikilink to it from a brief summary entry added here.

In the Description, mention the main ingredients, plus any special ingredients or other notable aspects.
DO NOT OVERLINK any common ingredients listed in the article lead, but do Wikilink DISTINCTIVE 
ingredients, flavorings, or customs.

Keep the entry concise, and use Wikilinks for any additional information with references.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Sample entry:

|[[Food_name]]
|[[File:Image_name|120px]]
|[[Country_of_origin]] ([[Region_of_origin]])
|Brief description, listing essential ingredients, plus [[distinctive ingredient]]s, [[flavoring]]s, or [[custom]]s 
that make the dish unique. It is NOT necessary to repeat the name of the food or place of origin.

'''Most Serene Republic''' (''Serenissima Respublica'' in [[Latin]]) is a title attached to a number of [[Europe]]an states through history. By custom, the appellation "Most Serene" is an indicator of sovereignty (see also [[Serene Highness]] or Most Serene Highness for a sovereign prince); consequently "Most Serene Republic" emphasizes the sovereignty of the republic.

==Modern states==
[[San Marino]] is the only modern independent state to use the style. Although officially named simply the "Republic of San Marino",&lt;ref name="cia"&gt;{{CIA World Factbook link|sm|San Marino}}&lt;/ref&gt; short form "San Marino",&lt;ref name="cia"/&gt; it is unofficially still referred to as the ''Most Serene Republic of San Marino'' ({{lang-it|Serenissima Repubblica di San Marino}}).&lt;ref name="cia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/521449/San-Marino |title=San Marino |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |year=2012 |accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical states==
*[[Republic of Venice]] ({{lang-en|the Most Serene Republic of Venice}}; {{lang-vec|Serenìsima Repùblica Vèneta}}; {{lang-it|Serenissima Repubblica di Venezia}}), a city-state that existed from 697 to 1797 based in the city of Venice with continuously controlled territory along the eastern Adriatic at its strongest period.  "La Serenissima" was also popularly used as a specific reference to the Venetian government or state authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sovereign City: The City-state Through History|last=Parker|first=G.|pages=78|publisher=Reaktion Books Ltd|location=London, UK|year=2004|isbn=9781861892195}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Republic of Genoa]] ({{lang-en|the Most Serene Republic of Genoa}}; {{lang-it|Serenissima Repubblica di Genova}}), an independent state based in present-day Liguria on the northwestern Italian coast from ca. 1100 to 1805. Long just plain "Republic", the honorific "Most Serene" was only added after the election of the first [[Doge of Genoa]] (1339). Even so, to distinguish their government from its ancient rival to the east, the Genoese rarely used the "Most Serene" designation, opting more frequently for the appellation "Superb Republic" ({{lang-it|La Superba Repubblica}}), a nickname allegedly coined by [[Petrarch]] in 1358.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Imperial Ambition in the Early Modern Mediterranean: Genoese Merchants and the Spanish Crown|pages=318|last=Dauverd|first=Céline|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|year=2014|isbn=9781107062368}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Republic of Lucca]] ({{lang-en|the Most Serene Republic of Lucca}}; {{lang-it|Serenissima Repubblica di Lucca}}), a [[city-state]] that existed from 1119 to 1799 based in the city of [[Lucca]], in northern [[Tuscany]], [[Italy]]. Lucca was the third largest Italian city state (after [[Venice]] and [[Genoa]]) with a republican constitution ("comune") to remain independent over the centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nuova geografia di Ant. Federico Busching|last=Busching|first=Federico|location=Venice, Italy|publisher=Antonio Zatta|year=1777}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] ({{lang-en|the Most Serene Republic of Poland}}; {{lang-pl|Najjaśniejsza [[Rzeczpospolita]] Polska}}, {{lang-lat|Serenissima Res Publica Poloniae}}), an [[royal election|elective monarchy]] in Central and Eastern Europe, existing from 1569 until 1795.&lt;ref name="Ferrand"&gt;{{cite book |author=Antoine-François-Claude Ferrand|title=Histoire des trois démembremens de la Pologne: pour faire suite à l'histoire de l'Anarchie de Pologne par Rulhière|year=1820|editor= |page=182 |pages= |chapter=Volume 1 | chapterurl = |publisher=Deterville|location=Paris, France|isbn=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j1kPAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|format= |accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''mtepe''' is a boat associated with the [[Swahili people]] (the word "boat" in the [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] [[Swahili language]] being ''mtepe''). The mtepe's planks are held together by wooden pegs&lt;ref&gt;A.H.J. Prins.

==Extinction==
[[File:Mtepe on the beach at Zanzibar (about 1890).png|thumb|''mtepe'' on the beach at Zanzibar, circa 1890.]]
The cessation of the production of ''mtepe'' has been ascribed to the arrival of the Portuguese in the Indian Ocean in the 15th century, leading to boat builders adopting alternative, western shipbuilding techniques.&lt;ref name="rma"&gt;Robert Marshall Adams B.A.S.

The full title was "''Ngola a Kiluanje''", which is often shortened to simply "''Ngola''", hence the name of the modern country.

'''PM2FGZ''' ([[90.0 FM]], often abbreviated 90 FM), on air name '''Elshinta News and Talk''' or '''Elshinta''', is an all-news radio in Jakarta, Indonesia.

== History ==
In 1972, the station was started under Soejoso Karsono, a musician. Elshinta starts as an [[amateur radio]] named after his daughter Elshinta. At that time, Elshinta Radio plays Hawaiian music. The station's name influenced Karsono's band name, The Elshinta's Hawaiian Seniors. Later in 1976, Elshinta name was dropped from the band's name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://historia.id/persona/articles/the-singing-commodore-DLQwv (Indonesian) ''The Singing Commodores'', historia.id]&lt;/ref&gt;

After acquisition by [[Salim Group]], Karsono created Suara Irama Indah (now [[PM2FGG|Jak 101 FM]]), first commercial FM radio in Indonesia. Later on, Elshinta became music radio with a few news insert, due to limitations of news broadcast pre-[[1998 Jakarta Riot|1998]]. Elshinta completely abandoned its music programming in 14 February 2000. Today, Elshinta only broadcasts news and talk programming, except sponsored content and affiliations like [[NHK]] World Service.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/resources/brochure/pdf/rj_id.pdf (Indonesian) NHK Radio Brochure]&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 2011, Elshinta was in the same group with [[Indosiar]] TV. In 2011, Indosiar was acquired by Elang Media Teknologi/[[Emtek]], owner of [[SCTV (Indonesia)|SCTV]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://economy.okezone.com/read/2011/03/03/278/430888/akhirnya-sctv-akuisisi-indosiar-rp496-54-miliar (Indonesian) SCTV acquisition over Indosiar]&lt;/ref&gt; Elshinta was also acquired by Emtek, but separated in 2013, creating new entity "Elshinta Media".

&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elshinta.co.id/onair_program.htm Elshinta Programming]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Network ==
Elshinta has 8 regional stations that are self-owned. Elshinta regional stations relay Jakarta's broadcast, but sometimes local news session is found in certain stations. Elshinta also has 32 affiliations across the Indonesian [[archipelago]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elshinta.co.id/profil.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media Group ==
Elshinta has its own media group, consists of Elshinta Magazine, Elshinta.com, TV station in Jakarta [[Elshinta TV]], and Fit Radio.

== Influence ==
Elshinta broadcasts simultaneous news update when a great disaster is happened in Indonesia, especially where the radio network exists. Some people relied to Elshinta for disaster updates, especially before Internet use increased in Indonesia. In Jakarta, Elshinta competes only with [[Radio Republik Indonesia|RRI Pro 3]] 88.8 FM, but its provincial stations have local competitors like [[PM3FHZ|107.5 PRFM]] and [[PM6FJK|Suara Surabaya 100 FM]].&lt;br/&gt;
In 2016 Jakarta Attack and 2018 Surabaya Attack, Elshinta broadcast updates and commentaries about that terrorism event. However, Elshinta was warned by the Broadcasting Commission (KPI) due to fake explosion news spreading&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kpi.go.id/index.php/id/lihat-sanksi/33159-teguran-tertulis-program-siaran-radio-elshinta&lt;/ref&gt; in 2016 Jakarta Attack. Elshinta said that they never spread that hoax news.

'''Pink Plus''' is [[RTV Pink]]'s satellite channel. 

Headquartered in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], it mostly targets [[Serbian diaspora]]. It can be viewed in [[Europe]], [[South America]], [[North America]] and [[Australia]] &amp; [[New Zealand]] on [[UBI World TV]].

Being Pink's primary satellite channel, half of Pink Plus' lineup consists of programmes from Pink's terrestrial channel while the other half is directly tailored for viewers outside Serbia with shows that are only broadcast on Pink Plus (''Halo Pink'', ''Skandal Plus'', ''Tele kviz'', etc.).

The channel gained some notoriety for the footage of its presenter Sanja Nikolić fainting and losing consciousness on air whilst filming ''Halo Pink''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xMmbP4TbuQ Sanja Nikolic of Pink Plus faints on air]&lt;/ref&gt; The clip became an instant [[viral video]] during the early 2000s.

'''Radio Maria''' (formally known as '''The World Family of Radio Maria'''; {{lang-es|Radio María}}, {{lang-pt|Rádio Maria}}, {{lang-hr|Radio Marija}}, {{lang-mt|Radju Marija}}, {{lang-lt|Marijos Radijas}}, {{lang-hu|Mária Rádió}}, {{lang-ru|Радио Мария}}, {{lang-uk|Радіо Марія}}, known in Germany as ''Radio Horeb'') is an international [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] radio [[broadcasting]] service founded in [[Erba (CO)|Erba]], [[province of Como]], in the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan|diocese of Milan]], [[Italy]], in 1987. The World Family of Radio Maria was formed in 1998, mainly based on the [[Our Lady of Medjugorje]] apparitions and messages, and today has branches in 55 countries around the world. Its mission includes [[Liturgy]], [[Catechesis]], [[Spirituality]], Spiritual assistance with everyday issues, Information, Music, and Culture.

== History ==
Its first broadcast facility was originally parish operated in [[Erba, Lombardy|Arcellasco d'Erba]] ([[province of Como]], Italy), but was later re-formed as a separate entity outside its home parish as an association of lay people and priests in 1987 as Radio Maria Italia. In less than five years, it grew into a national Catholic radio network throughout Italy. Though not directly connected with the [[Roman Catholic Church]], it was founded as an instrument of the Church, and as a tool for [[evangelism|evangelization]], implementing and adhering to the teachings of the Church. It was inspired by the Marian apparitions at [[Fátima, Portugal]] (and in more recent years in [[Medjugorje]]), pleading for worldwide conversion. As such, Radio Maria is not subsidized or funded by the Roman Catholic Church; instead it is underwritten by listener contributions.

In 1994, don M. [[Galbiati]], the principal founder, left Radio Maria and founded Radio Mater, even in Arcellasco d'Erba, as a totally separated entity. Since [[5 September]] of the same year, transmissions started in [[Albavilla]] (yet in province of Como). The [[Liturgy of the Hours]] is diffused in the [[Roman Rite]].  Radio Mater is broadcast via radio in Italy, in Europe via satellite ([[DVB-S]] [[Hot Bird]]), and via Internet ([[Windows Media Player|WMP]]).

The World Family of Radio Maria was formed in 1998 out of its subsequent international growth in the 1990s, and following the 1987 speech by [[Pope John Paul II]] in St Peter's Square addressing the need for a new evangelization. Emanuele Ferrario (inspired by the Pope's words to form that new evangelization) is the founder and president of Radio Maria Inc., which has since grown into an association of 40 multilingual broadcast operations in Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and the Americas. Overall, Radio Maria operates approximately 1,500 terrestrial radio transmitters worldwide.

== Programming ==
Programming mostly consists of traditional Catholic worship music, but some stations also air a mix of traditional and [[Contemporary Catholic music]], along with various talk and teaching programs discussing the Catholic faith, frequent recitals of the Holy Rosary, novenas and Masses.

== Facilities ==
Radio Maria's programming mostly emanates from one centrally located studio or station in a given region or country, and is then re-broadcast (or "simulcast") on a network of repeater transmitters on the AM and FM bands. Some employ the use of a [[subcarrier]], also known as SCA (for "[[Subsidiary Communications Authority]]") facilities of FM stations, requiring the use of a receiver designed to receive SCA signals. Since the emergence of the internet, audiostreaming has been used extensively as a means to help fill-in gaps left by the unavailability of AM or FM frequencies in metropolitan areas already taken up by commercial, public, or other religious broadcasters.

Beginning in June 2008, there are now [[shortwave]] transmissions originating from Italy at 26,000&amp;nbsp;kHz and at 26,010&amp;nbsp;kHz DRM making it the only (and last) shortwave service originating in Italy besides [[Vatican Radio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Radio Maria: the last and only Short Wave from Italy | date=2008-06-23 | author=Italradio - Osservatorio Radiofonia Internazionale in Lingua Italiana | url=http://portale.italradio.org/portale/index.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1179&amp;newlang=eng | accessdate= 2011-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are presently no commercial satellite radio subscription services (such as [[Sky Digital (UK &amp; Ireland)|Sky Digital]], [[Sirius Satellite Radio|Sirius]] or [[XM Radio|XM]]) of Radio Maria. However its Spanish-language, Italian-language and Polish-language stations may be available in some areas served by the Dish Pronto division of [[Dish Network]], a satellite television subscription service.
