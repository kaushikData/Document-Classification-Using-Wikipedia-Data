      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11889">'''Three-dimensional (3D) microfabrication''' refers to a manufacturing technique that involves the layering of material to produce a three-dimensional structure.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Three-Dimensional Microfabrication Using Two-Photon Polymerization: Fundamentals, Technology, and Applications|last = |first = |publisher = Elsevier|year = 2016|isbn = 978-0-323-35321-2|location = |editor-last = Baldacchini|editor-first = Tommasso}}&lt;/ref&gt; These structures are usually on the scale of micrometers and are popular in [[microelectronics]] and [[microelectromechanical systems]].

== Rapid prototyping ==
Much like their macroscopic analog, microstructures can be produced using rapid prototyping methods. These techniques generally involve the layering of some resin, with each layer being much thinner than that used for conventional processes in order to produce higher resolution microscopic components. Layers in processes such as electrochemical fabrication can be as thin as 5 to 10 Î¼m.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of Modern Manufacturing: Materials, Processes, and Systems|last=Groover|first=Mikell|publisher=Wiley|year=2012|isbn=978-1118231463|edition=5|pages=846}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of microscopic structures is similar to conventional additive manufacturing techniques in that a computer aided design model is sliced into an appropriate number of two-dimensional layers in order to create a toolpath. This toolpath is then followed by a mechanical system to produce the desired geometry.

A popular application is [[stereolithography]] (SLA), which involves the use of a UV light or laser beam on a surface to create a layer, which are then lowered into a tank so that a new layer can be formed on top. Another commonly used method is [[fused deposition modeling]] (FDM), in which a moving head creates a layer by melting the model material (usually a polymer) and extrudes the melted material onto a surface. Other methods such as [[selective laser sintering]] (SLS) are also used in the additive manufacturing of 3D microstructures.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== 3D laser microfabrication ===
[[File:3D Laser Microfab.png|thumb|Setup of a typical laser microfabrication]]
Laser-based techniques are the most common approach for producing microstructures. Typical techniques involve the use of lasers to add or subtract material from a bulk sample. Recent applications of lasers involve the use of ultrashort pulses of lasers focused to a small area in order to create a pattern that is layered to create a structure. The use of lasers in such a manner is known as laser direct-writing (LDW). Microscopic mechanical elements such as micromotors, micropumps, and other microfluidic devices can be produced using direct-write concepts. In addition to additive and subtractive processes,  LDW allows for the modification of the properties of a material. Mechanisms that allow for these modifications include sintering, microstereolithography, and multiphoton processes. These use a series of laser pulses to deliver a precise amount of energy to induce a physical or chemical change that can result in annealing and surface structuring of a material.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=3D Laser Microfabrication: Principles and Applications|last=|first=|publisher=Wiley|year=2006|isbn=978-3-527-31055-5|editor-last=Misawa|editor-first=Hiroaki|location=Germany|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Microstereolithography ====
Microstereolithography is a common technique based on stereolithography principles. 3D components are fabricated by repeatedly layering photopolymerizable resin and curing under an ultraviolet laser. Earlier systems that employ this technique use a scanning principle in which a focused light beam is fixed onto one location and the translation stage moves to fabricate each layer vector by vector. A faster alternate involves using a projection principle in which the image is projected onto the surface of the resin so that the irradiation of a layer is done in one step only. The high-resolution results allow for the fabrication of complex shapes that would otherwise be difficult to produce at such small scales.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Multiphoton lithography ====
[[Multiphoton lithography|Multiphoton Lithography]] can be used to [[3D printing|3D print]] structures with sub-micrometer resolution. The process uses the focal point of a laser to [[Photopolymerisation|photopolymerize]] the resin or glass at a specific point. By moving the focal point around in three dimensional space and solidifying the medium at different points, the desired geometry can be built. There are currently limits to the resolution of the features in geometries built through this method. The limits relate to the medium that the geometry is being constructed from as well as the precision of the focal point of the laser.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Other additive processes ====
Additive processes involve the layering of materials in a certain pattern. These include laser chemical vapor deposition (LCVD), which use organic precursors to write patterns on a structure or bulk material. This application can be found in the field of electronics, particularly in the repair of transistor arrays for displays. Another additive process is laser-induced forward transfer (LIFT), which uses pulsed lasers aimed at a coated substrate to transfer material in the direction of the laser flow.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; LIFT has been used to produce transfer thermo-electric materials, polymers and has been used to print copper wires. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grant-Jacob|first=James A.|last2=Mills|first2=Benjamin|last3=Feinaeugle|first3=Matthias|last4=Sones|first4=Collin L.|last5=Oosterhuis|first5=Gerrit|last6=Hoppenbrouwers|first6=Marc B.|last7=Eason|first7=Robert W.|date=2013-06-01|title=Micron-scale copper wires printed using femtosecond laser-induced forward transfer with automated donor replenishment|url=https://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?uri=ome-3-6-747|journal=Optical Materials Express|language=EN|volume=3|issue=6|pages=747â754|doi=10.1364/OME.3.000747|issn=2159-3930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== With inclined/rotated UV lithography ==
Focus on the 3D microstructures now, it have been focused in a lot of microsystems like electronic, mechanical, micro-optical and analysis systems. And when this technology is developing, we found that the traditional and conventional micro machining technologies like surface micromachining, bulk micromachining and GIGA process are not sufficient to fabricate or produce oblique and curved 3D microstructures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sensors and Actuators A: Physical|last = Han|first = Manhee|publisher = |year = 2004|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fabrication ===
The basic setup of inclined UV exposure has conventional UV source, a contact stage, and a tilting stage. Plus, we place a photomask and a photoresist coated substrate between the upper and lower plates of the contact stage, and it is fixed by pushing up the lower plate with a screw. Then, we can expose the photoresist to the inclined UV.

An example of the fabrication process: Su-8 is a negative thick photoresist, which used in novel 3D micro fabrication method with inclined/rotated UV lithography. During the process, we coat SU-8 50 on a silicon wafer with a thickness of about 100Å³m. Then, soft bake the resist on a 65&amp;nbsp;Â°C hot plate for 10 minutes and on a 95&amp;nbsp;Â°C plate for 30 minutes. It is contacted with a photomask using the contact stage. This stage, is leaned against the tilting stage and the resist is exposed to the UV. The dose of 365&amp;nbsp;nm UV is 500mJ/cmÂ². After the exposure, the resist is post-expoure baked on a 65&amp;nbsp;Â°C hot plate for 3 minutes and on a 95&amp;nbsp;Â°C plate for 10 minutes. In the end, the resist is developed in the SU-8 for about 10 to 15 minutes at the room temperature with mild agitation and then, rinsed with isopropyl alcohol. Besides that, there can be a lot of other procedures. For example, inclined UV lithography, inclined and rotated UV lithography and lithography using reflected UV.

When the trace of the incident UV with a right angle is on a straight line, so the patterns of a photomask are transcribed to the resist. When talking about inclined UV exposure processes, the UV is refracted and reflected, this makes it possible to fabricate various of 3D structures.The microstructures fabricated by the 3D micro fabrication technology can be allied to a lot of microsystems directly. Also, it can be used as the molds for electroplating. As a result, these technology can be applied to a variety of fields like filters, mixers, jets, micro channels, light guide panels of LCD monitor and more.

== Self-folding materials ==
Design of complicated 3D microstructure can be highly challenging task for development of novel materials for optics, biotechnology and micro/nano electronics. 3D materials can be fabricated using a lot of methods like two-photon photolithography, interference lithography and molding. But 3D structuring using these techniques is very complicated, experimentally. This can limit their upscaling and broad applicability.

Nature offers a large number of ideas for the design of novel materials with superior properties. Self-assembly and self-organization being the main principle of structure formation in nature attract significant interest as promising concepts for the design of intelligent materials.

Stimuli-responsive hydrogels mimic swelling/shrinking behavior of plant cells and produce macroscopic actuation is response to small variation of environmental conditions. Mostly, homogenous expansion or contraction in all directions can result a change of conditions. Also, inhomogeneous expansion and shrinkage can result more complex behavior  like bending, twisting and folding and they can happen with different magnitudes in different directions. Utilization of these phenomena for the design of structured materials can be highly attractive because they allow simple, template-free fabrication of very complex repetitive 2D and 3D patterns. However, they cannot be prepared by using sophisticated fabrication methods like two-photon and interference photolithography as mentioned before. There is an advantage of the self-folding approach, is the possibility of quick, reversible, and reproducible fabrication of 3D hollow objects with controlled chemical properties and morphology of both the exterior and the interior.

One experimental application of self-folding materials is pasta that ships flat but folds into the desired shape on contact with boiling water.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2017/06/05/mit-engineers-develop-shape-shifting-pasta/C9nIhd7jtvDPNbFo64MTMP/story.html MIT researchers develop a shape-shifting pasta]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Outlook ===
One factor that limit broad applicability of self-folding polymer films is the manufacturing cost. Actually, polymer can be deposited by spinning and dipping coating at ambient conditions, the fabrication of polymer self-folding films is substantially cheaper than fabrication of inorganic ones, which are produced by vacuum deposition. In another word, there is no method, which is cheap and large-scale production of self-folding polymer films that substantially limits their application.

To solve these issues, the future research myst be focused on deeper investigation of folding to allow design of complex 3D structures using just 2D shapes. On the other hand, searching a way, which is cheap and fast manufacturing of large quantity of self-folding films can be greatly helpful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Polymer Reviews, 2013, Vol.53(1)|last=Ionov|first=Leonid|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Group|year=2013|isbn=|location=Germany|pages=92â107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs'''''&lt;ref name=ph1976 /&gt; is a 1976 book written by [[Niklaus Wirth]] covering some of the fundamental topics of [[computer programming]], particularly that [[algorithm]]s and [[data structure]]s are inherently related. For example, if one has a [[sorted list]] one will use a [[search algorithm]] optimal for sorted lists.

The book was one of the most influential computer science books of the time and, like Wirth's other work, was extensively used in education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=540029 Citations collected by the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Turbo Pascal]] compiler written by [[Anders Hejlsberg]] was largely inspired by the "Tiny Pascal" compiler in Niklaus Wirth's book.

'''Analog device''' is usually a combination of both analog [[machine]] and analog [[recording media|media]] that can together [[Measurement|measure]], [[Analog recording|record]], reproduce, or [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] [[continuum (measurement)|continuous]] [[information]], for example, the almost infinite number of grades of [[transparency (optics)|transparency]], [[voltage]], [[Electrical resistance|resistance]], [[rotation]], or [[pressure]]. In theory, the continuous information (also [[analog signal]]) has an infinite number of possible [[Value (mathematics)|value]]s with the only limitation on [[Angular resolution|resolution]] being the [[accuracy]] of the analog device.

==Examples==

===Non-electrical===
There are notable non-electrical analog devices, such as [[clock]]s (sundials, water clocks, pendulum clocks, analog watches), the astrolabe, slide rules, the governor of a steam engine, the [[planimeter]] (a simple device that measures the area of a closed shape), Kelvin's mechanical [[Tide-predicting machine|tide predictor]], acoustic rangefinders, servomechanisms (e.g. the thermostat), a simple mercury thermometer, a bathroom scale, and the speedometer 
===Electrical===
The [[telautograph]] is an analogue precursor to the modern fax machine. It transmits electrical impulses recorded by potentiometers to stepping motors attached to a pen, thus being able to reproduce a drawing or signature made by the sender at the receiver's station. It was the first such device to transmit drawings to a stationary sheet of paper; previous inventions in Europe used rotating drums to make such transmissions.

An [[analog synthesizer]] is a synthesizer that uses analog circuits and [[analog computer]] techniques to generate sound electronically.

The [[analog television]] encodes television and transports the picture and sound information as an analogue signal, that is, by varying the amplitude and/or frequencies of the broadcast signal. All systems preceding digital television, such as NTSC, PAL or UNIT are analog television systems.

An [[analog computer]] is a form of computer that uses electrical, mechanical or hydraulic phenomena to model the problem being solved. More generally an analog computer uses one kind of physical quantity to represent the behaviour of another physical system, or mathematical function. Modeling a real physical system in a computer is called simulation.

==Interfacing the digital and analog worlds==
In electronics, a [[digital-to-analog converter]] (DAC or D-to-A) is a circuit for converting a [[Digital signal (signal processing)|digital signal]] (usually binary) to an analog signal (current, voltage or electric charge). Digital-to-analog converters are interfaces between the digital world and analog world. An [[analog-to-digital converter]] (abbreviated ADC, A/D or A to D) is an electronic circuit that converts continuous signals to discrete digital numbers.

==Controversy over photographic film==
There is quite a bit of controversy in the photographic world as to whether or not a film camera should be considered an "analog device" since the photographic film isn't a truly analog recording medium and requires chemistry to process an image. "Analog" has become the common term for referring to cameras that are "not digital" and is an easy shorthand for people to differentiate between the two [[Medium (arts)|mediums]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=The Goddamn Batman |url=http://fringefocus.com/2010/technical/analog-is-not-the-opposite-of-digital |title=Analog Is Not the Opposite of Digital â Fringe Focus |publisher=Fringefocus.com |date=2010-08-02 |accessdate=2016-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625120830/http://fringefocus.com/2010/technical/analog-is-not-the-opposite-of-digital |archivedate=2013-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://photo-utopia.blogspot.com/2007/10/chumps-and-clumps.html |title=Photo Utopia: Clumps and Chumps (or why film isn't binary) |publisher=Photo-utopia.blogspot.com |date=2008-10-20 |accessdate=2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2629">The '''Annual Biocontrol Industry Meeting'''  (ABIM) in [[Basel]] is an annual conference of manufacturers of biological plant protection products worldwide. Every year since 2005, 700 â 800 delegates from 300 â 400 firms take part in this English-speaking meeting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fibl.org/de/service/nachrichtenarchiv/meldung/article/annual-biocontrol-industry-meeting-abim-2015.html Webpage of FIBL concerning ABIM 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eventegg.com/abim-2016/ ABIM on Eventegg]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnmbJX3nX6A ABIM on youtube]&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of the conference is the exchange of business and scientific experience and presentation of commercial and scientific advances on the subject of the protection of plants and pest control in plant crops by natural (biological) methods, with particular reference to [[Bioeffector]]s.

The meeting takes place every autumn in Basel, and is organised by the [[Research Institute of Organic Agriculture|Swiss Research Institute for Biological Agriculture]] ([[FiBL]]). In parallel the annual meeting of the [[International Biocontrol Manufacturers' Association]] (IBMA), the association representing the biological plant protection industry, is held.

Important sponsors of the meeting are [[BASF]], [[Bayer]], Biobest,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biobestgroup.com/ Webpage Biobest],&lt;/ref&gt; Biogard,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biogard.it/index.php/en/ Webpage Biogard]&lt;/ref&gt; De Sangosse,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.desangosse.de Webpage De Sangosse]&lt;/ref&gt; Koppert,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.koppert.com/ Webpage Koppert]&lt;/ref&gt; Monsanto Bio AG,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monsanto.com/products/pages/bioag.aspx Webpage Monsanto Bio AG]&lt;/ref&gt; Oro Agri,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oroagri.com/ Webpage Ori Agri]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sumitomo]], [[Syngenta]], Vallent Biosciences&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valentbiosciences.com/ Webpage Valentbiosciences]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1487">The '''Association of Plumbing and Heating Contractors''' (APHC) is a [[trade association]] for the [[plumbing]] and heating industry in [[England]] and [[Wales]], representing around 1500 businesses employing some 60,000 specialist engineers ranging from those employed by large companies to sole traders working in domestic properties.

The APHC represents these specialists on the [[Specialist Engineering Contractors Group]], a member of the [[Strategic Forum for Construction]].

==History==
The APHC started in 1925 as the National Federation of Plumbers and Domestic Engineers, focused on industrial and commercial aspects of plumbing that had previously been managed by the Institute of Plumbers (today the [[Chartered Institute of Plumbing and Heating Engineering|CIPHE]]), which remained focused on education, training and technical matters.

It became the National Federation of Plumbers and Domestic Heating Engineers in 1965 to reflect the increased amount of members' work on heating systems. In 1972 it became an association: the National Association of Plumbing, Heating and Mechanical Services Contractors. It adopted its current name in 1996.

'''Axess''' (ã¢ã¯ã»ã¹å½éãããã¯ã¼ã¯) is a [[Computer reservations system]] based in Japan which provides its services in the Japanese market. It originated as the IT department of [[Japan Airlines]] called Jalinfotech. In 1991 it was established as an independent company it began to be marketed to travel agencies in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.axess.co.jp/eng/history.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 Axess partnered with [[Sabre Holdings]] in order to provide travel agencies in Japan with booking and ticketing capabilities for a wider range of international airlines.

On April 23 2012 Travelport, the business services provider to the global travel industry, announced a long-term agreement with AXESS International Network, the leading Japanese GDS owned by Japan Airlines (JAL).  Under the new agreement, AXESS will be hosted by Travelport in its Atlanta data center as a partition of the Travelport global distribution system.  The new upgraded AXESS GDS system, which will provide enhanced functionality to connected travel agency users, will be implemented by 2013.

By adopting Travelport's technology infrastructure, the AXESS GDS system will be enhanced with improved connectivity to airlines and a significant increase in the range of fares, shopping, hotel and car rental capabilities available for use by Japanese travel agencies and corporations. 

AXESS confirmed it had selected Travelport as its partner due to the two companies' mutual alignment on strategic thinking and saw the agreement as a significant step forward in reinforcing AXESS's position as the GDS of choice in the Japanese travel industry.

[[File:infinite-corridor-bboard.jpeg|thumb|Well-used bulletin board on the [[Infinite Corridor]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], November 2004.]]
[[File:Cork.jpg|thumb|[[Cork (material)|Cork]], a common bulletin board material]]

A '''bulletin board''' ('''pinboard''', '''pin board''', '''noticeboard''', or '''notice board''' in British English) is a surface intended for the posting of public messages, for example, to advertise items wanted or for sale, announce events, or provide information. Bulletin boards are often made of a material such as [[Cork (material)|cork]] to facilitate addition and removal of messages, as well as a writing surface such as [[blackboard]] or [[whiteboard]]. A bulletin board which combines a pinboard (corkboard) and writing surface is known as a combination bulletin board. Bulletin boards can also be entirely in the digital domain and placed on computer networks so people can leave and erase messages for other people to read and see, as in a [[bulletin board system]].

Bulletin boards are particularly prevalent at universities. They are used by many sports groups and [[extracurricular]] groups and anything from local shops to official notices. [[Dormitory]] corridors, well-trafficked hallways, lobbies, and freestanding kiosks often have cork boards attached to facilitate the posting of notices. At some universities, lampposts, bollards, trees, and walls often become impromptu posting sites in areas where official boards are sparse in number.

[[Internet forums]] are a replacement for traditional bulletin boards. [[Bulletin board system|Online bulletin boards]] are sometimes referred to as message boards. The terms bulletin board, message board and even Internet forum are interchangeable, although often one bulletin board or message board can contain a number of Internet forums or discussion groups. An online board can serve the same purpose as a physical bulletin board.

Magnet boards, or magnetic bulletin boards, are a popular substitute for cork boards because they lack the problem of board deterioration from the insertion and removal of pins over time.

== History ==

* 1801: [[James Pillans]], [[headmaster]] and geography teacher at the Old High School in [[Edinburgh, Scotland]], is credited with inventing the first modern [[blackboard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.cu-portland.edu/blog/reference-material/the-history-of-the-classroom-blackboard/|title=History of the Classroom Blackboard|author=|date=8 November 2012|publisher=[[Concordia University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CAD navigation''' refers to software tools which are used for the correlation of electronic [[semiconductor]] design data with a physical semiconductor device. CAD navigation tools consist of software that is capable of reading and displaying the physical layout and logical [[schematic]] for the device. The logical design consists of a [[netlist]] and/or a schematic. The physical design consists of a set of polygons which precisely represent the location of all electrical conductors, diffusions and interconnections in the physical semiconductor device. CAD navigation tools are often used to provide a cross-correlation between the logical design and the physical design. CAD navigation tools are used extensively with [[Electron Beam Prober|E-beam probers]], [[Ion beam|focused-ion beam systems]] and [[Time resolved photon emission prober|photon probers]] for the purpose of semiconductor [[failure analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference| last=Ng| first=W| title=CAD Navigation in FA and Design/Test Data for Fast Fault Isolation| booktitle=Microelectronics Failure Analysis | pages= 676â83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cir. 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; is a legal case heard by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]] concerning the anti-trafficking provision of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA), {{USC|17|1201(a)(2)}}, in the context of two competing universal [[garage door opener]] companies. It discusses the statutory structure and legislative history of the DMCA to help clarify the intent of the anti-circumvention provisions and decide who holds the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]]. It expresses that the statute creates a cause of action for liability and does not create a [[property right]], and holds that as Chamberlain had alleged that Skylink was in violation of the anti-trafficking provision, it had the burden to prove and failed to show that access was unauthorized and its rights were infringed under the [[Copyright Act of 1976|Copyright Act]]. As Chamberlain incorrectly argued that Skylink had the burden of proof and failed to prove their claim, the court upheld [[summary judgment]] in favor of Skylink.

== Background of the case ==
This case involves two competitors that produce universal [[garage door opener]]s (GDOs).  Universal garage door openers are used when people want to replace or purchase a spare transmitter to open their garage door. They are designed to interoperate with existing GDO systems, regardless of model.

Chamberlain markets a "Security+" line of GDOs which includes [[rolling code]] software that actively alters the transmitted signal by cycling through a series of strings (of which only some are able to open the door). This rolling code is designed to protect against a potential [[Replay attack|"code grabbing" attack]] where a nearby burglar may try to record the garage door opening signal.  Chamberlain claims that the rolling code system makes it unlikely for a burglar to send a valid signal by replaying the recorded one.  With rolling code protection, a garage door will open if and only if the transmitted code is not among the last 1024 used codes and it is among the next 4096 codes. The Security+ has additional functionality that will cause the GDO to resynchronize when two signals out of the acceptable range are transmitted in rapid succession. This was added in the case that homeowners use the same transmitter on multiple garage doors.

In 1992, Skylink produced a universal transmitter called Model 39 that was designed to work for both rolling code and non-rolling code GDOs. The Model 39 bypasses the Chamberlain's rolling code system by imitating Security+'s resynchronization feature. The Model 39 transmitter sends three fixed codes in rapid succession; this either causes the door to open due to the first code or it causes the door to resynchronize and open due to the latter two codes.&lt;ref name=Chamberlain /&gt;

==Relevant law==
This case involves the anti-trafficking provisions of the DMCA. 17 U.S.C. Â§ 1201(b) states:
&lt;blockquote class="quotation"&gt;No person shall manufacture, import, offer to the public, provide, or otherwise traffic in any technology, product, service, device, component, or part thereof, thatâ

(A) is primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title;&lt;ref name=sec1201&gt;{{USC|17|1201}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Procedural history ==
Chamberlain sued Skylink in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois]] in two cases. In the first case, ''Chamberlain I'', Chamberlain alleged that Skylink's actions violated the anti-trafficking provisions of the DMCA and moved for summary judgment. The court denied Chamberlain's motion for summary judgment. In the second case, ''Chamberlain II'', Chamberlain alleged that Skylink infringed their patents and violated the anti-trafficking provisions of the DMCA.

With regards to the DMCA claim in ''Chamberlain II'', Chamberlain contended that:
#Model 39 was designed to circumvent the protection mechanism placed by Chamberlain's rolling code (infringing Â§1201(a)(2)(A)).  
#It has limited commercial use other than to circumvent the rolling code (infringing Â§1201(a)(2)(B)).
#It was marketed to circumvent that technology (infringing Â§1201(a)(2)(C)).

In response, Skylink claimed that "consumers use the Model 39 transmitter to activate the Security+ GDOs with Chamberlain's consent."&lt;ref name=Chamberlain /&gt; Â§1201(a)(3)(A) states that to "circumvent a technological measure" means to "descramble a scrambled work, to decrypt an encrypted work, or otherwise to avoid, bypass, remove, deactivate, or impair a technological measure, without the authority of the copyright owner."&lt;ref name=Chamberlain /&gt;&lt;ref name=sec1201 /&gt;  They also claimed that the Model 39 transmitter served a variety of functions that were unrelated to circumvention, that Chamberlain had failed to demonstrate that its GDOs contained a computer program protected by copyright, that Skylink had not violated the DMCA because its acts fell within a safe harbor provision per Â§1201(f), and that Chamberlain's rolling code computer program did not protect a copyrighted computer program, but instead protects an uncopyrightable process.

Chamberlain claimed that (1) Skylink had the burden to prove that their use was authorized and (2) Chamberlain "never gave consumers explicit authorization to program competing universal transmitters into its rolling code openers."&lt;ref name=Chamberlain /&gt;

The District Court agreed with Skylink and because Chamberlain did not explicitly restrict the consumer's use of alternate transmitters, this was deemed an unconditional sale that implicitly authorized customers to use other transmitters. The court also noted that Chamberlain's construction and interpretation of the DMCA would make its own consumers violate Â§1201(a)(1), which prohibits circumvention of a technological measure that controls access.

As Chamberlain did not show that Skylink's access was unauthorized, the District Court granted the motion for summary judgment to Skylink and dismissed the patent claims.

==Appeal issues==
Chamberlain appealed the District Court's decision of summary judgment granted to Skylink in ''Chamberlain II'' and the case was heard before the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In this case, Chamberlain claimed the District Court incorrectly placed the burden on Chamberlain to prove that the circumvention of its technological measures was unauthorized when it should have placed the burden on Skylink to show that the use was authorized.

==Decision==
The Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court's ruling. The court explained that by explicitly stating that circumvention occurs "without the authority of the copyright owner," the DMCA requires the plaintiff alleging circumvention to show that the defendant's access was unauthorized.&lt;ref name=Chamberlain /&gt;&lt;ref name=sec1201 /&gt;

The Federal Circuit went on to clarify the nature of the DMCA's anti-circumvention provisions. The DMCA established causes of action for liability and did not establish a property right. Therefore, circumvention is not infringement in itself.&lt;ref name=Chamberlain /&gt;

In response to Chamberlain's assertions that the DMCA "renders the pre-DMCA history in the GDO industry irrelevant," "fundamentally altered the legal landscape," and "overrode all pre-existing consumer expectations about the legitimate uses of products containing copyrighted embedded software,"&lt;ref name=Chamberlain /&gt; the court disagreed. In Chamberlain's view, all use of products that contain copyrighted software and use protective technological measures would violate the DMCA and this would give companies a loophole around antitrust laws as well as take away the [[fair use]] defense.&lt;ref name=Chamberlain /&gt;&lt;ref name=eff&gt;EFF, [http://w2.eff.org/legal/cases/Chamberlain_v_Skylink/ Chamberlain Group, Inc. v. Skylink Technologies, Inc.].&lt;/ref&gt; By examining the structure and history of the statute and the intent of Congress, the court attempted to interpret the statutory language. The court found that the goals of the DMCA were to establish a balance between the competing interests of content owners and information users and balance access control measures with fair use.&lt;ref name=Chamberlain /&gt;

Chamberlain had the burden to prove that (1) they had ownership of a copyrighted work, (2) it was controlled by a technological measure that was circumvented, (3) third parties can access it (4) without authorization in a way that (5) infringes rights protected by the Copyright Act due to a product created, advertised, or provided by the defendant Skylink. Once the plaintiff proves those five they must also prove that the defendant trafficked in a product which was (i) designed or produced primarily for circumvention; (ii) made available despite only limited commercial significance other than circumvention; or (iii) marketed for use in circumvention of the controlling technological measure. Chamberlain never claimed that Skylink infringed its copyrights or contributed to third-party infringement nor did it show that its users were unauthorized to use the product. As Chamberlain failed to show the fourth and fifth requirements to prove their claim, the Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court's grant of summary judgment to Skylink, writing,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Chamberlain, however, has failed to show not only the requisite lack of authorization, but also the necessary fifth element of its claim, the critical nexus between access and protection. Chamberlain neither alleged copyright infringement nor explained how the access provided by the Model 39 transmitter facilitates the infringement of any right that the Copyright Act protects. There can therefore be no reasonable relationship between the access that homeowners gain to Chamberlain's copyrighted software when using Skylink's Model 39 transmitter and the protections that the Copyright Act grants to Chamberlain.&lt;ref name=Chamberlain /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[video engineering]], '''color framing''' refers to the '''color frame sequence''' of [[field (video)|field]]s in a [[composite video]] signal through which the video frame timing and [[chrominance subcarrier]] signal timingâin particular, that of the [[color burst]] -- cycle through all possible phase relationships.

The exact nature of the color frame sequence depends on the video standard being used. In the case of the three main composite video standards, [[PAL]] video has an 8-field (4 frame) color frame sequence, and [[NTSC]] and [[SECAM]] both have 4-field (2 frame) color frame sequences.

Preserving the color framing sequence of video across edits and between channels in video effects was an important issue in early analog composite [[videotape editing]] systems, as cuts between different color sequences would cause jumps in [[subcarrier]] phase, and mixing two signals of different [[field dominance]] would result in color artifacts on the part of the signal that was not in sync with the output color frame sequence. 

To help prevent these problems, [[SMPTE time code]] contains a color framing bit, which can be used to indicate that the  video material the timecode refers to follows a standard convention regarding the synchronization of video time code and the color framing sequence. If the color framing bit was set in both types of material, the editing system could then always ensure that color framing was preserved by constraining edit decisions between input sources to keep the correct relationship between the timecode sequences, and hence the color framing sequences.

Color framing has become largely an issue of historical interest, first with the advent in the 1980s of digital composite video [[timebase corrector]]s and [[frame store]]s, which could regenerate the color frame sequence of a composite signal at any phase, and later with analog [[component video]] editing and modern [[digital video]] systems, in which subcarrier phase is no longer relevant.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1571">'''Diffuse design''' refers to the designing capability of individuals who are not formally trained as [[Designer|designers]]. Drawing on the natural human ability to adopt a design approach, nonexpert designers bring diffuse design into the world via a combination of [[Critical thinking|critical sense]], [[creativity]], and [[Pragmatism|practical sense]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manzini|first=Ezio|date=2015-01-02|title=Design in the transition phase: a new design culture for the emerging design|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1080%2F14487136.2015.1085683|journal=Design Philosophy Papers|language=en|volume=13|issue=1|pages=57â62|doi=10.1080/14487136.2015.1085683|issn=1448-7136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diffuse design was coined by Italian design scholar [[Ezio Manzini]] and was a central theme of his 2015 book ''Design, When Everybody Designs''. Manzini asserts that everybody is endowed with the ability to design, though not everyone is a competent designer and fewer still become professional designers. He also suggests it is the role of expert designers in [[social innovation]] contexts to improve the conditions by which different [[social actors]] can take part in [[co-design]] processes in a more expert fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/904398409|title=Design, when everybody designs : an introduction to design for social innovation|last=Ezio,|first=Manzini,|isbn=9780262328630|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|oclc=904398409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The concept of Digital Business Ecosystem was put forward in 2002 by a group of European researchers and practitioners, including Francesco Nachira, Paolo Dini and Andrea Nicolai, who applied the general notion of digital ecosystems to model the process of adoption and development of ICT-based products and services in competitive, highly fragmented markets like the European one&lt;ref&gt;F Nachira, P Dini, A Nicolai. [http://www.digital-ecosystems.org/book/Introduction.pdf A Network of Digital Business Ecosystems for Europe: Roots, Processes and Perspectives in Digital Business ]. 2007, European Commission &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F Nachira, A Nicolai, P Dini, M Le Louarn, L R Leon.

. Elizabeth Chang, [[Ernesto Damiani]] and Tharam Dillon started in 2007 the IEEE Digital EcoSystems and Technologies Conference (IEEE DEST). [http://spider.sigappfr.org/members/richard-chbeir/ Richard Chbeir], Youakim Badr, Dominique Laurent, and Hiroshi Ishikawa started in 2009 the ACM [http://sigappfr.acm.org/MEDES Conference on Management of Digital EcoSystems (MEDES)]

==Perspectives==
The digital ecosystem metaphor and models have been applied to a number of business areas related to the production and distribution of knowledge-intensive products and services, including higher education.&lt;ref&gt;Damiani E., Uden, L, &amp; Trisnawaty W. [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4233689/ The future of E-learning: E-learning ecosystem.] Inaugural IEEE Digital Ecosystems and Technologies Conference (IEEE DEST), 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The perspective of this research is providing methods and tools to achieve a set of objectives of the ecosystem (e.g. sustainability, fairness, bounded information asymmetry, risk control and gracious failure). These objectives are seen as desirable properties whose emergence should be fostered by the digital ecosystem self-organization, rather than as explicit design goals like in conventional IT.

An '''enhanced mini-USB''' (EMU) connector is a type of hybrid electrical connector which carries [[Universal Serial Bus]] data and power as well as other connections such as bidirectional audio.  It was invented for and is mainly used on [[mobile phone]]s.  [[Motorola]], [[HTC Corporation]], and other mobile phone manufacturers use EMU connectors.&lt;ref name="traceyandmatt"&gt;[http://www.tracyandmatt.co.uk/blogs/index.php/2006/09/10/htc_hermes_usb_connector_pin_config HTC Hermes USB connector pin config]&lt;/ref&gt;  There is more than one standard for EMU connectors, which are incompatible between manufacturers, but all are physically and electrically compatible with standard mini-USB connectors. The EMU connector has five [[pinout|pins]] for USB on one side.  While regular USB connectors are empty on the other side, EMU has more pins intended for headsets.  In HTC's version, two pins are for the microphone, three are for stereo sound, and one is for the [[push-to-talk]] switch.

In the [[CEA-936-A]] standard, there are no extra pins â the USB data pins are also used for [[RS-232]] transmit and receive, stereo audio left and right, or for microphone and speaker/earpiece.  Devices select which function the pins perform depending on user settings or on the context or mode in which the device is being operated.  Two different functions cannot be used at once.

Using the connector may require a breakout cable or special headset.  Most often, the user must buy a special adapter or [[Patch cable|pigtail]] to make the correct connections to a 2.5mm [[TRS connector]] for a monophonic headset or 3.5mm for stereo headphones.  True breakout cables which provide all connections are unavailable, thus a phone cannot be charged at the same time as a headset or headphones are inserted, even for EMUs with extra pins.

Some mobile phone companies have used the extra pin "X" to enforce the use of their own battery chargers. [[Verizon Wireless]] is the first company to require first-party battery chargers, having colluded with Motorola{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} to put an arbitrary 1.4 volts on pin X.  This voltage violates the [[USB-IF]] standards, as pin X should either be tied to [[electrical ground|ground]] or not connected at all.  Without this connection, the phone will refuse to charge, displaying "unauthorized charger" despite receiving the proper current. The phone will charge while connected to a personal computer only if the PC is running a special device driver.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5112">'''Enterprise test [[software]]''' (ETS) is a type of [[software]] that [[electronics]] and other manufacturers use to standardize product testing enterprise-wide, rather than simply in the [[test engineer]]ing department. It is designed to integrate and synchronize test systems to other enterprise functions such as [[research and development]] (R&amp;D), [[new product introduction]] (NPI), [[manufacturing]], and [[supply chain]], overseeing the collaborative test processes between engineers and managers in their respective departments.

Like most [[enterprise software]] subcategories, ETS represents an evolution away from custom-made, in-house software development by [[original equipment manufacturer]]s (OEM). It typically replaces a cumbersome, unsophisticated, test management infrastructure that manufacturers have to redesign for every new product launch. Some large companies, such as [[Alcatel-Lucent|Alcatel]], [[Cisco]], and [[Nortel]], develop ETS systems internally to standardize and accelerate their test engineering activities, while others such as [[Harris Corporation]] and Freescale Semiconductor choose [[commercial off-the-shelf]] ETS options for advantages that include test data management and report generation. This need results from the extensive characterization efforts associated with IC design, characterization, validation, and verification. ETS accelerates design improvements through test system management and version control.

ETS supports test system development and can be interconnected with manufacturing execution services (MES), [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP), and [[product lifecycle management]] (PLM) software packages to eliminate double-data entry and enable [[Real-time computing|real-time]] information sharing throughout all company departments.

==Enterprise-wide test applications==

ETS covers five major enterprise-wide test applications.

*Test and automationâBy using ETS in conjunction with [[virtual instrumentation]] [[programming tool]]s, design and test engineers avoid custom [[software programming]] unrelated to device characterization, and can thereby accelerate test system development.
*Product [[data management]]âIn this application, the engineer collects, stores, aggregates, distributes, and shares product and test data in a central database. One significant advantage of ETS is reported to be product [[traceability]]. It is designed to make performance reporting easier, and to increase the chances that products are built correctly, from the first [[prototype]], reducing design iterations.
*[[Process control]]âThe engineer manages the flow of activities between test, repair, and assembly stations, and enforces or suggests how a set of work instructions are to be applied. This application is designed to orchestrate product test strategies from [[Verification and Validation|validation]] to delivery.
*Multi-site collaborationâThis purpose of this application is avoid [[time zone]] difficulties and error-prone updates of new product and test system releases, by sharing information with other departments and remote [[contract manufacturer]]s electronically. It is designed to offer real-time visibility over global test operations.
*Test asset managementâThis application is intended to help design and test engineers track [[product configuration]]s, tolerances, test sequences, and software being used by each test system, as well as distribute new updates electronically in real-time. Engineers can update their test systems automatically, in synch with their new releases.

'''ExxonMobil Electrofrac''' is an ''[[in situ]]'' [[shale oil extraction]] technology proposed by [[ExxonMobil]] for converting [[kerogen]] in [[oil shale]] to [[shale oil]].

==Technology==
ExxonMobil Electrofrac uses a series of fractures created in the oil shale formation. Preferably these fractures should be longitudinal vertical fractures created from horizontal wells and conducting electricity from the heel to the toe of each heating well. For conductivity, an electrically-conductive material such as [[calcined petroleum coke]] is injected into the wells in fractures, forming a heating element.&lt;ref name=DOE/&gt;&lt;ref name=almanac2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAAPG&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Heating wells are placed in a parallel row with a second horizontal well intersecting them at their toe. This allows opposing electrical charges to be applied at either end. Laboratory experiments have demonstrated that electrical continuity is unaffected by kerogen conversion and that hydrocarbons are expelled from heated oil shale even under ''in situ'' stress.&lt;ref name=AAAPG/&gt;  Planar heaters should be used because they require fewer wells than wellbore heaters and offer a reduced surface footprint. The shale oil is extracted by separate dedicated production wells.&lt;ref name=DOE&gt;

[[File:FEMA - 5767 - Photograph by David Stonner taken on 01-31-2002 in Missouri.jpg|thumb|Another Fiatallis wheel loader, Missouri, 2002.]]

'''Fiat-Allis''' (1974 to 1985), later renamed '''Fiatallis''' (1985 to early 1990s), was a [[brand]] of [[heavy equipment]] (also called construction equipment, earthmoving equipment, or engineering vehicles), such as [[loader (equipment)|loaders]], [[bulldozer]]s, [[backhoe]]s, [[wheel tractor-scraper|scrapers]], and [[grader]]s. It began in 1974, when [[Allis-Chalmers]]'s construction equipment business was reorganized into a [[joint venture]] with [[Fiat|Fiat SpA]],&lt;ref name="Buescher1991p316"&gt;{{Harvnb|Buescher|1991|p=316}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dean2001p134"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dean|2001|p=134}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which bought a 65% majority stake at the outset.&lt;ref name="Dean2001p134"/&gt; 

Allis-Chalmers's construction equipment business was often not profitable during the 1950s and 1960s. It faced stiff competition from companies such as [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]], [[Case Corporation|Case]], [[Euclid Trucks|Euclid]], [[John Deere]], [[Fiat Trattori|Fiat MMT]], and others. The 1974 formation of a new company, Fiat-Allis, was essentially a [[divestment]]. 

Over the next decade, Fiat continued to invest in Fiat-Allis, more so than Allis-Chalmers did. The two parent firms disagreed on decisions made at, and about, Fiat-Allis. In 1985, the joint venture ended. Fiat bought out Allis's remaining minority stake (which had shrunk from its original 35%). Fiat renamed the company Fiatallis.&lt;ref name="Haycraft2000p278"&gt;{{Harvnb|Haycraft|2000|p=278}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Fiat Hitachi FH240LC.3 p2.JPG|thumb|Fiat-Hitachi FH240LC [[excavator|trackhoe]].]]

Cooperation with [[Hitachi]] yielded '''Fiat-Hitachi''' branding for some years. Fiatallis was eventually sold to [[CNH (company)|CNH]], of which Fiat is a major stockholder. CNH retired the Fiatallis brand and merged the company's assets with others from [[Case Corporation|Case]] and [[New Holland Machine Company]]. CNH's construction equipment line is called [[New Holland Construction]].

is an organization. Its main idea is to create detailed and public documentation for all stages of software creation. The foundation was established in 2002 on the grand opening of the semifinals of [[ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] by [[Anatoly Shalyto]]. This foundation was announced on the [[Linux Summit]] 2004,&lt;ref&gt;[http://is.ifmo.ru/foundation/linux/ Part of the program of Linux Summit 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Shalyto|Shalyto A.]] Naumov L.

[[Image:Shalyto Linux Summit 2004.jpeg|thumb|250px|right|[[Anatoly Shalyto]] on [[Linux Summit]] 2004, Helsinki ]]

== Motivation ==
The motivation for creating ''detailed'' documentation is considered the following:
* software quality increases
* program verification simplifies
* project modification becomes easier and safer

The motivation for making documentation ''open'' is considered the following:
* project becomes less dependent on its initial authors
* other people can easily understand structure and behaviour of a program
* design decisions reuse becomes easier and safer
* it becomes possible to use real project for study purposes

== Application ==
Foundation for Open Project Documentation gives a project a greater understandability and re-usability potential, than [[open source software|Open Source foundation]]. It is loosely connected with [[Free Software Foundation]]. OpenDoc project can also be commercial.

== Main principles ==
* The project documentation should be a base for source code, but not vice versa.
* The documentation should describe not only the final product, but also the creation process.
* The documentation should be easy to understand even for less qualified developers than its author.
* The documentation should be available every time anyone explores or modifies a project.

A '''gate driver''' is a [[power amplifier]] that accepts a low-power input from a controller [[Integrated circuit|IC]] and produces a high-current drive input for the gate of a high-power transistor such as an [[IGBT]] or [[power MOSFET]]. Gate drivers can be provided either on-chip or as a discrete module. In essence, a gate driver consists of a [[Comparator#Level shifter|level shifter]] in combination with an [[amplifier]].

== Purpose ==
In contrast to [[bipolar transistors]], MOSFETs do not require constant power input, as long as they are not being switched on or off. The isolated gate-electrode of the MOSFET forms a [[capacitor]] (gate capacitor), which must be charged or discharged each time the MOSFET is switched on or off. As a transistor requires a particular gate voltage in order to switch on, the gate capacitor must be charged to at least the required gate voltage for the transistor to be switched on. Similarly, to switch the transistor off, this charge must be dissipated, i.e. the gate capacitor must be discharged.

When a transistor is switched on or off, it does not immediately switch from a non-conducting to a conducting state; and may transiently support both a high voltage and conduct a high current. Consequently, when gate current is applied to a transistor to cause it to switch, a certain amount of heat is generated which can, in some cases, be enough to destroy the transistor. Therefore, it is necessary to keep the switching time as short as possible, so as to minimize switching loss. Typical switching times are in the range of microseconds. The switching time of a transistor is inversely proportional to the amount of [[Electric current|current]] used to charge the gate. Therefore, switching currents are often required in the range of several hundred  [[milliamperes]], or even in the range of [[amperes]]. For typical gate voltages of approximately 10-15V, several [[watt]]s of power may be required to drive the switch. When large currents are switched at high frequencies, e.g. in [[DC-to-DC converter]]s or large [[electric motors]], multiple transistors are sometimes provided in parallel, so as to provide sufficiently high switching currents and switching power.

The switching signal for a transistor is usually generated by a logic circuit or a [[microcontroller]], which provides an output signal that typically is limited to a few milliamperes of current. Consequently, a transistor which is directly driven by such a signal would switch very slowly, with correspondingly high power loss. During switching, the gate capacitor of the transistor may draw current so quickly that it causes a current overdraw in the logic circuit or microcontroller, causing overheating which leads to permanent damage or even complete destruction of the chip. To prevent this from happening, a gate driver is provided between the microcontroller output signal and the power transistor.

[[Charge pump]]s are often used in [[H-Bridge]]s in ''high side drivers'' for gate driving the high side n-channel [[power MOSFET]]s and [[IGBT]]s. These devices are used because of their good performance, but require a gate drive voltage a few volts above the power rail. When the centre of a half bridge goes low the capacitor is charged via a diode, and this charge is used to later drive the gate of the high side FET gate a few volts above the source or emitter pin's voltage so as to switch it on. This strategy works well provided the bridge is regularly switched and avoids the complexity of having to run a separate power supply and permits the more efficient n-channel devices to be used for both high and low switches.

'''General Purpose Serial Interface''', also known as '''GPSI''', '''7-wire interface''', or '''7WS''', is a 7 wire communications interface. It is used as an interface between [[Ethernet]] [[Media Access Control|MAC]] and [[PHY]] blocks.

Data is received and transmitted using separate data paths (TXD, RXD) and separate data clocks (TXCLK, RXCLK). Other signals consist of transmit enable (TXEN), receive carrier sense (CRS), and collision (COL).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5893">'''Heat-shrinkable sleeve''' (or commonly "shrink sleeve") is a [[corrosion]] protective coating for [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]]s in the form of a wraparound or tubular sleeve that is field-applied.

== History ==

The first heat-shrinkable sleeves were introduced{{when?|date=October 2014}} as [[polyethylene]] pipeline coatings started to replace bituminous or tape coatings in the oil and gas industry. At the time, the processing for polyethylene to make the sleeve backing was new technology and the adhesives used in sleeves were much the same as those used on pipeline coating.

The technology used to make sleeves has advanced significantly since then, with new methods of cross-linking the [[polyolefin]] backings and new-generation adhesives that are formulated to provide performance under more-demanding pipeline conditions.&lt;ref&gt;''"Coating properties and test procedures.: An article from: Pipeline &amp; Gas Journal "''''' written by J.M. Leeds (April 2, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition &amp; Manufacture ==

===Polyolefin Backing===

Heat-shrinkable means just that, heat them up and they shrink, or more correctly, they recover in length.  A heat-shrinkable sleeve starts out with a thick extruded poly olefin sheet (polyethylene or [[polypropylene]]) that is formulated to be cross-linkable.  After extruding the thick sheet, it is taken to the âbeamâ where it is passed under a unit that subjects the sheet to electron irradiation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/cms/?pid=1000806 Accelerator apps: heat-shrink tubing], Symmetry, Dimensions of Particle Physics. V. 7, Issue 2, Apr. 10&lt;/ref&gt;  The irradiation process cross-links the polyolefin.  This improves the molecular structure such that the polyolefin will work as part of a heat-shrinkable sleeve and provide the required level of mechanical protection while in-service.  It makes the polyolefin perform more like a tough, heat-resistant, elastic material or rubber,&lt;ref&gt;[http://berrycpg.com/covalence/covalenceprinciples.aspx Covalence, the Principles of Heat Shrinking], Berry Plastics&lt;/ref&gt; rather than like a plastic material.

After cross-linking, the sheet is stretched by feeding it into a machine that heats it up, stretches it and cools it down. Because the sheet has been cross-linked, after stretching, it will want to recover to its original length when re-heated.

In recent years, many manufacturers had already developed their technologies of extruding and expansion of polyolefin backing. In the past, the production process of backing was done by extruding, cross-linking and expansion. However, in order to increase the production efficiency, some of manufacturers expand the backing during extruding, and then send the backing to e-beam for the cross-linking process.

===Adhesives and Functions===

An [[adhesive]] is then applied to the sheet and various manufacturers use proprietary techniques depending on the type, [[viscosity]] and melting temperature of the adhesive.  The adhesive is the key to ultimate performance of the installed system, which is why different adhesive types will be specified depending on the pipeline operating conditions.

The adhesive has many functions; it adheres the installed sleeve to the [[steel]] at the coating cutback and mainline coating, it resists shear forces imparted by soil pressure after the pipeline is buried and provides long term corrosion protection to the steel. The choice of which adhesive to use is based on the pipeline design and operating conditions.  As an example, for small diameter flow lines operating at ambient temperatures, a soft mastic-based adhesive may be chosen, while on large diameter pipelines operating at higher temperatures, a hard, semi-crystalline [[hot-melt adhesive]] is used.  The adhesive needs to be chosen based on its corrosion protection properties, adhesion strength, and resistance to shear forces imparted by pipe movement and the effects of soil pressures.

The coated sheet is then cut into individual sleeves suitable for application on a pipeline.  As mentioned before, the sheet is stretched and wants to recover when heated, so a sealing strip or âclosureâ is applied during sleeve installation so that the sleeve will stay in place during and after recovery.

===Epoxy Primer===

A final component is an optional [[epoxy]] primer.  Primers for heat-shrinkable sleeves work in the same manner as an FBE primer does when it is specified on 3-layer polyolefin pipeline coatings and is typically applied between 150&amp;nbsp;Âµm and 300&amp;nbsp;Âµm thick. Usually, the primer of heat shrinkable sleeve is two components non-solvent Epoxy, one is primer base and the other is curing agent.

== Use ==

When steel pipelines are built, they commonly consist of  10~12m long sections of steel pipe that has had a corrosion [[Industrial coatings|protective coating]] applied to it in a factory.  The factory will leave an uncoated area at each end of the pipe called a âcutbackâ so that when welding the pipe sections together, the coating is not damaged. Heat-shrinkable sleeves are applied onto the cutback at the field weld or âfield jointâ during the construction of a pipeline.

As described above, the heat-shrinkable sleeves have an adhesive that sticks the sleeve to the cutback and the factory applied mainline coating and also acts as a corrosion protective layer.  The backing provides mechanical protection against abrasion and soil stress forces after the pipeline is buried.

Heat wrap tape may used in addition for pipe bends, or as an alternative method for wrapping the whole pipe.

[[File:Hori-hori illustration.svg|thumb|400px|An illustration of a hori-hori or weeding knife]]
A '''Hori-Hori''', sometimes referred to as a "soil knife" or a "weeding knife", is a heavy serrated multi-purpose steel blade for gardening jobs such as digging or cutting. The blade is sharp on both sides and comes to a semi-sharp point at the end.

The word âHoriâ (ããª) means "to dig" in Japanese and "hori-hori" is the [[onomatopoeia]] for a digging sound. The tool itself is commonly referred to as a ã¬ã¸ã£ã¼ãã¤ã, "leisure knife" or a å±±èãã¤ã, "[[Sansai]](=Mountain-vegetable)knife" in Japan.

==Description and uses==
The size of the knife varies from eleven to fifteen inches in total length, depending on the size of the handle. The size of the blade can vary, but it is normally around 6{{fraction|7|8}}â Ã 1{{fraction|3|4}}â.

The stainless steel blade is often polished to a mirror-like finish and is usually paired with a scabbard. 

The blade is razor sharp and is serrated for cutting through roots and tough soil. Functions include a knife, a saw, a digging tool, or as a measuring device for planting bulbs.

The Hori-Hori has uses in gardening such as weeding, cutting roots, transplanting, removing plants, sod cutting, and splitting [[perennial plant|perennial]]s. The blade is made of carbon or stainless steel that is concave shaped to make it ideal for digging and prying. The blade has a large smooth wooden handle for comfortable use with one hand. It can serve as a small hand axe.

== History ==
The Hori-Hori digging tool, first implemented in Japan, was originally used for carefully excavating plants such as [[Sansai]] in the mountains .

[[File:Lipliner.jpg|thumb|Lip liner]]
'''Lip liner''', also known as a '''lip pencil''', is a [[cosmetics|cosmetic]] product. It is intended to fill in uneven areas on the outer edges of the lips before applying [[lipstick]] to give a smoother shape. It is also used to outline the lips, keeping lipstick inside the lip area and preventing it from "bleeding", creating a bigger contrast and making the lips stand out more. Alternatively, lip liner can be used to fill in the entire lip before the application of lipstick, and in some cases is worn as a lipstick on its own. The product is usually sold in a retractable tube or pencil form which can be sharpened. Lip liner is usually available in the same range of colors as lipsticks: e.g., reds, pinks, browns, plums, etc. Lip liner also comes in invisible, for giving the illusion of smooth lips without adding or affecting color.&lt;ref name=Color/&gt;

==Ingredients==
Like lipstick, lip liners are composed of waxes, oils, and pigment. Compared to lipstick, lip liners are firmer in consistency and more deeply pigmented, making them suitable for drawing on to the lip with precision. For these reasons, lip liners have less oil but more wax and pigment than most lipsticks. A popular wax used in the making of lip liners is [[Japan wax]].&lt;ref name=Color&gt;J. Cunningham "Color cosmetics" in Chemistry and Technology of the Cosmetics and Toiletries Industry Editors D. F. Williams, Mr W. H. Schmitt. Springer. {{ISBN|978-94-010-7194-9}} (Print)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brands ==
Designer brands such as [[Chanel]], [[Christian Dior SE|Dior]], and [[Marc Jacobs]] produce their own lip liners.  Other brands include but are not limited to [[Urban Decay (cosmetics)|Urban Decay]], [[Clinique]], and [[MAC Cosmetics]].

{{History of science and technology in China}}

[[History of Science and Technology in China|China]] has been the source of many [[innovations]], [[scientific]] [[discovery (observation)|discoveries]] and [[invention]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Needham]], ''[[Science and Civilisation in China]]'', 1954â2008, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the ''[[Four Great Inventions]]'': [[papermaking]], the [[compass]], [[gunpowder]], and [[History of typography in East Asia|printing]] (both [[Woodblock printing|woodblock]] and [[movable type]]). The list below contains these and other inventions in China attested by archaeological or historical evidence.

The historical region now known as China experienced a [[History of science and technology in China|history]] involving [[mechanics]], [[hydraulics]] and [[mathematics]] applied to [[horology]], [[metallurgy]], [[astronomy]], [[agriculture]], [[engineering]], [[music theory]], [[Artisan|craftsmanship]], [[Maritime history|naval architecture]] and [[warfare]]. By the [[Warring States period]] (403â221 BC), inhabitants of the Warring States had advanced metallurgic technology, including the [[blast furnace]] and [[cupola furnace]], while the [[finery forge]] and [[Puddling (metallurgy)|puddling process]] were known by the [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BCâAD 220). A sophisticated economic system in imperial China gave birth to inventions such as [[Banknote|paper money]] during the [[Song Dynasty]] (960â1279). The invention of gunpowder during the mid 9th century led to an array of inventions such as the [[fire lance]], [[land mine]], [[naval mine]], [[hand cannon]], exploding cannonballs, multistage [[rocket]] and [[Huolongjing#Fire arrows and rockets|rocket bombs with aerodynamic wings and explosive payloads]]. With the navigational aid of the 11th century compass and ability to steer at high sea with the 1st century sternpost [[Rudder#China|rudder]], premodern Chinese sailors sailed as far as [[East Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Bowman (2000), 104â105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levathes (1994), 37â38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hsu (1988), 96.&lt;/ref&gt; In water-powered clockworks, the premodern Chinese had used the [[escapement]] mechanism since the 8th century and the endless power-transmitting [[chain drive]] in the 11th century. They also made large mechanical puppet theaters driven by [[waterwheel]]s and [[spoke|carriage wheels]] and wine-serving [[automaton]]s driven by paddle wheel boats.

The contemporaneous [[Peiligang culture|Peiligang]] and [[Pengtoushan culture]]s represent the oldest [[List of Neolithic cultures of China|Neolithic cultures of China]] and were formed around 7000 BC.&lt;ref name="bellwood 2005 106"&gt;Bellwood (2006), 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the first inventions of Neolithic China include semilunar and rectangular stone knives, stone [[Hoe (tool)|hoes]] and spades, the cultivation of [[Foxtail millet|millet]], rice, and the [[soybean]], the refinement of [[sericulture]], the building of [[rammed earth]] structures with [[lime (material)|lime]]-plastered house floors, the [[Chinese ceramics|creation of pottery]] with cord-mat-basket designs, the creation of pottery tripods and pottery steamers and the development of ceremonial vessels and [[scapulimancy]] for purposes of [[divination]].&lt;ref&gt;Needham (2004) p201.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bray 1978 24"&gt;Bray (1978), 24â26.&lt;/ref&gt; The British sinologist Francesca Bray argues that the domestication of the [[ox]] and [[domestic buffalo|buffalo]] during the [[Longshan culture]] (c. 3000âc. 2000 BC) period, the absence of Longshan-era [[irrigation]] or high-yield crops, full evidence of Longshan cultivation of dry-land cereal crops which gave high yields "only when the soil was carefully cultivated," suggest that the [[plough]] was known at least by the Longshan culture period and explains the high agricultural production yields which allowed the rise of Chinese civilization during the [[Shang Dynasty]] (c. 1600âc. 1050 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Bray (1978), 27â28.&lt;/ref&gt; Later inventions such as the [[Seed drill|multiple-tube seed drill]] and [[Heavy plough|heavy moldboard iron plough]] enabled China to sustain a much larger population through greater improvements in agricultural output.

For the purposes of this list, inventions are regarded as technological firsts developed in China, and as such does not include foreign technologies which the Chinese acquired through contact, such as the [[windmill]] from the [[Middle East]] or the [[telescope]] from [[early modern Europe]]. It also does not include technologies developed elsewhere and later invented separately by the Chinese, such as the [[odometer]], [[water wheel]], and [[chain pump]]. Scientific, mathematical or [[List of Chinese discoveries|natural discoveries]], changes in minor concepts of design or style and artistic innovations do not appear on the list.

==Four Great Inventions==
{{Main|Four Great Inventions}}
The following is a list of the ''Four Great Inventions''âas designated by [[Joseph Needham]] (1900â1995), a British scientist, author and [[sinologist]] known for his research on the history of Chinese science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 1, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paper===
:''This sub-section is about paper making; for the writing material first used in [[ancient Egypt]], see [[papyrus]].''
Although it is recorded that the Han Dynasty (202 BC&amp;nbsp;â AD 220) court eunuch [[Cai Lun]] (50 AD&amp;nbsp;â AD 121) invented the pulp [[papermaking]] process and established the use of new materials used in making [[paper]], ancient padding and wrapping paper artifacts dating to the 2nd century BC have been found in China, the oldest example of pulp papermaking [[Chinese cartography|being a map]] from [[Fangmatan]], [[Tianshui]];&lt;ref&gt;Buisseret (1998), 12.&lt;/ref&gt; by the 3rd century, paper as a writing medium [[History of the Han Dynasty#Reign of Wu|was in widespread use]], replacing traditional but more expensive writing mediums such as strips of [[bamboo]] rolled into threaded scrolls, strips of [[silk]], wet [[clay tablet]]s hardened later in a furnace, and wooden tablets.&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1985), Volume 5, Part 1, 1â2, 40â41, 122â123, 228.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bowman 2000 594"&gt;Bowman (2000), 594.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tom 1989 99"&gt;Tom (1989), 99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="day mcneil 122"&gt;Day &amp; McNeil (1996), 122.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cotterell (2004), 11â13.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known piece of paper with writing on it was discovered in the ruins of a Chinese watchtower at Tsakhortei, [[Alxa League]], where Han Dynasty troops had deserted their position in AD 110 following a [[Xiongnu]] attack.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterell (2004), 11.&lt;/ref&gt; In the paper making process established by Cai in 105, a boiled mixture of [[Morus (plant)|mulberry tree]] bark, hemp, old linens and fish nets created a pulp that was pounded into paste and stirred with water; a wooden frame sieve with a mat of sewn reeds was then dunked into the mixture, which was then shaken and then dried into sheets of paper that were bleached under the exposure of sunlight; K.S. Tom says this process was gradually improved through leaching, polishing and glazing to produce a smooth, strong paper.&lt;ref name="tom 1989 99"/&gt;&lt;ref name="day mcneil 122"/&gt;

===Printing===

[[File:Yuan dynasty banknote with its printing plate 1287.jpg|thumb|left|Yuan dynasty banknote with its printing wood plate 1287.]]

:''For the separate invention of movable type printing in medieval Europe, see [[printing press]] and [[Johannes Gutenberg]]''.
'''[[Woodblock printing]]''': The earliest specimen of woodblock printing is a single-sheet ''[[dharani]]'' sutra in [[Sanskrit]] that was printed on hemp paper between 650 and 670 AD; it was unearthed in 1974 from a Tang tomb near [[Xi'an]].&lt;ref&gt;Pan (1997), 979â980.&lt;/ref&gt; A Korean miniature ''dharani'' Buddhist [[sutra]] discovered in 1966, bearing [[Chinese characters of Empress Wu|extinct Chinese writing characters]] used only during the reign of China's only self-ruling empress, [[Wu Zetian]] (r.690â705), is dated no earlier than 704 and preserved in a [[Unified Silla|Silla Korean]] temple [[stupa]] built in 751.&lt;ref&gt;Needham and Tsien (1985), Volume 5, Part 1, 149â150.&lt;/ref&gt; The first printed periodical, the [[Kaiyuan Za Bao]] was made available in AD 713. However, the earliest known book printed at regular size is the ''[[Diamond Sutra]]'' made during the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618â907), a 5.18&amp;nbsp;m (17&amp;nbsp;ft) long scroll which bears the date 868 AD.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 1 151"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 5, Part 1, 151.&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Needham and [[Tsien Tsuen-hsuin]] write that the cutting and printing techniques used for the [[Chinese calligraphy|delicate calligraphy]] of the ''Diamond Sutra'' book are much more advanced and refined than the miniature ''dharani'' sutra printed earlier.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 1 151"/&gt;

[[File:Chinese movable type 1313-ce.png|left|thumb|An illustration published in [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen's]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 1290â1333) book of AD 1313 showing [[movable type]] characters arranged by rhyme scheme in round table compartments]]

'''[[Movable type]]''': The polymath scientist and official [[Shen Kuo]] (1031â1095) of the Song Dynasty (960â1279) was the first to describe the process of movable type printing in his ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'' of 1088. He attributed the innovation of reusable fired clay characters to a little-known artisan named [[Bi Sheng]] (990â1051).&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Volume 5, Part 1, 201â202.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gernet 1996 335"&gt;Gernet (1996), 335.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bowman 2000 599"&gt;Bowman (2000), 599.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="day mcneil 70"&gt;Day &amp; McNeil (1996), 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Bi had experimented with wooden type characters, but their use was not perfected until 1297 to 1298 with the model of the official [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]] (fl. 1290â1333) of the [[Yuan Dynasty]] (1271â1368), who also arranged written characters by rhyme scheme on the surface of round table compartments.&lt;ref name="gernet 1996 335"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 5, Part 1, 205â207.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 1490 with the printed works of [[Hua Sui]] (1439â1513) of the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368â1644) that the Chinese perfected metal movable type characters, namely [[bronze]].&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Volume 5, Part 1, 212.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bowman 2000 601"/&gt; The [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644â1912) scholar Xu Zhiding of [[Tai'an]], [[Shandong]] developed [[vitreous enamel]] movable type printing in 1718.&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 5, Part 1, 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gunpowder===
[[File:Chinese Gunpowder Formula.JPG|thumb|Earliest known written formula for gunpowder, from the ''[[Wujing Zongyao]]'' of 1044 AD.]]
Evidence of [[gunpowder]]'s first use in China comes from the [[Tang dynasty]] (618â907).&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 8â9, 80â82.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known recorded [[History of gunpowder|recipes for gunpowder were written]] by Zeng Gongliang, Ding Du and Yang Weide in the ''[[Wujing Zongyao]]'', a military manuscript compiled in 1044 during the Song Dynasty (960â1279). Its gunpowder formulas describe the use of [[Incendiary device|incendiary bombs]] launched from [[catapult]]s, thrown down from [[Chinese city wall|defensive walls]], or lowered down the wall by use of iron chains operated by a swape lever.&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 5, Part 7, 70â73, 120â124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gernet 1996 311"&gt;Gernet (1996), 311.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Day &amp; McNeil (1996), 785.&lt;/ref&gt; Bombs launched from [[trebuchet]] catapults mounted on [[forecastle]]s of naval ships ensured the victory of Song over [[Jin Dynasty (1115-1234)|Jin forces]] at the [[Battle of Caishi]] in 1161, while the Mongol Yuan Dynasty (1271â1368) [[:Image:Mooko-Suenaga.jpg|used gunpowder bombs]] during their [[Mongol invasions of Japan|failed invasion of Japan]] in 1274 and 1281.&lt;ref name="gernet 1996 311"/&gt; During the 13th and 14th centuries, gunpowder formulas became more potent (with [[nitrate]] levels of up to 91%) and gunpowder weaponry more advanced and deadly, as evidenced in the Ming Dynasty (1368â1644) military manuscript ''[[Huolongjing]]'' compiled by [[Jiao Yu]] (fl. 14th to early 15th century) and [[Liu Bowen]] (1311â1375). It was completed in 1412, a long while after Liu's death, with a preface added by the Jiao in its [[Nanyang, Henan|Nanyang]] publication.&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 5, Part 7, 24â25, 345â346.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compass===
[[File:Antic chinese Compass.jpg|thumb|A model in [[Kaifeng]] of a Chinese ladle-and-bowl type [[compass]] used for [[geomancy]] in the Han Dynasty (202 BC&amp;nbsp;â 220 AD); the historical authenticity of the model has been questioned by [[Li Shu-hua]] (1954).&lt;ref name="Li Shu-hua 176, 180"&gt;Li Shu-hua (1954), 176, 180.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Although an ancient [[hematite]] artifact from the [[Olmec]] era in [[Mexico]] dating to roughly 1000 BC indicates the possible use of the [[lodestone]] [[compass]] long before it was described in China, the Olmecs did not have [[iron]] which the Chinese would discover could be magnetised by contact with lodestone.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1975), 753â760.&lt;/ref&gt; Descriptions of lodestone attracting iron were made in the ''Guanzi'', ''[[Lushi Chunqiu|Master Lu's Spring and Autumn Annals]]'' and ''[[Huainanzi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Blanc (1985), 125, 128, 132â133, 136.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knoblock (2001), 218.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rickett (1998), 426.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese by the Han Dynasty (202 BC&amp;nbsp;â 220 AD) began using north-south oriented lodestone ladle-and-bowl shaped [[compass]]es for [[divination]] and [[geomancy]] and not yet for [[navigation]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1975), 755.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gernet 1962 77"&gt;Gernet (1962), 77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tom (1989), 98â99.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Lunheng]]'', written by Han dynasty writer, scientist, and philosopher [[Wang Chong]] (27&amp;nbsp;â c. 100 AD) stated in chapter 52: "This instrument resembles a spoon and when it is placed on a plate on the ground, the handle points to the south".&lt;ref&gt;Lacheisserie (2005), 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aczel (2002), 80.&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, another two references under chapter 47 of the same text to the attractive power of a magnet according to Needham (1986),&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 1, see 261 footnote. f for ch. 52 on ladle and 232 footnote. d for ch. 47 on magnet (c.f. ''Lunheng'' [[:zh:s:è®ºè¡¡/52|ch. 52]] &amp; [[:zh:s:è®ºè¡¡/47|ch. 47]]).&lt;/ref&gt; but Li Shu-hua (1954) considers it to be lodestone, and states that there is no explicit mention of a magnet in ''Lunheng''.&lt;ref name="Li Shu-hua 176, 180"/&gt; The Chinese polymath [[Shen Kuo]] (1031â1095) of the Song Dynasty (960â1279) was the first to accurately describe both [[magnetic declination]] (in discerning [[true north]]) and the [[History of the compass|magnetic needle compass]] in his ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'' of 1088, while the Song dynasty writer [[Zhu Yu (author)|Zhu Yu]] (fl. 12th century) was the first to mention use of the compass specifically for navigation at sea in his book published in 1119.&lt;ref name="bowman 2000 599"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gernet 1962 77"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sivin (1995), III, 21â22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 1, 279.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elisseeff (2000), 296.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gernet (1996), 328.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="day mcneil 1996 636"/&gt; Even before this, however, the ''[[Wujing Zongyao]]'' military manuscript compiled by 1044 described a [[thermoremanence]] compass of heated iron or [[steel]] shaped as a fish and placed in a bowl of water which produced a weak magnetic force via [[remanence]] and induction; the ''Wujing Zongyao'' recorded that it was used as a pathfinder along with the mechanical [[south-pointing chariot]].&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 1, 252.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sivin (1995), III, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Alcoholic beverage]]''' and the process of '''[[Fermentation in food processing|fermentation]]''': The earliest archaeological evidence of [[fermentation]] and the consumption of alcoholic beverages was discovered in [[neolithic]] China dating from 7000â6600 BC. Examination and analysis of ancient pottery jars from the neolithic village of [[Jiahu]] in [[Henan]] province in northern China revealed fermented residue left behind by the alcoholic beverages they once contained. According to a study published in the ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'', chemical analysis of the residue revealed that the fermented drink was made from fruit, rice and [[honey]].&lt;ref name="mcgovern"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=McGovern |first1=P.

With the emergence of other kinds of bells during the Shang Dynasty (c. 1600&amp;nbsp;â c. 1050 BC), they were relegated to subservient functions; at Shang and [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]] sites, they are also found as part of the horse-and-chariot gear and as collar-bells of dogs.&lt;ref&gt;Falkenhausen (1994), 134.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Coffin|Coffin, wooden]]''': The earliest evidence of wooden coffin remains, dated at 5000 BC, was found in the Tomb 4 at Beishouling, [[Shaanxi]]. Clear evidence of a wooden coffin in the form of a rectangular shape was found in Tomb 152 in an early [[Banpo]] site.

The oldest silk found in China comes from the [[List of Neolithic cultures of China|Chinese Neolithic period]] and is dated to about 3630 BC, found in [[Henan]] province.&lt;ref name="schoeser 2007 17"&gt;Schoeser (2007), 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Silk items excavated from the [[Liangzhu culture]] site at Qianshanyang, [[Wuxing District]], [[Zhejiang]] date to roughly 2570 BC, and include silk threads, a braided silk belt and a piece of woven silk.&lt;ref name="schoeser 2007 17"/&gt; A bronze fragment found at the Shang Dynasty (c. 1600&amp;nbsp;â c. 1050 BC) site at [[Anyang]] (or [[Yinxu]]) contains the first known [[Oracle bone script|written reference]] to silk.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons (1950), 87.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Soybean|Soybean cultivation]]''': The cultivation of soybeans began in the eastern half of northern China by 2000 BC, but is almost certainly much older.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy (2007), 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Liu et al. (1997) stated that soybean originated in China and was domesticated about 3500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Siddiqi (2001), 389&lt;/ref&gt; By the 5th century, soybeans were being cultivated in much of East Asia, but the crop did not move beyond this region until well into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy (2007), 122â123.&lt;/ref&gt; Written records of the cultivation and use of the soybean in China date back at least as far as the [[Western Zhou Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Murphy (2007), 135.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Wet field cultivation]]''' and '''[[paddy field]]''': Wet field cultivation, or the paddy field, was developed in China. The earliest paddy field dates to 6280 BP, based on carbon dating of the grains of rice and [[soil organic matter]] found at the Chaodun site in Kushan County.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Cao |first1=Zhihong |last2=Fu |first2=Jianrong |last3=Zou |first3=Ping |last4=Huang |first4=Jing Fa |last5=Lu |first5=Hong |last6=Weng |first6=Jieping |last7=Ding |first7=Jinlong |title=Origin and chronosequence of paddy soils in China. |journal=Proceedings of the 19th World Congress of Soil Science |date=August 2010 |pages=39â42 |url=http://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20123011310.html |accessdate=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paddy fields have also been excavated by archaeologists at Caoxieshan, a site of the Neolithic [[Majiabang culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Fujiwara, H.

[[File:Zodiaco Chino.jpg|thumb|[[Bronze mirror]] of the [[Sui Dynasty]] (581â618) showing the twelve divisions of the [[Chinese astrology|Chinese zodiac]], the latter of which goes back to the [[Warring States period]] (403â221 BC) in China]]
* '''[[Acupuncture]]''': Acupuncture, the [[Traditional Chinese medicine|traditional Chinese medicinal]] practice of inserting needles into specific points of the body for therapeutic purposes and relieving pain, was first mentioned in the ''[[Huangdi Neijing]]'' compiled from the 3rd to 2nd centuries BC ([[Warring States period]] to Han Dynasty).&lt;ref name="omura 15"&gt;Omura (2003), 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest known acupuncture sticks made of [[gold]], found in the tomb of [[Liu Sheng, Prince of Zhongshan|Liu Sheng]] (d. 113 BC), date to the Western Han (203 BC&amp;nbsp;â 9 AD); the oldest known stone-carved depiction of acupuncture was made during the Eastern Han (25â220 AD); the oldest known bronze statue of an acupuncture [[mannequin]] dates to 1027 during the Song Dynasty (960â1279).&lt;ref&gt;Omura (2003), 19 &amp; 22.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Chinese astrology|Animal zodiac]]''': The earliest and most complete version of the animal zodiac mentions twelve animals which differ slightly from the modern version (for instance, the [[Dragon (zodiac)|Dragon]] is absent, represented by a worm).&lt;ref&gt;Zhao (2000), 6â9.&lt;/ref&gt; Each animal matches the [[Earthly Branches]] and were written on bamboo slips from [[Shuihudi Qin bamboo texts|Shuihudi]], dated to the late 4th century BC,&lt;ref name="loewe 1999 847"&gt;Loewe (1999), 847.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as from Fangmatan, dating to the late 3rd century BC.&lt;ref name="loewe 1999 847"/&gt; Before these archaeological finds, the ''[[Lunheng]]'' written by [[Wang Chong]] (27&amp;nbsp;â c. 100 AD) during the 1st century provided the earliest transmitted example of a complete duodenary animal cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Sterckx (2002), 66â67.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Armillary sphere#China|Armillary sphere, hydraulic-powered]]''': [[Hipparchus]] (c. 190&amp;nbsp;â c. 120 BC)&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1904), 131.&lt;/ref&gt; credited the Ancient Greek mathematician, geographer, astronomer, and poet [[Eratosthenes]] (276â194 BC) as the first to invent the armillary sphere representing the [[celestial sphere]]. However, the Chinese astronomer Geng Shouchang of the Han Dynasty (202 BC&amp;nbsp;â 220 AD) invented it separately in China in 52 BC, while the Han dynasty polymath [[Zhang Heng]] (78â139 AD) was the first to apply motive power to the rotating armillary sphere by a set of complex gears rotated by a [[waterwheel]] which in turn was powered by the constant [[pressure head]] of an inflow [[Water clock|clepsydra clock]], the latter of which he improved with an extra compensating tank between the reservoir and the inflow vessel.&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 2, 30 &amp; 479 footnote e.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 1050"&gt;Crespigny (2007), 1050.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morton &amp; Lewis (2005), 70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Loewe (1968), 107.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bowman 2000 595"&gt;Bowman (2000), 595.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Artillery]]''': Early Chinese artillery had vase-like shapes. This includes the "long range awe inspiring" cannon dated from 1350 and found in the 14th century Ming Dynasty treatise ''[[Huolongjing]]''.&lt;ref name="needham314316"&gt;{{Harvnb|Needham|1987|pages=314â316}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the development of better metallurgy techniques, later cannons abandoned the vase shape of early Chinese artillery. This change can be seen in the bronze "thousand ball thunder cannon," an early example of [[field artillery]].&lt;ref name="Science and Civilisation in China"&gt;{{cite book|first=Joseph|last=Needham|year=1987|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|title=Science &amp; Civilisation in China, volume 7: The Gunpowder Epic|isbn=0-521-30358-3|pages=317â319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Bamboo and wooden slips]]''': Bamboo and wooden slips ({{zh|s=ç®ç|p=jiÇndÃº}}) were the main medium for documents in China before the widespread introduction of paper by the 2nd century AD. (Silk was occasionally used, but was prohibitively expensive.) The long, narrow strips of wood or bamboo typically carry a single column of brush-written text each, with space for several tens of visually complex ancient Chinese characters. For longer texts, many slips may be bound together in sequence with thread. Each strip of wood or bamboo is said to be as long as a chopstick and as wide as two. The earliest surviving examples of wood or bamboo slips date from the 5th century BC during the Warring States period. However, references in earlier texts surviving on other media make it clear that some precursor of these Warring States period bamboo slips was in use as early as the late Shang period (from about 1250 BC). Bamboo or wooden strips were the standard writing material during the Han dynasty and excavated examples have been found in abundance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Loewe|first=Michael|chapter=Wood and bamboo administrative documents of the Han period|editor=Edward L. Shaughnessy| title=New Sources of Early Chinese History|publisher=Society for the Study of Early China|year=1997|pages=161â192|isbn=1-55729-058-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bamboo tablets were used to write on before paper was invented by [[Cai Lun]] during the Han dynasty. Slats of bamboo stalks were sewn together used to make a kind of folding book.&lt;ref name="Perkins 1998 24"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Encyclopedia of China: History and Culture |last=Perkins |first=Dorothy |publisher=Routledge |year=1998 |isbn=978-1579581107 |pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the invention of [[History of paper|paper]] during the [[Science and technology of the Han dynasty|Han dynasty]] began to displace bamboo and wooden strips from mainstream uses, and by the 4th century AD bamboo had been largely phased out as a medium for writing in China.  
* '''[[Banknote]]''': Paper currency was [[Economy of the Song Dynasty#Paper currency|first developed in China]]. Its roots were in merchant [[receipt]]s of deposit during the Tang Dynasty (618â907), as [[Four occupations#The shang (å)|merchants]] and [[wholesaler]]s desired to avoid the heavy bulk of [[Chinese coins|copper coinage]] in large commercial transactions.&lt;ref&gt;Ebrey, Walthall, and Palais (2006), 156.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowman"&gt;Bowman (2000), 105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gernet 1962 80"&gt;Gernet (1962), 80.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Song Dynasty (960â1279), the central government adopted this system for their [[Salt in Chinese history|monopolized salt industry]], but a gradual reduction in copper productionâdue to closed mines and an enormous outflow of Song-minted copper currency into the Japanese, [[Southeast Asia]]n, [[Western Xia]] and [[Liao Dynasty]] economiesâencouraged the Song government in the early 12th century to issue government-printed paper currency alongside copper to ease the demand on their state mints and debase the value of copper.&lt;ref&gt;Ch'en (1965), 615â621.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 11th century, the Song Dynasty government authorised sixteen private [[bank]]s to issue notes of exchange in [[Sichuan]], but in 1023 the government commandeered this enterprise and set up an agency to supervise the manufacture of banknotes there. The earliest paper currency was limited to certain regions and could not be used outside specified bounds, but once paper was securely backed by gold and silver stores, the Song Dynasty government initiated a nationwide paper currency, between 1265 and 1274.&lt;ref name="gernet 1962 80"/&gt; The concurrent [[Jin Dynasty (1115-1234)|Jin Dynasty]] (1115â1234) also printed paper banknotes by at least 1214.&lt;ref&gt;Gernet (1962), 80â81.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Bellows|Bellows, hydraulic-powered]]''':  The manufacturing of different alloys in China often required a continuous stream of air that was able to be blown over through molten metals. The use of double-action piston bellows was described by Chinese philosopher [[Lao Tzu]] around 500 BC to produce a continuous stream of air.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Chronology of Science |last= Rezende |first= Lisa |publisher=Checkmark Books |year=2007 |isbn=978-0816071197 |publication-date=April 1, 2007 |pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is unknown if metallurgic bellows (i.e. air-blowing device) in the Han Dynasty (202 BC&amp;nbsp;â 220 AD) were of the leather bag type or the wooden fan type found in the later Yuan Dynasty (1279â1368), the Eastern Han dynasty mechanical engineer and politician [[Du Shi]] (d. 38 AD) applied the use of rotating [[waterwheel]]s to power the bellows of his [[blast furnace]] smelting [[Cast iron|iron]], a method which continued in use in China thereafter, as evidenced by subsequent records; it is a significant invention in that iron production yields were increased and it employed all the necessary components for converting rotary motion into [[reciprocating motion]].&lt;ref name="bowman 2000 595"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wagner (2001), 77â80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crespigny (2007), 184.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 2, 370â376.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Day &amp; McNeil (1996), 225.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Belt (mechanical)|Belt drive]]''': The mechanical belt drive, using a [[pulley]] machine, was first mentioned in the text the ''Dictionary of Local Expressions'' by the Han Dynasty philosopher, poet, and politician [[Yang Xiong (author)|Yang Xiong]] (53â18 BC) in 15 BC, used for a [[quilling]] machine that wound [[silk]] fibers on to [[bobbin]]s for [[Weaving|weavers']] shuttles.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 9 207208"/&gt; The belt drive is an essential component to the invention of the [[spinning wheel]].&lt;ref name="Needham 1986"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 2, 108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 9 160163"&gt;Needham (1988), Volume 5, Part 9, 160â163.&lt;/ref&gt; The belt drive was not only used in textile technologies, it was also applied to hydraulic powered bellows dated from the 1st century AD.&lt;ref name="Needham 1986"/&gt; 
* '''[[Belt hook]]''': The belt hook was a fastener used in China. Belt hooks date to the 7th century BC in China,&lt;ref name="Kipfer"&gt;{{cite book |author=Barbara Ann Kipfer |title=Encyclopedic Dictionary of Archaeology |date=30 April 2000 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-306-46158-3 |page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were made with bronze, iron, gold, and jade.&lt;ref name="Kipfer"/&gt; Texts claim that the belt hook arrived in China from Central Asia during the [[Warring States period]], but archaeological evidence of belt hooks in China predate the Warring States Period.&lt;ref name="Wagner1993"&gt;{{cite book |author=Donald B.

* '''[[Bintie]]''': Bintie ({{zh|t=ééµ|s=éé}}) was a type of refined iron, which was known for its hardness. It was often used in the making of Chinese weapons. The metal alloy was an important article of income in medieval [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan China]] as technological advances from the preceding Song dynasty improved Yuan smelting technology. Bintie was referred as "fine steel", due to its high carbon content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=India, China, and the World: A Connected History |last=Sen  |first=Tansen |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers |year=2017 |isbn=978-1442220911 |publication-date=September 20, 2017 |pages=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=China: A New Cultural History |last=Hsu |first=Cho-yun |last2=Cheng |first2= Joseph  Y.

* '''[[Biological pest control]]''':  The first report of the use of an insect species to control an insect pest comes from "Nan Fang Cao Mu Zhuang" (åæ¹èæ¨ç ''Plants of the Southern Regions'') (ca. 304 AD), attributed to [[Jin dynasty (265-420)|Western Jin dynasty]] botanist ''Ji Han'' (åµå«, 263â307), in which it is mentioned that "''[[Jiaozhi]] people sell ants and their nests attached to twigs looking like thin cotton envelopes, the reddish-yellow ant being larger than normal. Without such ants, southern citrus fruits will be severely insect-damaged''".&lt;ref name="http-server.carleton.ca"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://http-server.carleton.ca/~bgordon/Rice/papers/peng83.htm |title=Biological Control â One Of The Fine Traditions Of Ancient Chinese Agricultural Techniques |author=Peng, Shijiang |journal=Scientia Agricultura Sinica |date=1983 |volume=1 |pages=92â98 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220073341/http://http-server.carleton.ca/~bgordon/Rice/papers/peng83.htm |archivedate=2016-12-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ants used are known as ''huang gan'' (''huang'' = yellow, ''gan'' = citrus) ants (''[[Oecophylla smaragdina]]''). The practice was later reported by Ling Biao Lu Yi (late [[Tang dynasty|Tang Dynasty]] or Early [[Five Dynasties]]), in ''Ji Le Pian'' by ''Zhuang Jisu'' ([[Song Dynasty|Southern Song Dynasty]]), in the ''Book of Tree Planting'' by Yu Zhen Mu ([[Ming Dynasty]]), in the book ''Guangdong Xing Yu'' (17th century), ''Lingnan'' by Wu Zhen Fang (Qing Dynasty), in ''Nanyue Miscellanies'' by Li Diao Yuan, and others.&lt;ref name="http-server.carleton.ca"/&gt;
* '''[[Blast furnace]]''': Although [[cast iron]] tools and weapons have been found in China dating to the 5th century BC, the earliest discovered Chinese blast furnaces, which produced [[pig iron]] that could be remelted and refined as cast iron in the [[cupola furnace]], date to the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC, while the vast majority of early blast furnace sites discovered date to the Han Dynasty (202 BC&amp;nbsp;â 220 AD) period immediately following 117 BC with the [[Salt in Chinese History#Ancient China and the early empire|establishment of state monopolies over the salt and iron industries]] during the reign of [[Emperor Wu of Han]] (r. 141&amp;nbsp;â 87 BC); most ironwork sites discovered dating before 117 BC acted merely as [[Foundry|foundries]] which made castings for iron that had been smelted in blast furnaces elsewhere in remote areas far from population centres.&lt;ref name="wagner 7 36 37 64 68"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pigott (1999), 183â184.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Bombard (weapon)|Bombard weaponry]]''': The oldest representation of a bombard can be found in the Chinese town of Ta-tsu. In 1985, the Canadian historian Robin Yates visited the Buddhist cave temples when he saw a sculpture on the wall depicting a demon holding a hand-held bombard. The muzzle seems to have a blast and flames coming from it which some believe is proof of some type of super gun. Yates examined the cave and believed the drawings dated back to the late 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lu Gwei-Djen, Joseph Needham and Phan Chi-Hsing. Technology and Culture, Vol. 29, No. 3 (Jul., 1988), pp. 594-605&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Bomb|Bomb, cast iron]]''': The first accounts of bombs made of cast iron shells packed with explosive gunpowderâas opposed to earlier types of casingsâwere written in the 13th century in China.&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 5, Part 7, 170â174.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined for this bomb (i.e. "thunder-crash bomb") during a [[Jin Dynasty, 1115-1234|Jin Dynasty]] (1115â1234) naval battle of 1231 against the [[Mongols]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 171"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 5, Part 7, 171.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[History of Jin]]'' (compiled by 1345) states that in 1232, as the Mongol general [[Subutai]] (1176â1248) descended on the Jin stronghold of [[Kaifeng]], the defenders had a "thunder-crash bomb" which "consisted of gunpowder put into an iron container&amp;nbsp;... then when the fuse was lit (and the projectile shot off) there was a great explosion the noise whereof was like thunder, audible for more than a hundred ''[[Li (unit)|li]]'', and the vegetation was scorched and blasted by the heat over an area of more than [[Mu (area)|half a ''mou'']]. When hit, even [[Chinese armour|iron armour]] was quite pierced through."&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 171"/&gt; The Song Dynasty (960â1279) official Li Zengbo wrote in 1257 that [[arsenal]]s should have several hundred thousand iron bomb shells available and that when he was in [[Jingzhou]], about one to two thousand were produced each month for dispatch of ten to twenty thousand at a time to [[Xiangyang District, Xiangfan|Xiangyang]] and Yingzhou.&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 5, Part 7, 173â174.&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of this, as British sinologist, scientist, and historian [[Joseph Needham]] states, is that a "high-[[nitrate]] gunpowder mixture had been reached at last, since nothing less would have burst the iron casing."&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 170"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 5, Part 7, 170.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''[[Borehole|Borehole drilling]]''': By at least the Han Dynasty (202 BC&amp;nbsp;â 220 AD), the Chinese used deep borehole drilling for mining and other projects; The British sinologist and historian [[Michael Loewe]] states that borehole sites could reach as deep as 600&amp;nbsp;m (2000&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref name="loewe 1968 194"&gt;Loewe (1968), 194.&lt;/ref&gt; K.S.

The primary extant specimens of cannon from the 13th century are the [[Wuwei Bronze Cannon]] dated to 1227, the [[Heilongjiang hand cannon]] dated to 1288, and the [[Xanadu Gun]] dated to 1298. However, only the Xanadu gun contains an inscription bearing a date of production, so it is considered the earliest confirmed extant cannon.

* '''[[Cast iron]]''': Confirmed by archaeological evidence, cast iron, made from melting [[pig iron]], was developed in China by the early 5th century BC during the Zhou Dynasty (1122â256 BC), the oldest specimens found in a tomb of Luhe County in [[Jiangsu]] province; despite this, most of the early [[blast furnace]]s and [[cupola furnace]]s discovered in China date after the state iron monopoly under [[Emperor Wu of Han|Emperor Wu]] (r. 141â87 BC) was established in 117 BC, during the Han Dynasty (202 BC&amp;nbsp;â 220 AD); Donald Wagner states that a possible reason why no ancient Chinese [[bloomery]] process has been discovered thus far is because the iron monopoly, which lasted until the 1st century AD when it was abolished for private entrepreneurship and local administrative use, wiped out any need for continuing the less-efficient bloomery process that continued in use in other parts of the world.&lt;ref name="wagner 7 36 37 64 68"&gt;Wagner (2001), 7, 36â37, 64â68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ebrey, Walthall, and Palais (2006), 30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gernet (1996), 69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wagner (1993), 335.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pigott 1999 177"&gt;Pigott (1999), 177.&lt;/ref&gt; Wagner states that most iron tools in ancient China were made of cast iron in consideration of the low economic burden of producing cast iron, whereas most [[Military history of China (pre-1911)|iron military weapons]] were made of more costly [[wrought iron]] and [[steel]], signifying that "high performance was essential" and preferred for the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner (1993), 336.&lt;/ref&gt; As cast iron is comparatively brittle, it is not suitable for purposes where a sharp edge or flexibility is required. It is strong under compression, but not under tension.

* '''[[Imperial examination|Civil service examinations]]''': During the Han Dynasty (202 BC&amp;nbsp;â 220 AD), the ''[[xiaolian]]'' system of recruiting government officials through formal recommendations was the chief method of filling bureaucratic posts, although there was an [[Taixue|Imperial Academy]] to train potential candidates for office and some offices required its candidates to pass formal written tests before appointment.&lt;ref&gt;Crespigny (2007), 1222 &amp; 1232.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bielenstein (1980), 9 &amp; 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wang (1949), 152.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Loewe (1968), 45.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not until the [[Sui Dynasty]] (581â618) that [[civil service]] examinations became open to all adult males not belonging to the [[Four occupations|merchant class]] (although civil service examinations was a path to social advancement in Imperial Chinese society to candidates regardless of wealth, social status, or family background) and were used as a universal prerequisite for appointments to office, at least in theory.&lt;ref name="ebrey 2006 97"&gt;Ebrey (2006), 97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gasciogne and Gasciogne (2003), 95.&lt;/ref&gt; The civil service system was implemented on a much larger scale during the Song Dynasty (960â1279), when an elite core of dynastic-founding and professional families lost their majority in government to a broad strata of lesser [[Gentry (China)|gentry families]] from throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;Hartwell (1982), 416â420.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ebrey (1999), 145â146.&lt;/ref&gt; The civil examination system was later adopted by China's other East Asian neighbors Japan and Korea.&lt;ref&gt;Liu, Haifeng, ''Influence of Chinaâs Imperial Examinations on Japan, Korea and Vietnam'' -''Frontiers of History in China'', October 2007, Volume 2, Issue 4, pp 493-512&lt;/ref&gt; The imperial examination system attracted much attention and greatly inspired political theorists in the Western World, and as a Chinese institution was one of the earliest to receive such foreign attention.&lt;ref&gt;Kracke, 251&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese examination system was introduced to the Western world in reports by [[Europeans in Medieval China|European missionaries]] and diplomats, and encouraged the [[British East India Company]] to use a similar method to select prospective employees. Following the initial success in that company, the British government adopted a similar testing system for screening civil servants in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;Ssu-yu Teng, "Chinese Influence on the Western Examination System", ''Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies'' 7 (1942-1943):  267-312.&lt;/ref&gt; Other European nations, such as France and Germany, followed suit.

On one of the wooden scripts was written: âå½å©äºæå®ç®[[File:Counting rod v6.png|15px]]â. This is one of the earliest examples of using counting rod numerals in writing. In 1976, a bundle of [[Western Han]] counting rods made of bones was unearthed from [[Qianyang County]] in [[Shaanxi]].&lt;ref&gt;Wu Wenjun ed, Grand Series of History of Chinese Mathematics, vol 1, p371&lt;/ref&gt; The use of counting rods must predate it;  ''[[Laozi]]'' (6th or 5th century BCE) said "a good calculator doesn't use counting rods".&lt;ref&gt;èå­: åæ¸èä¸ç¨ç±ç­ã&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Book of Han]]'' recorded: "they calculate with bamboo, diameter one fen, length six cun, arranged into a hexagonal bundle of two hundred seventy one pieces". At first calculating rods were round in cross section, but by the time of the [[Sui dynasty]] triangular rods were used to represent positive numbers and rectangular rods were used for negative numbers.
*'''[[Crank (mechanism)|Crank]]''' and '''[[crankshaft]]''': The earliest hand-operated cranks appeared in China during the Han Dynasty (202 BC-220 AD), as Han era glazed-earthenware tomb models portray, and was used thereafter in China for silk-reeling and hemp-spinning, for the agricultural [[winnowing]] fan, in the water-powered flour-sifter, for hydraulic-powered metallurgic [[bellows]], and in the well [[windlass]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 118"&gt;Needham, Joseph.

The crank in its simple rudimentary form we find in the [modern] Chinese windlass, which use of the device, however, has apparently not given the impulse to change reciprocating into circular motion in other contrivances'. In China the crank was known, but remained dormant for at least nineteen centuries, its explosive potential for applied mechanics being unrecognized and unexploited.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Dao (sword)|Dao]]''': Daos are single-edged [[Chinese sword]]s, primarily used for slashing and chopping. The most common form is also known as the ''Chinese [[sabre]]'', although those with wider blades are sometimes referred to as ''Chinese [[broadswords]]''. In China, the dao is considered one of the four traditional weapons, along with the ''[[gun (staff)|gun]]'' (stick or staff), ''[[qiang (spear)|qiang]]'' (spear), and the ''[[jian]]'' (sword). The earliest dao date from the Shang Dynasty in China's [[Bronze Age]], and are known as ''zhibeidao'' (ç´èå)&amp;nbsp;â straight backed knives. As the name implies, these were straight-bladed or slightly curved weapons with a single edge. Originally bronze, these weapons were made of iron or steel by the time of the late [[Warring States]] period as metallurgical knowledge became sufficiently advanced to control the carbon content. Originally less common as a military weapon than the ''[[jian]]''&amp;nbsp;â the straight, double-edged blade of China&amp;nbsp;â the dao became popular with [[cavalry]] during the [[Han dynasty]] due to its sturdiness, superiority as a chopping weapon, and relative ease of use&amp;nbsp;â it was generally said that it takes a week to attain competence with a dao/saber, a month to attain competence with a ''qiang''/spear, and a year to attain competence with a ''jian''/straight sword. Soon after dao began to be issued to infantry, beginning the replacement of the ''jian'' as a standard-issue weapon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tom|2001|p=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Graff|2002|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Late Han dynasty dao had round grips and ring-shaped pommels, and ranged between 85 and 114 centimeters in length. These weapons were used alongside rectangular shields.{{sfn|Lorge|2011|pp=69-70}}

* '''[[Diabolo]]''': Chinese archaeologists theorize that Chinese Diabolos (or Chinese yo-yo) originated from Chinese spinning top. In [[Hemudu culture|Hemudu Excavation]], wooden tops were excavated. In order to extend the spinning time of the tops, whip were used to spin the top. This released a sound and gradually evolved into the term "Kongzhu" ({{zh|s=ç©ºç«¹|t=ç©ºç«¹|hp=KÅng zhÃº|l=Air Bamboo}} ). It was speculated that the Chinese poet [[Cao Zhi]] in the [[Three Kingdoms]] period had composed the poem "Rhapsody of Diabolos ãç©ºç«¹èµã", making it the first record of Diabolo in Chinese history. The authenticity of the poem "Rhapsody of Diabolos ãç©ºç«¹èµã" however required further research and evidence of proof. By the medieval Tang dynasty, Chinese Diabolo became widespread as a form of toy. The Taiwanese scholar Wu Shengda å³çé however argued that records of Chinese Diabolo only appeared during late [[Ming dynasty]] [[Wanli Emperor|Wanli]] period, with its details well recorded in the book ''[[Dijing Jingwulue]]'', referring to Diabolos as "Kong Zhong" ({{zh|s=ç©ºé|t=ç©ºé|hp=KÅng zhong|l=Air Bell}} ). Diabolos evolved from the Chinese yo-yo, which was originally standardized in the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Information about Chinese yo-yo|url = http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~yoyo/about.html|website = www.hcs.harvard.edu|access-date = 2016-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nature"&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=ja5MAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA212&amp;lpg=PA212&amp;dq=%22kouen+gen%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0HZfrkWDKW&amp;sig=fHsDemyhVrAYiykSwTqeKiI4-rM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjkqZepmsvQAhVJ92MKHUHtAgoQ6AEIRzAN#v=onepage&amp;q=%22kouen%20gen%22&amp;f=false Origin of Toys: The Chinese Kouen-gen]" (1893), ''Nature''. {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first mention of a diabolo in the Western World was made by a missionary, Father Amiot, in Beijing in 1792 during [[George Macartney, 1st Earl Macartney|Lord Macartney]]'s ambassadorship, after which examples were brought to Europe,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://diabolart.free.fr/histoire.html History]", ''DiabolArt.Free.Fr''. {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; as was the [[sheng (instrument)|sheng]] (eventually adapted to the [[harmonica]] and [[accordion]]).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.crosssound.com/CS00/CS00Instruments/CSTHEACCORDION/accordionENG.html The Accordion]", ''CrossSound.com''.

* '''[[Chinese dominoes|Dominoes]]''': The Ming Dynasty (1368â1644) writer Xie Zhaozhe (1567â1624) initiated the legend that [[dominoes]] were first presented to the imperial court in 1112.&lt;ref name="lo 2000 401"&gt;Lo (2000), 401.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the oldest confirmed written mention of dominoes in China comes from the ''Former Events in Wulin'' (i.e. the capital [[Hangzhou]]) written by the Yuan Dynasty (1271â1368) author Zhou Mi (1232â1298), who listed "''pupai''" (gambling plaques or dominoes) as well as [[dice]] as items sold by peddlers during the reign of [[Emperor Xiaozong of Song]] (r. 1162â1189).&lt;ref name="lo 2000 401"/&gt; Andrew Lo asserts that Zhou Mi meant dominoes when referring to ''pupai'', since the Ming author Lu Rong (1436â1494) explicitly defined ''pupai'' as dominoes (in regards to a story of a suitor who won a maiden's hand by drawing out four winning ''pupai'' from a set).&lt;ref name="lo 2000 401"/&gt; The earliest known manual written about dominoes is the ''Manual of the Xuanhe Period'' (1119â1125) written by Qu You (1347â1433).&lt;ref name="lo 2000 401"/&gt; In the ''Encyclopedia of a Myriad of Treasures'', Zhang Pu (1602â1641) described the game of laying out dominoes as ''pupai'', although the character for ''pu'' had changed (yet retained the same pronunciation).&lt;ref name="lo 2000 401"/&gt; Traditional Chinese domino games include [[Tien Gow]], [[Pai Gow]], Che Deng, and others.

* '''[[Dougong]]''': A ''dougong'' is a [[Bracket (architecture)|building bracket]] which is unique to [[Chinese architecture]]. Since at least the [[Western Zhou Dynasty]] (c. 1050â771 BC), they were placed between the top of a column and a crossbeam to support the concave roofs of beam-in-tier buildings which were archetypal of Chinese architecture.&lt;ref name="fletcher 693"&gt;Fletcher (1996), 693.&lt;/ref&gt; Each dougong is formed by double bow-shaped arms (æ±, ''gong'') supported by a wooden block (æ, ''dou'') on each side.&lt;ref name="fletcher 693"/&gt; ''Dougong'' were also used for decorative and ceremonial rather than entirely pragmatic purposes of support, such as on solid brick [[Chinese pagoda|pagodas]] like the [[Iron Pagoda]] built in 1049.

* '''[[Dragon boats]]''': The use of dragon boats for racing and dragons are believed by modern scholars, sinologists, and anthropologists to have originated in southern central China more than 2500 years ago, in [[Dongting Lake]] and along the banks of the Chang Jiang (now called the [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]]) during the same era when the Olympic games of [[ancient Greece]] were being established at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]).&lt;ref&gt;Worcester, George. ''The Junks and Sampans of the Yangtze River'', 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''[[Dragon kiln]]''': Dragon kilns were traditional Chinese kilns used for Chinese ceramics. According to recent excavations in [[Shangyu District]] in the northeast of [[Zhejiang]] province and elsewhere, the origins of the dragon kiln may go back as far as the [[Shang dynasty]] (c. 1600 to 1046 [[BCE]]), and is linked to the introduction of stoneware, fired at 1200&amp;nbsp;Â°C or more. These kilns were much smaller than later examples, at some 5â12 metres long, and also sloped far less.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, 348â350&lt;/ref&gt; The type had certainly developed by the [[Warring States period]],&lt;ref&gt;Wood&lt;/ref&gt; and by the [[Eastern Wu]] kingdom (220â280 CE), there were over 60 kilns at Shangyu. Thereafter it remained the main design used in southern China until the [[Ming dynasty]]. The pottery areas of south China are mostly hilly, whereas those on the plains of north China typically lack suitable slopes; here the [[mantou kiln]] type predominated.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 50â51; Rawson, 364â365&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nanfeng Kiln]] in [[Guangdong]] province is several centuries old and still functioning.

* '''[[Escapement]], hydraulic-powered (use in clockworks)''': Although the escapement mechanism was first invented by the Greek [[Philon of Byzantium]] for a mechanical [[washstand]],&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (2000b), 343â369 (356f.)&lt;/ref&gt; an escapement mechanism for clockworks was first developed by the Buddhist monk, court astronomer, mathematician and engineer [[Yi Xing]] (683â727) of the Tang Dynasty (618â907) for his water-powered celestial globe in the tradition of the Han dynasty polymath and inventor [[Zhang Heng]] (78â139), and could be found in later Chinese clockworks such as the [[clock tower]]s developed by the military engineer [[Zhang Sixun]] (fl. late 10th century) and polymath inventor [[Su Song]] (1020â1101).&lt;ref name="Bowman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gernet 1996 341"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 2, 89, 445â456, 473â475.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fry (2001), 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bodde (1991), 140.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Day &amp; McNeil (1996), 781, 786â787.&lt;/ref&gt; Yi Xing's escapement allowed for a bell to be rung automatically every hour, and a drum beaten automatically every quarter-hour, essentially a [[striking clock]].&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 2, 473â474.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the modern escapement which employs a suspended oscillating [[pendulum]] resting and releasing its hooks on a small rotating gear wheel, the early Chinese escapement employed the use of [[gravity]] and [[hydraulics]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 460 462"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 2, 460â462.&lt;/ref&gt; In Su Song's clock tower, scoop containers fixed to the spokes of a vertical [[waterwheel]] (which acted like a gear wheel) would be filled one by one with siphoned water from a [[Water clock|clepsydra tank]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 460"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 2, 460.&lt;/ref&gt; When the weight of the water in the scoop filled to an excess, it overcame a counterweight that in turn tripped a lever allowing the scoop to rotate on a pivot and drain its water.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 460"/&gt; However, as the scoop fell, it tripped a coupling tongue that temporarily pulled down on a long vertical chain, the latter yanking down on a balancing lever which would pull upward on a small chain connected to a locking arm, the latter lifting momentarily to release the top arrested spoke before coming back down to repeat the entire process over again.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 460"/&gt; It should be pointed out that the Chinese intermittently working liquid-driven escapement had "only the name in common" with the true mechanical escapement of medieval European mechanical clocks of the 14th century onwards, which worked instead with weights, producing continuous but discrete beats and that derived from the Greek and Roman verge mechanism (alarum)  device of earlier mechanisms.&lt;ref name="David Landes 18f."&gt;David Landes: "Revolution in Time: Clocks and the Making of the Modern World", rev. and enlarged edition, Harvard University Press, Cambridge 2000, {{ISBN|0-674-00282-2}}, p.18f.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Field mill (carriage)|Field mill]]''': In the ''Yezhongji'' ('Record of Affairs at the Capital Ye of the Later Zhao Dynasty') written by Lu Hui (fl. 350 AD), various mechanical devices are described which were invented by two [[Later Zhao]] (319â351) engineers known as Xie Fei, a Palace Officer, and Wei Mengbian, the Director of the Imperial Workshops.&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 2, 159â160, 256â257.&lt;/ref&gt; One of these is the field mill, which was essentially a cart with [[millstone]]s placed onto the frame; these were mechanically rotated by the movement of the cart's terrain wheels in order to grind wheat and other cereal crops.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 256"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 2, 256.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar vehicle these two invented was the "pounding cart", which had wooden statues mounted on the top which were actually mechanical figures who operated real [[Trip hammer|tilt hammers]] in order to [[Husk|hull]] rice; again, the device only functioned when the cart was moved forward and the wheels turned.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 256"/&gt; The field mill lost its use in China sometime after the Later Zhao, but it was invented separately in Europe in 1580 by the Italian military engineer [[Pompeo Targone]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 255"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 255.&lt;/ref&gt; It was featured in a treatise by the Italian engineer and writer [[Vittorio Zonca]] in 1607, and then in a [[Diagrams and explanations of the wonderful machines of the Far West|Chinese book]] of 1627 (concerning European technology) that was compiled and translated by the German [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] polymath [[Johann Schreck]] (1576â1630) and the Ming Dynasty (1368â1644) Chinese author Wang Zheng (çå¾µ 1571â1644), although by then it was considered by the Chinese to be an original Western contraption.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 255 256"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 2, 255â256.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Finery forge]]''': In addition to accidental lumps of low-carbon [[wrought iron]] produced by excessive injected air in Chinese [[cupola furnace]]s, the ancient Chinese also created wrought iron by using the finery forge at least by the 2nd century BC, the earliest specimens of [[Cast iron|cast]] and [[pig iron]] fined into wrought iron and [[steel]] found at the early Han Dynasty (202 BC&amp;nbsp;â 220 AD) site at Tieshengguo.&lt;ref name="pigott 1999 186"&gt;Pigott (1999), 186.&lt;/ref&gt; Pigott speculates that the finery forge existed in the previous [[Warring States period]] (403â221 BC), due to the fact that there are wrought iron items from China dating to that period and there is no documented evidence of the [[bloomery]] ever being used in China.&lt;ref name="pigott 1999 186 187"&gt;Pigott (1999), 186â187.&lt;/ref&gt; The fining process involved liquifying cast iron in a fining hearth and [[decarburization|removing carbon]] from the molten cast iron through [[Redox|oxidation]].&lt;ref name="pigott 1999 186"/&gt; Wagner writes that in addition to the Han Dynasty hearths believed to be fining hearths, there is also pictoral evidence of the fining hearth from a [[Shandong]] tomb mural dated 1st to 2nd century AD, as well as a hint of written evidence in the 4th century AD Daoist text ''[[Taiping Jing]]''.&lt;ref name="Wagner 2001, 80â83"&gt;Wagner (2001), 80â83.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Fire arrow]]''': One of the earliest weaponized forms of gunpowder was the fire arrow which received its name from the translated Chinese term ''huÇjiÃ n'' (ç«ç®­), which literally means fire arrow. In China a 'fire arrow' referred to a gunpowder projectile consisting of a bag of incendiary gunpowder attached to the shaft of an arrow from the 9th century onward. Later on solid fuel [[rocket]]s utilizing gunpowder were used to provide arrows with propulsive force and the term ''fire arrow'' became synonymous with rockets in the [[Chinese language]]. In other languages such as [[Sanskrit]] 'fire arrow' (''agni astra'') underwent a different semantic shift and became synonymous with 'cannon.'{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=68}} Fire arrows are the predecessors of [[fire lance]]s, the first firearm.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=31}}
* '''[[Firecracker]]''': The predecessor of the firecracker was a type of heated bamboo, used as early as 200 BC, that exploded when heated continuously. The Chinese name for firecrackers, ''baozhu'', literally means "exploding bamboo."&lt;ref name="mtmenc"&gt;{{cite book |author=David Curtis Wright |editor=Thomas F. Glick |editor2=Steven J.

* '''[[Fire lance]]''': The fire lance was a proto-gun developed in the 10th century with a tube of first bamboo and later on metal that shot a weak [[gunpowder]] blast of flame and shrapnel; its earliest representation comes from [[:image:FireLanceAndGrenade10thCenturyDunhuang.jpg|a painting found]] at [[Dunhuang]].&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 5, Part 7, 224â225, 232â233, 241â244.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Embree (1997), 185.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cowley (1996), 38.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest confirmed employment of the fire lance in warfare was by Song dynasty forces against the Jin in 1132 during the [[siege of De'an]] (modern [[Anlu]], [[Hubei Province]]),{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=222}}{{sf|Chase|2003|p=31}}{{sfn|Lorge|2008|p=33-34}} where they were used to great effect against wooden [[siege towers]] called "sky bridges": "As the sky bridges became stuck fast, more than ten feet from the walls and unable to get any closer, [the defenders] were ready. From below and above the defensive structures they emerged and attacked with fire lances, striking lances, and hooked sickles, each in turn. The people [i.e., the porters] at the base of the sky bridges were repulsed. Pulling their bamboo ropes, they [the porters] ended up drawing the sky bridge back in an anxious and urgent rush, going about fifty paces before stopping."{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=38}} The surviving porters then tried once again to wheel the sky bridges into place but Song soldiers emerged from the walls in force and made a direct attack on the sky bridge soldiers while defenders on the walls threw bricks and shot arrows in conjunction with trebuchets hurling bombs and rocks. The sky bridges were also set fire to with incendiary bundles of grass and firewood. Li Heng, the Jin commander, decided to lift the siege and Jin forces were driven back with severe casualties.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=38}}
* '''[[Fireworks]]''': Fireworks first appeared in China during the Song Dynasty (960â1279), in the early age of [[gunpowder]]. The common people in the Song era could purchase simple fireworks from market vendors; these were made of sticks of [[bamboo]] packed with gunpowder,&lt;ref&gt;Gernet (1962), 186.&lt;/ref&gt; although grander displays were known to be held.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly (2004), 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Rocket propulsion was soon applied to warfare, and by the time of the mid 14th century there were many types of rocket launchers available.&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 5, Part 7, 485â489.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Fishing reel]]''': In literary records, the earliest evidence of the fishing reel comes from a 4th-century AD&lt;ref&gt;Birrell (1993), 185.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hucker (1975), 206.&lt;/ref&gt; work entitled ''Lives of Famous Immortals''.&lt;ref&gt;Ronan (1994), 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known depiction of a fishing reel comes from a [[Southern Song]] (1127â1279) painting done in 1195 by Song dynasty painter [[Ma Yuan (painter)|Ma Yuan]] (c. 1160â1225) called "Angler on a Wintry Lake," showing a man sitting on a small [[sampan]] boat while casting out his [[fishing line]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 100"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 2, 100 &amp; PLATE CXLVII.&lt;/ref&gt; Another fishing reel was featured in a painting by the Yuan dynasty painter [[Wu Zhen (painter)|Wu Zhen]] (1280â1354).&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 100"/&gt; The book ''Tianzhu lingqian'' (Holy Lections from Indian Sources), printed between 1208 and 1224, features two different [[Woodcut|woodblock print illustrations]] of fishing reels being used.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 100"/&gt; An [[Armenia]]n parchment Gospel of the 13th century shows a reel (though not as clearly depicted as the Chinese ones).&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 100"/&gt; The ''[[Sancai Tuhui]]'', a [[Chinese encyclopedias|Chinese encyclopedia]] published in 1609, features the next known picture of a fishing reel and vividly shows the [[windlass]] pulley of the device.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 100"/&gt; These five pictures mentioned are the only ones which feature fishing reels before the year 1651 (when the first English illustration was made); after that year they became commonly depicted in world art.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 100"/&gt;
* '''[[Flamethrower|Flamethrower, double piston and gunpowder-activated]]''': Although the single piston flamethrower was first developed in the [[Byzantine Empire]] during the 7th century,&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 5, Part 7, 77â78.&lt;/ref&gt; the 10th-century Chinese flamethrower, or ''[[Pen Huo Qi]]'', boasted a continuous stream of flame by employing double [[piston]] [[syringe]]s (which had been known since the Han Dynasty) spouting [[Greek fire]] which had been imported from China's maritime trade contacts in the Middle East. It was first used in battle 932 during the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]] (907â960), and the earliest illustration is found in the early Song Dynasty military manuscript ''[[Wujing Zongyao]]'' of 1044, which also described the device in full.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 5 part 7 81 84"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 5, Part 7, 81â84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gernet (1996), 310.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the Greek model which employed a furnace, the ''Pen Huo Qi'' was ignited by an incendiary [[gunpowder]] fuse.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 5 part 7 81 84"/&gt;
* '''[[Flare]]''': The earliest recorded use of gunpowder for signalling purposes was the 'signal bomb' used by the Song Dynasty Chinese as the [[Mongol]]-led Yuan Dynasty besieged [[Yangzhou]] in 1276.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 5 part 7 169"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 5, Part 7, 169.&lt;/ref&gt; These soft-shelled bombs, timed to explode in mid-air, were used to send messages to a detachment of troops far in the distance. Another mention of the signal bomb appears in a text dating from 1293 requesting their collection from those still stored in [[Zhejiang]].&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 5 part 7 169"/&gt; A signal gun appears in Korea by 1600. The ''Wu I Thu Phu Thung Chih'' or ''Illustrated Military Encyclopedia'' written in 1791 depicts a signal gun in an illustration.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 5 part 7 331"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 5, Part 7, 331.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Free reed aerophone]]''': The musical [[pipe organ]] employing metal [[piston]] [[bellows]] had a long history in the Western world, dating back to the [[Hellenistic period]]. However, the Western pipe organ did not make use of [[reed (instrument)|the reed]], which the ancient Chinese [[mouth organ]] employed. The latter instrument, called a [[Sheng (instrument)|sheng]] and made traditionally of [[bamboo]] pipes, was first mentioned in the ''[[Shi Jing]]'' of the Zhou Dynasty (c. 1050â256 BC). The Chinese sheng is considered the ancestor of the [[harmonica]], [[Pump organ|harmonium]], [[concertina]], [[accordion]], and [[:Category:Free reed aerophones|all other reed organ instruments]]. A free [[reed organ]] was invented in the [[Muslim world|Arab world]] in the 13th century, while the German organ builder [[Heinrich Traxdorf]] (fl. 15th century) of [[Nuremberg]] built one around 1460 AD. It is thought that the classical Chinese sheng travelled west through Russia during the 19th century, as it was described then in [[Saint Petersburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 1, 211â212.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[fuse (explosive)|Fuses]]''': Documented evidence suggests that the earliest fuses were first used by the Chinese between the 10th and 12th centuries. After the Chinese had invented gunpowder, they began adapting its explosive properties for use in military technology. By 1044 they were using gunpowder in simple grenades, bombs, and flamethrowers, all of which required a fuse to be lit before being thrown at the enemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crocker|2002|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Football]]''':  Invented in the Han Dynasty, it is recognized by FIFA as the earliest form of association football for which there is evidence, being first mentioned as an exercise in a Chinese military work from 3rdâ2nd century BC

* '''[[Go (game)|Go (board game)]]''' (åæ£ {{zh|p=wÃ©iqÃ­}} in Chinese): Although ancient Chinese legend (perhaps contrived during the Han Dynasty) has it that the [[Yao (ruler)|mythological ruler Yao]] came down to earth [[Tian|from the Heavens]] around 2200 BC carrying with him a ''go'' board and stone player's pieces, it is known from existing literature that the ''go'' board game existed since at least the 10th century BC during the Zhou Dynasty (c. 1050â256 BC) and was even mentioned in writing by ancient Chinese philosophers [[Confucius]] (551â479 BC) and [[Mencius]] (371â289 BC), although the latter two had a slightly negative opinion of it.&lt;ref&gt;Lasker (1960), xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shotwell, Yang, and Chatterjee (2003), 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Song Dynasty]], famous artists were often commissioned to paint fans.  The Chinese dancing fan was developed in the 7th century. The Chinese form of the hand fan was a row of feathers mounted in the end of a handle. In the later centuries, Chinese poems and four-word idioms were used to decorate the fans by using Chinese calligraphy pens.

The spinning creates lift, and the toy flies when released.&lt;ref name="Gordon"/&gt; The Jin dynasty philosopher and politician [[Ge Hong]]'s book the ''[[Baopuzi]]'' (Master Who Embraces Simplicity), written around 317, describes the apocryphal use of a possible rotor in aircraft: "Some have made flying cars (feiche) with wood from the inner part of the jujube tree, using ox-leather (straps) fastened to returning blades so as to set the machine in motion." British scientist and sinologist Joseph Needham concludes that this is a description of a helicopter top, because "'returning (or revolving) blades' can hardly mean anything else, especially in close association with a belt or strap."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Needham (1965), ''Science and civilisation in China: Physics and physical technology, mechanical engineering'' Volume 4, Part 2, page 583-587.&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian polymath [[Leonardo da Vinci]] designed a machine known as an "aerial screw" with a rotor based on a [[water screw]]. The Russian polymath [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] developed a rotor based on the Chinese toy. The French naturalist Christian de Launoy constructed his rotor out of turkey feathers.&lt;ref name="Gordon"/&gt; The English aerospace engineer and inventor [[Sir George Cayley]], inspired by the Chinese top in his childhood, created multiple vertical flight machines with rotors made of tin sheets.&lt;ref name="Gordon"/&gt; French engineer and inventor [[Alphonse PÃ©naud]] would later develop coaxial rotor model helicopter toys in 1870, powered by rubber bands.

One suggests that it developed from the double canoe, another claims that the bamboo raft used by Taiwanese aboriginals was the source of the junk.&lt;ref&gt;Ronan (1994), 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Records by Western travelers in China during the Song Dynasty mention that junks could support 130 sailors. The size of junks grew during the Ming Dynasty. By the 14th century, junks could carry 2,000 tons. Archaeological evidence of the large size of the junk has been proven by a sunken junk discovered in 1973 near the coast of Southeastern China.&lt;ref name="Denny"&gt;{{cite book |author=Mark Denny |title=Float Your Boat!: The Evolution and Science of Sailing |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rtg6T9kMZkUC&amp;pg=PT27 |date=1 November 2009 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=978-0-8018-9568-5 |page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is made of [[brick]]s or other forms of fired [[clay]] and more recently of concrete in some locations. The ''kang'' is said to be derived from the concept of a heated bed floor called a ''huoqiang'' found in China in the [[Neolithic]] period, according to analysis of archeological excavations of building remains in Banpo Xi'an. However, archeological sites in [[Shenyang]], Liaoning, show humans using the heated bed floor as early as 7,200 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.healthyheating.com/History_of_Radiant_Heating_and_Cooling/History_of_Radiant_Heating_and_Cooling_Part_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zhuang&gt;{{citation |title=Chinese kang as a domestic heating system in rural northern ChinaâA review |first=Zhi |last=Zhuang |first2=Yuguo |last2=Li |first3=Bin |last3=Chen |last4=Jiye |last5=Guo |journal=Energy and Buildings |volume=41 |issue=1 |year=2009 |pages=111â119 |doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2008.07.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literary evidence from the Shui Jing Zhu also gives evidence of heated floors by the [[Northern Wei Dynasty]], though it was not explicitly named a dikang.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

* '''[[Land mine]]''': Textual evidence suggests that the first use of a land mine in history was by a Song Dynasty brigadier general known as Lou Qianxia, who used an 'enormous bomb' (''huo pao'') to kill [[History of the Song Dynasty#Mongol invasion and end of the Song Dynasty|Mongol soldiers]] invading [[Guangxi]] in 1277.&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 5, Part 7, 175â176, 192.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the first detailed description of the land mine was given in the ''[[Huolongjing]]'' text written by Ming Dynasty writer, military strategist and philosopher [[Jiao Yu]] (fl. 14th to early 15th century) and [[Liu Bowen]] (1311â1375) during the late Yuan Dynasty (1271â1368) and early Ming Dynasty (1368â1644).&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 5, Part 7, 24â25, 176, 192.&lt;/ref&gt; Jiao and Liu wrote that land mines were spherical, made of [[cast iron]], and their fuses ignited by a mechanism tripped by enemy movement; although Jiao and Liu did not describe this trip mechanism in full detail, a later text of 1606 revealed that enemy movement released a pin that allowed hidden underground weights to fall and spin a chord around an axle that rotated a spinning wheel acting as a [[flint]] to spark a train of fuses.&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 5, Part 7, 193 &amp; 199.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Land sailing]]''': The usage of the land sail in China dates back to at least the [[Northern and Southern dynasties]] period.&lt;ref name="temple 195"&gt;Temple, 195.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest text describing the Chinese use of mounting [[Mast (sailing)|mast]]s and [[sail]]s on large vehicles is the ''Book of the Golden Hall Master'' written by the Daoist scholar and [[crown prince]] Xiao Yi, who later became [[Emperor Yuan of Liang]] (r. 552&amp;ndash;554 AD).&lt;ref name="temple 195"&gt;Temple, 195.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Leeboard]]''': To avoid [[leeward]] drift caused by the force of wind while sailing, the leeboard was invented; it was a board lowered onto the side of the ship opposite to the direction of the wind, helping the ship to stay upright and afloat even if the hull was breached. British writers Paul Johnstone and Sean McGrail state that an odd-looking second paddle on [[Dong Son drum|a bronze drum]] of the [[Dong Son culture]] (centered in the [[Red River Delta]] of northern [[Vietnam]]) may depict a leeboard in use as early as 300 BC.&lt;ref name="johnstone mcgrail 2001 218"&gt;Johnstone &amp; McGrail (2001), 218.&lt;/ref&gt; Leeboards may have been invented in China as early as the 8th century during the Tang Dynasty and are featured shortly after in 9th century engraved artwork found at the [[Borobudur]] monument built during the [[Sailendra]] dynasty of [[Central Java]] ([[Indonesia]]).&lt;ref name="johnstone mcgrail 2001 218"/&gt; Leeboards were first used [[Western world|in the West]] by the [[Dutch (ethnic group)|Dutch]], during the 15th to 16th centuries (possibly used on early Dutch [[Cog (ship)|cogs]], or perhaps influenced by a Chinese origin).&lt;ref name="block 2003"&gt;Block (2003), 119â120.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mcgrail"&gt;McGrail (2004), 237.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Liubo]]''': The now defunct board game ''liubo'' for the most part remains an enigma for modern scholars still deciphering exactly how it was played; its association with both [[gambling]] and [[divination]] make it a unique game.&lt;ref name="Loewe"&gt;Loewe (1986), 141.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="loewe 1968 144 145"&gt;Loewe (1968), 144â145.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest two ''liubo'' game boards are found in the [[Zhongshan (state)|Zhongshan]] Tomb 3 at [[Shijiazhuang]], [[Hebei]].&lt;ref name="li 2004 8 9 13"&gt;Li (2004), 8â9 &amp; 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Handler (2001), 181.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar finds, dating from the mid 4th century BC, are also found in the [[Chu (state)|Chu]] Tomb 197 and 314 at [[Jiangling County|Jiangling]], [[Hubei]].&lt;ref name="li 2004 8 9 13"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Loewe (1999), 839.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Liubo'' game boards have been found in several [[Western Han]] (202 BC&amp;nbsp;â 9 AD) tombs; 1 wooden board at Jiangdu in [[Jiangsu]]; 1 wooden board in Tomb 8 at Fenghuangshan in Hubei; 1 lacquered set of ''liubo'' in Tomb 3 at [[Mawangdui|Mawangdui Han tombs site]] in [[Hunan]]; 1 lacquered board in Tomb 1 at Dafentou in [[Yunnan]]; 1 bronze board at Xilin in [[Guangxi]].&lt;ref&gt;Li (2005), 66â68.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Han Dynasty, an argument over the divination portents of the game as a result of a playing session led to a fight between [[Emperor Jing of Han|a Western Han crown prince]] and Liu Xian (åè³¢), where the latter was killed in the scuffle which (in part) prompted his father Liu Pi (åæ¿), the King of Wu, to rebel against central Han authority in the [[Rebellion of the Seven States]] (154 BC).&lt;ref name="Loewe"/&gt; The British sinologist and historian [[Michael Loewe]] asserts that the set pieces of ''liubo'' were symbolic of the forces of the Chinese Five Elements, ''[[wu xing]]''.&lt;ref name="loewe 1968 144 145"/&gt;
* '''[[Louche]]''': The louche (è¬è») was a mobile animal-drawn agricultural [[seed drill]] invented by the Chinese agronomist Zhao Guo, a Han official in charge of agricultural production during the reign of [[Han Wudi]] in the Han dynasty. According to the records of ''Political Commentator'' by the Eastern Han dynasty writer [[Cui Shi]], the Louche consisted of three feet and thus was called three-legged Lou. The three legs had three ditch diggers under it used for sowing. The Louche was animal powered and was pulled by an ox and the leg of the Louche directly dug a ditch in the flattened soil, sowed the seeds, covered the seeds, and pressed the land flat at the same time. The machine was known for its utility and efficiency for serving several agricultural uses at the same time, while saving time and effort.&lt;ref name="Lu 366"/&gt;

* '''[[Chinese magic mirror|Magic mirrors]]''': In about 800 AD, during the Tang Dynasty (618â907), a book entitled ''Record of Ancient Mirrors'' described the method of crafting solid [[bronze mirror]]s with decorations, written characters, or patterns on the reverse side that could cast these in a reflection on a nearby surface as light struck the front, polished side of the mirror; due to this seemingly [[Transparency (optics)|transparent effect]], they were called 'light-penetration mirrors' by the Chinese. Unfortunately, this Tang era book was lost over the centuries, but magic mirrors were described in the ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'' by the Song dynasty polymath [[Shen Kuo]] (1031â1095), who owned three of them as a family [[heirloom]]. Perplexed as to how solid metal could be transparent, Shen guessed that some sort of [[quench]]ing technique was used to produce tiny wrinkles on the face of the mirror too small to be observed by the eye. Although his explanation of different cooling rates was incorrect, he was right to suggest the surface contained minute variations which the naked eye could not detect; these mirrors also had no transparent quality at all, as discovered by British scientist and mathematician [[William Henry Bragg|William Bragg]] in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;"Magic Mirrors" (PDF).

* '''[[Mahjong]]''': The Dutch journalist and writer Jelte Rep writes that the [[gambling]] game of mahjong ([[Traditional Chinese]]: éº»å°; [[Pinyin]]: mÃ¡jiÃ ng), which employs [[Mahjong tiles|a set of over a hundred tiles]], was first invented in 1846 by Zhen Yumen, a [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644â1912) diplomatic official from [[Ningbo]].&lt;ref name="rep 2007 52"&gt;Rep (2007), 52.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Rep traces the origins of the game to a [[card game]] of the Tang Dynasty (618â907) which used thirty-two wood or ivory pieces in the shape of cards.&lt;ref name="rep 2007 51"&gt;Rep (2007), 51.&lt;/ref&gt; This evolved into the forty-card game of ''madiao'' (é¦¬å) during the Ming Dynasty (1368â1644), which had four [[Suit (cards)|suits of cards]] instead of the three found in modern mahjong.&lt;ref name="rep 2007 51"/&gt;
* '''[[Mandarin square]]''': Mandarin squares were large embroidered badges sewn onto the surcoat of an officials in Imperial China, Korea and Vietnam. It was embroidered with detailed, colourful animal or bird insignia indicating the rank of the official wearing it. Mandarin squares were first authorized for wear in 1391 by the [[Ming Dynasty]]. The use of squares depicting birds for civil officials and animals for military officials was an outgrowth of the use of similar squares, apparently for decorative use, in the [[Yuan Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Schuyler V. Cammann|Cammann, Schuyler]]: Birds and Animals as Ming and Ch'ing Badges of Rank", ''Arts of Asia'' (May to June 1991), page 89.&lt;/ref&gt; The original court dress regulations of the Ming Dynasty were published in 1368, but did not refer to badges as rank insignia.&lt;ref&gt;Cammann, Schuyler: "Development of the Mandarin Square", ''Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies'' Vol VIII, no 2 (1944), pages 75â6.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Mantou kiln]]''': The mantou kiln was the most common type of pottery [[kiln]] in north China, in historical periods when the [[dragon kiln]] dominated south China; both seem to have emerged in the [[Warring States period]] of approximately 475 to 221 BC.&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;Wood&lt;/ref&gt; It is named (in both English and Chinese) after the Chinese [[mantou]] bun or roll, whose shape it (very approximately) resembles; the ground plan resembles a [[horseshoe]].&lt;ref name=rw365&gt;Rawson, 365, diagram, 370; Wood&lt;/ref&gt; The kilns are roughly round, with a low dome covering the central firing area, and are generally only 2 to 3 metres across inside. However it is capable of reaching very high temperatures, up to about 1370&amp;nbsp;Â°C. There is a door or bricked-up opening at the front for loading and unloading, and one or two short chimneys at the rear.&lt;ref name=rw365/&gt;
* '''[[Match|Match, non-friction]]''': The earliest type of match for lighting fire was made in China by 577 AD, invented by [[Northern Qi]] (550â577) court ladies as they desperately looked for materials to light fires for cooking and heating as enemy troops of [[Northern Zhou]] (557â581) and the [[Chen Dynasty]] (557â589) besieged their city from outside. Early matches in China were designed to be lit by an existing flame and carried to light another fire. They were pinewood sticks impregnated with [[sulfur]] and needed only a slight touch from a flame to light. This was written in the ''Records of the Unworldly and Strange'' by Tao Gu in 950 ([[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]]).&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Vol 4, Part 1, pp 70-1.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Meat analogue]]''': The use of [[tofu]] as a meat analogue is recorded in a document written by Tao Gu (903â970). Tao describes how tofu was popularly known as "small mutton" (''xiao zaiyang''), which shows that the Chinese valued tofu as an imitation meat. Tofu was widely consumed during the [[Tang dynasty]] (618â907), and likely spread to Japan during the later Tang or early [[Song dynasty]].{{fact|date=November 2018}} Prior to the arrival of Buddhism, China was predominantly a meat consuming culture. The vegetarian dietary laws of Buddhism led to development of meat analogues as a replacement for the meat-based dishes that the Chinese were no longer able to consume as Buddhists.

* '''[[Field mill (carriage)|Mechanical theater]] (driven by carriage wheels)''': The inventors of the [[Field mill (carriage)|field mill]] mentioned above, Xie Fei and Wei Mengbian of the [[Later Zhao]] (319â351 AD), also invented an intricate mechanical theater mounted on a carriage, its figures operated by motive power (i.e. simply advancing the carriage forward).&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 159"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 2, 159.&lt;/ref&gt; From 335 to 345 AD, they worked at the court of the ethnic-[[Jie (ethnic group)|Jie]] emperor [[Shi Hu]] (334â349).&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 159"/&gt; The vehicle they crafted was a four-wheeled and 6&amp;nbsp;m (20&amp;nbsp;ft) long carriage that was about 3&amp;nbsp;m (10&amp;nbsp;ft) wide.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 159"/&gt; On it rested a large [[Chinese Buddhism|golden Buddha statue]] with a [[Daoism|Daoist]] statue continually rubbing his front with his mechanical hand.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 159"/&gt; The Buddha was also surrounded by ten wooden Daoists who rotated around him in a circuit, periodically bowing to him, saluting him, and throwing [[incense]] into a [[censer]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 159"/&gt; Above the Buddha were nine dragon-headed faucets which spouted water.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 159"/&gt; Like the field mill and the pounding cart of these two inventors, when the carriage halted, so did all of its moving components of mechanical statues and spouting faucets.&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 2, 160.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Automaton|Mechanical cup-bearers and wine-pourers on automatic-traveling boats]]''': The mechanical engineer Huang Gun served the court of [[Emperor Yang of Sui|Emperor Yang Di]] (r. 604â617) and wrote the book ''Shuishi Tujing'' on his inventions, which his colleague Du Bao enlarged and commented on.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 160"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 160.&lt;/ref&gt; He constructed seven small boats, called 'wine boats', that were as large as 3&amp;nbsp;m (10&amp;nbsp;ft) long and 1.8&amp;nbsp;m (6&amp;nbsp;ft) wide which supported a number of mechanical figures of wooden statues called 'hydraulic elegances', each about 0.6&amp;nbsp;m (2&amp;nbsp;ft) tall, some of them animals but most in human form consisting of singing girls, musicians playing actual instruments, dancers and tumblers, oarsmen busy rowing, cup-bearers, and wine-pourers all moving simultaneously as if alive.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 160"/&gt; These boats were set to travel at timed intervals along circuits made of winding stone channels and canals in palace courtyards and gardens (designed by Tang Haogui), where guests would gather for special occasions.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 160"/&gt; The cup-bearer stood at the bow of each ship and beside him the wine-pourer; when the ship made automatically timed periodic stops where guests were seated, the cup-bearer automatically stretched out his arm with a full cup of wine.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 160"/&gt; When the guest was done emptying his cup, he placed the cup back into the figure's hands; the latter then waited as the wine-pourer filled a second cup to be emptied.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 160"/&gt; When this guest had been served, the wine boat automatically moved onwards to the next stop.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 160"/&gt; The British sinologist, scientist, and historian [[Joseph Needham]] speculates that the 'wine boats' may have been [[Paddle steamer|paddle-wheel-driven]].&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 2, 161 &amp; 417.&lt;/ref&gt; Another paddle wheel ship was commanded by Wang Zhen'e and described in his biographies dated from the [[Liu Song Dynasty]] (420â479).&lt;ref&gt;Ronan (1994), 308.&lt;/ref&gt; side from the partial remains of the ''Shuishi Tujing'', an account of these 'wine boats' was also preserved by Huang Gun's contemporary [[Yan Shigu]] (581â645).&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 2, 160 (footnote c and d)&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Merit system]]''': The earliest example of a merit system dates back to the Qin and Han dynasties. In order to maintain power over a large, sprawling empire, it became necessary for the government to maintain a complex network of officials.&lt;ref name="BC" /&gt; Prospective officials could come from a rural background and government positions were not restricted to the nobility. Rank was determined by merit, through the [[civil service examination]]s, and education became the key for social mobility.&lt;ref name="BC"&gt;Burbank and Cooper (2010), 51.&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the Han Dynasty, the [[nine-rank system]] was established during the [[Three Kingdoms]] period. The concept of a merit system spread from China to British India during the 17th century, and then into continental Europe and the United States.&lt;ref name="APH"&gt;Kazin, Edwards, and Rothman (2010), 142.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Chinese architecture|Modular system of architecture, eight standard grades]]''': Although other texts preceded it, such as the 'National Building Law' of the Tang Dynasty (618â907) which was partially preserved in other texts, the ''[[Yingzao Fashi]]'' published in 1103 by the Song Dynasty (960â1279) scholar-official [[Architecture of the Song Dynasty#Literature|Li Jie]] (1065â1110) is the oldest known Chinese architectural treatise that has survived fully intact.&lt;ref name="guo 1998 1 3"&gt;Guo (1998), 1â3.&lt;/ref&gt; It contains descriptions and illustrations detailing the ''cai fen'' system (æä»½å¶) of eight standard dimensions for [[Modular design|module]] components of timber architecture and structural [[carpentry]].&lt;ref name="guo 1998 6 7"&gt;Guo (1998), 6â7.&lt;/ref&gt; The eight standard grades of module timber components in the ''Yingzao Fashi'', with grade &lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt; being the largest and grade &lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times"&gt;VIII&lt;/span&gt; the smallest, were used to determine the ultimate proportions and scale of a building as a whole, as all timber hall typesâ[[Chinese Palaces|palaces]], [[mansion]]s, [[House|ordinary houses]], and [[Chinese pavilion|pavilions]]âwere hierarchically categorized along the lines of which ''cai fen'' grade was employed.&lt;ref name="guo 1998 7 8"&gt;Guo (1998), 7â8.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, palace type buildings used only grades &lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt; through &lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times"&gt;V&lt;/span&gt;, while mansion type buildings never used components larger than grade &lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times"&gt;III&lt;/span&gt; and no less than grade &lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times"&gt;VI&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;ref name="guo 1998 7"&gt;Guo (1998), 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In this system of structural carpentry, the smallest grade of &lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times"&gt;VIII&lt;/span&gt; is represented by one ''cai''; one ''cai'' is equal to the modern equivalent of 15&amp;nbsp;cm (5.9&amp;nbsp;in), while one ''cai'' is also divided into fifteen ''fen'' (hence the title of this modular system).&lt;ref name="guo 1999 97"&gt;Guo (1999), 97.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Sail#Moveable sails|Moveable sail]]s''': By the time of the Zhou Dynasty ship technologies such as stern mounted rudders were developed, and by the Han Dynasty, a well kept naval fleet was an integral part of the military. The Chinese used the complex moving technology behind the [[kite]] allowed then to develop the worlds first moving sails (in comparison with the mounted sails used in the West) around 200 AD.

* '''[[Multiple rocket launcher]]''': The first [[Huo Che|multiple rocket launchers]] were made during the medieval Chinese [[Song dynasty]]. It was designed to launch multiple rocket arrows from a gunpowder box. These also appeared later, in an expanded version, in the Joseon Dynasty of Korea, where they were used with great effectiveness against the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592â98)|Japanese invasions of 1592â98]], most notably the [[Battle of Haengju]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple rocket launchers evolved from Chinese [[fire lance]]s when the Song military favored multiple rocket launchers that fired simultaneously up to 100 small fire-arrow rockets after the [[Mongol siege of Kaifeng]]. The typical powder section of such an arrow-rocket was 1/3 and 1/2&amp;nbsp;ft (10 to 15&amp;nbsp;cm) long. Bamboo arrow shafts varied from 1.5&amp;nbsp;ft (45&amp;nbsp;cm) to 2.5&amp;nbsp;ft (75&amp;nbsp;cm) long and the striking distance reached 300 to 400 paces. The Chinese also enhanced rocket tips with poison and made sure that the launchers were also mobile. Song Chinese rocket designers designed multiple rocket launchers that could be carried and operated by a single soldier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Blazing the Trail: The Early History of Spacecraft and Rocketry |last=Gruntman |first=Mike  |publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics |year=2005 |isbn=978-1563477058 |pages=5â6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Multistage rocket]]''': Although there is still some ambiguity as to whether the earliest [[rocket]]s of the 13th century were first developed in Europe (i.e. 'ignis volantis in aere' in the work of Marcus Graecus around 1232, although Needham and Davis assert it was most likely a [[fire lance]]), the Middle East (i.e. 'sahm al-KhitÄi' or 'arrows of China' as referred to by Hasan al-RhammÄh in 1280) or China (i.e. 'di lao shu' or 'ground rat' mentioned in 1264 or the 'chong' [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] used by the armies of the Song Dynasty and invading [[Mongols]] during the 1270s), during the Yuan Dynasty (1271â1368) the term '[[fire arrow]]' once implied to mean incendiary arrows during the Tang Dynasty was then used to describe the true rocket, producing a headache, as Needham says, for historians;&lt;ref name="gernet 1996 311" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crosby (2002), 100â103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 5, Part 7, 472â474.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Huolongjing]]'' written by military officer [[Jiao Yu]] (fl. 14th to early 15th century) and the Song dynasty Chinese philosopher and politician [[Liu Bowen]] (1311â1375) during the early Ming Dynasty (1368â1644) described several types of rockets,&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 473â505.&lt;/ref&gt; one of them being a multistage rocket known as the 'huo long chu shui' or 'fire dragon issuing from the water' which, despite its name, was not launched from beneath the water from a primitive submarine but rather at near water-level maintaining a flat trajectory; defined as a two-stage rocket, it employed [[booster rocket]]s that, when about to burn out of use, ignited a swarm of smaller rocket arrows fired from the front end of the missile shaped as a dragon's mouth.&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 5, Part 7, 505â510.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Seed drill|Multiple-tube seed drill]]''': The wooden seed drill existed in China by the 3rd century BC, while the multiple-tube iron seed drill was first invented in China by the 2nd century BC, during the Han Dynasty (202 BC&amp;nbsp;â 220 AD).&lt;ref name="greenberger 2006 12"&gt;Greenberger (2006), 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cotterell (2004), 46.&lt;/ref&gt; The seed drill allowed for greater speed and regulation of [[Crop rotation|distributing seeds in lined rows of crops]] instead of casting them out onto the farm field.&lt;ref name="greenberger 2006 12"/&gt;

* '''[[Natural gas|Natural gas as a fuel]]''': On tomb brick reliefs of [[Sichuan]] province dating to the Han Dynasty (202 BC - 220 AD), scenes of [[borehole]] drilling for [[mining]] projects are shown.&lt;ref name="loewe 1968 191 194"/&gt; They show towering [[derrick]]s lifting liquid [[brine]] through [[Pipeline transport|bamboo pipes]] to the surface so that the brine could be [[Distillation|distilled]] in evaporation pans over the heat of furnaces and produce [[salt]].&lt;ref name="loewe 1968 191 194"&gt;Loewe (1968), 191â194.&lt;/ref&gt; The furnaces were heated by natural gas brought by airtight jointed bamboo pipes for miles to towns and villages, yet gas brought up from {{convert|610|m|ft|abbr=on}} below the surface could cause an explosion if it was not properly mixed with oxygen first, so the Han dynasty Chinese built underground [[carburetor]] chambers and siphoned some of the gas off with [[Exhaust system|exhaust pipes]].&lt;ref name="loewe 1968 191 194"/&gt; 
* '''[[Naval mine]]''': The ''[[Huolongjing]]'' military manuscript written by Ming dynasty military writer, strategist, and philosopher [[Jiao Yu]] (fl. 14th to early 15th century) and Chinese military strategist, philosopher, statesman and poet [[Liu Bowen]] (1311â1375) also describes naval mines used at sea or on rivers and lakes; made of [[wrought iron]] and enclosed in an ox bladder, it was a timed device in that a burning [[joss sticks]] floating above the mine determined when the fuse was to be ignited; the text explicitly mentions that without air and doused in water the fuse would not burn, so the fuse was protected by a long [[waterproof]] tube made out of goat's intestine; a later model shown in Ming Chinese scientist and encyclopedist [[Song Yingxing]]'s (1587â1666) encyclopedia of 1637 shows the ox bladder replaced with a [[Lacquerware|lacquered leather]] bag while the mine is ignited by a rip cord pulled from the shore to rotate a flint-and-steel firing mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 5, Part 7, 203â205.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Night market]]''': The concept of the night market traces its roots back to the medieval Chinese [[Tang dynasty]]. The Tang government put strict sanctions on night markets and their operations in A.D. 836. Towards the end of the Tang Dynasty, economic expansion led to less state regulation and restrictions being lifted on night markets. During the [[Song Dynasty]] (960-1279), Night markets played a central role in medieval Chinese nightlife. These markets were found in corners of large cities. Some stayed open for twenty- four hours. Song period night markets are also known to have included restaurants and brothels due to being frequently located near business and red light districts.{{sfnp|Yu|2004|p=134}}

By the 5th century, archaeological evidence indicates that pig iron was melted to produce cast iron.&lt;ref name="wagner 7 36 37 64 68"/&gt; In [[Europe]], the process was not invented until the late [[medieval ages]].&lt;ref&gt;Several papers in ''The importance of ironmaking: technical innovation and social change: papers presented at the Norberg Conference, May 1995'' ed.

* '''[[Pinhole camera]]''': The [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] philosopher [[Aristotle]] (384â322 BC) observed that the spaces between the leaves of trees acted as tiny pinholes which cast the image of a partial [[solar eclipse]] onto the ground.&lt;ref name="clee 2005 6"&gt;Clee (2005), 6.&lt;/ref&gt; He also used a metal plate with a small pinhole to project an image of a solar eclipse onto the ground.&lt;ref name="clee 2005 6"/&gt; The ancient [[Chinese philosophy|Chinese]] philosopher [[Mozi]] (c. 470 BC&amp;nbsp;â c. 391 BC)âfounder of [[Mohism]] during the establishment of the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]]âlived just before the time of Aristotle and it was in his ''Mojing'' (perhaps compiled by his disciples) that a pinhole camera was described.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 1 82"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 1, 82.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Mojing'' stated that the "collecting place" (pinhole) was an empty hole "like the sun and moon depicted on the imperial flags," where an image could be inverted at an intersecting point which "affects the size of the image."&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 1 82"/&gt; The ''Mojing'' seems to be in line with the [[Epicureanism|Epicurean theory]] of light traveling into the eye (and not vice versa like in [[Pythagoreanism]]),&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 1 85"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 1, 85.&lt;/ref&gt; since the ''Mojing'' states that the reflected light shining forth from an "illuminated person" becomes inverted when passing through the pinhole, i.e. "The bottom part of the man becomes the top part (of the image) and the top part of the man becomes the bottom part (of the image)."&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 1 82"/&gt; In his ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (1021), [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (965â1039) wrote of his experimentation with [[camera obscura]], which was followed by Song dynasty polymath [[Shen Kuo]] (1031â1095), the latter who alluded that the Tang Dynasty (618â907) writer [[Duan Chengshi]] (died 863)âin his ''[[Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang]]''âdescribed inverted images of [[Chinese pagoda]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 1, 97â98.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Pipeline transport]]''': The ancient Chinese made use of channels and pipe systems for public works. The Han Dynasty court [[eunuch (court official)|eunuch]] [[Zhang Rang]] (d. 189&amp;nbsp;AD) ordered the engineer Bi Lan to construct a series of square-pallet [[chain pump]]s outside the capital city of [[Luoyang]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 33"&gt;Needham, Joseph (1986). Science and Civilization in China: Volume 4, Part 2.

* '''[[Playing card]]s''': The first reference to the card game in world history dates no later than the 9th century, when the ''Collection of Miscellanea at Duyang'', written by Su E (fl. 880), described the Wei clan (family of Princess Tongchang's husband) of the Tang Dynasty (618â907 AD) enjoying the "leaf game" in 868.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 1 131 132"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 5, Part 1, 131â132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zhou 1997 34"&gt;Zhou (1997), 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lo (2000), 390.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Yezi Gexi'' was a book on the card came which was allegedly written by a Tang woman and commented on by Chinese scholars in subsequent dynasties.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 1 132"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 5, Part 1, 132.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Notes After Retirement'', the Song Dynasty (960â1279) scholar [[Ouyang Xiu]] (1007â1072) asserted that playing card games existed since the mid Tang Dynasty and associated this invention with the simultaneous evolution of the common Chinese writing medium from paper rolls to sheets of paper that could be printed.&lt;ref name="zhou 1997 34"/&gt;&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 1 132"/&gt; During the Ming Dynasty (1368â1644), characters from popular [[novel]]s such as the ''[[Water Margin]]'' were widely featured on the faces of playing cards.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 1 132"/&gt; By the 11th century playing cards could be found throughout the Asian continent.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 1 309"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 5, Part 1, 309.&lt;/ref&gt; Playing cards were some of the first printed materials in Europe, appearing by the 14th century (i.e. in Spain and Germany in 1377, in Italy and Belgium in 1379, and in France in 1381) and produced by European [[woodblock printing]] before the innovation of the early modern [[printing press]] by German inventor, printer, publisher and blacksmith [[Johannes Gutenberg]] (c. 1400â1468).&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 1 309"/&gt;
* '''[[Pontoon bridge]]''': The [[Zhou Dynasty]] Chinese text of the ''[[Shi Jing]]'' (''Book of Odes'') records that [[King Wen of Zhou]] was the first to create a pontoon bridge in the 11th century BC. However, the British scientist, sinologist and historian [[Joseph Needham]] has pointed out that in all likely scenarios, the temporary pontoon bridge was invented during the 9th or 8th century BC in China, as this part was perhaps a later addition to the book (considering how the book had been edited up until the [[Han Dynasty]], 202 BC&amp;ndash;220 AD). Although earlier temporary pontoon bridges had been made in China, the first secure and permanent ones (and linked with iron chains) in China came first during the [[Qin Dynasty]] (221 BC&amp;ndash;207 BC). The later [[Song Dynasty]] (960&amp;ndash;1279 AD) Chinese statesman Cao Cheng once wrote a description of the early pontoon bridges in China.&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 160.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Eastern Han Dynasty (25&amp;ndash;220 AD), the Chinese created a very large pontoon bridge that spanned across the width of the [[Yellow River]]. There was also the [[Naval history of China#Early literature|rebellion of Gongsun Shu]] in 33 AD, where a large pontoon bridge with fortified posts was constructed across the [[Yangtze]] River, eventually broken through with [[ramming]] ships by official Han troops under Commander Cen Peng. During the late Eastern Han into the [[Three Kingdoms]] period, during the [[Battle of Chibi]] in 208 AD, the Prime Minister [[Cao Cao]] once linked the majority of his fleet together with iron chains, which proved to be a fatal mistake once he was thwarted with a fire attack by [[Sun Quan]]'s fleet. The armies of [[Emperor Taizu of Song]] had a large pontoon bridge built across the Yangtze River in 974 in order to secure supply lines during the [[Song Dynasty]]'s conquest of the [[Southern Tang]].&lt;ref&gt;Graff, 87.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Porcelain]]''': [[Chinese ceramics|Although glazed ceramics existed beforehand]], the author and historian Samuel Adrian M Adshead writes that the earliest type of vitrified, translucent ceramics that could be classified as true porcelain was not made until the Tang Dynasty (618â907).&lt;ref&gt;Adshead (2004), 80.&lt;/ref&gt; The archaeologist Nigel Wood of the University of Oxford states that true porcelain was manufactured in northern China from roughly the beginning of the Tang Dynasty in the 7th century, while true porcelain was not manufactured in southern China until about 300 years later, during the early 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;Wood (1999), 49.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Pot stickers]]''': Pot stickers are Chinese dumplings that are pan-fried on the bottom and steamed on top.

* '''[[Menu|Restaurant menu]]''': During the early Song Dynasty (960â1279), expanding trade and commerce brought money and people to the Song Chinese capital. The world's first restaurants sprang up and food like dumplings and noodles became available to the masses for a small price. Urban shopkeepers of the [[Four occupations|merchant middle class]] often had little time to eat at home, so they ventured out to eat at a variety of establishments such as temples, taverns, tea houses, food stalls, and [[restaurant]]s which provided business for nearby brothels, singing-girl houses, and [[Culture of the Song Dynasty#Performing arts|drama theaters]]; this along with [[Society of the Song Dynasty#Ethnic, foreign and religious minorities|traveling foreigners]] and Chinese who migrated to urban centers from regions with different cooking styles encouraged a demand for a variety of flavors served at urban restaurants, giving rise to the menu.&lt;ref&gt;West (1997), 70â76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gernet (1962), 133â134, 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tom, Chung Chee Kit, S.A.M. Adshead, Paul Johnstone and Sean McGrail state that a steering oar is not a rudder; the steering oar has the capacity to interfere with handling of the sails (limiting any potential for long ocean-going voyages) while it was fit more for small vessels on narrow, rapid-water transport; the rudder did not disturb the handling of the sails, took less energy to operate by its [[helmsman]], was better fit for larger vessels on ocean-going travel, and first appeared in China.&lt;ref name="tom 1989 103"/&gt;&lt;ref name="adshead 2000 156"&gt;Adshead (2000), 156.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 3, 627â628.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chung (2005), 152.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnstone &amp; McGrail (1988), 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Leo Block writes of the use of the steering oar in the ancient [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean world]] (specifically in regards to the [[Phoenicia]]ns, 1550â300 BC): "A single sail tends to turn a vessel in an upwind or downwind direction, and rudder action is required to steer a straight course. A steering oar was used at this time because the rudder had not yet been invented. With a single sail, a frequent movement of the steering oar was required to steer a straight course; this slowed down the vessel because a steering oar (or rudder) course correction acts like a break."&lt;ref&gt;Block (2003), 8â9.&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest depicted rudders at the back of a ship, without the use of [[oar]]s or a steering oar, comes from several ceramic models of Chinese ships made during both the Western and Eastern eras of the Han Dynasty (202 BC&amp;nbsp;â 220 AD).&lt;ref name="tom 1989 103"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 3, 649â650.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fairbank (2006), 192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deng 1997 42"&gt;Deng (1997), 42.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the scholars Zhang Zunyan and Vassilios Christides, there is literary evidence to suggest that the axial stern rudder existed in China since the 1st century BC,&lt;ref&gt;Christides (1996), 66â67.&lt;/ref&gt; while Gang Deng asserts the first reference was made in the ''[[Huainanzi]]'' of the 2nd century BC,&lt;ref name="deng 1997 42"/&gt; and K.S.

The Tang Dynasty (618â907) physician Zhen Quan (d. 643 AD), in his ''Old and New Tried and Tested Prescriptions'', stated that the thyroid glands taken from [[Gelding|gelded]] [[Domestic sheep|rams]] were used to treat patients with goiter; the thyroid hormones could be swallowed in pill form (the body of the pill made from crushed [[jujube]] pulp) or as a solid thyroid gland with the fat taken off.&lt;ref name="slater 2011 web"/&gt; The ''Pharmacopoeia of the Heavenly Husbandman'' asserted that iodine-rich [[sargassum]] was used to treat goiter by the 1st century BC ([[Ge Hong]], 284â364, also suggested using a [[tincture]] derived from sargassum seaweed in about 340 AD),&lt;ref name="medvei 1993 48"&gt;Medvei (1993), 48.&lt;/ref&gt; a treatment later recorded in the Western World by Italian practrica [[Roger II of Sicily|Roger of Palermo]] in his ''Practica Chirurgiae'' of 1180 AD.
* '''[[Tianchi Basin]]s''': As precipitation was for important agriculture and food production, the Song Chinese mathematician and inventor [[Qin Jiushao]] developed a precipitation gauge that was widely used in 1247 during the [[Southern Song dynasty]] to gather meteorological data. Qin Jiushao later records application of rainfall measurements in the mathematical treatise ''[[Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections]]''. The book also discusses problems using large snow gauges made from bamboo situated in mountain passes and uplands which are speculated to be first referenced to snow measurement.&lt;ref name="Strangeways 2011 140"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Strangeways 2011 140"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Selin 2008 736"/&gt; Tianchi Basins were installed at provincial and district capitals and bamboo snow gauges were situated in mountain passes. The rain gauges were conical or barrel-shaped with one being installed at each provincial and district capital in China. In the treatise, Qin Jiushao also discusses how point measurements were converted to real averages. These averages were important as they postulated indicators of natural disasters such as flooding, since river flooding has always been a problem in China.&lt;ref name="Strangeways 2011 140"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Strangeways 2011 140"/&gt;
* '''[[Tofu]]''': Although both popular tradition and Song Dynasty philosophers like [[Zhu Xi]] (1130â1200 AD) credit the invention of [[tofu]]âalong with [[soymilk]]â to [[Liu An]] (179â122 BC), a [[Kings of the Han Dynasty|Han-Dynasty King]] of [[Huainan]], no mention of tofu is found in the extant ''[[Huainanzi]]'' (compiled under Liu An).&lt;ref name="shurtleff aoyagi 2001 92"&gt;Shurtleff &amp; Aoyagi (2001), 92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="liu 1999 166"&gt;Liu (1999), 166.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yang 2004 217 218"&gt;Yang (2004), 217â218.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known mention of tofu was made in ''Records of the Extraordinary'' (''Qingyi lu'' æ¸ç°é), which reported that tofu was sold at [[Qingyang County|Qingyang]] ([[Anhui]]).&lt;ref&gt;Shinoda (1963), 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest explanation of how to make tofu is found in the ''[[Bencao Gangmu]]'', written by the Ming dynasty polymath [[Li Shizhen]] (1518â1593).&lt;ref name="yang 2004 217 218"/&gt; According to Liu Keshun (1999), Liu An's process for making tofu was essentially the same as today.&lt;ref&gt;Liu (1999), 166â167.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Toilet paper]]''': Toilet paper was first mentioned by the Sui Chinese politician and artist [[Yan Zhitui]] (531â591) in the year 589 during the [[Sui Dynasty]], with full evidence of continual use in subsequent dynasties.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 1 123"&gt;Needham, Volume 5, Part 1, 123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hunter (1978), 207.&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid 14th century during the Yuan Dynasty (1271â1368), it was written that ten million packages of 1,000 to 10,000 sheets of toilet paper were manufactured annually in [[Zhejiang]] province alone.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 1 123"/&gt;
* '''[[Louchuan|Tower ships]]''': Historical records relating to invention of Chinese tower ships are found in sources such as the ''[[Wujing Zongyao]]'', written during the [[Song Dynasty]], and the ''Taibai Yinjing'' from the [[Tang Dynasty]]. Chinese tower ships were naval warships  meant to be a central vessel in the fleet, the louchuan was equipped for boarding and attacking enemy vessels, as well as with siege weapons including [[trebuchet|traction trebuchet]]s for ranged combat against enemy ships.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 685"&gt;Needham, Joseph (translated by), ''Taibai Yinjing'', Volume 4, Part 2, pg. 685.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Trebuchet|Traction trebuchet]]''': The earliest type of trebuchet catapult was the traction trebuchet, developed first in China by the 5th or 4th century BC, the beginning of the [[Warring States period]] (403â221 BC); to operate the trebuchet, a team of men pulled on ropes attached to the butt of the shorter segment of a long wooden beam separated by a rotating axle fixed to a base framework, allowing the longer segment of the beam to lunge forward and use its sling to hurl a missile; by the 9th century a hybrid of the traction and [[Trebuchet#History|counterweight trebuchet]], employing manpower and a pivoting weight, was used in the Middle East, [[Mediterranean Basin]], and [[Northern Europe]]; by the 12th century, the full-fledged counterweight trebuchet was developed under the [[Ayyubid dynasty]] of Islamic Syria and Egypt (described by [[Mardi bin Ali al-Tarsusi]]) and used in the [[Third Crusade]]; by the 13th century, the counterweight trebuchet found its way into Song Dynasty (960â1279) China via the [[Mongol invasion of China|Mongol invaders]] under [[Kublai Khan]] (r. 1260â1294) who used it in the [[Battle of Xiangyang|Siege of Xiangyang]] (1267â1273).&lt;ref&gt;Chevedden (1998), 179â222.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull (2001), 9, 45â46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chevedden (1999), 36.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Trip hammer]]''': The ancient Chinese used [[pestle and mortar]] to pound and decorticate grain, which was superseded by the treadle-operated tilt hammer (employing a simple [[lever]] and [[wikt:fulcrum|fulcrum]]) perhaps during the Zhou Dynasty (1122â256 BC) but first described in a Han Dynasty (202 BC&amp;nbsp;â 220 AD) dictionary of 40 BC and soon after by the Han dynasty philosopher and writer [[Yang Xiong (author)|Yang Xiong]] (53 BC&amp;nbsp;â 18 AD) in his ''[[Fangyan]]'' dictionary written in 15 BC; the next stage in this evolution of grain-pounding devices was to apply [[Hydraulics|hydraulic power]], which the Han dynasty philosopher and writer [[Huan Tan]] (43 BC&amp;nbsp;â 28 AD) mentioned in his ''Xinlun'' of 20 AD, although he also described trip hammers powered by the labor of horses, oxen, donkeys, and mules.&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 183â184, 390â392.&lt;/ref&gt; After Huan Tan's book was written, numerous references to trip hammers powered by [[waterwheel]]s were made in subsequent Chinese dynasties and in Medieval Europe by the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 379, 392â395.&lt;/ref&gt; However, trip hammers were also attested by both literary ([[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''[[Natural History]]'' 18.97) and archaeological evidence in fairly widespread use in the [[Roman Empire]] by the 1st century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson (2002), 1â32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burnham (1997) 333â335.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Bianzhong|Tuned bells]]''': The earliest complete set of tuned bells, sixteen in all, were found in Tomb 8 of [[Jin (Chinese state)|Marquis Su of Jin]] at Qucun, southern [[Shanxi]].&lt;ref&gt;Wang (2007), 8 &amp; 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The tomb has been dated by [[Accelerator mass spectrometry|AMS]] radiocarbon techniques to 815â786 BC, during the period of the Zhou Dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Guo et al. (1996), 1112â1114.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the [[Bianzhong of Marquis Yi of Zeng|sixty-four bronze bells found]] in the [[tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng]] interred by 433 BC, forty-seven of them produce two notes with [[Interval (music)|minor third intervals]] while sixteen produce two notes with [[Interval (music)|major third intervals]].

The Song dynasty Chinese ran with the idea of junks featured watertight compartments. The watertight compartments were there to ensure that if one part of the ship was leaking, the ship itself would not sink. Song Chinese naval engineers came up with this idea by cutting up bamboo plants. In a bamboo plant, the stem is split into sections and at the end of a section there is a plug-like device that lets in water, but does not let it out. By using this as a model, they were able to make a large scale version that would protect the ship. In addition, the compartments were used as storage tanks in which fresh drinking water could be stored for sailors on board. Compartments were also used to help control the masts and sails so they could all be used at once.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= Science and Civilization in China: Volume 4, Physics and Physical Technology |last=Needham |first=Joseph |publisher=Caves Books Ltd. |year=1986 |volume=4 |publication-place=Taipei |page=362}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=International Encyclopedia of Geography |last=Richardson |first= Douglas  |last2=Castree |first2=Noel |last3=Goodchild |first3=Michael F.  |last4=Kobayashi |first4=Audrey  |last5=Liu |first5=Weidong  |last6=Marston |first6=Richard A.  |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year= 2017 |isbn=978-0470659632 |page=7161}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wide application of Chinese watertight compartments soon spread across East Asia and later to the Europeans through contacts with  Indian and Arab merchants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=International Encyclopedia of Geography, 15 Volume Set: People, the Earth, Environment and Technology |last=Richardson  |first=Douglas |last2=Goodchild  |first2=Michael F.  |last3=Kobayashi |first3=Audrey  |last4=Liu  |first4=Weidong  |last5=Marston |first5=Richard |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2017 |isbn=978-0470659632 |publication-date=March 20, 2017 |page=7161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Zoetrope]]''': British sinologist, scientist, and historian [[Joseph Needham]] described several ancient Chinese devices which he classified as "a variety of zoetrope",&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 1 122123"&gt;Needham (1962), Volume 4, Part 1, 122â123.&lt;/ref&gt; but his use of that term appears to have been very broad and unconventional. There is some evidence that a device capable of displaying moving images existed amongst the items of the treasury of the deceased [[Qin Shi Huang]] (r. 221â210 BC) of the [[Qin Dynasty]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 1 123"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 1, 123.&lt;/ref&gt; A magician named Shao Ong who staged a [[seance]] for [[Emperor Wu of Han]] (r. 141â87 BC) may have used such a device in his performance of 121 BC.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 1 122123" /&gt; Another device that Needham included in the same category comes, according to his dating, from the late Han Dynasty, when the engineer and artisan [[Ding Huan]] (ä¸ç·©) made a 'nine-storied hill-censer' around 180 AD.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 1 123"/&gt; This featured figures of birds and other animals which moved when the lamp was lit; the convection of rising hot air currents caused the vanes at the top canopy of the lamp to spin, while the painted figures on paper attached to the side of the cylinder gave the impression that they were in movement.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 1 123"/&gt;

[[File:12-05-08 AS1.JPG|thumb|The 150 MW [[Andasol solar power station]] is a commercial [[parabolic trough]] [[solar thermal]] power plant, located in [[Renewable energy in Spain|Spain]]. The Andasol plant uses tanks of [[Molten salt heat storage|molten salt to store captured solar energy]] so that it can continue generating electricity when the sun isn't shining.&lt;ref name="Cartlidge" /&gt;]]

This is a '''list of energy storage projects''' worldwide, other than pumped hydro storage. 
Many individual [[energy storage]] projects augment [[electrical grid]]s by capturing excess electrical energy during periods of low demand and storing it in other forms until needed on an [[electrical grid]]. The energy is later converted back to its electrical form and returned to the grid as needed.
Most of the world's grid energy storage by capacity is in the form of [[pumped-storage hydroelectricity]], which is covered in [[List of pumped-storage hydroelectric power stations]]. 
This article list projects using all other forms of energy storage.

Another energy storage method is the consumption of surplus or low-cost energy (typically during night time) for conversion into resources such as hot water, cool water or ice, which is then used for heating or cooling at other times when electricity is in higher demand and at greater cost per kilowatt hour (kWh). Such [[thermal energy storage]] is often employed at end-user sites such as large buildings, and also as part of [[district heating]], thus 'shifting' energy consumption to other times for better balancing of supply and demand.

For a list of systems and forms of energy storage see [[Energy storage#Storage methods|energy storage]] and [[grid energy storage]].

After full commissioning, the VFB energy storage system will be able to peak-shave approximately 8% of Liaoning Province's expected peaking capacity in 2020.In addition, the large-scale battery will form an additional load center, which will enhance grid stabilization including securing the power supply and providing black-start capabilities in the event of emergency. This project will be deployed in two phases, each with 100MW/400MWh. The first phase will be finished around the end of 2017 and the second will be finished around the end of 2018. This project is approved by China National Energy Administration, and the owner is a JV with the major shareholder being a local utility company, and the minor being RONGKE POWER. || China || [[Liaoning]], [[Dalian]] || &lt;ref name="DOE"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uetechnologies.com/news/72-unienergy-technologies-strategic-partner-to-deliver-world-s-largest-battery&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://spectrum.ieee.org/green-tech/fuel-cells/its-big-and-longlived-and-it-wont-catch-fire-the-vanadium-redoxflow-battery&lt;/ref&gt;

The installation completed in 2018, provides 200 ton-hours of thermal energy storage used to cool the building during the daily peak demand period. The PCM tanks, manufactured in North Carolina, consist of multiple tubular polypropylene heat exchangers fully submerged in the PCM. A unique feature of this design is based on a PCM that remains solid regardless of charge state. This characteristic eliminates all environmental concerns of accidental spillage during transport or when in operation. Â Â  
The practical demonstration occurred over a 24-month test period, covering all seasonal conditions, during this period the demonstration validated PhaseStor's ability to store thermal energy at different preset temperatures, utilizing a formula engineered specifically to optimize existing site conditions. The system effectiveness was validated by modulating the energy output (Btu/kW) at ambient temperature, therefore proving the energy and cost saving potential, while providing a healthy, productive, and comfortable environment for the building occupants.

The goal is to deliver a cost-effective prototype flywheel system that can be grid connected and electrically charged and discharged. The system will have built-in sensing components that can determine frequency and voltage characteristics of the grid and can override the grid signal to manage the amount of electricity discharged. The flywheel stores energy in a spinning rotor that is connected to an electric motor that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. To recover the energy the motor is electrically reversed and used as a generator to slow down the flywheel converting the mechanical energy back into electrical energy. Amber Kinetics will improve the traditional flywheel system by engineering breakthroughs in three areas, resulting in higher efficiency and radically reduced cost: [[magnetic bearing]]s, low-cost rotor, and high-efficiency motor generator.

[[Nuclear weapons testing]] is defined in treaty language by specifying a space and time requirement.

{{quote|In conformity with treaties between the United States and the Soviet Union, a salvo is defined, for multiple explosions for peaceful purposes, as two or more separate explosions where a period of time between successive individual explosions does not exceed 5 seconds and where the burial points of all explosive devices can be connected by segments of straight lines, each of them connecting two burial points, and the total length does not exceed 40 kilometers. For nuclear weapon tests, a salvo is defined as two or more underground nuclear explosions conducted at a test site within an area delineated by a circle having a diameter of two kilometers and conducted within a total period of time of 0.1 second.&lt;ref name=Yang&gt;{{citation|last1=Yang|first1=Xiaoping|first2=Robert|last2=North|first3=Carl|last3=Romney|first4=Paul G.|last4=Richards|date=August 2000|title=Worldwide Nuclear Explosions|url=http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~richards/my_papers/WW_nuclear_tests_IASPEI_HB.pdf|accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This definition is inclusive of "zero yield" [[Nuclear weapons design#Warhead design safety|safety tests]] of warheads, whether the test is successful (there is no nuclear yield) or the test is unsuccessful (there is a nuclear yield).
It does not include [[Nuclear weapons testing#Alternatives to full-scale testing|hydronuclear, cold or subcritical tests]] because no nuclear explosions are possible, even in failure. In these sorts of tests there may be small amounts of chain reaction occurring, but they stop before materially adding to the chemical explosion that causes them. The line here is finely drawn, but, among other things, subcritical testing is not prohibited by the [[Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]], while safety tests are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Martin Kalinowski|title=SubCritical Tests|url=http://www.math.yorku.ca/sfp/subcritical.html|accessdate=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Subcritical Experiments|author=Jeffrey Lewis|url=http://lewis.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/6011/subcritical-experiments|accessdate=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Totals by country==

The table in this section summarizes all worldwide nuclear testing (including the two bombs dropped in combat which were not tests). The country names are links to summary articles for each country, which may in turn be used to drill down to test series articles which contain details on every known nuclear explosion and test. The notes attached to various table cells detail how the numbers therein are arrived at. As of 1993, worldwide, 520 atmospheric nuclear explosions (including 8 underwater) have been conducted with a total yield of 545 [[TNT equivalent|megaton]] (Mt): 217&amp;nbsp;Mt from [[Nuclear fission|fission]] and 328&amp;nbsp;Mt from [[Nuclear fusion|fusion]], while the estimated number of underground nuclear tests conducted in the period from 1957 to 1992 is 1,352 explosions with a total yield of 90&amp;nbsp;Mt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-03610-5_17|title=Atmospheric Nuclear Tests|first=O.

==Known tests==

In the following subsections, a selection of significant tests (by no means exhaustive) are listed, representative of the testing effort in each nuclear country.

=== United States of America ===

{{main|List of United States' nuclear weapons tests}}

The standard "official" list of tests for American devices is arguably the [[United States Department of Energy]] DoE-209 document.&lt;ref name=doe209 /&gt; The United States conducted around 1,054 nuclear tests (by official count) between 1945 and 1992, including 216 atmospheric, underwater, and space tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/nuclear/atest00.html |title=Chronological Listing of Above Ground Nuclear Detonations |publisher=Wm. Robert Johnston |date= |accessdate=2001-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some significant tests conducted by the United States include:
[[File:Crossroads baker explosion.jpg|right|thumb|Shot "Baker" of [[Operation Crossroads]] (1946) was the first underwater nuclear explosion.]]
* The ''[[Trinity test|Trinity]]'' test on 16 July 1945, near [[Socorro, New Mexico]], was the first-ever test of a nuclear weapon (yield of around 20 kilotons).
* The ''[[Operation Crossroads]]'' series in July 1946, at [[Bikini Atoll]] in the [[Marshall Islands]], was the first postwar test series and one of the largest military operations in U.S. history.
* The ''[[Operation Greenhouse]]'' shots of May 1951, at [[Enewetak Atoll]] in the Marshall Islands, included the first [[boosted fission weapon]] test (named ''Item'') and a scientific test (named ''George'') which proved the feasibility of thermonuclear weapons.
* The ''[[Ivy Mike]]'' shot of 1 November 1952, at Enewetak Atoll, was the first full test of a [[Teller-Ulam design]] "staged" hydrogen bomb, with a yield of 10 megatons. This was not a deployable weapon. With its full [[cryogenic]] equipment it weighed about 82 tons. {{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}
* The ''[[Castle Bravo]]'' shot of 1 March 1954, at [[Bikini Atoll]], was the first test of a deployable (solid fuel) thermonuclear weapon, and also (accidentally){{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} the largest weapon ever tested by the United States (15 megatons). It was also the single largest U.S. radiological accident in connection with nuclear testing.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} The unanticipated yield, and a change in the weather, resulted in [[nuclear fallout]] spreading eastward onto the inhabited [[Rongelap Atoll|Rongelap]] and [[Rongerik Atoll|Rongerik]] atolls, which were soon evacuated.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} Many of the Marshall Islands natives have since suffered from [[Congenital disorder|birth defects]] and have received some compensation from the [[federal government of the United States]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} A [[Japan]]ese fishing boat, the ''[[Daigo FukuryÅ« Maru]]'', also came into contact with the fallout, which caused many of the crew to grow ill; one eventually died. The crew's exposure was referenced in the film ''Godzilla'' as a criticism of American nuclear tests in the Pacific.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}
* The ''[[Operation Plumbob]]'' series of  May - October 1957 is considered the biggest, longest, and most controversial test series that occurred within the continental United States. Rainier Mesa, Frenchman Flat, and Yucca Flat were all used for the 29 different atmospheric explosions. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.atomicheritage.org/history/operation-plumbbob-1957 |title=Atomic Heritage Foundation, Operation Plumbbob - 1957 |date= |accessdate=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Shot ''Argus I'' of ''[[Operation Argus]]'', on 27 August 1958, was the first detonation of a nuclear weapon in [[outer space]] when a 1.7-kiloton warhead was detonated at 200 kilometers altitude over the South [[Atlantic Ocean]] during a series of [[high-altitude nuclear explosion]]s.
* Shot ''Frigate Bird'' of ''[[Operation Dominic I and II|Operation Dominic]]'' on 6 May 1962, was the only U.S. test of an operational [[ballistic missile]] with a live nuclear warhead (yield of 600 kilotons), at [[Kiritimati]] (formerly Christmas Island) in the Pacific. In general, missile systems were tested without live warheads and warheads were tested separately for safety concerns. In the early 1960s there were mounting questions about how the systems would behave under combat conditions (when they were "mated", in military parlance), and this test was meant to dispel these concerns. However, the warhead had to be somewhat modified before its use, and the missile was only a [[Submarine-launched ballistic missile|SLBM]] (and not an [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBM]]), so by itself it did not satisfy all concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Donald A. |last=MacKenzie |authorlink=Donald Angus MacKenzie |year=1993 |title=Inventing Accuracy: A Historical Sociology of Nuclear Missile Guidance |location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |isbn=978-0-262-63147-1|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=QymEXZIWEe8C&amp;pg=PA343 343â344]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Shot ''[[Sedan (nuclear test)|Sedan]]'' of ''[[Operation Storax]]'' on 6 July 1962 (yield of 104 kilotons), was an attempt at showing the feasibility of using nuclear weapons for civilian, peaceful purposes as part of [[Operation Plowshare]]. In this instance, a 1280-feet-in-diameter and 320-feet-deep [[explosion crater]], morphologically similar to an [[impact crater]], was created at the Nevada Test Site.
* Shot ''Divider'' of [[Operation Julin]] on 23 September 1992, at the Nevada Test Site, was the last U.S. nuclear test. Described as a "test to ensure safety of deterrent forces", the series was interrupted by the beginning of negotiations over the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nv.doe.gov/library/publications/historical/DOENV_317.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103041622/http://www.nv.doe.gov/library/publications/historical/DOENV_317.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of the USSR, the American government (as a member of the International Consortium "[[International Science and Technology Center]]") hired a number of top scientists in [[Sarov]] (aka Arzamas-16, the Soviet equivalent of Los Alamos and thus sometimes called "Los Arzamas") to draft a number of documents about the history of the Soviet atomic program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Yury A Yudin |author2=Project Manager |title=Manuscript on the History of the Soviet Nuclear Weapons and Nuclear Infrastructure|url=http://www.partnershipforglobalsecurity-archive.org/Documents/history-manuscript_eng.pdf|accessdate=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the documents was the definitive list of Soviet nuclear tests.&lt;ref name="USSRList2"/&gt;  Most of the tests have no code names, unlike the American tests, so they are known by their test numbers from this document.  Some list compilers have detected discrepancies in that list; one device was abandoned in its cove in a tunnel in Semipalatinsk when the Soviets abandoned Kazakhstan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Old Soviet Nuclear Site in Asia Has Unlikely Sentinel: The U.S.|author=Ellen Barry|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/22/world/asia/22kazakhstan.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one list&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Johnston Archive of Nuclear Weapons|author=Wm Robert Johnston|url=http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/nuclear/|accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; lists 13 other tests which apparently failed to provide any yield. The source for that was the well respected ''Russian Strategic Nuclear Forces''&lt;ref name=RSNF&gt;{{citation| editor-last=Podvig| editor-first=Pavel| year=2001| title=Russian Strategic Nuclear Forces| publisher=MIT Press| location=Cambridge, MA| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CPRVbYDc-7kC&amp;lpg=PA453| accessdate=2014-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; which confirms 11 of the 13; those 11 are in the Wikipedia lists.

The [[Soviet Union]] conducted 715 nuclear tests (by the official count)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Russia/Sovtestsum.html |title=Soviet Nuclear Test Summary |publisher=Nuclearweaponarchive.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; between 1949 and 1990, including 219 atmospheric, underwater, and space tests. Most of them took place at the [[Semipalatinsk Test Site]] in [[Kazakhstan]] and the [[Novaya Zemlya|Northern Test Site]] at [[Novaya Zemlya]]. Additional industrial tests were conducted at various locations in Russia and Kazakhstan, while a small number of tests were conducted in [[Ukraine]], [[Uzbekistan]], and [[Turkmenistan]].

In addition, the [[Totskoye nuclear test|large-scale military exercise]] was conducted by [[Soviet army]] to explore the possibility of defensive and offensive [[warfare]] operations on the nuclear battlefield. The exercise, under code name of "Snezhok" (Snowball), involved detonation of a nuclear bomb twice as powerful as the one used in [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] and approximately 45,000 soldiers coming through the [[epicenter]] immediately after the blast&lt;ref&gt;[[Viktor Suvorov]], ''[http://militera.lib.ru/research/suvorov7/index.html Shadow of Victory]'' ({{lang|ru|Ð¢ÐµÐ½Ñ Ð¿Ð¾Ð±ÐµÐ´Ñ}}), Donetsk, 2003, {{ISBN|966-696-022-2}}, pages 353â375.&lt;/ref&gt; The exercise was conducted on September 14, 1954, under command of [[Marshal of the Soviet Union|Marshal]] [[Georgy Zhukov]] to the north of [[Totskoye]] village in [[Orenburg Oblast]], [[Russia]].

Some significant Soviet tests include:
* ''[[Joe 1|Operation First Lightning/RDS-1]]'' (known as Joe 1 in the West), August 29, 1949: first Soviet nuclear test.
* ''[[Joe 4|RDS-6s]]'' (known as [[Joe 4]] in the West), August 12, 1953: first Soviet thermonuclear test using a sloika (layer cake) design. The design proved to be unscalable into megaton yields, but it was air-deployable.
* ''[[RDS-37]]'', November 22, 1955: first Soviet multi-megaton, "true" hydrogen bomb test using [[Andrei Sakharov]]'s "third idea", essentially a re-invention of the Teller-Ulam.
* ''[[Tsar Bomba]]'', October 30, 1961: largest nuclear weapon ever detonated, with a design yield of 100&amp;nbsp;Mt, de-rated to 50&amp;nbsp;Mt for the test drop.
* ''[[Chagan (nuclear test)|Chagan]]'', January 15, 1965: large cratering experiment as part of [[Nuclear Explosions for the National Economy]] program, which created an artificial lake.

The last Soviet test took place on October 24, 1990. After the dissolution of the USSR in 1992, Russia inherited the USSR's nuclear stockpile, while Kazakhstan inherited the Semipalatinsk nuclear test area, as well as the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]], the [[Sary Shagan]] missile/radar test area and three ballistic missile fields.  Semipalatinsk included at least the one unexploded device, later blown up with conventional explosives by a combined USA/Kazakh team. No testing has occurred in the former territory of the USSR since its dissolution.

===United Kingdom===

===India===
{{Main|List of Indian nuclear tests}}

[[India]] announced it had conducted a test of a single device in 1974 near Pakistan's [[Pokhran|eastern border]] under the codename ''Operation Smiling Buddha''. After 24 years, India publicly announced five further nuclear tests on May 11 and May 13, 1998. The official number of Indian nuclear tests is six, conducted under two different code-names and at different times.
* May 18, 1974: ''[[Operation Smiling Buddha]]'' (type: implosion, plutonium and underground). One underground test in a horizontal shaft around 107&amp;nbsp;m long under the long-constructed Indian Army [[Pokhran#Pokhran Test Range|Pokhran Test Range]] (IA-PTR) in the [[Thar Desert]], eastern border of Pakistan. The Indian [[India Meteorological Department|Meteorological Department]] and the [[Atomic Energy Commission of India|Atomic Energy Commission]] announced the yield of the weapon at 12&amp;nbsp;kt. Other Western sources claimed the yield to be around 2â12&amp;nbsp;kt. However, the claim was dismissed by the ''[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]'' and it was later reported to be 8&amp;nbsp;kt.&lt;ref name="smiling_buddha"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/India/IndiaSmiling.html|title=India's Nuclear Weapons Program - Smiling Buddha: 1974|publisher=Nuclear Weapon Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* May 11, 1998: ''[[Operation Shakti]]'' (type: implosion, 3 uranium and 2 plutonium devices, all underground). The [[Atomic Energy Commission of India|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) of India and the [[Defence Research and Development Organisation]] (DRDO) simultaneously conducted a test of three nuclear devices at the [[Indian Army]] [[Pokhran#Nuclear test site|Pokhran Test Range]] (IAPTR) on May 11, 1998. Two days later, on May 13, the AEC and DRDO carried out a test of two further nuclear devices, detonated simultaneously. During this operation, AEC India claimed to have tested a three-stage thermonuclear device ([[Teller-Ulam design]]), but the yield of the tests was significantly lower than that expected from thermonuclear devices. The yields remain questionable, at best, by Western and Indian scholars, estimated at 20kt-45kt.

===Pakistan===
{{main|Pakistan's nuclear testing series}}

[[Pakistan]] conducted 6 official tests, under 2 different code names, in the final week of May 1998. From 1983 to 1994, around 24 nuclear cold tests were carried out by Pakistan; these remained unannounced and classified until 2000. In May 1998, Pakistan responded publicly by testing 6 nuclear devices.&lt;ref name="timesofindia.indiatimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Chidanand Rajghatta, TNN, Sep 21, 2009, 12.00am IST |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-09-21/pakistan/28104311_1_uf6-enrichment-centrifuge-plant |title=AQ Khan nails Pakistan's nuke lies - Pakistan - World - The Times of India |publisher=The Times of India |date=2009-09-21 |accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North Korea===
{{Main|North Korea's nuclear testing series}}

On October 9, 2006, [[North Korea]] announced they had conducted [[2006 North Korean nuclear test|a nuclear test]] in [[North Hamgyong Province]] on the northeast coast at 10:36 AM (11:30 AEST). There was a 3.58 magnitude earthquake reported in [[South Korea]]. There was a 4.2 magnitude tremor detected 240 miles north of P'yongyang. The low estimates on the yield of the testâpotentially less than a kiloton in strengthâhave led to speculation as to whether it was a [[Fizzle (nuclear test)|fizzle]] (unsuccessful test), or not a genuine ''nuclear'' test at all.

On May 25, 2009, North Korea announced having conducted [[2009 North Korean nuclear test|a second nuclear test]].  A tremor, with magnitude reports ranging from 4.7 to 5.3, was detected at [[Mantapsan]], 233 miles northeast of P'yongyang and within a few kilometers of the 2006 test location.  While estimates as to yield are still uncertain, with reports ranging from 3 to 20 kilotons, the stronger tremor indicates a significantly larger yield than the 2006 test.

On 12 February 2013, [[North Korea]]n state media announced it had conducted [[2013 North Korean nuclear test|an underground nuclear test]], its third in seven years. A tremor that exhibited a nuclear bomb signature with an initial [[Moment magnitude scale|magnitude]] 4.9 (later revised to 5.1) was detected by both [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization Preparatory Commission]] (CTBTO)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release: On the CTBTO's detection in North Korea|url=http://www.ctbto.org/press-centre/press-releases/2013/on-the-ctbtos-detection-in-north-korea/|publisher=CTBTO|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS).&lt;ref name="USGS report 2013 nuclear test"&gt;{{cite web|title=M5.1 Nuclear Explosion - 24km ENE of Sungjibaegam, North Korea|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/usc000f5t0|work=Earthquake Hazards Program|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|date=12 February 2013|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tremor occurred at 11:57 local time (02:57 [[UTC]]) and the USGS said the [[hypocenter]] of the event was only one [[kilometer]] deep.

On January 5, 2015, North Korean TV news anchors announced that they had successfully tested a "miniaturized atomic bomb", about 5 miles from the Punggye-ri nuclear site where a test was conducted in 2013.

On January 6, 2016, North Korea announced that it conducted a successful test of a hydrogen bomb.

==Alleged tests==
There have been a number of significant alleged/disputed/unacknowledged accounts of countries testing nuclear explosives. Their status is either not certain or entirely disputed by most mainstream experts.

===Germany===
''[[Hitlers Bombe]]'', a book published in German by the historian [[Rainer Karlsch]] in 2005, has alleged that there is evidence that [[Nazi Germany]] performed some sort of test of a "nuclear device" (a hybrid [[Nuclear fusion|fusion]] device unlike any modern nuclear weapons), allegedly on 4 March 1945 near the [[German nuclear weapon project#Controversies regarding alleged nuclear tests|Ohrdruf concentration camp]], though the evidence for this has not yet been confirmed, and has been doubted by many historians.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Israel===
Israel was reported by a West German army report to have made an underground test in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;June 1976, West Germany army publication 'Wehrtechnik'&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=October 2018}} Historian Taysir Nashif reported a zero yield implosion test in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;''Nuclear Weapons in the Middle East: Dimensions and Responsibilities, by Taysir Nashif&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=October 2018}} Scientists from Israel participated in the earliest French nuclear tests before DeGaulle cut off further cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/nuke/guide/israel/nuke/ Federation of American Scientists report on Israeli nuclear program]&lt;/ref&gt;

===North Korea===
{{Main|Ryanggang explosion}}
On September 9, 2004, it was reported by South Korean media that there had been a large explosion at the Chinese/North Korean border. This explosion left a crater visible by satellite and precipitated a large (2 mile diameter) mushroom cloud. The United States and South Korea quickly downplayed this, explaining it away as a forest fire that had nothing to do with the DPRK's nuclear weapons program.
{{Main|List of nuclear weapons tests of North Korea}}
[[North Korea]] has conducted six nuclear tests, in 2006, 2009, 2013, twice in 2016, and 2017. The 3 September 2017 test, like their January 2016 test, is claimed to be a [[hydrogen bomb]] (but may only be a [[boosted fission weapon]] rather than an actual staged TellerâUlam [[thermonuclear weapon]]).

===Pakistan===
Because Pakistan's nuclear programme was conducted under extreme secrecy, it raised concerns in the Soviet Union and India, who suspected that since the 1974 test it was inevitable that Pakistan would further develop its programme. The pro-Soviet newspaper, ''The Patriot'',  reported that "Pakistan has exploded a nuclear device in the range of 20 to 50 kilotons" in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nti.org/e_research/profiles/Pakistan/Nuclear/chronology_1983.html NTI: 1983 in Pakistan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414084207/http://www.nti.org/e_research/profiles/Pakistan/Nuclear/chronology_1983.html |date=2010-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But it was widely dismissed by Western diplomats as it was pointed out that ''The Patriot'' had previously engaged in spreading disinformation on several occasions. In 1983, India and the Soviet Union both investigated secret tests but, due to lack of any scientific data, these statements were widely dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;âS.G. Roy, "India Investigates Reported Nuclear Test," United Press International, 25 June 1983, International; in Lexis-Nexis Academic Universe, 25 June 1983, http://web.lexis-nexis.com; "Pakistan Adamantly Rejects Accusation it Tested Bomb," Washington Post, 26 June 1983, First Section, World News, A24; in Lexis-Nexis Academic Universe, 25 June 1983, http://web.lexis-nexis.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

In their book, ''The Nuclear Express'', authors [[Thomas C. Reed|Thomas Reed]] and Danny Stillman also allege that the People's Republic of China allowed Pakistan to detonate a nuclear weapon at its [[Lop Nur]] test site in 1990, eight years before Pakistan held its first official weapons test.&lt;ref name="HiddenTravelsBroad"&gt;William Broad, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/09/science/09bomb.html "Hidden Travels of the Atomic Bomb"], ''New York Times'' (8 December 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, senior scientist [[Abdul Qadeer Khan]] strongly rejected the claim in May 1998.&lt;ref name="Jang Media Group, Co. "&gt;{{cite web

Additionally, the UK conducted [[British nuclear tests at Maralinga|nuclear tests in Australia]] in the 1950s.

The [[Yekaterinburg Fireball]] of November 14, 2014 is alleged by some&lt;ref&gt;The flash light in Siberia, November 14, 2014, a nuclear test in space, Association Pyrophor, August 16, 2015, available at https://assopyrophor.org/2015/08/16/the-flash-light-in-siberia-nov-14-2014-a-nuclear-test-in-space-le-flash-en-siberie-du-14112014-un-test-nucleaire-dans-lespace/, last retrieved 09/10/2016&lt;/ref&gt; to have been a nuclear test in space, which would not have been detected by the [[CTBTO]] because the CTBTO does not have autonomous ways to monitor space nuclear tests (i.e. satellites) and relies thus on information that member States would accept to provide. The fireball happened a few days before a conference in [[Yekaterinburg]] on the theme of air / missile defence.&lt;ref&gt;CSTO Getting Serious About Joint Air Defense System, Joshua Kucera, November 20, 2014, http://www.eurasianet.org/node/71041&lt;/ref&gt; The affirmation, however, is disputed as the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations claimed it was an "on-ground" explosion.&lt;ref name="siberiantimes.com"&gt;New evidence that fire in the sky was caused by military, The Siberian Times, November 23, 2014, http://siberiantimes.com/other/others/news/n0027-new-evidence-that-fire-in-the-sky-was-caused-by-military/&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Siberian Times'', a local newspaper, noted that "the light was not accompanied by any sound".&lt;ref name="siberiantimes.com"/&gt;

===Vela Incident===
The [[Vela Incident]] was an unidentified ''double flash'' of light detected by a partly functional, decommissioned American [[Vela (satellite)|Vela Satellite]] on September 22, 1979 in the [[Indian Ocean]] (near the [[Prince Edward Islands]] off [[Antarctica]]), other sensors which could have recorded proof of a nuclear test were not functioning on this satellite. It is possible that this was produced by a nuclear device. If this flash detection was actually a nuclear test, a popular theory favored in the diary of then sitting American President [[Jimmy Carter]], is that it resulted from a covert joint [[South African]] and [[Israel]]i nuclear test of an advanced highly miniaturized Israeli artillery shell sized device which was unintentionally detectable by satellite optical sensor due to a break in the cloud cover of a typhoon.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book|last=Hersh|first=Seymour|title=The Samson option: Israel's Nuclear Arsenal and American Foreign Policy|isbn=0-394-57006-5|publisher=Random House|year=1991|ref=harv}}, page 271&lt;/ref&gt;  Analysis of the [[South African nuclear program]] later showed only six of the most crude and heavy designs weighing well over 340&amp;nbsp;kg had been built when they finally declared and disarmed their nuclear arsenal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5942:book-review-how-sa-built-six-atom-bombs-&amp;catid=57:Book+Reviews&amp;Itemid=141|title=Book Review: How SA built six atom bombs  - defenceWeb|first=Leon|last=Engelbrecht|website=www.defenceweb.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1986 [[Mordechai Vanunu|Vanunu]] leaks analyzed by nuclear weapon miniaturization pioneer [[Ted Taylor (physicist)|Ted Taylor]] revealed very sophisticated miniaturized Israeli designs among the evidence presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141003212249/http://www.wisconsinproject.org/countries/israel/israel-aims.html|title=Israel Aims to Improve Missile Accuracy|date=3 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also suspected were France testing a [[neutron bomb]] near their [[Kerguelen Islands]] territory,&lt;ref&gt;Richelson, Jeffrey T.

==Tests of live warheads on rockets==
[[Image:Operation Dominic - Frigate Bird nuclear explosion.jpg|150px|right|thumb|The Frigate Bird explosion seen through the [[periscope]] of [[USS Carbonero (SS-337)|USS ''Carbonero'' (SS-337)]].]]

Missiles and nuclear warheads have usually been tested separately, because testing them together is considered highly dangerous; they are certainly the most extreme type of [[live fire exercise]]. The only US live test of an operational missile was the following:
* ''Frigate Bird'': on May 6, 1962, a [[UGM-27 Polaris]] A-2 missile with a live 600&amp;nbsp;kt W47 warhead was launched from the [[USS Ethan Allen (SSBN-608)|USS ''Ethan Allen'']]; it flew {{convert|1800|km|abbr=on}}, re-entered the atmosphere, and detonated at an altitude of {{convert|3.4|km|abbr=on}} over the South Pacific.

Other live tests with the nuclear explosive delivered by rocket by the USA include:
* On August 1, 1958, [[PGM-11 Redstone|Redstone]] rocket launched nuclear test ''[[Hardtack Teak|Teak]]'' that detonated at an altitude of {{convert|77.8|km|abbr=on}}. On August 12, 1958, Redstone #CC51 launched nuclear test ''Orange'' to a detonation altitude of {{convert|43|km|abbr=on}}. Both were part of ''[[Operation Hardtack I]]'' and had a yield of 3.75&amp;nbsp;Mt
* ''[[Operation Argus]]'': three tests above the South Atlantic Ocean, August 27, August 30, and September 6, 1958
* On July 9, 1962, [[PGM-17 Thor|Thor missile]] launched a Mk4 reentry vehicle containing a W49 thermonuclear warhead to an altitude of 248 miles (400&amp;nbsp;km). The warhead detonated with a yield of 1.45&amp;nbsp;Mt. This was the ''[[Starfish Prime]]'' event of nuclear test operation ''[[Operation Fishbowl|Dominic-Fishbowl]]''
* In the ''[[Operation Fishbowl|Dominic-Fishbowl]]'' series in 1962: ''Checkmate, Bluegill, Kingfish'' and ''Tightrope''
* The 1957 test ''[[Operation Plumbbob|Plumbbob/John]]'' fired a small yield nuclear weapon on a Genie air-to-air rocket from a jet fighter.

The Soviet Union tested nuclear explosives on rockets as part of their development of a localised [[anti-ballistic missile]] system in the 1960s. Some of the Soviet nuclear tests with warheads delivered by rocket include:
* Baikal (USSR Test #25, February 2, 1956, at [[Aralsk]]) â one test, with a [[R-5M]] rocket launch from Kapustin Yar; fizzled.
* ZUR-215 (#34, January 19, 1957, at [[Kapustin Yar]]) â one test, with a rocket launch from Kapustin Yar.
* (#82 and 83, early November 1958) two tests, done after declared cease fire for test moratorium negotiations, from Kapustin Yar.
* Groza (#88, September 6, 1961, at Kapustin Yar) â one test, with a rocket launch from Kapustin Yar.
* Grom (#115, October 6, 1961, at Kapustin Yar) â one test, with a rocket launch from Kapustin Yar.
* Volga (#106 and 108, September 20â22, 1961, at [[Novaya Zemlya]]) â two tests, with [[R-11M]] rockets launch from [[Rogachevo (air base)|Rogachevo]].
* Roza (#94 and 99, September 12â16, 1961, at Novaya Zemlya) â two tests, with [[R-12 Dvina|R-12]] rockets launch from [[Vorkuta]].
* [[Raduga (nuclear test)|Raduga]] (#121, October 20, 1961, at Novaya Zemlya) â one test, with a [[R-13 (missile)|R-13]] rocket launch.
* Tyulpan (#164, September 8, 1962, at Novaya Zemlya) â one test, with [[R-14 Chusovaya|R-14]] rockets launched from [[Chita, Zabaykalsky Krai|Chita]].
* [[Soviet Project K nuclear tests|Operation K]] (1961 and 1962, at [[Sary-Shagan]]) â five tests, at high altitude, with rockets launched from Kapustin Yar.

The People's Republic of China conducted CHIC-4 with a [[Dongfeng-2]] rocket launch in October 27, 1966. The warhead exploded with a yield of 12 kt.

'''Malaria vaccine''' is a [[vaccine]] that is used to prevent [[malaria]]. The only approved vaccine as of 2015 is RTS,S. It requires four injections, and has a relatively low [[vaccine efficacy|efficacy]]. Due to this low efficacy, [[WHO]] does not recommend the use of RTS,S vaccine in babies between 6 and 12 weeks of age.&lt;ref name=WHO2016&gt;{{cite journal|title=Malaria vaccine: WHO position paper â January 2016|journal=Weekly epidemiological record|date=Nov 4, 2016|volume=91|issue=4|pages=33â52|url=http://www.who.int/wer/2016/wer9104.pdf?ua=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vaccine is going to be studied further in Africa in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ghana, Kenya and Malawi to take part in WHO malaria vaccine pilot programme|url=http://www.afro.who.int/en/media-centre/pressreleases/item/9533-ghana-kenya-and-malawi-to-take-part-in-who-malaria-vaccine-pilot-programme.html|accessdate=27 April 2017|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research continues into recombinant protein and attenuated whole organism vaccines.

==Approved vaccines==

===RTS,S===
{{Main|RTS,S}}
RTS,S (developed by [[PATH (global health organization)#Malaria|PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI)]] and [[GlaxoSmithKline]] (GSK) with support from the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]]) is the most recently developed [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]] vaccine. It consists of the ''P. falciparum'' [[circumsporozoite protein]] (CSP) from the pre-erythrocytic stage. The CSP antigen causes the production of antibodies capable of preventing the invasion of [[hepatocytes]] and additionally elicits a cellular response enabling the destruction of infected hepatocytes. The CSP vaccine presented problems in trials due to its poor [[immunogenicity]]. RTS,S attempted to avoid these by fusing the protein with a surface antigen from [[hepatitis B]], hence creating a more potent and immunogenic vaccine.

==Considerations==
The task of developing a preventive vaccine for malaria is a complex process. There are a number of considerations to be made concerning what strategy a potential vaccine should adopt.

===Parasite diversity===

''P. falciparum'' has demonstrated the capability, through the development of multiple drug-resistant parasites, for evolutionary change. The [[Plasmodium|''Plasmodium'' species]] has a very high rate of replication, much higher than that actually needed to ensure transmission in the parasiteâs life cycle. This enables pharmaceutical treatments that are effective at reducing the reproduction rate, but not halting it, to exert a high selection pressure, thus favoring the development of resistance. The process of evolutionary change is one of the key considerations necessary when considering potential vaccine candidates. The development of resistance could cause a significant reduction in efficacy of any potential vaccine thus rendering useless a carefully developed and effective treatment. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

===Choosing to address the symptom or the source===

The parasite induces two main response types from the human immune system.  These are anti-parasitic immunity and anti-toxic immunity.

*"Anti-parasitic immunity" addresses the source; it consists of an antibody response ([[humoral immunity]]) and a cell-mediated immune response. Ideally a vaccine would enable the development of anti-plasmodial [[antibodies]] in addition to generating an elevated cell-mediated response.  Potential antigens against which a vaccine could be targeted will be discussed in greater depth later. Antibodies are part of the specific immune response. They exert their effect by activating the complement cascade, stimulating [[phagocytic cells]] into [[endocytosis]] through adhesion to an external surface of the antigenic substances, thus âmarkingâ it as offensive.  Humoral or cell-mediated immunity consists of many interlinking mechanisms that essentially aim to prevent infection entering the body (through external barriers or hostile internal environments) and then kill any micro-organisms or foreign particles that succeed in penetration. The cell-mediated component consists of many white blood cells (such as [[monocytes]], [[neutrophils]], [[macrophages]], [[lymphocytes]], [[basophils]], [[mast cells]], [[natural killer cells]], and [[eosinophils]]) that target foreign bodies by a variety of different mechanisms. In the case of malaria both systems would be targeted to attempt to increase the potential response generated, thus ensuring the maximum chance of preventing disease. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}
*"Anti-toxic immunity" addresses the symptoms; it refers to the suppression of the immune response associated with the production of factors that either induce symptoms or reduce the effect that any toxic by-products (of micro-organism presence) have on the development of disease. For example, it has been shown that [[Tumor necrosis factor-alpha]] has a central role in generating the symptoms experienced in severe ''P. falciparum'' malaria. Thus a therapeutic vaccine could target the production of TNF-a, preventing respiratory distress and cerebral symptoms. This approach has serious limitations as it would not reduce the parasitic load; rather it only reduces the associated pathology.  As a result, there are substantial difficulties in evaluating efficacy in human trials.

Taking this information into consideration an ideal vaccine candidate would attempt to generate a more substantial cell-mediated and antibody response on parasite presentation. This would have the benefit of increasing the rate of parasite clearance, thus reducing the experienced symptoms and providing a level  of consistent future immunity against the parasite.

===Potential targets===

By their very nature, protozoa are more complex organisms than bacteria and viruses, with more complicated structures and life cycles. This presents problems in vaccine development but also increases the number of potential targets for a vaccine. These have been summarised into the life cycle stage and the antibodies that could potentially elicit an immune response.

The epidemiology of malaria varies enormously across the globe, and has led to the belief that it may be necessary to adopt very different vaccine development strategies to target the different populations. A Type 1 vaccine is suggested for those exposed mostly to ''P. falciparum'' malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, with the primary objective to reduce the number of severe malaria cases and deaths in infants and children exposed to high transmission rates. The Type 2 vaccine could be thought of as a âtravellersâ vaccineâ, aiming to prevent all cases of clinical symptoms in individuals with no previous exposure. This is another major public health problem, with malaria presenting as one of the most substantial threats to travellersâ health. Problems with the current available pharmaceutical therapies include costs, availability, adverse effects and contraindications, inconvenience and compliance, many of which would be reduced or eliminated entirely if an effective (greater than 85â90%) vaccine was developed. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

The life cycle of the malaria parasite is particularly complex, presenting initial developmental problems. Despite the huge number of vaccines available at the current time, there are none that target parasitic infections. The distinct developmental stages involved in the life cycle present numerous opportunities for targeting antigens, thus potentially eliciting an immune response.  Theoretically, each developmental stage could have a vaccine developed specifically to target the parasite. Moreover, any vaccine produced would ideally have the ability to be of therapeutic value as well as preventing further transmission and is likely to consist of a combination of antigens from different phases of the parasiteâs development.  More than 30 of these antigens are currently being researched by teams all over the world in the hope of identifying a combination that can elicit immunity in the inoculated individual. Some of the approaches involve surface expression of the antigen, inhibitory effects of specific antibodies on the life cycle and the protective effects through immunization or passive transfer of antibodies between an immune and a non-immune host. The majority of research into malarial vaccines has focused on the ''Plasmodium falciparum'' strain due to the high mortality caused by the parasite and the ease of a carrying out in vitro/in vivo studies. The earliest vaccines attempted to use the parasitic [[circumsporozoite]] (CS) protein. This is the most dominant surface antigen of the initial pre-erythrocytic phase. However, problems were encountered due to low efficacy, [[reactogenicity]] and low [[immunogenicity]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

*The initial stage in the life cycle, following inoculation, is a relatively short "pre-erythrocytic" or "hepatic" phase. A vaccine at this stage must have the ability to protect against sporozoites invading and possibly inhibiting the development of parasites in the hepatocytes (through inducing [[cytotoxic]] [[T-lymphocytes]] that can destroy the infected [[liver cells]]). However, if any sporozoites evaded the immune system they would then have the potential to be symptomatic and cause the clinical disease.
*The second phase of the life cycle is the "erythrocytic" or blood phase. A vaccine here could prevent [[merozoite]] multiplication or the invasion of [[red blood cells]]. This approach is complicated by the lack of [[Major histocompatibility complex|MHC molecule]] expression on the surface of erythrocytes. Instead, malarial antigens are expressed, and it is this towards which the antibodies could potentially be directed. Another approach would be to attempt to block the process of erythrocyte adherence to blood vessel walls. It is thought that this process is accountable for much of the clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection; therefore a vaccine given during this stage would be therapeutic and hence administered during clinical episodes to prevent further deterioration. 
*The last phase of the life cycle that has the potential to be targeted by a vaccine is the "sexual stage". This would not give any protective benefits to the individual inoculated but would prevent further transmission of the parasite by preventing the [[gametocytes]] from producing multiple sporozoites in the gut wall of the mosquito. It therefore would be used as part of a policy directed at eliminating the parasite from areas of low prevalence or to prevent the development and spread of vaccine-resistant parasites. This type of transmission-blocking vaccine is potentially very important. The evolution of resistance in the malaria parasite occurs very quickly, potentially making any vaccine redundant within a few generations. This approach to the prevention of spread is therefore essential.
*Another approach is to target the [[protein kinases]], which are present during the entire lifecyle of the malaria parasite. Research is underway on this, yet production of an actual vaccine targeting these protein kinases may still take a long time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhang VM, Chavchich M, Waters NC |title=Targeting protein kinases in the malaria parasite: update of an antimalarial drug target |journal=Curr Top Med Chem  |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=456â72 |date=March 2012 |pmid=22242850 |doi= 10.2174/156802612799362922|url=http://www.benthamdirect.org/pages/content.php?CTMC/2012/00000012/00000005/0006R.SGM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If proved successful, the clinical trials in patients could begin in the next two to three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/press-releases/new-candidate-vaccine-neutralizes-all-tested-strains-malaria-parasite|title=New candidate vaccine neutralizes all tested strains of malaria parasite|author=Martino, Maureen|publisher=FierceBiotech|date=21 December 2011|work=fiercebiotech.com|accessdate=December 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[Plasmodium vivax]]'' is the common malaria species found in India, Southeast Asia and South America.   It is able to stay dormant in the [[liver]] and reemerge years later to elicit new infections.  Two key proteins involved in the invasion of the red blood cells (RBC) by ''P. vivax'' are potential targets for drug or vaccine development.  When the Duffy binding protein (DBP) of ''P. vivax'' binds the Duffy antigen (DARC) on the surface of RBC, process for the parasite to enter the RBC is initiated.  Structures of the core region of DARC and the receptor binding pocket of DBP have been mapped by scientists at the [[Washington University in St. Louis]].  The researchers found that the binding is a two-step process which involves two copies of the parasite protein act together like a pair of tong and 'clamp'â two copies of DARC.    Antibodies that interfere with the binding, by either targeting the key region of the DARC or the DBP will prevent the infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fiercebiotechresearch.com/story/protein-discovery-could-aid-malaria-vaccine-design/2014-01-13|title=Scientists capture key protein structures that could aid malaria vaccine design|author=Mullin, Emily|publisher=fiercebiotechresearch.com|date=13 January 2014|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Batchelor|first1=J.|last2=Malpede|first2=B.|last3=Omattage|first3=N.|last4=DeKoster|first4=G.|last5=Henzler-Wildman|first5=K.|last6=Tolia|first6=N.|title=Red Blood Cell Invasion by ''Plasmodium vivax'': Structural Basis for DBP Engagement of DARC|journal=[[PLOS Pathogens]]|volume=10|issue=1|page= e1003869|year=2014|publisher=[[PLOS]]|doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1003869|url= http://www.plospathogens.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1003869}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Antibodies against the [[Schizont]] Egress Antigen-1 (PfSEA-1) were found to disable the parasite ability to rupture from the infected red blood cells (RBCs) thus prevent it from continuing with its life cycle.  Researchers from [[Rhode Island Hospital]] identified ''Plasmodium falciparum'' PfSEA-1, a 244 kd malaria antigen expressed in the schizont-infected RBCs.  Mice vaccinated with the recombinant PfSEA-1 produced antibodies which interrupted the schizont rupture from the RBCs and decreased the parasite replication.  The vaccine protected the mice from lethal challenge of the parasite.  Tanzanian and Kenyan children who have antibodies to PfSEA-1 were found to have fewer parasites in their blood stream and milder case of malaria.  By blocking the schizont outlet, the PfSEA-1 vaccine may work synergistically with vaccines targeting the other stages of the malaria life cycle such as [[hepatocyte]] and RBC invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fiercebiotechresearch.com/story/antigen-discovery-could-advance-malaria-vaccine/2014-05-27|title=Antigen Discovery could advance malaria vaccine|author=Mullin, Emily|publisher=fiercebiotechresearch.com|date=27 May 2014|accessdate=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|displayauthors=2|last1=Raj|first1=D|last2=Kurtis|first2=J|last3=Nixon|first3=C|title=Antibodies to PfSEA-1 block parasite egress from RBCs and protect against malaria infection|journal=Science|volume=344|issue=6186|pages=871â877|year=2014|publisher=AAAS|doi= 10.1126/science.1254417|url= http://www.sciencemag.org/content/344/6186/871|pmid=24855263|pmc=4184151|bibcode=2014Sci...344..871R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mix of antigenic components===

Increasing the potential immunity generated against ''Plasmodia'' can be achieved by attempting to target multiple phases in the life cycle. This is additionally beneficial in reducing the possibility of resistant parasites developing. The use of multiple-parasite antigens can therefore have a synergistic or additive effect.

One of the most successful vaccine candidates currently in clinical trials{{which|date=April 2017}} consists of recombinant antigenic proteins to the circumsporozoite protein.&lt;ref name="pmid19633296"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Plassmeyer ML, Reiter K, Shimp RL, etal |title=Structure of the ''Plasmodium falciparum'' Circumsporozoite Protein, a Leading Malaria Vaccine Candidate |journal=J.

===Delivery system===

The selection of an appropriate system is fundamental in all vaccine development, but especially so in the case of malaria. A vaccine targeting several antigens may require delivery to different areas and by different means in order to elicit an effective response. Some [[adjuvants]] can direct the vaccine to the specifically targeted cell typeâe.g. the use of [[Hepatitis B virus]] in the [[RTS,S]] vaccine to target infected hepatocytesâbut in other cases, particularly when using combined antigenic vaccines, this approach is very complex. Some methods that have been attempted include the use of two vaccines, one directed at generating a blood response and the other a liver-stage response. These two vaccines could then be injected into two different sites, thus enabling the use of a more specific and potentially efficacious delivery system.

To increase, accelerate or modify the development of an immune response to a vaccine candidate it is often necessary to combine the antigenic substance to be delivered with an adjuvant or specialised delivery system. These terms are often used interchangeably in relation to vaccine development; however in most cases a distinction can be made. An adjuvant is typically thought of as a substance used in combination with the antigen to produce a more substantial and robust immune response than that elicited by the antigen alone. This is achieved through three mechanisms: by affecting the antigen delivery and presentation, by inducing the production of immunomodulatory cytokines, and by affecting the [[antigen presenting cells]] (APC). Adjuvants can consist of many different materials, from cell microparticles to other particulated delivery systems (e.g. [[liposome]]s).

Adjuvants are crucial in affecting the specificity and isotype of the necessary antibodies. They are thought to be able to potentiate the link between the innate and adaptive immune responses. Due to the diverse nature of substances that can potentially have this effect on the immune system, it is difficult to classify adjuvants into specific groups. In most circumstances they consist of easily identifiable components of micro-organisms that are recognised by the innate immune system cells. The role of delivery systems is primarily to direct the chosen adjuvant and antigen into target cells to attempt to increase the efficacy of the vaccine further, therefore acting synergistically with the adjuvant.

There is increasing concern that the use of very potent adjuvants could precipitate autoimmune responses, making it imperative that the vaccine is focused on the target cells only. Specific delivery systems can reduce this risk by limiting the potential toxicity and systemic distribution of newly developed adjuvants.

Studies into the efficacy of malaria vaccines developed to date have illustrated that the presence of an adjuvant is key in determining any protection gained against malaria. A large number of natural and synthetic adjuvants have been identified throughout the history of vaccine development. Options identified thus far for use combined with a malaria vaccine include mycobacterial cell walls, liposomes, monophosphoryl lipid A and squalene.

==Agents under development==
A completely effective vaccine is not yet available for malaria, although several vaccines are under development. SPf66 a synthetic peptide based vaccine developed by [[Manuel Elkin Patarroyo]] team in [[Colombia]] was tested extensively in endemic areas in the 1990s, but clinical trials showed it to be insufficiently effective, 28% efficacy in South America and minimal or no efficacy in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16625647 |year=2006 |vauthors=Graves P, Gelband H |title=Vaccines for preventing malaria (SPf66) |issue=2 |pages=CD005966 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005966 |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other vaccine candidates, targeting the blood-stage of the parasite's life cycle, have also been insufficient on their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17054281 |year=2006 |vauthors=Graves P, Gelband H |title=Vaccines for preventing malaria (blood-stage) |issue=4 |pages=CD006199 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006199 |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several potential vaccines targeting the pre-erythrocytic stage are being developed, with [[RTS,S]] showing the most promising results so far.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17054280 |year=2006 |vauthors=Graves P, Gelband H |title=Vaccines for preventing malaria (pre-erythrocytic) |issue=4 |pages=CD006198 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006198 |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="doi10.1056/NEJMoa1208394"&gt;{{cite journal | author1= RTS&amp;#x2c;S Clinical Trials Partnership | last2= Agnandji | first2= S.

* The CSP (Circum-Sporozoite Protein) was a vaccine developed that initially appeared promising enough to undergo trials. It is also based on the circumsporozoite protein, but additionally has the recombinant (Asn-Ala-Pro15Asn-Val-Asp-Pro)2-Leu-Arg([[R32LR]]) protein covalently bound to a purified ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' toxin (A9). However at an early stage a complete lack of protective immunity was demonstrated in those inoculated. The study group used in [[Kenya]] had an 82% incidence of [[parasitaemia]] whilst the control group only had an 89% incidence. The vaccine intended to cause an increased T-lymphocyte response in those exposed, this was also not observed. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}
* The [[NYVAC-Pf7]] multi-stage vaccine attempted to use different technology, incorporating seven ''P.falciparum'' antigenic genes. These came from a variety of stages during the life cycle. CSP and sporozoite surface protein 2 (called [[PfSSP2]]) were derived from the sporozoite phase. The liver stage antigen 1 (LSA1), three from the erythrocytic stage (merozoite surface protein 1, serine repeat antigen and AMA-1) and one sexual stage antigen (the 25-kDa Pfs25) were included. This was first investigated using [[Rhesus monkeys]] and produced encouraging results: 4 out of the 7 antigens produced specific antibody responses (CSP, PfSSP2, [[Merozoite surface protein|MSP1]] and PFs25). Later trials in humans, despite demonstrating cellular immune responses in over 90% of the subjects had very poor antibody responses. Despite this following administration of the vaccine some candidates had complete protection when challenged with ''P.falciparum''. This result has warranted ongoing trials. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}
* In 1995 a field trial involving [NANP]19-5.1 proved to be very successful. Out of 194 children vaccinated none developed symptomatic malaria in the 12-week follow up period and only 8 failed to have higher levels of antibody present. The vaccine consists of the [[schizont export protein]] (5.1) and 19 repeats of the sporozoite surface protein [NANP]. Limitations of the technology exist as it contains only 20% [[peptide]] and has low levels of immunogenicity. It also does not contain any immunodominant T-cell [[epitopes]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

=== Nanoparticle enhancement of RTS,S ===
In 2015, researchers used a repetitive antigen display technology to engineer a nanoparticle that displayed malaria specific B cell and T cell epitopes. The particle exhibited [[Regular icosahedron|icosahedral]] symmetry and carried on its surface up to 60 copies of the RTS,S protein. The researchers claimed that the density of the protein was much higher than the 14% of the GSK vaccine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rdmag.com/news/2014/09/researchers-nanoparticle-key-new-malaria-vaccine|title=Researcherâs nanoparticle key to new malaria vaccine|date=2014-09-04|website=Research &amp; Development|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burkhard|first=Peter|last2=Lanar|first2=David E.|date=2015-12-02|title=Malaria vaccine based on self-assembling protein nanoparticles|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1586/14760584.2015.1096781|journal=Expert Review of Vaccines|volume=14|issue=12|pages=1525â1527|doi=10.1586/14760584.2015.1096781|issn=1476-0584|pmid=26468608|pmc=5019124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== PfSPZ vaccine===
{{Main|PfSPZ vaccine}}
The PfSPZ vaccine is a candidate malaria vaccine developed by [[Sanaria]] using radiation-attenuated [[sporozoite]]s to elicit an immune response. Clinical trials have been promising, with trials taking place in Africa, Europe, and the US protecting over 80% of volunteers.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} It has been subject to some criticism regarding the ultimate feasibility of large-scale production and delivery in Africa, since it must be stored in [[liquid nitrogen]].

The PfSPZ vaccine candidate has granted [[Fast track (FDA)|fast track designation]] by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] &lt;!-- (FDA) --&gt; in September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanaria.com/pdf/Fast%20Track%20Press%20Release%2022SEP2016.pdf |title=SANARIA PfSPZ VACCINE AGAINST MALARIA RECEIVES FDA FAST TRACK DESIGNATION |publisher=Sanaria Inc. |date=2016-09-22 |accessdate=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{expand section|date=February 2018|reason=Long history of failed attempts; current material is one-sided and mainly recent.}}

Individuals who are exposed to the parasite in endemic countries develop acquired immunity against disease and death. Such immunity does not however prevent malarial infection; immune individuals often harbour asymptomatic parasites in their blood.  This does, however, imply that it is possible to create an immune response that protects against the harmful effects of the parasite.

Research shows that if [[immunoglobulin]] is taken from immune adults, purified and then given to individuals who have no protective immunity, some protection can be gained.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

===Irradiated mosquitoes ===
{{expand section|date=August 2016}} &lt;!-- What came of this?  Why don't we use this now? --&gt;
In 1967, it was reported that a level of immunity to the [[Plasmodium berghei]] parasite could be given to mice by exposing them to [[sporozoites]] that had been [[Irradiation|irradiated]] by x-rays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Nussenzweig | first = Ruth | authorlink = Ruth Nussenzweig | author2 = J.

[[file:Cooking Mandolin with Carrot.jpg|right|thumb|A mandoline used for slicing a carrot]]

A '''mandoline''' ({{IPAc-en|Ë|m|Ã¦|n|d|É|Ë|l|iË|n|,_|-|Ë|l|Éª|n}} or {{IPAc-en|Ë|m|Ã¦|n|d|É|l|áµ»|n}};{{refn|{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|accessdate=2016-01-22|Mandoline}}}}{{refn|{{OxfordDictionaries.com|accessdate=2016-01-22|Mandoline}}}} {{IPA-fr|mÉÌdolin}}) is a [[cooking utensil]] used for slicing and for cutting [[Julienning|juliennes]]; with suitable attachments, it can make [[crinkle-cut]]s. Its name is derived from the wrist-motion of a skilled user of a mandolin, which resembles that of a player of the musical instrument [[mandolin]].

== Design ==

A mandoline consists of two parallel working surfaces, one of which can be adjusted in height.&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mandoline&lt;/ref&gt; A food item is slid along the adjustable surface until it reaches a blade mounted on the fixed surface, slicing it and letting it fall.

Other blades perpendicular to the main blade are often mounted so that the slice is cut into strips. The mandoline juliennes in several widths and thicknesses. It also makes slices, waffle cuts and crinkle cuts, and dices firm vegetables and fruits.

With a mandoline, slices are uniform in thickness,&lt;ref name="fantes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fantes.com/slicers-mandolins.html|title=Mandolines and Slicers|website=www.fantes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is important with foods that are deep-fried or baked (e.g. [[potato chips]]), as well as for presentation. Slices can be very thin, and be made very quickly, with significantly less skill and effort than would be required if cutting with a [[knife]] or other blade.&lt;ref name="fantes.com"/&gt;

== Operation ==

A mandoline is used by running a piece of food (with some protection for fingers) along an adjustable inclined plane into one or more blades. On some models vertical blades cut to produce julienne, or a wavy blade is used that produces crinkle cuts. In these models a quarter turn to the food between passes produces dice and waffle cuts.

[[File:TafelSpitz-Tranchieren.JPG|thumb|[[Tafelspitz]], a popular Austrian dish, being carved.]]
'''Meat carving''' is the process and skill of cutting portions of meat, such as [[roasting|roast]] and [[poultry]], to obtain a maximum or satisfactory number of meat portions, using a [[carving knife]] or meat-slicing machine. A meat carver disjoints the meat and slices in uniform portions. Meat carving is sometimes considered a skill for the private dinner table.

{{Refimprove|date=September 2018}}
A '''mobile network operator''' or '''MNO''', also known as a '''wireless service provider''', '''wireless carrier''', '''cellular company''', or '''mobile network carrier''', is a provider of [[wireless communications]] services that owns or controls all the elements necessary to sell and deliver services to an end user including [[radio spectrum]] allocation, [[wireless network]] infrastructure, [[Backhaul (telecommunications)|back haul]]  infrastructure, billing, customer care, [[provisioning]] computer systems and marketing and repair organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27804/mobile-network-operator-mno/|title=What is a Mobile Network Operator (MNO)? - Definition from Technopedia|website=Technopedia|access-date=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=September 2018}}

In addition to obtaining revenue by offering retail services under its own brand, an MNO may also sell access to network services at wholesale rates to mobile virtual network operators.

A key defining characteristic of a mobile network operator is that an MNO must own or control access to a [[frequency allocation|radio spectrum license]] from a regulatory or government entity. A second key defining characteristic of an MNO is that an MNO must own or control the elements of the network infrastructure necessary to provide services to subscribers over the licensed spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/opinionista/2018-07-04-why-a-wireless-open-access-network-wont-work/#.Wz_ildhKjBI|title=Why a wireless open access network wonât work|publisher=Daily Maverick|author=Ivo Vegter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mobile network operator typically also has the necessary provisioning, billing and customer care computer systems and the marketing, customer care and engineering organizations needed to sell, deliver and bill for services. However, an MNO can outsource any of these systems or functions and still be considered a mobile network operator.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16711">{{Memory types}}

'''Nano-RAM''' is a proprietary [[computer memory]] technology from the company '''Nantero'''. It is a type of [[nonvolatile random access memory]] based on the position of [[carbon nanotubes]] deposited on a chip-like substrate. In theory, the small size of the nanotubes allows for very high density memories. Nantero also refers to it as '''NRAM.'''

==Technology==
The first generation Nantero NRAM technology was based on a three-terminal [[semiconductor device]] where a third terminal is used to switch the memory cell between memory states.  The second generation NRAM technology is based on a two-terminal memory cell. The two-terminal cell has advantages such as a smaller cell size, better scalability to sub-20&amp;nbsp;nm nodes (see [[semiconductor device fabrication]]), and the ability to [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivate]] the memory cell during fabrication.

In a non-woven fabric matrix of [[carbon nanotubes]] (CNTs), crossed nanotubes can either be touching or slightly separated depending on their position.  When touching, the carbon nanotubes are held together by [[Van der Waals forces]].  Each NRAM "cell" consists of an interlinked network of CNTs located between two electrodes as illustrated in Figure 1.  The CNT fabric is located between two metal electrodes, which is defined and etched by [[photolithography]], and forms the NRAM cell.

[[File:NRAM fabric.png |thumb|upright=1.4 |Carbon nanotube fabric]]

The NRAM acts as a resistive non-volatile [[random access memory]] (RAM) and can be placed in two or more resistive modes depending on the resistive state of the CNT fabric.  When the CNTs are not in contact the [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] state of the fabric is high and represents an "off" or "0" state.  When the CNTs are brought into contact, the resistance state of the fabric is low and represents an "on" or "1" state.  NRAM acts as a memory because the two resistive states are very stable.   In the 0 state, the CNTs (or a portion of them) are not in contact and remain in a separated state due to the stiffness of the CNTs resulting in a high resistance or low  current measurement state between the top and bottom electrodes.   In the 1 state, the CNTs (or a portion of them) are in contact and remain contacted due to Van der Waals forces between the CNTs, resulting in a low resistance or high current measurement state between the top and bottom electrodes. Note that other sources of resistance such as contact resistance between electrode and CNT can be significant and also need to be considered.

To switch the NRAM between states, a small voltage greater than the read voltage is applied between top and bottom electrodes.  If the NRAM is in the 0 state, the voltage applied will cause an electrostatic attraction between the CNTs close to each other causing a SET operation.  After the applied voltage is removed, the CNTs remain in a 1 or low resistance state due to physical adhesion (Van der Waals force) with an [[activation energy]] (E&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;) of approximately 5eV.  If the NRAM cell is in the 1 state, applying a voltage greater than the read voltage will generate CNT phonon excitations with sufficient energy to separate the CNT junctions.  This is the phonon driven RESET operation.    The CNTs remain in the OFF or high resistance state due to the high mechanical stiffness ([[Young's Modulus]] 1 TPa) with an activation energy (E&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;) much greater than 5 eV.  Figure 2 illustrates both states of an individual pair of CNTs involved in the switch operation. Due to the high activation energy (&gt; 5eV) required for switching between states, the NRAM switch resists outside interference like radiation and [[operating temperature]] that can erase or flip conventional memories like [[DRAM]].

NRAMs are fabricated by depositing a uniform layer of CNTs onto a prefabricated array of drivers such as transistors as shown in Figure 1. The bottom electrode of the NRAM cell is in contact with the underlying [[via (electronics)]] connecting the cell to the driver.  The bottom electrode may be fabricated as part of the underlying via or it may be fabricated simultaneously with the NRAM cell, when the cell is photolithographically defined and etched.   Before the cell is photolithographically defined and etched, the top electrode is deposited as a metal film onto the CNT layer so that the top metal electrode is patterned and etched during the definition of the NRAM cell.   Following the dielectric passivation and fill of the array, the top metal electrode is exposed by etching back the overlying dielectric using a smoothing process such as [[chemical-mechanical planarization]].  With the top electrode exposed, the next level of metal wiring interconnect is fabricated to complete the NRAM array.   Figure 3 illustrates one circuit method to select a single cell for writing and reading. Using a cross-grid interconnect arrangement, the NRAM and driver, (the cell), forms a memory array similar to other memory arrays.  A single cell can be selected by applying the proper voltages to the word line (WL), bit line (BL), and select lines (SL) without disturbing the other cells in the array.

==Characteristics==
NRAM has a density, at least in theory, similar to that of DRAM.  DRAM includes capacitors, which are essentially two small metal plates with a thin insulator between them. NRAM has terminals and electrodes roughly the same size as the plates in a DRAM, the nanotubes between them being so much smaller they add nothing to the overall size. However it seems there is a minimum size at which a DRAM can be built, below which there is simply not enough charge being stored on the plates. NRAM appears to be limited only by [[lithography]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}. This means that NRAM may be able to become much denser than DRAM, perhaps also less expensive.  Unlike DRAM, NRAM does not require power to "refresh" it, and will retain its memory even after power is removed. Thus the power needed to write and retain the memory state of the device is much lower than DRAM, which has to build up charge on the cell plates. This means that NRAM might compete with DRAM in terms of cost, but also require less power, and as a result also be much faster because write performance is largely determined by the total charge needed. NRAM can theoretically reach performance similar to SRAM, which is faster than DRAM but much less dense, and thus much more expensive.

==Comparison with other non-volatile memory==

Compared with other [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] random-access memory (NVRAM) technologies, NRAM has several advantages. In [[flash memory]], the common form of NVRAM, each cell resembles a [[MOSFET]] transistor with a control gate (CG) modulated by a floating gate (FG) interposed between the CG and the FG.  The FG is surrounded by an insulating dielectric, typically an oxide.  Since the FG is electrically isolated by the surrounding dielectric, any electrons placed on the FG will be trapped on the FG which screens the CG from the channel of the transistor and modifies the threshold voltage (VT) of the transistor.   By writing and controlling the amount of charge placed on the FG, the FG controls the conduction state of the MOSFET flash device depending on the VT of the cell selected.  The current flowing through the MOSFET channel is sensed to determine the state of the cell forming a [[binary code]] where a 1 state (current flow) when an appropriate CG voltage is applied and a 0 state (no current flow) when the CG voltage is applied.

After being written to, the insulator traps electrons on the FG, locking it into the 0 state. However, in order to change that bit, the insulator has to be "overcharged" to erase any charge already stored in it. This requires higher voltage, about 10 volts, much more than a battery can provide. Flash systems include a "[[charge pump]]" that slowly builds up power and releases it at higher voltage. This process is not only slow, but degrades the insulators. For this reason flash has a limited number of writes before the device will no longer operate effectively.

NRAM reads and writes are both "low energy" in comparison to flash (or DRAM for that matter due to "refresh"), meaning NRAM could have longer battery life. It may also be much faster to write than either, meaning it may be used to replace both. Modern phones include flash memory for storing phone numbers, DRAM for higher performance working memory because flash is too slow, and some SRAM for even higher performance. Some NRAM could be placed on the CPU to act as the [[CPU cache]], and more in other chips replacing both the DRAM and flash.

NRAM is one of a variety of new memory systems, many of which claim to be "[[Universal memory|universal]]" in the same fashion as NRAM&amp;nbsp;â replacing everything from flash to DRAM to SRAM.

An alternative memory ready for use is [[ferroelectric RAM]] (FRAM or FeRAM). FeRAM adds a small amount of a ferro-electric material to a DRAM cell. The state of the field in the material encodes the bit in a non-destructive format. FeRAM has advantages of NRAM, although the smallest possible cell size is much larger than for NRAM. FeRAM is used in applications where the limited number of writes of flash is an issue. FeRAM read operations are destructive, requiring a restoring write operation afterwards.

Other more speculative memory systems include [[magnetoresistive random-access memory]] (MRAM) and [[phase-change memory]] (PRAM). MRAM is based on a grid of [[magnetic tunnel junctions]]. MRAM's  reads the memory using the [[tunnel magnetoresistance]] effect, allowing it to read the memory both non-destructively and with very little power. Early MRAM used field induced writing,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.everspin.com/file/214/download&lt;/ref&gt; reached a limit in terms of size, which kept it much larger than flash devices.  However, new MRAM techniques might overcome the size limitation to make MRAM competitive even with flash memory.  The techniques are [[Thermal Assisted Switching]] (TAS),&lt;ref&gt;The Emergence of Practical MRAM {{cite web |url=http://www.crocus-technology.com/pdf/BH%20GSA%20Article.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427022729/http://www.crocus-technology.com/pdf/BH%20GSA%20Article.pdf |archivedate=2011-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; developed by [[Crocus Technology]], and [[Spin-transfer torque]] on which Crocus, [[Hynix]], [[IBM]], and other companies were working in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Tower invests in Crocus, tips MRAM foundry deal |author= Mark LaPedus |date= June 18, 2009 |work= EE Times |url= http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1171188 |accessdate= July 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

PRAM is based on a technology similar to that in a writable CD or DVD, using a phase-change material that changes its magnetic or electrical properties instead of its optical ones. The PRAM material itself is scalable but requires a larger current source.

==History==
Nantero was founded in 2001, and headquartered in [[Woburn, Massachusetts]].
Due to the massive investment in flash [[semiconductor fabrication plant]]s, no alternative memory has replaced flash in the marketplace, despite predictions as early as 2003 of the impending speed and density of NRAM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= A new type of computer memory uses carbon, rather than silicon |date= May 8, 2003 |work= The Economist |url= http://www.economist.com/node/1763552 |accessdate= July 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=On ultra-fast carbon memory: Nanotube |work= The Register |date=May 13, 2003 |author=John Leyden |url= https://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/05/13/on_ultrafast_carbon_memory/  |accessdate= July 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pavegen Systems''' is a technology company that has developed paving slabs to convert energy from people's footsteps into small amounts of electrical power.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/10/13/tech/innovation/pavegen-kinetic-pavements/index.html|accessdate=14 October 2011|newspaper=[[CNN International]]|date=13 October 2011|title=Green sidewalk makes electricity -- one footstep at a time|first=George|last=Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Pavegen Systems was founded in 2009 by [[Laurence Kemball-Cook]].  Cook, a graduate in Industrial Technology and Design from [[Loughborough University]], took on a university placement with [[E.ON]], and proposed using footfall as a potential power source.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nationalobserver.com/2016/06/13/news/see-futuristic-flooring-lights-city-through-kinetic-energy-harvesting "See the futuristic flooring that lights up a city through kinetic energy harvesting"]. ''National Observer'', By Charles Mandel | June 13th 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of the first prototype of the Pavegen flooring tile was funded by a Royal Society of Arts International Design Directions prize. The tile that converts [[kinetic energy]] from footsteps into electricity, while collecting data about walking traffic patterns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niagarafallsreview.ca/2016/01/22/six-inventions-that-are-cooler-than-sci-fi "Six inventions that are cooler than sci-fi"]. ''Niagara Falls Review'', Craig and Marc Kielberger. January 23, 2016 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://metro.co.uk/2016/01/19/akon-and-shell-create-africas-first-human-and-solar-powered-football-pitch-5632012/ "Akon and Shell create Africaâs first human and solar powered football pitch"]. ''Metro'', Lee Thomas-Mason  19 Jan 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.360nobs.com/2016/01/akon-and-shell-partner-to-create-humansolar-powered-football-fields/ "Akon and Shell Partner To Create Human/Solar Powered Football Fields"]. ''360nobs'', January 20, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first generation tile was made from recycled polymer, with the top surface made from recycled truck tires. Power is generated when a footfall compresses the slab by about {{Convert|5|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}. The exact technology is a [[Trade secret|secret]], but PaveGen officials have said it involves electromagnetic induction by copper coils and magnets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/pavement-pounders-at-paris-marathon-generate-power/|title=Energy-Harvesting Street Tiles Generate Power from Pavement Pounder|date=20 April 2013|website=[[Sci.

An improved tile was developed in 2016 which, according to the company, improved energy conversion by 'about 20 times'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.co.uk/article/pavegen-tile-power-generation-london "Pavegen's power-generating floor is coming to Oxford Street"]. ''Wired'', By Rowland Manthorpe. 11 May 2016 &lt;/ref&gt; The amount of energy generated has been criticised, with one calculation claiming that walking for 4 hours on PaveGen paving would generate 0.02% of the average European's energy needs.&lt;ref name=page&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/05/26/pavegen_the_company_that_cant_make_energy_out_of_crowds_tries_to_make_money_out_of_them/?page=2 "Pavegen: The Company that can't make energy out of crowds tries to make money out of them"]. ''The Register'', 26 May 2015. Lewis Page&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the technology's strength rests in its ability to track volume and direction of traffic flow, thus providing useful metrics in a range of scenarios.&lt;ref name=page /&gt;

Among other installations, the slabs have been laid at London's [[West Ham]] [[Underground station]] for the [[2012 Olympic Games]].&lt;ref name=energylivenews&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.energylivenews.com/2012/07/11/foot-power-lights-up-olympic-walkway/|accessdate=13 July 2012|website=energylivenews|date=13 July 2012|title=Foot power lights up Olympic walkway|first=Vicky |last=Ellis}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2013, a demonstration installation with [[Schneider Electric]] harvested energy from the runners in the [[Paris Marathon]].&lt;ref name=SA42013&gt;{{cite news|title=Energy-Harvesting Street Tiles Generate Power from Pavement Pounder|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=pavement-pounders-at-paris-marathon-generate-power|accessdate=2013-04-22|newspaper=Scientific American|date=April 20, 2013|author=Dhananjay Khadilkar}}&lt;/ref&gt;
PaveGen has also put these tiles on a public soccer field in Rio de Janeiro to allow play after sunset.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jan/11/floor-tile-generates-power-from-footsteps-energy-electricity-startup "The floor tiles that use foot power to light up cities "]. ''The Guardian'',  Killian Fox. 11 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of a central building at [[Macquarie University]] in [[Sydney, Australia]], suggested that if pavers covered the 3.1% of the floor that sees the most foot traffic, it would generate an estimated 1.1 megawatt-hour per year, about 0.5% of the building's energy needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Xiaofeng|last2=Strezov|first2=Vladimir|title=Modelling piezoelectric energy harvesting potential in an educational building|journal=Energy Conversion and Management|volume=85|pages=435â442|doi=10.1016/j.enconman.2014.05.096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distributors==
PaveGen have distributors in Australia, New Zealand, Korea, Singapore, Thailand, Portugal, India and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pavegen.com/contact/distributors&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The Register points out that this device generates only "tiny, pointless amounts of energy". 
&lt;ref name="page"/&gt;. This borne out by an [http://www.imeche.org/news/news-article/pavegen-kinetic-technology-powers-christmas-lights article] published by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in which the output from 54,267 steps on a Pavegen system is shown to have generated 217,028 watt-seconds, a mere 0.06 kWh.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15057">'''Phased adoption''' is a strategy of implementing an innovation (i.e., [[information system]]s, new technologies, processes, etc.) in an organization in a phased way, so that different parts of the organization are implemented in different subsequent time slots. Other concepts that are used are: phased implementation, phased conversion, phased approach, phased strategy, phased introduction and staged conversion.

== Overview ==

Information Technology has revolutionized the way of working in organizations (Eason, 1988). With the introduction of high-tech [[Enterprise Resource Planning]] Systems (ERP), [[Content Management System]]s (CMS), [[Customer Relationship Management|Customer]] and [[Supplier Relationship Management]] Systems (CRM and SRM), came the task to implement these systems in the organizations that are about to use it. The following entry will discuss just a small fraction of what has to be done or can be done when implementing such a system in the organization.

The phased approach takes the conversion one step at a time. The implementation requires a thoroughly thought out scenario for starting to use the new system. And at every milestone one has to instruct the employees and other users. The old system is taken over by the new system in predefined steps until it is totally abounded. The actual installation of the new system will be done in several ways, per module or per product and several instances can be carried out. This may be done by introducing some of the functionalities of the system before the rest or by introducing some functionalities to certain users before introducing them to all the users. This gives the users the time to cope with the changes caused by the system.

It is common to organize an implementation team that moves from department to department. By moving, the team learns and so gains expertise and knowledge, so that each subsequent implementation will be a lot faster than the first one.

== The Process Data Diagram ==
[[File:Phased adoption process.gif|thumb|200px|Figure 1: Phased adoption process]]

The visualising technique used in this entry is a technique developed by the O&amp;I group of the [[University of Utrecht]] (Weerd, 2005). The technique is described in the following Wiki: [[Meta-modeling technique]].

As can be seen in figure 1, phased adoption has a loop in it. Every department that is to be connected to the system is going through the same process. First based on the previous training sessions security levels are set (see [[Information Technology Infrastructure Library|ITIL]]) In this way every unique user has its own profile which describes, which parts of the system are visible and/or usable to that specific user. Then the document and policies are documented. All processes and procedures are described in process descriptions, can be in paper or on the intranet. Then the actual conversion is depicted. As described in the above text, certain departments and or parts of an organization may be implemented in different time slots. In figure 1 that is depicted by implementing an additional module or even a total product. HRM needs different modules of an ERP system than Finance (module) or Finance may need an additional accounting software package (Product). Tuning of the system occurs to solve existing problems. After the certain department has been conversed the loop starts over, and another department or user group may be conversed. If all of the departments or organization parts are conversed and the system is totally implemented the system is officially delivered to the organization and the implementation team may be dissolved.

Phased adoption makes it possible to introduce modules that are ready whilst programming the other future modules. This does make the implementation scenario more critical, since certain modules depend on one another. Project Management techniques can be adopted to tackle these problems. See the techniques section below.

However, the actual adoption of the system by the users can be more problematic. The system may work just fine but if it is not used itâs worthless. Users base their attitude towards the system on their first experience (Eason, 1988). As this creates an extra weight on the first interaction, the implementers should be concerned with making the first interaction especially a pleasant one.

In the technique used in this entry each CONCEPT requires a proper definition which is preferably copied from a standard glossary of which the source is given, if applicable. All CONCEPT names in the text are with capital characters. In Table 1 the concept definition list is presented.

== Advantages, disadvantages and risks of Phased Adoption ==

The Phased adoption method has certain pros, cons and risks (Koop, R., Rooimans, R. &amp; Theye, M. de (2003), Eason (1988))

Pros:

* The conversion will be done in parts. Time is available for adjustments
* Negative influences that arise at the start are less critical
* No âcatch-upâ period is needed.
* Time for the users to adapt is longer
* Technical staff can concentrate on part of the system or some of the users.

Cons:

* Several adjustments are needed
* Training sessions are confusing for users as they are asked to work with the new and the old system
* Several changes in documentation
* The duration of the project
* System delivery milestone is unclear
* Correctness and completeness of the dataset has to be checked several times
* A âfall backâ to the old system is becoming more difficult every new phase.
* The implementation may appear unclear to the employees and other users.

Risks:

* Complexity of the implementation
* Prone to make mistakes
* Fall back impossible in later phases

== Hardware and software installation ==
[[File:Hardsoft ware.gif|thumb|200px|Figure 3: Hardware and software installation]]
''The following sections are supplemental to the entry about [[adoption (software implementation)]] and are specific to phased adoption:''

The configuration and specification of the hardware in place used by the legacy system and to run the new system is delivered in the hardware specifications. The hardware configuration is tested to assure proper functioning. This is reported in the hardware configuration report.
The configuration and specification of the software in place, i.e., the legacy system and the future new system is made clear to assure proper functioning once the system is installed. The act of specifying the system already installed is key to the implementation. Which parts or even total systems will be taken over by the new system? All this is reported in the software installation and software test reports.
The actual installation of the software of the new system is also done here in a confined area to support the training sessions described in the following section.

== Training ==
[[File:Training.gif|thumb|200px|Figure 4: Training Process]]

The system training will teach users the keystrokes and transactions required to run the system (Umble, 2003) . The pilot exercises the systems and tests the users understanding of the system. The project team creates a skeletal business case test environment which takes the business processes from the beginning, when a customer order is received, to the end, when the customer order is shipped.
Training as such is not enough for adopting an information system. The users have learning needs (Eason, 1988). Known learning needs are the emotional guidance. Users need to make emotional steps in order to make cognitive
steps. If they fear the system due to its difficult handling they may not be able to understand the cognitive steps needed to successfully carry out the tasks.

== Techniques ==

In the implementation field several techniques are used. A well-known method, and specifically oriented on the implementation field, is the Regatta method by [[Sogeti]]. Other techniques are the SAP Implementation method, which is adapted to implementing [[SAP AG|SAP]] systems. Systems are installed in several different ways. Different organizations may have their own methods, When implementing a system, it is considered a project and thus must be handled as such. Well known theories and methods are used in the field such as the [[PRINCE2]] method with all of its underlying techniques, such as a [[PERT]] diagram, [[Gantt chart]] and [[critical path method]]s.

== Example ==

The EMR implementation at the [[University Physicians Group]] (UPG) in [[Staten Island]] and [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

The University Physicians Group in New York went with a complete technical installation of an EMR (Electronic Medical Record) software package. The UPG found that some vendors of the EMR package recommended a rolling out that would be done all-at-one, also called the Big Bang. But they found out that the Big Bang would have overwhelmed the physicians and staff due to the following factors:

* Ongoing workload during the key lessons prevented them to fully pay attention.
* Urgent need to complete some records caused the users to fall back to the old system
* Information overload on the physicians side.
* No time to play around with the system.
* 100% availability was not assured by the vendor.

Thus they chose a phased approach: â''Hence, a phased adoption to us, offered the greatest chance of success, staff adoption, and opportunity for the expected return-on-investment once the system was completely adopted.''â (J. Hyman, M.D.)

There also was a group who were somewhat reluctant about any new systems. By introducing the system to certain early adopters (Rogers, 1995) the late majority would be able to get to know the system. As it was introduced phased through the organisation. Per loop (see figure 5, A) the UPG was introduced to the system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4467">'''Plastic bending''' &lt;ref&gt;Stephen P. Timoshenko, Strength of Materials, Part II, 2nd ed., 1941, Ch VIII, p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt; is a nonlinear behavior particular to members made of [[ductile]] materials that frequently achieve
[[File:Plastic Bending Stress Distribution of a Beam.png|right|Plastic Bending Stress Distribution|350x350px]]
much greater ultimate bending strength than indicated by a linear elastic bending analysis. In both the plastic and
elastic bending analyses of a straight beam, it is assumed that the strain distribution is linear about the neutral
axis (plane sections remain plane). In an elastic analysis this assumption leads to a linear stress distribution but
in a plastic analysis the resulting stress distribution is nonlinear and is dependent on the beamâs material.

The limiting '''plastic bending''' strength &lt;math&gt; M_r &lt;/math&gt; (see [[Plastic moment]]) can generally be thought of as an upper limit to a beamâs loadâcarrying capability as it only represents the strength at a particular crossâsection and not the loadâcarrying capability of the overall beam. A beam may fail due to global or local instability before &lt;math&gt; M_r &lt;/math&gt; is reached at any point on its length. Therefore, beams should also be checked for local buckling, local crippling, and global lateralâtorsional buckling modes of failure.

'''Note''' that the deflections necessary to develop the stresses indicated in a plastic analysis are generally excessive, frequently to the point of incompatibility with the function of the structure. Therefore, separate analysis may be required to ensure design deflection limits are not exceeded. Also, since working materials into the plastic range can lead to permanent deformation of the structure, additional analyses may be required at limit load to ensure no detrimental permanent deformations occur. The large deflections and stiffness changes usually associated with plastic bending can significantly change the internal load distribution, particularly in statically indeterminate beams. The internal load distribution associated with the deformed shape and stiffness should be used for calculations.

'''Plastic bending''' begins when an applied moment causes the outside fibers of a cross-section to exceed the material's yield strength. Loaded only by a moment, the peak bending [[Stress (physics)|stress]]es occurs at the outside fibers of a cross-section.  The cross-section will not yield linearly through the section. Rather, outside regions will yield first, redistributing stress and delaying failure beyond what would be predicted by elastic analytical methods. The stress distribution from the [[neutral axis]] is the same as the shape of the stress-strain curve of the material (this assumes a non-composite cross-section). After a cross-section reaches a sufficiently high condition of plastic bending, it acts as a [[Plastic hinge]].

Elementary Elastic Bending theory requires that the bending stress varies linearly with distance from the [[neutral axis]], but plastic bending shows a more accurate and complex stress distribution. The yielded areas of the cross-section will vary somewhere between the yield and ultimate strength of the material. In the elastic region of the cross-section, the stress distribution varies linearly from the neutral axis to the beginning of the yielded area. Predicted failure occurs when the stress distribution approximates the material's stress-strain curve.  The largest value being that of the ultimate strength.  Not every area of the cross-section will have exceeded the yield strength. 

As in the basic Elastic Bending theory, the [[moment (physics)|moment]] at any section is equal to an [[area integral]] of bending stress across the cross-section. From this and the above additional assumptions, predictions of deflections and failure [[strength of materials|strength]] are made.

Plastic theory was validated at the beginning of the last century by C. v. Bach.&lt;ref&gt;Bach, C. and Baumann, R.,  ''Elastizitat und Festigkeit'', 9th ed., 1908.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1503">'''Production tubing''' is a tube used in a wellbore through which [[production fluid]]s are produced (travel).

==Background==
Production tubing is run into the drilled well after the [[casing (oil well)|casing]] is run and cemented in place.  Production tubing protects wellbore casing from wear, tear, corrosion, and deposition of by-products, such as sand / silt, paraffins, and [[asphaltenes]]. Along with other components that constitute the [[production string]], it provides a continuous bore from the [[production zone]] to the [[wellhead]] through which [[oil]] and [[gas]] can be produced. It is usually between five and ten centimeters in diameter and is held inside the casing through the use of expandable packing devices. Purpose and design of production tubing is to enable quick, efficient, and safe installation, removal and re-installation. 

If there is more than one zone of production in the well, up to four lines of production tubing can be run.

[[Image:Revox logo.svg|thumb|ReVox corporate logo]]
'''ReVox''' is a brand name, registered by [[Studer]] on March 27, 1951, for [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[audio equipment]].&lt;ref name=Revox1948to1979&gt;{{cite book|title=Revox 1948-1979: From prototype to world exports.|date=1979|publisher=Willi Studer Fabrik fur elektronische Apparate|location=Regensdorf|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Studer-designed tape recorders were branded Dynavox. After the first production series of Dynavox recorders, a new marketing company was formed in 1950 called ELA AG. Revox was adopted as the brand name for amateur recorders, while the professional machines retained the Studer name.&lt;ref name="Revox1948to1979" /&gt;

The first Revox-branded tape recorder was the T26, in 1952, successor to the Dynavox 100.

The T26 was also made available as a radio-recorder combination unit. 2500 T26 recorders were made, priced at 1395.00 [[Swiss franc]]s.&lt;ref name="Revox1948to1979" /&gt;

The A36, the first 36 series recorder. became available in 1954. Unusual features for the time were pushbutton [[solenoid]] [[Tape transport|transport]] operations and a direct-drive [[Capstan (tape recorder)|capstan]] with no belts or idler wheels.
The B36 of 1956 was the first 3-head model, the D36 of 1960 was the first stereo model.

The company moved to [[LÃ¶ffingen]], [[West Germany]], in 1966, due to labour issues in Switzerland. But the building of a second factory was started in [[Regensdorf]], Switzerland in 1967 - to open in 1968.&lt;ref name="Revox1948to1979" /&gt;

In 1967 the 36-series tape recorders ended with the G36, and were superseded by the transistorised A77 with a servo-controlled direct drive capstan. Over 80,000 36-series recorders had been manufactured. The A77 was complemented by an integrated amplifier (A78) and FM tuner (A76). The start of the 1980s saw the introduction of the "B7xx" series of high fidelity components, which was in turn replaced by the B2xx series in the mid 1980s. The B2xx series was versatile (the B250 amplifier offering 10 signal inputs, each with automatic sensitivity calibration) and feature-rich, all components containing microprocessors. Contrastingly, the "H" line, with "H" standing for Human, went to the opposite extreme, with minimalist control interfaces: several "H" components having only three buttons.

In 1990 Willi Studer sold the Studer Revox Group to Motor-Columbus AG, including all subsidiary companies. In 1991, Motor-Columbus split the Studer Revox Group into Studer (Pro), Revox (HiFi) and a Manufacturing-division. Motor-Columbus sold several subsidiaries and plants.

The extensive reorganization culminated in the sale of the Studer Group to Harman International Inc., in March 1994. The Revox Group was excluded and sold to private investors. On March 17, 1994, Harman International Industries completed its acquisition and acquired from Motor-Columbus AG 100% of Studer Revox AG. Harman paid 100 Swiss Francs (approximately US $70.00) for all of the issued and outstanding stock in Studer Revox. Harman assumed post-acquisition indebtedness of Studer Revox of approximately 23 million Swiss Francs (approximately US $16 million).&lt;ref name="Harmanreport"&gt;{{cite web|title=Securities and Exchange Commission, Washington, D.C., 20549 â form 8-K/A â Current Report|url=http://investor.harman.com/secfiling.cfm?filingid=800459-94-9&amp;cik=800459|website=Harman Intl - Amended Current Report:|publisher=Harman International Industries, Incorporated}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The founder of Revox, Willi Studer, died on March 1, 1996.&lt;ref name="JourAES_55_4"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Siegenthaler|first1=Marcel|title=In Memoriam: Willi Studer|journal=Journal of the Audio Engineering Society|volume=55|issue=5|page=435|url=http://www.aes.org/aeshc/docs/jaes.obit/JAES_V44_5_PG435.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company logo is the word "REVOX" in capitals, with a "V" larger than the other letters; when printed in fixed-size type, the mixed-case spelling "ReVox" is sometimes used, but in all older and most newer references the name is shown as "Revox".

[[Image:Revox-reel-to-reel.JPG|thumb|right|Revox PR99 Mk II, a 1/4 inch tape recorder. Produced from about 1985.]]
Many consider ReVox [[open-reel]] tape recorders to be [[high-end audio]] equipment. The most famous of these are the G36 (valve type), A77 (solid state with [[relay]] controls) and B77 (solid state with logic control and direct-drive). The A700 was the top of the line 1970s machine with 3-speed quartz PLL capstan, or, like the B77 which appeared in 1979, variable tape speed from 2.5 to 22.5&amp;nbsp;inches per second. Pictured to the right is the PR99 Mk2, a variant of the B77 for professional users, differing from the B77 in having balanced line in/out, and a real-time counter and auto-locator. The PR99 series was superseded by the C270 series, available also in multi-track formats (C274, C278).

Revox also produced well-regarded cassette tape recorders, notably the B710 and later the B215, which used the same transport and substantially the same electronics as the more expensive Studer A710 and Studer A721, respectively. It is worth noting that the Revox H11 and C115 cassette recorders are not true Revox or Studer products, but rebadged Philips Model FC60. As such, they do not meet the exacting performance standards of the B710, B215 and H1 which are Studer designed and built.

In the same fashion, the Revox B225 and B226 compact disc players were very heavily based on the Studer  A725 and A727 professional CD players.
Likewise, the Revox FM tuners were almost identical to the Studer professional models. A limited run of the B226 CD player was issued to celebrate Studer's 40th anniversary. Dubbed 'The Signature', it featured a black [[faceplate (housing)|faceplate]] (in contrast to the then silver (anodized aluminium) B226) and used the high performance Silver Crown version of the Philips TDA1541 DAC, which later featured in non-Signature B226-S versions.

Revox was one of the first manufacturers to market a plasma television set, the model E542 in 1999. Before that, they commissioned Loewe to manufacture a limited number of models of S-VHS and VHS video cassette recorders and CRT television sets branded with the Revox name. A DVD player bearing the Revox name (model S27) was built by the French company Micromega.

== Current technology ==

In 2002, Revox introduced with the Re:system M51 a modular audio video system in the market. This system can provide up to 32 rooms in 4 different listening zones with music. Different modules allow the user to select which sources he would like to use in his home, available sources (modules) for the M51 and M10 are amongst others FM-tuner, SAT-radio, Internet-radio, Multiroom, Audio server and also Audio streams. Solutions are available for all imaginable application possibilities up to the control via Apple products with the corresponding Apps. The operation of Multiroom require the availability of  the corresponding Multiroom module and small amplifiers of the type M219 in the remote rooms. Also the first audio server of the company, the Revox M57, was perfectly in line with the Multiroom concept.

The M51 MKII is available with two different amplifiers. The analogue version performs 5 x 60 Watt sinus, the digital Class-D-amplifier 5 x 200 Watt sinus.

The M-series was extended in 2006 by the M10, a 19â rack solution as central nerve and source centre and in 2010 by the M100, an audiophile Hifi-stereo amplifier with 2 x 200 Watt sinus power, FM-tuner and DVD-drive in an extremely compact housing. For the models M10 and M51, the latter is currently available in version MKII, the insertable modules are identical. For the M100 the modules, except for Multiroom, are offered as pluggable supplementations to the basic model.

In the Multiroom operation the control of the rooms is effected by wall control units of the type M217/M218, by the remote controls M207 or M208 or by Apps, which are momentarily only available for the iOS-operating system.

In addition to the pure Audio server M37 MKII the Multimedia server M117 was introduced in 2011. In 2012 Revox presented the new audiophile network receivers Revox Joy S120, S119 and S118.

The workmanship of the devices is typically for Revox on a very high level and is characterised by the selection of precious materials like aluminium and glass.

== Reel to reel revived ==
As of May 2016, Revox announced the re-introduction of a reel-to-reel tape player, to be released in the first quarter of 2017. Manufactured and developed in conjunction with HORCH HOUSE (a division of Lutz Precision k.s.), it will initially be a playback-only machine, with a recorder/reproducer to follow.&lt;ref name="Horch"&gt;{{cite web|title=Project R2R|url=http://www.analogarts.net/project-r2r/|website=Horch House|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Loudspeakers ==

For more than 40 years, Revox has been producing loudspeakers. The first speaker of the brand Revox was the series 46 (1970), which was developed for the former HiFi system A77, A76 and A50. The AX- (1976), the BX- (1977) and the BR-series (1980) followed. All speakers were developed and manufactured in the Revox plant in Ewattingen / Black Forest.

Numerous other speakers went along with the company in the 1980s. The most famous speakers were the Symbol B (1983) as well as the first Revox active speaker Agora B (1986). A milestone in the speaker development was the two digital active speakers Scala 4.7 (1994) and Scala 3.6 (1996).
1980 also saw the introduction of the Triton, one of the first sub-woofer / satellite systems for home high fidelity. The Triton subwoofer comprised a 200&amp;nbsp;lb cabinet designed to also act as a piece of furniture on which the entire B7xx series (including B77) could stand.&lt;ref name="prospektus1980"&gt;{{cite book|title=Studer Revox 80 prospektus|publisher=Revox ELA AG Division Export|location=Regensdorf|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Triton system was superseded by the smaller and more compact Piccolo, and later the Power Cube, which was a Piccolo bass unit with built-in power amplifiers and optional remote control and multi-room controller.

In 1987, Revox acquired the rights to manufacture the Stereolith Duetto, a single-box stereo loudspeaker. Built in the shape of a triangular prism, the Duetto was designed to complement, in acoustics and appearance, the Piccolo bass unit (passive operation) or the Power Cube (active operation).

Todayâs Revox range includes a very comprehensive{{Clarify|date=December 2012}} speaker assortment. Classical three-way speakers such as the Prestige of the Re:sound G or Re:sound S series, medium and small speakers as well as a very comprehensive range of installation speakers, which come into operation especially in the multi-room field.

== In popular culture ==

In  ''[[Chaplin (film)]]'' (1992), a Revox machine is being used in Charles Chaplin's sessions with his biographer.

The film [[Diva (1981 film)|Diva]] (1981) features Revox B700 series components as playback equipment for the bootleg operatic recording of the diva.

[[Derren Brown]], in his TV Show [[Trick of the mind]], convinces [[Simon Pegg]] that his ideal birthday present would be a BMX bike, by having a Revox B77 tape recorder playing in the room, and suggesting that the visual image of such a machine subliminally suggests a bicycle. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTwCMX5sUQU Link to Video Clip]

In [[Deutschland 83]] (2015 TV series), Revox PR99 reel to reel recorders (among other brands) are used by East German authorities to covertly record Nato operations.

[[Robert Fripp]] used Revox machines to produce his [[Frippertronics]] recordings in the late 1970s onward, until he replaced the recorders with digital delays in the 1990s.

A '''sewing needle''' ,for hand-sewing, is a long slender tool with a pointed tip at one end and a hole (or ''eye'') at the other. The earliest needles were made of [[bone]] or [[wood]]; modern ones are manufactured from high [[carbon steel]] wire and are [[nickel]]- or [[gold|18K gold]]-plated for corrosion resistance. The highest quality embroidery needles are plated with two-thirds [[platinum]] and one-third [[titanium alloy]]. Traditionally, needles have been kept in needle books or [[needlecase]]s which have become objects of adornment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.collectorsweekly.com/sewing/needle-cases |title= Antique Sewing Needle Cases|publisher= Collectors Weekly |accessdate=2012-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sewing needles may also be kept in an [[Ã©tui]], a small box that held needles and other items such as scissors, pencils and tweezers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.collectorsweekly.com/sewing/needle-cases |title= Antique Sewing Needle Cases|publisher= Collectors Weekly |accessdate=2012-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of hand sewing needles==
[[File:Needles (for sewing).jpg|thumb|Needles used for hand sewing{{clarification needed|date=April 2018}}]]
[[File:Sewing needle eye with thread.jpg|thumb|Thread through the eye of a No.5 sharp needle]]
Hand sewing needles come in a variety of types/ classes designed according to their intended use and in a variety of sizes within each type.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sewing.org/files/guidelines/22_110_hand_sewing_needle_guide.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

*Sharp Needles: used for general hand sewing; built with a sharp point, a round eye, and are of medium length.  Those with a double-eyes are able to carry two strands of thread while minimizing fabric friction.
*[[AppliquÃ©]]: These are considered another all-purpose needle for sewing, appliquÃ©, and patch work.
*[[Embroidery]]: Also known as [[crewel embroidery|crewel]] needles; identical to sharps but have a longer eye to enable easier threading of multiple embroidery threads and thicker [[yarn]]s.
*Betweens or [[Quilting]]: These needles are shorter than sharps, with a small rounded eye and are used for making fine stitches on heavy fabrics such as in tailoring, [[quilt]] making and other detailed handwork; note that some manufacturers also distinguish between quilting needles and quilting ''between'' needles, the latter being slightly shorter and narrower than the former.
*Milliners: A class of needles generally longer than sharps, useful for [[Tack (sewing)|basting]] and [[pleat]]ing, normally used in [[Hatmaking|millinery]] work.
*Easy- or Self-threading: Also called calyxeyed sharps, side threading, and spiral eye needles, these needles have an open slot into which a thread may easily be guided rather than the usual closed eye design.
*[[Beading]]: These needles are very fine, with a narrow eye to enable them to fit through the centre of beads and sequins along with a long shaft to thread and hold a number of beads at a time.
*Bodkin: Also called ballpoints, this is a long, thick needle with a ballpoint end and a large, elongated eye. They can be flat or round and are generally used for threading elastic, ribbon or tape through casings and lace openings.
*[[Chenille fabric|Chenille]]: These are similar to [[Needlepoint|tapestry]] needles but with large, long eyes and a very sharp point to penetrate closely woven fabrics. Useful for [[ribbon]] embroidery.
*[[Darning]]: Sometimes called finishing needles, these are designed with a blunt tip and large eye making them similar to tapestry needles but longer; yarn darners are the heaviest sub-variety.
*[[Doll]]: Not designed for hand sewing at all, these needles are made long and thin and are used for soft sculpturing on dolls, particularly facial details.
*[[Leather]]:  Also known as glovers and as wedge needles, these have a triangular point designed to pierce leather without tearing it; often used on leather-like materials such as vinyl and plastic.
*Sailmaker: Similar to leather needles, but the triangular point extends further up the shaft; designed for sewing thick canvas or heavy leather.
*[[Tapestry]]: The large eye on these needles lets them to carry a heavier weight yarn than other needles, and their blunt tipâusually bent at a slight angle from the rest of the needleâallows them to pass through loosely woven fabric such as embroidery [[canvas]] or [[even-weave]] material without catching or tearing it; comes in a double-eyed version for use on a mounted frame and with two colors of thread. 
*[[Tatting]]: These are built long with an even thickness for their entire length, including at the eye, to enable thread to be pulled through the double stitches used in tatting.
*[[Upholstery]]:  These needles are heavy, long needles that may be straight or curved and are used for sewing heavy fabrics, upholstery work, tufting and for tying quilts; the curved variety is practical for difficult situations on furniture where a straight needle will not work Heavy duty 12" needles are used for repairing [[mattress]]es. Straight sizes: 3"-12" long, curved: 1.5"-6" long.

==Needle size==

Needle size is denoted by one or more numbers on the manufacturer's packet. The general convention for sizing of needles, like that of [[wire gauge]]s, is that within any given class of needle the length and thickness of a needle ''increases'' as the size number ''decreases''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Some Insight on Needles|url=http://www.pumpkinvinecorner.com/needleinfo.htm|website=www.pumpkinvinecorner.com|publisher=Pumpkinvine Corner|accessdate=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a size 9 needle will be thicker and longer than a size 12 needle. However, the needle sizes are not standardized and so a size 10 of one class may be (and in some cases actually is) either thinner or finer than a size 12 of another type. Where a packet contains a needle count followed by two size numbers such as "20 Sharps 5/10" the second set of numbers correspond to the range of sizes of needle within the packet, in this case typically ten sharps needles of size 5 and ten of size 10 (for a total of 20 needles).  As another example, a packet labeled "16 Milliners 3/9" would contain 16 milliners needles ranging in sizes from 3 to 9.

==History==

===Prehistoric sewing needles===

[[File:Aiguille os 246.1 Global.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|alt=|&lt;Center&gt; [[Magdalenian]], [[Gourdan-Polignan]] France - [[:fr:MusÃ©um de Toulouse|MusÃ©um of Toulouse]]&lt;/center&gt;]]

===Ancient sewing needles===
[[File:Tibet.needlecase.JPG|thumb|Tibetan needle-case]]

A form of needle lace named [[nÃ¥lebinding]] seems to generally predate knitting and crochet by thousands of years, partly because it can use far shorter rough-graded threads than knitting does.

[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] were known to use sewing needles from natural sources. One such source, the [[agave]] plant, provided both the needle and the "thread." The agave leaf would be soaked for an extended period of time, leaving a pulp, long, stringy fibres and a sharp tip connecting the ends of the fibres. The "needle" is essentially what was the tip end of the leaf. Once the fibres dried, the fibres and "needle" could then be used to sew together for deer bones.

Sewing needles are an application of wire-making technology, which started to appear in the second millennium B.C. Some fine examples of Bronze Age gold torques are made of very consistent gold wire, which is more malleable than bronze. However, copper and bronze needles do not need to be as long: the eye can be made by turning the wire back on itself and [[Drawing (manufacturing)|redrawing]] it through the [[Die (manufacturing)|die]].

===Later sewing needles===
[[File:MODOHirsch.jpg|thumb|Metal container for sewing needles from the second half of the 20th century. From the [[Museo del Objeto del Objeto]] collection]]

The next major break-through in needle-making was the arrival of high-quality [[Steel|steel-making]] technology from China in the tenth century, principally in Spain in the form of the [[Blast furnace#Catalan_forges|Catalan furnace]], which soon extended to produce reasonably high quality steel in significant volumes. This technology later extended to Germany and France, although not significantly in England. England began creating needles in 1639 at [[Redditch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.redditch.com/history.html|website=Redditch.com|accessdate=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating the drawn-wire technique still in common use today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Needles Are Made|url=http://www.jjneedles.com/pages.php?pageid=8|website=www.jjneedles.com|publisher=John James Needles}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 1655, needle manufacturers were sufficiently independent to establish a Guild of Needlemakers in London, although Redditch remained the principal place of manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kirkup|first1=J|title=The history and evolution of surgical instruments.

A '''smart TV''' is a traditional [[television set]] with integrated [[Internet]] and interactive "[[Web 2.0]]" features which allows you to stream music and videos, browse the internet, and view photos. Smart TV is a [[technological convergence]] between computers and [[flatscreen television]] sets and [[set-top box]]es. Besides the traditional functions of television sets and set-top boxes provided through traditional [[broadcasting]] media, these devices can also provide [[Internet TV]], online [[interactive media]], [[over-the-top content]] (OTT), as well as [[video on demand|on-demand]] [[streaming media]], and [[home network]]ing access.&lt;ref name="businessinsider1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Steve Kovach | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-a-smart-tv-2010-12 |title=What Is A Smart TV? |publisher=Businessinsider.com |date=December 8, 2010|accessdate=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeremy Toeman 41 |url=http://mashable.com/2010/10/20/connected-tv-content-not-apps/ |title=Why Connected TVs Will Be About the Content, Not the Apps |publisher=Mashable.com |date=October 20, 2010 |accessdate=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/24/internet-tv-and-the-death-of-cable-tv-really/ |title=Internet TV and The Death of Cable TV, really |publisher=Techcrunch.com |date=October 24, 2010 |accessdate=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smart TV should not be confused with [[Internet TV]], [[IPTV]] or [[Web television]]. Internet TV refers to receiving television content over the Internet instead of traditional systems (terrestrial, cable and satellite) (although Internet itself is received by these methods). IPTV is one of the Internet television technology standards for use by television broadcasters. Web television is a term used for programs created by a wide variety of companies and individuals for broadcast on Internet TV.

In smart TVs, the operating system is preloaded or is available through the set-top box. The [[software application]]s or "apps" can be preloaded into the device, or updated or installed on demand via an [[application store|app store or marketplace]], in a similar manner to how the apps are integrated in modern [[smartphone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asianewsnet.net/home/news.php?id=13857 |title=Smart TV competition heats up market |publisher=Asianewsnet.net |accessdate=January 17, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407111651/http://www.asianewsnet.net/home/news.php?id=13857 |archivedate=April 7, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreaittimes.com/story/10855/smart-tv-shower-opens-smart-life |title=Smart TV Shower Opens Smart Life |publisher=Koreaittimes.com |date=October 7, 2010 |accessdate=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chacksfield |first=Marc |url=http://www.techradar.com/news/television/intel-smart-tv-revolution-biggest-since-move-to-colour--688832 |title=Intel: Smart TV revolution 'biggest since move to colour'&amp;nbsp;â The wonders of widgets? |publisher=Techradar.com |date=May 12, 2010 |accessdate=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/may2010/tc20100520_211952.htm |title=Google, With Intel and Sony, Unveils Software for 'Smart' TVs |work=Bloomberg BusinessWeek  |date=May 20, 2010 |accessdate=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Katzmaier |first=David |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20015791-1.html |title=Poll: Smart TV or dumb monitor? |publisher=News.cnet.com |date=September 8, 2010 |accessdate=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology that enables smart TVs is also incorporated in external devices such as set-top boxes and some [[Blu-ray]] players, [[game console]]s, [[digital media player]]s, [[hotel television systems]], smartphones, and other network-connected interactive devices that utilize television-type display outputs.&lt;ref name="intel1"&gt;[http://www.intel.com/inside/smarttv/ Intel and Smart TV]. intel.com.

==Definition==
[[File:SamsungSmartTV.JPG|thumb|Smart TVs on display]]
A ''smart TV'' device is either a television set with integrated Internet capabilities or a set-top box for television that offers more advanced computing ability and connectivity than a contemporary basic television set. Smart TVs may be thought of as an [[information appliance]] or the [[computer system]] from a [[handheld computer]] integrated within a television set unit, as such a smart TV often allows the user to install and run more advanced applications or [[Plug-in (computing)|plugins/addons]] based on a specific platform. Smart TVs run a complete [[operating system]] or [[mobile operating system]] software providing a platform for application developers.&lt;ref name="businessinsider1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wired1"&gt;{{cite news|author=&lt;!--start post navigation--&gt; Previous post Next post |url=https://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/09/android-holds-the-key-to-samsungs-smart-tv-plans/ |title=Android Holds the Key to Samsungâs Smart TV Plans |work=Wired  |date=September 7, 2010 |accessdate=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wired2"&gt;{{cite news|author=&lt;!--start post navigation--&gt; Previous post Next post |url=https://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/05/google-introduces-google-tv/ |title=Google Introduces Google TV, New Android OS |work=Wired  |date=May 20, 2010 |accessdate=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smart TV platforms or middleware have a public [[Software development kit]] (SDK) and/or [[Native development kit]] (NDK) for apps so that third-party developers can develop applications for it, and an [[Application store|app store]] so that the end-users can install and uninstall apps themselves. The public SDK enables third-party companies and other interactive application developers to âwriteâ applications once and see them [[write once, run anywhere|run successfully on any device]] that supports the smart TV platform or middleware architecture which it was written for, no matter who the hardware manufacturer is.

Smart TVs deliver content (such as photos, movies and music) from other computers or network attached storage devices on a network using either a [[Digital Living Network Alliance]] / [[Universal Plug and Play]] media server or similar service program like [[Windows Media Player]]  or [[Network-attached storage]] (NAS), or via [[iTunes]]. It also provides access to Internet-based services including traditional broadcast TV channels, [[Catch-up tv|catch-up services]], [[video-on-demand]] (VOD), [[electronic program guide]], interactive advertising, personalisation, voting, games, [[social networking]], and other multimedia applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/video/google-tv-apps/ |title=A first look at Google TVâs new apps |publisher=Gigaom.com |date=September 15, 2011 |accessdate=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smart TV enables access to movies, shows, video games, apps and more. Some of those apps include Netflix, [[Spotify]], YouTube, and Amazon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.samsung.com/us/experience/smart-tv/|title=Samsung Smart TV - TV Has Never Been This Smart|website=Samsung Electronics America|access-date=September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the early 1980s, "intelligent" television receivers were introduced in Japan. The addition of an [[Large-scale integration|LSI]] chip with memory and a character generator to a television receiver enabled Japanese viewers to receive a mix of programming and information transmitted over spare lines of the broadcast television signal.&lt;ref&gt;Gene Gregory (1985), ''Japanese Electronics Technology, Enterprise and Innovation'', page 351, [[Japan Times]]&lt;/ref&gt; A patent was published in 1994&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?FT=D&amp;date=19960510&amp;DB=EPODOC&amp;locale=en_EP&amp;CC=FR&amp;NR=2726670A1&amp;KC=A1&amp;ND=3 |title=espacenet&amp;nbsp;â Original document |publisher=Worldwide.espacenet.com |accessdate=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and extended the following year)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=US&amp;NR=5905521A&amp;KC=A&amp;FT=D&amp;ND=7&amp;date=19990518&amp;DB=EPODOC |title=espacenet&amp;nbsp;â Bibliographic data |publisher=Worldwide.espacenet.com |accessdate=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; for an "intelligent" television system, linked with data processing systems, by means of a digital or analog network. Apart from being linked to data networks, one key point is its ability to automatically download necessary software routines, according to a user's demand, and process their needs. 

The mass acceptance of digital television in late 2000s and early 2010s greatly improved smart TVs. Major TV manufacturers have announced production of smart TVs only, for their middle-end to high-end TVs in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/5/7497383/sony-new-smart-tv-run-android-tv-ces-2015|title=All of Sony's new smart TVs run on Android TV|author=Dieter Bohn|publisher=Vox Media|work=The Verge|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/24117/20150103/ces-2015-new-samsung-smart-tvs-will-be-powered-by-tizen-os.htm|title=CES 2015: New Samsung Smart TVs Will Be Powered by Tizen OS|work=Tech Times|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/lg-to-show-off-webos-2-0-smart-tv-at-ces-2015/|title=LG to show off webOS 2.0 smart TV at CES 2015|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CNET|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smart TVs are expected to become the dominant form of television by the late 2010s. At the beginning of 2016, Nielsen reported that 29 percent of those with incomes over $75,000 a year had a smart TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=CES 2016: Five Things to Watch|last=Winslow|first=George|work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|date=January 4, 2016|pages=10â14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typical features==

The number of households using [[Over-the-top content|over-the-top]] television services has rapidly increased over the years. In 2015, 52% of U.S. households subscribed to [[Netflix]], [[List of Amazon.com products and services|Amazon Prime]], or [[Hulu Plus]]; 43% of pay-TV subscribers also used Netflix, and 43% of adults used some streaming [[video on demand]] service at least monthly. Additionally, 19% of Netflix subscribers shared their subscription with people outside of their households. Ten percent of adults at the time showed interest in [[HBO Now]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/news/next-tv/56-us-homes-have-tv-connected-internet/390895|title=U.S. Connected-TV Penetration Passes 50% {{!}} Multichannel|website=www.multichannel.com|access-date=November 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
===Social networking===
{{See also|Social media and television}}
Some smart TV platforms come prepackaged, or can be optionally extended, with social networking technology capabilities. The addition of social networking synchronization to smart TV and HTPC platforms may provide an interaction with both on-screen content and other viewers than is currently available to most televisions, while simultaneously providing a much more cinematic experience of the content than is currently available with most computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc15.com/dpp/news/science_tech/tvs-get-smart-with-internet-access-in-2011 |title=TVs get smart with Internet access in 2011 |publisher=Abc15.com |date=August 23, 2010 |accessdate=January 17, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707072843/http://www.abc15.com/dpp/news/science_tech/tvs-get-smart-with-internet-access-in-2011 |archivedate=July 7, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advertising===
Some smart TV platforms also support [[interactive advertising]], [[addressable advertising]] with local advertising insertion and targeted advertising,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/01/15/sky-adsmart-targeted-advertising/|title=Sky's AdSmart brings targeted advertising to your TV|author=Daniel Cooper|publisher=AOL|work=Engadget|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other advanced advertising features such as [[ad telescoping]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iptvdictionary.com/IPTVDictionary-Ad-Telescoping-Definition.html|title=Ad Telescoping|publisher=|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; using [[video on demand|VOD]] and [[Digital video recorder|DVR]], enhanced TV for consumer [[Call to action (marketing)|call-to-action]] and [[audience measurement]] solutions for ad campaign effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nagra.com/dtv/company/newsroom/press-releases/article/?id=1195|title=Kudelski Group :: Notification|author=|date=|website=www.nagra.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nagra.com/media-center/press-releases/nagra-opentv-and-time-warner-cable-media-extend-advanced-advertising |title="NAGRA-OpenTV and Time Warner Cable Media Extend Advanced Advertising Partnership" March 5, 2012 - Cheseaux, Switzerland|publisher=|accessdate=September 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marketing and trading possibilities offered by Smart TVs are sometimes summarized by the term [[t-commerce]]. Taken together, this [[Duplex (telecommunications)|bidirectional]] data flow means that smart TVs can be and are used for [[surveillance|clandestine observation]] of the owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2513592/Is-TV-spying-YOU.html|title=Is your TV spying on YOU?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in sets that are not configured off-the-shelf to do so, default security measures are often weak and will allow hackers to easily break into the TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2013/08/02/samsung-smart-tv-hack/|title=Your Smart TV Could Be Hacked to Spy On You}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Security===
There is evidence that a smart TV is vulnerable to attacks. Some serious [[internet security|security]] bugs have been discovered, and some successful attempts to run [[malware|malicious code]] to get unauthorized access were documented on video. There is evidence that it is possible to gain [[Superuser|root access]] to the device, install malicious software, access and modify configuration information for a [[remote control]], remotely access and modify files on TV and attached USB drives, access camera and microphone.&lt;ref name=NotSoSmart&gt;{{cite web|last1=Niemietz|title=Not so Smart: On Smart TV Apps|url=http://nds.rub.de/media/nds/veroeffentlichungen/2015/08/31/SmartTvAttacks.pdf|publisher=International Workshop on Secure Internet of Things|accessdate=September 15, 2015|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

There have also been concerns that [[hacker]]s may be able to remotely turn on the microphone or web-camera on a smart TV, being able to eavesdrop on private conversations. A common [[loop antenna]] may be set for a ''bi''directional transmission channel, capable of uploading data rather than only receiving. Since 2012, security researchers discovered a similar vulnerability present in more [[mass production|series]] of Smart Tvs, which allows hackers to get an external [[root access]] on the device&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.computerworld.com.au/article/444399/samsung_tv_vulnerability_could_let_hacker_change_channel/|title= Samsung TV vulnerability could let a hacker change the channel|date= Dec 12, 2015|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130306010836/https://www.computerworld.com.au/article/444399/samsung_tv_vulnerability_could_let_hacker_change_channel/|archive-date= March 6, 2013 |deadurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Anticipating growing demand for an [[antivirus]] for a smart TV, some [[security software]] companies are already working with partners in digital TV field on the solution. At this writing it seems like there is only one antivirus for smart TVs available: 'Neptune', a cloud-based antimalware system developed by Ocean Blue Software in partnership with [[Sophos]]. However, antivirus company [[Avira]] has joined forces with digital TV testing company Labwise to work on software to protect against potential attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.pctechbootcamp.com/can-your-smart-tv-get-a-virus/ | title=CAN YOUR SMART TV GET A VIRUS?}}&lt;/ref&gt; The privacy policy for [[Samsung|Samsung's]] Smart TVs has been called [[Orwellian]] (a reference to [[George Orwell]] and the dystopian world of constant surveillance he depicted in ''[[1984 (novel)|1984]]''), and compared to [[Telescreen]]s because of eavesdropping concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url= https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/samsungs-new-smart-tv-policy-allows-company-to-listen-in-on-users-10033012.html | title = Samsung smart TV policy allows company to listen in on users | work= The Independent | date = February 9, 2015 | accessdate = February 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-31296188 Not in front of the telly: Warning over &amp;#039;listening&amp;#039; TV] BBC News, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Hackers have misused Smart TV's abilities such as operating source codes for applications and its unsecured connection to the Internet. Passwords, IP address data, and credit card information can be accessed by hackers and even companies for advertisement. A company caught in the act is [[Vizio]].{{cn|date=January 2018}} The confidential documents, codenamed [[Vault 7]] and dated from 2013â2016, include details on [[CIA]]'s software capabilities, such as the ability to compromise smart TVs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/07/world/europe/wikileaks-cia-hacking.html |title=WikiLeaks Releases Trove of Alleged C.I.A.

===Restriction of access===
Internet websites can block smart TV access to content at will, or tailor the content that will be received by each platform.&lt;ref name="nytBlock"&gt;{{Cite news
| url = http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/21/big-networks-block-web-shows-from-google-tv/| title = Big Networks Block Web Shows From Google TV| date = October 21, 2010|work=New York Times| accessdate =December 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Google TV]]-enabled devices were blocked by [[NBC]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], and [[Hulu]] from accessing their Web content since the launch of Google TV in October 2010. Google TV devices were also blocked from accessing any programs offered by [[Viacom]]âs subsidiaries.&lt;ref name="cnetBlock"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20023547-1.html| title = Comedy Central, MTV now blocking Google TV| publisher = CNET.com| date = November 22, 2010| accessdate =December 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reliability===
High-end [[Samsung]] Smart TVs stopped working for at least seven days after a software update.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url= https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/aug/24/samsung-tv-buyers-furious-after-software-update-leaves-sets-unusable | title =  Samsung TV owners furious after software update leaves sets unusable | work= The Guardian | location = London | date = August 24, 2017 | accessdate = August 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Application providers are rarely upgrading Smart TV apps to the latest version; for example, Netflix does not support older TV versions with new Netflix upgrades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://devices.netflix.com/en/recommendedtv/2017/|title=Netflix Recommended TVs {{!}} Built for a better Netflix experience|website=devices.netflix.com|language=en|access-date=September 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Solar Decathlon]]''' is an initiative of the [[Department of Energy (United States)|Department of Energy of the United States]] (DOE) in which universities around the world compete with the design and construction of [[sustainable housing]] that works 100% with [[solar energy]]. It is called âDecathlon" since universities and their prototypes are evaluated in 10 criteria: architecture, engineering and construction, energy efficiency, energy consumption, comfort, sustainability, positioning, communications, urban design and feasibility and innovation.

[[Image:Merryweather.jpg|thumb|The Tempest Prognosticator]]
[[File:Tempest Prognosticator.jpg|thumb|Tempest Prognosticator]]
The '''tempest prognosticator''', also known as the '''leech barometer''', is a 19th-century invention by [[George Merryweather]] in which [[leech]]es are used in a [[barometer]].  The twelve leeches are kept in small bottles inside the device; when they become agitated by an approaching storm they attempt to climb out of the bottles and trigger a small hammer which strikes a bell.  The likelihood of a storm is indicated by the number of times the bell is struck.

==Invention and development==
Dr. Merryweather, honorary [[curator]] of the Whitby Literary and Philosophical Society's Museum, detailed the sensitivity that medicinal leeches displayed in reaction to electrical conditions in the atmosphere.  He was inspired by two lines from [[Edward Jenner]]'s poem ''Signs of Rain'': "The leech disturbed is newly risen; Quite to the summit of his prison."&lt;ref name="WDispatch"&gt;The Weekly Dispatch.  22 March 1851. "[http://www.magma.ca/~jdreid/leech.htm London: The Great Exhibition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011224020409/http://www.magma.ca/~jdreid/leech.htm |date=24 December 2001 }}".  Accessed 22 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Merryweather spent much of 1850 developing his ideas and came up with six designs for what he originally referred to as "An Atmospheric Electromagnetic Telegraph, conducted by Animal Instinct."  These ranged from a cheap version, which he envisaged would be used by the government and the shipping industries, to a more expensive design.  The expensive design, which took inspiration from the architecture of Indian temples, was made by local craftsmen and shown in the 1851 [[The Great Exhibition|Great Exhibition]] at [[The Crystal Palace]] in [[London]].&lt;ref name="VicWeb"&gt;Packer, Martin.  The [[Victorian Web]].  "[http://www.scholars.nus.edu.sg/landow/victorian/technology/packer/merryweather.html Dr. George Merryweatherâs 1851 Tempest Prognosticator] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517045232/http://www.scholars.nus.edu.sg/landow/victorian/technology/packer/merryweather.html |date=17 May 2008 }}."  Accessed 22 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 February 1851 he gave a nearly three-hour essay to members of the Philosophical Society entitled "Essay explanatory of the Tempest Prognosticator in the building of the Great Exhibition for the Works of Industry of All Nations."&lt;ref name="VicWeb" /&gt;

==Method==
The tempest prognosticator comprises twelve pint bottles in a circle around and beneath a large bell.  Atop the glasses are small metal tubes which contain a piece of [[whalebone]] and a wire connecting them to small hammers positioned to strike the bell.  In his essay Merryweather described the workings of the device:
{{cquote|After having arranged this mouse trap contrivance, into each bottle was poured rain water, to the height of an inch and a half; and a leech placed in every bottle, which was to be its future residence; and when influenced by the electromagnetic state of the atmosphere a number of leeches ascended into the tubes; in doing which they dislodged the whalebone and caused the bell to ring.|||George Merryweather|&lt;ref name="VicWeb" /&gt;}}

The leech would have difficulty entering the metal tubes but would endeavour to do so if sufficiently motivated by the likelihood of bad weather.&lt;ref name="WDispatch" /&gt;  By ringing the bell it would signify that that individual leech is indicating that a storm is approaching.  Merryweather referred to the leeches as his "jury of philosophical councilors"&lt;ref name="WDispatch" /&gt; and that the more of them that rang the bell the more likely that a storm would occur.

In his essay Merryweather also noted other features of the design, including the fact that the leeches were placed in glass bottles placed in a circle to prevent them from feeling "the affliction of solitary confinement".&lt;ref name="WDispatch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VicWeb" /&gt;

==Accuracy and success==
Merryweather spent all of 1850 testing the device, sending a letter to the president of the Philosophical Society and the Whitby Institute, Henry Belcher, to warn him of an impending storm.&lt;ref name="WDispatch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VicWeb" /&gt;  The results of 28 of these predictions are kept in the library of [[Whitby Museum]].&lt;ref name="WhitbyMuseum"&gt;Whitby Literary &amp; Philosophical Society.  9 July 2006.  "[http://www.whitbymuseum.org.uk/d12/misc/index.htm Miscellaneous Exhibits] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309175537/http://www.whitbymuseum.org.uk/d12/misc/index.htm |date=9 March 2007 }}" at Whitby Museum.  Accessed 22 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Merryweather stated in his essay the great success that he had had with the device.

Merryweather lobbied for the government to make use of his design around the British coastline but they instead opted for [[Robert FitzRoy]]'s [[storm glass]].&lt;ref name="VicWeb" /&gt;

==Replicas==
The original device has been lost, but at least three replicas have been made.  The hundredth anniversary of the invention brought renewed interest as a replica was made for the 1951 [[Festival of Britain]].  This non-working version was made from the description in a printed copy of Merryweather's essay and a [[intaglio printing|copperplate]] drawing of the original.  The device was shown in the [[Dome of Discovery]] and given to the Whitby Philosophical Society when the festival ended.  Plans and photographs of this replica were then used to create faithful working models, one at [[Barometer World]] near [[Okehampton]], Devon, and another at the Great Dickens Christmas Fair in [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref name="VicWeb" /&gt;

'''Tracing paper''' is paper made to have low [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]], allowing light to pass through. It was originally developed for architects and design engineers to create drawings which could be copied precisely using the [[diazo copy]] process;{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} it then found many other uses. The original use for drawing and tracing was largely superseded by technologies which do not require diazo copying or manual copying (by tracing) of drawings.

The transparency of the paper is achieved by careful selection of the raw materials and the process used to create transparency. [[Cellulose fiber|Cellulose fibre]] forms the basis of the paper, usually from wood species but also from cotton fibre. Often, paper contains other filler materials to enhance opacity and print quality. For tracing or translucent paper, it is necessary to remove any material which obstructs the transmission of light.&lt;ref name="A1020"&gt;[http://www.paperonweb.com/A1020.htm How is paper made translucent (grease proof, tracing paper)?] PaperOnWeb&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Tracing paper is paper made to have low [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]], allowing light to pass through. It is named as such for its ability for an [[image]] to be [[Copying|traced]] onto it. It was originally developed for architects and design engineers to create drawings which could be copied precisely using the [[diazo copy]] process;{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

When tracing paper is placed onto a [[picture]], the picture is easily visible through the paper. Thus, it becomes easy to find edges in the picture and trace the image onto the tracing paper. Pure [[cellulose]] [[fiber]] is [[translucent]], and it is the [[air]] trapped between fibers that makes paper [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] and look white.&lt;ref name="A1020" /&gt; If the fibers are refined and beaten until all the air is taken out, then the resulting [[Paper|sheet]] will be translucent. Translucent papers are [[Density|dense]] and contain up to 10% [[moisture]] at 50% [[humidity]].

== Production ==

Tracing paper is usually made from [[Sulfite process|sulfite]] [[Pulp (paper)|pulp]] by reducing the [[fibre]]s to a state of fine [[subdivision (paper)|subdivision]] and [[Hydrolysis|hydrolysing]] them by very prolonged beating in water.

There are three main processes to manufacture this type of paper, as follows:-

# Through mechanical ârefiningâ of the cellulose fibre to create a fibre which is highly fibrillated and gelatinous, so that in forming the sheet of paper, virtually all air is excluded from the internal structure of the paper. This method produces a very translucent and even looking paper over a range of grammages from 42 to over 280 gsm.
# By making a ânormalâ sheet of paper and then filling the spaces between the fibres with a material that has the same refractive index as the cellulose. This was a common process adopted in the USA. The product was frequently called Vellum, although this terminology can refer to a wider range of special papers. Due to the relatively high cost, this method of manufacture has largely disappeared.
# As with 2, by making a normal sheet of paper, which is followed by immersing uncut and unloaded paper of good [[Quality (business)|quality]] in [[sulfuric acid]] for a few [[second]]s. The [[acid]] converts some of the [[cellulose]] into [[amyloid]] form having a [[gelatinous]] and impermeable character. When the treated paper is thoroughly washed and dried, the resultant [[Product (business)|product]] is much [[Tensile strength|stronger]] than the original paper. Tracing paper is resistant to [[oil]], [[grease (lubricant)|grease]] and to a large extent impervious to [[water]] and [[gas]].

The [[sizing]] in production will determine whether it is for [[laser printer]] or [[inkjet]]/[[offset printing]].

Tracing paper may be uncoated or coated.{{explain|reason=With what is it coated?|date=December 2017}} Natural tracing paper for laser printing is usually uncoated.

The [[Harmonized System|HS]] code for tracing paper is 4806.30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wcoomd.org/en/topics/nomenclature/instrument-and-tools/hs_nomenclature_older_edition/~/media/18FE685D7E8E429996FC0F92A5DDB1C2.ashx|title=Paper and paperboard; articles of paper pulp, of paper or of paperboard|website=wcoomd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tracing paper can be recycled and also can be made from up to 30% recycled fibre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.arjowiggins-tracingpapers.com/faqs |title= Frequently Asked Questions {{!}} Arjoqiggins Creative Papers |work= arjowiggins-tracingpapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
'''User innovation''' refers to [[innovation]] by intermediate users (e.g. user [[firm]]s) or [[consumer]] users (individual [[end-user]]s or user [[communities]]), rather than by suppliers (producers or [[manufacturers]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bogers, M.; Afuah, A.; Bastian, B. (2010), "[http://www.marcelbogers.com/Pubs/Bogers-Afuah-Bastian_2010_JOM_Users-as-innovators.pdf Users as innovators: A review, critique, and future research directions]", Journal of Management, 36 (4): 857â875.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a concept closely aligned to [[co-design]], and has been proven to result in more innovative solutions than traditional consultation methodologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mitchell|first1=Val|last2=Ross|first2=Tracy|last3=Sims|first3=Ruth|last4=Parker|first4=Christopher J.|title=Empirical investigation of the impact of using co-design methods when generating proposals for sustainable travel solutions|journal=CoDesign||date=2015|volume=12|issue=4|pages=205-220|doi=10.1080/15710882.2015.1091894|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15710882.2015.1091894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eric von Hippel]]&lt;ref&gt;von Hippel, E. (1986). Lead Users: A Source of Novel Product Concepts. Management Science, 32(7), 791-805. {{doi|10.1287/mnsc.32.7.791}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others observed that many products and services are actually developed or at least refined, by users, at the site of implementation and use. These ideas are then moved back into the supply network.  This is because products are developed to meet the widest possible need; when individual users face problems that the majority of consumers do not, they have no choice but to develop their own modifications to existing products, or entirely new products, to solve their issues.  Often, user innovators will share their ideas with manufacturers in hopes of having them produce the product, a process called free revealing.

Based on research on the evolution of Internet technologies and open source software [[Ilkka Tuomi]] {{Harv|Tuomi|2002}} further highlighted the point that users are fundamentally social. User innovation, therefore, is also socially and socio-technically distributed innovation. According to Tuomi,&lt;ref&gt;Tuomi, I: ''Networks of Innovation'', chapter 2. Oxford University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; key uses are often unintended uses invented by user communities that reinterpret and reinvent the meaning of emerging technological opportunities.

The existence of user innovation, for example, by users of industrial robots, rather than the manufacturers of robots {{Harv|Fleck|1988}} is a core part of the argument against the Linear Innovation Model {{Harv|Williams|1996}} i.e. innovation comes from research and development, is then marketed and 'diffuses' to end-users. Instead innovation is a non-linear process involving innovations at all stages.

In 1986 Eric von Hippel introduced the [[lead user]] method that can be used to systematically learn about user innovation in order to apply it in [[new product development]]. In 2007 another specific type of user innovator, the [[creative consumer]] was introduced. These are consumers who adapt, modify, or transform a proprietary offering as opposed to creating completely new products.&lt;ref&gt;Berthon, PR.; Pitt, LF.; McCarthy I. and Kates, SB. (2007) "[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=959581 When customers get clever: Managerial approaches to dealing with creative consumers]", Business Horizons 50 (1), 39-47&lt;/ref&gt;

User innovation has a number of degrees: innovation of use, innovation in services, innovation in configuration of technologies, and finally the innovation of novel technologies themselves. While most user innovation is concentrated in use and configuration of existing products and technologies, and is a normal part of long term innovation, new technologies that are easier for end-users to change and innovate with, and new channels of communication are making it much easier for user innovation to occur and have an impact.

Recent research has focused on Web-based forums that facilitate user (or customer) innovation - referred to as [[virtual customer environment]], these forums help companies partner with their customers in various phases of product development as well as in other value creation activities. For example, [[Threadless]], a T-shirt manufacturing company, relies on the contribution of online community members in the design process. The community includes a group of volunteer designers who submit designs and vote on the designs of others. In addition to free exposure, designers are provided monetary incentives including a $2,500 base award as well as a percentage of T-shirt sales. These incentives allow Threadless to encourage continual user contribution.&lt;ref&gt;Magee,Joe. "[https://hbr.org/2008/10/the-contribution-revolution-letting-volunteers-build-your-business The Contribution Revolution: Letting Volunteers Build Your Business]", [[Harvard Business Review]], October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
ZOTAC was established in 2006 under the [[umbrella company]] of PC Partner. Its name was derived from the words "zone" and "tact". A year later, ZOTAC created its first ever video card, the ZOTAC [[GeForce 7 series|GeForce 7300 GT]].
