'''''A View of Religions''''' is an 18th-century comprehensive survey of world religions by the American author, [[Hannah Adams]]. First published in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] in 1784, it was a pioneering work in that it represented denominations from the perspective of their adherents, without imposing Adams' own preferences. The book was divided into sections and passed through several editions, which included minor changes in the name of the work. It was reprinted in England.{{sfn|Wilson|Fiske|1888|p=14}} ''A View of Religions'' was Adams' first and principal literary work. It was the result of her dissatisfaction with the prejudice of most writers on the various religious sects. She began thinking on the subject after reading a manuscript from [[Thomas Broughton (writer)|Thomas Broughton]]'s ''Historical Dictionary of all Religions from the Creation of the World to the Present Times'' (1742).{{sfn|Adams|1817|p=1}}

==Development==
[[File:Hannah Adams BostonAthenaeum.png|thumb|left|Hannah Adams]]
Until she was twenty years of age, Adams's reading had been limited mostly to works of imagination and feeling. She had never been directed to those of a controversial nature, nor to a study of the disputed points between the various sects. Her curiosity being awakened by a small manuscript from Broughton's ''Dictionary'', giving an account of some of the most common of the religious denominations, she began to read all she could find on the subject. At about the age of 30,{{sfn|Hart|1857|p=172}} becoming disgusted with the intolerance and lack of candor of the authors, she decided to write in a blank book what seemed to her to be the truth. In doing this she had no idea of publication. The work grew upon her hands and became known to her friends. Needing money, she was urged to publish it. But to find a printer to take it without immediate pay was the difficulty. She obtained 395 subscribers, 28 of whom were women, including Rev. [[Nathaniel Emmons]], [[Franklin, Massachusetts]] (six copies), Rev. [[Charles Chauncy (1705–1787)|Charles Chauncy]], D. D., Boston, Dr. [[James Manning (minister)|James Manning]], president of [[Rhode Island College]], [[Edmund Quincy (1703–1788) |Edmund Quincy]], Esq., Hon. Oliver Wendell, [[Nathaniel Appleton]], Esq., and [[Samuel Adams]], all of Boston.{{sfn|New England Magazine Company|1894|p=364-}} The hard study and close reflection were so difficult, that she was attacked before she finished it by a severe fit of illness, and threatened with derangement.{{sfn|Hart|1857|p=172}}

==1784 edition==
[[File:An alphabetical compendium of the various sects (1784).png|thumb|''An alphabetical compendium of the various sects'' (1784)]]
A bargain having been made with the printer, the book appeared in 1784. Its motto is, "Prove all things, hold fast that which is good." In the Advertisement at the beginning, the author says she intends to "avoid giving the least preference of one denomination above another, to give a few arguments of the principal sects from their own authors as far as possible, to endeavor to represent every sect, and be very careful to enter into the spirit of each author."{{sfn|New England Magazine Company|1894|p=364-}}

The condition of public opinion is seen when Thomas Prentiss, pastor of the Congregational Church in [[Medfield, Massachusetts]], in the Preface, felt obliged to say:—{{sfn|New England Magazine Company|1894|p=364-}} {{quote|text="The world has been absurdly accustomed to entertain but a moderate opinion of female abilities, and to associate their pretended productions to the craft and policy of designing men; either to excite their admiration or screen their weakness from censure; whereas unbiassed reason must allow, if an invidious comparison between the sexes is in any respect justifiable, it cannot be grounded upon a defect of natural ability, but upon the different and perhaps faulty mode of female education; for under similar culture and with equal advantages, it is far from being certain that the female mind would not admit a measure of improvement that would at least equal, and perhaps in many instances eclipse, the boasted glory of the other Her father, with his other children, was living with a married son, to whom the home and property had been made over. Not wishing to add to the burden of her brother's increasing family expenses, Hannah found this the most trying time of her life, when, as she said, " it was a struggle to live." But though feeble in health, dependent upon herself for support, more or less alone in the world, she found in work her only remedy. She began to prepare additions for the second edition of her book. The task being completed, she applied to some printers for terms of publication. "Though," she says, "I wrote nearly the same letter to all, consisting of a few direct questions, their answers were generally various, prolix and ambiguous." She finally accepted an offer of one hundred dollars in books for an edition of one thousand copies. Going to Boston to attend to the matter, a friend introduced her to the Rev. James Freeman, the newly ordained pastor of King's Chapel. He became interested, transacted the business with the printer, John West Folsom, and helped her obtain some new subscribers. For this generous, personal assistance in a time of need, Adams was most grateful to the end of her life.}}

==1791 edition==
In 1791, appeared under the title of ''A View of Religions'', the second edition of her book first published seven years before. It was enlarged to 410 pages. Part First treated of nearly 300 different religious denominations which had appeared from the beginning of the Christian era; Part Second, of the worship of the Grand Lama, of Mahometans, Jews, Deists and Sceptics, followed by a short review of the religions of the people of the habitable world. A discriminating judgment was noticeable in the work. This second edition was dedicated to [[John Adams]], then [[Vice President of the United States]], a name, she said, "which excites the veneration and gratitude of fellow-citizens, the admiration and esteem of foreign nations."{{sfn|New England Magazine Company|1894|p=364-}}

Of the 400 subscribers to this second edition, 82 of whom were clergymen and 16 women, John Adams headed the list with three copies. [[Samuel Adams]], lieutenant-governor of Massachusetts, followed. Among the new names gained were those of [[John Hancock]], of Boston; [[Joseph Willard]], D. D., president of [[Harvard College]]; Right Rev. [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Caroll]], D. D., Roman Catholic Bishop of [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]; Hon. [[William Bradford (Rhode Island)|William Bradford]], [[governor of Rhode Island]]; Rev. [[Henry Ware (Unitarian)|Henry Ware]] of [[Hingham, Massachusetts|Hingham]]; [[Christopher Gore]], Esq., Boston; [[Harrison Gray Otis (politician)|Harrison Gray Otis]], Boston; Rev. Adoniram Judson, Sr., [[Malden, Massachusetts|Malden]]; Hon. Benjamin Greenleaf, [[Newburyport, Massachusetts|Newburyport]]; and many others. Mr. [[Moses Brown]], of [[Providence, Rhode Island |Providence]], took fifteen copies, and seven of the subscribers took six each.{{sfn|New England Magazine Company|1894|p=364-}}

Such distinguished names spoke well of Adams's literary ability. The book was pronounced the best of the kind ever written, possibly the first. From its profits, Adams was enabled to pay the debts her sister's illness had contracted, and to put a small sum at interest. In its sale, her father, who was called by the townspeople "Book Adams," was of much help. On horseback, with his saddle-bag full of the books, often reading a volume, he went from place to place, to sell or to distribute them. Of decided literary tastes himself, he was never happier than when making his frequent visits to the library of Harvard College. Once, upon entering it, he lifted up both hands and exclaimed in great earnestness, "I'd rather be librarian of Harvard College than Emperor of all the Russias!" Who knows but that if Thomas Adams could have followed out his early desires, he might have been librarian of Harvard College? Circumstances obliged him to go into business, and he made a failure of it.{{sfn|New England Magazine Company|1894|p=364-}}

After the publication of the second edition of her book, Adams taught school.{{sfn|New England Magazine Company|1894|p=364-}}

==1804 edition==
[[File:A View of Religions (Third edition, 1801).png|thumb|''A View of Religions'' (1801)]]
Two years after the publication of Adams's ''History of New England from the first settlement at Plymouth to the acceptance of the Federal Constitution'', ''A view of religions, in two parts : Part I. Containing an alphabetical compedium of the various religious denominations, which have appeared in the world, from the beginning of the Christian era to the present day. Part II. Containing a brief account of the different schemes of religion now embraced among mankind '' was published, enlarged, and dedicated as before to John Adams. Through the continued kindness of Rev. James Freeman, a bargain was made with the printer whereby she was to receive five hundred dollars in yearly payments, covering a certain period, for the edition of two thousand copies. In 1804 appeared her book of nearly four hundred pages called " Truth and Excellence of the Christian Religion." Her selection of authors and the extracts from their works reveal good judgment and a wide survey of general literature. Not being able to purchase or borrow all the books she needed for this effort, she spent some time in Boston, in order to visit the booksellers' shops. In such places much of the work, as well as the additions to the third edition of her first book, was written. Adams gave this work, with its four hundred subscribers, to the printer for one hundred dollars in books.{{sfn|New England Magazine Company|1894|p=364-}}

==1805 edition==
''A View of Religions, in three Parts : Part I. Containing an Alphabetical Compendium of the Denominations among Christians. Part II. Containing a brief Account of Paganism, Mahomedism, Judaism, and Deism. Part III. Containing a View of the Religious of the different Nations of the World. By Hannah Adams. A new Edition, with Corrections and Additions. To which is prefixed, An Essay on Truth, by Andrew Fuller.''  was published in 1805. Griffiths &amp; Griffiths commented:—{{sfn|Griffiths|Griffiths|1807|p=217-}} {{quote|text=The Dictionary appears to be compiled with much fairness; and it contains a long article on the Friends or Quakers, on which peculiar care has been bestowed. To such as are desirous of becoming acquainted with the credenda of this church, the particulars here inserted will be interesting, especially as they are exhibited for the purpose of obviating the representation given by Mr. Evans in his “Sketch of Denominations,” of the similarity of their principles to Sociaianism. The evidence of Barclay is quoted, to prove that the Quakers, while they admit the Scriptures to be of divine authority, do not esteem them “the principal ground of truth, nor the primary rule of faith, but only a secondary rule, subordinate to the spirit.” In the 2d and 3d parts of this work, the reader will meet with curious and amusing accounts of the different religions that now prevail in the several quarters and subdivisions of the globe; and which concludes with stating that the extent of the Christian religion, compared with the parts overspread with Paganism and Mahometanism, is as five to twenty-five.}}

==1817 edition==
[[File:A Dictionary of All Religions and Religious Denominations, Jewish, Heathen ... (1817).png|thumb|''A Dictionary of All Religions and Religious Denominations'']]
In 1817 appeared ''A Dictionary of All Religions and Religious Denominations'', dedicated as before to John Adams. This was a popular book from the first. It was published in England with a preface and additions by Mr. Andrew Fuller; also in another form by Mr. Thomas Williams, who likewise made alterations. Adams acknowledged herself indebted to both these editions for some of the improvements in her fourth edition. It received the notice of Jared Sparks in the North American Review; he pronounced it the best manual of the kind he knew of. "It has the peculiar merit," he added, "of the strictest candor and impartiality; and so completely has the author divested herself of all in lividual prepossessions, that it may be doubted whether from a single passage in the whole work her own religious sentiments can be inferred. This freedom from personal bias, in exhibiting the views of others, especially on topics rarely touched without calling out private opinion, inspires confidence in her statements, as well as respect for her judgment and Christian charity."{{sfn|New England Magazine Company|1894|p=364-}}

'''Alternative Energy Institute''' (also known as '''AEI''') was [[West Texas A&amp;M University]]'s alternative energy research branch. Formed in 1977, the program was nationally and internationally recognized, and along with research provides education and outreach around the U.S. and the globe.

==History==
[[Image:Panorama Czarnkow.jpg|thumb|The Alternative Energy Institute Regional Wind Test Center]]

'''AEI''' was founded at '''West Texas State University''' (now ''West Texas A&amp;M University'') in 1977 by
Dr. Vaughn Nelson, Dr. Earl Gilmore and Dr. Robert Barieau during the [[1973 oil crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Carr | first = David | title = Regional Wind Test Center - Our History | work = Windtestcenter.org | publisher = Alternative Energy Institute | date = February 22, 2010 | url = http://www.windtestcenter.org/history/ | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120313193942/http://www.windtestcenter.org/history/ | archivedate = March 13, 2012 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The physics department at West Texas State was already experimenting with wind power and these three individuals took the initiative to found a department to concentrate upon the study of wind. The basic goals of the department were:
* To test wind turbine designs.
* Improve on current aerodynamic design.
* Teach public about the state of wind &amp; solar technology.

===First Decade: 1977 - 1987===
Initially, much of the organization's focus was on small wind turbine research and improving blade designs. At this time they installed test turbines and water pumping applications throughout Texas. These projects allowed AEI to develop and improve upon blade design theory and production. During this period the organization also provided consulting in Latin America, Jamaica, Hawaii, and Europe. There, AEI trained villages and groups in wind energy systems.

At this time AEI operated from three locations: one off-campus and two on-campus. At these locations they customized testing on blade designs, turbine generator units, and complete designs.

===Second Decade: 1987 - 1997===
[[Image:Solbuilding-15.jpg|thumb|AEI's Solar Energy Building]]

During this decade the organization focused on green building projects. The most notable of these was AEI's Solar Energy Building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Solar Building 1993 Photo Gallery | work = Windenergy.org | publisher = Alternative Energy Institute | date = May 11, 2009 | url = http://www.windenergy.org/multimedia/?page_id=195&amp;album=5&amp;gallery=17 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100611131747/http://www.windenergy.org/multimedia/?page_id=195&amp;album=5&amp;gallery=17 | archivedate = June 11, 2010 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finished in 1993, the building served as the main site for AEI's operations for seventeen years. The building covered all of the organization's energy usage, including an on-site 10&amp;nbsp;kW Bergey wind turbine installation, and 3&amp;nbsp;kW of photovoltaics.

Several electric vans were donated to the organization at this time, two of which were maintained for several years. These vans were used to collect data and complete local wind energy projects, as well as to give campus and test site tours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = LaFleur | first = Oral | contribution = Proceedings of the 2002 ASEE Gulf-Southwest Annual Conference | date = 2002 | title = Exploring Renewable Energy Education | editor = The University of Louisiana at Lafayette | volume = 4 | pages = 11 | publisher = American Society for Engineering Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1995, AEI began working with the [[Texas General Land Office]] to provide Texas Wind Data to the public. While the GLO data sites have since been decommissioned,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Mapping and Monitoring Sustainable Energy |date=September 20, 2010 |url=https://roadwaytocollege.com/go/page.pl/000000A/http/www.glo.state.tx.us/sustain/mapping.html |format=Cached |accessdate=December 7, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; the organization still collects, analyzes and publishes Texas Wind Data for the general public.

===Now: 1998 - Present===
AEI is currently focusing on developing a new degree plan at WTAMU&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Ranaivo | first = Yann | title = New WT research head focused on turbines, degree program | work = Amarillo Globe-News | publisher = Morris Publishing Group | date = September 16, 2010 | url = http://amarillo.com/news/local-news/2010-09-16/new-wt-research-head-focused-turbines-degree-program}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as continuing its research on green energy systems. In terms of turbine testing, the organization focuses on small blade and turbine testing, particularly innovative horizontal and vertical axis designs.

In 2010, the AEI test site was moved to the Nance Ranch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Welch | first = Kevin | title = Energy institute: Change afoot: Vaughn's departure among the shifts | work = Amarillo Globe-News | publisher = Morris Publishing Group | date = July 2, 2010 | url = http://amarillo.com/stories/070210/new_news2.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, the organization's offices were also moved, to WTAMU's Palo Duro Research Facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Palo Duro Research Facility | publisher = West Texas A&amp;M University | url = http://www.wtamu.edu/academics/palo-duro-research-facility.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 90s, AEI also began developing a fortran program called ROTOR. The program could predict theoretical power curves for blade designs and produce screen and printed output of this. The program has been modified a few times since then and is still being used today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Clark | first = R.N | date = 1979 | title = Irrigation Pumping with Wind Energy | editor-last = Schneider | editor-first = A.D. | volume = 60 | issue = 5 | page = 30 | publisher = Transactions of the ASABE | id = 0002-1458 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, AEI's Wind Data program has greatly expanded. In addition to working with wind farmers to provide data for the public, the organization also analyzes and publishes data for private organizations. In total, the organizations now collects data from 75 sites scattered across Texas. 50 of these data sites are archived online, 31 of which offer data for public use by researchers and developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Tangler | first = JL | date = 2002 | title = The nebulous art of using wind tunnel aerofoil data for predicting rotor performance | volume = Wind Energy | pages = 11 | publisher = Wiley Online Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==

===Courses===
Since 2009, AEI has been offering online alternative energy courses at WTAMU on [[Wind energy]], [[Solar energy]] and [[Renewable energy]]. Currently, WT offers one course per semester, with alternating subjects. The courses are taught by AEI staff and are open to WT students and those seeking certification.

In addition to the online courses offered by WTAMU, AEI has also authored renewable energy textbooks&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Vaughn | first = Nelson | title = Wind energy: Renewable energy and the environment | publisher = [[CRC Press]] | date = 2009 | pages = 304 | isbn = 978-1-4200-7568-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and educational CDs. The CDs cover the subjects of wind energy, wind turbines, solar energy and wind water pumping. Some CDs are also available in Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = University Bookstore: West Texas A&amp;M University | url = http://www.wtbookstore.com/home.aspx | accessdate = December 6, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101101180126/http://www.wtbookstore.com/home.aspx| archivedate= 1 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seminars &amp; Symposiums===

====Windy Land Owners====
Started in 1989, AEI has been giving annual '''Windy Land Owners''' seminars. Designed to teach land owners and other interested parties general information about the wind industry, most of the seminars took place in the states surrounding Texas. Due to increased interest, AEI began giving seminars in Texas starting in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Romig | first = Georgia | title = Seminar blows wind farmers away | newspaper = The Prairie | date = October 22, 2009 | url = http://www.theprairienews.com/2009/10/22/seminar-blows-wind-farmers-away/ | accessdate = December 6, 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110717024247/http://www.theprairienews.com/2009/10/22/seminar-blows-wind-farmers-away/ | archivedate = July 17, 2011 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Topics covered at these seminars include:
* Wind farm basics
* Wind resources in Texas
* Potential problem and contract considerations

Starting in 2009, AEI also began offering presentations from the WLO Seminars online for general information.

====WEATS====

AEI's Solar Energy Building

Launched in 1998, The Wind Energy Applications Training Symposium (WEATS) is an internationally acclaimed workshop for the  [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American community]]. Designed for project planners, developers, utility officials, and engineers directly involved with energy projects, it is both a good resource for networking and developing practical knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Wind Energy Applications Training Symposium (WEATS), September 28–30, 2010 in Golden, CO | work = TEEIC News and Events | publisher = Tribal Energy and Environmental Information Clearing House | date = August 25, 2010 | url = http://teeic.anl.gov/news/index.cfm | accessdate = December 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Topics covered at this symposium include:
* Practical knowledge and analytical tools for conducting project pre-feasibility and identification analysis
* Implementation of small and large wind energy projects
* Lectures from [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] and local experts about the capabilities of the technology and the economic and financial aspects of sustainable project development
* Site visits

== Community Involvement ==

In addition to its seminars and workshops, AEI also regularly offers consulting to potential wind farmers and hosts tours of its research facilities.

As part of its community outreach, the organization also presents at the Caprock Science Fair&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Beck | first = Bruce | title = Science Fair: Students show off projects at Caprock | newspaper = Amarillo Globe-News | date = June 4, 2008 | url = http://amarillo.com/stories/060408/our_10402501.shtml | accessdate = December 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other local schools, informing students about wind energy via displays, demonstrations and brochures at the elementary, junior high and high school levels.

The '''anamniotes''' are an informal group comprising the [[fishes]] and the [[amphibians]], the so-called "lower [[vertebrates]]", which lay their [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] in water. They are distinguished from the [[amniote]]s, the "higher vertebrates" ([[reptile]]s, [[bird]]s and [[mammal]]s), which lay their eggs on land or retain the fertilized egg within the mother.

The name refers to the [[amnion]], an embryonic membrane produced during the fetal development of amniotes which serves to transport [[oxygen]] into the egg and expel [[carbon dioxide]]. As the name suggests, anamniotes do not develop an amnion during fetal life and are able to exchange oxygen, carbon dioxide and waste metabolites with the surrounding water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Edwin Harris Colbert |last=Colbert |first=E.

==Anamniote traits==
[[File:Frogspawn closeup.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Anamniote eggs from a [[frog]].]]
The group is characterized by retaining the primitive vertebrate condition in several traits:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Alfred Romer |last=Romer |first=A. S. |first2=T. S. |last2=Parsons |origyear=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |edition=6th |year=1985 |isbn=0-03-058443-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, H.A. (1880): ''Manual of Zoology'', Blackwood And Sons. [http://chestofbooks.com/animals/Manual-Of-Zoology/I-Ichthyopsida.html Original text]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Permeable skin allowing diffusion of water and gases directly through the skin.
* Presence at some period of life of [[gills]]
* Absence of an [[amnion]]
* Absence or rudimentary condition of the [[allantois]]
* [[Nucleated]] [[red blood cells]].

==History of discovery==
The features unifying the anamniotes was first noted by [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] in 1863, who coined the phrase ''Ichtioid'' or ''Ichthyopsida'' ("fish-face")  for the group.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, T.H. (1876): Lectures on Evolution. ''New York Tribune''. Extra. no 36. In Collected Essays IV: pp 46-138 [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/CE4/LecEvol.html original text w/ figures]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[Alpha taxonomy|taxonomic]] classification just below the level of [[Vertebrata]], though Huxley presented the Ichthyopsida as an informal unit and never ventured to forward a [[Linnaean taxonomy|Linnaean rank]] for the group. The term ichthyopsida means ''fish-face'' or ''fish-like'' as opposed to the [[sauropsida]] or ''lizard-face'' animals ([[reptiles]] and [[birds]]) and the [[mammals]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, 9th ed. (1878). [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/UnColl/EnBrit/Amphibia.html original text]&lt;/ref&gt;
The group representing an [[evolutionary grade]] rather than a [[clade]], the term anamniote is now used as an informal way of denoting the physical property of the group, rather than as a systematic unit.

'''Applied Maths''' NV is a [[bioinformatics]] company, headquartered in [[Sint-Martens-Latem]], [[Belgium]], developing software for the biosciences.

==History==

Applied Maths was founded in 1992 and gained worldwide recognition with the software GelCompar, used as a standard tool for the normalization and comparative analysis of [[electrophoresis]] patterns ([[PFGE]], [[Amplified fragment length polymorphism|AFLP]], [[RAPD]], REP-PCR and variants, …)
&lt;ref&gt;Dijkshoorn L., Towner K. J., Struelens M., 2001. New approaches for the generation and analysis of microbial typing data. Elsevier, {{ISBN|0-444-50740-X}}, {{ISBN|978-0-444-50740-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

GelCompar II was released in 1998 to deal with the ever growing amounts of information following the success and expansion of electrophoresis and other fingerprinting techniques in various application fields in [[microbiology]], [[virology]] and [[mycology]]. Following the introduction of the concepts of polyphasic taxonomy &lt;ref&gt;[http://mmbr.asm.org/content/60/2/407.full.pdf+html] Vandamme et al., Polyphasic taxonomy, a consensus approach to bacterial systematics. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. June 1996 vol. 60 no. 2 407-438.&lt;/ref&gt; and the growing need to combine [[genotypic]], [[phenotypic]], electrophoresis and sequence information, Applied Maths released in 1996 the software package [[BioNumerics]] which still today is a platform for the management, storage and (statistical) analysis of all types of biological data.&lt;ref&gt;Vauterin L, Vauterin P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7188">'''Archaeological science''', also known as '''archaeometry''', consists of the application of [[scientific technique]]s to the analysis of archaeological materials, to assist in dating the materials. It is related to [[Scientific methodology|methodologies]] of archaeology.  Martinón-Torres and Killick distinguish ‘scientific archaeology’ (as an epistemology) from ‘archaeological science’ (the application of specific techniques to archaeological materials).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marcos Martinón-Torres and David Killick|title=Archaeological Theories and Archaeological Sciences in "The Oxford Handbook of Archaeological Theory"|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martinón-Torres and Killick claim that ‘archaeological science’ has promoted the development of high-level  theory in archaeology. However, Smith rejects both concepts of archaeological science because neither emphasize falsification or a search for causality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Michael E.|title=Social science and archaeological enquiry|journal=Antiquity|date=4 April 2017|volume=91|issue=356|pages=520–528|doi=10.15184/aqy.2017.19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the [[Natural Environment Research Council|Natural and Environmental Research Council]] provides funding for archaeometry separate from the funding provided for archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;

Universities that offer courses in archeometry offer these courses frequently as free choice for [[Archaeology|archeology]] students and these courses contain mainly a nonscientific overview over the possibilities that different scientific analyses offer to them.

== Types of archaeological science ==
Archaeological science can be divided into the following areas:&lt;ref&gt;Tite, M.S. (1991) Archaeological Science - past achievements and future prospects. ''Archaeometry'' '''31''' 139-151.&lt;/ref&gt;
* physical and chemical dating methods which provide archaeologists with [[absolute dating|absolute]] and [[relative dating|relative]] [[chronology|chronologies]]
* [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]] studies
* environmental approaches which provide information on past landscapes, climates, flora, and fauna; as well as the diet, nutrition, health, and [[pathology]] of people
* mathematical methods for data treatment (including computer-based methods)
* [[remote sensing|remote-sensing]] and [[geophysical survey|geophysical-survey]] techniques for buried features
* [[conservation sciences]], involving the study of decay processes and the development of new methods of conservation

Techniques such as [[lithic analysis]], [[archaeometallurgy]], [[paleoethnobotany]], [[palynology]] and [[zooarchaeology]] also form sub-disciplines of archaeological science.

=== Dating techniques ===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
Archaeological science has particular value when it can provide absolute dates for archaeological [[stratum|strata]] and [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]]. Some of the most important [[Dating methodologies in archaeology|dating]] techniques include:
* [[radiocarbon dating]] — especially for dating organic materials
* [[dendrochronology]] — for dating trees; also very important for calibrating radiocarbon dates
* [[thermoluminescence dating]] — for dating inorganic material (including ceramics)
* [[optically stimulated luminescence]] (OSL) — for absolutely dating and relatively profiling buried land-surfaces in vertical and horizontal stratigraphic sections, most often by measuring photons discharged from grains of [[quartz]] within sedimentary bodies (although this technique can also measure [[potassium feldspar]]s, complications caused by internally induced dose-rates often favor the use of quartz-based analyzes in archaeological applications)
* [[electron spin resonance]], as used (for example) in dating teeth
* [[potassium-argon dating]] — for dating (for example) fossilized [[Hominidae|hominid]] remains by association with volcanic sediments (the fossils themselves are not directly dated)

=== Artifact studies ===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2014}}
Another important subdiscipline of archaeometry is the study of artifacts. Archaeometrists have used a variety of methods to analyze artifacts, either to determine more about their composition, or to determine their provenance. These techniques include:
* [[X-ray fluorescence]] (XRF)
* [[inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry]] (ICP-MS)
* [[neutron activation analysis]] (NAA)
* [[scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]] (SEM)
* [[laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy]] (LIBS)

[[Lead]], [[strontium]] and [[oxygen]] [[isotope analysis]] can also test human remains to estimate the diets and even the birthplaces of a study's subjects.

[[Provenance analysis]] has the potential to determine the original source of the materials used, for example, to make a particular artifact. This can show how far the artifact has traveled and can indicate the existence of systems of [[trade|exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;

== Influence of archaeometry ==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
Archaeometry has greatly influenced modern archaeology. Archaeologists can obtain significant additional data and information using these techniques, and archaeometry has the potential to revise the understanding of the past. For example, the "second [[radiocarbon revolution]]" significantly re-dated European prehistory in the 1960s, compared to the "first radiocarbon revolution" from 1949.

== Locating Archaeological Sites ==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
Archaeometry is an important tool in finding potential dig sites.  The use of [[remote sensing]] has enabled archaeologists to identify many more archaeological sites than they could have otherwise. The use of [[aerial photography]] (including [[satellite imagery]] and [[Lidar]]) remains the most widespread remote-sensing technique. Ground-based [[archaeological geophysics|geophysical survey]]s often help to identify and map archaeological features within identified sites.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="632">Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) is a tool that evaluates the deleteriousness of [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|single nucleotide]], [[Indel|insertion and deletion]] variants in the human genome. In contrast with other [[DNA annotation|annotation]] tools that are restricted in scope, the CADD framework integrates multiple annotations into one metric. This is done by contrasting variants that survived natural selection with simulated mutations.

==Ancient Greek science==
An early attempt at demarcation can be seen in the efforts of Greek natural philosophers and medical practitioners to distinguish their methods and their accounts of nature from the mythological or mystical accounts of their predecessors and contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Lloyd | first = G.

{{quote|Aristotle described at length what was involved in having scientific knowledge of something. To be scientific, he said, one must deal with causes, one must use logical demonstration, and one must identify the universals which 'inhere' in the particulars of sense. But above all, to have science one must have ''[[Apodicticity|apodictic certainty]]''. It is the last feature which, for Aristotle, most clearly distinguished the scientific way of knowing.&lt;ref name="Laudan1983"/&gt;|[[Larry Laudan]]|''Physics, Philosophy, and Psychoanalysis'', "The Demise of the Demarcation Problem"}}
In Charmides Plato discusses a "science of science". Although the subject in the dialogue is epistemological, it is an early version of the demarcation problem.{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable secondary source.|date=August 2018}}

[[G. E. R. Lloyd]] notes that there was a sense in which the groups engaged in various forms of inquiry into nature set out to "legitimate their own positions,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Lloyd | first = G.

==Logical positivism==
[[Logical positivism]], formulated in the 1920s, held that only statements about matters of fact or logical relations between concepts are meaningful. All other statements lack sense and are labelled "[[Metaphysics#Rejections of metaphysics|metaphysics]]" (see [[the verifiability theory of meaning]] also known as [[verificationism]]). This distinction between science, which in the view of the [[Vienna Circle]] possessed empirically verifiable statements, and what they pejoratively called "metaphysics", which lacked such statements, can be seen as representing another aspect of the demarcation problem.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kYUFhlIRZA4C&amp;pg=PT97&amp;dq=demarcation+%22logical+positivism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Z9n8U7vdEuKw7AbYgIG4DA&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBDhG#v=onepage&amp;q=demarcation%20%22logical%20positivism%22&amp;f=false Grayling, AC., ''Wittgenstein: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford University Press, 2001, pp. 67-68.]&lt;/ref&gt; Logical positivism is often discussed in the context of the demarcation between science and non-science or pseudoscience. However, "The verificationist proposals had the aim of solving a distinctly different demarcation problem, namely that between science and metaphysics."&lt;ref name="sep-pseudo-science2"&gt;{{cite web |first=Sven Ove |last=Hansson |editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta |year=2008 |title=Science and Pseudo-Science |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=Fall 2008 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/pseudo-science#LogPos |at=4.1 The Logical Positivists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Falsifiability==
[[Falsifiability]] is the demarcation criterion proposed by [[Karl Popper]] as opposed to verificationism: "statements or systems of statements, in order to be ranked as scientific, must be capable of conflicting with possible, or conceivable observations".&lt;ref name="sep-pseudo-science"&gt;{{cite web |first=Sven Ove |last=Hansson |editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta |year=2008 |title=Science and Pseudo-Science |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=Fall 2008 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/pseudo-science#KarPop |at=4.2 Falsificationism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popper saw demarcation as a central problem in the philosophy of science.  Unlike the Vienna Circle, Popper stated that his proposal was not a criterion of "meaningfulness".

{{quote|Popper's demarcation criterion has been criticized both for excluding legitimate science… and for giving some pseudosciences the status of being scientific… According to Larry Laudan (1983, 121), it "has the untoward consequence of countenancing as 'scientific' every crank claim which makes ascertainably false assertions". Astrology, rightly taken by Popper as an unusually clear example of a pseudoscience, has in fact been tested and thoroughly refuted… Similarly, the major threats to the scientific status of psychoanalysis, another of his major targets, do not come from claims that it is untestable but from claims that it has been tested and failed the tests.&lt;ref name="sep-pseudo-science"/&gt;|[[Sven Ove Hansson]]|''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', "Science and Pseudo-Science"}}

In Popper's later work, he stated that falsifiability is both a necessary and a sufficient criterion for demarcation. He described falsifiability as a property of "the logical structure of sentences and classes of sentences," so that a statement's scientific or non-scientific status does not change over time. This has been summarized as a statement being falsifiable "if and only if it logically contradicts some (empirical) sentence that describes a logically possible event that it would be logically possible to observe."&lt;ref name="sep-pseudo-science"/&gt;

[[Nicholas Maxwell]] has argued that physics only accepts theories that are sufficiently unified, this persistent preference for unity committing physics to accepting an implicit metaphysical (i.e. non-falsifiable) thesis concerning the unity of nature.  For good Popperian reasons, this implicit metaphysical thesis needs to be made explicit within physics so that it can be critically assessed and, we may hope, improved.  Popper's demarcation criterion is refuted: an unfalsifiable, metaphysical thesis is a basic tenet of scientific knowledge within physics, whether this is recognized or not.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Maxwell]] (1974) [http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1348844/ The Rationality of Scientific Discovery] Philosophy of Science, 41 (2) 123-153; 1998 [https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-comprehensibility-of-the-universe-9780199261550?lang=en&amp;cc=gb The Comprehensibility of the Universe] Clarendon Press, Oxford; 2017 [http://www.paragonhouse.com/xcart/Understanding-Scientific-Progress-Aim-Oriented-Empiricism.html Understanding Scientific Progress] Paragon House, St. Paul.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postpositivism==
[[Thomas Kuhn]], an American historian and philosopher of science, is often connected with what has been called [[postpositivism]] or [[postempiricism]]. In his 1962 book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', Kuhn divided the process of doing science into two different endeavors, which he called [[normal science]] and [[extraordinary science]] (which he sometimes also called "revolutionary science"). "In Kuhn's view, 'it is normal science, in which Sir Karl's sort of testing does not occur, rather than extraordinary science which most nearly distinguishes science from other enterprises'…"&lt;ref name="sep-pseudo-science"/&gt; That is, the utility of a scientific paradigm for puzzle-solving lies in its suggesting solutions to new problems while continuing to satisfy all of the problems solved by the paradigm that it replaces.

{{quote|Kuhn's view of demarcation is most clearly expressed in his comparison of astronomy with astrology. Since antiquity, astronomy has been a puzzle-solving activity and therefore a science. If an astronomer's prediction failed, then this was a puzzle that he could hope to solve for instance with more measurements or with adjustments of the theory. In contrast, the astrologer had no such puzzles since in that discipline "particular failures did not give rise to research puzzles, for no man, however skilled, could make use of them in a constructive attempt to revise the astrological tradition"… Therefore, according to Kuhn, astrology has never been a science.&lt;ref name="sep-pseudo-science"/&gt;|[[Sven Ove Hansson]]|''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', "Science and Pseudo-Science"}}

Popper criticized Kuhn's demarcation criterion, saying that astrologers are engaged in puzzle solving, and that therefore Kuhn's criterion recognized astrology as a science. He stated that Kuhn's criterion leads to a "major disaster…[the] replacement of a rational criterion of science by a sociological one".&lt;ref name="sep-pseudo-science"/&gt;

==Feyerabend and Lakatos==
Kuhn's work largely called into question Popper's demarcation, and emphasized the human, [[subjectivity|subjective]] quality of scientific change. [[Paul Feyerabend]] was concerned that the very question of demarcation was insidious: science itself had no need of a demarcation criterion, but instead some philosophers were seeking to justify a special position of authority from which science could dominate public discourse.&lt;ref name="Taylor1996"&gt;{{cite book |first=C.A. |last=Taylor |year=1996 |title=Defining Science: A Rhetoric of Demarcation |series=Rhetoric of the Human Sciences Series |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |isbn=9780299150341 |lccn=96000180 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NdkDiqh5ySYC&amp;pg=PA41 |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feyerabend argued that science does not in fact occupy a special place in terms of either its logic or method, and no claim to special authority made by scientists can be upheld. He argued that, within the history of scientific practice, no rule or method can be found that has not been violated or circumvented at some point in order to advance scientific knowledge. Both [[Imre Lakatos]] and Feyerabend suggest that science is not an autonomous form of reasoning, but is inseparable from the larger body of human thought and inquiry.

==Thagard==
[[Paul R. Thagard]] has proposed another set of principles to try to overcome these difficulties, and believes it is important for society to find a way of doing so. According to Thagard's method, a theory is not scientific if it satisfies two conditions:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cavehill.uwi.edu/bnccde/PH29A/thagard.html ''Why Astrology Is A Pseudoscience''], [[Paul R. Thagard]], In Philosophy of Science Association 1978 Volume 1, edited by P.D. Asquith and I. Hacking (East Lansing: Philosophy of Science Association, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt;
# The theory has been less progressive than alternative theories over a long period of time, and faces many unsolved problems; and...
# The community of practitioners makes little attempt to develop the theory towards solutions of the problems, shows no concern for attempts to evaluate the theory in relation to others, and is selective in considering confirmations and disconfirmations.

Thagard specifies that sometimes theories will spend some time as merely "unpromising" before they truly deserve the title of pseudoscience. He cites astrology as an example: it was stagnant compared to advances in physics during the 17th century, and only later became "pseudoscience" in the advent of alternative explanations provided by psychology during the 19th century.

Thagard also states that his criteria should not be interpreted so narrowly as to allow willful [[ignorance]] of alternative explanations, or so broadly as to discount our modern science compared to science of the future. His definition is a practical one, which generally seeks to distinguish pseudoscience as areas of inquiry which are stagnant and without active scientific investigation.

==Some historians' perspectives==
Many historians of science are concerned with the development of science from its primitive origins; consequently they define science in sufficiently broad terms to include early forms of natural knowledge.  In the article on science in the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|eleventh edition]] of the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', the scientist and historian [[William Cecil Dampier Whetham]] defined science as "ordered knowledge of natural phenomena and of the relations between them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Dampier Whetham | first = William Cecil | author-link = William Cecil Dampier Whetham | publication-date = 1911 | title = Encyclopædia Britannica | contribution = Science | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. | publication-place = New York | url = https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his study of Greek science, [[Marshall Clagett]] defined science as "first, the orderly and systematic comprehension, description and/or explanation of natural phenomena and, secondly, the [mathematical and logical] tools necessary for the undertaking."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Clagett | first = Marshall | author-link = Marshall Clagett
| publication-date = 1963 | title = Greek Science in Antiquity | publisher = Collier Books | publication-place = New York | page = 4 | isbn = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar definition appeared more recently in [[David Pingree]]'s study of early science: "Science is a systematic explanation of perceived or imaginary phenomena, or else is based on such an explanation.  Mathematics finds a place in science only as one of the symbolical languages in which scientific explanations may be expressed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Pingree | first = David | author-link = David Pingree | year = 1992 | title = Hellenophilia versus the History of Science | journal = Isis | volume  = 83 | pages = 554–563 | doi=10.1086/356288}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These definitions tend to focus more on the subject matter of science than on its method and from these perspectives, the philosophical concern to establish a line of demarcation between science and non-science becomes "problematic, if not futile."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = McCluskey | first = Stephen C. | editor-last = Fountain | editor-first = John W. | editor2-last = Sinclair | editor2-first = Rolf M. | publication-date = 2005 | title = Current Studies in Archaeoastronomy: Conversations Across Time and Space | chapter = Different Astronomies, Different Cultures and the Question of Cultural Relativism | publisher = Carolina Academic Press | publication-place = Durham, NC | page = 71 | isbn = 0-89089-771-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laudan==
[[Larry Laudan]] concluded, after examining various historical attempts to establish a demarcation criterion, that "philosophy has failed to deliver the goods" in its attempts to distinguish science from non-science—to distinguish science from pseudoscience.  None of the past attempts would be accepted by a majority of philosophers nor, in his view, should they be accepted by them or by anyone else.  He stated that many well-founded beliefs are not scientific and, conversely, many scientific conjectures are not well-founded.  He also stated that demarcation criteria were historically used as {{lang|fr|machines de guerre}} in polemical disputes between "scientists" and "pseudo-scientists."  Advancing a number of examples from everyday practice of football and carpentry and non-scientific scholarship such as literary criticism and philosophy, he saw the question of whether a belief is well-founded or not to be more practically and philosophically significant than whether it is scientific or not.  In his judgment, the demarcation between science and non-science was a pseudo-problem that would best be replaced by focusing on the distinction between reliable and unreliable knowledge, without bothering to ask whether that knowledge is scientific or not.  He would consign phrases like "pseudo-science" or "unscientific" to the rhetoric of politicians or sociologists.&lt;ref name="Laudan1983"/&gt;

Others have disagreed with Laudan. Sebastian Lutz, for example, argues that demarcation does not have to be a single necessary and sufficient condition as Laudan implied.&lt;ref name="Laudan1983"/&gt;  Rather, Laudan's reasoning at the most establishes that there has to be one necessary criterion and one possibly different sufficient criterion.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Lutz |first=Sebastian |title=On an Allegedly Essential Feature of Criteria for the Demarcation of Science |journal=The Reasoner |pages=125–126 |volume=5 |number=8 |year=2011 |url=http://www.kent.ac.uk/secl/philosophy/jw/TheReasoner/vol5/TheReasoner-5(8).pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109143743/http://www.kent.ac.uk/secl/philosophy/jw/TheReasoner/vol5/TheReasoner-5%288%29.pdf |archivedate=2012-11-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics have argued for multiple demarcation criteria suggesting that there should be one set of criteria for the natural sciences; another set of criteria for the social sciences, and claims involving the supernatural could have a set of pseudoscientific criteria. [[Massimo Pigliucci]] wrote that science generally conforms to [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s concept of [[family resemblance]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Massimo Pigliucci|Pigliucci, Massimo]] (2013). "The Demarcation Problem: A (Belated) Response to Laudan" in Pigliucci, Massimo; [[Maarten Boudry|Boudry, Maarten]], eds. ''Philosophy of Pseudoscience: Reconsidering the Demarcation Problem'' chapter 1.  {{ISBN|978-0-226-05196-3}}. Pigliucci's chapter is available online at http://philpapers.org/rec/PIGTDP.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
Concerning [[science education]], Michael D. Gordin wrote:&lt;ref name=Gordin&gt;Michael D. Gordin (2015) "Myth 27. That a clear line of demarcation has separated science from pseudoscience", in ''Newton’s Apple and other Myths about Science'', [[Ronald L. Numbers]] editor, [[Harvard University Press]] {{doi|10.4159/9780674089167-029}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|220}}
:Every student in public or private takes several years of science, but only a small fraction of them pursue careers in the sciences. We teach the rest of them so much science so that they will appreciate what it ''means'' to be scientific – and, hopefully, become scientifically literate and apply some of those lessons in their lives. For such students, the myth of a bright line of demarcation is essential.
Discussions of the demarcation problem highlight the [[rhetoric of science]] and promote [[critical thinking]]. Citizens thinking critically, and expressing themselves with reasoned argument in [[public policy|policy discussion]], contribute to enlightened democracy. For example, Gordin stated
:Demarcation remains essential for the enormously high political stakes of climate-change denial and other anti-regulatory fringe doctrines.&lt;ref name=Gordin/&gt;{{rp|225}}
The demarcation problem has been compared to the problem of differentiating [[fake news]] from real news, which rose to prominence in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 United States presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=LeVine |first=Michael V |title=Science has experience fighting fake news — and Facebook should take note |url=https://mic.com/articles/161376/science-has-experience-fighting-fake-news-and-facebook-should-take-note#.m62pUua8z |year=2016 |journal=[[Mic (media company)|Mic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dunkerley's method''' is used in mechanical engineering to determine the critical speed of a shaft-rotor system.  Other methods include the [[Rayleigh&amp;ndash;Ritz method]].

==Whirling of a shaft==

No shaft can ever be perfectly straight or perfectly balanced. When an element of mass is offset from the axis of rotation, centrifugal force will tend to pull the mass outward. The elastic properties of the shaft will act to restore the “straightness”. If the frequency of rotation is equal to one of the resonant frequencies of the shaft, ''whirling'' will occur. In order to save the machine from failure, operation at such whirling speeds must be avoided. Whirling is a complex phenomenon that can include harmonics but we are only going to consider ''synchronous whirl'', where the frequency of whirling is the same as the rotational speed.

==Dunkerley’s formula (approximation)==

The whirling frequency of a symmetric cross section of a given length between two points is given by:
	
:&lt;math&gt;   N  = 94.251 \sqrt{E I \over m L^3} \ \text{RPM}&lt;/math&gt;

where: 
E = Young's modulus,
I = [[second moment of area]],
m = mass of the shaft,
L = length of the shaft between points.

A shaft with weights added will have an angular velocity of N (RPM) equivalent as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{N_N^2} = \frac{1}{N_A^2} + \frac{1}{N_B^2} + \cdots +  \frac{1}{N_n^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11705">[[File:EcoCAR final SATURN copy.jpg|thumb|400px|right|An international university competition which challenges teams to lead in the development of advanced automotive technologies]]
'''EcoCAR: The NeXt Challenge''' is a three-year competition that builds on the 19-year history of [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)]] [[Advanced Vehicle Technology Competitions (AVTC)|advanced vehicle technology competitions]] by giving engineering students the chance to design and build advanced vehicles that demonstrate leading-edge automotive technologies, with the goal of minimizing the environmental impact of personal transportation and illustrating pathways to a sustainable transportation future. The DOE has again joined [[General Motors|General Motors (GM)]], the [[Government of Canada]] (Transport Canada, Natural Resources Canada), and other sponsors for this new competition series, named the EcoCAR Challenge. [[Argonne National Laboratory]], a DOE research and development facility, will organize and operate the EcoCAR Challenge. Some previous types of advanced vehicle technology competitions include FutureTruck, FutureCar, and [[Challenge X]]. These type of competitions are usually supported by one or more of the [[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)#United States and Canada|Big Three American Automobile Manufacturers]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecocar2.org/ecocarchallenge|title=EcoCAR: The NeXt Challenge|website=www.ecocar2.org|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background on EcoCAR ==
The DOE announced a Notice of Program Interest for North American colleges and universities with accredited engineering programs to compete for the opportunity to participate in EcoCAR: The NeXt Challenge—a new international collegiate vehicle engineering competition—through a request-for-proposal (RFP) process in 2008.

EcoCAR seeks to advance the level of vehicle technology capable of reducing petroleum consumption and [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) emissions while demonstrating the real-world performance of a range of technology options. Schools interested in receiving an RFP describing in detail the requirements for competing for one of the up to 17 available slots in EcoCAR were invited to express their interest.

== Technology Development ==
The technologies explored in EcoCAR are identical to those being investigated by the automotive industry to meet the demands of improved energy efficiency and dramatic reductions in [[Greenhouse gas]] (GHG)s, as well as to address [[Zero-emissions vehicle|California zero-emissions vehicle (ZEV)]] regulations. These technologies include full-function electric, hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and fuel cell hybrid vehicles. The only fuels approved for use in EcoCAR are [[Common ethanol fuel mixtures|E10 ethanol]], [[E85|E85 ethanol]], [[Biodiesel|B20 biodiesel]], compressed gaseous hydrogen, and the energy carrier electricity.

Teams selected will design and integrate advanced-technology powertrains, lightweight materials, and aerodynamic improvements into a production vehicle. Using this approach, EcoCAR will explore pathways for future vehicles while giving the student participants the knowledge and experience they need to rapidly develop critical engineering skills and become the next generation of leaders in the automotive industry.

EcoCAR is based on a real-world integrated vehicle design and development process. Teams of engineers from the selected schools will develop their vehicles following a modified GM Global Vehicle Development Process (GVDP) for each phase of the three-year competition. By the end of the competition, the sponsors expect fully developed vehicles equivalent to prototypes ready for a production decision. While applying proven methods for engineering successful prototype vehicles, students will learn real-world engineering skills that will make them highly effective in the automotive industry. At the conclusion of each of EcoCAR’s three years, a week-long competition involving all of the participating schools will take place at a GM vehicle proving ground or other appropriate location in [[North America]].

== Participation ==
[[File:Seed Money.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Virginia Tech's Team Leader, Adam Robinson, accepting GM's Seed Money]]
Teams will receive $10,000 in seed money in Year One, a wide range of powertrain components, a vehicle donated by GM, and technical and mentoring support from the competition sponsors. EcoCAR teams will also have a GM mentor knowledgeable in technologies relevant to the team assigned to assist them during the competition. Substantial funds will also be provided to each university to support a full-time graduate student who will provide the team with leadership and continuity over the three-year program.

Schools will be required to match cash seed money donations from EcoCAR sponsors and to provide class credit for students participating in the competition, release time equal to at least one class per semester for a faculty advisor from the engineering school, and logistical and promotional support for their team. Teams may also be asked to match seed money each year to support a full-time, graduate-level engineering team leader. A signed letter of support will be required from the Dean of the Engineering Department with each proposal. If accepted into EcoCAR, each school will be required to sign an annual Good Faith Agreement reaffirming the school's full support of their team and explicitly stating its willingness to participate in all EcoCAR activities with at least one faculty advisor in attendance.

== Outreach ==
[[File:MiddleSchoolOutreach.jpg|thumb|255px|right|Virginia Tech team members Mark Meyer, left, and Graham Burkholder, right, show how their hybrid controller works to interested middle school students.]]
As part of the competition, EcoCAR teams are required to participate in different types of outreach events. These events include things such as press releases, community outreach, K-12 education, etc. Each team is asked to reach out to their communities and get them interested in EcoCAR.

== Year One results ==
In Year One (2009), teams use modeling and simulation to develop their vehicle architecture. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecocar2.org/ecocar-challenge_media|title=EcoCAR Challenge_Media|website=www.ecocar2.org|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecocar2.org/ecocarchallenge/Y1%20Program.pdf|title=Y1 Program.pdf|last=|first=|date=|website=Y1 Program.pdf|publisher=|page=5|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Edison Engineering Development Program''' (EEDP) is one of [[General Electric]]'s 8 corporate entry level programs. Focused on engineering, the program aims to "develop technical problem-solving skills through advanced courses in engineering and technical projects that are aligned with business objectives". It is named in honor of GE's founder, [[Thomas Edison]].
Typically each GE business runs its own program, and candidates are required to apply for and rotate within the program at a specific business.

EEDP, the oldest of GE's rotational programs, founded in 1923, for new BS and MS grads, provides three to five assignments (6–8 months each (12 months in GE Aviation)) over two or three years. Assignments are driven by real GE business priorities, which may include working with systems, analysis, design, quality, reliability, integration, and testing. Program members develop and enhance their technical problem-solving skills through advanced engineering course work, reports, and team presentations. Another benefit of EEDP is the opportunity to earn a masters in engineering while in (or shortly upon completion of) the program.  EEDP is most popular at the more technical businesses in GE's portfolio, including GE Aviation, Healthcare, Power, Renewable Energy, Digital, Transportation.

==Program Summary==
* Two or three year entry-level program consisting of at least three rotation assignments
* Assignments are engineering projects and may include systems, hardware/software/mechanical design, quality, and validation
* First year coursework includes advanced engineering topics to develop technical skills
* Second year coursework includes corporate leadership topics to develop business skills
* Program members are encouraged (if not required) to earn credit towards an MS degree in Engineering while on program (normally done in the third year of the program)

==Candidate Criteria==
(from GE's official site)
* Passion for technology
* Demonstrated academic excellence
* Commitment to technology and quality
* Strong analytical, problem-solving and communication skills
* Engineering degree and relevant internship/co-op experience preferred
* Minimum GPA 3.0/4.0

==Advanced Courses in Engineering==

The Advanced Courses in Engineering, or ACE, is the official title for the graduate-level coursework undertaken by EEDP members. The ACE is divided into three sections: A Course, B Course, and C Course.  Grading is assessed based on homework and/or tests.  Homework may consist of problem sets, short reports or formal reports, team or individual presentations and typically requires 20–40 hours of effort per week, which must be completed outside of normal work hours.

During the first year in the program, EEDP participants are required to take GE's engineering "A Course," which is designed to sharpen technical and problem-solving skills.  The content of A Course varies by business, but typically includes a collection of topics rooted in technology, math, and science, such as [[Statistics]], [[Differential Equations]], [[Digital Electronics]], [[Analog Electronics]], Software Design, [[Data Mining]], [[Metallurgy]], and [[Heat Transfer]], as well as business-specific engineering, which may include engines, digital imaging, chemistry, and the physics of technologies used in that business' field. For instance, wind turbine design, wind resource assessment in GE Renewable Energy. Additionally, members participate in GE's esteemed "Activating your Leadership Journey (ALJ) (Formerly: Foundations of Leadership)" course on its [[Crotonville, New York]] campus and "Eng@GE" (Engineering @ GE) in various locations in the world. 

The second year in the program, participants are required to take the "B Course," which applies technical skills to actual business proposals.  Coursework typically involves technical business fundamentals, such as program management incorporated in team projects where a certain business priority problem is solved by a team of Edisons.  Additional classes cover extensive seminars on technology and a lot of hands-on training, either in the field or at the factories. Program members may choose a major business project to complete at the conclusion of the program, and then report out to senior management on the benefits generated (cost reductions, use of advanced technologies, etc.).

The third and final part of the ACE program is "C Course," which is a strictly optional course for some businesses.  The focus of C Course is a design project related to the enrollee's Masters thesis.  Few program members pursue a C Course certificate, but it is considered a top achievement throughout technical roles at GE.

After completion of the ACE program, EEDP engineers will have a number of graduate credits they can transfer to one of several universities (typically universities located near the business, or other top schools available via distance learning) to help complete a master's degree.  This allows program participants to earn a Masters or other advanced degree through a number of top schools while still employed by GE and working full-time.

ACE requirements vary from business to business. ACE programs at all GE businesses do not strictly adhere to the above definitions of the A, B, and C Courses.

==Rotations==
The members taking this course work in a minimum of 2 or 3 fields/teams over a period of 2 to 3 years. These rotations help in bridging the knowledge gap between teams and thus adding value to the organization.

==Leadership Trainings==
The participants undergo different levels of Management trainings such as "ALJ-Activating your Leadership Journey", eng@ge-engineering @ GE, as well as Six Sigma Green Belt Certification.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6054">The '''Electronic Visualization Laboratory''' ('''EVL''') is a cross-disciplinary research lab at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]].  It brings together faculty and students from the [[Art]] and [[Computer Science]] departments of UIC.  The primary areas of research are in [[computer graphics]], high-performance [[computer networking]], and technological art.

==History==
EVL represents one of the oldest art and engineering collaborations in the United States.  It was founded in 1973 by [[Thomas A. DeFanti|Tom DeFanti]] (then of the UIC Chemistry Department, later Computer Science) and [[Daniel J. Sandin|Dan Sandin]] (of the Art Department).  The lab was originally known as the ''Circle Graphics Habitat'', in reference to the then-name of UIC, the ''University of Illinois at Chicago Circle''.  DeFanti and Sandin have served as Co-Directors of the lab since its founding.  Later in 1987, they were joined by [[Maxine D. Brown]] as Associate Director.

==Art==
Highlights of the electronic art work done at EVL include:
* Electronic Visualization Events (EVE) in the mid 1970s - live, real-time performances featuring computer graphics, video processing, and music.
* Early computer graphics art videos, created by combining DeFanti's GRASS system on a [[PDP-11]] and the [[Sandin Image Processor]].  The video ''Spiral PTL'' (1980) was included in the inaugural collection of video art at the [[Museum of Modern Art]].
* Computer artist [[Larry Cuba]] spent time at EVL, using the tools there for his films ''3/78'' and ''Calculated Movements'', as well as a short special effects sequence for [[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]].
* In 1996, EVL installed the first publicly accessible CAVE at the [[Ars Electronica Center]] in Austria, and presented a number of virtual reality artworks.

==SIGGRAPH==
The members of EVL have been involved with the [[SIGGRAPH]] organization and conference ever since its inception.  DeFanti has served as Secretary (1977-1981) and Chair (1981-1985) of the organization, and 1979 conference chair.  Brown has served as Vice Chair for Operations (1985-1987) and Secretary (1981-1985), and chaired the 1992 conference.  According to [[Jim Blinn]], the popular Electronic Theatre "started out as a bunch of people crowding into Dan Sandin’s dorm room to watch videotapes." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=How to Attend a Siggraph Conference|author=Blinn, J.|journal=IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications|volume=15|issue=4|pages=86–88|doi=10.1109/38.391503|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1979, DeFanti established the SIGGRAPH Video Review, which EVL has continued to supervise.  At SIGGRAPH '92, EVL organized the "Showcase" event, where researchers demonstrated 35 projects in state-of-the-art computational science and [[scientific visualization]].  At SIGGRAPH '94, EVL organized the VROOM event, demonstrations of the state of [[virtual reality]] technology.

In 1998, Brown received the first ever SIGGRAPH Outstanding Service Award for her contributions to the organization.  In 2000, DeFanti and EVL alumna [[Copper Giloth]] also received the Outstanding Service Award.

'''Endogenous retroviruses''' ('''ERVs''') are [[endogenous viral element]]s in the [[genome]] that closely resemble and can be derived from [[retrovirus]]es. They are abundant in the genomes of [[Gnathostomata|jawed vertebrates]], and they comprise  up to 5–8% of the human genome (lower estimates of ~1%).&lt;ref name=Belshaw2004/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Nelson PN, Hooley P, Roden D, Davari Ejtehadi H, Rylance P, Warren P, Martin J, Murray PG |title=Human endogenous retroviruses: Transposable elements with potential ?|journal=Clinical and Experimental Immunology|date=October 2004|volume=138 |issue=1 |pages=1–9|pmc=1809191|pmid=15373898|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2249.2004.02592.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ERVs are a subclass of a type of [[gene]] called a [[transposon]], which can be packaged and moved within the genome to serve a vital role in [[gene expression]] and in [[Gene regulation|regulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Khodosevich|first=Konstantin|author2=Lebedev, L |author3=Sverdolv, E. |title=Endogenous retroviruses and human evolution|journal=Comparative and Functional Genomics|date=October 2002|issue=6|pages=494–98|doi=10.1002/cfg.216|volume=3 |pmid=18629260 |pmc=2448423}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kim FJ, Battini JL, Manel N, Sitbon M |title=Emergence of vertebrate retroviruses and envelope capture |journal=Virology |volume=318 |issue=1 |pages=183–91 |year=2004 |pmid=14972546 |doi=10.1016/j.virol.2003.09.026 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0042682203006998}}

== Formation ==

The replication cycle of a [[retrovirus]] entails the insertion ("integration") of a DNA copy of the viral [[genome]] into the [[Cell nucleus|nuclear]] genome of the [[Host (biology)|host]] [[Cell (biology)|cell]]. Most retroviruses infect [[somatic cells]], but occasional infection of [[germline]] cells (cells that produce eggs and sperm) can also occur. Rarely, retroviral integration may occur in a germline cell that goes on to develop into a viable organism. This organism will carry the inserted retroviral genome as an integral part of its own genome—an "endogenous" retrovirus (ERV) that may be [[heredity|inherited]] by its [[offspring]] as a novel [[allele]]. Many ERVs have persisted in the genome of their hosts for millions of years. However, most of these have acquired inactivating [[mutation]]s during host [[DNA replication]] and are no longer capable of producing virus. ERVs can also be partially excised from the genome by a process known as recombinational deletion, in which [[Genetic recombination|recombination]] between the identical sequences that flank newly integrated retroviruses results in deletion of the internal, [[protein]]-coding regions of the viral genome.

The general retrovirus genome consists of three genes vital for the invasion, replication, escape, and spreading of its viral genome. These three genes are gag (encodes for structural proteins for the viral core), pol (encodes for [[reverse transcriptase]], [[integrase]], and [[protease]]), and env (encodes for [[Viral coat protein|coat protein]]s for the virus's exterior). These viral proteins are encoded as [[polyproteins]]. In order to carry out their life cycle, the retrovirus relies heavily on the host cell's machinery. Protease degrades peptide bonds of the viral polyproteins, making the separate proteins functional. Reverse transcriptase functions to synthesize viral DNA from the viral RNA in the host cell's cytoplasm before it enters the nucleus. Integrase guides the integration of viral DNA into the host genome.&lt;ref name="Johnson 10254–10260"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fujiwara|first=T.|last2=Mizuuchi|first2=K.|date=1988-08-12|title=Retroviral DNA integration: structure of an integration intermediate|journal=Cell|volume=54|issue=4|pages=497–504|pmid=3401925|doi=10.1016/0092-8674(88)90071-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Endogenous retroviruses can play an active role in shaping genomes. Most studies in this area have focused on the genomes of humans and higher primates, but other vertebrates, such as mice and sheep, have also been studied in depth.&lt;ref name=Li12&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li J, Akagi K, Hu Y, Trivett AL, Hlynialuk CJ, Swing DA, Volfovsky N, Morgan TC, Golubeva Y, Stephens RM, Smith DE, Symer DE | title = Mouse endogenous retroviruses can trigger premature transcriptional termination at a distance | journal = Genome Res | volume = 22 | issue = 5 | pages = 870–84 |date=March 2012 | pmid = 22367191 | pmc = 3337433 | doi = 10.1101/gr.130740.111 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=no7&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Spencer TE, Palmarini M | title = Endogenous retroviruses of sheep: a model system for understanding physiological adaptation to an evolving ruminant genome | journal = J Reprod Dev | volume = 58 | issue = 1 | pages = 33–7 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22450282 | doi = 10.1262/jrd.2011-026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Black10&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Black SG, Arnaud F, Palmarini M, Spencer TE | title = Endogenous Retroviruses in Trophoblast Differentiation and Placental Development | journal = American Journal of Reproductive Immunology | volume = 64 | issue = 4 | pages = 255–264 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20528833 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0897.2010.00860.x | pmc = 4198168 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15574851"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ryan FP | title = Human endogenous retroviruses in health and disease: a symbiotic perspective | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 97 | issue = 12 | pages = 560–5 |date=December 2004 | pmid = 15574851 | pmc = 1079666 | doi = 10.1258/jrsm.97.12.560 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The long terminal repeat ([[Long terminal repeat|LTR]]) sequences that flank ERV genomes frequently act as alternate [[gene promoter|promoters]] and [[gene enhancer|enhancers]], often contributing to the [[alternative splicing|transcriptome]] by producing tissue-specific variants. In addition, the retroviral [[protein]]s themselves have been co-opted to serve novel host functions, particularly in reproduction and development. Recombination between homologous retroviral sequences has also contributed to gene shuffling and the generation of genetic variation. Furthermore, in the instance of potentially antagonistic effects of retroviral sequences, repressor genes have co-evolved to combat them.

Solo LTRs and LTRs associated with complete retroviral sequences have been shown to act as transcriptional elements on host genes. Their range of action is mainly by insertion into the 5' [[untranslated region|UTR]]s of protein coding genes; however, they have been known to act upon genes up to 70–100&amp;nbsp;[[base pair#Length measurements|kb]] away.&lt;ref name=Li12 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pi W, Zhu X, Wu M, Wang Y, Fulzele S, Eroglu A, Ling J, Tuan D | title = Long-range function of an intergenic retrotransposon | journal = PNAS | volume = 107 | issue = 29 | pages = 12992–12997 |date=July 2010 | pmid = 20615953 | pmc = 2919959 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1004139107 | bibcode = 2010PNAS..10712992P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lagemaat03&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=van de Lagemaat LN, Landry JR, Mager DL, Medstrand P | title = Transposable elements in mammals promote regulatory variation and diversification of genes with specialized functions | journal = Trends Genet | volume = 19 | issue = 10 | pages = 530–6 |date=October 2003 | pmid = 14550626 | doi = 10.1016/j.tig.2003.08.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kovalskaya06&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kovalskaya E, Buzdin A, Gogvadze E, Vinogradova T, Sverdlov E | title = Functional human endogenous retroviral LTR transcription start sites are located between the R and U5 regions | journal = Virology | volume = 346 | issue = 2 | pages = 373–8 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16337666 | doi = 10.1016/j.virol.2005.11.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of these elements are inserted in the sense direction to their corresponding genes, but there has been evidence of LTRs acting in the antisense direction and as a bidirectional promoter for neighboring genes.&lt;ref name=no11&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dunn CA, Romanish MT, Gutierrez LE, van de Lagemaat LN, Mager DL | title = Transcription of two human genes from a bidirectional endogenous retrovirus promoter | journal = Gene | volume = 366 | issue = 2 | pages = 335–42 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16288839 | doi = 10.1016/j.gene.2005.09.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=no12&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gogvadze E, Stukacheva E, Buzdin A, Sverdlov E | title = Human-specific modulation of transcriptional activity provided by endogenous retroviral insertions | journal = J Virol | volume = 83 | issue = 12 | pages = 6098–105 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19339349 | pmc = 2687385 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.00123-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a few cases, the LTR functions as the major promoter for the gene. For example, in humans AMY1C has a complete ERV sequence in its promoter region; the associated LTR confers salivary specific expression of the digestive [[enzyme]] [[amylase]].&lt;ref name=no13&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ting CN, Rosenberg MP, Snow CM, Samuelson LC, Meisler MH | title = Endogenous retroviral sequences are required for tissue-specific expression of a human salivary amylase gene | journal = Genes Dev | volume = 6 | issue = 8 | pages = 1457–65 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1379564 | doi = 10.1101/gad.6.8.1457 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the primary promoter for [[BAAT|bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase]] (BAAT), which codes for an enzyme that is integral in bile metabolism, is of LTR origin.&lt;ref name=Lagemaat03 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cohen09&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cohen CJ, Lock WM, Mager DL | title = Endogenous retroviral LTRs as promoters for human genes: a critical assessment | journal = Gene | volume = 448 | issue = 2 | pages = 105–14 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19577618 | doi = 10.1016/j.gene.2009.06.020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The insertion of a solo ERV-9 LTR may have produced a functional [[open reading frame]] (ORF), causing the rebirth of the human [[IRGM|immunity related GTPase gene]] (IRGM).&lt;ref name=no15&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bekpen C, Marques-Bonet T, Alkan C, Antonacci F, Leogrande MB, Ventura M, Kidd JM, Siswara P, Howard JC, Eichler EE | title = Death and resurrection of the human IRGM gene | journal = PLoS Genet | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = e1000403 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19266026 | pmc = 2644816 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000403 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ERV insertions have also been shown to generate alternative splice sites either by direct integration into the gene, as with the human leptin hormone receptor, or driven by the expression of an upstream LTR, as with the phospholipase A-2 like protein.&lt;ref name=Jern08&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jern P, Coffin JM | title = Effects of Retroviruses on Host Genome Function | journal = Annu Rev Genet | volume = 42 | issue =  | pages = 709–32 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18694346 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genet.42.110807.091501 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the time, however, the LTR functions as one of many alternate promoters, often conferring tissue-specific expression related to reproduction and development. In fact, 64% of known LTR-promoted transcription variants are [[Gene expression|expressed]] in reproductive tissues.&lt;ref name=no16&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Oliver KR, Greene WK | title = Mobile DNA and the TE-Thrust hypothesis: supporting evidence from the primates | journal = Mob DNA | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 8 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21627776 | pmc = 3123540 | doi = 10.1186/1759-8753-2-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the gene CYP19 codes for [[aromatase]] P450, an important enzyme for estrogen synthesis, that is normally expressed in the brain and reproductive organs of most mammals.&lt;ref name=Lagemaat03 /&gt; However, in primates, an LTR-promoted transcriptional variant confers expression to the placenta and is responsible for controlling estrogen levels during pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Lagemaat03 /&gt; Furthermore, the [[NAIP (gene)|neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein]] (NAIP), normally widespread, has an LTR of the HERV-P family acting as a promoter that confers expression to the testis and prostate.&lt;ref name=no17&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Romanish MT, Lock WM, van de Lagemaat LN, Dunn CA, Mager DL | title = Repeated recruitment of LTR retrotransposons as promoters by the anti- apoptotic locus NAIP during mammalian evolution | journal = PLoS Genet | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = e10 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17222062 | pmc = 1781489 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.0030010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other proteins, such as nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3), interleukin-2 receptor B (IL2RB), and another mediator of estrogen synthesis, HSD17B1, are also alternatively regulated by LTRs that confer placental expression, but their specific functions are not yet known.&lt;ref name=Cohen09 /&gt;&lt;ref name=no18&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Huh JW, Ha HS, Kim DS, Kim HS | title = Placenta-restricted expression of LTR- derived NOS3 | journal = Placenta | volume = 29 | issue = 7 | pages = 602–8 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18474398 | doi = 10.1016/j.placenta.2008.04.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The high degree of reproductive expression is thought to be an after effect of the method by which they were endogenized; however, this also may be due to a lack of DNA methylation in germ-line tissues.&lt;ref name=Cohen09 /&gt;

The best-characterized instance of placental protein expression comes not from an alternatively promoted host gene but from a complete co-option of a retroviral protein. Retroviral fusogenic env proteins, which play a role in the entry of the virion into the host cell, have had an important impact on the development of the mammalian [[placenta]]. In mammals, intact env proteins called [[ERVWE1|syncytins]] are responsible for the formation and function of [[placenta|syncytiotrophoblasts]].&lt;ref name=Black10 /&gt; These multinucleated cells are mainly responsible for maintaining nutrient exchange and separating the fetus from the mother's immune system.&lt;ref name=Black10 /&gt; It has been suggested that the selection and fixation of these proteins for this function have played a critical role in the evolution of [[viviparity]].&lt;ref name="pmid8995601"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Villarreal LP, Villareal LP | title = On viruses, sex, and motherhood | journal = J. Virol. | volume = 71 | issue = 2 | pages = 859–65 | date = February 1997 | pmid = 8995601 | pmc = 191132 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the insertion of ERVs and their respective LTRs have the potential to induce chromosomal rearrangement due to recombination between viral sequences at inter-chromosomal loci. These rearrangements have been shown to induce gene duplications and deletions that largely contribute to genome plasticity and dramatically change the dynamic of gene function.&lt;ref name=no20&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hughes, J  |author2=Coffin, JM | title = Evidence for Genomic Rearrangements Mediated by Human Endogenous Retroviruses during Primate Evolution | journal = Nat Genet | volume = 29 | issue = 4 | pages = 487–92 | year = 2001 | pmid =  11704760| doi = 10.1038/ng775 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, retroelements in general are largely prevalent in rapidly evolving, mammal-specific gene families whose function is largely related to the response to stress and external stimuli.&lt;ref name=Lagemaat03 /&gt; In particular, both human [[class I MHC|class I]] and [[class II MHC]] genes have a high density of HERV elements as compared to other multi-locus-gene families.&lt;ref name=Jern08 /&gt; It has been shown that HERVs have contributed to the formation of extensively duplicated duplicon blocks that make up the HLA class 1 family of genes.&lt;ref name=Dawkins99&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dawkins R, Leelayuwat C, Gaudieri S, Tay G, Hui J, Cattley S, Martinez P, Kulski J | title = Genomics of the major histocompatibility complex: haplotypes, duplication, retroviruses and disease | journal = Immunol Rev | volume = 167 | issue =  | pages = 275–304 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10319268 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-065X.1999.tb01399.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, HERVs primarily occupy regions within and between the break points between these blocks, suggesting that considerable duplication and deletions events, typically associated with unequal crossover, facilitated their formation.&lt;ref name=no22&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Doxiadis GG, de Groot N, Bontrop RE | title = Impact of Endogenous Intronic Retroviruses on Major Histocompatibility Complex Class II Diversity and Stability | journal = J Virol | volume = 82 | issue = 13 | pages = 6667–77 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18448532 | pmc = 2447082 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.00097-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The generation of these blocks, inherited as immunohaplotypes, act as a protective polymorphism against a wide range of antigens that may have imbued humans with an advantage over other primates.&lt;ref name=Dawkins99 /&gt;

Finally, the insertion of ERVs or ERV elements into genic regions of host DNA, or overexpression of their transcriptional variants, has a much higher potential to produce deleterious effects than positive ones. Their appearance into the genome has created a [[host-parasite coevolution|host-parasite co-evolutionary dynamic]] that proliferated the duplication and expansion of repressor genes. The most clear-cut example of this involves the rapid duplication and proliferation of tandem [[zinc-finger]] genes in mammal genomes. Zinc-finger genes, particularly those that include a KRAB domain, exist in high copy number in vertebrate genomes, and their range of functions are limited to transcriptional roles.&lt;ref name=no23&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Thomas JH, Schneider S | title = Coevolution of retroelements and tandem zinc finger genes | journal = Genome Res | volume = 21 | issue = 11 | pages = 1800–12 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21784874 | pmc = 3205565 | doi = 10.1101/gr.121749.111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown in mammals, however, that the diversification of these genes was due to multiple duplication and fixation events in response to new retroviral sequences or their endogenous copies to repress their transcription.&lt;ref name=Kovalskaya06 /&gt; The characteristic of [[placenta]]s being very evolutionary distinct organs between different species has been suggested to result from the [[co-option]] of ERV enhancers. Regulatory mutations, instead of mutations in genes that encode for [[hormone]]s and [[growth factor]]s, support the known evolution of placental morphology, especially since the majority of hormone and growth factor genes are expressed in response to pregnancy, not during placental development. Researchers studied the regulatory landscape of placental development between the rat and mouse, two closely related species. This was done by mapping all regulatory elements of the rat [[trophoblast]] [[stem cell]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (TSCs) and comparing them to their [[ortholog]]s in mouse TSCs. TSCs were observed because they reflect the initial cells that develop in the fetal placenta. Regardless of their tangible similarities, enhancer and repressed regions were mostly species-specific. However, most promoter sequences were conserved between mouse and rat. In conclusion to their study, researchers proposed that ERVs influenced species-specific placental evolution through mediation of placental growth, [[immunosuppression]], and [[cell fusion]].&lt;ref name="Chuong 325–329"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chuong|first=Edward B.|last2=Rumi|first2=M. A.

Another example of ERV exploiting cellular mechanisms is [[p53]], a [[tumor suppressor gene]] (TSG). DNA damage and cellular stress induces the p53 pathway, which results in cell [[apoptosis]]. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing, thirty-percent of all p53-binding sites were located within copies of a few primate-specific ERV families. A study suggested that this benefits retroviruses because p53's mechanism provides a rapid induction of transcription, which leads to the exit of viral RNA from the host cell.&lt;ref name=Rebollo12/&gt;

== Role in disease ==

The majority of ERVs that occur in vertebrate genomes are ancient, inactivated by mutation, and have reached genetic [[Fixation (population genetics)|fixation]] in their host species. For these reasons, they are extremely unlikely to have negative effects on their hosts except under unusual circumstances. Nevertheless, it is clear from studies in birds and non-human mammal species including mice, cats and [[Koala retrovirus|koalas]], that younger (i.e., more recently integrated) ERVs can be associated with disease. This has led researchers to propose a role for ERVs in several forms of human cancer and [[autoimmune disease]], although conclusive evidence is lacking.&lt;ref name=no1&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bannert, Norbert  |author2=Kurth, Reinhard | title = Retroelements and the human genome: New perspectives on an old relation | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 101 | issue = Suppl 2 | pages = 14572–9 |date=October 2004 | pmid = 15310846 | pmc = 521986 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0404838101 | bibcode = 2004PNAS..10114572B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nelson PN, Carnegie PR, Martin J, Davari Ejtehadi H, Hooley P, Roden D, Rowland-Jones S, Warren P, Astley J | title = Demystified . . .

In humans, ERVs have been proposed to be involved in [[multiple sclerosis]] (MS). A specific association between MS and the [[ERVWE1]], or "syncytin", gene, which is derived from an ERV insertion, has been reported, along with the presence of an "MS-associated retrovirus" (MSRV), in patients with the disease.&lt;ref&gt;

In 2004 it was reported that antibodies to HERVs were found in greater frequency in the [[Serous fluid|sera]] of people with [[schizophrenia]]. Additionally, the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] of people with recent onset schizophrenia contained levels of a retroviral marker, [[reverse transcriptase]], four times higher than control subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Yolken R | title = Viruses and schizophrenia: a focus on herpes simplex virus | journal = Herpes | volume = 11 | issue = Suppl 2 | pages = 83A–88A |date=June 2004 | pmid = 15319094 | doi =  | url = http://www.stanleylab.org/publications/VIRUSES.asp }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers continue to look at a possible link between HERVs and schizophrenia, with the additional possibility of a triggering [[Pathogenic theory of schizophrenia|infection inducing schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name="fox"&gt;{{cite web | title = The Insanity Virus | author = Fox D | url = http://discovermagazine.com/2010/jun/03-the-insanity-virus | work = [[Discover (magazine)|Discover]] | year = 2010 | accessdate = 2011-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ERVs have been found to be associated to disease not only through disease-causing relations, but also through immunity. The frequency of ERVs in long terminal repeats (LTRs) likely correlates to viral adaptations to take advantage of immunity signaling pathways that promote viral transcription and replication. A study done in 2016 investigated the benefit of ancient viral DNA integrated into a host through gene regulation networks induced by [[interferons]], a branch of innate immunity.&lt;ref name=Patience97&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Patience|first=Clive|last2=Takeuchi|first2=Yasuhiro|last3=Weiss|first3=Robin A.|date=1997-03-01|title=Infection of human cells by an endogenous retrovirus of pigs|url=http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v3/n3/abs/nm0397-282.html|journal=Nature Medicine|volume=3|issue=3|pages=282–6|doi=10.1038/nm0397-282 |pmid=9055854}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[cytokines]] are first to respond to viral infection and are also important in immunosurveillance for malignant cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Platanias|first=Leonidas C.|date=2005-05-01|title=Mechanisms of type-I- and type-II-interferon-mediated signalling|url=http://www.nature.com/nri/journal/v5/n5/full/nri1604.html|journal=Nature Reviews Immunology|volume=5|issue=5|pages=375–386|doi=10.1038/nri1604|pmid=15864272}}&lt;/ref&gt; ERVs are predicted to act as cis-regulatory elements, but much of the adaptive consequences of this for certain physiological functions is still unknown. There is data that supports the general role of ERVs in the regulation of human interferon response, specifically to [[interferon-gamma]] (IFNG). For example, interferon-stimulated genes were found to be greatly enriched with ERVs bound by signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT1) and/or [[Interferon regulatory factor]] (IRF1) in [[CD14+]] macrophages.&lt;ref name="Belshaw2004" /&gt;

Another idea proposed was that ERVs from the same family played a role in recruiting multiple genes into the same network of regulation. It was found that MER41 elements provided addition redundant regulatory enhancement to the genes located near STAT1 binding sites.&lt;ref name="Belshaw2004" /&gt;

== Role in medicine ==

=== Porcine endogenous retrovirus ===
For humans, [[porcine]] endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) pose a concern when using porcine tissues and organs in xenotransplantion, the transplanting of living cells, tissues, and organs from an organism of one species to an organism of different species. Although pigs are generally the most suitable donors to treat human organ diseases due practical, financial, safety, and ethical reasons,&lt;ref name=Patience97 /&gt; PERVs cannot be removed from pigs due to its viral nature of integrating into the host genome and being passed into offspring.  The consequences of cross-species transmission remains unexplored and has very dangerous potential.&lt;ref name=Tang16&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tang|first=H.-B.|last2=Ouyang |first2=K.|last3=Rao|first3=G.-B.|last4=Ma|first4=L.|last5=Zhong|first5=H.|last6=Bai |first6=A.|last7=Qin |first7=S. |last8=Chen|first8=F.|last9=Lin|first9=J.|date=2016-01-01|title=Characterization of Complete Genome Sequences of a Porcine Endogenous Retrovirus Isolated From China Bama Minipig Reveals an Evolutionary Time Earlier Than That of Isolates From European Minipigs |url=http://www.transplantation-proceedings.org/article/S0041-1345(15)01173-2/abstract |journal=Transplantation Proceedings |volume=48|issue=1|pages=222–8 |doi=10.1016/j.transproceed.2015.12.005 |pmid=26915872}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers indicated that infection of human tissues by PERVs is very possible, especially in immunosuppressed individuals. An immunosuppressed condition could potentially permit a more rapid and tenacious replication of viral DNA, and would later on have less difficulty adapting to human-to-human transmission. Although known infectious pathogens present in the donor organ/tissue can be eliminated by breeding pathogen-free herds, unknown retroviruses can be present in the donor. These retroviruses are often latent and asymptomatic in the donor, but can become active in the recipient. Some examples of endogenous viruses that can infect and multiply in human cells are from baboons (BaEV), cats (RD114), and mice.&lt;ref name=Patience97 /&gt;

There are three different classes of PERVs, PERV-A, PERV-B, and PERV-C. PERV-A and PERV-B are [[polytropic]] and can infect human cells in vitro, while PERV-C is [[ecotropic]] and does not replicate on human cells. The major differences between the classes is in the receptor binding domain of the ''env'' protein and the long terminal repeats (LTRs) that influence the replication of each class. PERV-A and PERV-B display LTRs that have repeats in the [[Small nucleolar RNA U3|U3]] region. However, PERV-A and PERV-C show repeatless LTRs. Researchers found that PERVs in culture actively adapted to the repeat structure of their LTR in order to match the best replication performance a host cell could perform. At the end of their study, researchers concluded that repeatless PERV LTR evolved from the repeat-harboring LTR. This was likely to have occurred from insertional mutation and was proven through use of data on LTR and ''env''/Env. It is thought that the generation of repeatless LTRs could be reflective of an adaptation process of the virus, changing from an exogenous to an endogenous lifestyle.&lt;ref name="Tönjes03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tönjes|first=Ralf R.|last2=Niebert|first2=Marcus|date=2003-11-15|title=Relative Age of Proviral Porcine Endogenous Retrovirus Sequences in Sus scrofa Based on the Molecular Clock Hypothesis|url=http://jvi.asm.org/content/77/22/12363|journal=Journal of Virology|volume=77|issue=22|pages=12363–8|doi=10.1128/JVI.77.22.12363-12368.2003|pmc=254287|pmid=14581574}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A clinical trial study performed in 1999 sampled 160 patients who were treated with different living pig tissues and observed no evidence of a persistent PERV infection in 97% of the patients for whom a sufficient amount of DNA was available to PCR for amplification of PERV sequences. This study stated that retrospective studies are limited to find the true incidence of infection or associated clinical symptoms, however. It suggested using closely monitored prospective trials, which would provide a more complete and detailed evaluation of the possible cross-species PERV transmission and a comparison of the PERV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paradis|first=Khazal|last2=Langford|first2=Gillian|last3=Long|first3=Zhifeng|last4=Heneine|first4=Walid|last5=Sandstrom|first5=Paul|last6=Switzer|first6=William M.|last7=Chapman|first7=Louisa E.|last8=Lockey|first8=Chris|last9=Onions|first9=David|date=1999-08-20|title=Search for Cross-Species Transmission of Porcine Endogenous Retrovirus in Patients Treated with Living Pig Tissue|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/285/5431/1236|journal=Science|volume=285|issue=5431|pages=1236–41|doi=10.1126/science.285.5431.1236|pmid=10455044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Human endogenous retroviruses ==

Human endogenous retroviruses (HERV) [[provirus]]es comprise a significant part of the [[human genome]], with approximately 98,000 ERV elements and fragments making up 5–8%.&lt;ref name=Belshaw2004&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Belshaw R, Pereira V, Katzourakis A, Talbot G, Paces J, Burt A, Tristem M | title = Long-term reinfection of the human genome by endogenous retroviruses | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 101 | issue = 14 | pages = 4894–9 |date=April 2004 | pmid = 15044706 | pmc = 387345 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0307800101 |bibcode = 2004PNAS..101.4894B }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study published in 2005, no HERVs capable of replication had been identified; all appeared to be defective, containing major deletions or nonsense mutations. This is because most HERVs are merely traces of original viruses, having first integrated millions of years ago.

Human endogenous retroviruses were discovered by accident using a couple of different experiments. Human genomic libraries were screened under low-stringency conditions using probes from animal retroviruses, allowing the isolation and characterization of multiple, though defective, proviruses, that represented various families. Another experiment depended on oligonucleotides with homology to viral primer binding sites.&lt;ref name="Belshaw2004" /&gt;

HERVs are classified based on their homologies to animal retroviruses. Families belong to Class I are similar in sequence to mammalian type C retroviruses. Families belonging to Class II show homology to mammalian type B and D retroviruses. For both classes, if homologies appear well conserved in the ''gag'', ''pol'', and ''env'' gene, they are grouped into a [[superfamily (molecular biology)|superfamily]]. There more Class I families known to exist.&lt;ref name="Belshaw2004" /&gt;

There are two proposals for how HERVs became fixed in the human genome. The first assumes that sometime during human evolution, exogenous progenitors of HERV inserted themselves into germ line cells and then replicated along with the host's genes using and exploiting the host's cellular mechanisms. Because of their distinct genomic structure, HERVs were subjected to many rounds of amplification and transposition, which lead to a widespread distribution of retroviral DNA. The second hypothesis claims the continuous evolution of retro-elements from more simple structured ancestors.&lt;ref name="Belshaw2004" /&gt;

Nevertheless, one family of viruses has been active since the divergence of [[human]]s and [[chimpanzee]]s. This family, termed [[HERV-K]] (HML2), makes up less than 1% of HERV elements but is one of the most studied. There are indications it has even been active in the past few hundred thousand years, e.g., some human individuals carry more copies of HML2 than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Belshaw R, Dawson AL, Woolven-Allen J, Redding J, Burt A, Tristem M | title = Genomewide Screening Reveals High Levels of Insertional Polymorphism in the Human Endogenous Retrovirus Family HERV-K(HML2): Implications for Present-Day Activity | journal = J.

A recent method, called cross-sectional dating,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jha AR, Pillai SK, York VA, Sharp ER, Storm EC, Wachter DJ, Martin JN, Deeks SG, Rosenberg MG, Nixon DF, Garrison KE | title = Cross-Sectional Dating of Novel Haplotypes of HERV-K 113 and HERV-K 115 Indicate These Proviruses Originated in Africa before Homo sapiens | journal = Mol Biol Evol | volume = 26 | issue = 11 | pages = 2617–26 |date=August 2009 | pmid = 19666991 | pmc = 2760466 | doi = 10.1093/molbev/msp180 }}&lt;/ref&gt; uses variations within a single LTR to estimate the ages of HERV insertions. This method is more precise in estimating HERV ages and can be used for any HERV insertions. Cross-sectional dating has been used to suggest that two members of HERV-K(HML2), HERV-K106 and HERV-K116, were active in the last 800,000 years and that HERV-K106 may have infected modern humans 150,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jha AR, Nixon DF, Rosenberg MG, Martin JN, Deeks SG, Hudson RR, Garrison KE, Pillai SK | title = Human Endogenous Retrovirus K106 (HERV-K106) Was Infectious after the Emergence of Anatomically Modern Humans | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = e20234 |date=May 2011 | pmid = 21633511 | pmc = 3102101 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0020234 |bibcode = 2011PLoSO...620234J }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the absence of known infectious members of the HERV-K(HML2) family, and the lack of elements with a full coding potential within the published human genome sequence, suggests to some that the family is less likely to be active at present.

MER41.AIM2 is an HERV that regulates the transcription of AIM2 (Absent in Melanoma 2) which encodes for a sensor of foreign cytosolic DNA.  This acts as a binding site for AIM2, meaning that it is necessary for the transcription of AIM2. Researchers had shown this by deleting MER41.AIM2 in HeLa cells using CRISPR/Cas9, leading to an undetectable transcript level of AIM2 in modified HeLa cells. The control cells, which still contained the MER41.AIM2 ERV, were observed with normal amounts of AIM2 transcript. In terms of immunity, researchers concluded that MER41.AIM2 is necessary for an inflammatory response to infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chuong|first=Edward B.|last2=Elde|first2=Nels C.|last3=Feschotte|first3=Cédric|date=2016-03-04|title=Regulatory evolution of innate immunity through co-option of endogenous retroviruses|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6277/1083|journal=Science|volume=351|issue=6277|pages=1083–7|doi=10.1126/science.aad5497|pmid=26941318|pmc=4887275|bibcode=2016Sci...351.1083C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a few classes of human endogenous retroviruses that still have intact open reading frames. For example, the expression of HERV-K, a biologically active family of HERV, produces proteins found in placenta. Furthermore, the expression of the envelope genes of [[HERV-W]] ([https://www.genenames.org/data/hgnc_data.php?hgnc_id=13525 ERVW-1])and [[HERV-FRD]] ([https://www.genenames.org/data/hgnc_data.php?hgnc_id=33823 ERVFRD-1]) produces syncytins which are important for the generation of the syncytiotrophoblast cell layer during placentogenesis by inducing cell-cell fusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Morozov VA, Dao Thi VL, Denner J |title=The transmembrane protein of the human endogenous retrovirus–K (HERV-K) modulates cytokine release and gene expression |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=8 |issue=8 |pages=e70399 |year=2013 |pmid=23950929 |pmc=3737193 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0070399 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0070399|bibcode=2013PLoSO...870399M }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee]] (HGNC) approves gene symbols for transcribed human ERVs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mayer|first1=J|last2=Blomberg|first2=J|last3=Seal|first3=RL|title=A revised nomenclature for transcribed human endogenous retroviral loci.|journal=Mobile DNA|date=May 4, 2011|volume=2|issue=1|pages=7|pmid=21542922|doi=10.1186/1759-8753-2-7|pmc=3113919}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques for characterizing ERVs ==

=== Whole genome sequencing ===
Example: A porcine ERV (PERV) Chinese-born [[minipig]] isolate, PERV-A-BM, was sequenced completely and along with different breeds and cell lines in order to understand its genetic variation and evolution. The observed number of nucleotide substitutions and among the different genome sequences helped researchers determine an estimate age that PERV-A-BM was integrated into its host genome, which was found to be of an evolutionary age earlier than the European-born pigs isolates.&lt;ref name=Tang16 /&gt;

=== Chromatin Immunoprecipitation with sequencing (ChIP-seq) ===
This technique is used to find histone marks indicative of promoters and enhancers, which are binding sites for DNA proteins, and repressed regions and trimethylation.&lt;ref name="Chuong 325–329"/&gt; DNA methylation has been shown to be vital to maintain silencing of ERVs in mouse somatic cells, while histone marks are vital for the same purpose in [[embryonic stem cells]] (ESCs) and early embryogenesis.&lt;ref name=Rebollo12&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rebollo|first=Rita|last2=Romanish|first2=Mark T.|last3=Mager|first3=Dixie L.|date=2012-01-01|title=Transposable Elements: An Abundant and Natural Source of Regulatory Sequences for Host Genes|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-genet-110711-155621|journal=Annual Review of Genetics|volume=46|issue=1|pages=21–42|doi=10.1146/annurev-genet-110711-155621|pmid=22905872}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Constructing phylogenies ===
Because most HERVs have no function, are selectively neutral, and are very abundant in primate genomes, they easily serve as phylogenetic markers for linkage analysis. They can be exploited by comparing the integration site polymorphisms or the evolving, proviral, nucleotide sequences of orthologs. To  estimate when integration occurred, researchers used distances from each phylogenetic tree to find the rate of molecular evolution at each particular locus.  It is also useful that ERVs are rich in many species genomes (i.e. plants, insects, mollusks, fish, rodents, domestic pets, and livestock) because its application can be used to answer a variety of phylogenetic questions.&lt;ref name="Johnson 10254–10260"/&gt;

=== Designating the age of provirus and the time points of species separation events ===
This is accomplished by comparing the different HERV from different evolutionary periods. For example, this study was done for different hominoids, which ranged from humans to apes and to monkeys. This is difficult to do with PERV because of the large diversity present.&lt;ref name="Tönjes03" /&gt;

== Further research ==

=== Epigenetic variability ===
Researchers could analyze individual epigenomes and [[transcriptomes]] to study the reactivation of dormant transposable elements through epigenetic release and their potential associations with human disease and exploring the specifics of gene regulatory networks.&lt;ref name=Rebollo12 /&gt;

=== Immunological problems of xenotransplantation ===
Little is known about an effective way to overcoming [[hyperacute rejection]] (HAR), which follows the activation of complement initiated by xenoreactive antibodies recognizing galactosyl-alpha1-3galatosyl (alpha-Gal) antigens on the donor epithelium.&lt;ref name=Patience97 /&gt;

=== Risk factors of HERVs in gene therapy ===
Because retroviruses are able to recombine with each other and with other endogenous DNA sequences, it would be beneficial for gene therapy to explore the potential risks HERVs can cause, if any. Also, this ability of HERVs to recombine can be manipulated for site-directed integration by including HERV sequences in retroviral vectors.&lt;ref name="Belshaw2004" /&gt;

=== HERV gene expression ===
Researchers believe that RNA and proteins encoded for by HERV genes should continue to be explored for putative function in cell physiology and in pathological conditions. This would make sense to examine in order to more deeply define the biological significance of protein's synthesized.&lt;ref name="Belshaw2004" /&gt;

'''Fictional locations''' are places that exist only in [[fiction]] and not in reality, such as the [[Dark Kingdom|Negaverse]] or [[Planet X]]. Writers may create and describe such places to serve as backdrop for their fictional works. Fictional locations are also created for use as settings in [[role-playing games]] such as ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]''.  They may also be used for technical reasons in actual reality for use in the development of specifications, such as the fictional country of [[Bookland]], which is used to allow [[European Article Number|EAN]] "country" codes 978 and 979 to be used for [[ISBN]] numbers assigned to books, and code 977 to be assigned for use for [[ISSN]] numbers on magazines and other [[periodical]]s.

Fictional locations vary greatly in their size. Very small places like a single room are kept out of the umbrella of fictional locations by convention, as are most single buildings. A fictional location can be the size of a university ([[Howard Phillips Lovecraft|H.P. Lovecraft]]'s [[Miskatonic University]]), a town ([[Stephen King]]'s [[Salem's Lot]]), a county ([[William Faulkner|William Faulkner's]] [[Yoknapatawpha County]]), a state ([[Winnemac (fictional U.S. state)|Winnemac]] in various [[Sinclair Lewis]] stories), a large section of continent (as in north-western [[Middle-earth]], which supposedly represents Europe), a whole planet ([[Anne McCaffrey]]'s [[Pern]]), a whole galaxy ([[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[The Foundation Series|''Foundation'']] books), even a [[multiverse]] (''[[His Dark Materials]]''). In a larger scale, occasionally the term [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]] is used, but only if it is considered a variant of Earth rather than an original world. [[Austin Tappan Wright]]'s ''[[Islandia (novel)|Islandia]]'' has an invented continent, Karain, on our world. However in [[fanfiction]], along with [[pastiche]] and/or [[parody]], it is not considered canon unless they get [[authorization|authorized]].

==Locating a story==
Within narrative prose, providing a believable location can be greatly enhanced by the provision of maps and other illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Mapping a fictional location | author=Elsa Neal | work= Fiction Writing Site | url=http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art9382.asp | accessdate=2007-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is often considered particularly true for [[fantasy novel]]s and [[historical novel]]s which often make great use of the map, but applies equally to [[science fiction]] and [[Mystery fiction|mysteries]]: earlier, in mainstream novels by [[Anthony Trollope]], [[William Faulkner]], etc. Fantasy and science fiction novels often also provide sections which provide documentation of various aspects of the environment of the fiction, including languages, character lists, cultures and, of course, locations.

In an online article on writing Dawn Arkin writes about the importance of location to the author's art:

{{quote|text=
Setting has become a very important part of most novels.

Creating a fictional location has many advantages for the writer. You get to name the town, streets, businesses, schools, etc. Everything inside your town is under your control.

Maps are an immediate necessity for some works, as they do not take place on our Earth. Writers need working maps to keep straight at a glance whether the castle is north or south of the river, and how long it takes to get between valleys. This can be very helpful in preventing snags when dealing directly with fictional geography.

{{quote|text=
Authors are as forgetful and absent-minded as the lesser breeds of humankind, and a simple precaution like taking a moment to sketch out a map helps prevent such errors and inconsistencies (upon which eagle-eyed readers are bound to swoop with gleeful cries, thereafter sitting down to write nasty letters to the poor author).

Sometimes an actual geographic corner is used as a model for "getting it right", and identifying these can become a game for readers. Authors may turn an island into a continent or vice versa, rotate orientation, or combine two similar locales to get the best (for the story) of both.

In [[computer graphics]], a '''fragment''' is the data necessary to generate a single [[pixel]]'s worth of a drawing primitive in the [[frame buffer]].  

This data may include, but is not limited to:
* [[Raster graphics|raster position]]
* [[Z-buffering|depth]]
* interpolated attributes (color, [[Texture mapping|texture coordinates]], etc.)
* [[Stencil buffer|stencil]]
* [[Alpha compositing|alpha]]
* window ID

As a scene is drawn, drawing primitives (the basic elements of graphics output, such as points, lines, circles, text etc. &lt;ref&gt;[http://baikalweb.jinr.ru/doc/cern_doc/asdoc/gks_html3/node28.html The Drawing Primitives by Janne Saarela ]&lt;/ref&gt; ) are [[Rasterisation|rasterized]] into fragments which are textured and combined with the existing frame buffer. How a fragment is combined with the data already in the frame buffer depends on various settings. In a typical case, a fragment may be discarded if it is farther away than the pixel that is already at that location (according to the [[depth buffer]]). If it is nearer than the existing pixel, it may replace what is already there, or, if [[alpha blending]] is in use, the pixel's color may be replaced with a mixture of the fragment's color and the pixel's existing color, as in the case of drawing a translucent object.

In general, a fragment can be thought of as the data needed to [[Shader|shade]] the pixel, plus the data needed to test whether the fragment survives to become a pixel (depth, alpha, stencil, scissor, window ID, etc.)

'''Gerodiversity''' is the multicultural approach to issues of aging. This approach provides a theoretical foundation for the medical and psychological treatment of older adults within an ecological context that includes their cultural identity and heritage, social environment, community, family system, and significant relationships (Iwasaki, Tazeau, Kimmel, Baker, &amp; McCallum, 2009). Gerodiversity encompasses a [[social justice]] framework, which considers the social and historical dynamics of privilege and inequality  (Iwasaki et al., 2009).  In addition to issues of aging, gerodiversity includes race, ethnicity, language, gender identity, socioeconomic status, physical ability or disability, sexual orientation, level of education, country of origin, location of residence, and religion or spirituality.

Gerodiversity builds on the field of [[Clinical Geropsychology|clinical geropsychology]], which applies psychological and developmental methods to understanding the behavioral, emotional, cognitive, and biological aspects of aging in the context of providing clinical care to older adults. The goal is to develop culturally competent, scientific methods for the psychological and medical treatment of the aging population (Iwasaki et al., 2009). According to this perspective, in order to ethically and scientifically provide optimal care to older adults, clinicians must be aware of the cultural factors in health care utilization, including use of physical and mental health care. Moreover, from this perspective, clinicians must continually work to improve their multicultural knowledge base, skill set, and attitudes towards cultural diversity.

== Demographics and characteristics to consider in geriatric populations ==
Increased awareness and attention to gerodiversity parallels the aging demography of the [[United States]]. Older adults comprise 14.5% of the U.S. population, with those aged 65 and older numbering 46.2 million (Administration on Aging [AoA], 2016). Dubbed "the Silver Tsunami", this segment of the population is rapidly growing, and the [[Administration on Aging]] expects it to double to 98 million older persons by 2060. Aging confers a unique risk of marginalization due to the intersection of advanced age and other disadvantaged factors. The domains of diversity discussed herein may intersect with age in such a way to confer a "double jeopardy" (Dowd &amp; Bengston, 1978). More recently, attention has been paid to those who face a "triple threat of marginalization" (e.g., older lesbian women; Averett, Yoon, &amp; Jenkins, 2011). As with other conceptualizations of diversity and marginalization, advanced age and other sociodemographic variables intersect and result in unique experiences for each group and individual. Below are a few highlighted areas for consideration.

== Sex and gender ==
Older adults are more likely to be female. Women live longer than men, and so populations of older adults are, with each successive age bracket, increasingly dominated by women (AoA, 2016). Over half (58%) of Americans over age 65 are women, a number which rises to 69% over age 85, and finally to 80% over age 100 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2006).

Older men and women also have different medical and psychological health needs, as well as different profiles of risk and protective factors for acquiring physical and mental disorders. Many biological and psychosocial variables are responsible for these differences. Sex-specific hormonal and physiological differences contribute to different risks for cancer, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, osteoporosis, diabetes, depression, and dementia. Environmental and lifestyle factors, such as sleeping, eating, and exercise habits, social network, socioeconomic resources and stressors, and intellectual engagement in work and leisure activities, also significantly contribute to physical and mental health, and are differentiated between older men and older women. Older women are more likely to have a robust social network—a factor associated with better physical and mental health. Older women from other countries tend to acculturate differently than elderly men (Iwasaki et al., 2009). Older women are also twice as likely to live in poverty as older men (Lee &amp; Shaw, 2008).

Cultural groups assign different roles and values to individuals based on their gender. Women in some cultural groups are less likely to have been employed, and have lower economic resources as a result (Whitbourne &amp; Whitbourne, 2013). Women are also more likely to bear most of the caregiving responsibilities for ailing family members and young children (Family Caregiver Alliance, 2003).

== Race and ethnicity ==
Ethnogeriatrics is defined by the [[American Geriatrics Society]] as the "influence of ethnicity and culture on the health the well-being of older adults" (AGS, 2016). In 2015, non-Hispanic White Americans made up an estimated 61.72% of the US population, but that percentage is anticipated to drop to 43.65% by 2060. This demographic shift will be due in part to increases in Asian and Pacific Islander and Latino/Hispanic immigrants (U.S. Census Bureau, 2015). However, Latino and Hispanic older adults as a group are expected to increase the most dramatically, by 155%  (AoA, 2016).

Older adults of different ethnicities belong to different cultural groups, and may therefore have significantly different levels of access to care, different beliefs about health and aging, different expectations from care providers, and different ways of communicating their needs (AoA, 2014). In addition, ethnic minorities are vulnerable to multiple forms of minority stress: racial prejudice, discrimination, and stereotyping may contribute to lower socioeconomic status, diminished access to care, and systematic disempowerment for many minority groups in the United States. These factors have a major impact on vulnerability to poorer health, risk of mental disorders, and poorer overall prognosis.

Individuals may also belong to multiple racial and ethnic groups: older adults may be biracial or multiracial, belong to indigenous or nonindigenous populations, or be immigrants or the children of immigrants (Kaplin, 2014). Different ethnic groups have different genetic and cultural vulnerabilities to medical and psychological problems, which require culturally knowledgeable care.

== Sexual and gender minorities ==
Sexual and gender minorities ([[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[Bisexuality|bisexual]], [[Pansexuality|pansexual]], [[transgender]], and [[nongendered]] individuals) make up an increasing portion of aging populations, and prevalence rates of these groups are expected to rise dramatically (APA, 2017). It is estimated that 1.5 million Americans over age 65 identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGBT Aging Center, 2010). Because LGBT older adults are less likely to have children and more likely to be single than heterosexual older adults, reduced family support and long-term care is available to them (Coleman &amp; Pandya, 2002). LGBT older adults also have lower rates of health insurance coverage, and fear discrimination by doctors and mental health care facilities. Among LGBT older adults, 8.3% have reported abuse by a caretaker due to sexual orientation or gender identity. Professional caregivers are also often untrained in the special needs of LGBT populations, and LGBT elders may be overlooked or ignored by many programs oriented towards older populations (Benhey, 1994; Cahill, South, &amp; Spade, 2000). The American Psychological Association offers a poignant article  about the "double-whammy discrimination" from healthcare provider biases that affect the quality of care of older LGBT patients (Clay, 2014).

Research has shown that LGBT elders tend to be unwelcome in senior centers and volunteer programs for older adults, and tend to be overlooked in public outreach programs geared towards the elderly. They also may be denied independent housing, as well as entrance to residential nursing home and retirement communities based on sexual orientation or gender identity. They may be isolated from social resources they may otherwise have had from their extended families due to discrimination. In addition, LGBT elders may still be denied visitation rights and end-of-life decision making for their partners and loved ones by hospitals (Carrington, 2004), despite the marriage equality ruling of 2015.

== Religious and/or spiritual identity ==
Older adults tend to be more deeply involved in religious activities than younger adults (Idler, 2006). Bengston, Putney, Silverstein, and Harris (2015) studied aging patterns and generation trends regarding religiosity (namely, [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]]) in the United States. Ultimately, the results indicated an overall aging effect with an upward drift in religious intensity and strength of beliefs. Additionally, there was a generational effect indicating different conceptualizations of a monotheistic God based on one's generational cohort and a greater separation between religiosity and spirituality in later-born cohorts.

In a longitudinal study Wink and Dillon (2002) found that adults increased significantly in spirituality between late middle (mid-50s to early 60s) and older adulthood (late 60s to mid-70s); this finding was irrespective of gender and generational cohort. They defined spirituality as "the self's existential search for ultimate meaning through an individualized understanding of the sacred" (p.&amp;nbsp;79; Wink &amp; Dillon, 2002).

Glicksman (2009) suggests that one be cautious when interpreting the results of research on spirituality, suggesting that measurement scales are often biased by the Protestant traditions that have shaped the American majority culture. Thus, while it is important to consider how age may impact religiosity and spirituality, it is also important to maintain a sensitive and multicultural approach to understanding an individual's unique relationship with his/her religion and how it may be impacted by other cultural variables, such as country of origin, race, and ethnicity.

Based on the research cited above, it is clear that religion and spirituality are relevant issues for older adults but that these terms may be conceptualized differently and also hold different levels of importance to different individuals. Professionals must be aware of this level of diversity when working with a geriatric population.

== Ability and disability status ==
Older adults who are aging with disabilities are yet another diverse group of individuals, with estimates of approximately 12 to 15 million older adults aging with early-onset disabilities (LaPlante, 2014). As medical and social advances increase and improve lifespan and quality of life for those with disabilities, this number will continue to grow. These individuals may experience unique stigma related to the aging process. A seminal and widely adopted definition of "successful aging" (Rowe &amp; Kahn, 1997) included growing older without disability as a hallmark of such success. However, Romo and colleagues (2012) conducted a focus group of ethnically diverse older adults with disabilities and found that despite disability, the majority felt they were aging successfully. Such individuals often employed diverse coping strategies to compensate for any changes in physical functioning. As with other groups of older adults, healthcare goals for those with disabilities emphasize reducing risk for chronic disease and preventing further disability and morbidity. However, such a narrow sense of "success" that precludes disability may limit inclusion and diversity. Like other aspects of gerodiversity and experience of marginalization, understanding an individual's sense of successful aging within the context of disability is subjective and likely varies between individuals.  Conceptualization of gerodiversity should strive toward inclusion and thus include both disability/ability status as well as subjective experiences of "successful aging", including adaptation and coping with any physical limitations.

== Socioeconomic status ==
[[Socioeconomic status]] (SES) is frequently a combined measure of income, education, and occupation. One's SES impacts one's daily life and opportunities, especially those related to quality of life and health care. The elderly in the United States are one of the most economically vulnerable groups. As of 2006, nearly 10% of the elderly in the United States lived below the poverty line (U.S. Census Bureau, 2006). An inability to work, declines in health, and the loss of a spouse are a few of the causes contributing to a lowering of one's SES as one ages. Female and racial/ethnic minority statuses are additional risk-factors for low SES in older adults. Fleck (2008) reported that approximately 23% of older African Americans and 19% of older Hispanics live in poverty; Lee and Shaw (2008) found that women are nearly twice as likely to be impoverished as males.

The [[American Psychological Association]] (2016) reports that older adults with low SES can only afford substandard levels of care, if at all, and that mortality rates are significantly higher in low SES older adults. This applies to both physical and mental health care. Additionally, older adults with lower education and/or who come from low-income environments are more likely to develop depression; these risk factors are also associated with higher incidences of Alzheimer's disease and dementia (APA, 2016). It is important to be aware of an older patient or client's resources and coping styles. Healthcare providers and other professionals working with older adults must also be aware of what their community may offer for aging individuals of low SES.

== Rural versus urban living environment ==
According to the [[National Rural Health Association]] (NRHA), the elderly make up a large percentage of the rural American population with approximately 20% of older adults living in non-metropolitan areas (Hartman &amp; Weierbach, 2013). The living environment and occupational opportunities available to rural elders impacts their health throughout their lifetime. Furthermore, their health is impacted by limited access to care for prevention, management, and treatment of physical and mental health conditions. It can be particularly difficult for elders and their families when they have difficulty completing activities of daily living and are unable to provide their own transportation.

It is important to acknowledge and maintain awareness of the obstacles to healthcare that older

individuals in rural communities face. Some older research did not find rural older adults to be disadvantaged in their use of health-related services in comparison to urban dwelling older adults (Blazer, Landerman, Fillenbaum, &amp; Horner, 1995; Krout, 1989). However, distance to providers and healthcare facilities have been cited as a common barrier among rural-dwelling Veterans (Buzza et al., 2011). While not an issue exclusive to rural locations, older adults cite difficulty traveling and lack of transportation, as well as affordability of care, as the most common barriers to utilizing psychological services (Gum, Iser, &amp; Petkus, 2010). Transportation barriers to healthcare access may be most notable for those with lower incomes (Syed, Gerber, &amp; Sharp, 2013). [[Telehealth]] (also known as [[telemedicine]]; with related specialties of [[telepsychiatry]], [[telemental health]], and [[telenursing]], to name a few ) is one such way that health care providers, researchers, and policy makers are striving to offset the physical distance and related barriers in rural health care delivery. Such provision of services using telecommunications can also be used to deliver care when patients are immobilized, have chronic conditions requiring monitoring, or are homebound.

== National identity/origins ==
An increasing number of Americans, both adults and older adults, can claim a foreign national identity. The [[Pew Research Center]] (Passel &amp; Cohn, 2008) projects that by 2050, nearly one in five Americans will be foreign born. Issues of national origin may dovetail with issues of citizenship for some older adults; the latter confers social and legal rights that interact with the experience of aging to include access to healthcare (including Medicare in the U.S.) and other social and financial welfare programs (e.g., [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]]). In addition, cultural perspectives of aging can profoundly shape one's experience of growing old. Regardless of citizenship, older adults with diverse national identities may experience the aging process differently in the U.S. compared to their country of origin. There is much variability with which cultures approach aging, frailty, and death. For some, a veneration of youth marks aging as a shameful process and likely contributes to ageism in the U.S. and other Westernized countries. However, an increasingly globalized world requires a review of theoretical frameworks and research agendas to better understand cross-cultural differences in aging attitudes (Löckenhoff et al., 2015).

== Courses of action ==
A report of the APA Committee on Aging (APA, 2009) offered overarching recommendations for fostering multicultural competencies in working with older adults. Clinicians, researchers, and others in organizations that interface with older adults are called upon to recognize and dispel ageism, both professionally and personally. Key to this is recognizing age as an element of cultural diversity. There are multiple levels at which to conceptualize gerodiversity, beginning with individual factors, and expanding to organizational, institutional, political, and societal frameworks (Iwasaki et al., 2009). The article herein emphasizes individual experiences of social inequality to consider with the acknowledgement that aging occurs in a diverse sociocultural and political milieu. Gerodiversity and multicultural competence also posits that age will intersect with other elements of diversity, with incredible variation among individuals. Above all, a gerodiversity approach emphasizes the strengths that come from cultural diversity.

Fostering such a multicultural approach to the issues of aging is a developmental process that begins with education and training and evolves over the course of one's professional and personal experiences. Molinari (2012) recommended that opportunities for education and training with older adults be available as early as high school and college. There is a dearth of healthcare workers, including psychologists and physicians, adequately trained to address the needs of the aging population. Therefore, some advocate for geriatric training as a core competency in graduate and internship programs in clinical psychology. Notably, the US [[Health Resources and Services Administration]] (HRSA) has devoted funding to preparing health care providers, including nurses, social workers, and psychologists, to better meet the needs of older adults through the Geriatric Workforce Enhancement Program.

Notably, one's development and competency in gerodiversity extends past one's formal education. Molinari (2011) urges clinicians and researchers to seek independent learning opportunities with a multicultural focus and inclusion of the geriatric population. Providers and policy makers are encouraged to provide outreach for physical and mental health care for older adults, perhaps in the context of equally diverse settings, such as faith communities. The APA Guidelines for Psychological Practice with Older Adults (2014) advises clinicians to promote evidence-based treatments shown to be effective with older populations, and seek supervision or consultation on such practice issues. Finally, from a systems perspective, a gerodiverse approach to clinical practice, research, and policy will be fostered with research on evidence-based treatment approaches for diverse older adults, as well as dissemination of such work so that the public is educated about common mental disorders in the elderly, which may eliminate stigma.  Supporting federal initiatives to train health workers in gerontology, particularly with multicultural considerations, and advocating for increased funding for research in these areas, is a crucial ongoing step.

[[File:A section of hydatoda in the leaf of Primula Sinensis.png|thumb|A section of hydathode in the leaf of ''[[Primula sinensis]]'' (''[[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]])]]
A '''hydathode''' is a type of pore, commonly found in [[angiosperm]]s, that secretes water through [[wiktionary:pore|pore]]s in the [[Epidermis (botany)|epidermis]] or leaf margin, typically at the tip of a marginal tooth or serration. Hydathodes occur in the leaves of submerged aquatic plants such as ''[[Ranunculus fluitans]]''&lt;ref name=Mortlock&gt;{{cite journal|first=C.|last=Mortlock|year=1952|title=The structure and development of the hydathodes of ''Ranunculus fluitans'' Lam.|journal=New Phytologist|volume=51|pages=129–138|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.1952.tb06121.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as herbaceous plants of drier habitats such as ''[[Campanula rotundifolia]]''.&lt;ref name=Stevensetal&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stevens| first1=C.J.|last2=Wilson |first2= J|last3= McAllister|first3= H.A.|year=2012|title=Biological Flora of the British Isles: ''Campanula rotundifolia''|journal=[[Journal of Ecology]]|volume=100|pages=821–839|DOI=10.1111/j.1365-2745.2012.01963.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are connected to the plant vascular system by a vascular bundle. Hydathodes are commonly seen in [[water lettuce]], water hyacinth, rose, balsam, and many other species.

Hydathodes are made of a group of living cells with numerous intercellular spaces filled with water, but few or no chloroplasts, and represent modified bundle-ends. These cells (called ''[[epithem]] cells''&lt;ref name="Cutter"&gt;{{cite book|first=E.G.|last=Cutter|year=1978|title=Plant Anatomy. Part 1. Cells and Tissues|publisher=Edward Arnold|location=London, U.K.|page=226–227|isbn=0713126388 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) open out into one or more sub-epidermal chambers. These, in turn, communicate with the exterior through an '''open water stoma''' or '''open pore'''. The water stoma structurally resembles an ordinary stoma, but is usually larger and has lost the power of movement. 

Hydathodes are involved in the process of [[guttation]], in which positive xylem pressure (due to root pressure) causes liquid to exude from the pores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Taiz |first1=Lincoln |last2=Zeiger |first2=Eduardo |date=2010 |title=Plant Physiology |edition=5th (International) |publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc. |pages=90 |isbn=9780878935659}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some halophytes possess glandular trichomes that actively secrete salt in order to reduce the concentration of cytotoxic inorganic ions in their cytoplasm; this may lead to the formation of a white powdery substance on the surface of the leaf.
 
Hydathodes are of two types:
# passive hydathodes, formed when a leaf vein terminates in an epithem (an area of thin-walled [[parenchyma]]).
# active hydathodes, formed when epidermal cells lose water actively.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1861">'''Hypotext''' is an earlier text which serves as the source of a subsequent piece of literature, or [[hypertext (semiotics)|hypertext]].&lt;ref name="Martin2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Bronwen|title=Key Terms in Semiotics|year=2006|publisher=Continuum|page=100|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ANBLPmfvSusC&amp;pg=PA100#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=5 August 2013|isbn=0-8264-8456-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, [[Homer]]'s [[Odyssey]] could be regarded as the hypotext for [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.

The word  was defined by the French theorist [[Gérard Genette]] as follows "Hypertextuality refers to any relationship uniting a text B (which I shall call the hypertext) to an earlier text A (I shall, of course, call it the ''hypotext''), upon which it is grafted in a manner that is not that of commentary."&lt;ref name="Genette1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Genette|first=Gérard |title=Palimpsests: Literature in the Second Degree|year=1997|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So, a hypertext derives from hypotext(s) through a process which Genette calls transformation, in which text B "evokes" text A without necessarily mentioning it directly.  The hypertext may of course become original text in its own right.&lt;ref name="Allen2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Graham|title=The New Critical Idiom|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=Ch 3: Hypertextuality.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word has more recently been used in extended ways, for example, Adamczewski suggests that the [[Iliad]] was used as a ''structuring hypotext'' in [[Mark's Gospel]].&lt;ref name="Adamczewski2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Adamczewski|first=Bartosz |title=Q Or Not Q?: The So-Called Triple, Double, and Single Traditions in the Synoptic Gospels|year=2010|publisher=Peter Lang|page=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agricultural and rural development===

Agriculture and rural development was a high priority theme with IEG since in inception. The projects under this theme are funder by the [[Ministry of Agriculture (India)|Ministry of Agriculture]], Government of India. The efforts are focussed on sustainable agricultural development with special attention on [[environmental economics]]. The studies revolve around the pattern of growth in agriculture, its sources, determinants and implications in the society and the non farm employment in rural and urban India. The researches have produced several books, journals and research papers which are available for reference with IEG library.

===Environmental and natural resources===

The theme was introduced for research in the Eighties and has gained importance over the time. Research activities on non-renewable resources such as coal, iron ore, petroleum and oil, irrigation and water management, solar, biogas and renewable energy technologies have gained momentum at the Institute. Simultaneously, forest related issues and industrial pollution are also treated as high priority subjects.

===Globalization and trade===

The principal are of work under this theme was [[transfer of technology]] and multinational enterprises which has now been expanded to cover trade and emerging issues of [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) as well. The issues emerged as a fallout of [[globalization]] such as social and economic impact and cross-border trade have also been included now for further study.

===Health economics and policy===

The theme focusses on areas of [[health economics]] in the evolving national scene and is aimed at assisting policy makers with valid research data for arriving at policies and its amendments from time to time.

===Industry and development===

The theme of Industry and development was a major one, introduced at the beginning of the Institute and covered the entire range from small industry to multinational corporations with emphasis on employment, efficiency, environment and information technology. The emphasis is on contemporary issues from a policy making perspective. Small scale industries, petroleum, cotton and jute textiles, pricing policy for cement, sugar and cotton, location of sugar and fertilizer factories, and wages and productivity in major industries have all been taken up for advanced research and resultant studies have been made available to policy makers during the past years.

===Employment, labour and informal sector===

The latest addition to the theme profile is the one related to employment, labour and [[informal sector]]. IEG has conducted a large number of researches on:
* [[labour market]], employment, [[unemployment]], underemployment and low productivity employment in the informal sector
* [[standard of living]] and [[poverty]]
* social capital, population and income mobility
* urban [[slums]], basic amenities and housing
* [[urban development]]

===Macroeconomic analysis and policy===

[[File:Pottery unit in Dharavi, Mumbai.jpg|thumb|350px|right|An integrated slum dwelling and informal economy inside Dharavi of [[Mumbai]]. [[Dharavi]] slum started in 1887 with industrial and segregationist policies of the British colonial era. The slum housing, tanneries, pottery and other economy established inside and around Dharavi during the British rule of India.&lt;ref name="Dharavi 1"&gt;{{cite book | title=Rediscovering Dharavi: stories from Asia's largest slum | publisher=Penguin | author=Sharma K. | year=2000 | pages=3–11 | isbn=978-0141000237}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pacione, Michael (2006), Mumbai, Cities, 23(3), pages 229-238&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The theme is a preferred one at IEG and attends to the macroeconomic issues related to India and other developing countries and strive to develop macro economic models suitable for India. The researches are supported by the Development Planning Centre (DPC) and the [[Reserve Bank of India]] (RBI) Endowment Unit.

===Population and human resources===

The theme was introduced by the founder of IEG, [[V. K. R. V. Rao]], in 1972. The studies undertaken under this theme are related to qualitative and quantitative evaluation of population and the development of demographic techniques for the estimation of births, deaths, [[contraception]], couple protection and women’s issues. It also studies the impact of national policies such as National Population Policy, National Health Policy, National Policy on Older persons and policies envisaged under the [[National Rural Health Mission]] on the society.

===Social change and social structure===

The theme of Social change and social structure, or in broader terms, [[sociology]], was introduced by the Asian Centre of [[UNESCO]], which was later merged with IEG, in 1967. The main areas of research are:
* comparative study of cultural and political development
* [[communalism]] and [[ethnic conflict]]
* rural transformation
* sociology of popular culture 
* emergence of professionals and other middle class elites
* dynamics of religion, [[secularism]] and modernization
* changing functions of social institutions such as the family
* contemporary media networks 
* gender relations
* social policy in respect to education, urbanisation and health
* cultural patronage 
* [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecology]] and environment

==Research units==
'''Agricultural economics unit''': The unit was established in 1961 with the aid of the [[Ministry of Agriculture (India)|Ministry of Agriculture]] to undertake studies on the various aspects of Indian agriculture.

'''Development planning centre''': Established in 1994 with the financial support in the form of an endowment, from the [[Planning Commission (India)|Planning Commission]], the unit endeavours to develop macro-economic models for forecasting the changes to assist the Government of India in policy making. The unit has collaboration arrangement with the Central Planning Bureau of Netherlands and [[Erasmus University]].

'''Environment and resource economics unit''': This unit was formed in 1998, funded by World Bank, and channeled through the [[Ministry of Environment and Forests (India)|Ministry of Environment and Forests]] under a five-year program. Later, [[Ford Foundation]] provided an endowment grant to IEG for creating a Professorial Chair in Environmental and Resource Economics. The unit concentrates on research, training, advising and networking the area of environment and resource economics.

'''Health policy research unit''': The main objectives of the unit was to broaden the spectrum of research in the field of health economics. It was established in 1998 and strives to carry out research on:
* Health and poverty
* Health issues of the elderly, adolescents and women
* Health financing
* Health insurance
* Economic Impact of HIV/AIDS, Cardiovascular Diseases
* Coordination with agencies like WTO and GATS
* Adoption of health technology
* Costing and cost-effectiveness of health interventions.
* Economics of tobacco consumption and illegal drugs

The activities of the unit are funded by [[Ministry of Health and Family Welfare]]; [[World Bank]], [[WHO]], [[UNAIDS]], [[UNDP]], [[DFID]], [[AUSAID]], [[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency|SIDA]], the [[Population Council]], the [[International AIDS Vaccine Initiative]] (IAVI), [[Center for Global Development]] (CGD), Centre for Chronic Disease Control and [[Ford Foundation]].

'''IES training section''': IES training section was started in 1968 with the principal aim of training the officers of the Indian Economic Service. IEG conducts two types of officer training programs; an induction training program for probationers of IES and the other, an in-service course for regular officers. The courses originally covered topics such as problems related to Indian economy, Economic Sociology and Institutional Aspects of Economic Development, but the course was redesigned in 2005 to include microeconomics, macroeconomics, public economics and quantitative techniques based on case studies. A brain storming section is also a part of the course.

'''Population research centre''': PRC was established in 1957 as a constituent of [[Delhi School of Economics]], on the advice of V. K. R. V. Rao, who along with Professor [[P. C. Mahalanobis]] and Professor [[D. R. Gadgil]], were members of a committee to study the development of research on population and its socio-economic impact. As per the recommendations of the committee, four ''Demographic Research Centres'' were opened of which one was hosted by IEG. This centre, in 1972, was renamed as ''Population Research Centre''. The centre focusses mainly on policy issues and planning programs.

'''RBI endowment unit''': The [[Reserve Bank of India]] granted a temporary endowment to IEG in 1979 to conduct studies on topics that is of interest to RBI such as [[money]], [[trade]], [[income]] and employment. The system was made permanent by RBI in 1991. The unit undertakes advanced research on matters related [[macroeconomics]], [[open economy]] macroeconomic issues and economic reforms with special emphasis on applied [[econometric]] and causality analysis.

'''Social change and social structure unit''': The unit is an eventual evolvement of the ''Asian Region Centre'' of [[UNESCO]] which started functioning out of IEG in 1967. When UNESCO opted out of the cooperation, the centre was downsized to form the unit, in 1974. The unit is funded by the [[Indian Council of Social Science Research]] (ICSSR).

'''VKRV Rao centre for studies in globalization''': The unit was started in 1993 with the assistance from [[Ford Foundation]] for undertaking studies on globalization, the findings of which have been brought out by IEG by way of 4 books and over 50 research papers, published in known publications such as The Journal of Development Studies, World Development, [[Journal of Development Economics]], Developing Economies, Applied Economics, Applied Economic Letters, The Journal of International Trade and Economic Development, International Business Review, Journal of Business Venturing, Transnational Corporations, World Competition, Research Policy, [[The Information Society]], Information Economics and Policy, Science Technology &amp; Development, Indian Economic Review, and [[Economic and Political Weekly]]. Presently, the unit is involved in projects under two major themes; Information Technology (IT) Software and Hardware and Role of Knowledge Sharing in the Globalization of Indian Enterprises. The centre is also conducting collaborative 
research with [[Georgetown University|Georgetown University, Washington DC]], USA, [[Institute of Developing Economies|Institute of Developing Economies, Tokyo]], Japan; [[Erasmus University Rotterdam]], The Netherlands; [[United Nations University International Institute for Software Technology|United Nations University INTECH, Maastricht]], The Netherlands and [[University of Toronto|University of Toronto, Toronto]], Canada.

The '''International Typographic Style''', also known as the '''Swiss Style''', is a [[graphic design]] style that emerged in Russia, the Netherlands, and Germany in the 1920s and was developed by designers in [[Switzerland]] during the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Lessons From Swiss Style Graphic Design – Smashing Magazine|url = http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/07/lessons-from-swiss-style-graphic-design/|website = Smashing Magazine|accessdate = 2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Typographic Style has had profound influence on graphic design as a part of the modernist movement, impacting many design-related fields including architecture and art. It emphasizes cleanness, readability, and objectivity.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1080070/International-Typographic-Style International Typographic Style]&lt;/ref&gt; Hallmarks of the style are asymmetric layouts, use of a [[Grid (graphic design)|grid]], [[sans-serif]] typefaces like [[Akzidenz Grotesk]], and [[flush left]], ragged right text. The style is also associated with a preference for photography in place of illustrations or drawings. Many of the early International Typographic Style works featured [[typography]] as a primary design element in addition to its use in text, and it is for this that the style is named.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Arts &amp; Entertainment: graphic design, [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1032864/graphic-design THE INTERNATIONAL TYPOGRAPHIC STYLE]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationalposter.com/about-poster-art/international-typographic.aspx International Poster Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt; The influences of this graphic movement can still be seen in design strategy and theory to this day.

==History==
The style emerged from a desire to represent information objectively, free from the influence of associated meaning. In 1896 the [[Berthold Type Foundry]] released its [[Akzidenz Grotesk]] Typeface in an attempt to capture an objective style, and from that point the International Typographic style evolved as a modernist graphic movement that sought to convey messages clearly and in a universally straightforward manner. Two major Swiss design schools are responsible for the early years of International Typographic Style. A graphic design technique based on grid-work that began in the 19th century became inspiration for modifying the foundational course at the [[Schule für Gestaltung Basel|Basel School of Design]] in 1908. Shortly thereafter, in 1918 Ernst Keller became a professor at the [[Kunstgewerbeschule Zürich]] and began developing a graphic design and typography course. He did not teach a specific style to his students, rather he taught a philosophy of style that dictated “the solution to the design problem should emerge from its content.”&lt;ref&gt;Meggs, P. B., Purvis, A. W., &amp; Meggs, P. B.. ''Meggs' History of Graphic Design.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2006, p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea of the solution to the design emerging from the problem itself was a reaction to previous artistic processes focused on "beauty for the sake of beauty" or "the creation of beauty as a purpose in and of itself". Keller’s work uses simple geometric forms, vibrant colors and evocative imagery to further elucidate the meaning behind each design. Other early pioneers include Théo Ballmer and [[Max Bill]].

The 1950s saw the distillation of International Typographic Style elements into sans-serif font families such as [[Univers]]. Univers paved the way for [[Max Miedinger]] and collaborator Edouard Hoffman to design the typeface Neue Haas Grotesk, which would be later renamed [[Helvetica]]. The goal with Helvetica was to create a pure typeface that could be applied to longer texts and that was highly readable. The movement began to coalesce after a periodical publication began in 1959 titled New Graphic Design, which was edited by several influential designers who played major roles in the development of International Typographic Style. The format of the journal represented many of the important elements of the style—visually demonstrating the content—and was published internationally, thus spreading the movement beyond Switzerland’s borders. One of the editors, [[Josef Müller-Brockmann]], “sought an absolute and universal form of graphic expression through objective and impersonal presentation, communicating to the audience without the interference of the designer’s subjective feelings or propagandist techniques of persuasion.”&lt;ref&gt;Meggs, P. B., Purvis, A. W., &amp; Meggs, P. B.. ''Meggs' History of Graphic Design.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2006, p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Müller-Brockmann’s feature large photographs as objective symbols meant to convey his ideas in particularly clear and powerful ways.

After World War II international trade began to increase and relations between countries grew steadily stronger. Typography and design were crucial to helping these relationships progress—clarity, objectivity, region-less glyphs, and symbols are essential to communication between international partners. International Typographic Style found its niche in this communicative climate and expanded further beyond Switzerland, to America.

One of the first American designers to integrate Swiss design with his own was [[Rudolph de Harak]].&lt;ref&gt;Meggs, P. B., Purvis, A. W., &amp; Meggs, P. B.. ''Meggs' History of Graphic Design.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2006, p. 370.&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of International Typographic Style on de Harak’s own works can be seen in his many book jacket designs for McGraw-Hill publishers in the 1960s. Each jacket shows the book title and author, often aligned with a grid—flush left, ragged-right. One striking image covers most of the jacket, elucidating the theme of the particular book. International Typographic Style was embraced by corporations and institutions in America from the 1960s on, for almost two decades. One institution particularly devoted to the style was [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]].&lt;ref&gt;Meggs, P. B., Purvis, A. W., &amp; Meggs, P. B.. ''Meggs' History of Graphic Design.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2006, p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Associated movements ==
During 1900s other design based movements were formulating, influencing and influenced by the International Typographic movement. These movements emerged within the relationships between artistic fields including architecture, literature, graphic design, painting, sculpting etc.

[[De Stijl]] was a Dutch artistic movement that saw prominence in the period between 1917-1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = .. :: The International Typographic Style Timeline :: ..|url = http://smearedblackink.com/swiss_style_timeline/|website = smearedblackink.com|accessdate = 2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referred to as neoplasticism, this artistic strategy sought to reflect a new Utopian ideal of spiritual harmony and order. It was a form of pure abstraction through reduction to the essentials of form and colour, employing vertical and horizontal layouts using only black and white and primary colors. Proponents of this movement included painters like [[Piet Mondrian]], Vilmes Huszar and Bart van der Hoff as well as architects like [[Gerrit Rietveld]], [[Robert van 't Hoff|Robert van't Hoff]] and [[Jacobus_Oud|J.J.P. Oud]].

[[Bauhaus]] was a German-based movement that emphasized purity of geometry, absence of ornamentation and the motto 'form follows function'. This was a school of thought that combined craftsmaking with the fine arts and was founded by [[Walter Gropius]]. The goal was to work towards the essence of the form follows function relationship to facilitate a style that could be applied to all design problems; the International Style.

[[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] was an art/architectural philosophy that emerged from Russia in 1920s. The style develops by assorted mechanical objects that are combined into abstract mobile structural forms. Hallmarks of the movement include geometric reduction, photo-montage and simplified palettes.

[[Suprematism]], which arose in 1913, is another Russian art movement similarly focused on the simplification and purity of geometric forms to speak to values of spirituality.

All of these movements including the International Typographic styles are defined by reductionist purity as a visually compelling strategy of conveying messages through geometric and color based hierarchies.

== Notes on theory ==
The Bauhaus mantra of 'form follows function' applies to design in the spirit of the International Typographic movement. The movement was structured by focusing on detail, precision, craft skill, systems of education and approach, technical training, high standards of print and the innovative application of lettering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Swiss Style: The Principles, the Typefaces &amp; the Designers - Print Magazine|url = http://www.printmag.com/typography/swiss-style-principles-typefaces-designers/|website = Print Magazine|accessdate = 2015-12-12|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory revolves around critically approaching the development of a system specific to the design problem presented.

For example, a father of the style Ernst Keller argued that a design solution should always be respectful of its content.

A good comparison is the structure that defines a math problem. You only use specific equations for specific types of problems. You similarly only can work through these equations in specific ways. With the International Typographic and other related philosophies, a design context is critical to deriving a response.

==Characteristics of style==
Each design done with International Typographic Style in mind begins with a mathematical grid, because a grid is the “most legible and harmonious means for structuring information.”&lt;ref&gt;Meggs, P. B., Purvis, A. W., &amp; Meggs, P. B.. ''Meggs' History of Graphic Design.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2006, p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt; Text is then applied, most often aligned flush left, ragged right. Fonts chosen for the text are sans serif, a type style believed to “[express] the spirit of a more progressive age” by early designers in the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Meggs, P. B., Purvis, A. W., &amp; Meggs, P. B.. ''Meggs' History of Graphic Design.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2006, p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt; Objective photography is another design element meant to present information clearly, and without any of the persuading influences of propaganda or commercial advertising. Such a strong focus on order and clarity is drawn from early pioneers of the movement believing that design is a “socially useful and important activity... the designers define their roles not as artists but as objective conduits for spreading important information between components of society.” &lt;ref&gt;Meggs, P. B., Purvis, A. W., &amp; Meggs, P. B.. ''Meggs' History of Graphic Design.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2006, p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kingdom of Mapungubwe''' (1075–1220) was a pre-colonial state in Southern Africa located at the confluence of the [[Shashe River|Shashe]] and [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]] rivers, south of [[Great Zimbabwe]]. The name is derived from either Venda or Shona. The name may mean "Hill of Jackals".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sahistory.org.za/article/mapungubwe&lt;/ref&gt; The kingdom was the first stage in a development that would culminate in the creation of the [[Kingdom of Zimbabwe]] in the 13th century, and with gold trading links to [[Rhapta]] and [[Kilwa Kisiwani]] on the African east coast. The Kingdom of Mapungubwe lasted about 80 years, and at its height its population was about 5000 people. The Mapungubwe Collection is a museum collection of artifacts found at the archaeological site and is housed in the [[Mapungubwe Museum]] in [[Pretoria]].

This archaeological site can be attributed to the Bukalanga Kingdom, which comprises the [[Kalanga people|Bakalanga people]] from northeast Botswana, the Karanga from Western Zimbabwe, the Vha Venda in the northeast of South Africa. They were the first Bantu to cross the Limpopo River to the south, and established their kingdom where the Shashe and Limpopo conjoined (Sha-limpo).
[[File:MapungubweHill.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|none|Mapungubwe Hill]]

==Origin==
The largest settlement from what has been dubbed the [[Leopard's Kopje]] culture is known as K2 culture and was the immediate predecessor to the settlement of Mapungubwe.&lt;ref&gt;Hrbek, page 322&lt;/ref&gt; The people from K2 culture, probably derived from the ancestral [[Khoi]] culture, were attracted to the Shashi-Limpopo area, likely because it provided mixed agricultural possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Hrbek, page 323&lt;/ref&gt; The area was also prime elephant country, providing access to valuable ivory. The control of the gold and [[ivory trade]] greatly increased the political power of the K2 culture.&lt;ref&gt;Hrbek, page 326&lt;/ref&gt; By 1075, the population of K2 had outgrown the area and relocated to Mapungubwe Hill.&lt;ref name="Hrbek, page 324"&gt;Hrbek, page 324&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stone masonry==
Spatial organisation in the kingdom of Mapungubwe involved the use of stone walls to demarcate important areas for the first time. There was a stone-walled residence likely occupied by the principal councillor.&lt;ref name="Hrbek, page 325"&gt;Hrbek, page 325&lt;/ref&gt; Stone and wood were used together. There would have also been a wooden palisade surrounding Mapungubwe Hill. Most of the capital's population would have lived inside the western wall.&lt;ref name="Hrbek, page 325"/&gt;

==Origins of the name==
[[file:Bateleur Eagle with Kill.jpg|thumb|right|The name may derive from the Shona word for [[Bateleur eagle]]]]
The capital of the kingdom was called Mapungubwe, which is where the kingdom gets its name.&lt;ref name="Hrbek, page 324"/&gt; The site of the city is now a [[World Heritage Site]], [[National heritage sites (South Africa)|South African National Heritage Site]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=9/2/240/0001 - Mapungubwe Archaeological Site, Greefswald, Messina District |url=http://www.sahra.org.za/content/922400001 |publisher=[[South African Heritage Resources Agency]] |accessdate=16 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819081731/http://www.sahra.org.za/content/922400001 |archivedate=19 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[national park]], and archaeological site. There is controversy regarding the origin and meaning of the name ''Mapungubwe''. Conventional wisdom has it that Mapungubwe means "place of Jackals," or alternatively, "place where Jackals eat", thavha ya dzi phunguhwe, or, according to Fouché—one of the earliest excavators of Mapungubwe—"hill of the jackals" (Fouché, 1937 p.&amp;nbsp;1). It also means "place of wisdom" and "the place where the rock turns into liquid"—from various ethnicities in the region including the Pedi, Sotho, Venda and Shona.

In [[Shona language|Shona]], the language spoken in Zimbabwe, the word ''mapungu'' is the plural form of the word ''chapungu'', denoting the [[bateleur]] eagle, which is widely believed to be the model for the Zimbabwean birds that once graced the massive Great Zimbabwe royal complex. The ending "bwe" is a diminutive of the word "ibwe,"  which means stone or rock in Shona language. Mapungubwe, in this respect, means the 'rocks of the bateleur eagles'—an indication that there were many bateleurs in the area or location. Chapungu Village in [[Harare]], Zimbabwe's capital, which showcases the country's arts and sculpture traditions, is a tribute to the spirit of the bateleur, a bird which has deep religious connotations in Shona culture.The word Mapungubwe may also have originated from the Shona word ''mhungu'' which means ''black mamba'', the plural of mhungu is ''mapungu''. Mapungubwe is then a diminutive for ''ibwe re mapungu'' which refers to a rocky area where the black mamba snakes are a common sight. It is not uncommon practice in Zimbabwe to shorten phrases with a solid word as is the case with the name Zimbabwe itself which was diminished from ''dzimba dzemabwe''(house of stone), Great Zimbabwe. These rocky places are found throughout Zimbabwe, in Chikomba district under Chief Chandiwana there exists one of the imposing rocky plateaus called Maringobwe which refers to ''ibwe remaringo''. Kuringa is a verb which means ''to look'' in the Zezuru dialect of the Shona people. This suggests the elevated place may have been used for surveillance of the surrounding areas, numerous rock paintings credited to the nomadic hunter gatherer bushmen or ''Khoisan'' who roamed the area before ''Bantu'' migration are a common sight.

==Culture and society==
Mapungubwean society is thought by archaeologists to be the first class-based social system in southern Africa; that is, its leaders were separated from and higher in rank than its inhabitants. Thovhele Shiriyadenga Nemapungubwe was the king (Thovhele in Venda) of Mapungubwe. He later divided his state into districts that were then given and ruled by his children who then became Paramount Chiefs, who had to report to the king himself. Mapungubwe's architecture and spatial arrangement also provide "the earliest evidence for sacred leadership in southern Africa".&lt;ref name="web.wits.ac.za"&gt;[http://web.wits.ac.za/nr/rdonlyres/33e48eb0-29e9-49ec-a296-5daaa4aacc5a/0/evolution.pdf Origin of Species and Evolution, Wits University Showcase]&lt;/ref&gt;

Life in Mapungubwe was centred on family and farming. Special sites were created for initiation ceremonies, household activities, and other social functions. Cattle lived in [[kraal]]s located close to the residents' houses, signifying their value.

Most speculation about society continues to be based upon the remains of buildings, since the Mapungubweans left no written record.

The kingdom was likely divided into a three-tiered hierarchy with the commoners inhabiting low-lying sites, district leaders occupying small hilltops, and the capital at Mapungubwe hill as the supreme authority.&lt;ref name="Hrbek, page 325"/&gt;  
Elites within the kingdom were buried in hills. Royal wives lived in their own area away from the king. Important men maintained prestigious homes on the outskirts of the capital. This type of spatial division occurred first at Mapungubwe but would be replicated in later [[Kingdom of Butua|Butua]] and [[Rozwi]] states.&lt;ref name="Hrbek, page 324"/&gt; The growth in population at Mapungubwe may have led to full-time specialists in ceramics, specifically pottery. Gold objects were uncovered in elite burials on the royal hill (Mapungubwe hill).&lt;ref name="Hrbek, page 325"/&gt;

==Re-discovery==
On New Year's Eve 1932, ESJ&amp;nbsp;van Graan, a local farmer and prospector, and his son, a former student of the [[University of Pretoria]], set out to follow up on a legend he had heard about.

According to an article published in 1985, translated from the Afrikaans text: Remains of a Rock Fort located on top of the hill were under investigation, dated back to the 11th century. The Archeological site is closed to the public, except for supervised visits and tours. However some of the items discovered were on display at the Department of Archeology, at the University of Pretoria. Mapungubwe Hill and K2 were declared national monuments in the 1980s by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanparks.org/parks/mapungubwe/tourism/progress.php |title=Mapungubwe National Park and World Heritage Site: History of the Park |publisher=SANParks |accessdate=17 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Two years later Muhammad Muaaz Vawda discovered a grave.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Burials at Mapungubwe Hill==
At least twenty four skeletons were unearthed on Mapungubwe hill but only eleven were available for analysis, with the rest disintegrating upon touch or as soon as they were exposed to light and air. Most of the skeletal remains were buried with few or no accessories with most adults buried with glass beads. Two adult burials (labeled numbers 10 and 14 by the early excavators) as well as one unlabelled skeleton (referred to as the original gold burial)&lt;ref&gt;A. Duffey 2012. Mapungubwe: Interpretation of the Gold Content of the Original Gold Burial M1, A620. [http://www.african-archaeology.de/index.php?page_id=154&amp;journal_id=33&amp;pdf_id=262 Journal of African Archaeology 10 (2), 2012, pages 175–187.]&lt;/ref&gt; were associated with gold artefacts and were unearthed from the so-called grave area upon Mapungubwe hill. Recent genetic studies found these first two skeletons to be of Khoi/San descent and thought to be a king and queen of Mapungubwe{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}. Despite this latest information the remains were all buried in the traditional Bantu burial position (sitting with legs drawn to the chest, arms folded round the front of the knees) and they were facing west. The Skeleton numbered 10, a male, was buried with his hand grasping the golden Scepter.

The skeleton labelled number 14 (female) was buried with at least 100 gold wire bangles around her ankles and there were at least one thousand gold beads in her grave. The last gold burial (male), who was most probably the King, was buried with a headrest and three objects made of gold foil tacked onto a wooden core, depicting a bowl, scepter and rhino. At least two more rhino were in the sample, but their association with a specific grave is unknown.

In 2007, the South African Government gave the green light for the skeletal remains that were excavated back in 1933 to be reburied on Mapungubwe hill in a ceremony that took place on 20 November 2007.

The Mapungubwe Landscape was declared a World Heritage Site on 3 July 2003.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3105">In [[mathematics]], the '''map segmentation''' problem is a kind of [[optimization problem]]. It involves a certain geographic region that has to be partitioned into smaller sub-regions in order to achieve a certain goal. Typical optimization objectives include:&lt;ref name=rag14&gt;{{cite book | url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1614472017 | title=Geometric Partitioning Algorithms for Fair Division of Geographic Resources | publisher=A Ph.D. thesis submitted to the faculty of university of Minnesota | author=Raghuveer Devulapalli (Advisor: John Gunnar Carlsson) | year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Minimizing the workload of a fleet of vehicles assigned to the sub-regions;
* Balancing the consumption of a resource, as in [[fair cake-cutting]].
* Determining the optimal locations of supply depots;
* Maximizing the surveillance coverage.

Fair division of land has been an important issue since ancient times, e.g. in [[ancient Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.2307/147876|jstor=147876|title=Urban and Rural Land Division in Ancient Greece|journal=Hesperia|volume=50|issue=4|pages=327|year=1981|last1=Boyd|first1=Thomas D.|last2=Jameson|first2=Michael H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notation ==
There is a geographic region denoted by C ("cake").

A partition of C, denoted by X, is a list of disjoint subregions whose union is C:
:&lt;math&gt;C = X_1\sqcup\cdots\sqcup X_n&lt;/math&gt;

There is a certain set of additional parameters (such as: obstacles, fixed points or probability density functions), denoted by P.

There is a real-valued function denoted by G ("goal") on the set of all partitions.

The map segmentation problem is to find:
:&lt;math&gt;\arg\min_X G(X_1,\dots,X_n \mid P)&lt;/math&gt;
where the minimization is on the set of all partitions of C.

Often, there are geometric shape constraints on the partitions, e.g., it may be required that each part be a [[convex set]] or a [[connected set]] or at least a [[measurable set]].

== Examples ==
1. '''Red-blue partitioning''': there is a set &lt;math&gt;P_b&lt;/math&gt; of blue points and a set &lt;math&gt;P_r&lt;/math&gt; of red points. Divide the plane into &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; regions such that each region contains approximately a fraction &lt;math&gt;1/n&lt;/math&gt; of the blue points and &lt;math&gt;1/n&lt;/math&gt; of the red points. Here:
* The cake ''C'' is the entire plane &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;;
* The parameters ''P'' are the two sets of points;
* The goal function ''G'' is
:: &lt;math&gt;G(X_1,\dots,X_n) := \max_{i\in \{1,\dots, n\}} \left( \left |\frac{|P_b\cap X_i| - |P_b|} n \right| + \left| \frac{|P_r\cap X_i| - |P_r|} n\right| \right).&lt;/math&gt;
: It equals 0 if each region has exactly a fraction &lt;math&gt;1/n&lt;/math&gt; of the points of each color.

== Related problems ==
* A [[Voronoi diagram]] is a specific type of map-segmentation problem.
* [[Fair cake-cutting]], when the cake is two-dimensional, is another specific map-segmentation problem when the cake is two-dimensional, like in the [[Hill–Beck land division problem]].
* The [[Stone–Tukey theorem]] is related to a specific map-segmentation problem.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2202">The term '''social mechanisms''' and [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]]-based explanations of social phenomenon originate from the [[philosophy of science]]. 

The core thinking behind the mechanism approach has been expressed as follows by [[Jon Elster|Elster]] (1989: 3-4): “To explain an event is to give an account of why it happened. Usually… this takes the form of citing an earlier event as the cause of the event we want to explain…. [But] to cite the cause is not enough: the causal mechanism must also be provided, or at least suggested.”

Existing definitions differ a great deal from one another, but underlying them all is an emphasis on making intelligible the regularities being observed by specifying in detail how they were brought about. The currently most satisfactory discussion of the mechanism concept is found in Machamer, Darden and Craver (2000). Following them, mechanisms can be said to consist of entities (with their properties) and the activities that these entities engage in, either by themselves or in concert with other entities. These activities bring about change, and the type of change brought about depends upon the properties and activities of the entities and the relations between them. A mechanism, thus defined, refers to a constellation of entities and activities that are organized such that they regularly bring about a particular type of outcome, and we explain an observed outcome by referring to the mechanism by which such outcomes are regularly brought about (see also [[Peter Hedstrom|Hedström]] and Ylikoski 2010).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1449">'''Methodical culturalism''' is a philosophical approach developed by [[Peter Janich]] and his pupils. The core statement of this approach is that [[science]] is not developed from purely theoretical considerations, but as a development of  everyday, [[proto-scientific]] human behavior. That is to say, science is a stylized form of everyday knowledge-forming practice.

Thus, from the viewpoint of methodical culturalism, science is understood as a continuation of the practical processes of the everyday world and must be analyzed from this aspect systematically and methodically.

Methodical culturalism is a development of the [[methodical constructivism]] of the [[Erlanger school]] (known as "[[Erlanger constructivism]]").

The '''''Millennium Star Atlas''''' was constructed as a collaboration between 
a team at ''[[Sky &amp; Telescope]]'' led by Roger Sinnott, and the European Space Agency's [[Hipparcos]] project, led by [[Michael Perryman]]. This 1997 work was the first [[uranography|sky atlas]] to include the ''Hipparcos'' and ''Tycho Catalogue'' data, extending earlier undertakings in terms of completeness and uniformity to a magnitude limit of around 10–11 [[Apparent magnitude|magnitude]].  It appeared as a stand-alone publication,&lt;ref&gt;

and as three volumes of the 17-volume ''[[Hipparcos Catalogue]]''.

The 1548 charts include one million [[star]]s from the Hipparcos and Tycho-1 Catalogues, three times as many as in any previous all-sky atlas; more than 8000 [[Galaxy|galaxies]] with their orientation; outlines of many [[Bright nebula|bright]] and [[dark nebula]]e; the location of many [[Open cluster|open]] and [[globular cluster]]s; and some 250 of the brightest [[quasar]]s. The non-stellar objects in the atlas are identified by type and designation. The chart scale is 100 arcsec/mm, matching that at the focus of an 8-inch f/10 [[Schmidt-Cassegrain]]. Star magnitudes are essentially [[UBV photometric system|Johnson V]]. Distance labels are given for stars within 200 light-years of the Sun.
Proper motion arrows are given for stars with motions exceeding 0.2 arcsec/yr.  Variable stars are indicated by amplitude and variability type. Many thousands of already known and newly discovered
double stars are depicted with tick marks indicating separation and position angle.

Other major celestial atlases since 1997 have also incorporated the ''Hipparcos'' and ''Tycho Catalogue'' data.  These include ''Sky Atlas 2000.0'' (2nd edition to 8.5 mag),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Monte Cristi Pipe Wreck''' is a submerged [[archaeological]] site located off the north coast of [[Hispaniola]] in the [[Dominican Republic]] near the border of [[Haiti]], part of the [[Greater Antilles]] in the [[Caribbean]]. The site is one of the hundreds of historic shipwrecks that lie on the ocean floor between [[San Fernando de Monte Cristi|Monte Cristi]] and [[San Felipe de Puerto Plata|Puerto Plata]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeological evidence indicates that the shipwreck is one of a merchant trader, probably sinking in the second half of the 17th century. Hispanola, together with [[Jamaica]], was originally settled by adventurous men seeking the life of a [[buccaneer]], and until the 18th century, these islands thrived through [[piracy]] rather than through growing sugar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

This wreck is known as the "Pipe Wreck" because of the large number of [[Smoking pipe (tobacco)#Clay|clay smoking pipes]] it carried as [[cargo]], the type of long pipe the indigenous inhabitants used to smoke tobacco that was a shaped cane and called ''tobago''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Five large masses are visible, covered by a layer of [[calcium carbonate]]. Three of the objects seem to be combinations of iron and copper-alloy, and two appear to be solid slabs of iron.

'''Neo-conceptual art''' describes art practices in the 1980s and particularly 1990s to date that derive from the [[conceptual art]] movement of the 1960s and 1970s.  These subsequent initiatives have included the [[Moscow Conceptualists]], United States neo-conceptualists such as [[Sherrie Levine]] and the [[Young British Artists]], notably [[Damien Hirst]] and [[Tracey Emin]] in the [[United Kingdom]], where there is also a [[Stuckism]] counter-movement and criticism from the 1970s conceptual art group [[Art and Language]].

==History==

[[File:Neon-bolognini.JPG|thumb|right|170 px|[[Maurizio Bolognini]]'s ''Programmed Machines'' (''Sealed'')  hundreds of computers are programmed to generate endless flows of random images which nobody would see. &lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Many of the concerns of the "conceptual art" movement proper have been taken up by many contemporary artists since the initial wave of conceptual artists. While many of these artists may not term themselves "conceptual artists", ideas such as anti-commodification, social and/or political critique, [[digital art]], and ideas/information as medium continue to be aspects of contemporary art, especially among artists working with [[computer art]], [[installation art]], [[performance art]], [[net.art]] and [[electronic art]]. Many critics and artists may speak of conceptual aspects of a given artist or art work, reflecting the enduring influence that many of the original conceptual artists have had on the art world.

==New York City==
The idea of neo-conceptual art (sometimes later termed [[post-conceptual art]]) in the United States was clearly articulated by [[Tricia Collins]] and [[Richard Milazzo]] (working as a team called: Collins &amp; Milazzo) in the early 1980s in New York City,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/19/arts/art-now-on-view-new-work-by-freelance-curators.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm ART; Now on View, New Work by Freelance Curators]&lt;/ref&gt; when they brought to prominence a whole new generation of artists through their copious writings and curatorial activity. It was their exhibitions and writings that originally fashioned the theoretical context for a new kind of neo (or post) conceptual art; one that argued simultaneously against [[Neo-Expressionism]] and Picture-Theory Art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/DAN+CAMERON+ON+Collins+%26+Milazzo.-a057475774] DAN CAMERON ON Collins &amp; Milazzo&lt;/ref&gt; It was through this context that the work of many of the artists associated with Neo-Conceptualism (or what some of the critics reductively called “Simulationism” and “Neo Geo”) was first brought together: artists such as [[Ross Bleckner]], [[James Welling]], [[Steven Parrino]], [[Richard Prince]], [[Peter Nagy (artist)|Peter Nagy]], [[Joseph Nechvatal]], [[Sarah Charlesworth]], [[Mark Innerst]], [[Allan McCollum]], [[Peter Halley]], [[Jonathan Lasker]], [[Haim Steinbach]], [[Philip Taaffe]], [[Robert Gober]] and [[Saint Clair Cemin]].

==Moscow==
The [[Moscow Conceptualists]], in the 1970s and 80s, attempted to subvert socialist ideology using the strategies of [[conceptual art]] and [[appropriation art]]. The central figures were [[Ilya Kabakov]] and [[Komar and Melamid]]. The group also included [[Eric Bulatov]] and [[Viktor Pivovarov]].

==London==
The [[Young British Artists]] (YBAs), led by [[Damien Hirst]], came to prominence in the 1990s and their work was described at the time as neo-conceptual,&lt;ref&gt;Scott Lash and Celia Lury, ''Global Culture Industries: The Mediation of Things'', Polity, 2007, p211. {{ISBN|0-7456-2483-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though it relies very heavily on the art object to make its impact. The term is used in relation to them on the basis that the object is not the artwork, or is often a [[Found art|found object]], which has not needed artistic skill in its production. [[Tracey Emin]] is seen as a leading YBA and a neo-conceptualist, even though she has denied that she is and has emphasised personal emotional expression. Charles Harrison, a member of the conceptual art group [[Art and Language]] in the 1970s, criticizes the neo-conceptual art of the 1990s as conceptual art "without threat or awkwardness"&lt;ref&gt;Charles Harrison, ''Essays on Art &amp; Language'', MIT Press, 2001, p29. {{ISBN|0-262-58241-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a "vacant" prospect.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Harrison, ''Essays on Art &amp; Language'', MIT Press, 2001, p241. {{ISBN|0-262-58241-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable artists associated with neo-conceptualism in the UK include [[Martin Creed]], [[Liam Gillick]], [[Bethan Huws]], [[Simon Patterson (artist)|Simon Patterson]], [[Simon Starling]] and [[Douglas Gordon]].

==Notable events==
1991: [[Charles Saatchi]] funds Damien Hirst and the next year in the [[Saatchi Gallery]] exhibits his ''[[The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living]]'', a shark in formaldehyde in a vitrine.

1993: [[Vanessa Beecroft]] holds her first performance in Milan, Italy, using models to act as a second audience to the display of her diary of food.

1999: [[Tracey Emin]] is nominated for the [[Turner Prize]]. Part of her exhibit is ''My Bed'', her dishevelled bed, surrounded by detritus such as condoms, blood-stained knickers, bottles and her bedroom slippers.

2001: [[Martin Creed]] wins the Turner Prize for ''The Lights Going On and Off'', an empty room where the lights go on and off.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/1698032.stm BBC Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

2005: [[Simon Starling]] wins the Turner Prize for ''Shedboatshed'', a wooden shed which he had turned into a boat, floated down the Rhine and turned back into a shed again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1905555,00.html ''The Times'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy in the UK==
In [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the rise to prominence of the [[Young British Artists]] (YBAs) after the 1988 ''[[Freeze (exhibition)|Freeze]]'' show, curated by Damien Hirst, and subsequent promotion of the group by the [[Saatchi Gallery]] during the 1990s, generated a media backlash, where the phrases "conceptual art" and "neo-conceptual" came to be terms of derision applied to much [[contemporary art]]. This was amplified  by the [[Turner Prize]] whose more extreme nominees (most notably Hirst and Emin) caused a controversy annually.

[[File:Stuckists Death of Conceptual Art demo (3).jpg|thumb|right|170 px|[[Stuckism|Stuckists']] "Death of Conceptual Art" coffin demonstration, 2002]]
The [[Stuckism|Stuckist]] group of artists, founded in 1999, proclaimed themselves "pro-contemporary figurative painting with ideas and anti-conceptual art, mainly because of its lack of concepts." They also called it pretentious, "unremarkable and boring" and on July 25, 2002 deposited a coffin outside the [[White Cube]] gallery, marked "The Death of Conceptual Art".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/Tate/WhiteCube.html "White Cube Demo 2002"], stuckism.com. Retrieved 19 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cripps, Charlotte.

Retrieved from findarticles.com, 7 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; They staged yearly demonstrations outside the Turner Prize.

In 2002, [[Ivan Massow]], the Chairman of the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] branded conceptual art "pretentious, self-indulgent, craftless tat" and in "danger of disappearing up its own arse ... led by cultural tsars such as the [[Tate Gallery|Tate]]'s Sir [[Nicholas Serota]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,3604,634797,00.html ''The Guardian'']&lt;/ref&gt; Massow was consequently forced to resign. At the end of the year, the Culture Minister, [[Kim Howells]] (an art school graduate) denounced the Turner Prize as "cold, mechanical, conceptual bullshit".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/11/01/nart01.xml ''The Daily Telegraph'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2004 the [[Saatchi Gallery]] told the media that "painting continues to be the most relevant and vital way that artists choose to communicate."&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Nigel 2004 [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/10/02/nsaat02.xml "Saatchi's latest shock for the art world is &amp;ndash; painting"] ''The Daily Telegraph'' 10 February 2004. Accessed  April 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Following this [[Charles Saatchi]] began to sell prominent works from his YBA collection.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8564">[[File:KCL.png|framed|Kirchhoff's current law is the basis of nodal analysis.]]
In electric circuits analysis, '''nodal analysis''', '''node-voltage analysis''', or the '''branch current method''' is a method of determining the voltage ([[potential difference]]) between "[[Node (circuits)|nodes]]" (points where elements or branches connect) in an [[electrical circuit]] in terms of the branch currents.

In analyzing a circuit using [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws]], one can either do nodal analysis using Kirchhoff's current law (KCL) or [[mesh analysis]] using Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL). Nodal analysis writes an equation at each [[Node (circuits)|electrical node]], requiring that the branch currents incident at a node must sum to zero. The branch currents are written in terms of the circuit node voltages. As a consequence, each branch constitutive relation must give current as a function of voltage; an [[admittance]] representation. For instance, for a resistor, I&lt;sub&gt;branch&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;branch&lt;/sub&gt; * G, where G (=1/R) is the admittance (conductance) of the resistor.

Nodal analysis is possible when all the circuit elements' branch constitutive relations have an admittance representation. Nodal analysis produces a compact set of equations for the network, which can be solved by hand if small, or can be quickly solved using linear algebra by computer. Because of the compact system of equations, many [[circuit simulation]] programs (e.g. [[SPICE]]) use nodal analysis as a basis. When elements do not have admittance representations, a more general extension of nodal analysis, [[modified nodal analysis]], can be used.

== Method ==
# Note all connected wire segments in the circuit. These are the ''nodes'' of nodal analysis.
# Select one node as the ground reference. The choice does not affect the result and is just a matter of convention. Choosing the node with the most connections can simplify the analysis. For a circuit of  ''N'' nodes the number of nodal equations is ''N''−1.
# Assign a variable for each node whose voltage is unknown. If the voltage is already known, it is not necessary to assign a variable.
# For each unknown voltage, form an equation based on Kirchhoff's current law. Basically, add together all currents leaving from the node and mark the sum equal to zero. Finding the current between two nodes is nothing more than "the node with the higher potential, minus the node with the lower potential, divided by the resistance between the two nodes."
# If there are voltage sources between two unknown voltages, join the two nodes as a [[supernode (circuit)|supernode]]. The currents of the two nodes are combined in a single equation, and a new equation for the voltages is formed.
# Solve the system of [[simultaneous equations]] for each unknown voltage.

[[Image:Nodal_analysis.svg|thumb|right|280px|Basic example circuit with one unknown voltage, V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.]]

The only unknown voltage in this circuit is V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. There are three connections to this node and consequently three currents to consider. The direction of the currents in calculations is chosen to be away from the node.
# Current through resistor R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;: (V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;) / R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
# Current through resistor R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; / R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
# Current through current source I&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;: -I&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
With Kirchhoff's current law, we get:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{V_1 - V_S}{R_1} + \frac{V_1}{R_2} - I_S = 0&lt;/math&gt;

This equation can be solved with respect to V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;V_1 = \frac{\left( \frac{V_S}{R1} + I_S \right)}{\left( \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} \right)}&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, the unknown voltage can be solved by substituting numerical values for the symbols. Any unknown currents are easy to calculate after all the voltages in the circuit are known.

&lt;math&gt;V_1 = \frac{\left( \frac{5\text{ V}}{100\,\Omega} + 20\text{ mA} \right)}{\left( \frac{1}{100\,\Omega} + \frac{1}{200\,\Omega} \right)} = \frac{14}{3}\text{ V}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Supernodes ===
[[Image:Supernode_in_circuit_analysis.svg|thumb|right|182px|In this circuit, V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is between two unknown voltages, and is therefore a supernode.]] In this circuit, we initially have two unknown voltages, V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The voltage at V&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is already known to be V&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; because the other terminal of the voltage source is at ground potential.

The current going through voltage source V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; cannot be directly calculated. Therefore, we cannot write the current equations for either V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; or V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. However, we know that the same current leaving node V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; must enter node V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Even though the nodes cannot be individually solved, we know that the combined current of these two nodes is zero. This combining of the two nodes is called the [[supernode (circuit)|supernode]] technique, and it requires one additional equation: V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;.

The complete set of equations for this circuit is:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
\frac{V_1 - V_\text{B}}{R_1} + \frac{V_2 - V_\text{B}}{R_2} + \frac{V_2}{R_3} = 0\\
V_1 = V_2 + V_\text{A}\\
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

By substituting V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to the first equation and solving in respect to V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, we get:

&lt;math&gt;
V_2 = \frac{(R_1 + R_2) R_3 V_\text{B} - R_2 R_3 V_\text{A}}{(R_1 + R_2) R_3 + R_1 R_2}
&lt;/math&gt;


== Matrix form for the node-voltage equation ==

In general, for a circuit with &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; nodes, the node-voltage equations obtained by nodal analysis can be written in a matrix form as derived in the following.
For any node &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, KCL states &lt;math&gt;\sum_{j\ne k}G_{jk}(v_k-v_j)=0&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;G_{kj}=G_{jk}&lt;/math&gt; is the negative of the sum of the conductances between nodes &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;v_k&lt;/math&gt; is the voltage of node &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.
This implies &lt;math&gt;0=\sum_{j\ne k}G_{jk}(v_k-v_j)=\sum_{j\ne k}G_{jk}v_k-\sum_{j\ne k}G_{jk}v_j=G_{kk}v_k-\sum_{j\ne k}G_{jk}v_j&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;G_{kk}&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of conductances connected to node &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. 
We note that the first term contributes linearly to the node &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; via &lt;math&gt;G_{kk}&lt;/math&gt;, while the second term contributes linearly to each node &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; connected to the node &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; via &lt;math&gt;G_{jk}&lt;/math&gt; with a minus sign.
If an independent current source/input &lt;math&gt;i_k&lt;/math&gt; is also attached to node &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, the above expression is generalized to &lt;math&gt;i_k=G_{kk}v_k-\sum_{j\ne k}G_{jk}v_j&lt;/math&gt;.
It is readily to show that one can combine the above node-voltage equations for all &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; nodes, and write them down in the following matrix form
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
G_{11} &amp;G_{12}  &amp;\cdots  &amp;G_{1N} \\ 
G_{21} &amp;G_{22}  &amp;\cdots  &amp;G_{2N} \\ 
\vdots &amp;\vdots  &amp;\ddots  &amp; \vdots\\ 
G_{N1} &amp;G_{N2}  &amp;\cdots  &amp;G_{NN} 
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
v_1\\ 
v_2\\ 
\vdots\\ 
v_N
\end{pmatrix}=
\begin{pmatrix}
i_1\\ 
i_2\\ 
\vdots\\ 
i_N
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
or simply
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf {Gv} = \mathbf i&lt;/math&gt;
The matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf G&lt;/math&gt; on the left hand side of the equation is singular since it satisfies &lt;math&gt;\mathbf {G 1}=0&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf 1&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;1\times N&lt;/math&gt; column matrix. This corresponds to the fact of current conservation, namely, &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k}i_k=0&lt;/math&gt;, and the freedom to choose a reference node (ground). In practice, the voltage is the reference node is taken to be 0. Consider it is the last node, &lt;math&gt;v_N=0&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, it is straightforward to verify that the resulting equations for the other &lt;math&gt;N-1&lt;/math&gt; nodes remain the same, and therefore one can simply discard the last column as well as the last line of the matrix equation. This procedure results in a &lt;math&gt;(N-1)\times(N-1)&lt;/math&gt; dimensional non-singular matrix equation with the definitions of all the elements stay unchanged.

'''Observational cosmology''' is the study of the structure, the evolution and the origin of the [[universe]] through [[observation]], using instruments such as [[telescope]]s and [[cosmic ray]] detectors.

==Early observations==
The science of [[physical cosmology]] as it is practiced today had its subject material defined in the years following the [[Shapley-Curtis debate]] when it was determined that the [[universe]] had a larger scale than the [[Milky Way galaxy]]. This was precipitated by observations that established the [[size of the universe|size]] and the dynamics of the cosmos that could be explained by [[Einstein]]'s [[General Theory of Relativity]]. In its infancy, cosmology was a speculative science based on a very limited number of observations and characterized by a dispute between [[steady state]] theorists and promoters of [[Big Bang]] cosmology. It was not until the 1990s and beyond that the astronomical observations would be able to eliminate competing theories and drive the science to the "Golden Age of Cosmology" which was heralded by [[David Schramm (astrophysicist)|David Schramm]] at a [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] colloquium in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur M. Sackler Colloquia of the National Academy of Sciences: Physical Cosmology; Irvine, California: March 27–28, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hubble's law and the cosmic distance ladder===
{{main|Hubble's law|cosmic distance ladder}}
[[File:Edwin-hubble.jpg|thumb|Astronomer Edwin Hubble]]
Distance measurements in astronomy have historically been and continue to be confounded by considerable measurement uncertainty. In particular, while [[stellar parallax]] can be used to measure the distance to nearby stars, the observational limits imposed by the difficulty in measuring the minuscule parallaxes associated with objects beyond our galaxy meant that astronomers had to look for alternative ways to measure cosmic distances. To this end, a [[standard candle]] measurement for [[Cepheid variable]]s was discovered by [[Henrietta Swan Leavitt]] in 1908 which would provide [[Edwin Hubble]] with the rung on the [[cosmic distance ladder]] he would need to determine the distance to [[spiral nebula]]. Hubble used the 100-inch [[Hooker Telescope]] at [[Mount Wilson Observatory]] to identify individual [[star]]s in those [[galaxy|galaxies]], and determine the distance to the galaxies by isolating individual Cepheids. This firmly established the spiral nebula as being objects well outside the Milky Way galaxy. Determining the distance to "island universes", as they were dubbed in the popular media, established the scale of the universe and settled the Shapley-Curtis debate once and for all.&lt;ref&gt;"Island universe" is a reference to speculative ideas promoted by a variety of scholastic thinkers in the 18th and 19th centuries. The most famous early proponent of such ideas was philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] who published a number of treatises on astronomy in addition to his more famous philosophical works. See Kant, I., 1755. ''Allgemeine Naturgeschichte und Theorie des Himmels'', Part I, J.F. Peterson, Königsberg and Leipzig.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, by combining various measurements, including Hubble's distance measurements and [[Vesto Slipher]]'s determinations of [[redshift]]s for these objects, [[Georges Lemaître]] was the first to estimate a constant of proportionality between galaxies' distances and what was termed their "recessional velocities", finding a value of about 600&amp;nbsp;km/s/Mpc.&lt;ref name="Lem27" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LemvsHubble_vdBergh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LemvsHubble_Block" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LemvsHubbleReich" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LemvsHubbleLivio11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LemvsHubbleLivioRiess2013" /&gt; He showed that this was theoretically expected in a universe model based on [[general relativity]].&lt;ref name="Lem27" /&gt; Two years later, Hubble showed that the relation between the distances and velocities was a positive correlation and had a slope of about 500&amp;nbsp;km/s/Mpc.&lt;ref name="Hubble1929" /&gt; This correlation would come to be known as ''[[Hubble's law]]'' and would serve as the observational foundation for the [[metric expansion of space|expanding universe theories]] on which cosmology is still based. The publication of the observations by Slipher, Wirtz, Hubble and their colleagues and the acceptance by the theorists of their theoretical implications in light of Einstein's [[General theory of relativity]] is considered the beginning of the modern science of cosmology.&lt;ref&gt;This popular consideration is echoed in ''[[Time Magazine]]'s'' listing for Edwin Hubble in their [[Time 100]] list of most influential people of the 20th Century. [[Michael Lemonick]] recounts, "He discovered the cosmos, and in doing so founded the science of cosmology." [http://www.time.com/time/time100/scientist/profile/hubble.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclide abundances===
{{main|cosmochemistry|astrochemistry}}
Determination of the [[Abundance of the chemical elements#Abundance of elements in the Universe|cosmic abundance of elements]] has a history dating back to early [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] measurements of light from astronomical objects and the identification of [[emission line|emission]] and [[absorption line]]s which corresponded to particular electronic transitions in [[chemical element]]s identified on Earth. For example, the element [[Helium]] was first identified through its spectroscopic signature in the [[Sun]] before it was isolated as a gas on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of the Chemical Elements'', page 256&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'' (1989), s.v. "helium". Retrieved December 16, 2006, from Oxford English Dictionary Online. Also, from quotation there: Thomson, W. (1872). ''Rep. Brit. Assoc.'' xcix: "Frankland and Lockyer find the yellow prominences to give a very decided bright line not far from D, but hitherto not identified with any terrestrial flame. It seems to indicate a new substance, which they propose to call Helium."&lt;/ref&gt;

Computing relative abundances was achieved through corresponding spectroscopic observations to measurements of the elemental composition of [[meteorite]]s.

===Detection of the cosmic microwave background===
{{main|Discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation}}
[[File:Ilc 9yr moll4096.png|thumb|the CMB seen by WMAP]]
A [[cosmic microwave background]] was predicted in 1948 by [[George Gamow]] and [[Ralph Alpher]], and by Alpher and [[Robert Herman]] as due to the hot [[big bang]] model. Moreover, Alpher and Herman were able to estimate the temperature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gamow | first1 = G. | year = 1948 | title = The Origin of Elements and the Separation of Galaxies| url = | journal = Physical Review | volume = 74| page=505 | doi=10.1103/physrev.74.505.2|bibcode = 1948PhRv...74..505G }}{{cite journal | last1 = Gamow | first1 = G. | title = The evolution of the universe | journal = Nature|volume= 162 |year=1948|page= 680 | doi=10.1038/162680a0|bibcode = 1948Natur.162..680G }} {{cite journal | first1= R.

Their prediction was rediscovered by [[Robert Dicke]] and [[Yakov Zel'dovich]] in the early 1960s with the first published recognition of the CMB radiation as a detectable phenomenon appeared in a brief paper by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] astrophysicists [[A. G. Doroshkevich]] and [[Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov|Igor Novikov]], in the spring of 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=A. A. Penzias|title=The origin of elements.|work=[[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel lecture]]|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1978/penzias-lecture.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=October 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, [[David Todd Wilkinson]] and Peter Roll, Dicke's colleagues at [[Princeton University]], began constructing a Dicke radiometer to measure the cosmic microwave background.&lt;ref&gt;R. H. Dicke, "The measurement of thermal radiation at microwave frequencies", ''Rev. Sci. Instrum.'' '''17''', 268 (1946). This basic design for a radiometer has been used in most subsequent cosmic microwave background experiments.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson]] at the [[Crawford Hill]] location of [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] in nearby [[Holmdel Township, New Jersey]] had built a Dicke radiometer that they intended to use for radio astronomy and satellite communication experiments. Their instrument had an excess 3.5&amp;nbsp;K [[noise temperature|antenna temperature]] which they could not account for. After receiving a telephone call from Crawford Hill, Dicke famously quipped: "Boys, we've been scooped."&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Penzias and R. W. Wilson, "A Measurement of Excess Antenna Temperature at 4080 Mc/s," ''Astrophysical Journal'' '''142''' (1965), 419. R. H. Dicke, P. J. E. Peebles, P. G. Roll and D. T. Wilkinson, "Cosmic Black-Body Radiation," ''Astrophysical Journal'' '''142''' (1965), 414. The history is given in P. J. E. Peebles, ''Principles of physical cosmology'' (Princeton Univ. Pr., Princeton 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; A meeting between the Princeton and Crawford Hill groups determined that the antenna temperature was indeed due to the microwave background. Penzias and Wilson received the 1978 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for their discovery.

==Modern observations==
Today, observational cosmology continues to test the predictions of theoretical cosmology and has led to the refinement of cosmological models. For example, the observational evidence for [[dark matter]] has heavily influenced theoretical modeling of [[structure formation|structure]] and [[galaxy formation]]. When trying to calibrate the Hubble diagram with accurate [[supernova]] [[standard candle]]s, observational evidence for [[dark energy]] was obtained in the late 1990s. These observations have been incorporated into a six-parameter framework known as the [[Lambda-CDM model]] which explains the evolution of the universe in terms of its constituent material. This model has subsequently been verified by detailed observations of the cosmic microwave background, especially through the [[WMAP]] experiment.

Included here are the modern observational efforts that have directly influenced cosmology.

===Redshift surveys===
{{main|Redshift survey}}
With the advent of automated [[telescope]]s and improvements in [[astronomical spectroscopy|spectroscopes]], a number of collaborations have been made to map the universe in [[redshift]] space. By combining redshift with angular position data, a redshift survey maps the 3D distribution of matter within a field of the sky. These observations are used to measure properties of the [[large-scale structure of the cosmos|large-scale structure]] of the universe. The [[Great Wall (astronomy)|Great Wall]], a vast [[supercluster]] of galaxies over 500 million [[light-year]]s wide, provides a dramatic example of a large-scale structure that redshift surveys can detect.&lt;ref&gt;M. J. Geller &amp; J. P. Huchra, ''Science'' '''246''', 897 (1989). [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/246/4932/897 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first redshift survey was the [[CfA Redshift Survey]], started in 1977 with the initial data collection completed in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;See the official CfA [http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/~huchra/zcat/ website] for more details.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey]] determined the large-scale structure of one section of the Universe, measuring ''z''-values for over 220,000 galaxies; data collection was completed in 2002, and the final [[data set]] was released 30 June 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2005.09318.x|title=The 2dF galaxy redshift survey: Power-spectrum analysis of the final dataset and cosmological implications|author=Shaun Cole|author2=et al.

The [[DEEP2 Redshift Survey]] uses the [[Keck telescopes]] with the new "DEIMOS" [[spectrograph]]; a follow-up to the pilot program DEEP1, DEEP2 is designed to measure faint galaxies with redshifts 0.7 and above, and it is therefore planned to provide a complement to SDSS and 2dF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title=Science objectives and early results of the DEEP2 redshift survey|author=Marc Davis|author2=et al.

===Cosmic microwave background experiments===
{{main|Cosmic microwave background experiments}}
Subsequent to the discovery of the CMB, hundreds of cosmic microwave background experiments had been conducted to measure and characterize the signatures of the radiation. The most famous experiment is probably the [[NASA]] [[Cosmic Background Explorer]] (COBE) satellite that orbited in 1989&amp;ndash;1996 and which detected and quantified the large-scale anisotropies at the limit of its detection capabilities. Inspired by the initial COBE results of an extremely isotropic and homogeneous background, a series of ground-based and balloon-based experiments quantified CMB anisotropies on smaller angular scales over the next decade. The primary goal of those experiments was to measure the angular scale of the first acoustic peak, for which COBE did not have sufficient resolution.  The measurements were able to rule out [[cosmic strings]] as the leading theory of cosmic structure formation, and suggested [[cosmic inflation]] was the right theory. During the 1990s, the first peak was measured with increasing sensitivity and by 2000 the [[BOOMERanG experiment]] reported that the highest power fluctuations occur at scales of approximately one degree.  Together with other cosmological data, these results implied that the geometry of the Universe is [[flat space|flat]].  A number of ground-based [[interferometer]]s provided measurements of the fluctuations with higher accuracy over the next three years, including the [[Very Small Array]], [[Degree Angular Scale Interferometer]] (DASI) and the [[Cosmic Background Imager]] (CBI). DASI made the first detection of the polarization of the CMB and the CBI provided the first E-mode spectrum with compelling evidence that it is out of phase with the T-mode spectrum.

In June 2001, NASA launched a second CMB space mission, [[WMAP]], to make much more precise measurements of the large-scale anisotropies over the full sky. The first results from this mission, disclosed in 2003, were detailed measurements of the angular power spectrum to below degree scales, tightly constraining various cosmological parameters. The results are broadly consistent with those expected from [[cosmic inflation]] as well as various other competing theories, and are available in detail at NASA's data center for Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) (see links below). Although WMAP provided very accurate measurements of the large angular-scale fluctuations in the CMB (structures about as large in the sky as the Moon), it did not have the angular resolution to measure the smaller scale fluctuations which had been observed using previous ground-based interferometers.

A third space mission, [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]], was launched in May 2009.  Planck employs both [[HEMT]] radiometers and [[bolometer]] technology and measures the CMB anisotropies at a higher resolution than WMAP.  Unlike the previous two space missions, Planck is a collaboration between NASA and the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA). Its detectors got a trial run at the Antarctic [[Viper telescope]] as ACBAR ([[Arcminute Cosmology Bolometer Array Receiver]]) experiment &amp;ndash; which has produced the most precise measurements at small angular scales to date &amp;ndash; and at the [[Archeops]] balloon telescope.

Additional ground-based instruments such as the [[South Pole Telescope]] in Antarctica and the proposed [[Clover (telescope)|Clover]] Project, [[Atacama Cosmology Telescope]] and the [[QUIET telescope]] in [[Chile]] will provide additional data not available from satellite observations, possibly including the B-mode polarization.

===Telescope observations===

====Radio====
The brightest sources of low-frequency radio emission (10&amp;nbsp;MHz and 100&amp;nbsp;GHz) are [[radio galaxy|radio galaxies]] which can be observed out to extremely high redshifts. These are subsets of the [[active galaxy|active galaxies]] that have extended features known as lobes and jets which extend away from the [[galactic nucleus]] distances on the order of [[megaparsec]]s. Because radio galaxies are so bright, astronomers have used them to probe extreme distances and early times in the evolution of the universe.

====Infrared====
Far [[infrared]] observations including [[submillimeter astronomy]] have revealed a number of sources at cosmological distances. With the exception of a few [[infrared window|atmospheric window]]s, most of infrared light is blocked by the atmosphere, the observations generally take place from balloon or space-based instruments. Current observational experiments in the infrared include [[NICMOS]], the [[Cosmic Origins Spectrograph]], the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]], the [[Keck Interferometer]], the [[Stratospheric Observatory For Infrared Astronomy]], and the [[Herschel Space Observatory]]. The next large space telescope planned by NASA, the [[James Webb Space Telescope]] will also explore in the infrared.

An additional infrared survey, the [[Two-Micron All Sky Survey]], has also been very useful in revealing the distribution of galaxies, similar to other optical surveys described below.

====Optical rays (visible to human eyes)====
Optical light is still the primary means by which astronomy occurs, and in the context of cosmology, this means observing distant galaxies and galaxy clusters in order to learn about the [[Large-scale structure of the universe|large scale structure]] of the Universe as well as [[galaxy evolution]]. [[Redshift survey]]s have been a common means by which this has been accomplished with some of the most famous including the [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey]], the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]], and the upcoming [[Large Synoptic Survey Telescope]]. These optical observations generally use either [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]] or [[spectroscopy]] to measure the [[redshift]] of a galaxy and then, via [[Hubble's Law]], determine its distance modulo redshift distortions due to [[peculiar velocities]]. Additionally, the position of the galaxies as seen on the sky in [[celestial coordinates]] can be used to gain information about the other two spatial dimensions.

Very deep observations (which is to say sensitive to dim sources) are also useful tools in cosmology. The [[Hubble Deep Field]], [[Hubble Ultra Deep Field]], [[Hubble Extreme Deep Field]], and [[Hubble Deep Field South]] are all examples of this.

===Cosmic ray observations===

==Future observations==

===Cosmic neutrinos===
{{main|Cosmic neutrino background}}
It is a prediction of the [[Big Bang]] model that the universe is filled with a [[Cosmic neutrino background|neutrino background radiation]], analogous to the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]. The microwave background is a relic from when the universe was about 380,000 years old, but the neutrino background is a relic from when the universe was about two seconds old.

If this neutrino radiation could be observed, it would be a window into very early stages of the universe. Unfortunately, these neutrinos would now be very cold, and so they are effectively impossible to observe directly.

In [[social anthropology]], '''patrilocal residence''' or '''patrilocality''', also known as '''virilocal residence''' or '''virilocality''', are terms referring to the [[Society|social]] [[Social system|system]] in which a married couple resides with or near the husband's parents.  The concept of location may extend to a larger area such as a [[village]], [[town]] or [[clan]] territory. The practice has been found in around 70 percent of the world's cultures that have been described [[Ethnography|ethnographically]].{{citation needed|date=October 2009}} Evidence has also been found among [[Neanderthal]] remains in [[Spain]] and ancient [[hominid]] archaeology in [[Africa]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Description==
In a patrilocal society, when a man marries, his wife joins him in his father's home or compound, where they raise their children.  These children will follow the same pattern. Sons will stay and daughters will move in with their husbands' families. Families living in a patrilocal residence generally assume joint ownership of domestic sources. The household is led by a senior member, who also directs the labor of all other members.

[[Matrilocal residence]] may be regarded as the opposite of patrilocal residence.  However, since the majority of societies exhibit at least some degree of [[patriarchy]], in most matrilocal groups the brothers (or mothers' brothers) are the authority figures, not the wives or mothers themselves.

Early theories explaining the determinants of postmarital residence (e.g., [[Lewis Henry Morgan]], [[Edward Tylor]], or [[George Peter Murdock]]) connected it with the sexual division of labor. However, to date, [[cross-cultural]] tests of this [[hypothesis]] using worldwide samples have failed to find any significant relationship between these two variables. However, [[Andrey Korotayev|Korotayev]]'s tests show that the female contribution to subsistence does correlate significantly with matrilocal (as opposed to patrilocal) residence in general; however, this correlation is masked by a general polygyny factor. Although an increase in the female contribution to subsistence tends to lead to matrilocal residence, it also tends simultaneously to lead to general non-sororal [[polygyny]] which effectively destroys [[matrilocality]], and pushes a social system toward patrilocality. If this polygyny factor is controlled (e.g., through a multiple [[Regression analysis|regression]] model), division of labor turns out to be a significant predictor of postmarital residence. Thus, Murdock's hypotheses regarding the relationships between the sexual division of labor and postmarital residence were basically correct, though, as has been shown by Korotayev, the actual relationships between those two groups of variables are more complicated than he expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Korotayev | first = Andrey | author-link = Andrey Korotayev | title = Form of marriage, sexual division of labor, and postmarital residence in cross-cultural perspective: a reconsideration | journal = [[Journal of Anthropological Research]] | volume = 59 | issue = 1 | pages = 69&amp;ndash;89 | publisher = [[University of Chicago Press]] | doi = 10.1086/jar.59.1.3631445 | date = Spring 2003 | url = https://doi.org/10.1086/jar.59.1.3631445 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Korotayev | first = Andrey | author-link = Andrey Korotayev | title = Division of labor by gender and postmarital residence in cross-cultural perspective: a reconsideration | journal = [[Cross-Cultural Research]] | volume = 37 | issue = 4 | pages = 335&amp;ndash;372 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/1069397103253685 | date = November 2003 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/1069397103253685 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linguistic traces==
In some [[Slavic languages|Slavonic]] languages, verbs for [[marriage|marrying]] show evidence of patrilocality. In [[Polish language|Polish]] the verb for "to marry", when done by a woman, is ''wyjść za mąż'' while in [[Russian language|Russian]] it is ''выйти замуж'' (''vyjti zamuzh''). Both mean literally "to go out and behind the husband". In comparison, a man in Polish can simply ''żenić się'' and in Russian he is able to ''жениться'', both meaning "to wife oneself". (In Polish, ''wziąć kobietę za żonę'', "to take a woman for a wife", is another possibility).

The verbs for marriage in the [[Hungarian language]] show evidence of patrilocality. The verb for "to marry", when done by a woman, is ''férjhez menni'', literally meaning "to leave [the family home] for the husband". However, the verbs ''házasodni'' and ''megházasodni'', meaning "to house oneself", and ''összeházasodni'' "to house together", can be used by both males and females.

Indeed, in many European languages including English, the verb "to marry" may ultimately come from a past participle of [[Proto-Indo European]] *mari, for young woman - as in, provided with a *mari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = marry (definition) | url = https://www.etymonline.com/word/marry | website = etymonline.com | publisher = [[Online Etymology Dictionary]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neanderthals and early hominins==
It is claimed that the practice was also prevalent in some [[Neanderthal]] populations. A 49,000-year-old grave was found in Spain in 2010 which contained three related-to-each-other males, with three unrelated-to-each-other females, suggesting they were the partners of the males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Bowdler | first = Neil | title = Neanderthal family found cannibalised in cave in Spain | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12049854 | work = [[BBC News]] | date = 21 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 study using ratios of [[strontium]] isotopes in teeth also suggested that roughly 2 million years ago, among ''[[Australopithecus]]'' and ''[[Paranthropus robustus]]'' groups in southern Africa, women tended to settle farther from their region of birth than men did.&lt;ref name="CavewomenBBC2011"&gt;{{cite news | first=Neil | last=Bowdler | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-13609260 | title=Ancient cave women 'left childhood homes' | date=2 June 2011 | work=[[BBC News]] | accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Copeland2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Copeland | first1 = Sandi R. | last2 = et al |title=Strontium isotope evidence for landscape use by early hominins  |volume=474 | date=1 June 2011 |pages=76–78 |journal=Nature |doi=10.1038/nature10149 |url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nature10149 |pmid=21637256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phosphatidylserine''' (abbreviated '''Ptd-L-Ser''' or '''PS''') is a [[phospholipid]] and is a [[Membrane lipids|component of the cell membrane]]. It plays a key role in cell cycle signaling, specifically in relation to [[apoptosis]]. It is a key pathway for viruses to enter cells via '''[[Molecular mimicry|viral apoptotic mimicry]]'''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

== Structure ==
Phosphatidylserine is a [[phospholipid]] (more specifically a [[glycerophospholipid]]). It consists of two fatty acids attached in ester linkage to the first and second carbon of glycerol and [[serine]] attached through a phosphodiester linkage to the third carbon of the glycerol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lehninger Principles of biochemistry|last=Nelson|first=David|last2=Cox|first2=Michael|publisher=W.H Freeman and company|year=|isbn=9781429208925|edition=5|location=|pages=350|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phosphatidylserine coming from plants and phosphatidylserine coming from animals differ in fatty acid composition.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products|first=Nutrition and Allergies|date=2010-10-01|title=Scientific Opinion on the substantiation of health claims related to phosphatidyl serine (ID 552, 711, 734, 1632, 1927) pursuant to Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1749/abstract|journal=EFSA Journal|volume=8|issue=10|pages=1749|doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1749|issn=1831-4732}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biological function ==

===Cell signaling===
Phosphatidylserine(s) are actively held facing the [[cytosolic]] (inner) side of the cell membrane by the enzyme [[flippase]]. However, when a cell undergoes [[apoptosis]], phosphatidylserine is no longer restricted to the cytosolic side by [[flippase]]. Instead [[scramblase]] catalyzes the rapid exchange of phosphatidylserine between the two sides. When the phosphatidylserines flip to the extracellular (outer) surface of the cell, they act as a signal for macrophages to engulf the cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Verhoven|first1=B.|last2=Schlegel|first2=R. A.|last3=Williamson|first3=P|title=Mechanisms of phosphatidylserine exposure, a phagocyte recognition signal, on apoptotic T lymphocytes|journal=Journal of Experimental Medicine|date=1 November 1995|volume=182|issue=5|pages=1597–601|pmid=7595231|doi=10.1084/jem.182.5.1597|pmc=2192221|url=http://jem.rupress.org/content/182/5/1597.full.pdf|accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coagulation===
Phosphatidylserine plays a role in blood [[coagulation]] (also known as clotting). When circulating [[platelet]]s encounter the site of an injury, [[collagen]] and [[thrombin]] -mediated activation causes externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS) from the inner membrane layer, where it serves as a pro-coagulant surface.&lt;ref name="coag"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Exposure of platelet membrane phosphatidylserine regulates blood coagulation |journal=Prog Lipid Res. |date=September 2003 |last=Lentz |first=B. R. |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=423–438 |pmid=12814644 |doi=10.1016/s0163-7827(03)00025-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This surface acts to orient coagulation proteases, specifically [[tissue factor]] (TF) and [[factor VII]], facilitating further [[proteolysis]], activation of [[factor X]], and ultimately generating thrombin.&lt;ref name="coag"/&gt;

In the coagulation disorder [[Scott syndrome]], the mechanism in platelets for transportation of PS from the inner platelet membrane surface to the outer membrane surface is defective.&lt;ref&gt;Zwaal FA, Comfurius P, Bevers EM. ''Scott syndrome, a bleeding disorder caused by defective scrambling of membrane phospholipids''. Biochem Bioph Acta 2004; 1636:119-128&lt;/ref&gt; It is characterized as a mild bleeding disorder stemming from the patient's deficiency in thrombin synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss HJ. ''Scott syndrome: a disorder of platelet coagulant activity (PCA).'' Sem Hemat 1994; 31:312-319&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biosynthesis==
[[Image:Biosynthesis of phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylethanolamine.svg|thumb|Biosynthesis of phosphatidylserine]]
Phosphatidylserine is biosynthesized in bacteria by condensing the amino acid [[serine]] with CDP ([[cytidine diphosphate]])-activated [[phosphatidic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Christie|first1=William W.|title=Phosphatidylserine and Related Lipids: Structure, Occurrence, Biochemistry and Analysis|url=http://aocs.files.cms-plus.com/LipidsLibrary/images/Importedfiles/lipidlibrary/Lipids/ps/file.pdf|website=The American Oil Chemists’ Society Lipid Library|accessdate=20 April 2017|date=4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mammals, phosphatidylserine is produced by base-exchange reactions with [[phosphatidylcholine]] and [[phosphatidylethanolamine]]. Conversely, phosphatidylserine can also give rise to [[phosphatidylethanolamine]] and [[phosphatidylcholine]], although in animals the pathway to generate phosphatidylcholine from phosphatidylserine only operates in the liver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Christie|first1=William W.|title=Phosphatidylcholine and Related Lipids: Structure, Occurrence, Biochemistry and Analysis|url=http://aocs.files.cms-plus.com/LipidsLibrary/images/Importedfiles/lipidlibrary/Lipids/pc/file.pdf|website=The American Oil Chemists’ Society Lipid Library|accessdate=20 April 2017|date=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dietary sources==
The average daily phosphatidylserine (PS) intake from diet in [[Western countries]] is estimated to be 130&amp;nbsp;mg.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} PS may be found in meat and fish. Only small amounts of PS can be found in dairy products or in vegetables, with the exception of white beans and soy lecithin.

'''Table 1.''' PS content in different foods.&lt;ref name="Souci_2008"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Souci SW, Fachmann E, Kraut H | year=2008 | title=Food Composition and Nutrition Tables. Medpharm Scientific Publishers Stuttgart}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soy products are not in this table, because commercial PS is made by enzymatically converting soy phosphatidylcholine (lecithin) to phosphatidylserine, rather than purifying phosphatidylserine from soy.

==Supplementation==

=== Health claims ===
A panel of the [[European Food Safety Authority]] concluded that a cause and effect relationship cannot be established between the consumption of phosphatidylserine and "memory and cognitive functioning in the elderly”, “mental health/cognitive function” and “stress reduction and enhanced memory function”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The reason is that bovine brain cortex- and soy-based phosphatidylserine are different substances and might, therefore, have different biological activities. Therefore, the results of studies using PS coming from different sources cannot be generalized.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Cognition ====
In May, 2003 the [[Food and Drug Administration]] gave "qualified health claim" status to phosphatidylserine thus allowing labels to state "consumption of phosphatidylserine may reduce the risk of dementia and cognitive dysfunction in the elderly" along with the disclaimer "very limited and preliminary scientific research suggests that phosphatidylserine may reduce the risk of cognitive dysfunction in the elderly. FDA concludes that there is little scientific evidence supporting this claim."&lt;ref name="FDAFinalDecisionLetter20030513"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/food/ingredientspackaginglabeling/labelingnutrition/ucm072999.htm |title=Phosphatidylserine and Cognitive Dysfunction and Dementia (Qualified Health Claim: Final Decision Letter) |last=Taylor |first=Christine L.|publisher=Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, U.S. Food and Drug Administration |date=May 13, 2003 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/LabelingNutrition/ucm073992.htm#cognitive|title=Summary of Qualified Health Claims Subject to Enforcement Discretion - Qualified Claims About Cognitive Function|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FDA declared that "based on its evaluation of the totality of the publicly available scientific evidence, the agency concludes that there is not significant scientific agreement among qualified experts that a relationship exists between phosphatidylserine and reduced risk of dementia or cognitive dysfunction".&lt;ref name="FDAFinalDecisionLetter20030513"/&gt; The FDA also noted "Of the 10 intervention studies that formed the basis of FDA's evaluation, all were seriously flawed or limited in their reliability in one or more ways", concluding that "most of the evidence does not support a relationship between phosphatidylserine and reduced risk of dementia or cognitive dysfunction, and that the evidence that does support such a relationship is very limited and preliminary".&lt;ref name="FDAFinalDecisionLetter20030513"/&gt;

Early studies of phosphatidylserine on memory and cognition used a supplement which isolated the molecule from the bovine brain. Currently, most commercially available products are made from cabbage or [[soybean]]s because of concerns about [[mad cow disease]] in bovine brain tissue.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Glenn|title=Can phosphatidylserine improve memory and cognitive function in people with Alzheimer's disease?|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/expert-answers/phosphatidylserine/faq-20057764|website=Mayo Clinic|accessdate=23 August 2014|date=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These plant-based products have a similar, but not identical chemical structure to the bovine derived supplements; for example, the FDA notes "the phosphatidylserine molecule from soy lecithin contains mainly polyunsaturated acids, while the phosphatidylserine molecule from bovine brain cortex contains mainly saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids".&lt;ref name="FDAFinalDecisionLetter20030513"/&gt;

A preliminary study in rats in 1999 indicated that the soy derived phosphatidylserine supplement was as effective as the bovine derived supplement in one of three behavioral tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blokland |first=A |author2=Honig W |author3=Brouns F |author4=Jolles J  |title=Cognition-enhancing properties of subchronic phosphatidylserine (PS) treatment in middle-aged rats: comparison of bovine cortex PS with egg PS and soybean PS |journal=Nutrition |volume=15 |issue=10 |date=October 1999 |pmid=10501292 |doi= 10.1016/S0899-9007(99)00157-4|url=http://arno.unimaas.nl/show.cgi?fid=4948 |pages=778–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Treatment of Age-Related Cognitive Decline: Effects of Phosphatidylserine in Anti-Aging Medical Therapeutics | last=Crook | first= T.

===Safety===
Traditionally, PS supplements were derived from bovine cortex (BC-PS). However, due to the risk of potential transfer of infectious diseases, soy-derived PS (S-PS) supplements have been used as an alternative.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Soy-derived PS is designated [[Generally Recognized As Safe]] by the FDA.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} A 2002 safety report determined supplementation in elder people at a dosage of 200&amp;nbsp;mg three times daily to be safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jorissen BL, Brouns F, Van Boxtel MP, Riedel WJ |title=Safety of soy-derived phosphatidylserine in elderly people |journal=Nutritional Neuroscience |volume=5 |issue=5 |date=October 2002 |pmid=12385596 |doi= 10.1080/1028415021000033802|url= |pages=337–43|last2=Brouns |last3=Van Boxtel |last4=Riedel }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plasmolysis''' is the process in which cells lose water in a [[hypertonic]] solution. The reverse process, [[cytolysis]], can occur if the cell is in a [[Tonicity#Hypotonicity|hypotonic]] solution resulting in a lower external [[osmotic pressure]] and a net flow of water into the cell. Through observation of plasmolysis and deplasmolysis, it is possible to determine the [[tonicity]] of the cell's environment as well as the rate solute molecules cross the [[Cell membrane|cellular membrane]].

== Turgidity ==
{{main|Turgor pressure}}
A plant cell in hypotonic solution will absorb water by [[endosmosis]], so that the increased volume of water in the cell will increase pressure, making the [[protoplasm]] push against the [[cell wall]], a condition known as [[turgor]]. Turgor makes plant cells push against each other in the same way and is the main line method of support in non-woody plant tissue. Plant cell walls resist further water entry after a certain point, known as full turgor, which stops plant cells from bursting as animal cells do in the same conditions. This is also the reason that plants stand upright. Without the stiffness of the plant cells the plant would fall under its own weight.  Turgor pressure allows plants to stay firm and erect, and plants without turgor pressure (known as flaccid) wilt. A cell will begin to decline in turgor pressure only when there is no air spaces surrounding it and eventually leads to a greater osmotic pressure than that of the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Plants in Action|last=Munns|first=Rana|publisher=Australian Society of Plant Scientists|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vacuoles play a role in turgor pressure when water leaves the cell due to [[hyperosmotic]] solutions containing solutes such as [[mannitol]], [[sorbitol]], and [[sucrose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lang|first=Ingeborg|date=10 September 2014|title=Plasmolysis: Loss of Turgor and Beyond|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/3/4/583/pdf|journal=Plants|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plasmolysis ==
[[Image:Turgor pressure on plant cells diagram.svg|thumb|300px|right|Plant cell under different environments]] If a plant cell is placed in a [[Tonicity#Hypertonicity|hypertonic]] solution, the plant cell loses water and hence [[turgor]] pressure by plasmolysis: pressure decreases to the point where the protoplasm of the cell peels away from the cell wall, leaving gaps between the cell wall and the membrane and making the plant cell shrink and crumple.  A continued decrease in pressure eventually leads to [[cytorrhysis]] – the complete collapse of the cell wall. Plants with cells in this condition wilt. After plasmolysis the gap between the cell wall and the cell membrane in a plant cell is filled with [[hypertonic]] solution. This is because as the solution surrounding the cell is hypertonic, [[exosmosis]] takes place and the space between the cell wall and cytoplasm is filled with solutes, as most of the water drains away and hence the concentration inside the cell becomes more hypertonic. There are some mechanisms in plants to prevent excess water loss in the same way as excess water gain. Plasmolysis can be reversed if the cell is placed in a [[hypotonic]] solution. [[Stoma|Stomata]] help keep water in the plant so it does not dry out. [[Wax]] also keeps water in the plant. The equivalent process in animal cells is called [[crenation]]. 
The liquid content of the cell leaks out due to exosmosis. The cell collapses, and the cell membrane pulls away from the cell wall (in plants). Most animal cells consist of only a [[Lipid bilayer|phospholipid bilayer]] ([[plasma membrane]]) and not a cell wall, therefore shrinking up under such conditions.

Plasmolysis only occurs in extreme conditions and rarely happens in nature. It is induced in the laboratory by immersing cells in strong [[Saline (medicine)|saline]] or sugar (sucrose) solutions to cause [[exosmosis]], often using ''[[Elodea]]'' plants or [[onion epidermal cell]]s, which have colored cell sap so that the process is clearly visible.  [[Methylene blue]] can be used to stain plant cells.

Plasmolysis is mainly known as shrinking of cell membrane in hypertonic solution and great pressure.

Plasmolysis can be of two types, either concave plasmolysis or convex plasmolysis. Convex plasmolysis is always irreversible while concave plasmolysis is usually reversible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lang|first=Ingeborg|last2=Sassmann|first2=Stefan|last3=Schmidt|first3=Brigitte|last4=Komis|first4=George|date=2014-11-26|title=Plasmolysis: Loss of Turgor and Beyond|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/3/4/583|journal=Plants|language=en|volume=3|issue=4|pages=583–593|doi=10.3390/plants3040583|pmc=4844282|pmid=27135521}}&lt;/ref&gt; During concave plasmolysis, the plasma membrane and the enclosed protoplast partially shrinks from the cell wall due to half-spherical, inwarding curving pockets forming between the plasma membrane and the cell wall. During convex plasmolysis, the plasma membrane and the enclosed protoplast shrinks completely from the cell wall, with the plasma membrane's ends in a symmetrically, spherically curved pattern.&lt;ref name="[1]"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lang|first1=Ingeborg|last2=Sassmann|first2=Stefan|last3=Schmidt|first3=Brigitte|last4=Komis|first4=George|title=Plasmolysis: Loss of Turgor and Beyond|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/3/4/583/htm|website=Plants|accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prehistoric religions''' are the [[religion|religious beliefs and practices]] of [[prehistory|prehistoric]] peoples. The term may cover [[Paleolithic religion]], [[Mesolithic]] religion, [[#Neolithic|Neolithic religion]] and [[Bronze Age religion (disambiguation) | Bronze Age religions]].

==Paleolithic==
{{Main|Paleolithic religion}}
 
Intentional [[burial]], particularly with [[grave goods]], may be one of the earliest detectable forms of religious practice (the onset of burial itself being a canonical indicator of [[behavioral modernity]]) since, as [[Philip Lieberman]] suggests, it may signify a "concern for the dead that transcends daily life".&lt;ref name="lieberman"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3tS2MULo5rYC&amp;pg=PA162 | title= Uniquely Human|isbn=0-674-92183-6| year= 1991| authorlink= Philip Lieberman}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[File:Gabillou Sorcier.png|thumb|left|150px|Picture of a half-animal half-human being in a Paleolithic [[cave painting]] in [[Dordogne]], [[France]] which archeologists believe may provide evidence for early shamanic practices]]
A number of archeologists propose that Middle Paleolithic societies such as [[Neanderthal]] societies may also have practiced early forms of [[totemism]] or of [[animal worship]]. Emil Bächler in particular suggests (based on archeological evidence from Middle Paleolithic caves) that a widespread [[Middle Paleolithic]] [[Neanderthal]] [[bear cult|bear-cult]] existed ([[#Reference-idWunn2000|Wunn, 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;434-435).  A claim that evidence was found for [[Middle Paleolithic]] animal worship [[circa|c]] 70,000 BCE (originating from the [[Tsodilo Hills]] in the African Kalahari desert) has been denied by the original investigators of the site.&lt;ref&gt;World's Oldest Ritual Discovered -- Worshipped The Python 70,000 Years Ago The Research Council of Norway (2006, November 30). World's Oldest Ritual Discovered -- Worshipped The Python 70,000 Years Ago. ScienceDaily. Retrieved March 2, 2008, from https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/11/061130081347.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robbins et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Robbins|first= Lawrence H.|author2= Alec C.

Narr |title= Prehistoric religion |accessdate= 2008-03-28 |work= Britannica online encyclopedia 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animal worship during the Upper Paleolithic intertwined with hunting rites.&lt;ref name="Narr"/&gt; For instance, archeological evidence from [[Paleolithic art]]  and from bear remains reveals that the bear cult apparently had a type of sacrificial bear ceremonialism in which a bear was shot with [[arrow]]s, then finished off with a shot in the lungs and ritualistically buried near a clay bear-statue covered by a bear fur, with the skull and the body of the bear buried separately.&lt;ref name="Narr"/&gt;

==Neolithic==
There are no extant textual sources from the [[Neolithic]] era, the most recent available dating from the [[Bronze Age]], and therefore all statements about any [[belief system]]s Neolithic societies may have possessed are glimpsed from archaeology.

[[Jacques Cauvin]] suggested that the [[Neolithic Revolution]] was influenced by an important theme he termed the "[[Jacques Cauvin#The Revolution of the Symbols|Revolution of the Symbols]]", suggesting the birth of "religion" in the Neolithic. He argued that Neolithic humans were influenced by a change in thinking as much as changes in the environment and noted a series of stages in this process.&lt;ref name="Aurenche"&gt;Olivier Aurenche, [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/paleo_0153-9345_2001_num_27_2_4728 Jacques Cauvin et la préhistoire du Levant], Paléorient, Volume 27, Number 27-2, pp. 5-11, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; His work suggested important concepts in the evolution of human thinking, by examining figurines and early art depicting first women as goddesses and bulls as gods, he suggested several important ideas about the evolution of perception and duality.&lt;ref name="CauvinWatkins2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jacques Cauvin|author2=Trevor Watkins|title=The birth of the Gods and the origins of agriculture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z4epGQpNyucC|accessdate=1 April 2011|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-65135-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The structures known as [[circular enclosure (archaeology)|Circular Enclosures]] built in Central Europe during the 5th millennium BCE have been interpreted as serving a cultic function. In the case of the [[Goseck circle]], remains of [[human sacrifice]] were found. Many of these structures had openings aligned with sunset and/or sunrise at the [[solstice]]s, suggesting that they served as a means of maintaining a [[lunisolar calendar]]. The construction of [[Megalithic]] monuments in Europe also began in the 5th millennium, and continued throughout the Neolithic and in some areas well into the early Bronze Age.

[[Marija Gimbutas]], pioneer of [[feminist archaeology]], put forward a notion of a "woman-centered" society surrounding "goddess worship" in [[Neolithic Europe]]. The Neolithic "matristic" cultures would have been replaced by [[patriarchy]] only with the arrival of the [[Bronze Age]]. Gimbutas' views on this matter do not have widespread support today.&lt;ref&gt;Archaeologist Sarah M. Nelson criticizes Gimbutas suggesting that she used the same techniques used in the past to disparage women but in this case to glorify them, and quotes another archaeologist, Pamela Russell, as saying "The archaeological evidence is, in some cases, distorted enough to make a careful prehistorian shudder". See {{cite book|last=Nelson|first=Sarah M|title=Gender in archaeology: analyzing power and prestige|year=2004|publisher=AltaMira Press|isbn=978-0-7591-0496-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=46UlbBqCE9AC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=neolithic+religion&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=B-tJTMb6G4__Ocaw2ZgD&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=pamela%20russell&amp;f=false|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bronze Age==
{{Main|Religions of the ancient Near East|Minoan religion|Ancient Mesopotamian religion|Ancient Egyptian religion}}

===Reconstructions===
The early [[Bronze Age]] [[Proto-Indo-European religion]] (itself [[historical linguistics|reconstructed]]), and the attested early [[Semitic gods]], are presumed continuations of certain traditions of the late Neolithic.

====Bronze Age Europe====
Hints to the religion of [[Bronze Age Europe]] include images of [[solar barge]]s, frequent appearance of the [[Sun cross]], deposits of bronze [[axe]]s, and later [[sickle]]s, so-called [[moon idol]]s, the conical [[golden hat]]s, the [[Nebra skydisk]], and burial in [[tumulus|tumuli]], but also [[cremation]] as practised by the [[Urnfield culture]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Iron Age==
{{Further|Axial Age}}
While the [[Iron Age]] religions of the [[Mediterranean]], [[Near East]], [[Iron Age India|India]] and [[Iron Age China|China]] are well attested in written sources, much of [[Iron Age Europe]], from the period of about 700 BCE down to the [[Migration Period|Great Migrations]], falls within the prehistoric period. There are scarce accounts of non-Mediterranean religious customs in the records of Hellenistic and Roman era [[Greek ethnography|ethnography]].
*[[Scythian mythology]] ([[Herodotus]])
*[[Celtic polytheism]] ([[Posidonius]])
*[[Paleo-Balkan mythology]]
*[[Germanic polytheism]] ([[Tacitus]])
*[[Slavic polytheism]] ([[Procopius]])
*[[Mythology of the Turkic and Mongolian peoples]]

In the case of Circumpolar religion ([[Shamanism in Siberia]], [[Finnic mythology]]), [[traditional African religions]], [[native American religions]] and [[Pacific religions]], the prehistoric era mostly ends only with the [[Early Modern period]] and European [[colonialism]]. These traditions were often only first recorded in the context of [[Christianization]].

For these reasons, the interpretations and understanding of the Iron Age cult in Europe has to rely primarily on archaeological material.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24815">In [[computer science]] and [[mathematical logic]], the '''satisfiability modulo theories''' ('''SMT''') problem is a [[decision problem]] for logical formulas with respect to combinations of background [[Theory (mathematical logic)|theories]] expressed in classical [[first-order logic]] with equality. Examples of theories typically used in computer science are the theory of [[real numbers]], the theory of [[integers]], and the theories of various [[data structure]]s such as [[List (computing)|list]]s, [[Array data structure|arrays]], [[bit vector]]s and so on. SMT can be thought of as a form of the [[constraint satisfaction problem]] and thus a certain formalized approach to [[constraint programming]].

==Basic terminology==
Formally speaking, an SMT instance is a [[formula]] in [[first-order logic]], where some function and predicate symbols have additional interpretations, and SMT is the problem of determining whether such a formula is satisfiable. In other words, imagine an instance of the [[boolean satisfiability problem]] (SAT) in which some of the binary variables are replaced by [[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]]s over a suitable set of non-binary variables. A predicate is basically a binary-valued function of non-binary variables. Example predicates include linear [[inequality (mathematics)|inequalities]] (e.g., &lt;math&gt;3x + 2y - z \geq 4&lt;/math&gt;) or equalities involving [[uninterpreted term]]s and function symbols (e.g., &lt;math&gt;f(f(u, v), v) = f(u, v)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is some unspecified function of two arguments). These predicates are classified according to each respective theory assigned. For instance, linear inequalities over real variables are evaluated using the rules of the theory of linear real [[arithmetic]], whereas predicates involving uninterpreted terms and function symbols are evaluated using the rules of the theory of [[uninterpreted function]]s with equality (sometimes referred to as the [[empty theory]]). Other theories include the theories of [[array data structure|arrays]] and [[List (computing)|list]] structures (useful for modeling and verifying [[computer program]]s), and the theory of [[bit vectors]] (useful in modeling and verifying [[hardware design]]s). Subtheories are also possible: for example, difference logic is a sub-theory of linear arithmetic in which each inequality is restricted to have the form &lt;math&gt;x - y &gt; c&lt;/math&gt; for variables &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and constant &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;.

Most SMT solvers support only [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]]-free fragments of their logics.

==Expressive power==
An SMT instance is a generalization of a [[Boolean satisfiability problem|Boolean SAT]] instance in which various sets of variables are replaced by [[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]]s from a variety of underlying theories. SMT formulas provide a much richer [[modeling language]] than is possible with Boolean SAT formulas. For example, an SMT formula allows us to model the [[datapath]] operations of a [[microprocessor]] at the word rather than the bit level.

By comparison, [[answer set programming]] is also based on predicates (more precisely, on [[atomic sentence]]s created from [[atomic formula]]).  Unlike SMT, answer-set programs do not have quantifiers, and cannot easily express constraints such as [[linear arithmetic]] or [[difference logic]]—ASP is at best suitable for boolean problems that reduce to the [[free theory]] of uninterpreted functions.  Implementing 32-bit integers as bitvectors in ASP suffers from most of the same problems that early SMT solvers faced: "obvious" identities such as ''x''+''y''=''y''+''x'' are difficult to deduce.

[[Constraint logic programming]] does provide support for linear arithmetic constraints, but within a completely different theoretical framework.

==Solver approaches==
Early attempts for solving SMT instances involved translating them to Boolean SAT instances (e.g., a 32-bit integer variable would be encoded by 32 bit variables with appropriate weights and word-level operations such as 'plus' would be replaced by lower-level logic operations on the bits) and passing this formula to a Boolean SAT solver. This approach, which is referred to as ''the eager approach'', has its merits: by pre-processing the SMT formula into an equivalent Boolean SAT formula we can use existing Boolean SAT solvers "as-is" and leverage their performance and capacity improvements over time. On the other hand, the loss of the high-level semantics of the underlying theories means that the Boolean SAT solver has to work a lot harder than necessary to discover "obvious" facts (such as &lt;math&gt;x + y = y + x&lt;/math&gt; for integer addition.) This observation led to the development of a number of SMT solvers that tightly integrate the Boolean reasoning of a [[DPLL algorithm|DPLL]]-style search with theory-specific solvers (''T-solvers'') that handle [[Logical conjunction|conjunctions]] (ANDs) of predicates from a given theory. This approach is referred to as ''the lazy approach''.

| issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; this architecture gives the responsibility of Boolean reasoning to the DPLL-based SAT solver which, in turn, interacts with a solver for theory T through a well-defined interface. The theory solver only needs to worry about checking the feasibility of conjunctions of theory predicates passed on to it from the SAT solver as it explores the Boolean search space of the formula. For this integration to work well, however, the theory solver must be able to participate in propagation and conflict analysis, i.e., it must be able to infer new facts from already established facts, as well as to supply succinct explanations of infeasibility when theory conflicts arise. In other words, the theory solver must be incremental and [[Backtracking|backtrackable]].

==SMT for undecidable theories==
Most of the common SMT approaches support [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]] theories. However, many real-world systems can only be modelled by means of non-linear arithmetic over the real numbers involving [[transcendental function]]s, e.g. an aircraft and its behavior. This fact motivates an extension of the SMT problem to non-linear theories, e.g. determine whether

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{lr}
&amp; (\sin(x)^3 = \cos(\log(y)\cdot x) \vee b \vee -x^2 \geq 2.3y) \wedge \left(\neg b \vee y &lt; -34.4 \vee \exp(x) &gt; {y \over x}\right)
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;b \in {\mathbb B}, x,y \in {\mathbb R}&lt;/math&gt;

is satisfiable. Then, such problems become [[undecidable problem|undecidable]] in general.  (It is important to note, however, that the theory of [[real closed field]]s, and thus the full first order theory of the [[real number]]s, are [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]] using [[quantifier elimination]].  This is due to [[Alfred Tarski]].)  The first order theory of the [[natural numbers]] with addition (but not multiplication), called [[Presburger arithmetic]], is also decidable.  Since multiplication by constants can be implemented as nested additions, the arithmetic in many computer programs can be expressed using Presburger arithmetic, resulting in decidable formulas.

Examples of SMT solvers addressing Boolean combinations of theory atoms from undecidable arithmetic theories over the reals are ABsolver,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Applications==
SMT solvers are useful both for verification, proving the correctness of programs, software testing based on symbolic execution, and for synthesis, generating program fragments by searching over the space of possible programs.

===Verification===
Computer-aided [[formal verification|verification of computer programs]] often uses SMT solvers. A common technique is to translate preconditions, postconditions, loop conditions, and assertions into SMT formulas in order to determine if all properties can hold.

There are many verifiers built on top of the [https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3 Z3] SMT solver. [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/boogie/ Boogie] is an intermediate verification language that uses Z3 to automatically check simple imperative programs. The [http://vcc.codeplex.com VCC] verifier for concurrent C uses Boogie, as well as [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/dafny/ Dafny] for imperative object-based programs, [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/chalice/ Chalice] for concurrent programs, and [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/specsharp/ Spec#] for C#. [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/fstar/ F*] is a dependently typed language that uses Z3 to find proofs; the compiler carries these proofs through to produce proof-carrying bytecode. The [http://viper.ethz.ch Viper verification infrastructure] encodes verification conditions to Z3. The [https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sbv sbv] library provides SMT-based verification of Haskell programs, and lets the user choose among a number of solvers such as Z3, ABC, Boolector, CVC4, MathSAT and Yices.

There are also many verifiers built on top of the [http://alt-ergo.ocamlpro.com/ Alt-Ergo] SMT solver. Here is a list of mature applications:
* [http://why3.lri.fr/ Why3], a platform for deductive program verification, uses Alt-Ergo as its main prover;
* CAVEAT, a C-verifier developed by CEA and used by Airbus; Alt-Ergo was included in the qualification DO-178C of one of its recent aircraft;
* [[Frama-C]], a framework to analyse C-code, uses Alt-Ergo in the Jessie and WP plugins (dedicated to "deductive program verification");
* [[SPARK (programming language)|SPARK]], uses CVC4 and Alt-Ergo (behind GNATprove) to automate the verification of some assertions in SPARK 2014;
* [[B-Method|Atelier-B]] can use Alt-Ergo instead of its main prover (increasing success from 84% to 98% on the [http://alt-ergo.lri.fr/documents/ABZ-2014.pdf ANR Bware project benchmarks]);
* [[Rodin tool|Rodin]], a B-method framework developed by Systerel, can use Alt-Ergo as a back-end;
* [http://cubicle.lri.fr/ Cubicle], an open source model checker for verifying safety properties of array-based transition systems.
* [https://www.easycrypt.info/ EasyCrypt], a toolset for reasoning about relational properties of probabilistic computations with adversarial code.

Many SMT solvers implement a common interface format called [http://smt-lib.org/ SMTLIB2] (such files usually have the extension "&lt;tt&gt;.smt2&lt;/tt&gt;"). The [https://ucsd-progsys.github.io/liquidhaskell-blog/ LiquidHaskell] 
tool implements a refinement type based verifier for Haskell that can use any SMTLIB2 compliant solver, e.g. CVC4, MathSat, or Z3.

===Symbolic-execution based analysis and testing===

An important application of SMT solvers is [[symbolic execution]] for analysis and testing of programs (e.g., [[concolic testing]]), aimed particularly at finding security vulnerabilities. Important actively-maintained tools in this category include [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/pg/public_psfiles/ndss2008.pdf SAGE] from [[Microsoft Research]], [https://klee.github.io/ KLEE], [http://s2e.epfl.ch/ S2E], and [https://triton.quarkslab.com Triton]. SMT solvers that are particularly useful for symbolic-execution applications include [https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3 Z3], [https://sites.google.com/site/stpfastprover/ STP], [https://sites.google.com/site/z3strsolver/ Z3str2], and [http://fmv.jku.at/boolector/ Boolector].

'''Sentinel species''' are [[organism]]s, often animals, used to detect risks to humans by providing advance warning of a danger. The terms primarily apply in the context of environmental hazards rather than those from other sources. Some animals can act as sentinels because they may be more susceptible or have greater exposure to a particular hazard than humans in the same environment.&lt;ref name="national research council"&gt;National Research Council (U.S.). Committee on Animals as Monitors of Environmental Hazards, "Animals as Sentinels of Environmental Health Hazards: Committee on Animals as Monitors of Environmental Hazards," National Academy Press: 1991, {{ISBN|0309040469}}.&lt;/ref&gt; People have long observed animals for signs of impending hazards or evidence of environmental threats. Plants and other living organisms have also been used for these purposes.

== Historical examples ==
There are countless examples of environmental effects on animals that later manifested in humans. The classic example is the "[[domestic canary|canary]] in the [[Coal mining|coal mine]]". The idea of placing a [[Atlantic canary|canary]] or other warm blooded animal in a mine to detect [[carbon monoxide]] was first proposed by [[John Scott Haldane]], in 1913 or later.&lt;ref name=acott&gt;{{cite journal |last=Acott |first=C. |title=JS Haldane, JBS Haldane, L Hill, and A Siebe: A brief resume of their lives. |journal=South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society Journal |volume=29 |issue=3 |year=1999 |issn=0813-1988 |oclc=16986801 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/6016 |accessdate=2008-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Boycott |first=A. E. |first2=G. C. C. |last2=Damant |first3=J. S. |last3=Haldane |title=Prevention of compressed air illness |journal=J. Hygiene |volume=8 |issue=03 |pages=342–443 |year=1908 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7489 |accessdate=2013-09-05 |doi=10.1017/S0022172400003399 |pmc=2167126 |pmid=20474365}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{The Timetables of Science|pages=411}}&lt;/ref&gt; Well into the 20th century, coal miners brought canaries into coal mines as an early-warning signal for toxic gases, primarily [[carbon monoxide]].&lt;ref&gt;David A. Bengston, Diane S. Henshel, "Environmental Toxicology and Risk Assessment: Biomarkers and Risk Assessment", ASTM International, 1996, {{ISBN|0803120311}}, p 220.&lt;/ref&gt; The birds, being more sensitive, would become sick before the miners, who would then have a chance to escape or put on protective [[respirators]].

In [[Minamata Bay|Minamata Bay, Japan]], [[Domestic cat|cats]] developed "[[Minamata disease|dancing cat fever]]" before humans were [[Minamata disease|affected]] due to eating mercury-contaminated fish.&lt;ref name="withrow"&gt;Stephen J. Withrow, David M. Vail, ''Withrow and MacEwen's Small Animal Clinical Oncology'', Elsevier: 2007, {{ISBN|0721605583}}, p. 73-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Dogs were recognized as early as 1939 to be more susceptible to tonsil cancer if they were kept in crowded urban environments.&lt;ref name="withrow" /&gt; Studies similarly found higher disease rates in animals exposed to tobacco smoke.&lt;ref name="withrow" /&gt; [[Yushō disease]] was similarly discovered when poultry began dying at alarming rates due to [[polychlorinated biphenyl]] poisoning, although not before approximately 14,000 people were affected.

== Characteristics ==
Animal sentinels must have measurable responses to the hazard in question, whether that is due to the animal's death, disappearance, or some other determinable aspect.&lt;ref name="national research council" /&gt;{{rp|34}} Many of these species are ideally [[Endangered species|unendangered]] and easy to handle. It is important that the species' range overlap with the range being studied.&lt;ref name="bds" /&gt; Often the ideal species is determined by the characteristics of the hazard.

For example, [[honey bee]]s are susceptible to [[air pollution]].&lt;ref name="national research council" /&gt;{{rp|35}} Similarly both [[bats]] and [[swallows]] have been used to monitor pesticide contamination due to their diet of insects that may have been affected by the chemicals.&lt;ref name="national research council" /&gt;{{rp|35}} By the same token, aquatic animals, or their direct predators, are used as sentinel species to monitor [[water pollution]].{{cn|date=August 2017}}

Some species may show effects of a contaminant before humans due to their size, their reproductive rate, or their increased exposure to the contaminant.&lt;ref name="bds"&gt;Arthur D. Bloom, Frederick de Serres, ''Ecotoxicity and Human Health: A Biological Approach to Environmental Remediation'', CRC Press: 1995, {{ISBN|1566701414}}, page 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specific applications ==
[[File:Sarin test rabbit.jpg|thumb|upright|Rabbit used to check for leaks at [[Sarin gas|Sarin nerve gas]] production plant.]]

=== Toxic gases ===
Canaries were iconically used in [[coal mines]] to detect the presence of [[carbon monoxide]]. The bird's rapid breathing rate, small size, and high metabolism, compared to the miners, led birds in dangerous mines to succumb before the miners, thereby giving them time to take action.

=== Air and water pollution ===
A number of animals have been used to measure varying kinds of air pollution. These include [[honey bee]]s for air pollution, [[bivalve molluscs]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://molluscan-eye.epoc.u-bordeaux1.fr/index.php?rubrique=accueil&amp;lang=en]&lt;/ref&gt; for online water-quality survey and [[pigeon]]s for atmospheric lead.&lt;ref name="national research council" /&gt;{{rp|35}} Bats and swallows have been used to monitor pesticide contamination due to their diet of insects that may have been affected by the chemicals.&lt;ref name="national research council" /&gt;{{rp|35}}

Aquatic [[DDT]] pollution has been quantitatively measured in [[California]] fish. [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]] has been measured through the analysis of fish livers.&lt;ref name="national research council" /&gt;{{rp|82}} [[Toxaphene]] concentrations were discovered far from the area of its use through analysis of [[trout]] in the [[Great Lakes]].&lt;ref name="national research council" /&gt;{{rp|85}} The evidence of atmospheric transport of the substance influenced the subsequent prohibition of its widespread use. [[Alligators]] may have been used to warn of hazardous contamination in [[Centreville, Mississippi]] retention ponds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Eugene Love Fair Jr. |publication-date=May 28, 2013 |title=Christmas v. Exxon Mobil |work= [[Mississippi Court of Appeals]] |url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ms-court-of-appeals/1632483.html |accessdate=January 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Infectious diseases ===
The discovery of [[West Nile virus]] in the Western Hemisphere was heralded by an outbreak of disease in crows and other wild birds. Other emerging diseases have demonstrated linkages between animal health events and human risk, including [[monkeypox]], [[SARS]], and [[avian influenza]]. In outbreaks of bubonic plague, rats begin dying out before humans.

=== Household toxins ===
[[Dog]]s may provide early warning of [[lead poisoning]] hazards in a home, and certain cancers in dogs and [[cat]]s have been linked to household exposures to [[pesticide]]s, [[cigarette]] smoke, and other carcinogens.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7080">'''Spurious trip level''' (STL) is defined as a discrete level for specifying the spurious trip requirements of safety functions to be allocated to safety systems. An STL of 1 means that this safety function has the highest level of spurious trips. The higher the STL level the lower the number of spurious trips caused by the safety system. There is no limit to the number of spurious trip levels.

Safety functions and systems are installed to protect people, the environment and for asset protection. A safety function should only activate when a dangerous situation occurs. A safety function that activates without the presence of a dangerous situation (e.g., due to an internal failure) causes economic loss. The spurious trip level concept represents the probability that safety function causes a spurious (unscheduled) trip.

The STL is a metric that is used to specify the performance level of a safety function in terms of the spurious trips it potentially causes. Typical safety systems that benefit from an STL level are defined in standards like [[IEC 61508]]&lt;ref&gt;IEC 61508: Functional safety of electrical/electronic/programmable electronic safety-related systems, IEC, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; [[IEC 61511]],&lt;ref&gt;IEC 61511 - Functional safety - Safety instrumented systems for the process industry sector, IEC, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; IEC 62061,&lt;ref&gt;Safety of machinery - Functional safety of safety-related electrical, electronic and programmable electronic control systems, IEC, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; ISA S84,&lt;ref&gt;ANSI/ISA-84.00.01-2004 Part 1 (IEC 61511-1 Mod) Functional Safety: Safety Instrumented Systems for the Process Industry Sector&lt;/ref&gt; EN 50204&lt;ref&gt;EN 50204 - Electrical apparatus for the detection and measurement of combustible or toxic gases or vapours or of oxygen. Requirements on the functional safety of fixed gas detection systems&lt;/ref&gt; and so on. An STL provides end-users of safety functions with a measurable attribute that helps them define the desired availability of their safety functions. An STL can be specified for a complete safety loop or for individual devices.

For end-users there is always a potential conflict between the cost of safety solutions and the loss of profitability caused by spurious trips of these safety solutions. The STL concept helps the end-users to end this conflict in a way that safety solutions provide both the desired safety and the desired process availability.

== STL determination ==
The spurious trip level represents asset loss due to an internal failure of the safety function. The more financial damage the safety function can cause due to a spurious trip the higher the STL level of the safety function should be. Each company needs to decide for themselves which level of financial loss they can or are willing to take. This actually depends on many different factors including the financial strength of the company, the insurance policy they have, the cost of process shutdown and startup, and so on. All these factors are unique to each company. The table below shows an example of how a company can calibrate its spurious trip levels.

|}

== STL levels ==
The STL level achieved by a safety function is determined by the probability of fail safe (PFS) of this safety function. The PFS value is determined by internal failures of the safety system that cause the safety function to be executed without a demand from the process. The table below demonstrates the PFS value and spurious trip reduction values of each STL level.

== STL vs SIL ==
Today standards only define the [[safety integrity level]] (SIL) for safety functions. Standards do not define STL levels because they do in first instance not represent safety but economic loss. Despite this the STL is also a safety attribute, specially for safety functions in the process, oil &amp; gas, chemical and nuclear industry. In those industries an undesired shutdown of the process leads to dangerous situation as the plant needs to be started up again. Startup and shutdown of a process plant are considered the two most dangerous operational modes of the plant and should be limited to the absolute minimum.

In practice the STL and SIL concepts complement each other. Both factors are attributes of the same safety function. The STL level is determined by the average PFS value of the safety function. The SIL level is determined by the average probability of failure on demand. PFD value of the safety function. The STL level expresses the probability of spurious trips by the safety function, i.e., the safety function is executed without a demand from the process. The SIL level expresses the probability that the safety function does not work upon demand from the process. Both parameters are important to end-users in order to achieve safety and asset protection.

In order to calculate the PFS or PFD value of a safety loop it is necessary to have a reliability model and reliability data for each component in the safety loop. The best reliability model to use is a Markov model (see [[Andrey Markov]]). Typical data required are:
* Lambda safe detected
* Lambda safe undetected
* Lambda dangerous detected
* Lambda dangerous undetected
* Repair rate

'''Svend Nielsen''' (1919–2013) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] born [[architect]] and [[Architectural engineering|architectural engineer]]. Nielsen with his partner, Carl Johnson, founded the firm Johnson and Nielsen. Nielsen was influential in the construction of many important structures in Southern California, including the [[Discovery Cube Orange County|Discovery Cube]] in [[Orange County, California|Orange County]],&lt;ref name="ocreg"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Earley|first1=Christopher|title=Newport engineer leaves mark on landscape|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/nielsen-513374-johnson-newport.html|accessdate=August 3, 2016|publisher=Orange County Register|date=August 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Coussoulis Arena]] in [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]] (notable for its "spider-like" exterior frame work) and, most famously, the [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|Forum]] in [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood, CA]], which was the first structure of its kind to be built without support pillars.&lt;ref name="legacy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Svend H. Nielsen's Obituary on The Press-Enterprise|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/pe/obituary.aspx?pid=165203056|website=The Press-Enterprise|accessdate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The engineering of the Forum was quite a feat as the structural design allowed no obstructed seats in the entire arena.

Within the City of [[Riverside, California|Riverside]], three separate structures have been declared City Landmarks, including the Set Free Thrift Store on 14th Street, the Riverside Office Supply Store on 14th Street (refaced in 2013) and a garage on Market Street (demolished for redevelopment in 2012). All of these structures feature [[Mid-century modern|Mid Century Modern style architecture]] that was indicative of Nielsen's Danish influences.&lt;ref name="propview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Address search - City of Riverside, California|url=http://olmsted.riversideca.gov/propertyviewer/|website=olmsted.riversideca.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nielsen also designed and engineered the Danish Lutheran Church and Cultural Center located in Yorba Linda, California,&lt;ref name="legacy" /&gt; the Bachelor Quarters for the U.S. Naval base in Long Beach&lt;ref name="LAtimes"&gt;{{cite news|title=Naval Quarters to Be Finished in June|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-01-29/realestate/re-1746_1_naval-quarters|work=Los Angeles Times|date=January 29, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over 5,000 other buildings.&lt;ref name="ocreg" /&gt;

In addition to his work in architecture and engineering, Nielsen was one of the founding members of the California Seismic Review Board, which would generate the guidelines that would later become the foundation for Chapter 34, of the existing building and structures code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.calstate.edu/cpdc/ae/review/documents/2003-2004.pdf|accessdate=8/3/2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recently, [[Nielsen Pool House|Nielsen's own home]] in Riverside, California has been named a City of Riverside City of Riverside Landmark (City of Riverside Landmark #134). The unique home, fully designed and constructed by Nielsen himself, was completed in 1966 and is considered to be quintessentially representative of Mid Century Modern Architecture. Built on to a slope overlooking a lake on the 12th hole of the Victoria Country Club Golf Course, the home features large concrete columns, some as high as 20 feet, which support the home above the slope. However, the most notable feature of the home is its design, in which it is built entirely around an indoor swimming pool. The swimming pool room is over 2,000 square feet and features 20' tall ceilings and a retractable roof that opens to the sky.&lt;ref name="meeting"&gt;{{cite web|title=Meeting of Cultural Heritage Board on 7/20/2016|url=https://riversideca.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=496574&amp;GUID=94075157-2898-4C06-BF96-20D22CFC9DD1&amp;Options=info&amp;Search=|website=City of Riverside|date=July 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Taoism}}
{{refimprove|date=October 2018}}
'''Taoist sexual practices''' ({{lang-zh|s=房中术|t=房中術|p=fángzhōngshù}}), literally "the bedroom arts", are the ways [[Taoism|Taoists]] may practice [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]].  These practices are also known as "Joining Energy" or "The Joining of the Essences".  Practitioners believe that by performing these sexual arts, one can stay in good health, and attain longevity or spiritual advancement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/heart-and-soul-healing/201210/tantric-and-taoist-practices-improve-sex|title=Tantric and Taoist Practices to Improve Sex|website=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dr STEVEN LIU and JONATHAN BLANK SECRETS OF DRAGON GATE 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegreattao.com/html/taoofsexology.html|title=Tao of Sexology: Sexual Wisdom and Methods|website=www.thegreattao.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Some Taoist sects during the [[Han dynasty]] performed [[sexual intercourse]] as a spiritual practice, called "Héqì" (合氣], "Joining Energy"){{cn|date=October 2018}}. The first sexual texts that survive today are those found at the [[Mawangdui]]{{cn|date=October 2018}}. While [[Taoism]] had not yet fully evolved as a philosophy at this time, these texts shared some remarkable similarities with later [[Tang dynasty]] texts, such as the [[Ishinpō|Ishinpō (醫心方)]]. The sexual arts arguably reached their climax between the end of the [[Han dynasty]] and the end of the Tang dynasty{{cn|date=October 2018}}. 

After 1000 AD, [[Confucian]] restraining attitudes towards sexuality became stronger, so that by the beginning of the [[Qing dynasty]] in 1644, sex was a [[taboo]] topic in public life{{cn|date=October 2018}}. These Confucians alleged that the separation of genders in most social activities existed 2,000 years ago, and suppressed the sexual arts. Because of the [[taboo]] surrounding sex, there was much [[censorship|censoring]] done during the Qing in literature, and the sexual arts disappeared in public life{{cn|date=October 2018}}. As a result, some of the [[Document|texts]] survived only in [[Japan]], and most scholars had no idea that such a different concept of sex existed in [[History of China|early China]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Gulik (1961), preface&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient and medieval practices==

===Qi (lifeforce) and jing (essence)===
The basis of all Taoist thinking is that [[qi| qi (氣)]] is part of everything in existence.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Qi is related to another energetic substance contained in the human body known as [[jing (TCM)|jing (精)]], and once all this has been expended the body dies. Jing can be lost in many ways, but most notably through the loss of body fluids. Taoists may use practices to stimulate/increase and conserve their bodily fluids to great extents.  The fluid believed to contain the most Jing is semen. Therefore, Taoists believe in decreasing the frequency of, or totally avoiding, ejaculation in order to conserve life essence.&lt;ref name="Wile 1992, p. 6"&gt;Wile (1992), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Male control of ejaculation===
Many [[Taoist]] practitioners link the loss of ejaculatory fluids to the loss of vital life force: where excessive fluid loss results in premature aging, disease, and general fatigue.  While some Taoists contend that one should never ejaculate, others provide a specific formula to determine the maximum amount of regular [[ejaculation]]s in order to maintain health.&lt;ref&gt;Wile (1992), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

The general idea is to limit the loss of fluids as much as possible to the level of your desired practice.  As these sexual practices were passed down over the [[centuries]], some practitioners have given less importance to the limiting of ejaculation.  Nevertheless, the "retention of the [[semen]]" is one of the foundational tenets of Taoist sexual practice.&lt;ref&gt;Wile (1992), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are different methods to control ejaculation prescribed by the Taoists. In order to avoid [[ejaculation]], the man could do one of several things. He could pull out immediately before [[orgasm]], a method which [[Joseph Needham]] termed "coitus conservatus".&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1983), p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; A second method involved the man applying pressure on the [[perineum]], thus retaining the sperm. While, if done incorrectly can cause a [[retrograde ejaculation]], the Taoists believed that the jing traveled up into the head and "nourished the brain."&lt;ref&gt;Wile (1993), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jing===
Another important concept of "The Joining of the Essences" was that the union of a man and a woman would result in the creation of [[jing (TCM)|jing (精)]], a type of sexual energy. When in the act of lovemaking, jing would form, and the man could transform some of this jing into qi, and replenish his lifeforce. By having as much sex as possible, men had the opportunity to transform more and more jing, and as a result would see many health benefits.&lt;ref name="Wile 1992, p. 6"/&gt;

===Yin/Yang===

The concept of [[Yin and yang]] is important in Taoism, and consequently also holds special importance in sex. Yang usually referred to the male sex, whereas Yin could refer to the female sex. Man and Woman were the equivalent of heaven and earth, but became disconnected. Therefore, while heaven and earth are eternal, man and woman suffer a premature death.&lt;ref&gt;Wile (1992), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;  Every interaction between Yin and Yang had significance. Because of this significance, every position and action in lovemaking had importance. Taoist texts described a large number of special sexual positions that served to cure or prevent illness.&lt;ref&gt;Wile (1992), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women===

For Taoists, sex was not just about pleasing the man{{cn|date=October 2018}}. The woman also had to be stimulated and pleased in order to benefit from the act of sex{{cn|date=October 2018}}. Sex should not happen if one or the other partners desire it more. If sex were performed in this manner, the woman would create more jing, and the man could more easily absorb the jing to increase his own qi. Women were also given a prominent place in the [[Ishinpō]], with the tutor being a woman. One of the reasons women had a great deal of strength in the act of sex was that they walked away undiminished from the act. The woman had the power to bring forth life, and did not have to worry about ejaculation or refractory period{{cn|date=October 2018}}.

Women were often given a position of inferiority in sexual practice{{cn|date=October 2018}}. Many of the texts{{which|date=October 2018}} discuss sex from a male point of view, and avoid discussing how sex could benefit women. Men were encouraged to not limit themselves to one woman, and were advised to have sex only with the woman who was beautiful and not yet produced children. While the man had to please the woman sexually, she was still just an object.&lt;ref&gt;Wile (1992), p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; At numerous points during the Ishinpō, the woman is referred to as the "enemy"; this was because the woman could cause him to spill semen and lose vitality. In later sexual texts from the Ming, women had lost all semblance of being human and were referred to as the "other," "crucible", or "stove" from which to cultivate vitality.  The importance of pleasing the woman was also diminished in later texts.&lt;ref&gt;Wile (1992), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The practice was known as ([[:zh:采阴补阳|Caibu (採補)]]), as a man enters many women without ejaculation.

Women were also considered to be a means for men to extend men's lives{{cn}. Many of the ancient texts were dedicated explanation of how a man could use sex to extend his own life. But, his life was extended only through the absorption of the woman's vital energies (jing and qi). Some Taoists called the act of sex “The battle of stealing and strengthening.”&lt;ref&gt;Wile (1992), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; These sexual methods could be correlated with Taoist military methods. Instead of storming the gates, the battle was a series of feints and maneuvers that would sap the enemy's resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Wile (1992), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===When and where===

Another text, ''Health Benefits of the Bedchamber''{{cn|date=October 2018}}, indicates that certain times were better for [[sexual intercourse|intercourse]] than others. A person had to avoid having [[sexual intercourse|intercourse]] on [[Quarter moon|quarter]] or [[full moon]]s and on [[days]] when there were great [[winds]], [[rain]], [[fog]], [[cold]] or [[heat]], [[thunder]], [[lightning]], [[darkness]] over [[heaven and earth]]{{dn|date=October 2018}}, [[solar eclipses|solar]] and [[lunar eclipses]], [[rainbow]]s and [[earthquake]]s. Having intercourse at these times would harm a [[man]]'s spirit and would cause [[women]] to become [[illness|ill]]. [[Children]] [[Fertilisation|conceived]] at these times would be [[wikt:mad|mad]], [[stupid]], [[perverse]] or [[wikt:foolish|foolish]]; [[Muteness|mute]], [[deaf]], [[crippled]] or [[Visual impairment|blind]]; [[Filial piety|unfilial]] and [[violent]]{{dubious|date=October 2018}}.

Also important was selecting the right day for intercourse if a person desired children. After the woman's [[menstrual period|period]], the first, third or fifth days were the best. If on these days the man [[ejaculation|ejaculated]] after [[midnight]], the child would likely be male. If a female child was desired, the man needed to ejaculate on the second, fourth or sixth days after the cessation of the woman's [[menstrual period|period]]{{cn|date=October 2018}}.

The location of [[sex|sexual intercourse]] was also important. People had to avoid the glare of the [[sun]], [[moon]] or [[stars]], the interior of [[shrines]], proximity to [[temples]], [[Water well|wells]], [[stoves]] and [[wikt:privy|privies]], and the vicinity of [[grave]]s or [[coffin]]s{{cn|date=October 2018}}.

If these suggestions were followed "the family's offspring would be [[good]], wise and [[virtuous]]". If they were not followed, "the [[offspring]] would be [[evil]] and the [[family]] would eventually die off".&lt;ref&gt;Wile (1992), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Longevity and immortality===
Some [[Ming dynasty]] Taoist [[sect]]s believed that one way for men to achieve longevity or 'towards immortality' is by having intercourse with [[virgin]]s, particularly young virgins. Taoist sexual books, such as the ''Hsuan wei Hshin'' ("Mental Images of the Mysteries and Subtleties of Sexual Techniques") and ''San Feng Tan Cheueh'' ("Zhang Sanfeng's Instructions in the Physiological Alchemy"), written, respectively, by Zhao Liangpi and Zhang Sanfeng (not to be confused with semi-mythical [[Zhang Sanfeng]] who lived in an earlier period), call the woman sexual partner ''[[Ding (vessel)|ding]]'' ([[wiktionary:鼎|鼎]]) and recommend sex with [[menarche|premenarche]] virgins. Zhao Liangpi concludes that the ideal ''ding'' is a premenarche virgin just under 14 years of age and women older than 18 should be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mental Images of the Mysteries and Subtleties of Sexual Techniques |first1=Zhao |last1=Lianpi |first2=Hsuan Wei |last2=Hshin}} (published before 1850)&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhang Sanfeng went further and divided ''ding'' into three ranks: the lowest rank, 21- to 25-year-old women; the middle rank, 16- to 20-year-old [[Menstruation|menstruating]] virgins; the highest rank, 14-year-old premenarche virgins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=XyChBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA56 |author-link=Ruan Fangfu |first=Fang Fu |last=Ruan |editor-first=Molleen |editor-last=Matsumura |title=Sex in China: Studies in Sexology in Chinese Culture |date=31 October 1991 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |chapter=The Value of Virgins as Sex Partners |page=56 |quote=Almost all Taoist sex handbooks recommend that the "ding" should be a girl of 14 to 16, just before or after menarch. In Zhang '''Sanfeng''''s Instructions in Physiological Alchemy, "ding" were classified into three ranks. The lowest rank comprised women between the ages of 21 and 25. The middle rank compromised 16- to 20-year-old virgins after menarch. The highest rank comprised 14-year-old virgins before menarch.}} ("The Role of Sexual Lore in Taoism" begins on page 50, this is a 2013 edition of a 1991 book)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/SEN/CH23.HTM#b1-TAOISM%20AND%20SEX |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021216190909/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/SEN/CH23.HTM |archive-date=16 December 2002 |title=Human Sexuality: An Encyclopedia |section=Taoism and Sex |quote=The Taoist sexual books, such as the Hsuan wei Hshin (Mental Images of the Mysteries and Subtleties of Sexual Techniques') and San Feng Tan Cheueh (Zhang Sanfeng's Instructions in the Physiological Alchemy), written, respectively, by Zhao '''Liang Pi''' and Zhang '''San Feng''', state that the most desirable ding is a girl about 14, 15, or 16 years old just before or after menarche. Zhang '''Sanfeng''' went further and divided ding into three ranks: the lowest rank, 21- to 25-year-old women; the middle rank, 16- to 20-year-old menstruating virgin girls; and the highest rank, 14-year-old premenarche virgin girls.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Ge Hong]], a 4th-century Taoist [[alchemy|alchemist]], "those seeking 'immortality' must perfect the absolute essentials. These consist of treasuring the jing, circulating the qi and consuming the great medicine."&lt;ref name="Wile 1992, p. 24"&gt;Wile (1992), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The sexual arts concerned the first precept, treasuring the jing. This is partially because treasuring the jing involved sending it up into the brain. In order to send the jing into the brain, the male had to refrain from ejaculation during sex. According to some Taoists, if this was done, the jing would travel up the spine and nourish the brain instead of leaving the body. Ge Hong also states, however, that it is folly to believe that performing the sexual arts only can achieve immortality and some of the ancient myths on sexual arts had been misinterpreted and exaggerated. Indeed, the sexual arts had to be practiced alongside [[alchemy]] to attain longevity. Ge Hong also warned it could be dangerous if practiced incorrectly.&lt;ref name="Wile 1992, p. 24"/&gt;

[[File:Page from The Indian Antiquary.jpg|thumbnail|right|Cover page of a 1931 edition of ''The Indian Antiquary'']]
'''''The Indian Antiquary, A journal of oriental research in archaeology, history, literature, language, philosophy, religion, folklore, &amp;c, &amp;c,''''' (subtitle varies) was a journal of original research relating to India, published between 1872 and 1933. It was founded by the archaeologist [[James Burgess (archaeologist)|James Burgess]] to enable the sharing of knowledge between scholars based in Europe and in India and was notable for the high quality of its epigraphic illustrations which enabled scholars to make accurate translations of texts that in many cases remain the definitive versions to this day. It was also pioneering in its recording of Indian [[folklore]]. It was succeeded by ''The New Indian Antiquary'' (1938-47) and the ''Indian Antiquary'' (1964-71).

==History==
''The Indian Antiquary'' was founded in 1872 by the archaeologist [[James Burgess (archaeologist)|James Burgess]] [[Order of the Indian Empire|CIE]] as a journal of original research relating to India. It was designed to enable the sharing of knowledge between scholars based in Europe and in India.&lt;ref name=Pros&gt;[http://indianhistorybooks.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/indian-antiquary-vol-i-1872.pdf Prospectus] in ''The Indian Antiquary'', Part 1, 5 January 1872, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Indian Antiquary" in ''[[The Antiquaries Journal]]'', Vol. 2, No. 2, April 1922, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The journal was a private venture,&lt;ref name=Temp&gt;[[Richard Carnac Temple|Temple, Richard Carnac]]. (1922) ''[https://archive.org/details/fiftyyearsofthei00temprich Fifty years of The Indian Antiquary]''. Mazgaon, Bombay: B. Miller, British India Press, pp. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt; although no contributor or editor was ever paid for their work and the editors often had to support the publication out of their own pockets.&lt;ref name=Temp/&gt; Burgess was the first editor and he continued in that role until the end of 1884 when failing eyesight forced him to hand over to John Faithfull Fleet and [[Richard Carnac Temple]].&lt;ref name=Temp/&gt;

The late nineteenth century was marked by a great increase in the number of local historical societies in India and a similar increase in the number of Indians who could speak and write English, to the extent that by the 1920s the entire journal could have been filled with work by Indian contributors.&lt;ref name="Temple, p. 7"/&gt; Volumes for 1925 to 1932 were published under the authority of the Council of the [[Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|Royal Anthropological Institute]] (1933, not).&lt;ref name=sun/&gt; The first incarnation of the ''Antiquary'' ceased publication in 1933 with volume 62, number 783 (Dec. 1933),&lt;ref name=sun&gt;[http://suncat.ac.uk/serials/SC00623823801/all ''Indian antiquary''.] Suncat.

The '''''New Indian Antiquary''''' was published between 1938&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southasiaarchive.com/Content/sarf.120202 ''New Indian Antiquary''.] South Asia Archive, 2014. Retrieved 30 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and 1947, and the '''''Indian Antiquary''''' (described as the "third series") between 1964 and 1971.&lt;ref name=BL&gt;''Indian Antiquary'', British Library catalogue search, 29 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; (Volumes 14 to 62 of the original ''Antiquary'' were described as the "second series".)&lt;ref&gt;''Indian Antiquary'', British Library catalogue search, 10 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The journal had an archaeological and historical focus, and in the late nineteenth century that naturally meant that [[epigraphy]] (the study of inscriptions as writing rather than as literature) would be one of the principal subjects covered in its pages.&lt;ref name=Sal&gt;{{cite book|author=Salomon, Richard (1998)|title=Indian Epigraphy: A Guide to the Study of Inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the other Indo-Aryan Languages: A Guide to the Study of Inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the other Indo-Aryan Languages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XYrG07qQDxkC&amp;pg=PA219|date=|location= New York|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-535666-3|page=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the ''Antiquary'' was the premier source of European scholarship on Indian epigraphy until the twentieth century and the official Indian government journal of epigraphy, the ''[[Epigraphia Indica]]'', was published as a quarterly supplement to the ''Antiquary'' between 1892 and 1920.&lt;ref name=Temp/&gt;

The ''Antiquary'' was printed at [[Mazgaon]], Bombay, by the [[Bombay Education Society]] and later the British India Press, but illustrations were produced in London by the firm of Griggs who were known for the accuracy of their work.&lt;ref name=Temple.p.6/&gt; A high standard of reproduction was essential so that scholars could work on the epigraphic material without needing to see the originals.&lt;ref name=Temple.p.6&gt;Temple, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Illustrations in the ''Antiquary'' were used by scholars such as Bhandarkar, [[Bhagvanlal Indraji]], [[Georg Bühler]], [[John Faithfull Fleet]], Eggeling and B. Lewis Rice to decipher important inscriptions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://asi.nic.in/asi_aboutus_history.asp ''History'',] [[Archaeological Survey of India]], 2011. Retrieved 30 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and in many cases their translations remain the definitive versions to this day.&lt;ref name=Sal/&gt;

Over one thousand plates were included in ''The Indian Antiquary'' and the ''Epigraphia Indica'' over the first fifty years of publication, but having the illustrations produced abroad was not without its disadvantages. On one occasion during World War I, enemy action meant that expensive plates had to be sent from London three times before they reached Bombay safely.&lt;ref name=Temple.p.6/&gt;

Another area where the ''Antiquary'' led was in recording folklore and folktales. Its publication of [[Punjab region|Punjab]] folktales was the first attempt to classify the events on which folk tales were based&lt;ref name="Temple, p. 7"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/fiftyyearsofthei00temprich#page/6/mode/2up Temple, p. 7.]&lt;/ref&gt; and the pioneering work on north Indian folklore of [[William Crooke]] and [[Ram Gharib Chaube|Pandit Ram Gharib Chaube]] was printed in its pages.&lt;ref name="CrookeChaube2002"&gt;"Introduction" by Sadhana Naithani in {{cite book|author1=William Crooke|author2=Pandit Ram Gharib Chaube|author3=|title=Folktales from Northern India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RcK2l0yE1OsC&amp;pg=PT38|date=2002|location=Santa Barbara|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-698-9|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''vaginal septum''' is a [[vaginal anomalies|vaginal anomaly]] that is partition within the [[vagina]]; such a [[septum]] could be either longitudinal or transverse. In some affected women, the septum is partial or does not extend the length or width of the vagina.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heinonen|first=Pentti K.|date=2006-03-01|title=Complete septate uterus with longitudinal vaginal septum|url=http://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(05)03968-3/fulltext|journal=Fertility and Sterility|language=English|volume=85|issue=3|pages=700–705|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2005.08.039|issn=0015-0282}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dyspareunia|Pain during intercourse]] can be a symptom. A longitudinal vaginal septum develops during [[embryogenesis]] when there is an incomplete fusion of the lower parts of the two [[Müllerian duct]]s. As a result, there may appear to be two openings to the vagina. There may be associated duplications of the more cranial parts of the Müllerian derivatives, a double [[cervix]], and either a [[uterine septum]] or [[uterus didelphys]] (double uterus).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Perez-Brayfield MR, Clarke HS, Pattaras JG |title=Complete bladder, urethral, and vaginal duplication in a 50-year-old woman |journal=Urology |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=514 |date=September 2002 |pmid=12350504 |doi=10.1016/S0090-4295(02)01808-3  |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0090429502018083}}&lt;/ref&gt; A transverse septum forms during embryogenesis when the Müllerian ducts do not fuse to the [[urogenital sinus]].

[[File:Chipperfield, War Memorial and The Two Brewers - geograph.org.uk - 122311.jpg|thumb|[[Chipperfield]], [[Hertfordshire]]&lt;br /&gt;village green and war memorial]]

A '''village green''' is a [[commons|common]] open area within a [[village]] or other settlement. Traditionally, a village green was common [[pasture|grassland]] at the centre of a rural settlement used for grazing with a pond for watering cattle and other stock.

The village green also provided, and may still provide, an open-air meeting place for the local people, which may be used for public celebrations such as [[May Day]] festivities. The term is used more broadly to encompass woodland, moorland, sports grounds, buildings and roads.

==History==
[[File:House on Village Green, Melmerby - geograph.org.uk - 236245.jpg|thumb|Village green&lt;br /&gt;[[Melmerby, Cumbria]]]]
[[File:Stanford in the Vale village green (2002).jpg|thumb|The village green in [[Stanford in the Vale]], [[Oxfordshire]]]]
[[File:Pritzhagen 07.jpg|thumb|A large green in the village of Pritzhagen, Germany]]
Some historical village greens have been lost as a result of the [[British Agricultural Revolution|agricultural revolution]] and [[urbanization|urban development]]. Greens are now most likely to be found in the older villages of mainland Europe, the United Kingdom, and older areas of the United States. Town expansion in the mid-20th century led in England to the formation of local [[conservation ethic|conservation]] societies, often centring on village green preservation, as celebrated and parodied in [[The Kinks]]' album ''[[The Kinks Are The Village Green Preservation Society]]''. The [[Open Spaces Society]] is a present-day UK national campaigning body which continues this movement.

The term may apply to [[urban park]]s. In the United States, the most famous example{{cn|date=March 2017}} of a town green is probably the [[New Haven Green]] in [[New Haven]], [[Connecticut]]. New Haven was founded by settlers from England and was the first planned city in the United States. Originally used for grazing livestock, the Green dates from the 1630s and is well preserved today despite lying at the heart of [[downtown New Haven|the city centre]]. The largest green in the U.S. is a mile in length, and can be found in [[Lebanon, Connecticut]]. One of the most unusual is the [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]] Green in [[Hanover, New Hampshire]], which was owned and cleared by the college in 1770. The college, not the town, still owns it and surrounded it with buildings as a sort of collegiate quadrangle in the 1930s, although its origin as a town green remains apparent.
A fine example of a traditional American town green exists in downtown [[Morristown, NJ]]. The [[Morristown Green]] dates from 1715 and has hosted events ranging from executions to clothing drives.

Apart from the general use of the term, ''village green'' has a specific legal meaning in England and Wales, and also includes the less common term ''town green''. Town and village greens were defined in the [[Commons Registration Act 1965]], as amended by the [[Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000]], as land:
# which has been allotted by or under any Act for the exercise or recreation of the inhabitants of any locality
# or on which the inhabitants of any locality have a customary right to indulge in lawful sports and pastimes
# or if it is land on which for not fewer than twenty years a significant number of the inhabitants of any locality, or of any neighbourhood within a locality, have indulged in lawful sports and pastimes as of right.

Registered greens are now governed by the [[Commons Act 2006]], but the fundamental test of whether land is a town and village green remains the same. Thus land can become a village green if it has been used for twenty years without force, secrecy or request (''nec vi, nec clam, nec precario'').&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of the law on this, see Austen-Baker, R. and Mayfield, B.,"Uncommon Confusion: Parallel Jurisprudence in Town and Village Green Applications" [2012] Conveyancer 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Village green legislation is often used to try to frustrate development. Recent case law (''Oxfordshire County Council vs Oxford City Council and Robinson'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2006/25.html |title=Oxfordshire County Council v. Oxford City Council &amp; Ors (2005) and others [2006&amp;#93; UKHL 25 (24 May 2006) |publisher=Bailii.org |accessdate=14 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; makes it clear that registration as a green would render any development which prevented continuing use of the green as a criminal activity under the [[Inclosure Act 1857]] and the [[Commons Act 1876]]. This leads to some most curious areas being claimed as village greens, sometimes with success. Recent examples include a bandstand,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iwight.com/council/committees/Human%20Resources%20and%20Misc%20Appeals/1-9-06/Paper%20B.htm&lt;/ref&gt; two lakes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-north-west-wales-14043544 |title= Llyn Maelog lake on Anglesey given village green status |author= |date=7 July 2011 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a beach.&lt;ref&gt;[2013] EWCA Civ 276&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Open Spaces Society]] states that in 2005 there were about 3,650 registered greens in England covering {{convert|8150|acres|0|abbr=on}} and about 220 in [[Wales]] covering about {{convert|620|acres|0|abbr=on}}.

[[File:The large green village of Zuidlaren.JPG|thumb|A village green in Zuidlaren, [[Netherlands]]]]
[[File:Willerzie.jpg|thumb|The village green in Willerzie, [[Belgium]]]]
A notable example of a village green is that in the village of [[Finchingfield]] in Essex, England, which is said {{who|date=November 2012}} to be "the most photographed village in England". The green dominates the village, and slopes down to a duck pond, and is occasionally flooded after heavy rain. The small village of [[Car Colston]] in [[Nottinghamshire]], England, has two village greens, totaling 29 acres (12 ha).&lt;ref&gt;Good Pub Guide [http://www.thegoodpubguide.co.uk/pub/view/Royal-Oak-NG13-8JE Retrieved 2 April 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some greens that used to be a common or otherwise at the centre of a village have been swallowed up by a city growing around them. Sometimes they become a city park or a square, and manage to maintain a sense of place. London has several of these: [[Newington Green]] is a good example, with [[Newington Green Unitarian Church]] anchoring the northern end.

There are two places in the United States called Village Green: [[Village Green-Green Ridge, Pennsylvania]], and [[Village Green, New York]]. Some [[New England]] towns, along with some areas settled by New Englanders such as the townships in the [[Connecticut Western Reserve]], refer to their [[town square]] as a village green. The village green of Bedford, New York, is preserved as part of [[Bedford Village Historic District]]. The only village green in the United States still used for agriculture lies in [[Lebanon, Connecticut]]. This green is also one of the largest in the nation.

In [[Indonesia]], especially in [[Java]], a similar place is called ''Alun-Alun''. It is a central part of Javanese village architecture and culture.

The northern part of the province of [[Drenthe]] in the [[Netherlands]] is also known for its village greens. [[Zuidlaren]] is the village with the largest number of village greens in the Netherlands.

The [[Błonia Park]], originally established in the Middle Ages, is an example of a large village green in [[Kraków]], Poland.

The '''von Karman Institute for [[Fluid Dynamics]]''' (VKI) is a non-profit educational and scientific organization which specializes in three specific fields: aeronautics and aerospace, environment and applied fluid dynamics, turbomachinery and propulsion. Founded in 1956, it is located in [[Sint-Genesius-Rode]], Belgium.

==About VKI==
&lt;!--[[File: VKI Building.jpg|thumb|left|VKI Building]]--&gt;
The von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics is a non-profit international, educational and scientific organization which is working in three specific fields: ''[[aeronautics]] and [[aerospace]], environment and applied fluid dynamics, [[turbomachinery]] and [[Vehicle propulsion|propulsion]]''.

The VKI provides education in these specific areas for students from all over the world. A hundred students come to the Institute each year to study fluid dynamics, for a PhD programme, a research master in Fluid Dynamics, a final year project and also to gather further knowledge while doing a work placement in a specific area. 
 
Each year, Lecture Series and events are being organized inside and outside of the organization. These events emphasize on topics of great importance such as aerodynamics, fluid mechanics, heat transfer with application to aeronautics, space, turbomachinery, the environment and also industrial fluid dynamics. The Institute has built an international renown in these domains. Students who study these fields, researchers, industrials and engineers want to follow these Lecture Series. The information presented is accurate and reliable.

==History==
In the course of 1955, Professor [[Theodore von Kármán]] proposed with his assistants the establishment of an institution devoted to training and research in aerodynamics which would be open to young engineers and scientists of the [[NATO]] nations. It was strongly felt that this form of international undertaking would fulfil the important objective of fostering fruitful exchanges and understanding between the participating nations in a well-defined technical field. 

The von Karman Institute was established in October 1956 in the buildings which formed what then was the aeronautical laboratory of the Civil Aviation Authority of the Belgian Ministry of Communications.

The history of the laboratory goes back to 1922 when, on farmland purchased by the Belgian Government, the first building was erected to house the STAé (Service Technique de l'Aéronautique), i.e. the technical services of the Civil Aviation Authority then under the Ministry of Defence. The building was designed to accommodate a large low speed wind tunnel of the [[Gustave Eiffel#Later career|Eiffel]] type with an open return circuit and open-jet test section of 2 m diameter, as well as offices and shops. It still exists and has been refurbished internally after removal of the low speed tunnel to make room for modern turbomachinery and high speed facilities. A second building was added in 1935 to house offices and laboratories. It is now the Institute's administrative building. The last addition was made after the war, in 1949, with the construction of a large building specially designed to house a supersonic tunnel and a multi-configuration low speed facility.

It is interesting to recall what had been recommended by the AGARD Study Group of 1955 in terms of training and research: “The Institute should aim toward a training which, apart from its direct and obvious ties with aeronautical industries, would be of value in wider areas such as industrial or scientific research where the application of experimental techniques of aerodynamics would be profitable''.

In 1957, to celebrate the first anniversary of the institution, Theodore von Kármán began the event which would become known as the "beer meeting". At the end of this historic event, von Kármán declared that "the beer meeting must take place every Wednesday, beginning at 17:30 sharp".

==Structure==
There are three departments which are hosted at the von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics, from the older to the younger:

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:plasma2.jpg|thumb|right|Plasma]] --&gt;
* '''Aeronautics and Aerospace'''
A wide spectrum of facilities and computational tools covers the flow range from the low-speed regime of commercial aircraft to the supersonic and hypersonic regime of atmospheric space entry. The department focuses in particular on the modeling, simulation and experimental validation of atmospheric entry flows and thermal protection systems (TPS), including transition to turbulence and stability. The experimental studies are carried out in its top level Mach 14, Mach 6 and Induction Coupled Plasma windtunnels, for which dedicated measuring techniques have been developed e.g. involving spectroscopic laser techniques. On the computational simulation side the department has developed an extendable software platform [[Coolfluid]] for high performance computational flow simulation which incorporates the research on numerical algorithms, advanced physico-chemical and plasma models as well as fluid-structure interaction and conjugate heat transfer.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File: Turbomachinery VKI.jpg|thumb|left|Turbomachinery]] --&gt;
* '''Turbomachinery &amp; Propulsion'''
The [[Turbomachinery]] and [[Air propulsion|Propulsion]] department specializes in the aero-thermal aspects of turbomachinery components for aero-engines and industrial gas turbines, space propulsion units, steam turbines and process industry compressors and pumps. It has accumulated wide skills in high speed wind tunnel testing and related measurement techniques development and application. The department has acquired a world recognised expertise on steady/unsteady aerodynamic and aero/thermal aspects of high pressure, including cooling, and low pressure turbomachinery components through the design, development and use of a number of unique wind tunnels.

On the computational side, the department has over 20 years of experience in the analysis of flow in turbomachines, and in the design techniques and multi-disciplinary optimization methods or their components.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Station Polaire.jpg|thumb|right|Princess Elisabeth Antarctica Station]] --&gt;
* '''Environmental and applied Fluid Dynamics'''
The [[Environmental science|Environmental]] and Applied [[Fluid Dynamics]] (EA) department covers all kinds of activities complementary to the other two departments related to fluid dynamics in the academic and industrial world.  It has a large expertise in the study of aeroacoustics, multiphase flows, vehicle aerodynamics, biological  flows and environmental flows (including the study of interaction between atmospheric winds and human activities).  The department is also involved in the modeling of turbulence and in the development of advanced measurement techniques for fluid dynamics.  The department has acquired a unique expertise in the  study of fluid dynamics in industrial processes, with the development and construction of experimental facilities dedicated to the study of industrial  processes and also in the simulation of industrial flows using CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) codes.

==Lecture series==
The VKI organises up to twelve different one-week Lecture Series with about 50 to 60 participants on specialized topics every year on various fields: industrial applications, [[turbomachinery]], [[aerospace]], [[aerodynamics]], [[Vehicle propulsion|propulsion]], [[aero engine]], [[aeroacoustics]], biological flows, [[large eddy simulation]].
Each year, the VKI also organises thematic conferences in collaboration with Belgian &amp; foreign universities and research institutes.

These courses have gained worldwide recognition. Subjects are chosen carefully and the lecturers are well known for their professionalism and excellency in specific fields.

'''Web archiving''' is the process of collecting portions of the [[World Wide Web]] to ensure the information is [[digital preservation|preserved]] in an [[archive]] for future researchers, historians, and the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Decay of References to Web sites in Articles Published in General Medical Journals: Mainstream vs Small Journals|url = http://www.schattauer.de/index.php?id=1214&amp;doi=10.4338/ACI-2013-07-RA-0055|journal = Applied Clinical Informatics|date = 2013-01-01|volume = 4|issue = 4|doi = 10.4338/aci-2013-07-ra-0055|first = P.|last = Habibzadeh|first2 = Schattauer GmbH – Publishers for Medicine and Natural|last2 = Sciences|pmc = 3885908}}&lt;/ref&gt; Web archivists typically employ [[web crawler]]s for automated capture due to the massive size and amount of information on the Web.  The largest web archiving organization based on a bulk crawling approach is the [[Internet Archive]] which strives to maintain an archive of the entire Web. 

The International Web Archiving Workshop (IWAW), begun in 2001, has provided a platform to share experiences and exchange ideas. The later founding of the [[International Internet Preservation Consortium|International Internet Preservation Consortium (IIPC)]], in 2003, has greatly facilitated international collaboration in developing standards and open source tools for the creation of web archives. These developments, and the growing portion of human culture created and recorded on the web, combine to make it inevitable that more and more libraries and archives will have to face the challenges of web archiving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:25658314|title=Truman, Gail. 2016. Web Archiving Environmental Scan. Harvard Library Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National library|National libraries]], [[national archive]]s and various consortia of organizations are also involved in archiving culturally important Web content. 

Commercial web archiving software and services are also available to organizations who need to archive their own web content for corporate heritage, regulatory, or legal purposes.

==Provenance and development==

Early practice of web archiving involved the highlighting of a "site of the week award" as a record for the contest. Besides that, another early practice was the professional link list (for example [[Amnesty International]]'s list of human rights groups) and ([https://www.yahoo.com Yahoo!]) directory and Open Directory Project.

In the mid-1990s, one of the more important listing sites of its kind continually updated an index of worthwhile website destinations organized by content category.

In 1998, Yahoo directory was considered to have made a significant contribution to emerging online library science, not only by its classification scheme but also by the means of the content "navigation" it developed.

Soliciting, evaluating, and categorizing websites – the large-scale collecting, hand-sorting, and display of websites – could be considered an original form of website analysis. The rise of the algorithmic search engine has largely led to the disappearance of such manual methods.

==Collecting the web==
Web archivists generally archive various types of web content including [[HTML]] web pages, [[style sheet (web development)|style sheets]], [[JavaScript]], [[digital image|images]], and [[digital video|video]]. They also archive [[metadata]] about the collected resources such as access time, [[MIME type]], and content length.  This metadata is useful in establishing [[Authentication|authenticity]] and [[provenance]] of the archived collection.

==Methods of collection==
{{see also|List of Web archiving initiatives}}

===Remote harvesting===
The most common web archiving technique uses [[web crawler]]s to automate the process of collecting [[web page]]s.  Web crawlers typically access web pages in the same manner that users with a browser see the Web, and therefore provide a comparatively simple method of remote harvesting web content. Examples of web crawlers used for web archiving include:
* [[Heritrix]]
* [[HTTrack]]
* [[Wget]]

There exist various free services which may be used to archive web resources "on-demand", using web crawling techniques. These services include the [[Wayback Machine]] and [[WebCite]].

===Database archiving===
Database archiving refers to methods for archiving the underlying content of database-driven websites. It typically requires the extraction of the [[database]] content into a standard [[logical schema|schema]], often using [[XML]]. Once stored in that standard format, the archived content of multiple databases can then be made available using a single access system. This approach is exemplified by the [http://deeparc.sourceforge.net/ DeepArc] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20110227202744/http://www.nla.gov.au/xinq/ Xinq] tools developed by the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] and the [[National Library of Australia]] respectively. DeepArc enables the structure of a [[relational database]] to be mapped to an [[XML schema]], and the content exported into an XML document. Xinq then allows that content to be delivered online. Although the original layout and behavior of the website cannot be preserved exactly, Xinq does allow the basic querying and retrieval functionality to be replicated.

===Transactional archiving===
Transactional archiving is an event-driven approach, which collects the actual transactions which take place between a [[web server]] and a [[web browser]]. It is primarily used as a means of preserving evidence of the content which was actually viewed on a particular [[website]], on a given date. This may be particularly important for organizations which need to comply with legal or regulatory requirements for disclosing and retaining information.

A transactional archiving system typically operates by intercepting every [[HTTP]] request to, and response from, the web server, filtering each response to eliminate duplicate content, and permanently storing the responses as bitstreams.

==Difficulties and limitations==

===Crawlers===
Web archives which rely on web crawling as their primary means of collecting the Web are influenced by the difficulties of web crawling:
* The [[robots exclusion protocol]] may request crawlers not access portions of a website.  Some web archivists may ignore the request and crawl those portions anyway.
* Large portions of a web site may be hidden in the [[Deep Web (search indexing)|Deep Web]].  For example, the results page behind a web form can lie in the Deep Web if crawlers cannot follow a link to the results page.
* [[Crawler trap]]s (e.g., calendars) may cause a crawler to download an infinite number of pages, so crawlers are usually configured to limit the number of dynamic pages they crawl.

However, it is important to note that a native format web archive, i.e., a fully browsable web archive, with working links, media, etc., is only really possible using crawler technology.

The Web is so large that crawling a significant portion of it takes a large amount of technical resources.  The Web is changing so fast that portions of a website may change before a crawler has even finished crawling it.

===General limitations===
Some web servers are configured to return different pages to web archiver requests than they would in response to regular browser requests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Are current archiving systems reliable enough?|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00192-015-2805-7|journal = International Urogynecology Journal|date = 2015-07-30|issn = 0937-3462|pages = 1-1|doi = 10.1007/s00192-015-2805-7|first = Parham|last = Habibzadeh}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is typically done to fool search engines into directing more user traffic to a website, and is often done to avoid accountability, or to provide enhanced content only to those browsers that can display it.

Not only must web archivists deal with the technical challenges of web archiving, they must also contend with intellectual property laws.  Peter Lyman&lt;ref&gt;Lyman (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; states that "although the Web is popularly regarded as a [[public domain]] resource, it is [[copyright]]ed; thus, archivists have no legal right to copy the Web". However [[national library|national libraries]] in some countries &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://netpreserve.org/legal-deposit|title=Legal Deposit {{!}} IIPC|website=netpreserve.org|language=en|access-date=2017-01-31|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316103200/http://netpreserve.org/legal-deposit|archivedate=2017-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have a legal right to copy portions of the web under an extension of a [[legal deposit]].

Some private non-profit web archives that are made publicly accessible like [[WebCite]], the [[Internet Archive]] or the [[Internet Memory Foundation]] allow content owners to hide or remove archived content that they do not want the public to have access to. Other web archives are only accessible from certain locations or have regulated usage. WebCite cites  a recent lawsuit against Google's caching, which [[Google]] won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.webcitation.org/faq |title=WebCite FAQ |work=Webcitation.org |author= |date= |accessdate=September 20, 2018}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aspects of web curation==
Web curation, like any digital curation, entails:

* Certification of the trustworthiness and integrity of the collection content
* Collecting verifiable Web assets
* Providing Web asset search and retrieval
* Semantic and ontological continuity and comparability of the collection content

Thus, besides the discussion on methods of collecting the Web, those of providing access, certification, and organizing must be included. There are a set of popular tools that addresses these curation steps:

A suite of tools for Web Curation by [[International Internet Preservation Consortium]]:
* [[Heritrix]] – collecting Web asset
* [[NutchWAX]] – search Web archive collections
* [[Open source Wayback Machine]] – search and navigate Web archive collections using NutchWax
* [[International Internet Preservation Consortium#Web Curator Tool|Web Curator Tool]] – Selection and Management of Web Collection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webcurator.sourceforge.net/manuals.shtml |title=Web Curator Tool |publisher=Webcurator.sourceforge.net |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104051655/http://webcurator.sourceforge.net/manuals.shtml |archivedate=2011-11-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other open source tools for manipulating web archives:
* [[WARC Tools]] – for creating, reading, parsing and manipulating, [[Web ARChive|WARC]] archives programmatically
* Google Search Tools – for indexing and searching full-text and metadata within web archives{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Free but not open source tools also exist:
* [[WARC Software Development Kit]] (WSDK) represents a set of simple, compact, and highly optimized Erlang modules to manipulate (create/read/write) the [[Web ARChive|WARC]] ISO 28500:2009 file format.

'''Wreck Racing''' is a [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] automotive competition team, based in the [[George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering|Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering]].  The team is composed of undergraduate and graduate students from the various schools within GA Tech and is based in the [[Student Competition Center]] on the North edge of Tech's Atlanta campus.  The team's main focus is in the design, fabrication, testing, and racing of production-based sports cars.  Wreck Racing primarily competes in the [[Grassroots Motorsports#Grassroots Motorsports .2420XX Challenge|Grassroots Motorsports Annual Challenge]], but also has competed in local [[SCCA]] and [[BMWCCA]] events.

==History==
The Wreck Racing team was founded by Andrew Sullivan and Andy Powell, both Tech Alumni, and has been an officially chartered student organization since 2005.&lt;ref name="Grassroots Motorsports"&gt;{{cite news|accessdate = 4 May 2011|newspaper = Grassroots Motorsports|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120312083923/http://grassrootsmotorsports.com/articles/extracarricular-activities/|archive-date = 12 March 2012|dead-url = yes|url = http://grassrootsmotorsports.com/articles/extracarricular-activities/|title = Extra-car-ricular Activities}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tech Organization - WR"&gt;{{cite web|title = GA Tech Chartered Organizations - Wreck Racing|url = http://jacketpages.gatech.edu/organizations/view/27932|work = GA Tech Database|accessdate = 13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the team was founded, membership has grown rapidly, and the team currently has approximately 50 active members.

==Competition==

Since 2005 Wreck Racing has competed in twelve annual GRM $20XX events and has competed with six separate vehicles including a 1980s VW GTI, a turbocharged E30 chassis BMW, a V8-powered Mazda Miata, a 2JZ MG Midget, a mid-engine Honda Insight, and a V8 swapped BMW E28. 

$2010 Challenge: In 2010 Wreck Racing won the GRM $2010 Challenge, placing 1st overall, 1st in autocross, and 1st in concours, placing above many veteran teams and entries by several professional race shops.&lt;ref name="GA Tech WR Win"&gt;{{cite web|title = Woodruff School News - Wreck Racing|url = http://www.me.gatech.edu/news/news_grm_challenge.shtml|work = GA Tech ME Website|publisher = GA Tech|accessdate = 4 May 2011|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110929153819/http://www.me.gatech.edu/news/news_grm_challenge.shtml|archivedate = 29 September 2011|dead-url = y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Technique WR Win"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nique.net/focus/2010/11/05/tech-races-to-first-place/|accessdate=4 May 2011|newspaper=The Technique}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

$2017 Challenge: Wreck Racing won 1st place in autocross, 1st place in concours, and 1st place overall in the Grassroot Motorsports $2017 Challenge with their 2001 Honda Insight powered by a mid-mounted Subaru EG33 engine. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Higginbotham |first1=Ed |title=$2017 Challenge: Celebrating the Country’s Top Low-Buck Builders |url=https://grassrootsmotorsports.com/news/who-won-the-grassroots-motorsports-2017-challenge/ |website=Grassroots Motorsports |publisher=Grassroots Motorsports Magazine |accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Another primary focus of Wreck Racing is to fortify scientific design and analysis methods taught in the GA Tech classrooms through practical application.  The team frequently utilizes finite element and signal analysis, circuit design, CAD modeling and drawing, thermodynamic and fluid dynamic analysis, along with advanced fabrication techniques, such as state-of-the-art CNC milling, radiator fin augmentation, waterjet and plasma cutting, lathe operation, welding, and precision measuring with the goal of producing exceptional vehicle performance while remaining within the severe budget and time restrictions mandated by the competition rules.&lt;ref name="GA Tech WR Win" /&gt;

'''Zofia Potocka''' née ''Clavone'' ({{lang-uk|Софія Костянтинівна Потоцька}}; 11 January 1760 – 24 November 1822) was a Greek slave courtesan and a Russian agent, later a Polish noble. She was famous in contemporary Europe for her beauty and adventurous life. During the [[Russo-Turkish War (1787–92)]], she was the lover of the Russian commander prince [[Grigory Potemkin]] and acted as an agent in Russian service.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Simon Sebag Montefiore (2006). Potemkin och Katarina den stora – en kejserliga förbindelse (Potemkin: Catherine the Great's Imperial Partner) (in Swedish). prisma. {{ISBN|9789151844978}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Compatriots of her time wrote: "She was beautiful as a dream, a child of southern countries. All those who have seen her admire her beauty, igniting a fire in the hearts of men and envy in the eyes of women."

==Life==
===Early life===
Potocka was born in 1760 January 1 (January 11, New Style) in the Turkish city of [[Bursa]] to Constantine Clavone, a poor Greek cattle merchant, and Maria Clavone. In 1772, when Zofia was 12 years old, she moved to the Greek district of [[Phanar]] in [[Constantinople]] with her parents and sisters. 

Around 1775, when Zofia was 15 years old, her father Constantine died under mysterious circumstances. Her mother married an Armenian, who also died. During the great fire in Constantinople, their house burned down. In this difficult time for them, her mother Maria sought support from foreign embassies. 

In May 1777, when Zofia was not yet 17 years old, Maria sold her two daughters to the Polish Ambassador, [[Boskamp Lyasopolskomu]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The ambassador was known to procure girls for the Polish king.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Learning about their supposed noble origin and seeing the beauty of the girls, the Ambassador agreed to help. The sister were claimed to descent from the noble aristocratic family Pantalisa Mavrokordato, who stemmed from the royal family of Greece and was related by blood to the rulers of Byzantium. 

Zofia and her sister settled in his palace and was given lessons in French. Reportedly, the ambassador kept her as his mistress for a time, and then prostituted her.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Boskamp-Lyasopolsky arranged for her sister to be sold as a wife to a Turkish Pasha,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; but he promised her mother to arrange marriage for Zofia in Europe. 

The Polish Count Major [[Józef Witt]] learned the purpose of the trip and her ancient lineage. He made an offer, bought her from Boskamp-Lyasopolsky and married her in 1779.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; 
Józef Witt was the son of the commandant of the fortress Kamianetska, and the couple lived a year in [[Kamianets-Podilskyi]], before departing for Europe in 1781.

===Europe===
Zofia reportedly made a sensational success when being introduced to the aristocracy by her spouse in the drawing room receptions of Europe in the palaces of Berlin and Hamburg, Vienna, Rome, Venice and, most famously, in Paris. She was celebrated as "The most beautiful woman in Europe" and known for her expression: "My eyes aches".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
Her beauty and admired ability to improvise herself out of difficult situations resulted in an admiration and love affairs with several of the most powerful personalities of Europe at the time, which attracted a lot of attention. She was regarded as fashionable decoration at every party in high society in the cities they visited and was courted by monarchs and ministers. 
  
At the beginning of their European tour, the couple visited Warsaw. In early March 1781, she was called to court to be introduced to King Stanislas Augustus. After Warsaw, they visited Berlin, where Zofia was introduced to the King of Prussia Frederick II. In the resort town of Spa, Zofia was introduced to the Austrian Emperor Joseph II, who was reportedly so fascinated and impressed by her that he ordered [[Mozart]] to compose music on the Turkish harem theme. 
In one of his letters to his sister, the French queen Marie Antoinette, Joseph II recommended the Witte couple to her. 

Zofia saw [[Marie Antoinette]] at [[Petit Trianon]], which at that time was being rebuilt in a landscaped park. This was possibly what Zofia was inspired to create a similar park. Reportedly, Marie Antoinette was charmed by her and spoke of her as her adopted daughter. During her stay in Paris, Zofia became the lover of both of the French king's brothers; the Count of Provence, later King Louis XVIII, and the Comte d'Artois, the future French king Charles X respectively.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  

On November 17, 1781 Zofia gave birth in Paris to a son. When this news reached the Polish king, she personally visited Kamianets and congratulated her father-in-law Josef Witt with the birth of a grandson, promoted him to the rank of Lieutenant General and volunteered to be the godfather of the newborn. 

===Russia===
In 1782, the couple returned to Kamianets visiting Vienna, Moravia, Slovakia and Galicia on the way. In 1785, her spouse Joseph Witte succeeded his father as commandant of Kamianets-Podilskyi, making Zofia first lady of Podolia. 

During the [[Russo-Turkish War (1787–92)]], she entered a relationship with the Russian Prince Potemkin, the commander of Catherine the Great, which lasted until his death.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; At least during the [[Battle of Khotyn (1788)|Siege of Khotyn]], her spouse managed Potemkin's net of agents in Southern Poland and his spy contacts within Chotin: in practice, however, these contacts were likely managed by, or at least with the assistance of Zofia, whose elder sister was married to the Turkish pasha of Chotin.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Potemkin appointed her spouse governor of [[Kherson|Cherson]], and gave Zofia the informal task of managing the Turkish-Polish relations.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; In 1791, she accompanied Potemkin to Saint Petersburg, where she was introduced to the nobility as his official mistress.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Later life===
In February 1796, Zofia arrived in Uman and announced her divorce from Jozef De Witte. In April 17, 1798, in Tulchin, she remarried [[Stanisław Szczęsny Potocki]], who had divorced his wife in order to marry her. The wedding ceremony was conducted with the participation of the Orthodox priest and Catholic priest in an Orthodox Church. 

During her second marriage, Zofia had three sons; Alexander (born in 1798), Mieczyslaw (born in 1800) and Boleslaw (born in 1805), and two daughters; Sophia, and [[Olga Potocka|Olga]] (1802-1861). During the marriage, she also had an affair with her stepson, [[Szczęsny Jerzy Potocki]], who may have been the biological father of her son Boleslaw.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; She also had an affair with the Russian governor, [[Nikolai Novosiltsov]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Stanisław Szczęsny Potocki indulged in mysticism and came under the influence of Polish "Illuminati" and died in March 15, 1805, without having time to say goodbye to her. 
As a widow, she was by law only entitled to her [[dowry]] and a small portion of the fortune of her late spouse, which would have had a bad effect on her economy as she had brought no dowry to the marriage; however, she managed to inherit almost all of the fortune of her late spouse with the assistance of her stepson and the Russian governor, both of whom were her lovers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; 

As a widow, Zofia reportedly occupied herself with the upbringing of her children and charitable activities. Looking back on her time in Russia, she described Potemkin as a brother.

===Death===
In the early 1820s, she experienced a deteriorated health. Reportedly, the mysticism of the Polish Illuminati was suspected to have affected her health. She left for [[Berlin]] to consult German doctors, where she died. 

She left instructions to be buried Uman. Zofia's embalmed body was clothed in a beautiful dress and placed in a carriage, in one hand a bouquet and in the other a fan. Her body was transported in such a way across the border. In Uman, an elaborate funeral ceremony was conducted out of respect pfor the charity of her last years. When the Zofia's coffin was carried 10 miles along the road, barrels of resin were placed for lighting torches, lighting the way as the procession passed the night before a huge crowd. 

Zofia was buried in the crypt under the Basilian church. In 1877, the body was disturbed as the church was badly damaged by an earthquake. Zofia's remains were reburied in [[Talne]] with those of her youngest daughter Olga, where they still rest in the crypt of the church.

Zofia Potocka died in on 24 November 1822, aged 62.
