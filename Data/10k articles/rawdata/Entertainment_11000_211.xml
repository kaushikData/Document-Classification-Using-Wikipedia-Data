'''''A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies''''' is a [[documentary film]] of 225 minutes in length, presented by [[Martin Scorsese]] and produced by the [[British Film Institute]].

In the film [[Martin Scorsese]] examines a selection of his favorite American films grouped according to four different types of directors: the director as storyteller; the director as an illusionist: [[D.W. Griffith]] or [[F. W. Murnau]], who created new editing techniques among other innovations that made the appearance of sound and color possible later on; the director as a smuggler— filmmakers such as [[Douglas Sirk]], [[Samuel Fuller]], and [[Vincente Minnelli]], who used to hide subversive messages in their films; and the director as an iconoclast, those filmmakers attacking social conventionalism — [[Charles Chaplin]], [[Erich von Stroheim]], [[Orson Welles]], [[Elia Kazan]], [[Nicholas Ray]], [[Stanley Kubrick]], [[Arthur Penn]], and [[Sam Peckinpah]].

The documentary is structured in segments:
*Part I
**The director's dilemma 
**The director as storyteller
***The Western
***The Gangster film
***The Musical
*Part II
**The director as illusionist
**The director as smuggler I
*Part III
**The director as smuggler II
**The director as iconoclast 
It was originally shown in three parts on [[Channel 4]] in the UK in 1995.

'''Al G. Barnes Circus''' was an American circus run by [[Alpheus George Barnes Stonehouse]].

==History==
Stonehouse started his show in 1895 with a pony, a phonograph, and a [[stereopticon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Died |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,846966-2,00.html |quote=Alpheus George Barnes Stonehouse (Al G. Barnes), 68, circusman, founder and longtime owner of Barnes's Circus; after a lingering illness; in [[Indio, California]]. He started his show in 1895 with a pony, a phonograph, a stereopticon. A colorful participant at every performance, he would lead the opening parade seated on the head of a mammoth elephant. Two years ago he sold his interests to Circusman John Ringling for $1,000,000.  |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=August 3, 1931 |accessdate=2008-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1929, the "Al G. Barnes Wild Animal Show" had grown to 5-rings and it was purchased by the [[American Circus Corporation]]. American Circus already owned the [[Sells-Floto Circus]], [[John Robinson Shows]], [[Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus]], and [[Sparks Circus]]. That same year [[John Nicholas Ringling|John Ringling]], the owner of the [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus]], bought out the American Circus Corporation.&lt;ref name=acc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ringling.com/ContentPage.aspx?id=45833&amp;section=45825 |title=Bailey and the Ringlings |accessdate=2013-11-29 |quote=In 1929, reacting to the fact that his competitor, the American Circus Corporation, had signed a contract to perform in New York's Madison Square Garden, Ringling purchased [[American Circus]] for $1.7-million. In one fell swoop, Ringling had absorbed five major shows: [[Sells-Floto]], [[Al G. Barnes]], Sparks, [[Hagenbeck-Wallace]], and John Robinson. |publisher=[[Feld Entertainment]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Man Who Started as a Clown Now Controls the Entire Big Top Industry. |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0E1EFD3454167A93C2A81782D85F4D8285F9 |quote=John Ringling, head of the Ringling Brothers-Barnum Bailey Combined Circus, has purchased the five circuses, with Winter quarters, of the American Circus Corporation, it was learned yesterday. |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 10, 1929 |accessdate=2009-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The five circuses that were part of that acquisition continued to tour under their own names, but were closed one-by-one during the [[Great Depression]].  In 1937 the Al G. Barnes Wild Animal Show and Sells Floto were combined into one circus.  That circus, Al G. Barnes Sells-Floto toured in 1937 and 1938.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.circushistory.org/Routes/BarnesSells1937.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938 the co-owned Ringling Bros and Barnum &amp; Bailey Combined Shows was experiencing labor problems which ultimately led to the circus being closed after performances in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] on June 22.&lt;ref&gt;http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1938/06/27/page/6/article/circus-packs-up-after-strike-to-go-back-to-base&lt;/ref&gt;  After regrouping at the circus winter quarters in [[Sarasota, Florida]] the Ringling-Barnum circus trains were dispatched to [[Redfield, South Dakota]] where the two circuses met and were combined into a yet larger circus featuring many of the major stars from Ringling-Barnum.  The circus toured from July 11 until November 27, 1938 as "Al G. Barnes and Sells-Floto Circus Presenting Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Stupendous New Features''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.circushistory.org/Routes/BarnesSells1937.htm#1938&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Among the attractions that were featured were big game hunter "Bring 'em Back Alive [[Frank Buck (animal collector)|Frank Buck]]" and [[Gargantua (gorilla)]].  When the show finished its season however, rather than returning to its own winter quarters in [[Baldwin Park, California]], the circus trains traveled to the Ringling winter quarters near [[Sarasota, Florida]], never to emerge again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duble|first=Charles E.|title=Passing of Circuses from the American Scene|journal=Bandwagon|date=July 1957|volume=1|issue=2|pages=4|url=http://www.circushistory.org/Bandwagon/bw-1957Jul.htm|accessdate=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bradbury|first=Joseph T.|journal=[[Bandwagon (magazine)|Bandwagon]]|date=Jul–Aug 1963|volume=7|issue=4|pages=3–6|url=http://www.circushistory.org/Bandwagon/bw-1963Jul.htm|title=The Al G.

One of their more famous animals was [[Black Diamond (elephant)|Black Diamond]], an [[Indian elephant]] whose unpredictable temper resulted in the deaths of several people and was shot between 50-100 times in 1929, before his own death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Black Diamond |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,752326,00.html |quote=Curley Pickett has been a farm hand for the last two years in Corsicana, Tex. Before that he was an elephant trainer for the Al. G. Barnes circus where his special charge was Black Diamond, a land elephant. Last week Farm Hand Pickett, learning that the old circus was coming to town, invited his employer, Mrs. Eva Donohue, to see Black Diamond. ... Black Diamond spied them, gave Pickett a malevolent look, wrapped him in his trunk and tossed him over a box car. The nine-ton beast then smashed Mrs. Donohue to the ground, trampled the life out of her. When Pickett had been sent to the hospital, keepers held a council, wired to Circus Owner John Ringling for advice. Mr. Ringling condemned Black Diamond to death. ...|work=[[Time magazine]] |date=October 28, 1929 |accessdate=2009-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performers==
Although the Al G. Barnes Circus featured many traditional acts associated with circuses, it was known for its wild animal acts.  [[Mabel Stark]], the tiger trainer was associated with the circus for many years.&lt;ref&gt;http://mentalfloss.com/article/48808/mabel-stark-lady-tigers&lt;/ref&gt;  Stark joined the circus in 1911, first presenting a horse act.  In 1916 she began presenting tigers in the center ring of the wild animal show.  Although she left the circus in 1922, she returned in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.circusesandsideshows.com/performers/mabelstark.html&lt;/ref&gt; Bert Nelson was another wild animal trainer who appeared on the circus in the late 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=fCgDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=bert+nelson+al+g.+barnes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Il6g3Bv4Ta&amp;sig=v25wkxW33L2GdnTmDdHJaYgKocU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiesMLBxZvMAhVS3WMKHeKhCHAQ6AEIXDAN#v=onepage&amp;q=bert%20nelson%20al%20g.%20barnes&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; For many seasons, the elephants were trained and presented by Frank "Cheerful" Gardner.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.circushistory.org/History/Barnes1922.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://bucklesw.blogspot.com/2005/09/cheerful-gardner-3.html&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Eddie Woenecker]] became the circus' bandmaster in 1913 and stayed with the circus through 1922.  He returned to the circus in 1936 and continued to perform in that capacity through the 1938 season.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=vB4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA69&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;dq=eddie+Woeckener+barnes+circus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8DCuHiwSY8&amp;sig=cHETEtW_xJH4peMDvS4BBaNThsE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjD7MqayZvMAhUEz2MKHcRpD-kQ6AEIKDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=eddie%20Woeckener%20barnes%20circus&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

==Winter Quarters and Barnes City Zoo==
In 1914 the Al G. Barnes Circus began wintering in [[Venice, California]] near the Venice lagoon.  It continued to winter at that location until November 1920 when the circus trains returned for the winter to a new location on Washington Boulevard between Venice and [[Culver City, California]].  The Al G. Barnes Circus was known as a "Wild Animal Show," and in December 1923 the "Barnes Circus Zoo" opened at the corner of Washington Boulevard and McLaughlin Avenue in Culver City. The Zoo cost 79,000 to build and at the time was kept open even when the show was touring.  The area where the winter quarters and zoo were located were incorporated into the short-lived town of [[Barnes City, California]].  The area was eventually annexed into both Culver City in 1925 and [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.westland.net/venicehistory/articles/BarnesCircusZoo.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the annexation of the winter quarters property, Barnes relocated his winter quarters into an unincorporated area in the [[San Gabriel Valley]] in 1927.  The 300 acres were on Valley Boulevard midway between Baldwin Park and El Monte.  From 1927 until 1938 the circus returned to the Baldwin Park quarters, however at two separate locations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.circushistory.org/Bandwagon/bw-1963Jul.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  At the conclusion of the 1932 season the show unloaded about a half mile east of the original location and that is where it remained until 1938 when most of the equipment was transferred to the Ringling winter quarters in Sarasota at the end of the season.

==''King of the Jungle''==
''[[King of the Jungle (1933 film)|King of the Jungle]]'' is a 1933 [[Paramount Pictures]] film that includes animals, performers and scenes from the Al G. Barnes Circus and winter quarters in 1932.  Although the movie is set on the lot of "Corey's Circus," it was actually filmed on location at the first Baldwin Park winter quarters.  Several acts from the circus that season are featured, including Mabel Stark's tiger act.  The tigers are mid-performance at the time that the big top catches fire during the film's climatic moments.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.circushistory.org/Bandwagon/bw-1963Jul.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable Events==
On May 15, 1922, a large circus elephant known as [[Tusko]] escaped from the Al G. Barnes Circus while it was in [[Sedro-Woolley, Washington]]. The elephant demolished fences, knocked over laundry lines and trees, telephone poles, and overturned a [[Model T]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Death Takes Tusko, Big Elephant That Lived Stormy Life |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/474766192.html?dids=474766192:474766192&amp;FMT=CITE&amp;FMTS=CITE:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Jun+11,+1933&amp;author=&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune&amp;desc=DEATH+TAKES+TUSKO,+BIG+ELEPHANT+THAT+LIVED+STORMY+LIFE&amp;pqatl=google |quote=Tusko one of the largest and most publicized elephants In captivity survived hundreds of death threats and other perils brought on by his temperament only ... |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=June 11, 1933 |accessdate=2010-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
A married [[Nigerian]] couple, Joyce and Paul Unanga, living [[Undocumented immigrant|illegally]] in the [[United States]], has been ordered to leave the country by [[Immigration and Customs Enforcement|U.S. immigration]]. They decide that they will leave, but only after Joyce, who is five months pregnant, delivers her baby in the United States to guarantee automatic U.S. citizenship for their child. Thus ignoring the deportation order, the couple goes into hiding. When Paul is caught and deported, leaving Joyce to fend for herself, she struggles on her own to survive. Bureaucracy keeps getting in the way of Joyce achieving her goal and just as she is about to give up hope, she meets Susan, a married freelance writer who offers to help in the form of safe, free accommodation until the baby is born. With the help of her newfound friend, Joyce sets out to make the 'American Dream' come true for her unborn child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paff.org/panafricanfilmfestival/anchor-baby/ |title=Anchor Baby |publisher=[[Pan-African Film Festival]] |accessdate=4 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110215035618/http://www.paff.org/panafricanfilmfestival/anchor-baby/ |archivedate=15 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tribune.com.ng/index.php/weekend-starter/8976-pregnant-star-actress-omoni-oboli-ordered-out-of-us-struggles-to-gain-citizenship-for-her-unborn-child |title=Pregnant star actress, Omoni Oboli, ordered out of US •Struggles to gain citizenship for her unborn child |last=Idowu |first=Ayo |date=30 July 2010 |work=[[Nigerian Tribune]] |accessdate=10 March 2011 |location=Lagos, Nigeria |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724143233/http://www.tribune.com.ng/index.php/weekend-starter/8976-pregnant-star-actress-omoni-oboli-ordered-out-of-us-struggles-to-gain-citizenship-for-her-unborn-child |archivedate=24 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and career==
===1956-1980s: Early life===
Archibald William Roach was born on 8 January 1956 in [[Mooroopna, Victoria]]. Mooroopna is named after an [[Indigenous Australian|Aboriginal]] word referring to a bend in the [[Goulburn River (Victoria)|Goulburn River]], near [[Shepparton, Victoria|Shepparton]] in central Victoria.&lt;ref name="DoB"/&gt; According to Roach, "My name is Archie Roach and I represent 'Nature's gifts' because my song "Took the Children Away" won a human rights award. My lyrics draw attention to, the hardship and humiliation suffered by many Indigenous Australians."&lt;ref name="DoB"/&gt; In 1956, Roach's family, along with the rest of the area's Indigenous population, were re-housed on Rumbalara [[Mission (Christian)|mission]].

At the age of 4, Roach and his sisters, along with the other Indigenous Australian children of the [[stolen generations]], were forcibly removed from their family by Australian government agencies and placed in an [[orphanage]].&lt;ref name="Portrait"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.portrait.gov.au/portraits/2010.90/archie-roach|title=Archie Roach, 1992 (printed 2010)|publisher=portrait|date=2010|accessdate=28 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After two unpleasant placements in [[foster care]], Roach was eventually [[Foster care|fostered]] by Alex and Dulcie Cox, a family of Scottish immigrants in [[Melbourne, Victoria|Melbourne]].&lt;ref name="ABC2018"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-07-12/archie-roach-a-life-in-song/9957168|title=From stolen child to Indigenous leader: Archie Roach sings the songs that signpost his life |publisher=ABC|date= 12 July 2018|accessdate=28 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alex Cox would sing traditional ballads and introduced Roach to guitar and keyboards. Roach said "He was a big influence on me — a good influence. I'll love him to the day I die."&lt;ref name="ABC2018"/&gt;

At the age of fifteen, Roach was contacted by his natural sister, who told him their birth mother had just died. He spent the next fourteen years on the streets, battling alcoholism. Roach met his future wife, [[Ruby Hunter]], at a Salvation Army drop-in centre when she was sixteen.&lt;ref name="Portrait"/&gt; 

===1989-2000 : ''Charcoal Lane'', ''Jamu Dreaming'' and ''Looking for Butter Boy''===
{{main|Charcoal Lane|Jamu Dreaming|Looking for Butter Boy}}
In the late 1980s, Roach and Hunter formed a band, the Altogethers, with several other Indigenous Australians and moved to Melbourne. Roach wrote his first song, "[[Took the Children Away]]", which he performed on a community radio station in Melbourne and on an Indigenous current affairs program in 1988. Australian musician [[Paul Kelly (Australian musician)|Paul Kelly]] invited Roach to open his concert early in 1989, where he performed "Took the Children Away", a song telling the story of the Stolen Generations and his own experience of being forcibly removed from his family.&lt;ref name="Apra2017"/&gt; His performance was met with stunned silence, followed by shattering applause.&lt;ref name="Portrait"/&gt; 

In 1990, with the encouragement of Kelly, Roach recorded his debut solo album, ''[[Charcoal Lane]]'', which was released in May 1990. The album was certified gold and awarded two [[ARIA Awards]] at the 1991 ceremony. The album included "Took the Children Away" which became one of the most important songs in Australia's contemporary history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ruminating.org/culture/archie-roachs-song-took-the-children-away/|title= Archie Roach’s song: ‘Took the Children Away’|publisher=Rumington|date=July 2014|accessdate=28 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, it won an international Human Rights Achievement Award and featured in the top 50 albums for 1992 by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name="Portrait"/&gt;

In 1995, Roach toured extensively throughout the US, Canada, the UK and Europe. He returned to Australia to record the title track for ATSIC's Native Title CD, ''Our Home, Our Land'', with Tiddas, Kev Carmody, Bart Willoughby, Shane Howard and Bunna Laurie. In 1996, Roach performed as part of a presentation to the Human Rights Commission's Inquiry into the Stolen Generations, before embarking on a national tour as a guest of [[Tracy Chapman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.deadlyvibe.com.au/2007/11/archie-roach/|title=Archie Roach Deadly|publisher=Deadly|date=November 2007|accessdate=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1997, Roach released his third studio album, ''[[Looking for Butter Boy]]'', which was recorded on his traditional land at Port Fairy in south-western Victoria.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt; The album's lead single, "[[Hold On Tight (Archie Roach song)|Hold On Tight]]", won the [[ARIA Award for Best Indigenous Release]] in 1997 and the album won the same award at the 1998 award ceremony.

'''Beat 'em up''' (also known as '''brawler''') is a [[Video game genres|video game genre]] featuring [[hand-to-hand combat]] between the protagonist and an improbably large number of opponents. Traditional beat 'em ups take place in [[Side-scrolling video game|scrolling]], [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional]] (2D) levels, though some later games feature more open [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] (3D) environments with yet larger numbers of enemies. These games are noted for their simple [[gameplay]], a source of both critical acclaim and derision. Two-player [[cooperative gameplay]] and multiple [[player character]]s are also hallmarks of the genre. Most of these games take place in urban settings and feature crime-fighting and revenge-based plots, though some games may employ historical, science fiction or fantasy themes.

The first beat 'em up was 1984's ''[[Kung-Fu Master (video game)|Kung-Fu Master]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=FdMnDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT51&amp;dq=beat+em+up+kung+fu+master&amp;hl=zh-TW&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi96Nb2od7YAhWGl5QKHS5QAmAQ6AEITTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=beat+em+up+kung+fu+master&amp;f=false|title=The A-Z of Atari 2600 Games: Volume 1|first=Kieren|last=Hawken|date=16 February 2017|publisher=Andrews UK Limited|accessdate=2 March 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/first-side-scrolling-beat-em-up|title=First side-scrolling beat-em-up|publisher=Guinness World Records|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 1986's ''[[Renegade (video game)|Renegade]]'' introducing the urban settings and underworld revenge themes employed extensively by later games. The genre then saw a period of high popularity between the release of ''[[Double Dragon]]'' in 1987, which defined the two-player cooperative mode central to classic beat 'em ups, and 1991's ''[[Street Fighter II]]'', which drew gamers towards one-on-one [[fighting game]]s. Games such as ''[[Streets of Rage]]'', ''[[Final Fight (video game)|Final Fight]]'', ''[[Golden Axe (video game)|Golden Axe]]'' and ''[[Battletoads]]'' are other classics to emerge from this period. The genre has been less popular since the emergence of 3D-based mass-market games, but still some beat 'em ups adapted the simple formula to utilize large-scale 3D environments.

Beat 'em ups are related to—but distinct from—fighting games, which are based around one-on-one matches rather than scrolling levels and multiple enemies.&lt;ref name="tao1" /&gt; Such terminology is loosely applied, however,&lt;ref name="tao1" /&gt; as some commentators prefer to conflate the two terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/e3-feature-fighting-games-focus/|author=Anon.|title=E3 Feature: Fighting Games Focus|work=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=May 3, 2006|accessdate=2015-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; At times, both one-on-one fighting games and scrolling beat 'em ups have influenced each other in terms of graphics and style and can appeal to fans of either genre.&lt;ref name="tao1" /&gt; Occasionally, a game will feature both kinds of gameplay.&lt;ref&gt;Wales, Matt, [http://wii.ign.com/articles/884/884590p2.html Super Smash Bros.

== Game design ==

Beat 'em up games usually employ vigilante crime fighting and revenge plots with the action taking place on city streets,&lt;ref name="tao2" /&gt; though historical and fantasy themed games also exist.&lt;ref name="dynasty1up" /&gt;&lt;ref name="goldenaxe" /&gt; Players must walk from one end of the game world to the other,&lt;ref name="gamespyhof" /&gt; and thus each game level will usually scroll horizontally.&lt;ref name="finalfight" /&gt; Some later beat 'em ups dispense with [[2D computer graphics|2D]]-based scrolling levels, instead allowing the player to roam around larger [[3D computer graphics|3D]] environments, though they retain the same simple gameplay and control systems.&lt;ref name="fightingforce" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dynasty2" /&gt; Throughout the level, players may acquire weapons that they can use as well as [[power-up]]s that replenish the player's [[Health (gaming)|health]].&lt;ref name="finalfight" /&gt;

As players walk through the level, they are stopped by groups of enemies who must be defeated before they're able to continue.&lt;ref&gt;Nguyen, Thierry, [http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3173076&amp;p=37 Watchmen: The End is Nigh (PS3)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324230315/http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3173076 |date=2009-03-24 }}, ''1UP'', Mar 4, 2009, Mar 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The level ends when all the enemies are defeated.

== History ==
=== Origin ===
The first game to feature fist fighting was [[Sega]]'s boxing game ''[[Heavyweight Champ (1976 arcade game)|Heavyweight Champ]]'' (1976),&lt;ref name="tao1" /&gt; which is viewed from a side-view perspective like later fighting games.&lt;ref&gt;Nadia Oxford, [http://www.1up.com/features/20-years-street-fighter 20 Years of Street Fighter], [[1UP.com]], 12/11/2007&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was [[Data East]]'s fighting game ''[[Karate Champ]]'' (1984) which popularized martial arts themed games.&lt;ref name="tao1"&gt;Spencer, Spanner, [http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/the-tao-of-beat-em-ups-article?page=2 The Tao of Beat-'em-ups], ''Eurogamer'', Feb 6, 2008, Accessed Mar 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, [[Irem]]'s [[Hong Kong action cinema|Hong Kong cinema]]-inspired ''[[Kung-Fu Master (video game)|Kung-Fu Master]]'' (known as ''[[Wheels on Meals|Spartan X]]'' in Japan) laid the foundations for [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] beat 'em ups with its simple gameplay and multiple enemies.&lt;ref name="tao1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CGW"&gt;Kunkel, Bill; Worley, Joyce; Katz, Arnie, "The Furious Fists of Sega!", ''Computer Gaming World'', Oct 1988, pp. 48-49&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1984, ''[[Bruce Lee (video game)|Bruce Lee]]'' combined multi-player, multi-character combat with traditional collecting, platform and puzzle gameplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=May 1985|title=''Bruce Lee'' review |journal=CRASH |volume= |issue=16 |pages= |id= |url=http://www.crashonline.org.uk/16/brucelee.htm |accessdate= 2007-09-26 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Edgely |first=Clare |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=May 1985 |title=Spectrum Software Scene 2 |journal=Sinclair User |volume= |issue=38 |pages= |id= |url=http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/038/sftwreb.htm |accessdate=2007-09-26 |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105181811/http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/038/sftwreb.htm |archivedate=2007-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, ''[[Karateka (video game)|Karateka]]'' combined the one-on-one fight sequences of ''Karate Champ'' with the freedom of movement in ''Kung-Fu Master'', and it successfully experimented with adding plot to its fighting action. It was also among the first beat 'em ups to be successfully [[Porting|ported]] to home systems.&lt;ref name="tao1" /&gt; ''[[Renegade (video game)|Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun]]'', released in 1986 in Japan, deviated from the martial arts themes of earlier games and introduced street brawling to the genre.

In 1987, the release of ''[[Double Dragon]]'' ushered in a "Golden Age" for the beat 'em up genre that lasted nearly five years. The game was designed as [[Technōs Japan]]'s spiritual successor to ''Renegade'',&lt;ref name="tao2" /&gt; but it took the genre to new heights with its detailed set of martial arts attacks and its outstanding two-player [[cooperative gameplay]].&lt;ref name="tao2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ddhof"&gt;Cassidy, William, [http://www.gamespy.com/articles/488/488826p1.html Hall of Fame: Double Dragon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090818045122/http://www.gamespy.com/articles/488/488826p1.html |date=2009-08-18 }}, ''Gamespy'', Jan 5, 2003, Accessed, March 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; ''Double Dragon'''s success resulted in a flood of beat 'em ups that came in the late 1980s,&lt;ref name="ddhof" /&gt; where acclaimed titles such as ''[[Golden Axe (video game)|Golden Axe]]'' and ''[[Final Fight (video game)|Final Fight]]'' (both 1989) distinguished themselves from the others.&lt;ref name="tao2" /&gt; ''Final Fight'' was [[Capcom|Capcom's]] intended sequel to ''[[Street Fighter]]'' (provisionally titled ''Street Fighter '89''),&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080701021834/http://www.snk-capcom.com/didyouknow/archives/00000001.htm Did You Know?

A '''Bioscope''' show was a [[music hall]] and [[funfair|fairground]] attraction consisting of a travelling [[Movie theater|cinema]]. The heyday of the Bioscope was from the late 1890s until [[World War I]].

Bioscope shows were fronted by the largest [[fairground organ]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.steamfairground.co.uk/l3_bioscope.html "Hollycombe Steam Museum bioscope show"]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and these formed the entire public face of the show. A stage was usually in front of the organ, and dancing girls would entertain the crowds between film shows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairground-heritage.org.uk/newsite/research/research-bioscopes.html "Fairground Heritage Trust"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703073622/http://www.fairground-heritage.org.uk/newsite/research/research-bioscopes.html |date=July 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Films shown in the Bioscope were primitive, and the earliest of these were made by the showmen themselves. Later, films were commercially produced.

Bioscope shows were integrated, in Britain at least, into the Variety shows in the huge Music Halls which were built at the end of the nineteenth century.

After the Music Hall Strike of 1907 in London, bioscope operators set up a trade union to represent them. There were about seventy operators in London at this point.

==Modern use==
In South Africa "Bioscope" or in [[Afrikaans]] "bioskoop" is an archaic word for the cinema and some people (especially older generations) still use it regularly.

In modern day Dutch, "bioscoop" is a wide-spread term, and the equivalent of the English "movie theater" or "cinema".

'''Boom Chicago''' is a creative group, based in [[Amsterdam]], The [[Netherlands]], that writes and performs sketch and [[improvisational comedy]] at the Rozentheater.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-03-07/improv-theater-boom-chicago-thrives-in-amsterdam ''Improv Theater Boom Chicago Thrives in Amsterdam''] March 07, 2013 [[BusinessWeek]]&lt;/ref&gt; They were the creative forces behind [[Comedy Central News]] (CCN), a news show on the Dutch [[Comedy Central]] for two seasons.

The group was founded in 1993 by Andrew Moskos, Pep Rosenfeld and Ken Schaefle, who named it after their hometown. They moved to the Lijnbaansgracht in what is now the Sugar Factory a year later.  In 1998, they took over and restored the Leidseplein Theater. In 2012, the comedy show moved to their more spacious home on the Rozengracht, while the Chicago Social Club remains at the Leidseplein.

Boom Chicago addresses Dutch, American and world social and political issues like privacy, the role of technology, [[Europe]], the [[extreme right]], [[Pim Fortuyn]], [[9/11]], social media and the gig economy. Their unique mixing of comedy styles combined with technology has been popular with audiences and critics alike. After twenty-five years, the show has become a part of Amsterdam's cultural scene.

The group is currently owned by Moskos, Rosenfeld and Saskia Maas.

==History==

1993: Andrew Moskos, Pep Rosenfeld and Ken Schaefle open Boom Chicago at the Iboya, Korte Leidsedwarsstraat 41, 85 seats.

1994: Moves to Studio 100 (now the Sugar Factory) on Lijnbaansgracht 238, 180 seats.

1997: Moves into the 270 seat Leidseplein Theater, the theater where Dutch legends Wim Kan, [[Wim Sonneveld]] and [[Toon Hermans]] began in the 1930s.  Boom Chicago renovates the theater, adds a kitchen, bar, and rock show sound and lighting.

2000: Hires first video director, Jamie Wright, and introduces multimedia to the shows.  Cameras are fitted in the theater (and the Leidseplein outside).  Soon green screen studios and live internet, make Boom Chicago an early pioneer with technology in a comedy show.

2002: Comedy Swap with The Second City in Chicago. The mainstage casts of The Second City and Boom Chicago perform on each other's stages in each other's cities. This was the first (and only) time a visiting comedy group plays on Second City's mainstage. All shows sell out. Key meets Peele.

2004:  Boom Chicago Video Productions launches after the worldwide success of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060626212007/http://www.boomchicago.nl/Section/Videos/BoomChicagoVotingMachine Florida Voting Machine Video], where an American citizen tries to vote for [[John Kerry|Kerry]], but the rigged machine only allows him to vote for George Bush.

2006:  ''Me, MySpace and iPod'' opens to best reviews to date.  Merijn Henfling, ''Het Parool'': "Genius... We are once again grateful that [Boom Chicago] decided to make Amsterdam their home."  Peter de Bie and Francisco van Jole, TROS radio: "People are saying this is the best Boom Chicago show ever, and we would agree."  Henk van Gelder, ''NRC Handelsblad'': "Sharp and interactive. They have created an entirely new form of theater; call it digital comedy."

First internet and mobile shows ''Full Frontal News'' ([[Greg Shapiro]] and Becky Nelson) and ''Slacker Fantasy Football ''(Michael Orton-Toliver, Brian Jack, Matt Chapman).  ''The Unlikely Fan'' (Brendan Hunt, Matt Chapman), a daily [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] video series was featured on MSN.

2007:  ''Comedy Central News'', begins as a daily show on Comedy Central Netherlands and runs for 75 episodes.  ''Highly Dubious News'' is nominated for a mobile content award at MIPCOM, the television conference in Cannes. The Chinese Ambassador to the Netherlands asked Boom Chicago to remove their viral video "SpongeBob SquarePants in China", which goes on to receive more than 22 million views on [[YouTube]], making it the number one most viewed film and animation video on the video site worldwide (as of April, 2009). By 2011, the video has been viewed more than 85 million times. It is still the number one Dutch comedy video of all time.
 
2008:  15 year anniversary, April 24.  ''CCN'' returns as a weekly show in April on Comedy Central (NL). ''Bye-Bye Bush'' celebrates the end of an era.

2009:  ''Yankee Come Back'' opens the City of Amsterdam's 400 Year celebration of the Dutch settlement of New York. In the autumn, to coincide with New York's celebration the group performs ''Holland Globetrotters'' at the New Island Festival, a coproduction of ''de Parade'', ''Oerol'' and the Netherlands Theater Institute.

2010:  Longtime fan of Boom Chicago, Maurice de Hond, makes his on stage comedy debut in ''Political Party.'' With Pep Rosenfeld, Greg Shapiro and director Andrew Moskos they create a show that combines politics, political discussion and A-list politicians who also perform in comedy scenes.

2011:  The Leidseplein Theater becomes the Chicago Social Club.  Together with club innovator Casper Reinders (Jimmy Woo) and Pieter de Koning and Joris Bakker (Bitterzoet), the venue undergoes a thorough upgrade and increases its club programming. ''9/11 Forever'' is the only political comedy show in the world to address the ten-year anniversary of the September 11 attacks.

2012: Pep Rosenfeld speaks at TEDx Amsterdam: "Fight, Flight or Be Funny" and hosts TEDx Binnenhof where he makes fun of Prince Willem-Alexander and Princess Maxima while they are just meters away. Saskia Maas speaks at TEDx Education. With prominent roles at TED events, NEXT and Picnic, Boom Chicago has become a major player at technology, ideas and business conferences.

2013:  Boom Chicago moves from their longtime home on the Leidseplein to the (nicer) Rozentheater, where they celebrate 20 years in Amsterdam with "The 7 Deadly Dutch Sins." The Chicago Social Club continues at the Leidseplein as one of Amsterdam's best club venues.

2013:  Nightmare on the Rozengracht runs during October, a 30-minute walk-through haunted house and pop up bar for adults. The show "Delete Zwarte Piet Niet" predicts the uproar and race controversy which would peak this year and proposes the way forward.

2014:  To promote ''What's Up With Those Beards?'', Boom Chicago attempts to break the Guinness Book of World Records for most beards in one room which comes very close. They only break the Dutch record.

2016:  For the first ever Dutch Correspondents' Dinner, Boom Chicago's Andrew Moskos and Wilko Terwijn help write the comedy speech for Prime Minister Rutte -- and coach him to deliver it well.

The political years continues with ''Angry White Men: Trump Up the Volume'' capturing and skewering the most exciting US election in a generation.

2017: Becoming just ''Trump Up the Volume,'' the show becomes one of the longest running shows at Boom Chicago. Boom Chicago renovates their second theater and launches The Upstairs Theater. ''Sunday Night Live'' take residency there and marks the return of long form improv to Boom Chicago. Pep Rosenfeld, Greg Shapiro, and director Andrew Moskos present ''The Year in Search,'' a video in partnership with Google.

2018: ''Escape Through the Movies,'' Boom Chicago's groundbreaking escape room opens at the Rozentheater. The 25th anniversary show Bango! opens in May, starring Tamar Broadbent, Karel Ebergen, Simon Lukacs, Rhys Collier, Cene Hale, Emil Struijker-Boudier, Sacha Hoedemaker and directed by Andrew Moskos. The 25th anniversary year peaks on July 14 with two shows at Carre.

[[File:Burg transmitter 210 Meter Mast.JPG|thumb|Burg transmitter 210 meter mast]]
The '''AM transmitter''' in [[Burg bei Magdeburg|Burg]], near [[Magdeburg]], [[Germany]], is a huge facility for [[longwave]] and [[mediumwave]] [[broadcasting]]. Its most dominant constructions are a 324-metre guyed radio mast and two 210 metre guyed steel tube masts.

The 324 metre high mast is a grounded construction with triangular cross section. Until the early 1990s it had a highly effective fading-reducing transmitting antenna in the form of a special cage aerial developed in Russia, known as the ARRT-antenna. It was used for the 1000&amp;nbsp;kW-medium wave transmitter operated on 783&amp;nbsp;kHz, which was the strongest transmitter of the former GDR, as transmitting antenna. Today this mast has a [[cage aerial]] for long wave. Both the 210 metre high tube masts are isolated from the ground. One of the two tube masts can be used as a toe-fed mast antenna for long and medium wave, while the other mast can be used only as a transmitting antenna for the medium-wave band.

As further antenna systems there are still three step-radiating antennas, each of which is supported by two free standing steel framework towers and which served as transmitting antenna for a medium-wave transmitter on the frequency 1575&amp;nbsp;kHz (shut down at present) and a triangle plane aerial for medium wave.

From 1967 to 1976 there was also another 350 metre high radio mast for long wave, the steel tube lattice mast SL3, which was used for transmitting the program of [[Radio Wolga]]. In order not to affect the radiation field of the other masts, this radio mast was placed at a distance of 2.2 kilometres from the other masts near the road from Burg to [[Grabow]], in the neighbourhood of Gütter, part of Burg. It collapsed on February 18, 1976, because of a defective bolt and was not rebuilt. As a replacement, one of the two 210 metre high steel tube masts was converted in such a way that it could also broadcast the program of Radio Wolga (and later also of [[Radioropa Info]]) in the long-wave range. There are still some remains of the basements of the radio mast SL3 today.

In the 1960s some propaganda transmitters, as German military transmitters, were operated on the site of the AM transmitter Burg.

After its fiftieth issue (July 2009), the series was renumbered to match the numbering of all the volumes of the title (454, 13, 50, 32, and 50), and volume 1 resumed publication with issue #600 with Brubaker remaining as writer.

The series was best known for reviving Captain America's [[World War II]] partner [[Bucky Barnes]] as the Winter Soldier in issue #6, the presumed death of Steve Rogers in issue #25, and Bucky taking over the mantle of Captain America in issue #34.

'''Catch a Rising Star''' is a chain of [[comedy clubs]], founded in [[New York City]] in December 1972 and owned by [[Rick Newman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://theinterrobang.com/rick-newman-magic-catch-rising-star/ |title=Rick Newman and the Magic of Catch A Rising Star |date=2014-11-30 |website=The Interrobang |access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since spread to other areas, such as [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] and [[New Jersey]]. Currently owned by Suzy Yengo Esq.

The original club in New York City was notable for its role in starting the careers of many famous singers and [[comedian]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Comedy at the Edge: How Stand-up in the 1970s Changed America |last=Zoglin |first=Richard |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |year=2009 |isbn=9781582346250 |pages=95-96}}&lt;/ref&gt; many of whom enjoyed later success in [[television]], [[theater]] and [[film]].

In the late 1990s, the club was located on West 28th Street between 7th and 8th Avenues. The chain is currently negotiating to build a new club in the New York area.

Other locations throughout the US are located in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], New Jersey, [[Reno]], Las Vegas, [[Twin River Casino]], Rhode Island and the new Catch A Rising Star on Broadway in New York.{{fact|date=November 2017}}

'''Charles Ellsworth Grapewin''' (December 20, 1869 – February 2, 1956) was an American [[vaudeville]] performer, circus performer, writer and a [[theatre|stage]] and [[silent film|silent]] and [[sound film|sound]] [[actor]], and comedian who was best known for portraying [[Uncle Henry (Oz)|Uncle Henry]] in [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]'s ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939) as well as Grandpa Joad in ''[[The Grapes of Wrath (film)|The Grapes of Wrath]]'' (1940) and Jeeter Lester in  ''[[Tobacco Road (film)|Tobacco Road]]'' (1941).&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; He usually portrayed elderly folksy-type characters in a rustic setting, in all appearing in over 100 films. He was the oldest cast member of The Wizard of Oz.

==Biography==
Born in [[Xenia, Ohio]], Charles Ellsworth Grapewin ran away from home to be a circus acrobat which led him to work as an aerialist and [[trapeze]] artist in a traveling [[circus]] before turning to acting. He traveled all over the world with the famous [[P. T. Barnum]] circus.  Grapewin also appeared in the original 1903 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of ''The Wizard of Oz'', 36 years before he would appear in the famous Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film version.

After this he continued in theatre, on and offstage, for the next thirty years, starting with various stock companies, and wrote stage plays as a vehicle for himself. His sole Broadway theatre credit was the short-lived play ''It's Up to You John Henry'' in 1905.

Grapewin married actress [[Anna Chance]] (1875–1943) in 1896, and they remained a devoted couple until her death some 47 years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Mrs. Charles Grapewin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1943/09/12/archives/mrs-charles-grapewin.html |quote=Mrs. Anna Chance Grapewin, wife of the character actor, Charles Grapewin, died yesterday in the ... |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 12, 1943 |accessdate=2007-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years after his first wife's death, Grapewin married Loretta McGowan Becker on Jan 10, 1945.&lt;ref&gt;"Charles Grapewin Weds Divorcee," The Philadelphia Inquirer, 11 Jan 1945, page 9, http://fultonhistory.com:8089/highlighter/doc/a08daca9734926a635deb35b3cbed923.pdf#page=1{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grapewin began in [[silent film]]s at the turn of the twentieth century. His very first films were two "moving image shorts" made by Frederick S. Armitage and released in November 1900; ''Chimmie Hicks at the Races'' (also known as ''[[Above the Limit]]'') and ''Chimmie Hicks and the Rum Omelet'', both shot in September and October 1900 and released in November of that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citwf.com/film61633.htm Complete Index to World Film], ''Chimmie Hicks at the Races'', accessed 02-19-2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sinema.com/film/85843/chimmie-hicks-and-the-rum-omelet sinema.com (Turkish)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716074222/http://www.sinema.com/film/85843/chimmie-hicks-and-the-rum-omelet |date=2011-07-16 }}, ''Chimmie Hicks and the Rum Omelet'', accessed 02-19-2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mic.loc.gov/public_portal/public_collectionsdetails.php?search=varsmp&amp;recnum=18&amp;maxrecnum=63&amp;fields=&amp;portal= Chimmie Hicks at the Races]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} [[Library of Congress]] Moving Image Collection, "Chimmie Hicks at the races / American Mutoscope and Biograph Company", accessed 02-19-2009&lt;/ref&gt;  During his long career, Grapewin appeared in more than one hundred films, including ''[[The Good Earth (film)|The Good Earth]]'', ''[[The Grapes of Wrath (film)|The Grapes of Wrath]]'', ''[[Tobacco Road (film)|Tobacco Road]]'', and in what is probably his best-remembered role: Uncle Henry in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''.  He also had a recurring role as Inspector Queen in the [[Ellery Queen#Films|Ellery Queen]] film series of the early 1940s.

Grapewin died of natural causes in [[Corona, California]] at age 86, and his ashes are interred with his wife's in [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale|Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Glendale, California]], at the Great Mausoleum's Columbarium of Inspiration.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |quote=Charles Grapewin, who acted the roles of Jeeter Lester in ''Tobacco Road'' and of Grampa in ''Grapes of Wrath'' in the movies, died today at his home in Corona.

'''Circus Herman Renz''' is the largest circus in the [[Netherlands]], and has been touring the [[Netherlands]] and other countries since 1911.

==History==
[[File:Arnoldus Nicolaas van der Vegt.png|thumb|{{ill|Arnold van der Vegt|nl}} in 1930]]
{{ill|Arnold van der Vegt|nl}} decided in the winter of 1911 to start his own [[circus]]. The first artist he contracted was his friend [[Tom Mix]]. In 1923 Arnold changed the name of the circus to "Renz". During [[World War II]]  it was difficult for the circus to survive, and because of the circumstances it was forced to give shows for [[Nazi Germany]]. After the war, the circus returned to normal shows. Arnold van der Vegt died in 1955. (Arnold van der Vegt is not related to Ernst Jacob Renz, Berlin 1842 or Renz International).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecircusdiaries.com/2013/10/06/smile-by-circus-renz-international/|title=‘Smile’, by Circus Renz International|date=6 October 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=trouw&gt;{{cite web | title= Circus Renz| work= Circus Renz, by GEORGE MARLET, 08/12/98 | publisher=Trouw | url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/5009/Archief/article/detail/2727047/1998/12/08/Circus-Renz-draagt-zijn-naam-terecht.dhtml | accessdate=2016-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Graf Arnold van der Vecht.jpg|thumb|Arnold van der Vecht family memorial]]
After the death of Arnold van der Vegt, his son Herman Sr. took over management of the circus. In 1970 he transferred the running of the circus to his sons, Paul and Arnold Jr. (also known as Nol). Paul acted as a clown in the shows and Arnold Jr. became the director.&lt;ref name=trouw/&gt;

Arnold Jr. and his wife Marina made the circus successful. For many years they traveled around with success. In 1967 their son Herman Jr. was born. As a child, Herman's ambition was to continue his fathers circus business.&lt;ref name=trouw/&gt;

The success of circus Renz reached its peak in 1978 when [[Bassie and Adriaan]] made several television series with Circus Renz as the backdrop. In the weekends, they made their appearance in the circus with clown performances. During this period the shows were regularly sold out.&lt;ref name=trouw/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kerstcircushermanrenz.nl/|title=Kerstcircus Haarlem – 22 dec. 2017 – 7 jan. 2018 // Burg. Reinaldapark, Haarlem|website=www.kerstcircushermanrenz.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bassie and Adriaan==
In 1980 the Dutch TV-producer [[Joop van den Ende]] established [[Circus Bassie &amp; Adriaan]]. The staff of Circus Renz was involved with the entire transport of [[Circus Bassie &amp; Adriaan]]. Circus Renz itself traveled throughout the country. At the end of 1983 Joop van den Ende ended his work with the circus, after he did a show with the Dutch singer [[André Hazes]].

At Circus Renz, the Steijvers family started a new act, followed by the new act of the Luycx-Sisters in 1983. Herman Jr. fell in love with Diana Luycx and they started a relationship.

Arnold Jr. again worked with [[Bassie and Adriaan]] in 1985. The cooperation between them was renewed and the circus Renz grew. But, in 1988, Arnold Jr. became very ill. His last wish was to travel once more with [[Bassie and Adriaan]] and a complete new circus-tent. The new tent was bought, but in January 1989 Arnold van der Vegt Jr. died of [[cancer]]. Because the new tour was already planned, [[Bassie and Adriaan]] finished the tour after which, in 1989, the tent was sold.

==The new circus Renz==
[[Image:Circus renz.jpg|thumb|1991 - Circus Herman Renz]]

In 1990 Herman Jr., and his girlfriend Diana, perform for one season with the French [[circus Achille Zavatta II]]. Despite this, Herman wanted to continue the Circus Renz with Diana, and the families of Steijvers and Ronday.

In September 1990 [[Diana &amp; Herman Renz]] ended a contract with the Circus Achille Zavatta II. On March the 13th 1991 they open with the renewed 'Dutch National Circus Herman Renz'. The first show on the tour was in [[Eemnes]]. For the young board of directors it is a big venture, but thanks to a contract with [[Center Parcs]] it turned into a large success.

In five years time, the now-married Diana &amp; Herman Renz develop the circus into the largest in the Netherlands and later the Benelux. The circus always wintered the show in the Dutch city of [[Haarlem]]. In December 1995 Diana &amp; Herman Renz received the [[Oscar Carré Trophy]]. The trophy is awarded by the Swiss circus director Frédy Knie of [[Circus Knie]].

The tour of 1996 started at February 22 in the Dutch city of [[Hilversum]].  A new tent has ordered and there was a new contract with [[Center Parcs]] for the show.&lt;ref name=trouw/&gt;

==Show on hold==
March 13, 1996. On Centerparc 'Het Vennenbos', the circus had arrived in the Dutch city of Hapert for a show. Herman &amp; Diana had not shown been seen yet that day. Worried manager Robert Ronday, looking for them and found Herman &amp; Diana dead. It was later determined that Diana &amp; Herman died because of carbon monoxide poisoning. The shows and the tour were temporarily cancelled. Some days later, the Circus is relocated to the Dutch city of [[Haarlem]], where the funeral took take place. After the funeral ceremony, the funeral proceeded to [[Amsterdam]], where Diana &amp; Herman were buried at the cemetery '[[Zorgvlied (cemetery)|Zorgvlied]]'.&lt;ref name=trouw/&gt;

==New show==
[[Image:Tvshow ivo niehe en ronald blom.jpg|left|thumb|1996 - nine-year-old Ronald Blom at the 'TV-Show of [[Ivo Niehe]]']]

A week after the burial the Herman's mother announces that she wants to sell the circus for 800,000 Dutch [[guilders]]. Many want to save the circus. Nine years old Ronald Blom generated a lot of publicity. Ronald was seen on television shows such as the '{{ill|TV-Show of Ivo Niehe|nl|TV Show}}', '{{ill|Hart van Nederland|nl}}' and 'Het [[Jeugdjournaal]]' (the news for youth). There is even a story in the local newspaper of Haarlem ('Haarlems Dagblad'). Ronald also collects money (in total 1,012 guilders).  Ed Glas organized actions to save the circus also, together with the interim executive board of the circus, Toin Routers (public relations officer of the circus in 2005) and Hans de Jager, a fan club was set up. Individuals and companies could rent a chair in the Circus as sponsors. {{ill|Princess Household Appliances|nl}}, a company located in the Dutch city of [[Breda]] owned by {{ill|Aad Ouborg|nl}}, sponsors the circus until 1998. 
Today the circus is owned by the families Steijvers, Ronday and Olivier. The executive board consists of five people.
Circus Herman Renz went bankrupt in October 2015, after the Duursma Group took over the Circus. Duursma Group restarted the Circus Herman Renz with a new series of performances at the Maashorst Fair in Schaijk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kerstcircushermanrenz.nl/|title=Kerstcircus Haarlem – 22 dec. 2017 – 7 jan. 2018 // Burg.

==Awards==
On December 22, 2002 circus Herman Renz received royal recognition. Mayor {{ill|Jaap Pop|nl}} (mayor of the Dutch city of [[Haarlem]]) had the honour of presenting the award. Circus Herman Renz was the first Dutch circus to receive this award, which motivated the employees of Circus Herman Renz to preserve the last great Dutch circus.

During December and January, Circus Herman Renz presented its famous 'Wintershow'. During this period, visitors voted for their favorite artists. The winner received the 'Haarlemse Publieksprijs' (The Harlem Audience Award).

'''Circus Krone''', based in [[Munich]], is one of the largest circuses in Europe&lt;ref&gt;http://www.munichfound.com/sightseeing/all_landmarks/circuskrone/&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the few in Western Europe to also occupy a building ([[Cirque d'hiver|Cirque d'hiver de Paris]], [[Cirque d'hiver d'Amiens]] and [[Cirque Royal]] in [[Brussels]] are some other examples of European circuses occupying a building).

==History==
It was founded in 1905 by [[Carl Krone]] (1870-1943) as an animal exhibition.  Later the circus was run by his daughter Frieda Sembach-Krone and her husband Carl Sembach-Krone. From 1995 until 2017 their daughter Christel Sembach-Krone ran the circus.

Since 1919, the circus has also owned the [[Circus Krone Building]] in Munich. On December 12, 1944, the building was destroyed by bombing attacks. In 1950 it was rebuilt as a circus building with a seating capacity of 3,000 spectators.
 	
In a century, the Circus Krone Imperium became a world-wide recognized institution within the circus world. The outstanding success is based on the maxim "entrepreneur spirit, love of animals
and absolute seriousness". This maxim has been maintained throughout the illustrious history of the family owned and operated Circus Krone.

Carl Krone died in 1943. He did not experience the total destruction of the Circus Krone Building, a destruction caused by aerial bombardment. Humans and animals were evacuated to the Krone Stud Farm in Wessling.

Christel Sembach-Krone directed the fate of the family owned and operated Circus Krone after the death of her father (Carl Sembach, died on January 18, 1984) and her mother (Frieda Sembach-Krone, died on November 2, 1995).

Christel Sembach-Krone, who remained unmarried and had an adoptive daughter named Jana Mandana Lacey-Krone, died on June 20, 2017, after a short illness.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.faz.net/aktuell/gesellschaft/menschen/deutschlands-zirkuskoenigin-mein-pferde-sind-meine-kinder-15070904.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

Lacey-Krone, who is married to [[Martin Lacey, Jr.]] and has one son, will become the new director.

==Features==

Circus Krone has a circus tent with 5,000 seats with a diameter of 48 by 64 metres and a dome height of 14 metres.  It covers an overall area of approximately 2,000 square metres.The largest, most modern and most expensive circus tent of the present can only be described. 	
The construction of the enormous tent allows for the seating of 5.000 spectators. Four 20
meters long steel masts, four steel lattice auxiliary masts, 120 storm and cross beams as
well as 250 iron anchors provide necessary security, even during the most violent of storms.
In less than one day, the gigantic tent construction "stands" with seats, manège, show stage,
light and sound controls - ready for performances, officially approved and in top condition.
Within the area of the illumination engineering with Krone, standards have been established.
Approximately 140 securely installed headlights, as well as eight "golden scans" ensure for
the different lighting effects of the individual numbers. Four "searchlights" place artists and
animals into the right light.The total area of the tent approximately equates to the area of a football field.

Animals used at the circus include lions, Asian and African elephants, a hippopotamus, a rhinoceros, horses, monkeys, pigs, porcupines, goats, zebras and parrots.

'''Dave Stamper''' (November 10, 1883{{spaced ndash}}September 18, 1963) was an [[People of the United States|American]] songwriter of the [[Tin Pan Alley]] and [[vaudeville]] eras, a contributor to twenty-one editions of the [[Ziegfeld Follies]], writer for the Fox Film Corporation, and composer of more than one thousand songs, in spite of never learning to read or write traditional music notation. He may have written "[[Shine On Harvest Moon]]", a claim supported by vaudeville performer and writer [[Eddie Cantor]]. He was also a charter member of the [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]] or ASCAP.&lt;ref name="ASCAP"&gt;{{cite news | title = ASCAP Old Timers Org | publisher = Billboard | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HQwEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PT5&amp;ots=7sjbTls2a_&amp;dq=ASCAP%20charter%20members%20%22Dave%20stamper%22&amp;pg=PT5#v=onepage&amp;q=ASCAP%20charter%20members%20%22Dave%20stamper%22&amp;f=false | date = 6 June 1942 | page = 19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Stamper was born in New York City on November 10, 1883, and took up piano at age ten. At seventeen, he left school and became a pianist at a [[Coney Island]] dance hall for two years before becoming a "[[song-plugger]]" for publisher F. A. Mills. Stamper was twenty when he met singer [[Nora Bayes]] and her husband [[Jack Norworth]] becoming her accompanist and touring widely for the next four years. After Stamper left Bayes' employment, he resumed working as a song-plugger and vaudeville pianist. In 1910 he met [[Gene Buck]], an artist who painted cover images for sheet music. The two started collaborating, with Buck providing lyrics for Stamper's melodies. Their first published songs were ''In the Cool of the Evening,'' ''Daddy Has a Sweetheart (and Mother Is Her Name)'' and ''Some Boy''.&lt;ref name="BigBandsDatabase"&gt;{{cite web  | title = ''Some Boy'' sheet music | publisher = Collection of the New York Public Library | url = http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/id?G00C105_001 | year = 1912 | page = 13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stamper's first marriage to Gertrude Springer ended in divorce after the birth of two children, Maurice and Regina Stamper.  On 16 July 1926 he married "vaudeville and revue comedienne" Edna Leedom&lt;ref name="NYTimesEdna"&gt;{{cite news  | title = EDNA LEEDOM WED TO DAVE STAMPER; Comedienne in 'Ziegfeld Revue' and Composer Married in City Clerk's Office in Newark. | publisher = New York Times | url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30A11FE38551B7A93C5A8178CD85F428285F9 | date = 17 July 1926 | page = 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who had performed in the Follies of 1923, 1924 and 1925.&lt;ref name="BroadwayWorldEdna"&gt;{{cite web | title = Edna Leedom credits | publisher = Broadway World | url = http://broadwayworld.com/people/Edna_Leedom/ | accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage ended within two years. On 16 August. 1928 he married Agnes White, a ''Follies'' performer who was in Stamper and Buck's musical ''Take The Air'' (1927).&lt;ref name="BroadwayDatabaseTakeTheAir"&gt;{{cite web | title = Take The Air | publisher = Internet Broadway Database | url = http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=10499}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple were married for 40 years and produced one daughter, Susan Stamper, a dancer. One of their grandchildren is singer/songwriter [[Happy Rhodes]].

Stamper did not learn to read or write traditional musical notation, creating his own numerical notation.&lt;ref name="StPetersburgTimes"&gt;{{cite web  | title = Expert Can't Read Note But Composes Hit Songs | publisher = The St. Petersburg Times | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KvwyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zk4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6833%2C6669606 | date = 28 December 1946 | page = 13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===The Ziegfeld years===
[[File:Ziegfeld1919 TulipTime sheetmusic.png|thumb|120px|left|alt=Ziegfeld Follies 1919|Sheet music for ''Tulip Time'']]
In 1912 Stamper began writing songs for the Ziegfeld ''Follies of 1913'',&lt;ref name="BroadwayDatabaseStamper"&gt;{{cite web | title = Dave Stamper entry | publisher = Internet Broadway Database | url = http://www.ibdb.com/person.php?id=12439 |accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; contributing ''Just You and I and The Moon'', ''Without You'' and ''Everybody Sometime Must Love Somebody''.&lt;ref name="SomeBoy"&gt;{{cite web | title = Dave Stamper entry | publisher = Big Band Database | url = http://nfo.net/cal/ts8.html |accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited as "additional music" for the ''Follies of 1914'' and 1915, but he wrote the majority of the music for the ''Follies of 1916''.&lt;ref name="BroadwayDatabaseFollies1916"&gt;{{cite web | title = Ziegfeld Follies of 1916 | publisher = Internet Broadway Database | url = http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=6469 |accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was on an equal billing with [[Louis A. Hirsch]], [[Jerome Kern]], and [[Irving Berlin]]. The music of the ''Follies of 1917'' was written by Stamper and [[Raymond Hubbell]] and he was described as "an old hand"&lt;ref name=NYTimes1918&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=The New York Times | page=37 | title=On The Calendar | date=16 June 1918 | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1918/06/16/102710367.pdf | format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; for his work with Louis A. Hirsch by the Follies of 1918. In addition to his 1918 ''Follies'' work, he wrote all the music for ''Ziegfeld Midnight Frolic'' with Gene Buck,&lt;ref name="BroadwayDatabaseFrolic1918"&gt;{{cite web | title = Ziegfeld  Midnight Frolic | publisher = Internet Broadway Database | url = http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=452397 |accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; a series that also had editions in 1919, 1920 and 1921.

The ''Follies of 1919'' found Stamper branching out into writing lyrics&lt;ref name="BroadwayDatabaseFollies1919"&gt;{{cite web | title = Ziegfeld Follies of 1919 | publisher = Internet Broadway Database | url = http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=394721 |accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as writing comic sketches.&lt;ref name=NYTimes1919&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=The New York Times | page=21 | title=On The Calendar | date=23 June 1920 | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1920/06/23/96359243.pdf | format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; 1919 was a very busy year, with Stamper writing songs for the ''Follies'' as well as the ''Midnight Frolic'' and the ''Ziegfeld Nine O'Clock Review'' both of which appeared in a theater on the roof of the New Amsterdam theater.&lt;ref name="BroadwayDatabaseNewAmsterdamRoof"&gt;{{cite web | title = New Amsterdam Roof | publisher = Internet Broadway Database | url = http://www.ibdb.com/venue.php?id=1033 |accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stamper continued as principal songwriter for the Follies of 1920 through 1925, with an additional summer edition in 1923.&lt;ref name="BroadwayDatabase1923Summer"&gt;{{cite web | title = Ziegfeld Follies of 1923 [Summer Edition] | publisher = Internet Broadway Database | url = http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=452545 |accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned for the Follies of 1931, the last edition produced by [[Florenz Ziegfeld]] himself.&lt;ref name="BroadwayDatabaseFollies1931"&gt;{{cite web | title = Ziegfeld Follies of 1931 | publisher = Internet Broadway Database | url = http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=11389 |accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other musicals===
While his work with Ziegfeld encompassed the majority of his working life, Stamper and Gene Buck worked for other producers as well. He had songs in two plays - ''When Claudia Smiles'' (1914)&lt;ref name="BroadwayDatabaseWhenClaudiaSmiles"&gt;{{cite web | title = When Claudia Smiles | publisher = Internet Broadway Database | url = http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=7973 |accessdate=2010-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Broadway and Buttermilk'' (1916)&lt;ref name="BroadwayDatabaseBroadwayandButtermilk"&gt;{{cite web | title = Broadway  and Buttermilk | publisher = Internet Broadway Database | url = http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=8397 |accessdate=2010-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; prior to traveling to London with Buck to write songs for ''Zig Zag!'' which ran for 648 performances at the London Hippodrome.&lt;ref name="ZigZag"&gt;{{cite web | title = Zig Zag! | publisher = The Guide to Musical Theater | url = http://www.guidetomusicaltheatre.com/shows_z/zigzag.htm |accessdate=2010-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stamper returned to London in 1918 to write songs for another review ''Box O' Tricks'' with Frederick Chapelle,&lt;ref name="BoxOTricks"&gt;{{cite web | title = Box O' Tricks | publisher = The Guide to Musical Theater | url = http://www.guidetomusicaltheatre.com/shows_b/boxotricks.htm |accessdate=2010-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; which ran for 625 performances. During his first trip to London, Buck befriended a man who turned out to be a German spy.&lt;ref name="Rickenbacker"&gt;{{cite book |title=Eddie Rickenbacker: an American hero in the twentieth century  |last=Lewis |first=Walter David |year=2005 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=0-8018-8244-3 |page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two results of this event were fellow passenger [[Eddie Rickenbacker]] deciding to enlist to fly, and Dave Stamper having to prove to British police and a Judge that his pages covered with numbers were sheet music rather than a code.&lt;ref name=Rhodeways8&gt;{{cite journal |year=1996 |title=Now We See Our History |journal=Rhodeways |publisher= Sharon Nichols|volume=8|pages=10|url=http://www.rhodeways.com/Rhodeways_Issue08_Spring96.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stamper was fully occupied with work for Ziegfeld until 1927, when Gene Buck hired Stamper to write the music for ''Take The Air'' (1927).&lt;ref name="BroadwayDatabaseTakeTheAir"/&gt; He also worked for the [[Jacob J. Shubert|Schubert organization]] on ''Lovely Lady'' (1927)&lt;ref name="BroadwayDatabaseLovelyLady"&gt;{{cite web | title = Lovely Lady | publisher = Internet Broadway Database | url = http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=10542 |accessdate=2010-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; before returning to Ziegfeld for the 1931 Follies.

He finished out his work on Broadway with ''Provincetown Follies'' (1935)&lt;ref name="BroadwayDatabaseProvincetownFollies"&gt;{{cite web | title = Provincetown  Follies | publisher = Internet Broadway Database | url = http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=12017 |accessdate=2010-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; which only ran for 63 performances and ''Orchids Preferred'' (1937)&lt;ref name="BroadwayDatabaseOrchidsPreferred"&gt;{{cite web | title = Orchids  Preferred | publisher = Internet Broadway Database | url = http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=12222 |accessdate=2010-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; which closed in a week.

===Hollywood===
In 1928, Stamper was signed by Fox Film Corporation as a staff composer, remaining there until 1930. He contributed ''Dance Away the Night'' and ''Peasant Love Song'' to the film ''[[Married in Hollywood]]'' (1929)&lt;ref name="IMDBMarriedInHollywood"&gt;{{cite web | title = Married In Hollywood | publisher = Internet Movie Database | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0020147/ |accessdate=2010-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; often called the first filmed operetta. The film ''[[Words and Music (1929 film)|Words and Music]]'' (1929)&lt;ref name="IMDBWordsAndMusic"&gt;{{cite web | title = Words and Music | publisher = Internet Movie Database | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0020604/ |accessdate=2010-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; featured ''The Hunting Song'', ''Take a Little Tip'' and ''Too Wonderful for Words'' all written with lyricist [[Harlan Thompson]]. In 1930, he contributed ''Only One'' and ''The Gay Heart'' written with [[Clare Kummer]] and ''Once In A While'' written with Clare Kummer and Cecil Arnold

===Shine On, Harvest Moon===
Stamper claimed&lt;ref name="StPetersburgTimes"/&gt; to have written "[[Shine On, Harvest Moon]]", while the writers of record were his former employers [[Nora Bayes]] and [[Jack Norworth]]. Stamper's claim was supported by vaudeville comic [[Eddie Cantor]] in his 1934 book ''Ziegfeld, The Great Glorifier''&lt;ref name=EddieCantor&gt;{{cite book |title=Ziegfeld, The Great Glorifier|last=Cantor |first=Eddie|authorlink=Eddie Cantor|author2=David Freedman |year=1934 |publisher=A.H. King|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; and David Ewen's ''All the Years of American Popular Music''.&lt;ref name="AmericanPopularMusic"&gt;{{cite book |last = Ewen  |first = David |title = All the Years of American Popular Music  |publisher = Prentice Hall |page=189  |year = 1977  |isbn = 0-13-022442-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stamper was working as a pianist rather than as a songwriter at the time the song appeared but never learned how to read or write using traditional music notation&lt;ref name="StPetersburgTimes"/&gt; thus he would have not been able submit the song for copyright, or produce sheet music to prove his claim. Bayes and Norworth compelled Stamper at one point to wear stage make-up to appear Japanese,&lt;ref name="VaudevilleHonkyTonks2Palace"&gt;{{cite book |last= Laurie |first= Joe  |title= Vaudeville: from the honky-tonks to the Palace |publisher= Holt |year= 1953 | page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; apparently to keep him from being interviewed by reporters.

==In popular culture==

Stamper's caricature was on the [[List of caricatures at Sardi's restaurant|wall at Sardi's restaurant]].

Stamper and Buck's song ''The Shakespearian Rag'' appears in T. S. Eliot's ''[[The Waste Land]]'':&lt;ref name="TheWasteLand"&gt;{{cite book |last= Ackerley |first= C J |title= T S Eliot: 'The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock' and 'The Waste Land' |publisher= Humanities-Ebooks |year= 2007  |isbn= 978-1-84760-015-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote |''But''&lt;br&gt;
''O O O O that Shakespeherian Rag—''&lt;br&gt;
''It's so elegant''&lt;br&gt;
''So intelligent''|[[T. S. Eliot]]|''[[The Waste Land]]''}}

[[Ring Lardner]] and [[George S. Kaufman]] mentioned Stamper in their play ''[[June Moon]]'':&lt;ref name="RingLardner"&gt;{{cite book |last= Lardner |first= Ring |author2=George S. Kaufman |title= June Moon: A Comedy in a Prologue and Three Acts |publisher= C. Scribner's Sons |year= 1931  |page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote | '''Paul''': ''Did I tell you what Dave Stamper said about it?'' &lt;br&gt;
'''Lucille''': ''Yes!''&lt;br&gt;
'''Paul''': ''He said it was another "Paprika". Wait till you hear it played. Dave Stamper says it's sure fire.''}}

John Hyams played Stamper in the 1936 film ''[[The Great Ziegfeld]]'' starring [[William Powell]], which won the [[Academy Award for Best Motion Picture]].&lt;ref name="TheGreatZiegfeld"&gt;{{cite web | title = The Great Ziegfeld | publisher = Internet Movie Database | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0027698/ |accessdate=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; His songwriting partner Gene Buck was played by [[William Demarest]], best known as "Uncle Charley" on the TV show ''[[My Three Sons]]''.

A '''gamebook''' is a work of printed [[fiction]] that allows the reader to participate in the story by making choices. The narrative branches along various paths, typically through the use of numbered paragraphs or pages. Gamebooks are sometimes called '''choose your own adventure books''' or '''CYOA''' after the influential [[Choose Your Own Adventure]] series originally published by US company [[Bantam Books]]. Gamebooks influenced [[hypertext fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;The Evolution of Fantasy Role-Playing Games
By Michael J. Tresca page 100&lt;/ref&gt;

Production of new gamebooks in the West decreased dramatically during the nineties as choice based stories have moved away from print based media, although the format may be getting a new lease of life on mobile and ebook platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Keith Stuart |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2011/jan/11/interactive-fiction-ebooks-apple-kindle |title=Interactive fiction in the ebook era &amp;#124; Technology |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such digital gamebooks are considered [[interactive fiction]].

==Description==
Gamebooks can be grouped into three families.&lt;ref name="gamebooks.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamebooks.org/show_faqs.php |title=FAQs - Demian's Gamebook Web Page |website=Gamebooks.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The first is the branching-plot novel, which require the reader to make choices but are otherwise like a regular novel. 
* The second type is the Solitaire adventure (an example of this is the ''[[Tunnels and Trolls]]'' series of gamebooks), which combines the branching-plot novel with the rules of a [[role-playing game]], allowing the game to be played without a [[Gamemaster]] but may require the purchase of separate manuals. 
* The third type is the Adventure gamebook (examples of these are the ''[[Fighting Fantasy]]'' and ''[[Lone Wolf (gamebooks)|Lone Wolf]]'' series of gamebooks), which essentially combines the two: a branching-plot novel that comes complete with a simple role-playing system unique to the book (or series).

In all gamebooks, the story is presented as a series of sections of printed text. Branching-plot novel sections often run to several pages in length, whereas solitaire and adventure gamebook sections are usually no longer than a paragraph or two. At the end of a text section, the reader is usually given a choice of narrative branches that they may follow. Each branch contains a reference to the number of the paragraph or page that should be read next if that branch is chosen (e.g. to go north turn to section 98). The story continues this way until a paragraph or page which ends that branch of the story. In most solitaire or adventure gamebooks, there is usually one "successful" ending, and the remainder are "failures."&lt;ref name="fightingfantasygamebooks.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is Fighting Fantasy?|url=http://www.fightingfantasygamebooks.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7&amp;Itemid=37|work=Fighting Fantasy|publisher=ICON (Wizard) Books Ltd|accessdate=27 May 2012|author=Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Branching plot novels, on the other hand, tend to be more concerned with narrative resolution rather than winning or losing, thus often have several endings which may be deemed "successful".

Gamebooks are typically written in the [[Second-person narrative|second person]] with the reader assuming the role of a character to experience the world from that character's point of view (e.g. 'you walk into the cold and dark forest').

Many titles are usually published in series containing several books, although individual gamebooks have also been published. While the books in many series are stand-alone narratives, others continue the narrative from the previous books in the series.

==History==
{{Synthesis|section|date=June 2017}}

===Origins===
Several influences contributed to the development of the gamebook format during the twentieth century. An early example of the form is ''Consider the Consequences!'' by Doris Webster and Mary Alden Hopkins, published in the United States in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;https://rubensteinlibrary.tumblr.com/post/165617259862/consider-the-consequences-by-doris-webster-and&lt;/ref&gt; The 1936 play [[Night of January 16th]] by [[Ayn Rand]] also allowed the reader to influence the ending. The play is designed so that members of the audience get to choose whether a defendant is guilty or not; the audience's decision determines which of two possible endings is played out.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/1995-01-25/entertainment/ca-29612_1_rand-s-night-of-january&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=oX8hmVw_yXYC&amp;pg=PA323&amp;lpg=PA323&amp;dq=branching+path+narrative#v=onepage&amp;q=branching%20path%20narrative&amp;f=false | title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Narrative Theory| isbn=978-1134458400| last1=Herman| first1=David| last2=Jahn| first2=Manfred| last3=Ryan| first3=Marie-Laure| date=2010-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The children's book ''Treasure Hunt'', published in 1945 in Britain under the name of "Alan George" (probably a pseudonym), is another early example of a story with multiple paths for the reader to follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fightingfantazine.co.uk/|title=The Early History of Gamebooks: Discoveries|publisher=Fighting Fantazine|date= |accessdate=2016-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also quite early on, the possibility of having stories branching out into several different paths was suggested by [[Jorge Luis Borges]] in his short story "[[An Examination of the Work of Herbert Quain]]" (1941). This story features an author whose novel is a three-part story containing two branch points, and with nine possible endings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamebooks.org/show_item.php?id=7380 |title=Item - Examen de la obra de Herbert Quain - Demian's Gamebook Web Page |website=Gamebooks.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miscellaneous Works by Jorge Luis Borges"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamebooks.org/show_series.php?id=1045 |title=Series - Miscellaneous Works by Jorge Luis Borges - Demian's Gamebook Web Page |website=Gamebooks.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another story by Borges, titled "[[The Garden of Forking Paths]]" (1941), also describes a book with a maze-like narrative, which may have inspired the gamebook form.&lt;ref name="Miscellaneous Works by Jorge Luis Borges"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamebooks.org/show_item.php?id=7381 |title=Item - El Jardín de senderos que se bifurcan - Demian's Gamebook Web Page |website=Gamebooks.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Programmed learning]] materials, first proposed by [[B.F. Skinner]],&lt;ref name="jrank1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychology.jrank.org/pages/505/Programmed-Learning.html |title=Programmed Learning - Operant Conditioning, Students, and Answers - JRank Articles |publisher=Psychology.jrank.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been recognized as an early influence on the development of branching path books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/gamebook |title=Media : Gamebook : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia |website=Sf-encyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This learning method was first applied in the TutorText series of interactive textbooks, published from the late fifties up until the early seventies. These books present the reader with a series of problems related to a particular area of study, allowing him or her to choose among several possible answers. If the answer to a problem is correct, the reader moves on to the next problem. If the answer is incorrect, the reader is given feedback and is asked to pick a different answer. This educational technique would form a basis for many later narrative gamebook series .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamebooks.org/show_series.php?id=457 |title=Series - TutorText: Doubleday Series - Demian's Gamebook Web Page |website=Gamebooks.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jrank1"/&gt;

During the sixties, authors from several different countries started experimenting with fiction that contained multiple paths and/or endings. Some literary works in this vein include the French-language novel ''L'ironie du sort'' (1961) by [[Paul Guimard]], the Spanish-language novels [[Rayuela|''Hopscotch'']] (1963) by [[Julio Cortazar]] and ''Juego de cartas'' (Card Game, 1964) by [[Max Aub]], and the works of the French literary group known as the [[Oulipo]] (1967).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamebooks.org/show_item.php?id=1846 |title=Item - Un conte à votre façon - Demian's Gamebook Web Page |website=Gamebooks.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamebooks.org/show_item.php?id=1847 |title=Item - The Theater Tree: A Combinatory Play - Demian's Gamebook Web Page |website=Gamebooks.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamebooks.org/show_series.php?id=292 |title=Series - Miscellaneous Works by the Oulipo - Demian's Gamebook Web Page |website=Gamebooks.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://librojuegos.org/2015/10/juego-de-cartas-de-max-aub-por-cuadernosvigia/&lt;/ref&gt; Other early experiments include the short stories "Alien Territory" and "The Lost Nose: a Programmed Adventure" (both 1969) by [[John Sladek]], the novel'' [[The French Lieutenant's Woman]]'' (1969) by [[John Fowles]], and the collection of short stories titled ''Tante storie per giocare'' (Many Tales to Play With, 1971) by Italian author [[Gianni Rodari]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?873656 |title=Title: The Lost Nose: A Programmed Book |website=Isfdb.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ansible-editions.co.uk/authors/sladek.htm |title=About John Sladek |website=Ansible-editions.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamebooks.org/show_item.php?id=1709 |title=Alien Territory |publisher=Gamebooks.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
Taken together, these influences may have contributed to the development of several pioneering gamebooks in the sixties and seventies. These include ''Lucky Les'' by [[E.W. Hildick]] (1967), ''State of Emergency'' by Dennis Guerrier and Joan Richards (1969), and the Swedish-language book ''Den mystiska påsen'' (The Mysterious Bag, 1970) by Betty Orr-Nilsson, among others. The first gamebook series proper appears to have been Tracker Books, published by Transworld in the UK between 1972 and 1980. This series includes adventures in a variety of genres such as science fiction, mystery, and sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamebooks.org/show_item.php?id=1650 |title=Item - Lucky Les - Demian's Gamebook Web Page |website=Gamebooks.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamebooks.org/show_series.php?id=244 |title=Series - Lucky Les - Demian's Gamebook Web Page |website=Gamebooks.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamebooks.org/show_series.php?id=1214 |title=Series - Miscellaneous Works by Dennis Guerrier - Demian's Gamebook Web Page |website=Gamebooks.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamebooks.org/show_item.php?id=4341 |title=Item - Den mystiska påsen - Demian's Gamebook Web Page |website=Gamebooks.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamebooks.org/show_series.php?id=640 |title=Series - Den mystiska påsen - Demian's Gamebook Web Page |website=Gamebooks.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, in the US, ''The Adventures of You'' series appeared in 1976-77, with two titles that would later become part of the groundbreaking [[Choose Your Own Adventure]] series: ''Sugarcane Island'' by [[Edward Packard (writer)|Edward Packard]] and ''Journey Under the Sea'' by [[R. A. Montgomery]].

[[Tabletop role-playing games]] such as [[Dungeons and Dragons]] were another early influence that would contribute in major ways to the development of the gamebook form. The first module which combined a branching-path narrative with a set of role-playing game rules was ''Buffalo Castle'' for the [[Tunnels and Trolls]] system (1975). ''Buffalo Castle'' was innovative for its time, as it allowed the reader to experience a role-playing session without need for a referee. It has been followed by many other solitaire adventures for the T&amp;T system, as well as solos for other tabletop role-playing games.

===Popularization (1970s–onwards)===
====Branching-path books====
''The Adventures of You'' series, authored by [[Edward Packard (writer)|Edward Packard]] and [[R.A. Montgomery]] and initially published by Vermont Crossroads Press, laid much of the groundwork for the later surge in popularity of the gamebook format. The series was born with ''Sugarcane Island'' by Edward Packard, which was written in 1969 but did not see publication until 1976. The series later included ''Journey Under the Sea'' by [[R. A. Montgomery]] (1977). After the series' end, two standalone gamebooks authored by Packard would follow, both published by Lippincott: ''Deadwood City'' (1978) and ''The Third Planet from Altair'' (1979). While these early efforts apparently achieved some popularity with readers, they (and the gamebook format in general) still did not have a publisher with the marketing strength required to make them available to mass audiences.
  
Packard and Montgomery took the idea of publishing interactive books to [[Bantam Books|Bantam]], and thus the  [[Choose Your Own Adventure]] (CYOA) series was born in 1979, beginning with ''[[The Cave of Time]]''. The series became immensely popular worldwide and several titles were translated into more than 25 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamebooks.org/show_series.php?id=30 |title=Choose Your Own Adventure |publisher=Gamebooks.org |date=2004-06-09 |accessdate=2012-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series reached the peak of its popularity with children in the eighties. It was during this period that Bantam released several other interactive series to capitalize on the popularity of the medium (a few examples are: Choose your Own Adventure for Younger Readers, [[Time Machine (novel series)|Time Machine]] and [[Be An Interplanetary Spy]]). Many other American publishers released their own series to compete with CYOA. One of the most popular competitors seems to have been [[TSR (company)|TSR]], who released several branching-path novels based on their own role-playing games. The most famous TSR series was [[Endless Quest]]. Another strong competitor was [[Ballantine Books|Ballantine]] with their [[Find Your Fate]] series, which featured adventures in the [[Indiana Jones]], [[James Bond]] and [[Doctor Who]] universes. Famous author [[R. L. Stine]] wrote several books for this line, including ''The Badlands of Hark'', as well as for other series such as Wizards, Warriors and You. Several Choose your Own Adventure spin-offs and many competing series were translated into other languages.

Branching-path books also started to appear during the eighties in several other countries, including Spain, France,  the United Kingdom, Mexico, Chile, and Denmark. In some other countries, publication both of translated series and of original books began in later years. For example, the first original books in Brazil and Italy seem to have appeared in the nineties. Translated editions of Choose your Own Adventure and other Western series only appeared in Eastern European countries after the fall of Communism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamebooks.org |title=Demian's Gamebook Web Page |website=Gamebooks.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of book was seen predominantly as a form of entertainment for children. Nonetheless, there were books with more didactic purposes (ranging from historical series such as the aforementioned Time Machine to books with religious themes such as the Making Choices series). Also, a few branching-path books were aimed at adults, ranging from business simulations to works of erotica.

The branching-path book commercial boom dwindled in the early nineties, and the number of new series diminished. However, new branching-path books continue to be published to this day in several countries and languages. Choose your Own Adventure went on to become the longest running gamebook series with 185 titles. The first run of the series ended in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamebooks.org/show_item.php?id=162 |title=Item - Sugarcane Island - Demian's Gamebook Web Page |website=Gamebooks.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamebooks.org/show_item.php?id=163 |title=Item - Journey Under the Sea - Demian's Gamebook Web Page |website=Gamebooks.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamebooks.org/show_series.php?id=28 |title=Series - The Adventures of You Series - Demian's Gamebook Web Page |website=Gamebooks.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamebooks.org/show_item.php?id=518 |title=Item - The Cave of Time - Demian's Gamebook Web Page |website=Gamebooks.org |date=2014-08-01 |accessdate=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamebooks.org/show_series.php?id=30 |title=Series - Choose Your Own Adventure (1979-1998) - Demian's Gamebook Web Page |website=Gamebooks.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

R. A. Montgomery started rereleasing some Choose Your Own Adventure titles in 2005. His company has also released some new titles. New books and series continue to be published in other countries to this day. Examples are the ''1000 Gefahren'' series in Germany and the ''Tú decides la aventura'' series in Spain.

====Outside the English-speaking world====
Despite the domination of works that have been translated from English in most non-English speaking countries, a sizable number of original gamebooks—both individual books and series—have been published in various countries; this is especially the case in [[France]] (e.g. the ''La Saga du Prêtre Jean'' series).{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

In the 1990s, the gamebook genre became highly popular in [[Bulgaria]] for approximately ten years.&lt;ref name=list&gt;{{cite web|author=Hakop &amp;amp; J0K3RA |url=http://www.citadelata.com/index.php?show=63 |title=Цитаделата |publisher=Citadelata.com |date=2006-11-15 |accessdate=2012-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst internationally well-known series such as [[Choose Your Own Adventure]] and [[Fighting Fantasy]] were translated for the Bulgarian market, the works of numerous Bulgarian gamebook authors were most popular with readers.

During the popularity peak of gamebooks in Bulgaria, Bulgarian publishing houses believed that only Western authors would sell and, as a consequence, virtually all Bulgarian gamebook authors adopted English pseudonyms.&lt;ref name=list/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamebooks.org/show_country.php?id=18 |title=Items Published in Bulgaria |publisher=Gamebooks.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This tradition persisted after their nationality was publicly disclosed. A smaller number of [[Hungary|Hungarian]] authors also adopted Western pseudonyms, in addition to "official titles" that were also in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Items Published in Hungary|url=http://www.gamebooks.org/show_country.php?id=21|work=Demian's Gamebook Web Page|publisher=Demian Katz|accessdate=27 May 2012|author=Demian Katz|year=1998–2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several adventure gamebooks have been released in the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Russia]]. In [[Azerbaijan]], [[Narmin Kamal]]'s novel, ''Open It's Me'', offers the reader a choice to either read the book as a random collection of thirty-nine short stories about the same character, or as a single novel. A photo of the book's hero is published on the final page and the author asks the reader questions about the character.

Since the mid-1980s, about 90 gamebooks have been published in [[Poland]], not only as printed books, but also as comics, e-books or mobile applications. The author of the largest number of titles (14) is [[Beniamin Tytus Muszyński|Beniamin Muszyński]]. Polish gamebooks are also regularly written and self-published by their fans&lt;ref&gt;Beniamin Muszyński „Gry książkowe”, [w:] Literadar #16, s. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Gamebook types==
===Mainstream fiction===
While most gamebooks have traditionally being aimed at young audiences, there have been several attempts to write adult-oriented branching path stories. Barring the aforementioned works of Dennis Guerrier in the sixties, one of the earliest examples of the form is the five-volume ''Barcelona, Maxima Discrecion'' series, which adapted the [[noir fiction]] genre to an interactive form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamebooks.org/show_series.php?id=689 |title=Series - Barcelona máxima discreción - Demian's Gamebook Web Page |website=Gamebooks.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Published in the eighties, this series was only available in Catalan and Spanish.

[[Heather McElhatton]] published a bestselling&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/books/blog/2007/06/paperback_ficti_27.html |title=''Boston Globe'' bestseller list for paperback fiction: June 5, 2007 |publisher=Boston.com |date=2007-06-05 |accessdate=2012-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; gamebook for adults in 2007, called ''[[Pretty Little Mistakes|Pretty Little Mistakes: A Do-Over Novel]]''.  It was followed by a sequel titled ''Million Little Mistakes'' published in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2010/09/06/mcelhatton/ Kerr, Euan. "Author lets readers choose what to do with lottery millions]" ''[[Minnesota Public Radio]]'' September 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Some contemporary literary novels have used the gamebook format, including [[Kim Newman]]'s ''[[Life's Lottery]]'' (1999) and Nicholas Bourbaki's ''If'' (2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electricliterature.com/interview-nicholas-bourbaki-author-of-if/ |title=INTERVIEW: Nicholas Bourbaki, author of ''If'' |publisher=ElectricLiterature.com |date=2014-11-08 |accessdate=2014-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
In 2011, McGraw-Hill Education began releasing adaptations of the original [[Choose Your Own Adventure]] titles as [[graded reader]]s. The stories were retold in simplified language and re-organized plotlines, in order to make them easier for [[English as a second or foreign language]] readers to play. The choice format of gamebooks has proved to be popular with ESL teachers as a way to motivate reluctant students, target critical thinking skills, and organize classroom activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ferlazzo|first=Larry|title=The best places to read and write "choose your own adventure" stories|url=http://larryferlazzo.edublogs.org/2009/05/02/the-best-places-to-read-write-choose-your-own-adventure-stories/|accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Erotica===
Various [[erotica|erotic]] gamebooks have been published by major publishers. In 1994 ''Derrière la porte'' by Alina Reyes was published by [[Pocket Books|Pocket Books France]] and [[Éditions Robert Laffont]], and later translated into English for [[Grove Press]] and [[Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson]] (as ''Behind Closed Doors'') and into Italian for [[Ugo Guanda Editore]] (as ''Dietro le porte''). [[Melcher Media]] in 2003 packaged two "Choose-Your-Own-Erotic-Adventure" books for [[Penguin Books]]' Gotham Books imprint, including ''Kathryn in the City'' by [[Mary Anne Mohanraj]], a well-known writer of erotica.

===Role-playing solitaire adventures===
Solitaire adventures were a parallel development. This type of book is intended to allow a single person to use the rules of a role-playing game to experience an adventure without need of a referee. The first role-playing game solitaire adventures to be published were those using the ''[[Tunnels and Trolls]]'' system, beginning with the book ''[[Buffalo Castle]]'' in 1976, making ''Tunnels and Trolls'' the first role-playing game to support solitaire play. Flying Buffalo released 24 solo adventure books (plus several pocket size adventures) in the period 1976–1993. A number of the adventures are still in print today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamebooks.org/show_item.php?id=2703 |title=Item - Buffalo Castle - Demian's Gamebook Web Page |website=Gamebooks.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamebooks.org/show_series.php?id=111 |title=Series - Tunnels and Trolls - Demian's Gamebook Web Page |website=Gamebooks.org |date=2012-06-12 |accessdate=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were very successful among players of role-playing games and inspired many imitators.

Another early role-playing game with solitaire modules made for it was ''[[The Fantasy Trip]]''. The first such module was Death Test, published in 1978. Eight adventures were released in total. One thing that set them apart was the need for miniatures and a hexmap, in order to take advantage of the combat and movement systems. These adventures were also very popular and influential.

Meanwhile, several third-party publishers started to publish solitaire adventures meant for use with popular roleplaying systems. Some of the earliest adventures in this vein were The Solo Dungeon (1978) by British author Richard Bartle, and Survival of the Fittest (1979), published by Judges' Guild in the United States. Both of these adventures were meant to be used with Dungeons and Dragons rules.

Solitaire role-playing adventures also experienced a boom in the eighties. Many role-playing rulesets included solo adventures which were intended to teach the rules systems to the players. Some companies released lines of solitaire adventures for their own games. Examples of games with prolific solitaire lines were [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]], [[GURPS]], [[The Dark Eye|Das Schwarze Auge]], [[DC Heroes]], and [[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]. Some third-party publishers continued to release solo adventures for established RPG systems (including Judges' Guild, who released solos for Advanced Dungeons and Dragons). Solitaire adventures were also featured quite frequently in professional RPG magazines and fanzines. Several solo adventures (such as those for Tunnels &amp; Trolls, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and Das Schwarze Auge) were translated into other languages.

As was the case with other types of gamebooks, the production of solitaire RPG adventures decreased dramatically during the nineties. However, new solos continue to be published to this day. Some companies continue to produce solo adventures for Tunnels &amp; Trolls. There are also new solo adventures for a variety of systems, and even some influenced by the Fantasy Trip solos (such as the ones by Dark City Games). The Internet has provided a channel to distribute solitaire adventures, with both free and commercial adventures made available as electronic documents.

===Adventure gamebooks===
Adventure gamebooks incorporate elements from [[Choose Your Own Adventure]] books and role-playing solitaire adventures. The books involve a branching path format in order to move between sections of text, but the reader creates a character as in a role-playing game, and resolves actions using a game-system. Unlike role-playing solitaire adventures, adventure gamebooks include all the rules needed for play in each book. Adventure gamebooks are usually not divided into numbered pages, but rather into numbered sections of text, so that several sections may fit in a single page, or a single section can span several pages.

''[[The Warlock of Firetop Mountain]]'' was published in 1982, the first of what became the [[Fighting Fantasy]] series of gamebooks, one of the first adventure gamebook series. With over 60 titles, including a variety of spin-offs, the series popularised the gamebook format in the UK and many other countries, such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Singapore, the United States, Portugal, Tanzania, Brazil, Spain, France, Germany, Italy, Denmark, Israel, Japan, and after the fall of communism, Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamebooks.org/show_item.php?id=37 |title=Item - The Warlock of Firetop Mountain - Demian's Gamebook Web Page |website=Gamebooks.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamebooks.org/show_series.php?id=11 |title=Series - Fighting Fantasy - Demian's Gamebook Web Page |website=Gamebooks.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Adventure gamebooks experienced a publishing boom in the eighties, most notably in the United Kingdom, the United States, Italy and France. British series such as ''Fighting Fantasy'', ''Lone Wolf'', and ''The Way of the Tiger'' were translated into several languages and became very popular worldwide. The boom decreased considerably in the nineties, with [[Fabled Lands]] being the last major British gamebook series. In the 2000s, reissues of the ''Fighting Fantasy'' and ''Lone Wolf'' series emerged, and garnered some commercial success.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Several authors in different countries continue to publish adventure gamebooks in the late 2010s. Notable examples are German fantasy authors [[Wolfgang Hohlbein]] and [[Markus Heitz]], and British author [[Jonathan Green (speculative fiction writer)|Jonathan Green]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

'''"Gloria al Bravo Pueblo"''' (''Glory to the Brave People'') was adopted as [[Venezuela]]'s [[national anthem]] by President [[Antonio Guzmán Blanco]] on May 25, 1881. The lyrics were written by the physician and journalist [[Vicente Salias]] in 1810. The music was later composed by musician Juan José Landaeta. It is said, however, that the melody has been known since 1840 as ''La Marsellesa Venezolana'' (''Venezuelan Marseillaise''), in reference to its subtle similarity to the [[La Marseillaise|French national anthem]].

Some recent investigations have suggested that the real author of the anthem was [[Andrés Bello]], and not Salias, to whom it was originally credited, and the music was composed by another musician called [[Lino Gallardo]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} However, this theory has yet to be proven, and lacks any real recognition among the general Venezuelan population, historians, or otherwise.

== Usage ==
The Venezuelan national anthem is played every day on radio and television broadcasts at 12:00 am, 6:00 am and 12:00 pm (either the full version or the chorus, first stanza and chorus) on all national TV networks. On radio broadcasts, the state anthem is played after the national anthem, which is also the case in state TV stations. {{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

In most occasions, only the chorus, first stanza and the chorus are played or even the chorus itself. Sometimes the chorus is played twice in the beginning, and once in the rest of the anthem. In formal events (if the anthem will be played by either a [[military band]], [[concert band]] or [[orchestra]]) the format is: Chorus (2x), First verse and Chorus (2x), with the optional introduction. If played in full the chorus is sung twice, with or without the introductory notes.

[[File:SenatorProxmire.jpg|right|upright|thumb|[[William Proxmire]] issued the dubious honor 168 times for what he deemed wasteful spending]]
The '''Golden Fleece Award''' (1975–1988) was a [[tongue-in-cheek]] award given to public officials in the United States for their squandering of public money, its name sardonically purloined from the actual [[Order of the Golden Fleece]], a prestigious chivalric award created in the late-15th Century, and a play on the transitive verb ''fleece'', as in charging excessively for goods or services. [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[William Proxmire]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from [[Wisconsin]], began to issue the Golden Fleece Award in 1975 in monthly [[press release]]s.&lt;ref name="Severo"&gt;{{cite news |last=Severo |first=Richard |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/16/us/william-proxmire-maverick-democratic-senator-from-wisconsin-is-dead-at.html |title=William Proxmire, Maverick Democratic Senator From Wisconsin, Is Dead at 90 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 16, 2005 |access-date=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="toledo" /&gt;  ''[[The Washington Post]]'' once referred to the award as "the most successful [[public relations]] device in politics today."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ajFPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-QIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6796,927271 |title=Guardian dragon will doze: 'Golden Fleece' award is about to go into the attic |first=Mike |last=Mills |newspaper=Toledo Blade |page=B2 |date=October 16, 1988 |access-date=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Senator [[Robert Byrd]] of West Virginia, referred to the award as being "as much a part of the Senate as [[quorum call]]s and [[filibuster]]s."&lt;ref name=Severo/&gt;

==Award==
[[William Proxmire]], a [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] who represented the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] from [[Wisconsin]], issued the award monthly from 1975 until 1988, his Senate retirement.&lt;ref name="toledo" /&gt; In total, he issued 168 Golden Fleece Awards.&lt;ref name="top10" /&gt; Though some members of the [[United States House of Representatives]] asked Proxmire's permission to continue the award, he declined, saying he might continue to issue them as a private citizen.&lt;ref name="toledo" /&gt; Other organizations patterned their own "Golden Fleece Awards" after Proxmire's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A 'Golden Fleece' Award for LIRR Workers |newspaper=[[Newsday]] |first=Bill |last=Bleyer |date=May 13, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Library initiative wins top 'Golden Fleece' award |newspaper=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]] |first=Ray |last=Huard |date=April 16, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Taxpayers for Common Sense]], a nonpartisan federal budget watchdog organization, gave Proxmire their lifetime achievement award in 1999,&lt;ref name=top10&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jqcaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Yy8EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6680,3317353 |newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] |title=Proxmire honored for sharp eye on $: Taxpayers' group gives founder of Golden Fleece an award of his own |first=Frank A. |last=Aukofer |page=3A |date=December 8, 1999 |access-date=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and revived the Golden Fleece Award in 2000. Proxmire served as an honorary chairman of the organization.&lt;ref name=toledo&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XskwAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=uAMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1401,1854305 |title=Golden Fleece award returns in watchdog role |newspaper=[[The Blade (Toledo)|The Blade]] |page=A1 |date=July 6, 2000 |access-date=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One winner of the Golden Fleece Award, behavioral scientist Ronald Hutchinson, sued Proxmire for [[libel]], requesting $8 million in damages, in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BApZAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=HUYNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3317,5507905 |title=Proxmire 'Fleeced' Of His Immunity |newspaper=The Daily Union Democrat |page=2 |date=June 26, 1979 |access-date=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=O1waAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mykEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3801,768298 |title=Proxmire Award Now a Court Issue |newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal |page=3 |date=January 21, 1979 |access-date=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proxmire claimed that his statements about Hutchinson's research were protected by the [[Speech or Debate Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]]. The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled, in ''Hutchinson v. Proxmire'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|443|111|1979}}, 61 L.Ed. 2d 411, 99 S.Ct. 2675 (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; that the protection of speech and debate of lawmakers in the Constitution did not shield Proxmire from liability for defamatory statements made outside of formal congressional proceedings. The case was later settled out of court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/28/us/senator-proxmire-bars-race-in-1988.html |title=Senator Proxmire Bars Race in 1988 |newspaper=The New York Times |first=David |last=Johnston |date=August 28, 1987 |access-date=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proxmire continued to present the award following the suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QuYLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5VgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3254,995948 |title=Golden Fleece: Award Goes To Study Showing Pot, Scuba Diving Don't Mix |agency=Associated Press |newspaper=The Evening Independent |page=3-A |date=July 20, 1979 |access-date=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In his 2014 book ''Creativity, Inc.'', [[Pixar]] President [[Ed Catmull]] spoke of the "chilling effect on research" The Golden Fleece Award exerts. He argues that when you fund thousands of research projects, some have measurable, positive impacts and that others don't. It is not possible to predict what the results of every research project would be or whether they would have value. He further argues that failure in research is essential and that fear of failure would distort the way researchers choose projects, which would ultimately impede progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Creativity, Inc. |first1=Edwin |last1=Catmull |first2=Amy |last2=Wallace |isbn=978-0552167260 |year=2014 |publisher=Transworld Publishers Limited |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iBcBoQEACAAJ |access-date=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also gave the award to the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) for their [[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] (SETI) program, supporting the scientific search for [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] [[civilization|civilizations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wgBKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Ph4NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1496,2004486 |title=NASA searches for extraterrestrial dollars |first=Art |last=Levine |page=4 |newspaper=The Michigan Daily |date=October 5, 1978 |access-date=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proxmire later withdrew his opposition to the SETI program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Astronomy; Listening To The Stars Gets Respect |newspaper=[[Boston Globe]] |first=David L. |last=Chandler |date=June 25, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is widely believed he gave the award to a study of the sex life of the [[Cochliomyia|screwworm fly]], the results of which led scientists to create sterile screwworms that were released into the wild and eliminated this major cattle parasite from North and Central America, and reduced the cost of beef and dairy products across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yager |first1=Mariana |last2=Emmett |first2=Michael |title=How worms' sex behavior can have a major impact on understanding human disease |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3448588/ |journal=Proceedings (Baylor University Medical Center) |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=395–396 |date=October 2012 |pmid=23077397 |pmc=3448588 |access-date=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no evidence for this claim in the archives of the Award held by the Wisconsin Historical Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/turningpoints/search.asp?id=1742 |title=Golden Fleece Awards, 1975-1987 -- Turning Points in Wisconsin History |access-date=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA)-funded research on the sex life of the screwworm fly took place in the 1930s through 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nal.usda.gov/exhibits/speccoll/exhibits/show/stop-screwworms--selections-fr/1930s |title=1930s -- STOP Screwworms: Selections from the Screwworm Eradication Collection |work=Special Collections Exhibits |access-date=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; long before the Golden Fleece era of the 1970s and 80s, when Proxmire largely targeted contemporary research.

The '''gunungan''' (Javanese "mountain", "savory"), also known as '''kayon''' or '''kayonan''' (from ''kayu'', "wood" or "tree") in Bali, is a figure in the Indonesian theatrical performance of [[wayang]] e.g. [[wayang kulit]], [[wayang klitik]], and [[wayang golek]]. A gunungan is a symmetrical-shaped figure of translucent parchment made of dried, firm beef skin, whose outline is pointed in Java and more rounded in Bali. In a wayang performance, the gunungan is the first to appear on the screen and the last to appear before the end. Gunungan also marks transition between different screen and can also serve as a prop. A gunungan symbolizes the world-mountain (called the Meru). Gunungan also appears in the visual art, e.g. the painted scrolls of [[wayang beber]], in crafts or as architectural elements.

==Form==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Wajangfiguur met twee slangen dat als pauzefiguur fungeert TMnr 2267-176.jpg|thumb|right|a Javanese gunungan with closed porch and two large yakshas on the sides. The roots of the tree rise into the water. There are some animals in the tree crown, but the demon head (kala) is missing.]]
A gunungan is generally symmetrical, shaped like a mountain or like rounded ellipse in the case of Balinese kayonan. The Javanese gunungan takes the form of a mountain (which looks almost [[Candi of Indonesia|Candi]]-like). A covered entrance gate generally appears at the center of a Javanese gunungan. The head of [[Kāla (time)|Kala]], a monstrous personification of time, appears on top of the entrance gate. Beyond the entrance gate, a tree grows upward along the central axis, its branches spread across and fills up the gunungan with fine foliage motifs.  

There are variations in the depiction of objects within the gunungan. Sometimes animals are depicted within the branches of the trees e.g. a tiger and a [[banteng]] (Javanese wild cattle) in fighting stance, monkeys or birds. In the case of Balinese kayonan, animals are seldom depicted; instead mythical figures e.g. [[garuda]], [[Nāga|naga]], or underworld spirits [[yaksha]] are depicted to represent the three-world division concept of Balinese Hinduism. The tree behind would represent the bridge between these three worlds. Other monstrous figure that may appear in the Balinese kayonan is the ''karang bintulu'', a one-eyed monstrous head. The overall composition is generally is kept symmetrical, however sometimes there are some exceptions especially in the Balinese and Lombok gunungan where the shape can be assymmetrical.

In Balinese wayang kulit performance, only the kayonan can show a frontal representation of a figure. The frontal representation of figures in a kayonan are reserved for the highest deity. One example is Ganesha depicted in a Balinese kayonan.

==Gunungan in wayang kulit==
[[File:Wayang_performance,_Yogyakarta_1141.jpg|thumb|right|The gunungan in this wayang performance in [[Yogyakarta]] served as props.]]
In a wayang performance, a gunungan normally marks the beginning, the end, and pauses between important scenic transitions. This is generally marked by placing the gunungan at the center of the screen. A gunungan may also serves as prop for background mountains, rock, obstacles, waves of a lake, or cloud. If turned to a red backside, the gunungan symbolizes fire or flames. If placed obliquely, the gunungan indicates a break. In the traditional performance of a wayang kulit, the dalang would follow the course of the time to indicate the timing of the performance, before midnight the gunungan is placed to the dalang's left side, while after midnight, the gunungan is placed on his right. In the island of [[Lombok]] where there are two gunungans, the gunungans are moved from the edge to the center to indicate change of scene.

===Java===
In Jave, before a wayang kulit performance, the dalang first gives offering (''sajen'') in the form of food to soothe the demons. After the foreplay of the [[gamelan]], the dalang pray to the spirit world and sits in his place. The dalang's two assistants have already sits to his side with the puppets already arranged at the edges of the screen: benevolent figures e.g. the gods and heroes are seated on the right side of the dalang, while the demons sit on his left. The dalang then place the gunungan in the center of the screen and knocks the figure's crest five times, symbolically waking up the spirit of the puppets. Then he takes the gunungan, turns in three times on the screen, and puts it on the right edge of the gedebog (banana trunk base). After this ritual, the actual play can begin. The play finished after the last planting of the gunungan.{{sfn|Spitzing|1981|p=150}} 

===Bali===
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Wajangfiguur van leer TMnr 3812-5.jpg|thumb|right|The figure of Api ("fire"), a Balinese fire demon, which has a similar form with the kayonan.]]
In the beginning of a Balinese wayang performance, especially those in the southern region of Bali, the dalang would give offerings while saying a sacred verse (mantra). Then he would hit the crate of the puppets three times while asking the Wind God [[Vayu]] to take a strong part in the performance. Then he lifts the lid of the crate and places it on the right side. He takes the kayonan from the crate and moves it slightly over the screen and sticks it in the middle. Next, the dalang attaches the great figure of Siwamurti (angry aspect of [[Shiva]]) on the right side (the healing side) and similar the great figure of Wisnumurti (angry aspect of [[Vishnu]]) on the left side (the incurable side). The character of the puppets, benevolent or malevolent, will be placed accordingly to either side of the kayonan with faces turned away from the kayonan. When the characters have shown their presence, they disappear from the screen and are piled on the sides. The remaining kayonan is performing an ever-faster dance to lure the gods and demons, so that they may take possession of the puppet figures. The dalang murmurs further mantras and finally positioned the kayonan on the right side.{{sfn|Spitzing|1981|pp=52-5}}  

Before starting the performance, the dalang places the figures on the lid of the crate and others are handed over to his two assistants.{{sfn|Spitzing|1981|pp=52-5}} 

When the performance comes to an end, the kayonan reappears. If the dalang is also a priest (Dalang Mangku), he would use holy water (tirtha) to sprinkle holy water (tirtha) onto the puppet figures to purify them from evil influence. During the ritual, the dalang would place the figure of [[Acintya|Cintya]] behind the kayonan, the supreme figure in [[Balinese Hinduism]].{{sfn|Spitzing|1981|pp=52-5}}

Another figure with similar shape to the kayonan is called ''api'' ("fire"). The api has the shape of tapered leaf with a frightening face in the lower part, from which symmetrical radiating lines go upwards. In Balinese wayang kulit performance, the opposite of the kayonan is probably the pohon kepuh ("tree of hell"). The pohon kepuh is an asymmetrical, misshapen, tree-like structure with a witch sitting in the summit. It serves as a prop of a graveyard with open graves, which, together with magical evil spirits and skulls, are recognizable next to the tree trunk. The pohon kepuh figure is found only in the south of Bali and is used to represent the mount of King [[Kaurava|Korawa]] from the [[Mahabharata]].{{sfn|Spitzing|1981|pp=94}}

===Lombok===
[[File:ZP_05_Gunungan_00.jpg|thumb|right|A gunungan from a variation of wayang kulit of Lombok, with which the story of [[Serat Menak Sasak]] is told.]]
In the predominantly Muslim island of Lombok, the wayang kulit of [[Sasak people]], the inhabitant of Lombok Island, has its own narrative tradition. The story of the wayang Sasak centered on the chronicle of [[Hamzanama]], which features the adventure of [[Amir Hamza]], an uncle of the Prophet [[Muhammad]]. The chronicle of Hamzanama is known as [[Serat Menak Sasak]] in Lombok. The stories are musically accompanied by the gamelan wayang Sasak. The art of gamelan wayang Sasak flourished since the 16th-century, however the strict Islamic reform movement in the last decades of the 20th-century had pressurized the wayang Sasak and other traditional art.{{sfn|Harnish|2003|p=92}}

The wayang kulit Sasak utilized two gunungans, which correspond approximately to the Balinese figure, but end up in a tip like in Java. The Sasak variation of the Gunungan depicts the world tree which consists of two juxtaposed snakes, whose rear ends protrude upwards and represent the starting points for the branches, while the heads below look symmetrically in an arc on either side. Sometimes heads of demons can be seen between the branches of the world tree. The two gunungan, which also occur in the [[wayang golek]] performance of the Serat Menak Sasak, are due to the Islamic conception that the world strictly falls into the world of the good guided by God and the world of evil guided by the [[Satan|Shaytan]].{{sfn|Spitzing|1981|p=205f}}

The dalang first puts the figures on the outermost edges of the screen in a row in the banana trunk following the Islamic beliefs: the believer to his right, the disbeliever to his left. Then on the left, the dalang places the first gunungan slightly oblique. In the middle of the screen he marks the start of the performance with a dwarf-like joker figure called ''Lurah Sabatan'', who wears an over-sized [[kris]] in his belt. A second joker figure is added shortly before both disappear. At this time, the dalang would place the second gunungan danced over the screen with two other figures hidden behind him. A dancing gunungan is always musically accompanied by a [[suling]] (bamboo flute). The dancing gunungan then comes to rest in the center of the screen, the two figures then become visible from the gunungan and give their names as [[Amir Hamza]], the protagonist of the Serat Menak, and Putri Muninggar, his favorite wife. This group of three will remain on the screen for a while, until the noble couple disappear and the gunungan is planted to the right side of the dalang on the edge. The screen remains framed by both gunungan during the course of the performance.{{sfn|Spitzing|1981|p=185f}}

Sometimes there is only one gunungan. The gamelan orchestra, consisting of the bamboo flute suling, the drum [[kendang]], a gong and other [[metallophone]]s, plays three times at the beginning the opening piece known as ''Rangsang'' ("provocative", "exciting"). After the opening piece, the dalang ignites the ''labakan'' (oil lamp). The oil lamp symbolically represents the sun, while the music represents the element of fire, air, and water. The dalang wakes up the puppet figures by lifting the lid of the crate. The first figure placed in the middle is the gunungan, then the figure of Amir Hamza (also called Jayengrana) and Muninggar are placed on both sides of the gunungan, almost like an image of Adam, Eve, and the World Tree. After the dalang finished spoking a few religious formula, he lets all three figures disappear into the air while the orchestra plays a piece known as ''Janggal'' ("leave"). This whole act symbolizes the divine act of World's Creation. After some general preliminary remarks, the dalang reintroduces the gunungan into the center of the screen and describes the subsequent play.{{sfn|Harnish|2003|pp=105-7}} 

==Gunungan in wayang beber==
[[File:Wayang_Beber_Opened.jpg|thumb|right|A wayang beber at the Mangkunegaran Palace in Surakarta. Typical combat scene, gunungan slightly to the right of the center.]]
Wayang beber is a form of [[cantastoria|illustrated wayang drama]] which use illustrated scroll to tell a narrative story. The art was thought to be extinct in the 20th-century, only to be rediscovered in the 1960s in two Javanese villages of Gelaran and Gedompol. The scroll used in a wayang beber is more than two meters long and 70 centimeter high. The scroll is set on two vertically erected bars so that four scenes can be seen one by one for the viewers sitting on the ground. 

Gunungan also appears in wayang beber. The gunungan is variously depicted: in the village of Gelaran, the gunungan appears more tree-like, while in the village of Gedompol, it is more stylized. The root of a gunungan tree is depicted with water-like pattern. Sometimes [[aerial root]] appears in a gunungan tree, providing additional support to the tree. The roofed porch of a candi entrance is usually framed by wings and is closed by a door. A gunungan can be obscured by other motifs or cut off from the outer edge. Leaves, flowers, and sometimes fruits can be seen in the gunungan. A demon head sometimes appear in the gunungan, mostly similar with the Bali style, which is with one eye (karang bintulu), and rarely with two eyes ([[Batara Kala]]).{{sfn|Kant-Achilles|Seltmann|Schumacher|1990|pp=34-40}}

''High Above'' tells the story of SES, and how brave pioneers managed to overcome technical, political and commercial obstacles to become the world's leading satellite operator. It is the story of the Luxembourg-based satellite provider and the growth of European [[satellite TV]], the history of recent developments of the European TV and media industry, and their context in the wider development of TV and space technology.

The story of ''High Above'' is of interest to anyone who watches TV. It covers a period that has seen the emergence of television as the dominant information and entertainment medium. The account shows how Astra was a main driver of European TV development, without which we would not have the necessary base ingredients to make the great leap forward into [[digital TV]], [[HDTV]], [[3D television]], and future revolutionary prospects for home entertainment.

But the story of satellite TV is more than a story of rockets and technology; it is the story of the birth of a whole array of new industries and the creation of hundreds of thousands of jobs. ''High Above'' is also a reflection of politics, 20th Century history, the [[Cold War]] and the collapse of Communism, the creation of Europe, economic growth and wealth, big brands, the Internet age and of technological convergence.&lt;ref&gt;SES ASTRA  [http://www.ses-astra.com/resources/pdf/en-shared/press/0-high-above-book-summary.pdf ''HIGH ABOVE''] (April, 2010). Executive Summary&lt;/ref&gt;

Space journalist, Gerhard Kowalski described ''High Above'' as “not only a eulogy to the TV pioneer … also a fact-rich and fascinating history of satellite television in general”&lt;ref&gt; Kowalski, G. [http://www.gerhardkowalski.com/?p=1366 "High Above – Buch von Chris Forrester zeichnet Erfolgsgeschichte von SES ASTRA nach"] ''www.gerhardkowalski.com'' (May 18, 2010) [[German language|German]]) “Das sehr aufwändig gestaltete Werk ist aber nicht nur eine Eloge auf den TV-Pionier… Es ist zugleich eine faktenreiche und spannende Chronik des Satellitenfernsehens überhaupt”&lt;/ref&gt; while consumer technology website Tech Radar said the book “delivers a fascinating reminder of television’s early days as well as the technology behind the development of satellite TV”.&lt;ref&gt; Lane, Alex. [http://wotsat.techradar.com/news/ses-astra-full-25-year-story-now-available-read-more-ses-astra-full-25-year-story-now-available "SES Astra: the full, 25-year story now available"] ''www.techradar.com'' (June 6, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
Using a series of interviews with key figures from the European satellite TV industry, as well as straightforward story-telling, ''High Above'' tells the inside account of how the tiny country of [[Luxembourg]] produced the company that established and then led the DTH satellite industry in Europe. With the commercial, technical and regulatory hurdles to overcome, it was a rough ride, both for Astra and for the broadcasters that now dominate the industry ([[BSkyB]], [[Canal Plus]], Premiere - now [[Sky Deutschland]], etc.) – and the whole tale is told, the defeats as well as the victories. 

The book also chronicles the development of television itself and of satellites, with the early experiments and the story of rocketry from the first trials of [[Robert Goddard]], through [[Wernher Von Braun]]’s [[V-2]] to the US and Soviet space programmes, and the European [[Ariane (rocket family)|Ariane]] launchers that have carried many of the Astra satellites into orbit.

''High Above'' explains the technology behind, and within, satellite television: why satellites are used for TV broadcasting, how the [[geostationary orbit]] makes it work, how the tiny signals are received and decoded by domestic equipment, and how [[digital TV]] gives a choice of thousands of channels to every home.

==Authors==

'''Japanese cyberpunk''' refers a genre of [[underground film]] produced in [[Japan]] starting in the 1980s. It bears some resemblance to the high-tech and scientific [[cyberpunk]] as understood in the West, however differs in its representation of industrial and metallic imagery and an incomprehensible narrative. The origins of the genre can be traced back to the 1982 film ''[[Burst City]]'', before the genre was primarily defined by the 1989 film ''[[Tetsuo: The Iron Man]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cyberpunkreview.com/japanese-cyberpunk/&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese cyberpunk also refers to a subgenre of [[manga]] and [[anime]] works with cyberpunk themes. This subgenre began in 1982 with the debut of the [[manga]] series ''[[Akira (manga)|Akira]]'', with its [[Akira (1988 film)|1988 anime film adaptation]] later popularizing the subgenre. ''Akira'' inspired a wave of Japanese cyberpunk works, including manga and [[anime]] series such as ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'', ''[[Battle Angel Alita]]'', ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'', and ''[[Serial Experiments Lain]]''.&lt;ref name="polygon"/&gt; Cyberpunk anime and manga have been influential on global [[popular culture]], inspiring numerous works in animation, comics, film, music, television and video games.&lt;ref name="vice"/&gt;&lt;ref name="filmschoolrejects"/&gt;

==Japanese cyberpunk films==
===Style===
Japanese Cyberpunk generally involves the characters, especially the protagonist, going through monstrous, incomprehensible [[Metamorphosis|metamorphoses]] in an industrial setting. Many of these films have scenes that fall into the [[experimental film]] genre; they often involve purely abstract or visual sequences that may or may not relate to the characters and plot. Recurring themes include: mutation, technology, dehumanization, repression and sexual deviance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Player|first=Mark|title=Post-Human Nightmares: The World of Japanese Cyberpunk Cinema|url=http://www.midnighteye.com/features/post-human-nightmares-the-world-of-japanese-cyberpunk-cinema.shtml|publisher=Midnight Eye}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Precursors===
''[[Burst City]]'', since its release in 1982, has had a strong effect on the underground Japanese film scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://twitchfilm.net/archives/007344.html|title=Burst City / Electric Dragon 80000V Review|author=Todd Brown|work=TwitchFilm}}&lt;/ref&gt; This starred [[Shigeru Izumiya]], who would, four years later, go on to direct his own Cyberpunk film, ''[[Death Powder]]'', in 1986. ''The Phantom of Regular Size'' was ''[[Tetsuo: The Iron Man]]'''s precursor, a 1986 short by [[Shinya Tsukamoto]]. He himself expanded this a feature-length film three years later, in 1989.

===Core films===
Some defining films in the genre include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fright.com/edge/japanhorror.html|title=JAPANESE CYBER-HORROR|work=fright.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Death Powder]]'' (1986)

==Cyberpunk manga and anime==
Japanese cyberpunk also refers to a subgenre of [[manga]] and [[anime]] works with cyberpunk themes. This subgenre began in 1982 with the debut of the [[manga]] series ''[[Akira (manga)|Akira]]'', with its [[Akira (1988 film)|1988 anime film adaptation]] later popularizing the subgenre. ''Akira'' inspired a wave of Japanese cyberpunk works, including manga and [[anime]] series such as ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'', ''[[Battle Angel Alita]]'', ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'', and ''[[Serial Experiments Lain]]''.&lt;ref name="polygon"&gt;{{cite news |title=What is cyberpunk? |url=https://www.polygon.com/features/2018/8/30/17796680/cyberpunk-2077-history-blade-runner-neuromancer |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |date=August 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyberpunk themes are widely visible in [[anime]] and [[manga]]. In [[Japan]], where [[cosplay]] is popular and not only teenagers display such fashion styles, cyberpunk has been accepted and its influence is widespread. [[William Gibson]]'s ''[[Neuromancer]],'' whose influence dominated the early cyberpunk movement, was also set in [[Chiba Prefecture|Chiba]], one of Japan's largest industrial areas.

Cyberpunk anime and manga draw upon a futuristic vision which has elements in common with western science fiction and therefore have received wide international acceptance outside Japan. "The conceptualization involved in cyberpunk is more of forging ahead, looking at the new global culture. It is a culture that does not exist right now, so the Japanese concept of a cyberpunk future, seems just as valid as a Western one, especially as Western cyberpunk often incorporates many Japanese elements."&lt;ref&gt;Ruh, Brian (2000), "[http://www.animeresearch.com/Articles/LiberatingCels Liberating Cels: Forms of the Female in Japanese Cyberpunk Animation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927232446/http://www.animeresearch.com/Articles/LiberatingCels/ |date=2007-09-27 }}." AnimeResearch.com December 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; William Gibson is now a frequent visitor to Japan, and he came to see that many of his visions of Japan have become a reality:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Modern Japan simply was cyberpunk. The [[Japanese people|Japanese]] themselves knew it and delighted in it. I remember my first glimpse of [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]], when one of the young [[Tokyo]] journalists who had taken me there, his face drenched with the light of a thousand media-suns—all that towering, animated crawl of commercial information—said, "You see? You see? It is ''Blade Runner'' town." And it was. It so evidently was.&lt;ref name="cyberpunk1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1956774,00.html|title=The Future Perfect|first=William|last=Gibson|date=30 April 2001|publisher=Time International}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''John Yorke AtLee''' was a pioneer recording artist in the 1890s in the United States. He was born in [[Washington, D.C.]] on March 22, 1853. He was working as a government clerk in Washington D.C. when the Columbia Phonograph Company was incorporated in January 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brooks|first1=Tim|title=A Directory to Columbia Recording Artists of the 1890s|journal=ARSC Journal|date=1979|volume=11|issue=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; AtLee was one of Columbia's star artists of the early 1890s, second only to the U.S. Marine Band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=1891|title=Music by the United States Marine Band (Advertisement)|url=https://archive.org/details/Phonogram1_4|journal=The Phonogram|volume=1|issue=4|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|ref=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the Columbia Phonograph Company's early adoption of musical recording, AtLee was one of the first popular recording musicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brooks|first1=Tim|title=Columbia Corporate History: Introduction|url=http://adp.library.ucsb.edu/index.php/resources/detail/97|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Laurence Olivier Awards''', or simply the '''Olivier Awards''', are presented annually by the [[Society of London Theatre]] to recognise excellence in professional theatre in [[London]] at an annual ceremony in the capital. The awards were originally known as the '''Society of West End Theatre Awards''', but they were renamed in honour of the British actor [[Laurence Olivier]] in 1984.

The awards are given to individuals involved in [[West End theatre|West End]] productions and other leading [[West End theatre#London's non-commercial theatres|non-commercial theatres]] based in London across a range of categories covering plays, musicals, dance, opera and affiliate theatre. A discretionary non-competitive Special Olivier Award is also given each year. The Olivier Awards are recognised internationally as the highest honour in British theatre, equivalent to the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] Awards for film and television, and the [[Brit Awards|BRIT Awards]] for music. The Olivier Awards are considered equivalent to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]'s [[Tony Award]]s and [[France]]'s [[Molière Award]].

Since its inception, the awards have been held at various venues and theatres across London, from 2012-2016 at the [[Royal Opera House]], before moving to the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in 2017. Television coverage is broadcast in prime time on ITV, who acquired the rights from 2013 onwards with radio coverage by Magic Radio.

==History==
The awards were first established in 1976 by the Society of London Theatre as the Society of West End Awards and were designed by artist Tom Merrifield. In 1984, British actor [[Laurence Olivier]] gave his consent for the awards to be renamed in his honour and they became known as the Laurence Olivier Awards.&lt;ref&gt;[https://officiallondontheatre.com/news/10-things-probably-didnt-know-olivier-awards/ "10 Things You Probably Didn't Know About The Olivier Awards"]. OfficialLondonTheatre.com, accessed 30 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1976 Laurence Olivier Awards|first awards ceremony]] was held in December 1976 at [[Hotel Café Royal|Café Royal]].

==Judging==
Each year, the Olivier Award winners are decided by a group of distinguished industry professionals, theatre luminaries and members of the public speciﬁcally chosen for their passion for London theatre.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://officiallondontheatre.com/olivier-awards/choosing-the-winners/|title=How the Olivier Award winners are chosen - Olivier Awards|last=|first=|date=|work=Official London Theatre|access-date=2018-03-07|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lively and intense debates are conducted by four panels – theatre, opera, dance and afﬁliates – each overseen by the [[Society of London Theatre|Society of London Theatre (SOLT)]]. The professional panellists are chosen for their knowledge in the selected ﬁeld and each panel is made up of various members including journalists, casting directors, arts administrators and publishers. Each person is chosen by the Chief Executive of SOLT following advice from the SOLT Awards Office and external advisors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For Affiliates, Dance and Opera, panellists select the shows they consider most worthy of an Olivier Award (to create the nominations in the relevant categories) and vote on a winner at the end of the judging period.

For the Theatre awards, the process happens in two stages. Firstly, a long list is compiled by the Theatre panel, which indicates productions or individuals in a category which the panel deem worthy of particular attention. This long list is then submitted to SOLT members to vote upon; members may still vote outside of this list at this stage, except for in the four Supporting Actor/Actress categories (as these each contain thousands of eligible performers). The members’ votes are collated with those of the panellists to create the list of nominees.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the second stage, the overall shortlist of nominees is voted on by both members and panellists to produce the winners.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''Margo the Mouse''''' ({{lang-pl|'''Przygody Myszki'''}}) is a Polish [[animated series]] created and directed by Eugeniusz Kotowski. The animated series was made between 1976 and 1983, and was produced by Otokar Balcy.

''Margo the Mouse'' stars a little Mouse called Margo (Myszka in the original Polish version) who lives in a big tree with her neighbours, a squirrel and a mole. It aired as part of the container TV animated series [[TVP Polonia]].

==Description==

It is the story and adventures of Margo, a little mouse who lives in a large tree made chalet. Small Margo has as neighbors Eliana, a squirrel who lives on the top floor; and Dennis, a dormouse that lives in the basement.

However, all is not happiness for Margo. The little mouse must deal with some enemies. One day, Eliana goes to visit her mother because she is sick and Margo must look after the house. Then, at night, a sullen owl settles in Eliana's house illegally. So Margo seek ways to take the owl out of the house of her friend.

On another occasion, Margo prevents a beggar rat from occupying her home without her permission. Like while hiking should avoid being eaten by a stork. Although Margo has good friends like Anna, a sparrow; or Christophe, a cricket who likes to play the violin.

With her friends, Margo lives many adventures.

'''''Need for Speed: Carbon''''' is a 2006 [[racing game|racing]] video game developed for several platforms by [[Electronic Arts]], [[Rovio Entertainment|Rovio Mobile]] and [[Exient Entertainment]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.exient.com/games/|title=Games {{!}} Exient|website=www.exient.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is published by [[Electronic Arts]]. It is the tenth installment in the ''[[Need for Speed]]'' series and a sequel to ''[[Need for Speed: Most Wanted (2005 video game)|Need for Speed: Most Wanted]]''. It was followed by ''[[Need for Speed: ProStreet|Need for Speed: Prostreet]]'' in the following year.

The [[PlayStation Portable]], [[Nintendo DS]] and [[Game Boy Advance]] versions of the game are called '''''Need for Speed: Carbon – Own the City''''', set in a fictional city named Coast City with a significantly different storyline and also featuring different AI teammate abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.psp.ign.com/articles/743/743342p1.html|title=Need for Speed Carbon: Own the City Review|accessdate=2008-06-24|work=[[IGN]]|date=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, a version of ''Own the City'' was also released on the [[Zeebo]] as a [[pre-installed]] game.&lt;ref name="gamasutra"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=23776|title=Zeebo Officially Launches In Brazil With FIFA, Need For Speed, Brain Challenge|first=Leigh|last=Alexander|publisher=Think Services|date=2009-05-27|accessdate=2010-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
The gameplay of ''Need for Speed: Carbon'' is similar to its predecessors, ''[[Need for Speed: Most Wanted (2005 video game)|Need for Speed: Most Wanted]]'' and ''[[Need for Speed: Underground 2|Underground 2]]'', but based upon rival [[street racing]] crews instead of individuals. Players run a crew and can hire specific street racers to be in their crew and the active friendly racer is known as a wingman. Each employable street racer has two skills, a racing skill (scout, blocker, and drafter) and a non-race skill (fixer, mechanic, and fabricator). Each skill has different properties from finding hidden alleys/back streets (shortcuts) to reducing police attention. Cars driven by the wingmen are also different; blockers drive muscle, drafters drive exotics and scouts drive tuners (although the first two unlockable wingmen (Neville and Sal) drive cars according to the player's chosen car class at the start of the game). Car classes are Tuners, Muscle, and Exotics, and are associated with their own borough and Boss (Tuners/Downtown/Kenji, Exotics/Fortuna/Wolf, and Muscle/Kempton/Angie).

Players must choose a class when starting Career Mode, which will be permanent throughout the career. Each choice starts in a different district, with corresponding initial car choices and unlocks as the game progresses (there is a test drive option at the beginning). Players may ultimately choose from any class of car, and can also unlock cars that are reserved for Quick Races as they earn Reward Cards.

In Career Mode, races cannot be redone for the same purse; if won, the purse is only $500. It is necessary for players to plan carefully which cars they will buy and upgrade, to avoid running out of money. There are phone calls, texts and emails to go along with the storyline. Winning races causes new races to show up on the map. All gameplay takes place at night. As in ''Most Wanted'' the player can use Nitrous Oxide and Speedbreaker, which accumulate simply from driving, not from specific skill use to earn them.

Gameplay control methods vary from console to console. In [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] versions, control steering through the control pad, while acceleration, braking and other controls can be configured and mapped to the different buttons on the controllers. The Driving Force GT and G27 racing wheels can be used, and this is the first ''Need for Speed'' title to implement force-feedback and the 900 degree turning radius. In [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] version, joysticks and wheel controllers are supported, as well as those that support [[Haptic technology#Games|force feedback]]. [[Wii]] version lacks online play, but fully supports the use of the [[Wii Remote]].

''Carbon'' was the first ''Need for Speed'' title to feature online exclusive game modes.  Players can upload in-game screenshots to the ''Need for Speed'' website, complete with stats and modifications. The Pursuit Knockout and Pursuit Tag game modes are modes that allow the player to play as either a racer or a cop. Pursuit Knockout is essentially a lap knockout with a twist. The racers that are knocked out of the race come back as cops and it's their job to try to stop the other racers from finishing the race through any means necessary. The player that finishes the race wins. Pursuit Tag begins with one player as a racer and the rest of the players as cops. It is the cops' job to arrest the racer. The cop that makes the arrest then turns into a racer and has to try to avoid the cops. The player who spends the most time as a racer wins.

===Race modes===
Unlike ''Need for Speed: Most Wanted'' and ''Underground'', ''Carbon'' has no drag racing. However, ''Carbon'' features the return of [[Drifting (motorsport)|drift]] racing, a mode that had been included in two previous installments ''[[Need for Speed: Underground]]'' and ''Underground 2'', but omitted from ''Carbon''{{'}}s predecessor, ''[[Need for Speed: Most Wanted (2005 video game)|Most Wanted]]''. Other familiar race forms return, such as Sprint, Circuit, and "Tollbooth" (renamed "Checkpoint"). There are no Street X or Knockout races, and winning Outruns (renamed "Rival Crew Challenges") is not necessary to complete the game as it was in ''Underground 2''.

Most of ''Carbon''{{'s}} focus lies through various Canyon Events, based on Japanese [[Tōge|Touge]] races. There are four types of Canyon Events: Canyon Duel, Canyon Sprint, Canyon Checkpoint and Canyon Drift. Canyon Duels have two stages: In the first stage, the player chases the rival and accumulates points faster the closer they stick to the opponent. In the second stage, the roles are reversed and the player's points decline faster the closer the opponent is. If anyone falls behind or is overtaken and passed, without regaining the distance, after ten seconds they lose. Players can also lose by going off the cliff edge. Some races have destructible, lit-up guardrails players must be careful not to crash through, and some have solid walls. The Canyon Drift and Canyon Duel are similar to the 2006 film ''[[The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift]]''.

In Career mode, players have to win races throughout the city to conquer territories, and then face off against bosses to conquer the first three boroughs. To challenge Darius (Boss of the fourth borough) and win the game, players must defeat the three Bosses in two final races and defeat Darius in a Circuit race and a Canyon Duel. Throughout the game, as the player accumulates territories, the minor crews (Black Hearts and Kings, who drive exotics, Inferno and Los Colibres, who drive muscles, and Rotor 4 and Scorpios, who drive tuners), might attack the player's owned races/territories. The player can then either accept the challenge, and keep the race if they win it, or decline, in which case, the minor crew will automatically retake the race, and the territory if too many races are lost.

''Carbon'' also features Quick Races modes (including 2 players) and Reward Cards, in which card pieces are won by achievements in and out of Career Mode. Once a card is fully won, new cars, parts, or other features are unlocked. The Challenge Series is a set of 36 events (12 categories with 3 difficulty levels). Finishing a Challenge category also unlocks features.

===Pursuits===
As with ''Most Wanted'', police is a key mechanic in ''Carbon''. Police chases can break out at any time, including when in Free Roam mode, when racing, or just after a race is completed. The background music and most of the radio dialogue is the same as in ''Most Wanted''. Canyon Races and Checkpoint Races have no risk of police pursuit. As with ''Most Wanted'', there are 5 conditions/heat levels and players should be careful to avoid getting pursued by state or federal authorities. The Collector's Edition features three additional heat levels.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

Although the pursuit system is similar to ''Most Wanted'', this feature has been reprogrammed in ''Carbon'' to ensure that police are not too dominant in arrest tactics in high pursuit levels. Unlike in ''Most Wanted'', it is possible to evade the police after running over a spike strip by using nitrous. At the same time, some of the police tactics (such as the spike strips) are used in ways that make pursuits much harder to escape, and the police cars are much harder to disable. Using Pursuit Breakers no longer guarantees the blockage/destruction of every pursuing vehicle. However, police can be seen patrolling the map and won't engage in a pursuit—unless the players have a warrant (evaded a previous pursuit) or committed an offence in sight of the police.

===Customization features===
[[File:NFSCarbonAudiLeMansQuattro&amp;LamborghiniLP640.jpg|left|thumb|200px|A heavily modified [[Audi Le Mans Quattro]] is compared to a stock [[Lamborghini Murciélago|Lamborghini Murciélago LP640]], showing the "Autosculpt" feature of the game.]]
''Need for Speed: Carbon'' features a new car customization option called "Autosculpt", enabling players to utilize aftermarket car parts and shape/mold the parts to their liking. Players can also have multiple customized vinyls as well, which can be moved, resized, or skewed, which offers unlimited design possibilities, The layering system of vinyls returns after having absence in ''Most Wanted''. Autosculpt was also used in Need For Speed: Prostreet, though it played a large role in aerodynamic capabilities of the car.

Performance tuning has been redone so that players, as upgrades are purchased, can tune the car for a number of different properties, such as higher top speed or higher acceleration. Unlike ''Most Wanted'', all of ''Carbon''{{'s}} performance tuning/enhancing and car customizing is done inside the Safe House. A new "optimize" feature has been added for players who just want the best options without spending too much time tuning and configuring.

Players can choose from many licensed cars divided into three classes as follows: Tuners, Muscles, and Exotics. Each car has its own characteristic ranging from easy cornering to well-balanced road performance. For example, Tuners are good in handling and tight corners, Exotics have high top speeds, and Muscles can accelerate fast in a short amount of time. In Career Mode, players must choose a class at the beginning, but are ultimately free to purchase and/or use any vehicle throughout the career.

===''Own the City''===
For portables, the ''Own the City'' version has many differences. There are new game modes, like Escape where the player must escape from a rival crew's territory, Delivery where the players and their crew have to deliver a package to a designated area in first place to win, and Crew Takedown, where players have to eliminate a set number of rival racers to win. Crew management allows hiring of up to 5 wingmen per crew, with 2 active for racing. Players can use the crews for all races except for Lap Knockout, Escape and Crew Takedown modes. The city is also divided into many areas, some together into a district owned by one crew, with a total of 6 districts and 13 areas. Every area conquered gives new unlocks and new wingmen. Wingmen also have three different classes; a brawler that takes down racers, a drafter that drafts racers to give speed boosts, and assassins that deliver spike strips the player needs to avoid that can blow a car's tires, aimed for enemy cars. ''Own the City'' also allows free roaming with crates scattered throughout the whole city that when broken, give special unlocks ranging from cash to game art. Police chases are only available in free roam, and are not available in races.

==Setting==
The game is set in the fictional city of Palmont (with the exception of NFS: Own The City.). There are three major canyons in Palmont: East, West, and Carbon Canyon. The southwestern border of the city features a sea coast. The city also includes several rivers and a lake near Carbon Canyon. It resembles very much to ''Most Wanted''. Palmont is divided into four boroughs at the beginning of the game: Kempton (southwest industrial area), Downtown (east metropolitan area), Fortuna (west residential area) and Silverton (north casino &amp; resort area) ; one for each of the major crews. A highway system extending through the middle of the city is the main connection between the boroughs. All boroughs except Silverton are initially accessible to the player; access to Silverton is unlocked only after beating the crews in the other three boroughs. There is an additional hidden area named San Juan, but similar to the canyons, it's not connected to the boroughs of Palmont. Palmont is also featured in the [[massively multiplayer online racing game]] ''[[Need for Speed: World]]'', along with Rockport of ''Most Wanted''.

==Plot==

===''Need for Speed: Carbon''===
After escaping from the authorities in [[Need for Speed: Most Wanted (2005 video game)|Rockport]], the player drives in a [[BMW M3#E46 M3|BMW M3 GTR]] on a canyon route to Palmont City. A flashback of what seems to be a race against Kenji, Angie, and Wolf comes to the player's mind. A police incident at the end of the race forces the player to make a hasty escape from Palmont with Darius's Toyota Supra, leaving Wolf, Angie, Kenji, Nikki and many bystanders arrested by the Palmont SWAT units. In the present day, the player is nearing the city limits of Palmont, when is rammed from behind by a driver in a [[Chevrolet Corvette (C6)#Z06|2006 Chevrolet Corvette Z06]]. The driver turns out to be former Rockport Police Sergeant Nathan Cross (played by Dean McKenzie), now a [[bounty hunter]]. After a high-speed chase down the canyon, they both run into a construction zone, where Cross then corners the player who has just totaled their car. Shortly before an irate Cross can arrest the player (who is still upset about the incident in Rockport City), Darius (played by [[Tahmoh Penikett]]) and his crew arrive. Darius pays off Cross, and the player meets up with Nikki (played by [[Emmanuelle Vaugier]]), a former girlfriend, who is apparently outraged about the player's return.

Darius tells the player to regain control of the different territories in Palmont. Winning races one by one, the player acquires territories and ultimately districts from the major crews, before beating the bosses of those crews. The 3 major bosses are:
* Kenji (Bushido) - controls Downtown
* Angie (21st Street; played by Danielle Kremeniuk) - controls Kempton
* Wolf (T.F.K.) - controls Fortuna
There are various other smaller crews, such as 4Rotor (who use [[Mazda]]s with [[Wankel engine|rotary engines]]), Black Hearts, and Los Colibres (The Hummingbirds). After beating each crew boss, the player meets up with a former member of that boss's crew: Yumi (Bushido; played by [[Melody Miyuki Ishikawa]]), Samson (21st Street) and Colin (T.F.K.), who want to join the player's crew and reveal their observations regarding the night the player took off from Palmont.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Need for Speed: Carbon|developer=[[Electronic Arts]]|publisher=Electronic Arts|date=2006|platform=[[PlayStation 2]]|quote=Need For Speed Carbon - various cutscenes after unlocking Sal, Colin of TFK, Yumi of Bushido, and Samson of 21st Street.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After gaining control of all three districts, Darius asks the player to meet up with him. He reveals that he was just using the player all along to get more territory, and that he has brought Cross along to arrest the player. Darius leaves the player at the mercy of Cross, but the player is saved by the arrival of Nikki (who made a secret deal with Cross), who tells him that she now realizes everything that happened months ago after piecing together her view of the night and the viewpoints of the other racers, revealing that Darius was the one who tipped off the police, switched the money bag and let the player escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Need for Speed: Carbon|developer=[[Electronic Arts]]|publisher=Electronic Arts|date=2006|platform=[[PlayStation 2]]|quote=Need For Speed Carbon cutscene after beating the last crew.}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Darius finds out that Nikki is working with the player, he hires the three previous bosses (Kenji, Angie, and Wolf) into his new crew, Stacked Deck. The player then attempts to conquer Silverton, and oust Darius and his Stacked Deck crew, to exact revenge for Darius' actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Need for Speed: Carbon|developer=[[Electronic Arts]]|publisher=Electronic Arts|date=2006|platform=[[PlayStation 2]]|quote=Need For Speed Carbon Cutscene after unlocking Nikki.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The player begins to win races against the Stacked Deck, and gets his chance to beat Darius for control of Palmont and to accord justice. After finally defeating Darius, Darius surrenders his [[Audi Le Mans Quattro]] to the player. Before he leaves the city, Darius tells the player to ''"...enjoy it while it lasts. There's always someone out there who's a little faster than you are...and sooner or later they're going to catch up."''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Need for Speed: Carbon|developer=[[Electronic Arts]]|publisher=Electronic Arts|platform=[[PlayStation 2]]|date=2006|quote=Need For Speed Carbon Cutscene after beating Darius.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Need for Speed: Carbon – Own the City''===
In this version of the game, The player has flashbacks to a race where he, and his brother Mick and a couple of other racers are racing to decide who owns the city. But a terrible car crash ruins the competition - leaving the player in the hospital with amnesia and Mick dead. His death also made the city divide back into different crew territories. Upon waking up, the player is greeted by Mick's girlfriend named Sara, and Carter, Mick's wingman, as they visit Mick's grave and help the player regain his memories.

The player is set to find out who killed Mick, and goes on different races to beat different crews, regain territory and see if they know anything about the accident, where each crew boss then describes what they know about the accident that killed Mick - as well as unlocking more crew members from the respective rival crews. The player soon finds out that the crash was caused by a kid named Buddy, and after a visit to a crew boss called EX - who explains to player where he can find Buddy. However, before EX could finish explaining, Sara is seemingly caught in an explosion. The player is driven further to find out who caused the trouble - and soon confronts Buddy. He then reveals that he was hired, and hands the player his phone. 
The player then continues to complete more races. shortly afterwards, he meets and encounters an undercover police racer named MK, who, after being defeated by the player, then helps him with MK’s police abilities to find out who planned the murder, through Buddy's phone.

It is revealed that EX was the one who planned the crash, and the player goes after him, with MK's police forces in the end apprehending EX after defeated by the player. Sara appears, and tells the racer to race her, which she in the end reveals the truth: the player hired EX to get rid of Mick due to Mick's monstrous personality that hurt Sara and the player, and EX, in turn, hired Buddy to crash Mick's car causing the "accident" resulting in Mick's death. It was all following the player's plan. Sara then hands the player Mick's watch, saying that he is different from Mick, and that she is free together with the player.

==Soundtrack==
By default, [[hip hop music|hip hop]]/[[grime (music)|grime]] songs are played when the player is driving an exotic car, [[electronic music|electronic]] songs are played when the player is driving a tuner car, and [[rock music]] is played when the player is driving a muscle car, though this setting can be turned off. These songs were released by EA in very limited quantities on a special edition disc. The songs played within the safe house and other game menus, as well as a small number of races were composed by London electronic act [[Ekstrak]], and was released widely by EA, and is available from online retailers such as iTunes, as well as hard copies. Other music, most played in major races, such as Race Wars and Canyon Battles have been widely released akin to the Ekstrak release. This actual soundtrack consists of music composed by [[Trevor Morris (musician)|Trevor Morris]], who has gone on to work with [[Steve Jablonsky]] for the 2007 EA [[Real-time strategy|RTS]] game, ''[[Command &amp; Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars]]''.

==Development==
''Need for Speed: Carbon'' was first shown in [[Electronic Arts|EA]]'s montage at [[Nintendo]]'s [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] 2006 conference and booth and was the cover story in the ''[[Game Informer]]'' magazine issue of July 2006. In the early development stages, the graphics had more detail and the city was planned to be bigger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://i.imgur.com/VkGlX1J.png|title = Analysed Version of The "Bigger" City|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also found in the game's files show that many of the game's features were scrapped such as being able to drift with other A.I. players, similar to ''[[Need for Speed: Underground 2|Underground 2]]''. What may appear to be an entire crew called "LeSamurai" was found in the game's files. "LeSamurai" may have taken a huge part in the game's plot as their crew logo is found in many various places in the city. However, the crew logo is not found Downtown. "LeSamurai" may not be the official crew name, but it's the name of some of the contents in one of the game's files. ''Carbon'' is the first in the ''[[Need for Speed]]'' series to be released for [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Wii]] [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|seventh generation]] consoles and  also the final in the series to be released for [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[GameCube]] and [[Game Boy Advance]]. ''Carbon'' features some of cars of its predecessors; namely ''[[Need for Speed: Underground 2]]'' and ''[[Need for Speed: Most Wanted (2005 video game)|Need for Speed: Most Wanted]]'', but also incorporates many new additions including the [[Audi Le Mans quattro]], the [[Chrysler]] [[Chrysler 300#SRT8|300C SRT 8]], [[Chevrolet|Chevrolet's]] [[Chevrolet Chevelle|Chevelle SS]] and the [[Alfa Romeo Brera]]. Carbon features the Canadian actress and model [[Emmanuelle Vaugier]] as Nikki, the player's main source of help and ally in the Career storyline. The game is available for use with [[Mac OS X]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EA &gt; GAMEFINDER &gt; Need for Speed Carbon |url=http://findgames.ea.com/game/needforspeedcarbon |accessdate=2008-12-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220163304/http://findgames.ea.com/game/needforspeedcarbon |archivedate=December 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Need for Speed: Carbon'' debuted at number one on the UK All Format Gaming Chart on its first week of release, beating [[Konami]]'s ''[[Pro Evolution Soccer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Christmas charts take shape|url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/24722/Christmas-charts-take-shape|date=2006-11-13|accessdate=2006-11-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926233635/http://www.mcvuk.com/news/24722/Christmas-charts-take-shape|archive-date=2007-09-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Carbon'' was also the first game in the series to feature detailed character animations for the Windows and seventh-generation releases using [[facial motion capture]], where ingame models of characters such as Neville, Wolf, Angie and Kenji appear in realtime cutscenes taunting or remarking the player in a race or at certain points.&lt;ref name="Orvalho"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Verónica Costa Orvalho, João Orvalho|title=Character Animation: Past, Present and Future|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/98c8/989e11f2456e8692143ef7989cb6fcb9f424.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has however been omitted on the sixth-generation and Wii versions due to platform limitations.

The '''''Need for Speed: Carbon – Collector's Edition''''' features 4 exclusive cars, 10 pre-tuned cars, 6 new races, 3 unique challenge events, 10 unique [[Decal|vinyls]] and a Bonus DVD showing the making of Carbon and showcasing all the cars used in the game. The Collector's Edition also features alternate box art and a metallic-finish sleeve encasing the case of the game. Although the Mac edition doesn't display the Collector's Edition title, it contains all Collector's Edition features. The downloaded version of the game features the Ultimate Performance Kit, 2006 [[Pagani Zonda|Pagani Zonda F]] and the 1971 [[Dodge Challenger]]. An arcade version of the same name was released by EA Arcades in 2008.&lt;ref name="monkey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monkeygamesroom.co.uk/arcade-machines/driving-arcade-machines/need-for-speed-carbon-twin-driving-arcade-machine/prod_568.html|title=Arcade Machines - Driving Arcade Machines - Need For Speed Carbon Twin Driving Arcade Machine|work=Monkey Gamesroom|accessdate=20 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204055047/http://www.monkeygamesroom.co.uk/arcade-machines/driving-arcade-machines/need-for-speed-carbon-twin-driving-arcade-machine/prod_568.html|archive-date=4 February 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arcade"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primetimeamusements.com/arcadegame.php?id=221|title=Need For Speed: Carbon - Standard Model|work=PrimeTime Amusements|accessdate=20 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016001013/http://www.primetimeamusements.com/arcadegame.php?id=221|archive-date=16 October 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Collector's Edition is not available for PS3.

The '''PaPeRo''' which stands for "'''Pa'''rtner-type-[[domestic robot|'''Pe'''rsonal-'''Ro'''bot]]", is a personal [[robot]] developed by [[Japan]]ese firm [[NEC Corporation]]. It is noted for its cute appearance&lt;ref name="EngadgetCute"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Farivar|first1=Cyrus|title=PaPeRo : Shibuya girls' favorite robot|url=https://www.engadget.com/2006/08/31/papero-shibuya-girls-favorite-robot/|website=Engadget|accessdate=16 March 2016|date=31 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[facial recognition system]].&lt;ref name="Nikkei"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Hiroshi Idegawa|author2=Nikkei Monozukuri|author3=Satoshi Ookubo|title=NEC Develops Business-card-sized Voice Interaction Module|url=http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20070508/132121/|website=Nikkei Technology|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The robot's development began in 1997 with the first prototype, the R100.&lt;ref name="RoboticsTodayR100"&gt;{{cite web|title=R100|url=http://www.roboticstoday.com/robots/r100-description|website=Robotics Today|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name PaPeRo was adopted in 2001.&lt;ref name="Ishiguro"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ichiguro|first1=Shin|title=The producer of the wildly popular PaPeRo robot|url=http://www.nec.com/en/global/innovators/s_ishiguro/01.html|publisher=NEC|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PaPeRo has been researched and developed with the intent to be a partner with human beings and its being able to live together with them. For this reason, it has various basic functions for the purpose of interacting with people.&lt;ref name="Ishiguro" /&gt;

Since the original introduction of PaPeRo, there have been a few different versions, including a Childcare Version, 2003 and 2005 revised versions, and "PaPe-Jiro", a robotic comedian.&lt;ref name="GizmoHighway"&gt;{{cite web|title=NEC's PaPeRo Robot|url=http://www.gizmohighway.com/robotics/papero-robot.htm|website=Gizmo Highway|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, a virtual PaPeRo was released for use in any PC running the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] operating system and the [[Pocket PC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ulanoff|first1=Lance|title=NEC's Companion Robot Gets A Virtual Buddy|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,1960209,00.asp|website=PcMag|publisher=[[Ziff Davis, LLC.]]|accessdate=16 March 2016|date=10 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The robot is programmable using a development environment known as "PaPeRo Creator".&lt;ref name="NECFeatures"&gt;{{cite web|title=What can PaPeRo do?|url=http://jpn.nec.com/robot/en/functions/index.html|website=Communication Robot PaPeRo(English)|publisher=NEC|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For PaPeRo to interact with people and perform autonomous actions, it must understand information on the conditions of, and outside, the location where it has been put. For this reason, various devices have been included to detect the outside area, such as a [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] camera, microphone, [[Ultrasonic transducer|ultrasonic sensors]], etc.&lt;ref name="Ishiguro" /&gt;

In spring 2009, NEC introduced PaPeRo Mini,&lt;ref name="RoboticsTodayPaperoMini"&gt;{{cite web|title=Papero Mini Description|url=http://www.roboticstoday.com/robots/papero-mini-description|website=Robotics Today|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; weighing half of the current PaPeRo model, with physical dimensions roughly half the size of the original.&lt;ref name="EngadgetPaPeRoMini"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blass|first1=Evan|title=Cuteness overload: NEC introduces PaPeRo-mini|accessdate=16 March 2016|date=8 May 2007|quote="it stands 250 millimeters tall and weighs 2.5 kilograms, as opposed to the larger model's 385-millimeter height and 5-kilogram weight"}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The PaPeRo Petit was introduced in 2013, which is even smaller at 23&amp;nbsp;cm tall.&lt;ref name="Ishiguro" /&gt;  NEC plans to use this version to provide a service "that will allow family members living apart to watch over each other utilizing the robot and cloud computing technology." &lt;ref name="PhysOrg"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Owano|first1=Nancy|title=NEC introduces the PaPeRo petit robot|url=http://phys.org/news/2013-11-nec-papero-petit-robot.html|website=Phys.org|publisher=Science X Network|accessdate=16 March 2016|date=13 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology ==
PaPeRo uses different technologies to interact with its environment. For example, Its "eyes" are really twin cameras with a face recognition system.&lt;ref name="Ishiguro" /&gt; When PaPeRo has nothing to do, it roams around looking for faces.&lt;ref name="Robotnews"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Childcare Robot PaPeRo|url=https://robotnews.wordpress.com/2006/04/01/the-childcare-robot-papero/|website=Robotnews|accessdate=16 March 2016|date=1 April 2006|quote=" When PaPeRo is not interacting with people, it can engage in autonomous activities such as walking around the house at will"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon finding one, it will try to start a conversation. PaPeRo also has a [[speech recognition]] system. With a pair of sensitive microphones, it can determine exactly where a sound comes from and if the sound is human speech.&lt;ref name="NECspecs" /&gt; The robot will then interpret the information and respond accordingly. While PaPeRo roams around, it uses an ultrasound system located in its chest to detect objects. If an object lies in its path, PaPeRo's [[ultrasound]] system will detect where exactly the object is, and then PaPeRo will decide what to do to avoid the object. PaPeRo also has other sensors located in its head, which can detect if the robot is patted, slapped, etc., with PaPeRo responding accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=This robot can play with children|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2005-03-16/news/27512414_1_new-robot-interactive-robot-world-expo|website=The Economic Times|publisher=Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co. Ltd.|accessdate=16 March 2016|date=16 March 2005|quote="...can respond when people touch its head or body.  The robot is fitted with two digital cameras and eight microphones as well as touch and ultrasound sensors, enabling it to move independently with three wheels without crashing into furniture."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pre-production''' is the process of fixing some of the elements involved in a [[film]], [[Play (theatre)|play]], or other [[performance]]. There are three parts in a production: pre-production, production, and post-production. Pre-production ends when the planning ends and the content starts being produced.

== In film ==
{{main|Filmmaking#Pre-production}}

In [[filmmaking]] and [[video production]], pre-production formally begins once a project has been [[greenlight|greenlit]]. At this stage, finalizing preparations for [[Filmmaking#Production|production]] go into effect.   Financing will generally be confirmed and many of the key elements such as principal [[cast member]]s, director and [[cinematographer]] are set.  By the end of pre-production, the [[screenplay]] is usually finalized and satisfactory to all the financiers and other stakeholders.

During pre-production, the [[screenplay|script]] is broken down into individual scenes [[storyboards]] and all the locations, props, cast members, costumes, special effects and visual effects are identified. An extremely detailed ''schedule'' is produced and arrangements are made for the necessary elements to be available to the film-makers at the appropriate times. Sets are constructed, the crew is hired, financial arrangements are put in place and a start date for the beginning of [[principal photography]] is set. At some point in pre-production there will be a [[read-through]] of the script which is usually attended by all cast members with speaking parts, the director, all heads of departments, financiers, producers, and publicists.

== In music ==

In the [[music industry]], pre-production is a process whereby a recording artist spends time creating and refining their musical ideas.  The artist thus produces a song's [[Demo (music)|demo recording]], or rough draft, in order to pre-establish the song's creative premise. This reduces the time and money spent in expensive studios. The goal is to enter into the major recording phase of production with the basic and most promising ideas having been already established.

Notable producers who preferred this process have included [[Bruce Fairbairn]] and [[Bob Rock]]. They have both produced successful albums such as [[Bon Jovi]]'s ''[[Slippery When Wet]]'', [[Mötley Crüe]]'s ''[[Dr. Feelgood (album)|Dr. Feelgood]]'', [[Metallica]]'s ''[[Metallica (album)|The Black Album]]'' and [[Aerosmith]]'s ''[[Permanent Vacation (album)|Permanent Vacation]]''.

'''''Saints Row: Gat out of Hell''''' is a 2015 [[open world]] [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[video game]] developed by [[Volition (company)|Volition]] and [[High Voltage Software]], published by [[Deep Silver]] and distributed by [[Square Enix]] in North America. It was released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Linux]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox 360]], and [[Xbox One]]. The game, serving as an epilogue to ''[[Saints Row IV]]'', is a [[standalone expansion]], meaning players do not need a copy of ''Saints Row IV'' to play ''Gat out of Hell''.

The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions were released both physically and digitally. The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions saw a release bundled alongside ''Saints Row IV: Re-Elected'', and was released both physically and digitally as well.&lt;ref name="Chris Pereira"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/saints-row-expansion-gat-out-of-hell-confirmed-at-/1100-6421994/|title=Saints Row Expansion Gat Out of Hell Confirmed at PAX [UPDATE]|author=Chris Pereira|work=GameSpot|accessdate=October 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Matulef|first1=Jeffrey|title=Saints Row creative director Steve Jaros joins Valve|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-09-15-saints-row-creative-director-steve-jaros-joins-valve|website=EuroGamer|publisher=EuroGamer|accessdate=September 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gat Out Of Hell'' was released as a monthly free game on [[PlayStation Plus|PlayStation Network]] in July 2016.

==Gameplay==
The player controls Johnny Gat or Kinzie Kensington in an open world environment. ''Gat out of Hell'' shares many gameplay aspects with the previous installments, being primarily played as a [[third-person shooter]] in an open world city scattered with quests, secondary objectives, and various collectibles. Superhuman abilities return from ''Saints Row IV''. ''Gat out of Hell'' introduces "angelic flight", giving wings to the player.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Kotaku|title=Saints Row Gat Out Of Hell Gameplay|date=August 29, 2014|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdalcEvJ0l4|accessdate=July 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike past ''Saints Row'' games, players cannot customize the playable characters; however, by importing a ''Saints Row IV'' save, players can import their custom Boss character to replace the default Boss.

Unlike game progression in previous titles, players advance through the story by completing activities to fill a "Satan's Wrath" meter, which unlocks cutscenes and further story elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0nGZP1qNVY&amp;index=44&amp;list=UUKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw|title=Saints Row: Gat Out of Hell Gameplay Demo &amp;ndash; PAX Prime|work=YouTube|accessdate=October 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gat out of Hell'' takes place in an open world new to the series, New Hades, made up of five islands: Shantytown, Barrens, Downtown, Forge, and the Den, all surrounding a central tower on a middle island.

The player is able to fly around the open-world hell. They can also summon demon allies to flight alongside them.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Disney"/&gt;

The game's weapons are inspired by the [[seven deadly sins]], e.g., a Gluttony Gun that shoots cake batter on enemies for other people to consume.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Disney"/&gt;

==Plot==
The Third Street Saints hold a birthday party for lieutenant Kinzie Kensington ([[Natalie Lander]]) on their spaceship, but while playing a game of [[Ouija]] Board with a board that once belonged to [[Aleister Crowley]], they unwittingly contact [[Satan]] ([[Travis Willingham]]), who proclaims that The Boss will marry his daughter Jezebel ([[Kate Reinders]]). Satan drags the Boss down to [[Hell]], with Saints lieutenant Johnny Gat ([[Daniel Dae Kim]]), as well as Kinzie, volunteering to rescue them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=outsidexbox|title=Saints Row: Gat Out Of Hell Gameplay Trailer - Xbox One and PS4|date=August 29, 2014|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cBOp5lc2bM|accessdate=March 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon arriving, they find Ultor Corporation has a branch in Hell and suspect former Saints enemy, Dane Vogel ([[Jay Mohr]]), is responsible. Vogel denies involvement, but admits he is taking advantage of Hell's economy, offering to help the Saints save the Boss. Meanwhile, Jezebel is rebelling against her father, as Satan declares her a possession to him. Vogel helps Johnny and Kinzie get Satan's attention by going around Hell and gaining allies such as Kiki ([[Ashly Burch]]) &amp; Viola DeWynter ([[Sasha Grey]]), [[William Shakespeare]] ([[Liam O'Brien]]), [[Blackbeard]] ([[Matthew Mercer]]), and [[Vlad the Impaler]] (Liam O'Brien).

Jezebel finds Johnny and offers to take him to Satan's palace, in hopes he can defeat her father. At the palace, Johnny immediately confronts Satan, who threatens to kill Jezebel unless Johnny drops his gun. When he does, Satan gleefully boasts and praises Johnny, naming him worthy of marrying Jezebel. When Johnny refuses to listen, Satan forcibly makes a deal with Johnny to let Kinzie and the Boss go if he marries Jezebel in the Boss's place.

Johnny shoots Satan at the wedding to no effect, so Johnny and Kinzie take out Satan's minions to force Satan into fighting them. They defeat Satan, who surrenders. Satan banishes them back to the mortal realm, along with Jezebel and the Boss. Johnny, however, is detained by [[God]] ([[Nathan Fillion]]), who explains that Satan was plotting an invasion on [[Heaven]] since Zinyak hastened the Apocalypse by destroying Earth, hoping to use the Boss as the general of his army, and offers to repay Johnny for stopping him.

Johnny is given one of five choices by God; go to Heaven to be reunited with his girlfriend Aisha, return to Hell to become its new king, find a new home world for the Saints so humanity can be rebuilt, recreate Earth, or be told the secrets of the universe. Recreating Earth leads to the timeline of ''[[Agents of Mayhem]]''. The universe of ''Saints Row'' is [[Retroactive continuity|retconed]], and Johnny becomes the lieutenant of the [[Seoul]] police force, hoping to find his friends. Kinzie and Matt Miller ([[Yuri Lowenthal]]) converse about "Brimstone", a captured female who Johnny goes to interrogate.

==Development==
In December 2013, comedian [[Jay Mohr]], who voiced antagonist Dane Vogel in ''[[Saints Row 2]]'', revealed that he was doing voice work for the next ''Saints Row'' game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2013/12/23/comedian-jay-mohr-joins-star-studded-saints-row-cast/|title=Comedian Jay Mohr rejoins star-studded Saints Row cast|work=Joystiq|accessdate=October 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later revealed Volition would be unveiling a new game at [[PAX Prime]] on the August 29, 2014. They teased an image which depicts a Ouija board with the Saints' [[fleur-de-lis]] on it. Later, at their panel on the same day, Volition and Deep Silver confirmed a [[standalone expansion]] to ''Saints Row IV'', called ''Saints Row: Gat out of Hell''. The game was initially scheduled for release on January 27, 2015 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox 360]], and [[Xbox One]]&lt;ref name="Chris Pereira"/&gt; but was later rescheduled to January 20, 2015 in North America and January 23, 2015 in Europe. The game will be released in a bundle alongside ''Saints Row IV: Re-Elected'' for Xbox One and PlayStation 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/04/pax-2014-saints-row-gat-out-of-hells-underworld-playground-is-fun|title=PAX 2014: Saint’s Row: Gat Out of Hell's Underworld Playground Is Fun|last=Otero|first=By Jose|website=IGN|access-date=July 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expansion was inspired, in part, by Disney films, which are among the "big loves" of the game's creative director, Steve Jaros.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Disney"/&gt; He wanted the game to parody the fairytale qualities and "whimsical love songs" of the Disney film genre.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Disney"/&gt; Parts of the plot were taken from such films, including the birthday party prologue from ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'', talking inanimate objects, princess Jezebel rebelling against her father, Satan, through her spousal choice, and musical acts where Satan sings sentimentally.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Disney"/&gt; The open world was designed to be a "fun toy box" that encouraged traversal through flight.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Disney"/&gt; The January 2015 launch trailer included a [[hotline]] phone number with promotional [[hold music]].&lt;ref name="Polygon: hold"/&gt;

''Saints Row: Gat out of Hell'' received generally mixed reviews. Aggregating review website [[Metacritic]] gave the Microsoft Windows version a 66/100 based on 24 reviews,&lt;ref name="MCPC"/&gt; the Xbox One version a 65/100 based on 16 reviews&lt;ref name="MCXONE"/&gt; and the PlayStation 4 version a 64/100 based on 45 reviews.&lt;ref name="MCPS4"/&gt;

Brittany Vincent from ''[[Destructoid]]'' gave the game a 8/10, praising the game's setting, refreshing superpower abilities, new cast of characters, interesting types of enemies and entertaining world, which she stated "feels much more polished and finished than ''Saints Row IV''{{'}}s Steelport simulation." However, she criticized the game's short length. She summarized the review by saying "There's no agenda and no life lessons to learn in ''Saints Row''. There's only pure escapism, which is what games are meant for in my view. Whenever I feel like I need a break, I will have ''Saints Row'' proudly on my shelf."&lt;ref name="Destruct"/&gt; Andrew Reiner from ''[[Game Informer]]'' gave the game a 7.5/10, praising the worthwhile side-activities, well-designed dialogues, satisfying transversal system, creative weapons and storytelling. However, he criticized the graphics, which he stated is on par with the last-generation version of ''Saints Row IV'', as well as occasional framerate losses. He also criticized the game for lacking in gameplay complexity.&lt;ref name="GI"/&gt;

Mikel Reparaz from [[IGN]] criticized the game for lacking traditional story missions, as well as featuring repetitive side missions, unimpressive graphics, and being extremely buggy.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; Alex Carlson from [[Hardcore Gamer]] gave the game a 3.5/5, praising the voice-acting, dialogues, collectibles, flight mechanics and the game-world, which he stated "has a balance between familiar and fresh", but criticizing the game for being too similar to the original ''Saints Row IV'' in terms of the variety of superpower and mission types, as well as the middling story and graphical glitches.&lt;ref name="HG"/&gt; Phil Savage from ''[[PC Gamer]]'' gave the game a 67/100, praising the world design and in-game abilities such as flying, which he stated "has delivered a new sense of freedom". However, he criticized the lack of proper campaign missions and scripting, limited creativity as well as the poor combat system. He ended the review by saying that "''Gat Out of Hell'' offers all the open-world distractions of a ''Saints Row'' game, but it seldom displays the spark of creativity, which made [''Saints Row The Third'' and ''Saints Row IV''] so remarkable."&lt;ref name="PCGUS"/&gt;

{{Simulation VG}}
A '''simulation video game''' describes a diverse super-category of [[video game]]s, generally designed to closely [[Computer simulation|simulate]] real world activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=The Next Generation 1996 Lexicon A to Z: Simulation (Sim)|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=15 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1996|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A simulation game attempts to copy various activities from real life in the form of a [[games|game]] for various purposes such as [[training]], analysis, or prediction. Usually there are no strictly defined goals in the game, with the player instead allowed to control a character freely.&lt;ref&gt;"Simulations: A Handbook for Teachers and Trainers", by Ken Jones, 1995, {{ISBN|0-7494-1666-1}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vq89AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=%22simulation+game%22#PPA21,M1 p. 21]&lt;/ref&gt; Well-known examples are [[military exercise|war games]], [[business game]]s, and [[role play simulation]].

From three basic types of strategic, planning, and learning exercises: games, simulations, and case studies, a number of hybrids may be considered, including simulation games that are used as case studies.&lt;ref&gt;Danny Saunders, Jacqui Severn, "Simulation and Games for Strategy and Policy Planning", [https://books.google.com/books?id=oQxPQEz_bfUC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=game+simulation#PPA20,M1 p. 20]&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparisons of the merits of simulation games versus other teaching techniques have been carried out by many researchers and a number of comprehensive reviews have been published.&lt;ref&gt;"Games and Simulations to Enhance Quality Learning", 1996, {{ISBN|0-7494-1866-4}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4meAFnexIMoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA50&amp;dq=%22business+simulation+game%22&amp;lr= p. 50]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the mid 1980s, [[Code masters]] and the [[Oliver Twins]] released a number of games with "Simulator" in the title, including ''[[BMX Simulator]]'' (1986), ''[[Grand Prix Simulator]]'' (1986), and ''[[Pro Boxing Simulator]]'' (1988). Richard and [[David Darling (entrepreneur)|David Darling]] of Code masters were inspired by [[Concertmaster]]'s best-selling games, which were based on real sports such as football and [[BMX racing]], which had a pre-existing popularity. In a parody of the established "simulator" cliche, ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' released a game titled ''Advanced Lawnmower Simulator'' in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|work=[[GamesRadar+]]|title=Classic Gaming Volume 3|chapter=Coding Back the Years|year=2017|isbn=978-1-78389-385-0|page=116|last1=White|first1=Jon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many{{who|date=June 2018}} credit simulation games beginning with [[Will Wright (game designer)|Will Wright]] and ''[[SimCity (1989 video game)|SimCity]]'' in 1989, the true progenitor of the genre was ''Fortune Builder'', released in 1984 for [[ColecoVision]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colecovisionzone.com/page/game/coleco/fortune_builder.html|title=Colecovision Zone Fortune Builder|publisher=|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Games such as ''[[SimLife]]'' and ''[[SimEarth]]'' were subsequently created and are capable of teaching players the basics of [[genetics]] and [[Biosphere|global ecosystems]].{{citation needed|reason=MS Flight Sim was released on the Apple II and, therefore, way before Sim City|date=December 2013}}

A study of adolescents who played ''[[SimCity 2000]]'' found that those players had a greater appreciation and expectation of their government officials after playing.&lt;ref name=ad&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zeynep|first=Tanes|author2=Zeynep Cemalcilar |title=Learning from SimCity: An empirical study of Turkish adolescents|journal=Journal of Adolescence|date=October 2010|volume=33|issue=5|pages=731–739|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140197109001304|doi=10.1016/j.adolescence.2009.10.007|pmid=19931157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subgenres==

===Construction and management simulation===
{{Main|Construction and management simulation}}

&lt;/ref&gt; is a type of simulation game in which players build, expand or manage fictional communities or projects with limited resources.&lt;ref name="GATVG"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolf|first=Mark J. P.|authorlink=|title=The Medium of the Video Game|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2002|location=|pages=|url=http://www.robinlionheart.com/gamedev/genres.xhtml|doi=|id=|isbn=978-0-292-79150-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Strategy games]] sometimes incorporate CMS aspects into their game economy, as players must manage resources while expanding their projects. Pure CMS games differ from strategy games in that "the player's goal is not to defeat an enemy, but to build something within the context of an ongoing process."&lt;ref name="Rollings"/&gt; Games in this category are sometimes also called "management games".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/emperorriseofthemk/index.html|title=Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom for PC|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=2007-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/schooltycoon/review.html|title=School Tycoon for PC Review|author=Beers, Craig|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=2004-03-18|accessdate=2007-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/134/134515p1.html|title=IGN: Zeus: Master of Olympus Preview|author1=Butts, Stephen | author2=Ward, Trent C.|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2000-10-02|accessdate=2007-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life simulation===
{{Main|Life simulation game}}

Life simulation games (or artificial life games)&lt;ref name="fundamentals"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rollings|first=Andrew|author2=Ernest Adams |title=Fundamentals of Game Design|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2006|location=|url=http://wps.prenhall.com/bp_gamedev_1/54/14053/3597646.cw/index.html}}
&lt;/ref&gt; are a subgenre of simulation video games in which the player lives or controls one or more artificial lifeforms. A life simulation game can revolve around "individuals and relationships, or it could be a simulation of an ecosystem".&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

===Sports===
{{Main|Sports game}}

Some video games simulate the playing of [[sport]]s. Most sports have been recreated by video games, including [[team sport]]s, [[Track and field athletics|athletics]] and [[extreme sport]]s. Some games emphasize playing the sport (such as the [[Madden NFL series|''Madden NFL'' series]]), whilst others emphasize strategy and organization (such as ''[[Championship Manager series|Championship Manager]]''). Some, such as ''[[Arch Rivals]]'', satirize the sport for comic effect. This genre has been popular throughout the history of video games, and is competitive, just like real-world sports. A number of game series feature the names and characteristics of real teams and players, and are updated annually to reflect real-world changes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1352">A '''strategic move''' in [[game theory]] is an action taken by a player outside the defined actions of the game in order to gain a strategic advantage and increase one's payoff. Strategic moves can either be ''unconditional moves'' or ''response rules''. The key characteristics of a strategic move are that it involves a ''commitment'' from the player, meaning the player can only restrict her own choices, and that the commitment has to be ''credible'', meaning that once employed it must be in the interest of the player to follow through with the move. Credible moves should also be observable to the other players.

Strategic moves are '''not''' ''warnings'' or ''assurances.'' Warnings and assurances are merely statements of a player's interest, rather than an actual ''commitment'' from the player.
 
The term was coined by [[Thomas Schelling]] in his 1960 book, ''The Strategy of Conflict'', and has gained wide currency in [[political science]] and [[industrial organization]].

==History==

===1960s–1970s===
The first TV broadcast became reality during the 25th Thessaloniki International Fair (3 September 1960). The Studios were organized in the Power Corporation of Greece (ΔΕΗ) pavilion, with Philips supplied and other locally improvised equipment. 

Some years later, a small private station started operating round the year from another pavilion in the very same Fair. This station operated until 1968 when the two new government channels started operation in Thessaloniki and requested the elimination of the "Illegal" station.

The two government channels, television being a government monopoly, during that period were [[Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation|ERT]] and [[YENED]] (for the military forces).&lt;ref name="kathimerini" /&gt;

After the construction of the OTE Tower (Hellenic Telecommunications Corporation) in the Thessaloniki Fair area, OTE started a third state TV channel in SECAM color. The two initial state channels requested the closing and elimination of the new OTE channel, fearing that OTE would drive them to close, because of the superiority of the color picture, the telecommunications network and the technical superiority of OTE. They succeeded and all the equipment, that OTE already had, passed to YENED, which started what now became ERT3 (the third national channel, broadcasting from Thessaloniki).

During the Greek military government period of 1967–74, the programme was a mixture of news and entertainment. A notable serial which still owns the watching record was the war drama ''O Agnostos Polemos'' (The Unknown War).

After the restoration of the Republic in 1974, Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation [[Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation|ERT]] continue to dominate, appealing to a much larger audience than YENED. Color television broadcasts began in the late 1970s. Notable people were placed to improve the quality of the national channels, such as [[Dimitris Horn]], [[Manos Hatzidakis]] and the Nobel laureate poet [[Odysseas Elytis]].

Finally ERT incorporated YENED.

[[TV 100]] (1988) is the first non-state TV station in Greece. It belongs to the Municipality of Thessaloniki, founded in 1988 by the then mayor of the city [[Sotiris Kouvelas]], who served as mayor until 1989 and a year later, he founded TV station with national coverage in Athens.

===1980s===
In 1982, ERT and YENED merged, forming "[[Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation|ERT]]" (Ellinikí Radiofonía Tileórasi), with ERT becoming "ERT1" and YENED becoming "ERT2". Broadcasts originally lasted for seven to eight hours daily starting at about 5:30PM with children shows and then the first televised news of the day. In 1987 an experimental [[teletext]] type information screen known as "Tilegrafos" (meaning televised words, i.e. telegraph) showed written information on ET2 during the afternoon. By the late 1980s, television broadcasts on ET1 and ET2 (still commonly known as ERT-1 and ERT-2 until later years) had increased to 12–15 hours daily, though it was still common for one or both stations to sign off briefly in the afternoon and sign back on in the early evening hours.

Some illegal broadcasts made short-lived appearances during the 1980s showing mainly movies of adult nature but, in 1987, the City of Thessaloniki began rebroadcasting in a TV frequency parts of European satellite channels, leading to a dispute between the government and the city, as the stations' equipment was confiscated numerous times. The more serious challenge to ERT's TV monopoly, however, appeared with the establishment and operation of TV Plus in the Athens/Piraeus area, which begun broadcasting major US films to the starved-for-diversity Athens public. It is then that ERT decided to pre-empt the challenge to its TV monopoly and any further attempts to put private broadcasts on the air, by re-broadcasting itself foreign satellite channels. In October 1988, the first of these satellite channels made it to the airwaves in Athens to block the frequency used by TV Plus, and as this by-now very popular TV station kept changing its frequency, more and more satellite channels were added by ERT to block the frequencies used by TV Plus. They included: [[NBC Europe]] from Great Britain, [[TV5Monde]] from France, [[Sat.1]] from Germany, [[Rai 2]] from Italy, and Horizon (from the former Soviet Union). These stations were soon followed by [[MTV Europe]] and [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]] from the United Kingdom, while the broadcasts of Super Channel was taken over by TV Plus, due to the lack of an actual agreement with ERT. Sky eventually morphed into what is now known as Eurosport, which is still rebroadcast in Greece, and [[Euronews]], [[Rai 1]] and [[Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation|Cyprus SAT]] were eventually added to the lineup. For a short time, [[NBC Europe]] was also rebroadcast, as were [[RTL Television|RTL Plus]] from Germany and [[3sat]].

In 1988, ERT also established [[ET3 (Greece)|ET3]] a regional state-owned network which focused on issues of Northern Greece, to counter the Athens-centric broadcasts of the other two major state broadcasters at the time. Initially a regional network based in [[Thessaloniki]], ET3 also began broadcasting in Athens, and within a few years, in most other regions of the country.

Thessaloniki was the home of Greece's first non-state owned television station, TV100, owned by the City of Thessaloniki, and TV Plus was the first non-state television station in the Athens region. TV Plus, was owned by Invest Plus SA, a US group headed by Daniel Bourla, with the participation of the Municipality of Piraeus, and its programming was quite innovative for Greek standards at the time, as it broadcast first-run Hollywood feature films with subtitles and no commercials. Soon, TV Plus began to offer an over-the-air subscription service, broadcasting an encoded signal 24-hours a day, which viewers could watch by obtaining a decoder (provided for free by the station) and paying a monthly subscription fee. This was especially revolutionary at the time, as a legal framework for private broadcasting, and private broadcasters, still did not exist in the country.

ERT did not take too kindly to the new television stations which began to crop up on the dial following the governments unsuccessful attempts to stop TV Plus, often changing the frequencies of its own stations around or adding repeaters, to interfere with new private broadcasts. However, in 1989, the Greek Parliament finally passed legislation legalizing private broadcasting (radio and television) and providing provisional licenses to two broadcasters, [[Mega Channel]] and Nea Tileorasi (New Television). Mega Channel began officially broadcasting in November 1989 as a national network, while Nea Tileorasi, after several months of broadcasting test bars, disappeared from the airwaves.

Other private broadcasters took advantage of loopholes in the existing legislation and the lack of an organized licensing process to begin broadcasting almost overnight. In December 1989, [[ANT1|Antenna TV]] began broadcasting nationally, named after the successful new radio station by the same name. Mega and Antenna featured similar programming styles, with locally produced comedies and dramas, numerous variety shows (following in the Italian tradition), American films, and tabloid news broadcasts. They immediately won over most of ERT's audience and advertising share, and to this day, are interchangeably the #1 and #2 stations in the audience ratings in Greece, while the ratings of ET1, ET2, and ET3 plummeted (they have recovered significantly since then but still do not challenge the major private networks).

===1990s===
By early 1990, numerous other stations also appeared on the air, including ''New Channel'' (no relation to Nea Tileorasi) with movies, music videos and talk shows, ''Channel Seven-X'' (with avant-garde programming including foreign films, intellectual programming and a simulcast of French music network [[MCM (TV channel)|MCM]]), ''Jeronimo Groovy TV'' (initially a popular music video station that broadcast in Athens, amidst serious interference from other stations), ''TeleCity'' (a right-wing political television station with news and talk shows), [[902 TV]] (owned by the [[Communist Party of Greece]]), ''Kanali 29'' (a television station with political and cultural programs and a cult following), and a plethora of other broadcasters, which filled every available VHF and UHF frequency, often broadcasting only for several weeks or months, or with very little programming of note. Many broadcasters even began to broadcast on the same frequencies as other stations, especially ERT's satellite broadcasts, many of which soon completely disappeared from the airwaves, as ERT seemed unwilling or unable to protect its frequencies. Similarly, private stations sprung up throughout the country, in every city and region and most towns.

The [[color TV|color television]] transmission system [[SECAM]] which had been used since the late 1970s finally switched over to the [[PAL]] color system widely used in the rest of Europe. [[PAL]] was the system used for years in Greece via video tape playbacks on rented movies from video stores but not by ERT. The first TV station to broadcast in [[PAL]] was TV Plus, then by the other private TV stations that followed it and eventually by ERT.

In 1993, two new major players entered the market. [[Skai TV]] began broadcasting, after a prolonged battle for open frequencies with ERT and other stations, and soon began to broadcast as a new national network following in the footsteps of the highly rated [[Skai 100.3|Skai radio]] station in Athens. Also in 1993, Kanali 29's management was handed over to Niko Mastorakis, who was once again involved in Greek media after a long stint as a movie producer and director in the United States. Kanali 29 was renamed [[Star Channel (Greece)|Star Channel]], and featured programming rich in American films and TV series, and talk and lifestyle programmes. Star also began to broadcast nationally.

The following year, ERT decommissioned many of its terrestrial satellite broadcasts, and reassigned many of those now-vacant frequencies to Multichoice Hellas, for terrestrial pay-television services a year after TV Plus went off the air following a dispute with [[Time Warner]] that had acquired a 25% interest in the company. The name of this new pay-TV service was [[Nova Cinema (Greece)|Filmnet]]. In 1995, Multichoice followed with another station, [[Nova Sports|Supersport]], which soon earned the broadcast rights to many Greek sports.

In 1997, ERT, whose audience had never recovered from the advent of private television, and which up until then lagged behind technologically compared to the largest private networks, revamped its operations, unveiling new logos and a new programming philosophy. The stations were modernized, and ET2 was renamed "NET" (Nea Elliniki Tileorassi). ET1 focused on general-interest programming (movies, sports, various TV series), while NET focused heavily on news and talk programming. ET3 continued to focus largely on Northern Greece, with a large dose of cultural programming.

By the late 1990s, Greece began to see its first major mergers and acquisitions (some of them ill-fated) in the realm of broadcast media. Skai TV was sold, and soon became known as "Alpha-Sky" before completely phasing into its new name as [[Alpha TV]]. Kanali 5, a regional television network broadcasting out of Athens, by the former owners of Kanali 29 (and with similar programming to that station), was also revamped, transitioning to "Alter 5" (with a program aimed largely at teenagers and young adults) before fully renaming itself to [[Alter Channel|Alter]]. Its broadcast reach also gradually expanded, and the station now covers almost the entire country. Channel Seven-X, facing financial difficulties, was also sold, and was renamed ''Seven'', featuring programming heavy on sports and news/talk programs. Seven never quite achieved the success of some of the other stations, as it continued to face financial difficulties even after the sale, and never was able to broadcast outside of certain large cities in the country. New Channel, which broadcast in many major cities but did not offer much original programming, was sold to a new investor and renamed "New Tempo" and finally "Tempo TV", building up a national network of repeaters in an effort to become a major player in the television market, which it partially succeeded in, before financial troubles led to its failure in 2001. Finally, [[Makedonia TV]], a regional private network broadcasting out of Thessaloniki, was purchased by the Antenna TV group, and has served as a secondary network featuring many old programs from Antenna TV, American TV series, and a newscast focusing on Northern Greece. The station now also broadcasts nationally.

Specialty networks had also begun to form. In 1992, TVC, Greece's first 24/24h music channel, began operating in Lesvos island. The channel during the 2000s reformed into the pan-European [[Music Force Europe]], today available in 3 countries. Then, in 1996, [[MAD TV (Greece)|Mad TV]] began operating out of Athens, replacing a small local channel known as ''Art 68''. Mad TV featured programming heavy on hit music videos, similar to [[MTV]] and its Greek predecessor Jeronimo Groovy TV (which continued to exist but with a small coverage area and with programming more heavily dependent on talk); both channels, in opposition to TVC, operated in a few-hour rotation. Mad TV did not build a national network of its own, but instead was rebroadcast through local stations throughout the country. [[TV 0-6]] began broadcasting in Athens, with many cartoons and children's shows, while TV Magic, after an ill-fated attempt to become a news-talk station owned by [[Sokratis Kokkalis]], became a station focusing on sports and particularly of Greek sports club [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]], which Kokkalis also owned. Extra Channel was founded in 2000 with a heavy talk focus, and is now known as Extra 3.

In 1999, Multichoice Hellas also formed [[NOVA Greece|Nova]], Greece's first satellite television subscription service, which initially featured most (but not all) of Greece's major networks, as well as many international networks, and other music and interactive services, which it has continued to expand since then. Nova was to be followed by a competing satellite platform, known as "Magna", by the owners of ''Seven'', which never began operations.

===2000s===
In 2000, Alpha TV founded ''Alpha Digital'', which broadcast Alpha TV, Polis TV (a local station serving Athens owned by Alpha) various thematic stations also operated by Alpha, the radio stations owned by the Alpha group, and a small variety of foreign television networks, headlined by MTV and VH1 (MTV, by that time, was no longer rebroadcast terrestrially in Greece, that ceased in 1999). Despite the popularity of MTV and VH1 and Alpha earning the rights to Greek soccer matches, the company soon went under, leaving Nova as the only company providing pay-TV services in Greece to this day. Plans for a satellite bouquet managed by OTE (the Greek telecommunications company) never went past the test phase, with OTE leasing frequencies on the [[Hot Bird]] satellite, rebroadcasting several smaller Greek TV stations as well as many radio stations free-to-air.

The past few years have seen the failure of many television ventures, but the creation and investment in many new ones. Polis TV was relaunched as ''Channel 9'' in December 2005, with programming heavy on news and talk shows. More recently, the original owners of [[Skai TV]] returned to the television business, relaunching Skai on the frequencies of ''Seven TV''. Other notable stations that have begun operating in recent years include ''Channel 10'', while TeleCity was renamed Tileasty. Other stations have upgraded and modernized, however, the Greek airwaves are still cluttered with many unlicensed television stations, often broadcasting programs of a low quality (telemarketing, low budget movies, music videos, illegal telephone hotlines, soft pornography).

To this day, the Greek government still has not issued official licenses to most television stations in Greece, which are currently broadcasting in a quasi-legal state. Tenders have been offered for national, regional and local broadcasts as well as terrestrial pay-TV services, which have either been frozen or have failed completely. Despite numerous government pledges, there has not been much movement on this issue in recent years. In the meantime, the airwaves are still cluttered, though things are significantly more organized than they were in the early 1990s. Despite the success of Nova, and the launch of [[Hellas-Sat]], cable TV has been slow to follow, only existing on a local level in some communities around Greece until recently, when companies such as OnTelecoms have launched cable (IPTV) platforms.

===2010s===
On June 11, 2013 the Greek Government suspended the operation of the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (ERT) and automatically fired 2,600 workers, in one of numerous spending cuts that have been implemented during Greece's ongoing debt crisis. The plug was pulled at 23:10 during the news.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-22861577 |title=BBC News - Greece suspends state broadcaster ERT to save money |publisher=bbc.com|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On June 11, 2015 the new Government (made up of SYRIZA &amp; AN.EL. parties) reinstated the operations of ERT by hiring back the personnel and broadcasting the three ERT channels ERT1, ERT2, ERT3.

Today, Greece has four national state-owned networks, three state-owned national digital television networks, a state-owned satellite broadcast network, and several national private television networks, in addition to approximately 150 local and regional television stations broadcasting across the country. Audience ratings are handled by AGB Hellas.

==Digital Terrestrial Television==
In 2005, Alpha TV briefly ran experimental broadcasts in DVB-T locally in Athens, while in [[Heraklion]], [[Crete]], a regional network, [[Kriti TV]], in conjunction with the [[University of Crete]], also started digital operation.

In January 2006, the State broadcaster [[Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation|ERT]] launched free-to-air [[Digital terrestrial television]] ([[DVB-T]]) with three "pilot" channels called [[Prisma+]], [[Cine+ (Greece)|Cine+]] and [[Sport+ (Greece)|Sport+]], collectively branded as [[ERT Digital]]. The first channel, Prisma+, was targeted at disabled persons, while Cine+ broadcasts movies, and Sport+ broadcasts a sports program. A fourth channel, the [[Cyprus|Cypriot]] national channel's satellite program [[RIK sat]], was also retransmitted on digital.

From September 2009 onwards, the seven major television stations in Greece broadcast in [[DVB-T]] [[MPEG-4]], via a company set up by them, [[Digea]]. Because of the concentration of the population in a few cities, about 75% of the Greeks are now able to view DTT, although only a small proportion of the geographical area of Greece is covered. Areas covered (as at August 2011) include Attica, Thessalonica, Larissa, Alexandropolis, the Corinthian Gulf, and Rhodes Town.

On February 6, 2015, the transition to digital TV in Greece was completed. A digital-ready TV or set-top box is required to view digital channels.

==Cable TV==
First CABLE TV operator in Greece, is located at [[Kalamaria]] ([[Thessaloniki]]). Hellenic Cable Networks (www.hcn.gr) among cable internet services offers DVB-C and analog TV services without the need of an external STB.

==IPTV==
In 2006 two companies began offering television service via [[IPTV]], namely [[Vivodi Telecom]] and [[On Telecoms]]. Both of these went out of business. 

They offered television service bundled with High-speed Internet &amp; Telephony services. Their channel offerings included local Greek networks, international stations and pay-TV networks [[Nova Cinema (Greece)|Nova Cinema]] &amp; [[Nova Sports]], that were made available to subscribers via an agreement with Greek DTH provider [[NOVA Greece|NOVA]].

In 2009, Greek Telecommunications giant [[OTE]] launched IPTV service called ''[[OTE TV|Conn-x TV]]'' which was initially available in Athens, Thessaloniki, Patras, Larisa and Iraklion.&lt;ref name="broadbandtvnews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2009/02/10/ote-launches-iptv-service/ |title=OTE launches IPTV service|publisher=broadbandtvnews.com|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greek broadband provider [[Hellas Online]] also launched an IPTV platform called ''hol tv (now Vodafone TV''.&lt;ref name="broadbandtvnews2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2009/03/10/hellas-launches-iptv-platform/ |title=Greece catches IPTV fever|publisher=broadbandtvnews.com|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vodafone TV offers all major Greek networks as well as news, sports, music and children's channels. It is also the first provider in Greece to offer [[High-definition television|HDTV]] as well as Video on demand.

[[Image:CBS Late Movie.jpg|right|thumb|225px|Original title card (1972–1984).]]
'''''The CBS Late Movie''''' is a [[CBS]] television series (later known as '''''CBS Late Night''''') during the 1970s and 1980s. The program ran in most American [[media market|television markets]] from 11:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. ([[Eastern Time Zone|ET]]/[[Pacific Time Zone|PT]]) until 2:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. or later, on weeknights. A single [[continuity announcer|announcer]] (in the early years, CBS staff announcer Norm Stevens) voiced the introduction and [[commercial bumper]]s for each program, but there was no [[master of ceremonies|host]] per se, or [[closing credits]] besides those of the night's presentation. (The bumpers announcing the stars of the movie notably rotated names, two or three at a time, so more of the players would be mentioned.)

The program was launched following the cancellation of ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'', CBS's late-night talk show from 1969 to 1972. The show went on to have a long run in [[first-run syndication]] following CBS's cancellation.

''The CBS Late Movie'' theme music was "So Old, So Young" by [[Morton Stevens]], which also served as the theme music for CBS' prime-time movies until 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadpictures.blogspot.com/2011/12/all-night-television-pictures-in-my.html|title=Dead Pictures: ALL NIGHT TELEVISION: THE PICTURES IN MY HEAD|first=James|last=Pagan|date=December 31, 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A memorable aspect to the show's commercial breaks was the frequent appearance of [[public service announcements]], from the [[Ad Council]] and other organizations, that often dealt with "mature" topics such as [[venereal disease]], [[sex crime|sexual]] and [[violent crime]]s, and abuse of [[hard drugs]]. Announcements also ran in much greater proportion than during prime time, with commercial breaks lasting longer; it was not uncommon for the second portion of the show to start at 12:05&amp;nbsp;a.m. or 12:40&amp;nbsp;a.m.

==Background==

Until 1969, CBS programming had never ventured into the late hours. However, three years earlier, scheduling coordinators at many of the network's affiliates, who were programming old movies after nightly local newscasts, took notice of the dwindling stock of new films available for acquisition. In fact, a 1966 poll of CBS affiliates revealed that approximately 80% of local outlets were demanding the network "supply a late evening entertainment show Mondays through Fridays" to fill the growing void in newer films.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Val. "CBS Considers Late Night Show: Shortage of Films May Spur Competition for 'Tonight'." ''New York Times''. (July 18, 1966): p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, CBS tentatively targeted the spring of 1968 as the premiere date for a new network late-night series. But CBS spokespersons admitted they "did not know whether its show would be similar to others, but it [was] hopeful of devising something different" from the usual talk format exemplified by [[Johnny Carson|Johnny Carson's]] ''Tonight Show'' on [[NBC]] or [[Joey Bishop]], who was about to bring [[The Joey Bishop Show (talk show)|his own brand of chat]] to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Val. "CBS to Develop 11:30 P.M. Entertainment Series." ''New York Times''. (January 12, 1967): p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, at its annual convention, CBS met with 750 affiliate executives and told them the network could provide a Carson-style late-night program by the following spring—but only if 85% of station-owners would commit to airing it. Otherwise, the financing required for such a production would prove cost-prohibitive. No official poll was taken among the executives, however, and this may have been due to the fact that in 1966, when a similar offer was dangled before affiliates, only 70% of CBS stations desired a late-evening talk show.&lt;ref&gt;Gent, George. "Channel 5 to Televise a Heart Operation June 25." ''New York Times''. (June 8, 1967): p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet in 1969, this is just what was offered to them—in the person of [[Merv Griffin]]. But despite his success as a syndicated TV phenomenon, Griffin's CBS ratings could never compete with Johnny Carson's consistently high audience numbers. And thus, in pulling the plug on Griffin in early 1972, CBS committed its late-night programming to classic feature films as well as the debut of more recent theatrical fare.

This move proved an effective ploy because two months after ''The CBS Late Movie'' premiered, the Nielsen ratings recorded that it had drawn a larger audience than ''The Tonight Show''.&lt;ref&gt;Gent, George. "CBS doubles late-night audience." ''Corpus Christi Caller-Times''. (April 23, 1972): Section H, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; One CBS executive had a simple explanation for this sudden (though short-lived) good fortune: "People just like to watch movies."

The ''CBS Late Movie/Late Night'' block, however, was not always cleared by every affiliate of the network; in several markets, the block was either [[broadcast delay|delayed]] by one hour from its regularly-scheduled time (most notably in the [[Central Time Zone|Central]] and [[Mountain Time Zone|Mountain time zones]]), picked up by a local [[independent station (North America)|independent station]] (including those that later affiliated with the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network), or not seen at all in certain cities. Those stations that did not carry ''CBS Late Night'' instead broadcast movies from their own libraries and/or their own lineup of off-network syndicated sitcoms, drama reruns and first-run syndication products.

A large factor in the programming decisions of many CBS affiliates electing not to clear ''CBS Late Night'' (or delaying it) was due to head-to-head competition with NBC's ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', and starting in 1980, [[ABC News]]' ''[[Nightline]]''. ABC themselves went with a similar format to ''CBS Late Night'', with ''[[ABC's Wide World of Entertainment|Wide World of Entertainment]]'', which later gave way to ABC Late Night, which consisted of reruns of that network's prime-time series and original movies. Preemptions and delays of the block by CBS affiliates increased during the 1980s, and into the early 1990s, as the syndication market began to grow more, and several stations deciding it would be more financially beneficial to air syndicated programming, thus keeping all advertising revenue for themselves. The debut of ''[[The Pat Sajak Show]]'' in January 1989 gained some affiliates back to the ''CBS Late Night'' lineup; however, some CBS affiliates elected to air ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'' instead; in the case of CBS' Chicago station, [[WBBM-TV]], both shows aired back-to-back after the late newscasts.

It was not until 1993, when the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' debuted, that CBS' late night programming (excluding ''[[CBS News Up to the Minute|Nightwatch/Up to the Minute]]'') was cleared across the entire network.

==History==

===1972–1976===
First airing on February 14, 1972, ''The CBS Late Movie'' initially ran titles from a new package of [[MGM]] films that had not been previously televised. These included the [[Richard Chamberlain]] courtroom drama ''[[Twilight of Honor]]'' (1963), the original version of the sci-fi classic ''[[Village of the Damned (1960 film)|Village of the Damned]]'' (1960), [[Sidney Lumet]]'s prisoner-of-war entry ''[[The Hill (film)|The Hill]]'' (1965), as well as two installments from the [[Margaret Rutherford]]-[[Miss Marple]] series—''[[Murder Most Foul]]'' (1964) and ''[[Murder at the Gallop]]'' (1963). CBS's new anthology also offered packages of 1950's [[Warner Bros.]] and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] films that, up until then, had been run only on local and independent stations but never on a network. These included the [[Burt Lancaster]] medieval action-picture ''[[The Flame and the Arrow]]'' (1950), the [[Randolph Scott]] western ''[[Fort Worth (film)|Fort Worth]]'' (1951), and the [[Richard Widmark]] military drama ''[[Take the High Ground!]]'' (1953). But Warners also made available a new package to viewers that showcased the TV premieres of [[Luchino Visconti|Visconti's]] controversial anti-Fascist work ''[[The Damned (1969 film)|The Damned]]'' (1969), the [[Beau Bridges]] outback adventure ''[[Adam's Woman]]'' (1969) and the [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer]]-horror [[Christopher Lee]] entry, ''[[Dracula Has Risen from the Grave]]'' (1969).

As mentioned above, the first few weeks of ''The CBS Late Movie'' proved a winner with late-night television audiences. Here is the lineup of feature films that initially drew viewers away from Johnny Carson and the rest of CBS's late-night competition:

:{{Color box|#BBF0F7|border=darkgray}} Aqua indicates the world television premiere of the title.
:{{Color box|#FFF999|border=darkgray}} Yellow indicates the network premiere of a film that was previously shown for years on local and independent stations.
:{{Color box|#FEFEFB|border=darkgray}} White indicates titles that had already been run on a network but had not yet been syndicated to local outlets.

As the graph above indicates, films that had never before been shown on television proliferated during ''The CBS Late Movie''{{'}}s first couple of weeks. But later on in this period, older films that had been run previously on local stations began to increase in number. This may help explain the decline in audience that occurred a few months after the program's initial telecasts.

Also televised during ''The CBS Late Movie''{{'}}s first five years were repeats of [[television movie|made-for-TV movies]] previously seen on CBS and other networks (including some that first appeared as an ''[[ABC Movie of the Week]]''), and movies not well-suited for prime time due to content. (Violence was often the main factor, with [[True crime (genre)|true crime]] stories and [[crime fiction|police drama]], and occasionally controversial subject matter, or strong [[Thriller (genre)|suspense]], [[horror film|horror]], or [[science fiction film|sci-fi]] themes.) Among these were ''[[The Abominable Dr. Phibes]]'', its sequel ''[[Dr. Phibes Rises Again]]'', and ''[[Theatre of Blood]]'' (all three of which starred [[Vincent Price]]), ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde]]'', ''[[The Valley of Gwangi]]'', ''[[7 Faces of Dr. Lao]]'', ''[[The Creeping Flesh]]'' (with the horror team of [[Peter Cushing]] and [[Christopher Lee]]), ''[[Asylum (1972 horror film)|Asylum]]'', ''[[Baron Blood (film)|Baron Blood]]'', ''[[Frogs (film)|Frogs]]'', the killer-rats-on-the-loose film ''[[Willard (1971 film)|Willard]]'' and its sequel ''[[Ben (1972 film)|Ben]]''.

[[Richard Burton]]'s ''[[Doctor Faustus (1967 film)|Doctor Faustus]]'', ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'', and [[The Monkees]]' ''[[Head (film)|Head]]'' made their network television debut on this series, as did such lower-budget schlock horror films as ''[[The Giant Spider Invasion]]'' and ''[[Night of the Lepus]]'', the latter of which featured giant rabbits on the loose, becoming a source of embarrassment for one of its stars, ''[[Star Trek]]'' actor [[DeForest Kelley]], who refused to discuss the film later in interviews.

Well-known theatrical movies were also occasionally featured, such as the 1951 ''[[Show Boat (1951 film)|Show Boat]]'' (which had made its network TV debut on NBC in 1972, and was shown on CBS as both a [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] and [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] special), the [[David Lean]] ''[[Great Expectations (1946 film)|Great Expectations]]'' (1946), and a severely edited 75-minute version of the David Lean ''[[Oliver Twist (1948 film)|Oliver Twist]]'' (1948). Some films were seen in two parts over two nights, such as ''[[The Dirty Dozen]]'' and ''[[Grand Prix (1966 film)|Grand Prix]]''. Another older film that was featured was the 1939 version of the [[Sherlock Holmes]] story ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles (1939 film)|The Hound of the Baskervilles]]'', starring [[Basil Rathbone]] and [[Nigel Bruce]].

In 1975, repeats of episodes from the ''[[NBC Mystery Movie]]'' were added to the mix; the first of these was ''[[Banacek]]'', which made its ''CBS Late Movie'' debut on January 7, 1975. However, these episodes were sometimes cut to fit into the 60-minute program frame (excluding time for commercials and public service announcements), especially on nights that they were paired up with another 60-minute drama.

But not all evenings were devoted to reruns of television serials, for in the summer of 1976, classic [[United Kingdom|British]] films enjoyed a short revival on ''The CBS Late Movie''. These included the [[Nigel Patrick]] mystery ''[[Sapphire (film)|Sapphire]]'' (1959), [[Carol Reed]]'s [[Irish Republican Army|I.R.A.]] drama ''[[Odd Man Out]]'' (1947), and the [[Powell and Pressburger]] fantasy, ''[[A Matter of Life and Death (film)|Stairway to Heaven]]'' (1946).

===1977–1984===
After 1976, the show also featured back-to-back reruns of different one-hour television series, some popular (''[[Barnaby Jones]]'', ''[[Kojak]]''), some lesser known (''[[Kolchak: The Night Stalker]]'', ''[[Baa Baa Black Sheep (TV series)|Black Sheep Squadron]]'', ''[[Dan August]]'', ''[[Harry O]]''),  and some originally made for British television (''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' and ''[[The New Avengers (TV series)|The New Avengers]]'', ''[[Return of the Saint]]'', ''[[Thriller (UK TV series)|Thriller]]''). Repeats of several of the network's situation comedies were also shown in rotation during the 1970s and early 1980s, including ''[[The Jeffersons]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', ''[[Alice (TV series)|Alice]]'', ''[[Archie Bunker's Place]]'' and ''[[WKRP in Cincinnati]]''.

The original series ''[[Behind the Screen (TV series)|Behind the Screen]]'' was part of ''CBS Late Night'' from October 1981 to January 1982.

The ''Late Movie''{{'}}s [[time slot]] was also at times taken over by tape-delayed sports events, such as [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] playoffs and [[NBA Finals|finals]] games.

===1985–1989===
TV movies from other networks (''[[Cage Without a Key]]'', ''[[Something for Joey]]'', ''[[Birth of The Beatles]]'') began to appear during the 1980s, and in 1985 the series was retooled as ''CBS Late Night''. The expansion of [[cable television|cable]] and [[satellite television]] during the 1980s took over much of the show's movie fare, and it became mostly a place for repeats of ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'' and other popular CBS shows. ''[[Night Heat]],'' a production of [[Canada]]'s [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] network, also aired on ''CBS Late Night''. ''[[Adderly]]'', ''[[Hot Shots (TV series)|Hot Shots]]'' and ''[[Diamonds (Canadian TV series)|Diamonds]]'', other Canadian-filmed shows, later appeared. In 1987, CBS aired an Americanized version of the [[BBC]]'s long running pop music show, ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', hosted by [[Nia Peeples]] and featuring some performances from the BBC version of the program, alongside those taped in Hollywood. The show was presented on late Friday nights, and lasted almost a year.

===1990–1993===
In 1989, ''CBS Late Night'' was replaced by ''[[The Pat Sajak Show]]''.  A year later, ''CBS Late Night'' returned after ''The Pat Sajak Show'' was shortened from 90 to 60 minutes in February 1990 and then cancelled altogether on April 13, 1990. During the same two-month time-span, ''CBS Late Night'' also televised reruns of [[Patrick McGoohan|Patrick McGoohan's]] classic spy series, ''[[The Prisoner]]'' (1967-68).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=w8KztFy6QYwC&amp;pg=PA203&amp;lpg=PA203&amp;dq=the+prisoner+tv+series+cbs+late+movie&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AshXFLavrG&amp;sig=VCJXUeq9cw8MwfTyLqAxtuLR8e8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwia75ag0-rcAhUNi6wKHf-1C3s4ChDoATAIegQIAhAB#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20prisoner%20tv%20series&amp;f=false Brooks, Tim and Earle F. Marsh. ''The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946-Present''. New York: Ballantine Books, 2007. p. 203.]&lt;/ref&gt; The network also continued to show reruns of other old prime-time shows such as ''[[Wiseguy]]'' and  shows from other networks including Fox's ''[[21 Jump Street]]'' and [[NBC]]'s ''[[Stingray (NBC TV series)|Stingray]]''. The line-up also featured original programming; for example, there was ''Overtime... with [[Pat O'Brien (television)|Pat O'Brien]]'' as well as ''[[The Kids in the Hall]]'' and ''The Midnight Hour''.

In March 1991, CBS retooled their late night by airing original series under a new umbrella title of ''[[Crimetime After Primetime]]''; new shows included, but were not limited to, ''[[Silk Stalkings]]'', ''[[Tropical Heat]]'' and ''[[Dark Justice]]''.

By that fall, CBS added two original [[game show]]s to the start of the late night lineup; the first to premiere in September 1991 was ''Personals'', hosted by [[Michael Burger]], paired a month later with ''Night Games'', starring comedian Jeff Marder and [[Playboy]] Playmate [[Luann Lee]] as announcer.  Both were adult-oriented game shows that followed a format similar to ''[[The Dating Game]]''. ''Night Games'' was canceled in June 1992, replaced by ''A Perfect Score'', a similar show also hosted by Marder.  Both ''Score'' and ''Personals'' continued until December 1992, to be replaced by an earlier ''Crimetime After Primetime'' until being dropped for ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' by the following August.

===Summer 2015===
CBS revived the concept of running late night crime and police procedural reruns, using the umbrella title ''CBS Summer Showcase'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers Beat the ABC and CBS Time-Slot Competition in All Key Measures for the Week of May 25–29|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/06/04/jimmy-fallon-and-seth-meyers-beat-the-abc-and-cbs-time-slot-competition-in-all-key-measures-for-the-week-of-may-25-29/412469/|accessdate=June 4, 2015|work=zap2it|date=June 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the summer of 2015 between the May 20 finale of ''Late Show with David Letterman'' and the September 8 premiere of ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]'', and the restoration of the [[Ed Sullivan Theater]] between those dates. From May 21, 2015 until September 7, 2015, the network aired reruns of [[police procedural]]s and scripted dramas  in the ''Late Show'' slot beginning with ''[[The Mentalist]]'' (May 21–June 5) and continued throughout the summer with ''[[Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series)|Hawaii Five-0]]'' (June 8–12, July 27–31), ''[[CSI: Cyber]]'' (June 15–19, August 17–21), ''[[Elementary (TV series)|Elementary]]'' (June 22–26), ''[[Blue Bloods (TV series)|Blue Bloods]]'' (June 29-July 5), ''[[The Good Wife]]'' (July 6–10, August 24–28), ''[[NCIS: Los Angeles]]'' (July 13–17), ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' (July 20–24, September 7) ''[[Scorpion (TV series)|Scorpion]]'' (August 3–7), ''[[NCIS: New Orleans]]'' (August 10–14) and ''[[Madam Secretary (TV series)|Madam Secretary]]'' (August 31-September 4).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CBS releases list of "Summer Showcase" programs to replace the Late Show with David Letterman|url=http://www.wdef.com/content/stationblogs/amy-o-meter/story/CBS-releases-list-of-Summer-Showcase-programs-to/OLNP1MdxnU29EJvUQ3TzQA.cspx|accessdate=June 4, 2015|work=WDEF News|date=May 20, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150605021252/http://www.wdef.com/content/stationblogs/amy-o-meter/story/CBS-releases-list-of-Summer-Showcase-programs-to/OLNP1MdxnU29EJvUQ3TzQA.cspx|archivedate=June 5, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Biding time between Letterman and Colbert|url=http://www.bendbulletin.com/lifestyle/3201202-151/biding-time-between-letterman-and-colbert#|accessdate=June 3, 2015|work=The Bulletin|date=June 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Not quite Stupid Human Tricks: Repeats of "The Mentalist" will replace Late Show with David Letterman from May 21-June 5|url=http://thecomicscomic.com/2015/05/19/not-quite-stupid-human-tricks-repeats-of-the-mentalist-will-replace-late-show-with-david-letterman-from-may-21-june-5/|accessdate=May 21, 2015|work=The Comic's Comic|date=May 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=summer&gt;{{cite news|title=Stephen Colbert To Debut On ‘Late Show’ In September – TCA|url=http://deadline.com/2015/01/stephen-colbert-late-show-premiere-date-1201348131/|accessdate=May 17, 2015|work=Deadline Hollywood|date=January 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The network dismissed concerns that it could hurt the ratings of ''[[The Late Late Show with James Corden]]'', which follows the ''Late Show''.&lt;ref name=summer/&gt; Those fears were not realized, as ''The Late Late Show'' received ratings consistent with what it had garnered previously, and ''Summer Showcase'' itself usually maintained Letterman's ratings share, even beating first-run episodes of ABC's ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' in the ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/07/16/late-night-tv-ratings-for-july-6-10-2015/|title=Late Night TV Ratings For July 6-10, 2015|date=July 16, 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/07/10/late-night-tv-ratings-for-june-29-july-3-2015/|title=Late Night TV Ratings For June 29-July 3, 2015|date=July 10, 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Late Late Show'' used the lead-ins as an opportunity to mock talk shows such as ''[[Talking Dead]]'', opening selected episodes with sketches such as ''Talking Mentalist'' and ''Talking Hawaii Five-0'' to discuss the rerun that had just aired. Similarly, during the premiere of Colbert's ''Late Show'', CBS CEO [[Leslie Moonves]] was shown operating a lever he could use to switch back to ''The Mentalist'' reruns if he was dissatisfied with the new program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/4026215/stephen-colbert-les-moonves/|title=Watch Stephen Colbert Joke With CEO of CBS About Canceling His Show|first=Justin|last=Worland|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time.com]]|date=September 9, 2015|access-date=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ocr-talkingmentalist&gt;{{cite news|title=Late Night TV: James Corden giving CBS viewers reasons to smile|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/corden-670133-late-colbert.html|accessdate=December 25, 2015|work=Orange County Register}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''The Quest of Ki'''''|カイの冒険|Kai no Bōken}} is a {{vgy|1988}} [[video game]] developed by [[Game Studio]] and published by [[Namco]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]]. It is the third game in ''[[Babylonian Castle Saga]]'' series which started with the {{vgy|1984}} arcade game, ''[[The Tower of Druaga]]''.

==Plot==

The story of ''The Quest of Ki'' is actually a prequel to the original Tower of Druaga. It occurs shortly after the demon [[The Tower of Druaga|Druaga]] has stolen the Blue Crystal Rod and taken it to his tower. The goddess [[Ishtar]] sends the priestess Ki to the tower in order to retrieve it. The game then follows her doomed quest to the top of the tower, and leads directly into the story of the original game

==Gameplay==
The game is a side-scrolling [[platformer]] with one hundred levels. In each level, the player's goal is to pick up a key and open the door leading to the next area. Various enemies, including slimes, ghosts, and wizards, appear on each floor, and any contact with them results in death.

Ki has no weapons, and thus can not damage or defeat any of the enemies. Her only abilities are to dash and jump. As long as the player holds the jump button down, Ki can rise indefinitely into the air. However, contact with the ceiling or dashing against a wall will cause her to drop to the ground and become stunned for several seconds. This mechanic of floating and getting stunned from bumping against the walls or ceiling is similar to the 1983 Williams vector arcade game, ''Major Havoc''.

Many of the levels consist of puzzles in which the player must carefully regulate the height and direction of Ki's jumps. Each stage in the game contains one or more treasure chest, which hold various items. Although many of the items bestow helpful abilities, the effects only last for the floor on which they were found.

After completing the game, players can gain access to forty bonus stages. These stages contain cameos from the ''[[Pac-Man]]'' ghosts and the enemies from ''[[Dig Dug]]''.

'''Tim Moore''' (December 9, 1887 – December 13, 1958) was an American vaudevillian and comic actor of the first half of the 20th century. He gained his greatest recognition in the starring role of George "Kingfish" Stevens in the [[CBS]] TV's ''[[Amos 'n' Andy#Television|The Amos 'n' Andy Show]]''. He proudly stated, "I've made it a point never to tell a joke on stage that I couldn't tell in front of my mother."&lt;ref name="Married"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Oqw7AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6SkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3178,18595996&amp;dq=tim+moore&amp;hl=en|title=Played Best Theatres Of The World|author=Johnson, Lillian|date=February 22, 1941|publisher=The Afro-American|accessdate=October 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore was born '''Harry Roscoe Moore''' in [[Rock Island, Illinois]], one of 13 children of Harry and Cynthia Moore.&lt;ref name="Married"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4gDh277r_J4/TZzPaV_bmvI/AAAAAAAABD0/ozhyDH9GXM0/s1600/Picture+1345.jpg|title=Photo of Tim Moore with his parents and six of his seven brothers|date=August 13, 1995|publisher=Rock Island Argus|accessdate=June 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a night watchman at a brewery. Tim Moore dropped out of grammar school to work at odd jobs in town and even danced for pennies in the streets with his friend, Romeo Washburn.&lt;ref name=Library/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tim"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackpast.org/?q=aah/moore-tim-1888-1958|title=Tim Moore|publisher=BlackPast.org|accessdate=October 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898, Moore and Washburn went into [[vaudeville]] in an act called "Cora Miskel and Her Gold Dust Twins." It was booked by agents and travelled through the United States and even Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://black-face.com/Tim-Moore.htm|title=Tim Moore|publisher=Black-face.com|accessdate=September 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yodaslair.com/dumboozle/tmoore/golddust.html|title=Tim Moore: The Gold Dust Twins|publisher=Yoda'sLair.com|accessdate=November 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fultonhistory.com/Process%20small/Newspapers/New%20York%20NY%20Clipper%201853%20-%201924/New%20York%20NY%20Clipper%201904-1905.pdf/New%20York%20NY%20Clipper%201904-1905%20-%200133.pdf|title=New York City-(Brooklyn)-Fulton Street Theater|date=April 2, 1904|publisher=The New York Clipper|accessdate=June 12, 2011}} ([[PDF]])&lt;/ref&gt; By 1904, the act had performed with the [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus|Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fultonhistory.com/Process%20Small/Newspapers/New%20York%20NY%20Clipper%201853%20-%201924/New%20York%20NY%20Clipper%201904-1905.pdf/New%20York%20NY%20Clipper%201904-1905%20-%200817.pdf#xml=http://www.fultonhistory.com/dtSearch/dtisapi6.dll?cmd=getpdfhits&amp;u=fffffffff50ceeeb&amp;DocId=11210787&amp;Index=Z%3a%2fFulton%20Historical&amp;HitCount=2&amp;hits=13bf+13c0+&amp;SearchForm=C%3a%5cinetpub%5cwwwroot%5cFulton%5fNew%5fform%2ehtml&amp;.pdf|title=Vaudeville and Minstrel|date=October 22, 1904|publisher=The New York Clipper|accessdate=June 12, 2011}} ([[PDF]])&lt;/ref&gt;  As Moore and Washburn grew older, the act became less effective and Miss Miskel sent them back to their parents in Rock Island. Shortly after this, Moore joined the medicine show of "Doctor Mick" (Charles S. Mick), who sold a patented [[quackery|quack]] remedy called ''Pru-ri-ta''. Doctor Mick travelled through the Midwestern states, with songs and dances provided by Moore and four [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]] Indians.&lt;ref name=Library/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yoda"/&gt; The young man also worked in a carnival [[sideshow]] and gave guided tours as a "native" tour guide in Hawaii.&lt;ref name=Library/&gt;

===Broadway comedian===
In June 1925, Tim Moore made his Broadway debut as the star of ''Lucky Sambo'' (based on "Aces and Queens'). However, the show closed after only a few performances. He was a success in burlesque in the mid 1920s with the hit show ''Rarin' to Go'', followed by a return to vaudeville in 1927 with ''The Southland Revue''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=95BXAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=f0QNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2871,1601721&amp;dq=tim+moore&amp;hl=en|title=Rarin' To Go|publisher=The Toledo News-Bee|date=6 September 1926|accessdate=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore wrote all of his own material and also did some writing for other performers; a Moore skit called, ''Not a Fit Night for Man nor Beast'', was bought by [[W.C. Fields]].&lt;ref name=Library/&gt;&lt;ref name="Registry"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harlem"/&gt; He also did some writing for the radio show of the [[Two Black Crows]] comedy team. Moore was brought to New York to sign a writing contract but before this was done, Charles Mack of the team was killed in an auto accident, thus ending the act.&lt;ref name="Two"/&gt;  Moore wrote sketches which became part of Lew Leslie's "Blackbirds" revues as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7349AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XisMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2557,14267381&amp;dq=amanda+randolph&amp;hl=en|title=This Week in the Theatres|date=July 14, 1928|publisher=The Afro American|accessdate=March 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, Moore took time off from his vaudeville bookings to try his luck once more on the Great White Way – [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. This time he met with enormous success as the star comedian of Lew Leslie's hit musical comedy revue, the ''[[Blackbirds of 1928]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5H49AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XisMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=848,12924983&amp;dq=tim+moore&amp;hl=en|title=Tim Moore To Be 'Blackbird'|date=April 21, 1928|publisher=The Afro American|accessdate=November 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore's co-stars were singers [[Adelaide Hall]] and [[Aida Ward]] and renowned tap dancer [[Bill "Bojangles" Robinson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6H49AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XisMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=796,13462050&amp;dq=tim+moore&amp;hl=en|title=Sees Aida Ward As Future 'Flo' Mills|date=May 26, 1928|publisher=The Afro American|accessdate=October 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hit musical scored high in Paris and London as well as on the road throughout the states.

Politics played a role in the demise of the 1936 edition of the ''Blackbirds'', causing the London run to be shut down.  At the time the troupe was booked in the United Kingdom, [[King Edward VIII]] had just abdicated the British throne for love of American [[Wallis Simpson]].

===Television stardom===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:AmosAndy.jpg|left|250px|thumb|[[Alvin Childress]], Tim Moore, and [[Spencer Williams]] in a CBS publicity shot for the program, 1951.]] --&gt;
In 1950, Moore was recommended by his old vaudeville friend, [[Flournoy Miller]], for the role of George "Kingfish" Stevens, a role which was voiced on radio by white actor [[Freeman Gosden]].&lt;ref name="Harlem"/&gt;  He was called out of retirement by the [[Columbia Broadcasting System]] to star in a new television adaptation of ''[[Amos 'n' Andy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jncxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Yn0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3569,1199892&amp;dq=freeman+gosden&amp;hl=en|title=Amos And Andy Name Subs For Television Roles|date=June 18, 1951|publisher=St. Petersburg Times|accessdate=October 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZCNWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=u-IDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6812,6572779&amp;dq=spencer+williams&amp;hl=en|title=Radio's Veteran Comics Smash Hit on Television|date=April 14, 1954|publisher=Eugene Register-Guard|accessdate=March 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the radio series had developed in prior years, the scheming but henpecked Kingfish had become the central focus of most of the plots. In the television version, Moore played the character more broadly, with louder and more forceful delivery and a distinctive Georgia drawl, exaggerated for comic effect. Moore's Kingfish dominated the calmer and soft-spoken "Amos 'n' Andy" characters. Early in his career, Moore had developed a "con-man" routine he used for many years while in vaudeville; re-working some aspects of his old act produced the television character Kingfish.&lt;ref name="Harlem"/&gt;

Moore was very popular in the show and for the first time in his career became a national celebrity as well as the first African American to win stardom on television. When leaving a train in Albuquerque to buy some Native American pottery, the proprietor recognized him immediately, saying, "You, you Kingfish." This was the first time it happened in Moore's 52 years in show business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4ccKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hU8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3384,3553696&amp;dq=tim+moore&amp;hl=en|title=The Lyons Den|author=Lyons, Leonard|date=August 11, 1951|publisher=St. Petersburg Times|accessdate=October 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show aired on prime-time TV from June 1951 to June 1953. Although quite popular, the series was eventually canceled due to complaints about ethnic stereotyping. Shortly after the television show left the air, there were plans to turn it into a vaudeville act in August 1953, with Moore, Williams, and Childress playing the same characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=i3ZGAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fuUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2121,173955&amp;dq=spencer+williams&amp;hl=en|title='Amos 'n' Andy' Set for Vaude|date=August 4, 1953|publisher=Baltimore Afro-American|accessdate=April 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not known if this was ever realized. After the series was canceled, it was shown in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] until 1966 when increasing condemnation and pressure from the NAACP persuaded the show's owners (CBS, which still owns the copyrights) to withdraw it from further exhibition.  It was resurrected in the early days of home videotape through [[public domain video dealers]] who had acquired episodes from collectors of used 16mm TV prints, although the copyright was never in the public domain. Illegally produced copies continue to be sold over the internet.  The series itself would not be seen on a regular basis again until independent network Rejoice TV began re-airing episodes in 2012.

Many of the episodes revolved around Moore's Kingfish character, supported by [[Ernestine Wade]] as his level-headed, emotionally strong wife Sapphire, and [[Amanda Randolph]] as his openly aggressive mother-in-law, without the participation of Amos or Andy. These Kingfish-only episodes were originally produced as a spinoff series, ''[[The Adventures of Kingfish]]'', which made its debut on CBS on January 4, 1955 but lasted only a few episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SrIDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=tim+moore+intitle:jet&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7XKyTPS8AZnLngfyw9nuBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwATgU#v=onepage&amp;q=tim%20moore%20intitle%3Ajet&amp;f=false|title=New 'Kingfish' Series To Make TV Debut Jan. 4|date=January 6, 1955|publisher=Jet|accessdate=October 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uV2gZKvQwR0C&amp;pg=PT223&amp;dq=ernestine+wade&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3fUzTf3zMMSp8Aa0vJD3CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwCTgo#v=onepage&amp;q=ernestine%20wade&amp;f=false|title=Make 'Em Laugh: The Funny Business of America|editor-last=Kantor|editor-first=Michael|editor2-last=Maslon|editor2-first=Lawrence|year=2008|publisher=Twelve|pages=384|isbn=978-0-446-50531-4|accessdate=March 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the ''Amos 'n' Andy'' half-hours went into syndication, the ''Adventures of Kingfish'' shows were added to the syndicated package under the ''Amos 'n' Andy'' series title.

In 1956, Moore and his fellow cast mates [[Spencer Williams (actor)|Spencer Williams]], [[Alvin Childress]] and [[Lillian Randolph]] with her choir, tried a tour of personal appearances as "The TV Stars of ''Amos 'n' Andy''".  The tour was halted by [[CBS]], who viewed this as infringing on their exclusivity.&lt;ref name="Tragedy"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4uK_KEF-KT8C&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=all+about+amos+'n'+andy&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2FShTKjXEdP_nQfR7L2IBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=all%20about%20amos%20'n'%20andy&amp;f=false|title=The Tragedy of Amos 'n' Andy|author=Clayton, Edward T.|date=October 1961|publisher=Ebony|accessdate=September 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore, and fellow cast members Williams, Childress and Lee, were able to perform for one night in 1957 in [[Windsor, Ontario]], since legal action had not been taken against them in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BSM_AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2k8MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3663,3973138&amp;dq=spencer+williams&amp;hl=en|title=The Theatre and its People|author=Gardiner, John|date=June 25, 1957|publisher=The Windsor Daily Star|accessdate=March 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===

Moore married his last wife Vivian Cravens (1912–1988) eight months after Benzonia's death; they had been performing as a comedy team for some time before marrying in 1957.&lt;ref name="Obit"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=

My wife protects them and every time we talk about it, we get into an argument. The argument got a little loud and the next thing I knew, the big boy (his stepson Hubbard) jumped out of his chair.  I ran upstairs and got out my old pistol.  I didn't want to hit anybody."&lt;ref name="Gun"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EbgDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=tim+moore+intitle:jet&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=V5XaTN_ICMqdnAe17s3eAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=tim%20moore%20intitle%3Ajet&amp;f=false|title=TV Kingfish and His Sapphire in Real-Life Domestic Brawl|date=January 16, 1958|publisher=Jet|accessdate=November 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the police arrived at the home, Moore, pistol still in his belt, told them, "I'm the old Kingfish, boys. I'm the one you want. I fired that shot. I didn't want to hit anyone, although I could have. Anyway, you should have seen the in-laws scatter when I fired that gun."&lt;ref name="Beef"/&gt; The shot Moore fired hit the china cabinet; he was arrested and charged with assault with a deadly weapon, with police calling him the "funniest prisoner in police history."&lt;ref name="Gun"/&gt; Moore was initially ordered held on $1,000 bond; the judge changed his mind and released Moore on his own recognizance.&lt;ref name="Beef"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/thedailymirror/2008/01/paul-coates-8.html|title=The Daily Mirror|date=January 29, 2008|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=December 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tim and his wife reconciled, with Vivian's pleading for the charges to be dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NbcDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=tim+moore&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MJTaTJKqLIqfnAet3vzvBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=tim%20moore&amp;f=false|title=Kingfish Dismissal Plea Denied, 2 Make Up|date=January 30, 1958|publisher=Jet|accessdate=November 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sitcomsonline.com/photopost/showphoto.php/photo/65703/size/big/cat/792|title=Kingfish Arrested On Assault Charge|date=January 1958|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=November 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore entered a not guilty plea before the case went to trial on March 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FLcDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=tim+moore+intitle:jet&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=V5XaTN_ICMqdnAe17s3eAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=tim%20moore%20intitle%3Ajet&amp;f=false|title=Kingfish Pleads Not Guilty In Gun Fracas|date=February 27, 1958|publisher=Jet|accessdate=November 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He received a $100 fine and a year's probation as his sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cbcDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=tim+moore+intitle:jet&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QJbaTO2qCsWOnwe40Z36Ag&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=tim%20moore%20intitle%3Ajet&amp;f=false|title=Kingfish Fined $100 For Roast Beef Fracas|date=April 10, 1958|publisher=Jet|accessdate=November 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the story broke, local television personality and columnist [[Paul Coates]] invited Tim Moore to appear on his [[KTTV]] television show; Moore explained the situation in two guest appearances. Coates was promptly taken to task for Moore's appearances on his show by Stanley Robertson, a journalist for the African-American newspaper, the ''[[Los Angeles Sentinel]]'', calling Moore "disgraceful" and labeling the two shows with Moore as "television's darkest hour." Coates replied to his critic in his January 29, 1958 ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' column, calling Moore "a pretty wonderful, sincere man" and saying he strongly resented Robertson's attack on him.&lt;ref name="Beef"/&gt;

Because of the "Roast Beef Scandal," Moore was once more in demand and even received a testimonial tribute dinner from the [[Friars Club of Beverly Hills]], and appearing on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' with [[Jack Paar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FLgDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=tim+moore+intitle:jet&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7XKyTPS8AZnLngfyw9nuBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=tim%20moore%20intitle%3Ajet&amp;f=false|title=Words Of The Week|date=January 23, 1958|publisher=Jet|accessdate=October 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The publicity also won him an extended performance engagement at the legendary [[Mocambo (nightclub)|Mocambo]] nightclub.&lt;ref name="Tim"/&gt;

===Death and legacy===
Moore died at age 71 on December 13, 1958 of [[pulmonary tuberculosis]] in Los Angeles, four days after his birthday.  There was no money to pay for his hospital care or for his funeral, Moore having received his final $65.00 residual payment from ''Amos 'n' Andy'' in January 1958.  At one time, Moore had made $700 per week.&lt;ref name="Married"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fEEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=tim+moore+intitle:jet&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_GyyTPaUGIyJnQeOreH7BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=tim%20moore%20intitle%3Ajet&amp;f=false|title=Critically Ill, Kingfish Tells Wife Of Fears, Disappointments|date=December 18, 1958|publisher=Jet|accessdate=October 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=csMlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MfUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=877%2C7527195|title=Kingfish Succumbs|date=December 16, 1958|publisher=Baltimore Afro-American|accessdate=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tom Foy''' (1879 - 7 August 1917) was an English music hall performer and comedian,&lt;ref name=V&amp;A&gt;{{cite web|title=Caricature|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O84867/caricature-cooke-george/|work=V&amp;A Images|publisher=V&amp;A|accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was born in [[Manchester]] of Irish parents.&lt;ref name="its-behind-you.com"&gt;http://www.its-behind-you.com/shakespeareliv.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to his career he served as an apprenticeship as a sign painter. When he was bored, he joined a circus and performed as a scenery artist and clown. His first music hall performance in Manchester was as a lightning cartoonist. He also joined a Wild west show before heading to [[London]] and finding fame as a comedian and pantomime performer. As a comedian he was famous for his sketches such as 'Tom Foy and his Donkey'; his first successful sketch was "The Lanchashire Lad in London". He was billed as "The famous Little Comedian". As a pantomime performer he specialised in "Idle Jack" and pantomime dames.&lt;ref name="its-behind-you.com"/&gt;

On 23 July 1917, whilst onstage at the Argyle Theatre in [[Birkenhead]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/22553&lt;/ref&gt; he collapsed. He died two weeks later at the age of 38. He is buried in [[Brompton Cemetery]] in London, on the east side of the main central path, not far from the main north entrance.

[[File:'The feast of reason, and the flow of soul,' - ie - the wits of the age, setting the table in a roar by James Gillray.jpg|thumb|'The feast of reason, and the flow of soul,' - i.e. - the wits of the age, setting the table in a roar, by [[James Gillray]] (1797)]]

'''Wit''' is a form of intelligent [[humour]], the ability to say or write things that are clever and usually funny.&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.learnersdictionary.com/search/wit|title=Wit|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A '''wit''' is a person skilled at making clever and funny remarks.&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=wit|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/wit|website=Oxford Dictionaries|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forms of wit include the '''quip''', '''repartee''', and '''wisecrack'''.

==Forms==
As in the wit of [[Dorothy Parker]]'s set, the [[Algonquin Round Table]], witty remarks may be intentionally cruel (as in many [[epigram]]s), and perhaps more [[genius|ingenious]] than funny.

A quip is an observation or saying that has some wit but perhaps descends into [[sarcasm]], or otherwise is short of a point, and a witticism also suggests the diminutive. Repartee is the wit of the quick answer and capping comment: the snappy comeback and neat retort. ([[Oscar Wilde|Wilde]]: "I wish I'd said that." [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|Whistler]]: "You will, Oscar, you will".)&lt;ref&gt;Monty Python: Oscar Wilde sketch&lt;/ref&gt;

==In poetry==
Wit in [[poetry]] is characteristic of [[metaphysical poetry]] as a style, and was prevalent in the time of English playwright [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], who admonished pretension with the phrase "Better a witty fool than a foolish wit".&lt;ref name="Salingar1976"&gt;{{cite book

|isbn=978-0-521-29113-2
|pages=245–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may combine [[word play]] with conceptual thinking, as a kind of verbal display requiring attention, without intending to be laugh-aloud funny; in fact wit can be a thin disguise for more poignant feelings that are being versified. English poet [[John Donne]] is the representative of this style of poetry.&lt;ref name="Daley1990"&gt;{{cite book

|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further meanings==
More generally, one's wits are one's intellectual powers of all types. Native wit &amp;mdash; meaning the wits with which one is born &amp;mdash; is closely synonymous with [[common sense]]. To live by one's wits is to be an [[Opportunism|opportunist]], but not always of the scrupulous kind. To have one's wits about one is to be alert and capable of quick [[reasoning]].  To be at the end of one's wits ("I'm at my wits' end") is to be immensely [[Frustration|frustrated]].
