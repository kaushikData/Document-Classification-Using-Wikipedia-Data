An '''act''' is a division or unit of a [[theatre]] work, including a [[play (theatre)|play]], [[film]], [[opera]], and [[musical theatre]]. The term can either refer to a conscious division placed within a work by a playwright (usually itself made up of multiple scenes)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Secret Life of Plays|last=Waters|first=Steve|publisher=Nick Hern Books|year=2010|isbn=978 1 84842 000 7|location=London|pages=32|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a unit of analysis for dividing a dramatic work into sequences. The former use of the term may or may not align with the latter. The word ''act'' can also be used for major sections of other entertainment, such as [[variety show]]s, [[television]] programs, [[music hall]] performances, and [[cabaret]].

==Acts and scenes==
An '''act''' is a part of a play defined by elements such as rising action, climax and resolution.:&gt;&gt; A [[scene (drama)|scene]] is a part of an act defined with the changing of characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grossmont.edu/karl.sherlock/English160/Resources/DramaActsAndScenes.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130409233719/http://www.grossmont.edu/karl.sherlock/English160/Resources/DramaActsAndScenes.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-04-09 |title=Plays, Acts and Scenes in Structure |last=Sherlock |first=Karl |publisher=Grossmont College |date=2005 |work=English 160: Drama Writing |accessdate=26 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To be more specific, the elements that create the [[plot (narrative)|plot]] of a play or any story, and divide a play into acts include the exposition, which give information, setting up the rest of the story. Another is the inciting incident, which starts all of the action that will follow. Going along with the inciting incident, the major dramatic question is formed; this holds the rest of the play. The majority of the play is made up of complications. These are the things that change the action. These complications lead up to the crisis, this is the turning point. Most of the time, at this point, the major dramatic question has been answered. Finally, there is the resolution. This is the end of the play where everything comes together and the situation has been resolved. This leaves the audience satisfied with the play as a whole. These more specific elements of plot in a play are the main things used to divide a play up into acts and sometimes scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Novic, J. (2012). Drama. In World book advanced. Retrieved from http://www.worldbookonline.com/advanced.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman theatre]] was the first to divide [[Play (theatre)|plays]] into a number of acts separated by intervals. Acts may be further divided into [[scene (drama)|scenes]]; in classical theater each regrouping between entrances and exits of actors is a scene, while later use describes a change of setting.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Though there are no limits to the number of acts which might exist within a dramatic work, the most common formats are the three-act and five-act structures.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} Both of these are derived from different interpretations of [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' in which he stresses the primacy of plot over character and "an orderly arrangement of parts".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/poetics.1.1.html|title=The Internet Classics Archive {{!}} Poetics by Aristotle|website=classics.mit.edu|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern plays often have only one level of structure, which can be referred to as either scenes or acts at the whim of the writer; and some writers dispense with firm divisions entirely.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} Successive scenes are normally separated from each other in either time or place; but the division between acts is more to do with the overall dramatic structure of the piece. The end of an act often coincides with one or more characters making an important decision, else having an important decision to make. A decision which has a profound impact on the story being told.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Contemporary theatre, in line with screenwriting and novel forms, tends towards a [[three-act structure]]. Many [[operettas]] and most [[musical theatre|musicals]] are divided into just two acts, so in practice the [[intermission]] is seen as dividing them, and the word "act" comes to be used for the two halves of a show whether or not the script divides it into acts.

==Varieties==

=== One-act plays ===

A [[one-act play]] is a short drama that consists of only one act; the phrase is not used to describe a full-length play that does not utilize act-divisions. Unlike other plays which usually are published one play per book, one-act plays are often published in anthologies or collections.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

=== Three-act plays ===
{{See also|Three-act structure}}

In a three-act play, each act usually has a different tone to it. The most commonly used structure is the first act having a lot of introductory elements, the second act can usually be the darkest with the antagonists having a greater encompass, while the third act is the resolution and the protagonists prevailing. There is an age-old saying that "the second act is the best" because it was in between a starting and ending act and thus being able to delve deeper into more of the meat of the story since it does not need to have as prominent introductory or resolutive portions.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} This is not always so, since a third act or even a first act can have the common second act characteristics, but that type of structure is the most used.
* Act one: In Act I the conflict of the story is discovered. In this act, the [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]], the introduction of the [[protagonist]], and other characters that the protagonist meets take place,&lt;ref name="Cannell"&gt;Cannell, S. J. (n.d.). What is the three act structure? [Lecture transcript].&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Premise (film)|dramatic premise]] and inciting incident (the incident that sets the events of the story in motion) occurs approximately halfway through the first act.
* Act two: The main character encounters an obstacle that prevents the character from achieving his or her dramatic need. This is known as the complication. The main character reaches his or her lowest point and seems farthest from fulfilling the dramatic need or objective and it seems like there is no longer any way that the protagonist can succeed.&lt;ref name="Cannell" /&gt;
* Act three: The [[Climax (narrative)|climax]] occurs as well as the [[dénouement]], a brief period of calm at the end of a play where a state of equilibrium returns. It is simply the resolution.&lt;ref name="Cannell" /&gt;

=== Five-act plays ===
Until the 18th century, most plays were divided into five acts. The work of [[William Shakespeare]], for example, generally adheres to a five act structure&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shakespeare and Five Acts: studies in a dramatic convention|last=Snuggs|first=Henry L.|publisher=Vantage Press|year=1960|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; . This format is known as the [[Dramatic structure|five-act play]], and was famously analyzed by [[Gustav Freytag]] in ''Die Technik des Dramas'' (Dramatic techniques). The five acts played specific functions in the overall structure of the play; but in performance there was not necessarily any clear separation between them.

A similar five-part structure is also used in traditional Japanese [[Noh]] drama, particularly by [[Zeami Motokiyo]]. Zeami, in his work "''[[Sandō]]''" (The Three Paths), originally described a five-part (five ''dan'') Noh play as the ideal form. It begins slowly and auspiciously in the first part (''jo''), building up the drama and tension in the second, third, and fourth parts (''ha''), with the greatest climax in the third ''dan'', and rapidly concluding with a return to peace and auspiciousness in the fifth ''dan'' (''kyū'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Quinn|first1=Shelley Fenno|date=Spring 1993|title=How to write a Noh play - Zeami's ''Sandō''|journal=[[Monumenta Nipponica]]|volume=48|issue=1|pages=58–62|jstor=2385466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other media==
As part of a [[television program]], each individual act can be separated by commercials.
In [[film]], a number of scenes grouped together bring to an audiovisual work to life. The three act structure is commonly referred to in [[film adaptation]] of theatrical plays.

==History==
The Afghanistan Pakistan People's Friendship Association was established in December 2001. Under this Friendship Association, three conferences have been held at [[Peshawar]], [[Quetta]] and [[Karachi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.afghanact.org/en/node/view/421 |title=Conference: Sustainable Repatriation of Afghan refugees-Chitral |accessdate=2008-05-31 |author=Ahmad |date=2003-09-29 |publisher=APDA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050219100159/http://www.afghanact.org/en/node/view/421 |archivedate=2005-02-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2003 the association, along with the human rights commission of Pakistan, organised a conference in the city of [[Karachi]] to discuss the situation of Afghan refugees. The conference criticised various government policies including military action in the [[Mohmand Agency]] which borders Afghanistan. The conference claimed that such actions were an impediment to the normalisation of relations between the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/2003/06/30/local6.htm KARACHI: Resolution of Afghan DPs issue demanded]&lt;/ref&gt; The association has also urged both countries to release each other's citizens in jail for petty offences as well as urging Pakistan to relax visa restrictions for Afghans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smc.org.ph/amnews/amn021215/southasia/pakistan021215.htm Pakistan - SMC]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Roman funerals and burial|burial practices of ancient Rome]] and [[Roman funerary art]], marble and limestone [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] elaborately carved in [[relief]] were characteristic of elite [[inhumation]] burials from the 2nd to the 4th centuries AD.&lt;ref&gt;[[Zahra Newby]]. "Myth and Death: Roman Mythological Sarcophagi" in ''A Companion to Greek Mythology'' (Blackwell, 2011), p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt; At least 10,000 Roman sarcophagi have survived, with fragments possibly representing as many as 20,000.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jas Elsner|Jaś Elsner]], introduction to ''Life, Death and Representation: Some New Work on Roman Sarcophagi'' (De Gruyter, 2011), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Although  [[classical mythology|mythological scenes]] have been mostly widely studied,&lt;ref&gt;Elsner, introduction to ''Life, Death and Representation'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; sarcophagus [[relief]] has been called the "richest single source of Roman iconography,"&lt;ref&gt;Elsner, introduction to ''Life, Death and Representation'', p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; and may also depict the deceased's occupation or life course, military scenes, and other subject matter. The same workshops produced sarcophagi with Jewish or Christian imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Elsner, introduction to ''Life, Death and Representation'', pp. 1, 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Early Christian sarcophagi]] produced from the late 3rd century onwards, represent the earliest form of large Christian sculpture, and are important for the study of [[Early Christian art]].

They were mostly made in a few major cities, including Rome and [[Athens]], which exported them to other cities. Elsewhere the [[stela]] gravestone remained more common.  They were always a very expensive form reserved for the elite, and especially so in the relatively few very elaborately carved examples; most were always relatively plain, with inscriptions, or symbols such as garlands.  Sarcophagi divide into a number of styles, by the producing area. "Roman" ones were made to rest against a wall, and one side was left uncarved, while "Attic" and other types were carved on all four sides; but the short sides were generally less elaborately decorated in both types.&lt;ref name="Hennig, 93-94"&gt;Hennig, 93-94&lt;/ref&gt;

The time taken to make them encouraged the use of standard subjects, to which inscriptions might be added to personalize them, and  portraits of the deceased were slow to appear.  The sarcophagi offer examples of intricate reliefs that depict scenes often based on [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]] or [[mystery religions]] that offered personal salvation, and [[allegory|allegorical]] representations. Roman [[funerary art]] also offers a variety of scenes from everyday life, such as game-playing, hunting, and military endeavors.&lt;ref name="Hennig, 93-94"/&gt;  [[Early Christian art]] quickly adopted the sarcophagus, and they are the most common form of early Christian sculpture, progressing from simple examples with symbols to elaborate fronts, often with small scenes of the [[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]] in two rows within an architectural framework. The [[Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus]] (c. 359) is of this type, and the earlier [[Dogmatic Sarcophagus]] rather simpler. The huge [[porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] [[Sarcophagi of Helena and Constantina]] are grand Imperial examples.

[[Cremation]] was the predominant means of disposing of remains in the [[Roman Republic]]. Ashes contained in [[cinerary urn]]s and other monumental vessels were placed in tombs. From the 2nd century AD onward, [[inhumation]] became more common, and after the [[Roman Empire]] came under Christian rule, was standard practice.&lt;ref&gt;Glenys Davies, "Before Sarcophagi," in ''Life, Death and Representation,'' p. 20ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Sarcophagus of Lucius Cornelius Scipio Barbatus]] is a rare example from much earlier.  A sarcophagus, which means "flesh-eater" in Greek, is a stone coffin used for inhumation burials.&lt;ref name="Awan"&gt;{{harvp|Awan|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarcophagi were commissioned not only for the elite of Roman society (mature male citizens),&lt;ref name="Davies_47"&gt;{{harvp|Elsner|Huskinson|Davies|2010|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also for children, entire families, and beloved wives and mothers. The most expensive sarcophagi were made from marble, but other stones, lead, and wood were used as well.&lt;ref name="Awan"/&gt; Along with the range in production material, there existed a variety of styles and shapes, depending on where the sarcophagus was produced and whom it was produced for.

==History==

===Before sarcophagi===
Inhumation burial practices and the use of sarcophagi were not always the favored Roman funerary custom. The [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]]s and Greeks used sarcophagi for centuries before the Romans finally adopted the practice in the second century.&lt;ref name="Awan"/&gt; Prior to that period, the dead were usually cremated and placed in marble ash chests or ash altars, or were simply commemorated with a grave altar that was not designed to hold cremated remains. Despite being the main funerary custom during the Roman Republic, ash chests and grave altars virtually disappeared from the market only a century after the advent of the sarcophagus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Elsner|Huskinson|Davies|2010|pp=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often assumed that the popularity for sarcophagi began with the Roman aristocracy and gradually became more accepted by the lower classes.&lt;ref name="Davies_47"/&gt; However, in the past, the most expensive and ostentatious grave altars and ash chests were commissioned more frequently by wealthy freedmen and other members of the emerging middle class than by the Roman elite.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Elsner|Huskinson|Davies|2010|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this fact and the lack of inscriptions on early sarcophagi, there is not enough evidence to make a judgment on whether or not the fashion for sarcophagi began with a specific social class. Surviving evidence does indicate that a great majority of early sarcophagi were used for children. This suggests that the change in burial practice may not have simply stemmed from a change in fashion, but perhaps from altered burial attitudes. It is possible that the decision to begin inhuming bodies occurred because families believed that inhumation was a kinder, and less disturbing burial rite than cremation, thus necessitating a shift in burial monument.&lt;ref name="Davies_47"/&gt;

===Stylistic transition from altars and ash chests to sarcophagi===
Although grave altars and ash chests virtually disappeared from the market in the second century, aspects of their decoration endured in some stylistic elements of sarcophagi. The largest stylistic group of early sarcophagi in the second century is garland sarcophagi, a custom of decoration that was previously used on ash chests and grave altars. Though the premise of the decoration is the same, there are some differences. The garland supports are often human figures instead of the animal heads used previously. In addition, specific mythological scenes fill the field, rather than small birds or other minor scenes. The inscription panel on garland ash altars and chests is also missing on garland sarcophagi. When a sarcophagus did have an inscription, it seemed to be an extra addition and usually ran along the top edge of the chest or between the decorations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Elsner|Huskinson|Davies|2010|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that early garland sarcophagi continued the tradition of grave altars with decorated garlands suggests that the customers and sculptors of sarcophagi had similar approaches to those who purchased and produced grave altars. Both monuments employed a similar collection of stylistic motifs with only subtle shifts in iconography.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Elsner|Huskinson|Davies|2010|pp=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metropolitan Roman, Attic, and Asiatic sarcophagus production centers===
[[File:Roman - Sarcophagus with the Triumph of Dionysus - Walters 2331.jpg|thumbnail|The Sarcophagus with the Triumph of Dionysus is a good example of a Metropolitan Roman style sarcophagus with its flat lid, three-sided decoration, and Dionysian scenes from Greek mythology.]]
Sarcophagi production of the ancient Roman Empire involved three main parties: the customer, the sculpting workshop that carved the monument, and the quarry-based workshop that supplied the materials. The distance between these parties was highly variable due to the extensive size of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Elsner|Huskinson|Russell|2010|pp=123–124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metropolitan Roman, Attic, and Asiatic were the three major regional types of sarcophagi that dominated trade throughout the Roman Empire.&lt;ref name="Awan"/&gt; Although they were divided into regions, the production of sarcophagi was not as simple as it might appear. For example, Attic workshops were close to [[Mount Pentelikon]], the source of their materials, but were usually very far from their client. The opposite was true for the workshops of Metropolitan Rome, who tended to import large, roughed out sarcophagi from distant quarries in order to complete their commissions. Depending on distance and customer request (some customers might choose to have elements of their sarcophagi left unfinished until a future date, introducing the possibility of further work after the main commission), sarcophagi were in many different stages of production during transport. As a result, it is difficult to develop a standardized model of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Elsner|Huskinson|Russell|2010|pp=125–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rome was the primary production center in the western part of the empire. A Metropolitan Roman sarcophagus often took the shape of a low rectangular box with a flat lid. As the sarcophagus was usually placed in a niche or against a wall in a mausoleum, they were usually only decorated on the front and two shorter sides. Many were decorated with carvings of garlands and fruits and leaves, as well as narrative scenes from Greek mythology. Battle and hunting scenes, biographical events from the life of the deceased, portrait busts, the profession of the deceased and abstract designs were also popular.&lt;ref name="Awan"/&gt;

====Attic====
[[File:Roman - Garland Sarcophagus - Walters 2329.jpg|thumb|Asiatic garland sarcophagus, the predominant type during the reigns of [[Trajan]] and [[Hadrian]] ''([[Walters Art Museum]])'',&lt;ref&gt;Davies, "Before Sarcophagi," in ''Life, Death and Representation,'' pp. 21, 28ff.&lt;/ref&gt; dated between 150 and 180, in Dokimeion marble, so probably made in Phrygia and then shipped to Rome. The gable-roof lid exemplifies the garland tradition common on ash altars and chests. It also has several incomplete parts on its four sides, suggesting the work was interrupted or it was needed on short notice.]]
Athens was the main production center for Attic style sarcophagi. These workshops mainly produced sarcophagi for export. They were rectangular in shape and were often decorated on all four sides, unlike the Metropolitan Roman style, with ornamental carvings along the bottom and upper edge of the monument. The lids were also different from the flat metropolitan Roman style and featured a pitched gable roof,&lt;ref name="Awan"/&gt; or a kline lid, which is carved in the style of couch cushions on which the form of the deceased reclines.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Strong|Toynbee|1995|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; The great majority of these sarcophagi also featured mythological subjects, especially the [[Trojan War]], Achilles, and battles with the [[Amazons]].&lt;ref name="Awan"/&gt;

====Asia Minor (Asiatic)====
The [[Dokimeion]] workshops in [[Phrygia]] specialized in architecturally formed large-scale Asiatic sarcophagi. Many featured a series of columns joined together by an entablature on all four sides with human figures in the area between the columns. The lids were often made in the gabled-roof design in order to complete the architectural-style sarcophagi so the coffin formed a sort of house or temple for the deceased. Other cities in Asia Minor produced sarcophagi of the garland tradition as well. In general, the sarcophagi were decorated on either three or four sides, depending on whether they were to be displayed on a pedestal in an open-air setting or against the walls inside tombs.&lt;ref name="Awan"/&gt;

===Myth and meaning on ancient Roman sarcophagi===
A transition from the classical garland and seasonal reliefs with smaller mythological figures to a greater focus on full mythological scenes began with the break up of the classical style in the late second century towards the end of [[Marcus Aurelius]]' reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Zanker|Ewald|2012|p=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shift led to the development of popular themes and meanings portrayed through mythological scenes and allegories. The most popular mythological scenes on Roman sarcophagi functioned as aids to mourning, visions of life and happiness, and opportunities for self-portrayal for Roman citizens.

Images of [[Meleager]], the hero who slew the [[Calydonian Boar]], being mourned by his lover and hunting companion Atlanta, as well as images of [[Achilles]] mourning [[Patroclus]] were very common on sarcophagi that acted as grieving aids. In both cases, the mythological scenes were akin to mourning practices of ordinary Roman citizens in an effort to reflect their grief and comfort them when they visited the tomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Zanker|Ewald|2012|pp=62–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playful images depicting [[Nereid]]s, Dionysiac triumphs, and love scenes of [[Dionysus]] and [[Ariadne]] were also commonly represented on sarcophagi.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Zanker|Ewald|2012|pp=128–132}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that these scenes of happiness and love in the face of death and mourning encouraged the living to enjoy life while they could, and reflected the celebration and meals that the mourners would later enjoy in the tomb when they returned to visit the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Zanker|Ewald|2012|pp=169–170}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third century involved the return in popularity of self-representation on Roman sarcophagi.

There were several different ways Roman citizens approached self-representation on sarcophagi. Some sarcophagi had actual representations of the face or full figure of the deceased. In other cases, mythological portraits were used to connect characteristics of the deceased with traits of the hero or heroine portrayed. For example, common mythological portraits of deceased women identified them with women of lauded traits in myth, such as the devoted [[Selene]] or loyal [[Alcestis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Zanker|Ewald|2012|pp=199–206}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scenes featuring the figures of Meleager and Achilles expressed bravery and were often produced on sarcophagi holding deceased men.&lt;ref name="Awan"/&gt; Biographical scenes that emphasize the true virtues of Roman citizens were also used to commemorate the deceased. Scholars argue that these biographical scenes as well as the comparisons to mythological characters suggest that self-portrayal on Roman sarcophagi did not exist to celebrate the traits of the deceased, but rather to emphasize favored Roman cultural values&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Zanker|Ewald|2012|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; and demonstrate that the family of the deceased were educated members of the elite that could understand difficult mythological allegories.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Zanker|Ewald|2012|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third- and fourth-century sarcophagi===
The breakup of the classical style led to a period in which full mythological reliefs with an increase in the number of figures and an elongation of forms became more popular, as discussed above. The proportion of figures on the reliefs also became increasingly unbalanced, with the main figures taking up the greatest area with smaller figures crowded in the small pockets of empty space.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Zanker|Ewald|2012|pp=249–250}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the third century, another transition in theme and style of sarcophagi involved the return in popularity of representing mythological and non-mythological portraits of the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Zanker|Ewald|2012|p=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imagery of the four seasons also becomes popular during the third and fourth centuries. With the advent of Christianity in the third century, traditional motifs, like the seasons, remained, and images representing a belief in the afterlife appeared. The change in style brought by Christianity is perhaps most significant, as it signals a change in emphasis on images of retrospection, and introduced images of an afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Zanker|Ewald|2012|pp=261–266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personalization==
[[Image:Sarcophagus Portonaccio Massimo.jpg|thumb|280px|The [[Portonaccio sarcophagus]]]]
'''Sarcophagi personalization''' is the customization of a [[sarcophagus]] to display the attributes, achievements, or history of the deceased through art and/or [[inscription]]s.

=== Sarcophagus of Lars Pulena ===
The sculpted scene on the front of the coffin shows the deceased in the Underworld between two [[Charuns]] ([[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan]] death demons) in which signified that his journey to the afterlife was successful.&lt;ref name=GART&gt;{{Cite book |last= Kleiner |first= Fred S. |title= Gardner's Art Through The Ages |edition= 13th |publisher= [[Thomson Wadsworth]] |year= 2009 |origyear= 2005 |isbn= 0-495-09307-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the lid, Pulena is shown laid across, in a reclining position, resting on his left arm and in front of him, a list of his life’s achievements which were inscribed on an open scroll.&lt;ref name=GART/&gt;

=== Melfi Sarcophagus ===
The Asiatic sarcophagus with kline portrait of a woman also carried an Etruscan influence of sculpting portraiture on the lid.&lt;ref name=GART/&gt; Made of marble, with reliefs on all four sides of the box (a feature in Eastern Sarcophagi production), and sculpted mini statues of [[Greek gods]] and heroes in frames are depicted.  The lid displays a portrait of the woman with [[Cupid]] (right end) and a little dog (in which the paws only remain at the left end).

=== Battle of Romans and barbarians ===
The [[Portonaccio sarcophagus]] is an example of one of a group of about twenty-five late Roman battle sarcophagi, with one exception all apparently dating to 170-210, made in Rome or in some cases [[Athens]].  These derive from [[Hellenistic]] monuments from [[Pergamon]] in [[Asia Minor]] showing Pergamene victories over the [[Gauls]], and were all presumably commissioned for military commanders.  The Portonaccio sarcophagus is the best known and most elaborate of the main [[Antonine]] group, and shows both considerable similarities to the [[Great Ludovisi sarcophagus]], the late outlier from about 250, and a considerable contrast in style and mood.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 205&lt;/ref&gt;

The face of the general is unfinished, either because the sculptors awaited a model to work from, or they had produced the work speculatively with no specific commission. The general and his wife are also each shown twice on the lid frieze, together holding each other's hands at the centre, and singly at the ends, again with unfinished faces.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 93&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The unusually large [[Ludovisi Battle sarcophagus]] shows a chaotic battle scene between the Romans and barbarian foes.  At the centre, a young general wears no helmet nor wields any weapon and has emblem of [[Mithras]], the Persian god of light, truth, and victory over death carved into his forehead.  Several scholars have identified him as one of the sons of [[Trajan Decius]],&lt;ref name=GART/&gt; who died of plague.

=== Santa Maria Antiqua Sarcophagus ===
A sarcophagus from the church of [[Santa Maria Antiqua]] with philosopher, [[orant]], and [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament|New]] Testament scenes is [[Early Christian art]] in which displays the story of [[Jonah]] on the left one-third, heads of a praying woman and a seated man reading from a scroll which are unfinished (intended to be portraits of the deceased) in the center, and continuing on, Christ as [[Good Shepherd]], and the baptism of Christ.&lt;ref name=GART/&gt;

[[File:A Study of History.jpg|thumb|[[D. C. Somervell|Somervell's]] abridgement of Toynbee's ''[[A Study of History|magnum opus]]'']]

'''Arnold Joseph Toynbee''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|sep=,|CH|FBA}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɔɪ|n|b|i}}; 14 April 1889 – 22 October 1975) was a British [[historian]], [[philosopher of history]], research professor of [[comparative history|international history]] at the [[London School of Economics]] and the [[University of London]] and author of numerous books. Toynbee in the 1918–1950 period was a leading specialist on [[International relations|international affairs]].

He is best known for his 12-volume ''[[A Study of History]]'' (1934–1961). With his prodigious output of papers, articles, speeches and presentations, and numerous books translated into many languages, Toynbee was a widely read and discussed scholar in the [[1940s in sociology|1940s]] and [[1950s in sociology|1950s]].

==Biography==
Toynbee (born in [[London in the 1960s|London]] on 14 April 1889) was the son of Harry Valpy Toynbee (1861–1941), secretary of the [[Charity Organization Society]], and his wife Sarah Edith Marshall (1859–1939); his sister [[Jocelyn Toynbee]] was an archaeologist and art historian. Toynbee was the grandson of [[Joseph Toynbee]], nephew of the [[19th-century philosophy|19th-century]] economist [[Arnold Toynbee]] (1852–1883) and descendant of prominent British intellectuals for several generations. He won scholarships to [[Winchester College]] and [[Balliol College, Oxford]] ([[Literae Humaniores]], 1907-1911),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Orry|first1=Louise|title=Arnold Toynbee, Brief Lives|date=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0198600879|page=537}}&lt;/ref&gt; and studied briefly at the [[British School at Athens]], an experience that influenced the genesis of his philosophy about the decline of civilizations. 

In 1912 he became a tutor and fellow in ancient history at Balliol College, and in 1915 he began working for the intelligence department of the [[British Foreign Office]]. After serving as a delegate to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1919 he served as professor of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Modern Greece|modern Greek studies]] at the [[University of London]]. It was here that Toynbee was appointed to the [[Koraes Professor of Modern Greek and Byzantine History, Language and Literature |Koraes Chair of Modern Greek and Byzantine History, Language and Literature]] at [[King's College London|King's College]], although he would ultimately resign following a controversial academic dispute with the professoriate of the College.&lt;ref name="kcl.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/classics/about/index.aspx | title=King's College London - Classics at King's}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 4283087|title = Politics and the Academy: Arnold Toynbee and the Koraes Chair|journal = Middle Eastern Studies|volume = 21|issue = 4|pages = v–115|last1 = Clogg|first1 = Richard|year = 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1921 to 1922 he was the Manchester [[Guardian.co.uk|Guardian]] correspondent during the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)|Greco-Turkish War]], an experience that resulted in the publication of ''The Western Question in Greece and Turkey''.&lt;ref name=toynbee1922&gt;{{cite book |last=Toynbee |first=Arnold J. |title=The Western Question in Greece and Turkey: A Study in the Contact of Civilisations |url=http://louisville.edu/a-s/history/turks/WesternQuestion.pdf |year=1922 |location=London |publisher=[[Constable &amp; Robinson|Constable and Company Ltd.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925 he became research professor of international history at the [[London School of Economics]] and director of studies at the [[Royal Institute of International Affairs]] in London. He was elected a [[Fellow of the British Academy]] (FBA), the United Kingdoms national academy for the humanities and social sciences, in 1937.&lt;ref name="WWW"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Toynbee, Arnold Joseph |url=http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/10.1093/ww/9780199540891.001.0001/ww-9780199540884-e-160398 |website=[[Who Was Who]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=14 October 2018 |doi=10.1093/ww/9780199540891.001.0001/ww-9780199540884-e-160398 |date=1 December 2007|doi-broken-date=2018-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first marriage was to Rosalind Murray (1890–1967), daughter of [[Gilbert Murray]], in 1913; they had three sons, of whom [[Philip Toynbee]] was the second. They divorced in 1946; Toynbee then married his research assistant, Veronica M. Boulter (1893-1980), in the same year.&lt;ref name=mcneill1989p124&gt;{{cite book |last=McNeill |first=William H. |authorlink=William Hardy McNeill |title=Arnold J.

==Academic and cultural influence==
[[File:Toynbee1.jpg|thumb|Toynbee on the front cover of Time magazine, 17 March 1947. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,793438,00.html read the ''Time'' article]]]

Michael Lang says that for much of the twentieth century: 
{{quote|Toynbee was perhaps the world’s most read, translated, and discussed living scholar. His output was enormous, hundreds of books, pamphlets, and articles. Of these, scores were translated into thirty different languages....the critical reaction to Toynbee constitutes a veritable intellectual history of the midcentury: we find a long list of the period’s most important historians, [[Charles Austin Beard|Beard]], [[Fernand Braudel|Braudel]], [[R. G. Collingwood|Collingwood]], and so on.&lt;ref name=lang2011&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lang |first=Michael |title=Globalization and Global History in Toynbee |date=December 2011 |journal=[[Journal of World History]] |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=747–783 |doi=10.1353/jwh.2011.0118 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=7 April 2014--&gt;{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his best-known work, ''[[A Study of History]]'', published 1934–1961, Toynbee:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...examined the rise and fall of 26 civilizations in the course of [[human history]], and he concluded that they rose by responding successfully to challenges under the leadership of creative minorities composed of elite leaders.&lt;ref name=EBonlineToynbee&gt;{{cite web |title= Arnold Toynbee |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/601310/Arnold-Joseph-Toynbee |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] Online Academic Edition |publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. |date= 6 Apr 2014 |accessdate= 6 April 2014}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''A Study of History'' was both a commercial and academic phenomenon. In the U.S. alone, more than seven thousand sets of the ten-volume edition had been sold by 1955. Most people, including scholars, relied on the very clear one-volume abridgement of the first six volumes by [[D. C. Somervell|Somervell]], which appeared in 1947; the abridgement sold over 300,000 copies in the U.S. The press printed innumerable discussions of Toynbee's work, not to mention there being countless lectures and seminars. Toynbee himself often participated. He appeared on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine in 1947, with an article describing his work as "the most provocative work of historical theory written in England since Karl Marx’s ''Capital''”,&lt;ref name=kennan1989&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kennan |first=George F. |authorlink=George F. Kennan|title=The History of Arnold Toynbee |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1989/jun/01/the-history-of-arnold-toynbee/?pagination=false |date=1 June 1989 |journal=[[The New York Review of Books]] |accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a regular commentator on [[BBC]] (examining the history of and reasons for the current hostility between east and west, and considering how non-westerners view the western world).&lt;ref name=montagu1956&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Montagu |editor1-first=M.

Canadian historians were especially receptive to Toynbee's work in the late [[1940s in sociology|1940s]]. The Canadian economic historian [[Harold Adams Innis]] (1894–1952) was a notable example. Following Toynbee and others (Spengler, Kroeber, Sorokin, Cochrane), Innis examined the flourishing of civilizations in terms of administration of empires and media of communication.&lt;ref name=massolin2001&gt;{{cite book |last=Massolin |first=Philip Alphonse |title=Canadian Intellectuals, the Tory Tradition, and the Challenge of Modernity, 1939–1970 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8fL-lB1VJ4wC&amp;pg=PA162 |year=2001 |publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]] |isbn=978-0802035097 |page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toynbee's overall theory was taken up by some scholars, for example, [[Ernst Robert Curtius]], as a sort of paradigm in the post-war period. Curtius wrote as follows in the opening pages of ''European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages'' (1953 English translation), following close on Toynbee, as he sets the stage for his vast study of [[medieval Latin]] literature. Curtius wrote, "How do cultures, and the historical entities which are their media, arise, grow and decay? Only a comparative morphology with exact procedures can hope to answer these questions. It was Arnold J.

After 1960, Toynbee's ideas faded both in academia and the media, to the point of seldom being cited today.&lt;ref name=mcintire1989&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=McIntire |editor1-first=C.

For example, Diamond writes in ''Collapse'' that if the elites are insulated from problems in society and not actively engaged, they are more apt to make mistakes. Thus, Diamond may be stating that elites can not mount effective responses to challenges if their knowledge, sympathy, or own self-interest are not sufficiently the same as the broader society.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Political influence in foreign policy==
&lt;blockquote&gt; While the writing of the Study was under way, Toynbee produced numerous smaller works and served as director of foreign research of the Royal Institute of International Affairs (1939–43) and director of the research department of the Foreign Office (1943–46); he also retained his position at the London School of Economics until his retirement in 1956.&lt;ref name=EBonlineToynbee/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Toynbee worked for the [[Political Intelligence Department (1918–1920)|Political Intelligence Department]] of the [[Foreign Office|British Foreign Office]] during [[World War I]] and served as a delegate to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1919. He was director of studies at Chatham House, Balliol College, Oxford University, 1924–43. Chatham House conducted research for the British Foreign Office and was an important intellectual resource during World War II when it was transferred to London. With his research assistant, Veronica M. Boulter, Toynbee was co-editor of the RIIA's annual ''Survey of International Affairs,'' which became the "bible" for international specialists in Britain.&lt;ref name=mcneill1989&gt;{{cite book |last=McNeill |first=William H. |authorlink=William Hardy McNeill |title=Arnold J.

===Meeting with Adolf Hitler===
While on a visit in Berlin in 1936 to address the Nazi Law Society, Toynbee was invited to have a private interview with [[Adolf Hitler]], at Hitler's request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brody |first=J. Kenneth |title=The Avoidable War—Volume 2: Pierre Laval and the Politics of Reality, 1935–1936 |date=1 October 1999 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |isbn=978-0765806222|title-link=Pierre Laval }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler emphasized his limited expansionist aim of building a greater German nation, and his desire for British understanding and cooperation. Toynbee believed that Hitler was sincere and endorsed Hitler's message in a confidential memorandum for the British prime minister and foreign secretary.&lt;ref name=mcneill1989ch8&gt;{{cite book |last=McNeill |first=William H. |authorlink=William Hardy McNeill |title=Arnold J.

===Russia===
Toynbee was troubled by the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], for he saw Russia as a non-Western society and the revolution as a threat to Western society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Paquette |first=Gabriel B. |title=The Impact of the 1917 Russian Revolutions on Arnold J.

He portrayed the Cold War as  a religious competition that pitted a Marxist materialist heresy against the West's spiritual Christian heritage—a heritage that had already been foolishly rejected by a secularized West. A heated debate ensued; an editorial in ''The Times'' promptly attacked Toynbee for treating communism as a "spiritual force".&lt;ref name=mcneill1989p464-5&gt;{{cite book |last=McNeill |first=William H. |authorlink=William Hardy McNeill |title=Arnold J.

===Greece and the Middle East===
Toynbee was a leading analyst of developments in the Middle East.  His support for Greece and hostility to the Turks during World War I had gained him an appointment to the Koraes Chair of Modern Greek and Byzantine History at [[King's College London|King's College, University of London]].&lt;ref name="kcl.ac.uk"/&gt; However, after the war he changed to a pro-Turkish position, accusing Greece's military government in occupied Turkish territory of atrocities and massacres. This earned him the enmity of the wealthy Greeks who had endowed the chair, and in 1924 he was forced to resign the position.

His stance during World War I reflected less sympathy for the Arab cause and took a pro-Zionist outlook. He also expressed support for a [[Jewish State]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], which he believed had "begun to recover its ancient prosperity" as a result. Toynbee investigated [[Zionism]] in 1915 at the Information Department of the Foreign Office, and in 1917 he published a memorandum with his colleague [[Lewis Namier]] which supported exclusive Jewish political rights in Palestine. In 1922, however, he was influenced by the Palestine Arab delegation which was visiting London, and began to adopt their views. His subsequent writings reveal his changing outlook on the subject, and by the late 1940s he had moved away from the Zionist cause and toward the Arab camp.

The views Toynbee expressed in the 1950s continued to oppose the formation of a Jewish state, partly out of his concern that it would increase the risk of a nuclear confrontation. However, as a result of Toynbee's debate in January 1961 with Dr. [[Yaakov Herzog]], the Israeli ambassador to Canada, Toynbee softened his view and called on Israel to fulfill its special "mission to make contributions to worldwide efforts to prevent the outbreak of nuclear war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Friedman |first=Isaiah |title=Arnold Toynbee: Pro-Arab or Pro-Zionist? |url= http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/israel_studies/v004/4.1friedman.html |date=Spring 1999 |journal=Israel Studies |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=73–95 |doi=10.1353/is.1999.0019 |accessdate=11 April 2014}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=This is how we ruined Toynbee's theory |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/this-is-how-we-ruined-toynbee-s-theory-1.210993|newspaper=Haaretz |accessdate=19 December 2014|date=2007-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his article "Jewish Rights in Palestine",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 1453271|title = Jewish Rights in Palestine|journal = The Jewish Quarterly Review|volume = 52|issue = 1|pages = 1|last1 = Toynbee|first1 = Arnold J|doi = 10.2307/1453271|year = 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; he challenged the views of the editor of the [[Jewish Quarterly Review]], historian and talmudic scholar [[Solomon Zeitlin]], who published his rebuke, "Jewish Rights in Eretz Israel (Palestine)"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 1453272|title = Jewish Rights in Eretz Israel (Palestine)|journal = The Jewish Quarterly Review|volume = 52|issue = 1|pages = 12|last1 = Zeitlin|first1 = Solomon|doi = 10.2307/1453272|year = 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the same issue.&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Rights in Palestine (pp. 1-11); Arnold J.

{{quote|"population’s human rights to their homes and property over-ride all other rights in cases where claims conflict." He did concede that the Jews, "being the only surviving representatives of any of the pre-Arab inhabitants of Palestine, have a further claim to a national home in Palestine." But that claim, he held, is valid "only in so far as it can be implemented without injury to the rights and to the legitimate interests of the native Arab population of Palestine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jta.org/1961/12/01/archive/prof-toynbee-rebuked-by-u-s-scholar-for-renewed-attack-on-jews | title=Prof. Toynbee Rebuked by U.S. Scholar for Renewed Attack on Jews| date=December 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Dialogue with Daisaku Ikeda===
In 1972, Toynbee met with [[Daisaku Ikeda]], president of [[Soka Gakkai International]] (SGI), who condemned the "demonic nature" of the use of nuclear weapons under any circumstances. Toynbee had the view that the atomic bomb was an invention that had caused warfare to escalate from a political scale to catastrophic proportions and threatened humanity's very existence. In his dialogue with Ikeda, Toynbee stated his worry that humankind would not be able to strengthen ethical behavior and achieve self-mastery "in spite of the widespread awareness that the price of failing to respond to the moral challenge of the atomic age may be the self-liquidation of our species."

The two men first met on 5 May 1972 in London. In May 1973, Ikeda again flew to London to meet with Toynbee for 40 hours over a period of 10 days. Their dialogue and ongoing correspondence culminated in the publication of ''Choose Life'', a record of their views on critical issues confronting humanity. The book has been published in 24 languages to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Choose Life—Arnold Toynbee and Daisaku Ikeda" Exhibition Opens in Hiroshima |url=http://www.sgi.org/news/c-activities/ce2005/ce050723.html |date=23 July 2005 |website=[[Soka Gakkai|Soka Gakkai International]] |accessdate=13 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053522/http://www.sgi.org/news/c-activities/ce2005/ce050723.html |archivedate=21 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Toynbee also wrote the foreword to the English edition of Ikeda's best-known book, ''The Human Revolution'', which has sold more than 7 million copies worldwide.&lt;ref name=humanrevolution&gt;{{cite book |last=Ikeda |first=Daisaku |authorlink= |title=The Human Revolution |location=Santa Monica |publisher=World Tribune Press |year=2004 |at=Preface |isbn=978-0915678778}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An exhibition celebrating the 30th anniversary of Toynbee and Ikeda's first meeting was presented in SGI's centers around the world in 2005, showcasing contents of the dialogues between them, as well as Ikeda's discussions for peace with over 1,500 of the world's scholars, intellects, and activists. Original letters Toynbee and Ikeda exchanged were also displayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Thirtieth Anniversary of Toynbee-Ikeda Dialogue |url=http://www.sgiquarterly.org/news2003Jan-4.html |journal=SGI Quarterly |date=January 2003 |accessdate=13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 his granddaughter [[Polly Toynbee]] wrote a critical article for ''[[The Guardian]]'' on meeting Daisaku Ikeda.&lt;ref name=ToynbeeP1984&gt;{{cite news |last=Toynbee |first=Polly |title=The Value of a Grandfather Figure |newspaper=[[Manchester Guardian]] |date=19 May 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenge and response&lt;!--'Toynbee's law of challenge and response' redirects here--&gt;==
With the civilizations as units identified, he presented the history of each in terms of challenge-and-response, sometimes referred to as theory about the law of challenge and response. Civilizations arose in response to some set of challenges of extreme difficulty, when "creative minorities" devised solutions that reoriented their entire society. Challenges and responses were physical, as when the [[Sumer]]ians exploited the intractable swamps of southern [[Iraq]] by organizing the Neolithic inhabitants into a society capable of carrying out large-scale irrigation projects; or social, as when the Catholic Church resolved the chaos of post-Roman Europe by enrolling the new Germanic kingdoms in a single religious community. When a civilization responded to challenges, it grew. Civilizations disintegrate when their leaders stopped responding creatively, and the civilizations then sank owing to nationalism, militarism, and the tyranny of a despotic minority. According to an Editor's Note in an edition of Toynbee's ''A Study of History,'' Toynbee believed that societies always die from suicide or murder rather than from natural causes, and nearly always from suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arnold J. Toynbee|title=A Study of History: Abridgement of Volumes I to VI|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IbJ-31LPvyoC&amp;pg=PA273|year=1947|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=273|isbn=9780199826698}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He sees the growth and decline of civilizations as a spiritual process, writing that "Man achieves civilization, not as a result of superior biological endowment or geographical environment, but as a response to a challenge in a situation of special difficulty which rouses him to make a hitherto unprecedented effort." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Graeme Snooks|title=The Laws of History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3vkvMpiag-gC&amp;pg=PA91|year=2002|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=91|isbn=9780203452448}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arnold J.

==Toynbee Prize Foundation==
&lt;blockquote&gt;Named after Arnold J. Toynbee, the [Toynbee Prize] Foundation was chartered in 1987 'to contribute to the development of the [[social sciences]], as defined from a broad historical view of human society and of human and social problems.' In addition to awarding the Toynbee Prize, the foundation sponsors scholarly engagement with global history through sponsorship of sessions at the annual meeting of the [[American Historical Association]], of international conferences, of the  journal ''New Global Studies'' and of the Global History Forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Toynbee Prize Foundation |url=http://toynbeeprize.org/toynbee-prize-foundation/ |publisher=Toynbee Foundation |accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Toynbee Prize is an honorary award, recognizing social scientists for significant [[academic]] and public contributions to humanity. Currently, it is awarded every other year for work that makes a significant contribution to the study of global history. The recipients have been [[Raymond Aron]], [[Lord Kenneth Clark]], Sir [[Ralf Dahrendorf]], [[Natalie Zemon Davis]], [[Albert Hirschman]], [[George F. Kennan|George Kennan]], [[Bruce Mazlish]], [[John McNeill (botanist)|John McNeill]], [[William McNeill (historian)|William McNeill]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Arthur Schlesinger Jr|Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.]], [[Barbara Ward]], [[Lady Jackson]], [[Sir Brian Urquhart]], [[Michael Adas]], [[Christopher Bayly]], and [[Jürgen Osterhammel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://toynbeeprize.org/global-history-blog/the-2017-toynbee-prize-lecture-arnold-toynbee-and-the-problems-of-today-jurgen-osterhammel/|title=The 2017 Toynbee Prize Lecture: "Arnold Toynbee and the Problems of Today" (Jürgen Osterhammel) {{!}} Toynbee Prize Foundation|website=toynbeeprize.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Toynbee's ideas also feature in the [[Ray Bradbury]] [[short story]] named "[[The Toynbee Convector]]". He appears alongside [[T. E. Lawrence]] as a character in an episode of ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'', dealing with the post-[[World War I]] treaty negotiations at [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles]].  He also receives a brief mention in the [[Charles Harness]] classic, ''The Paradox Men'' (a working title was ''Toynbee 22''). [[Frederick Buechner]] also mentions him in the 1957 novel ''The return of Ansel Gibbs''. Most versions of the ''[[Civilization (video game)|Civilization]]'' computer game refer to his work as a historian as well. Toynbee receives mention in Pat Frank's post-apocalyptic novel "[[Alas, Babylon]]". A character in the P. Schuyler Miller short story "As Never Was" adopts the name Toynbee "out of admiration for a historian of that name". He is also mentioned in the [[Tom Robbins]] novel, ''[[Another Roadside Attraction]]''. The [[Toynbee tiles]] may be a reference to Toynbee.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="60564">'''Autoethnography''' is a form of [[qualitative research]] in which an author uses [[self-reflection]] and writing to explore anecdotal and personal experience and connect this autobiographical story to wider cultural, political, and social meanings and understandings.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Carolyn. (2004). ''The ethnographic I: A methodological novel about autoethnography.'' Walnut Creek: AltaMira Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maréchal, Garance. (2010). Autoethnography. In Albert J. Mills, Gabrielle Durepos &amp; Elden Wiebe (Eds.), ''Encyclopedia of case study research'' (Vol. 2, pp. 43-45). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications&lt;/ref&gt; Autoethnography is a self-reflective form of writing used across various disciplines such as [[communication studies]], [[performance studies]], education, [[English literature]], [[anthropology]], [[social work]], [[sociology]], [[history]], [[psychology]], [[religious studies]], [[Marketing information system|marketing]], [[Business administration|business]] and [[Academic administration|educational administration]], [[Visual arts education|arts education]], and [[Physical therapy|physiotherapy]].

According to Maréchal (2010), "autoethnography is a form or method of research that involves self-observation and reflexive investigation in the context of ethnographic field work and writing" (p.&amp;nbsp;43). A well-known autoethnographer, [[Carolyn Ellis]] (2004) defines it as "research, writing, story, and method that connect the autobiographical and personal to the cultural, social, and political" (p. xix). However, it is not easy to reach a consensus on the term's definition. For instance, in the 1970s, autoethnography was more narrowly defined as "insider ethnography," referring to studies of the (culture of) a group of which the researcher is a member (Hayano, 1979). Nowadays, however, as Ellingson and [[Carolyn Ellis|Ellis]] (2008) point out, "the meanings and applications of autoethnography have evolved in a manner that makes precise definition difficult" (p.&amp;nbsp;449).

According to Adams, Jones, and Ellis in ''Autoethnography: Understanding Qualitative Research'', "Autoethnography is a research method that: Uses a researcher's personal experience to describe and critique cultural beliefs, practices, and experiences. Acknowledges and values a researcher's relationships with others. . . . Shows 'people in the process of figuring out what to do, how to live, and the meaning of their struggles'" (Adams, 2015). "Social life is messy, uncertain, and emotional. If our desire to research social life, then we must embrace a research method that, to the best of its/our ability, acknowledges and accommodates mess and chaos, uncertainty and emotion" (Adams, 2015).

==History==

1970s: The term autoethnography was used to describe studies in which cultural members provide insight about their own cultures. [[Walter Goldschmidt]] proposed that all "autoethnography" is focused around the self and reveals, "personal investments, interpretations, and analyses." &lt;ref&gt;Goldschmidt, Walter. "Anthropology and the Coming Crisis: An Autoethnographic Appraisal." ''Anthropologist'' 79, no. 2 (1977): 293-08.&lt;/ref&gt; David M. Hayano was an Associate Professor of Anthropology at [[California State University]] in Northridge. As an anthropologist, Hayano was interested in the role that an individual's own identity had in their research. Unlike more traditional research methods, Hayano believed there was value in a researcher "conducting and writing ethnographies of their own people." &lt;ref&gt;Hayano, David M. "Auto-Ethnography: Paradigms, Problems, and Prospects." Human Organization 38, no. 1 (1979): 99-104.&lt;/ref&gt;

1980s: Scholars became interested in the importance of culture and storytelling as they gradually became more engaged through the personal aspects in ethnographic practices. At the end of the 1980s, the scholars applied the term "autoethnography" to work that explored the interplay of introspective, personally engaged selves and cultural beliefs, practices, systems, and experiences.

1990s: Emphasis began to be heavily placed on personal narratives and expansion of "autoethnography" use. Series such as ''Ethnographic Alternatives'' and the first ''Handbook of Qualitative Research'' were published to better explain the importance of autoethnographic use..

==Epistemological and theoretical basis==

Autoethnography differs from [[ethnography]], a social research method employed by anthropologists and sociologists, in that autoethnography embraces and foregrounds the researcher's [[subjectivity]] rather than attempting to limit it, as in empirical research. While ethnography tends to be understood as a qualitative method in the [[social science]]s that describes human social phenomena based on fieldwork, autoethnographers are themselves the primary participant/subject of the research in the process of writing personal stories and narratives. Autoethnography "as a form of ethnography," [[Carolyn Ellis|Ellis]] (2004) writes, is "part ''auto'' or self and part ''ethno'' or culture" (p.&amp;nbsp;31) and "something different from both of them, greater than its parts" (p.&amp;nbsp;32). In other words, as Ellingson and Ellis (2008) put it, "whether we call a work an ''autoethnography'' or an ''ethnography'' depends as much on the claims made by authors as anything else" (p.&amp;nbsp;449).

In embracing personal thoughts, feelings, stories, and observations as a way of understanding the social context they are studying, autoethnographers are also shedding light on their total interaction with that setting by making their every emotion and thought visible to the reader. This is much the opposite of theory-driven, hypothesis-testing research methods that are based on the [[positivism|positivist]] epistemology. In this sense, Ellingson and Ellis (2008) see autoethnography as a social constructionist project that rejects the deep-rooted binary oppositions between the researcher and the researched, objectivity and subjectivity, process and product, self and others, art and science, and the personal and the political (pp.&amp;nbsp;450–459). Dr Ian McCormick has outlined many of the [https://www.academia.edu/1902388/A_concise_outline_of_auto-ethnography_with_a_summary_of_its_benefits benefits] of combining visual technologies (such as film) with participant-led community development.

Autoethnographers, therefore, tend to reject the concept of social research as an objective and neutral knowledge produced by scientific methods, which can be characterized and achieved by detachment of the researcher from the researched. Autoethnography, in this regard, is a critical "response to the alienating effects on both researchers and audiences of impersonal, passionless, abstract claims of truth generated by such research practices and clothed in exclusionary scientific discourse" (Ellingson &amp; Ellis, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;450). Anthropologist Deborah Reed-Danahay (1997) also argues that autoethnography is a postmodernist construct:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The concept of autoethnography…synthesizes both a postmodern ethnography, in which the realist conventions and objective observer position of standard ethnography have been called into question, and a postmodern autobiography, in which the notion of the coherent, individual self has been similarly called into question. The term has a double sense - referring either to the ethnography of one's own group or to autobiographical writing that has ethnographic interest. Thus, either a self- (auto-) ethnography or an autobiographical (auto-) ethnography can be signaled by "autoethnography. (p. 2)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Types, areas, and approaches of autoethnography==
Since autoethnography is a broad and ambiguous "category that encompasses a wide array of practices" (Ellingson &amp; Ellis, 2008, pp.&amp;nbsp;449–450), autoethnographies "vary in their emphasis on the writing and research process (''graphy''), culture (''ethnos''), and self (''auto'')" (Reed-Danahay, 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;2). According to Ellingson and Ellis (2008), autoethnographers recently began to make distinction between two types of autoethnography; one is analytic autoethnography and the other is evocative autoethnography.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Analytic autoethnographers focus on developing theoretical explanations of broader social phenomena, whereas evocative autoethnographers focus on narrative presentations that open up conversations and evoke emotional responses. (p. 445)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A special issue of the ''[[Journal of Contemporary Ethnography]]'' (Vol 35, Issue 4, August 2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jce.sagepub.com/content/35/4|title=Table of Contents|work=sagepub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; contains several articles on the diverse definitions and uses of autoethnography. An autoethnography can be analytical (see Leon Anderson), written in the style of a novel (see [[Carolyn Ellis|Carolyn Ellis's]] methodological novel ''The Ethnographic I''), performative (see the work of Norman K. Denzin, and the anthology ''The Ends of Performance'') and many things in between.

[[Symbolic interactionism|Symbolic interactionists]] are particularly interested in this method, and examples of autoethnography can be found in a number of scholarly journals, such as ''[[Qualitative Inquiry]]'', the ''Journal of the Society for the Study of Symbolic Interactionism'', the ''Journal of Contemporary Ethnography'', and the ''Journal of Humanistic Ethnography''. It is not considered "mainstream" as a method by most positivist or traditional ethnographers, yet this approach to qualitative inquiry is rapidly increasing in popularity, as can be seen by the large number of scholarly papers on autoethnography presented at annual conferences such as the International Congress of Qualitative Inquiry, and the Advances in Qualitative Methods conference sponsored by the International Institute of Qualitative Methodology.  The spread of autoethnography into other fields is also growing (e.g., psychology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McIlveen|first=P.|date=2007-12-06|title=The Genuine Scientist-practitioner in Vocational Psychology: An Autoethnography|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/14780880701522403|journal=Qualitative Research in Psychology|volume=4|issue=4|pages=295–311|doi=10.1080/14780880701522403|issn=1478-0887|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McIlveen|first=P.|last2=Beccaria|first2=G.|last3=du Preez|first3=Jan.|last4=Patton|first4=W.|date=|title=Autoethnography in Vocational Psychology: Wearing Your Class on Your Sleeve|url=http://mr.crossref.org/iPage?doi=10.1177%2F0894845309357048|journal=Journal of Career Development|volume=37|issue=3|pages=599–615|doi=10.1177/0894845309357048|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and a recent special issue of the journal ''Culture and Organization'' (Volume 13, Issue 3, Summer 2007) explores the idea of organizational autoethnography.

Autoethnography in performance studies acknowledges the researcher and the audience having equal weight. Portraying the performed "self" through writing then becomes an aim to create an embodied experience for the writer and the reader. This area acknowledges the inward and outward experience of ethnography in experiencing the subjectivity of the author. Audience members may experience the work of ethnography through reading/hearing/feeling (inward) and then have a reaction to it (outward), maybe by emotion. Ethnography and performance work together to invoke emotion in the reader.

Higher education is also featuring more as the contextual backdrop for autoethnography probably due to the convenience of researching one's own organisation (see Sambrook, Stewart, &amp; Roberts, 2008; Doloriert &amp; Sambrook, 2009, 2011). Such contributions explore the autoethnographer as a researcher/ teacher/ administrator doing scholarly work and/or as an employee working in Higher Education. Recent contributions include Humphreys' (2005) exploration of career change, Pelias' (2003) performance narrative telling of the competing pressures faced by an early career academic and Sparkes' (2007) heartfelt story of an academic manager during the stressful Research Assessment Exercise (2008). There are several contributions that are insightful for the student autoethnographer including Sambrook, et al. (2008) who explore power and emotion in the student-supervisor relationship, Doloriert and Sambrook (2009) who explore the ethics of the student autoreveal, Rambo (2007) and her experiences with review boards, and finally Doloriert &amp; Sambrook (2011) discussion on managing creativity and innovation within a PhD thesis.

Researchers have begun to explore the intersection of diversity, transformative learning, and autoethnography. Glowacki-Dudka, Treff, and Usman (2005) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alx.sagepub.com/content/16/3-4/30.extract|title=Research for Social Change: Using Autoethnography to Foster Transformative Learning|work=sagepub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; first proposed autoethnography as a tool to encourage diverse learners to share diverse worldviews in the classroom and other settings. Both transformative learning and autoethnography are steeped in an epistemological worldview that reality is ever-changing and largely based on individual reflexivity. Drick Boyd (2008) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jtd.sagepub.com/content/6/3/212.short|title=Autoethnography as a Tool for Transformative Learning About White Privilege|work=sagepub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; examines the impact of  white privilege on a diverse group of individuals. Through the autoethnographical process and transformative learning he comes to appreciate the impact of "whiteness" on his own actions and those of others.  Similarly, Brent Sykes (2014) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alx.sagepub.com/content/25/1/3.short|title=Transformative Autoethnography|work=sagepub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; employs autoethnography to make meaning of his identity as both Native American and caucasian. In his implications, he challenges higher education institutions and educators to provide spaces for learners to engage in autoethnography as a tool to promote transformative learning.

Another recent extension of autoethnographic method involves the use of collaborative approaches to writing, sharing, and analyzing personal stories of experience. This approach is also labeled "collaborative autobiography" (Allen-Collinson &amp; Hockey, 2001; Lapadat, 2009), and has been used in teaching qualitative research methods to university students.

Autoethnography is also used in film as a variant of the standard [[documentary film]]. It differs from the traditional documentary film, in that its subject is the filmmaker himself or herself. An autoethnography typically relates the life experiences and thoughts, views and beliefs of the filmmaker, and as such it is often considered to be rife with bias and image manipulation. Unlike other documentaries, autoethnographies do not usually make a claim of objectivity. An important text on autoethnography in filmmaking is Catherine Russell's ''Experimental Ethnography: The Work of Film in the Age of Video'' (Duke UP, 1999). For Autoethnographic artists, see also [[Jesse Cornplanter]], [[Kimberly Dark]], [[Peter Pitseolak]], [[Ernest Spybuck]].

Autoethnography is being used in multiple subdisciplines in Communication and Media Studies. For example, Bob Krizek took an autoethnographic approach to sports communication during the closing of Comisky Park.&lt;ref&gt;Krizek, R. L. (1992a). Goodbye old friend: A son's farewell to Comiskey Park. Omega, 25, 87–93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krizek, R. L. (1992b). Remembrances and expectations: The investment of identity in the changing of Comiskey. Elysian Fields Quarterly, 11, 30–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Tony Adams utilized autoethnography to examine gay identity and the metaphor of "coming out of the closet." &lt;ref&gt;Adams, T. E. (2011). Narrating the closet: An autoethnography of same-sex attraction. Walnut Creek, CA: Left Coast Press, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew F. Herrmann examined a period of unemployment during the financial crisis through an autoethnographic approach.&lt;ref&gt;Herrmann, A. F. (2012). "I know I'm unlovable": Desperation, dislocation, despair, and discourse on the academic job hunt. Qualitative Inquiry, 18, 247–255.&lt;/ref&gt; Autoethnographic approaches are also being used in family and interpersonal communication research.&lt;ref&gt;Poulos, C. N. (2014). My father's ghost: A story of encounter and transcendence. Qualitative Inquiry.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bochner, A. P. (2012). Bird on the wire: Freeing the father within me. Qualitative Inquiry, 18, 168–173.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herrmann, A. F. (2011). ''Losing things was nothing new'': A family's story of foreclosure. Journal of Loss and Trauma, 16, 497–510.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herrmann, A. F. (2005). My father's ghost: Interrogating family photos. Journal of Loss and Trauma, 10, 337–346&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herrmann, A. F. (2014). The ghostwriter: Living a father's unfinished narrative. In J. Wyatt &amp; T. E. Adams (Eds.), On (writing) families: Autoethnographies of presence and absence, love and loss (pp. 95–102). Rotterdam: Sense&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foster, E. (2002). Storm tracking: Scenes of marital disintegration. Qualitative Inquiry, 8, 804–819.&lt;/ref&gt;

Autoethnography is being used to examine popular culture artifacts and our relationships with pop culture. As Herrmann (2013) wrote, "Our identities and identifications with popular culture artifacts assist in our creation of self. Our identities and pop culture have a long-term recursive relationship" (p.&amp;nbsp;7).&lt;ref&gt;Herrmann, A. F. (2013). Daniel Amos and Me: The Power of Pop Culture and Autoethnography. The Popular Culture Studies Journal, 1, 6-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Jimmie Manning and Tony Adams (2015) noted five strengths for autoethnographic approaches to popular culture, including "1) use personal experience to write alongside [[popular culture]] theories and texts, especially to show how personal experiences resemble or are informed by popular culture; 2) use personal experience to criticize, write against, and talk back to popular culture texts, especially texts that do not match their personal experiences or that espouse harmful messages; 3) describe how they personally act as audience members, specifically how they use, engage, and relate to popular texts, events, and/or celebrities; 4) describe the processes that contribute to the production of popular culture texts; and 5) create accessible research texts that can be understood by a variety of audiences." (p.&amp;nbsp;199-200).&lt;ref&gt;Manning, J., &amp; Adams, T. E. (2015). Connecting the Personal and the Popular: Autoethnography and Popular Culture.

Similarly, autoethnography is becoming more widely accepted as a method by which to study organizations. According to Parry and Boyle, organizational autoethnography illuminates the relationship between the individual and the organization, especially culture as it is practiced and understood within institutional and organizational settings.&lt;ref&gt;Parry, K. &amp; Boyle, M.

London, UK: SAGE&lt;/ref&gt;  As Maree Boyle and Ken Parry noted, "organizational autoethnographies can provide first-hand accounts of taboo topics such as sexual harassment and bullying, motherhood at work, various moral dilemmas and highly charged emotional situations in the workplace" (p.&amp;nbsp;189).&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, M. &amp; Parry, K.

===Storyteller/narrator===

In different academic disciplines (particularly communication studies and performance studies), the term autoethnography itself is contested and is sometimes used interchangeably with or referred to as personal narrative or autobiography. Autoethnographic methods include journaling, looking at archival records - whether institutional or personal, interviewing one's own self, and using writing to generate a self-cultural understandings. Reporting an autoethnography might take the form of a traditional journal article or scholarly book, performed on the stage, or be seen in the popular press. Autoethnography can include direct (and participant) observation of daily behavior; unearthing of local beliefs and perception and recording of life history (e.g. kinship, education, etc.); and in-depth interviewing: "The analysis of data involves interpretation on the part of the researcher" (Hammersley in Genzuk). However, rather than a portrait of the Other (person, group, culture), the difference is that the researcher is constructing a portrait of the self.

Autoethnography can also be "associated with [[narrative inquiry]] and [[autobiography]]" (Maréchal, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;43) in that it foregrounds experience and story as a [[meaning-making]] enterprise. Maréchal argues that "narrative inquiry can provoke identification, feelings, emotions, and dialogue" (p.&amp;nbsp;45). Furthermore, the increased focus on incorporating autoethnography and Narrative Inquiry into qualitative research indicates a growing concern for how the style of academic writing informs the types of claims made. As Laurel Richardson articulates "I consider writing as a method of inquiry, a way of finding out about a topic...form and content are inseparable" (2000, p.&amp;nbsp;923). For many researchers, experimenting with alternative forms of writing and reporting, including autoethnography, personal narrative, performative writing, layered accounts and writing stories, provides a way to create multiple layered accounts of a research study, creating not only the opportunity to create new and provocative claims but also the ability to do so in a compelling manner. Ellis (2004) says that autoethnographers advocate "the conventions of literary writing and expression" in that "autoethnographic forms feature concrete action, emotion, embodiment, self-consciousness, and introspection portrayed in dialogue, scenes, characterization, and plot" (p. xix).

According to [[Art Bochner|Bochner]] and [[Carolyn Ellis|Ellis]] (2006), an autoethnographer is "first and foremost a communicator and a storyteller." In other words, autoethnography "depicts people struggling to overcome adversity" and shows "people in the process of figuring out what to do, how to live, and the meaning of their struggles" (p.&amp;nbsp;111). Therefore, according to them, autoethnography is "ethical practice" and "gifts" that has a caregiving function (p.&amp;nbsp;111). In essence autoethnography is a story that re-enacts an experience by which people find meaning and through that meaning are able to be okay with that experience.

In Dewan's (2017) opinion this can be a problem because many readers may see us as being too self-indulgent but they have to realise that our stories and experiences we share are not solely ours, but rather that they also represent the group we are autoethnographically representing &lt;ref&gt;(Mayukh, D. (2017). My vegetarian experience: an autoethnographic approach. Asia-Pacific Journal of Innovation in Hospitality and Tourism, 6(1), 15-32.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In this storytelling process, the researcher seeks to make meaning of a disorienting experience. A life example in which autoethnography could be applied is the death of a family member or someone close by. In this painful experience people often wonder how they will go about living without this person and what it will be like. In this scenario, especially in religious homes, one often asks "Why God?" thinking that with an answer as to why the person died they can go about living. Others, wanting to be able to offer up an explanation to make the person feel better, generally say things such as "At least they are in a better place." or "God wanted him/her home.". People, who are never really left with an explanation as to why, generally fall back on the reason that "it was their time to go" and through this somewhat "explanation" find themselves able to move on and keep living life. Over time when looking back at the experience of someone close to you dying, one may find that through this hardship they became a stronger more independent person, or that they grew closer to other family members. With these realizations, the person has actually made sense of and has become fine with the tragic experience that occurred. And through this autoethnography is performed.

==Evaluation==
The main critique of autoethnography — and [[qualitative research]] in general — comes from the traditional social science methods that emphasize the objectivity of social research. In this critique, qualitative researchers are often called "journalists, or soft scientists," and their work, including autoethnography, is "termed unscientific, or only exploratory, or entirely personal and full of bias".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Denzin|first1=N|title=Aesthetics and Qualitative Inquiry|journal=Qualitative Inquiry|date=2000|volume=6|issue=2|pages=256–260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[quantitative research]]ers regard the materials produced by narrative as "the means by which a narrating subject, autonomous and independent...can achieve authenticity...This represents an almost total failure to use narrative to achieve serious social analysis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atkinson|first1=Paul|title=Narrative Turn or Blind Alley|journal=Qualitative Health Research|date=1997|volume=7|issue=3|page=339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Maréchal (2010), the early criticism of autobiographical methods in anthropology was about "their validity on grounds of being unrepresentative and lacking objectivity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marechal|first1=G|last2=Mills|first2=A.J|last3=Durepos|first3=G|last4=Wiebe|first4=E|title=Encyclopedia of case study research|date=2010|publisher=Sage Publications|location=Thousand Oaks, CA |pages=43–45|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also points out that evocative and emotional genres of autoethnography have been criticized by mostly analytic proponents for their "lack of ethnographic relevance as a result of being too personal." As she writes, they are criticized "for being biased, navel-gazing, self-absorbed, or emotionally incontinent, and for hijacking traditional ethnographic purposes and scholarly contribution".

The reluctance to accept narrative work as serious extends far beyond the realm of academia. In 1994, [[Arlene Croce]] refused to evaluate or even attend [[Bill T. Jones]] ''Still/Here'' performance. She echoed a quantitative stance towards narrative research by explaining

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I can't review someone I feel sorry or hopeless about...I'm ''forced'' to feel sorry because of the way they present themselves as: dissed blacks, abused women, or disenfranchised homosexuals - as performers, in short, who make victimhood victim art&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Croce|first1=Arlene|title=Writing in the Dark, Dancing in The New Yorker|date=2003|publisher=Farrar|location=Discussing the Undiscussable|pages=708–719}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Croce illustrates what Tony E. Adams, Stacy Holman Jones, and [[Carolyn Ellis]] refer to as "illusory boundaries and borders between scholarship and criticism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adams|first1=Tony E.|last2=Holman Jones|first2=Stacy|last3=Ellis|first3=Carolyn|title=Autoethnography: Understanding Qualitative Research|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-997209-8|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; These "borders" are seen to hide or take away from the idea that autoethnographic evaluation and criticism present another personal story about the experience of an experience. Or as Craig Gingrich-Philbrook wrote, "any evaluation of autoethnography...is simply another story from a highly situated, privileged, empowered subject about something he or she experienced".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gingrich-Philbrook|first1=Craig|title=Evaluating|journal=Liminalities: A Journal of Performance Studies|date=2009|volume=5|issue=1|page=618}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent philosopher of science, Karl Popper, when claiming that falsifiability was a basic criteria of a scientific theory said:&lt;blockquote&gt;A theory is falsifiable ... if there exists at least one non-empty class of homotypic basic statements which are forbidden by it&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Logic of Scientific Discovery|last=Popper|first=Karl|publisher=Routledge|year=1992|isbn=0415278449|location=London|pages=95|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;As autoethnography makes no claims that can be verified, it is no longer falsifiable. Under this criterion, autoethnography becomes pseudoscience.

===Rethinking traditional criteria===

In her book's tenth chapter, titled "Evaluating and Publishing Autoethnography" (pp.&amp;nbsp;252~255), [[Carolyn Ellis|Ellis]] (2004) discusses how to evaluate an autoethnographic project, based on other authors' ideas about evaluating alternative modes of qualitative research. (See the special section in ''Qualitative Inquiry'' on "Assessing Alternative Modes of Qualitative and Ethnographic Research: How Do We Judge? Who Judges?") She presents several criteria for "good autoethnography" mentioned by [[Art Bochner|Bochner]] (2000), Clough (2000), Denzin (2000) and Richardson (2000), and indicates how these ideas resonate with each other.

First, [[Carolyn Ellis|Ellis]] mentions Laurel Richardson (2000, pp.&amp;nbsp;15–16) who described five factors she uses when reviewing personal narrative papers that includes analysis of both evaluative and constructive validity techniques. The criteria are:

::(a) Substantive contribution. Does the piece contribute to our understanding of social life?
::(b) Aesthetic merit. Does this piece succeed aesthetically? Is the text artistically shaped, satisfyingly complex, and not boring?
::(c) Reflexivity. How did the author come to write this text? How has the author's subjectivity been both a producer and a product of this text?
::(d) Impactfulness. Does this affect me emotionally and/or intellectually? Does it generate new questions or move me to action?
::(e) Expresses a reality. Does this text embody a fleshed out sense of lived experience?

Autoethnographic manuscripts might include dramatic recall, unusual phrasing, and strong metaphors to invite the reader to "relive" events with the author.  These guidelines may provide a framework for directing investigators and reviewers alike.
Further, Ellis suggests how Richardson's criteria mesh with criteria mentioned by [[Art Bochner|Bochner]] who describes what makes him understand and feel with a story. (Bochner, 2000, pp.&amp;nbsp;264~266) He looks for concrete details (similar to Richardson's expression of lived experience), structurally complex narratives (Richardson's aesthetic merit), author's attempt to dig under the superficial to get to vulnerability and honesty (Richardson's reflexivity), a standard of ethical self-consciousness (Richardson's substantive contribution), and a moving story (Richardson's impact) (Ellis, 2004, pp.&amp;nbsp;253~254).

In 2015, [[Carolyn Ellis|Ellis]], Adams, and Jones collaborated to bring about a similar list of Goals for Assessing Autoethnography. The list takes encompasses [[Descriptive research|descriptive]], [[Normative ethics|prescriptive]], practical, and [[Theoretical definition|theoretical]] goals for evaluating autoethnographic work.

# Make contributions to knowledge
# Value the personal and experiential
# Demonstrate the power, craft, and responsibilities of stories and storytelling
# Take a relationally responsible approach to research practice and representation

==== Contributions to knowledge ====

Adams, [[Carolyn Ellis|Ellis]], and Jones define the first goal of autoethnography as a conscious effort to "extend existing knowledge and research while recognizing that knowledge is both situated and contested".&lt;ref name="Adams2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adams|first1=Tony E.|last2=Holman Jones|first2=Stacy|last3=Ellis|first3=Carolyn|title=Autoethnography: Understanding Qualitative Research|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=198 Madison Avenue, New York, N&amp; 10016|isbn=978-0-19-997209-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Adams explains in his critique of his work ''Narrating the Closet''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adams|first1=Tony E.|title=Narrating the Closet: An Autoethnography of Same-Sex Attraction|date=2011|publisher=Left Coast Press|location=Walnut Creek, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I knew I had to contribute to knowledge about coming out by saying something new about the experience...I also needed a new angle toward coming out; my experience, alone, of coming out was not sufficient to justify a narrative.&lt;ref name="Adams2015" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With the critic's general decree of narrative as narcissism, Adams, Jones, and [[Carolyn Ellis|Ellis]] use the first goal of assessing autoethnography to explain the importance of striving to combine personal experience and existing theory while remaining mindful of the "insider insight that autoethnography offers researchers, participants, and readers/audiences".&lt;ref name="Adams2015" /&gt; [[Carolyn Ellis|Ellis]]' ''Maternal Connections'' can be considered a successful incorporation of the first goal in that she "questions the idea of care-giving as a burden, instead of portraying caregiving as a loving and meaning-making relationship".&lt;ref name="Adams2015" /&gt;

==== Value the personal and experiential ====

Adams, Jones, and [[Carolyn Ellis|Ellis]] define the second goal for assessing autoethnography with four elements which include "featuring the perspective of the self in context and culture, exploring experience as a means of insight about social life, embracing the risks of presenting vulnerable selves in research, and using emotions and bodily experience as means and modes of understanding".&lt;ref name="Adams2015" /&gt; This goal fully recognizes and commends the "I" in academic writing and calls for analysis of the subjective experience. In Jones' ''Lost and Found'' essay she writes, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I convey the sadness and the joy I feel about my relationships with my adopted child, the child I chose not to adopt, and my grandmother. I focus on the emotions and bodily experiences of both losing and memorializing my grandmother'
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The careful and deliberate incorporation of ''auto'' (the "I", the self) into research is considered one of the most crucial aspects of the autoethnography process. The exploration of the ethics and care of presenting vulnerable selves is addressed at length by Adams in ''A Review of Narrative Ethics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adams|first1=Tony E.|title=A Review of Narrative Ethics|journal=Qualitative Inquiry|date=208|volume=14|issue=175|pages=175–191|doi=10.1177/1077800407304417|url=http://qix.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/14/2/175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Stories and storytelling ====

Autoethnography showcases stories as the means in which [[sensemaking]] and researcher [[Reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]] create descriptions and critiques of culture. Adams, Jones, and [[Carolyn Ellis|Ellis]] write: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Reflexivity includes both acknowledging and critiquing our place and privilege in society and using the stories we tell to ''break long-held silences'' on power, relationships, cultural taboos, and forgotten and/or suppressed experiences.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A focus is placed a writer's ability to develop writing and representation skills alongside other analytic abilities. Adams switches between [[First-person narrative|first-person]] and [[Second-person narrative|second-person narration]]in ''Living (In) the Closet: The Time of Being Closeted'' as a way to "bring readers into my story, inviting them to live my experiences alongside me, feeling how I felt and suggesting how they might, under similar circumstances, act as I did".&lt;ref name="Adams2015" /&gt; Similarly, [[Carolyn Ellis|Ellis]] in ''Maternal Connections'' chose to steer away from the inclusion of references to the research literature or theory instead opting to "call on sensory details, movements, emotions, dialogue, and scene setting to convey an experience of taking care of a parent".&lt;ref name="Adams2015" /&gt;
The examples included above are incomplete. Autoethnographers exploring different narrative structures can be seen in Andrew Herrmann's use of [[layered account]]s, [[Carolyn Ellis|Ellis']] use of [[haibun]], and the use of autoethnographic film by Rebecca Long and Anne Harris.

==== Relationally responsible approach  ====

Among the concepts in qualitative research is "relational responsibility". Researchers should work to make research relationships as collaborative, committed, and reciprocal as possible while taking care to safeguard identities and privacy of participants. Included under this concept is the accessibility of the work to a variety of readers which allows for the "opportunity to engage and improve the lives of our selves, participants, and readers/audiences".&lt;ref name="Adams2015" /&gt;
Autoethnographers struggle with relational responsibility as in Adams' critique of his work on coming out and recognizing:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...how others can perceive my ideas as ''relationally irresponsible'' concessions to homophobic others and to insidious heteronormative cultural structures; by ''not'' being aggressively critical, my work does not do enough to ''engage'' and ''improve'' the lives of others &lt;ref name="Adams2015" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the critique he also questions how relationally irresponsible he was by including several brief conversations in his work without consent and exploited other's experiences for his own benefit. Similar sentiments are echoed throughout Adams, Jones, and Ellis critiques of their own writing.

====From "validity" to "truth"====
As an idea that emerged from the tradition of [[social constructionism]] and interpretive paradigm, autoethnography challenges the traditional social scientific methodology that emphasizes the criteria for quality in social research developed in terms of validity. [[Carolyn Ellis]] writes, "In autoethnographic work, I look at validity in terms of what happens to readers as well as to research participants and researchers. To me, validity means that our work seeks verisimilitude; it evokes in readers a feeling that the experience described is lifelike, believable, and possible. You also can judge validity by whether it helps readers communicate with others different from themselves or offers a way to improve the lives of participants and readers- or even your own." (Ellis, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;124). In this sense, [[Carolyn Ellis|Ellis]] (2004) emphasizes the "narrative truth" for autoethnographic writings.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I believe you should try to construct the story as close to the experience as you can remember it, especially in the initial version. If you do, it will help you work through the meaning and purpose of the story. But it's not so important that narratives represent lives accurately – only, as Art([[Art Bochner|Arthur Bochner]]) argues, "that narrators believe they are doing so" (Bochner, 2002, p. 86). Art believes that we can judge one narrative interpretation of events against another, but we cannot measure a narrative against the events themselves because the meaning of the events comes clear only in their narrative expression. (p.126)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Instead, [[Carolyn Ellis|Ellis]] suggests to judge (autoethnographic writings) on the usefulness of the story, ([[Art Bochner|Bochner]], 2001) rather than only on accuracy. (Ellis, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;126) Art argues that the real questions is what narratives do, what consequences they have, to what uses they can be put. Narrative is the way we remember the past, turn life into language, and disclose to ourselves and others the truth of our experiences ([[Art Bochner|Bochner]], 2001). In moving from concern with the inner veridicality to outer pragmatics of evaluating stories, Plummer also looks at uses, functions, and roles of stories, and adds that they "need to have rhetorical power enhanced by aesthetic delight" (Plummer, 2001, p. 401).

Similarly, Laurel Richardson uses the metaphor of a crystal to deconstruct traditional validity (Richardson, 1997, p. 92). A crystal has an infinite number of shapes, dimensions and angles. It acts as a prism and changes shape, but still has structure. Another writer, Patti Lather, proposes counter-practices of authority that rupture validity as a "regime of truth" (Lather, 1993, p .674) and lead to a critical political agenda (Olesen, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;231). She mentions the four subtypes: "ironic validity, concerning the problems of representation; paralogical validity, which honors differences and uncertainties; rhizomatic validity, which seeks out multiplicity; and voluptuous validity, which seeks out ethics through practices of engagement and self-reflexivity (Lather, 1993, pp. 685~686)" (Ellis, 2004, pp.&amp;nbsp;124~125).

====From "generalizability" to "resonance"====

With regard to the term of "generalizability", [[Carolyn Ellis|Ellis]] (2004) points out that autoethnographic research seeks generalizability not just from the respondents but also from the readers. Ellis says, "I would argue that a story's generalizability is always being tested – not in the traditional way through random samples of respondents, but by readers as they determine if a story speaks to them about their experience or about the lives of others they know. Readers provide theoretical validation by comparing their lives to ours, by thinking about how our lives are similar and different and the reasons why. Some stories inform readers about unfamiliar people or lives. We can ask, after Stake, "does the story have 'naturalistic generalization'?" meaning that it brings "felt" news from one world to another and provides opportunities for the reader to have vicarious experience of the things told (Stake, 1994). The focus of generalizability moves from respondents to readers (p.195). This generalizability through the resonance of readers' lives and "lived experience" (Richardson, 1997) in autoethnographic work, intends to open up rather than close down conversation (Ellis, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;22).

===Benefits and concerns===

Denzin's criterion is whether the work has the possibility to change the world and make it a better place (Denzin, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;256). This position fits with Clough, who argues that good autoethnographic writing should motivate cultural criticism. Autoethnographic writing should be closely aligned with theoretical reflection, says Clough, so that it can serve as a vehicle for thinking "new sociological subjects" and forming "new parameters of the social" (Clough, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;290). Though Richardson and Bochner are less overtly political than Denzin and Clough, they indicate that good personal narratives should contribute to positive social change and move us to action (Bochner, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;271).

In addition to helping the researcher make sense of his or her individual experience, autoethnographies are political in nature as they engage their readers in political issues and often ask us to consider things, or do things differently Chang (2008). argues that autoethnography offers a research method friendly to researchers and readers because autoethnographic texts are engaging and enable researchers to gain a cultural understanding of self in relation to others, on which cross-cultural coalition can be built between self and others.

Also, autoethnography as a genre frees us to move beyond traditional methods of writing, promoting narrative and poetic forms, displays of artifacts, photographs, drawings, and live performances (Cons, p.&amp;nbsp;449). Denzin says authoethnography must be literary, present cultural and political issues, and articulate a politics of hope. The literary criteria he mentions are covered in what Richardson advocates: aesthetic value (Richardson, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;15). [[Carolyn Ellis|Ellis]] elaborates her idea in autoethnography as good writing that through the plot, dramatic tension, coherence, and verisimilitude, the author shows rather than tells, develops characters and scenes fully, and paints vivid sensory experiences.

While advocating autoethnography for its value, some researchers argue that there are also several concerns about autoethnography. Chang (2008) warns autoethnographers of pitfalls that they should avoid in doing autoethnography: "(1) excessive focus on self in isolation from others; (2) overemphasis on narration rather than analysis and cultural interpretation; (3) exclusive reliance on personal memory and recalling as a data source; (4) negligence of ethical standards regarding others in self-narratives; and (5) inappropriate application of the label autoethnography" (p.&amp;nbsp;54).

Also some qualitative researchers have expressed their concerns about the worth and validity of autoethnography. Robert Krizek (2003) contributed a chapter titled "Ethnography as the Excavation of Personal Narrative" (pp.&amp;nbsp;141–152) to the book of ''Expressions of Ethnography'' in which he expresses concern about the possibility for autoethnography to devolve into narcissism. Krizek goes on to suggest that autoethnography, no matter how personal, should always connect to some larger element of life.

===Controversy of evaluation===

There are several critiques about evaluating autoethnographical works grounded in interpretive paradigm. First, some researchers have criticized that within qualitative research there are those that dismiss anything but positivist notions of validity and reliability. (see Doloriert and Sambrook, 2011, pp.&amp;nbsp;593–595) For example, Schwandt (1996, p.&amp;nbsp;60) argues that some social researchers have "come to equate being rational in social science with being procedural and criteriological." Building on quantitative foundations, Lincoln and Guba (1985) translate quantitative indicators into qualitative quality indicators, namely: credibility (parallels internal validity), transferability (parallels external validity), dependability (parallels reliability), and confirmability (parallels objectivity and seeks to critically examine whether the researcher has acted in good faith during the course of the research). Smith (1984) and Smith and Heshusius (1986) critique these qualitative translations and warn that the claim of compatibility (between qualitative and quantitative criteria) cannot be sustained and by making such claims researches are in effect closing down the conversation. Smith (1984, p.&amp;nbsp;390) points out that

&lt;blockquote&gt;
What is clear . . . is that the assumptions of interpretive inquiry are incompatible with the desire for foundational criteria. How we are to work out this problem, one way or another, would seem to merit serious attention.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Secondly, some other researchers questions the need for specific criteria itself. [[Art Bochner|Bochner]] (2000) and Clough (2000) both are concerned that too much emphasis on criteria will move us back to methodological policing and will takes us away from a focus on imagination, ethical issues in autographic work, and creating better ways of living. (Bochner, 2000a, p.&amp;nbsp;269) The autoethnographer internally judges its quality. Evidence is tacit, individualistic, and subjective (see Richardson, 2000; Holman Jones, 2005; Ellis &amp; Bochner, 2003). Practice-based quality is based in the lived research experience itself rather than in its formal evidencing per se. [[Art Bochner|Bochner]] (2000) says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Self-narratives . . . are not so much academic as they are existential, reflecting a desire to grasp or seize the possibilities of meaning, which is what gives life its imaginative and poetic qualities . . . a poetic social science does not beg the question of how to separate good narrativization from bad . . . [but] the good ones help the reader or listener to understand and feel the phenomena under scrutiny.  (p. 270)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Finally, in addition to this anti-criteria stance of some researchers, some scholars have suggested that the criteria used to judge autoethnography should not necessarily be the same as traditional criteria used to judge other qualitative research investigations (Garratt &amp; Hodkinson, 1999; Holt, 2003; Sparkes, 2000). They argue that autoethnography has been received with a significant degree of academic suspicion because it contravenes certain qualitative research traditions. The controversy surrounding autoethnography is in part related to the problematic exclusive use of the self to produce research (Denzin &amp; Lincoln, 1994). This use of self as the only data source in autoethnography has been questioned (see, for example, Denzin &amp; Lincoln, 1994; Sparkes, 2000). Accordingly, autoethnographies have been criticized for being too self-indulgent and narcissistic (Coffey, 1999). Sparkes (2000) suggested that autoethnography is at the boundaries of academic research because such accounts do not sit comfortably with traditional criteria used to judge qualitative inquiries(Holt, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;19).

Holt (2003) associates this problem with this problem as two crucial issues in "the fourth moment of qualitative research" Denzin &amp; Lincoln (2000) presented; the dual crises of representation and legitimation. The crisis of representation refers to the writing practices (i.e., how researchers write and represent the social world). Additionally, verification issues relating to methods and representation are (re)considered as problematic (Marcus &amp; Fischer, 1986). The crisis of legitimation questions traditional criteria used for evaluating and interpreting qualitative research, involving a rethinking of terms such as validity, reliability, and objectivity (Holt, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;19). Holt (2003) says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Much like the autoethnographic texts themselves, the boundaries of research and their maintenance are socially constructed (Sparkes, 2000). In justifying autoethnography as proper research, it should be noted that ethnographers have acted autobiographically before, but in the past they may not have been aware of doing so, and taken their genre for granted (Coffey, 1999). Autoethnographies may leave reviewers in a perilous position. [...] the reviewers were not sure if the account was proper research (because of the style of representation), and the verification criteria they wished to judge this research by appeared to be inappropriate. Whereas the use of autoethnographic methods may be increasing, knowledge of how to evaluate and provide feedback to improve such accounts appears to be lagging. As reviewers begin to develop ways in which to judge autoethnography, they must resist the temptation to "seek universal foundational criteria lest one form of dogma simply replaces another" (Sparkes, 2002b, p. 223). However, criteria for evaluating personal writing have barely begun to develop (DeVault, 1997). (p. 26)

In discussion of [[science fiction]], a '''Big Dumb Object''' ('''BDO''') is any mysterious object (usually of [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] or unknown origin and immense power) in a story which generates an intense [[sense of wonder]] by its mere existence; to a certain extent, the term deliberately deflates this.

The term was not in general use until [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Peter Nicholls]] included it in ''[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]'' as a joke in 1993,&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls, Peter, 2000, ''Big Dumb Objects and Cosmic Enigmas: The Love Affair between Space Fiction and the Transcendental'', in Westfahl, Gary (ed), ''Space and Beyond: The Frontier Theme in Science Fiction'', Greenwood Press, p. 13. "... I decided to write an April Fool's entry. I would pretend that a phrase I’d always liked, originated by the critic Roz Kaveney but not in general use, was actually a known critical term. I would write an entry called 'Big Dumb Objects' in a poker-faced style, suggesting an even more absurd critical term to be used in its place, 'megalotropic sf.'"&lt;/ref&gt; while its creation has been attributed to reviewer [[Roz Kaveney]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaveney, Roz, 1981, ''[[Foundation - The International Review of Science Fiction|Foundation: The International Review of Science Fiction]]'', issue 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Big Dumb Objects often exhibit extreme or unusual properties, or a total absence of some expected properties:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Palmer|first=Christopher|date=2006|title=Big Dumb Objects in Science Fiction: Sublimity, Banality, and Modernity|url=https://online.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/abs/10.3828/extr.2006.47.1.10?journalCode=extr|journal=Extrapolation|language=en|volume=47|issue=1|pages=95–111|doi=10.3828/extr.2006.47.1.10|issn=0014-5483|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The monolith in Stanley Kubrick and [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' is an indecipherable influence on the protohumans to whom it first appears, and later in the film serves to show how little humans have evolved.  Astronaut Bowman's attempt to interact with the monolith only makes him a part of its mystery.
*The object discovered in ''[[Quatermass and the Pit]]'' was made of a material of extreme hardness, such that [[diamond]]-tipped drills and [[acetylene]] torches would not damage it. At the same time nothing would adhere to it.
*In [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s novel ''[[Rendezvous With Rama]]'', a 50km-long cylinder is detected entering the solar system.
*[[Charles Sheffield]]'s [[Heritage Universe]] setting features many immense alien artifacts, some of which are more inscrutable than others. 
*In the [[Sphere (1998 film)|movie]] based on [[Michael Crichton]]'s novel ''[[Sphere (novel)|Sphere]]'', the eponymous object would reflect everything in its presence except people. If it did reflect someone, she or he was alone, and the individual was accepted as worthy to harness the device's power.
*In [[Iain Banks]]' novel ''[[Against a Dark Background]]'', the Lazy Guns have a lot of mass and yet little weight, and weigh three times as much upside-down as upright.
*The dome from the [[Stephen King]] [[Under the Dome (novel)|novel]] and [[Under the Dome (TV series)|television show]] ''Under the Dome''. The dome is large and transparent unless touched by a person; it gives a slight electric shock when touched for the first time by someone, but not afterwards. It cannot be penetrated, even by a [[MOAB]], and is seemingly causing many mysterious events in Chester's Mill, the town that the dome is enclosing, including causing all electronic devices near it to explode, visions, and, in one character, premature birth. 

Such unexpected properties are usually used to rule out conventional origins for the BDO and increase the sense of mystery, and even fear, for the characters interacting with it.

'''Cuman''' ('''Kuman''') was a [[Kipchak people|Kipchak]] [[Turkic language]] spoken by the [[Cumans]] (Polovtsy, Folban, Vallany, Kun) and [[Kipchaks]]; the language was similar to today's various languages of the [[Kipchak languages|Kipchak]]-Cuman branch. Cuman is documented in medieval works, including the [[Codex Cumanicus]], and it was a literary language in the Central and Eastern Europe that left a rich literary inheritance. The language became the main language ([[lingua franca]]) of the [[Golden Horde]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.kz/qypchaq/Memorials-En.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[image:Codex Cumanicus 001.jpg|thumb|Codex Cumanicus]]

The Cumans were nomadic people who lived in the steppes of [[Eastern Europe]], north of the [[Black Sea]] before the [[Golden Horde]]. Many Turkic peoples including the [[Crimean Tatars]], [[Karachay people|Karachays]], [[Kumyk people|Kumyks]], and [[Balkar people|Balkars]] are descended from the Cumans. Today, the speakers of these various languages belonging to the [[Kipchak languages|Kipchak]]-Cuman branch speak variations closely related to the Cuman language.

The Cuman language became extinct in the early 17th century in the region of [[Kunság|Cumania]] in [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], which was its last stronghold. Tradition holds that the last speaker of the Cuman language there was a person named István Varró, a resident of Karcag ([[Hungary]]) who died in 1770.

The Cuman-Kipchaks had an important role in the history of Hungary, [[Romania]] (see, for example, the [[House of Basarab|Besarab dynasty]]), [[Moldavia]], [[Bessarabia]] and [[Bulgaria]]

==Sample==
From the book known as the [[Codex Cumanicus]], a Cuman Kipchak Turkic [[Pater Noster]]:

{{quote|{{lang|qwm|Atamız kim köktesiñ. Alğışlı bolsun seniñ atıñ, kelsin seniñ xanlığıñ, bolsun seniñ tilemekiñ – neçik kim kökte, alay [da] yerde. Kündeki ötmegimizni bizge bugün bergil. Dağı yazuqlarımıznı bizge boşatqıl – neçik biz boşatırbız bizge yaman etkenlerge. Dağı yekniñ sınamaqına bizni quurmağıl. Basa barça yamandan bizni qutxarğıl. Amen!}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/codexcumanicusbi00kuunuoft] Kuun, Géza et al.: Codex cumanicus, Bibliothecae ad templum divi Marci Venetiarum primum ex integro editit prolegomenis notis et compluribus glossariis instruxit comes Géza Kuun, Budapest 1880, XLIX – accessed 2016-08-11&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz]], or Western, [[Turkish language|Turkish]], the same text is:

{{quote|{{lang|tr|Atamız ki göktesin. Alkışlı olsun senin adın, gelsin senin hanlığın, olsun senin dilemeğin – nice ki gökte, öyle (de) yerde. Gündelik ekmeğimizi bize bugün ver.

[[File:Morocco, djellaba, end of 20th century - Bunka Gakuen Costume Museum - DSC05317.JPG|thumb|Djellaba]]

The '''djellaba''' ({{IPAc-en|dʒ|ɪ|ˈ|l|ɑː|b|ə}}; [[Moroccan Arabic]]: جلابة; [[Berber language|Berber]]: ''Aselham'') is a long, loose-fitting [[unisex]] outer [[robe]] with full sleeves that is worn in the [[Maghreb]] region of [[North Africa]]; its origin is [[Morocco]]. The word literally means ''attractive'', from ''jalaba'', ''to bring'', ''fetch''; its Semitic root is ''glb''.

==Overview==
Traditionally, djellabas are made of wool in different shapes and colours, but lightweight cotton djellabas have now become popular. Among the Berbers, or Imazighen, such as the [[Imilchil]] in the [[Atlas Mountains]], the colour of a djellaba traditionally indicates the marital status (single or married) of the bearer: a dark brown djellaba indicating bachelorhood.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Traditionally, djellabas reached down to the ground but lightweight djellabas are somewhat slimmer and shorter. Men often wear a light-coloured djellaba sometimes along with a traditional Arab red [[fez hat]] and soft yellow babouche slippers (''[[balgha]]'' in Arabic) for religious celebrations and weddings.

Almost all djellabas of both styles (male or female) include a baggy hood called a ''qob'' (Arabic: قب) that comes to a point at the back. The hood is important for both sexes, as it protects the wearer from the sun, and in earlier times, it was used as a defence against sand being blown into the wearer's face by strong desert winds. In colder climes, as in the mountains of Morocco and Algeria, it also serves the same function as a winter hat, preventing heat loss through the head and protecting the face from [[snow]] and [[rain]]. It is common for the roomy hood to be used as a pocket during times of warm weather; it can fit loaves of bread or bags of groceries.

Traditional djellabas are generally made of two types of material, cotton for summer wear and coarse wool for the winter. The wool is typically obtained from sheep in the surrounding mountains.

[[File:Efectos visuales Interference en la Medina de Túnez, Túnez, 2016-09-04, DD 85.jpg|thumb|Multiple Droste effects in a mirror shop in the [[Medina of Tunis|Tunis Medina]]]]

The '''Droste effect''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈdrɔstə}}), known in [[art]] as ''[[mise en abyme]]'', is the effect of a picture [[recursion|recursively]] appearing within itself, in a place where a similar picture would realistically be expected to appear.&lt;ref&gt;Nänny. Max and Fischer, Olga, ''The Motivated Sign: Iconicity in Language and Literature'' p.&amp;nbsp;37, John Benjamins Publishing Company (2001) {{ISBN|90-272-2574-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--Please do not add anything here that is not a summary of cited material in the body of the article below - it will be removed.--&gt;

The effect is named for [[Droste|a Dutch brand of]] [[cocoa solids|cocoa]], with an image designed by Jan Misset in 1904. It has since been used in the packaging of a variety of products. The effect was anticipated in medieval works of art such as [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]]'s [[Stefaneschi Triptych]] of 1320.

==Effect==
{{further|Mathematics and art}}

===Origins===
[[File:Polittico Stefaneschi, dettaglio.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Detail from the 1320 [[Stefaneschi Triptych]] showing [[Giacomo Gaetani Stefaneschi|Cardinal Stefaneschi]] holding the triptych itself]]

The effect is named after the image on the tins and boxes of [[Droste]] [[cocoa solids|cocoa]] powder, one of the main [[Netherlands|Dutch]] brands, which displayed a [[nurse]] carrying a serving tray with a cup of hot chocolate and a box with the same image, designed by Jan Misset.&lt;ref&gt;Törnqvist, Egil. ''Ibsen: A Doll's House'', pp.105, Cambridge University Press (1995) {{ISBN|0-521-47866-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This image, introduced in 1904, and maintained for decades with slight variations from 1912 by artists including [[Adolphe Mouron]], became a household notion. Reportedly, poet and columnist Nico Scheepmaker introduced wider usage of the term in the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cultuurarchief.nl/tentoonstellingen/0505droste.htm |title=Droste, altijd welkom |work=cultuurarchief.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mathematics===

The appearance is [[recursion|recursive]]: the smaller version contains an even smaller version of the picture, and so on.&lt;ref name=Merow2013/&gt; Only in theory could this go on forever, as [[fractal]]s do; practically, it continues only as long as the [[image resolution|resolution]] of the picture allows, which is relatively short, since each iteration [[geometric progression|geometrically]] reduces the picture's size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Juola |first1=Patrick |last2=Ramsay |first2=Stephen |title=Six Septembers: Mathematics for the Humanist |year=2017 |publisher=Zea Books |isbn=978-1-60962-111-7 |page=116 |quote=By putting a picture inside a picture, you get a progression of suggessively smaller, but self-similar images (the box of Droste cocoa has a picture of a woman holding a box of Droste cocoa... ). In theory, this nesting could go on forever into infinite detail, but in practical terms, the resolution of the image limits how it's actually drawn.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--It is a visual example of a [[strange loop]], a [[self reference|self-referential]] system of [[geometry instancing|instancing]] which is the cornerstone of [[fractal geometry]].--&gt;
&lt;!--USABLE IF CITED--&gt;

===In medieval art===

The Droste effect was anticipated by [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]] in 1320, in his [[Stefaneschi Triptych]]. The [[polyptych]] altarpiece portrays in its center panel [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Giacomo Gaetani Stefaneschi]] offering the triptych itself to [[St. Peter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mv.vatican.va/3_EN/pages/PIN/PIN_Sala02_03.html |title=Giotto di Bondone and assistants: Stefaneschi triptych |publisher=The Vatican}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also several examples from medieval times of books featuring images containing the book itself or window panels in churches depicting miniature copies of the window panel itself.&lt;ref&gt;See the collection of articles {{cite web |url=http://www.courtauld.ac.uk/researchforum/projects/medievalarttheory/documents/Mise-en-abyme.pdf |title=Medieval 'mise-en-abyme': the object depicted within itself |author=Whatling, Stuart |publisher=[[Courtauld Institute]] |date=16 February 2009 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102033517/http://www.courtauld.ac.uk/researchforum/projects/medievalarttheory/documents/Mise-en-abyme.pdf |archivedate=2 November 2013 }} for examples and opinions on how this effect was used symbolically.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the art of M. C. Escher===

The Dutch artist [[M. C. Escher]] made use of the Droste effect in his 1956 lithograph [[Print Gallery (M. C. Escher)|Print Gallery]], which depicts a gallery containing a print which depicts the gallery, each time both reduced and rotated, but with a void at the centre of the image. The work has attracted the attention of mathematicians including Bart de Smit and [[Hendrik Lenstra]]. They devised a method of filling in the artwork's central void in an additional application of the Droste effect by successively rotating and shrinking an image of the artwork.&lt;ref name=Merow2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Smit&gt;{{Cite journal |last=de Smit |first=B. |last2=Lenstra |first2=H. W. |title=The Mathematical Structure of Escher's Print Gallery |year=2003 |journal=[[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]] |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=446–451 |url=http://www.ams.org/notices/200304/fea-escher.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LenstraWebsite&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lenstra |first1=Hendrik |last2=De Smit |first2=Bart |title=Applying mathematics to Escher's Print Gallery |url=http://escherdroste.math.leidenuniv.nl/index.php?menu=intro |publisher=Leiden University |accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Epifany Slavinetsky''' ({{lang-ru|Епифа́ний Славине́цкий}}) (died November 19, 1675) was an [[ecclesiastical]] expert of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] who helped [[Patriarch Nikon]] to revise ancient service-books. His actions precipitated the ''[[raskol]]'', the great schism of the national church.

[[Image:Patriarch Nikon Revising Service-Books.jpg|thumb|''Epifany Slavinetsky revising the service-books.''&lt;br /&gt;Painting by [[Aleksey Kivshenko]].]]
Epifany was born in [[Moscow]]. In the 1620s, he attended the [[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy|Kiev Brotherhood School]] and furthered his education abroad. He was one of the most educated people of his period in Central and Eastern Europe {{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}. He came to master [[Latin]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. On his return to [[Kiev]], he took monastic vows in the [[Kiev Pechersk Lavra]]. In the late 1630s, he compiled the first [[Latin]]-[[Church Slavonic]] lexicon, which he would revise on several occasions{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

Upon hearing about Epifany's scholarly expertise, the Imperial Russian [[Tsar Alexis]] invited him to correct the ecclesiastical books of [[Muscovy]]. Epifany arrived in [[Moscow]] in 1649 and visited the [[Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra|Trinity-Sergius monastery]] the same year. He quickly managed to secure the patronage of the Boyar [[Boris Morozov]] and [[Patriarch Nikon|Metropolitan Nikon]] of [[Novgorod]], who was elected [[Patriarch]] a short time later.

Epifany joined the [[Chudov Monastery]] in the [[Moscow Kremlin]] where he was appointed head of the Patriarchal school and charged with administrating the Printery. He revived the mediaeval tradition of delivering [[sermon]]s in Russian churches. In the 1650s and early 1660s, he revised the Muscovite service-books and translating [[Erasmus]] and [[Copernicus]] from [[Latin]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

When Nikon fell into disgrace, he gained the support of the scholar, who proved that his deposition was contrary to the laws of the church{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}. He spent his last years translating the [[Septuagint]] and the [[New Testament]] as commissioned by his patron [[Fyodor Rtishchev]]. Epifany died in Moscow in 1675.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The '''Feminist Library''' was founded as the Women’s Research and Resources Centre in 1975 by a group of women concerned about the future of the [[Women's Library|Fawcett Library]] to ensure that the history of the [[women's liberation movement]] survived. The founders included feminist academics like [[Diana Leonard]] and [[Leonore Davidoff]].&lt;ref name="Diana Leonard obituary"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/dec/09/diana-leonard-obituary | title=Diana Leonard obituary | publisher=The Guardian www.theguardian.com | date=9 December 2010 | accessdate=22 November 2014 | author=David, Miriam}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leonore Davidoff obituary"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/nov/06/leonore-davidoff | title=Leonore Davidoff obituary | publisher=The Guardian www.theguardian.com | date=6 November 2014 | accessdate=22 November 2014 | author=John, Angela V.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
The library started out as a small collection of contemporary material, but is now considered to be the most significant library of feminist material in England, containing some 7500 books, of which around 5000 are non-fiction, 500 poetry publications, and 1500 periodical titles, many self-published, spanning over about 85 metres of shelving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://feministlibrary.co.uk/about-the-library/ |title=About the library |publisher=The Feminist Library |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729083116/http://feministlibrary.co.uk/about-the-library/ |archivedate=2010-07-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a large number of pamphlets, currently held at the [[Bishopsgate Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bishopsgate.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=1474 |title=Feminist Library Pamphlet Collection |publisher=Bishopsgate Institute |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716154253/http://www.bishopsgate.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=1474 |archivedate=2011-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2003 crisis===
The library faced a financial crisis in 2003 when Lambeth Council dramatically increased the rent on the building housing the collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://londonist.com/2007/02/your_feminist_l.php |title=Your Feminist Library Needs You! |publisher=Londonist |date=2007-02-26 |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four years later, in 2007, the management committee called an emergency meeting as a final attempt to gather support. Fortunately, the meeting was well attended and the library was saved, although it still struggles today, depending on grants to survive. 

===Librarians for Tomorrow===
In January 2010, the library announced that it had received a grant from Awards for All,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.womeninlondon.org.uk/2010/01/training-feminist-library/ |title=Radical Librarianship Training |publisher=Womeninlondon.org.uk |date=2010-01-27 |accessdate=2010-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203104423/http://www.womeninlondon.org.uk/2010/01/training-feminist-library/ |archivedate=2010-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which it intended to use to train volunteers in radical librarianship, using the library itself as a resource. In March 2010, fifteen volunteers were chosen from many applicants and they began working at the library in April 2010. One of the trainees began writing an anonymous blog about her experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radicalfeministlibrarian.wordpress.com/ |title=Adventures of a Radical Feminist Librarian |publisher=Radicalfeministlibrarian.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718104301/http://radicalfeministlibrarian.wordpress.com/ |archivedate=2011-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further updates===
Opening hours had increased in 2013 - 2014 but remained dependent on the availability of volunteers. In 2015 the Library celebrated its 40th anniversary, while by 2018 it was open afternoons or evenings from Tuesday to Saturday.&lt;ref&gt;[http://feministlibrary.co.uk/  The Feminist Library: Archiving our herstories since 1975] ''feministlibrary.co.uk'', accessed 31 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==High ratio of fiction to non-fiction==
The amount of poetry and fiction in the library is unusual for a special collection focused on a political movement. The reason for this is that the library wanted to ensure individual women were represented as part of their liberation, as explained by Gail Chester, a member of the library's management committee, in an interview with Anne Welsh in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Added by My Heroines on November 8, 2008 at 11:26pm |url=http://www.hagsharlotsheroines.com/xn/detail/2391451:Note:732 |title=From Herstory to Ourstory: the Feminist Library |publisher=Hagsharlotsheroines.com |date=2008-11-08 |first2=Anne |last2=Welsh |accessdate=2010-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307180051/http://www.hagsharlotsheroines.com/xn/detail/2391451%3ANote%3A732 |archivedate=2012-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Williams''', better known by his [[bardic name]] '''Iolo Morganwg''' ({{IPA-cy|ˈjɔlɔ mɔrˈɡanʊɡ|}}; 10 March 1747 – 18 December 1826), was an influential [[Welsh people|Welsh]] [[antiquarian]], poet, collector, and [[Literary forgery|literary forger]].&lt;ref name="Welsh Biography Online"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-WILL-EDW-1747.html|title=The National Library of Wales :: Dictionary of Welsh Biography|website=yba.llgc.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jonesiolo"&gt;Jones, Mary (2004). [http://www.maryjones.us/jce/iolo.html "Edward Williams/Iolo Morganwg/Iolo Morgannwg"]. From ''Jones' Celtic Encyclopedia''. Retrieved 11 June 2009 (only USA, see: [https://web.archive.org/web/20160521191155/http://www.maryjones.us/jce/iolo.html WayBackMachine]).&lt;/ref&gt; In his day he was widely considered a leading collector and expert on [[Medieval Welsh literature]], but after his death it was revealed that he had forged a number of his manuscripts, especially parts of the Third Series of [[Welsh Triads#Later collections|Welsh Triads]].&lt;ref name="Archaiology"&gt;Jones, Mary (2003). [http://www.maryjones.us/jce/myvyrian.html "Y Myvyrian Archaiology"]. From ''Jones' Celtic Encyclopedia''. Retrieved 11 June 2009 (only USA, see: [https://web.archive.org/web/20160415182437/http://www.maryjones.us/jce/myvyrian.html WayBackMachine]).&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, he had a lasting impact on Welsh culture, seen most notably in his foundation of the [[Gorsedd]], and the philosophy he developed in his forgeries had a huge impact on the early [[neo-druidism|neo-druid]] movement. His bardic name is Welsh for "Iolo of [[Glamorgan]]" (the county's name is spelt "Morgannwg" in modern Welsh). ''Iolo'' is the diminutive of "[[Iorwerth]]", a Welsh name often seen as equivalent to "[[Edward]]",&lt;ref name="Jonesiolo"/&gt; although neither name is a translation of the other.

==Early life==
Edward Williams was born at [[:cy:Pennon|Pennon]], near [[Llancarfan]] in [[Glamorgan]], [[Wales]], and was raised in the village of [[Flemingston]] (or Flimston; ''Trefflemin'' in Welsh). He followed his father into a career as a [[stonemason]]. In Glamorgan he took an interest in manuscript collection, and learned to compose Welsh poetry from poets such as [[Lewis Hopkin]], Rhys Morgan, and especially [[Siôn Bradford]].&lt;ref name="Jonesiolo"/&gt; In 1773 he moved to [[London]] where the antiquary [[Owen Jones (antiquary)|Owen Jones]] introduced him to the city's Welsh literary community, and where he became a member of the [[Gwyneddigion Society]]: he would later also be active in the [[Cymreigyddion Society]]. In 1777 he returned to Wales, where he married and tried his hand at farming, but evidently met with no success. It was during this time that he produced his first forgeries.

Williams's son, Taliesin (bardic name, [[Taliesin ab Iolo]]), whom he had named after the early medieval bard [[Taliesin]], later went on to collect his manuscripts in twenty-six volumes,&lt;ref name="Waring1850"&gt;{{cite book|author=Elijah Waring|title=Recollections and anecdotes of Edward Williams the bard of Glamorgan; or, Iolo Morganwg|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0OIIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA4|accessdate=15 October 2012|year=1850|publisher=Charles Gilpin|pages=4–}}&lt;/ref&gt; a selection was published under the title of the [[Iolo Manuscripts]] by the [[Welsh Manuscripts Society]] in 1848.&lt;ref name="MorganwgJones1848"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Iolo Morganwg|author2=Owen Jones|author3=Society for the Publication of Ancient Welsh Manuscripts, Abergavenny|title=Iolo manuscripts: A selection of ancient Welsh manuscripts, in prose and verse, from the collection made by the late Edward Williams, Iolo Morganwg, for the purpose of forming a continuation of the Myfyrian archaeology; and subsequently proposed as materials for a new history of Wales|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6jREAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP1|accessdate=15 October 2012|year=1848|publisher=W. Rees; sold by Longman and co., London|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary career==
From an early date Williams was concerned with preserving and maintaining the literary and cultural traditions of Wales. To this end he produced a large number of manuscripts as evidence for his claims that ancient [[druid]]ic tradition had survived the [[Roman conquest of Britain|Roman conquest]], the conversion of the populace to [[Christianity]], the persecution of the bards under King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], and other adversities. His forgeries develop an elaborate mystical philosophy, which he claimed represented a direct continuation of ancient druidic practice. Williams's reported heavy use of [[laudanum]] may have been a contributing factor.&lt;ref name="Jonesiolo"/&gt;

Williams first came to public notice in 1789 when he produced ''Barddoniaeth Dafydd ab Gwilym'', a collection of the poetry of the 14th-century [[Dafydd ap Gwilym]]. Included in this edition was a large number of previously unknown poems by Dafydd that he claimed to have discovered; these poems are regarded as Williams's first forgeries.&lt;ref name="Jonesiolo"/&gt; His success led him to return to [[London]] in 1791. There he founded the [[Gorsedd]], a community of Welsh [[bard]]s, at a ceremony on 21 June 1792 at [[Primrose Hill]]. He organised the proceedings, which he claimed were based on ancient druidic rites. In 1794 he published some of his own poetry, which was later collected in the two-volume ''Poems, Lyric and Pastoral''. Essentially his only genuine work, it proved quite popular.&lt;ref name="Jonesiolo"/&gt;

Williams worked with [[Owen Jones (antiquary)|Owen Jones]] and [[William Owen Pughe]] on ''[[The Myvyrian Archaiology of Wales]]'', a three-volume collection of medieval Welsh literature published between 1801 and 1807.&lt;ref name="Archaiology"/&gt; The ''Myvyrian Archaiology '' relied partially on manuscripts in Williams's collection, some of which included his forgeries. Forged material included a false ''[[Brut y Brenhinedd|Brut]]'' chronicle and a book attributed to Saint [[Cadoc]]. The second volume, which collected the [[Welsh Triads]], contained an additional "third series" of forged triads, as well as Williams's alterations to the authentic ones.&lt;ref name="Jonesiolo"/&gt;
[[File:Portrait of Edward Williams, bardd braint a defod (4672175).jpg|left|thumb|333x333px]]

After Williams's death some of his collection was compiled into ''The Iolo Manuscripts'' by his son, Taliesin Williams.&lt;ref name="Jonesiolo"/&gt; His papers were used by many later scholars and translators, and were used for reference by [[Lady Charlotte Guest]] as she was translating the prose collection ''[[Mabinogion]]''. Guest did not, however, rely on William's editions of the tales themselves except for ''Hanes Taliesin''.&lt;ref name="Jonesiolo"/&gt; Later still, more of Williams's forgeries were published in the text known as ''[[Barddas]]''.&lt;ref name="Barddas"&gt;Jones, Mary (2004). [http://www.maryjones.us/jce/barddas.html "Barddas"]. From ''Jones' Celtic Encyclopedia''. Retrieved 11 June 2009 (only USA, see [https://web.archive.org/web/20160303204250/http://www.maryjones.us/jce/barddas.html WayBackMachine]).&lt;/ref&gt; This work, published in two volumes in 1862 and 1874, was claimed to have been a translation of works by [[Llywelyn Siôn]] detailing the history of the Welsh bardic system from its ancient origins to the present day. Though it contains nothing of authentic druidic lore, it is the fullest account of the mystical cosmology Williams developed.&lt;ref name="Barddas"/&gt; Other works by Williams include the "[[Druid's Prayer]]", still used by the Gorsedd and by neo-druid groups; a treatise on Welsh [[Meter (poetry)|metrics]] called ''Cyfrinach Beirdd Ynys Prydain'' ("The Mystery of the Bards of the Isle of Britain"), published posthumously in 1828; and a series of [[hymn]]s published as ''Salmau yr Eglwys yn yr Anialwch'' ("Psalms of the church in the wilderness") in 1812.

==Philosophy==
Iolo's philosophy represented a fusion of [[Christian]] and [[Arthurian legend|Arthurian]] influences, a romanticism comparable to that of [[William Blake]] and the Scottish poet and forger [[James Macpherson|James MacPherson]], the revived [[antiquarian]] enthusiasm for all things "[[Modern Celts|Celtic]]", and such elements of bardic heritage as had genuinely survived among Welsh-language poets. Part of his aim was to assert the Welshness of [[South Wales]], particularly his home region of Glamorgan, against the prevalent idea that [[North Wales]] represented the purest survival of Welsh traditions. The [[metaphysics]] elucidated in his forgeries and other works proposed a theory of concentric "rings of existence", proceeding outward from [[Annwn]] (the [[Otherworld]]) through [[Abred]] and [[Ceugant]] to [[Gwynfyd]] (purity or [[Heaven]]).

Outside his shop in [[Cowbridge]] was a sign explaining that the sugar he sold was from plantations which did not employ [[Atlantic slave trade|slaves]]. He also refused inheritance from his brothers, who owned [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|plantations in Jamaica]] which used slave labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Support for bardic founder plaque|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/7934718.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1799 he had become a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] and he was the leading spirit when a Unitarian Association was formed in South Wales in 1802; it was he who drew up the ''Rheolau a Threfniadau'' (Rules and Procedures) of that body published in 1803.&lt;ref name="Welsh Biography Online"/&gt;

==Bardic alphabet==
[[File:Peithynen - displaying Bardic Alphabet (coelbren y beirdd).jpg|thumb|right|Bardic Alphabet]]
{{main article|Coelbren y Beirdd}}
Iolo Morganwg developed his own runic system, in Welsh [[Coelbren y Beirdd]] ("the Bardic Alphabet"). It was said to be the alphabetic system of the ancient druids. It consisted of 20 main letters, and 20 others "to represent elongated vowels and mutations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/888/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101117215438/http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/888/ |archivedate=17 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt; These symbols were to be represented in a wooden frame, known as ''peithynen''.

==Legacy==
Such was the extent of his forgery that, even into the 21st century, some of his tampered versions of medieval Welsh texts are better known than the original versions.&lt;ref&gt;Bromwich, Rachel. ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein''. University of Wales Press, 2006. Pg. 213&lt;/ref&gt;

A Welsh-language school in [[Cowbridge]], [[Ysgol Iolo Morganwg]], is named after him, and [[Super Furry Animals]] vocalist [[Gruff Rhys]] dedicated a song to him on his 2014 album, ''[[American Interior]]''.

==Reception==
Scott Green, writing for [[Ain't It Cool News]], summed up the series as being enjoyable, but underachieving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/49115|title=AICN Anime - Three Manga for the AICN Readers Who Don't Read Manga - and Alien vs Ninja|publisher=Ain't It Cool News|accessdate=2012-04-15|date=2011-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew Warner feels that the story in the fourth volume is more focused on the business of trading weapons, describing it as a nice change of pace for the story, but Warner was disappointed that the violence and "dark, twisted plot points" of earlier volumes in the series were not present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/jormungand-vol-04_article_124489.html|title=Jormungand Vol. #04|author=Matthew Warner|date=2010-08-10|publisher=Mania.com|accessdate=2012-04-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Crk51JzH?url=http://www.mania.com/jormungand-vol-04_article_124489.html|archivedate=2012-12-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erica Friedman, organiser of [[Yuricon]], noted the [[yuri (genre)|yuri]] potential of Valmet, but declared the manga to be "just a dumb manga that I really like".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://okazu.yuricon.com/2010/12/02/jormungand-manga-volume-5-english/ |date=2010-12-02 | first=Erica |last=Friedman|title=Jormungand Manga, Volume 5 (English) | work=Okazu | publisher=[[Yuricon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- old-url=http://okazu.blogspot.com/2010/12/jormungand-manga-volume-5-english.html --&gt; Karen Maeda enjoyed the action shown in the sixth volume, regarding the panels as being easy to follow, and hoped that ''Jormungand'' would be produced as an anime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sequentialtart.com/reports.php?ID=7637&amp;issue=2011-03-21|title=Jormungand Vol. 6|author=Karen Maeda|accessdate=2012-04-15|publisher=Sequential Tart}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anime News Network's review of ''Jormungand'' points out the "challenging ideas about war, peace, and world affairs—and throws in some whiz-bang military action for good measure."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/jormungand/gn-11|title=Jormungand GN 11|accessdate=2013-06-11|date=2013-06-09|publisher=Anime News Network|author=Santos, Carlo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, the manga's 9th Volume sold 41,712 copies in a week for a total of 42,337 in the 27th place out of 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-03-14/japanese-comic-ranking-february-28-march-6|title=Japanese Comic Ranking, February 28-March 6|accessdate=2012-06-27|date=2011-03-14|publisher=Anime News Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jormungand's 11th Volume was in 10th place and had sold 70,593 copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-05-15/japanese-comic-ranking-april-16-22|title=Japanese Comic Ranking, April 16–22|date=2012-05-15|accessdate=2012-06-27|publisher=Anime News Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; It later placed itself in the 20th place out of 30, selling 34,697 copies weekly for a total of 105,290.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-05-16/japanese-comic-ranking-april-23-29|title=Japanese Comic Ranking, April 23–29|accessdate=2012-06-27|date=2012-05-16|publisher=Anime News Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Angola]]n mythology, '''Kianda''' is a [[goddess]] of the [[sea]], deity of the waters, protector of the fishermen. She was traditionally worshipped by throwing offerings such as food and clothing into the sea. 
Equivalent to Iemanja, Brazilian water goddess of African origin Yoruba. Her English translation would be Mermaid.
Every year there are held festivities Kianda Festivity to worship this deity in Luanda, Angola, a week before the festival of the patron saint of the Ilha and Ibendoa (Bengo province) in July.
The name kianda is also the specific epithet for mosasaur Prognathodon kianda&lt;ref&gt;Schulp, A. S., Polcyn, M. J., Mateus, O., Jacobs, L. L., &amp; Morais, M. L. (2008). A new species of Prognathodon (Squamata, Mosasauridae) from the Maastrichtian of Angola, and the affinities of the mosasaur genus Liodon. In Proceedings of the Second Mosasaur Meeting, Fort Hays Studies Special Issue (Vol. 3, pp. 1-12).&lt;/ref&gt; from Angola.

'''Legal history''' or the '''history of law''' is the study of how [[law]] has evolved and why it changed. Legal history is closely connected to the development of [[civilisations]] and is set in the wider context of [[social history]]. Among certain jurists and historians of legal process, it has been seen as the recording of the evolution of laws and the technical explanation of how these laws have evolved with the view of better understanding the origins of various legal concepts; some consider it a branch of [[intellectual history]]. Twentieth century [[historian]]s have viewed legal history in a more contextualised manner more in line with the thinking of [[Social history|social historians]]. They have looked at legal institutions as complex systems of rules, players and symbols and have seen these elements interact with society to change, adapt, resist or promote certain aspects of [[civil society]]. Such legal historians have tended to analyse case histories from the parameters of [[social science]] inquiry, using statistical methods, analysing class distinctions among litigants, petitioners and other players in various legal processes. By analysing case outcomes, transaction costs, number of settled cases they have begun an analysis of legal institutions, practices, procedures and briefs that give us a more complex picture of law and [[society]] than the study of [[jurisprudence]], [[case law]] and [[civil code]]s can achieve.

==Ancient world==
{{Main|Ma'at|Babylonian law|Ancient Greek law|Leviticus}}
{{See also|Urukagina|Hittite laws|Ostracism}}
[[Ancient Egypt]]ian law, dating as far back as 3000 BC, had a civil code that was probably broken into twelve books. It was based on the concept of [[Ma'at]], characterised by tradition, [[rhetoric]]al speech, social equality and impartiality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Théodoridés|title = law | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt}}&lt;br/&gt;* VerSteeg, ''Law in ancient Egypt''&lt;/ref&gt; By the 22nd century BC, [[Ur-Nammu]], an ancient [[Sumer]]ian ruler, formulated the first extant [[Code of Ur-Nammu|law code]], consisting of casuistic statements ("if... then..."). Around 1760 BC, [[Hammurabi|King Hammurabi]] further developed [[Babylonian law]], by codifying and inscribing it in stone. Hammurabi placed several copies of his law code throughout the kingdom of Babylon as [[stelae]], for the entire public to see; this became known as the [[Code of Hammurabi|Codex Hammurabi]]. The most intact copy of these stelae was discovered in the 19th century by British Assyriologists, and has since been fully [[transliterated]] and translated into various languages, including English, German and French. Ancient Greek has no word for "law" as an abstract concept,&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, ''A Short History of Western Legal Theory'', 5-6&lt;/ref&gt; retaining instead the distinction between divine law (''thémis''), human decree (''nomos'') and custom (''díkē'').&lt;ref&gt;J.P. Mallory, "Law", in ''Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture'', 346&lt;/ref&gt; Yet [[Ancient Greek law]] contained major [[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|constitutional]] innovations in the development of [[democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Ober, ''The Nature of Athenian Democracy'', 121&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ancient India]] and [[Ancient China|China]] represent distinct traditions of law, and had historically independent schools of legal theory and practice. The ''[[Arthashastra]]'', dating from the 400 BC, and the ''[[Manusmriti]]'' from 100 BCE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Study reveals origin of India’s caste system|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Study-reveals-origin-of-Indias-caste-system/articleshow/21754499.cms}}&lt;/ref&gt; were influential treatises in India, texts that were considered authoritative legal guidance.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 255&lt;/ref&gt; Manu's central philosophy was tolerance and pluralism, and was cited across South East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 276&lt;/ref&gt; But this Hindu tradition, along with Islamic law, was  supplanted by the common law when India became part of the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 273&lt;/ref&gt; Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore and [[Law of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] also adopted the common law.

==Eastern Asia==
{{Main|Traditional Chinese law|Tang Code|Great Qing Legal Code}}
The eastern Asia legal tradition reflects a unique blend of secular and religious influences.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 287&lt;/ref&gt; Japan was the first country to begin modernising its legal system along western lines, by importing bits of the [[Code Civil|French]], but mostly the [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|German]] Civil Code.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 304&lt;/ref&gt; This partly reflected Germany's status as a rising power in the late nineteenth century. Similarly, [[traditional Chinese law]] gave way to westernisation towards the final years of the [[Qing Dynasty|Qing dynasty]] in the form of six private law codes based mainly on the Japanese model of German law.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 305&lt;/ref&gt; Today Taiwanese law retains the closest affinity to the codifications from that period, because of the split between [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s nationalists, who fled there, and [[Mao Zedong]]'s communists who won control of the mainland in 1949. The current legal infrastructure in the [[People's Republic of China]] was heavily influenced by soviet [[Socialist law]], which essentially inflates administrative law at the expense of private law  rights.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 307&lt;/ref&gt; Today, however, because of rapid industrialisation China has been reforming, at least in terms of economic (if not social and political) rights. A new contract code in 1999 represented a turn away from administrative domination.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 309&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, after negotiations lasting fifteen years, in 2001 China joined the [[World Trade Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;Farah, ''Five Years of China WTO Membership'', 263-304&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canon law==
{{canon law}}
{{main|Legal history of the Catholic Church}}
{{further|Canon law (Catholic Church)}}
The legal history of the [[Catholic Church]] is the history of [[canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic canon law]], the oldest continuously functioning legal system in the West.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dr. Edward N. Peters]], [http://www.canonlaw.info CanonLaw.info], accessed Jul-1-2013&lt;/ref&gt; Canon law originates much later than [[Roman law]] but predates the evolution of modern European [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] traditions. The cultural exchange between the secular (Roman/Barbarian) and ecclesiastical (canon) law produced the [[jus commune]] and greatly influenced both civil and common law.

The history of Latin [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] can be divided into four periods: the ''jus antiquum'', the ''jus novum'', the ''jus novissimum'' and the ''Code of Canon Law''.&lt;ref name=Manual13&gt;Manual of Canon Law, pg. 13, #8&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to the Code, history can be divided into the ''jus vetus'' (all law before the Code) and the ''jus novum'' (the law of the Code, or ''jus codicis'').&lt;ref name=Manual13/&gt; Eastern canon law developed separately.

In the twentieth century, canon law was comprehensively codified. On 27 May 1917, Pope Benedict XV codified the [[1917 Code of Canon Law]]. John XIII, together with his intention to call the [[Second Vatican Council]], announced his intention to reform canon law, which culminated in the [[1983 Code of Canon Law]], promulgated by [[John Paul II]] on 25 January 1983. John Paul II also brought to a close the long process of codifying the legal elements common to all 23 [[sui juris]] Eastern Catholic Churches on 18 October 1990 by promulgating the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches.

==Islamic law==
{{Main|Sharia}}
{{See also|Fiqh|Islamic ethics|Early reforms under Islam}}
One of the major legal systems developed during the Middle Ages was [[Sharia|Islamic law]] and [[Fiqh|jurisprudence]]. A number of important legal institutions were developed by [[Ulema|Islamic jurists]] during the classical period of [[Sharia|Islamic law]] and [[Fiqh|jurisprudence]]. One such institution was the ''[[Hawala]]'', an early [[informal value transfer system]], which is mentioned in texts of [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]] as early as the 8th century. ''Hawala'' itself later influenced the development of the ''Aval'' in [[French civil law]] and the ''Avallo'' in Italian law.&lt;ref name=Badr&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Islamic Law: Its Relation to Other Legal Systems|first=Gamal Moursi|last=Badr|journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law|volume=26|issue=2 [Proceedings of an International Conference on Comparative Law, Salt Lake City, Utah, February 24–25, 1977]|date=Spring 1978|pages=187–198 [196–8]|doi=10.2307/839667|publisher=American Society of Comparative Law|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|jstor=839667}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European laws==
===Roman Empire===
{{Main|Roman law|Byzantine law}}
[[Roman law]] was heavily influenced by Greek teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, ''A Short History of Western Legal Theory, 39&lt;/ref&gt; It forms the bridge to the modern legal world, over the centuries between the rise and decline of the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="BrRL"&gt;As a legal system, Roman law has affected the development of law in most of [[Western world|Western civilization]] as well as in parts of the [[Eastern world]]. It also forms the basis for the law codes of most countries of continental Europe ({{cite encyclopedia|title=Roman law|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Roman law, in the days of the [[Roman republic]] and [[Roman empire|Empire]], was heavily procedural and there was no professional legal class.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 18&lt;/ref&gt; Instead a lay person, ''iudex'', was chosen to adjudicate. Precedents were not reported, so any case law that developed was disguised and almost unrecognised.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 21&lt;/ref&gt; Each case was to be decided afresh from the laws of the state, which mirrors the (theoretical) unimportance of judges' decisions for future cases in civil law systems today. During the 6th century AD in the Eastern Roman Empire, the Emperor [[Justinian]] codified and consolidated the laws that had existed in Rome so that what remained was one twentieth of the mass of legal texts from before.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 32&lt;/ref&gt; This became known as the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]''. As one legal historian wrote, "Justinian consciously looked back to the golden age of Roman law and aimed to restore it to the peak it had reached three centuries before."&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 35&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
[[Image:Joao sem terra assina carta Magna.jpg|150px|thumb|right|King John of England signs the Magna Carta]]
{{Main|Early Germanic law|Anglo-Saxon law|Lex mercatoria|Early Irish law}}
{{See also|Germanic tribal laws|Visigothic Code|Dōm|Blutgericht|Magna Carta|Schwabenspiegel}}
During the [[Byzantine Empire]] the [[Justinian Code]] was expanded and remained in force until the Empire fell, though it was never officially introduced to the West. Instead, following the fall of the Western Empire and in former Roman countries, the ruling classes relied on the [[Theodosian Code]] to govern natives and Germanic [[custom (law)|customary]] law for the Germanic incomers - a system known as folk-right - until the two laws blended together. Since the Roman court system had broken down, legal disputes were adjudicated according to Germanic custom by assemblies of learned [[lawspeaker]]s in rigid ceremonies and in oral proceedings that relied heavily on [[testimony]].

After much of the West was consolidated under [[Charlemagne]], law became centralized so as to strengthen the royal court system, and consequently [[case law]], and abolished folk-right. However, once Charlemagne's kingdom definitively splintered, Europe became feudalistic, and law was generally not governed above the county, municipal or lordship level, thereby creating a highly decentralized legal culture that favored the development of customary law founded on localized case law. However, in the 11th century, [[crusades|crusaders]], having pillaged the Byzantine Empire, returned with Byzantine legal texts including the Justinian Code, and scholars at the [[University of Bologna]] were the first to use them to interpret their own customary laws.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 43&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval European legal scholars began researching the [[Roman law]] and using its concepts&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/Law508/histlaw.htm Roman and Secular Law in the Middle Ages] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927014718/http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/Law508/histlaw.htm |date=2011-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and prepared the way for the partial resurrection of Roman law as the modern [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] in a large part of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-Romanlaw.html Roman law]&lt;/ref&gt; There was, however, a great deal of resistance so that civil law rivaled customary law for much of the late Middle Ages.

After the [[Norman conquest of England]], which introduced [[Norman law|Norman]] legal concepts into medieval England, the English King's powerful judges developed a body of [[precedent]] that became the [[common law]].&lt;ref name=Makdisi&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Makdisi|first=John A.|title=The Islamic Origins of the Common Law|journal=[[North Carolina Law Review]]|date=June 1999|volume=77|issue=5|pages=1635–1739|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}} suggests that there may have been some importation of Islamic concepts as well, but others have shown that occasional similarities are more likely coincidence than causal.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] instituted legal reforms and developed a system of royal courts administered by a small number of judges who lived in [[Westminster]] and traveled throughout the kingdom.&lt;ref name=KlermanMahoney/&gt; Henry II also instituted the [[Assize of Clarendon]] in 1166, which allowed for jury trials and reduced the number of [[trial by combat|trials by combat]]. [[Louis IX]] of France also undertook major legal reforms and, inspired by [[ecclesiastical court]] procedure, extended Canon-law evidence and [[inquisitorial system|inquisitorial-trial]] systems to the royal courts. Also, judges no longer moved on circuits becoming fixed to their jurisdictions, and jurors were nominated by parties to the legal dispute rather than by the sheriff.&lt;ref name=KlermanMahoney&gt;{{cite journal | author = Klerman D, Mahoney PG | title = Legal Origins | url = http://lawweb.usc.edu/users/dklerman/documents/Klerman.LegalOrigin.JCompEcon.pdf | year = 2007 | journal = Journal of Comparative Economics | pages = 278–293 | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | accessdate = 2009-09-04 | doi = 10.1016/j.jce.2007.03.007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090826025347/http://lawweb.usc.edu/users/dklerman/documents/Klerman.LegalOrigin.JCompEcon.pdf | archive-date = 2009-08-26 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, by the 10th century, the [[lex mercatoria|Law Merchant]], first founded on [[medieval Scandinavian laws|Scandinavian]] trade customs, then solidified by the [[Hanseatic League]], took shape so that merchants could trade using familiar standards, rather than the many splintered types of local law. A precursor to modern commercial law, the Law Merchant emphasised the freedom of contract and alienability of property.&lt;ref&gt;Sealey-Hooley, ''Commercial Law'', 14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern European law===
{{Main|Napoleonic code|Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|English law|Francisco de Vitoria}}
The two main traditions of modern European law are the codified legal systems of most of continental Europe, and the English tradition based on case law.

As [[nationalism]] grew in the 18th and 19th centuries, ''lex mercatoria'' was incorporated into countries' local law under new civil codes. Of these, the French [[Napoleonic Code]] and the German [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch]] became the most influential. As opposed to English [[common law]], which consists of massive tomes of case law, codes in small books are easy to export and for judges to apply. However, today there are signs that civil and common law are converging. [[European Union law]] is codified in treaties, but develops through the [[precedent]] set down by the [[European Court of Justice]].

==United States==
The [[Law of the United States|United States legal system]] developed primarily out of the English common law system (with the exception of the state of [[Louisiana]], which continued to [[Louisiana law|follow the French civilian system]] after being admitted to statehood).  Some concepts from [[Law of Spain|Spanish law]], such as the [[prior appropriation doctrine]] and [[community property]], still persist in some US states, particularly those that were part of the [[Mexican Cession]] in 1848.

Under the doctrine of [[Federalism in the United States|federalism]], each state has its own [[State court (United States)|separate court system]], and the ability to legislate within areas not reserved to the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]].

[[File:Libanius the sophist.jpg|thumbnail|right|Libanius as imagined in an eighteenth-century woodcut.]]
'''Libanius''' ({{lang-el|Λιβάνιος}}, ''Libanios''; c. 314 – 392 or 393) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] teacher of rhetoric of the [[Sophist]] school. During the rise of [[Christianity|Christian]] [[hegemony]] in the later [[Roman Empire]], he remained unconverted and in religious matters was a [[Hellenistic Pagan|pagan Hellene]].

==Life==
Libanius was born into a once-influential, deeply cultured family of [[Antioch]] that had recently come into diminished circumstances. At fourteen years old he began his study of [[rhetoric]], for which he withdrew from public life and devoted himself to philosophy. Unfamiliar with [[Latin (language)|Latin literature]], he deplored its influence.

Libanius used his arts of rhetoric to advance various private and political causes. He attacked the increasing imperial pressures on the traditional city-oriented culture that had been supported and dominated by the local upper classes.
 
He studied in [[History of Athens#Roman Athens|Athens]] and began his career in [[Constantinople]] as a private tutor. He was temporarily exiled to [[Nicomedia]] but returned to Constantinople and taught there until 354.&lt;ref name="GS370"/&gt; Before his exile, Libanius was a friend of the emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]], with whom some correspondence survives, and in whose memory he wrote a series of orations; they were composed between 362 and 365. In 354 he accepted the chair of rhetoric in Antioch, his birthplace, where he stayed until his death. His pupils included both pagans and Christians.&lt;ref name="GS370"&gt;{{cite book | title=Dictionary of Ancient History | editor1-last=Speake | editor1-first=Graham | publisher=Penguin Books | location=London | year=1994 | page=370 | isbn=0-14-051260-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The surviving works of Libanius, which include over 1,600 letters and 64 speeches, are valuable as a historical source for the changing world of the later 4th century.&lt;ref name="GS370"/&gt; His oration "A Reply To [[Aelius Aristides|Aristides]] On Behalf Of The Dancers" is one of the most important records of Roman [[concert dance]], particularly that immensely popular form known as [[pantomime]].&lt;ref&gt;Alessandra Zanobi, ''Ancient Pantomime and its Reception'', Article retrieved April 2016 [http://www.apgrd.ox.ac.uk/learning/short-guides/ancient-pantomime-and-its-reception]&lt;/ref&gt; His first ''Oration I'' is an autobiographical narrative, first written in 374 and revised throughout his life, a scholar's account that ends as an old exile's private journal.

Although Libanius was not a Christian his students included such notable [[Christianity|Christians]] as [[John Chrysostom]] and [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Averil Cameron|Cameron, A.]] (1998) "Education and literary culture" in Cameron, A. and [[Peter Garnsey|Garnsey, P.]] (eds.) ''[[The Cambridge Ancient History|The Cambridge ancient history: Vol. XIII The late empire, A.D. 337-425]]''. Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], pp. 668-669.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his friendship with the restorationist Emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] he was made an honorary ''[[praetorian prefect]]'' by the Christian Emperor [[Theodosius I]].

== Works ==
*64 [[oration]]s in the three fields of oratory: judicial, deliberative and epideictic, both orations as if delivered in public and orations meant to be privately read (aloud) in the study. The two volumes of selections in the [[Loeb Classical Library]] devote one volume to Libanius' orations that bear on the emperor Julian, the other on Theodosius; the most famous is his "Lamentation" about the desecration of the temples (Περὶ τῶν Ἱερῶν);
*51 ''declamationes'', a traditional public-speaking format of Rhetoric in Antiquity, taking set topics with historical and [[Greek mythology|mythological]] themes (translations into English by e.g. D.A. Russell, "Libanius: Imaginary Speeches"; M. Johansson, "Libanius' Declamations 9 and 10"; 
*57 ''hypotheses'' or introductions to [[Demosthenes]]' orations (written ''ca'' 352), in which he sets them in historical context for the novice reader, without polemics;
*several dozen model writing exercises, ''Progymnasmata,'' that were used in his courses of instruction and became widely admired models of good style; 
*1545 letters have been preserved, more letters than those of Cicero. Some 400 additional letters in Latin were later accepted, purporting to be translations, but a dispassionate examination of the texts themselves shows them to be misattributed or forgeries, by the Italian [[humanism|humanist]] Francesco Zambeccari in the 15th century. Among his correspondents there was [[Censorius Datianus]].

The following is a '''list of characters''' in '''''[[The Aquabats! Super Show!]]''''', an American action-comedy television series which aired on the United States cable channel [[The Hub (TV channel)|The Hub]] for two seasons from March 3, 2012 to January 18, 2014.

A mix of live-action and animation, ''The Aquabats! Super Show!'' follows the adventures of [[The Aquabats]], a band of [[superhero]] rock musicians as they defend the world against a variety of villains and monsters. The series is predominantly based upon The Aquabats' own background as a real-life band, and as such has adapted numerous characters from the band's [[The Aquabats#Live performances|stage shows]] and elaborate fictional [[The Aquabats#Superhero mythology|mythology]].

==Main characters==

===The Aquabats===
'''[[The Aquabats]]''' are a band of superhero rock musicians who travel the countryside fighting the forces of evil while moonlighting as a struggling rock and roll band. Despite their variety of superpowers, abilities and technology, the group are generally bumbling and inexperienced, and more often than not save the day by sheer luck or crudely unorthodox methods. In the series' first season, The Aquabats are depicted as an obscure and mostly out-of-work local superhero team, overshadowed by other, more competent superheroes and usually only stumbling into trouble they're directly or indirectly the cause of. After saving the world in the season finale, however, the band are recognized and treated as international heroes and celebrities in the second season, receiving top-priority government assignments and even sponsoring their own [[summer camp]].

The Aquabats live and travel by way of the '''BattleTram''', a modified [[recreational vehicle]] which serves as a combination [[sleeper bus|tour bus]] and mobile [[command center]]. Unlike most other superheroes, The Aquabats have no [[alter ego]]s to speak of, and are never seen without their trademark masks and helmets. The band's [[origin story]] was kept intentionally vague by the series' writers; while the first season made no references or allusions to the group's history, several episodes of the second season feature each member of The Aquabats recounting how they came together via animated [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]] sequences. However, as each of these flashbacks directly contradict one another, it remains unknown if any could be considered officially canonical.

The five members of The Aquabats are:
[[File:The Aquabats 3.JPG|thumb|250px|The Aquabats, seen here performing live in 2012, play themselves as their fictionalized stage counterparts in ''The Aquabats! Super Show!'']]
* '''The MC Bat Commander''' (played by [[Christian Jacobs]]) – The Aquabats' [[singer|lead singer]] and "fearless leader". The Commander possesses great [[Endurance|stamina]] and a swaggering [[wikt:bravado|bravado]], but unlike his bandmates, doesn't have any actual [[Superpower (ability)|superpowers]]. He is depicted as naive and impulsive to a fault, such as being unable to turn down any kind of bet no matter how the odds are stacked against him, but his sharp and decisive leadership skills have led the band to victory on several occasions.
* '''Crash McLarson''' (played by [[Chad Larson]]) – The band's burly [[bass guitar]]ist.  Despite being the brawniest of The Aquabats, Crash is often the most cowardly member of the team, though also the most well-meaning and good-natured. Crash has the ability to grow up to 100 feet in size but has yet to learn how to fully control his powers, growing mostly when he experiences overwhelmingly negative emotions. As one of the few characters with a [[catchphrase]], Crash often exclaims "GETTING EMOTIONAL!" right before he starts to grow.
* '''Jimmy the Robot''' (played by [[James Briggs (musician)|James R. Briggs, Jr.]]) – The Aquabats' [[keyboardist]]. An [[android (robot)|android]], Jimmy has a variety of powers and abilities, including a vast array of built-in weaponry. With his superhuman knowledge database, he also serves as The Aquabats' resident [[scientist]], aiding the band in matters of science and technology. As per his mechanical nature, Jimmy has an emotionless robotic personality and is regularly confused by human emotions and behavior, a constant source of teasing from his bandmates. Jimmy's personality was the only notable change from the series' pilot, wherein he had a more sarcastic human attitude.
:While all of the other Aquabats' flashbacks regarding their origins contradict each other, Jimmy is the only member to have a confirmed history prior to joining the band, having been built by eccentric farmer Ralph Goodman ([[Mark Mothersbaugh]]) as a helper droid on an apple farm before leaving on his own to follow his dreams of becoming a crime-fighting musician.

* '''Ricky Fitness''' (played by [[Richard Falomir]]) – The Aquabats' [[drummer]], who possesses the power of [[Speedster (fiction)|super speed]]. True to his name, Ricky is the most health-conscious of the group, eschewing the other members' fondness for junk food and lethargy to maintain a regular focus on keeping fit and trim. Ricky is portrayed as somewhat of a ladies man; a [[running gag]] throughout the series finds him flirting or being flirted with by various female characters, even in the middle of fight scenes or other tense situations.
* '''EagleBones Falconhawk''' (played by [[Ian Fowles]]) – The Aquabats' [[guitarist]], the "sonic [[Shred guitar|shredder]]". A skilled guitarist, EagleBones is equipped with a weaponized [[electric guitar]] which blasts energy beams out of its [[headstock]]. Following an encounter in the desert with the "Spirit of the Sun", EagleBones was bestowed with a [[spirit guide]], an invisible female eagle named '''The Dude''' whom he summons to aide him in battle, as well as the gift of [[second sight]]. While EagleBones was originally depicted as the cocky and often conceited [[wikt:maverick|maverick]] of the band, he has since displayed a more [[altruism|altruistic]] demeanor, finding it hard to refuse any civilian's request for help.

==Supplemental characters==

===Villains===

====Live-action====
* '''ManAnt''' (voiced by [[Mr. Lawrence]], performed by [[Supernova (American band)|Art Mitchell]]) – An [[ant]]-headed humanoid in a three-piece pinstriped suit who was inadvertently created by a young Crash McLarson following a [[genie]] wish gone awry. Accidentally abandoned by young Crash just moments after his creation, ManAnt bitterly turned to evil, spending years recruiting a team of henchmen to assist him in his plans for world domination. After capturing Crash in the episode "ManAnt!", ManAnt siphons Crash's growth powers to assume human size, further using it to give rise to an army of giant ants to carry out his bidding
* '''EagleClaw Falconhawk''' (played by [[Jon Heder]]) – EagleBones' estranged older brother who inexplicably has eagle talons for hands. He bears a lifelong jealous grudge against his brother, both for always being the center of attention in the Falconhawk family and for unknowingly stealing his childhood sweetheart when they were kids (even though EagleBones claims he never liked her). Like EagleBones, EagleClaw exhibits exceptionally proficient skills on laser-powered electric guitar, and appears in the episode "EagleClaw!" to challenge his brother to a showdown.
* '''Eva Mudlark''' (played by Katharine Towne) – A descendent of a long line of lowly garbage collectors, Eva Mudlark is a manic German-accented [[mad scientist]] who uses her scientific prowess to animate piles of garbage into monster minions in an attempt to redeem her family name. When The Aquabats destroy one of her creations, Eva plots for revenge by creating a sentient creature out of [[Lint (material)|dryer lint]] and the Aquabats' dirty clothes. She was eventually crushed by the remains of the new monster. She is the primary villain of the episode "Laundry Day!"
* '''Quera, Hera &amp; Vera''' (all played by [[Janet Paraiso]]) – A three-headed [[Siren (mythology)|siren]] whose enchanting singing hypnotizes men to carry out their devious bidding. All three of her heads extend from long necks, though two are usually hidden underneath a thick [[parka]] to remain inconspicuous. While Hera and Vera are cruel and manipulative, Quera is quiet and sensitive. Ricky Fitness falls smitten with Quera during a party on the Battletram, and after the three are banished to the [[Underworld]] by a gang of biker [[mummy|mummies]], he begins a [[long-distance relationship]] with her. Quera, Hera &amp; Vera appear in the episode "Ladyfingers!".
* '''Cowboy Android Sheriff''' (played and voiced by [[Paul Scheer]], faceless body performed by [[Matt Gorney]]) - A robot [[gunfighter|gunslinger]] modeled after a popular movie titled ''Cowboy Androids'', the Cowboy Android Sheriff was designed to be a feature of a hyper-realistic [[American Old West|Western]]-themed [[amusement park]] until his circuitry malfunctioned, turning him from a docile servant droid into a sadistic lawman who holds the park's tourists captive under his brutal enforcement. The character and plot are heavily based upon the 1973 science fiction film ''[[Westworld (film)|Westworld]]''. He is the primary antagonist of the episode "Cowboy Android Sheriff!".
* '''Überchaun''' (played by [[Dana Michael Woods]]) – A sinister blue-skinned [[leprechaun]] who lives on a golf course, the Überchaun impulsively places curses upon people who he perceives to have wronged him. As per his mischievous nature, he presents each cursed person with a series of three challenges to complete in order to break the spell( tie a [[ribbon]] to the top of an ancient tree, pull the flag out of the 13th hole of the golf course, and to fetch him a [[cherry soda]] from the clubhouse's [[vending machine]]), though devises a series of tricks in an attempt to prevent them from succeeding. He is featured in the episode "Überchaun!".
* '''The Floating Eye of Death''' – A creature from an in-series ancient myth, the Floating Eye of Death is exactly what its name would imply, a gigantic floating eyeball who ensnares innocent people in its tentacled grasp and sucks out their souls with its deadly glare, transforming them into [[zombie]] slaves as part of a plan to devour the souls of every human on Earth. The antagonist of the episode of the same name, the Floating Eye of Death is a character derived from The Aquabats' music and band mythology, being the center of the song "Giant Robot-Birdhead!" from the 1999 album ''[[The Aquabats vs. the Floating Eye of Death!]]''.

* '''CobraMan''' (voiced by [[Brad Davis (Aquabats actor)|Brad Davis]]) - Another character adapted from The Aquabats' stage shows, CobraMan is a malevolent half-man/half-[[cobra]] hybrid wearing sensible slacks. As part of his mutation, CobraMan has two large cobras for hands, both of which shoot smaller snakes out of their mouths and can extend to great lengths. CobraMan works at a roadside [[sideshow]] under the employ of '''Carl''' (played by [[The Brothers Chaps|Matt Chapman]]), a shady [[wrestling mask]]-wearing carnival [[barker (occupation)|barker]] who attempts to steal The Aquabats' Battletram and take CobraMan out on tour. Carl is directly modeled in voice and appearance after the character [[Strong Bad]] from ''[[Homestar Runner]]'', a popular web cartoon created by Chapman. Both characters appear in the episode "CobraMan!".
* '''Space Monster "M"''' (played by [[Dallas McLaughlin]]) - A gigantic disembodied head from the far reaches of outer space, Space Monster "M" descends upon the Earth with the intent of annihilating the planet. He inconspicuously appears in the background of several episodes of the first season disguised as a small girl (inexplicably dressed as Vicki from ''[[Small Wonder (TV series)|Small Wonder]]''), though doesn't reveal his true form until the episode "Showtime!" after he gains supernatural strength and power from SuperMagic PowerMan!'s magic headband and proceeds to control an enormous destructive robot body.

:Space Monster "M" is one of the oldest characters in the [[The Aquabats#Superhero mythology|Aquabats mythology]], having been named in their 1997 song [[The Fury of The Aquabats!|"Theme Song!"]] as the malicious invader of The Aquabats' home island of Aquabania. Although this backstory is touched upon in flashback in the season two episode "Summer Camp!", it is unknown if this can be considered canonical as all of the origin flashbacks in season two contradict one another.

* '''Ronmark''' (played and voiced by [[Paul Rust]]) - First appearing in human form in the episode "Night of the Cactus!", Ronmark is an arrogant and egotistical man who hires The Aquabats to perform a romantic song for his girlfriend '''Zalga''' (played by [[Kate Freund]]), only to stiff them on the payment. After being sprayed with a liquid [[mutagen]] from an alien [[meteorite]] at the end of the episode, he later returns in the season two premiere "The Return of The Aquabats!" as a hideously mutated [[Cthulhu]]-esque creature (played by [[Mark Fordham]]) who attempts to destroy The Aquabats.
* '''Camp Counselor Jewel''' (played and voiced by [[Leslie Hall]]) - The main villain of the episode "Summer Camp!", Jewel is the extremely perky and outgoing counselor at Camp Radventures, a [[summer camp]] where children learn to become AquaCadets under the training of The Aquabats. Despite her caring and motivational demeanor, Jewel also happens to be a [[shapeshifting]] [[Therianthropy|werebeast]] known as a '''Were-Ape''' (played by [[Mark Fordham]]), who kidnaps children and forces them to mine for jewels as decorations for her gem sweaters. It is revealed that she's in a committed relationship with [[Bigfoot]].
* '''Silver Skull''' (played by [[Mark Fordham]]) - A mysterious cloaked figure in a silver skull mask who speaks in a "very purposefully bad [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] impression",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/Brittany_Frederick/2013/06/01/christian_jacobs_dishes_on_the_gerard_ |title=Christian Jacobs Dishes on the Gerard Way-Directed 'The Aquabats! Super Show!' |publisher=Starpuse |date=June 1, 2013 |author=Frederick, Brittany}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silver Skull is one of the main antagonists of the episode "The AntiBats!", who, for reasons unspecified, seeks to destroy The Aquabats in order to steal a [[brain transplant]] the band is transporting for a state governor. While the extent of Silver Skull's powers is as of yet unknown, it is shown that his silver skull-capped walking cane has the ability to shoot laser beams, with which The AntiBats were granted with their superpowers. Silver Skull is yet another villain adapted from The Aquabats' stage shows and mythology, having previously appeared in the band's 1999 pilot ''[[The Aquabats! Super Show!#History and previous attempts at a series|The Aquabats in Color!]]'', albeit in a remarkably different costume consisting of an [[afro]] and skintight [[unitard]].
* '''The AntiBats''' - The AntiBats consist of members of "local [[thrash metal|thrash]] heroes" Asthma (played by [[Mikey Way]], [[Kyla Broderick]], [[Brad Davis (beard man)|Brad Davis]] and [[Derrick deVilliers]]) and "[[dubstep]] whiz kid" Skillsawz (played by [[Matthew Gorney]], in a parody of [[Skrillex]]), two popular musical acts who unjustly lost a Battle of the Bands contest The Aquabats were judging. Vowing revenge, they strike a deal with the nefarious Silver Skull, who bestows them with otherworldly powers and a matching wardrobe to help them seek their vengeance against The Aquabats.
* '''[[Krampus]]''' (voiced by [[Robert Smigel]]) - Originated in ancient [[Alps|Alpine]] folklore, the Krampus was a beast-like creature who punished naughty children during the Christmas season, working in contrast with [[Saint Nicholas]], who rewarded good children with gifts. In ''Super Show!'', Krampus, frustrated by the [[political correctness]] of the holiday season in that even naughty children receive presents, invades the small village of East Krampton where he outlaws all mention and celebration of Christmas under penalty of severe [[Flagellation|lashings]] with the enforcement of his vaguely [[Nazism|Nazi]]-esque soldiers. He appears in the episode "Christmas with The Aquabats!".
* '''Kitty Litter''' (played by [[Mark Fordham]], voiced by [[Ben Garant]]) - A human-sized cat man who used to live in the [[landfill|city dump]], Kitty Litter once attempted to expand his garbage empire by littering the city with trash until he was thwarted by The Aquabats, gaining the power of [[teleportation]] following a mishap with a time vortex. In the episode "Kitty Litter!", he abducts the city's cutest kittens as part of scheme to power a gigantic robot and strew the world with garbage. Kitty Litter was formerly a villain in The Aquabats' stage shows, played by a person in a [[fursuit]] who would come out and throw litter at the audience, usually to segue into the band's cover of [[The Kids of Widney High]]{{'}}s "Throw Away the Trash".

====Animated====
* '''Moon Cheese''' (voiced by [[Evan Sinclair]]) - The primary antagonist in the first three cartoons of season one, Moon Cheese is a [[telekinesis|telekinetic]] alien who resides in the center of the [[Moon]] with his henchmen, the '''Moon Shadow Soldiers'''. He kidnaps the MC Bat Commander in a plot to sap his brain energy to power a laser to destroy the Earth, but his plan is quickly thwarted by The Aquabats. Moon Cheese's fate is never revealed in the first season, and it is unknown if he escaped prior to the Moon's implosion in the episode "Überchaun!".
* '''The Underwater King''' (voiced by [[Christian Jacobs]]) - The lazy King who rules over the underwater city beneath the surface of the Moon. In the cartoon in the episode "Laundry Day!", Jimmy the Robot is imprisoned in his underwater dungeon, where the King plans to melt him down into a refreshing beverage. Two episodes later, in "Haunted Battletram!", he makes his appearance, He tells Jimmy he will be his [[servant]] until The Aquabats [[flood]] the underwater city by breaking a hole in its [[dome]], but he just says, "Uh, I'm okay, I'm-a taking a nap." and isn't seen throughout the rest of the show.
* '''The Time Sprinkler''' (voiced by [[James Briggs (musician)|James R. Briggs, Jr.]]) - The Time Sprinkler appears in the final cartoon of the first season, throwing The Aquabats into a time loop in which they would perpetually repeat the last year of their life, sending them back to the season's first episode (and thus eternal [[rerun]]s). The Time Sprinkler is another character adapted from The Aquabats' stage shows, and was the subject of the song "Tiger Rider vs. The Time Sprinkler" on their 2005 album ''[[Charge!!]]''.

===Allies===

====Live-action====
* '''Pilgrim Boy''' (played by [[Samm Levine]]) – A reluctant superhero who dresses and speaks like that of a 17th-century [[Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrim settler]], Pilgrim Boy possesses the power to [[shapeshifting|shapeshift]] into any possible object. Although the act of doing so causes him great physical pain, his [[Puritan]]ical level of politeness forces him to transform at any given request. He assists The Aquabats in destroying a giant [[Jerusalem cricket|potato bug]] in the episode "Pilgrim Boy!".
* '''President Stuncastin''' (played by [["Weird Al" Yankovic]]) - The incumbent [[President]] within The Aquabats' universe, he appears in the episode "Pilgrim Boy!" hosting a [[press conference]] addressing the rampaging potato bug destroying Detroit's pineapple plantations. The character's name refers to the process of [[stunt casting]], in which notable celebrities appear in a film or television series in an attempt to boost ratings and publicity.
* '''Chainsaw''' and '''Catboy''' (respectively played by [[Courtney Pollock|Corey Pollock]] and [[Boyd Terry]]) - Two fellow superheroes in The Aquabats' metropolis who briefly appear in the season one finale "Showtime!". While neither of the duo's powers are fully explained, Chainsaw appears in a [[lumberjack]]-themed outfit with a [[chainsaw]] attached to his hand, while Catboy sports a pair of fuzzy cat ears and a furry tail. The two seem to have a contentious history with The Aquabats, almost coming to blows with each other during an argument over which superhero team should take on an impending alien invasion, though this is also not elaborated upon. Pollock was a member of The Aquabats from 1995-2006 while Terry co-founded the band's original line-up in 1994; both men used the stage names Chainsaw and Catboy during their tenure with the band.
* '''SuperMagic PowerMan!''' (played by [["Weird Al" Yankovic]]) and '''Lanolin Lady!''' (played by Stephanie Allynne) - The most popular and competent superhero team in the city, SuperMagic PowerMan! and Lanolin Lady! are a husband-and-wife duo who both possess such superpowers as flight, super strength and the ability to shoot lasers with the aide of a "magic headband". Reportedly, they have saved the world many times, and as a result, have sold more merchandise than The Aquabats.
* '''The Shark Fighter''' (played by [[Rhys Darby]]) - A wavy-haired, knife-wielding ocean vigilante, the Shark Fighter is, as his name would imply, a man skilled in the art of fighting [[shark]]s, a mission he assumed after his lover was eaten by one many years prior. In the episode "The Shark Fighter!", he teams up with The Aquabats to help defeat a roving gang of vicious land sharks, briefly taking Crash McLarson under his wing as his protégé. The character of the Shark Fighter is based and modeled upon The Aquabats' [[The Shark Fighter!|song of the same name]] from their 2011 album ''[[Hi-Five Soup!]]'' and thus has several traits borrowed directly from its lyrics, such as his method of transportation in "[riding] an otter like a motorcycle".

====Animated====
* '''The Gnarbarians''' - A tribe of friendly [[barbarian]] warriors who inhabit the alien planet The Aquabats crash-land upon in the episode "CobraMan!". They are ruled by the King Gnarbarian (voiced by [[James Briggs (musician)|James R. Briggs, Jr.]]) and Queen Gnarbarian (voiced by [[Christian Jacobs]]). The Gnarbarians' name is a [[portmanteau]] of "[[wikt:gnarly|gnarly]]" and "barbarians".
* '''The Professor''' - Introduced in flashback by the MC Bat Commander in the episode "Summer Camp!", The Professor is a kindly [[mad scientist]] who discovered The Aquabats washed ashore on a beach after they fled from their tropical island of Aquabania, giving them vague "chemicals" and instruments to help them become the world's first superhero rock and roll band. The Professor and his backstory are directly taken from The Aquabats' original [[The Aquabats#Superhero mythology|band mythology]], wherein the character was referred to as '''Professor Monty Corndog''' and played in the band's stage shows by musician [[Parker Jacobs]]. As all of the origin flashbacks in season two intentionally contradict each other, it is yet unknown if The Professor is officially canon, a product of the Commander's imagination and/or merely a tongue-in-cheek homage to the early years of The Aquabats' career.

===Unknown===
* The '''Fox Man''' (played by [[Joel Fox]]) - The Fox Man is a grown man wearing a cheap-looking fox costume who briefly appears at least once in the background of every episode. Despite sometimes appearing within close proximity to The Aquabats, he never interacts with nor is acknowledged by any of the series' characters. Apart from being an [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]], the Fox Man was never explained within the context of the series. He is played by the series' visual effects supervisor [[Joel Fox]].

&lt;!--Please DO NOT add any Marian, Josephian or Jesus images on this list without properly confirming or seeing a copy of the Papal Bull authorizing their coronation either through social media, the chancery or diocese or at the Papal archives in Rome. The list is continuously being monitored and any attempt to add or remove an entry is scrutinized for authenticity and veracity of the existence of a Papal document from Rome. Just because a Bishop or priest crowns an image DOES  NOT MERIT  that a Pope has expressively authorized such a Pontifical act in a canonical manner. Just because a Pope blesses a crown or places a crown on the image out of piety does not make it canonical or institutional, for many instances has a Pontiff placed a crown out of piety but has not issued a papal document for its canonical effect in the Church.   --&gt;

The following list enumerates the various [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Marian]], [[Saint Joseph|Josephian]], and [[Christological]] images venerated in the [[Roman Catholic Church]], by which a [[Pope]] has officially issued a [[Papal bull]] of '''[[canonical coronation]]''' either by the [[Pontiff]], a [[Papal legate]] or a [[Papal nuncio]].
 
[[File:Papal bull for the Canonical Coronation of Virgen de los Remedios de Pampanga from Pope Pius 12th.jpg|thumb|The Papal decree issued by [[Pope Pius XII]] for the [[canonical coronation]] of [[Virgen de los Remedios de Pampanga]] in 1956.]]

The very first Marian image crowned without a direct papal approval was by Cardinal [[Francesco Sforza Pallavicino]] with ''La Madonna della Oropa'' on 30&amp;nbsp;August 1620. The first Marian image Pontifically crowned was the painted image of ''La Madonna della Febbre'' (Madonna of Fever) on 27 May 1631 by [[Pope Urban VIII]] through the Vatican Chapter located at the Sacristy of [[Saint Peter's Basilica]].

The solemn prescription of ritual to crowning images is embedded in ''[[Ordo Coronandi Imaginem Beatae Mariae Virginis]]'' published by the [[Holy Office]] on 25 May 1981. Prior to 1989, papal bulls concerning the authorization of canonical coronations were handwritten on [[parchment]]. After 1989, the [[Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments]] began issuing the specific recognition to crown a religious image, spelling out its approved devotional title and authorizing Papal legate. Several venerated  images of the [[Child Jesus]] and [[Saint Joseph]] have also been granted a Pontifical coronation.

|Notre Dame de Bon Secours ||15 August 1880 || Lablachere, [[Ardeche]]&lt;ref&gt;Ad perpetuam rei memoriam. — Dioecesis Vivariensis intra fines in
paroecia de Lablachere conspicuum exstat sanctuarium sub titulo Beatae
Mariae Virginis a Bono Succursu, quod christifideles, non modo a finitimis
locis sed a longinquis etiam regionibus peregrinorum more ad ipsum
confluentes, pie devoteque celebrant. Loco quidem antiquioris et parva®
ecclesiae, quam saeculo decimo septimo vertente, iam quidam pii coniuges
sub eodem titulo fundaverant, hodiernum templum saeculo decimo nono
tantum erectum est; ipsumque, tribus navibus constans, amplitudine molis
atque ornatu, picturis parietum, artisque operibus quibus ditatur, plane
dignum omnium laudibus videtur; adeo ut inter regionis Vivariensis sanctuaria
principem nunc locum facile teneat. Illud autem sanctuarium cuiusvis
ordinis condicionisque christifideles frequentes visitant Beatae Mariae
Virginis de Bono Succursu simulacrum veneraturi, quod ab annis fere
ducentis et quinquaginta inibi servatur et colitur, quodque prodigiis gratiisque
clarum aureo diademate anno MDCCCLXXX Apostolica auctoritate coronatum
est. Eodem in templo divinus cultus nitide peragitur a frugiferae
Congregationis Beatae Mariae Immaculatae sacerdotibus, qui sanctuario
addicti religiosam vitam in adiectis aedibus vivunt bonoque spirituali

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4226">A '''grand couturier''' is a member of the French ''Chambre syndicale de la [[haute couture]]'', part of the '' [[Fédération française de la couture|Fédération française de la couture, du prêt-à-porter des couturiers et des créateurs de mode]]''.
== Criteria ==
The official criteria, designed in 1945, originally implied presenting a certain number of original models each season, created by a permanent designer, handmade and [[bespoke]] models, a minimum number of people employed in the workshop and a minimum number of patterns "presented usually in Paris".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://culture.france2.fr/mode/defiles-parisiens/une-appellation-reduite-a-11-maisons-103405.html?paragraphe=3 |title=Une appellation réduite à 10 maisons - HAUTE COUTURE - Mode - France 2 - France 2 |publisher=Culture.france2.fr |date=2012-12-19 |accessdate=2014-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, these criteria have been relaxed. The number of models to be shown on a seasonal basis has been reduced from 50 to 25. Also, the official appellation can be granted by the ''Chambre syndicale de la haute couture'' even if one criterion is not met.

=== Guests ===
Beside official members, the ''Chambre syndicale'' officially "invites" each season some "guests." They cannot use the term "haute couture" but only the term "couture" and can become grands couturiers after 2 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://culture.france2.fr/mode/defiles-parisiens/une-appellation-reduite-a-11-maisons-103405.html?paragraphe=1 |title=Une appellation réduite à 10 maisons - HAUTE COUTURE - Mode - France 2 - France 2 |publisher=Culture.france2.fr |date=2012-12-19 |accessdate=2014-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International ===
The ''Chambre syndicale'' also recognizes foreign grands couturiers who do not show in Paris, referring to them as "membres correspondants".

{{literature}}
'''Literary criticism''' (or '''literary studies''') is the study, [[evaluation]], and [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of [[literature]]. Modern literary criticism is often influenced by [[literary theory]], which is the [[philosophical analysis|philosophical discussion]] of literature's goals and methods. Though the two activities are closely related, literary [[critic]]s are not always, and have not always been, theorists.

Whether or not literary criticism should be considered a separate field of inquiry from [[literary theory]], or conversely from book reviewing, is a matter of some controversy. For example, the ''Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism|date=2005|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]]|isbn=0801880106|edition=2nd|location=Baltimore|oclc=54374476}}&lt;/ref&gt; draws no distinction between literary theory and literary criticism, and almost always uses the terms together to describe the same concept. Some critics consider literary criticism a practical application of literary theory, because criticism always deals directly with particular literary works, while theory may be more general or abstract.

Literary criticism is often published in essay or book form. Academic literary critics teach in literature departments and publish in [[academic journal]]s, and more popular critics publish their [[Book Review|reviews]] in broadly circulating periodicals such as the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'', the ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'', the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'', the ''[[London Review of Books]]'', the ''[[Dublin Review of Books]]'', ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'', and ''[[The New Yorker]]''.

== History ==
=== Classical and medieval criticism ===
Literary criticism is thought to have existed as long as literature. In the 4th century BC [[Aristotle]] wrote the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', a typology and description of literary forms with many specific criticisms of contemporary works of art. ''Poetics'' developed for the first time the concepts of [[mimesis]] and [[catharsis]], which are still crucial in literary studies. [[Plato]]'s attacks on [[poetry]] as imitative, secondary, and false were formative as well. The Sanskrit ''[[Natya Shastra]]'' includes literary criticism on ancient [[Indian literature]] and Sanskrit drama.

Later classical and [[medieval]] criticism often focused on religious texts, and the several long religious traditions of [[hermeneutics]] and textual [[exegesis]] have had a profound influence on the study of secular texts. This was particularly the case for the literary traditions of the three [[Abrahamic religions]]: [[Jewish literature]], [[Christian literature]] and [[Islamic literature]]. 

Literary criticism was also employed in other forms of medieval [[Arabic literature]] and [[Arabic poetry]] from the 9th century, notably by [[Al-Jahiz]] in his ''al-Bayan wa-'l-tabyin'' and ''al-Hayawan'', and by [[Abdullah ibn al-Mu'tazz]] in his ''Kitab al-Badi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond the Line: Classical Arabic Literary Critics on the Coherence and Unity of the Poem|last=van. Gelder|first=G. J. H.|date=1982|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|isbn=9004068546|location=Leiden|oclc=10350183|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Renaissance criticism ===
The literary criticism of the [[Renaissance]] developed classical ideas of unity of form and content into literary [[neoclassicism]], proclaiming literature as central to [[culture]], entrusting the poet and the author with preservation of a long literary tradition. The birth of Renaissance criticism was in 1498, with the recovery of classic texts, most notably, [[Giorgio Valla]]'s [[Latin]] translation of [[Aristotle]]'s ''Poetics''. The work of Aristotle, especially ''Poetics'', was the most important influence upon literary criticism until the late eighteenth century. [[Lodovico Castelvetro]] was one of the most influential Renaissance critics who wrote commentaries on Aristotle's ''Poetics'' in 1570.

=== Enlightenment criticism ===
{{Expand section|date=August 2010}}
In the Enlightenment period (1700s to 1800s), literary criticism became more popular. During this time period literacy rates started to rise in the public, no longer was reading exclusive for the wealthy or scholarly. With the rise of the literate public and swiftness of printing, criticism arose too. Reading was no longer viewed solely as educational or as a sacred source of religion; it was a form of entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Library: An Illustrated History|last=Murray|first=Stuart|date=2009|publisher=Skyhorse|isbn=9781616084530|location=New York|oclc=277203534|pages=132–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literary criticism was influenced by the values and stylistic writing, including clear, bold, precise writing and the more controversial criteria of the author's religious beliefs.&lt;ref name=Regan&gt;{{cite book |last1=Regan |first1=Shaun|last2=Dawson|first2=Books|date=2013 |title=Reading 1759: Literary Culture in Mid-Eighteenth-Century Britain and France|publisher=Lewisburg [Pa.]: Bucknell University Press |pages=125–130|isbn=9781611484786}}&lt;/ref&gt; These critical reviews were published in many magazines, newspapers, and journals. Many works of Jonathan Swift were criticized including his book ''Gulliver's Travels'', which one critic described as "the detestable story of the Yahoos".&lt;ref name=Regan&gt;{{cite book |last1=Regan |first1=Shaun|last2=Dawson|first2=Books|date=2013 |title=Reading 1759: Literary Culture in Mid-Eighteenth-Century Britain and France|publisher=Lewisburg [Pa.]: Bucknell University Press |pages=125–130|isbn=9781611484786}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 19th-century Romantic criticism ===
The British [[Romanticism|Romantic]] movement of the early nineteenth century introduced new [[aesthetic]] ideas to literary studies, including the idea that the object of literature need not always be beautiful, noble, or perfect, but that literature itself could elevate a common subject to the level of the [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]. [[German Romanticism]], which followed closely after the late development of German [[classicism]], emphasized an aesthetic of fragmentation that can appear startlingly modern to the reader of English literature, and valued ''Witz'' – that is, "wit" or "humor" of a certain sort – more highly than the serious Anglophone Romanticism. The late nineteenth century brought renown to authors known more for their literary criticism than for their own literary work, such as [[Matthew Arnold]].

=== The New Criticism ===
However important all of these aesthetic movements were as antecedents, current ideas about literary criticism derive almost entirely from the new direction taken in the early twentieth century. Early in the century the school of criticism known as [[Russian Formalism]], and slightly later the [[New Criticism]] in Britain and in the United States, came to dominate the study and discussion of literature, in the English-speaking world. Both schools emphasized the [[close reading]] of texts, elevating it far above generalizing discussion and speculation about either [[Authorial intentionality|authorial intention]] (to say nothing of the author's psychology or biography, which became almost taboo subjects) or [[reader response]]. This emphasis on form and precise attention to "the words themselves" has persisted, after the decline of these critical doctrines themselves.

=== Theory ===
In 1957 [[Northrop Frye]] published the influential ''[[Anatomy of Criticism]]''. In his works Frye noted that some critics tend to embrace an [[ideology]], and to judge literary pieces on the basis of their adherence to such ideology. This has been a highly influential viewpoint among modern conservative thinkers. [[E. Michael Jones]], for example, argues in his ''Degenerate Moderns'' that [[Stanley Fish]] was influenced by his [[adultery|adulterous affairs]] to reject classic literature that condemned adultery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Degenerate Moderns: Modernity as Rationalized Sexual Misbehaviour|last=Jones|first=E. Michael|date=1991|publisher=[[Ignatius Press]]|isbn=0898704472|location=San Francisco|oclc=28241358|pages=79–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jürgen Habermas]] in ''Erkenntnis und Interesse'' [1968] (''[[Knowledge and Human Interests]]''), described literary critical theory in literary studies as a form of [[hermeneutics]]: knowledge via interpretation to understand the meaning of human texts and symbolic expressions—including the interpretation of texts which themselves interpret other texts.

In the British and American literary establishment, the [[New Criticism]] was more or less dominant until the late 1960s. Around that time Anglo-American university literature departments began to witness a rise of a more explicitly philosophical [[literary theory]], influenced by [[structuralism]], then [[post-structuralism]], and other kinds of [[Continental philosophy]]. It continued until the mid-1980s, when interest in "theory" peaked. Many later critics, though undoubtedly still influenced by theoretical work, have been comfortable simply interpreting literature rather than writing explicitly about methodology and philosophical presumptions.

=== History of the book ===
Related to other forms of literary criticism, the [[history of the book]] is a field of interdisciplinary inquiry drawing on the methods of [[bibliography]], [[cultural history]], [[history of literature]], and [[media influence|media theory]]. Principally concerned with the production, circulation, and reception of texts and their material forms, book history seeks to connect forms of textuality with their material aspects.

Among the issues within the history of literature with which book history can be seen to intersect are: the development of authorship as a profession, the formation of reading audiences, the constraints of censorship and copyright, and the economics of literary form.

=== Current state ===
Today, interest in [[literary theory]] and [[continental philosophy]] coexists in university literature departments with a more conservative literary criticism of which the [[New Critics]] would probably have approved. Disagreements over the goals and methods of literary criticism, which characterized both sides taken by critics during the "rise" of theory, have declined. Many critics feel that they now have a great plurality of methods and approaches from which to choose.

Some critics work largely with theoretical texts, while others read traditional literature; interest in the literary [[Western canon|canon]] is still great, but many critics are also interested in minority and [[Women's writing in English|women's literatures]], while some critics influenced by [[cultural studies]] read popular texts like [[comic book]]s or [[Pulp magazine|pulp]]/[[genre fiction]]. [[Ecocriticism|Ecocritics]] have drawn connections between literature and the natural sciences. [[Darwinian literary studies]] studies literature in the context of [[evolutionary]] influences on human nature. Many literary critics also work in [[film criticism]] or [[media studies]]. Some write [[intellectual history]]; others bring the results and methods of [[social history]] to bear on reading literature.

==Value of academic criticism==
The value of extensive literary analysis has been questioned by several prominent artists. [[Vladimir Nabokov]] once wrote that good readers do not read books, and particularly those which are considered to be literary masterpieces, "for the academic purpose of indulging in generalizations".&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Nabokov]] ''Lectures on Literature'', chap. ''L'Envoi'' p. 381&lt;/ref&gt; At a 1986 [[Copenhagen]] conference of [[James Joyce]] scholars, [[Stephen J. Joyce]] (the modernist writer's grandson) said, "If my grandfather was here, he would have died laughing ... ''Dubliners'' and ''A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man'' can be picked up, read, and enjoyed by virtually anybody without scholarly guides, theories, and intricate explanations, as can ''Ulysses'', if you forget about all the hue and cry." He later questioned whether anything has been added to the legacy of Joyce's art by the 261 books of literary criticism stored in the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;D. T. Max (June 19, 2006).

'''Nanosocialism''' refers generally to a set of [[economics|economic theories]] of [[social organization]] advocating [[State (polity)|state]] or [[collective ownership]] and administration of the [[research and development|research, development]] and use of [[nanotechnology]].

== Politics ==

{{further|Regulation of nanotechnology}}

Nanosocialism is a stance that favors [[participatory politics]] to guide [[state intervention]] in the effort to manage the transition to a [[society]] revolutionized by [[molecular nanotechnology]].&lt;ref name="Berube 1996"&gt;{{cite journal|    author = Berube, David|    title = Nanosocialism|    year = 1996 |   url = http://www.cas.sc.edu/engl/faculty/berube/nanosoc.htm| accessdate=2007-01-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061225060622/http://www.cas.sc.edu/engl/faculty/berube/nanosoc.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|    author = [[James Hughes (sociologist)|Hughes, James]]|    title = Politics of Transhumanism|    year = 2001 |   url = http://www.changesurfer.com/Acad/TranshumPolitics.htm| accessdate=2007-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Nanosocialism" is a term coined by [[David M. Berube]], the associate director of Nanoscience and Technology Studies at the USC NanoCenter, who argues that nanotechnological projections need to be tempered by [[technorealism]] about the [[implications of nanotechnology]] in a [[technocapitalist]] society, but that its [[List of nanotechnology applications|applications]] also offer enormous opportunities for [[abundance (economics)|economic abundance]] and [[social progress]].&lt;ref name="Berube 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes 2001"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}
In the [[role-playing game]] ''[[Transhuman Space]]'', nanosocialism is described as a descendant of [[infosocialism]], in which [[intellectual property]] is [[nationalization|nationalized]] and freely distributed by the state. It is adopted by some developing nations to counter the hold corporations from wealthier nations have on [[copyright]]s and [[patent]]s. This fictional version of nanosocialism was coined by [[David L. Pulver]], the game's creator, who was unaware that the term had already been used by Berube.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3358">'''Narrativity''' is the extent to which a text tells a story,&lt;ref&gt;Sturgess, P. J. M. (1992). ''Narrativity: Theory and practice.'' Oxford, UK: Clarendon.&lt;/ref&gt; which is a storyteller's account of an event or a sequence of events leading to a transition from an initial state to a later state or outcome. There are four theoretical foundations of narrativity, represented by the notions of 
# [[narrative|narrative content]],
# [[narrative discourse]],
# [[Transportation theory (psychology)|narrative transportation]], and
# [[Transportation theory (psychology)|narrative persuasion]].
Narrative content and discourse are the linguistic antecedents of narrativity. Narrative content reflects the linear sequence of events as characters live through them—that is, the backbone and structure describing who did what, where, when, and why. Narrative discourse represents how the story is told—that is, storytellers' use of literary devices to expand on the narrative content, such as emotional change over the course of the story line and sequencing of events to create drama. Narrative transportation is the engrossing, transformational experience of being swept away by a story.&lt;ref&gt;van Laer, T., de Ruyter, K., Visconti, L. M., &amp; Wetzels, M. (2014). "The Extended Transportation-Imagery Model: A meta-analysis of the antecedents and consequences of story receivers' narrative transportation." ''Journal of Consumer Research, 40''(5), 797–817. {{ssrn|2033192}}. {{jstor|10.1086/673383}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Narrative persuasion is the effect of narrative transportation, which manifests itself in story receivers' positive attitudes toward the story, story-consistent attitudes toward the experience described therein, and story-consistent intentions. The higher the quality of narrative content and discourse in a text, the greater its narrativity and its real-world implications, such as narrative transportation and persuasion, as van Laer, Escalas, Ludwig, and van den Hende&lt;ref&gt;van Laer, T., Escalas, J. E., Ludwig, S., &amp; van den Hende, E. A. (2018). "What happens in Vegas stays on TripAdvisor? A theory and technique to understand narrativity in consumer reviews." ''Journal of Consumer Research''. {{ssrn|2702484}}. {{doi|10.1093/jcr/ucy067}}&lt;/ref&gt; show.

== The theory of narrativity ==
The extent to which story receivers experience narrative transportation and are "lost" in the narrative world depends on the level of narrativity of a text. Narratologists distinguish two components of narrativity: content and discourse. The difference between narrative content and narrative discourse is the difference between what is conveyed and how it is conveyed. The features of narrative content align with the structural components of a story (i.e., characters and events). Literary devices, which grant storytellers the power to frame the narrative, are associated with narrative discourse. Variations in these narrative elements affect transportation into the narrative and subsequent persuasion, as the theory of narrativity proposes.

== History ==
The traditional celebration was started by African slaves to celebrate the end of the sugar harvest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.totallybarbados.com/articles/about-barbados/culture/ncf/|title=National Cultural Foundation (NCF)|website=Totallybarbados.com|author=Brett Callaghan|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1940s, the crop over festival declined and remained discreet throughout the following decades. From 1958 to 1964, the event took place in the [[Kensington Oval]]. The Barbados government, through its Tourism Authority, returned to organizing the event in 1974. The National Cultural Foundation was established in 1983 (and officially started to operate in January 1984) to conceptualize and organize the crop over festival from then on. The 2014 edition lasted 8 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncf.bb/crop-over/|title=Crop over|website=Ncf.bb|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gov doc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://208.109.177.6/en/ShowPdf/380B.pdf|title=NATIONAL CULTURAL FOUNDATION 1983-8|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The purpose of the National Cultural Foundation is to:&lt;ref name="gov doc"/&gt;
* Stimulate the country's culture
* Manage the country's theaters and other cultural facilities
* Organize festivals

The Foundation relies on donors and a yearly-voted government budget to sustain its activities.&lt;ref name="gov doc"/&gt;

The '''Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act''' ('''NAGPRA'''), Pub. L. 101-601, 25 U.S.C. 3001 et seq., 104 Stat. 3048, is a [[United States federal law]] enacted on 16 November 1990.

The Act requires [[List of United States federal agencies|federal agencies]] and institutions that receive federal funding&lt;ref&gt;The [[Smithsonian Institution]] is exempt from this act, but rather must comply with similar requirements under the [[National Museum of American Indian act|National Museum of the American Indian Act]] of 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; to return [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] "cultural items" to lineal descendants and culturally affiliated Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations. Cultural items include human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony. A program of federal grants assists in the [[repatriation]] process and the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] may assess civil penalties on museums that fail to comply.

NAGPRA also establishes procedures for the inadvertent discovery or planned excavation of Native American cultural items on federal or tribal lands. While these provisions do not apply to discoveries or excavations on private or state lands, the collection provisions of the Act may apply to Native American cultural items if they come under the control of an institution that receives federal funding.

Lastly, NAGPRA makes it a criminal offense to traffic in Native American human remains without right of possession or in Native American cultural items obtained in violation of the Act. Penalties for a first offense may reach 12 months imprisonment and a $100,000 fine.

==Background==
The intent of the NAGPRA legislation is to address long-standing claims by [[federally recognized tribes]] for the return of human remains and cultural objects unlawfully obtained from prehistoric, historic, former, and current Native American homelands. Interpretation of human and [[indigenous rights]], prehistoric presence, cultural affiliation with antiquities, and the return of remains and objects can be controversial and contested. It includes provisions that delineate the legal processes by which museums and federal agencies are required to return certain Native American cultural items—human remains, gravesite materials, and other objects of cultural patrimony—to proven lineal descendants, culturally related Native American tribes, and Native Hawaiian groups.

Outcomes of NAGPRA repatriation efforts are slow and cumbersome, leading many tribes to spend considerable effort documenting their requests; collections' holders are obliged to inform and engage with tribes whose materials they may possess. NAGPRA was enacted primarily at the insistence and by the direction of members of Native American nations.&lt;ref name=CARRILLO&gt;Carrillo, Jo (1998). ''Readings in American Indian Law: Recalling the Rhythm of Survival'' Temple University Press, Philadelphia. {{ISBN|1-56639-582-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tribal concerns===
Tribes had many reasons based in law that made legislation concerning tribal grave protection and repatriation necessary.
*State [[Statutory Law]]: Historically, states only regulated and protected marked graves. Native American graves were often unmarked and did not receive the protection provided by these statutes.
*[[Common Law]]: The colonizing population formed much of the legal system that developed over the course of settling the United States. This law did not often take into account the unique Native American practices concerning graves and other burial practices. It did not account for government actions against Native Americans, such as removal, the relationship that Native Americans as different peoples maintain with their dead, and sacred ideas and myths related to the possession of graves.
*[[Equal Protection]]: Native Americans, as well as others, often found that the remains of Native American graves were treated differently from the dead of other races.
*[[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]: As in most racial and social groups, Native American burial practices relate strongly to their religious beliefs and practices. They held that when tribal dead were desecrated, disturbed, or withheld from burial, their religious beliefs and practices are being infringed upon. Religious beliefs and practices are protected by the first amendment.
*[[Sovereignty]] Rights: Native Americans hold unique rights as sovereign bodies, leading to their relations to be controlled by their own laws and customs. The relationship between the people and their dead is an internal relationship, to be understood as under the sovereign jurisdiction of the tribe.
*[[Treaty]]: From the beginning of the U.S.&amp;nbsp;government and tribe relations, the tribe maintained rights unless specifically divested to the U.S.&amp;nbsp;government in a treaty. The U.S.&amp;nbsp;government does not have the right to disturb Native American graves or their dead, because it has not been granted by any treaty.

==Description==
The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act is a law that establishes the ownership of cultural items excavated or discovered on federal or tribal land after November 16, 1990.  The act also applies to land transferred by the federal government to the states under the Water Resources Department Act.&lt;ref name="William C. American Indian Law 2004. Page 276"&gt;[[William C. Canby, Jr.|Canby&amp;nbsp;Jr., William&amp;nbsp;C.]] (2004). ''American Indian Law in a Nutshell''. St. Paul: West,. Page 276.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the provisions of the legislation do not apply to private lands.  The Act states that Native American remains and associated funerary objects belong to [[lineal descendants]].  If lineal descendants cannot be identified, then those remains and objects, along with associated funerary and sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony belong to the tribe on whose lands the remains were found or the tribe having the closest known relationship to them.&lt;ref name="William C. American Indian Law 2004. Page 276"/&gt; Tribes find the burden of proof is on them, if it becomes necessary to demonstrate a cultural relationship that may not be well-documented or understood.  Nowhere has this issue been more pronounced than in California, where many small bands were extinguished before they could be recognized, and only a handful, even today, have obtained federal recognition as Native Americans and descendants of Native American bands.

Congress attempted to "strike a balance between the interest in scientific examination of skeletal remains and the recognition that Native Americans, like people from every culture around the world, have a religious and spiritual reverence for the remains of their ancestors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://academic.udayton.edu/Race/03justice/NALR007.htm |title=Native American Graves Protection Act |accessdate=2009-11-12 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011231023931/http://academic.udayton.edu/Race/03justice/NALR007.htm |archivedate=December 31, 2001 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The act also requires each federal agency, museum, or institution that receives federal funds to prepare an inventory of remains and funerary objects and a summary of sacred objects, cultural patrimony objects, and unassociated funerary objects. The act provides for repatriation of these items when requested by the appropriate descendant of the tribe.  This applies to remains or objects discovered at any time, even before November 16, 1990.&lt;ref name="nps.gov"&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/history/Nagpra/FAQ/INDEX.HTM Frequently Asked Questions - NAGPRA], U.S.&amp;nbsp;Park Service.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the legislation passed, the human remains of approximately 32,000 individuals have been returned to their respective tribes.  Nearly 670,000 funerary objects, 120,000 unassociated funerary objects, and 3,500 sacred objects have been returned.&lt;ref name="nps.gov"/&gt; 

[[Image:Bia-map-indian-reservations-usa.png|thumb | right | 350px | Map of [[Native American reservations]]]]
The statute attempts to mediate a significant tension that exists between the tribes' communal interests in the respectful treatment of their deceased ancestors and related cultural items and the scientists' individual interests in the study of those same human remains and items. The act divides the treatment of American Indian human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony into two basic categories.  Under the inadvertent discovery and planned excavation component of the act and regulations, if federal officials anticipate that  activities on federal and tribal lands after November 16, 1990 might have an effect on American Indian burials—or if burials are discovered during such activities—they must consult with potential lineal descendants or American Indian tribal officials as part of their compliance responsibilities.  For planned excavations, consultation must occur during the planning phase of the project.  For inadvertent discoveries, the regulations delineate a set of short deadlines for initiating and completing consultation.  The repatriation provision, unlike the ownership provision, applies to remains or objects discovered at any time, even before the effective date of the act, whether or not discovered on tribal or federal land.  The act allows [[archaeology|archaeological]] teams a short time for analysis before the remains must be returned.  Once it is determined that human remains are American Indian, analysis can occur only through documented consultation (on federal lands) or consent (on tribal lands).

A criminal provision of the Act prohibits trafficking in Native American human remains, or in Native American "cultural items." Under the inventory and notification provision of the act, federal agencies and institutions that receive federal funds are required to summarize their collections that may contain items subject to NAGPRA. Additionally, federal agencies and institutions must prepare inventories of human remains and funerary objects. Under the act, funerary objects are considered "associated" if they were buried as part of a burial ceremony with a set of human remains still in possession of the federal agency or other institution. "Unassociated" funerary objects are artifacts where human remains were not initially collected by—or were subsequently destroyed, lost, or no longer in possession of—the agency or institution. Consequently, this legislation also applies to many Native American [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s, especially burial items and religious artifacts. It has necessitated masscataloguing of the Native American collections in order to identify the living heirs, culturally affiliated Indian tribes, and [[Native Hawaiian]] organizations of remains and artifacts. NAGPRA has had a dramatic effect on the day-to-day practice of [[archaeology]] and [[physical anthropology]] in the United States. In many cases, NAGPRA helped stimulate interactions of archaeologists and museum professionals with [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] that were felt to be constructive by all parties.

==History==

===Background===
The late 19th century was one of the most difficult periods in Native American history in regards to the loss of cultural artifacts and land.  With the founding of museums and scholarly studies of Native American peoples increasing with the growth of [[anthropology]] and [[archeology]] as disciplines, private collectors and museums competed to acquire artifacts, which many Native Americans considered  ancestral assets, but others sold. This competition existed not only between museums such as the [[Smithsonian Institution]] (founded in 1846) and museums associated with universities, but also between museums in the United States and museums in Europe. In the 1880s and 1890s, collecting was done by untrained adventurers.  As of the year 1990, federal agencies reported having the remains of 14,500 deceased Natives in their possession, which had accumulated since the late 19th century.  Many institutions said they used the remains of Native Americans for anthropological research, to gain more information about humans. At one time, in since discredited comparative racial studies, institutions such as the Army Medical Museum sought to demonstrate racial characteristics to prove the inferiority of Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Carrillo, Jo, ed. ''Readings In American Indian Law.'' Temple University Press, 1998. Pg 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maria Pearson===
[[Maria Pearson]] is often credited with being the earliest catalyst for the passage of NAGPRA legislation; she has been called "the Founding Mother of modern Indian repatriation movement" and the "[[Rosa Parks]] of NAGPRA".&lt;ref name="Still Running" /&gt; In the early 1970s, Pearson was appalled that the skeletal remains of Native Americans were treated differently from white remains. Her husband, an engineer with the Iowa Department of Transportation, told her that both Native American and white remains were uncovered during road construction in [[Glenwood, Iowa]]. While the remains of 26 white burials were quickly reburied, the remains of a Native American mother and child were sent to a lab for study instead. Pearson protested to Governor [[Robert D. Ray]], finally gaining an audience with him after sitting outside his office in traditional attire. "You can give me back my people's bones and you can quit digging them up", she responded when the governor asked what he could do for her. The ensuing controversy led to the passage of the Iowa Burials Protection Act of 1976, the first legislative act in the United States that specifically protected Native American remains.

Emboldened by her success, Pearson went on to [[Lobbying|lobby]] national leaders, and her efforts, combined with the work of many other activists, led to the creation of NAGPRA.&lt;ref name="Still Running"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gradwohl|first=David M. |author2=Joe B.

===Slack Farm and Dickson Mounds===
The 1987 looting of a 500-year-old burial mound at the [[Slack Farm]] in [[Kentucky]], in which human remains were tossed to the side while relics were stolen, made national news and helped to galvanize popular support for protection of Native American graves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Battle over Athlete Jim Thorpe's burial site continues |newspaper=Washington Post |date=17 March 2012 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/battle-over-athlete-jim-thorpes-burial-site-continues/2012/02/21/gIQAn5DLES_story_4.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''National Geographic Magazine'', March 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, several protests at the [[Dickson Mounds]] site in [[Illinois]], where numerous Indian skeletons were exposed on display, also increased national awareness of the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Neighbors Mourn Dickson Mounds` Demise |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=November 26, 1991 |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-11-26/news/9104170045_1_native-americans-jim-edgar-archeologists }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Return to the Earth'' project==
''Return to the Earth'' is an inter-religious project whose goal is to inter unidentified remains in regional burial sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.return2theearth.org|title=Return to the Earth|accessdate=2008-04-24|publisher=Religions for Peace|quote=Mission: The Return to the Earth project supports Native Americans in burying unidentifiable ancestral remains now scattered across the United States and enables a process of education and reconciliation between Native and Non-Native peoples.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 110,000 remains that cannot be associated with a particular tribe are held in institutions across the United States, as of 2006.&lt;ref name='mcc'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcc.org/news/news/2006/2006-04-19_returntotheearth.html|title=Return to the Earth|accessdate=2007-04-13|publisher=[[Mennonite Central Committee]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061120234305/http://www.mcc.org/news/news/2006/2006-04-19_returntotheearth.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project seeks to enable a process of reconciliation between Native and non-Native peoples, construct cedar burial boxes, produce burial cloths and fund the repatriation of remains. The first of the burial sites is near the Cheyenne Cultural Center in [[Clinton, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref name='mcc'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clintonokla.org/entertainment/cheyennecenter.htm|title=Cheyenne Cultural Center|accessdate=2007-04-13|publisher=City of Clinton, Oklahoma |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070407091455/http://www.clintonokla.org/entertainment/cheyennecenter.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversial issues==
A few archeologists are concerned that they are being prevented from studying ancient remains which cannot be traced to any historic tribe. Many of the tribes migrated to their territories at the time of European encounter within 100–500 years from other locations, so their ancestors were not located in the historic territories.&lt;ref&gt;George Johnson, "Indian Tribes' Creationists Thwart Archeologists," ''New York Times'', 22 October 1996, accessed 19 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Such controversies have repeatedly stalled archaeological investigations, such as in the case of the [[Spirit Cave mummy]]; fears have been voiced that an anti-scientific sentiment could well have permeated politics to an extent that scientists might find their work to be continuously barred by Native Americans rights activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.nevadajournal.com/nj98/02/cover_story.htm|title=The Nevada Journal: Scalping Science: Sensitivity Run Amok|author=|date=|website=archive.nevadajournal.com|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kennewick Man===
Compliance with the legislation can be complicated.  One example of controversy is that of  [[Kennewick Man]], a skeleton found on July 28, 1996 near [[Kennewick, Washington]]. The federally recognized [[Umatilla (tribe)|Umatilla]], [[Colville (tribe)|Colville]], [[Yakima Tribe|Yakima]], and [[Nez Perce tribe]]s had each claimed Kennewick Man as their ancestor, and sought permission to rebury him.  Kennewick, Washington is classified as part of the ancestral land of the Umatilla.

Archaeologists said that because of Kennewick Man's great age, there was insufficient evidence to connect him to modern tribes. The great age of the remains makes this discovery scientifically valuable.&lt;ref name="Custred_2000"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Custred, Glynn|title=The Forbidden Discovery of Kennewick Man|journal=Academic Questions|volume=13|issue=3|year=2000|pages=12–30|doi=10.1007/s12129-000-1034-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As archaeologists, forensic specialists, and linguists differed about whether the adult male was of [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] origin, the standing law, if conclusively found by a preponderance of evidence to be Native American, would give the tribe of the geographic area where he was found a claim to the remains.&lt;ref&gt;McManamon, F.&amp;nbsp;P. [http://www.nps.gov/archeology/kennewick/ Kennewick Man.] ''National Park Service Archeology Program.'' May 2004 (retrieved 6 May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  New evidence could still emerge in defense of tribal claims to ancestry, but emergent evidence may require more sophisticated and precise methods of determining genetic descent, given that there was no cultural evidence accompanying the remains.

One tribe claiming ancestry to Kennewick Man offered up a DNA test, and in 2015 it was found that the Kennewick man is "more closely related to modern Native Americans than any other living population." In September 2016, the US House and Senate passed legislation to return the ancient bones to a coalition of Columbia Basin tribes for reburial according to their traditions. The coalition includes the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, the Nez Perce Tribe, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation, and the Wanapum Band of Priest Rapids. The remains were buried on February 18, 2017, with 200 members of five Columbia Basin tribes, at an undisclosed location in the area.&lt;ref name="SR2017"&gt;{{cite news |date=February 20, 2017 |title=Tribes lay remains of Kennewick Man to rest |url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2017/feb/20/tribes-lay-remains-of-kennewick-man-to-rest/ |work=[[The Spokesman-Review]] |location=Spokane, Washington |accessdate=February 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International policies==
[[File:Distinctive marking of cultural property in Austria-from Flickr 141273020.jpg|thumb|right|Distinctive Marking of Cultural Property, [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict|Hague Convention]]]]

The issues of such resources are being addressed by international groups dealing with indigenous rights. For example, in 1995 the United States signed an agreement with [[El&amp;nbsp;Salvador]] in order to protect all pre‑Columbian artifacts from leaving the region. Soon after, it signed similar agreements with [[Canada]], [[Peru]], [[Guatemala]], and [[Mali]] and demonstrated leadership in implementing the 1970 [[UNESCO]] Convention. The UNESCO convention had membership increase to 86 countries by 1997, and 193 by 2007. UNESCO appears to be reducing the illicit antiquities trade. It is not an easy business to track, but the scholar Phyllis Messenger notes that some antiquities traders have written articles denouncing the agreements, which suggests that it is reducing items sold to them.&lt;ref&gt;Messenger, Phyllis Mauch. ''The Ethics of Collecting Cultural Property Whose Culture? Whose Property?'' New York: University of New Mexico, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

An international predecessor of the UNESCO Convention and NAGPRA is the 1954 [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icomos.org/hague/ |title=Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict |accessdate=2009-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970525145320/http://www.icomos.org/hague/ |archivedate=May 25, 1997 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hague Convention was the first international convention to focus on preserving cultural heritage from the devastation of war. Looting and destruction of other civilizations have been characteristics of war recorded from the first accounts of all cultures.

[[File:Minik in New York.jpg|thumb|left|[[Minik Wallace]] ([[Kalaallit]]) in New York, 1897]]
On September 30, 1897, Lieutenant [[Robert Peary]] brought six [[Inuit]] people from [[Greenland]] to the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York, at the request of the [[anthropologist]] Franz Boas, in order to "obtain leisurely certain information which will be of the greatest scientific importance" regarding Inuit culture.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, David H. ''Skull Wars: Kennewick Man, Archaeology, and the Battle for Native American Identity,'' p.78. New York: Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt;  About two weeks after arrival at the museum, all six of the Inuit people became sick with colds and fever. They began to perform their tribal healing process and were mocked for their bizarre behavior. These people became a form of entertainment for the Americans. By November 1, 1897, they were admitted to the [[Bellevue Hospital Center]] with [[tuberculosis]], which they likely had contracted before their trip. In February, the first Inuit died and shortly after that two more followed. By the time the sickness had run its course, two men survived.  ''[[Minik Wallace|Minik]]'' was adopted by a superintendent of the museum, while ''Uissakassak'' returned to his homeland in Greenland. Later, after being lied to and being told that his father Qisuk had received a proper Inuit burial, Minik was shocked to find his father's skeleton on display in the museum.

In 1993 the museum finally agreed to [[Minik Wallace#Inuit burial|return the four Inuit skeletons]] to Greenland for proper burial. Representatives of the Museum went to Greenland that year to participate. In contrast to peoples in other areas, some local Inuit thought that the burial was more desired by the Christian representatives of the museum, and that the remains could have just as appropriately been kept in New York.&lt;ref name="Hurst218-9"&gt;[[David Hurst Thomas|Thomas, David&amp;nbsp;H.]] ''Skull Wars,'' pp. 218-9&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Hurst Thomas]]' study of the case shows the complexity of reburial and repatriation cases, and the need for individual approaches to each case by all affected parties.&lt;ref name="Hurst218-9"/&gt;

===Protecting cultural property===
In the United States, the [[Archaeological Resources Protection Act]] (ARPA) protects archaeological sites on federally owned lands. Privately owned sites are controlled by the owners. In some areas, archaeological foundations or similar organizations buy archaeological sites to conserve associated the cultural property.

Other countries may use three basic types of laws to protect cultural remains:

*Selective export control laws control the trade of the most important artifacts while still allowing some free trade.  Countries that use these laws include Canada, [[Japan]], and the [[United Kingdom]].
*Total [[export restriction]] laws are used by some countries to enact an embargo and completely shut off export of cultural property.  Many [[Latin America]]n and Mediterranean countries use these laws.
*Other countries, such as [[Mexico]], use national ownership laws to declare national ownership for all cultural artifacts. These laws cover control of artifacts that have not been discovered, to try to prevent looting of potential sites before exploration.

The '''Northwest Caucasian languages''',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uni-jena.de/unijenamedia/-p-48431.pdf%3Frewrite_engine%3Did&lt;/ref&gt; also called '''West Caucasian''', '''Abkhazo-Adyghean''', '''Circassic''', or sometimes '''[[Pontic languages|Pontic]]''' (as opposed to ''Caspian'' for the [[Northeast Caucasian languages]]), are a group of languages spoken in the northwestern [[Caucasus]] region,&lt;ref name=EB&gt;Hoiberg, Dale H. (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; chiefly in three [[Russia]]n republics ([[Republic of Adygea|Adygea]], [[Kabardino-Balkaria]], [[Karachay–Cherkessia]]), the [[International recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia|disputed territory]] of [[Abkhazia]] (whose sovereignty is claimed by [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]), and [[Turkey]], with smaller communities scattered throughout the [[Middle East]]. This language group's relationship to other language families is uncertain. One language, [[Ubykh language|Ubykh]], became extinct in 1992, while all of the other languages are in some form of endangerment, with UNESCO classifying all as either "vulnerable," "endangered," or "severely endangered."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/languages-atlas/index.php|title=UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in danger|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main features ==

=== Phonetics ===

The entire family is characterised by a paucity of [[phoneme|phonemic]] vowels (two or three, depending upon the analysis) coupled with rich consonantal systems that include many forms of [[secondary articulation]].&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; [[Ubykh language|Ubykh (Ubyx)]], for example, had both the minimal number of vowels (two), and probably the largest inventory of consonants outside Southern [[Africa]].

[[Linguistic reconstruction]]s suggest that both the richness of the consonantal systems and the poverty of the vocalic systems may be the result of a historical process, whereby vowel features such as [[labialisation]] and [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalisation]] were reassigned to adjacent consonants. For example, ancestral {{IPA|*/ki/}} may have become {{IPA|/kʲə/}} and {{IPA|*/ku/}} may have become {{IPA|/kʷə/}}, losing the old vowels */i/ and */u/ but gaining the new consonants {{IPA|/kʲ/}} and {{IPA|/kʷ/}}. The linguist [[John Colarusso]] has further postulated that some instances of this may also be due to the levelling of an old [[noun class|grammatical class]] prefix system (so {{IPA|*/w-ka/}} may have become {{IPA|/kʷa/}}), on the basis of pairs like Ubykh {{IPA|/ɡʲə/}} vs. Kabardian and Abkhaz {{IPA|/ɡʷə/}} ''heart''. This same process is claimed by some to lie behind the development of [[labialized velar consonant|labiovelars]] in [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] which once neighboured [[Proto-Northwest Caucasian language|Proto-NWC]].

===Grammar===
Northwest Caucasian languages have rather simple noun systems, with only a handful of cases at the most, coupled with highly [[agglutination|agglutinative]] verbal systems that can contain almost the entire syntactic structure of the sentence. All finite verbs are marked for agreement with three arguments: [[absolutive case|absolutive]], [[ergative case|ergative]], and [[indirect object]],&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, Johanna (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; and there are also a wide range of [[applicative voice|applicative constructions]]. There is a split between "dynamic" and "stative" [[verb]]s, with dynamic verbs having an especially complex morphology. A verb's morphemes indicate the subject's and object's person, place, time, manner of action, negative, and other types of grammatical categories.

All Northwest Caucasian languages are [[left-branching language|left-branching]], so that the verb comes at the end of the sentence and modifiers such as [[relative clauses]] precede a noun.

Northwest Caucasian languages do not generally permit more than one finite verb in a sentence, which precludes the existence of [[subordinate clause]]s in the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] sense. Equivalent functions are performed by extensive arrays of [[noun|nominal]] and [[participle|participial]] non-finite verb forms, though Abkhaz appears to be developing limited subordinate clauses, perhaps under the influence of Russian.

==Classification==

[[File:Circassia in 1750.png|right|thumb|250 px|Territory of Northwest Caucasian peoples in 1830.]]
{{see also|Proto-Northwest Caucasian language}}

There are five recognized languages in the Northwest Caucasian family: [[Abkhaz language|Abkhaz]], [[Abaza language|Abaza]], [[Kabardian language|Kabardian]] or East Circassian, [[Adyghe language|Adyghe]] or West Circassian, and [[Ubykh language|Ubykh]].&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chirikba, Viacheslav (1996); p. 452&lt;/ref&gt; They are classified as follows:

* [[Abazgi languages|Abkhaz–Abaza]] (Abazgi)
** [[Abaza language|Abaza]] (49,800 speakers)
** [[Abkhaz language|Abkhaz]] (190,110 speakers)
* [[Circassian language|Circassian]]
** [[Adyghe language|Adyghe]] (590,000)
** [[Kabardian language|Kabardian]] (1,685,000)
* [[Ubykh language|Ubykh]] †

===Circassian dialect continuum===
{{see also|Circassian language|Proto-Circassian language}}
[[Circassian language|Circassian]] (Cherkess) is a cover term for the series of dialects that include the literary languages of Adyghe and Kabardian.

====Adyghe====
[[Adyghe language|Adyghe]] is one of the more widely spoken Northwest Caucasian languages. It has 500,000 speakers spread throughout [[Russia]] and the [[Middle East]]: 280,000 in [[Turkey]]; 125,000 in Russia, where it is official in the [[Republic of Adygea]]; 45,000 in [[Jordan]], 25,000 in [[Syria]], 20,000 in [[Iraq]], and 4,000 in [[Israel]]. There is even a small community in the [[United States]]. Four main dialects are recognised: [[Temirgoy]], [[Abadzekh]], [[Shapsugh]] and [[Bzhedugh]], as well as many minor ones such as [[Hakuchi Adyghe|Hakuchi]] spoken by the last speakers of Ubykh in Turkey. Adyghe has a large number of consonants: between 50 and 60 consonants in the various Adyghe dialects but it has only three phonemic vowels. Its consonants and consonant clusters are less complex than the Abkhaz–Abaza dialects.

====Kabardian====
[[Kabardian language|Kabardian]] has just over one million speakers: 550,000 in [[Turkey]] and 450,000 in [[Russia]], where it is an official language of the republics of [[Kabardino-Balkaria]] and [[Karachay–Cherkessia]]. Kabardian has the least number of consonants of any North-Western Caucasian language, with 48, including some rather unusual [[ejective consonant|ejective]] [[fricative consonant|fricative]]s and a small number of vowels. Kabardian itself has several dialects, including Terek, the literary standard, and Besleney, which is intelligible with both Terek and [[Adyghe language|Adyghe]]. Unlike the Adyghe, Kabardian lost many of the consonants that existed in the [[Proto-Circassian language]], for example the consonants /ʃʷʼ/ /ʐʷ/ /ʂʷ/ /ʐ/ /ʂ/ /tsʷ/ /dzʷ/ became /fʼ/ /v/ /f/ /ʑ/ /ɕ/ /f/ /v/.

===Abkhaz–Abaza (Abazgi) dialect continuum===
{{see also|Abazgi|Proto-Abazgi language}}

====Abkhaz====
[[Abkhaz language|Abkhaz]] has 100,000 speakers in [[Abkhazia]] (a ''de facto'' independent republic, but a ''de jure'' autonomous entity within [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]), where it is the official language, and an unknown number of speakers in [[Turkey]].  It has been a literary language from the beginning of the 20th century. Abkhaz and Abaza may be said to be dialects of the same language, but each preserves phonemes which the other has lost. Abkhaz is characterised by unusual consonant clusters and one of the world's smallest vowel inventories: It has only two distinctive vowels, an open vowel /a/ and a mid vowel /ə/. Next to [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] or [[labialization|labialized]] consonants, /a/ is realized as [e] or [o], and /ə/ as [i] or [u]. There are three major [[dialect]]s: [[Abzhuy]] and [[Bzyb dialect|Bzyp]] in [[Abkhazia]] and [[Sadz]] in Turkey.

====Abaza====
[[Abaza language|Abaza]] has some 45,000 speakers, 35,000 in [[Russia]] and 10,000 in [[Turkey]]. It is a literary language, but nowhere official. It shares with Abkhaz the distinction of having just two phonemic vowels. Abaza is phonologically more complex than Abkhaz, and is characterised by large consonant clusters, similar to those that can be found in [[Georgian language|Georgian]]. There are three major dialects, [[Tapant]] and [[Ashkhar]]. Some are partially intelligible with Abkhaz.

===Ubykh===
[[Ubykh language|Ubykh]] forms a third branch, with parallels to both Adyghe and Abkhaz. The population switched to speaking Adyghe, and Ubykh became extinct on October 7, 1992, with the death of [[Tevfik Esenç]]. A dialectal division within Ubykh was suspected by [[Georges Dumézil]], but the divergent form he described in 1965 was never investigated further. With eighty-one consonants, Ubykh had perhaps the largest inventory in the world aside from the [[Kx'a languages|Kx'a]] and [[Tuu languages|Tuu]] families of southern Africa with their extensive system of [[click consonant|click]]s. There are [[pharyngealisation|pharyngealised consonant]]s and a four-way place contrast among [[sibilant]]s. It was the only Northwest Caucasian language never to have a literary form.

== Relationship to other language families ==
A number of factors make the reconstruction of the Northwest Caucasian proto-language problematic:
* most roots in Northwest Caucasian languages are monosyllabic, and many are single consonants;
* the [[sound change]]s are often intricate, and a large number of consonants and sibilant contrasts provides further complexity;
* [[ablaut]] was extensive and still plays some part in the modern languages;
* [[Loanword|borrowings]] between languages of the family were frequent;
* extensive [[homophone|homophony]] occurs in the modern languages.

For these reasons, Proto–Northwest Caucasian is widely accepted as being one of the most difficult proto-languages to deal with, and it is therefore more difficult than most to relate to other families.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

===Connections to Hattic===
Some scholars have seen affinities between the Northwest Caucasian (Circassian) family and the extinct [[Hattic language]]. Hattic was spoken in [[Anatolia]] ([[Turkey]]), in the area around ancient [[Hattusa]] (modern [[Bogazkoy|Boğazköy]]), until about 1800 BCE, when it was replaced by the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[Hittite language]]. The name '''Hetto-Iberian''' (or '''Proto-Iberian''') was proposed by Georgian historian [[Simon Janashia]] for a superfamily comprising the [[South Caucasian languages]], other Caucasian language groups, Hattic and other languages of ancient [[Anatolia]]. (The Iberian in the name refers to [[Caucasian Iberia]], a kingdom centered in eastern Georgia which lasted from the 4th century BCE to the 5th century CE; it is not related to the Iberian Peninsula.)

Many Northwest Caucasian ([[Adyghe people|Adygean]]) family names have prefixes like "Hath" or "Hatti", and one of the well known Adyghe tribes has the name "[[Hatuqwai]]" ({{lang-ady|Хьатыкъуай}}) (From Хьаты ("Hatti") + Кхъуэ ("male or son"); meaning  "HattiSon").&lt;ref&gt;Burney, Charles (2004); p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

===Connections to Indo-European===
It has been conjectured&lt;ref&gt;Colarusso, John (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Colarusso, John (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; that the North-West Caucasian languages may be genetically related to the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] family, at a time depth of perhaps 12,000 years before the present. This hypothesised proto-language is called [[Proto-Pontic]], but is not widely accepted.

There does at least appear to have been extensive contact between the two proto-languages, and the resemblances may be due to this influence.

=== North Caucasian family ===
Many linguists join the Northwest and [[Northeast Caucasian languages]] into a ''[[North Caucasian languages|North Caucasian]]'' family, sometimes simply called Kavkazian (in opposition to [[South Caucasian languages|Kartvelian (South Caucasian)]], which is thought to be unrelated, albeit heavily influenced by their northern neighbours). This hypothesis has perhaps been best illustrated by [[Sergei Starostin|Sergei A. Starostin]] and [[Sergei Nikolayev (linguist)|Sergei Nikolayev]], who present a set of phonological correspondences and shared morphological structure. However, there is no consensus that the relationship has been demonstrated, and many consider the correspondences to be spurious for the reasons mentioned above. See the article on [[North Caucasian languages]] for details, as well as the external links below.

===Higher-level connections===
{{main article|Languages of the Caucasus}}
A few linguists have proposed even broader relationships, of which the [[Dene–Caucasian]] hypothesis is perhaps the most popular. Dene–Caucasian links the [[North Caucasian languages|North Caucasian]] (including Northwest Caucasian), [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Burushaski language|Burushaski]], [[Yeniseian languages|Yeniseian]], [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]], and [[Na–Dene languages|Na–Dene]] families. However, this is an even more tentative hypothesis than [[Nostratic languages|Nostratic]], which attempts to relate [[Kartvelian languages|Kartvelian]], [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], [[Uralic languages|Uralic]], and [[Altaic languages|Altaic]], etc., and which is widely considered to be undemonstrated.

A '''parentocracy''' is a system in which a child's education must conform to the wealth and wishes of parents rather than the abilities and efforts of the pupil,&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 1990:65&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to a [[meritocracy]], which distributes educational and financial rewards according to abilities and efforts. Parentocracy is a [[sociological]] concept that reflects [[political ideology]], and has influenced the organization of schools since the 1988 Education Reform act.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Fundamentally, the parents have dominating rights and choice in education regardless of means.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Since the [[Education Reform Act 1988|1988 Education Reform Act]], social policy has created a relationship between parents and schools in the UK, which is characterised by the [[principles of marketization]]. It is argued that parents are now primarily seen as educational consumers, whose choices determine the type of education their child receives. For example, a parent's choice to live in the [[Catchment area (human geography)|catchment area]] for a particular school potentially determines that child’s educational success. This idea{{ndash}}that parents are consumers through marketization{{ndash}}is countered by obligations and restrictions. The capacity to exercise choice is limited by social class, both on economic grounds and cultural capital, e.g., the actual cost of moving into an catchment area with a desirable school.

Sociologists Fulcher and Scott say that in a parentocracy, '''Resources + Preferences = Choice.'''{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} As Ball, et al. says, not everyone has the same resources to make the same decisions.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} For example, middle class parents are more likely to pay for tutoring for their child to pass exams, while working class may have the same intention but cannot. Ball also discusses how marketization only ‘appeared’ to create a parentocracy, by providing equal right to education and letting parents choose which they want their child to attend.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Sharon Gerwitz explored this, writing that middle class parents have more economic and cultural capital than working class parents, and this lets them take advantage of the choices available.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} They can send their children to schools they desire by having the ability to afford travel expenses, and that they can move into a catchment area easier than that of a working-class family. She also noted how middle class parents socialised their children into attending church just to get their children into schools considered reputable. This shows how, as Ball, et al. says, wealth largely determines the extent of choice.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Despite the argued inequality and lack of choice, many factors counter-act this. For instance labour policies included things such as education action zones to improve choices. Education action zones supposedly identify areas considered deprived so that they could be improved through additional resources. A recently approved proposal raises the school leaving age to 18.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} This increases parentocracy as it helps student of all backgrounds receive a higher education, as opposed to the previous age, 16, which restricted many students and families.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Another policy, EMA, also encourages more choice, as it enables students from a low income family ( e.g., working class) to have education equal to those from any class or ethnicity by providing an educational maintenance allowance that helps students stay in school past 16. Witty does think that the EMA policy helps keep working class students continue past 16, but he thinks that higher education fees stops them going further.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

As witty shows, fees are important in education, especially considering types of schools such as private schools, which require fees for admission, and even explored fees in higher education, such as universities.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Educationalists believed that a meritocracy would foster 'equality of opportunity' in education, breaking down some of the social class barriers that restrict people with fees.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Brown, however, suggests that we are now entering a 'third wave' in the history of schooling, moving away from the 'ideology of meritocracy' to a new ''ideology of parentocracy''. This is driven by a belief in parental rights, and strongly favours the philosophy of market principles in education.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Choice breeds competition—but if schools must compete for reputation, choices may actually become limited as popular schools cannot expand, so they become increasingly selective.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} The big school lottery programme explores this, providing statistical evidence that out of 830 appeals of parents who didn't get their choice for their child’s education, only 28 were successful and 95 per cent were dismissed all together.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Judd agrees with the views expressed by the programme, saying that between 25-50% of parents do not get their children into their choice of school.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} This is similar to the fact that schools can opt out of government control. This elaborates how those who can afford it can choose a school with high admissions cost ( such as a private school), while those who cannot are restricted to limited to free or less expensive choices. Even expensive schools, however, can fail.

Additionally, By 2008, nearly 90% of secondary schools in England became specialist schools, providing a range of specialist options from business, engineering, or maths—to humanities, music, and art.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Raey says that marketization created growing inequalities in education among parents especially in relation to class, gender, and ethnicity.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} With the introduction of ''parent contracts'', home and school contracts made parents responsible for students truancy, and put them at risk of fine, prosecution, or even prison.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

'''Political colours''' are colours used to represent a political party, either officially or unofficially. Parties in different countries with similar [[Ideologies#Political ideologies|ideologies]] sometimes use similar colours. For example, the colour [[red]] symbolises [[left-wing]] ideologies in many countries (see the [[Red flag (politics)|red flag]], [[Red Army]] and [[Red Scare]]) while the colour orange symbolizes [[Christian democratic]] political ideology.&lt;ref name="Reuchamps2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Min Reuchamps|title=Minority Nations in Multinational Federations: A Comparative Study of Quebec and Wallonia|date=17 December 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317634720|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the political associations of a given colour vary from country to country: red is also the colour associated with the [[conservative]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in the [[United States]]. Politicians making public appearances will often identify themselves by wearing [[Rosette (politics)|rosettes]], [[Boutonnière|flowers]] or [[Necktie|ties]] in the colour of their political party.

&lt;!-- Colors are listed here in alphabetical order. --&gt;
== Black ==
* Black is primarily associated with [[anarchism]]&lt;ref&gt;Sureyyya Evren,  "Black Flag White Masks: Anti-Racism and Anarchist Historiography." ''Affinities: A Journal of Radical Theory, Culture, and Action'' 8.1 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[anarchist symbolism]]), [[fascism]] (see [[blackshirts]]) and [[jihadism]] (see [[Black Standard]]).
* [[Anti-clericalism|Anti-clerical]] parties in the late 19th and early 20th centuries sometimes used the colour black in reference to the officials of the [[Catholic Church]] because the [[cassock]] is usually black.
* In [[Germany]] and [[Austria]], black is the colour historically associated with [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] parties, such as the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany]] and the [[Austrian People's Party]].
* In Greece, black is the colour of the [[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]], a far-right political party.
* In Italy, black is the colour of [[fascism]] because it was the official colour of the [[National Fascist Party]]. As a result, modern Italian parties would not use black as their political colour.
* In the Islamic world, black flags (often with a white [[shahadah]]) are sometimes used by jihadist groups. Black was the colour of the [[Abbasid caliphate]]. It is also commonly used by [[Shia Muslims]], as it is also associated with mourning the death of [[Hussein ibn Ali]]. It is now known as the flag colour of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]]. 
* In Russia, black represented monarchism and nationalist movements such as the [[Black Hundreds]] before their defeat at the hands of the communists.
* In India, black represents protest. In [[Tamil Nadu]] (a state in India), black represents atheistic human rights rebels who follow [[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy]].

== Blue ==
Blue is usually associated with [[centre-right]] or [[Conservatism|conservative]] parties, originating from its use by the [[Tory]] party (the predecessor of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]) in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why is the Conservative Party blue?|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4923050.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=20 April 2006|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blue and red are the colors of [[Progressistas|Progressive Party]], (which descends from the [[National Renewal Alliance]], the main party of military regime), as well as the [[União Democrática Nacional|National Democratic Union]] (the main [[liberal conservative]] party between [[1945]] and [[1964]]) the [[Party of the Republic]] and its predecessor, the [[Liberal Party (Brazil)|Liberal Party]]. Blue and yellow are the colors of [[Christian Democracy (Brazil)|Christian Democracy]] and the [[Brazilian Social Democracy Party]], a former [[centre-left]], now [[economic liberal]] party. Blue and green are the colors of the [[Democratas|Democrats]], the main [[liberal conservative]] party in Brazil in the [[New Republic (Brazil)|current republic]]. Blue was also the color of [[Brazilian Integralist Action]], the first far-right movement in Brazil, inspired by [[National Catholicism]]. The [[Brazilian Republican Party]] (a [[christian democratic]] party linked with [[evangelicals]]) and the [[conservative liberal]] [[Social Democratic Party (Brazil, 2011)|Social Democratic Party]] use a blue banner with green, yellow and white, the other three colors of Brazilian Flag, given less prominence than blue.
* In [[Bolivia]], blue is the color of the left-wing [[Movement for Socialism (Bolivia)|Movement for Socialism]].
* In [[Canada]], in federal-level politics the official colour for the [[Conservative Party of Canada]] is blue, while in the province of [[Québec]] light blue is associated with nationalist and secessionist movements (in reference to the province's prominently [[Flag of Quebec|blue flag]]).
* In [[Costa Rica]], blue is the color normally associated with the [[Social Christian Unity Party]], alongside red.
* In [[Ethiopia]], blue is the colour of [[Semayawi Party Ethiopia]]. It represents Hope Unity and Peace. [[Semayawi]] is an [[Amharic]] word meaning blue.
* In [[Finland]], blue is the colour of centre-right parties [[National Coalition Party]] and [[Blue Reform]].

* In [[Ireland]], blue is associated with the conservative [[Fine Gael]] party, known colloquially as "The [[Blueshirts]]" in reference to their roots in the right-wing National Guard of the 1930s.
* Two parties in [[Japan]] use blue. [[Democratic socialism|Democratic socialist]] [[Social Democratic Party (Japan)|Social Democratic Party]] and [[Social liberalism|social liberal]] [[Democratic Party (Japan, 2016)|Democratic Party]].
* The colour blue, normally of a lighter shade, is [[Blue in Judaism|of prime significance in Judaism]]. The [[flag of Israel]] features two blue horizontal stripes and a blue [[Star of David]]. See also ''[[tekhelet]]'' and [[Zionism]]. The colour is also strongly identified with the right wing [[Likud]] party.
* In [[Lebanon]], blue is the colour for the [[Future Movement]].
* In [[Malta]], blue is colour of the [[Nationalist Party (Malta)|Nationalist Party]].
* In [[Paraguay]], blue is the colour of the [[Radical Liberal Party (Paraguay)|Radical Liberal Party]], one of the country's historical parties.

* In [[South Africa]], blue is usually associated with liberal political parties, the most popular being the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]], the largest opposition party. The colour blue was also used by the [[United Party (South Africa)|United Party]], from which the [[Progressive Party (South Africa)|Progressive Party]] (the most senior ancestor of the Democratic Alliance) split in 1959.
* In [[South Korea]], blue now represents the centre-left [[Liberalism in South Korea|liberal]] [[Minjoo Party of Korea|Democratic parties]] since 2014. Before 2012, blue represented the [[Conservatism in South Korea|conservative]] parties.
* [[Turquoise (color)|Turquoise]] is used to represent [[Turkic peoples]] and Turkic heritage. It is also the colour of [[neo-Ottomanism]] represented by the [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|AKP]] as a contrast to the republican Red represented by [[Kemalism|Kemalists]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}
* In [[Taiwan]], blue represents [[Kuomintang]] (KMT), the largest conservative party. Blue refers to KMT and their allies [[Pan-blue coalition]].
* see [[Red states and blue states]] In the United States, since 2000 the mass media have associated blue with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Starkey|title=Living Blue in the Red States|publisher=University Press of Nebraska|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the party unveiled a blue official logo&lt;ref name="democrats.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democrats.org/news/blog/575|title=Change That Matters|publisher=Democrats.org|date=14 September 2010|accessdate=17 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019042631/http://www.democrats.org/news/blog/575|archivedate=19 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[red states and blue states]]). In the United States, blue is also often associated with organised labour since it represents "[[blue collar]]" workers (for instance, see the [[Blue-green alliance#United States|blue-green alliance]]).
** Opposite in Puerto Rico, the conservative [[New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico|New Progressive Party]] uses blue.
* Also use in [[Venezuela]] to represent the [[Democratic Unity Roundtable]], the large multi-ideological coalition of parties in opposition, probably as a counterpart to [[PSUV]]'s red.

== Pink ==
* [[Pink]] is sometimes used by [[social democracy|social democratic]] parties, such as in [[Socialist Party (France)|France]] and [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Portugal]]. The more traditional colour of social democracy is red (because social democracy is descended from the democratic socialist movement), but some countries have large social democratic parties alongside large socialist or communist parties, so that it would be confusing for them all to use red. In such cases, social democrats are usually the ones who give up red in favor of a different colour. Pink is often chosen because it is seen as a softer, less aggressive version of red, in the same way that social democracy is more centrist and less militant than socialism.
*In [[Brazil]], Pink is sometimes used by [[Democratic Labour Party (Brazil)|Democratic Labour Party]], a [[centre-left]] to [[left-wing nationalist]] political party member of [[socialist international]].

* Pink is the colour of the feminist party [[Feminist Initiative (Sweden)|Feminist Initiative]] in Sweden.

== Purple ==
Although purple has some older associations with [[monarchism]], it is the most prominent colour that is not traditionally connected to any major contemporary ideology. As such, it is sometimes used to represent a mix of different ideologies, or new protest movements that are critical of all previously-existing parties.
* Purple is often associated with [[feminism]] and when combined with black, is often used to represent [[anarcha-feminism]].
* In Brazil, purple is the color of some [[Progressive liberalism|progressive liberal]] movements such as [[Rede Sustentabilidade]] and [[Livres (movement)|Livres]]. This color is chosen because those movements consider themselves to be mixing the best ideas of the [[left-wing politics|left]] (associated with red) and the [[right-wing politics|right]] (associated with blue).
* In Europe, purple has been used to represent the [[Purple (government)|Purple governments]] of [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]], formed by an alliance of red social-democratic and blue liberal parties.
* In Italy, purple has been adopted by anti-[[Silvio Berlusconi]] protesters (see [[Purple People]]) as an alternative from other colours and political parties.

** Also the color of social democratic [[Vermont Progressive Party]].
* Purple is also unofficially used in the United States to denote a "swing state" (i.e. one contested frequently between the Republican Party, whose unofficial colour is red; and the Democratic Party, whose unofficial colour is blue). Purple is also used by [[centrism|centrists]] to represent a combination of beliefs belonging to the Republicans (red) and the Democrats (blue). It has also been used to reference [[Purple America]], a term used in contrast to "blue" or "red", noting the electoral differences nationwide are observed more on discrepancies instead of unity (see [[red states and blue states]]).
* In Uruguay, purple is the colour of the social democratic [[Independent Party (Uruguay)|Independent Party]].
* In Venezuela, purple is use by socialist [[People's Electoral Movement (Venezuela)|People's Electoral Movement]].

== Red ==
Red is traditionally associated with [[socialism]] and [[communism]]. The oldest symbol of socialism (and by extension communism) is the [[Red flag (politics)|Red Flag]], which dates back to the French Revolution in the 18th century and the [[revolutions of 1848]]. Before this nascence, the colour red was generally associated with [[monarchy]] or the Church due to the symbolism and association of [[Jesus Christ|Christ]]'s blood. The colour red was chosen to represent the blood of the workers who died in the struggle against capitalism. All major socialist and communist alliances and organisations—including the [[First International|First]], [[Second International|Second]] and [[Comintern|Third]] Internationals—used red as their official colour. The association between the colour red and communism is particularly strong. Communists use red much more often and more extensively than other ideologies use their respective traditional colours.
* In Europe and Latin America, red is also associated with parties of [[social democracy]] and often their allies within the [[labour movement]]. Sometimes these parties use pink instead, as a "moderate" colour instead of the more "radical" red, or "pink" used to describe the more moderate faction or membership within a left-wing party.
* Red is also the traditional colour of liberal parties in Latin America and was the colour use, for example, in Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua and Uruguay for liberal parties. However, these parties follow [[social liberalism]] more than [[classic liberalism]], thus seating in the centre-left. 
* In the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and Ireland, red is also the colour of the labour movement and the Labour (spelled Labor in Australia) parties in those countries. The use of red as a symbol is referenced in the British Labour Party's anthem, ''[[The Red Flag]]''.&lt;ref name="Hitchens2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Hitchens|title=The Cameron Delusion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8WvOBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA181|date=26 March 2010|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4411-2390-9|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** In the heyday of the British Empire before 1960, maps, globes, and atlases typically used red or pink to designate the [[British Empire]] or its Commonwealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Jay Klinghoffer|title=The Power of Projections: How Maps Reflect Global Politics and History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WhyPBHJV5VYC&amp;pg=PA79|year=2006|publisher=Greenwood|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; As soon as a colony became independent, it needed its own distinctive color and the practice died out.
* In [[Brazil]], red is so strongly associated with the [[left-wing populist]] [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]], the [[Communist Party of Brazil]], the [[Brazilian Communist Party]] and other [[far-left]] parties, that different left-wing movements choose not to use red as a main color in order to give themselves a distinct identity from the Workers' Party and the communists. The [[PSOL]] and the [[Brazilian Socialist Party]] invert the traditional color schemes of left-wing political parties and use red as a secondary color with yellow being their primary color; the Socialists also use white as a main color. Along with pink, the [[Democratic Labour Party (Brazil)|Democratic Labour Party]] uses blue and white as main colors with red as a secondary color. In the context of left-wing politics, red is the main color of the [[Popular Socialist Party (Brazil)|Popular Socialist Party]], a [[third way]] [[social democratic]] party which descends from the first incarnation of the [[Brazilian Communist Party]].
* Also in Brazil, red combined with black and white was formerly associated with [[Brazilian nationalism]]. The first incarnation of the [[agrarianist]]-[[centrist]] [[Social Democratic Party (Brazil, 1945-65)|Social Democratic Party]] and both incarnations of the Brazilian Labour Party (the [[Brazilian Labour Party (historical)|first]] a [[social democratic]] party and the [[Brazilian Labour Party (current)|current]] a [[populist]] [[liberalism|liberal]] party), use this color scheme. Red, Black and White are associated with the three races which form the ethnic composition of Brazil: the [[Amerindians]] (Red), the [[Afro-Brazilians]] (Black) and [[White Brazilians]].
* Belize's main conservative party ([[United Democratic Party (Belize)|United Democratic Party]]) is represented by the red colour.
* In Canada, red has always been associated with the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] because one of its predecessors was the ''[[Parti rouge]]'' (French for "Red Party").
* Japan's [[buddhist]] party [[Komeito]] has a red sun as flag. 
* The [[Colorado Party (Paraguay)|Colorado Party]] of Paraguay, a right-wing conservative party, uses red while its main rival the liberal [[Radical Liberal Party (Paraguay)|Partido Liberal Radical]] uses blue, contrary to the rest of Latin America.
* The [[Liberty Korea Party]], which is the dominant [[Conservatism in South Korea|conservative]] party in [[South Korea]], uses red as their official colour. Before 2012, the conservative parties used blue as their official colour.
* In Thailand, the Red Shirt movement derives its populist base from amongst the working class and rural communities, which oppose the established power elite in Bangkok.
* A key exception to the convention of red to mean socialism is the United States. See [[red states and blue states]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Starkey|title=Living Blue in the Red States|publisher=University Press of Nebraska|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since about the year 2000, the mass media have associated red with the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], despite the fact that the Republican Party is a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] party (see [[red states and blue states]]) The use is probably entrenched as many political organisations (for example the website [[RedState]]) now use the term. 
** The opposite in the case of Puerto Rico, as the liberal [[Popular Democratic Party (Puerto Rico)|Popular Democratic Party]] uses red.

== Saffron ==
In India, [[Saffron (color)|saffron]] is traditionally associated with [[Hinduism]], [[Hindutva]] and the [[Hindu nationalism|Hindu nationalist movement]].&lt;ref name="Saffron"&gt;{{cite book|title=Manufacturing Citizenship: education and nationalism in Europe, South Asia and China|author=Véronique Bénéï|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-36488-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?visbn=0-415-36488-4&amp;id=XCUNB8koN-8C&amp;pg=PA156&amp;lpg=PA156&amp;dq=Saffronization&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saffron was chosen because in Hindu [[Sanatana Dharma]], the deep saffron colour is associated with sacrifice, religious abstinence, quest for light and salvation. Saffron or "Bhagwa" is the most sacred colour for the Hindus and is often worn by Sanyasis who have left their home in search of the ultimate truth.

== White ==
White is today mainly linked to [[pacifism]]{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} (as in the surrender flag) and in politics of the United Kingdom to independent politicians such as [[Martin Bell]].
* Historically, it was associated with support for [[absolute monarchy]], starting with the supporters of the [[Bourbon dynasty]] of France because it was the dynasty's colour. Later it was used by the  [[White movement|Whites]] who fought against the communist "Reds" in the [[Russian Civil War]], because some of the Russian "Whites" had similar goals to the French "Whites" of a century earlier (although, it is worth noting that the Whites included many different people with many ideologies, such as monarchists, socialists, liberals, and others).
* Because of its use by anti-communist forces in Russia, the colour white came to be associated in the 20th century with many different [[anti-communist]] and counter-revolutionary groups, even those that did not support absolute monarchy (for example, the Finnish "[[Whites (Finland)|Whites]]" who fought against the socialist "[[Red Guards (Finland)|Reds]]" in the civil war following the [[independence of Finland]]). In some revolutions, red is used to represent the revolutionaries and white is used to represent the supporters of the old order, regardless of the ideologies or goals of the two sides.
* In Italy a red cross on a white shield (''scudo crociato'') is the emblem of Catholic parties from the historical [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] party.
* In [[Politics of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], the [[Taliban]] reversed the Islamist schema, using black shahada on a white background (symbol of purity).

* In Uruguay, the conservative [[National Party (Uruguay)|National Party]] is also known as "White Party", counterpart of the liberal "[[Colorado Party (Uruguay)|Red Party]]" during the [[two-party system|two-party era]].
* In [[Venezuela]], white has been the traditional colour of the [[Democratic Action]] party, one of the two parties that dominated the country's politics in the late 20th century (alongside [[Copei]]) and one of the parties currently in opposition to the [[United Socialist Party of Venezuela|PSUV]].

== Yellow ==
Yellow is the colour most commonly associated with [[liberalism]]. It is the official colour of the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party|Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe]] (ALDE), as well as being the colour of liberal parties in Germany, Romania, Estonia and the United Kingdom (the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]). Yellow or gold, usually together with blue or purple, is also often used to represent [[right-libertarianism]] and [[classical liberalism]].
* In Latin America, it is not unusual for left-wing parties to use yellow, as red was the traditional colour of liberals, especially in countries with prominent red-using liberal parties like Honduras, Mexico, Colombia and Costa Rica. 
* In [[Brazil]], yellow, combined with green, is associated with right-wing movements [[anti-corruption|against corruption]], anti-[[Workers Party (Brazil)|Workers Party]], supportive of [[impeachment of Dilma Rousseff]] and later, with support of [[Jair Bolsonaro presidential campaign, 2018|presidential campaign of Jair Bolsonaro]]. The association came because many of the protesters against Dilma wears the jersey of [[Brazilian national football team]], which is yellow with the numbers and some details in green, and because the protesters chanted that [[brazilian flag]] "will never be red" and "will be alwayas green and yellow". Red is the color of [[left-wing populist]] Workers' Party.
* Yellow is also associated with Judaism and the [[Jewish people]], although this may be seen negatively (see also [[Yellow badge]]) and since 1945 the blue [[Star of David]] is preferred.
* In East and Southeast Asia, yellow used to represent [[Monarchy|monarchies]]. For instance, in [[Thailand]] yellow represents [[Monarchy of Thailand|King]] [[Bhumibol]]. It was also the colour of the pro-monarchy [[Panchayat (Nepal)|Panchayat]] system in the [[Kingdom of Nepal]].
* It is also a common colour to represent [[Buddhism]], monks in [[Burma]] used it in the [[Saffron Revolution|anti-government protests]].
* In Argentina, yellow is the colour for liberal right-wing party [[Republican Proposal]], led by [[Mauricio Macri]].
* In Colombia, yellow is the colour of left-wing party [[Alternative Democratic Pole]].
* In Costa Rica, yellow is the colour associated with social democratic and progressive [[Citizens' Action Party (Costa Rica)|Citizens' Action Party]] (generally under a darker gold tone) and left-wing [[Broad Front (Costa Rica)|Broad Front]] (which uses a more lighter tone). It is also the colour of several [[Worker's union|unions]].
* In Honduras, yellow is the colour of far-left party [[Democratic Unification Party]].
* In Hong Kong, yellow refers to democracy because of the yellow umbrellas that were raised during the [[Umbrella Revolution]] in 2014.
* In Malaysia, yellow was used by [[Bersih]] (The Coalition for Clean and Fair Elections), a series of rallies attended by hundreds of thousands of Malaysians. 
* In the Philippines, yellow mostly refers to the [[People Power Revolution]], [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]], and the [[Aquino family]]. 
* In the United States, the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] has no official colour, but often uses the colour yellow because of its historical association with classical liberalism and in reference to a gold backed currency and free markets.
* Humanist and progressive party [[Primero Justicia]] in Venezuela uses yellow.

* In [[Politics of Hungary|Hungary]] orange is used to denote the [[national conservative]] [[Fidesz]], red the socialist [[Hungarian Socialist Party|MSzP]], black or gray the right-wing nationalist [[Jobbik]], green the green-liberal [[Politics Can Be Different]] (LMP), and blue the (now extra-parliamentary) [[Alliance of Free Democrats|Free Democrats]]. These colours are sometimes not officially used by the parties themselves, as many political groups exclusively use the [[Flag of Hungary|Hungarian tricolour]]'s colours (red, white and green) in their own licensed literature and logos.

[[GreenLeft]] uses a combination of green and red, although green is used more often. Blue is used by the conservative-liberal [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD). The [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] and [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|Socialist Party]] are both associated with red.
* In [[Politics of Nicaragua|Nicaragua]] the parties use flags as it is common in [[Central America]], the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]] uses a red and black flag and the [[Liberalism in Nicaragua|liberals]] use a red and white flag.
* In the [[Politics of the Philippines|Philippines]], the centrist [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]] uses yellow, the conservative [[Kilusang Bagong Lipunan]] (KBL) uses red, and the populist [[United Nationalist Alliance]] (UNA) uses orange. Aside from these "party colours", individual candidates may use a different colour; the colours of the three parties mentioned were derived from the preferred colours of [[Benigno Aquino Jr.]], [[Ferdinand Marcos]] and [[Joseph Estrada]], respectively. The Christian democrats [[Lakas–CMD]] uses blue and gold, and the [[Nacionalista Party]], while using the colours of the [[flag of the Philippines]], had used green and lately orange, the preferred colour of 2010 presidential nominee [[Manny Villar]]. While popularly known as "reds", the left had not used that colour in elections, using instead purple or dark blue. Other parties use party colours sparingly.
* In [[Politics of Portugal|Portugal]], the centre-left [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist Party]] (PS) use pink, on the centre-right [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD) uses orange and the [[CDS – People's Party|People's Party]] (CDS–PP) uses blue.
* In [[Politics of South Korea|South Korea]], the ruling conservative party [[Liberty Korea Party]] (former Saenuri Party) uses red as its colour, even though red is considered a leftist colour in Korea. In this case it is a kind of political strategy, to emphasise change and evolution.
* In [[Politics of Sweden|Sweden]], blue is used for the [[Moderate Party]] while red is used for the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Social Democratic Party]]. Green is used by the [[Centre Party (Sweden)|Centre Party]] and the [[Green Party (Sweden)|Green Party]].
* In [[Politics of the Republic of China|Taiwan]], the leading groups of parties are the [[Pan-Blue Coalition]], which leans more towards Chinese nationalism and the [[Pan-Green Coalition]], which leans more towards Taiwanese independence. The [[New Party (Republic of China)|New Party]] uses yellow as its party colour even though its policies are conservative; the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] uses green even though its international alignment is with the [[Liberal International]] and not the Green parties.
* In the [[Politics of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] (excluding Northern Ireland), the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] uses blue, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] uses red and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] use gold and orange. The right-wing populist [[UK Independence Party]] has chosen to use the non-aligned colour purple. The [[British National Party]] (BNP) use the colours of the [[Union Jack]], The centrist [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] (SDP) used red and blue. The [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) uses yellow and black and [[Plaid Cymru]] (PC) uses gold and green.
** In [[Politics of Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]], the [[Unionism (Ireland)|Unionist]] parties in the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] are called the "orange block" and the [[Irish Nationalism|Nationalist]] parties are the "green block". 
** Some of the established political parties use or have used different colour variations in certain localities. This was common in British politics up to the 1970s. The traditional colour of the [[Penrith and The Border (UK Parliament constituency)|Penrith and the Border]] Conservatives was yellow, rather than dark blue, even in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 election]] Conservative candidates in Penrith and the neighbouring constituency of [[Westmorland and Lonsdale (UK Parliament constituency)|Westmorland and Lonsdale]] wore blue and yellow rosettes. In [[North East England]], the Conservatives traditionally used red, Labour green and the Liberals blue and orange. In parts of [[East Anglia]], the Conservatives used pink and blue, whilst in [[Norwich]] their colours were orange and purple. The Liberals and Conservatives used blue and red respectively in [[West Wales]], while in parts of [[Cheshire]] the Liberals were red and Labour yellow. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the Tories used orange in [[Birmingham]], pink in [[Whitby]] and red in [[East Worcestershire (UK Parliament constituency)|East Worcestershire]], whilst the Whigs were blue in [[Kendal]], purple in [[Marlborough, Wiltshire|Marlborough]] and orange in [[Wakefield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-32510493|title=The seats where Tories weren't blue and Labour wasn't red|author=Jon Kelly|date=4 May 2015|website=[[bbc.co.uk]]|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional colour of the [[Warwickshire]] Liberals was green, rather than orange.
* In the [[Politics of the United States|United States]] the two major political parties use the [[national colours]], i.e. red, white and blue. Historically, the only common situation in which it has been necessary to assign a single colour to a party has been in the production of political maps in graphical displays of election results. In such cases, there had been no consistent association of particular parties with particular colours. However, in the weeks following the 2000 election there arose the terminology of [[red states and blue states]], in which the conservative [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] was associated with red and the liberal [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] with blue. Political observers latched on to this association, which resulted from the use of red for Republican victories and blue for Democratic victories on the display map of a television network. In 2004, the association was mostly kept. As of November 2012, maps for presidential elections produced by the U.S. government also use blue for Democrats and red for Republicans.&lt;ref name="US-NARA-map"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/map/historic.html|title=Historic Election Results|publisher=The U.S. National Archives and Records Administration|accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2010, the Democratic Party officially adopted an all-blue logo.&lt;ref name="democrats.org"/&gt; Around the same time, the official Republican website began using a red logo.
** This association has potential to confuse foreign observers in that, as described above, red is traditionally a left-wing colour, while blue is typically associated with right-wing politics.
** There is some historical use of blue for Democrats and red for Republicans: in the late 19th century and early 20th century, [[Texas]] county election boards used colour-coding to help Spanish speakers and illiterates identify the parties,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/pqrsu|title=Reds and Blues – The Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Tshaonline.org|accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this system was not applied consistently in Texas and was not picked up on a national level. For instance in [[United States presidential election, 1888|1888]], [[Grover Cleveland]] and [[Benjamin Harrison]] used maps that coded blue for the Republicans, the colour Harrison perceived to represent the Union and "[[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]]'s Party" and red for the Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tara A. Rowe|url=http://politicalgame.blogspot.com/2005/01/red-and-blue-state-phenomenon.html|title=The Political Game: The Red and Blue State Phenomenon|publisher=Politicalgame.blogspot.com|date=13 January 2005|accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** In the accounting world, red ink is used indicate a deficit (that is, spending exceeds income). Politicians often attack deficit spending as "being in the red."  For example Republican presidential candidate [[Robert Dole]] in 1996 denounced one of President Bill Clinton's proposals because it would impose new costs on small business. Dole said: "Now that the federal government is running in the red and state governments are faced with budget deficits that rise each year, the Democrats are looking for a new pocket to pick, and small business will fill that role."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicholas Laham|title=A Lost Cause: Bill Clinton's Campaign for National Health Insurance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lb2wMn4FRawC&amp;pg=PA84|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** In [[Politics of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]], the three main parties are: [[Partido Nuevo Progresista]] (blue), [[Partido Popular Democrático]] (red) and [[Partido Independentista Puertorriqueño]] (green).

* [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] ("the Mystic")
* [[Michel de Montaigne]] ("the Skeptic")
* [[William Shakespeare]] ("the Poet")
* [[Napoleon]] ("the Man of the World")

'''Ritualism''', in the history of [[Christianity]], refers to an emphasis on the [[ritual]]s and [[liturgical]] ceremony of the church, in particular of [[Holy Communion]].
[[File:BC St. Ignatius apse window 3.jpg|right|thumb|Image of a [[thurible]] in a stained glass window, St. Ignatius Church, [[Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts|Chestnut Hill]], [[Massachusetts]]]]
In the [[Church of England|Anglican church]] in the 19th century, the role of ritual became a contentious matter. The debate over ritual was also associated with struggles between [[High Church]] and [[Low Church]] movements.
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Defining ritualism and the arguments generated by it==
In [[Anglicanism]], the term "ritualist" is controversial (i.e. rejected by some of those to whom it is applied). It was often used to describe the second generation of the [[Oxford Movement]]/[[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholic]]/[[High Church]] revival of the 19th century which sought to reintroduce into the [[Church of England]] a range of [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[liturgical]] practices. The term is also used to describe those who follow in their tradition.

Arguments about ritualism in the Church of England were often shaped by opposing (and often unannounced) attitudes towards the concept of ''[[sola scriptura]]'' and the nature of the authority of the [[Bible]] for Christians.

===Common arguments of some Anglicans in favour of ritualism===
Those who support the ritualist outlook in the Church of England have often argued that the adoption of key elements of [[Roman Catholic]] ritual:
* gives liturgical expression to the [[ecclesiological]] belief that the Church of England is more Catholic than Protestant;
* gives liturgical expression to a belief in the [[Real Presence]] and concomitantly that the [[Eucharist]] is the most important act of church worship and should be the norm;
* is the most effective vehicle for giving expression to the worship of [[heaven]] as it is described in the [[Book of Revelation]] in which the use of white robes and [[incense]] in a setting of considerable beauty is described;
* is a liturgical expression of the story in the book of [[Gospel of Matthew]] of the response of the [[Magi]] to the [[birth of Jesus]] who brought the gifts of [[gold]], [[frankincense]] and [[myrrh]] as an act of [[adoration]];
* enables worshippers to use all of their senses in order to [[worship]] – worship with the whole person, not just the mind;
* is "[[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnational]]" – by placing an emphasis on liturgical action and physical objects, it draws attention to the importance that Christians should attach to the fact that they believe that, in [[Jesus]], "the Word became flesh" ({{bibleverse||John|1}}): those things are part of what God makes and saves, and not repudiated by Him;
* is the most effective form of worship for cultures that are either highly visual or in which [[literacy]] rates are low;
* is beautiful and an expression of the human response to God that calls on humans to offer their best in worship – a way of expressing the value ("worth") that they place on God : worship is, [[etymologically]], "worth-ship"

===Common arguments of some Anglicans against ritualism===
[[File:John Charles Ryle Vanity Fair 26 March 1881.jpg|thumb|150px|[[John Charles Ryle|Bishop Ryle of Liverpool]] – a leading critic of ritualism [http://www.churchsociety.org/publications/tracts/CAT004_RyleRitualism.pdf] – by [[Carlo Pellegrini (caricaturist)|Carlo Pellegrini]], 1881 (See link to his tract at the bottom of this article).]]
Those who oppose ritualism in the Church of England have generally argued that it:
* encourages [[idolatry]] in that it encourages worshippers to focus on ritual objects and actions rather than the things they are meant to symbolise;
* constitutes an attempt to wrest the Church of England from its Protestant identity;
* constitutes a downgrading of the significance of [[preaching]] and biblical exposition in regular Christian worship;
* encourages an idolatrous attitude to the Eucharist because ritualism is predicated on a belief in the Real Presence;
* uses excessive elaborations in worship that cannot be justified on the basis of the descriptions of worship in the [[Gospels]], the [[Acts of the Apostles]], or the [[Epistles]] in the [[New Testament]] – the robes used in the worship of heaven described in the Book of Revelation are plain white;
* undermines a key Protestant belief that no human actions, even worship precisely and carefully offered, can be of any value when it comes to being [[justification (theology)|justified]] in the eyes of God: worship should be an unfussy, obedient, [[penitent]], grateful, and spontaneously joyful response to the experience of [[Born again (Christianity)|being saved]] by [[sola fide|faith alone]] in [[Jesus]] – ritual and tradition are merely human inventions;
* has often impeded the understanding of the gospel by wrapping up [[Christian]] worship in indecipherable [[symbol]]ic acts.
* is not beautiful as proponents claim but rather gaudy and distracting from contemplative worship

==Ritualist controversies in the 19th century==
===Origins===
[[Image:A "fiddleback" chasuble from the church of Saint Gertrude in Maarheeze in the Netherlands.jpg|thumb|A "fiddleback" chasuble, the use of which by a priest could lead to prosecution]]
The development of ritualism in the Church of England was mainly associated with what is commonly called "second generation" Anglo-Catholicism, i.e. the Oxford Movement as it developed after 1845 when [[John Henry Newman]] left the Church of England to become a Roman Catholic. Some scholars{{who|date=December 2013}} argued that it was almost inevitable that some of the leaders of Anglo-Catholicism turned their attentions to questions of liturgy and ritual and started to champion the use of practices and forms of worship more commonly associated with Roman Catholicism. There was only limited enthusiasm amongst ritualists to introduce the widespread use of [[Ecclesiastical Latin|Latin]] in the liturgy.

[[Image:Biretta.gif|frame|left|100px|Traditional [[biretta]]]]
The leaders of the first generation of the Anglo-Catholic revival or Oxford Movement (e.g. Newman, [[Edward Bouverie Pusey]], and [[John Keble]]) had been primarily concerned with [[theological]] and [[ecclesiological]] questions and had little concern with questions of [[ritual]]. They championed the view that the fundamental identity of the Church of England was Catholic rather than Protestant.  They had argued that Anglicans were bound by obedience to the use of the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''. "Tract 3" of the ''[[Tracts for the Times]]'' series had strenuously argued against any revision of the ''Book of Common Prayer'', viewing its use as a matter of absolute obligation. Even ''[[Tract 90]]'', which analysed the [[39 Articles]], was more concerned with the theological dimension of the issue. It gave little attention to the question of altering current liturgical practice in the Church of England.

The ecclesiological questions gave rise to an interest in giving liturgical expression to the theological conviction that the Church of England had sustained a fundamentally Catholic character after the [[English Reformation]]. In some circles, the shift of focus to the question of liturgy proved as provocative as had been the theological assertions of the first generation of Anglo-Catholicism.

The clearest illustration of the shift that took place within Anglo-Catholicism from theological to liturgical questions is to be found in Pusey's attitude towards ritualism. Pusey, the only pre-eminent first-generation leader of Anglo-Catholicism to survive into the second generation, had no sympathy with the preoccupation with ritual. However, when priests started to be prosecuted and imprisoned as a result of the [[Public Worship Regulation Act 1874]], Pusey was quick to show his support for those who were prosecuted.

===Early controversies in the 19th century===
===="Bells and smells": the controversial ritual practices====
From the 1850s to the 1890s, several [[liturgical]] practices espoused by many ritualists led to some occasional and intense local controversies – some leading to prosecutions (most notably as a result of the [[Public Worship Regulation Act 1874]]). Those considered most important by adherents of the Catholic movement were known as the "six points":
* the use of Eucharistic [[vestments]] such as the [[chasuble]], [[Stole (vestment)|stole]], [[alb]] and [[Maniple (vestment)|maniple]]
* the use of [[Altar bell|bell]]s at the [[Elevation (Liturgy)|elevation]] of the [[Host (Holy Communion)|host]]
* the use of a [[thurible]] and [[incense]]
* the use of "lights" (especially the practice of putting six candles on the high [[altar]])
* the use of unleavened (wafer) bread in [[Eucharist|communion]]
* eastward facing celebration of the [[Eucharist]] (when the priest celebrates facing the altar from the same side as the people, i.e. the priest faces east with the people, instead of standing at the "north side" of the "table" placed in the chancel or body of the church, as required by the 1662 Book of Common Prayer)
* making the [[sign of the cross]]
* the mixing of sacramental wine with water

Other contentious practices included:
* the use of Catholic terminology such as describing the Eucharist as the "[[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]"
* the use of liturgical [[processions]]
* the decoration of churches with statues of saints, pictures of religious scenes and [[icons]]
* the veneration of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] and the practice of the invocation of the [[saints]]
* the practice of [[Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament]]
* the use of the words of Benedictus at the end of the [[Sanctus]] in the eucharistic prayer
* the use of the words of the [[Agnus Dei]] in the Eucharist

In regard to the "North Side" celebration. At the time of the Reformation, altars were fixed against the east end of the church, and the priests would celebrate the Mass standing at the front of the altar.  Beginning with the [[rubric]]s of the Second Prayer Book of [[Edward VI]] published in 1552, and through the 1662 [[Book of Common Prayer]] (which prevailed for almost 300 years), the priest is directed to stand "at the north syde of the Table."  This was variously interpreted over the years to mean the north side of the front of a fixed communion table, the north end of a fixed table (i.e., facing south), the north side of a free-standing table (presumably facing those intending to receive the Elements who would be sitting in the quire stalls opposite), or at the north  end of a free-standing table lengthwise in the chancel, facing a congregation seated in the [[nave]]. If the last option then it would copy the practice of the Early Church when the celebrant stood before a small stone or marble table, usually rectangular, facing the nave.

The ritualist movement (see [[Cambridge Camden Society]]) also played a substantial role in promoting:
* the restoration of [[chancel]]s in [[parish church]]es
* the use of robed [[choir]]s seated in the [[chancel]] accompanied by [[pipe organ]] rather than by a [[Church music|Church band]] and seated in a [[West gallery music|west gallery]] at the back of the church.

The prosecution and conviction of [[Arthur Tooth]] in 1876, [[Sidney Faithorn Green]] in 1879 and [[Richard William Enraght]] in 1880 are good illustrative examples of the kind of issues that could be involved in controversies caused by these liturgical practices. The prosecutions (which were often instigated by the [[Church Association]]) gave considerable impetus to the foundation and work of the [[English Church Union]]. The [[Society of the Holy Cross]] (SSC) played a crucial role in championing and developing the use of elements of proscribed Catholic [[ritual]] in [[Anglicanism]].

====Perception of ritualism as a threat to English identity====
For many who opposed ritualism, the key concern was to defend what they saw as the fundamentally [[Protestant]] identity of the Church of England. Nor was this just a matter of an [[ecclesiological]] argument: for many, there was a sense that [[Catholic]] worship is somehow "un-English". Catholicism was deeply associated in many minds with cultural identities which, historically, many English people had commonly treated with suspicion, especially the Spanish, the French, and the Irish.

For an ideological defence of this position, it was argued that English identity was closely tied in with England's history as a Protestant country that, after the [[English Reformation|Reformation]], had played a key role in opposing Catholic powers in Continental Europe (especially Spain and then France). In the minds of such people, Protestantism was inextricably identified with anti-[[despotic]] values and Catholicism with [[autocracy]] that, in the religious arena, hid behind the "disguise" of such things as complicated rituals whose meaning deliberately lacked transparency. The opposition to ritualism therefore had a deeply cultural and [[symbol]]ic significance that extended far beyond purely [[theological]] concerns.

Ritualists themselves were often at pains to try and present the "Englishness" of the ritual they championed by (mostly) keeping English as the language of the liturgy and reconstructing [[Anglo-Catholicism]] as a recovery of pre-Reformation Catholic forms that were specifically English: a revival of interest in the [[Sarum Rite]] (the pre-Reformation Catholic liturgy of [[Salisbury]]) was sparked off by the Ritualist movement. This tendency was also often expressed in such details as the revival in the use of the pre-Reformation [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic]] forms rather than the [[Baroque]] – the Baroque was more closely linked in the minds of many with specifically continental and [[Counter Reformation]] forms.

====Ritualism and Christian Socialism====
Although ritualism had an aesthetic and ideological appeal for many in the cultural elite, and had a cognate relationship with the [[Gothic Revival]], the idea that it was inextricably linked with an inclination towards political despotism was a misapprehension. Ritualism had an appeal for many who were politically [[conservatism|conservative]] and had supporters highly placed in the establishment (e.g. [[Charles Wood, 2nd Viscount Halifax|Viscount Halifax]] and [[John Thynne, 4th Marquess of Bath|the 4th Marquess of Bath]]). However, the outlook of many of the ritualist [[clergy]] themselves, many of whom inevitably operated in some of the most deprived communities in England, resulted in their becoming politically radicalised by the experience – some became ardent [[Christian Socialists]].

====Anti-ritualism and "muscular Christianity"====
In the spectrum of hostility that it aroused, ritualism also provoked in some of its opponents a reaction that saw its theatricality and its aestheticism as symptoms of "[[effeminacy]]".&lt;ref&gt;David Hilliard: "UnEnglish and Unmanly: Anglo-Catholicism and Homosexuality": Victorian Studies: (Winter 1982): 181–210.&lt;/ref&gt; A typical charge was that ritualistic clergy were "man milliners", more concerned with lace and brocade than doctrine. Adverse reaction to this played a significant role in the evolution of the [[Broad Church|Broad]] and [[Low Church]] enthusiasm for "[[muscular Christianity]]".

===Ritualism and outreach to the unchurched urban poor===
One of the key ideological justifications used by many of the early ritualists, apart from the fact that it was a [[symbol]]ic way of affirming their belief in the essentially [[Catholic]] nature of [[Anglicanism]], was the argument that it provided a particularly effective medium for bringing Christianity to the poorest, "[[slum]] parishes" of the [[Church of England]].

It was argued that [[ritual]] and [[aesthetic]]ally impressive [[liturgy]] did not only provide a powerful contrast to the drabness of the lives of the poor, its emphasis on [[symbol]] and action rather than word was a more effective medium for spreading Christian faith in areas with poor [[literacy]] rates than the highly cerebral and [[logocentric]] worship that was focused on the [[Book of Common Prayer]]. This argument may have had some merits, but, very often, the respect that the most successful ritualists often gained in the highly impoverished communities they went to serve was based on the fact that they had expressed a genuine [[Pastoral care|pastoral]] concern for the poor amongst whom they lived.

The argument for ritualism in [[Anglicanism]] was also based on the analogy of the success of the Roman Catholic Church amongst the highly impoverished [[Irish diaspora|Irish migrant communities]] in the urban areas of England – it was argued by some that ritual played a key role in the growth of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] amongst the poor. However, the use of ritual probably played little more than a subsidiary role in the success of the Catholic Church in this area: its success was probably largely due to a special cultural identity that many Irish migrants felt with the Roman Catholic Church as one of the few institutions that they encountered in [[Irish diaspora|diaspora]] that was also a feature of life in their homeland.

===Legacy of the controversies===
[[Image:Edward King.png|thumb|left|200px|[[Edward King (English bishop)|Edward King]], [[Bishop of Lincoln]], by [[Leslie Ward]] 1890 – King was prosecuted for ritualist practices.]]
The ritualists use of [[vestments]] and wafer bread have become widespread, even normative, in the Church of England for much of the 20th century.

Although many members of the Church of England today still feel uncomfortable or sceptical about certain 'Catholic' or 'Romish'  liturgical practices,{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} they would be astonished{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} to be told that, in the late 19th century, using [[incense]], wearing [[vestments]], putting candles on the [[altar]], the mixed cup, making the sign of the Cross over the congregation, and using unleavened (wafer) bread in the [[Eucharist]] could spark riots, put [[priest]]s in prison and even led in 1888–90 to the prosecution of a bishop – [[Edward King (English bishop)|Edward King]], [[Bishop of Lincoln]]. The lasting legacy is that the Ritualists won: the current liturgical style in its various manifestations in almost all Anglican parishes world-wide is much closer to the way Mass was celebrated 500 years ago even in Low Church and 'mid-range' parishes. What offended so many 150 years ago are the new norm and even fewer seem to care or even know about past fights.

==Synopsis==
{{see also|List of Sword Art Online characters}}

===Setting===
The light novel series spans several [[virtual reality]] worlds, beginning with the titular world of ''Sword Art Online''. Each world is built on a [[game engine]] called the World Seed, which was initially developed specifically for ''SAO'' by [[List of Sword Art Online characters#Heathcliff|Akihiko Kayaba]], but was later duplicated for ''ALO'', and later willed to Kirito, who had it leaked online with the successful intention of reviving the virtual reality industry.

===Plot===
In 2022, a virtual reality [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] (VRMMORPG) called ''Sword Art Online'' (''SAO'') is released. With the NerveGear, a helmet that stimulates the user's five senses via their brain, players can experience and control their in-game characters with their minds. Both the game and the NerveGear were created by Akihiko Kayaba.

On November 6, 10,000 players log into the ''SAO''{{'}}s mainframe cyberspace for the first time, only to discover that they are unable to log out. Kayaba appears and tells the players that they must beat all 100 floors of Aincrad, a steel castle which is the setting of ''SAO'', if they wish to be free. Those who suffer in-game deaths or forcibly remove the NerveGear out-of-game will suffer real-life deaths.

One of the players, named [[Kirito (Sword Art Online)|Kazuto "Kirito" Kirigaya]], is one of 1,000 testers in the game's previous [[closed beta]]. With the advantage of previous VR gaming experience and a drive to protect other beta testers from discrimination, he isolates himself from the greater groups and plays the game alone, bearing the mantle of "beater", a [[portmanteau]] of "beta tester" and "cheater". As the players progress through the game Kirito eventually befriends a young girl named [[Asuna (Sword Art Online)|Asuna Yuuki]], forming a relationship with and later marrying her in-game. After the duo discover the identity of Kayaba's secret ID, who was playing as the leader of the guild Asuna joined in, they confront and destroy him, freeing themselves and the other players from the game.

In the real world, Kazuto discovers that 300 ''SAO'' players, including Asuna, remain trapped in their NerveGear. As he goes to the hospital to see Asuna, he meets Shouzou Yuuki, Asuna's father, who is asked by an associate of his, Nobuyuki Sugou, to make a decision, which Sugou later reveals to be his marriage with Asuna, angering Kazuto. Several months later, he is informed by Agil, another ''SAO'' survivor, that a figure similar to Asuna was spotted on "The [[Yggdrasil|World Tree]]" in another VRMMORPG cyberspace called ''Alfheim Online'' (''ALO''). Assisted in-game by his cousin [[Leafa|Suguha "Leafa" Kirigaya]] and Yui, a navigation pixie (originally an AI from ''SAO''), he quickly learns that the trapped players in ''ALO'' are part of a plan conceived by Sugou to perform illegal experiments on their minds. The goal is to create the perfect mind-control for financial gain and to subjugate Asuna, whom he intends to marry in the real world, to assume control of her family's corporation. Kirito eventually stops the experiment and rescues the remaining 300 ''SAO'' players, foiling Sugou's plans. Before leaving ''ALO'' to see Asuna, Kayaba, who has uploaded his mind to the Internet using an experimental and destructively high-power version of NerveGear at the cost of his life, entrusts Kirito with The Seed – a [[Package (package management system)|package]] program designed to create virtual worlds. Kazuto eventually reunites with Asuna in the real world and The Seed is released onto the Internet, reviving Aincrad as other VRMMORPGs begin to thrive.

Soon after, at the prompting of a government official investigating strange occurrences in VR, Kazuto takes on a job to investigate a series of murders involving another VRMMORPG called ''Gun Gale Online'' (''GGO''), the AmuSphere (the successor of the NerveGear), and a player called Death Gun. Aided by a female player named [[Sinon (Sword Art Online)|Shino "Sinon" Asada]], he participates in a gunfight tournament called the Bullet of Bullets (BoB) and discovers the truth behind the murders, which originated with a player who participated in a player-killing guild in ''SAO''. Through his and Sinon's efforts, two suspects are captured, though the third suspect, Johnny Black, escapes.

Kazuto is later recruited to assist in testing an experimental FullDive machine, Soul Translator (STL), which has an interface that is far more realistic and complex than the previous machine he had played to help develop an artificial intelligence for the [[Ministry of Defense (Japan)|Ministry of Defense]] (MOD) named A.L.I.C.E. He tests the STL by entering a virtual reality cyberspace created with The Seed package, named UnderWorld (UW). In the UW, the flow of time proceeds a thousand times faster than in the real world, and Kirito's memories of what happens inside are restricted. However, Black injures Kazuto with [[suxamethonium chloride]]. The MOD recovers Kazuto and places him back into the STL to preserve his mind while attempts are made to save him. Meanwhile, it is revealed that UnderWorld was created as part of an experiment to create [[artificial intelligence]] that could be used for military purposes.

[[Reki Kawahara]] wrote the first volume in 2002 as a competition entry for [[ASCII Media Works]]' {{nihongo|Dengeki Game Novel Prize|電撃ゲーム小説大賞|Dengeki Game Shōsetsu Taishō|extra=now [[Dengeki Novel Prize]]}}, but refrained from submitting it as he had exceeded the page limit; he instead published it as a web novel under the pseudonym Fumio Kunori.&lt;ref name="afterword vol.1"&gt;Afterword of the first light novel volume&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, he added three further episodes and several short stories.&lt;ref&gt;Afterword of the sixth light novel volume&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wordgear novel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wordgear.x0.com/novel/|author=Fumio Kunori (Reki Kawahara)|title=web novel|work=WordGear|language=Japanese|accessdate=July 7, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EV8ijtat?url=http://wordgear.x0.com/novel/|archivedate=February 17, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, he participated in the competition again by writing ''[[Accel World]]'', this time winning the Grand Prize. Aside from ''Accel World'', he was requested to get his earlier work, ''Sword Art Online'', published by ASCII Media Works.&lt;ref name="afterword vol.1" /&gt; He agreed and withdrew his web novel versions.&lt;ref name="wordgear novel" /&gt;

For the character protagonist Kirito, Kawahara was asked if Kirito's personality and character were based on his own; he answered that he usually does not put aspects of himself into his characters,&lt;ref name="inquisitr"/&gt; and jokingly remarked: "but if I had to say there was a point of similarity between Kirito and myself, it is the fact that neither of us are good at forming [[Party (role-playing games)|parties]]. We [both] tend to play solo in these games a lot."&lt;ref name="figure"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.figure.fm/en/post/47517/Interview+with+Kawahara+Reki+Sakura+Con+2013.html |title=Interview with Kawahara Reki @ Sakura-Con 2013 |publisher=figure.fm |accessdate=August 14, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826004522/http://www.figure.fm/en/post/47517/Interview+with+Kawahara+Reki+Sakura+Con+2013.html |archivedate=August 26, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also noted that the female characters in the story were not based on anyone he knew in the real world, stating: "I don't usually make a character, setting, or anything before I start writing. As I write the story, the girls become what they are now. So, somehow, I don’t know exactly, but somehow, my subliminal idea or some hidden emotion creates the characters to be strong and capable."&lt;ref name="inquisitr"/&gt; He added that he wrote the series to demonstrate that he views online gaming not as a social ill or escape from real life, but rather decided to show games in a more positive light in his light novels.&lt;ref name="inquisitr"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inquisitr.com/2055209/sword-art-online-season-3-and-2-kawahara-reki-talks-sao-accel-world-anime-and-future-plans/ |author=Frye, Patrick |title='Sword Art Online' Season 2 and 3: Kawahara Reki talks SAO, 'Accel World', anime, and future plans |publisher=Inquisitr|accessdate=August 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that "the character of Asuna I might have created a little too perfectly for ''Sword Art Online''".&lt;ref name="figure"/&gt;

Richard Eisenbeis of [[Kotaku]] hails ''Sword Art Online'' as the smartest series in recent years, praising its deep insight on the psychological aspects of [[virtual reality]] on the human psyche, its sociological views on creating a realistic economy and society in a [[massively multiplayer online game]] setting, and the writing staff's ability to juggle a wide variety of genres within the series.&lt;ref name="Eisenbeis1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/sword-art-online-is-the-smartest-anime-i-ve-seen-in-yea-5947171|title=''Sword Art Online'' Is the Smartest Anime I’ve Seen in Years (And It’s Only Half-Done)|publisher=Kotaku|date=September 28, 2012|accessdate=October 1, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406060444/http://kotaku.com/sword-art-online-is-the-smartest-anime-i-ve-seen-in-yea-5947171|archivedate=April 6, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenbeis particularly noted how the romance between Kirito and Asuna is explored bringing "definition to exactly what love is like in a virtual world."&lt;ref name="Eisenbeis1" /&gt; However, at the time of this preliminary review, he had only watched the first 12 episodes of the series.&lt;ref name="Eisenbeis1" /&gt; He has since gone on to review the second half of the series, lauding its excellent use of plot twists and praising its well written and believable villain. However, he felt that some of the initial positive aspects of the series were lost in the second half, such as the focus on psychological repercussions and social interactions that could be realistically seen in an online game. Criticism was also levied on the aspect of turning Asuna into a damsel in distress, stating that a female lead as strong as her was "reduced to nothing but the quest item the male lead is hunting for." Eisenbeis closes his review of the series by stating in regards to the two halves, "Both, however, are enjoyable for what they are."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/sword-art-onlines-second-half-isnt-quite-as-brilliant-5971194|title=''Sword Art Online''{{'}}s Second Half Isn't Quite as Brilliant as Its First|publisher=Kotaku|date=December 26, 2012|accessdate=September 28, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926162313/http://kotaku.com/sword-art-onlines-second-half-isnt-quite-as-brilliant-5971194|archivedate=September 26, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''sympathetic character''' is a fictional [[character (arts)|character]] in a [[Narrative|story]] whom the writer expects the reader to identify with and care about,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; if not necessarily admire. [[Protagonists]], almost by definition, fit into the category of a sympathetic character; so, however, do many [[supporting character]]s and even [[villain]]s.

'''Teacher quality''' is said to be the most important factor influencing learner outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://research.pearson.com/articles/learning-from-thebest.html |title=How the world's best performing school systems come out on top |publisher=Research.pearson.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Education for All]] Goals set by [[UNESCO]] have been achieved by some countries but many millions of children remain out of school or with poor teachers.

According to [[UNESCO]] and the OECD,&lt;ref name="talis1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talis.org.uk/about/index.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815103421/http://talis.org.uk/about/index.aspx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-08-15 |title=Teaching and Learning International Survey |publisher=TALIS |date= |accessdate=2015-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; developed and developing countries across the world are grappling unsuccessfully with the problem of providing up to date [[teacher education]] both [[Initial Professional Development]] and [[continuing professional development]] to a diverse and large workforce (450,000 in England,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/number-of-schools-teachers-and-students-in-england |title=Number of schools, teachers and students in England - Publications |publisher=GOV.UK |date=2014-01-10 |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1.3M in Pakistan in 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesco.org.pk/education/teachereducation/statistics.html |title=Teacher Education in Pakistan |publisher=Unesco.org.pk |date= |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Teacher training==
Teachers have varied backgrounds making the targeting of professional development programmes difficult. Some may have little or no [[teacher training]], others may have [[doctorates]] in specialist subjects but no training in [[pedagogy]] – the science of teaching and learning. In other cases, teachers may be much more deeply knowledgeable having studied for their qualifications over four or more years. As well as varied backgrounds, teachers often work in remote areas.
[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD research across 20 countries (2009) &lt;ref name="talis1"/&gt; confirms that improving the quality of teachers’ knowledge (see [[Lee Shulman]]’s definition) is the intervention most likely to bring about improvements in learning and educational outcomes.

==A call for knowledge management for the worldwide education sector==
To address this problem, the OECD calls for the: “creation of ‘knowledge-rich’, evidence-based education systems…in many countries, education is still far from being a knowledge industry in the sense that its own practices are not yet being transformed by knowledge about the efficacy of those practices.” (OECD, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;3)

==[[Translational Research]] and examples from the medical sector==
By way of contrast, the medical sector has established structures and processes worldwide addressing knowledge mobilisation. 
The concept of [[Translational Research]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/funding/Innovations/wtd027704.htm |title=What is translational research? &amp;#124; Wellcome Trust |publisher=Wellcome.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. how research findings might apply in practice is much more developed in medicine than in the education sector.

==Systematic reviews and rapid evidence assessments==
[[Systematic reviews]] and rapid evidence assessment &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/networks/gsr/resources-and-guidance/rapid-evidence-assessment/what-is |title=What is a Rapid Evidence Assessment? |publisher=Civil Service |date= |accessdate=2015-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710110806/http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/networks/gsr/resources-and-guidance/rapid-evidence-assessment/what-is |archivedate=2015-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; methodology are also well developed and engage tens of thousands of medical practitioners worldwide via the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] and the associated [[Cochrane Library]]. The [[Campbell Collaboration]] is the educational equivalent.

==Clinical Pathway approach==
The [[Clinical Pathway]] approach which appears well established in medicine as demonstrated by the Map of Medicine HealthGuides and [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] (NICE) pathways&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pathways.nice.org.uk/ |title=NICE Pathways |publisher=Pathways.nice.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; is embryonic in education with the MESHGuides&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MESHGuides.org |title=MESH Homepage |publisher=MESHGuides.org |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; initiative.
The medical sector sets a standard for knowledge sharing that the education sector could aspire to.

==Access to knowledge for teachers in remote areas==
The above examples from the medical sector use [[information technology]] to connect up experts across the world for the benefit of all. With respect to teachers having access to online resources, even those in areas with no electricity or internet can access the latest online knowledge with a simple set up using a compujector&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://astralab.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=25&amp;Itemid=42 |title=The AstraLab Compujector - AstraLab Compujector |publisher=Astralab.co.za |date= |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and generator backed up by central support uploading materials to the hard disk in the compujector.

The challenge is how to ensure knowledge about effective teaching in every subject, for every concept, for every type of learner is available to teachers at the time they need it.

==Teacher attrition==
Teacher attrition rates are high in some locations e.g. 40% in the UK in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Donald |last=Boyd |first2=Pam |last2=Grossman |first3=Hamilton |last3=Lankford |first4=Susanna |last4=Loeb |first5=James |last5=Wyckoff |display-authors=1 |title=Who Leaves? Teacher Attrition and Student Achievement |work=NBER Working Paper No. 14022 |date=May 2008 |doi=10.3386/w14022 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=May 2018}} In the UK, it was reported in 2015 that 40% of teachers leave in their first year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harding |first=Eleanor |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3020580/More-40-new-teachers-leave-profession-12-months-Excessive-workload-blamed-number-quit-triples-six-years.html |title=40% of teachers quit within 12 months due to excessive workload &amp;#124; Daily Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2015-03-31 |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=why+do+teachers+leave&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=-fOcVZzdDYi07Qb4moLYBw] {{dead link|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Lack of professional development is cited by teachers leaving the profession as a major contributing factor. As the OECD suggests, more efficient [[knowledge management]] is suggested as a way to reduce losses to national economies due to pupil underperformance, teacher attrition and lack of continuing professional development to keep teachers up to date.

"'''The Flea'''" is an [[eroticism|erotic]] [[metaphysical poem]] (first published posthumously in 1633) by [[John Donne]] (1572–1631). The exact date of its composition is unknown. The poem uses the [[conceit]] of a [[flea]], which has sucked blood from the male speaker and his female lover, to serve as an extended [[metaphor]] for the relationship between them. The speaker tries to convince a lady to sleep with him, arguing that if their blood mingling in the flea is innocent, then sexual mingling would also be innocent. His argument hinges on the belief that bodily fluids mix during sexual intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Broadview Anthology of British Literature, Volume 2 |isbn=978-1-55111-610-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Content==
The poem evokes the aphorism ''[[carpe diem]]'', which is Latin for "seize the day". Donne encourages the lady to focus on the present day and time versus saving herself for the afterlife. Donne is able to hint at the erotic without explicitly referring to sex, using images such as the flea that "pamper'd swells" with the blood of the lady (line 8). This evokes the idea of an [[erection]]. The speaker complains that "This is more than we would do!" (line 9) The speaker claims it would be "sacrilege" to kill the flea. He holds the flea up in the second stanza as "our marriage bed" and "our marriage temple," begging for the lady to spare its innocent life (line 13). He argues that by killing the flea, she would be killing herself, himself, and the flea itself, "Three crimes in killing three" (line 18). The lady, in the third stanza, kills the flea, presumably rejecting the speaker's advances. He then claims she will lose no more honor when she decides to sleep with him than she did when she killed the flea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Abrams, M.H. |title=The Norton Anthology of English Literature| edition=6th |publisher=W.W.

{{italic title}}
'''''The Fountain of Life''''' or '''''The Fountain of Grace and the Triumph of the Church over the Synagogue''''' are names given to an oil on [[panel painting]] completed c 1432. For most of its history the painting has been in Spain, where it is currently features in a special exhibition in the [[Museo del Prado]], Madrid.&lt;ref name="Eldiario"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.eldiario.es/cultura/fuente-Van-Eyck-recupera-Prado_0_827667671.html |title='La fuente de gracia' de Van Eyck recupera la gloria |date=2018 |access-date=11 November 2018 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stylistically and thematically, the painting is related to the work of [[Jan van Eyck]], but it is unsigned and there have been competing theories as to whether it is by van Eyck himself.

The subject matter of the painting would have been of particular interest in 15th century Spain which had the world´s largest [[History of the Jews in Spain|Jewish community]].
There has been recent speculation that it was painted by van Eyck himself, possibly while he was on a diplomatic mission to the Iberian peninsula. However, technical analysis suggests that it was painted in the Netherlands, albeit possibly in response to a commission from Spain, in van Eyck's workshop.&lt;ref name="Eldiario" /&gt; 

''The Fountain of Life'' closely resembles passages in the 1432 ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'' by Jan and his brother [[Hubert van Eyck|Hubert]].&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos et al, 58&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is consensus among specialists that it is the product of a workshop, some attribute ''The Fountain of Life'' to a youthful Jan, his brother Hubert,&lt;ref&gt;Borchert, 71&lt;/ref&gt; or much later, and less likely, [[Petrus Christus]].&lt;ref name="F132"&gt;Ferrari, 132&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is structured into three levels. The top terrace shows a [[Deesis|Deësis]] of [[God the Son]], the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] and St. [[John the Evangelist]]. The middle section shows four groups of angels, while the lower level has two groups of holy men; with Christians led by a Pope and princes to the right, and Jews led by blindfolded high priests to the left. These two groups represent true believers and non true believers in Christ as the messiah respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Devonshire Jones et al, 213&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[Fountain of Life]] is a symbol referring to baptism and or eucharist. The water that flows from the top to the lower terrace, is intended as a symbol of "the Grace that illuminates the Triumphant Church and blinds the Synagogue".&lt;ref name="prado"&gt;''[https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/online-gallery/on-line-gallery/obra/the-fountain-of-grace-and-the-triumph-of-the-church-over-the-synagogue/ The Fountain of Grace and the Triumph of the Church over the Synagogue]''. [[Museo del Prado]]. Retrieved 22 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The painting is organised into three horizontal levels or planes, each showing a terrace on which the figures are positioned.&lt;ref name="prado" /&gt;

===Upper terrace===
{{multiple image

 | image3    = Retable de l'Agneau mystique (4).jpg
 | width3    = 100
 | caption3  = ''Ghent Altarpiece'': John the Baptist
}}
The top level shows a Deësis scene, with [[God the Father]] in the center, flanked by the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] and St. [[John the Evangelist]]. This passage closely resembles a similar scene in the ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]''.&lt;ref name="F132" /&gt; All three figures are seated in front of hanging [[Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting|oriental style carpets]].

[[File:The Fountain of Life after van Eyck Detail3.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Detail showing the Virgin Mary]]
God holds a staff in his right hand, and holds up his left up in the act of blessing. He is enthroned within a tall, elaborate Gothic architectural setting. His throne contains symbols of the [[Four Evangelists|Evangelists]], while the [[baldachin]] around and above him is decorated with illusionistic painted [[relief]]s of [[Old Testament]] prophets intended to look like sculptures. The lamb sits on a pedestal before God, on a structure through which the water of grace,&lt;ref name="c61"&gt;Colas, 61&lt;/ref&gt; symbolising the rite of baptism, flows before reaching the [[fountain of life]] in the lowest terrace.&lt;ref name="r56"&gt;Roth, 56&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary is seated and reading a red book, probably a [[book of hours]]. She wears a blue gown, the folds and cloth of which are closely detailed. She has blond hair which is unbranded and falls over her shoulders. In contrast to her depiction in the ''Ghent Altarpiece'', here her dress is plain, lacks any embroidery or gilded lining, while her book is not [[Girdle book|girdled]]. John is dressed in a green robe, also has blond hair and sits writing in a holy book.

===Middle terrace===
[[File:The Fountain of Life after van Eyck 9.jpg|thumb|260px|Detail showing musical angels]]
[[File:Jan van Eyck - The Ghent Altarpiece - Singing Angels (detail) - WGA07642.jpg|thumb|250px|Detail from the "Musical Angels" panel of the ''Ghent Altarpiece'', before 1432]]
The middle level shows two groups of musical angels dressed in white robes and sitting on grass. Choirs of singing angels are positioned in towers on either side of them. This section is again similar to a panel in the ''Ghent Altarpiece''. The instruments include a [[harp]], a type of [[viol]] and a [[lute]].

===Lower terrace===
The lower section represents the triumph of the Church over the Jewish Synagogue, through the depiction of the Christians as collect as almost serene, and the Jews as chaotic, blinded and resistant. The fountain of life is positioned in the center, with a group of Christians to its left, including a Pope (possibly [[Pope Martin V|Martin V]]), members of his [[retinue|service]],&lt;ref name="r56" /&gt; an emperor and various princes.&lt;ref name="c61" /&gt;

[[File:The Fountain of Life after van Eyck 8.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Detail showing the blinded High Priest in the lower terrace]]
To the right is a grouping of "despairing Jews" who seem to be fleeing from the scene.&lt;ref name="prado" /&gt; The figure on the far left of this group is a high priest who has been blindfolded,&lt;ref name="F132" /&gt; symbolising his blinding to the true significance of Jesus.&lt;ref name="b163"&gt;Benjamin, 163&lt;/ref&gt; A rabbi in the immediate foreground holds a [[Torah]] scroll with, according to historian Norman Roth, "gibberish Hebrew writing", while another "Jew shows a scroll to a figure, apparently Christian, who tears his clothing at the sight". In contrast to the Christians, the Jews do not wear grand, ceremonious hats or badges.&lt;ref name="r56" /&gt;

They carry a variety of [[banner]]s, [[scroll]]s and [[parchment]]s, which contains texts that while illegible, can be recognised as mostly written in Hebrew, with some lettering that is almost nonsensical. The texts are arranged across the passage in a haphazard way, reflecting the disorder of the figures, and more generally within the Synagogue.&lt;ref name="b162"&gt;Benjamin, 162&lt;/ref&gt; This placement must be contrasted with those on the two level, where the books held by Mary and John rest stably on their laps.&lt;ref name="b163" /&gt;

==Provenance==
The painting's first documentary record is in the ''Libro becerro'' (vellum acquisitions register) of the [[Monastery of Santa María del Parral|Monastery of the Parral]] outside Segovia, which recorded it as the gift of King [[Henry IV of Castile]] in 1454. That year marked the beginning of Henry's reign, as well as a building programme at the monastery. He may have inherited the painting from his father [[John II of Castile|John II]].

It was secured to the wall of the [[Sacristy|vestry]], being gradually painted into the wall as the vestry was redecorated down the centuries, until it was removed in 1838 as part of the [[Ecclesiastical confiscations of Mendizábal|secularisation of the monasteries]]: parts of the border were lost in the removal but the painting is generally in good condition. The painting was moved to the Trinidade monastery opposite the Atocha station in Madrid, used as a general store for the religious wealth collected.

The painting was photographed in 1859 by [[Jean Laurent (photographer)|Jean Laurent]].&lt;ref name="Eldiario" /&gt; Its first formal attribution was in 1870 when it was transferred to the Prado, dating it as 1454 on the strength of the entry: however, it was stylistically anachronistic, an accurate dating should have read "before 1454", a mistake which has caused no end of confusion in the 130 years following as scholars attempted to identify a non-existent atelier or pupil/follower of van Eyck's. Following a dendrochronological study undertaken by the Prado in the late 1990s, which dated the felling of the wood to 1418, it was dated to "after 1428" after allowing a standard ten years for seasoning: the Prado currently attributes it to c1432. During the time in the Parral, it became highly influential and was widely copied, one copy was later housed in [[Palencia Cathedral]]. Today it is in the collection of the [[Museo del Prado]], Madrid.&lt;ref name="prado" /&gt; The Prado version was the star of an exhibition of its reassessments in 2003, and it was previously the subject of the 1957 Utrecht doctoral thesis of Josua Bruyn, who went on to become Professor of the History of Art at Amsterdam and establish the Rembrandt Foundation.

'''''The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show''''', sometimes called '''''The Burns and Allen Show''''', is a half-hour television series broadcast from 1950 to 1958 on [[CBS]]. It stars [[George Burns]] and [[Gracie Allen]], one of the most enduring acts in entertainment history. [[Burns and Allen]] were headliners in [[vaudeville]] in the 1920s, and radio stars in the 1930s and 1940s. Their situation comedy TV series received [[Emmy Award]] nominations throughout its eight-year run.

==Production==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2015}}
A  half-hour TV series broadcast October 12, 1950&amp;nbsp;– September 22, 1958, on [[CBS]], ''The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show'' was initially staged live and broadcast every other Thursday at 8 pm ET. In fall 1952, it became a weekly series filmed on the West Coast. From March 1953 through September 1958, ''The Burns and Allen Show'' aired Mondays at 8 pm ET.&lt;ref name="Brooks"&gt;Brooks, Tim, and Earle Marsh, ''[[The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows 1946–Present|The Directory to Prime Time Network TV Shows 1946–Present]]''. New York: Ballantine Books, 1988 (fourth edition); {{ISBN|0-345-35610-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|280–281}}

The show was an immediate success.&lt;ref name="NYT GA obit"&gt;"Gracie Allen Dead; Comedianne Was 58". ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 29, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; Six episodes were produced live from the [[Brooks Atkinson Theatre|Mansfield Theatre]] in New York, with the stage set as the Burns's living room. The show relocated to the [[CBS Columbia Square]] facilities in Hollywood beginning with the seventh episode.&lt;ref name="Irvin"&gt;Irvin, Richard, ''George Burns Television Productions: The Series and Pilots, 1950–1981''. [[Jefferson, North Carolina]]: [[McFarland &amp; Company|McFarland &amp; Company Inc., Publishers]], 2014. {{ISBN|9780786494866}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|20–21}}

Ever the businessman, Burns realized it would be more efficient to do the series on film; the half-hour episodes could then be syndicated. From that point on, the show was filmed at General Service Studios without a live audience present; however, each installment was screened before an audience to provide live responses prior to the episodes being broadcast. With 291 episodes, the show had a long network run through 1958 and continued in syndicated reruns for years.

The sets were designed to look like the couple's real-life residence. An establishing shot of the actual house on Maple Drive in [[Beverly Hills, California]], was often used. Although extensively remodeled, that house still exists today—including the study over the garage where George would "escape" from Gracie's illogical logic. Burns lived in the house until his death in 1996, at the age of 100.

One [[running gag]] of the TV show involved a closet full of hats belonging to various visitors to the Burns household, who would slip out the door unnoticed and leave their hats behind rather than face another round with Gracie. The format had George watching all the action (standing outside the [[proscenium]] arch in early live episodes; watching the show on TV in his study towards the end of the series) and breaking the [[4th wall|fourth wall]] by commenting upon it to the viewers. Another running gag was George's weekly "firing" of announcer [[Harry Von Zell]] after he turned up aiding, abetting, or otherwise not stopping the mayhem prompted by Gracie's illogical logic.

[[File:Burns and Allen 1953.JPG|left|thumb|300px|Burns and Allen in 1953]]

During the course of the eight-year run, the TV show had remarkable consistency in its cast and crew.  The episodes were produced and directed by [[Ralph Levy]] (1950–53); [[Fred DeCordova|Frederick de Cordova]], later director of NBC's ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' (1953–56); and [[Rod Amateau]] (1956–58). The original writing staff consisted of Sid Dorfman, Harvey Helm, [[Paul Henning]], and William Burns (George's brother). Later writers included Nate Monaster, Jesse Goldstein, Norman Paul, and Keith Fowler. The associate producer was Al Simon, the director of photography was [[Philip Tannura]], A.S.C., and the editor was Larry Heath. The show's primary sponsor was [[Carnation Evaporated Milk]], later alternating with [[B.F. Goodrich Company|B.F. Goodrich]] (1952–55, 1956–57), and [[General Mills]], for [[Betty Crocker]] (1955–56, 1957–58).

[[Bea Benaderet]] carried over from the ''[[Burns and Allen]]'' radio show, portraying neighbor Blanche Morton, but over the course of the series, four different actors played her husband. The character's first name was "Harry", the same first name as the real-life announcer [[Harry Von Zell]], requiring the writers to craft dialogue that would distinguish the two characters' names. Blanche's husband Harry Morton was first portrayed by [[Hal March]] (October–December 1950), then [[John Brown (actor)|John Brown]] (January–June 1951), and after that, [[Fred Clark]], until 1953 and Larry Keating until 1958. In one episode, "Morton Buys Iron Deer/Gracie Thinks George Needs Glasses", George walks on-stage and freezes the scene just before Harry's entrance and explains that Clark has left the show to perform on [[Broadway show|Broadway]]. He introduces [[Larry Keating]], who enters, and then calls over Bea Benaderet to introduce the two saying, "This is Larry Keating and he is going to be your husband now". The pair greet and chat briefly, complimenting each other on their previous work. George remarks that if they are going to be so nice to each other, no one will believe they are married. Burns then gives a cue, Blanche resumes her position, and the scene continues where it stopped as if nothing had happened. The new Harry enters and Blanche hits him in the head with a catalog for spending $200 to buy an iron deer.

Also appearing in the TV series were Burns and Allen's two children. [[Ronnie Burns (actor)|Ronnie]], adopted in 1935, and Sandra, adopted the year before,&lt;ref&gt;"Burns and Allen Adopt Boy". ''The New York Times'', September 28, 1935.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Life"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a1MEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA87&amp;lpg=PA87&amp;dq=Life+magazine+Gracie+Ends+Act+with+George&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fHFosZcTLQ&amp;sig=D9T8CuTQt_zDADJ0YUpxfX7fIIM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=59ZgVKLABoepyQTM9IKYDw&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Life%20magazine%20Gracie%20Ends%20Act%20with%20George&amp;f=false|title=Gracie Ends Act with George|publisher=''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]''|date=September 22, 1958|pages=88–93|accessdate=2014-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; first appeared in the third-season episode, "Uncle Clyde Comes to Visit" (January 1, 1953), playing themselves. The teenagers are in the Burns living room, threading a [[16&amp;nbsp;mm film|16&amp;nbsp;mm]] projector with that night's episode. In voiceover, George introduces them, and tells the audience that they have been away at school and that is why we have not met them before. Ronnie made a guest appearance on the episode, "Gracie Gives Wedding in Payment of a Favor" (October 18, 1954), playing a character named Jim Goodwin, and was introduced to the audience at the episode's conclusion. Ronnie joined the regular cast October 10, 1955,&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Val, "News of Television", ''The New York Times'', September 25, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; playing himself, but cast as a young drama student who tended to look askance at his parents' comedy style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0122863|title=Ronnie Burns profile|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=2014-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their daughter, Sandra, declined becoming a regular member of the cast, although she appeared in a few episodes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1567506|title=Sandra Burns profile|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=2014-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a classmate of Ronnie. In one episode, Ronnie's drama class puts on a vaudeville show to raise funds for the school. Gracie hosts the show while Ronnie and Sandy deliver an impersonation of their famous parents along with one of their classic routines. Since Ronnie played himself, Gracie closed the segment with a wisecrack: "The boy was produced by Burns and Allen."

Starting in the fall of 1955, Burns and Allen often reappeared after the end of the episode, before a curtain decorated with the names and locations of the various theaters where they headlined in their vaudeville days. They would perform one of their signature "double routines", often discussing one of Gracie's fictional relatives (including "Death Valley Allen" the prospector, "Florence Allen" the nurse, "Casey Allen" the railroad man). Burns always ended the show with, "Say goodnight, Gracie", to which Allen simply replied, "Goodnight." She never said, "Goodnight, Gracie", as legend has it. Burns was once asked this question and said it would have been a funny line. Asked why he did not do it, Burns replied, "Incredibly enough, no one ever thought of it."{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

In March 1953, ''The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show'' joined ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' as part of the CBS Monday-night [[primetime]] lineup. As a result, the show entered the top 30 television programs in the [[Nielsen ratings]] ranking at number 20. For the 1954–1955 season, it ranked number 26, and for both the 1955–56 and 1956–57 seasons it was number 28.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

With ''I Love Lucy'' ending its six-year run on CBS in the spring of 1957, the television network wanted to renew the Burns and Allen series, but by this time, Allen had grown tired of performing. Nevertheless, Burns committed both of them for another year, which would be their eighth—and last—on television.&lt;ref name="Gracie Love Story"/&gt;{{Rp|274}}

Allen announced her retirement on February 17, 1958, to be effective at the end of the current season.&lt;ref name="Gracie Love Story"&gt;[[George Burns|Burns, George]], ''Gracie: A Love Story''. New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1988. {{ISBN|0399133844}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|275}}

[[File:Gbgallen.jpg|right|thumb|300px|"It really was her last scene, the last time she appeared on a stage", Burns wrote of the episode filmed June 4, 1958.&lt;ref name="Gracie Love Story"/&gt;{{Rp|279}}]]

Burns and Allen filmed their last show on June 4, 1958.&lt;ref name="LAT GB obit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-03-10/news/mn-45422_1_george-burns |title=George Burns, Comedy's Elder Statesman, Dies |publisher=Oliver, Myrna, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', March 10, 1996 |accessdate=2014-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|3}} The filming was an emotional experience, although nothing was said about it being Allen's last performance. At the wrap party, Allen took a token sip of champagne from a paper cup, hugged her friend and co-star Bea Benaderet, and said "Okay, that's it." After a brief last look around the set, she said, "And thank you very much, everyone."&lt;ref name="Gracie Love Story"/&gt;{{Rp|279–280}}

"She deserved a rest," Burns said when Allen devoted herself to gardening and being a housewife:&lt;blockquote&gt;She had been working all her life, and her lines were the toughest in the world to do. They didn't make sense, so she had to memorize every word. It took a real actress. Every spare moment—in bed, under the hair dryer—had to be spent in learning lines. Do you wonder that she's happy to be rid of it?&lt;ref name="NYT GA obit"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Burns attempted to continue the show with the same supporting cast but without Allen. ''[[The George Burns Show]]'' lasted one season (October 21, 1958&amp;nbsp;– April 14, 1959) on [[NBC]].&lt;ref name="Brooks"/&gt;{{Rp|281}}

Following a mild heart attack in the 1950s,&lt;ref name="Gracie Love Story"/&gt;{{Rp|21}} Allen suffered a series of angina episodes over a number of years.&lt;ref name="Gracie Love Story"/&gt;{{Rp|284, 307}} She had a major heart attack in 1961.&lt;ref name="Gracie Love Story"/&gt;{{Rp|289, 310}} She lived a slower but comfortable retirement for another three years, often appearing in public with her husband, but never performing. Gracie Allen died August 27, 1964,&lt;ref name="NYT GA obit"/&gt; as Burns was underway with his short-lived [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom, ''[[Wendy and Me]]'', with [[Connie Stevens]] and a cast including [[Ron Harper (actor)|Ron Harper]], [[James T. Callahan]], and [[J. Pat O'Malley]]. All the TV shows were produced under the banner of McCadden Productions, a company run by George Burns which he named after the street on which his brother William lived.&lt;ref name="Gracie Love Story"/&gt;{{Rp|293}} McCadden also produced the iconic TV show, ''[[Mister Ed]]''.&lt;ref name="Gracie Love Story"/&gt;{{Rp|294}} The McCadden catalog is owned by [[Sony Pictures Television]].

&lt;!-- Please use American English. While it is true that the opening credits of the third series have the cast names in that order, "series" is not the term used in the U.S., "season" is. This is done because this is an American show. From what I have seen, precedent says American English should be used for U.S. shows, American for USA-originated ones, and so on.

==Premise==
[[File:The Goldbergs 2013 logo.jpg|thumb|left|Promotional poster used for the series' first season]]
''The Goldbergs'' is set in the 1980s in [[Jenkintown, Pennsylvania]]. The show is loosely based on the showrunner's childhood, during which he videotaped events, many of which are reenacted throughout the program. It shows the reality of the 1980s through a young boy's eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/the_ticket/item/meet_the_goldbergs_adam_goldberg_mines_his_familys_mishegoss_for_new_sitcom|title=Meet ‘The Goldbergs’: Adam Goldberg mines his family’s mishegoss for new sitcom|last=Pfefferman|first=Naomi|work=Jewish Journal|publisher=TRIBE Media Corp|date=September 6, 2013|accessdate=May 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series stars [[Jeff Garlin]] as patriarch Murray and [[Wendi McLendon-Covey]] as matriarch Beverly. Their two older children are Erica ([[Hayley Orrantia]]) and Barry ([[Troy Gentile]]). The youngest child, Adam ([[Sean Giambrone]]), documents his family life with his video camera. Beverly's father, Albert "Pops" Solomon ([[George Segal]]), is frequently around to provide advice or to help out his grandchildren (often behind his daughter's back).

The present-day "Adult Adam" ([[Patton Oswalt]]) narrates every episode as taking place in "1980-something".

Many references to real-life Philadelphia-area businesses are made, including the [[Wawa Inc.]] convenience store chain, [[Gimbel's]] department store, [[Willow Grove Park Mall]], and Kremp's Florist of [[Willow Grove, Pennsylvania]].

===Main cast===
* [[Wendi McLendon-Covey]] as Beverly Goldberg (née Solomon),&lt;ref name="thefutoncritic"/&gt; the overprotective matriarch of the Goldbergs. She is often called their "smother" by the kids. She frequently injects herself into her children's lives, often to their embarrassment, and is supremely confident in their abilities.
* [[Sean Giambrone]] as [[Adam F. Goldberg|Adam Fredrick Goldberg]],&lt;ref name="thefutoncritic"/&gt; the pop-culture obsessed youngest child of the Goldbergs. Smart and geeky, he often films his family's activities on a VHS camcorder. He often ends up having to use his middle initial to distinguish himself from another Adam Goldberg who attends the same school and is also an aspiring filmmaker.
** [[Patton Oswalt]] voices the adult Adam Goldberg,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lowry|first=Brian|title=TV Review: ''The Goldbergs''|url=https://variety.com/2013/tv/reviews/the-goldbergs-TV-review-1200613772/|work=Variety|date=September 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; who narrates the show from the present day.
* [[Jeff Garlin]] as Murray Goldberg,&lt;ref name="thefutoncritic"/&gt; the gruff, somewhat asocial patriarch of the Goldbergs. Unlike Beverly, he is realistic about his children's abilities and believes she smothers them too much. Despite his apathetic tendencies at home, he values hard work and has held various full time positions since his teenage years. Though he does not always show affection for his children, calling them morons when they make mistakes or behave in silly ways, he truly cares about them and wants them to learn how to fend for themselves. He runs his father-in-law's furniture business, loves sports, and is often seen lounging in front of his TV in his  white [[briefs]].
* [[Troy Gentile]] as Barry Norman Goldberg,&lt;ref name="thefutoncritic"/&gt; the overconfident, slightly dim-witted middle child of the Goldbergs. Though seemingly untalented in every way (except in ice hockey and wrestling, at which he excels), he remains highly self-assured while trying to become popular in high school. He is determined to dominate everything he does, including sports; loves rap music; and is the leader of a crew called the Jenkintown Posse (abbreviated JTP, which fellow members repeat whenever the initials are spoken). In the fifth season finale, he proposes to Lainey and she accepts. By this point, he has also graduated.
* [[Hayley Orrantia]] as Erica Dorothy Goldberg,&lt;ref name="thefutoncritic"/&gt; the somewhat bad-tempered oldest child of the Goldbergs. Smart and musically gifted but rebellious, she is popular in school and dominant over her younger brothers. In the fifth season, Erica left for college at [[Duke Ellington School of the Arts|DC. School of the Arts]] only to drop out at the end of the season to start a band with Lainey and Valley Erica. "Erica" is based on Adam's real-life brother, Eric Goldberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Wojciechowski |first=Michelle "Wojo" |date=May 17, 2016 |title=The Goldbergs Creator Adam F. Goldberg on Sharing His Family with the World |url=https://parade.com/477786/michelewojciechowski/the-goldbergs-creator-adam-f-goldberg-on-sharing-his-family-with-the-world/ |magazine=[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]] |access-date=April 18, 2018 |quote=He also made one other change—since it wasn’t supposed to be his family, he changed his oldest brother, Eric, to a girl, Erica.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[George Segal]] as Albert "Pops" Solomon,&lt;ref name="thefutoncritic"/&gt; Beverly's laid-back widower father. Though an elderly man with a number of comic eccentricities, he acts much younger than his age and often gives sage advice to his grandchildren. Adam considers him his best friend. He once owned a successful furniture store called Ottoman Empire that allowed him to retire comfortably, and he now lets his son-in-law Murray run the business.
* [[AJ Michalka]] as Lainey Lewis (Season 3–4; recurring 1–2, 5–present),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Goldbergs - Season 5 - AJ Michalka Not Returning as Series Regular|url=http://www.spoilertv.com/2017/08/the-goldbergs-season-5-aj-michalka-not.html|website=SpoilerTV|publisher=SpoilerTV|accessdate=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erica's best friend and one of the most popular girls at school, whom Barry has had a lifelong crush on. To the surprise of many, Lainey kisses Barry at a party in the first-season finale, the two slowly grow closer together in season two, and eventually become an unlikely couple. Following the fourth season, she has gone to attend fashion school in Savannah, Georgia and ended her relationship with Barry. In season 5, she returns to Jenkintown after dropping out along with Erica to start a band. In the final seconds of the season finale she and Barry agree to wed.
* [[Sam Lerner]] as 'Madman' Geoff Schwartz (Season 5–present; recurring 2–4),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Goldbergs - Season 5 - Sam Lerner promoted to regular|url=http://www.spoilertv.com/2017/08/the-goldbergs-season-5-sam-lerner.html|website=Spoiler TV|publisher=Spoiler TV|accessdate=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of Barry's best friends. The nickname "Madman" is a form of ironic humor, given how well-behaved the character is, especially compared to Barry. He is infatuated with Erica and makes many futile attempts to win her affections. At the end of the third season, he begins dating Evelyn Silver just as Erica realizes she reciprocates Geoff's feelings. He later breaks up with Evey to be with Erica.
*Alison Rich as Erica "Valley Erica" Coolidge, Erica's [[Valley girl]] roommate at college; the two have the same first name, but decidedly different personalities. She dropped out of college with Erica and Lainey, and currently lives with the Goldbergs. (season 6; recurring 5)

===Recurring cast===

The season 3 premiere confirms she is now living in Seattle. Adam and Dana continue a long-distance relationship, but it ends when the two realize how different they have become. "Dana"'s real-life name is Amanda Caldwell; it was changed due to early legal concerns about the show's autobiographical quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Goldberg |first=Lesley |date=April 22, 2014 |title='The Goldbergs' Boss Talks Time Slots, Plans for John Hughes, New Kids Tributes, More |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/goldbergs-boss-talks-time-slots-697442 |magazine=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |access-date= |quote=In the beginning, there were a lot of legal concerns about using real people. So Dana Caldwell is really Amanda Caldwell. Everyone had had concerns that it was so autobiographical. I changed her name, and then she Facebooked me and was happy and excited. That's my biggest regret: That I didn't use the real person's name.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (season 1-3; guest season 4)

* [[Cooper Roth]] (season 1) and Zayne Emory (season 2-3) as [[J. C. Spink]], a bully who torments Adam. The original film producer who inspired the character portrays a school bus driver.

==Spin-off==
{{Main|Schooled (TV series)}}
In November 2016, it was first reported that ABC was developing a spin-off that would centre around recurring character Rick Mellor, played by Bryan Callen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2016/11/08/development-update-tuesday-november-8-686012/11918/|title=Breaking News - Development Update: Tuesday, November 8 - TheFutonCritic.com|website=www.thefutoncritic.com|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 10, 2017, Wendi McClendon-Covey's character was reported as appearing in the script in a guest appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2017/01/10/development-update-tuesday-january-10-201421/11970/|title=Breaking News - Development Update: Tuesday, January 10 - TheFutonCritic.com|website=www.thefutoncritic.com|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The script was ordered to pilot on February 2, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2017/02/02/development-update-thursday-february-2-619121/11993/|title=Breaking News - Development Update: Thursday, February 2 - TheFutonCritic.com|website=www.thefutoncritic.com|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 16, 2017, it was confirmed that [[Nia Long]] had been cast as the female lead in the role of Lucy Winston. At the same time it was confirmed that [[Tim Meadows]] would reprise his recurring role from ''The Goldbergs'' as Andre Glascott. Jay Chandrasekhar was also confirmed to direct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2017/03/09/development-update-thursday-march-9-66315/12027/|title=Breaking News - Development Update: Thursday, March 9 - TheFutonCritic.com|website=www.thefutoncritic.com|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 17, 2017, ABC passed on the spin-off,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/adamfgoldberg/status/865011205139812352|title=Adam F. Goldberg Twitter|publisher=Adam F. Goldberg|date=May 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite it reportedly testing very well - going as far to test better than the pilot of the original series.&lt;ref name="notsodead"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/goldbergs-1990s-set-pilot-air-abc-1073142|title='The Goldbergs' 1990s-Set Pilot to Air on ABC|publisher=|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Adam F. Goldberg revealed the title of the failed spin-off - "Schooled".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/adamfgoldberg/status/865012519265460225|title=Adam F. Goldberg Twitter|publisher=Adam F. Goldberg|date=May 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 8, 2018, it was announced that the pilot would air as a special episode of ''The Goldbergs'' on January 24, 2018, under the episode title ''The Goldbergs: 1990-Something''. Along with Nia Long as Lucy Winston and Tim Meadows as teacher-turned-principal Andre Glascott (who is also revealed to be Lucy's brother), the pilot also starred [[Rachel Crow]] as Lucy's rebellious teenage daughter Felicia, and Summer Parker as Felicia's bubbly younger sister Gigi, with [[Octavia Spencer]] narrating as the present-day Felicia.

After the pilot aired, Goldberg had expressed hope that the airing would prompt discussions with ABC that could lead to the series being picked up for the [[2018–19 United States network television schedule|2018–19]] TV season.&lt;ref name="notsodead" /&gt; Three months later, on April 16, 2018, it was announced that ABC had officially picked up the spin-off, ''Schooled'', for a 13-episode season slated to air in 2019. It was also announced that AJ Michalka would reprise her role as Lainey Lewis from ''The Goldbergs'' in the new show, but Nia Long will not return to the spin-off due to being a regular cast member on the [[CBS]] drama series ''[[NCIS: Los Angeles]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/goldbergs-1990s-set-spinoff-picked-up-series-at-abc-1090077|title='The Goldbergs' 1990s-Set Spinoff Picked Up to Series at ABC|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=April 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[contract law]], '''unjust enrichment''' occurs when one person is enriched at the expense of another in circumstances that the law sees as unjust.&lt;ref&gt;See generally: Mitchell et al, ''Goff &amp; Jones Law of Unjust Enrichment'' (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 8th ed, 2011); Graham Virgo, ''The Principles of the Law of Restitution'' (3rd ed, 2015); Andrew Burrows, ''The Law of Restitution'' (3rd ed, 2011); Mason, Carter, and Tolhurst, ''Mason &amp; Carter's Restitution Law in Australia'' (LexisNexis, 2nd ed, 2008). On unjust enrichment as a 'unifying legal concept', see the judgment of Deane J in ''Pavey &amp; Mathews v Paul'' (1987) 162 CLR 221.&lt;/ref&gt; Where an individual is unjustly enriched, the law imposes an obligation upon the recipient to make [[restitution]], subject to defences such as [[change of position]]. Liability for an unjust (or unjustified) enrichment arises irrespective of wrongdoing on the part of the recipient. The concept of unjust enrichment can be traced to Roman law and the maxim that "no one should be benefited at another's expense": ''nemo locupletari potest aliena iactura'' or ''nemo locupletari debet cum aliena iactura''.

The law of unjust enrichment is closely related to, but not co-extensive with, the [[Restitution|law of restitution]].  The law of restitution is the law of gain-based recovery. It is wider than the law of unjust enrichment. Restitution for unjust enrichment is a subset of the law of restitution in the same way that compensation for breach of contract is a subset of the law relating to [[Financial compensation|compensation]].

==Framework==

{{Contract law}}
Cases of unjust (or unjustified) enrichment can be examined in the following way:

* Was the defendant ''enriched''?
* Was the enrichment ''at the expense of the claimant''?
* Was the enrichment ''unjust'' ?
* Does the defendant have a ''defense''?
* What ''remedies'' are available to the claimant?
These questions are a familiar part of the modern [[English unjust enrichment law|English law of unjust enrichment]], having been popularised by the writing of [[Peter Birks|Professor Peter Birks]] and expressly endorsed by English courts.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''Bank of Cyprus v Menelou'' [2015] UKSC 66&lt;/ref&gt; The framework provides a useful taxonomical function in Australian law,&lt;ref&gt;See ''Lampson v Fortescue Metals (No 3)'' [2014] WASC 162 (Edelman J).&lt;/ref&gt; though the concept of unjust enrichment has been subject to inconsistent treatment by Australian courts, as discussed below. Stated at this level of abstraction, the framework is a useful grounding for comparative study between common law and civil law jurisdictions.

===History===
In systems of law derived from the English common law, the historical core of the law of unjust enrichment lies in [[quasi-contract]]. These were common law (as distinct from [[Equity (law)|equitable]]) claims giving rise to a personal liability to pay the money value of a benefit received from another. Legal scholars from [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[Harvard University|Harvard]] at the turn of the 20th century began to rationalise these disparate actions into a coherent body of law.&lt;ref&gt;See generally: Baker, ''An Introduction to English Legal History'' (4th edition); Graham Virgo, ''The Principles of the Law of Restitution'' (3rd ed, 2015); Andrew Burrows, ''The Law of Restitution'' (3rd ed, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; The principle said to underlie these actions was eventually recognized as unjust enrichment.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Pavey &amp; Matthews Pty Ltd v Paul|''Pavey &amp; Mathews v Paul'' [1987]]] (Australia); [[Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale Ltd|''Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale'' [1991]]] (England).&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent scholarship has sought to expand the explanatory power of the principle of unjust enrichment and it is now often said (albeit not without controversy)&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''Bofinger v Kingsway'' [2009] 239 CLR 269&lt;/ref&gt; to encompass both common law and [[Equity (law)|equitable]] claims.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Mitchell and Watterson, ''Subrogation: Law and Practice'' (2nd Edition).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Civil law (legal system)|civilian]] systems of law, unjust enrichment is often referred to as ''unjustified'' enrichment.

===The meaning of ''unjust'': unjust factors v absence of basis===

Generally speaking, the mere receipt of a benefit from another is unobjectionable and does not attract legal consequences. The exception is where such receipt is 'unjust' or 'unjustified'. Both [[Civil law (legal system)|civilian]] and [[common law]] legal systems have bodies of law providing remedies to reverse such enrichment.

A conceptual split, albeit one not necessarily coextensive with the civilian-common law distinction, is between systems based on an "unjust factor" approach and systems based on an "absence of basis" approach.
* [[Common law]] systems such as those of [[English law|England]], [[Law of Australia|Australia]], [[Law of Canada|Canada]] and the [[Law of the United States|United States]] typically adopt the "unjust factor" approach. In this analysis, the claimant must point to a positive reason why the defendant's enrichment is unjust. Examples of 'unjust factors' that ground a claim for restitution include: mistakes of fact or law; [[Failure of consideration|total failure of consideration]], [[Duress in English law|duress]], [[undue influence]], and the [[Woolwich Building Society v IRC|''Woolwich'']] ground.
* [[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]] systems such as those of [[Law of France|France]] and [[Law of Germany|Germany]] typically adopt an "absence of basis" approach. On this analysis, the defendant is obliged to make restitution if there is no 'basis' for her receipt: for example, because the contract under which the defendant received the benefit was void ''ab initio''. Some common law systems have showed signs of a possible shift towards this approach.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''Deutsche Morgan Grenfell v IRC'' [2007] 1 AC 558&lt;/ref&gt; 
In most cases, the conceptual approach does not affect the outcome of a case. For example, suppose that A makes an oral contract with B under which A will pay $100 for certain services to be provided by B. Further suppose that A pays the money but B discovers that, pursuant to legislation, contracts for such services are void unless in writing. B refuses to perform. Can A recover his payment? On both approaches, B is unjustly enriched at A's expense. On the "absence of basis" approach, B's enrichment has no legitimate explanatory basis because the contract was void. On the "unjust factor" approach, there has been a total failure of consideration; that is, A has received no part of the bargained-for counter-performance; restitution follows automatically from the fact of invalidity.

===Remedies for unjust enrichment: personal and proprietary restitution===

The remedy for unjust enrichment is [[restitution]]: the restoration of what was conferred to the claimant. In short, the correcting of the injustice that occurred when the claimant suffered a subtraction of wealth and the defendant received corresponding benefit.&lt;ref&gt;Note that it remains a controversial point, at least in [[English unjust enrichment law|English law]], whether there is a distinct 'correspondence principle'. See generally, Virgo, ''Principles of the Law of Restitution'' (3rd ed, 2015); Burrows, ''Law of Restitution'' (3rd ed, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Restitution can take the form of a personal or a proprietary remedy.

Where a ''personal remedy'' is awarded, the defendant is ordered to pay the money value of the benefit received. This personal money award is the typical form of restitution ordered.

Where a ''proprietary remedy'' is awarded, the court recognises (or declares) that the defendant has a beneficial or security interest in specific property of the defendant. Whether proprietary remedies can be awarded depends on the jurisdiction in question.  
* In English law, the orthodox view is that unjust enrichment generally triggers personal, rather than proprietary remedies.&lt;ref&gt;But see ''Bank of Cyprus v Menelaou'' [2015] UKSC 66&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the law of quasi-contract only generate personal money awards: either a liquidated debt (as in actions for money had and received or money paid) or a sum assessed by a civil jury or the court itself (as in quantum meruit or quantum valebat). Scholars seeking to expand the explanatory power of unjust enrichment have argued that other areas of the law such as subrogation and claims to traceable substitutes form part of the law of unjust enrichment. This view has been accepted, though its implications remain unclear.  
* In Australian law, actions derived from the common money counts continue to generate only personal remedies. The doctrinal basis of subrogation is not unsettled: it has nothing to do with unjust enrichment.&lt;ref&gt;''Bofinger v Kingsway'' [2009] HCA 44&lt;/ref&gt; Claims to traceable substitutes are a part of our law of property, not unjust enrichment.

==National systems==

=== Australia ===
Whether there is a distinct body of law in Australia known as the law of unjust enrichment is a highly controversial question. In ''[[Pavey &amp; Matthews Pty Ltd v Paul|Pavey &amp; Mathews v Paul]]'' (1987) 162 CLR 221 the concept of unjust enrichment was expressly endorsed by the High Court of Australia. This was subsequently followed in numerous first instance and appellate decisions, as well as by the High Court itself.

Considerable skepticism about the utility of the concept of unjust enrichment has been expressed in recent years. The [[Equity (law)|equitable]] basis for the action for money had and received has instead been emphasised and in ''Australian Financial v Hills'' [2014] HCA 14 the plurality held that the concept of unjust enrichment was effectively 'inconsistent' with the law of restitution as it had developed in Australia. It is worth noting that the analytic framework had been expressly endorsed by the High Court just two years before in ''Equuscorp v Haxton'' [2012] HCA 7. For the moment, the concept of unjust enrichment appears to serve only a taxonomical function.&lt;ref&gt;''Equuscorp v Haxton'' [2012] HCA 7; ''Lampson v Fortescue Metals (No 3)'' [2014] WASC 162 (Edelman J).
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belgium===
The acceptance of the unjust enrichment has been confirmed multiple times in [[Belgium]] by the [[Court of Cassation (Belgium)|Court of Cassation]], which has ruled that the unjust enrichment is a general principle of law.&lt;ref&gt;Cass. 17 November 1983, ''RW'' 1983-84, 2982.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cass. 7 September 2001, ''Cah.dr.immo'' 2002, 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cass. 19 January 2009, ''RCJB'' 2012, 69.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court has stated that the legal basis for the unjust enrichment is [[Equity (legal principle)|equity]].

According to the Court, five elements constitute the unjust enrichment:
#an enrichment;
#an impoverishment;
#a connection between the enrichment and the impoverishment;
#an absence of a cause of the enrichment;
#the person trying to invoke the unjust enrichment cannot invoke the [[negotiorum gestio]] or the [[undue payment]].

===United Kingdom===
{{main|Unjust enrichment in English law}}
The [[English unjust enrichment law|law of unjust enrichment in England]] rapidly developed during the second half of the 20th century. It has been heavily influenced by the writings of jurists from [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''Commerzbank v Gareth Price-Jones'' [2004] EWCA Civ 1663 at [47] (Mummery LJ).&lt;/ref&gt; England adopts the "unjust factor" approach.

=== United States ===
The ''[[Restatements of the Law|Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment]]'' states that unjust enrichment is enrichment that lacks an adequate legal basis. It results from a transfer that [[Law of the United States|the law]] treats as ineffective to work a conclusive alteration in ownership rights.&lt;ref&gt;Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment, §1, comment b (Discussion Draft 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[North Dakota Supreme Court]] has ruled that five elements must be established to prove unjust enrichment:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.court.state.nd.us/court/opinions/20000191.htm ''Schroeder v. Buchholz'', 2001 ND 36, 622 N.W.2d 202]&lt;/ref&gt;
* An enrichment
* An impoverishment
* A connection between enrichment and the impoverishment
* Absence of a justification for the enrichment and impoverishment
* An absence of a remedy provided by the law

Effectively, the civil law doctrine is now in effect in North Dakota, as it has been in Louisiana and in Puerto Rico; both of which are mixed jurisdictions.

In Massachusetts, there are some decisions denying recovery in restitution by the breaching party although this is not generally the rule in the United States.

Today, VII represents 19 photographers who have chronicled significant global events and topics since the late 1970s. 

VII established its reputation for news coverage during the war in Afghanistan that followed 9/11 and during the conflict in Israel/Palestine in 2002 and the invasion and occupation of Iraq in 2003. 

From being principally focused on news for editorial clients, the agency has diversified into social media, live events, video, and creative partnerships with [[NGOs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title= Photographers minefield|date=October 4, 2002|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/culture/article/2012/10/04/photographes-en-terrain-mine_1770417_3246.html?xtmc=vii_photo&amp;xtcr=11|archivedate= October 4, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; / colleges / universities, exhibitions in leading museums, featured appearances at major art and photo festivals, and education. 

In addition to the 19 current member photographers, young photographers are mentored by full members through the VII Mentor Program and represented by the agency.

== Projects ==

=== Newest Americans: Stories From the Global City ===
Newest Americans is a three-year longitudinal study at [[Rutgers University]]–Newark that will document the lives and communities of students at the university and take an in-depth look at immigration and the idea of American identity. It is a collaborative effort involving VII, Rutger’s Center for Migration and the Global City (CMGC)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Newest Americans|url=https://www.newark.rutgers.edu/news/newest-americans-project/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Department of Arts, Culture and Media. The project, spearheaded by Tim Raphael, director of CMGC, focuses on immigrant experiences in New Jersey with Newark as the hub where these different stories converge. ''Notes for My Homeland''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title =The Power and Passion of Composer Malek Jandali|url=http://proof.nationalgeographic.com/2015/01/27/the-power-and-passion-of-composer-malek-jandali/}}&lt;/ref&gt; was produced by  Talking Eyes Media &lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title =Talking Eyes Media|url=http://talkingeyesmedia.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the first professionally produced piece in the storytelling project.

=== Evolution Tour ===
For the Evolution Tour, photojournalists from VII Photo Agency, along with technical specialists from AbelCine, present an examination of the evolving business, technology and craft of visual storytelling.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abelcine.com/event/viievolutiontour/&lt;/ref&gt; This program is structured as a combination of seminars, panel discussions, hands-on workshops and networking.

=== European Workshops Series ===
In 2015, [[Ed Kashi]], [[Ron Haviv]], [[Marcus Bleasdale]], [[Stefano De Luigi]] and [[John Stanmeyer]], all members of VII Photo Agency will lead photography workshops in 4 different European capitals: Paris, Barcelona, Amsterdam and Berlin, as part of the Eyes in Progress’s workshops program.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eyesinprogress.com/7757/workshop-ronhaviv-berlin.html/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fatal Neglect === 
Through a partnership between VII, [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] (MSF, also known as Doctors Without Borders), and UNION HZ, Fatal Neglect is a multi-part documentary film project, to tell the stories of the millions of patients left behind by the global health revolution.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/news-stories/video/fatal-neglect-global-health-revolutions-forgotten-patients/&lt;/ref&gt; In Fatal Neglect: The Global Health Revolution’s Forgotten Patients, VII documents the impact of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and some of the deadliest neglected tropical diseases: “kala azar,” and “sleeping sickness.” Award-winning photojournalists Ron Haviv and John Stanmeyer traveled to capture the stories of frontline health workers trying to fight diseases that affect millions of people and kill hundreds of thousands each year yet garner little attention from drug developers, policy makers or the mass media.

=== Starved for Attention ===
In 2010, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) and VII Photo launched “Starved for Attention,” an international multimedia campaign to rewrite the story of childhood malnutrition.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.starvedforattention.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Petition signatures were collected from people around the world who joined the partnership  in demanding that donor nations stop supplying nutritionally substandard food to malnourished children.

[[File:Vannevar Bush portrait.jpg|thumb|180px|Vannevar Bush]]
The [[National Science Board]] established the '''Vannevar Bush Award''' ({{IPAc-en|v|æ|ˈ|n|iː|v|ər}} {{respell|van|NEE|vər}}) in 1980 to honor [[Vannevar Bush]]'s unique contributions to public service. The annual award recognizes an individual who, through public service activities in science and technology, has made an outstanding "contribution toward the welfare of mankind and the Nation." The recipient of the award receives a bronze medal struck in the memory of Dr. Bush. 

Vannevar Bush (1890–1974) was a prominent scientist, adviser to [[US presidents]], and the force behind the establishment of the [[National Science Foundation]]. In 1945, at the request of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], he wrote a famous essay entitled ''Science, the Endless Frontier'' which recommended that a foundation be established by the [[United States Congress]] to serve as a focal point for the [[USA Federal Government]]'s support and encouragement of research and education in science and technology as well as the development of a national science policy. The legislation creating the [[National Science Foundation]] was signed by president [[Harry S. Truman]] on May 10, 1950.

'''William Pulteney Alison''' &lt;small&gt;[[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] [[FRCPE]] [[FSA (Scot)|FSA]]&lt;/small&gt; (12 November 1790 – 22 September 1859) was a Scottish physician, social reformer and [[Philanthropy|philanthropist]]. He was a distinguished professor of medicine at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. He served as president of the [[Medico-Chirurgical Society of Edinburgh]] (1833), president of the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]] (1836–38), and vice-president of the [[British Medical Association]], convening its meeting in Edinburgh in 1858.

==Life==
Alison was born in [[Boroughmuirhead]] on 12 November 1790, eldest son of Dorothea Gregory and [[Archibald Alison (author)|Reverend Archibald Alison]], the elder brother of the advocate [[Archibald Alison (advocate)|Archibald Alison]]; and godson of [[Laura Pulteney, 1st Countess of Bath]]. In his youth he climbed [[Mont Blanc]] and other mountains as a pastime. He entered the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1803, and studied under his father's friend [[Dugald Stewart]], and for a time was expected to follow a career in philosophy rather than medicine. In 1811 he graduated as a physician.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1814 he opened the New Town Dispensary at 4 East James Street, at the east end of the city's [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://digital.nls.uk/83400219|title=Edinburgh Post Office annual directory, 1832-1833|last=|first=|date=|website=National Library of Scotland|page=52|access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His academic career was impressive. He became a Professor of Medical Jurisprudence in 1820. From 1822 to 1842 he lectured in the Institutes of Medicine. From 1842 to 1856 he lectured in the Theory of Physic.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

He was President of the Royal College of Physicians 1836-8, a [[Society of Antiquaries of Scotland|Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries]], President of the Medico-Chirurgical Society in 1833, and Vice President of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] 1842-59.

His uncle was [[Professor James Gregory]] and his cousin was [[Professor William Gregory]].

==Ameliorating the lot of the poor==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2017}}

Struck by the poverty he encountered, Alison advocated poor relief in Scotland be extended from the sick and infirm to include the healthy impoverished. This was a radical suggestion as the ethos of the age was for poor relief to be withheld from the able-bodied destitute who were presumed to be indolent and sinful.

Published in his report on the generation of fever in Edwin Chadwick’s “Report on the sanitary condition of the laboring population,” despite the general feeling of many physicians at the time, Alison was of the opinion that malarias, or diseases, were not a result of putrescent animal and vegetable matters or human excretions, as many medical professionals believed, but rather was convinced that some diseases were “nearly beyond the power of medicine, but the causes of which are known, and under certain circumstances may be avoided; and the conditions necessary for avoiding them are in a great measure in the power of communities, though beyond the power of many of the individuals composing them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/350|title=William Alison|website=www.oxforddnb.com|access-date=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;”

Alison proposed using the [[Scottish Poor Law]] to alleviate poverty as a means of assuaging disease, but the Poor Law Commissioners supported the position of English reformer [[Edwin Chadwick]] that disease was caused by filth and miasmas. Alison held to the contagion theory of disease, stating its spread was facilitated through poverty and overcrowding. He argued that poverty arose from social factors, not sin and sloth, and that higher wages should be paid to workers to mitigate disease by reducing the effect of overcrowding and destitution. In stating a case for fighting disease that appeared to be outside the province of contemporary medicine Alison was a pioneer of "political" medicine, as well as social epidemiology and public health.

In his 1840 publication ''Observations on the management of the poor in Scotland and its effect on the health in the great towns'', Alison argued that the government and its agencies had a major role in the alleviation of poverty and that this undertaking should not be left to religious groups or private charities. He advocated using public taxes to assist widows, orphans and the unemployed poor, and criticised the establishment for ignoring those who were fit but impoverished. The findings of the 1844 Royal Commission on Poor Laws (Scotland) lent support to Alison's viewpoint. Alison was very critical of the Scottish upper class for not providing what Alison believed to be adequate relief to the impoverished citizens of the country, while praising the English system, which had a long-established legislative framework to maintain minimum standards of relief for those suffering from poverty. Contrary to England’s governmental standards, Scotland’s system was based around voluntary charity by the wealthier members of society, justified by claiming that legal guarantees of support and relief for the impoverished would remove any motivation for the poor to work out of their situation and would rather create an incentive to stay stagnant as poor in order to receive governmental benefits. Alison counter argued, saying that it was unrelieved poverty that truly lowered the morality of the poor, and not providing any relief not only made the impoverished more prone to contract disease, but also more short-sighted and reckless. There was also no evidence in Alison’s mind that the English system of governmental relief had brought any of the negative consequences that the Scottish had attributed to it, and rather “the English people receive a temporal reward for their more humane and merciful management of the poor, in the comparative exemption of most of their great towns from the curse of contagious fever.”

Alison also promoted preventive social medicine and initiated a program to vaccinate children against smallpox, and he established Edinburgh's Fever Board to combat epidemics. He advocated speedy diagnosis of the ill and, where found to be contagious or infectious, he recommended fumigation and ventilation of the residence and prompt hospitalisation for the patient. His methods bore fruit during the cholera epidemic of 1831–1832, whereby Edinburgh took immediate and effective action to mitigate the outbreak without awaiting instructions from London.

In strongly advocating government intervention to alleviate poverty as a means to combat disease, Alison was ahead of his time but he lived to see public opinion move closer to his initiatives.

==Personal life==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2017}}

He married his first cousin Margaret Craufurd/Crawford Gregory (1809–1849), daughter of [[James Gregory (physician)|James Gregory]] in 1832; the marriage was childless.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Attacks of [[epilepsy]] forced him to retire in 1856, and he died at [[Colinton]] on 22 September 1859. He was interred at [[St John's Episcopal Cemetery]] in Edinburgh.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
