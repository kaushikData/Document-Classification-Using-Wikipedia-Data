'''''A Collation of Four Important Manuscripts of the Gospels''''', full title: ''A Collation of Four Important Manuscripts of the Gospels: With a View to Prove Their Common Origin, and to Restore the Text of Their Archetype''. The book was published in 1877 by Thomas Kingsmill Abbott on behalf of his deceased colleague William Hugh Ferrar.

[[William Hugh Ferrar]] (1826–1871) before his death collated four [[Minuscule Greek|minuscules]] (Greek handwritten [[Lower case|cursive]] texts) to demonstrate that they shared a common provenance. The four collated minuscules are: [[Minuscule 13|13]], [[Minuscule 69|69]], [[Minuscule 124|124]], [[Minuscule 346|346]] (known as [[Family 13]] or ''Ferrar Family''). Ferrar intended to establish that these four codices are derived from a common archetype, and to exhibit as nearly as possible the actual text of this [[archetype]] of these four minuscules, a text, therefore, more ancient and authoritative than of any of these manuscripts separately.

The book was published in 1877 by [[Thomas Kingsmill Abbott|T. K. Abbott]] on behalf of William Hugh Ferrar, who had died six years previous.

'''American urban history''' is the study of cities of the United States. [[Local history|Local historians]] have always written about their own cities. Starting in the 1920s, and led by [[Arthur Schlesinger, Sr.]] at Harvard, professional historians began comparative analysis of what cities have in common, and started using theoretical models and scholarly biographies of specific cities.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Frisch,  "American urban history as an example of recent historiography." ''History and Theory'' (1979): 350-377. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2504535 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=2344 Online review by  Andrea Tuttle Kornbluh  1998.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The United States has also had a long history of hostility to the city, as characterized for example by Thomas Jefferson's [[History of agrarianism|agrarianism]] and the [[People's Party (United States)|Populist movement]] of the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Conn, ''Americans Against the City: Anti-Urbanism in the Twentieth Century'' (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;  Mary Sies (2003) argues:
:At the start of the twenty-first century, North American urban history is flourishing. Compared to twenty-five years ago, the field has become more interdisciplinary and intellectually invigorating.  Scholars are publishing increasingly sophisticated efforts to understand how the city as space intersects the urbanization process, as well as studies that recognize the full complexity of experiences for different metropolitan cohorts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first = Mary Corbin |last = Sies|title = North American Urban History: The Everyday Politics and Spatial Logics of Metropolitan Life|journal = Urban History Review/Revue d'histoire urbaine|volume = 32|number =1 |date =2003|pages = 28-42|url = http://www.erudit.org/revue/uhr/2003/v32/n1/1015740ar.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historiography ==
American urban history is a branch of the [[history of the United States]] and of the broader field of [[Urban history]]. That field of history examines the historical development of cities and towns, and the process of [[urbanization]]. The approach is often multidisciplinary, crossing boundaries into fields like [[social history]], [[architectural history]], [[urban sociology]], [[urban geography]] [[business history]], and even [[archaeology]]. [[Urbanization]] and [[industrialization]] were popular themes for 20th-century historians, often tied to an implicit model of [[modernization]], or the transformation of rural traditional societies.

In the United States from the 1920s to the 1990s many influential monographs began as one of the 140 PhD dissertations at Harvard University directed by [[Arthur Schlesinger, Sr.]] (1888–1965) or [[Oscar Handlin]] (1915–2011).&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. Stave, ed., ''The Making of Urban History: Historiography through Oral History'' (1977) [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0803908687 in Google]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terrence J. McDonald, "Theory and Practice in the 'New' History: Rereading Arthur Meier Schlesinger's The Rise of the City, 1878-1898," ''Reviews in American History'' (1992) 20#3 pp. 432-445 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2703171 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  Schlesinger and his students took a group approach to history, sharply downplaying the role of individuals. Handlin added a focus on groups defined by ethnicity (that is Germans, Irish, Jews, Italians Hispanics etc.) or by class (working class or middle class). The Harvard model was that the urban environment, including the interaction with other groups, shaped their history and group outlook.&lt;ref&gt;Zane L. Miller,  "The Crisis of Civic and Political Virtue: Urban History, Urban Life and the New Understanding of the City." ''Reviews in American History'' 24.3 (1996) pp: 361-368. [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/reviews_in_american_history/v024/24.3miller.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New urban history ===
The "new urban history" was a short-lived movement that attracted a great deal of attention In the 1960s, then quickly disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Thernstrom and Richard Sennett, eds., ''Nineteenth-century Cities: Essays in the New Urban History'' (1970)&lt;/ref&gt; It used statistical methods and innovative computer techniques to analyze manuscript census data, person by person, focusing especially on the geographical and social mobility of random samples of residents. Numerous monographs appeared, but it proved frustrating to interpret the results. Historian [[Stephan Thernstrom]], the leading promoter of the new approach, soon disavowed it, saying it was neither new nor urban nor history.&lt;ref&gt;Eric H. Monkkonen, ''America Becomes Urban: The Development of U.S. Cities and Towns, 1780-1980'' (1988) pp 26-27&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall urban history grew rapidly in the 1970s and 1980s, stimulated by the surge of interest in social history.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond A. Mohl, "The History of the American City," in William H. Cartwright and Richard L. Watson Jr. eds., ''Reinterpretation of American History and Culture'' (1973)  pp 165-205&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the 1990s, however, the field has been aging and has had much less attraction to younger scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Bender|title=Intellect and Public Life: Essays on the Social History of Academic Intellectuals in the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=240iKp_jVjoC&amp;pg=PR11|year=1997|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|page=11|quote= urban history, a field marked by deep decline in historiographical significance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Claims for urban impact ===
Historian [[Richard Clement Wade|Richard Wade]] has summarized the claims that scholars have made for the importance of the city in American history. The cities were the focal points for the growth of the West, especially those along the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. The cities, especially Boston, were the seed beds of the American Revolution.  Rivalry between cities, such as between Baltimore and Philadelphia, or between Chicago and St. Louis, stimulated economic innovations and growth, especially regarding the railroads.  The cities sponsored [[entrepreneurship]], especially in terms of export and import markets, banking, finance, and the rise of the [[factory system]] after 1812.  The rapidly growing railroad system after 1840 was primarily oriented toward linking together the major cities, which in turn became centers of the wholesale trade.  The railroads allowed major cities such as Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Denver, and San Francisco to dominate ever-larger [[hinterland]]s.

The failure of the South to develop an urban infrastructure significantly weakened it during the Civil War, especially as its border cities of Baltimore, Washington, Louisville, and St. Louis, refused to join the Confederacy.  The cities were fonts of innovation in democracy, especially in terms of building powerful political organizations and [[political machine|machines]]; they were also the main base for reformers of those machines.  They became the home base for important immigrant groups, especially the Irish and the Jews.  Cities were the strongholds of labor unions in the 19th and 20th centuries (although no longer so in the 21st century).&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wade, "The City in History: Some American Perspectives," in Werner Z. Hirsch, ed., ''Urban Life and Form'' (1963) pp 59-77&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Zane Miller argues that urban history was rejuvenated in mid-20th century by the realization that the cultural importance of the city went far beyond art galleries and museums. Historians began to emphasize "the importance of individual choices in the past and made the advocacy of lifestyle choices a hallmark of American civilization."  It was the diversity of the city, and the support it provided for diverse lifestyles, that set it so dramatically apart from towns and rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, "The Crisis of Civic and Political Virtue: Urban History, Urban Life and the New Understanding of the City."&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1990s there was increased emphasis on racial minorities, outcasts, and gays and lesbians, as well as studies of leisure activities and sports history.&lt;ref&gt;George Chauncey, ''Gay New York: Gender, urban culture, and the making of the gay male world, 1890-1940'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven A. Riess, ''City games: The evolution of American urban society and the rise of sports'' (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intellectuals against the city===
As Morton White demonstrated in ''The Intellectual versus the City: from Thomas Jefferson to Frank Lloyd Wright'' (1962), the overwhelming consensus of American intellectuals has been hostile to the city. The main idea is the Romantic view that the unspoiled nature of rural America is morally superior  to the over civilized cities, which are the natural homes of sharpsters and criminals. American poets did not rhapsodize over the cities. On the contrary they portrayed the metropolis as The ugly scene of economic inequality, crime, drunkenness, prostitution and every variety of immorality. Urbanites were set to rhyme as crafty, overly competitive, artificial, and as having lost too much naturalness and goodness.&lt;ref&gt;Robert H. Walker, "The Poet and the Rise of the City." ''Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' (1962): 85-99. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1889467 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Colonial era and American Revolution ==
Historian [[Carl Bridenbaugh]] examined in depth five key cities: Boston (population 16,000 in 1760), Newport Rhode Island (population 7500), New York City (population 18,000), Philadelphia (population 23,000), and Charles Town (Charlestown, South Carolina), (population 8000). He argues they grew from small villages to take major leadership roles in promoting trade, land speculation, immigration, and prosperity, and in disseminating the ideas of the Enlightenment, and new methods in medicine and technology. Furthermore, they sponsored a consumer taste for English amenities, developed a distinctly American educational system, and began systems for care of people meeting welfare.  The cities were not remarkable by European standards, but they did display certain distinctly American characteristics, according to Bridenbaugh. There was no aristocracy or established church, there was no long tradition of powerful guilds. The colonial governments were much less powerful and intrusive and corresponding national governments in Europe. They experimented with new methods to raise revenue, build infrastructure and to solve urban problems.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Bridenbaugh, ''Cities in the Wilderness-The First Century of Urban Life in America 1625-1742'' (1938) [https://www.questia.com/library/7916885/cities-in-the-wilderness-the-first-century-of-urban online edition]&lt;/ref&gt; They were more democratic than European cities, in that a large fraction of the men could vote, and class lines were more fluid.  Contrasted to Europe, printers (especially as newspaper editors) had a much larger role in shaping public opinion, and lawyers moved easily back and forth between politics and their profession. Bridenbaugh argues that by the mid-18th century, the middle-class businessmen, professionals, and skilled artisans dominated the cities. He characterizes them as "sensible, shrewd, frugal, ostentatiously moral, generally honest," public spirited, and upwardly mobile, and argues their economic strivings led to "democratic yearnings" for political power.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Bridenbaugh, ''Cities in Revolt: Urban Life in America, 1743-1776'' (1955), pp 147, 332&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin L. Carp, "Cities in review,"  ''Common-Place'' (July 2003) 3#4 [http://www.common-place.org/vol-03/no-04/reviews/carp.shtml online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315142529/http://www.common-place.org/vol-03/no-04/reviews/carp.shtml |date=2015-03-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:View of New Archangel, 1837.tif|thumb|right|380px| The capital of the [[Russian-American Company]] at New Archangel (present day [[Sitka, Alaska]]) in 1837]]
Colonial powers established villages of a few hundred population as administrative centers, providing a governmental presence, as well has trading opportunities, and some transportation facilities. Representative examples include Spanish towns of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], [[San Antonio, Texas]], and [[Los Angeles, California]], French towns of [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] and [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]; Dutch towns of [[New Amsterdam]] (New York City), and the Russian town of [[Sitka, Alaska|New Archangel]] (now Sitka).  When their territory was absorbed into the United States, these towns expanded their administrative roles.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Ernest Cooke, ed., ''Encyclopedia of the North American colonies'' (1993) 1: 113-154, 233-244.&lt;/ref&gt;
Numerous historians have explored the roles of working-class men, including slaves, in the economy of the colonial cities,&lt;ref&gt;Seth Rockman, "Work in the Cities of Colonial British North America," ''Journal of Urban History'' (2007) 33#6 pp 1021-1032&lt;/ref&gt; and in the early Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Seth Rockman, "Class and the History of Working People in the Early Republic." ''Journal of the Early Republic'' (2005) 25#4 pp: 527-535. [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/jer/summary/v025/25.4rockman.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

There were few cities in the entire South, and Charleston (Charles Town) and New Orleans were the most important before the Civil War. The colony of South Carolina was settled mainly by [[Planter (American South)|planters]] from the overpopulated [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|sugar]] island colony of [[Barbados]], who brought large numbers of African slaves from that island.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Wood, ''Origins of American Slavery'' (1997), pp. 64–65.&lt;/ref&gt;  As Charleston grew as a port for the shipment of rice and later cotton, so did the community's cultural and social opportunities. The city had a large base of elite merchants and rich planters. The first theater building in America was built in Charleston in 1736, but was later replaced by the 19th-century Planter's Hotel where wealthy planters stayed during Charleston's horse-racing season (now the Dock Street Theatre, known as one of the oldest active theaters built for stage performance in the United States.  Benevolent societies were formed by several different ethnic groups: the South Carolina Society, founded by French [[Huguenot]]s in 1737; the German Friendly Society, founded in 1766; and the Hibernian Society, founded by Irish immigrants in 1801. The [[Charleston Library Society]] was established in 1748 by some wealthy Charlestonians who wished to keep up with the scientific and philosophical issues of the day. This group also helped establish the [[College of Charleston]] in 1770, the oldest college in South Carolina, the oldest municipal college in the United States, and the 13th oldest college in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Walter J. Fraser, ''Charleston! Charleston!: The History of a Southern City'' (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1775 the largest city was Philadelphia at 40,000, followed by New York (25,000), Boston (16,000), Charleston (12,000), and Newport (11,000), along with Baltimore, Norfolk, and Providence, with 6000, 6000, and 4400 population. They too were all seaports and on any one day each hosted a large transient population of Sailors and visiting businessmen. On the eve of the Revolution, 95 percent of the American population lived outside the cities—much to the frustration of the British, who were able to capture the cities with their Royal Navy, but lacked the manpower to occupy and subdue the countryside. In explaining the importance of the cities in shaping the American Revolution, Benjamin Carp compares the important role of waterfront workers, taverns, churches, kinship networks, and local politics.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin L. Carp, ''Rebels Rising: Cities and the American Revolution'' (2007) [https://www.questia.com/library/120077070/rebels-rising-cities-and-the-american-revolution online edition]&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Gary B. Nash]] emphasizes the role of the working class, and their distrust of their betters, in northern ports. He argues that working class artisans and skilled craftsmen made up a radical element in Philadelphia that took control of the city starting about 1770 and promoted a radical Democratic form of government during the revolution. They held power for a while, and used their control of the local militia disseminate their ideology to the working class and to stay in power until the businessmen staged a conservative counterrevolution.&lt;ref&gt;Gary B. Nash, ''The Urban Crucible: The Northern Seaports and the Origins of the American Revolution'' (2nd ed. 1986) pp 240-47; the first edition of 1979 was entitled ''Urban Crucible: Social Change, Political Consciousness, and the Origins of the American Revolution)''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GROWTH1850.JPG|thumb|350px|trends in economic growth, 1700–1850]]

== The new nation, 1783–1815 ==
The cities played a major role in fomenting the American Revolution, but they were hard hit during the war itself, 1775-83. They lost their main role as oceanic ports, because of the blockade by the British Navy.  Furthermore, the British occupied the cities, especially New York 1776-83, as well as Boston, Philadelphia and Charleston for briefer periods.  During the occupations cities were cut off from their hinterland trade and from overland communication. The British finally departed in 1783, they took out large numbers of wealthy merchants, resume their business activities elsewhere in the British Empire.  The older cities finally restored their economic basis; growing cities included Salem, Massachusetts, (which opened a new trade with China), New London, Connecticut, and especially Baltimore, Maryland.  The Washington administration under the leadership of Secretary of the treasury Alexander Hamilton set up a national bank in 1791, and local banks began to flourish in all the cities. Merchant entrepreneurship flourished and was a powerful engine of prosperity in the cities.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. East, "The Business Entrepreneur in a Changing Colonial Economy, 1763-1795," ''Journal of Economic History''  (May, 1946), Vol. 6, Supplement pp. 16-27 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2113072 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Merchants and financiers of the cities were especially sensitive to the weakness of the old Confederation system; when it came time to ratify the much stronger new Constitution in 1788, all the nation's cities, North and South, voted in favor, while the rural districts were divided.&lt;ref&gt;Richard C. Wade, "An Agenda for Urban History," in Herbert J. Bass, ed., ''The State of American History'' (1970) pp 58-59&lt;/ref&gt;

The national capital was at Philadelphia until 1800, when it was moved to Washington. Apart from the murderous Yellow Fever epidemic of 1793, which killed about 10 percent of the population, Philadelphia had a marvelous reputation as the "cleanest, best-governed, healthiest, and most elegant of American cities." Washington, built in a fever-ridden swamp with long hot miserable summers, was ranked far behind Philadelphia, although it did escape Yellow Fever.&lt;ref&gt;Russel Blaine Nye, ''The Cultural Life of the New Nation: 1776-1830'' (1960) pp 127-28&lt;/ref&gt;

World peace only lasted a decade, for in 1793 a two-decade-long war between Britain and France and their allies broke out.  As the leading neutral trading partner the United States did business with both sides. France resented it, and the [[Quasi-War]] of 1798-99 disrupted trade. Outraged at British impositions on American merchant ships, and sailors, the Jefferson and Madison administrations engaged in economic warfare with Britain [[Embargo of 1807|1807-1812]], and then [[War of 1812|full-scale warfare 1812 to 1815]]. The result was additional serious damage to the mercantile interests.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis P. Nettles, ''The Emergence of a National Economy, 1775-1815'' (1962) remains the best economic overview.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Allen Krout and Dixon Ryan Fox, ''The Completion of Independence, 1790–1830'' (1944) is a wide-ranging social history of the new nation; see pp 1-73&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all was gloomy in urban history, however. Although there was relatively little immigration from Europe,  the [[American frontier|rapid expansion of settlements]] to the West, and the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803, open up vast frontier lands. New Orleans and St. Louis joined the United States, and entirely new cities were opened in Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Nashville and points west.  Historian Richard Wade has emphasized the importance of the new cities in the Westward expansion in settlement of the farmlands. They were the transportation centers, and nodes for migration and financing of the westward expansion. The newly opened regions had few roads, but a very good river system in which everything flowed downstream to New Orleans. With the coming of the steamboat after 1820, it became possible to move merchandise imported from the Northeast and from Europe upstream to new settlements. The opening of the [[Erie Canal]] made Buffalo the jumping off point for the lake transportation system that made important cities out of Cleveland, Detroit, and especially Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;Richard C. Wade, ''The urban frontier: pioneer life in early Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Lexington, Louisville, and St. Louis'' (1959).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[History of New York City (1784–1854)|New York]], with a population of 96,000 in 1810 surged far beyond its rivals, reaching a population of 1,080,000 in 1860, compared to 566,000 in Philadelphia, 212,000 in Baltimore, 178,000 in Boston (289,000 including the Boston suburbs), and 169,000 in New Orleans.&lt;ref&gt;George Rogers Taylor, ''The transportation revolution, 1815-1860'' (1951) pp 388-89.&lt;/ref&gt;  Historian Robert Albion identifies four aggressive moves by New York entrepreneurs and politicians that helped it jump to the top of American cities. It set up an auction system that efficiently and rapidly sold imported cargoes; it organized a regular transatlantic packet service to England; it built a large-scale coastwise trade, especially one that brought Southern cotton to New York for reexport to Europe; it sponsored the Erie Canal, which opened a large new market in upstate New York and the Old Northwest.&lt;ref&gt;Robert G. Albion, "New York Port and its disappointed rivals, 1815-1860." ''Journal of Business and Economic History'' (1931) 3: 602-629.&lt;/ref&gt; The main rivals, Boston Philadelphia and Baltimore, tried to compete with the Erie Canal by opening their own networks of canals and railroads; they never caught up.&lt;ref&gt;Julius Rubin, "Canal or railroad? Imitation and innovation in the response to the Erie canal in Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Boston." ''Transactions of the American Philosophical Society'' (1961): 1-106.&lt;/ref&gt;  The opening of the [[Erie Canal]] made Buffalo the jumping off point for the lake transportation system that made important cities out of Cleveland, Detroit, and especially Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence V. Roth, "The Growth of American Cities." ''Geographical Review'' (1918) 5#5 pp: 384-398. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/207468 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;   Manufacturing was not a major factor in the growth of the largest cities at this point. Instead  factories were chiefly being built in towns and smaller cities, especially in New England, having waterfalls or fast rivers that were harnessed to generate the power, or were closer to coal supplies, as in Pennsylvania.

===National leadership===
America's financial, business and cultural leadership (that is, literature, the arts, and the media) were concentrated in the three or four largest cities. Political leadership was never concentrated. It was divided between Washington and the state capitals, and many states deliberately moved their state capital out of their largest city, including New York, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois, Missouri, South Carolina, Louisiana, Texas and California.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Montès, ''American Capitals: A Historical Geography'' (2014) &amp;&lt;/ref&gt;  Academic and scientific leadership was weak in the United States until the late 19th century, when it began to be concentrated in universities. A few major research-oriented schools were in or close by the largest cities, such as Harvard (Boston),  Columbia (New York), Johns Hopkins (Baltimore) and Chicago. However,  most were located in smaller cities or large towns such as Yale in New Haven, Connecticut; Cornell in Ithaca, New York; Princeton in Princeton, New Jersey; the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor; University of Illinois in Urbana; University of Wisconsin in Madison;  University of California in Berkeley, and Stanford in the village of Stanford, California.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Meier Schlesinger, ''The Rise of the City: 1878-1898'' (1933) pp 82-87, 212-16, 247-48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil War==
{{U.S. cities in the Civil War}}

The cities played a major part in the Civil War, providing soldiers, money, training camps, supplies, and media support for the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union war effort]].

In the North, discontent with the 1863 [[Conscription in the United States#Early drafts|draft]] law led to riots in several cities and in rural areas as well. By far the most important were the [[New York City draft riots]] of July 13 to July 16, 1863.&lt;ref&gt;Barnet Schecter, ''The Devil's Own Work: The Civil War Draft Riots and the Fight to Reconstruct America'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Irish Catholic and other workers fought police, militia and regular army units until the Army used artillery to sweep the streets. Initially focused on the draft, the protests quickly expanded into violent attacks on blacks in New York City, with many killed on the streets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/317749.html The New York City Draft Riots] ''In the Shadow of Slavery: African Americans in New York City'', 1626–1863, by Leslie M. Harris&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of the small Michigan cities of Grand Rapids and Niles shows an overwhelming surge of nationalism in 1861, whipping up enthusiasm for the war in all segments of society, and all political, religious, ethnic, and occupational groups. However, by 1862 the casualties were mounting and the war was increasingly focused on freeing the slaves in addition to preserving the Union.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Bratt, "A Great Revolution in Feeling: The American Civil War in Niles and Grand Rapids, Michigan," ''Michigan Historical Review'' (2005) 31#2 pp 43–66.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperhead Democrats]] called the war a failure and it became more and more a partisan Republican effort.&lt;ref&gt;Martin J. Hershock, "Copperheads and Radicals: Michigan Partisan Politics during the Civil War Era, 1860–1865," ''Michigan Historical Review'' (1992) 18#1 pp 28–69&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confederacy===
Cities played a much less important part in the heavily rural Confederacy. When the war started the largest cities in slave states were seized in 1861 by the Union, including Washington, Baltimore, Wheeling, Louisville, and St. Louis. The largest and most important Confederate city, New Orleans, was captured in early 1862, and Nashville in 1863. All these cities became major logistic and strategic centers for the Union forces.  All the remaining ports were blockaded by the summer of 1861, ending normal commercial traffic, with only very expensive blockade runners getting through. The largest remaining cities were Atlanta, the railroad center which was destroyed in 1864, in the national capital in Richmond which held out to the bitter end.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew L. Slap, and Frank Towers, eds. ''Confederate Cities: The Urban South during the Civil War Era''  (University of Chicago Press, 2015). xiv, 302 pp. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

The overall decline in food supplies, made worse by the inadequate transportation system, led to serious shortages and high prices in Confederate cities. When bacon reached a dollar a pound in 1864, the poor white women of Richmond, Atlanta and many other cities began to riot; they broke into shops and warehouses to seize food. The women expressed their anger at ineffective state relief efforts, speculators, merchants and planters. As wives and widows of soldiers they were hurt by the inadequate welfare system.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie McCurry, "'Bread or Blood!'" ''Civil War Times'' (2011) 50#3 pp 36–41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Teresa Crisp Williams, and David Williams, "'The Women Rising': Cotton, Class, and Confederate Georgia's Rioting Women," ''Georgia Historical Quarterly,'' (2002) 86#12 pp. 49–83&lt;/ref&gt;

The eleven Confederate states in 1860 had 297 towns and cities with 835,000 people; of these 162 with 681,000 people were at one point occupied by Union forces. Eleven were destroyed or severely damaged by war action, including Atlanta (with an 1860 population of 9,600), Charleston, Columbia, and Richmond (with prewar populations of 40,500, 8,100, and 37,900, respectively); the eleven contained 115,900 people in the 1860 census, or 14% of the urban South. The number of people (as of 1860) who lived in the destroyed towns represented just over 1% of the Confederacy's 1860 population.&lt;ref&gt;Paul F. Paskoff, "Measures of War: A Quantitative Examination of the Civil War's Destructiveness in the Confederacy," ''Civil War History,'' (2008) 54#1 pp 35–62&lt;/ref&gt;

== Late 19th century growth==
{{Further|Gilded Age}}
===Street traffic===
In a horse-drawn era, streets were unpaved and covered with dirt or gravel.  However, they produced uneven wear, opened new hazards for pedestrians and made for dangerous potholes for bicycles and for motor vehicles. Manhattan alone had 130,000 horses in 1900, pulling streetcars, wagons, and carriages, and leaving their waste behind. They were not fast, and pedestrians could dodge and scramble their way across the crowded streets.  Small towns continued to rely on dirt and gravel, but larger cities wanted much better streets, so they looked to wood or granite blocks.&lt;ref&gt;David O. Whitten, "A Century of Parquet Pavements: Wood as a Paving Material In The United States And Abroad, 1840-1940." ''Essays in Economic and Business History'' 15 (1997): 209-26.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890, a third of Chicago's 2000 miles of streets were paved, chiefly with wooden blocks, which gave better traction than mud.  Brick surfacing was a good compromise, but even better was [[asphalt]] paving. With London and Paris as models, Washington laid 400,000 square yards of asphalt paving by 1882, and served as a model for Buffalo, Philadelphia and elsewhere. By the end of the century, American cities boasted 30 million square yards of asphalt paving, followed by brick construction.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Maier Schlesinger, ''The Rise of the City: 1878-1898'' (1933) p 88-93.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the largest cities, street railways were elevated, which increased their speed and lessened their dangers. Street-level trolleys moved passengers at 12 miles per hour for 5 cents a ride (with free transfers), They became the main transportation service for middle class shoppers and office workers until they bought automobiles after 1945 and commuted from more distant suburbs in privacy and comfort. The working-class typically walked to nearby factories and patronized small local stores.  Big-city streets became paths for faster and larger and more dangerous vehicles, the pedestrians beware.  Underground subways were a solution, with Boston building one in the 1890s followed by New York a decade later.&lt;ref&gt;John D. Fairfield, "Rapid Transit: Automobility and Settlement in Urban America" ''Reviews in American History'' 23#1 (1995), pp. 80-85 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2703240 online].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The new West ===
After 1860, railroads pushed westward into unsettled territory. They built service towns to handle the needs of railroad construction and repair crews, train crews, and passengers who ate meals at scheduled stops.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Hudson, "Towns of the western railroads." ''Great Plains Quarterly'' 2#1 (1982): 41-54. [http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2671&amp;context=greatplainsquarterly online]&lt;/ref&gt;  Gunfights and disorder characterized the [[railhead]] towns that were the target of major [[cattle drive]]s from Texas.  The violence was often exaggerated in [[dime novel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Robert R. Dykstra, ''The cattle towns'' (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odie B. Faulk, ''Dodge City: The Most Western Town Of All'' (1977).&lt;/ref&gt;  In most of the South, there were very few cities of any size for miles around, and this held for Texas as well. Railroads finally arrived in the 1880s and they shipped the cattle out; cattle drives became short-distance affairs.  However the passenger trains were often the targets of armed gangs.&lt;ref&gt;William C. Holden, "Law and Lawlessness on the Texas Frontier, 1875-1890." ''The Southwestern Historical Quarterly'' 44.2 (1940): 188-203. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30240564 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Denver]]'s economy before 1870 had been rooted in mining; it then grew by expanding its role in railroads, wholesale trade, manufacturing, food processing, and servicing the growing agricultural and ranching hinterland. Between 1870 and 1890, manufacturing output soared from $600,000 to $40 million, and the population grew by a factor of 20 times to 107,000. Denver had always attracted miners, workers, whores and travelers. Saloons and gambling dens sprung up overnight. The city fathers boasted of its fine theaters, and especially the Tabor Grand Opera House built in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Leonard, and Thomas J. Noel, ''Denver: Mining Camp to Metropolis'' (1990) pp.&amp;nbsp;44–45&lt;/ref&gt; By 1890, Denver had grown to be the 26th largest city in America, and the fifth-largest city west of the Mississippi River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0027/tab12.txt|title = Population of the 100 Largest Urban Places: 1890|publisher = U.S. Bureau of the Census|date = 15 June 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boom times attracted millionaires and their mansions, as well as hustlers, poverty and crime. Denver gained regional notoriety with its range of bawdy houses, from the sumptuous quarters of renowned madams to the squalid "cribs" located a few blocks away. Business was good; visitors spent lavishly, then left town. As long as madams conducted their business discreetly, and "crib girls" did not advertise their availability too crudely, authorities took their bribes and looked the other way. Occasional cleanups and crack downs satisfied the demands for reform.&lt;ref&gt;Clark Secrest. ''Hell's Belles: Prostitution, Vice, and Crime in Early Denver, with a Biography of Sam Howe, Frontier Lawman.'' (2nd ed., 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

With its giant mountain of copper, [[Butte, Montana]] was the largest, richest and rowdiest [[mining camp]] on the frontier. It was an ethnic stronghold, with the Irish Catholics in control of politics and of the best jobs at the leading mining corporation [[Anaconda Copper]].&lt;ref&gt;David M. Emmons, ''The Butte Irish: class and ethnicity in an American mining town, 1875-1925'' (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; City boosters opened a public library in 1894. Ring argues that the library was originally a mechanism of social control, "an antidote to the miners' proclivity for drinking, whoring, and gambling." It was also designed to promote middle-class values and to convince Easterners the Butte was a cultivated city.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel F. Ring, "The Origins of the Butte Public Library: Some Further Thoughts on Public Library Development in the State of Montana," ''Libraries &amp; Culture'' (1993) 28#4 pp.&amp;nbsp;430–44 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25542594 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Appreciative crowds filled the large, upscale "Belasco" opera house for full-scale operas and top-name artists.&lt;ref&gt;Archie L. Clark, "John Maguire, Butte's" Belasco"." The Montana Magazine of History (1952): 32-40. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4515771 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skyscrapers and apartment buildings===
{{Main|skyscraper|apartment|tenement}}
In Chicago and New York, new inventions facilitated the emergence of the skyscraper in the 1880s—it was a characteristic American style that was not widely copied around the world until the late 20th century. Construction required several major innovations, the elevator, and the steel beam.  The steel skeleton, developed in the 1880s, replaced the heavy brick walls that were limited to 15 or so stories in height. The skyscraper also required a complex internal structure to solve difficult issues of ventilation, steam heat, gas lighting (and later electricity), and plumbing.&lt;ref&gt;George H. Douglas, ''Skyscrapers: A social history of the very tall building in America'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Urban housing involved a wide variety of styles, but most of the attention focused on the tenement house for the working class, and the apartment building for the middle class.

The apartment building came first, as middle-class professionals, businessmen, and white-collar workers realized they did not need and could scarcely afford single-family dwellings of the type that low land costs in the towns permitted. Boarding houses were inappropriate for family; hotel suites were too expensive.  In smaller cities, there were many apartments over stores and shops, usually occupied by proprietors of small local businesses. The residents paid rent, and did not own their apartments until the emergence of cooperatives in New York City in the 20th century, and condominiums around the country after World War II. Turnover was very high, and there was seldom was a sense of neighborhood community.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Kallman Epstein, "Multifamily Dwellings and the Search for Respectability: Origins of the New York Apartment House," ''Urbanism Past &amp; Present'' (1980) Issue 2, pp 29-39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Collins Cromley, ''Alone Together: A History of New York's Early Apartments'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;
  
[[File:The Dakota 1880s.jpg|left|180px|thumb|The Dakota luxury apartment building in New York, view from [[Central Park]],  1890]]

Starting with the Stuyvesant luxury apartment house that opened in New York in 1869, and [[The Dakota]] in 1884, affluent tenants discovered that full-time staff handled the upkeep and maintenance, as well as security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first =Stephen |last = Birmingham|title = Life at the Dakota|date = 1979|publisher = Random House|isbn = 9780394410791}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Alpern, ''New York's Fabulous Luxury Apartments: With Original Floor Plans from the Dakota, River House, Olympic Tower and Other Great Buildings'' (1987) covers 75 famous buildings starting in 1869.&lt;/ref&gt;

The less-lavish middle-class apartment buildings provided gas lighting, elevators, good plumbing, central heating, and maintenance men on call.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Elizabeth|last = Blackmar|title =Manhattan for Rent, 1785-1850|date =1989 |publisher = Cornell University Press|isbn = 9780801420245}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Boston contractors build 16,000 "Triple-Deckers" Between 1870 and 1920. They were modern well-equipped buildings with a single large apartments on each floor. Chicago built thousands of apartment buildings, with the upscale ones close to the lake, where it was warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Harris, ''Chicago Apartments: A Century of Lakefront Luxury'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; In every city, apartment buildings were built along the paths of the street railways, for the middle-class tenants rode the streetcar to work, while the working class saved a nickel each way and walked.

The working class crowded into tenement houses, with far fewer features and amenities. They were cheap and easy to build, and filled up almost the entire lot. There were typically five story walk-ups, with four separate apartments on each floor. There was minimal air circulation and sunlight. Until the reforms of 1879, New York tenements lacked running water or indoor toilets. Garbage pickup was erratic until late in the 19th century. Rents were cheap for those who could endure the dust, clutter, smells and noises; the only cheaper alternatives were squalid basement rooms in older buildings.  Most of the tenements survived until the urban renewal movement of the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Plunz, ''A History of Housing in New York City: Dwelling Type and Social Change in the American Metropolis'' (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raymond A. Mohl, ''The New City: Urban America in the Industrial Age, 1860-1920'' (1985) pp 47-52&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lure of the metropolis===
Jeffersonian America distrusted the city, and rural spokesmen repeatedly warned their young men away.&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger, ''The rise of the city'' pp 53-77&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881 ''The Evening Wisconsin'' newspaper warned cautious boys to stay on the farm. As paraphrased by historian Bayrd Still, the editor painted a grim contrast:
:Pure milk, wholesome water, mellow fruit, vegetables, and proper sleep and exercise are lacking in the city; and the "dense centers of population are unfavorable to moral growth as they are to  physical development." Sharpness and deception characterize the city merchant, mechanic, and professional man as well. How different is the situation of the "sturdy farmer removed from the dust and smoke and filth and vice of the crowded city....Content in his cottage...why should he long for the fare and follies of the madding crowd in the Gay Metropolis?"
The response came from a Milwaukee newspaper editor in 1871, who boasted that the ambitious young man could not be stopped: 
: The young man in the country no sooner elects for himself his course, than he makes for the nearest town. Scarcely has he grown familiar with his new surroundings, when the subtle attractions of the remoter city begin to tell upon him. There is no resisting it. It draws him like a magnet. Sooner or later, it is tolerably certain, he will be sucked into one of the great centers of life.&lt;ref&gt;Bayrd Still, "Milwaukee, 1870-1900: The Emergence of a Metropolis," ''Wisconsin Magazine of History'' (1939) 23#2 pp. 138-162 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4631304 in JSTOR] , quotes at pp 143, and 139&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reformers===
Historians have developed an elaborate typology of reformers in the late 19th century, focusing especially on the urban reformers.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond A Mohl, ''The New City: Urban America in the Industrial Age, 1860-1920'' (1985) pp 108-37, 218-220&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mugwumps]] Were reform-minded Republicans who acted at the national level in the 1870s and 1880s, especially in 1884 when they split their ticket for Democrat Grover Cleveland.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald W. McFarland, "The New York mugwumps of 1884: A profile." ''Political Science Quarterly'' (1963): 40-58 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2146666 in JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt;  The "Goo Goos" were the local equivalent:  the middle-class reformers who sought "good government" regardless of party.  They typically focused on urban sanitation, better schools, and lower trolley fares for the middle-class commuters. They especially demanded a nonpolitical civil service system to replace the "spoils of victory" approach by which the winners of an election replaced city and school employees. They often formed short-lived citywide organizations, such as The Committee of 70 in New York, the Citizens' Reform Association in Philadelphia, the Citizens' Association of Chicago, and the Baltimore Reform League. They sometimes won citywide elections, but were rarely reelected. Party regulars laughed at them for trying to be independent of the political party machines by forming nonpartisan tickets. The ridicule included suggestions that the reformers were not real men: they were sissies and "mollycoddles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kevin P. Murphy|title=Political Manhood: Red Bloods, Mollycoddles, and the Politics of Progressive Era Reform|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-KZ_tnz6j2EC&amp;pg=PA64|year=2013|publisher=Columbia UP|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1890s, when historians call "structural reformers" were emerging; they were much more successful at reform, and marked the beginning of the [[Progressive era]]. They used national organizations, such as the [[National Municipal League]], and focused on broader principles such as honesty, efficiency, economy, and centralized decision-making by experts.  "Efficiency" was their watchword, they believed one of the problems with the machines was that they wasted enormous amounts of tax money by creating useless patronage jobs and payoffs to mid-level politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Martin J. Schiesl, ''The politics of efficiency: Municipal administration and reform in America, 1880-1920'' (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

Social reformers emerged in the 1890s, most famously [[Jane Addams]] Enter large complex network of reformers based at [[Hull House]] in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Kish Sklar, "Hull House in the 1890s: A community of women reformers." ''Signs'' (1985): 658-677 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3174308 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; They were less interested in civil service reform or revising the city charter, and concentrated instead on the needs of working class housing, child labor, sanitation and welfare. Protestant churches promoted their own group of reformers, mostly women activists demanding prohibition  or sharp reductions in the baleful influence of the saloon in damaging family finances and causing family violence.  Rural America was increasingly won over by the prohibitionists, but they rarely had success in the larger cities, where they were staunchly opposed by the large German and Irish elements.&lt;ref&gt;Mohl, ''The New City'' pp 115-33&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]] became well organized in cities of every size, and taught middle-class women the techniques of organization, proselytizing, and propaganda. Many of the WCTU veterans graduated into the woman's suffrage movement. Moving relentlessly from West to East, became the vote for women in state after state, and finally nationwide in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Bordin, ''Woman and Temperance: The quest for power and liberty, 1873-1900'' (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth S. Clemens, "Organizational repertoires and institutional change: Women's groups and the transformation of US politics, 1890-1920." ''American journal of sociology'' (1993): 755-798. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2781235 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

School reform was high on the agenda, since local machine politicians used the jobs in the contracts, promote the party interest, rather than the needs of the students. After examining late 19th century reform movements in New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis, San Francisco and Chicago, historian [[David Tyack]] concludes that "what the structural reformers wanted to do, then, was to replace a rather mechanical form of public bureaucracy, which was permeated with 'illegitimate' lay influence, with a streamlined 'professional' bureaucracy in which lay control was carefully filtered through a corporate school board.&lt;ref&gt;David B. Tyack, ''The one best system: A history of American urban education'' (1974) p 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sanitation and public health ===
{{further|History of water supply and sanitation}}
Sanitary conditions were bad throughout urban America in the 19th century. The worst conditions appeared in the largest cities, where the accumulation of human and horse waste built up on the city streets, where sewage systems were inadequate, and the water supply was of dubious quality.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Galishoff, ''Newark: the nation's unhealthiest city, 1832-1895'' (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;  Physicians took the lead in pointing out problems, and were of two minds on the causes. The older theory of contagion said that germs spread disease, but this theory was increasingly out of fashion by the 1840s or 1850s for two reasons. On the one hand it predicted too much-- microscopes demonstrated so many various microorganisms that there was no particular reason to associate any one of them with a specific disease. There was also a political dimension; a contagious theory of disease called for aggressive public health measures, which meant taxes and regulation the business community rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Neville Bonner, ''Medicine in Chicago: 1850-1950: A chapter in the social and scientific development of a city'' (1957) pp 24-39&lt;/ref&gt;  Before the 1880s, most experts believed in the "[[Miasma theory]]" which attributed the spread of disease to "bad air" caused by the abundance of dirt and animal waste. It indicated the need for regular garbage pickup.  By the 1880s, however, European discovery of the germ theory of disease proved decisive for the medical community, although popular belief never shook the old "bad air" theory.  Medical attention shifted from curing the sick patient to stopping the spread of the disease in the first place.  It indicated a system of quarantines, hospitalization, clean water, and proper sewage disposal.&lt;ref&gt;Martin V. Melosi, ''The Sanitary City: Urban Infrastructure in America from Colonial Times to the Present'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr [[Charles V. Chapin]] (1856-1941), head of public health in Providence Rhode Island, was a tireless campaigner for the germ theory of disease, which he repeatedly validated with his laboratory studies.  Chapin  emphatically told popular audiences germs were the true culprit, not  filth; that diseases were not indiscriminately transmitted through the smelly air; and that disinfection was not a cure-all.  He paid little attention to environmental or chemical hazards in the air and water, or to tobacco smoking, since germs were not involved. They did not become a major concern of the public health movement until the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;James H. Cassedy, ''Charles V. Chapin and the Public Health Movement'' (1962).&lt;/ref&gt;  The second stage of public health, building on the germ theory, brought in engineers to design elaborate water and sewer systems. Their expertise was welcomed, and many became city managers after that reform was introduced in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley K. Schultz, and Clay McShane. "To engineer the metropolis: sewers, sanitation, and city planning in late-nineteenth-century America." ''Journal of American History'' (1978): 389-411.

== 20th century==
In the era 1890-1930, the larger cities were the focus of national attention. The skyscrapers and tourist attractions were widely publicized. Suburbs existed, but they Were largely bedroom communities for commuters to the central city. San Francisco dominated the West, Atlanta dominated the South, Boston dominated New England. Chicago, the nation's railroad hub, dominated the Midwest,  New York City dominated the entire nation in terms of communications, trade, finance, as well as popular culture and high culture. More than a fourth of the 300 largest corporations in 1920 were headquartered in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;David R. Goldfield and Blaine A. Brownell, ''Urban America: A History''(2nd ed. 1990), p 299&lt;/ref&gt;

===Progressive era: 1890s–1920s===
During the [[Progressive Era]] a coalition of middle-class reform-oriented voters, academic experts and reformers hostile to the political machines introduced a series of reforms in urban America, designed to reduce waste and inefficiency and corruption, by introducing scientific methods, compulsory education and administrative innovations.

The pace was set in Detroit Michigan, where Republican mayor [[Hazen S. Pingree]] first put together the reform coalition.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin G. Holli, ''Reform in Detroit: Hazen S. Pingree and Urban Politics'' (1969).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many cities set up municipal reference bureaus to study the budgets and administrative structures of local governments. Progressive mayors were important in many cities,&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Finegold, "Traditional Reform, Municipal Populism, and Progressivism," ''Urban Affairs Review'', (1995) 31#1 pp 20–42&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Cleveland, Ohio]] (especially Mayor [[Tom L. Johnson|Tom Johnson]]); [[Toledo, Ohio]];&lt;ref&gt;Arthur E. DeMatteo, "The Progressive As Elitist: 'Golden Rule' Jones And The Toledo Charter Reform Campaign of 1901," ''Northwest Ohio Quarterly'', (1997) 69#1 pp 8–30&lt;/ref&gt; Jersey City, New Jersey;&lt;ref&gt;Eugene M. Tobin, "The Progressive as Single Taxer: Mark Fagan and the Jersey City Experience, 1900–1917," ''American Journal of Economics &amp; Sociology'', (1974) 33#3  pp 287–298&lt;/ref&gt; [[Los Angeles]];&lt;ref&gt;Martin J. Schiesl, "Progressive Reform in Los Angeles under Mayor Alexander, 1909–1913," ''California Historical Quarterly,'' (1975) 534#1, pp:37–56&lt;/ref&gt; [[Memphis, Tennessee]];&lt;ref&gt;G. Wayne Dowdy, "'A Business Government by a Business Man': E. H. Crump as a Progressive Mayor, 1910–1915," ''Tennessee Historical Quarterly,'' (2001) 60#3 3, pp 162–175&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louisville, Kentucky]];&lt;ref&gt;William E. Ellis, "Robert Worth Bingham and Louisville Progressivism, 1905–1910," ''Filson Club History Quarterly'', (1980) 54#2 pp 169–195&lt;/ref&gt; and many other cities, especially in the western states. In [[History of Illinois|Illinois]], Governor [[Frank Lowden]] undertook a major reorganization of state government.&lt;ref&gt;William Thomas Hutchinson, ''Lowden of Illinois: the life of Frank O. Lowden'' (1957) vol 2&lt;/ref&gt; Wisconsin was the stronghold of [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.|Robert La Follette]], who led a wing of the Republican Party. His [[Wisconsin Idea]] used the state university as a major source of ideas and expertise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Progressivism and the Wisconsin Idea|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/turningpoints/tp-036/?action=more_essay|publisher=[[Wisconsin Historical Society]]|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most dramatic changes came in [[Galveston, Texas]] were a devastating hurricane and flood overwhelmed the resources of local government. Reformers abolished political parties in municipal elections, and set up a five-man commission of experts to rebuild the city. The Galveston idea was simple, efficient, and much less conducive to corruption. If lessened the Democratic influences of the average voter, but multiplied the influence of the reform minded middle-class.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley R. Rice, "The Galveston Plan of City Government by Commission: The Birth of a Progressive Idea." ''Southwestern Historical Quarterly'' (1975): 365–408.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Galveston plan was quickly copied by many other cities, especially in the West.  By 1914 over 400 cities had nonpartisan elected commissions.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley R. Rice, ''Progressive Cities: The Commission Government Movement in America, 1901–1920'' (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dayton, Ohio]] Had its great flood in 1913, and responded with the innovation of a paid, non-political [[city manager]], hired by the commissioners to run the bureaucracy; mechanical engineers were especially preferred.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Couperus,  "The managerial revolution in local government: municipal management and the city manager in the USA and the Netherlands 1900–1940." ''Management &amp; Organizational History'' (2014) 9#4 pp: 336–352.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard J. Stillman, ''The Rise of the City Manager: A Public Professional in Local Government'' (U of New Mexico Press, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Urban planning===
{{main|History of urban planning}}
The [[Garden city movement]] was brought over from England and evolved into the "Neighborhood Unit" form of development. In the early 1900s, as cars were introduced to city streets for the first time, residents became increasingly concerned with the number of pedestrians being injured by car traffic. The response, seen first in Radburn, New Jersey, was the Neighborhood Unit-style development, which oriented houses toward a common public path instead of the street. The neighborhood is distinctively organized around a school, with the intention of providing children a safe way to walk to school.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Ann Christensen, ''The American garden city and the new towns movement'' (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Schaffer, ''Garden Cities for America: The Radburn Experience'' (Temple University Press, 1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Great Depression ===
{{main|Great Depression in the United States}}
Urban America had enjoyed strong growth and steady prosperity in the 1920s .  Large-scale immigration had ended in 1914, and never fully resumed, so that ethnic communities have become stabilized and Americanized. Upward mobility was the norm, in every sector of the population supported the rapidly growing high school system.  After the stock market crash of October 1929, the nation's optimism suddenly turned negative, with both business investments and private consumption overwhelmed by a deepening pessimism that encouraged people to cut back and reduce their expectations. The economic damage to the cities was most serious in the collapse of 80 to 90 percent of the private sector construction industry.  Cities and states started expanding their own construction programs as early as 1930, and they became a central feature of the New Deal, but private construction did not fully recover until after 1945. Many landlords so their rental income drained away and many went bankrupt. After construction,  came the widespread downturn in heavy industry, especially manufacturing of durable goods such as automobiles, machinery, and refrigerators.  The impact of unemployment was higher in the manufacturing centers in the East and Midwest, and lower in the South and West, which had less manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;William H, Mullins, ''The Depression and the Urban West Coast, 1929-1933: Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, and Portland'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Huts and unemployed, West Houston and Mercer St., Manhattan (NYPL b13668355-482853).jpg|thumb|Huts and unemployed men in New York City, 1935.]]
One visible effect of the depression was the advent of [[Hooverville]]s, which were  ramshackle assemblages on vacant lots of cardboard boxes, tents, and small rickety wooden sheds built by homeless people. Residents lived in shacks and begged for food or went to soup kitchens. The term was coined by Charles Michelson, publicity chief of the Democratic National Committee, who referred sardonically to President [[Herbert Hoover]] whose policies he blamed for the depression.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Kaltenborn, ''It Seems Like Yesterday'' (1956) p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

Unemployment reached 25 percent in the worst days of 1932-33, but it was unevenly distributed.  Job losses were  less severe among women than men, among workers in nondurable industries (such as food and clothing), in services and sales, and in government jobs.  The least skilled inner city men had much higher unemployment rates, as did young people who had a hard time getting their first job, and men over the age of 45 who if they lost their job would seldom find another one because employers had their choice of younger men. Millions were hired in the Great Depression, but men with weaker credentials were never hired, and fell into a long-term unemployment trap. The migration that brought millions of farmers and townspeople to the bigger cities in the 1920s suddenly reversed itself, as unemployment made the cities unattractive, and the network of kinfolk and more ample food supplies made it wise for many to go back.&lt;ref&gt;Richard J. Jensen, "The causes and cures of unemployment in the Great Depression." ''Journal of Interdisciplinary History'' (1989): 553-583  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/203954  in JSTOR] ; [http://tigger.uic.edu/~rjensen/causes-cures.pdf online copy]&lt;/ref&gt;  City governments in 1930-31 tried to meet the depression by expanding public works projects, as president Herbert Hoover strongly encouraged. However tax revenues were plunging, and the cities as well as private relief agencies were totally overwhelmed by 1931 men were unable to provide significant additional relief.  They fell back on the cheapest possible relief, soup kitchens which provided free meals for anyone who showed up.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Poppendieck, ''Breadlines knee-deep in wheat: Food assistance in the Great Depression'' (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; After 1933 new sales taxes and infusions of federal money helped relieve the fiscal distress of the cities, but the budgets did not fully recover until 1941.

The federal programs launched by Hoover and greatly expanded by president Roosevelt’s [[New Deal]] used massive construction projects to try to jump start the economy and solve the unemployment crisis.  The alphabet agencies ERA, CCC, FERA, WPA and PWA built and repaired the public infrastructure in dramatic fashion, but did little to foster the recovery of the private sector.  FERA, CCC and especially WPA focused on providing unskilled jobs for long-term unemployed men.

The Democrats won easy landslides in 1932 and 1934, and an even bigger one in 1936; the hapless Republican Party seemed doomed.  The Democrats capitalized on the magnetic appeal of Roosevelt to urban America. The key groups were low skilled ethnics, especially Catholics, Jews, and blacks. The Democrats promised and delivered in terms of beer, political recognition, labor union membership, and relief jobs.  The city machines were stronger than ever, for they mobilize their precinct workers to help families who needed help the most navigate the bureaucracy and get on relief.  FDR won the vote of practically every group in 1936, including  taxpayers, small business and the middle class. However the Protestant middle class voters but turned sharply against him after the recession of 1937-38 undermined repeated promises that recovery was at hand. Historically, local political machines were primarily interested in controlling their wards and citywide elections; the smaller the turnout on election day, the easier it was to control the system.  However, for Roosevelt to win the presidency in 1936 and 1940, he needed to carry the electoral college and that meant he needed the largest possible majorities in the cities to overwhelm the out state vote.  The machines came through for him.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Biles, ''Big City Boss in Depression and War: Mayor Edward J. Kelly of Chicago'' (1984).&lt;/ref&gt;  The 3.5 million voters on relief payrolls during the 1936 election cast 82% percent of their ballots for Roosevelt. The rapidly growing, energetic labor unions, chiefly based in the cities, turned out 80% for FDR, as did Irish, Italian and Jewish communities. In all, the nation's 106 cities over 100,000 population voted 70% for FDR in 1936, compared to his 59% elsewhere.  Roosevelt worked very well with the big city machines, with the one exception of his old nemesis, [[Tammany Hall]] in Manhattan. There he [[History of New York City (1898–1945)#Politics|supported the complicated coalition]] built around the nominal Republican [[Fiorello La Guardia]],  and based on Jewish and Italian voters mobilized by labor unions.&lt;ref&gt;Mason B. Williams, ''City of Ambition: FDR, LaGuardia, and the Making of Modern New York'' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, the Republicans made an unexpected comeback, and Roosevelt’s efforts to purge the Democratic Party of his political opponents backfired badly. The conservative coalition of Northern Republicans and Southern Democrats took control of Congress, outvoted the urban liberals, and handed the expansion of New Deal ideas.  Roosevelt survived in 1940 thanks to his margin in the Solid South and in the cities.  In the North the cities over 100,000 gave Roosevelt 60% of their votes, while the rest of the North favored the GOP candidate Wendell Willkie 52%-48%.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Jensen, "The cities reelect Roosevelt: Ethnicity, religion, and class in 1940." ''Ethnicity. An Interdisciplinary Journal of the Study of Ethnic Relations'' (1981) 8#2: 189-195.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the start of full-scale war mobilization in the summer of 1940, the economies of the cities rebounded.  Even before Pearl Harbor, Washington pumped massive investments into new factories and funded round-the-clock  munitions production, guaranteeing a job to anyone who showed up at the factory gate.&lt;ref&gt;Jon C. Teaford, ''The twentieth-century American city'' (1986) pp 90-96.&lt;/ref&gt;  The war brought a restoration of prosperity and hopeful expectations for the future across the nation. It had the greatest impact on the cities of the West Coast, especially Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Portland and Seattle.&lt;ref&gt;Roger W. Lotchin, ''The Bad City in the Good War: San Francisco, Los Angeles, Oakland, and San Diego'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic historians led by Price Fishback have examined the impact of New Deal spending on improving health conditions in the 114 largest cities, 1929-1937.  They estimated that every additional $153,000 in relief spending  (in 1935 dollars, or $1.95 million in year 2000 dollars) was associated with a reduction of one infant death, one suicide, and 2.4 deaths from infectious disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Whaples and Randall E.

{{Orphan|date=October 2017}}

'''''L'Angelo Nocchiero''''' ('''''The Angel-Helmsman''''') is a marble sculpture in the '[[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist]]' style by the Genovese sculptor [[:it:Giovanni Scanzi|Giovanni Scanzi]] (1840-1915), completed in 1886. It was commissioned by [[Commons:Category:Tomba Giacomo Carpaneto (Cimitero di Staglieno)|Giacomo Carpaneto]], Cav. Mauriziano (1811-1878) as a monument for his family tomb in the [[:it:Cimitero monumentale di Staglieno|Cimitero monumentale di Staglieno]] ([[Monumental Cemetery of Staglieno]]), in [[Genoa|Genova, Italy]].
Along with the sculpture for the [[Monteverde Angel|Oneto Family]] sculpted by Giulio Monteverde in 1882,&lt;ref&gt;Berenco Gardin, Gianni, and Nesso Parlato, Gabriella (1993). 
''Il Giardino del Tempo''. [Roma:] Peliti Associati, dust-jacket cover and pp.7-8&lt;/ref&gt; the Carpaneto monument has become one of the most recognisable icons of Staglieno,
appearing on an official cemetery brochure in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Staglieno Cimitero Monumentale (2014). "Settimana dei Cimiteri Storici Europei", 23 maggio-1 giugno 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Angelo nocchiero staglieno 11 vintage.jpg|thumb|''Angelo Nocchiero'' (1886), Giovanni Scanzi, sculptor (early photograph, ca.1895)]]

==The artist, his patron, and his model==

Giovanni Scanzi was 38 years old when his patron Cav. Giacomo Carpaneto died and he began
work on the Carpaneto family tomb at Staglieno. Scanzi's early work was in the Realist style,
&lt;ref name=Sborgi&gt;Sborgi, Franco (1997). ''Staglieno e la Scultura Funeraria Ligure tra Ottocento e Novecento''.
Torino: Artema, p.147, ''et passim''&lt;/ref&gt;
and by this time he had also incorporated Symbolism
(or, perhaps more accurately, "l'iperdecorativismo eclettico"&lt;ref name=Sborgi /&gt;),
as seen in his sculptures of the
''Angelo della Resurrezione'' (Angel of Resurrection) on the  [[Commons:Category:Tomba_Carlo_di_G.B._Casella_(Cimitero_di_Staglieno)|Carlo di G.B. Casella family tomb]] (1877);
the later relief for the [[Commons:Category:Tomba_Elisa_Falcone_(Cimitero_di_Staglieno)|tomb of Elisa Falcone]] (1893); and other works at Staglieno.

Giacomo Carpaneto, Cav. Mauriziano (1811-1878) was a respected merchant,
part of a family originally from
Sampierdarena (S. Petri ad Arenaria) where the Palazzo Centurione-Carpaneto still
stands.&lt;ref name=Marchetti&gt;Marchetti, Rita Nello (2014). ''Caterina e l'Angelo: Il volto popolare e l'anima nobile del Cimitero di Staglieno''. Genova: Erga edizioni, pp.74-76,91-93&lt;/ref&gt;
Signora Carpaneto also is interred in the family tomb.

The model for the ''Angelo Nocchiero'' sculpture was Antonio Dellapiane (1868-1942).
After school, he worked as a shop-boy in a joiner's workshop in Sampierdarena, where Scanzi met him. Later, he started his own workshop, becoming a successful carpenter and wood carver.
&lt;ref name=Marchetti /&gt;

==Symbolism==
The sculpture depicts an angel, standing astride a small boat, beginning to secure the sails at the end of a journey. His garments are streaming behind him, suggesting a strong wind. The prow of the boat is the stoic face of a woman, and under the prow the water swirls. Ropes are coiled in minute detail inside the boat (even though the average cemetery visitor would not be able to see them), and at the back of the boat is an embroidered cushion, slightly dented from a head resting there until a moment earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dearmissfletcher.wordpress.com/2017/01/16/langelo-nocchiero-e-il-mare-della-vita/ |title=L'Angelo Nocchiero e il mare della vita |author=Miss Fletcher |date=16 January 2017}} dearmissfletcher.wordpress.com/, retrieved 25 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The boat would be a familiar symbol to anyone in 19th century Genova, a seaport town,
and the ''Angelo Nocchiero'' - ''Angel Helmsman'' - reminds the viewer of the spiritual
boatmen of ancient mythology, whose job it was to transport the departed into the afterlife.
The clear imagery of the Guiding Angel is underscored by the epigraph in bronze lettering
on the pedestal: "AVVENTURATO CHI NEL MARE DELLA VITA EBBE NOCCHIERO SÌ FIDO" - "Blessed
is he who on the sea of life had so sure a guide".&lt;ref&gt;(anonymous)(n.d.).

==History==
Many famous people of the 19th century visited Staglieno, including Friedrich Nietzsche,
Guy de Maupassant, and Mark Twain, who wrote about it in glowing terms in his ''Innocents Abroad'' (1868).
&lt;ref&gt;Association of Significant Cemeteries in Europe (ASCE). [http://www.significantcemeteries.org/2012/01/staglieno-cemetery-genova-italy.html "Staglieno Cemetery (Genoa, Italy)"] www.significantcemeteries.org/, retrieved 5 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
The visit in March 1893 of Empress Elisabeth of Austria, fondly known as 'Sissi', is legendary. Periodicals of the time reported that she arrived incognito as 'Lady Parker', and walked from the Principe to Staglieno, visiting a number of significant places along the way. When she came before Scanzi's ''Nocchiero'', she paused,&lt;ref&gt;Resasco, Ferdinando (1904). ''Staglieno Camposanto''. Milano: Menotti Bassanti &amp; C., pp.81-82&lt;/ref&gt; apparently moved, and after a period of contemplation, had the epigraph copied into her personal notebook.&lt;ref&gt;''Il Secolo XIX''
(12 March 1893) "L'Imperatrice visita
Genova: da Principe a Staglieno a piedi"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restoration==

[[File:Angelo nocchiero staglieno 00 during restoration angel with foam 1.jpg|thumb|''Angelo Nocchiero'' (1886), during the 2016 restoration process]]

Mark Twain &lt;ref&gt;Twain, Mark [Samuel Langhorne Clemens](1869). ''The Innocents Abroad, or The New Pilgrims' Progress''. Hartford, Connecticut: American Publishing Company, p.170&lt;/ref&gt; described the monuments at Staglieno as "exquisitely wrought . . . full of grace and beauty. They are new, and snowy; every outline is perfect." After a century and a half Twain's description would not be quite the same, as the dust, mildew and pollution of an industrial city have settled on the marble surfaces, thieves have removed valuable bronze and other materials, and vandals have broken or otherwise defaced some of the monuments. &lt;ref&gt;American Friends of Italian Monumental Sculpture [A.F.I.M.S.] (2017), "Carpaneto Memorial, 1886", https://staglieno.com/carpaneto-memorial-1886/, retrieved 30 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Astrophysical X-ray sources''' are [[astronomical objects]] with physical properties which result in the emission of [[X-rays]].

There are a number of types of astrophysical objects which emit X-rays, from [[galaxy cluster]]s, through [[black holes]] in [[active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]] (AGN) to galactic objects such as [[supernova remnant]]s, [[star]]s, and [[binary star]]s containing a [[white dwarf]] ([[cataclysmic variable star]]s and [[super soft X-ray source]]s), [[neutron star]] or black hole ([[X-ray binaries]]). Some [[solar system]] bodies emit X-rays, the most notable being the [[Moon]], although most of the X-ray brightness of the Moon arises from reflected solar X-rays. A combination of many unresolved X-ray sources is thought to produce the observed [[X-ray background]]. The X-ray continuum can arise from [[bremsstrahlung]], either magnetic or ordinary Coulomb, [[Thermal radiation|black-body radiation]], [[synchrotron radiation]], [[Compton scattering#Inverse Compton scattering|inverse Compton scattering]] of lower-energy photons by relativistic electrons, knock-on collisions of fast protons with atomic electrons, and atomic recombination, with or without additional electron transitions.&lt;ref name=Morrison&gt;{{cite journal |author=Morrison P |title=Extrasolar X-ray Sources |journal=Annu. Rev. Astron. Astrophys. |year=1967 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=325–50 |doi=10.1146/annurev.aa.05.090167.001545 |bibcode=1967ARA&amp;A...5..325M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, celestial entities in space are discussed as celestial X-ray sources. The origin of all observed [[astronomical X-ray sources]] is in, near to, or associated with a [[coronal cloud]] or gas at coronal cloud temperatures for however long or brief a period.

== Galaxy clusters ==
[[File:Bullet cluster.jpg|300px|thumb|X-ray photo by Chandra X-ray Observatory of the [[Bullet Cluster]]. Exposure time was 140 hours. The scale is shown in mega[[parsec]]s. [[Redshift]] (''z'') = 0.3, meaning its light has wavelengths stretched by a factor of 1.3.]]
{{Main|Galaxy groups and clusters}}
[[Galaxy groups and clusters#Clusters of galaxies|Clusters of galaxies]] are formed by the merger of smaller units of matter, such as galaxy groups or individual galaxies. The infalling material (which contains galaxies, gas and [[dark matter]]) gains [[kinetic energy]] as it falls into the cluster's gravitational [[potential well]]. The infalling gas collides with gas already in the cluster and is [[Shocks and Discontinuities (MHD)|shock]] heated to between 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; K depending on the size of the cluster. This very hot gas emits X-rays by thermal bremsstrahlung emission, and [[spectral line|line emission]] from metals (in astronomy, 'metals' often means all elements except [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]]). The galaxies and [[dark matter]] are collisionless and quickly become [[virial theorem|virialised]], orbiting in the cluster [[potential well]].

At a [[statistical significance]] of 8σ, it was found that the spatial offset of the center of the total mass from the center of the baryonic mass peaks cannot be explained with an alteration of the gravitational force law.&lt;ref name=Clowe&gt;{{cite journal |author= Clowe D |title = A Direct Empirical Proof of the Existence of Dark Matter |journal=Astrophys J |year=2006 |volume=648 |issue= 2 |pages = L109–L113 |doi = 10.1086/508162 |arxiv=astro-ph/0608407 |bibcode=2006ApJ...648L.109C|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

A '''quasi-stellar radio source''' ('''[[quasar]]''') is a very energetic and distant [[galaxy]] with an [[active galactic nucleus]] (AGN). QSO 0836+7107 is a '''Q'''uasi-'''S'''tellar '''O'''bject (QSO) that emits baffling amounts of radio energy. This radio emission is caused by electrons spiraling (thus accelerating) along magnetic fields producing [[Cyclotron radiation|cyclotron]] or [[Synchrotron radiation|synchrotron]] radiation. These electrons can also interact with visible light emitted by the disk around the AGN or the black hole at its center. These photons accelerate the electrons, which then emit X- and gamma-radiation via [[Compton scattering|Compton]] and [[Compton scattering#Inverse Compton scattering|inverse Compton]] scattering.

On board the [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]] (CGRO) is the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) which detects in the 20 [[keV]] to 8 [[MeV]] range. QSO 0836+7107 or 4C 71.07 was detected by BATSE as a source of soft gamma rays and hard X-rays. "What BATSE has discovered is that it can be a soft gamma-ray source", McCollough said. QSO 0836+7107 is the faintest and most distant object to be observed in soft gamma rays. It has already been observed in gamma rays by the [[Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope]] (EGRET) also aboard the [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]].&lt;ref name=Dooling&gt;{{cite web |author=Dooling D |title=BATSE finds most distant quasar yet seen in soft gamma rays Discovery will provide insight on formation of galaxies |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/1999/ast24nov99_1/}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

Black holes give off radiation because matter falling into them loses gravitational energy which may result in the emission of radiation before the matter falls into the [[event horizon]]. The infalling matter has [[angular momentum]], which means that the material cannot fall in directly, but spins around the black hole. This material often forms an [[accretion disk]]. Similar luminous accretion disks can also form around [[white dwarf]]s and neutron stars, but in these the infalling gas releases additional energy as it slams against the high-[[density]] surface with high speed. In case of a neutron star, the infall speed can be a sizeable fraction of the speed of light.{{clear}}
In some neutron star or white dwarf systems, the [[magnetic field]] of the star is strong enough to prevent the formation of an accretion disc. The material in the disc gets very hot because of friction, and emits X-rays. The material in the disc slowly loses its angular momentum and falls into the compact star. In neutron stars and white dwarfs, additional X-rays are generated when the material hits their surfaces. X-ray emission from black holes is variable, varying in [[luminosity]] in very short timescales. The variation in luminosity can provide information about the size of the black hole.

A [[Type Ia supernova]] is an explosion of a [[white dwarf]] in orbit around either another white dwarf or a [[red giant]] star. The dense white dwarf can accumulate gas donated from the companion. When the dwarf reaches the critical mass of {{Solar mass|1.4|link=y}}, a thermonuclear explosion ensues. As each Type Ia shines with a known luminosity, Type Ia are called "standard candles" and are used by astronomers to measure distances in the universe.

SN 2005ke is the first Type Ia supernova detected in X-ray wavelengths, and it is much brighter in the [[ultraviolet]] than expected.{{clear}}

{{Main|Sun}}
In the late 1930s, the presence of a very hot, tenuous gas surrounding the Sun was inferred indirectly from optical coronal lines of highly ionized species.&lt;ref name=Gudel /&gt; In the mid-1940s radio observations revealed a radio corona around the Sun.&lt;ref name=Gudel /&gt; After detecting X-ray photons from the Sun in the course of a rocket flight, T.

While neutron stars and black holes are the quintessential point sources of X-rays, all main sequence stars are likely to have hot enough coronae to emit X-rays.&lt;ref name=Gould&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gould RJ, Burbidge GR |title=High energy cosmic photons and neutrinos |journal=Annales d'Astrophysique|volume=28 |page=171|year=1965 |bibcode=1965AnAp...28..171G}}&lt;/ref&gt; A- or F-type stars have at most thin convection zones and thus produce little coronal activity.&lt;ref name=Knigge&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Knigge C, Gilliland RL, Dieball A, Zurek DR, Shara MM, Long KS |title=A blue straggler binary with three progenitors in the core of a globular cluster? |journal=Astrophys J|year=2006 |volume=641 |issue=1 |pages=281–287 |doi=10.1086/500311 |bibcode=2006ApJ...641..281K|arxiv = astro-ph/0511645 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar [[solar cycle]]-related variations are observed in the flux of solar X-ray and UV or EUV radiation. Rotation is one of the primary determinants of the magnetic dynamo, but this point could not be demonstrated by observing the Sun: the Sun's magnetic activity is in fact strongly modulated (due to the 11-year magnetic spot cycle), but this effect is not directly dependent on the rotation period.&lt;ref name=Gudel /&gt;

Solar flares usually follow the solar cycle. [[CORONAS-F]] was launched on July 31, 2001 to coincide with the 23rd solar cycle maximum.
The solar flare of October 29, 2003 apparently showed a significant degree of linear polarization (&gt; 70% in channels E2 = 40-60 keV and E3 = 60-100 keV, but only about 50% in E1 = 20-40 keV) in hard X-rays,&lt;ref name=Zhitnik&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zhitnik IA |author2=Logachev YI |author3=Bogomolov AV |author4=Denisov YI |author5=Kavanosyan SS |author6=Kuznetsov SN |author7=Morozov OV |author8=Myagkova IN |author9=Svertilov SI |author10=Ignat’ev AP |author11=Oparin SN |author12=Pertsov AA |author13=Tindo IP |title=Polarization, temporal, and spectral parameters of solar flare hard X-rays as measured by the SPR-N instrument onboard the CORONAS-F satellite |journal=Solar System Research|year=2006 |volume=40 |issue=2|page=93|doi=10.1134/S003809460602002X|bibcode = 2006SoSyR..40...93Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; but other observations have generally only set upper limits.

[[Coronal loop]]s form the basic structure of the lower [[corona]] and [[solar transition region|transition region]] of the Sun. These highly structured and elegant loops are a direct consequence of the twisted solar [[magnetic]] flux within the solar body. The population of coronal loops can be directly linked with the [[solar cycle]], it is for this reason coronal loops are often found with [[sunspots]] at their footpoints. Coronal loops populate both active and quiet regions of the solar surface.

=== White dwarfs ===
{{Main|White dwarf}}
When the core of a medium mass star contracts, it causes a release of energy that makes the envelope of the star expand. This continues until the star finally blows its outer layers off. The core of the star remains intact and becomes a [[white dwarf]]. The white dwarf is surrounded by an expanding shell of gas in an object known as a planetary nebula. [[Planetary nebulae]] seem to mark the transition of a medium mass star from [[red giant]] to white dwarf. X-ray images reveal clouds of multimillion degree gas that have been compressed and heated by the fast stellar wind. Eventually the central star collapses to form a white dwarf. For a billion or so years after a star collapses to form a white dwarf, it is "white" hot with surface temperatures of ~20,000 K.

X-ray emission has been detected from PG 1658+441, a hot, isolated, magnetic white dwarf, first detected in an [[Einstein Observatory|Einstein]] IPC observation and later identified in an [[Exosat]] channel multiplier array observation.&lt;ref name=Pravdo&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pravdo SH, Marshall FE, White NE, Giommi P |title=X-rays from the magnetic white dwarf PG 1658 + 441 |journal=Astrophys J|year=1986 |volume=300|page=819|doi=10.1086/163859 |bibcode=1986ApJ...300..819P}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The broad-band spectrum of this DA white dwarf can be explained as emission from a homogeneous, high-gravity, pure hydrogen atmosphere with a temperature near 28,000 K."&lt;ref name=Pravdo /&gt; These observations of PG 1658+441 support a correlation between temperature and helium abundance in white dwarf atmospheres.&lt;ref name=Pravdo /&gt;

A [[super soft X-ray source]] (SSXS) radiates soft X-rays in the range of 0.09 to 2.5 [[keV]]. Super soft X-rays are believed to be produced by steady [[nuclear fusion]] on a white dwarf's surface of material pulled from a [[binary star|binary companion]].&lt;ref name=maxplanck&gt;{{cite web |title=Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics: Super Soft X-ray Sources – Discovered with ROSAT |url=http://www.mpe.mpg.de/~jcg/sss/sss_high.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This requires a flow of material sufficiently high to sustain the fusion.

Real mass transfer variations may be occurring in V Sge similar to SSXS RX J0513.9-6951 as revealed by analysis of the activity of the SSXS V Sge where episodes of long low states occur in a cycle of ~400 days.&lt;ref name=Simon&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Simon V, Mattei JA |title=Activity of the super-soft X-ray source V Sge |journal=AIP Conf Proc|year=2002 |volume=637|page=333|doi=10.1063/1.1518226 |bibcode=2002AIPC..637..333S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RX J0648.0-4418 is an X-ray pulsator in the [[Crab nebula]]. HD 49798 is a subdwarf star that forms a binary system with RX J0648.0-4418. The subdwarf star is a bright object in the optical and UV bands. The orbital period of the system is accurately known. Recent [[XMM-Newton]] observations timed to coincide with the expected eclipse of the X-ray source allowed an accurate determination of the mass of the X-ray source (at least 1.2 solar masses), establishing the X-ray source as a rare, ultra-massive white dwarf.&lt;ref name=Mereghetti&gt;{{cite web |title=XMM-Newton weighs up a rare white dwarf and finds it to be a heavyweight |year=2009|url=http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=45453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brown dwarfs ===
{{Main|Brown dwarf}}
According to theory, an object that has a mass of less than about 8% of the mass of the Sun cannot sustain significant [[nuclear fusion]] in its core.&lt;ref name=browndwarf&gt;{{cite web |title=Brown Dwarfs |url=http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_sources/browndwarf_fg.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This marks the dividing line between [[red dwarf]] stars and [[brown dwarf]]s. The dividing line between [[planet]]s and brown dwarfs occurs with objects that have masses below about 1% of the mass of the Sun, or 10 times the mass of [[Jupiter]]. These objects cannot fuse deuterium.
[[File:Lp94420 duo m.jpg|thumb|300px|Chandra image of LP 944-20 before flare and during flare.]]

==== LP 944-20 ====
With no strong central nuclear energy source, the interior of a brown dwarf is in a rapid boiling, or convective state. When combined with the rapid rotation that most brown dwarfs exhibit, [[convection]] sets up conditions for the development of a strong, tangled magnetic field near the surface. The flare observed by [[Chandra X-ray Observatory|Chandra]] from LP 944-20 could have its origin in the turbulent magnetized hot material beneath the brown dwarf's surface. A sub-surface flare could conduct heat to the atmosphere, allowing electric currents to flow and produce an X-ray flare, like a stroke of [[lightning]]. The absence of X-rays from LP 944-20 during the non flaring period is also a significant result. It sets the lowest observational limit on steady X-ray power produced by a brown dwarf star, and shows that coronas cease to exist as the surface temperature of a brown dwarf cools below about 2500&amp;nbsp;°C and becomes electrically neutral.{{clear}}
[[File:Chandra X-ray Observatory image of the brown dwarf TWA 5B.jpg|189px|right|Chandra observation of TWA 5B.]]

Electric potentials of about 10 million volts, and currents of 10 million amps&amp;nbsp;– a hundred times greater than the most powerful lightning bolts&amp;nbsp;– are required to explain the auroras at Jupiter's poles, which are a thousand times more powerful than those on Earth.

On Earth, auroras are triggered by solar storms of energetic particles, which disturb Earth's magnetic field. As shown by the swept-back appearance in the illustration, gusts of particles from the Sun also distort Jupiter's magnetic field, and on occasion produce auroras.

Saturn's X-ray spectrum is similar to that of X-rays from the Sun indicating that Saturn's X-radiation is due to the reflection of solar X-rays by Saturn's atmosphere. The optical image is much brighter, and shows the beautiful ring structures, which were not detected in X-rays.{{clear}}

== X-ray fluorescence ==
Some of the detected X-rays, originating from solar system bodies other than the Sun, are produced by [[fluorescence]]. Scattered solar X-rays provide an additional component.

In the Röntgensatellit (ROSAT) image of the Moon, pixel brightness corresponds to X-ray intensity. The bright lunar hemisphere shines in X-rays because it re-emits X-rays originating from the sun. The background sky has an X-ray glow in part due to the myriad of distant, powerful active galaxies, unresolved in the ROSAT picture. The dark side of the Moon's disk shadows this X-ray background radiation coming from the deep space. A few X-rays only seem to come from the shadowed lunar hemisphere. Instead, they originate in Earth's geocorona or extended atmosphere which surrounds the orbiting X-ray observatory. The measured lunar X-ray luminosity of ~1.2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; W makes the Moon one of the weakest known non-terrestrial X-ray source.

NASA's [[Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission]] satellite was monitoring [[Comet Lulin]] as it closed to 63 Gm of Earth. For the first time, astronomers can see simultaneous UV and X-ray images of a comet. "The solar wind -- a fast-moving stream of particles from the sun -- interacts with the comet's broader cloud of atoms. This causes the solar wind to light up with X-rays, and that's what Swift's XRT sees", said Stefan Immler, of the Goddard Space Flight Center. This interaction, called charge exchange, results in X-rays from most comets when they pass within about three times Earth's distance from the sun. Because Lulin is so active, its atomic cloud is especially dense. As a result, the X-ray-emitting region extends far sunward of the comet.&lt;ref name=Reddy&gt;{{cite web |author=Reddy F |title=NASA's Swift Spies Comet Lulin |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/swift/bursts/lulin.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

== Celestial X-ray sources ==
The [[celestial sphere]] has been divided into 88 constellations. The [[IAU]] constellations are areas of the sky. Each of these contains remarkable X-ray sources. Some of them are [[galaxies]] or [[black hole]]s at the centers of galaxies. Some are [[pulsar]]s.

Red is infrared data from the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]], orange is visible data from the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], and blue and green are data from the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]].]]
Regarding [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopea A]] [[Supernova remnant|SNR]], it is believed that first light from the stellar explosion reached Earth approximately 300 years ago but there are no historical records of any sightings of the progenitor supernova, probably due to [[interstellar dust]] absorbing optical wavelength radiation before it reached Earth (although it is possible that it was recorded as a sixth magnitude star [[3 Cassiopeiae]] by [[John Flamsteed]] on August 16, 1680&lt;ref name=Hughes&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hughes DW |title=Did Flamsteed see the Cassiopeia A supernova? |journal=Nature |volume=285|year=1980 |issue=5761 |page=132|doi=10.1038/285132a0|bibcode = 1980Natur.285..132H }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Possible explanations lean toward the idea that the source star was unusually massive and had previously ejected much of its outer layers. These outer layers would have cloaked the star and reabsorbed much of the light released as the inner star collapsed.

CTA 1 is another SNR X-ray source in [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]]. A pulsar in the CTA 1 [[supernova]] remnant (4U 0000+72) initially emitted radiation in the X-ray bands (1970–1977). Strangely, when it was observed at a later time (2008) X-ray radiation was not detected. Instead, the [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope]] detected the pulsar was emitting gamma ray radiation, the first of its kind.&lt;ref name=Atkinson&gt;{{cite web |author=Atkinson N |url=http://www.universetoday.com/2008/10/17/fermi-telescope-makes-first-big-discovery-gamma-ray-pulsar/ |title=Universe Today – Fermi Telescope Makes First Big Discovery: Gamma Ray Pulsar |date=October 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

Three structures around [[Eta Carinae]] are thought to represent shock waves produced by matter rushing away from the superstar at supersonic speeds. The temperature of the shock-heated gas ranges from 60 MK in the central regions to 3 MK on the horseshoe-shaped outer structure.

Here the filament absorbs soft X-rays between 100 and 300 eV, indicating that the hot gas is located behind the filament. This filament may be part of a shell of neutral gas that surrounds the hot bubble. Its interior is energized by UV light and stellar winds from hot stars in the Orion OB1 association. These stars energize a superbubble about 1200 lys across which is observed in the optical (Hα) and X-ray portions of the spectrum.]]
Within the constellations Orion and Eridanus and stretching across them is a soft X-ray "hot spot" known as the '''[[Orion-Eridanus Superbubble]]''', the '''Eridanus Soft X-ray Enhancement''', or simply the '''Eridanus Bubble''', a 25° area of interlocking arcs of Hα emitting filaments.{{clear}}

Four of the five galaxies in Stephan's Quintet form a physical association, and are involved in a cosmic dance that most likely will end with the galaxies merging.

The entire line has been shifted to longer wavelengths (left, red) because of the neutron star's powerful gravity. The line is brighter toward shorter wavelengths (right, blue) because Einstein's special theory of relativity predicts that a high-speed source beamed toward Earth will appear brighter than the same source moving away from Earth.]]
{{See also|Serpens}}
As of August 27, 2007, discoveries concerning asymmetric iron line broadening and their implications for relativity have been a topic of much excitement. With respect to the asymmetric iron line broadening, Edward Cackett of the [[University of Michigan]] commented, "We're seeing the gas whipping around just outside the neutron star's surface,". "And since the inner part of the disk obviously can't orbit any closer than the neutron star's surface, these measurements give us a maximum size of the neutron star's diameter. The neutron stars can be no larger than 18 to 20.5 miles across, results that agree with other types of measurements."&lt;ref name=Cackett&gt;{{cite web |vauthors=Gibb M, Bhattacharyya S, Strohmayer T, Cackett E, Miller J |title=Astronomers Pioneer New Method for Probing Exotic Matter |url=http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/features/news/27aug07.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"We've seen these asymmetric lines from many black holes, but this is the first confirmation that neutron stars can produce them as well. It shows that the way neutron stars accrete matter is not very different from that of black holes, and it gives us a new tool to probe Einstein's theory", says Tod Strohmayer of [[NASA]]'s [[Goddard Space Flight Center]].&lt;ref name=Cackett /&gt;

"This is fundamental physics", says Sudip Bhattacharyya also of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in [[Greenbelt, Maryland]] and the [[University of Maryland]]. "There could be exotic kinds of particles or states of matter, such as quark matter, in the centers of neutron stars, but it's impossible to create them in the lab. The only way to find out is to understand neutron stars."&lt;ref name=Cackett /&gt;

Using [[XMM-Newton]], Bhattacharyya and Strohmayer observed Serpens X-1, which contains a neutron star and a stellar companion. Cackett and Jon Miller of the [[University of Michigan]], along with Bhattacharyya and Strohmayer, used [[Suzaku (satellite)|Suzaku]]'s superb spectral capabilities to survey Serpens X-1.

== Exotic X-ray sources ==

=== Microquasar ===
A [[microquasar]] is a smaller cousin of a [[quasar]] that is a radio emitting [[X-ray binary]], with an often resolvable pair of radio jets. [[SS 433]] is one of the most exotic [[star system]]s observed. It is an [[eclipsing binary]] with the primary either a black hole or neutron star and the secondary is a late [[A-type star]]. SS 433 lies within [[Supernova remnant|SNR]] [[W50 (nebula)|W50]]. The material in the jet traveling from the secondary to the primary does so at 26% of light speed. The spectrum of SS 433 is affected by [[Doppler shift]]s and by [[special relativity|relativity]]: when the effects of the Doppler shift are subtracted, there is a residual redshift which corresponds to a velocity of about 12,000 kps. This does not represent an actual velocity of the system away from the Earth; rather, it is due to [[time dilation]], which makes moving clocks appear to stationary observers to be ticking more slowly. In this case, the relativistically moving excited atoms in the jets appear to vibrate more slowly and their radiation thus appears red-shifted.&lt;ref name=Margon&gt;{{cite journal |author=Margon B |title=Observations of SS 433|journal=Annu.

=== Supergiant fast X-ray transients (SFXTs) ===
There are a growing number of recurrent [[X-ray transient]]s, characterized by short outbursts with very fast rise times (tens of minutes) and typical durations of a few hours that are associated with OB [[supergiant]]s and hence define a new class of massive X-ray binaries: Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs).&lt;ref name=Negueruela&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Negueruela |first1=I. |last2=Smith |first2=D.

=== Messier 87 ===
[[File:M87 jet.jpg|300px|thumb|A 5,000 [[Light-year|ly]] jet of matter ejected from M87 at near [[Speed of light|lightspeed]].]]
Observations made by [[Chandra X-ray Observatory|Chandra]] indicate the presence of loops and rings in the hot X-ray emitting gas that surrounds [[Messier 87]]. These loops and rings are generated by variations in the rate at which material is ejected from the [[supermassive black hole]] in jets. The distribution of loops suggests that minor eruptions occur every six million years.

One of the rings, caused by a major eruption, is a shock wave 85,000 light-years in diameter around the black hole. Other remarkable features observed include narrow X-ray emitting filaments up to 100,000 light-years long, and a large cavity in the hot gas caused by a major eruption 70 million years ago.

The galaxy also contains a notable [[active galactic nucleus]] (AGN) that is a strong source of multiwavelength radiation, particularly [[radio wave]]s.&lt;ref name=Baade&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baade W, Minkowski R |title=On the Identification of Radio Sources |journal=Astrophys J |year=1954 |volume=119 |page=215|doi=10.1086/145813 |bibcode=1954ApJ...119..215B}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

=== Magnetars ===

A '''[[magnetar]]''' is a type of neutron star with an extremely powerful magnetic field, the decay of which powers the emission of copious amounts of high-energy [[electromagnetic radiation]], particularly X-rays and [[gamma ray]]s. The theory regarding these objects was proposed by [[Robert C. Duncan (astrophysicist)|Robert Duncan]] and Christopher Thompson in 1992, but the first recorded burst of gamma rays thought to have been from a magnetar was on March 5, 1979.&lt;ref name=Kouveliotou&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kouveliotou C, Duncan RC, Thompson C |year=2003 |journal=Sci Am |url=http://solomon.as.utexas.edu/~duncan/sciam.pdf |title=Magnetars |pages=34–41 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611144829/http://solomon.as.utexas.edu/~duncan/sciam.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These magnetic fields are hundreds of thousands of times stronger than any man-made magnet,&lt;ref name=Dreasen&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fzd.de/db/Cms?pNid=1482 |title=HLD user program, at Dresden High Magnetic Field Laboratory |accessdate = 2009-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and quadrillions of times more powerful than [[Earth's magnetic field|the field surrounding Earth]].&lt;ref name=Naye&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news/3310066.html?page=1&amp;c=y |title=The Brightest Blast |author=Naye R |accessdate=17 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2003, they are the most magnetic objects ever detected in the universe.&lt;ref name=Kouveliotou /&gt;

On March 5, 1979, after dropping probes into the atmosphere of [[Venus]], [[Venera 11]] and [[Venera 12]], while in heliocentric orbits, were hit at 10:51 am EST by a blast of gamma ray radiation. This contact raised the radiation readings on both the probes Konus experiments from a normal 100 counts per second to over 200,000 counts a second, in only a fraction of a millisecond.&lt;ref name=Kouveliotou /&gt; This giant flare was detected by numerous spacecraft and with these detections was localized by the interplanetary network to SGR 0526-66 inside the N-49 SNR of the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]].&lt;ref name=Mazets&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mazets EP, Aptekar RL, Cline TL, Frederiks DD, Goldsten JO, Golenetskii SV, Hurley K, von Kienlin A, Pal'shin VD |title=A Giant Flare from a Soft Gamma Repeater in the Andromeda Galaxy, M31 |journal=Astrophys J|year=2008 |arxiv=0712.1502|bibcode = 2008ApJ...680..545M |doi = 10.1086/587955 |volume=680|issue=1 |pages=545–549 }}&lt;/ref&gt; And, Konus detected another source in March 1979: [[SGR 1900+14]], located 20,000 light-years away in the constellation [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]] had a long period of low emissions, except the significant burst in 1979, and a couple after.

What is the evolutionary relationship between pulsars and magnetars? Astronomers would like to know if magnetars represent a rare class of pulsars, or if some or all pulsars go through a magnetar phase during their life cycles. NASA's [[Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer]] (RXTE) has revealed that the youngest known pulsing neutron star has thrown a temper tantrum. The collapsed star occasionally unleashes powerful bursts of X-rays, which are forcing astronomers to rethink the life cycle of neutron stars.

"We are watching one type of neutron star literally change into another right before our very eyes. This is a long-sought missing link between different types of pulsars", says Fotis Gavriil of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and the University of Maryland, Baltimore.&lt;ref name=Naeye&gt;{{cite web |author=Naeye R |title=Powerful Explosions Suggest Neutron Star Missing Link |year=2008|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2008/magnetar_hybrid.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:213034main kes 75 226.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Chandra X-ray Observatory|Chandra]] image shows the supernova Kes 75 with the young, normal pulsar, neutron star PSR J1846-0258 in the center of the blue area at the top.]]

PSR J1846-0258 is in the constellation Aquila. It had been classed as a normal pulsar because of its fast spin (3.1 s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and pulsar-like spectrum. RXTE caught four magnetar-like X-ray bursts on May 31, 2006, and another on July 27, 2006. Although none of these events lasted longer than 0.14 second, they all packed the wallop of at least 75,000 Suns. "Never before has a regular pulsar been observed to produce magnetar bursts", says Gavriil.&lt;ref name=Naeye /&gt;

"Young, fast-spinning pulsars were not thought to have enough magnetic energy to generate such powerful bursts", says Marjorie Gonzalez, formerly of McGill University in Montreal, Canada, now based at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. "Here's a normal pulsar that's acting like a magnetar."&lt;ref name=Naeye /&gt;
[[File:213032main chandra before after 226.jpg|thumb|300px|These [[Chandra X-ray Observatory|Chandra]] images show PSR J1846-0258 in Kes 75 on October 2000 (left) and June 2006 (right). The pulsar brightened in X-rays after giving off powerful outbursts earlier in 2006.]]

The observations from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory showed that the object had brightened in X-rays, confirming that the bursts were from the pulsar, and that its spectrum had changed to become more magnetar-like. The fact that PSR J1846's spin rate is decelerating also means that it has a strong magnetic field braking the rotation. The implied magnetic field is trillions of times stronger than Earth's field, but it's 10 to 100 times weaker than a typical magnetar. [[Victoria Kaspi]] of [[McGill University]] notes, "PSR J1846's actual magnetic field could be much stronger than the measured amount, suggesting that many young neutron stars classified as pulsars might actually be magnetars in disguise, and that the true strength of their magnetic field only reveals itself over thousands of years as they ramp up in activity."&lt;ref name=Naeye /&gt;{{clear}}

== X-ray dark stars ==
{{Main|X-ray dark star}}
During the solar cycle, as shown in the sequence of images of the [[X-ray astronomy#Sun|Sun in X-rays]], the Sun is almost X-ray dark, almost an X-ray variable. [[Betelgeuse]], on the other hand, appears to be always X-ray dark.&lt;ref name=Posson&gt;{{cite arXiv |vauthors=Posson-Brown P, Kashyap VL, Pease DO, Drake JJ |title=Dark Supergiant: Chandra's Limits on X-rays from Betelgeuse |eprint=astro-ph/0606387|year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The X-ray flux from the entire stellar surface corresponds to a surface flux limit that ranges from 30-7000 ergs s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; at T=1 MK, to ~1 erg s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; at higher temperatures, five orders of magnitude below the quiet Sun X-ray surface flux.&lt;ref name=Posson /&gt;

Like the [[red supergiant]] Betelgeuse, hardly any X-rays are emitted by [[red giant]]s.&lt;ref name=Gudel&gt;{{cite journal|author=Güdel M |title=X-ray astronomy of stellar coronae |journal=Astron Astrophys Rev |year=2004 |volume=12 |issue=2–3 |pages=71–237 |doi=10.1007/s00159-004-0023-2 |url=http://astronomy.sci.ege.edu.tr/~rpekunlu/GBDG/papers/XRayfromStellarCoronae.pdf |arxiv=astro-ph/0406661 |bibcode=2004A&amp;ARv..12...71G |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811230835/http://astronomy.sci.ege.edu.tr/~rpekunlu/GBDG/papers/XRayfromStellarCoronae.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cause of the X-ray deficiency may involve
* a turn-off of the [[Dynamo theory|dynamo]],
* a suppression by competing [[Stellar wind|wind]] production, or
* strong attenuation by an overlying thick [[chromosphere]].&lt;ref name=Gudel /&gt;

Prominent bright red giants include [[Aldebaran]], [[Arcturus]], and [[Gamma Crucis]]. There is an apparent X-ray "dividing line" in the [[Hertzsprung-Russell diagram|H-R diagram]] among the [[giant star]]s as they cross from the [[main sequence]] to become red giants. [[Alpha Trianguli Australis]] (α TrA / α Trianguli Australis) appears to be a Hybrid star (parts of both sides) in the "Dividing Line" of evolutionary transition to red giant.&lt;ref name=Kashyap&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kashyap V, Rosner R, Harnden FR Jr, Maggio A, Micela G, Sciortino S |title=X-ray emission on hybird stars: ROSAT observations of alpha Trianguli Australis and IOTA Aurigae |journal=Astrophys J|year=1994|volume=431 |page=402|doi=10.1086/174494 |bibcode=1994ApJ...431..402K}}&lt;/ref&gt; α TrA can serve to test the several [[X-ray astronomy#Astronomical models|Dividing Line models]].

There is also a rather abrupt onset of X-ray emission around spectral type A7-F0, with a large range of luminosities developing across spectral class F.&lt;ref name=Gudel /&gt;

In the few genuine late A- or early F-type coronal emitters, their weak dynamo operation is generally not able to brake the rapidly spinning star considerably during their short lifetime so that these coronae are conspicuous by their severe deficit of X-ray emission compared to chromospheric and transition region fluxes; the latter can be followed up to mid-A type stars at quite high levels.&lt;ref name=Gudel /&gt; Whether or not these atmospheres are indeed heated acoustically and drive an "expanding", weak and cool corona or whether they are heated magnetically, the X-ray deficit and the low coronal temperatures clearly attest to the inability of these stars to maintain substantial, hot coronae in any way comparable to cooler active stars, their appreciable chromospheres notwithstanding.&lt;ref name=Gudel /&gt;

== X-ray interstellar medium ==
{{Main|Interstellar medium}}
The Hot Ionized Medium (HIM), sometimes consisting of [[Corona|coronal gas]], in the temperature range 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; – 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; K emits X-rays. [[Stellar wind]]s from young clusters of stars (often with giant or supergiant [[HII region]]s surrounding them) and [[shock wave]]s created by [[supernova]]e inject enormous amounts of energy into their surroundings, which leads to hypersonic turbulence. The resultant structures&amp;nbsp;– of varying sizes&amp;nbsp;– can be observed, such as [[stellar wind bubble]]s and [[superbubble]]s of hot gas, by X-ray satellite telescopes. The Sun is currently traveling through the [[Local Interstellar Cloud]], a denser region in the low-density [[Local Bubble]].

== Diffuse X-ray background ==

In addition to discrete sources which stand out against the sky, there is good evidence for a diffuse X-ray background.&lt;ref name=Morrison /&gt; During more than a decade of observations of X-ray emission from the Sun, evidence of the existence of an isotropic X-ray background flux was obtained in 1956.&lt;ref name=Kupperian&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kupperian JE Jr |author2=Friedman H |title=Experiment research US progr. for IGY to 1.7.58 |journal=IGY Rocket Report Ser. |month= |year=1958 |volume= |issue=1 |page=201 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This background flux is rather consistently observed over a wide range of energies.&lt;ref name=Morrison /&gt; The early high-energy end of the spectrum for this diffuse X-ray background was obtained by instruments on board [[Ranger 3]] and [[Ranger 5]].&lt;ref name=Morrison /&gt; The X-ray flux corresponds to a  total energy density of about 5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; eV/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Morrison /&gt; The ROSAT soft X-ray diffuse background (SXRB) image shows the general increase in intensity from the Galactic plane to the poles.

== X-ray dark planets ==
{{Main|X-ray dark planet}}
X-ray observations offer the possibility to detect (X-ray dark) planets as they eclipse part of the corona of their parent star while in transit.

=== A brief history of autowave researches ===

The first who studied actively the [[Self-exciting oscillation|self-oscillations]] was Academician [[Aleksandr Andronov|AA Andronov]], and the term "''auto-oscillations''" in Russian terminology was introduced by AA Andronov in 1928. His followers&lt;ref group = "note" name="P003"/&gt; from [[N. I. Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod|Lobachevsky University]] further contributed greatly to the development of ''autowave theory''.

The simplest autowave equations describing combustion processes have been studied by [[Andrey Kolmogorov|A.N. Kolmogorov]],&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Kolmogorov-1937"/&gt; I.E. Petrovsky, [[:ru:Пискунов, Николай Семёнович|N.S. Piskunov]] in 1937., as well as by [[Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich|Ya.B. Zel'dovich]] и [[David A. Frank-Kamenetskii|D.A. Frank-Kamenetsky]]&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Zeldovich-1938"/&gt; in 1938.

The classical axiomatic model with autowaves in myocardium was published in 1946 by [[Norbert Wiener]] and [[Arturo Rosenblueth]].&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Wiener-1946"/&gt;

During 1970-80, major efforts to study autowaves were concentrated in the [[Institute of Biological Physics in Pushchino|Institute of Biological Physics]] of [[Russian Academy of Sciences|the USSR Academy of Sciences]], located in the suburban town [[Pushchino]], near Moscow. It was here, under the guidance of V.I.Krinsky,  such world-famous now experts in the field of the autowave researches as A.V.Panfilov, I.R.Efimov, R.R.Aliev, K.I. Agladze, O.A.Mornev, M.A.Tsyganov were educated and trained. V.V.Biktashev, Yu.E. Elkin, A.V. Moskalenko gained their experience with the autowave theory also in Pushchino, in the neighboring [[Institute of Mathematical Problems of Biology]], under the guidance of E.E.Shnoll.

{{centered pull quote|The term "autowave processes" for all these (and other) phenomena was coined by the USSR physicist R.V. Khokhlov.

The term "''autowaves''" was proposed, probably, on the analogy of previously "''auto-oscillations''".

Almost immediately after the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union]], many of these Russian scientists left their native country for working in foreign institutions, where they still continue their studies of autowaves. In particular,  E.R.Efimov is developing the ''theory of virtual electrode'',&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Efimov-2004"/&gt; which describes some effects occurring during [[defibrillation]].

Among other notable scientists, who are engaged in these investigation, there are A.N. Zaikin and E.E.Shnoll (autowaves and [[bifurcation memory]] in the blood coagulation system);&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Fazli-2002ufn"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Fazli-2007ufn"/&gt; A.Yu.

A huge role in the study of autowave models of cardiac tissue belongs to [[Denis Noble]] and members of his team from the [[University of Oxford]].

=== The basic definitions ===

One of the first definitions of autowaves was as follows: {{centered pull quote|It is accepted now to consider an autowave as some self-sustaining wave process in a non-equilibrium environment that remain unchanged for sufficiently small changes in both the initial and boundary conditions. (...) Mathematical apparatus for describing autowaves often are [[Reaction-diffusion|the equations of the diffusion type with an active nonlinearity]].

Под автоволнами принято сейчас понимать самоподдерживающийся волновой процесс в неравновесной среде, остающийся неизменным при достаточно малых изменениях как начальных, так и граничных условий. (...) Математическим аппаратом для описания автоволн чаще всего служат уравнения диффузионного типа с активной нелинейностью.  {{hidden end}}

Unlike linear waves — such as sound waves, electromagnetic waves and other, which are inherent in [[conservative system]]s and mathematically described by linear second order [[Hyperbolic partial differential equation|hyperbolic equations]] ([[wave equation]]s), — dynamics of an ''autowave'' in terms of [[differential equations]] can be described by [[Parabolic partial differential equation|parabolic equation]] ''with nonlinear free member of a special form''.

The concrete form of the free member &lt;math&gt;\vec{f}(\vec{u})&lt;/math&gt; is extremely important, because: {{centered pull quote|
...all wave processes generated by the nonlinear dynamics of a point system &lt;math&gt;\dot{\vec{u}}  = \vec{f}(\vec{u})&lt;/math&gt;, which is a self-oscillating or potentially self-oscillating.

''Autowaves'' is an example of a self-sustaining wave process in extensive nonlinear systems containing distributed energy sources. It is correct for simple autowaves, that period, wavelength, propagation speed, amplitude, and some other characteristics of an autowave are determined solely by local properties of the medium. However, in the 21st century, researchers began to discover a growing number of examples of self-wave solutions when the "classical" principle is violated.

(See also general information in literature, for example, in&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Krinsky-1984"/&gt;&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Yakhno-1987en"/&gt;&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-SE_v01-1988"/&gt;&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Loskutov-1995"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Elkin-2006"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Elkin-2007"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Moskalenko-2009"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Fazli-2002ufn"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Fazli-2007ufn"/&gt;).

=== The simplest examples ===

[[File:Travelling wave for Fisher equation.svg|thumb|right|A switching wave front solution for Fisher's equation (See [[Reaction-diffusion]] for details).]]
The simplest model of autowave is a rank of dominoes that are falling one after another, if you drop an outermost one (so called "[[domino effect]]"). This is an example of a ''switching wave''.

As another example of autowaves, imagine that you stand on a field and set fire to the grass. While the temperature is below the threshold, the grass will not take fire. Upon reaching the ''threshold'' temperature ([[autoignition temperature]]) the [[combustion]] process begins, with the release of heat sufficient to ignite the nearest areas. The result is that the combustion front has been shaped, which spreads through the field. It can be said in such cases that autowave arose, which is one of the results of [[self-organization]] in non-equilibrium thermodynamic systems. After some time new grass replaces the burnt grass, and the field acquires again the ability for igniting. This is an example of an ''excitation wave''.

There are a great deal of other natural objects that are also considered among autowave processes: oscillatory [[chemical reaction]]s in active media (e.g., [[Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction]]), the spread of excitation pulses along nerve fibres, wave chemical signalling in the colonies of certain microorganisms, autowaves in [[ferroelectric]] and [[semiconductor]] films, population waves, spread of [[epidemics]] and of [[genes]], and many other [[phenomena]].

Nerve impulses, which serve as a typical example of autowaves in an active medium with recovery, were studied as far back as 1850 by [[Hermann von Helmholtz]]. The properties of nerve impulses that are typical for the simplest self-wave solutions (universal shape and amplitude, independent of the initial conditions, and annihilation under collisions) were ascertained in the 1920s and 1930s.

[[File:Action potential.svg|thumb|300px|Schematic of an [[electrophysiology|electrophysiological]] recording of an action potential showing the various phases that occur as the wave passes a point on a cell [[biological membrane|membrane]].]]
Let's consider a 2D active medium consisting of elements, each of which can be found in three different states: rest, excitation and [[Refractory period (physiology)|refractoriness]]. In the absence of external influence, elements are at rest. As a result of an influence upon it, when the concentration of the activator reaches the threshold, the element will switch to an excited state, acquiring the ability to excite the neighbouring elements. Some time after the excitation the element switches to a refractory state, in which it cannot be excited. Then the element return to its initial state of rest, gaining again the ability to transform into an excited state.

Any "classical" excitation wave moves in an excitable medium without attenuation, maintaining its shape and amplitude constant. As it passes, the energy loss ([[dissipation]]) is completely offset by the energy input from the elements of the active medium. The leading front of an autowave (the transition from rest to a state of excitation) is usually very small: for example, the ratio of the leading front duration to the entire duration of the pulse for a myocardium sample is about 1:330.

Unique opportunities to study the autowave processes in two- and three-dimensional active media with very different kinetics are provided with methods of mathematical modelling using computers. For computer simulation of autowaves, one uses a generalized Wiener–Rosenblueth model, as well as a large number of other models, among which a special place is occupied by The [[FitzHugh–Nagumo model]]  (the simplest model of an active medium, and its various versions) and The [[Hodgkin–Huxley model]] (nerve impulse). There are also many autowave myocardial models: The [[Beeler–Reuter model]], several Noble models (developed by [[Denis Noble]]), The [[Aliev–Panfilov model]], The [[Fenton-Karma model]], etc.

=== Basic properties of autowaves ===

It was also proven&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Kokoz-1973"/&gt; that the simplest autowave regimes should be common to every system of differential equations of any complexity that describe a particular active media, because such a system can be simplified to two differential equations.

== Main known autowave objects ==

First of all, we should notice, that the elements of the active media can be, at least, of three very different types; these are ''[[Self-exciting oscillation|self-exciting]]'', ''[[Excitable medium|excitable]]'' and ''[[wikt:trigger|trigger]]'' (or ''bistable'') regimes. Accordingly, there are three types of homogeneous active media composed of these elements.

A bistable element has two stable stationary states, transitions between which occur when external influence exceeds a certain threshold. In media of such elements, ''switching waves'' arise, which switch the medium from one of its states to the other. For instance, a classic case of such a switching autowave — perhaps, the simplest autowave phenomena — is falling dominoes (the example already given). Another simple example of a bistable medium is burning paper: the switching wave propagates in the form of a flame, switching paper from the normal state to its ashes.

An excitable element has only one stable stationary state. External influence over a threshold level can bring such an element out of its stationary state and perform an evolution before the element will return again to its stationary state. During such evolution, the active element can affect the adjacent elements and, in turn, lead them out of the stationary state too. As a result,  the ''excitation wave'' propagates in this medium. This is the most common form of autowaves in biological media, such as nervous tissue, or the myocardium.

[[File:Typical phase portraits of autowaves.gif|thumb|300px|right|Phase portraits (left column) and the corresponding behaviour (right column) of an element of an active medium:  '''A''' (upper row) — excitable, '''B''' — bistable, '''C''' (lower row) — self-oscillating element types.]]
A self-oscillating element has no stationary states and continually performs stable oscillations of some fixed form, amplitude and frequency. External influence can disturb these oscillations. After some relaxation time, all their characteristics except for the phase back to its stable value, but the phase can be changed. As a result, the ''phase waves'' spread in the medium of such elements. Such phase waves can be observed in electro-garlands or in certain chemical media. An example of a self-oscillating medium is the SA node in the heart, in which excitation pulses arise spontaneously.

It can be clearly seen on the phase portrait of the basic system of equations describing the active medium (see Fig.) that a significant difference between these three types of behaviour of an active medium is caused by the quantity and the position of its singular points. The shape of autowaves observed in reality can be very similar to each other, and therefore it can be difficult to assess the type of element only by the form of the excitation pulse.

Besides, autowave phenomena, which can be observed and investigated, depend greatly on geometrical and topological peculiarities of an active medium.

=== One-dimensional autowaves ===
{{expand section|date=March 2013}}

One-dimensional cases include autowave spread in cable and its spread in the ring, with the latter mode considering as a limiting case of a rotating wave in two-dimensional active medium, while the first case is considered as spread of the autowave in the ring with zero curvature (i.e., with an infinite radius).

=== Two-dimensional autowaves ===
{{expand section|date=March 2013}}

[[File:reaction diffusion spiral.gif|thumb|265px|left|Autowave reverberator found in the above two-component [[Reaction-diffusion|reaction-diffusion system]] of [[FitzHugh–Nagumo model|Fitzhugh-Nagumo]] type.]]
A number of autowave sources is known in the two-dimensional active media. In such a way, it is distinguished at least five type of re-entry,&lt;ref group="note" name="P001"/&gt; which are ''running around the ring'', ''spiral wave'', ''reverberator'' (i.e., ''two-dimensional autowave vortex'') and ''fibrillation''. The literature identifies two types of sources of ''concentric autowaves'' in 2D active media; these are ''pacemakers'' and ''leading centres''. Both the ''leading centres'' and ''reverberators'' are interesting, because they are not tied to the structure of the medium and can appear and disappear in its different parts. Areas of increased automation may also be an example of a sources of autowaves. Three different types of increased automation are known now:&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Ardashev-2009p06"/&gt;
# ''induced automatism''
# ''trigger automatism with the mechanism of early postdepolarisation''
# ''trigger automatism with the mechanism of late postdepolarisation''.

{{expand section|date=March 2013}}

{{centered pull quote|Collective amoebae [[Dictyostelium discoideum]] with a sufficient supply live as [[unicellular organism]]s. However, during starvation they crawl together with forming a [[multicellular organism]], which later gives [[spores]] that can survive under adverse conditions. It was found that the movement of amoebae is controlled by distribution of some substance, [[morphogen]] [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]],  in the environment. Such amoeba cells synthesize and accumulate the molecules of cAMP and then they are able to "release" this reserve into the environment, if the concentration of cAMP in it increased. The released quantity of cAMP diffuses through the environment and makes the following cell amoebas "snap into action" by throwing their portion of the morphogen out. As a result, an autowave of high concentration of cAMP spreads through the environment. After the passage of the wave, the "discharged" cells begin to accumulate a new portion of cAMP again, due to the synthesis, and after a while they are able to "snap into action" again.Thus, the population of the ''collective amoebae'' is a typical example of the [[active medium]].

Коллективные амёбы [[Dictyostelium discoideum]] при наличие достаточного питания живут в виде [[:ru:Одноклеточный организм|одноклеточных организмов]]. Однако при голодании они сползаются и образуют [[:ru:Многоклеточный организм]], который впоследствии даёт [[:ru:споры]], способные пережить неблагоприятные условия. Установлено, что движение амёб управляется распределением по среде некоторого вещества — ''морфогена'' [[:ru:Циклический аденозинмонофосфат|цАМФ]]. Клетки амёб синтезируют и накапливают в себе молекулы цАМФ и способны «высвободить» его запас в окружающую среду, если концентрация цАМФ в ней повысилась. Освободившееся количество цАМФ распространяется за счёт диффузии по среде и заставляет следующие клетки амёб «сработать», выбросив свою порцию морфогена. В результате по среде распространяется автоволна — повышенная концентрация цАМФ. После прохождения волны «разрядившиеся» клетки начинают вновь накапливать за счёт синтеза определённую порцию цАМФ и по прошествии некоторого времени способны «срабатывать» вновь. Таким образом, популяция ''коллективных амёб'' служит типичным примером активной среды. {{hidden end}}

&lt;ref name="P001"&gt;Now the sad role of re-entry as the causes of various cardiac arrhythmias is well recognized. The basic scheme re-entry was proposed as long ago as 1914, with being obtained in studies of isolated cardiac tissue rings (GR Mines — Trans.R.Soc.Can., 1914, 8, 43).  T.Lewis etc. demonstrated in 1921 that atrial flutter may be conditioned by the circulation of the excitation wave down the right and up the left atrium (Heart, 1921, 8, 361). This fact was again confirmed experimentally in the middle of 20th century by C.E.Cabrera and D.Soli-Pollares (Arch. Inst. Cardiol. Mex., 1947, 17,850). The essential role of re-entry as a pathogenetic mechanism of supraventricular tachycardia was suggested in 1928 by F.O.Schmidt and J.Erlanger (Am. J. Physiol. 1928-1929, 87, 326). It is also responsible for many types of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Bachelor of Education''' (B.Ed.) is a [[bachelor's degree|graduate]] [[professional degree]] which prepares students for work as a teacher in schools, though in some countries additional work must be done in order for the student to be fully qualified to teach.

==USA and Canada==
In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], this degree is awarded for coursework completed within a program lasting one to five years, depending on the requirements established by the place where the province or state in which the university is located. In Canada, a B.Ed. degree is required for teaching certification.

A B.Ed. program may have direct entry from high school; as a combined degree with another bachelor's degree (e.g., B.A./B.Ed.); or as an after-degree program where the candidate has obtained a bachelor's degree, usually in the field in which the student wishes to teach. A good rapport or previous experience with young children or teens is also a desired characteristic of applicants.

There are several streams to a Bachelor of Education, each corresponding to the particular level of instruction. In the [[United States]], this includes [[elementary school]] education, [[middle school]] education, and [[high school]] education. Students in the elementary education stream generally study for a [[Bachelor of Liberal Studies|Liberal Studies]] degree. In the high school (secondary education) stream, the student specializes in one to two subject areas. Upon completion of the degree, they will prepare and eventually sit for the state's Board of Education certification examination.

A typical B.Ed. program may include coursework in [[pedagogy]], educational psychology, educational policy and leadership, assessment, curriculum development; and lesson planning, social justice, special education, and instructional technology.

==Australia==
In Australia, a 4-Year Bachelor of Education degree combines practical/pedagogical study with a Major sequence in the academic discipline of Education. In the majority of Australian universities, there is usually 2 distinct types of the Bachelor of Education: Primary and Secondary. The subjects and degree programs are quite different in both degrees e.g. for a student studying the Bachelor of Education (Primary) the focus of their degree would lie in behaviour, children, basic literacy, how children learn etc. For a student studying the Bachelor of Education (Secondary) they would therefore be teaching roughly 11- to 18-year-old adolescents and their programs would have less focus on those kinds of areas by the Primary degree. Instead, the degree is based around the student's intending teaching subjects; usually 1 or 2. In NSW, these teaching areas provide the major focus for their degrees in their final years. They consist of: English, Mathematics, Science (Biology, Physics &amp; Chemistry), Geography, History, Business Studies, Legal Studies, Economics, Society &amp; Culture and Languages.
The longer duration of the course allows for more practical experiences and greater personal or professional development before teaching service. Most Australian State Teacher-Certification bodies require either a Bachelor of Education, or a bachelor's degree in one or two subject areas, with a Graduate Diploma in Education as a minimum. A B.Ed. is not to be confused with the lesser degree Bachelor of Teaching, which is usually an 'End-On' course similar but slightly longer than a Graduate Diploma in Education.

Note: In Australia, the term Undergraduate Degree is used to describe all degrees undertaken by a first-time university student and usually no pre-requisite tertiary level studies are required, mostly just the completion of Secondary High School. Postgraduate degrees are used to describe the degrees completed with an Undergraduate degree as pre-requisite.

==Bangladesh==
In [[Bangladesh]], Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.) is an undergraduate professional degree for Hons. (4 years) and Diploma (1/2/3 years) in Education offered by the authorized Teachers Training Institutes or Colleges for those aimed their profession as a Teacher or as an Education and Curriculum Specialist or as an Educationalist in the government and non-governmental educational institutes or any educational organizations such as [[Save the Children]], [[UNICEF]], [[United Nations Development Programme]], BFES, SSUF, ASA etc. B.Ed. degree is mandatory for the teaching profession in both of primary and Secondary school level. Without teaching profession, if anyone wants to go other professions such as education &amp; curriculum specialist, researcher, administrator etc. in any educational or other sectors, he/she must have the minimum qualification of Hons. graduation degree in Education (B.Ed. hons. degree). Every year many talent Hons. graduate students from this subject get international scholarship from well known universities of other countries like [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[United States|USA]], [[Japan]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]] etc. The minimum qualification required for entry into '''B.Ed. Hons. (4 years)''' course is passed H.S.C or Equivalent and for entry into Diploma (1/2/3 years) course in education is [[Bachelor of Arts]] (B.A) or [[Bachelor of Science]] (B.Sc). The Hons. students of this subject have to read basic educational course contents as their major courses with some minor subject courses. In addition, usually for diploma (1/2/3 years) students from Arts faculty are trained to lecture subjects like history, civics, geography and languages and from Science faculty are trained to follow their lecture on mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology etc. whereas graduates from Commerce faculty trained up to lecture on accounting &amp; finance, economics, management &amp; marketing. After B.Ed. hons., one can continue for Master in Education (M.Ed.), M.Phil, PhD.D in Education in some universities of Bangladesh. National Council for Education and related Universities as well as their institutions is the constitutional authority to standardize courses for the educationalist and teachers in Bangladesh.

Major universities which offer B.Ed. in Bangladesh are:-
* Govt. Teachers' Training College, Dhaka, [[National University, Bangladesh]]

*Proyash Institute of Special Education &amp; Research (PISER), [[Bangladesh University of Professionals]]
*Institute of Education and Research (IER), [[University of Dhaka]]
*Institute of Education and Research (IER), [[Chittagong University]]
*School of Education, [[Bangladesh Open University]]
*Institute of Educational Development (IED), [[BRAC University]]
*Department of Education &amp; Physical Education, [[Uttara University]]
*Dept.of Education and Training, [[Asian University of Bangladesh]]
*Department of Education, [[Prime University]]
*Dept.of Education and Training, [[Darul Ihsan University]]
*Govt.Teacher Training College Mymensingh

==Israel==
In Israel, Bachelor of Education(B.Ed.) is a course offered Suitable for those interested in developing the field. Developed unique training programs tailored contemporary trends in professional training for teaching. In addition, there are plans Sitting studies of academics and teachers complete undergraduate studies. In Israel there are a number of colleges and universities offering B.Ed. studies as [[:he:מכללת לוינסקי לחינוך|Levinsky College of Education]] and B.Sc.Ed. at The Technion - Israel Institute of Technology

==India==
In India, Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.) is an undergraduate course offered for those interested in pursuing a career in teaching. The B.Ed. degree is mandatory for teaching at the secondary (classes 6 to 10) and higher secondary (10+2 or classes 11 and 12). The minimum qualification required for entry into B.Ed. course is [[Bachelor of Arts]] (B.A.) or [[Bachelor of Science]] (B.Sc.). While students from the Arts stream are trained to teach subjects like History, Civics, Geography, and languages, the students from the Science stream are trained to teach Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. The duration of the course is two years from session 2015-16 as per NCTE Regulations, 2014. After B.Ed., students can pursue [[Master of Education]] (M.Ed.) in any Indian university or teacher-training institutes offering the course. The [[National Council for Teacher Education]] is the statutory body which regulating teacher training courses in the country of India.

The Right to Free and Compulsory Education for Children (RTE Act 2009) came into force from April 2010. The act emphasizes on quality education for every child. As such, with the view to bring about quality education in schools, it is required that the entry level percentage to B.Ed. be 50 for those candidates in the General Category and 45 for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.

The Bachelor of Elementary Education (B.El.Ed.) programme is a four-year integrated professional degree programme offered after the higher secondary stage of school. B.El.Ed. is designed to integrate the study of subject knowledge, human development, pedagogical knowledge, and communication skills. Both professional and academic options are available to students who graduate with a B.El.Ed. degree.

==Ireland==
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], a 4-Year Bachelor of Education degree combines practical/pedagogical study with a Major sequence in the academic discipline of Education. Modules in the [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[English language]]s are compulsory.

Students study a range of Education-related subjects, including Psychology, Sociology, History, Social Policy, Professional Practice. Students also study subjects from another field or discipline as qualification for an intended teaching area or method.

The degree is available in several specialisations, including Primary, Secondary, Human Movement/Health, Music, or Early Childhood education. The longer duration of the course allows for more practical experiences and greater personal or professional development before teaching service. Teacher-Certification bodies require either a Bachelor of Education, or an Undergraduate/Bachelor's Degree in one or two subject areas, with a Diploma of Education as a minimum. A B.Ed. is not to be confused with the lesser degree Bachelor of Teaching, which is usually an 'End-On' course similar but slightly longer than a Diploma of Education.

==New Zealand==
The 3-year Bachelor of Education prepares graduates to teach in early childhood centres, primary and intermediate schools. With the Bachelor of Education one can specialise in Primary, Early Childhood, Physical Education and Huarahi Māori. The qualification is designed to equip students with the skills and knowledge they need to be effective teachers, and to gain provisional registration with the New Zealand Teachers Council. Teaching practicums allow students to gain invaluable experience in diverse education settings as they study. The Bachelor of Education can lead on to further postgraduate study.

== Nigeria ==
In [[Nigeria]], the Bachelor of Education degree is awarded at Universities and Colleges of Education across the nation as a first degree. There are a few specialised Universities of Education in the country that exist to train teachers professionally. Some of these specialised Universities include [[Tai Solarin University of Education]] and [[Ignatius Ajuru University of Education]]. The B.Ed can be done as combined honours with a B.A. or B.Sc. It can also be done as a single honours degree with specialisations in Nursery and Primary Education, Curriculum Development, Educational Administration and Policy Studies, among others. Students usually undergo intensive teaching practices at the 2nd and 3rd years of study. Upon graduation, they are registered by the Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria (TRCN) and can be employed as teachers afterwards. Postgraduate education usually take the form of an [[Master of Education|M.Ed]], PGDE, and GDE.

==Sri Lanka==
The Bachelor of Education degree was first introduced by the [[University of Ceylon]] (Sri Lanka) in 1963. Prof. J. E. Jayasuriya, then Professor of Education at University of Ceylon introduced the course to meet the growing demand for professional teacher qualifications. Then the practice was to join the teaching profession with a bachelor's degree either in Arts or Sciences and after four years of teaching in a Secondary school teachers get the One year Post-Graduate Diploma in Education.

The University of Ceylon used to take only 50 -60 Post Graduate Diploma candidates at a time in an annual program. The B.Ed. degree was introduced combining the bachelor's degree and the Post Graduate Diploma in Education. B.Ed. was introduced as a four-year special degree and in contrast with the 9 - 10 3hr papers at the final degree examination, a B.Ed. degree required a candidates to sit for 19 - 20 papers for the finals. This happened due to combining of the bachelor's degree and the Post-graduate Diploma in Education. Only the top performing students were admitted to B.Ed. degree at University of Ceylon, Peradeniya. The first batch graduated in 1967. Following this Australia introduced the B.Ed. degree. Upali M Sedere was the first First Class holder of the B.Ed. degree from University of Ceylon, Peradeniya in 1969. Subsequently, in 1973, the B.Ed. program at the University of Sri Lanka changed in its scope and character.

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]], where both the [[university]] system and [[school]] system are very different, the degree is awarded after a three or four-year course (the course length depends on the university) which is specifically tailored to either [[primary education]] or for a limited range of [[secondary education]] subjects. It leads to [[Qualified Teacher Status]] (QTS) in England and Wales and is a [[teaching qualification]] in Scotland and Northern Ireland.

As a result of the [[Robbins Report|Robbins Report on higher education (1963)]], the teacher training colleges were reformed as [[College of education|Colleges of Education]]. Such colleges, as in the case of those in London, became 'constituent colleges' of the [[Institute of Education]], with their academic award being from the [[University of London]]. Students were offered an extra year of study, bringing the course up to four years in length and resulting in the award of the Bachelor of Education degree. The first Bachelors of Education graduated in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atm.org.uk/mt/archive/mt196files/ATM-MT196-03-07.pdf atm.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

The BEd became more widespread in the early 1980s, when a [[bachelor's degree]] became a requirement for new teachers in the whole of the United Kingdom, replacing the old [[Certificate in Education]] (Cert Ed).

The BEd is not the only way of gaining Qualified Teacher Status or gaining a teaching qualification. Other routes are as follows:

==Bachelor of Science Education (B.Sc.Ed.)==
A Bachelor of Science Education is a degree awarded to students who complete the four to five-year course of study in the field of science (major and minor in biology, chemistry, physics, and math) with major Educational courses. It is the combination of degrees in science and education course (sometimes referred to double degree programs B.Sc + B.Ed. = B.Sc.Ed.). Even though B.Sc and B.Ed. are notionally two degrees, they must be taken together. There are very few universities that offer this course because it requires collaboration between the Faculty/School of Science and that of Education, to ensure that the teacher not only can work in an education institution but also in an industrial area related to science.

In Malaysia, it is one of the most difficult admittance degrees for the students to get into. Students not only need a distinction result but also need to go through a psychology test, rigorous interviews and demos of teaching. Students who already get these courses will be given a full scholarship by the Minister of Education. Upon graduation, the students will get job offers from government and private institutions (mostly to teach for matriculation, foundation or high school students) due to deep understanding of specific science and professional teaching training. Graduates also can work in other science related industries. Bachelor of Science ''and'' Education is totally different from Bachelor of Science ''in'' Education.

In Singapore, the [[National Institute of Education]], an autonomous institute of Nanyang Technological University, offers a four-year undergraduate programme, offering B.Sc.(Ed.) or B.A.(Ed.) in its initial teacher training programmes. Students are taught pedagogical theories and principles, alongside their chosen subject majors (and minors).

{{other uses|Blackwater (disambiguation)}}

'''Blackwater''' is used to describe [[wastewater]] from toilets, which likely contains [[pathogen]]s.  Blackwater can contain [[feces]], [[urine]], water and toilet paper from [[flush toilet]]s. Blackwater is distinguished from [[greywater]], which comes from household use other than toilets.  Greywater results from washing food, clothing, dishes, as well as from showering or bathing.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.eawag.ch/en/department/sandec/publications/compendium/|title=Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies |edition=2nd Revised |author1=Tilley, E.|author2=Ulrich, L.|author3=Lüthi, C.|author4=Reymond, Ph.|author5=Zurbrügg, C.|publisher=Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag)|location=Duebendorf, Switzerland|isbn=978-3-906484-57-0|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackwater and greywater are separated in "ecological buildings", such as [[autonomous building]]s. [[Recreational vehicle]]s often have separate holding tanks for greywater from showers and sinks, and blackwater from the toilet.

==Definition==
According to one source:

{{quote|Blackwater is the mixture of [[urine]], [[human feces|feces]] and flushwater along with [[anal cleansing]] water (if water is used for cleansing) and/or dry cleansing materials. Blackwater contains the pathogens of faeces and the nutrients of urine that are diluted in the flushwater.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Water coming from domestic equipment other than toilets (e.g., bathtubs, showers, sinks, washing machines) is called greywater. In some sanitation systems, it is preferred to keep the greywater separate from blackwater to reduce the amount of water that gets heavily polluted and to simplify treatment methods for the greywater.

Blackwater is a term dating to at least the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;vid=USPAT3915857&amp;id=poY7AAAAEBAJ US Patent 3915857], issued in October 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment processes==
Blackwater contains pathogens that must decompose before they can be released safely into the environment.  It is difficult to process blackwater if it contains a large quantity of excess water, or if it must be processed quickly, because of the high concentrations of organic material.  

=== Composting ===
However, if blackwater does not contain excess water, or if it receives primary treatment to de-water, then it is easily processed through [[composting]].  The heat produced by naturally occurring [[thermophilic]] microorganisms will heat the compost to over {{convert|60|C|F}}, and destroy potential pathogens.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Blackwater generation can be avoided by making use of [[composting toilet]]s and [[vermifilter]] toilets. In certain autonomous buildings, such as [[earthship]]s, this is almost always present and allows the water requirements of the building (which, with earthships, are self-generated) to be heavily reduced. Besides saving water, composting toilets allow the user to reuse the nutrients found therein (e.g., for growing crops/trees).

'''Bush regeneration''', a form of '''natural area restoration''',  is the term used in [[Australia]] for the [[ecology|ecological]] [[restoration ecology|restoration]] of remnant vegetation areas, such as through the minimisation of negative disturbances, both exogenous such as exotic weeds and endogenous such as [[erosion]]. It may also attempt to recreate conditions of pre-European arrival, for example by simulating endogenous disturbances such as fire. Bush [[regeneration (ecology)|regeneration]] attempts to protect and enhance the floral [[biodiversity]] in an area by providing conditions conducive to the recruitment and survival of native plants. Bushcare's Major Day Out is an Australian national day of community participation in the care of bushland. In 2012 nearly 100 bushcare sites participated in this annual event.

==History==

===Bradley method===
In the early 1960s Joan and Eileen Bradley&lt;ref&gt;http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/bradley-eileen-burton-9566&lt;/ref&gt; developed a series of weed control techniques through a process of trial and error. Their work was the beginning of minimal disturbance bush regeneration in [[New South Wales]].&lt;ref name="Buchanan"&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Buchanan
  | first = Robin A.
  | authorlink =  
  | title = Bush Regeneration: Recovering Australian Landscapes
  | publisher = The Open Training and Education Network
  | year = 1989
  | location = Redfern}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The Bradley method urges a [[Conservation ethic|naturalistic]] approach by encouraging the native vegetation to self-reestablish. The Bradleys used their method to successfully clear weeds from a {{convert|16|ha|acre|abbr=off}}  reserve in Ashton Park, part of Sydney Harbour National Park, NSW. The process demonstrated that, following a period of consecutive 'follow up' treatments of diminishing time requirement, subsequent maintenance was needed only once or twice a year, mainly in vulnerable spots such as [[stream|creek]] banks, roadsides, and clearings, to be maintained weed-free.

The aim of their work was to clear small niches adjacent to healthy native vegetation such that the each area will regenerate from in-situ soil seed banks or be re-colonised and stabilized by the regeneration of native plants, replacing an area previously occupied by weeds. The Bradley method follows three main principles, 
#secure the best areas first
#minimise disturbance to the natural conditions (e.g. minimise soil disturbance and off-target damage).
#don't overclear, let the regenerative ability of the bush set the pace of clearance (Bradley 1988).
The priority securing of the best quality vegetation aids in preserving areas of top [[biodiversity]] which provide regeneration potential to expand these areas and reclaim areas as bushland.

===Modern practice===
The adoption of minimal disturbance bush regeneration increased in the decades that followed the work of the Bradleys. Their principles have guided bushcare programs in Australia, although the inclusion of [[herbicide]] in modern bush regeneration is a notable deviation from the ideals of the Bradley sisters.&lt;ref name="Stenhouse 2004"&gt;{{cite journal

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, rather than 'minimal disturbance', a more favoured and ecologically sound trend since the 1990s has been towards more 'appropriate disturbance' as many Australian plant communities require some level of perturbation to trigger germination from long-buried seed banks.  This has led to a range of additional disturbance-based techniques (such as burns and [[soil resilience|soil disturbance]]) being included in the regenerator's 'tool kit' in dry forest and grassland areas.  Field experience has found that, even in [[rainforest]] areas, a [[Resilience (ecology)|resilience]] to disturbance is evident, enabling regenerators to clear weed in a fairly extensive manner to trigger rainforest recovery. This is borne out by a thriving rainforest regeneration industry in northern  NSW Australia, modelled on the pioneering work of John Stockard at [[Wingham Brush Nature Reserve|Wingham Brush]] (Stockard 1991, Stockard 1999).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aabr.org.au/the-regeneration-of-wingham-brush-nsw/ &lt;/ref&gt;
The rule of thumb in all cases is to constrain clearing to that area that matches the project's follow up resources.

The increased awareness and consideration of Australia's biodiversity by citizens has incrementally increased pressure on local governments to adopt conservation programs for remnant vegetation on council land. 
Most peri urban councils now have some involvement in bush regeneration, either through planning, land management, volunteer support or through employment of bush regeneration practitioners.&lt;ref name="Stenhouse 2004"/&gt; In NSW the level of coordination of bush regeneration programs through local governments is high, although in some other areas at present a lack of coordination is a serious concern in bush regeneration on public land, with only 40% of councils liaising with other councils.&lt;ref name="Stenhouse 2004"/&gt; In such areas there may be a need for strategic management at a regional scale through Natural Resource Management Boards or non government organisations such as [[Trees For Life (Australia)|Trees For Life]], which are involved in bushcare programs across wider areas.

==Purposes==

The aim of bush regeneration, also known as 'natural area restoration', is to restore and maintain ecosystem health by facilitating the natural regeneration of indigenous flora, this is usually achieved by selectively reducing the competitive interaction with invasive species,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book 
  | title = Conservation of Urban Bushland
  | publisher = National Trust of Australia (NSW)
  | year = 1986}}
&lt;/ref&gt; or mitigation of negative influences such as weeds or erosion.&lt;ref name="Buchanan"/&gt; See also [[Albert Morris]].

Invasive plant species are often the greatest threat to remnant vegetation,&lt;ref name="Stenhouse 2004"/&gt; and therefore bush regeneration is closely associated with weed abatement activities. Weed management as one aim of bush regeneration, is used to increase native plant recruitment. The management of factors such as fire and herbivory can be just as important, depending on the ecosystem being restored. In recent years research and on-ground management has begun to recognize the importance of ecosystem processes rather ecosystem composition and structure &lt;ref name=prober&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and research into other ways of facilitating native plant recruitment is increasing.

==Technique==

The original Bradley method of bush regeneration focuses on facilitating native plant recruitment from the [[seedbank]], rather than planting [[seedling]]s or sowing seeds, as follows: &lt;blockquote&gt;
"Weeding a little at a time from the bush towards the [[weed]]s takes the pressure off the natives under favourable conditions. Native seeds and spores are ready in the ground and the natural environment favours plants that have evolved in it. The balance is tipped back towards regeneration. Keep it that way, by always working where the strongest area of bush meets the weakest weeds"
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last =Bradley
  | first = Joan
  | title = Bringing back the bush
  | publisher = Lansdowne Press
  | year = 1988
  | location = Sydney}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Currently the term 'bush regeneration' includes activities other than weed removal, such as [[replanting]] and introducing species into an area where soil, water, or fire regimes have shifted the type of plant appropriate to the area (e.g. a [[stormwater drain]]).&lt;ref name="Buchanan"/&gt;

Weed species can be important habitat for native fauna (e.g. [[blackberry]] is important habitat for [[Maluridae|wrens]] and the [[southern brown bandicoot]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|last=  Haby
|first= Nerisa

|location= Adelaide
}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and this should be taken into consideration with bush regeneration, for example by not clearing invasive species until adequate habitat alternatives have been established nearby with native vegetation.

Problems can occur when insufficient follow-up is conducted as the success of bush regeneration is dependent on allowing the native vegetation to regenerate in the area where weeds have been removed.

A '''catkin''' or '''ament''' is a slim, cylindrical [[flower]] cluster (a [[spike (botany)|spike]]), with inconspicuous or no [[petal]]s, usually [[wind]]-[[pollination|pollinated]] ([[anemophily|anemophilous]]) but sometimes insect-pollinated (as in ''[[Salix]]'').  They contain many, usually [[plant sexuality|unisexual]] flowers, arranged closely along a central stem which is often drooping.  They are found in many [[plant]] families, including [[Betulaceae]], [[Fagaceae]], [[Moraceae]], and [[Salicaceae]]. For some time, they were believed to be a key [[synapomorphy]] among the proposed [[Hamamelididae]], also known as Amentiferae (''i.e.'', literally plants ''bearing aments''). Based on [[molecular phylogeny]] work, it is now believed that Hamamelididae is a [[polyphyletic]] group.&lt;ref name="Salvolainen et al. 2000"&gt;Savolainen, V., M. W. Chase, S. B. Hoot, C. M. Morton, D. E. Soltis, C. Bayer, M. F. Fay, A. Y. De Bruijn, S. Sullivan, and Y.-L. Qiu. 2000. Phylogenetics of flowering plants based on combined analysis of plastid ''atpB'' and ''rbcL'' gene sequences. Systematic Biology 49:306-362.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="soltis2011"&gt;Soltis, D. E. et alii. (28 authors). 2011. "Angiosperm phylogeny: 17 genes, 640 taxa". ''American Journal of Botany'' '''98'''(4):704-730. {{doi|10.3732/ajb.1000404}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the catkin flower arrangement has arisen at least twice independently by [[convergent evolution]], in [[Fagales]] and in [[Salicaceae]].&lt;ref name="Cronk et al. 2015"&gt;Cronk Q. C. B., Needham I., and Rudall P. J. 2015. Evolution of catkins: inflorescence morphology of selected Salicaceae in an evolutionary and developmental context. ''Frontiers in Plant Science''. 2015; 6: 1030. {{doi|10.3389/fpls.2015.01030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a convergent evolution raises questions about what the [[ancestral]] inflorescence characters might be and how catkins did evolve in these two lineages.

In many of these plants, only the male flowers form catkins, and the female flowers are single ([[hazel]], [[oak]]), a cone ([[alder]]) or other types ([[mulberry]]).  In other plants (such as [[Populus|poplar]]) both male and female flowers are borne in catkins.

Catkin-bearing plants include many other [[trees]] or [[shrub]]s such as [[birch]], [[willow]], [[hickory]], [[chestnut|sweet chestnut]] and  [[sweetfern]] (''Comptonia'').

The word ''catkin'' is a [[loanword]] from the old [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''katteken'', meaning "kitten", on account of the resemblance to a [[kitten]]'s tail.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Catkin|journal=Oxford English Dictionary|edition=Second|date=1989|accessdate=30 November 2009|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50034696}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ament'' is from the [[Latin]] ''amentum'', meaning "thong" or "strap".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Ament|journal=Oxford English Dictionary|edition=Second|date=1989|accessdate=30 November 2009|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50007124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Occurrence ==
In Britain, they can be seen in January or February, when many trees are bare for winter.  They can even occur in December.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/earth/story/20150127-an-early-hazel-catkin-year An early catkin year]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Center for research on Children, Adolescents and the Media (CCAM)''' at the [[University of Amsterdam]], the [[Netherlands]], was founded in 2005 by [[Patti Valkenburg]]. Since then, it has grown into one of the largest research centers in its kind worldwide.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} CCAM hosts 25 international researchers from 9 academic disciplines. It is part of the [[Amsterdam School of Communication Research]] ASCoR. Since 2009, CCAM researchers have organized an international master program on Youth and Media.

==Focus==

Children and adolescents have become the defining users of [[media (communication)|media]] and technologies. Despite a booming media industry aimed at young people, little is known about the uses and effects of these media and technologies. CCAM strives to better understand the role of media in [[children]]'s and adolescents' lives. What are the intended and unintended effects of [[advertising]]? Which children are particularly susceptible to potential negative effects of advertising, pornography, and media [[violence]]? When do [[social media]] have positive and negative influences on young people? Researchers in CCAM have published dozens of articles and chapters that provide answers on questions like these.

==Open access==

CCAM has an [[open access]] policy. All publications can be downloaded from the publication section. In addition, all instruments that CCAM researchers have created to investigate their theories and models are freely accessible via the website of CCAM.

==Knowledge dissemination==

Research within CCAM is targeted at an academic audience as well as the public at large. Every three months, the center publishes a news bulletin to inform the broader audience of the latest research insights.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22263">'''Chapman–Enskog''' theory provides a framework in which equations of [[Fluid dynamics|hydrodynamics]] for a gas can be derived from the [[Boltzmann equation]]. The technique justifies the otherwise phenomenological [[Constitutive equation|constitutive relations]] appearing in hydrodynamical descriptions such as the [[Navier–Stokes equations]].  In doing so, expressions for various transport coefficients such as [[thermal conductivity]] and [[viscosity]] are obtained in terms of molecular parameters. Thus, Chapman–Enskog theory constitutes an important step in the passage from a microscopic, particle-based description to a [[Continuum mechanics|continuum]] hydrodynamical one.

The theory is named for [[Sydney Chapman (mathematician)|Sydney Chapman]] and [[David Enskog]], who introduced it independently in 1916 and 1917.&lt;ref name="Chapman1970"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The starting point of Chapman–Enskog theory is the Boltzmann equation for the 1-particle distribution function &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{v},t)&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}+\mathbf{v\cdot }\frac{\partial f}{\partial 
\mathbf{r}}+\mathbf{F\cdot }\frac{\partial f}{\partial \mathbf{v}}=\hat{C} f,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\hat{C}&lt;/math&gt; is a nonlinear integral operator which models the evolution of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; under interparticle collisions. This nonlinearity makes solving the full Boltzmann equation difficult, and motivates the development of approximate techniques such as the one provided by Chapman–Enskog theory.

Given this starting point, the various assumptions underlying the Boltzmann equation carry over to Chapman–Enskog theory as well. The most basic of these requires a separation of scale between the collision duration &lt;math&gt;\tau_c&lt;/math&gt; and the mean free time between collisions &lt;math&gt;\tau_f&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;\tau_c \ll \tau_f&lt;/math&gt;. This condition ensures that collisions are well-defined events in space and time, and holds if the dimensionless parameter &lt;math&gt;\gamma \equiv r_c^3 n&lt;/math&gt; is small, where &lt;math&gt;r_c&lt;/math&gt; is the range of interparticle interactions and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number density.&lt;ref name="Balescu1975"&gt;{{Citation

| isbn    = 978-0-471-04600-4
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this assumption, Chapman–Enskog theory also requires that &lt;math&gt;\tau_f&lt;/math&gt; is much smaller than any ''extrinsic'' timescales &lt;math&gt;\{\tau_{\text{ext}}\}&lt;/math&gt;. These are the timescales associated with the terms on the left hand side of the Boltzmann equation, which describe variations of the gas state over macroscopic lengths. Typically, their values are determined by initial/boundary conditions and/or external fields. This separation of scales implies that the collisional term on the right hand side of the Boltzmann equation is much larger than the streaming terms on the left hand side. Thus, an approximate solution can be found from

:&lt;math&gt;
\hat{C} f = 0.
&lt;/math&gt;

It can be shown that the solution to this equation is a [[Gaussian function|Gaussian]]:

:&lt;math&gt;
f=n(\mathbf{r},t)\left( \frac{m}{2\pi k_{B}T(\mathbf{r},t)}\right)
^{3/2}\exp \left[ -\frac{m\left( \mathbf{v}-\mathbf{v}_{0}(\mathbf{r},t)\right) ^{2}}{2k_{B}T(\mathbf{r},t)}\right], 
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the molecule mass and &lt;math&gt;k_B&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]].&lt;ref name="Cercignani1975"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A gas is said to be in ''local equilibrium'' if it satisfies this equation.&lt;ref&gt;Balescu, p. 450&lt;/ref&gt; The assumption of local equilibrium leads directly to the [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]], which describe fluids without dissipation, i.e. with thermal conductivity and viscosity equal to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. The primary goal of Chapman–Enskog theory is to systematically obtain generalizations of the Euler equations which do incorporate dissipation. This is achieved by expressing deviations from local equilibrium as a perturbative series in [[Knudsen number]] &lt;math&gt;\text{Kn}&lt;/math&gt;, which is small if &lt;math&gt;\tau_f \ll \{\tau_{\text{ext}}\}&lt;/math&gt;. Conceptually, the resulting hydrodynamic equations describe the dynamical interplay between free streaming and interparticle collisions. The latter tend to drive the gas ''towards'' local equilibrium, while the former acts across spatial inhomogeneities to drive the gas ''away'' from local equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;Balescu, p. 451&lt;/ref&gt; When the Knudsen number is of the order of 1 or greater, the gas in the system being considered cannot be described as a fluid.

To first order in &lt;math&gt;\text{Kn}&lt;/math&gt;, one obtains the [[Navier–Stokes equations]]. Second and third orders give rise to the [[Burnett equations]] and super-Burnett equations.

==Mathematical Formulation==


Since the Knudsen number does not appear explicitly in the Boltzmann equation, but rather implicitly in terms of the distribution function and boundary conditions, a dummy parameter &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is introduced to keep track of the appropriate orders in the Chapman–Enskog expansion:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}+\mathbf{v\cdot }\frac{\partial f}{\partial \mathbf{r}}+\mathbf{F\cdot }\frac{\partial f}{\partial \mathbf{v}}=\frac{1}{\epsilon} \hat{C} f.
&lt;/math&gt;

It can be seen that small &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; implies the collisional term &lt;math&gt;\hat{C} f&lt;/math&gt; dominates the streaming term &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v\cdot}\frac{\partial f}{\partial\mathbf{r}}+\mathbf{F\cdot }\frac{\partial f}{\partial \mathbf{v}}&lt;/math&gt;, which is the same as saying the Knudsen number is small. Thus, the appropriate form for the Chapman–Enskog expansion is

:&lt;math&gt;
f=f^{(0)}+\epsilon f^{(1)}+\epsilon ^{2}f^{(2)}+\ldots \ .
&lt;/math&gt;

Solutions which can be formally expanded in this way are known as ''normal'' solutions to the Boltzmann equation.&lt;ref name="Grad1958"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clearly, this class of solutions excludes non-perturbative contributions (such as &lt;math&gt;e^{-1/\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt;), which appear in boundary layers or near internal [[Shock wave|shock layers]]. Thus, Chapman–Enskog theory is restricted to situations in which such solutions are negligible.

Substituting this expansion and equating orders of &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; leads to the hierarchy

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
J(f^{(0)},f^{(0)}) &amp;=0 \\
2J(f^{(0)},f^{(n)}) &amp;=\left(\frac{\partial }{\partial t}+\mathbf{v\cdot }\frac{\partial }{\partial \mathbf{r}}+\mathbf{F\cdot }\frac{\partial }{\partial \mathbf{v}} \right) f^{(n-1)}
-\sum_{m=1}^{n-1}J(f^{(n)},f^{(n-m)}), \qquad n &gt; 0, 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; is an integral operator, linear in both its arguments, which satisfies &lt;math&gt;J(f,g) = J(g,f)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;J(f,f) = \hat{C}f&lt;/math&gt;. The solution to the first equation is a Gaussian:

:&lt;math&gt;
f^{(0)}=n'(\mathbf{r},t)\left( \frac{m}{2\pi k_{B}T'(\mathbf{r},t)}\right)^{3/2}\exp \left[ -\frac{m\left( \mathbf{v}-\mathbf{v}'_{0}(\mathbf{r},t)\right) ^{2}}{2k_{B}T'(\mathbf{r},t)}\right].  
&lt;/math&gt;

for some functions &lt;math&gt;n'(\mathbf{r},t)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}'_{0}(\mathbf{r},t)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;T'(\mathbf{r},t)&lt;/math&gt;. It is tempting to equate these functions with the physical hydrodynamic fields defined as moments of &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{v},t)&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
n(\mathbf{r},t) &amp;= \int fd\mathbf{v} \\
n(\mathbf{r},t)v_{0}(\mathbf{r},t) &amp;= \int \mathbf{v} f d\mathbf{v} \\
n(\mathbf{r},t)T(\mathbf{r},t) &amp;= \int \frac{m}{3k_{B}}\mathbf{v}^{2}f d\mathbf{v}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

From a purely mathematical point of view, however, the two sets of functions are not necessarily the same for &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; (for &lt;math&gt;\epsilon = 0&lt;/math&gt; they are equal by definition). Indeed, proceeding systematically in the hierarchy, one finds that similarly to &lt;math&gt;f^{(0)}&lt;/math&gt;, each &lt;math&gt;f^{(n)}&lt;/math&gt; also contains arbitrary functions of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; whose relation to the physical hydrodynamic fields is ''a priori'' unknown. One of the key simplifying assumptions of Chapman–Enskog theory is to ''assume'' that these otherwise arbitrary functions can be written in terms of the ''exact'' hydrodynamic fields and their spatial gradients. In other words, the space and time dependence of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; enters only implicitly through the hydrodynamic fields. This statement is physically plausible, since for small Knudsen numbers, one expects to enter the hydrodynamic regime in which the state of the gas is determined solely by the hydrodynamic fields. In the case of &lt;math&gt;f^{(0)}&lt;/math&gt;, the functions &lt;math&gt;n'(\mathbf{r},t)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}'_{0}(\mathbf{r},t)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;T'(\mathbf{r},t)&lt;/math&gt; are assumed exactly equal to the physical hydrodynamic fields.

While these assumptions are physically plausible, there is the question of whether solutions which satisfy these properties actually exist. More precisely, one must show that solutions exist satisfying

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\int \sum_{n=1}^{\infty }\epsilon^{n}f^{(n)}d\mathbf{v}= 0 = \int \sum_{n=1}^{\infty }\epsilon^{n}f^{(n)}\mathbf{v}^{2}d\mathbf{v}  \\
\int \sum_{n=1}^{\infty }\epsilon^{n}f^{(n)}v_{i}d\mathbf{v} = 0, \qquad i \in \{x,y,z\}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, even if such solutions exist, there remains the additional question of whether they span the complete set of normal solutions to the Boltzmann equation, i.e. do not represent an artificial restriction of the original expansion in &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;. One of the key technical achievements of Chapman–Enskog theory is to answer both of these questions in the positive.&lt;ref name="Grad1958"/&gt; Thus, at least at the formal level, there is no loss of generality in the Chapman–Enskog approach. 

With these formal considerations established, one can proceed to calculate &lt;math&gt;f^{(1)}&lt;/math&gt;. The result is&lt;ref name="Chapman1970"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
f^{(1)}=\left[ -\frac{1}{n}\left( \frac{2k_{B}T}{m}\right) ^{1/2}\mathbf{A(\mathbf{v})\cdot \nabla \ln }T\mathbf{-}\frac{2}{n}\mathbb{B(\mathbf{v})\colon \nabla }\mathbf{v}_{0} \right] f^{(0)},
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{v})&lt;/math&gt; is a vector and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{B}(\mathbf{v})&lt;/math&gt; a [[tensor]], each a solution of a linear inhomogeneous [[integral equation]] that can be solved explicitly by a polynomial expansion. Note that the colon denotes the [[Dyadics|double dot product]], &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T} : \mathbb{T'} = \sum_i \sum_j T_{ij}T'_{ji}&lt;/math&gt; for tensors &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T'}&lt;/math&gt;.

With these results, it is straightforward to obtain the Navier–Stokes equations. Taking velocity moments of the Boltzmann equation leads to the ''exact'' balance equations for the hydrodynamic fields &lt;math&gt;n(\mathbf{r},t)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_0(\mathbf{r},t)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;T(\mathbf{r},t)&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial n}{\partial t}+\nabla \cdot\left( n\mathbf{v}_0\right) &amp;= 0 \\
\frac{\partial \mathbf{v}_0}{\partial t}+ \mathbf{v}_0\cdot \nabla \mathbf{v}_0-\mathbf{F}+\frac{1}{n}\nabla \cdot \mathbf{\sigma} &amp;= 0  \\
\frac{\partial T}{\partial t}+\mathbf{v}_0\cdot \nabla T+\frac{2}{3k_{B}n}\left( \mathbf{\sigma :}\nabla \mathbf{v}_0+\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q}\right) &amp;= 0. 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

As in the previous section the colon denotes the double dot product, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T} : \mathbb{T'} = \sum_i \sum_j T_{ij}T'_{ji}&lt;/math&gt;. Substituting the Chapman–Enskog expressions for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, one arrives at the Navier–Stokes equations.

===Comparison with experiment===

An important prediction of Chapman–Enskog theory is that viscosity is independent of density (this can be seen for each molecular model in table 1, but is actually model-independent). This surprising result traces back to [[James Clerk Maxwell]], who inferred it in 1860 on the basis of more elementary kinetic arguments.&lt;ref&gt; {{Citation

On the other hand, the theory predicts that &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; does depend on temperature. For rigid elastic spheres, the predicted scaling is &lt;math&gt;\mu \propto T^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;, while other models typically show greater variation with temperature. For instance, for molecules repelling each other with force &lt;math&gt;\propto r^{-\nu}&lt;/math&gt; the predicted scaling is &lt;math&gt;\mu \propto T^s&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;s = 1/2 + 2/(\nu - 1)&lt;/math&gt;. Taking &lt;math&gt;s = 0.668&lt;/math&gt;, corresponding to &lt;math&gt;\nu \approx 12.9&lt;/math&gt;, shows reasonable agreement with the experimentally observed scaling for helium. For more complex gases the agreement is not as good, most likely due to the neglect of attractive forces.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman &amp; Cowling, pp. 230-232&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, the [[Lennard-Jones potential|Lennard-Jones model]], which does incorporate attractions, can be brought into closer agreement with experiment (albeit at the cost of a more opaque &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; dependence; see the Lennard-Jones entry in table 1).&lt;ref&gt;Chapman &amp; Cowling, pp. 235-237&lt;/ref&gt; 

Chapman–Enskog theory also predicts a simple relation between &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; in the form &lt;math&gt;\lambda = f \mu c_v&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;c_v&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Heat capacity| specific heat]] at constant volume and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a purely numerical factor. For spherically symmetric molecules, its value is predicted to be very close to &lt;math&gt;2.5&lt;/math&gt; in a slightly model-dependent way. For instance, rigid elastic spheres have &lt;math&gt;f \approx 2.522&lt;/math&gt;, and molecules with repulsive force &lt;math&gt;\propto r^{-13}&lt;/math&gt; have &lt;math&gt;f \approx 2.511&lt;/math&gt; (the latter deviation is ignored in table 1). The special case of [[Maxwell molecule|Maxwell molecules]] (repulsive force &lt;math&gt;\propto r^{-5}&lt;/math&gt;) has &lt;math&gt;f = 2.5&lt;/math&gt;  exactly.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman &amp; Cowling, pp. 247&lt;/ref&gt; Since &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;c_v&lt;/math&gt; can be measured directly in experiments, an easy experimental test of Chapman–Enskog theory is to measure &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; for the spherically symmetric [[noble gas|noble gases]]. Table 2 shows that there is reasonable agreement between theory and experiment.&lt;ref name="ChapmanandCowlingpage249"&gt;Chapman &amp; Cowling p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extensions==

The basic principles of Chapman–Enskog theory can be extended to more diverse physical models, including gas mixtures and molecules with internal degrees of freedom. In the high-density regime, the theory can be adapted to account for collisional transport of momentum and energy, i.e. transport over a molecular diameter ''during'' a collision, rather than over a mean free path (''in between'' collisions). Including this mechanism predicts a density dependence of the viscosity at high enough density, which is also observed experimentally.

One can also carry out the theory to higher order in the Knudsen number. In particular, the third-order contribution &lt;math&gt;f^{(2)}&lt;/math&gt; has been calculated by Burnett.&lt;ref name="Burnett"&gt;{{Citation

A '''cleanroom''' or '''clean room''' is a facility ordinarily utilized as a part of specialized industrial production or scientific research, including the manufacture of pharmaceutical items and microprocessors. Cleanrooms are designed to maintain extremely low levels of particulates, such as dust, airborne organisms, or vaporized particles. Cleanrooms typically have an cleanliness level quanitified by the number of particles per cubic meter at a predetermined molecule measure. The ambient outdoor air in a typical urban area contains 35,000,000 particles for each cubic meter in the size range 0.5 μm and bigger in measurement, equivalent to an ISO 9 cleanroom, while by comparison an ISO 1 cleanroom permits no particles in that size range and just 12 particles for each cubic meter of 0.3 μm and smaller.

==History==
The modern cleanroom was invented by American [[physicist]] [[Willis Whitfield]].&lt;ref name=nkwes&gt;{{cite news|first=William|last=Yardley|title=Willis Whitfield, Clean Room Inventor, Dies at 92 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/05/business/willis-whitfield-clean-room-inventor-dies-at-92.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2012-12-04 |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As employee of the [[Sandia National Laboratories]], Whitfield created the initial plans for the cleanroom in 1960.&lt;ref name=nkwes/&gt; Prior to Whitfield's invention, earlier cleanrooms often had problems with particles and unpredictable [[airflow]]s. Whitfield designed his cleanroom with a constant, highly filtered air flow to flush out impurities.&lt;ref name=nkwes/&gt; Within a few years of its invention in the 1960s, Whitfield's modern cleanroom had generated more than 50 billion USD in sales worldwide.&lt;ref name=kwes&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Sandia physicist, cleanroom inventor dies at 92 |url=http://www.kwes.com/story/20187574/sandia-physicist-cleanroom-inventor-dies-at-92 |work=[[KWES-TV|KWES]] |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=2012-11-26 |accessdate=2012-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mwgroup.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/reinraum_printline_02_2015_Whitfield_110416.pdf|title=Willis Whitfield - Father of the Cleanroom|date=September 2015|publisher=Cleanroom online|accessdate=2016-05-18}}&lt;!--Document specified as "02-2015", pathway as 2014-11, http date as 2016-04-19 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the integrated circuit manufacturing facilities in Silicon Valley were made by three companies: MicroAire, PureAire, and Key Plastics.  These competitors made laminar flow units, glove boxes, clean rooms and air showers, along with the chemical tanks and benches used in the 'Wet Process' building of integrated circuits.  These three companies were the pioneers of the use of [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]] for airguns, chemical pumps, scrubbers, water guns, and other devices needed for the production of [[integrated circuit]s. William (Bill) C. McElroy Jr. worked as engineering manager, drafting room supervisor, QA/QC, and designer for all three companies and his designs added 45 original patents to the technology of the time.  McElroy also wrote a four page article for MicroContamination Journal, wet processing training manuals, and equipment manuals for wet processing and clean rooms.&lt;ref&gt;William (Bill) C.

==Overview==
Cleanrooms can be very large. Entire manufacturing facilities can be contained within a cleanroom with factory floors covering thousands of square meters. They are used extensively in [[Fabrication (semiconductor)|semiconductor manufacturing]], [[biotechnology]], the [[life sciences]], and other fields that are very sensitive to environmental contamination. There are also modular cleanrooms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mecart-cleanrooms.com/what-is-a-cleanroom/ What is a modular cleanroom?]&lt;/ref&gt;

The air entering a cleanroom from outside is [[filter (air)|filter]]ed to exclude dust, and the air inside is constantly recirculated through high-efficiency particulate air ([[HEPA]]) and/or ultra-low particulate air ([[ULPA]]) filters to remove internally generated contaminants.

Staff enter and leave through [[airlock]]s (sometimes including an [[air shower (room)|air shower]] stage), and wear protective clothing such as hoods, face masks, gloves, boots, and coveralls.

Equipment inside the cleanroom is designed to generate minimal air contamination. Only special [[mop]]s and [[bucket]]s are used. Cleanroom furniture is designed to produce a minimum of particles and is easy to clean.

Common materials such as [[paper]], [[pencil]]s, and [[Textile|fabric]]s made from natural fibers are often excluded, and alternatives used. Cleanrooms are not [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterile]] (i.e., free of uncontrolled microbes);&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/09/science/09clea.html?ref=science In NASA’s Sterile Areas, Plenty of Robust Bacteria] New York Times, 9. October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; only airborne particles are controlled. Particle levels are usually tested using a [[particle counter]] and microorganisms detected and counted through environmental monitoring methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Sandle, T |title=Application of quality risk management to set viable environmental monitoring frequencies in biotechnology processing and support areas|journal=[[PDA (journal)|PDA J Pharm Sci Technol]] |volume=66 |issue=6 |pages=560–79|date=November 2012 |doi=10.5731/pdajpst.2012.00891}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sandle, T 392–403"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Sandle, T |title=A review of cleanroom microflora: types, trends, and patterns|journal=[[PDA (journal)|PDA J Pharm Sci Technol]] |volume=65 |issue=4 |pages=392–403|date=November 2011 |doi=10.5731/pdajpst.2011.00765}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polymer]] tools used in cleanrooms must be carefully determined to be [[Chemical compatibility|chemically compatible]] with cleanroom processing fluids &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heikkinen|first=Ismo T.S.|last2=Kauppinen|first2=Christoffer|last3=Liu|first3=Zhengjun|last4=Asikainen|first4=Sanja M.|last5=Spoljaric|first5=Steven|last6=Seppälä|first6=Jukka V.|last7=Savin|first7=Hele|date=2018-10|title=Chemical compatibility of fused filament fabrication-based 3-D printed components with solutions commonly used in semiconductor wet processing|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addma.2018.07.015|journal=Additive Manufacturing|volume=23|pages=99–107|doi=10.1016/j.addma.2018.07.015|issn=2214-8604|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as ensured to generate a low level of particle generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pasanen|first=T.P.|last2=von Gastrow|first2=G.|last3=Heikkinen|first3=I.T.S.|last4=Vähänissi|first4=V.|last5=Savin|first5=H.|last6=Pearce|first6=J.M.|date=2019-01|title=Compatibility of 3-D printed devices in cleanroom environments for semiconductor processing|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mssp.2018.08.027|journal=Materials Science in Semiconductor Processing|volume=89|pages=59–67|doi=10.1016/j.mssp.2018.08.027|issn=1369-8001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cleanrooms are kept at a [[positive pressure]] so if any leaks occur, air leaks out of the chamber instead of unfiltered air coming in.

Some cleanroom [[HVAC]] systems control the [[humidity]] to such low levels that extra equipment like [[Air_ioniser|air ionizers]] are required to prevent [[electrostatic discharge]] problems.

Low-level cleanrooms may only require special shoes, with completely smooth soles that do not track in dust or dirt. However, for safety reasons, shoe soles must not create slipping hazards. Access to a cleanroom is usually restricted to those wearing a [[cleanroom suit]].

In cleanrooms in which the standards of air contamination are less rigorous, the entrance to the cleanroom may not have an air shower. An anteroom (known as a "gray room") is used to put on clean-room clothing.

Some manufacturing facilities do not use fully classified cleanrooms, but use some practices or technologies typical of cleanrooms to meet their contamination requirements.

In [[Hospital]]s, [[Operating theater|Theatre]]s are similar to cleanroom for surgical patients' operation with [[Surgical incision|incisions]] to prevent any infections for the patient.

Cleanrooms maintain particulate-free air through the use of either [[HEPA]] or [[ULPA]] filters employing laminar or turbulent air flow principles. Laminar, or unidirectional, air flow systems direct filtered air downward or in horizontal direction in a constant stream towards filters located on walls near the cleanroom floor or through raised perforated floor panels to be recirculated. Laminar air flow systems are typically employed across 80% of a cleanroom ceiling to maintain constant air processing. Stainless steel or other non shedding materials are used to construct laminar air flow filters and hoods to prevent excess particles entering the air. Turbulent, or non unidirectional, air flow uses both laminar air flow hoods and nonspecific velocity filters to keep air in a cleanroom in constant motion, although not all in the same direction. The rough air seeks to trap particles that may be in the air and drive them towards the floor, where they enter filters and leave the cleanroom environment. US FDA and EU have laid down guidelines and limit for microbial contamination which is very stringent to ensure freedom from microbial contamination in pharmaceutical products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pharmacistspharmajournal.org/2010/02/clean-room-classification-aspects-of.html Limits for Microbial load for clean room as per US FDA and EU Guidelines for pharmaceutical products]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thomasnet.com/articles/automation-electronics/Cleanroom-Air-Flow-Principles Cleanroom Air Flow Principles]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personnel contamination of cleanrooms==
{| class="centered"

The greatest threat to cleanroom contamination comes from the users themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.ansi.org/2015/07/cleanroom-and-controlled-environment/|title=Cleanroom and Controlled Environment Attire - ANSI Blog|date=2015-07-15|work=The ANSI Blog|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors, control of microorganisms is important, especially microorganisms likely to be deposited into the air stream from skin shedding. Studying cleanroom microflora is of importance for microbiologists and quality control personnel to assess changes in trends. Shifts in the types of microflora may indicate deviations from the “norm” such as resistant strains or problems with cleaning practices.

In assessing cleanroom microorganisms, the typical flora are primarily those associated with human skin (Gram-positive cocci), although microorganisms from other sources such as the environment (Gram-positive rods) and water (Gram-negative rods) are also detected, although in lower number. Common bacterial genera include ''Micrococcus'', ''Staphylococcus'', ''Corynebacterium'', and ''Bacillus'', and fungal genera include ''Aspergillus'' and ''Pencillin''.&lt;ref name="Sandle, T 392–403"/&gt;

==Cleanroom classification and standardization==
Cleanrooms are classified according to the number and size of particles permitted per volume of air. Large numbers like "class 100" or "class 1000" refer to [[FED-STD-209E]], and denote the number of particles of size 0.5&amp;nbsp;µm or larger permitted per cubic foot of air. The standard also allows interpolation; for example [[SNOLAB]] is maintained as a class 2000 cleanroom.

A discrete, light-scattering airborne particle counter is used to determine the concentration of airborne particles, equal to and larger than the specified sizes, at designated sampling locations.

Small numbers refer to [[ISO 14644|ISO 14644-1]] standards, which specify the decimal [[logarithm]] of the number of particles 0.1&amp;nbsp;µm or larger permitted per m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of air. So, for example, an ISO class 5 cleanroom has at most 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; particles/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

Both FS 209E and ISO 14644-1 assume log-log relationships between particle size and particle concentration. For that reason, zero particle concentration does not exist. Some classes do not require testing some particle sizes, because the concentration is too low or too high to be practical to test for, but such blanks should not be read as zero.

Because 1&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is about 35&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, the two standards are mostly equivalent when measuring 0.5&amp;nbsp;µm particles, although the testing standards differ. Ordinary room air is around class 1,000,000 or ISO 9.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ee.byu.edu/cleanroom/particlecount.phtml Cleanroom Classification / Particle Count / FS209E / ISO TC209 /&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===ISO 14644-1 and ISO 14698===
[[ISO 14644|ISO 14644-1]] and [[ISO 14698]] are [[non-governmental organization|non-governmental]] standards developed by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=53394|title=ISO 14644-1:2015 - Cleanrooms and associated controlled environments -- Part 1: Classification of air cleanliness by particle concentration|website=ISO|access-date=2016-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former applies to clean rooms in general (see table below); the latter to cleanrooms where [[contamination|biocontamination]] may be an issue.

[[ISO 14644|ISO 14644-1]] defines the maximum concentration of particles per class and per particle size with the following formula&lt;ref name="Whyte2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=W. Whyte|title=Cleanroom Technology: Fundamentals of Design, Testing and Operation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ufEtmr1sBgC|date=17 October 2001|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-471-86842-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\text{C}_\text{N} = 10^{\text{N}} \left(\frac{0.1}{\text{D}}\right)^{2.08}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\text{C}_\text{N}&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum concentration of particles in a volume of 1m&lt;math&gt;^3&lt;/math&gt; of airborne particles that are equal to, or larger, than the considered particle size which is rounded to the nearest whole number, using no more than three significant figures, &lt;math&gt;\text{N}&lt;/math&gt; is the ISO class number, &lt;math&gt;\text{D}&lt;/math&gt; is the size of the particle in &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;m and 0.1 is a constant expressed in &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;m. The result for standard particle sizes is expressed in the following table.

'''Cognitive robotics ''' is concerned with endowing a robot with intelligent behavior by providing it with a processing architecture that will allow it to [[Robot learning|learn]] and reason about how to behave in response to complex goals in a complex world. Cognitive robotics may be considered the engineering branch of [[embodied cognitive science]] and [[embodied embedded cognition]].

==Core issues==

While traditional cognitive modeling approaches have assumed symbolic coding schemes as a means for depicting the world, translating the world into these kinds of symbolic representations has proven to be problematic if not untenable. [[philosophy of perception|Perception]] and [[motor cognition|action]] and the notion of [[Mental representation|symbolic representation]] are therefore core issues to be addressed in cognitive robotics.

==Starting point==

Cognitive robotics views animal cognition as a starting point for the development of robotic information processing, as opposed to more traditional [[Artificial Intelligence]] techniques. Target robotic cognitive capabilities include perception processing, attention allocation, [[anticipation (artificial intelligence)|anticipation]], planning, complex motor coordination, reasoning about other agents and perhaps even about their own mental states. Robotic cognition embodies the behavior of [[intelligent agent]]s in the physical world (or a virtual world, in the case of simulated cognitive robotics). Ultimately the robot must be able to act in the real world.

==Learning techniques==

===Motor Babble===
{{main|Motor babbling}}

A preliminary robot learning technique called [[motor babbling]] involves correlating pseudo-random complex motor movements by the robot with resulting visual and/or auditory feedback such that the robot may begin to ''expect'' a pattern of sensory feedback given a pattern of motor output. Desired sensory feedback may then be used to inform a motor control signal. This is thought to be analogous to how a baby learns to reach for objects or learns to produce speech sounds. For simpler robot systems, where for instance inverse kinematics may feasibly be used to transform anticipated feedback (desired motor result) into motor output, this step may be skipped.

===Imitation===

Once a robot can coordinate its motors to produce a desired result, the technique of ''learning by imitation'' may be used. The robot monitors the performance of another agent and then the robot tries to imitate that agent. It is often a challenge to transform imitation information from a complex scene into a desired motor result for the robot. Note that imitation is a high-level form of cognitive behavior and imitation is not necessarily required in a basic model of embodied animal cognition.

===Knowledge acquisition===

A more complex learning approach is "autonomous knowledge acquisition": the robot is left to explore the environment on its own. A system of goals and beliefs is typically assumed.

A somewhat more directed mode of exploration can be achieved by "curiosity" algorithms, such as Intelligent Adaptive Curiosity&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pyoudeyer.com/ims.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pyoudeyer.com/oudeyer-kaplan-neurorobotics.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; or Category-Based Intrinsic Motivation.&lt;ref&gt;http://science.slc.edu/~jmarshall/papers/cbim-epirob09.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; These algorithms generally involve breaking sensory input into a finite number of categories and assigning some sort of prediction system (such as an [[Artificial Neural Network]]) to each. The prediction system keeps track of the error in its predictions over time. Reduction in prediction error is considered learning. The robot then preferentially explores categories in which it is learning (or reducing prediction error) the fastest.

==Other architectures==

Some researchers in cognitive robotics have tried using architectures such as ([[ACT-R]] and [[Soar (cognitive architecture)]]) as a basis of their cognitive robotics programs. These highly modular symbol-processing architectures have been used to simulate operator performance and human performance when modeling simplistic and symbolized laboratory data. The idea is to extend these architectures to handle real-world sensory input as that input continuously unfolds through time. What is needed is a way to somehow translate the world into a set of symbols and their relationships.

==icb metric systematic manifold== 

drones or subatomic ai are some of the most controversial and greatest representation of sentient robotics and their processing or what the common people refer and believe in as  quantum computing or plutonic A.I. (not to be confused with platonic A.I.) use string theory or mass sentient (sentient, mass) relativity to conduct a universal occlusion called schripp  or string theory using schripp for the general process and purpose of creating A.I. or icb metric drones uses quantum relativity between two units to synchronize and assimilate a wavelength to cause universal fractal hyper conclusion and create an icb3 geometric manifold and conclude computing singularity units 
hypothetically for units to quantum compute icb3 metric numbers and code computers use a conjunction of high pitched AM frequency to randomize photogenic relay combined with a high axis accelerometer with the implementation and use of quantum source code and with inductive relay for reasoning skills that are very close to the geometric decision based system that the human race used for evolution 
inclusively space time to manifold and icb metric singularity are generally heard in a frequency that is beyond the range of human hearing

==Questions==

Some of the fundamental questions to still be answered in cognitive robotics are:
* How much human programming should or can be involved to support the learning processes?
* How can one quantify progress? Some of the adopted ways is the reward and punishment. But what kind of reward and what kind of punishment? In humans, when teaching a child for example, the reward would be candy or some encouragement, and the punishment can take many forms. But what is an effective way with robots?

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Items attached to paintings might include photographic images, clothing, newspaper clippings, [[ephemera]] or any number of [[Dimension|three-dimensional]] objects. The term is most closely associated with the artwork of American artist [[Robert Rauschenberg]] (1925–2008) who coined the phrase&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/25/arts/design/adding-rauschenberg-and-richter-at-moma.html?_r=0 ''New York Times'' October 24 2013 "“We are fortunate to have six Combines from the mid-’50s through 1961,” Ms. Temkin said, referring to the term Rauschenberg coined to describe works that incorporate castoff objects like tires, flatware or furniture."]&lt;/ref&gt; to describe his own creations. Rauschenberg’s Combines explored the blurry boundaries between art and the everyday world. In addition, his cross-medium creations challenged the doctrine of [[medium specificity]] mentioned by modernist art critic [[Clement Greenberg]]. [[Frank Stella]] created a large body of paintings that recall the combine paintings of [[Robert Rauschenberg]] by juxtaposing a wide variety of surface and material in each work ultimately leading to Stella's sculpture and architecture of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haberarts.com/schwitt.htm Unhappy Medium, Frank Stella and Kurt Schwitters by John Haber].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Schimmel of the [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art]] described Rauschenberg's ''Combine paintings'' as "some of the most influential, poetic and revolutionary works in the history of American art."&lt;ref name=tws08jan009/&gt; But they've also been called "ramshackle hybrids between painting and sculpture, stage prop and three-dimensional scrap-book assemblage" according to ''The Guardian''{{'}}s critic Adrian Searle.&lt;ref name=tws08jan009/&gt; Searle believed the "different elements of the Combines have been described as having no more relation than the different stories that vie for attention on a newspaper page."&lt;ref name=tws08jan009/&gt; Jasper Johns, as well, used similar techniques; in at least one painting, Johns attached a paintbrush right inside his painting.

Examples of Rauschenberg's ''Combine paintings'' include ''Bed'' (1955), ''Canyon'' (1959), and the free-standing ''[[Monogram (artwork)|Monogram]]'' (1955–1959).&lt;ref name=tws08jan001/&gt; Rauschenberg's works mostly incorporated [[two-dimensional]] materials held together with "splashes and drips of paint" with occasional 3-D objects.&lt;ref name=tws08jan001/&gt; Critic John Perreault wrote "The Combines are both painting and sculpture–or, some purists would say, neither."&lt;ref name=tws08jan001/&gt; Perreault liked them since they were memorable, photogenic, and could "stick in the mind" as well as "surprise and keep on surprising."&lt;ref name=tws08jan001/&gt; Rauschenberg added stuffed birds on his 1955 work ''Satellite'', which featured a stuffed pheasant "patrolling its top edge."&lt;ref name=tws08jan011/&gt; In another work, he added a ladder. His Combine ''Broadcast'', featuring three radios blaring at once,&lt;ref name=tws08jan010/&gt; was a "melange of paint, grids, newspaper clips and fabric snippets."&lt;ref name="tws08jan012"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one source, his ''Broadcast'' had three radios playing simultaneously, which produced a sort of irritating static, so that one of the work's owners, at one point, replaced the "noise" with tapes of actual programs when guests visited.&lt;ref name=tws08jan012/&gt; Rauschenberg's ''Bed'' had a pillow attached to a patchwork quilt with paint splashed over it.&lt;ref name=tws08jan010/&gt; The idea was to promote immediacy.&lt;ref name=tws08jan010/&gt;

The prevailing theme of Rauschenberg's "combine" paintings is ''"nonmeaning, the absurd, or antiart."'' In this regard the combine paintings relate to [[Pop art]] and their much earlier predecessor [[Dada]].&lt;ref&gt;Varieties of Visual Experience, Edmund Burke Feldman, Harry N.

''Canyon,'' one of Rauschenberg's most recognizable Combines, has been the subject of art historical debate revolving around the validity of reading Rauschenberg's work iconographically. Historian [[Kenneth Bendiner]] famously proposed ''Canyon'' as a playful recreation of a 1635 [[Rembrandt]] painting depicting the abduction of [[The Abduction of Ganymede|Ganymede]], interpreting the suspended pillow as Ganymede's buttocks and the stuffed bald eagle as the form assumed by the Greek god Zeus.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Robert Rauschenberg and the Neo-Avant-Garde|last=Branden|first=Joseph|publisher=MIT Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts, and London|pages=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians and critics, such as [[Joseph Branden]] have argued that searching for iconography in Rauschenberg's Combines is useless because it can be made to exist anywhere.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Bendiner's interpretation is discredited for failing to account for compositional movement and for disregarding a number of elements within the work, for example the blue and red text in the center, in order to mould the interpretation to it.

Interpretations of Rauschenberg's Combines vary from: a deeply personal and subjective collage of expression (often homoerotic), to a surface of indecipherable, or rather infinitely cipher-able, materials which challenge notions of painting, sculpture, reception, and chance, to a multivalent iconographic landscape that seems to resist fixed decoding in favor of a more open-ended play of meaning. Rauschenberg himself states "I don't want a painting to be just an expression of my personality. I feel it ought to be much better than that … I’ve always felt as though, whatever I’ve used and whatever I’ve done, the method was always closer to a ''collaboration'' with materials than to any kind of conscious manipulation and control."&lt;ref&gt;Rauschenberg quoted in Calvin Tomkins, ‘Profiles: Moving Out,’ ''The New Yorker'', vol.40, 29 Feb. 1964, p.59.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Moira Roth]] links the Combines to [[Marcel Duchamp|Duchamp's]] indifferent attitude in art, arguing that the perceived density of the content, and the integration of mass media elements is a facade born out of the alienation and indifference experienced by the artist during the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy Period]]. Jonathan Katz argues that underneath the impersonal and inexpressive appearance of his work is a secret homosexual code that can unlock some of the significance of Rauschenberg's work,&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Katz: ‘Lovers and Divers’ (1998) p.24&lt;/ref&gt; but Ed Krčma points out the weakness of steering the analysis towards preconceived conclusions, especially since Rauschenberg's work is described as a poetry of infinite possibilities.

More recent interpretations of ''Canyon,'' reconsider the work in [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] terms, claiming that the Combine works more like a human mind than a human eye; Fragmented scraps of images, news cutouts, found objects and paint interact in esoteric ways and more closely resemble a cerebral process than a 'traditional' image. Yve-Alain Bois calls the search for iconographic meaning in Rauschenberg's work misguided because it is too limiting. His art's "lack of center" is a statement in itself, and the infinite permutations of meaning that can result highlight the subjectivity of art reception that postmodernism explores.&lt;ref&gt;Bois, Yve-Alain. "Eye to the Ground." Artforum International. Artforum Inc. March, 2006. p.246-247&lt;/ref&gt;

===Additional note===

Under U.S. law, ''Canyon'' can never be sold since it contains a stuffed bald eagle, violating the 1940 [[Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act]] as well as the 1918 [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918|Migratory Bird Treaty Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnews.com/2012/05/01/rauschenberg-eagle-ruffles-feathers/|title=Rauschenberg Eagle Ruffles Feathers|last=Kinsella|first=Eileen|date=January 5, 2012|website=Art News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cowles Foundation for Research in Economics''' is an [[economic]] [[research institute]] at [[Yale University]]. It was founded in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]] in 1932 by [[Alfred Cowles]], a businessman and economist, as the Cowles Commission for Research in Economics. In 1939, the Cowles Commission moved to the [[University of Chicago]] under the directorship of [[Theodore O. Yntema]]. [[Jacob Marschak]] took over as director in 1943 until 1948, when it was passed over to [[Tjalling C. Koopmans]]. Rising hostile opposition to the Cowles Commission by the department of economics at University of Chicago during the 1950s led Koopmans to convince the Cowles family to move it to [[Yale University]] in 1955 (where it was renamed the Cowles Foundation).{{ref|newschool}}

As its motto (''Theory and Measurement'') indicates, the Cowles Commission was dedicated to the pursuit of linking [[economic theory]] to mathematics and statistics. Its main contributions to economics lie in its creation and consolidation of two important fields: [[general equilibrium theory]] and [[econometrics]].

The thrust of the Cowles approach was a specific, probabilistic framework in estimating [[simultaneous equations]] to model an economy.  Its ultimate goal in doing so was to gain [[economic policy|policy]] insight.  The Cowles approach structured its models from a priori economic theory.  One of its main contributions was in exposing the [[estimator bias|bias]] of [[ordinary least squares]] regression in [[parameter identification problem|identifying]] coefficient estimates.  Consequently, Cowles researchers developed new methods such as the [[indirect least squares]], [[instrumental variable]] methods, the full information [[maximum likelihood]] method, and the limited information maximum likelihood method.  All of these methods used theoretical, a priori restrictions. According to an article by Carl F. Christ, the Cowles approach was grounded on the following assumptions: 1, simultaneous economic behavior; 2, linear or logarithmic equations and disturbances; 3, systematic, observable variables without error; 4, discrete variable changes as opposed to continuous; 5, a priori determination of [[exogeny|exogeneity]] and [[endogeneity (econometrics)|endogeneity]]; 6, the existence of a [[reduced form]]; 7, independence of the [[explanatory variable]]s; 8, a priori identified [[structural equation]]s; 9, [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] disturbances with zero means, finite and constant [[covariance]]s, a [[nonsingular]] [[covariance matrix]], and [[serial correlation|serial independence]]; 10, a [[Lyapunov stability|dynamically stable]] system of equations.{{ref|Christ}}

Several Cowles associates have won [[Nobel prize]]s for research done while at the Cowles Commission. These include [[Tjalling Koopmans]], [[Kenneth Arrow]], [[Gérard Debreu]], [[James Tobin]], [[Franco Modigliani]], [[Herbert A. Simon]], [[Joseph E. Stiglitz]], [[Lawrence Klein]], [[Trygve Haavelmo]], [[Leonid Hurwicz]] and [[Harry Markowitz]].

The Cowles Foundation is located at 30 [[Hillhouse Avenue]], [[New Haven, Connecticut]].

Cryoconservation of livestock genetic resources is primarily done in order to preserve the genetics of populations of interest, such as indigenous breeds, also known as local or minor breeds. Material may be stored because individuals shared specific genes and phenotypes that may be of value or have potential value for researchers or breeders. Therefore, one of the main goals remains preserving the gene pool of local breeds that may be threatened.&lt;ref&gt;Verrier, E., Danchin-Burge, C., Moureaux, S., Ollivier, L., Tixier-Boichard, M., Boichard, D., ... &amp; Clement, F. 2003.

==Description==
Cryoconservation is the process of freezing cells and tissues using liquid nitrogen to achieve extreme low temperatures with the intent of using the preserved sample to prevent the loss of genetic diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Yawn, David H. "Cryopreservation." Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica, n.d. Web. May 19, 2016. http://www.britannica.com/technology/cryopreservation&lt;/ref&gt; Semen, embryos, oocytes, [[somatic cell]]s, [[nuclear DNA]], and other types of biomaterial such as blood and serum can be stored using cryopreservation, in order to preserve genetic materials.&lt;ref name=mazur /&gt;&lt;ref name=solti /&gt; The primary benefit of cryoconservation is the ability to save germplasms for extended periods of time, therefore maintaining the genetic diversity of a species or breed.&lt;ref name=peter/&gt; There are two common techniques of cryopreservation: slow freezing and vitrification. Slow freezing helps eliminate the risk of intracellular ice crystals.&lt;ref name=loutradi&gt;Loutradi, E. M., E. M. Kolibianakis, C. A. Venetis, E. G. Papanikolau, G. Pados, I. Bontis, and B.C.

==Value==
Cryoconservation is an indispensable tool in the storage of genetic material of animal origin and will continue to be useful for the conservation of livestock into the future. Cryoconservation serves as a way to preserve germplasms, which is particularly beneficial for threatened breeds. Indigenous livestock may be conserved for a variety of reasons, including the preservation of local genetics, their importance in local traditions and their value to the culture identity and heritage of the area.&lt;ref&gt;Oldenbroek, Kor, ed. Utilisation and Conservation of Farm Animal Genetic Resources. Wegeningen Academic Publisher, 2007. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of regional livestock diversity could increase instability, decreases future possibilities and challenge production systems.&lt;ref name=men /&gt; Moreover, the maintenance of indigenous breeds can aid in the preservation of traditional lifestyles and livelihoods, even providing income through cultural tourism.&lt;ref&gt;Rahman, Gerold."Contribution of Rural Tourism to the Market for Livestock Products in LFAs in Germany." The James Hutton Institute. Livestock Systems in Integrated Rural Development, n.d. Web. May 16, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous breeds can contribute to local economies and production systems by utilising land that is unsuitable for crop production to produce food products, as well as providing hides, manure and draft power. Therefore, the conservation and progression of these breeds are of the utmost importance for food security and sustainability.&lt;ref name=global /&gt;

Another beneficial factor in cryoconservation of indigenous livestock is in terms of food security and economic development.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, K., T. Collins, S. Dion, H. Reynolds, S. Riess, A. Stanzyk, A. Wolfe, S. Lonergan, P. Boettcher, U. R. Charrondiere, and B. Stadimayr.

Animal Frontiers Oct. 2012: 54–60. American Society of Animal Science.
  Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous livestock often have beneficial traits related to adaptation to local climate and diseases that can be incorporated into major breeds through cryoconservation practices.&lt;ref&gt;Bett, Rawlynce, Mwai Okeyo, Birgitta Malmfors, Kjell Johansson, Morris Agaba, Donald Kugonza, A.K.F.H. Bhuiyan, Anibal Filho, Arthur Mariante, Fidalis Mujibi, and Jan Philipsson. "[http://www.mdpi.com/2079-9276/2/3/335htm Cattle Breeds: Extinction or Quasi-Extant?]" Resources 2.3 (2013): 335–57. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Cryoconservation is a favorable strategy because it allows germplasms to be stored for extended periods of time in a small confined area. An additional benefit of cryoconservation is the ability to preserve the biological material of both maternal and paternal cells and maintain viability over extended periods of time.&lt;ref name=mazur /&gt;&lt;ref name=men /&gt; Cryoconservation has been successfully used as a conservation strategy for species and breeds that have since been endangered. One drawback is that cryoconservation can only be done if preparation has taken place in advance.&lt;ref name=solti /&gt; With proper preparation of collecting and maintaining genetic material, this method is very beneficial for the conservation of rare and endangered livestock. Cryoconservation can serve as a contingency plan when a breed population needs to be restored or when a breed has become extinct, as well as for breed improvement. This process benefits companies and researchers by making genetic materials available.&lt;ref name=cryo /&gt;

The support of numerous stakeholders make this process possible in the establishment and operations of cryoconservation. Before every phase is executed, all participating stakeholders must be briefed to understand the possible phase impending. This would include informing the stakeholders of their responsibilities and receiving their consent for the cryoconservation process.&lt;ref name=cryo /&gt; The possible stakeholders within the cryoconservation process could include:

{{col-break}}
*The State-the government acquires responsibility for conservation of animal genetic resources&lt;ref name=cryo /&gt;
*Individual Livestock Keepers and Breed Associations-individual livestock keepers are commonly the primary owners of the livestock whose germplasm is used for processes of cryoconservation. Breed Associations would be interested in the well-being of their respective breeds in short and long terms. Through this interest these associations may provide financial and organizational support for the cryoconservation process.&lt;ref name=strategies /&gt;

==Methods==
===Collection===
There are several ways to collect the genetic materials based on which type of germplasm.

==== Semen ====
[[Freezing semen]] is a commonly used technique in the modern animal agriculture industry, which is well researched with established methods&lt;ref&gt;Bowen, R. "Collection and Evaluation of Semen: Introduction and Index." Collection and Evaluation of Semen. Colorado State University, January 27, 2003. Web. May 13, 2016. http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/reprod/semeneval/&lt;/ref&gt; Semen is often collected using an [[artificial vagina]], [[electroejaculation]], gloved-hand technique, abdominal stroking, or epididymal sperm collection. Preferred collection techniques vary based on species and available tools.  Patience and technique are keys to successful collection of semen.&lt;ref name="sites.ext.vt.edu"&gt;Estienne, Mark, and Allen Harper. "Swine Artificial Insemination Programs: Techniques for Training Boars for Semen Collection." Swine Artificial Insemination Programs: Techniques for Training Boars for Semen Collection. Virginia Cooperative Extension, Jan. 2000. Web. May 17, 2016. http://www.sites.ext.vt.edu/newsletter-archive/livestock/aps-00_01/aps-0178.html&lt;/ref&gt; There are several styles and types of artificial vaginas that can be used depending on the breed and species of the male. During this process the penis enters a tube that is the approximate pressure and temperature of the female's vagina. There is a disposable bag inside the tube that collects the semen. During this process it may be beneficial to have a teaser animal—an animal used to sexually tease but not impregnate the animal—to increase the arousal of the male.&lt;ref name="sites.ext.vt.edu"/&gt; Electroejaculation is a method of [[semen collection]] in the cattle industry because it yields high quality semen. However, this process requires the animal to be trained and securely held, thus it is not ideal when working with wild or feral animals. When performing this process the electroejaculator is inserted into the rectum of the male.&lt;ref&gt;Rouge, Melissa, and R. Bowen. "Semen Collection." Semen Collection. Colorado State University, August 11, 2002. Web. May 13, 2016. http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/reprod/semeneval/collection.html&lt;/ref&gt; The electroejaculator stimulates the male causing an ejaculation, after which the semen is collected. The glove hand collection technique is used mainly in the swine industry. During this process, the boar mounts a dummy, while the handler grasps the penis of the boar between the ridges of his fingers and collects the semen.&lt;ref&gt;"Collecting Semen from Boars." The State of Queensland (Department of Agriculture and Fisheries). Queensland Government, July 2, 2002. Web. May 13, 2016. https://www.daf.qld.gov.au/animal-industries/pigs/improving-your-herd-with-genetics/collecting-semen-from-boars&lt;/ref&gt; Abdominal stroking is exclusively used in the poultry industry. During the technique, one technician will hold the bird, while a second technician massages the bird's cloaca.&lt;ref&gt;Miyumo, Sophie. "Artificial Insemination in Chicken."

May 13, 2016.http://www.incip.org/index.php/component/k2/item/88-artificial-insemination-in-chicken&lt;/ref&gt; However, feces and semen both exit the male bird's body through the cloaca, so the semen quality is often low.&lt;ref&gt;"Cloaca." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica, n.d. Web. May 17, 2016. http://www.britannica.com/science/cloaca&lt;/ref&gt;

====Embryo====
Embryo collection is more demanding and requires more training than semen collection because the female reproductive organs are located inside of the body cavity. Superovulation is a technique used in order to have a female release more oocytes than normal. This can be achieved by using hormones to manipulate the female's reproductive organs. The hormones used are typically gonadotropin-like, meaning they stimulate the gonads.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Andrew J., and Sherrill E. Echternkamp. "[http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1153&amp;context=hruskareports Superovulation of Cows by Initiating FSH Treatments During the First Few Days After Estrus]." Published
  in Beef Research Program Progress Report 4 (1993): 80–82. U.S. Department of Agriculture: Agriculture Research Services. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Follicle stimulating hormone is the preferred hormone in cattle, sheep and goats. While in pigs, equine chorionic gonadotropin is preferred. However, this is not commonly done in the swine industry because gilts and sows (female pigs) naturally ovulate more than one oocyte at one time. Superovulation can be difficult because not all females will respond the same way and success will vary by species. Once the female has released the oocytes, they are fertilized internally—in vivo—and flushed out of her body. In vivo fertilization is more successful than in vitro fertilization.&lt;ref&gt;Pomar, F.j. Rubio, K.j. Teerds, A. Kidson, B. Colenbrander, T. Tharasanit, B. Aguilar, and B.AJ. Roelen. "[https://www.academia.edu/download/43066004/Differences_in_the_incidence_of_apoptosi20160225-25808-16hrutw.pdf Differences in the Incidence of Apoptosis between in Vivo and in Vitro Produced Blastocysts of Farm Animal Species: A Comparative Study]."

Direct. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; In cattle, usually 10 or more embryos are removed from the flushing process. In order to flush the uterus, a technician will first seal off the female's cervix and add fluid, which allows the ovum to be flushed out of the uterine horns and into a cylinder for analysis. This process typically takes 30 minutes or less.&lt;ref&gt;Selk, Glenn. Embryo Transfer in Cattle. N.d. Fact Sheet. Oklahoma State University Extension Service. PDF. Web.

Web.&lt;/ref&gt; It is crucial technicians handle the embryos with care and freeze them within 3–4 hours in order to preserve viability of the greatest percentage of embryos.&lt;ref name=cryo /&gt;

====Oocytes====
Oocytes can be collected from most mammalian species. Conventional oocyte collection is when ovaries are removed from a donor animal; this is done posthumously in slaughter facilities.&lt;ref name=invitro &gt;"In Vitro Embryos from Unknown Oocyte Source." C.A.S.E. Reproductive Services. University of Wisconsin-Madison, n.d. Web. May 14, 2016. http://www.ansci.wisc.edu/jjp1/ansci_repro/misc/project_websites_fa06/tues06/oocyte/IVF.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The ovaries are kept warm as they are brought back to a laboratory for oocyte collection. Keeping the ovaries warm helps increase the success rate of fertilization.&lt;ref name=invitro /&gt; Once collected the oocytes are assessed and categorized into small, medium, and large, and then matured for 20–23 hours.&lt;ref&gt;Farsi, Mir Mehrdad, Nematollah Kamali, and Mohsen Pourghasem. "[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3920538/ Embryological Aspects of Oocyte In Vitro Maturation]."International Journal of Molecular and Cellular Medicine 2.3 (2013): 99–109. US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health. Babol University of Medical Sciences. Web. May 19, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; This simple, inexpensive technique can lead to about 24 oocytes collected from a bovine. Conventional oocyte collection is especially useful for females who unexpectedly die or who are incapable of being bred due to injury. A second option for oocyte collection is to utilize the transvaginal ultrasound guided oocyte collection method otherwise known as TUGA. Collection technique varies slightly by species, but the general methods for collection are the same; a needle is inserted into each ovarian follicle and pulled out via vacuum. The major benefit of using this method is the ability to expand the lifetime reproductive productivity, or the number of productive days an animal is in her [[estrous cycle]]. Pregnant cows and mares continue to develop new follicles until the middle of pregnancy. Thus, TUGA can be used to substantially increase the fitness of an individual because the female then has the potential produce more than one offspring per gestation.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Joel A., Shane Bellow, Marius Meintjes, Oscar Perez, Edward Ferguson, and Robert A. Godke."[https://www.arch-anim-breed.net/45/99/2002/aab-45-99-2002.pdf Transvaginal Ultrasound-guided Oocyte Aspiration for Production of Embryos in Vitro]." Leibniz Institute for Farm Animal Biology 45.1 (2002): 99–108. Research Gate. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Somatic cells====
Somatic cells are an additional resource which can be retrieved for gene banking, particularly in the cases of emergency wherein gametes cannot be collected or stored. Tissues can be taken from living animals or shortly after death. These tissues can be saved via cryopreservation or dehydrated. Blood cells can also be useful for DNA analysis such as comparing homozygosity&lt;ref&gt;Riley, Donald E. "DNA Testing: An Introduction For Non-Scientists." Scientific Testimony.

===Freezing===
There are two cryopreservation freezing methods: slow freezing and vitrification. [[File:Example freezing laboratory.png|thumb|Example freezing laboratory]]

====Slow freezing====
During slow freezing, cells are placed in a medium which is cooled below the freezing point using liquid nitrogen. This causes an ice mass to form in the medium. As the water in the medium freezes, the concentration of the sugars, salts, and cryoprotectant increase. Due to osmosis, the water from the cells enters the medium to keep the concentrations of sugars, salts, and cryoprotectant equal. The water that leaves the cells is eventually frozen, causing more water to diffuse out of the cell. Eventually, the unfrozen portion—cellular—becomes too viscous for ice crystals to form inside of the cell.&lt;ref name=cryo/&gt;

====Vitrification====
The second technique for cryoconservation is vitrification or flash freezing. Vitrification is the transformation from a liquid to solid state without the formation of crystals. The process and mechanics of vitrification are similar to slow freezing, the difference lying in the concentration of the medium. The vitrification method applies a selected medium which has a higher concentration of solute so the water will leave the cells via osmosis. The medium is concentrated enough so all of the intracellular water will leave without the medium needing to be reconcentrated. The higher concentration of the medium in vitrification allows the germplasms to be frozen more rapidly than with slow freezing. Vitrification is considered to be the more effective technique of freezing germplasms.&lt;ref name=loutradi/&gt;

==Facility design and equipment==
===Facility design===
[[File:Example of animal holding and collecting.png|thumb|Example of animal holding and collecting facility]]
When designing a facility, there are several things that should be kept in mind including biosecurity, worker safety and efficiency, and animal welfare. Diverse infrastructure is required in order to successfully collect and store genetic material. The buildings needed depend on the size of facilities as well as the extent of the operations.&lt;ref name=cryo /&gt;

====Biosecurity====
Biosecurity, a management measure used to prevent the transmission of diseases and disease agents on the facility, is important to keep in mind when designing a facility.&lt;ref&gt;
Floss, Jeanette L., and Roderick C. Tubbs. "Herd Management for Disease Prevention." Herd Management for Disease Prevention. University of Missouri-Columbia, July 1993. University of Missouri Extension Publication Number G2507 16 May 2016. URI:http://hdl.handle.net?10355/710.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to achieve a high level of biosecurity, collection facilities should be placed as far as possible from one another, as well as from farms. According to the FAO's recommendations, facilities should be "at least 3 km from farms or other biological risks and 1 km from main roads and railways".&lt;ref name=cryo /&gt; Separation between collection facilities and surrounding farms can improve biosecurity as pests, such as flies and mice, have the potential to travel from farm to facility and vice versa. Other disease agents may be able to travel through the air via wind, furthering the importance of separation of farms and proper air sanitation and ventilation. Additionally, a [[perimeter fence]] is used to prevent potential threats that could cause contamination to germplasms, such as unauthorized personnel or unwanted animals, from entering the facilities. Animals may be housed in [[pen (enclosure)|pens]] located inside or outside of a barn as long as they are contained within the perimeter fence. When interaction with outside objects, such as feed trucks or veterinary personnel, is necessary, complete sanitation is required to decrease the risk of contamination. There is always the possibility of disease spreading among the animals whose biological data is being collected or from animal to human. An example of a disease that can easily spread through germplasm is Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome, otherwise known as PRRS. A highly contagious disease between swine, PRRS causes millions of dollars to be lost annually by producers. The disease can be spread through boar semen.&lt;ref&gt;Yaeger, Michael J., Thomas Prieve, James Collins, Jane Christopher-Hennings, Eric Nelson, and Davis Benefield. "Evidence for the Transmission of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) Virus in Boar Semen." Swine Health and Production 1.5 (1993): 7–9. American Association of Swine Veterinarians. American Association of Swine Veterinarians. Web. 18 May.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, biosecurity is particularly important when genetic material will be inserted into another animal to prevent the spread of such diseases.

====Human considerations====
Worker safety is always a priority when handling livestock. Escape routes and alternative access throughout the facility are crucial for both the handlers and livestock.&lt;ref name=behaviour&gt;"Behavioural Principles of Handling Cattle and Other Grazing Anima ls Under Extensive Conditions." Livestock Handling and Transport. Ed. Temple Grandin. Wallingford: CABI, 2000. 67–68. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Germplasm storage and collection sites must include locker rooms for staff, which provide lockers, showers, and storage of clothing and footwear, in order to meet sanitation requirements.&lt;ref name=cryo /&gt;

====Animal considerations====
Animal housing practical when collecting germplasms because they keep donor animals in an easily accessible area, making the process of collecting germplasms easier and more efficient. The species and breeds of animals housed should be considered while planning the facility; facilities should be big enough to meet animal welfare standards, yet small enough to reduce human contact and increase ease of handling while reducing stress of the animal. As the process of collecting germplasm may take several days, the animal may become stressed causing a lower quality of genetic material to be obtained. Thus, training the animal to become familiar with the process is key.&lt;ref name=behaviour /&gt; Holding facilities for animals may also serve as a quarantine. Quarantine facilities are necessary in order to prevent the transmission of disease from animal to animal, animal to germplasm, germplasm to germplasm, and germplasm to animal. Introducing quarantine to separate the diseased animal(s) from the healthy should be done immediately. However, a quarantine does not always prevent the spread of disease.&lt;ref name=embryo/&gt;

====Temperature control and ventilation====
[[Temperature control]] and [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] should be included in the design of the holding and collection facilities to keep the animals comfortable and healthy, while limiting stress during the germplasm collection process. Ventilation serves as an effective way to keep clean airflow throughout the facilities and eliminate odors Temperature control helps regulate the air quality and humidity level inside the barn.&lt;ref name=cryo /&gt;

====Equipment====
A freezing and processing laboratory for genetic materials can be on the same site as the holding and collecting facility. However, the laboratory must have higher sanitation standards. According to the FAO, a proper germplasm laboratory should include the following.&lt;ref name=cryo /&gt;

{{col-begin|width=auto}}
{{col-break}}
*Washable work surfaces, floors (non-slip) and walls
*Sufficient lighting and ventilation
*Hot and cold, purified water
*Electrical sockets
*Adequate storage for consumable materials.&lt;ref name=cryo /&gt;
{{col-end}}

Cryopreservation requires equipment to collect biological material and test tubes for storage. Price is highly variable based on the quality of the collection and storage materials.&lt;ref name=Guide &gt;Brockbank, Dr. Kelvin G. M., James C. Covault, and Dr. Michael J. Taylor. "Cryoconservation Guide." Dr. Michael J. Taylor. Web. May 16, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The life expectancy of tools should be considered when determining costs.&lt;ref name=Guide /&gt; In addition to traditional laboratory equipment, the FAO also suggests the following:

{{col-begin|width=auto}}
{{col-break}}
*Disposable coveralls
*Portable incubator
*Haemocytometer
*Semen straws and filling/sealing equipment
*Liquid nitrogen storage tank
*Liquid nitrogen
*Liquid nitrogen dry-shipper
*Equipment for determining sperm concentration (one or more of the following three):
*Spectrophotometer (fixed or portable)
*Makler counter chamber (or disposable counting chamber)
*Haemocytometer
*Straw filling and sealing equipment
*Freezing equipment (manual or programmable)
*Carbon dioxide incubator (for embryos)
*Laminar flow benches (for embryos)
*Dry liquid nitrogen shipping tanks
*Long-term liquid nitrogen storage tanks.&lt;ref name=cryo /&gt;

==Limitations==
Cryoconservation is limited by the cells and tissues that can be frozen and successfully thawed. Cells and tissues that can be successfully frozen are limited by their surface area. To keep cells and tissues viable, they must be frozen quickly to prevent ice crystal formation. Thus, a large surface area is beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;Özkavukçu, Sinan, and Esra Erdemli. "Cryopreservation: Basic Knowledge And Biophysical Effects." Journal of Ankara Medical School 24.4 (2002): 187–96. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Another limitation is the species being preserved. There have been difficulties using particular methods of cryoconservation with certain species. For example, artificial insemination is more difficult in sheep than cattle, goats, pigs, or horses due to posterior folds in the cervix of ovines.&lt;ref name=Menzies/&gt; Cryopreservation of embryos is dependent on the species and the stage of development of the embryo. Pig embryos are the most difficult to freeze, thaw, and utilize produce live offspring due to their sensitivity to chilling and high lipid content.&lt;ref name=Mcevoy/&gt;

==Legal issues==
The collection and utilization of genetic materials requires clear agreements between stakeholders with regards to their rights and responsibilities.&lt;ref name=cryo /&gt; The FAO and others, such as Mendelsohn, suggests that governments establish policies with regards to livestock genetic resources and their collection, storage, distribution, and utilization are governments.&lt;ref name=cryo /&gt;&lt;ref name=men /&gt; The FAO also recommends that national or regional livestock industries establish an advisory committee to advise and provide recommendations on policy.  Livestock are traditionally a private good; in order to obtain ownership of genetic materials, gene banks have several strategies that they can deploy.&lt;ref name=cryo /&gt; Gene banks may either:
{{col-begin|width=auto}}
{{col-break}}
*buy the livestock in order to obtain and preserve genetic information
*have the germplasm donated by livestock owner
*pay a fee to the livestock owner for germplasm rights
*develop a contract with the livestock owner in order to obtain germplasm ownership only after set period of time, in order to prevent immediate acquisition of germplasm by competitors&lt;ref name=cryo /&gt;
One of the key elements of cryoconservation of livestock is open access to genetic materials, to make the resources of these conserved genetic materials accessible for utilization. Utilization should be based on sustainable use, development, and conservation, as well as improvement for the livestock industry.&lt;ref name=cryo /&gt; Government and non-governmental organizations recommend that genetic information should have open access for the following purposes:
{{col-begin|width=auto}}
{{col-break}}
*national public need
*non-research breeding by non-governmental organizations or private entities
*research for breed improvement, conservation of endangered breeds, and potential recovery of extinct breeds&lt;ref name=global /&gt;

==Examples==
===Hungarian Grey cattle===
An example of the use of cryoconservation to prevent the extinction of a livestock breed is the case of the [[Hungarian Grey cattle]], or Magya Szurke. Hungarian Grey cattle were once a dominant breed in southeastern Europe with a population of 4.9&amp;nbsp;million head in 1884. They were mainly used for draft power and meat. However, the population had decreased to 280,000 head by the end of [[World War II]] and eventually reached the low population of 187 females and 6 males from 1965 to 1970.&lt;ref name=solti /&gt; The breed's decreased use was due primarily to the [[mechanised agriculture|mechanization of agriculture]] and the adoption of major breeds, which yield higher milk production.&lt;ref&gt;Bartosiewicz, L. "[http://www.cattlenetwork.net/docs/agri/agri21_4.pdf The Hungarian Grey Cattle: A Traditional European Breed]." Animal Genetic Resources Information Anim. Genet. Resour. Inf. 21 (1997): 49–60. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hungarian government launched a project to preserve the breed, as it possesses valuable traits, such as stamina, calving ease, disease resistance, and easy adaptation to a variety of climates.&lt;ref name=solti /&gt;&lt;ref name=dadis&gt;"Magyar Szurke/Hungarian Grey." Domestic Animal Diversity Information System. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Web.

===The Gaur===
[[Gaur]], also known as the Indian bison, is the heaviest and most powerful of all wild cattle native to South and Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name=solti /&gt; It is indicated in field data that the population of mature animals is about 5,200–18,000.&lt;ref name=redlist&gt;Duckworth, J.W., Steinmetz, R., Timmins, R.J., Pattanavibool, A., Than Zaw, Do Tuoc &amp; Hedges, S. 2008. Bos gaurus. The International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources Red List of Threatened Species 2008: e.T2891A9491805&lt;/ref&gt; Male and female Gaur both have distinctive humps between the head and shoulders, a dorsal ridge, prominent horns, and a [[dewlap]] which extends to the front legs.The Gaur grows 60% faster than domestic cattle, meaning farmers meat can be harvested at a faster rate, making beef production two to three times more profitable. Gaur meat is preferred over other breeds' meat among local people. Another benefit of the bovine is that it has the ability to sweat and tolerates heat well.&lt;ref name=rainforest&gt;"Rainforest Beef." Integrated Conservation Research. Web. May 17, 2016. &lt;http://www.integratedconservationresearch.org/ICRIFiles/rainforestbeef.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Divine Action and Modern Science''''' (2002) is a book written by Nicholas Saunders. It looks at [[Near East]]ern biblical and modern theological approaches to the idea of [[Divine Providence|divine action]], covering such questions as how divine action occurs, what its effects are, the relationship between divine and finite causation and complementarity versus [[mutually exclusive|mutual exclusivity]]. Saunders concludes that God is active in the physical world, but not as described by traditional accounts.&lt;ref&gt;David Atkinson, Words and works, ''[[Times Literary Supplement]],'' January 9, 2004 issue 5258 p27(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

Through this book, Saunders differentiates between general and special divine action, with the former referring to the actions of God concerning the entirety of the natural order (initial creation and continual sustenance), and the latter pointing to the actions of God with regards to a particular time and place (such as a particular divine intervention or responses to prayer).

The author’s categorical disagreement with current endeavors to bring together special divine action (SDA) with quantum assumptions and chaos theory is reflected in the book, saying that people are still remotely far from a reasonable hypothesis of divine action in a world that is consonant with contemporary science. Nonetheless, Saunders presumes that God exists and is currently active in the world in a specific sense setting off new fundamental interactions in nature. The book’s writer further concedes that while people cannot ever seek to have inclusive comprehension of God’s action within the world, this should not be a reason for anyone to go to the opposite extreme and assert that God’s transcendence prohibits any evocative discussions of His actions.

== Key points ==
Essentially, ''Divine Action and Modern Science'' attempted to reconcile God and his actions with science. The book's main thesis is that Divine action should be considered an action upon and within nature. This being said, it is part of nature and, therefore, "the mechanics of describing such action, in some way, correlate with the mechanics of describing nature herself."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Epperson|first=Michael|date=October 2004|title=Book Review: Nicholas. Saunders,&amp;nbsp; Divine Action and Modern Science.|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/426996?journalCode=jr|journal=The Journal of Religion|language=en|volume=84|issue=4|pages=648–649|doi=10.1086/426996|issn=0022-4189|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saunders also drew from several theories on Divine Action such as those put forward by thinkers William Pollard, [[Nancey Murphy]], and [[Thomas M. Tracy|Thomas Tracy]], among others. In his discourse, the author – through the evidence provided by these scholars – concluded that for each Divine action, there is a scientific feasibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wesleywildman.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/docs/2003-Wildman-Review-of-Saunders-Divine-Action-and-Modern-Science.pdf|title=Divine Action and Modern Science|last=Wildman|first=Wesley|date=2002|website=Wesley Wildman|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, the book claimed that a scientific explanation of the Divine action could revolutionize theological traditions, making it more relevant and tenable in light of our modern understanding of the natural sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Divine Action and Modern Science|last=Saunders|first=Nicholas|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=0521801567|location=Cambridge|pages=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Summit on Sustainable Development''' ('''WSSD'''), or the '''ONG Earth Summit 2002''', took place in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa, from 26 August to 4 September 2002. It was convened to discuss [[sustainable development]] by the United Nations. WSSD gathered a number of leaders from business and non-governmental organizations, 10 years after the first [[Earth Summit]] in Rio de Janeiro. (It was therefore also informally nicknamed "Rio+10".)

==Declarations==
The [[Johannesburg Declaration]] was the main outcome of the Summit; however, there were several other international agreements.

It laid out the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation as an action plan.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/documents/WSSD_POI_PD/English/POIToc.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agreements==
Johannesburg, 27 August: agreement was made to restore the world's depleted fisheries for 2015. It was agreed to by negotiators at the World Summit. 

Instead of new agreements between governments, the Earth Summit was organized mostly around almost 300 "partnership initiatives" known as [[Type II Partnerships|Type II]], as opposed to Type I Partnerships which are the more classic outcome of international treaties.  These were to be the key means to achieve the [[Millennium Development Goals]].  These are kept in a database of Partnerships for Sustainable Development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webapps01.un.org/dsd/partnerships/public/welcome.do|title=United Nations Maintenance Page|author=|date=|website=webapps01.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. participation==
The absence of the United States rendered the summit partially impotent. [[George W. Bush]] boycotted the summit and did not attend. Except for a brief appearance by [[Colin Powell]], who hurriedly addressed the closing stages of the conference while his airplane taxied on the runway of Johannesburg International, the US government did not send a delegation, earning Bush praise in a letter from conservative organizations such as [[Americans for Tax Reform]], [[American Enterprise Institute]], and [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brainerd Dispatch, citing AP|title=Conservatives praise Bush for opting out of U.N. Earth Summit|url=http://brainerddispatch.com/stories/081502/nne_0815020004.shtml|accessdate=21 June 2011|agency=Associated Press|date=15 August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WWSD Info News|url=http://www.iisd.ca/wssd/infonews9.html|work=IISD|publisher=IISD.ca|accessdate=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The United Nations [[Conference on the Human Environment]], was first held in [[Stockholm]], Sweden, in June 1972, and marked the emergence of international environmental law. The Declaration on the Human Environment also known as the Stockholm Declaration set out the principles for various international environmental issues, including human rights, natural resource management, pollution prevention and the relationship between the environment and development. The conference also led to the creation of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]].

The [[Brundtland Commission]] set up by [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]], the pioneer of [[sustainable development]], provided the momentum for first [[Earth Summit]] 1992 &amp;ndash; the United Nations Conference on Environmental Development (UNCED), that was also headed by Maurice Strong, who had been a prominent member of the Brundtland Commission &amp;ndash; and also for [[Agenda 21]].

South Africa's first [[South African National Conference on Environment and Development|National Conference on Environment and Development]] entitled, "Ecologise Politics, Politicise Ecology" was held at the [[University of the Western Cape]] in conjunction with the [[Cape Town Ecology Group]] and the Western Cape Branch of the [[World Conference on Religion and Peace]] in 1991. Prominent persons involved in this conference were [[Ebrahim Rasool]], [[Cheryl Carolus]], Faried Esack, and Julia Martin.

The initial informal discussions on a possible new Summit in 2002 were held in February 1998 and hosted by Derek Osborn who co-chaired the preparatory meetings for Rio+5 and [[Stakeholder Forum for a Sustainable Future]]. A set of 10 governments started working informally to start putting together the possible agenda for a Summit. the non-papers produced in 1998 and 1999 ensured that when the UN Commission met in 2000 it could agree to host another Summit in 2002.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3039">The term "'''error 33'''" is [[jargon]] for the failure due to predicating one research project on the success of another, or alternatively for allowing one's own research project to be on the critical path of another project.&lt;ref name="datasegment"&gt;[http://onlinedictionary.datasegment.com/word/error%2033 "Datasegment Online Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jargonfile"&gt;[[Eric S Raymond]]'s [http://catb.org/esr/jargon/html/E/error-33.html Online Jargon File]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
"Error 33" was originally coined by [[George Pake]], the first director of [[Xerox Parc]].&lt;ref name="Web 2.0 Meets Error 33"/&gt;

==Usage==
As alumni of Xerox Parc have spread to other companies throughout [[Silicon Valley]], this phrase has been broadened in scope to general research and engineering projects as well as research efforts.

The advice to leaders of any project with a substantial development risk is ensure that as many dependencies as possible use established technology, engineering, or research results.

Xerox Parc alumnus [[Alan Kay]] has elaborated this into two "sets of theories" that contradict each other.&lt;ref name="The Power Of The Context"&gt;Kay, Alan (2004). [http://www.vpri.org/pdf/m2004001_power.pdf "The Power Of The Context"] (Draper Prize Lecture, Feb 24, 2004 ''VPRI Research Note RN-2004-001'').&lt;/ref&gt; In one direction, avoidance of error 33 suggests that teams avoid building their own tools - in his example, software languages and operating systems - because it can sink an incredible amount of time that doesn't move the primary project objective forward. In the opposite direction, error 33 is avoided by creating exactly the right tools for the job at hand, and avoiding reliance upon external [[vendor]]s, teams, or projects for success.  Kay cites the development of [[Ethernet]] as an example of avoiding error 33: [[Robert Metcalfe|Metcalfe]], [[David Boggs|Boggs]], [[Butler Lampson|Lampson]], and [[Charles P. Thacker|Thacker]] avoided designing a protocol that depended upon an error-free network, and instead depended upon retry and recovery in a way that eventually would send messages perfectly, even under extreme conditions.

In the same paper, Kay cites the [[Bravo (software)|Bravo text editor]] (precursor to [[Microsoft Word]]) as a project that delivered [[WYSIWYG]] printing, but avoiding dependence on a reliable platform by incorporating the ability to replay right up to the point of a crash.&lt;ref name="The Power Of The Context"/&gt;

[[Neil Gunther]], also a Xerox Parc alumnus, suggests that [[Web 2.0]] sites that depend heavily for their commercial success upon [[Amazon.com]]'s (at the time of writing in 2008) barely-out-of-research [[Elastic Compute Cloud]] (EC2) technology is just such an error 33.&lt;ref name="Web 2.0 Meets Error 33"&gt;Gunther, Neil (2008). [http://perfdynamics.blogspot.com/2008/02/web-20-meets-error-33.html "Web 2.0 Meets Error 33"].&lt;/ref&gt;  A February 2008 failure of Amazon's EC2 systems did impact many websites.

The '''Federation of European Nutrition Societies (FENS)''' is a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit association]], established in 1979 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FPNS%2FPNS37_02%2FS0029665178000208a.pdf&amp;code=29e9ebe17b999810d298f403f4d38dc7 |title= The history of The Nutrition Society |author= Alice M. Coppi |date=1978 |page= 22}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a roof organization for the national [[nutrition]] [[societies]] in Europe, with each country represented by its representative Nutrition Society or Association within FENS.

The aims of FENS are the combination of efforts for the development of research and education in [[Nutrition science|Nutrition Sciences]] and the promotion of the importance of Nutrition for [[public health]] in [[Europe]]. It seeks to do this by coordinating the European nutrition societies at a European level, promoting and disseminating [[research]] and knowledge on nutrition sciences and facilitating nutrition learning and training, as well as scientific exchange across Europe.

FENS conducts every 4 years its main event, the FENS European Nutrition Conference, which is organized by one of the FENS member societies, elected by the FENS General Assembly. All FENS Member [[Society|Societies]] and [[Professional association|Association]]s can take part in the [[bidding]] process for the organization of a FENS ENC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fensnutrition.eu/index.php?p=inicio&amp;sec=statutes |title= Statutes of the Federation of European Nutrition Societies, 3rd update|author= FENS General Assembly |date=2011 |page= 1 (E)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federation of European Nutrition Societies is a member of the [[International Union of Nutritional Sciences|International Union of Nutritional Sciences (IUNS)]] &lt;ref&gt;IUNS Adhering Bodies FENS: [http://www.iuns.org/affiliated_bodies/federation-of-european-nutrition-societies-fens IUNS Affiliated Bodies]&lt;/ref&gt; and the official FENS Journal is the “Annals of Nutrition and Metabolism”&lt;ref&gt;Annals of Nutrition and Metabolism ([https://www.researchgate.net/journal/1421-9697_Annals_of_Nutrition_and_Metabolism Ann Nutr Metabol)]&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Impact factor|IF]] 2014/2015: 2.618)

'''Gamma Apodis''' (γ Aps, γ Apodis) is the [[Bayer designation]] for a [[star]] in the southern [[circumpolar constellation]] of [[Apus]]. From [[parallax]] measurements, the distance to this star can be estimated as {{Convert|150 ± 4|ly|pc}}.&lt;ref name=dr2/&gt; It is visible to the naked eye with an [[apparent visual magnitude]] of 3.86.&lt;ref name=aaa508_2_833/&gt; A [[stellar classification]] of G9&amp;nbsp;III&lt;ref name=aaa508_2_833/&gt; identifies it as a [[giant star]] in the later stages of its [[stellar evolution|evolution]]. It is an active X-ray source with a luminosity of {{nowrap|1.607 × 10&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; erg s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, making it one of the 100 strongest stellar X-ray sources within 50 parsecs of the Sun.&lt;ref name=aj126_4_1996/&gt;

==Naming==
In [[Chinese language|Chinese]] caused by adaptation of the European southern hemisphere constellations into the Chinese system, {{lang|zh|異雀}} ({{lang|zh-Latn|Yì Què}}), meaning ''[[Chinese constellations#The Southern Asterisms|Exotic Bird]]'', refers to an asterism consisting of γ Apodis, [[Zeta Apodis|ζ Apodis]], [[Iota Apodis|ι Apodis]], [[Beta Apodis|β Apodis]], [[Delta Octantis|δ Octantis]], [[Delta Apodis|δ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Apodis]], [[Eta Apodis|η Apodis]], [[Alpha Apodis|α Apodis]] and [[Epsilon Apodis|ε Apodis]]. Consequently, γ Apodis itself is known as {{lang|zh|異雀四}} ({{lang|zh-Latn|Yì Què sì}}, {{lang-en|the Fourth Star of Exotic Bird}}.)&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://aeea.nmns.edu.tw/2006/0607/ap060729.html AEEA (Activities of Exhibition and Education in Astronomy) 天文教育資訊網 2006 年 7 月 29 日]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computational complexity theory]], a '''generalized game''' is a game or puzzle that has been generalized so that it can be played on a board or grid of any size. For example, generalized [[chess]] is the game of [[chess]] played on an ''n×n'' board, with 2''n'' pieces on each side. Generalized [[Sudoku]] includes Sudokus constructed on an ''n×n'' grid.

Complexity theory studies the [[asymptotic]] difficulty of problems, so generalizations of games are needed, as games on a fixed size of board are finite problems.

For many generalized games which last for a number of moves polynomial in the size of the board, the problem of determining if there is a win for the first player in a given position is [[PSPACE-complete]]. Generalized [[hex (board game)|hex]] and [[reversi]] are PSPACE-complete.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

For many generalized games which may last for a number of moves exponential in the size of the board, the problem of determining if there is a win for the first player in a given position is [[EXPTIME-complete]]. Generalized [[chess]], [[go (board game)|go]] and [[checkers]] are EXPTIME-complete.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The German '''Climate Action Plan 2050''' ({{lang-de|Klimaschutzplan 2050}}) is a [[Climate change mitigation|climate protection]] policy document approved by the German government on 14{{nbsp}}November 2016.&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The plan outlines measures by which Germany can meet its various national [[greenhouse gas]] emissions reduction goals through to 2050 (see [[#table-greenhouse-gas-policy-targets|table]]) and service its international commitments under the 2016 [[Paris Agreement|Paris Climate Agreement]].  The [[Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety]] (BMUB), under minister [[Barbara Hendricks (politician)|Barbara Hendricks]], led the development of the plan.  The plan was progressively watered down since a draft was first leaked in {{nowrap|early-May}} 2016.  Projections from the environment ministry in September 2016 indicate that Germany will likely miss its 2020 climate target.&lt;ref name="egenter-and-wettengel-2016"&gt;

The Climate Action Plan{{nbsp}}2050 should not be confused with an earlier document, the Climate Action Programme{{nbsp}}2020 (''{{lang|de|Aktionsprogramm Klimaschutz{{nbsp}}2020}}''), approved in December 2014 and which only covers the period until 2020.  In early 2017 it was agreed that the 2020 Programme would be scrapped.

== Climate Action Programme 2020 ==

The Climate Action Programme{{nbsp}}2020 (''{{lang|de|Aktionsprogramm Klimaschutz{{nbsp}}2020}}'') is an attempt by Germany to help meet its official 2020 greenhouse gas emissions reductions target after a 'climate gap' had been identified.{{efn|Official translations use the British spelling of programme.}}  Projections from 2013 show Germany may miss its 40% reductions target by about {{nowrap|7%-points}} without additional measures.&lt;ref name="appunn-2014a"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The first draft of the programme was released in {{nowrap|mid-November}} 2014.  How best to control the contribution from coal-fired generation remained controversial, but economy and energy minister [[Sigmar Gabriel]] ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]) dismissed plans aired in his ministry in October 2014 to retire 10{{nbsp}}GW of coal capacity.&lt;ref name="appunn-2014b"&gt;

The most significant part of the new package is a pledge to cut electricity sector emissions substantially by 2020.  To do so, the government proposes to cap emissions from the sector at 22{{nbsp}}million tonnes between 2016 and 2020 or 4.4{{nbsp}}million tonnes each year.  Once the cap is in place, energy companies will be allocated allowances based on their current emissions.  If they cut their emissions by a greater amount, they may be able to sell their surplus to other companies.  The package also contains measures to improve energy efficiency and the transport sector.&lt;ref name="hope-2014"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  However a government report, released on 30{{nbsp}}September 2016, shows that Germany will meet its 2020 greenhouse gas commitments only under "a best case scenario".&lt;ref name="egenter-and-wettengel-2016"/&gt;  The report, prepared for the European Union, is available in German.&lt;ref name="projection-report-2015"&gt;

== Development of the Climate Action Plan 2050 ==

The history of the Climate Action Plan{{nbsp}}2050 is quite involved.  The [[Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety]] (BMUB) is the lead agency for the plan, under the direction of environment minister [[Barbara Hendricks (politician)|Barbara Hendricks]] ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]).  A novel [[public consultation]] process was utilized to collect ideas from state and city governments, [[advocacy groups]], and [[citizenship|citizens]] and these ideas were then used to help create the first version.  Internal drafts of the plan were leaked three times to the media in 2016, the first in {{nowrap|early-May}}, the second in {{nowrap|late-June}}, and the third in {{nowrap|early-November}}.

=== Coalition agreement: 2013 ===

The notion of a climate action plan arose from the coalition agreement between the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]], [[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|CSU]], and [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] parties in 2013.  The agreement stated:

{{quote|[I]n Germany we want to define an emissions reduction pathway with a final target of 80{{nbsp}}to 95{{nbsp}}percent lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990 by 2050.  We will augment this target with concrete measures, drawn up through a broad dialogue (Climate Action Plan).&lt;ref name="bmub-2016e"/&gt;{{rp|1}}}}

=== Public consultation: 25 June 2015 – 19 March 2016 ===

A public consultation with stakeholders began on {{nowrap|25–26 June}} 2015 with a Kick-off Conference in Berlin.&lt;ref name="bmub-2016a"&gt;

* the use forests as [[carbon sink]]s and the renaturalisation of [[moorland]]s for the same purpose
* the investigation of a new national welfare index
* the embedding of climate protection in local and regional public services

The plan also suggested a "pluralistic" (meaning diverse groups are represented) commission be established, tasked with developing a coal phase-out plan by {{nowrap|mid-2017}}.&lt;ref name="appunn-2016a"/&gt;

Following the leaked document, state governments became increasingly concerned that they were being railroaded into climate change goals that could damage their regional economies.&lt;ref name="kersting-and-stratmann-2016"&gt;

=== Second leaked draft: 21 June 2016 ===

A draft of the plan was leaked to media for the second time in {{nowrap|late-June}} 2016.  The draft was dated 21{{nbsp}}June 2016 and is available for download in German.&lt;ref name="bmub-2016b"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The new draft shows that individual sectors may escape specific emissions targets and that an end date for coal-fired generation has been omitted.  Earlier versions had contained sector-specific targets for energy, transport, industry, buildings, and agriculture.  The energy sector which was previously slated to make a "considerable" contribution is now required to make an "adequate" contribution.  Rather than saying that coal-fired generation must "end well before 2050" the new draft emphasizes that "the importance of power production from coal will decrease" and that there will be a "step-by-step reduction".  The previous draft stated that the transport sector would need to deliver "disproportionately high" emissions reductions (on account of the poor performance of the sector to date), that has now diminished to an "ambitious" contribution.  Other proposals remain, including the development of ecological tax reform.  The plan also includes targets for modernizing the heating and cooling systems in buildings, including no new fossil-fueled heating systems in houses after 2030.&lt;ref name="appunn-2016b"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposal for a Commission on Climate Protection, Growth, Structural Change, and the Completion of the ''Energiewende'' (''{{lang|de|Kommission "Klimaschutz, Wachstum, Strukturwandel und Vollendung der Energiewende"}}'') remains, but now without the specific task of developing a roadmap for the phase-out of coal.&lt;ref name="clew-2016a"/&gt;

The weakening of the plan is also a result of industry associations repeatedly criticizing sector targets and itemized measures, which they fear would harm Germany's economic performance and international competitiveness.&lt;ref name="appunn-2016b"/&gt;

=== Official draft: 6 September 2016 ===

An official draft was released on 6{{nbsp}}September 2016 and is available in German.&lt;ref name="bmub-2016c"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  This draft retains a provision for the establishment of a Commission on Climate Protection, Growth, Structural Change, and the Completion of the ''Energiewende''.

The content however has been watered down considerably.  Concrete emissions reductions targets were removed altogether.  The previously leaked June 2016 draft stated that by 2030 "a large majority of newly registered cars" would need to be powered by either electricity or [[biofuel]]s.  But the new draft merely states that "the government aims to significantly lower car emissions by 2030" and that electric cars can contribute to that goal.&lt;ref name="amelang-and-wettengel-2016"&gt;

[[Environmental movement|Environmental groups]] have become increasingly critical of the plan as each iteration led to a watering down of its climate protection provisions.  The [[non-governmental organization|NGOs]] were particularly concerned about the lack of detail concerning a [[Fossil-fuel phase-out#Germany|coal phase-out]].  On 24 September 2016, Greenpeace Germany issued a report critical of the watering down of the results of the consultation process.&lt;ref name="greenpeace-press-release-2016"&gt;

=== Cabinet deliberations: late-2016 ===

In {{nowrap|late-2016}}, the plan went to the [[German Chancellery|Chancellery]] (''{{lang|de|Bundeskanzleramt}}'') to coordinate the final version to be agreed by the [[Cabinet of Germany|German cabinet]] (''{{lang|de|Bundeskabinett}}'').

Media reports in {{nowrap|late-October}} 2016 suggest a deepening rift between the economics and energy ministry (BMWi) and the environment ministry (BMUB) over the plan and the exit process for coal-fired generation (''{{lang|de|Kohleausstieg}}'').  Economy and energy minister [[Sigmar Gabriel]] opposes the setting of a coal exit date before job alternatives for [[lignite]] workers have been determined.&lt;ref name="amelang-2006"&gt;

A revised draft plan, circulated by the environment ministry on 4{{nbsp}}November 2016, was obtained by ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]''.  The plan has become more stringent and now includes passages that had earlier been removed during the negotiations between ministries.  The new plan also precludes new coal-fired generation and the expansion of existing [[Open-pit mining|open-pit mines]] and calls on the government to lobby for an EU-wide [[Price floor|floor price]] for auctioned [[European Union Emission Trading System|EU ETS]] emissions allowances.&lt;ref name="clew-2016b"&gt;

On 7{{nbsp}}November 2016, over 40 German companies, including energy suppliers [[EnBW]] and [[MVV Energie]] and network operator [[50Hertz Transmission GmbH|50Hertz]], together with [[Commerzbank]], [[Deutsche Telekom]], [[IKEA]], and [[Hochtief]], are lobbying for a more ambitious program, one which ensures that Germany's [[Paris Agreement]] commitments are met.  The companies want sector-specific emissions targets for 2030 and state that "only in this way can new business models and concrete plans for decarbonisation be developed".  They want the  goal to be the "rapid switch to 100% renewable energy".  British economist [[Nicholas Stern]] also backs a more ambitious plan.&lt;ref name="clew-2016c"&gt;

On 8{{nbsp}}November 2016, economy and energy minister Gabriel vetoed the plan amid concerns by trade union [[IG Bergbau, Chemie, Energie|IG BCE]] and supported by the [[:de:Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie|BDI]] industry group.

&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan is to be supplemented by a program of policy measures, developed by the German parliament (''{{lang|de|Bundestag}}''), with the first such program to be in place in 2018.  Annual reporting will track progress and should facilitate specific policy adjustments where needed.&lt;ref name="bmub-2016e"/&gt;{{rp|6}}

=== Preamble ===

The plan begins with a preamble that states that the document is an evolving work in progress and "cannot and does not want to be a detailed masterplan".&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;  It adds that there will be "no rigid provisions" and that the plan is technology neutral and open to innovation.&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;  The preamble stresses that the government will simultaneously maintain German competitiveness:

{{quote|We want to advance the upcoming changes without structural ruptures. It's about using the strength and creativity of the German market economy, as well as the forces of competition to reach existing national, European and international climate protection targets.&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;}}

The preamble also reiterates Germany's 2010 climate targets (see [[#table-greenhouse-gas-policy-targets|table]]) and its 2016 [[Paris Agreement]] commitment.{{efn|Germany's 2015 intended nationally determined contribution (INDC) became its nationally determined contribution (NDC) when it ratified the Paris Agreement on 5{{nbsp}}October 2016.}}&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;

=== Sector targets ===

Sector targets remained controversial during the development of the plan.  Notwithstanding, the official document now specifies sector targets for the first time under a national climate protection policy.&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;  The initial sector targets will be subject to a comprehensive impact assessment and consultation and may well be adjusted as a result in 2018.&lt;ref name="bmub-2016e"/&gt;

=== Commission for growth, structural change, and regional development ===

The plan establishes a commission for growth, structural change, and regional development.  But unlike earlier versions, the commission will not be tasked with setting a date for an exit from coal.  Instead, the commission will "support the structural changes" resulting from transformation and will "develop a mix of instruments that will bring together economic development, structural change, social acceptability and climate protection".  The commission will be based at the economics and energy ministry, but will consult with other ministries, federal states, municipalities, and unions, as well as with representatives of "affected" companies and regions.  The commission is scheduled to start work at the beginning of 2018 and to report at the end of 2018.&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bmub-2016e"/&gt;{{rp|4–5}}

=== EU Emissions Trading System ===

{{main article|European Union Emission Trading System}}

The plan stresses to role of the [[European Union Emission Trading System]] (EU{{nbsp}}ETS) as the primary climate protection instrument covering the energy sector and parts of industry in central Europe.  The government wants to strengthen price signaling and will campaign to make the EU{{nbsp}}ETS "effective" at a European level.&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;  Earlier provisions to set a floor price for emissions allowances were removed.

=== Energy sector ===

{{main article|Energy in Germany|Energiewende in Germany}}

The energy sector [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] target for 2030 is {{nowrap|175–183 million}} tonnes [[Carbon dioxide equivalent|{{CO2}}eq]] or a reduction of 61–62% relative to 1990.  The energy supply must be "almost completely decarbonised" by 2050, with renewables as its main source.  For the electricity sector, "in the long-term, electricity generation must be based almost entirely on renewable energies" and "the share of wind and solar power in total electricity production will rise significantly".&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;

If "possible and economically sensible", renewable energy will be used directly in all sectors, and electricity from renewable sources will be used efficiently for heating, transport, and industry.  The utilization of biomass will be limited and sourced mostly from waste.  The plan states that transitioning to a power supply based on renewables while ensuring supply security is "technically feasible".  During the transition, "less carbon-intensive natural gas power plants and the existing most modern coal power plants play an important role as interim technologies".&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;

The plan states that "the climate targets can only be reached if coal-fired power generation is reduced step-by-step".  Moreover, the German government "in its development cooperation does not lend support to new coal power plants".  Regions which depend on coal, like the ''[[Lusatia|Lausitz]]'', need special consideration: "we must succeed in establishing concrete perspectives for the future of the affected regions, before concrete decisions on the step-by-step withdrawal from the lignite industry can be taken".&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;

Notwithstanding, a coal phase-out for Germany is implied in the plan, environment minister [[Barbara Hendricks (politician)|Barbara Hendricks]] said in an interview on 21{{nbsp}}November 2016.  "If you read the Climate Action Plan carefully, you will find that the exit from coal-fired power generation is the immanent consequence of the energy sector target.{{nbsp}}... By 2030{{nbsp}}... half of the coal-fired power production must have ended, compared to 2014", Hendricks said.&lt;ref name="clew-2016e"&gt;

The plan also establishes a regional fund to foster new businesses in lignite mining regions. The government will need to ensure that EU competition law does not inhibit the operation of the fund.&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;

=== Building sector ===

The building sector [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] target for 2030 is {{nowrap|70–72 million}} tonnes [[Carbon dioxide equivalent|{{CO2}}eq]] or a reduction of 66–67% relative to 1990.  Under the plan, Germany's building stock will be largely carbon-neutral by 2050 and their limited energy needs will be met through renewables.  Due to the slow turnover of buildings, the groundwork for this goal must be laid by 2030.  The government will invest heavily in programs to implement high energy standards for buildings.  Heating, cooling, and electricity supply will be progressively switched to renewables.  The government will terminate support programs that rely on fossil fuels by 2020 and switch instead to support programs using renewable systems.  The aim is to "make renewables-based systems much more attractive than fossil-fuel-based ones".&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;

=== Transport sector ===

The transport sector [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] target for 2030 is {{nowrap|95–98 million}} tonnes [[Carbon dioxide equivalent|{{CO2}}eq]] or a reduction of 40–42% relative to 1990.  Unlike earlier drafts, the plan does not now set a deadline for all new cars to be emissions free.  Rather the plan states that stricter emissions limits for new cars will be set by the European Union and that "the government will advocate [an] ambitious development of the targets" so that its 2030 goal can be met.  These cuts will derive from improved efficiencies and increasingly GHG-neutral energy.  Such cuts will require "a significant contribution by the electrification of new cars and should have priority".  The plan emphasizes the contribution that [[biofuel]]s can make, stating that "in the target scenario, the energy supply of street and rail traffic, as well as parts of air and maritime traffic and inland shipping is switched to biofuels – if ecologically compatible – and otherwise largely to renewable electricity as well as other GHG-neutral fuels".  The need to support public transport, rail transport, and cycling is stressed in the plan.  The plan states a next step is to determine the framework needed to ensure that new [[powertrain]] technologies and [[Energy carrier|energy forms]] will be adopted at scale.  This then "involves the question of when, at the latest, they should be introduced into the market, and what penetration rate they should achieve by what date".&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;

=== Industry ===

The industry [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] target for 2030 is {{nowrap|140–143 million}} tonnes [[Carbon dioxide equivalent|{{CO2}}eq]] or a reduction of 49–51% relative to 1990.  Good progress has been made and, {{as of|lc=yes|2016}}, the sector must reduce its emissions by about another 20%.  Notwithstanding, the plan emphasizes the need to maintain international competitiveness:

{{quote|With our modernizing strategy for the economy, the correct political framework, and active regional and structural policy that supports structural change, we want to create dependable framework conditions for the German economy, to adjust to this transformational process early, and use the possibilities connected to it.&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;}}

The plan continues that, despite the costs and challenges, climate protection could become an "innovation motor" for a modern high-tech economy.  The plan acknowledges that some industrial emissions cannot be avoided – for instance, those from steel production or chemical plants.  Such emissions should be reduced as far as possible by developing new processes and replacing old ones – or through the use of carbon capture and utilization (CCU) or [[carbon capture and storage]] (CCS).  The government will launch a [[research and development]] program to advance these and other low-carbon processes.&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bmub-2016e"/&gt;{{rp|5}}

=== Agricultural sector ===

The agricultural sector [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] target for 2030 is {{nowrap|58–61 million}} tonnes [[Carbon dioxide equivalent|{{CO2}}eq]] or a reduction of 31–34% relative to 1990.  The plan acknowledges that agriculture cannot reach zero emissions, due to the biological processes inherent in plant cultivation and livestock farming.  Instead the plan will focus on reducing emissions as much as possible and on the more efficient use of resources.  About one third of agricultural emissions are due to [[nitrous oxide]] from fertilizer use.  The government wants to reduce these emissions through better management and through [[research and development]].  Another one third of emissions derive from ruminant animals.  The government will develop a comprehensive strategy to reduce emissions from livestock farming by 2021.  The plan states that 20% of agricultural land by 2030 "should be used for [[organic farming]]", compared with 6.3% in 2014.  The government also advocates the use of financial instruments under a reformed EU [[Common Agricultural Policy]] to reduce GHG emissions from the sector."&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;

=== Land use and forestry sector ===

The land use and forestry sector offers opportunities for [[carbon sequestration]].  The government will prioritize improving the performance of forests as carbon sinks.  Sustainable forest management will also be promoted and permanent grasslands and marshes are to be preserved.  The expansion of settlements and transport infrastructure is to be reduced to {{val|30|ul=ha}} per day by 2020 and to zero by 2050.&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;

=== Financial matters ===

Under the plan, the government will consider how to incrementally revise taxation through to 2050, on the understanding that "environmental taxes and levies can create incentives for ecological economic activity" and that "environmentally related taxes and levies can cost-efficiently trigger climate-friendly economic behavior".  The government also intends to reduce environmentally harmful subsidies.  In addition, the government will support efforts to reconcile global finance flows with climate protection goals, for instance through its role on the [[G20]] [[Financial Stability Board]].&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bmub-2016e"/&gt;

=== Implementation and revision of the plan ===

The plan is predicated on a gradual transformation, achieved through a learning process involving the scientific community and accompanied by public dialogue.&lt;ref name="bmub-2016e"/&gt;{{rp|6}}  It is therefore intended that the plan can and should respond to changing technological, political, and social conditions.  The plan will be reviewed every five years to align it with the evolution of Germany's [[Paris Agreement#Nationally determined contributions|nationally determined contribution]] (NDC) under the [[Paris Agreement]].  The first update is therefore slated for {{nowrap|late-2019}} or {{nowrap|early-2020}}.  As early as 2018, the government intends to strengthen the plan by quantifying the various emission reduction efforts and their associated ecological, social, and economic impacts.  The sector targets may be modified as a result.  Annual reporting should help the government to evaluate and adjust its specific climate protection measures in the short-term.&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;

== Reactions ==

Thilo Schaefer, climate and energy expert at the [[Cologne Institute for Economic Research]] (IW) comments that "it looks like the government forgot that the energy sector and industry already participate in the European emissions trading system{{nbsp}}... in the end, it will simply become more expensive for the affected sectors, but they won't save a single extra ton of {{CO2}}{{nbsp}}... because the emissions saved by German sectors can be emitted by other states".&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016b"&gt;

[[Simone Peter]], co-chair of the [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Green Party]], said "this is not a good plan anymore, it has become an empty shell, because the ministerial colleagues of [environment minister] Hendricks have removed anything that could be of relevance – be it the coal exit, the end of the combustion engine, or a transition in agriculture".&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016b"/&gt;

[[Klaus Töpfer]], founding director of the [[:de:Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies|Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies]] (IASS), said "this plan is certainly not yet capable of securing the German contribution to the Paris Climate Agreement.  This will require more work".&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016b"/&gt;

Regine Günther, director of policy and climate at [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF Germany]], said "today's climate action plan is only a fraction of what is needed. The only plus point: all sectors get precise reduction targets, which WWF welcomes. However, the list of negatives is much longer: there are no appropriate measures to reach those targets.  There is also a blank on the issue of coal.  The plan completely dropped the urgently needed ban on further extension of open cast mining.  The commission on coal will not start until 2018, after the federal elections.  A minimum price on carbon is also missing completely.  With this plan, the industry and energy lobbies have proven how well placed they are in the economy ministry.  With such a plan there can be no ambitious climate protection."&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016b"/&gt;

[[Ottmar Edenhofer]], a German climate economist and director of the [[Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change|MCC]], criticized the plan.  He said economy and energy minister "[[Sigmar Gabriel]] yielded to lobbyists and sadly put short-term interests before long-term interests".&lt;ref name="clew-2016f"&gt;

The '''GreenScreen for Safer Chemicals''' is a transparent, [[open standard]] for assessing [[chemical hazard]] that supports [[alternatives assessment]] for [[toxics use reduction]] through identifying chemicals of concern and safer alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Heine |first1=Lauren |last2=Franjevic |first2=Shari |title=Chemical Hazard Assessment and the GreenScreen for Safer Chemicals |journal=Issues in Environmental Science and Technology |date=January 2013 |volume=36 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311370591 |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used by researchers, product formulators and certifiers in a variety of industries, including building products, textiles, apparel, and consumer products.
 
The GreenScreen prioritizes the avoidance of substances with a high hazard as a [[carcinogen]], [[mutagen]], [[Reproductive toxicity|reproductive toxicant]] or [[Developmental toxicity|developmental toxicant]] or [[endocrine disruptor]] or that are a [[Persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic substances|persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic substance]] (PBT).

== Types of analysis ==
The GreenScreen protocol is published in a Guidance document that is reviewed and updated regularly. The description here is based upon the Hazard Assessment Guidance Version 1.4&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=GreenScreen for Safer Chemicals Hazard Assessment Guidance for Chemicals, Polymers and Products |date=January 2018 |publisher=Clean Production Action |edition=Version 1.4 |url=https://www.greenscreenchemicals.org/learn/method-documents |accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An assessment using the GreenScreen has two major outputs: 
* '''Hazard levels for endpoints''': It characterizes the hazard level of substances from very low to very high across twenty human and environmental health endpoints addressing: 
** [[Human health]] - such as cancer and reproductive toxicity
** [[Environmental protection]] - primarily [[aquatic toxicity]]
** [[Physical hazards]] - [[flammability]] and [[Reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]]
** Environmental fate - [[Persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic substances#Persistence|persistence]] and [[bioaccumulation]] 
* '''Benchmarks''': It rates substances from highest concern (Benchmark 1) to lowest concern (Benchmark 4)

The GreenScreen process has two levels of analysis: 
* '''[[GreenScreen List Translator]]''' - a screening method for quickly identifying known high hazard substances using hazard listings from governmental and professional scientific bodies. The screening is available through free online automated tools. 
* '''GreenScreen Assessments''' - a full toxicological review to fill hazard data gaps and identify safer substances using scientific literature and modeling tools. This assessment is typically done by a trained practitioner.  
 
A full GreenScreen Assessment provides a more complete hazard profile of a substance than a List Translator screening. It involves a detailed review of the scientific literature to attempt to determine hazard levels for all endpoints and calculate a GreenScreen benchmark. It may also use models and studies of analogs where direct data are scarce.  Each endpoint hazard level is also assigned a confidence level based on the quality of the data.

== Benchmark scores ==
The GreenScreen List Translator only can flag chemicals known to be of highest concern. A full GreenScreen Assessment can benchmark chemicals as being of lower concern. The Benchmark scale is:
 
* BM-1 - Benchmark 1: Avoid - Chemical of High Concern
* BM-2 - Benchmark 2: Use but Search for Safer Substitutes
* BM-3 - Benchmark 3: Use but Still Opportunity for Improvement
* BM-4 - Benchmark 4: Prefer - Safer Chemical 
* BM-U - Benchmark U: Unspecified Due to Insufficient Data 
 
The assessment requires data for most endpoints in order to give a substance a benchmark of lower concern than BM-1

Benchmark 1 is reserved for substances with a high hazard of any of the following: 
* [[Carcinogenicity]] (Cancer)
* [[Mutagenicity]]
* [[Reproductive toxicity]]
* [[Developmental toxicity]]
* [[Endocrine disruption]] or that are
* [[Persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic substances]] (PBT), very persistent toxicants (vPT), very bioaccumulative toxicants (vBT) or very persistent, very bioaccumulative substances (vPvB) 

High hazards for other human health endpoints, such as [[neurotoxicity]] and [[respiratory sensitization]], receive a Benchmark 2
 
This parallels the prioritization schemes underlying various international governmental regulatory programs such as the [[Substance of very high concern]] definition within the [[REACH Regulation]] of the [[European Union]].

== Special cases ==
'''DG - Data gaps''': Strict guidelines limit the amount of data gaps. Where there are data gaps, the assessment includes a worst case scenario to determine the lowest possible Benchmark score if the data gap were filled with the highest possible hazard.  These Benchmarks include a subscript of DG. A chemical that has too many data gaps receives a Benchmark U.
 
'''TP - Transformation Products''': The assessment also must identify feasible and relevant environmental transformation products and benchmark them. If the Benchmark score is determined by the transformation products, the Benchmark score will include a subscript of TP.
 
'''CoHC - Chemicals of High Concern''' (polymer residuals &amp; catalysts): Version 1.4 of the GreenScreen added special rules for benchmarking polymers which include analysis of residual monomers and/or catalysts present at or above 100 ppm. If the Benchmark score is determined by one of these chemicals, the Benchmark score will include a subscript of CHoC.

== Applications ==
GreenScreen Assessments are internally used for research and product improvement by product manufacturers in many industry sectors, including electronics,&lt;ref name="holder_2013"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Royal Society of Chemistry| isbn = 978-1-84973-723-4| pages = 157–176| editor = R.

The GreenScreen standard is developed, maintained and published by [[Clean Production Action]] (CPA), a non profit organization, based in the United States. CPA publishes the GreenScreen as an open standard which anyone can utilize. To make a public claim using a GreenScreen Benchmark, however, the GreenScreen assessment must be completed by a Profiler licensed by CPA.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

== Related standards ==
The GreenScreen has substantial overlaps with the [[Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals]] (GHS) and the criteria of the US EPA’s [[Design for the Environment]]. It differs from GHS, however, in some significant ways. GreenScreen has a lower threshold of analysis. GreenScreen includes endocrine activity, addresses PBTs more comprehensively and considers environmental transformation products. GreenScreen also requires and provides guidance for addressing data gaps. GHS, on the other hand, covers more physical workplace hazards then the GreenScreen and provides guidelines for identifying hazards across languages with icons. This reflects the GHS focus on workplace safety and communications.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The [[Cradle to Cradle]] (C2C) Product Certification program includes a hazard screening protocol that is similar to the GreenScreen and GHS in many ways.The C2C analysis divides endpoints differently and is integrated into a product certification. There is not a standalone public assessment of individual substances. 

These programs have been the subject of analysis evaluating the relationships, differences and opportunities for harmonization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Heine |first1=Lauren |title=Material Health Evaluation Programs Harmonization Opportunities Report |url=https://www.usgbc.org/sites/default/files/material_health_evaluation_programs__harmonization_opportunities_130819.pdf |website=USGBC Resources |publisher=US Green Building Council |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22428">The '''history of chromatography''' spans from the mid-19th century to the 21st.  [[Chromatography]], literally "color writing",&lt;ref name=OnlineEtDict&gt;{{cite web|title=chromatography|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=chromatography&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; was used&amp;mdash;and named&amp;mdash; in the first decade of the 20th century, primarily for the separation of plant [[pigments]] such as [[chlorophyll]] (which is green) and [[carotenoid]]s (which are orange and yellow).  New forms of chromatography developed in the 1930s and 1940s made the technique useful for a wide range of [[separation process]]es and [[chemical analysis]] tasks, especially in [[biochemistry]].

==Precursors==

The earliest use of chromatography&amp;mdash;passing a mixture through  an inert material to create separation of the solution components based on differential [[adsorption]]&amp;mdash;is sometimes attributed to German chemist [[Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge]], who in 1855 described the use of paper to analyze [[dye]]s.  Runge dropped spots of different inorganic chemicals onto circles of filter paper already impregnated with another chemical, and reactions between the different chemicals created unique color patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Runge placed drops of reactant solutions on blotting paper and then added a drop of a second reactant solution on top of the first drop.  The solutions would react as they spread through the blotting paper, often producing colored patterns.  His results were published in two books:
*  F. F. Runge, ''Farbenchemie.  Musterbilder für Freunde des Schönen und zum Gebrauch für Zeichner, Maler, Verzierer und Zeugdrucker, dargestellt durch chemische Wechselwirkung'' [Color chemistry.  Sample images for friends of beauty and for use by sketchers, painters, decorators, and printers, prepared by chemical interaction] (Berlin, (Germany):  (Self-published), 1850).
*  F. F. Runge, ''Der Bildungstrieb der Stoffe, veranschaulicht in selbstständig gewachsenen Bilder'' [The formative tendency of substances illustrated by autonomously developed images] (Oranienburg, (Germany):  (Self-published), 1855).&lt;/ref&gt;  According to historical analysis of L. S. Ettre, however, Runge's work had "nothing to do with chromatography" (and instead should be considered a precursor of chemical [[spot test]]s such as the [[Schiff test]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ettre (2001), p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L.S. Ettre = Leslie Stephen Ettre (1922-2010), Hungarian-American chemist, author of several publications on the history of chromatography.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1860s, [[Christian Friedrich Schönbein]] and his student [[Friedrich Goppelsroeder]] published the first attempts to study the different rates at which different substances move through filter paper.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Schönbein (1861) [https://books.google.com/books?id=V3AxAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA249#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Ueber einige durch die Haarröhrchenanziehung des Papiers hervorgebrachten Trennungswirkungen"] (On some separation effects produced by capillary attraction of paper), ''Verhandlungen der Naturforschenden Gesellschaft zu Basel'',  '''3''' (2) : 249-255.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Goppelsröder (1861) [https://books.google.com/books?id=V3AxAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA268#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Ueber ein Verfahren, die Farbstoffe in ihren Gemischen zu erkennen"] (On a method for detecting the colorings in mixtures of them), ''Verhandlungen der Naturforschenden Gesellschaft zu Basel'', '''3''' (2) :  268-275.&lt;br&gt;
See also:  Friedrich Goppelsroeder, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mVM4AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PR1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Capillaranalyse beruhend auf Capillaritäts- und Adsorptionserscheinungen'' …] [Capillary analysis based on phenomena of capillarity and adsorption … ] (Basel, Switzerland:  Emil Birkhäuser, 1901).&lt;/ref&gt;  Schönbein, who thought [[capillary action]] (rather than adsorption) was responsible for the movement, called the technique [[capillary analysis]], and Goppelsroeder spent much of his career using capillary analysis to test the movement rates of a wide variety of substances.  Unlike modern paper chromatography, capillary analysis used reservoirs of the substance being analyzed, creating overlapping zones of the solution components rather than separate points or bands.&lt;ref&gt;Ettre (2001), pp. 411-412.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;However, in his book ''Capillaranalyse … '' (1901), Goppelsroeder stated (p. 168) that he had been separating plant colorants since 1880, and that he had achieved complete separations of those colorants.  From p. 166:&lt;br&gt;
''"Bietet sich auch dem Auge bei Betrachtung der verschiedenen Pflanzenorgane eine wunderbare Mannigfaltigkeit der Farben und Farbenabstufungen dar, so bleibt ihm doch die wichtige Thatsache verborgen, dass meist nicht nur ein einziger Farbstoff, sondern mehrere nebeneinander in demselben Organe vorkommen.  Während das Auge nur eine Färbung erkennt und wir desshalb glauben, dass dieselbe einem bestimmten einzelnen Farbstoff angehöre, lässt uns die Capillaranalyse meist mehrere verschieden gefärbte Zonen auf den Capillarstreifen in bestimmer, sehr oft von farblosen Zonen unterbrochener Reihenfolge erkennen.  Das Chlorophyll oder Blattgrün z.B. findet sich nicht nur in den grünen, sonder auch in anders gefärbten Organen, beispielsweise verdeckt durch die rote Färbung des Zellsafts in den Blättern der Blutbuche neben dem roten Anthokyan, sowie neben roten Phycoerythrin in den Rotalgen, den Florideen.  Diese verschiedenen Farbstoffe lassen sich durch Capillaranalyse in den gemeinschaftlichen Auszügen, ohne irgend welche sonstige Trennungsmanipulationen nebeneinander nachweisen.  Sind sie capillarisch in Zonen getrennt, dann genügt deren spectroscopische und chemische Prüfung zur endgiltigen Feststellung ihrer Natur."''&lt;br&gt;
(If a wonderful variety of colors and color gradations presents itself to the eye when looking at the different plant organs, yet the important fact remains hidden to it:  that usually not only a single colorant but several occur side by side in the same organs. While the eye perceives only one color and we believe therefore that it belongs to a certain individual colorant, capillary analysis [i.e., paper chromatography] allows us to detect usually several differently colored zones on the capillary strips in certain sequences [that are] very often interrupted by colorless zones.  Chlorophyll or leaf green, for example, is found not only in the green, but also in differently colored organs; for example, obscured by the red color of the protoplasm in the leaves of the copper beech together with red anthocyanin, as well as together with red phycoerythrin in red algae, the ''Florideae''.  These various colorants can be detected by capillary analysis in extracts where they are present in combination, without any other concurrent separation treatments.  If they are separated into zones by capillarity, then their spectroscopic and chemical examination suffices for the conclusive ascertaining of their nature.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Work on capillary analysis continued, but without much technical development, well into the 20th century.  The first significant advances over Goppelsroeder's methods came with the work of [[Raphael E. Liesegang]]: in 1927, he placed filter strips in closed containers with atmospheres saturated by solvents, and in 1943 he began using discrete spots of sample adsorbed to filter paper, dipped in pure solvent to achieve separation.&lt;ref&gt;See:

(1943) "Kreuz-Kapillaranalyse" (Cross capillary analysis), ''Naturwissenschaften'', '''31''' (29) :  348.&lt;/ref&gt;  This method, essentially identical to modern paper chromatography, was published just before the independent&amp;mdash;and far more influential&amp;mdash;work of [[Archer Martin]] and his collaborators that inaugurated the widespread use of paper chromatography.&lt;ref&gt;Ettre (2001), p. 412.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897, the American chemist David Talbot Day (1859-1915), then serving with the U.S. Geological Survey, observed that crude petroleum generated bands of color as it seeped upwards through finely divided clay or limestone.&lt;ref&gt;David T. Day (1897) [https://books.google.com/books?id=IQkDAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA112#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "A suggestion as to the origin of Pennsylvania petroleum,"] ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'', '''36''' (154) :  112-115.  From page 115:  " … by experimental work it may easily be demonstrated that if we saturate a limestone such as the Trenton limestone with the oils characteristic of that rock and exert slight pressure upon it, so that it may flow upward through finely divided clay, it is easy to change it in its color … "&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1900, he reported his findings at the First International Petroleum Congress in Paris, where they created a sensation.&lt;ref&gt;See:

Day's discovery, other researchers investigated the diffusion of petroleum through finely divided earths; viz, the German organic chemist [[Karl Engler]] (1842-1925) of the Technical University Karlsruhe and the American chemist Joseph Elliot Gilpin (1866-1924) of Johns Hopkins University.

==Tsvet and column chromatography==
[[File:Chromatography of chlorophyll - Step 7.jpg|right|thumb|75px|Thin layer chromatography is used to separate the colorful components of a plant extract]]
The first true chromatography is usually attributed to the Russian-Italian botanist [[Mikhail Tsvet]].  Tsvet applied his observations with filter paper extraction to the new methods of column [[fractionation]] that had been developed in the 1890s for separating the components of [[petroleum]]. He used a liquid-adsorption column containing [[calcium carbonate]] to separate yellow, orange, and green plant [[pigment]]s (what are known today as [[xanthophylls]], [[carotenes]], and [[chlorophyll]]s, respectively). The method was described on December 30, 1901 at the 11th Congress of Naturalists and Doctors (XI съезд естествоиспытателей и врачей) in [[Saint Petersburg]]. The first printed description was in 1903, in the Proceedings of the [[Warsaw]] Society of Naturalists, section of biology.  He first used the term ''chromatography'' in print in 1906 in his two papers about chlorophyll in the German botanical journal, ''Berichte der Deutschen Botanischen Gesellschaft''. In 1907 he demonstrated his chromatograph for the German Botanical Society. Mikhail's surname "Цвет" means "color" in Russian, so there is the possibility that his naming the procedure chromatography (literally "color writing") was a way that he could make sure that he, a commoner in Tsarist Russia, could be immortalized.

In a 1903 lecture (published in 1905), Tsvet also described using filter paper to approximate the properties of living plant fibers in his experiments on plant pigments&amp;mdash;a precursor to [[paper chromatography]].  He found that he could extract some pigments (such as orange [[carotene]]s and yellow [[xanthophyll]]s) from leaves with [[non-polar solvent]]s, but others (such as [[chlorophyll]]) required [[polar solvent]]s.  He reasoned that chlorophyll was held to the plant tissue by [[adsorption]], and that stronger solvents were necessary to overcome the adsorption.  To test this, he applied dissolved pigments to filter paper, allowed the solvent to evaporate, then applied different solvents to see which could extract the pigments from the filter paper.  He found the same pattern as from leaf extractions: carotene could be extracted from filter paper using non-polar solvents, but chlorophyll required polar solvents.&lt;ref&gt;Ettre (2001), pp. 412-413.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tsvet's work saw little use until the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Martin (1952), p. 359&lt;/ref&gt;

==Martin and Synge and partition chromatography==

Chromatography methods changed little after Tsvet's work until the explosion of mid-20th century research in new techniques, particularly thanks to the work of [[Archer John Porter Martin]] and [[Richard Laurence Millington Synge]].  By "the marrying of two techniques, that of chromatography and that of countercurrent solvent extraction",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite| title = Archer J. P. Martin - Nobel Lecture - martin-lecture.pdf| accessdate = 2016-02-27| url = https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1952/martin-lecture.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin and Synge developed [[partition chromatography]] to separate chemicals with only slight differences in [[partition coefficient]]s between two liquid solvents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 19| issue = 5| pages = 506–512| last = Ettre| first = C.| title = Milestones in Chromatography: The Birth of Partition Chromatography| journal = LCGC| accessdate = 2016-02-26| date = 2001| url = http://images.alfresco.advanstar.com/alfresco_images/pharma/2014/08/22/1598ed6f-5bbe-400b-bc08-ff07d2c59826/article-2090.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Martin, who had previously been working in vitamin chemistry (including attempts to purify [[vitamin E]]), began collaborating with Synge in 1938, brought his experience with equipment design to Synge's project of separating [[amino acids]].  After unsuccessful experiments with complex [[countercurrent distribution|countercurrent extraction]] machines and liquid-liquid chromatography methods where the liquids move in opposite directions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0264-6021| volume = 35| issue = 1-2| pages = 91–121| last1 = Martin| first1 = A J P| last2 = Synge| first2 = R L M| title = Separation of the higher monoamino-acids by counter-current liquid-liquid extraction: the amino-acid composition of wool| journal = Biochemical Journal| date = 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin hit on the idea of using silica gel in columns to hold water stationary while an organic solvent flows through the column.  Martin and Synge demonstrated the potential of the methods by separating amino acids marked in the column by the addition of [[methyl red]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin (1952), pp. 362-366&lt;/ref&gt;  In a series of publications beginning in 1941, they described increasingly powerful methods of separating amino acids and other organic chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 35| issue = 12| pages = 1358–1368| last1 = Martin| first1 = A J P| last2 = Synge| first2 = R L M| title = A new form of chromatogram employing two liquid phases A theory of chromatography. 2. Application to the micro-determination of the higher monoamino-acids in proteins| journal = Biochemical Journal| date = 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In pursuit of better and easier methods of identifying the amino acid constituents of peptides, Martin and Synge turned to other chromatography media as well.  A short abstract in 1943 followed by a detailed article in 1944 described the use of filter paper as the stationary phase for performing chromatography on amino acids: [[paper chromatography]].&lt;ref&gt;Whelan (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1947, Martin, Synge and their collaborators had applied this method (along with [[Sanger's reagent|Fred Sanger's reagent]] for identifying [[N-terminal]] residues) to determine the pentapeptide sequence of [[Gramicidin S]].  These and related paper chromatography methods were also foundational to [[Fred Sanger]]'s effort to determine the [[amino acid sequence]] of [[insulin]].&lt;ref&gt;Sanger (1988), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Refining the techniques==

Martin, in collaboration with [[Anthony T. James]], went on to develop [[gas chromatography]] (the principles of which Martin and Synge had laid out in their landmark 1941 paper) beginning in 1949.  In 1952, during his lecture for the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] (shared with Synge, for their earlier chromatography work) Martin announced the successful separation of a wide variety of natural compounds by gas chromatography.  (Austrian chemist Fritz Prior had achieved limited success with gas chromatography, separating [[oxygen]] and [[carbon dioxide]], in 1947 during his Ph.D. research.  The method of Martin and James, however, became the basis for subsequent developments in gas chromatography.)&lt;ref&gt;Lesney (1998).  Accessed July 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ease and efficiency of gas chromatography for separating organic chemicals spurred the rapid adoption of the method, as well as the rapid development of new detection methods for analyzing the output.  The [[thermal conductivity detector]], described in 1954 by N. H. Ray, was the foundation for several other methods: the [[flame ionization detector]] was described by J. Harley, W. Nel, and V. Pretorius in 1958,&lt;ref&gt;Ettre, L.S. ''Chapters in the Evolution of Chromatography.'' [http://www.chromsource.com/books/Milestones-FID.pdf Chapter 17, The Invention, Development and Triumph of the Flame Ionization Detector], pp. 171-180.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James Lovelock]] introduced the [[electron capture detector]] that year as well.  Others introduced [[mass spectrometer]]s to gas chromatography in the late 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Touchstone (1993), p. 1650&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of Martin and Synge also set the stage for [[high performance liquid chromatography]], suggesting that small sorbent particles and pressure could produce fast liquid chromatography techniques.  This became widely practical by the late 1960s (and the method was used to separate amino acids as early as 1960).&lt;ref&gt;Touchstone (1993), pp. 1655-1656&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thin layer chromatography==
The first developments in [[thin layer chromatography]] occurred in the 1940s, and techniques advanced rapidly in the 1950s after the introduction of relatively large plates and relatively stable materials for [[sorbent]] layers.&lt;ref&gt;Touchstone (1993), pp. 1651-1652&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later developments==

In 1987 [[Pedro Cuatrecasas]] and [[Meir Wilchek]] were awarded the [[Wolf Prize in Medicine]] for the invention and development of [[affinity chromatography]] and its applications to biomedical sciences.

Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg, New York, 184pp.&lt;/ref&gt; further refined the definition of horizontal resistance.  Unlike vertical resistance and parasitic ability, horizontal resistance and horizontal parasitic ability are entirely independent of each other in genetic terms.

In the first round of breeding for horizontal resistance, plants are exposed to pathogens and selected for partial resistance. Those with no resistance die, and plants unaffected by the pathogen have vertical resistance and are removed.  The remaining plants have partial resistance and their seed is stored and bred back up to sufficient volume for further testing.  The hope is that in these remaining plants are multiple types of partial-resistance genes, and by crossbreeding this pool back on itself, multiple partial resistance genes will come together and provide resistance to a larger variety of pathogens.

Successive rounds of breeding for horizontal resistance proceed in a more traditional fashion, selecting plants for disease resistance as measured by yield. These plants are exposed to native regional pathogens, and given minimal assistance in fighting them.&lt;ref name="Beyond GMO … the REAL answer to healthy, disease resistant crops"&gt;{{citation |url=http://newfarm.rodaleinstitute.org/international/pan-am_don/nov04/chapingo.shtml |title=Beyond GMO … the REAL answer to healthy, disease resistant crops |author=Don Lotter |publisher=Rodale Institute |accessdate=29 March 2016 |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20707">'''Information history''' may refer to the history of each of the categories listed below (or to combinations of them). It should be recognized that the understanding of, for example, libraries as information systems only goes back to about 1950. The application of the term ''information'' for earlier systems or societies is a [[retronym]].

==The word and concept "information"==
The Latin roots and Greek origins of the word "information" is presented by Capurro &amp; Hjørland (2003).&lt;ref&gt;Capurro, Rafael &amp; Hjørland, Birger (2003). The concept of information. Annual review of information science and technology (s. 343-411). Medford, N.J.: Information Today. A version retrieved November 6, 2011 from: http://www.capurro.de/infoconcept.html&lt;/ref&gt; References on "formation or molding of the mind or character, training, instruction, teaching" date from the 14th century in both English (according to [[Oxford English Dictionary]]) and other European languages. 
In the transition from Middle Ages to Modernity the use of the concept of information reflected a fundamental turn in epistemological basis – from "giving a (substantial) form to matter" to "communicating something to someone". Peters (1988, pp.&amp;nbsp;12–13) concludes:

:Information was readily deployed in empiricist psychology (though it played a less important role than other words such as impression or idea) because it seemed to describe the mechanics of sensation: objects in the world inform the senses. But sensation is entirely different from "form" – the one is sensual, the other intellectual; the one is subjective, the other objective. My sensation of things is fleeting, elusive, and idiosynchratic [sic]. For Hume, especially, sensory experience is a swirl of impressions cut off from any sure link to the real world...  In any case, the empiricist problematic was how the mind is informed by sensations of the world. At first informed meant shaped by; later it came to mean received reports from. As its site of action drifted from cosmos to consciousness, the term's sense shifted from unities (Aristotle's forms) to units (of sensation). Information came less and less to refer to internal ordering or formation, since empiricism allowed for no preexisting intellectual forms outside of sensation itself. Instead, information came to refer to the fragmentary, fluctuating, haphazard stuff of sense. Information, like the early modern worldview in general, shifted from a divinely ordered cosmos to a system governed by the motion of corpuscles. Under the tutelage of empiricism, information gradually moved from structure to stuff, from form to substance, from intellectual order to sensory impulses.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, J. D. (1988). Information: Notes Toward a Critical History. Journal of Communication Inquiry, 12, 10-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern era, the most important influence on the concept of information is derived from the [[Information theory]] developed by Shannon and others. This theory, however, reflects a fundamental contradiction. Qvortrup (1993)&lt;ref&gt;Qvortrup, L. (1993). The controversy over the concept of information. An overview and a selected and annotated bibliography. Cybernetics &amp; Human Knowing 1(4), 3-24.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote:

:Thus, actually two conflicting metaphors are being used: The well-known metaphor of information as a quantity, like water in the waterpipe, is at work, but so is a second metaphor, that of information as a choice, a choice made by :an information provider, and a forced choice made by an :information receiver. Actually, the second metaphor implies that the information sent isn’t necessarily equal to the information received, because any choice implies a comparison with a list of possibilities, i.e., a list of possible meanings. Here, meaning is involved, thus spoiling the idea of information as a pure "Ding an sich." Thus, much of the confusion regarding the concept of information seems to be related to the basic confusion of metaphors in Shannon’s theory: is information an autonomous quantity, or is information always per se information to an observer? Actually, I don’t think that Shannon himself chose one of the two definitions. Logically speaking, his theory implied information as a subjective phenomenon. But this had so wide-ranging epistemological impacts that Shannon didn’t seem to fully realize this logical fact. Consequently, he continued to use metaphors about information as if it were an objective substance. This is the basic, inherent contradiction in Shannon’s information theory." (Qvortrup, 1993, p. 5)

In their seminal book ''The Study of Information: Interdisciplinary Messages'',&lt;ref&gt;Machlup, Fritz &amp; Una Mansfield (eds.). 1983. The Study of Information: Interdisciplinary Messages. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Machlup and Mansfield (1983) collected key views on the interdisciplinary controversy in computer science, artificial intelligence, library and information science, linguistics, psychology, and physics, as well as in the social sciences. Machlup (1983,&lt;ref&gt;Machlup,Fritz. 1983. "Semantic Quirks in Studies of Information," pp. 641-71 in Fritz Machlup &amp; Una Mansfield, The Study of Information: Interdisciplinary Messages. New York: Wiley.
&lt;/ref&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;660) himself disagrees with the use of the concept of information in the context of signal transmission, the basic senses of information in his view al referring "to telling something or to the something that is being told. Information is addressed to human minds and is received by human minds." All other senses, including its use with regard to nonhuman organisms as well to society as a whole, are, according to Machlup, metaphoric and, as in the case of cybernetics, anthropomorphic.

An activity-theoretical approach to information science. Westport: Greenwood Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Hjørland provided the following example: 
:A stone on a field could contain different information for different people (or from one situation to another). It is not possible for information systems to map all the stone’s possible information for every individual. Nor is any one mapping the one "true" mapping. But people have different educational backgrounds and play different roles in the division of labor in society. A stone in a field represents typical one kind of information for the geologist, another for the archaeologist. The information from the stone can be mapped into different collective knowledge structures produced by e.g. geology and archaeology. Information can be identified, described, represented in information systems for different domains of knowledge. Of course, there are much uncertainty and many and difficult problems in determining whether a thing is informative or not for a domain. Some domains have high degree of consensus and rather explicit criteria of relevance. Other domains have different, conflicting paradigms, each containing its own more or less implicate view of the informativeness of different kinds of information sources. (Hjørland, 1997, p. 111, emphasis in original).

==Academic discipline==
'''Information history''' is an emerging discipline related to, but broader than, [[library history]]. An important introduction and review was made by Alistair Black (2006).&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;Black, A. (2006). Information history. Annual Review of Information Science and Technology, 40 , 441-473.&lt;/ref&gt;
A prolific scholar in this field is also Toni Weller, for example, Weller (2007, 2008, 2010a and 2010b).&lt;ref&gt;Weller, Toni (2007). Information history: its importance, relevance and future.  ASLIB Proceedings, 59(4-5), 437-448.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weller, Toni (2008). Information History—An Introduction: Exploring an Emergent Field. Oxford: Chandos Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weller, Toni (2010a), An Information History Decade: A Review of the Literature and Concepts, 2000–2009, Library &amp; Information History, 26 (1), 83-97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weller, Toni (Ed) (2010b), Information History in the Modern World: Histories of the Information Age, Palgrave Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; As part of her work Toni Weller has argued that there are important links between the modern information age and its historical precedents.&lt;ref&gt;Weller, Toni (June 2010), 'The Victorian Information Age: Nineteenth Century Answers to Today's Information Policy Questions?', History &amp; Policy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bowlby, Chris (November 2010), 'The Victorians were every bit as inquisitive as us', BBC History Magazine. http://www.historyextra.com/feature/victorians-were-every-bit-inquisitive-us&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weller, Toni (2012), 'The Information State: A Historical Perspective on Surveillance' in Lyon, Haggerty &amp; Ball (Eds), Routledge Handbook of Surveillance Studies&lt;/ref&gt; A description from Russia is Volodin (2000).&lt;ref&gt;Volodin, B.F. (2000).  History of librarianship, library history, or information history: A view from Russia. Library Quarterly, 70(4), 446-467.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alistair Black (2006, p.&amp;nbsp;445) wrote: "This chapter explores issues of discipline definition and legitimacy by segmenting information history into its various components: 
* The history of print and written culture, including relatively long-established areas such as the histories of libraries and librarianship, book history, publishing history, and the history of reading.
* The history of more recent information disciplines and practice, that is to say, the history of information management, information systems, and information science.
* The history of contiguous areas, such as the history of the information society and information infrastructure, necessarily enveloping communication history (including telecommunications history) and the history of information policy.
* The history of information as social history, with emphasis on the importance of informal information networks."

"Bodies influential in the field include the American Library Association’s Round Table on Library History, the Library History Section of the [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] (IFLA), and, in the U.K., the Library and Information History Group of the [[Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals]] (CILIP). Each of these bodies has been busy in recent years, running conferences and seminars, and initiating scholarly projects. Active library history groups function in many other countries, including Germany (The Wolfenbuttel Round Table on Library History, the History of the Book and the History of Media, located at the Herzog August Bibliothek), Denmark (The Danish Society for Library History, located at the Royal School of Library and Information Science), Finland (The Library History Research Group, University of Tamepere), and Norway (The Norwegian Society for Book and Library History). Sweden has no official group dedicated to the subject, but interest is generated by the existence of a museum of librarianship in Bods, established by the Library Museum Society and directed by Magnus Torstensson. Activity in Argentina, where, as in Europe and the U.S., a "new library history" has developed, is described by Parada (2004)." (Black (2006, p. 447).&lt;ref name="Black"/&gt;

==Information technology (IT)==
The term IT is ambiguous although mostly synonym with computer technology. Haigh (2011, pp. 432-433) wrote 
:"In fact, the great majority of references to information technology have always been concerned with computers, although the exact meaning has shifted over time (Kline, 2006). The phrase received its first prominent usage in a Harvard Business Review article (Haigh, 2001b;&lt;ref&gt;Haigh, Thomas (2001b). Inventing information systems; The systems men and the computer, 1950-1968. Business History Review, 75(1), 15-61.&lt;/ref&gt; Leavitt &amp; Whisler, 1958&lt;ref&gt;Leavitt, H. J. &amp; Whisler, T. L. (1958). Management in the 1980s. Harward Business Review, 36(6), 41-48.&lt;/ref&gt;) intended to promote a technocratic vision for the future of business management. Its initial definition was at the conjunction of computers, operations research methods, and simulation techniques. Having failed initially to gain much traction (unlike related terms of a similar vintage such as information systems, information processing, and information science) it was revived in policy and economic circles in the 1970s with a new meaning. Information technology now described the expected convergence of the computing, media, and telecommunications industries (and their technologies), understood within the broader context of a wave of enthusiasm for the computer revolution, [[post-industrial society]], information society (Webster, 1995&lt;ref&gt;Webster, F. (1995). Theories of the information society. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;), and other fashionable expressions of the belief that new electronic technologies were bringing a profound rupture with the past. As it spread broadly during the 1980s, IT increasingly lost its association with communications (and, alas, any vestigial connection to the idea of anybody actually being informed of anything) to become a new and more pretentious way of saying "computer". The final step in this process is the recent surge in references to "information and communication technologies" or ICTs, a coinage that makes sense only if one assumes that a technology can inform without communicating".&lt;ref&gt;Haigh, Thomas (2011). The history of information technology. Annual Review of Information Science and Technology, 45, 431-487.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people use the term ''information technology'' about technologies used before the development of the computer.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Jeremy G. (1997). A History of Information Technology and Systems. http://www.tcf.ua.edu/AZ/ITHistoryOutline.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This is however to use the term as a [[retronym]].

==Information society==
{{See also|Information Age|Information revolution}}
"It is said that we live in an "Age of Information," but it is an open scandal that there is no theory, nor even definition, of information that is both broad and precise enough to make such an assertion meaningful." (Goguen, 1997).&lt;ref name="Goguen"/&gt;

The Danish Internet researcher Niels Ole Finnemann (2001)&lt;ref&gt;Finnemann, Niels Ole (2001). The Internet-A New Communicational Infrastructure. Manuscript for the 15th Nordic Conference on Media and Communication Research, "New Media, New opportunities, New Societies", University of Iceland in Reykjavik, Iceland, August 11th-13th, 2001. Tilgængelig: https://web.archive.org/web/20040328165322/http://cfi.imv.au.dk/pub/skriftserie/002_finnemann.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; developed a general history of media. He wrote: "A society cannot exist in which the production and exchange of information are of only minor significance. For this reason one cannot compare industrial societies to information societies in any consistent way. Industrial societies are necessarily also information societies, and information societies may also be industrial societies." He suggested the following media matrix:&lt;ref&gt;Gleick, James (2011).''The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood.''New York: Pantheon Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Oral cultures based mainly on speech.
# Literate cultures: speech + writing (primary alphabets and number systems).
# Print cultures: speech + written texts + print.
# Mass-media cultures: speech + written texts + print + analogue electric media.
# Second-order alphabetic cultures: speech + written texts + print + analogue electric media + digital media.

==Information science==
{{See also|Information science#History|Cranfield experiments|Documentation science|Information scientist}}
Many information science historians cite [[Paul Otlet]] and [[Henri La Fontaine]] as the fathers of information science with the founding of the [[International Institute of Bibliography]] (IIB) in 1895&lt;ref&gt;Rayward, W. B. (1994). International federation for information and documentation. In W. A. Wiegand, &amp; D. G. David Jr. (Eds.), The encyclopedia of library history (pp. 290–294). New York: Garland Publishing, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hahn, Trudi Bellardo &amp; Buckland, Michael (eds.). (1998). ''Historical studies in information science.'' Medford, NJ: Information Today, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Institutionally, information science emerged in the last part of the 19th century as [[documentation science]] which in general shifted name to [[information science]] in the 1960s.

Heting Chu (2010) classified the history and development of information representation and retrieval (IRR) in four phases. "The history of IRR is not long. A retrospective look at the field identifies increased demand, rapid growth, the demystification phase, and the networked era as the four major stages IRR has experienced in its development:" &lt;ref&gt;Chu, Heting (2010).’’  Information Representation and Retrieval in the Digital Age’’, Second Edition. Medford, NJ: Information Today&lt;/ref&gt;

# Increased Demand (1940s–early 1950s) ([[Information explosion]])
# Rapid Growth (1950s–1980s) (the emergence of computers and systems such as [[Dialog (online database)]])
# Demystification Phase (1980s–1990s) (systems developed for end-user searching)
# The Networked Era (1990s–Present) (search enginees such as [[AltaVista]] and [[Google]])

In electronics, '''logic synthesis''' is a process by which an abstract specification of desired [[circuit (electronics)|circuit]] behavior, typically at [[register transfer level]] (RTL), is turned into a design implementation in terms of [[logic gates]], typically by a [[computer program]] called a ''synthesis tool''. Common examples of this process include synthesis of designs specified in [[Hardware Description Language|hardware description language]]s, including [[VHDL]] and [[Verilog]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-884-complex-digital-systems-spring-2005/lecture-notes/l05_synthesis.pdf|title=Synthesis:Verilog to Gates}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some synthesis tools generate [[bitstream]]s for [[programmable logic device]]s such as [[programmable array logic|PAL]]s or [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA]]s, while others target the creation of [[ASIC]]s. Logic synthesis is one aspect of [[electronic design automation]].

== History of logic synthesis ==
The roots of logic synthesis can be traced to the treatment of logic by [[George Boole]] (1815 to 1864), in what is now termed [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]]. In 1938, [[Claude Elwood Shannon|Claude Shannon]] showed that the two-valued [[Boolean algebra]] can describe the operation of switching circuits.  In the early days, '''logic design''' involved manipulating the [[truth table]] representations as [[Karnaugh map]]s. The Karnaugh map-based minimization of logic is guided by a set of rules on how entries in the maps can be combined. A human designer can typically only work with Karnaugh maps containing up to four to six variables.

The first step toward automation of [[logic minimization]] was the introduction of the [[Quine&amp;ndash;McCluskey algorithm]] that could be implemented on a computer.
This exact minimization technique presented the notion of prime implicants and minimum cost covers that would become the cornerstone of [[two-level minimization]]. Nowadays, the much more efficient [[Espresso heuristic logic minimizer]] has become the standard tool for this operation.{{update inline|date=May 2017|reason=This correctly describes the situation around 1995. We need to expand this to include the changes of the past twenty years, however.}} Another area of early research was in state minimization and encoding of [[finite state machine]]s (FSMs), a task that was the bane of designers. The applications for logic synthesis lay primarily in digital computer design. Hence, [[IBM]] and [[Bell Labs]] played a pivotal role in the early automation of logic synthesis. The evolution from [[discrete logic]] components to [[programmable logic array]]s (PLAs) hastened the need for efficient two-level minimization, since minimizing terms in a two-level representation reduces the area in a PLA.

However, two-level logic circuits are of limited importance in a [[very-large-scale integration]] (VLSI) design; most designs use multiple levels of logic. As a matter of fact, almost any circuit representation in RTL or Behavioural Description is a multi-level representation. An early system that was used to design multilevel circuits was LSS from IBM. It used local transformations to simplify logic. Work on LSS and the Yorktown Silicon Compiler spurred rapid research progress in logic synthesis in the 1980s. Several universities
contributed by making their research available to the public, most notably SIS from [[University of California, Berkeley]], RASP from [[University of California, Los Angeles]] and BOLD from [[University of Colorado, Boulder]].  Within a decade, the technology migrated to commercial logic synthesis products offered by electronic design automation companies.

==Logic elements==
''Logic design'' is a step in the standard design cycle in which the [[functional design]] of an [[electronic circuit]] is converted into the representation which captures [[Boolean algebra (logic)|logic operations]], [[arithmetic operations]], [[control flow]], etc. A common output of this step is [[RTL description]]. Logic design is commonly followed by the [[circuit design]] step. In modern [[electronic design automation]] parts of the logical design may be automated using [[high-level synthesis]] tools based on the behavioral description of the circuit.&lt;ref name="Sherwani1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Naveed A. Sherwani|title=Algorithms for VLSI physical design automation|year=1999|edition=3rd|page=4|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|isbn=978-0-7923-8393-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Baops.gif|right|thumb|450px|Various representations of Boolean operations]]

Logic operations usually consist of boolean AND, OR, XOR and NAND operations, and are the most basic forms of operations in an electronic circuit. Arithmetic operations are usually implemented with the use of logic operators. Circuits such as a [[binary multiplier]] or a [[binary adder]] are examples of more complex binary operations that can be implemented using basic logic operators.

== High-level synthesis or behavioral synthesis ==
{{Main|High-level synthesis}}

With a goal of increasing designer productivity, research efforts on the synthesis of circuits specified at the behavioral level have led to the emergence of commercial solutions in 2004,&lt;ref name='EETimes'&gt;EETimes: [http://archives.eetimes.com/high-level-synthesis-rollouts-enable-esl/110436.html High-level synthesis rollouts enable ESL]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; which are used for complex ASIC and FPGA design. These tools automatically synthesize circuits specified using high-level languages, like ANSI C/C++ or SystemC, to a register transfer level (RTL) specification, which can be used as input to a gate-level logic synthesis flow.&lt;ref name="EETimes"/&gt; Using high-level synthesis, also known as ESL synthesis, the allocation of work to clock cycles and across structural components, such as floating-point ALUs, is done by the compiler using an optimisation procedure, whereas with RTL logic synthesis (even from behavioural Verilog or VHDL, where a thread of execution can make multiple reads and writes to a variable within a clock cycle) those allocation decisions have already been made.

== Multi-level logic minimization ==
{{see also|Logic optimization|Circuit minimization}}
Typical practical implementations of a logic function utilize a multi-level network of logic elements.
Starting from an RTL description of a design, the synthesis tool constructs a corresponding multilevel [[Boolean network]].

Next, this network is optimized using several technology-independent techniques before technology-dependent optimizations are performed. The typical cost function during technology-independent optimizations is total [[Propositional formula#Literal.2C term and alterm|literal]]
count of the factored representation of the logic function (which correlates quite well with circuit area).

Finally, technology-dependent optimization transforms the
technology-independent circuit into a network of gates in a given technology. The simple cost estimates are replaced by more concrete, implementation-driven estimates during and after technology mapping.  Mapping is constrained by factors such as the available gates (logic functions) in the technology library, the drive sizes for each gate, and the delay, [[Electric power|power]], and area characteristics of each gate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5206">'''Machine element''' refers to an elementary component of a [[machine]].  These elements consist of three basic types:
# ''[[Structural_element|structural components]]'' such as frame members, [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]], [[Axle|axles]], [[Spline_(mechanical)|splines]], [[fastener]]s, [[Seal (mechanical)|seal]]s, and [[lubricant]]s, 
# ''[[Mechanism (engineering)|mechanisms]]'' that [[Motion_control|control movement]] in various ways such as [[gear train]]s, [[belt (mechanical)|belt]] or [[chain drive]]s, [[Linkage (mechanical)|linkages]], [[cam]] and [[cam follower|follower]] systems, including [[brake]]s and [[clutch]]es, and 
# ''[[Control_system|control components]]'' such as buttons, switches, indicators, sensors, actuators and computer controllers.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Norton, '''Machine Design,''' (4th Edition), Prentice-Hall, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  

While generally not considered to be a machine element, the shape, texture and color of covers are an important part of a machine that provide a [[industrial design|styling and operational interface]] between the mechanical components of a machine and its users.

''Machine elements'' are basic mechanical parts and features used as the building blocks of most [[machine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Matthews | first = Clifford | last2 = [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] | title = ASME engineer's data book | page = 249 | publisher = ASME Press | year = 2005 | edition = 2nd | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dPS2KU0gj-8C&amp;pg=PA249 | isbn = 978-0-7918-0229-8 | postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most are [[Technical standard|standardized]] to common sizes, but customs are also common for specialized applications.&lt;ref name="bhandari"&gt;{{Citation | last = Bhandari | first = V.

Machine elements may be features of a part (such as screw threads or integral plain bearings) or they may be discrete parts in and of themselves such as wheels, axles, pulleys, [[rolling-element bearing]]s, or gears. All of the [[simple machine]]s may be described as machine elements, and many machine elements incorporate concepts of one or more simple machines.  For example, a [[leadscrew]] incorporates a [[screw thread]], which is an [[inclined plane]] wrapped around a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]. 

Many mechanical design, invention, and engineering tasks involve a knowledge of various machine elements and an intelligent and creative combining of these elements into a component or assembly that fills a need (serves an application).

== Origins and scope ==
Richard A. Ingram, a senior research fellow in the School of Disability Studies at [[Ryerson University]] (2007), has been credited with coining the phrase "Mad Studies" at the First Regional Graduate/Undergraduate Student Disability Studies Conference at Syracuse University on May 3, 2008.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ingram|first=Richard A.|date=|title=Doing Mad Studies: Making (Non)sense Together|url=http://journals.library.mun.ca/ojs/index.php/IJ/article/view/1680/1327|journal=Intersectionalities|volume= 5| issue =  3 (Special Issue) Mad Studies: Intersections with Disability Studies, Social Work, and ‘Mental Health’|pages=11–17|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://player.fm/series/mentally-sound-radio-show/mentally-sound-show-9-131115-6dHUzEqRe4Rzci2m|title=Mentally Sound Radio Show #9|last=McGowan|first=Victoria|date=November 13, 2015|work=Mentally Sound Radio Show|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an academic article entitled "Doing Mad Studies: Making (Non)sense Together," Ingram points to a number of theorists who created the intellectual groundwork for the field, including [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[Georges Bataille|Bataille]], [[Maurice Blanchot|Blanchot]], [[Gilles Deleuze|Deleuze]], and [[Félix Guattari|Guattari]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In a 2014 ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' article, Peter Beresford names Canadian scholars at the forefront of this academic field: "Mad studies has been pioneered by Ryerson and [[York University|York]] Universities in Toronto, with key figures such as mental health survivors, activists and educators David Reville and Geoffrey Reaume and academics Kathryn Church and Brenda LeFrancois."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/oct/07/mad-studies-voice-of-sanity-psychiatry|title=Mad studies brings a voice of sanity to psychiatry|last=Beresford|first=Peter|date=October 7, 2014|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist Alex Gillis summarizes the spread of mad studies programs in a November 2015 article: "Soon after Ryerson and York launched mad studies courses in the early 2000s, similar courses began in Simon Fraser University’s department of sociology and anthropology, and more recently at Memorial University’s school of social work, Queen’s University’s school of kinesiology and health studies, and the history departments at Trent University and the University of Winnipeg. A few universities in England, Scotland and the Netherlands launched courses in the past two years, using Canadian courses as models."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.universityaffairs.ca/features/feature-article/mad-studies/|title=The Rise of Mad Studies|last=Gillis|first=Alex|date=November 3, 2015|work=University Affairs|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some dimensions of this emerging field may include research on the "social construction of 'mental illness, normalizing imperatives of the state and medicine, rapidly expanding nosologies (categories of pathology) for mental illness, collusion(s) of pharmaceutical corporations and professional associations within psychiatry, connections between ecocide and mental stress, psychiatrization of nonhuman animals, representation(s) of madness in media, history of consumer/survivor movement(s), and the rise and fall of mental treatments within scientific, medical, and lay communities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ashevilleradicalmentalhealth.wordpress.com/mad-studies/|title=Mad Studies|last=|first=|date=|website=Asheville Radical Mental Health Collective|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hobby has been adopted by celebrities such as [[James Haskell]], the English rugby player.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://magnetstore.co.uk/james-haskell-fishing-magnet/|title=Magnet Store Blog|last=|first=|date=2018-02-12|website=Magnet Store|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[hobby]] is a combination of [[environmentalism]] and [[treasure hunting]]. The magnets used are strong enough to remove large [[debris]] such as discarded [[bicycle]]s, guns, safes, bombs, coins and car [[tire]] [[Rim (wheel)|rims]] from [[body of water|bodies of water]], but many who engage in the hobby are hoping to find rare and valuable items as well. 

It is thought magnet fishing was initially started by boaters using magnets to recover fallen keys from the water.&lt;ref name="Elliott"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Elliott |first1=Coran |title=Safety warning as rise in magnet fishing hobby sees anglers fish out guns and grenades in UK rivers |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/08/18/safety-warning-rise-magnet-fishing-hobby-sees-anglers-fish-guns/ |accessdate=23 August 2018 |work=The Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited |date=18 August 2018 |archiveurl=https://i.imgur.com/SskJfIT.png |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today magnet retrieval tools are specially designed to retrieve items that are lost at the bottom of bodies of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Go Fishing With Magnets|url=https://www.apexmagnets.com/news-how-tos/how-to-go-fishing-with-magnets/|website=Apex Magnets|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two main types of magnets. These are double sided and single sided magnets.  

People who engage in the hobby may be referred to as "magnetfishers," "magneteers," "MF'ers" or "neodemons," (a play on neodymium). With the hobby still in its infancy none of the names has taken root yet.&lt;ref name="reddit"&gt;{{cite web|title=We're called "magnateers?"|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/magnetfishing/comments/76vu40/were_called_magnateers/|website=[[Reddit]]|publisher=reddit inc|accessdate=20 October 2017|language=English|format=HTML|date=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;



==Magnet fishing and the law==
There have been no major reports of magnetfishers failing to observe [[Land tenure|landowners]], local authority regulations concerning outdoor waters, or seeking permissions where appropriate.&lt;ref name="Magnet-Fishing Ultimate Guide"&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Magnet Fishing Illegal?|url=https://www.magnet-fishing.com/|website=Magnet-Fishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However it is illegal, and punishable by a ₤25 fine, to magnetfish, or remove any material from canal or inland navigation under the control of the [[Canal &amp; River Trust]] in [[England]] or [[Wales]], other than the [[Lee Navigation|Lee]] and [[Stort Navigation]], [[Gloucester and Sharpness Canal]], and [[River Severn#Navigation|River Severn Navigation]].&lt;ref name="Canal"&gt;{{cite web |title=General Canal Bye-laws |url=http://www.britishwaterways.co.uk/media/documents/foi/legal/BW_General_Canal_Bye-laws.pdf |website=British Waterways |publisher=British Waterways Board |accessdate=21 August 2018 |language=English |format=PDF |date=1965 |quote=41. No person unless authorised by the Board in that behalf or otherwise legally entitled so to do shall: (d) Dredge or remove coal or other material from any canal.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Trust spokesperson Fran Read stated "Magnet fishing can have its dangers, and consequently it is expressly prohibited by the Trust." An example of this being A news report by ITV Central which included a video of a family recording an incident of one of their children pulling a sawn-off shotgun out of Titford Canal in Oldbury, West Midlands, on Sunday 26 August. They later rang the police and the gun was removed and taken for analysis.  &lt;ref name="Elliott"/&gt;  The Trust refrains from legal action for first-time offenders.&lt;ref name="Elliott"/&gt;

[[Amateur]] magnetfishers in [[Belgium]] helped the [[police]] by recovering new evidence, specifically [[firearm]]s and [[ammunition]], related to the [[crime]]s of the [[Brabant killers]].&lt;ref name="Bende van Nijvel"&gt;{{cite news|author1=&lt;!-- Not stated --&gt;|title='Magneetvissers' bezorgen dozen met munitie en wapens aan speurders Bende van Nijvel|url=https://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20171026_03154116|accessdate=27 October 2017|work=De Standaard|agency=Raad voor de journalistiek|publisher=Nieuwsblad.be|date=26 October 2017|location=Antwerp, Belgium|language=Dutch|format=HTML}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In general, Police urge those that find weapons or similar items to contact them.&lt;ref name="Elliott"/&gt;&lt;ref name="What to do if you find a gun while magnet fishing"&gt;{{cite web |last1=|title=What to do if you find a gun while magnet fishing |url=http://magnetfishingpros.com/find-gun-while-magnet-fishing/ |website=www.magnetfishingpros.com |publisher=|accessdate=26 September 2018|date=2018-09-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''medieval popular Bible''' is a term used especially in literary studies, but also in art history and other disciplines, to encompass the wide variety of presentations of [[Bible|biblical material]] in medieval culture not directly recorded in the [[exegesis|exegetical tradition]].

The "exegetical tradition" means the vast corpus of Latin writings, often [[List of Bible commentaries|biblical commentaries]], [[sermon]]s or preaching handbooks, diatribes against doctrinal deviancy and philosophical explorations, in which scholars of the medieval [[Christian Church|Church]] present the Bible according to medieval orthodoxy. Its intended readership is, in the first instance, other theologians.

In contrast to this, the "medieval popular Bible" is aimed at the ordinary population of medieval Europe, and to some extent is also created by them. It ranges from very pious vernacular writings such as the Biblical Epic to scurrillous [[fabliau]]x in which biblical figures make an appearance. It includes most [[Liturgical drama|religious drama]], much [[stained glass]] and some wild and fanciful retellings of [[Bible story|Bible stories]].   

The [[forbidden fruit]] is a standard example. The [[Bible]] itself does not say what kind of fruit it was, but in the popular retelling, as opposed to the theological schools, it became an [[apple]].  Since the apple served well to communicate spiritual ideas, the exegetical tradition did not resist it. In the medieval understanding of biblical truth, there was no need for a modern style of debate on the accuracy of the motif.

Serious work on this area of [[medieval culture]] probably began with [[Beryl Smalley]] in the 1940s. The term "medieval popular Bible" became established in scholarship relatively recently as a result of the writings of [[Brian O. Murdoch]], though the phrase had been used before him, usually in a less clearly defined way.&lt;ref&gt;H. L. Spencer,  "Review of Brian Murdoch. The Medieval Popular Bible: Expansions of Genesis in the Middle Ages," ''Review of English Studies'', 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8849">A '''mixotroph''' is an organism that can use a mix of different [[Primary nutritional groups|sources of energy and carbon]], instead of having a single trophic mode on the continuum from complete [[autotrophy]] at one end to [[heterotrophy]] at the other.

Possible combinations are   [[phototroph|photo-]] and [[chemotroph]]y, [[lithotroph|litho-]] and [[organotroph]]y, [[autotroph|auto-]] and [[heterotroph]]y or other combinations of these. Mixotrophs can be either [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] or [[prokaryote|prokaryotic]].&lt;ref name='Eiler'&gt;{{cite journal |author= Eiler A |title= Evidence for the Ubiquity of Mixotrophic Bacteria in the Upper Ocean: Implications and Consequences |journal=Appl Environ Microbiol |volume=72 |issue=12 |pages= 7431–7|date=December 2006|pmid=17028233 |doi=10.1128/AEM.01559-06|pmc=1694265}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can take advantage of different environmental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Katechakis A, Stibor H |title= The mixotroph ''Ochromonas tuberculata'' may invade and suppress specialist phago- and phototroph plankton communities depending on nutrient conditions |journal= Oecologia|volume= 148 |issue= 4|pages=692–701 |date=July 2006|pmid=16568278 |doi= 10.1007/s00442-006-0413-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a trophic mode is obligate, then it is always necessary for sustaining growth and maintenance; if facultative, it can be used as a supplemental source.&lt;ref name='Eiler'/&gt; Some organisms have incomplete [[Calvin cycle]]s, so they are incapable of fixing carbon dioxide and must use organic carbon sources.

==Types of mixotrophy==

Organisms may employ mixotrophy '''obligately''' or '''facultatively'''.
* Obligate mixotrophy: in order to support growth and maintenance, an organism must utilize both heterotrophic and autotrophic means.
* Obligate autotrophy with facultative heterotrophy: Autotrophy alone is sufficient for growth and maintenance, but heterotrophy may be used as a supplementary strategy when autotrophic energy is not enough, for example, when light intensity is low.
* Facultative autotrophy with obligate heterotrophy: Heterotrophy is sufficient for growth and maintenance, but autotrophy may be used to supplement, for example, when prey availability is very low.
* Facultative mixotrophy: Maintenance and growth may be obtained by heterotrophic or autotrophic means alone, and mixotrophy is used only when necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schoonhoven|first1=Erwin|title=Ecophysiology of Mixotrophs|journal=Thesis|date=January 19, 2000|url=http://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/education/Scho2000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to characterize the sub-domains within mixotrophy, several very similar categorization schemes have been suggested.

Consider the example of a marine protist with heterotrophic and photosynthetic capabilities:
In the breakdown put forward by Jones,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jones |first=H.J.L. |date=1997|title=A classification of mixotrophic protists based on their behaviour |journal= Freshwater Biology  |volume=37 |pages=35–43 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2427.1997.00138.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are four mixotrophic groups based on relative roles of phagotrophy and phototrophy.
* A: Heterotrophy (phagotrophy) is the norm, and phototrophy is only used when prey concentrations are limiting.
* B: Phototrophy is the dominant strategy, and phagotrophy is employed as a supplement when light is limiting.
* C: Phototrophy results in substances for both growth and ingestion, phagotrophy is employed when light is limiting.
* D: Phototrophy is most common nutrition type, phagotrophy only used during prolonged dark periods, when light is extremely limiting.

An alternative scheme by Stoeker&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stoecker |first=D.K. |date=1998|title=Conceptual models of mixotrophy in planktonic protists and some ecological and evolutionary implications |journal=European Journal of Protistology |volume=34 |pages=281–290 |doi=10.1016/s0932-4739(98)80055-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; also takes into account the role of nutrients and growth factors, and includes mixotrophs that have a photosynthetic symbiont or who retain chloroplasts from their prey. This scheme characterizes mixotrophs by their efficiency.
* Type 1: "Ideal mixotrophs" who utilize prey and sunlight equally well
* Type 2: Supplement phototrophic activity with food consumption
* Type 3: Primarily heterotrophic, use phototrophic activity during times of very low prey abundance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tarangkoon|first1=Woraporn|title=Mixtrophic Protists among Marine Ciliates and Dinoflagellates: Distribution, Physiology and Ecology|journal=Thesis|date=29 April 2010|url=http://www.bi.ku.dk/bibliotek/phd/Woraporn%20Tarangkoon.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

* ''[[Paracoccus|Paracoccus pantotrophus]]'' is a bacterium that can live chemoorganoheterotrophically, whereby a large variety of organic compounds can be metabolized. Also a facultative [[lithotroph|chemolithoautotrophic]] metabolism is possible, as seen in colorless sulfur bacteria (some ''Thiobacillus''), whereby sulfur compounds such as [[hydrogen sulfide]], elemental [[sulfur]], or [[thiosulfate]] are oxidized to sulfate. The sulfur compounds serve as [[electron donors]] and are consumed to produce [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].  The carbon source for these organisms can be carbon dioxide (autotrophy) or organic carbon (heterotrophy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Libes| first= Susan M.| title= Introduction to marine biogeochemistry| year= 2009| edition=2| publisher= Academic Press| page= 192| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KVZJUw4nORgC&amp;pg=PA192&amp;dq=chemolithoheterotrophs+inorganic&amp;lr=&amp;cd=53#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| isbn= 978-0-7637-5345-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Dworkin| first= Martin | title= The Prokaryotes: Ecophysiology and biochemistry| year= 2006| edition= 3rd| volume= 2| publisher= Springer| page= 988| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=uleTr2jKzJMC&amp;pg=PA988&amp;dq=chemolithoheterotroph+chemoorganoheterotroph&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=chemolithoheterotroph%20chemoorganoheterotroph&amp;f=false| isbn= 978-0-387-25492-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lengeler | first1= Joseph W.| last2= Drews| first2= Gerhart| last3= Schlegel| first3= Hans Günter | title= Biology of the Prokaryotes| year= 1999| publisher= Georg Thieme Verlag| page= 238| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MiwpFtTdmjQC&amp;pg=PA238&amp;dq=chemolithoheterotroph+sulfur+bacteria&amp;cd=6#v=onepage&amp;q=chemolithoheterotroph%20sulfur%20bacteria&amp;f=false| isbn= 978-3-13-108411-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organoheterotrophy can occur under [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] or under [[Aerobic organism|anaerobic]] conditions; lithoautotrophy takes place aerobically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bartosik D, Sochacka M, Baj J |title= Identification and Characterization of Transposable Elements of ''Paracoccus pantotrophus'' |journal= J Bacteriol |volume=185 |issue=13 |pages= 3753–63|date=July 2003|pmid=12813068 |doi= 10.1128/JB.185.13.3753-3763.2003|pmc=161580}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Friedrich| first=Cornelius G.|title=Microbial Sulfur Metabolism|year=2007|chapter=Redox Control of Chemotrophic Sulfur Oxidation of ''Paracoccus pantotrophus''|pages=139–150|publisher=Springer|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/x412771504738714/|display-authors=etal}} [http://www.springerlink.com/content/x412771504738714/fulltext.pdf?page=1 PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plants ==
Amongst plants, mixotrophy classically applies to [[Carnivorous plant|carnivorous]], [[Parasitic plant#Classification|hemi-parasitic]] and [[Myco-heterotrophy|myco-heterotrophic]] species. However, this characterisation as mixotrophic could be extended to a higher number of clades as research demonstrates that organic forms of nitrogen and phosphorus — such as DNA, proteins, amino-acids or carbohydrates — are also part of the nutrient supplies of a number of plant species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1071/FP13061 | issn = 1445-4408 | volume = 40 | issue = 5 | pages = 425 | last = Schmidt | first = Susanne |author2=John A.

==History==
There is no proof for administration of Muslim personal law until 1206 in Indian peninsula, even though there were Muslim invasions during this period.&lt;ref name="abdulrahiman"/&gt; During the reign of Slave dynasty  (1206-1290 A.D), Khalji dynasty (1290- 1321), the Tughlak dynasty (1321-1413), the Lodi dynasty (1451 - 1526) and the Sur dynasty (1539- 1555), the court of Shariat, assisted by the Mufti, dealt with the cases involving personal law among Muslims. During Sher Shah's regime, the powers of Shariat court were restricted and Muslim law was modified to suit the requirements of the times.&lt;ref name="abdulrahiman"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rahiman|first1=Abdul, K.K|title=History of the Evolution of Muslim Personal Law in India|url=http://www.dharmaramjournals.in/ArticleFiles/History%20of%20the%20Evolution%20of%20Muslim%20Personal%20Law--K.%20K.%20Abdul%20Rahiman.pdf|publisher=Journal of Dharma: Dharmaram Journal  of Religions and Philosophies|accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the regime of [[Mughal dynasty|Mughal kings]] [[Babur]] and [[Humayun]], the earlier laws were followed, and the ''ulemas'' (religious scholars) had considerable influence on legal decisions. During Akhbar's regime, Ulemas' powers were significantly reduced and shattered the dominance of the orthodox Sunni school. During [[Jehangir]]'s regime, cutting of noses and ears and death penalty could not be inflicted without the permission of the Emperor. Aurangazeb ordered for the complication of code of law.&lt;ref name="abdulrahiman" /&gt;

===Under East India Company===
Under the East India company, Muslim Law was enforced except when Muslims left the disputes to be determined according to Hindu ''Saastras''.&lt;ref name="abdulrahiman" /&gt; The Regulation 11 of .1772 by Sec. 27 enacted that {{Quote
|text= "in all suits regarding inheritance, succession, marriage and caste and other religious usages or institutions, the laws of the Quran with respect of Mohamedan and those of the Shastras with respect to Gentoos (Hindus) shall be invariably adhered to."}}
In 1822, the Privy Council recognized the right of [[Shia]] Muslims to their own law.

===Under British India===
The Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act was passed on 7 October 1937 in [[British India]] to ensure that Indians following Islamic faith shall be ruled according to their cultural norms.&lt;ref name="indianexpress1"/&gt; This Act gave strength to the pre-existing customary laws, although it was in conflict with Islamic jurisprudence in several aspects.&lt;ref name="abdulrahiman" /&gt; This Act is still being followed in India in matters related to marriage, divorce and succession among Muslims.&lt;ref name="indianexpress1"/&gt;&lt;ref name= scroll&gt;{{cite web|last1=Daniyal|first1=Shoaib|title=A short history of Muslim personal law in  India|url=https://scroll.in/article/849068/a-short-history-of-muslim-personal-law-in-india|website=Scroll.in|publisher=Scroll.in|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dissolution of Muslim Marriage Act was passed in 1939, in order to give Muslim women the right to seek divorce.

==Marriage and Divorce==
In India, Muslim marriage is a civil contract between a man and a woman. Dissolution of marriage can be done at the instance of the husband (''[[talaq]]''), wife (''[[khula]]'') or mutually (''[[mubarat]]''). Talaq allows Muslim men to legally divorce his wife by stating the word talaq (Arabic word for divorce) three times with 3 months period between all three, in oral. written and electronic form of talaq is not allowed in Islamic law.&lt;ref name= practicallaw&gt;{{cite web|title=Practical Law UK Signon|url=https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/6-581-5985?transitionType=Default&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)&amp;firstPage=true&amp;bhcp=1|website=uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com|publisher=Thompson Reuters|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Muslim groups recognize [[Triple talaq in India|triple talaq]] (or talaq-i-biddat), stating three talaqs at once and proclaiming instant divorce as valid method of divorce.&lt;ref name="hanafi"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hanafi jurisprudence sanctions triple talaq - Times of India|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/hanafi-jurisprudence-sanctions-triple-talaq/articleshow/60182584.cms|website=The Times of India|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 August 2017, the [[Supreme Court of India]] deemed instant triple talaq unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Triple Talaq verdict: What exactly is instant divorce practice banned by court?|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/triple-talaq-verdict-what-exactly-is-instant-divorce-practice-banned-by-court/story-mhQ1SbxnCUUgySQq82sdbJ.html|website=hindustantimes.com|publisher=Hindustan Times|accessdate=2 December 2017|language=en|date=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Muslim groups follow ''talaq-i-hasan'', where the husband pronounces three talaqs on three separate instances, each one at least 1 lunar month apart. If the husband changes mind after the first or the second talaq, or cohabits with the wife, the divorce is revoked.&lt;ref name= practicallaw /&gt; In Islam, only husband can pronounce the talaq on his wife, and not vice versa. However, he can delegate this power to his wife or a third person by agreement, called talaq-e-tafweez.&lt;ref name= practicallaw /&gt; The Muslim man does not have to cite a reason for divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Supreme Court suspends 'triple talaq' divorce law|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/08/india-supreme-court-suspends-muslim-divorce-law-170822052829982.html|website=www.aljazeera.com|publisher=Al-Jazeera|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Section 5 of Shariat Act of 1937 concerns with Muslim women seeking dissolution of her marriage. Section 5 was subsequently deleted and replaced by Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act 1939. Muslim women can seek divorce at the court of law. A woman can ask for divorce in the following circumstances:
* if whereabouts of the husband has not been known for a period of four years
* if the husband has neglected or failed to provide for her maintenance for a period of two years
* if the husband has been sentenced to imprisonment for a period of seven years or upwards
* if the husband has failed to perform his marital obligations for a period of three years
* if the husband was impotent at the time of marriage and continues to do so
* if the husband has been insane for a period of two years or is suffering from leprosy or virulent venereal disease
* if the husband treats the wife with cruelty, even if such conduct does not amount to physical violence
* if the wife has been given in marriage by her father or guardian before she attained 15 years of age
* if the husband associates with women of evil repute or leads an infamous life or attempts to force her to lead an immoral life
* if the husband disposes of her property or prevents her exercising her legal rights over it
* if the husband obstructs her in the observance of her religious profession or practice
* if he has more wives than one, does not treat her equitably in accordance with the injunctions of the Quran; or
carries out any other ground recognised as valid for the dissolution of marriages under Muslim law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939|url=https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1458498/|website=indiankanoon.org|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inheritance==
===Rules of inheritance===
* A son gets double the share of the daughter wherever they inherit together.&lt;ref name="makaan" /&gt;
* The wife gets one-eighth of the share if there are children and one-fourth of the share if there are no children. In case the husband has more than one wife, the one-eighth share will be divided equally among all wives. The husband gets one fourth of the share of his dead wife's property,If there are children and one-half if there are no children &lt;ref&gt;mulla mohammaden law vol. 3&lt;/ref&gt;.
* If the parent has more than one daughter, only two-third of the property shall be divided equally among daughters. If the parent has only one daughter, half of the parent's property is inherited by her.
* The mother gets one-sixth of her dead child's property if there are grandchildren, and one-third of the property if there are no grandchildren.
* Parents, children, husband and wife must, in all cases, get shares, whatever may be the number or degree of the other heirs.
* Slavery, homicide, difference of religion and difference of allegiance, exclude from inheritance.

===Mahr===
[[Mahr]] is the total money or property that the husband is required to give the wife at the time of marriage ([[Nikah]]). There are two types of mahr, the prompt mahr which is given to the wife soon after the marriage, and the deferred mahr which is given to the wife when the marriage has ended, either due to the death of the husband or by divorce.&lt;ref name="makaan"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Muslim Woman's Right To Property In Islamic Law|url=https://www.makaan.com/iq/legal-taxes-laws/examining-a-muslim-womans-right-to-property|publisher=Makaan|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Will===
A Muslim can only give one third of his/her total property through a will ([[Wasiyat]]).&lt;ref name="makaan" /&gt;

===Gift===
Any type of property can be given as gift by a Muslim.&lt;ref name="makaan" /&gt;

'''''Neue Berliner Musikzeitung''''' was a musical periodical that appeared in the years 1847-1896 and was published by Bote &amp; Bock. It was a continuation of the Berlin musical newspaper published between 1844-1847 by Karl Gaillard.
 
==History==
The ''Neue Berliner Musikzeitung'' reported extensively on the musical life in Berlin, but also on other cities in [[Germany]] and Europe. And together with the ''[[Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung]]'' and the ''[[Neue Zeitschrift für Musik]]'', it was widely considered the most important and influential music periodical in [[Berlin]] as well as in the German states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vosteen|first=Annette|title=Berliner musikalische Zeitung|url=http://www.ripm.org/journal_info.php5?ABB=BRZ|publisher=RIPM|accessdate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it was the official publication of the Berlin Association of Musicians.
 
It was established by Gustave Bock,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Zeittafel |url=http://www.dtkv-berlin.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=46&amp;Itemid=175 |publisher=DTKV Berlin |accessdate=25 July 2011 |language=de |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328050019/http://www.dtkv-berlin.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=46&amp;Itemid=175 |archivedate=28 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a former board member of the publisher, and Hermann Wolff (1845-1902), a former editorial director. Bock was the agent of [[Ferruccio Busoni]] and responsible for the founding of the Philharmonic Society.

'''Nominal identity''' is the [[identity (disambiguation)|identity]] in name only as opposed to the individual experience of that identity. The concept is often used in sociology, psychology and linguistics.

==Social sciences==
Nominal identity is the name to which one identifies, or calls oneself (i.e. general "African American," "Irish," "Straight," "Gay," "Female," "Male"). Whereas '''virtual identity''' is the experience of that identity, "The latter is, in a sense, what the name means; this is primarily a matter of its consequences for those who bear it, and can change while the nominal identity remains the same (and vice versa)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jenkins |first= Richard |title=Rethinking Ethnicity: Arguments and Explorations |publisher=Sage Publications LTD |year=2001 |location=London, UK |page=72 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qoOj0SSrQrYC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=definition+of+%22nominal+identity%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZnfdIAETQH&amp;sig=MWuGxzYHP_0uU-gENR0_tEDEP4I&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gz6dS_KYIML38AbCl5icDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CBIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=definition%20of%20%22nominal%20identity%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those who self-identify as "gay," the term may not confer the same experience for two people or even between various geographical or cultural regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first=Richard |title=Social Identity |publisher=Routledge |year=2008 |location=Oxon, UK |page=100 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hRIe8YaaBIIC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;lpg=PA100&amp;dq=definition+of+%22nominal+identity%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YVpKCmNEHi&amp;sig=fVvb72cDaQCPAQMvWP3fK97xUZo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gz6dS_KYIML38AbCl5icDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, while one may talk about a "chair," "chair" itself can entail many forms, from arm chair to ladder back to even tree stump, if the experience of "chair" is something upon which a person sits.

[[Pierre Bourdieu]] uses the term nominal identity in ''[[Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste]]'' to mean both that which the identity of a subject is named and also where identity is an insignificant measurement or representation of the "perceived reality" of a subject or phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bourdieu |first=Pierre |authorlink= Pierre Bourdieu |author2=Translated by Richard Nice  |title=Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1984 |location= Cambridge, MA |page=18 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nVaS6gS9Jz4C&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=bourdieu+%22nominal+identity+of+the+%27indicators%27&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bourdieu |first=Pierre |authorlink=Pierre Bourdieu |author2=Translated by Richard Nice  |title=Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1984 |location=Cambridge, MA |page=194 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nVaS6gS9Jz4C&amp;pg=PA194&amp;dq=bourdieu+%22nominal+identity+%28that%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; To further clarify, for Bourdieu nominal identity can often mean "face value" or "appearance." He often mentions the term nominal identity in order to illustrate the idea of a more complex reality, beyond the name, within the studied subject.

===Nominal identity in ethnicity===
Ethnic identity is a "social identity arising through group formation, individual identification with a group, and interaction between different ethnic groups."&lt;ref name="wrong"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Categorically Wrong? Nominal versus Graded Measures of Ethnic Identity |journal=Linguistics and Philosophy |date=2000-09-01 |first=Henry E. |last=Brady |author2=Cynthia S. Kaplan  |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=56–91 |doi=10.1007/BF02699766 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/lf5autv45gqym5we/ |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry E. Brady and Cynthia S. Kaplan compiled a study called "Categorically Wrong? Nominal versus Graded Measures of Ethnic Identity" that takes a look at ethnicity as a nominal identity. Their study proposed whether or not "the attitudes of members of the group with the more salient identity can be completely explained by its nominal identity while the attitudes of the members of the group with less salient identity require a graded measure of ethnicity."&lt;ref name="wrong"/&gt;

Brady and Kaplan focused on the country Estonia, where they posited two groups: "Estonians," and one that they call the "Slavs," a collective group of Russians, Ukrainians, or Belarusians. They chose this geographical area in particular because of the "centrality of ethnicity in the politics of transition in the USSR."&lt;ref name="wrong"/&gt; media usage (such as television, radio, or newspaper, whether it was the Estonia language Republic television or Russian-language media), individuals who identify themselves with another nationality, and the language used at home.

Brady and Kaplan concluded that "ethnicity is not always a nominal characteristic"&lt;ref name="wrong"/&gt; for these two groups in Estonia. It is only nominal when most salient. "Ethnic identity ... causes individuals within a group to form their attitudes based upon their nominal identity".&lt;ref name="wrong"/&gt; Individuals may generalize themselves in a certain category such as their nationality, but when it comes down to variables of different degrees in formulating their ethnicity, it is no longer nominal. It is their way of dividing themselves from a generalized name.

==Linguistics==
Nominal identity in [[linguistics]] pertains to the identity of a word or group of words functioning as a noun or an adjective within a sentence's structure. Specifically, it relates to how one can look at a sentence and propose a different understanding of that sentence through the analysis of its identity defined in its lexical construct, such as in the example used by Chris Barker&lt;ref name="Barker"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Squibs and Discussion: Individuation and Quantification. |journal=Linguistic Inquiry |date=Fall 1999 |first=Chris |last= Barker |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=683–691 |url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/002438999554264 |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-03-23 |doi=10.1162/002438999554264}}&lt;/ref&gt; when discussing one of [[Manfred Krifka]]'s study "Four thousand ships passed through the lock: Object-induced measure functions on events":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Four thousand ships passed through the lock: Object-induced measure functions on events |journal=Linguistics and Philosophy |year=1990 |first=Manfred |last=Krifka |volume=13 |pages=487–520 |url= http://semantics.uchicago.edu/kennedy/classes/s07/events/krifka90.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-03-23 |doi=10.1007/bf00627291}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"(1) Four thousand ships passed through the lock last year."&lt;ref name="Barker"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the surface, the proposition suggests that 4,000 distinct ships passed through the lock last year. However, as Krifka points out in his study, one could say that there were fewer than 4,000 distinct ships and that some of those ships passed through the lock more than once. Individuals reading this sentence could argue about the interpretation of this sentence. The outcome could be many interpretations when looking at the sentence more closely and determining what variables were taken into consideration when making this statement.&lt;ref name="Barker"/&gt;

In the [[The Iliad|''Iliad'']], the king of Argos, [[Agamemnon]], sacrifices his daughter [[Iphigenia]] to the Gods to assure good sailing weather to Troy. 
[[File:Singer Sargent, John - Orestes Pursued by the Furies - 1921.jpg|thumbnail|left|upright|by [[John Singer Sargent]]]]
In  ''Agamemnon'', the first play of [[Aeschylus]]'s [[Oresteia]] trilogy, Agamemnon is murdered by his wife, [[Clytemnestra]], and her lover, Aegisthus as revenge for sacrificing Iphigenia. In ''The Libation Bearers'', the second play of the Orestia, Agamemnon's son Orestes returns home to take revenge on his mother for murdering his father. 

Orestes ultimately does murder his mother, and afterward is tormented by [[Erinyes|The Furies]], beings who personify the anger of the dead.

==In Art==
Orestes being tormented by the Furies has been depicted by a number of artists.

'''Rural flight''' (or '''rural exodus''') is the [[Human migration|migratory pattern]] of peoples from [[rural sociology|rural areas]] into [[urban area]]s.  It is [[urbanization]] seen from the rural perspective.

In modern times, it often occurs in a region following the [[Factory farming|industrialization]] of [[agriculture]]—when fewer people are needed to bring the same amount of agricultural output to market—and related agricultural services and industries are consolidated.  Rural flight is exacerbated when the population decline leads to the loss of rural services (such as business enterprises and schools), which leads to greater loss of population as people leave to seek those features.

This phenomenon was first articulated through [[Christian McLean]]'s laws of migration in the 1880s, upon which modern theories &lt;!-- modern theories of what, migration? --&gt; are based.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Historical trends==
[[File:Dust Bowl - Dallas, South Dakota 1936.jpg|thumb|rt|250px|The effects of the [[Dust Bowl]] in [[Dallas, South Dakota]], May 1936]]
Prior to the [[Industrial Revolution]], rural flight occurred in mostly localized regions. Pre-industrial societies did not experience large rural-urban migration flows primarily due to the inability of cities to support large populations. Lack of large employment industries, high urban mortality, and low food supplies all served as checks keeping pre-industrial cities much smaller than their modern counterparts. [[Ancient Athens]] and Rome, scholars estimate, had peak populations of 80,000 and 500,000 paling in comparison with their current populations.&lt;ref name=Weeks&gt;{{cite book|last=Weeks|first=John|title=Population: an introduction to concepts and issues|year=2012|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, CA|pages=353–391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The onset of the Industrial Revolution in Europe in the late 19th century removed many of the checks that had previously constrained urban populations. As food supplies increased and stabilized and industrialized centers moved into place, cities began to support larger populations, sparking the beginning of rural flight on a massive scale.&lt;ref name=Weeks /&gt; The United Kingdom went from having 20% of the population living in urban areas in 1800 to more than 70% by 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis|first=Kingsley|title=The Urbanization of the Human Population|url=http://lgdata.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/docs/3245/871552/The_Urbanization_of_the_Human_Population--Kingsley_Davis.pdf|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the late 19th century and early 20th century saw much of rural flight focused in [[Western Europe]] and the United States, as [[industrialization]] spread throughout the world during the 20th century, rural flight and [[urbanization]] followed quickly behind. Today, rural flight is an especially distinctive phenomenon in some of the newer urbanized areas including [[China]] and more recently [[sub-Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref name=Weeks /&gt;&lt;ref name=ChinaDaily&gt;{{cite web|last=Juan|first=Shan|title=Rural exodus to cities continue|url=http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2012-08/08/content_15652220.htm|publisher=China Daily|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dust Bowl ===
The shift from mixed [[subsistence farming]] to commodity crops and livestock began in the late 19th century. New capital market systems and the railroad network began the trend towards larger farms that employed fewer people per acre. These larger farms used more efficient technologies such as steel plows, mechanical [[reaper]]s, and higher-yield seed stock, which reduced human input per unit of production.&lt;ref name="Cronon"&gt;{{cite book | last=Cronon| first=William| title=Nature's Metropolis: Chicago and the Great West| publisher=Norton| location=New York| year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other issue on the Great Plains was that people were using inappropriate farming techniques for the soil and weather conditions.  Most [[Homestead Acts|homestead]]ers had family farms generally considered too small to survive (under 320 acres), and European-American subsistence farming could not continue as it was then practiced.

During the [[Dust Bowl]] and the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, large numbers of people [[Depopulation of the Great Plains|fled rural areas of the Great Plains]] and the Midwest due to depressed commodity prices and high [[debt load]]s exacerbated by several years of drought and large [[dust storm]]s.&lt;ref name="Cooper"&gt;{{cite book | last=Cooper| first=Michael L.| title=Dust to eat: drought and depression in the 1930s| publisher=Clarion| location=New York| year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rural flight from the Great Plains has been depicted in literature, such as [[John Steinbeck]]'s novel ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'' (1939), in which a family from the [[Great Plains]] migrates to [[California]] during the Dust Bowl period of the 1930s.

===Modern rural flight===
Post-World War II rural flight has been caused primarily by the spread of [[industrialized agriculture]]. Small, labor-intensive [[family farms]] have grown into, or have been replaced by, heavily mechanized and specialized industrial farms. While a small family farm typically produced a wide range of crop, garden, and animal products—all requiring substantial labor—large industrial farms typically specialize in just a few crop or livestock varieties, using large machinery and high-density livestock containment systems that require a fraction of the labor per unit produced. For example, [[Iowa State University]] reports the number of [[hog farmer]]s in Iowa dropped from 65,000 in 1980 to 10,000 in 2002, while the number of hogs per farm increased from 200 to 1,400.&lt;ref name="ISU 1"&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.card.iastate.edu/iowa_ag_review/summer_03/article1.aspx| title=Living with Hogs in Rural Iowa| year=2003| work=Iowa Ag Review| publisher=[[Iowa State University]]| accessdate=25 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The consolidation of the feed, seed, [[processed grain]], and livestock industries has meant that there are fewer small businesses in rural areas. This decrease in turn exacerbated the decreased demand for labor. Rural areas that used to be able to provide employment for all young adults willing to work in challenging conditions, increasingly provide fewer opportunities for young adults. The situation is made worse by the decrease in services such as schools, business, and cultural opportunities that accompany the decline in population, and the increasing age of the remaining population further stresses the social service system of rural areas.

===Abandonment of small towns===
The rise of corporate agricultural structures directly affects small rural communities, resulting in decreased populations, decreased incomes for some segments, increased income inequality, decreased community participation, fewer retail outlets and less retail trade, and increased environmental pollution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.extension.iastate.edu/agdm/articles/duffy/DuffyOct97.htm "Changes in Iowa farm structure"]; University of Iowa Extension;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Determinants of rural flight ==
There are several determinants, push and pull, that contribute to rural flight: lower levels of (perceived) economic opportunity in rural communities versus urban ones, lower levels of government investment in rural communities, greater education opportunities in cities, marriages, increased social acceptance in urban areas, and higher levels of rural fertility.

=== Economic determinants ===
Some migrants choose to leave rural communities out of the desire to pursue greater economic opportunity in urban areas. Greater economic opportunities can be real or perceived. According to the [[Harris-Todaro Model]], migration to urban areas will continue as long as "expected urban real income at the margin exceeds real agricultural product" (127).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harris|first=John|title=Migration, Unemployment and Development: A Two-Sector Analysis|url=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic1222150.files/Session%2018/harris_todaro70.pdf|publisher=American Economic Association|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, sociologist Josef Gugler points out that while individual benefits of increased wages may outweigh the costs of migration, if enough individuals follow this rationale, it can produce harmful effects such as overcrowding and unemployment on a national level.&lt;ref name=Gugler&gt;Gugler, Josef. "Overurbanization Reconsidered." ''Economic Development and Cultural Change'' 31, no. 1 (1 October 1982): 173–89.&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon, when the rate of urbanization outpaces the rate of economic growth, is known as [[overurbanization]].&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;Davis, Kingsley, and Hilda Hertz Golden. "Urbanization and the Development of Pre-Industrial Areas." Economic Development and Cultural Change 3, no. 1 (October 1954): 6–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the industrialization of agriculture, mechanization has reduced the number of jobs present in rural communities. Some scholars have also attributed rural flight to the effects of globalization as the demand for increased economic competitiveness leads people to choose capital over labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perz|first=Stephen|title=The Rural Exodus in the Context of Economic Crisis, Globalization, and Reform in Brazil|journal=The International Migration Review|volume=34|issue=3|pages=842–881|jstor=2675947|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, rural fertility rates have historically been higher than urban fertility rates.&lt;ref name=Weeks /&gt; The combination of declining rural jobs and a persistently high rural fertility rate has led to rural-urban migration streams. Rural flight also contains a positive feedback loop where previous migrants from rural communities assist new migrants in adjusting to city life. Also known as [[chain migration]], migrant networks lower barriers to rural flight. For example, an overwhelming majority of rural migrants in China located jobs in urban areas through migrant networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China Human Development Report 2005: Development with Equity|publisher=UNDP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some families choose to send their children to cities as a form of investment for the future. A study conducted by Bates and Bennett (1974) concluded that rural communities in Zambia that had other viable investment opportunities, like livestock for instance, had lower rates of rural-urban migration as compared to regions without viable investment opportunities. Sending their children into cities can serve as long-term investments with the hope that their children will be able to send remittances back home after getting a job in the city.&lt;ref name=Zambia&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bates|first=Robert|title=Determinants of the Rural Exodus in Zambia|journal=Cahiers d'Études Africaines|volume=14|issue=55|pages=543–564|jstor=4391333|year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are severe challenges faced by poorer people in the agriculture sector because of diminishing access to productive farmland. Foreign investors through [[Foreign direct investment|Foreign Direct Investment]] (FDI) schemes have been encouraged to lease land in rural areas in [[Cambodia]] and [[Ethiopia]]. This has led to the loss of farmland, range land, woodlands and water sources from local communities. Large-scale agricultural projects funded by FDI only employed a few experts specialized in the relevant new technologies.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002457/245765e.pdf|title=Learning knowledge and skills for agriculture to improve rural livelihoods|last=Robinson-Pant|first=Anna|publisher=UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100169-7|location=|pages=90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social determinants===
In other instances, rural flight may occur in response to social determinants. A study conducted in 2012 indicated that a significant proportion of rural flight in India occurred due to social factors such as migration with household, marriage, and education. Migration with households and marriage affect women in particular as most often they are the ones required to move with households and move for marriage, especially in developing regions.&lt;ref name=India&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hassan|first=Tarique|author2=Khan, Jabir |title=Determinants of Rural Out-Migration in India|journal=International Journal of Advanced Research in Management and Social Sciences|date=December 2012|volume=1|issue=12|url=https://www.academia.edu/5450848|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
	
Rural youth may choose to leave their rural communities as a method of transitioning into adulthood, seeking avenues to greater prosperity. With the stagnation of the rural economy and encouragement from their parents, rural youth may choose to migrate to cities out of social norms – demonstrating leadership and self-respect.&lt;ref name=Youth&gt;{{cite web|last=Min-Harris|first=C.|title=Youth migration and poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa: Empowering the Rural Youth|url=http://www.du.edu/korbel/hrhw/researchdigest/africa/YouthMigration.pdf|publisher=Disponible en ligne dans le site|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this societal encouragement combined with depressed rural economies, rural youth form a large proportion of the migrants moving to urban areas. In Sub-Saharan Africa, a study conducted by Touray in 2006 indicated that about 15% (26 million) of urban migrants were youth. 
	
Lastly, natural disasters can often be single-point events that lead to temporarily massive rural-urban migration flows. The 1930s Dust Bowl in the United States, for example, led to the flight of 2.5 million people from the Plains by 1940, many to the new cities in the West. It is estimated that as many as one out of every four residents in the Plains States left during the 1930s.&lt;ref name=DustBowlPBS&gt;{{cite web|title=Mass Exodus from the Plains|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/dustbowl-mass-exodus-plains/|publisher=PBS|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, drought in Syria from 2006-2011 has prompted a rural exodus to major urban centers. Massive influxes in urban areas, combined with difficult living conditions, have prompted some scholars to link the drought to the arrival of the Arab Spring in Syria.&lt;ref name=Syria&gt;{{cite news|last=Aukalh|first=R.|title=A rural exodus as drought takes hold of Syria|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2013/03/16/a_rural_exodus_as_drought_takes_hold_of_syria.html|accessdate=13 March 2014|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the United States and Canada==
{{see also|Depopulation of the Great Plains}}
The terms are used in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] to describe the flight of people from rural areas in the [[Great Plains]] and [[Midwest]] regions, and to a lesser extent rural areas of the northeast and southeast and Appalachia. It is also particularly noticeable in parts of [[Atlantic Canada]] (especially [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]), since the [[collapse of the Atlantic northwest cod fishery|collapse of Atlantic cod fishing fields]] in 1992.

==China==
{{Main article|Migration in China}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Chinese migrant workers in a construction site.jpg|thumb|right|Migrant workers are working in a construction site.]] --&gt;
[[China]], like many other currently industrializing countries, has had a relatively late start to rural flight. Until 1983, the Chinese government, through the [[hukou system]], greatly restricted the ability of their citizens to internally migrate. Since 1983, the Chinese government has progressively lifted the restrictions on internal migration. This has led to a great increase in the number of people migrating to urban areas.&lt;ref name=Hukou&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liang|first=Zai|author2=Zhongdong Ma |title=China's floating population: new evidence from the 2000 census|journal=Population and Development Review|year=2004|volume=30|issue=3|pages=467–488|doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2004.00024.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even today, the hukou system limits the ability of rural migrants to receive full access to urban social services at the urban subsidized costs.&lt;ref name=Economist /&gt;

As with most examples of rural flight, several factors have led towards China’s massive urbanization. Income disparity, family pressure, surplus labor in rural areas due to higher average fertility rates, and improved living conditions all play a role in contributing to the flows of migrants from rural to urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Labour Migration|url=http://www.ilo.org/beijing/areas-of-work/labour-migration/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=International labour organization|accessdate=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately, 250 million rural migrants now live in cities with 54% of the total Chinese population living in urban areas.&lt;ref name=Economist&gt;{{Cite journal|title=China's cities: The Great Transition|journal=The Economist|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21599360-government-right-reform-hukou-system-it-needs-be-braver-great|accessdate=18 April 2014|date=2014-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==
===Middle ages===
Rural flight has been occurring to some degree in Germany since the 11th century. A corresponding principle of German law is ''[[Stadtluft macht frei]]'' ("city air makes you free"), in longer form ''Stadtluft macht frei nach Jahr und Tag'' ("city air makes you free after a year and a day"): by custom and, from 1231/32, by statute, a [[serf]] who had spent a year and a day in a city was free, and could not be reclaimed by their former master.

===German ''Landflucht''===
{{Main article|Landflucht}}
''[[Landflucht]]'' ("flight from the land") refers to the mass [[Human migration|migration]] of peasants into the cities that occurred in [[Germany]] (and throughout most of Europe) in the late 19th century.

In 1870 the rural population of Germany constituted 64% of the population; by 1907 it had shrunk to 33%.&lt;ref name= "Schapiro, Shotwell p. 300"&gt;SchapiroShotwell; 1922, p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900 alone, the Prussian provinces of [[East Prussia]], [[West Prussia]], [[Province of Posen|Posen]], [[Silesia]], and [[Pomerania]] lost about 1,600,000 people to the cities,&lt;ref name= "Kirk p. 139"&gt;Kirk1969, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; where these former agricultural workers were absorbed into the rapidly growing factory labor class;&lt;ref name= "Mises p. 8"&gt;Mises2006, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the causes of this mass-migration was the decrease in rural income compared to the rates of pay in the cities.&lt;ref name= "Shafir p. 150"&gt;Shafir 1996, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

Landflucht resulted in a major transformation of the German countryside and agriculture. [[Mechanized agriculture]] and migrant workers, particularly Poles from the east (Sachsengänger), became more common. This was especially true in the [[province of Posen]] that was [[Prussian partition|gained by Prussia]] when [[partitions of Poland|Poland was partitioned]].&lt;ref name= "Shafir p. 150"/&gt; The Polish population of eastern Germany was one of the justifications for the creation of the "[[Polish corridor]]" after World War I and the absorption of the land east of the [[Oder-Neisse line]] into Poland after World War II. Also, some labor-intensive enterprises were replaced by much less labor-intensive ones such as [[game preserve]]s.&lt;ref name= "Drage p. 77"&gt;Drage 1909, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''Landflucht'' has negative connotations in German, as it was coined by agricultural employers, often of the German aristocracy, who were lamenting their labor shortages.&lt;ref name= "Mises p. 8"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "McLean, Kromkowski p. 56"&gt;McLean, Kromkowski 1991, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sweden==
Rural flight and out-migration in Sweden can be traced in two distinct waves. The first, beginning in the 1850s when 82% of the Swedish population lived in rural areas, and continuing till the late 1880s, was mostly due to push factors in the countryside related to poverty, unemployment, low agricultural wages, debt peonage, semi-feudalism, and religious oppression by the State church. Most of the migration was ad-hoc and directed towards emigration to the three big cities of Sweden, America, Denmark, or Germany. Many of these first emigrants were unskilled, barely literate laborers who sought farm work or daily wage labour in the cities.

The second wave started from the late 1890s and reached its peak between 1922 and 1967, with the highest rates of rural flight occurring in the 1920s and the 1950s. This was mostly "pull factors" due to the economic boom and industrial prosperity in Sweden wherein the massive economic expansion and wage increases in the urban areas pulled young people to migrate for work and at the same time drove down work opportunities in the countryside. Between 1925 and 1965, Sweden's GDP per capita increased from USD 850 to USD 6200. Simultaneously, the percentage of the population living in rural areas decreased drastically from 54% in 1925 to 21% in 1965.

== Russia and the former Soviet states ==
Rural flight began later for [[Russia]] and the former states of the [[USSR]] than in [[Western Europe]]. In 1926 only 18% of Russians lived in urban areas, compared to over 75% at the same time in the United Kingdom. Although the process began later, throughout World War II and the decades immediately proceeding, rural flight proceeded at a rapid pace. By 1965, 53% of Russians lived in urban areas.&lt;ref name=Wadekin&gt;{{cite journal|last= Wadekin|first= Karl-Eugen|title= Internal Migration and the Flight from the Land in USSR|journal= Soviet Studies|date= October 1966|volume= 18|issue= 2|pages= 131–152|jstor= 149517|doi= 10.1080/09668136608410523}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics compiled by M. Ya Sonin, a Soviet author, in 1959, demonstrate the rapid [[urbanization]] of the [[USSR]]. Between 1939 and 1959, the rural population declined by 21.3 million, while that of urban centers increased by 39.4 million. Of this dramatic shift in population, rural flight accounts for more than 60% of the change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Sonin|first= M. Ya.|title= Vosproizvodstvo rabochei sily v SSSR i balans truda|date= March 1959|page= 144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, most rural migrants tended to settle in cities and towns within their district.&lt;ref name=Wadekin /&gt;  Rural flight persisted through the majority of the 20th century. However, with the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|end of the Soviet Union]], rural flight reversed as political and economic instability in the cities prompted many urban dwellers to return to rural villages.&lt;ref name=Wegren&gt;{{cite journal|last= Wegren|first= Stephen K.|title= Rural Migration and Agrarian Reform in Russia: A Research Note|journal= Europe-Asia Studies|date= July 1995|volume= 47|issue= 5|pages= 877–888|jstor= 152691|doi= 10.1080/09668139508412292|pmid= 12320195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rural flight did not occur uniformly throughout the USSR. Western Russia and [[Ukraine]] experienced the greatest declines in rural population, 30% and 17% respectively. Conversely, peripheral regions of the USSR, like [[Central Asia]], experienced gains, contradicting the general pattern of rural-urban migration of this period. Increased diversification of crops and labor shortages were primary contributors to the gains in rural population in the periphery.&lt;ref name=Wadekin /&gt;

Rural flight in Russia and the former USSR had several major determinants. The industrialization of agriculture, which came later in Russia and the former USSR, led to declines in available rural jobs. Lower living standards and tough work also motivated some peasants to migrate to urban areas.&lt;ref name=Wadekin /&gt; In particular, the Soviet ''[[kolkhoz]]'' system (the collective farms in the Soviet Union) aided in maintaining low living standards for Soviet peasants. Beginning around 1928, the [[kolkhoz]] system replaced [[family farm]]s throughout the Soviet Union. Forced to work long hours for low pay at rates fixed by the government and often unadjusted to [[inflation]], Russian peasants experienced quite low living-conditions - especially compared to urban life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Editors of the Encyclopædia Britannica|title= kolkhoz|url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/321400/kolkhoz|publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate= 29 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   While [[Brezhnev]]'s wage reforms in 1965 ameliorated the low wages received by peasants, rural life remained suffocating, especially for the skilled and the educated.&lt;ref name=Wegren /&gt; 
[[File:Menkovo - abandoned post office - DSCF5841.JPG|thumb|An abandoned post office in [[Menkovo]], [[Yaroslavl Oblast]], Russia]]

Although migrants came from all segments of society, several groups were more likely to migrate than others. Like other examples of rural flight, the young were more likely than the old to migrate to the cities. Young women under 20 were the most likely segment of the population to leave rural life. This exodus of young women further exacerbated the demographic transitions occurring in rural communities as the rate of natural increase dropped precipitously over the course of the 20th century. Lastly, the skilled and educated were also likely to migrate to urban areas.&lt;ref name=Wadekin /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wegren /&gt;

== Mexico ==
Rural flight in Mexico occurred throughout the 1930s up until the present day. Like other developing nations, the beginning of industrialization in Mexico quickly accelerated the rate of rural flight.&lt;ref name=Arizpe&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arizpe|first=Lourdes|title=The Rural Exodus in Mexico and Mexican Migration to the United States|journal=International Migration Review|date=Winter 1981|volume=15|issue=4|pages=626–649|jstor=2545516|doi=10.2307/2545516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, President [[Lázaro Cárdenas|Cardenas]] implemented a series of agricultural reforms that led to massive redistribution of agricultural land among the rural peasants. Some commentators have subsequently dubbed the period from 1940-1965 as the "Golden Era for Mexican Migration."&lt;ref name=Arizpe /&gt;  During this period, Mexican agriculture grew at an average rate of 5.7% outpacing the natural increase of 3% of the rural population. Concurrently, government policies favoring industrialization led to a massive increase of industrial jobs in the cities. Statistics compiled in [[Mexico City]] demonstrate this trend with over 1.8 million jobs created over the course of the 1940s, 50s, and 60s.&lt;ref name=Arizpe /&gt; Young people with schooling were the segment of population most likely to migrate away from rural life to urban life, attracted by the promise of many jobs and a more modern lifestyle as compared to the conservative conditions in rural villages. Additionally, due to the large demand for new workers, many of these jobs had low entrance requirements that also provided on-site job training opening the avenue for [[human migration|migration]] to many rural residents. From 1940 to about 1965, rural flight occurred in a slow, yet steady pace with both agriculture and industry growing concurrently.&lt;ref name=Arizpe /&gt;

However, as government policies increasingly favored industry over agriculture, rural conditions began to deteriorate. In 1957, the Mexican government began to regulate the price of maize through massive imports in order to keep low urban food costs.&lt;ref name=Arizpe /&gt;  This regulation severely undercut the market price of [[maize]] lowering the profit margins of small farmers. At the same time, the [[Green Revolution]] had entered into Mexican agriculture. Inspired by the work of [[Norman Borlaug]], farmers that employed hybrid seeds and fertilizer supplements were able to double or even triple their yields per acre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thurow|first=Roger|title=Enough: Why the World's Poorest Starve in an Age of Plenty|year=2009|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York, NY|author2=Kilman, Scott }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unfortunately, these products came at a relatively high cost, out of the reach of many farmers struggling after the devaluation of the price of maize. The combined effects of the maize price regulation and the Green Revolution was the consolidation of small farms into larger estates.&lt;ref name=Shaw&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaw|first=R. Paul|title=Land Tenure and the Rural Exodus in Latin America|journal=Economic Development and Cultural Change|date=October 1974|volume=23|issue=1|pages=123–132|jstor=1153146|doi=10.1086/450773}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1974 study conducted by Osorio concluded that in 1960, about 50.3% of the individual land plots in Mexico contained less than 5 hectares of land. In contrast, the top 0.5% of estates by land spanned 28.3% of all arable land. As many small farmers lost land, they either migrated to the cities or became migrant workers roving from large estate to large estate. Between 1950 and 1970, the proportion of migrant workers increased from 36.7% to 54% of the total population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Osorio|first=S.R|title=Estructura Agrariay Desarrollo Agricola en Mexico|journal=Mexico: Fondo de Cultura Economica|year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; The centralized pattern of industrial development and government policies overwhelmingly favoring industrialization contributed to massive rural flight in Mexico beginning in the late 1960s until the present day.&lt;ref name=Arizpe /&gt;

==Consequences of rural flight==
Rural migrants to cities face several challenges that may hinder their quality of life upon moving into urbanized areas. Many migrants do not have the education or skills to acquire decent jobs in cities and are then forced into unstable, low paying jobs. The steady stream of new rural migrants worsens underemployment and unemployment, common among rural migrants. Employers offer lower wages and poorer labor conditions to rural migrants, who must compete with each other for limited jobs, often unaware of their labor rights. Rural migrants often experience poor living conditions as well. Many cities have exploded in population; services and infrastructure, in these cities, are unable to keep up with population growth. Massive influxes in rural population can lead to severe housing shortages, inadequate water and energy supply, and general slum-like conditions throughout cities.&lt;ref name=Weeks /&gt;&lt;ref name=Youth /&gt;

Additionally, rural migrants often struggle adjusting to city life. In some instances, there are cultural differences between the rural and urban areas of a region. Lost in urban regions, it becomes difficult for them to continue holding onto their cultural traditions. Urban residents may also look down upon these newcomers to the city who are often unaware of city social norms. Both marginalized and separated from their home cultures, migrants face many social challenges when moving to cities.&lt;ref name=Youth /&gt;

Women, in particular, face a unique set of challenges. Some women undergo rural flight to escape domestic abuse or forced early marriages. Some parents choose to send women to cities to find jobs in order to send remittances back home. Once in the city, employers may attempt to take advantage of these women preying on their unfamiliarity with labor laws and social networks on which to rely. In the worst of cases, destitution may force women into prostitution, exposing them to social stigma and the risks of sexually transmitted diseases.&lt;ref name=Youth /&gt;

==Rationale==

There is a need for a [[computer program]] that is easier to operate and that requires a simpler [[data structure]] then most currently available models. Therefore, the SahysMod program was designed keeping in mind a relative simplicity of operation to facilitate the use by field technicians, engineers and project planners instead of specialized [[geohydrology|geo-hydrologists]].&lt;br&gt;
It aims at using input data that are generally available, or that can be estimated with reasonable accuracy, or that can be measured with relative ease. Although the calculations are done numerically and have to be repeated many times, the final results can be ''checked by hand'' using the formulas in this manual.

SahysMod's [[goal|objective]] is to predict the [[long-term]] hydro-[[salinity]] in terms of general [[Trend estimation|trend]]s, not to arrive at exact predictions of how, for example, the situation would be on the first of April in ten years from now.&lt;br&gt;
Further, SahysMod gives the option of the re-use of drainage and [[Water well|well]] water (e.g. for [[irrigation]]) and it can account for [[farmer]]s' responses to [[Waterlogging (agriculture)|waterlogging]], [[soil salinity]], water scarcity and over-pumping from the [[aquifer]]. Also it offers the possibility to introduce [[subsurface drainage]] systems at varying depths and with varying capacities so that they can be [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimized]].
Other features of SahysMod are found in the next section.

== Methods ==

=== Calculation of aquifer conditions in polygons ===
[[File:Aquifer en.svg|thumb|250px|Example of an aquifer]]

The model calculates the ground water levels and the incoming and outgoing ground water flows between the [[polygon]]s by a numerical solution of the well-known [[Boussinesq approximation (water waves)|Boussinesq equation]]. The levels and flows influence each other mutually.
The ground water situation is further determined by the vertical [[groundwater recharge]] that is calculated from the agronomic [[Hydrology (agriculture)|water balance]]. These depend again on the levels of the [[ground water]].

When semi-confined [[aquifer]]s are present, the resistance to vertical flow in the slowly permeable top-layer and the overpressure in the aquifer, if any, are taken into account.

Hydraulic [[boundary conditions]] are given as [[hydraulic head]]s in the external nodes in combination with the [[hydraulic conductivity]] between internal and external nodes. If one wishes to impose a zero [[flow conditioning|flow condition]] at the external nodes, the conductivity can be set at zero.

Further, [[aquifer]] flow conditions can be given for the internal nodes. These are required when a [[Fault (geology)|geological fault]] is present at the bottom of the aquifer or when flow occurs between the main aquifer and a deeper aquifer separated by a semi-confining layer.

The depth of the [[water table]], the [[rainfall]] and salt concentrations of the deeper layers are assumed to be the same over the whole polygon. Other parameters can very within the polygons according to type of crops and cropping rotation schedule.

=== Seasonal approach ===

The model is based on seasonal input data and returns seasonal outputs. The number of seasons per year can be chosen between a minimum of one and a maximum of four. One can distinguish for example dry, wet, cold, hot, irrigation or [[fallow]] seasons. Reasons of not using smaller input/output periods are:
#short-term (e.g., daily) inputs would require much information, which, in large areas, may not be readily available;
#short-term outputs would lead to immense output files, which would be difficult to manage and interpret;
#this model is especially developed to predict long-term trends, and predictions for the future are more reliably made on a seasonal (long-term) than on a daily (short-term) basis, due to the high variability of short-term data;
#though the precision of the predictions for the future may be limited, a lot is gained when the trend is sufficiently clear. For example, it need not be a major constraint to the design of appropriate [[soil salinity control]] measures when a certain salinity level, predicted by SahysMod to occur after 20 years, will in reality occur after 15 or 25 years.

=== Computational time steps ===

Many [[water balance]] factors depend on the level of the [[water table]], which again depends on some of the water-balance factors. Due to these mutual influences there can be non-linear changes throughout the season. Therefore, the [[computer program]] performs daily calculations. For this purpose, the seasonal water-balance factors given with the inpu] are reduced automatically to daily values. The calculated seasonal water-balance factors, as given in the output, are obtained by summations of the daily calculated values. [[Groundwater]] levels and [[soil salinity]] (the [[state variable]]s) at the end of the season are found by accumulating the daily changes of water and salt storage.

In some cases the program may detect that the time step must be taken less than 1 day for better accuracy. The necessary adjustments are made automatically.

==Data requirements==

=== Polygonal network ===
[[Image:Garmsar.gif|thumb|250px|A polygonal network]]
The model permits a maximum of 240 internal and 120 external [[polygon]]s with a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 6 sides each. The subdivision of the area into polygons, based on nodal points with known [[coordinates]], should be governed by the characteristics of the distribution of the [[crop]]ping, [[irrigation]], [[drainage]] and [[groundwater]] characteristics over the study area.

The nodes must be numbered, which can be done at will. With an index one indicates whether the node is internal or external. Nodes can be added and removed at will or changed from internal to external or vice versa. Through another index one indicates whether the internal nodes have an unconfined or semi-confined aquifer. This can also be changed at will.

Nodal network relations are to be given indicating the neighboring polygon numbers of each node. The program then calculates the surface area of each polygon, the distance between the nodes and the length of the sides between them using the Thiessen principle.

The [[hydraulic conductivity]] can vary for each side of the polygons.

The depth of the [[water table]], the [[rainfall]] and [[salt]] concentrations of the deeper layers are assumed to be the same over the whole polygon. Other [[parameters]] can very within the polygons according to type of crops and cropping rotation schedule.

=== Hydrological data ===
[[Image:File-Saltmod8 (2).JPG|thumb|SahysMod components]]
The method uses seasonal water balance components as input data. These are related to the surface [[hydrology]] (like rainfall, [[potential evaporation]], [[irrigation]], use of drain and well water for irrigation, [[Surface runoff|runoff]]), and the aquifer hydrology (e.g., pumping from [[Water well|wells]]). The other [[water balance]] components (like actual evaporation, downward [[percolation]], upward [[capillary rise]], [[subsurface drainage]], [[groundwater flow]]) are given as output.

The quantity of drainage water, as output, is determined by two drainage intensity factors for drainage above and below drain level respectively (to be given with the input data) and the height of the water table above the given drain level. This height results from the computed water balance Further, a drainage reduction factor can be applied to simulate a limited operation of the drainage system. Variation of the drainage intensity factors and the drainage reduction factor gives the opportunity to simulate the effect of different drainage options.

To obtain accuracy in the computations of the ground water flow (sect. 2.8), the actual evaporation and the capillary rise, the computer calculations are done on a daily basis. For this purpose, the seasonal hydrological data are divided by the number of days per season to obtain daily values. The daily values are added to yield seasonal values.

=== Cropping patterns/rotations ===

The input data on irrigation, evaporation, and surface runoff are to be specified per season for three kinds of agricultural practices, which can be chosen at the discretion of the user:

:A: irrigated land with crops of group A
:B: irrigated land with crops of group B
:U: non-irrigated land with rain-fed crops or fallow land
[[File:Plain of punjab.jpg|thumb|250px|Irrigated land]]

The groups, expressed in fractions of the total area, may consist of combinations of [[crop]]s or just of a single kind of crop. For example, as the A-type crops one may specify the lightly irrigated cultures, and as the B type the more heavily irrigated ones, such as [[sugarcane]] and [[rice]]. But one can also take A as rice and B as sugar cane, or perhaps [[tree]]s and [[orchard]]s. A, B and/or U crops can be taken differently in different seasons, e.g. A=[[wheat]] plus [[barley]] in winter and A=[[maize]] in summer while B=[[vegetable]]s in winter and B=[[cotton]] in summer. Non-irrigated land can be specified in two ways: (1) as U = 1&amp;minus;A&amp;minus;B and (2) as A and/or B with zero irrigation. A combination can also be made.

Further, a specification must be given of the seasonal [[crop rotation|rotation]] of the different [[land use]]s over the total area, e.g. full rotation, no rotation at all, or incomplete rotation.  This occurs with a rotation index. The rotations are taken over the seasons within the year. To obtain rotations over the years it is advisable to introduce annual input changes as explained

When a fraction A1, B1 and/or U1 differs from the fraction A2, B2 and/or U2 in another season, because the irrigation regime changes in the different seasons, the program will detect that a certain rotation occurs. If one wishes to avoid this, one may specify the same fractions in all seasons (A2=A1, B2=B1, U2=U1) but the crops and irrigation quantities may be different and may need to be proportionally adjusted. One may even specify irrigated land (A or B) with zero irrigation, which is the same as un-irrigated land (U).

[[crop rotation|Cropping rotation]] schedules vary widely in different parts of the world. Creative combinations of area fractions, rotation indexes, irrigation quantities and annual input changes can accommodate many types of agricultural practices.

Variation of the area fractions and/or the rotational schedule gives the opportunity to [[simulate]] the effect of different agricultural practices on the water and salt balance.

=== Soil strata, type of aquifer ===

SahysMod accepts four different reservoirs of which three are in the soil profile:

:s: a surface reservoir,
:r: an upper (shallow) soil reservoir or root zone,
:x: an intermediate soil reservoir or transition zone,
:q: a deep reservoir or main [[aquifer]].

The upper soil reservoir is defined by the soil depth, from which water can evaporate or be taken up by plant roots. It can be taken equal to the root zone. It can be saturated, unsaturated, or partly saturated, depending on the water balance. All water movements in this zone are vertical, either upward or downward, depending on the water balance. (In a future version of Sahysmod, the upper soil reservoir may be divided into two equal parts to detect the trend in the vertical salinity distribution.)

The transition zone can also be saturated, unsaturated or partly saturated. All flows in this zone are horizontal, except the flow to subsurface drains, which is radial.
If a horizontal subsurface drainage system is present, this must be placed in the transition zone, which is then divided into two parts: an upper transition zone (above drain level) and a lower transition zone (below drain level).

If one wishes to distinguish an upper and lower part of the transition zone in the absence of a subsurface drainage system, one may specify in the input data a drainage system with zero intensity.

The aquifer has mainly horizontal flow. Pumped [[Water well|wells]], if present, receive their water from the aquifer only. The flow in the aquifer is determined in dependence of spatially varying depths of the aquifer, levels of the water table, and [[hydraulic conductivity]].

SahysMod permits the introduction of ''phreatic'' ([[unconfined aquifer|unconfined]]) and ''semi-confined'' aquifers. The latter may develop a hydraulic over or under pressure below the slowly permeable top-layer ([[aquitard]]).

=== Agricultural water balances ===
[[File:WatBalan.JPG|thumb|250px|Inflow and outflow factors of water into and out from the soil reservoirs needed to find the waterbalances]]
The agricultural [[water balance]]s are calculated for each soil reservoir separately as shown in the article [[Hydrology (agriculture)]]. The excess water leaving one reservoir is converted into incoming water for the next reservoir. The three soil reservoirs can be assigned different thickness and storage coefficients, to be given as input data. When, in a particular situation the transition zone or the aquifer is not present, they must be given a minimum thickness of 0.1 m.

The depth of the [[water table]] at the end of the previous time step, calculated from the [[water balance]]s, is assumed to be the same within each [[polygon]]. If this assumption is not acceptable, the area must be divided into a larger number of polygons.

Under certain conditions, the height of the water table influences the water-balance components. For example, a rise of the water table towards the soil surface may lead to an increase of capillary rise, actual evaporation, and subsurface drainage, or a decrease of percolation losses. This, in turn, leads to a change of the water-balance, which again influences the height of the water table, etc. This chain of reactions is one of the reasons why Sahysmod has been developed into a [[computer program]], in which the computations are made day by day to account for the chain of reactions with a sufficient degree of [[accuracy]].

=== Drains, wells, and re-use ===
[[File:DrainSection2.png|thumb|250px|Parameters of a horizontal subsurfce drainage system]]
The sub-surface [[Drainage system (agriculture)|drainage]] can be accomplished through drains or pumped wells.

The subsurface drains, if any, are characterized by drain depth and ''drainage capacity''. The drains are located in the transition zone. The subsurface drainage facility can be applied to natural or artificial drainage systems. The functioning of an artificial drainage system can be regulated through a drainage control factor.

By installing a drainage system with zero capacity one obtains the opportunity to have separate water and salt balances in the transition above and below drain level.

The pumped [[Water well|wells]], if any, are located in the aquifer. Their functioning is characterized by the well [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]].

The drain and well water can be used for [[irrigation]] through a ''(re)use factor''. This may affect the water and salt balance and on the irrigation efficiency or sufficiency.

=== Salt balances ===
[[File:Mpbas.gif|thumb|250px|Graphic example of soil salinity trends in the transition zone]]

The [[Soil salinity control|salt balances]] are calculated for each soil reservoir separately. They are based on their [[Hydrology (agriculture)|water balances]], using the salt concentrations of the incoming and outgoing water. Some concentrations must be given as input data, like the initial salt concentrations of the water in the different soil reservoirs, of the irrigation water and of the incoming groundwater in the aquifer. The concentrations are expressed in terms of [[electric conductivity]] (EC in dS/m). When the concentrations are known in terms of g salt/l water, the rule of thumb: 1 g/l -&gt; 1.7 dS/m can be used. Usually, salt concentrations of the soil are expressed in ECe, the electric conductivity of an extract of a saturated soil paste. In Sahysmod, the salt concentration is expressed as the EC of the soil moisture when saturated under field conditions. As a rule, one can use the conversion rate EC : ECe = 2 : 1. The principles used are correspond to those described in the article [[soil salinity control]].

Salt concentrations of outgoing water (either from one reservoir into the other or by subsurface drainage) are computed on the basis of salt balances, using different leaching or salt mixing efficiencies to be given with the input data. The effects of different [[Leaching model (soil)#Leaching efficiency|leaching efficiencies]] can be simulated varying their input value.

If drain or well water is used for irrigation, the method computes the salt concentration of the mixed irrigation water in the course of the time and the subsequent effect on the soil and ground water salinity, which again influences the salt concentration of the drain and well water. By varying the fraction of used drain or well water (through the input), the long-term effect of different fractions can be simulated.

The [[solvation|dissolution]] of solid soil minerals or the [[precipitation (chemistry)|chemical precipitation]] of poorly soluble salts is not included in the computation method. However, but to some extent, it can be accounted for through the input data, e.g. increasing or decreasing the salt concentration of the irrigation water or of the incoming water in the [[aquifer]]. In a future version, the precipitation of gypsum may be introduced.

=== Farmers' responses ===

If required, farmers' responses to [[waterlogging (agriculture)|waterlogging]] and [[soil salinity]] can be automatically accounted for. The method can gradually decrease:

# The amount of [[irrigation]] water applied when the water table becomes shallower depending on the kind of crop (paddy rice and non-rice)
# The fraction of irrigated land when the available [[irrigation]] water is scarce;
# The fraction of irrigated land when the [[soil salinity]] increases; for this purpose, the salinity is given a [[stochastic]] interpretation;
# The [[groundwater]] abstraction by pumping from [[Water well|wells]] when the water table drops.

The farmers' responses influence the water and salt balances, which, in turn, slows down the process of water logging and salinization. Ultimately a new equilibrium situation will arise.

The user can also introduce farmers' responses by manually changing the relevant input data. Perhaps it will be useful first to study the automatic farmers' responses and their effect first and thereafter decide what the farmers' responses will be in the view of the user.

=== Annual input changes ===

The program runs either with fixed input data for the number of years determined by the user. This option can be used to predict future developments based on long-term average input values, e.g. rainfall, as it will be difficult to assess the future values of the input data year by year.

The program also offers the possibility to follow historic records with annually changing input values (e.g. rainfall, irrigation, cropping rotations), the calculations must be made year by year. If this possibility is chosen, the program creates a transfer file by which the final conditions of the previous year (e.g. water table and salinity) are automatically used as the initial conditions for the subsequent period. This facility makes it also possible to use various generated rainfall sequences drawn randomly from a known rainfall probability distribution and to obtain a stochastic prediction of the resulting output parameters.

Some input parameters should not be changed, like the nodal network relations, the system [[geometry]], the thickness of the soil layers, and the total [[porosity]], otherwise illogical jumps occur in the water and salt balances. These parameters are also stored in the transfer file, so that any impermissible change is overruled by the transfer data. In some cases of incorrect changes, the program will stop and request the user to adjust the input.

==Output data==
[[Image:GOHANAFREQ.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Cumulative frequency distribution of soil salinity]]
[[Image:GarmsarDWT.png|thumb|right|250px|Example of the polygonal mapping facilities using the depth of the watertable]]
The output is given for each season of any year during any number of years, as specified with the input data. The output data comprise hydrological and salinity aspects.&lt;br&gt;
As the soil salinity is very variable from place to place (figure left) SahysMod includes [[Cumulative frequency analysis|frequency distributions]] in the output. The figure was made with the CumFreq program [http://www.waterlog.info/cumfreq.htm] .&lt;br&gt; 
The output data are filed in the form of tables that can be inspected directly, through the user menu, that calls selected groups of data either for a certain [[polygon]] over time, or for a certain season over the polygons. &lt;br /&gt;
The model includes mapping facilties of output data. Also, the program has the facility to store the selected data in a [[spreadsheet]] format for further analysis and for import into a [[GIS]] program. &lt;br /&gt;
Different users may wish to establish different cause-effect relationships. The program offers only a limited number of standard [[graphics]], as it is not possible to foresee all different uses that may be made. This is the reason why the possibility for further analysis through spreadsheet programs was created.&lt;br&gt;
Although the [[computations]] need many [[iterations]], all the end results can be ''checked by hand'' using the equations presented in the manual.

'''Steel design''', or more specifically, '''structural steel design''', is an area of knowledge of structural engineering used to design [[steel structures]]. The structures can range from schools to homes to bridges.

In [[structural engineering]], a structure is a body or combination of pieces of rigid bodies in space to form a fitness system for supporting loads. Structures such as [[building]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[aircraft]] and [[ship]]s are all examples under steel structure. The effects of loads on structures are determined through [[structural analysis]]. Steel structure is [[steel]] construction material, a profile, formed with a specific shape or cross section and certain standards of chemical composition and mechanical properties.

There are currently two common methods of steel design:  The first method is the [[Allowable Strength Design]] (ASD) method.  The second is the [[limit state design|Load and Resistance Factor Design]] (LRFD) method. Both use a strength, or ultimate level design approach. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Steel Construction Manual |publisher= [[American Institute of Steel Construction]] | edition  = 13th |year= 2006 |isbn= 1-56424-055-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Load combination equations==

===Allowable Strength Design===

For ASD, the required strength, R&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, is determined from the following load combinations (according to the AISC SCM, 13&amp;nbsp;ed.) and:&lt;ref&gt;https://shop.iccsafe.org/media/wysiwyg/material/9346S7-sample.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

D + F&lt;br /&gt;
D + H + F + L + T&lt;br /&gt;
D + H + F + (L&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; or S or R)&lt;br /&gt;
D + H + F + 0.75(L + T) + 0.75(L&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; or S or R)&lt;br /&gt;
D + H + F ± (0.6W or 0.7E)&lt;br /&gt;
D + H + F + (0.75W or 0.7E) + 0.75L + 0.75(L&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; or S or R)&lt;br /&gt;
0.6D + 0.6W&lt;br /&gt;
0.6D ± 0.7E

where:
* D = dead load,
* D&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = weight of Ice,
* E = earthquake load,
* F = load due to fluids with well-defined pressures and maximum heights,
* F&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = flood load,
* H = load due to lateral earth pressure, ground water pressure, or pressure of bulk materials,
* L = live load due to occupancy,
* L&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; = roof live load,
* S = snow load,
* R = nominal load due to initial rainwater or ice, exclusive of the ponding contribution,
* T = self straining load,
* W = wind load,
* W&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = wind on ice..

Special Provisions exist for accounting flood loads and atmospheric loads i.e. D&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and W&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;

Note that Allowable Strength Design is NOT equivalent to Allowable Stress Design, as governed by AISC 9th Edition. Allowable Strength Design still uses a strength, or ultimate level, design approach.

===Load and Resistance Factor Design===
For LRFD, the required strength, R&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;, is determined from the following factored load combinations:

1.4(D + F)&lt;br /&gt;
1.2(D + F + T) + 1.6(L + H) + 0.5(L&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; or S or R)&lt;br /&gt;
1.2D + 1.6(L&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; or S or R) + (L or 0.8W)&lt;br /&gt;
1.2D + 1.0W + L + 0.5(L&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; or S or R)&lt;br /&gt;
1.2D ± 1.0E + L + 0.2S + 0.9D + 1.6W + 1.6H&lt;br /&gt;
0.9D + 1.6 H ± (1.6W or 1.0E)

where the letters for the loads are the same as for ASD.

For the wind consideration, the ASCE allows a "position correction factor" which turns the coefficient of wind action to 1.36:

1.2D + 1.36W + .... the same above
or
0.9D - 1.36W

==AISC Steel Construction Manual==
The American Institute of Steel Construction ([[AISC]]), Inc. publishes the ''Steel Construction Manual'' (Steel construction manual, or SCM), which is currently in its 15th edition. Structural engineers use this manual in analyzing, and designing various steel structures. Some of the chapters of the book are as follows.

*Dimensions and properties of various types of steel sections available on the market (W, S, C, WT, HSS, etc.)
*General Design Considerations
*Design of [[Bending|Flexural Members]]

'''''The Music of Francis Poulenc (1899–1963): A Catalogue''''', abbreviated '''FP''', is a chronological catalogue of [[Francis Poulenc]]'s works which was published by Carl B. Schmidt in 1995. Schmidt provides for each known composition, which includes unfinished, unpublished and lost works, a detailed history of composition and performance, and lists manuscripts and publications.{{sfn|Schmidt|1995}}

As a pianist, Poulenc composed many pieces for his own instrument in [[List of solo piano compositions by Francis Poulenc|his piano music]] and [[chamber music]]. He wrote works for orchestra including several [[concerto]]s, also three [[opera]]s, two [[ballet]]s, [[incidental music]] for plays and [[film music]]. He composed songs (''mélodies''), often on texts by contemporary authors. His religious music includes the [[Mass (Poulenc)|Mass]] in G major, the [[Stabat Mater (Poulenc)|Stabat Mater]] and [[Gloria (Poulenc)|Gloria]].

== Overview ==
The composer had written a catalogue of his works in 1921, which is reproduced in Schmidt's book.{{sfn|Schmidt|1995|p=xxi}} According to this list, the first noted piece was in 1914 ''Processional pour la crémation d'un mandarin'' for piano, now lost or destroyed. Poulenc completed his last work, his [[Oboe Sonata (Poulenc)|Oboe Sonata]], in 1962.

'''Piano, chamber music and songs'''

As a professional pianist, Poulenc wrote many pieces for his own instrument. He was a prolific writer of works of [[chamber music]], often with piano, and some works for two pianos. Poulenc composed many songs (''mélodies''), most of them accompanied by piano, but some also in versions with a small instrumental ensembles, for example his ''[[Rapsodie nègre]]'' for baritone, flute, clarinet, string quartet and piano. He composed easily for woodwind instruments, scoring for example a [[Trio for oboe, bassoon and piano|piano trio with oboe and bassoon]] instead of the traditional violin and cello. Poulenc was less familiar with string instruments. The cellist [[Pierre Fournier]] helped him to write the [[Cello Sonata (Poulenc)|Cello Sonata]], which he premiered with the composer as the pianist.{{sfn|Prieto|2006}} Poulenc destroyed all sketches for string quartets and three for violin sonatas, while only the [[Violin Sonata (Poulenc)|fourth one]] survived, but was received critically.{{sfn|Hell|1978|p=180}}

'''Orchestra and stage'''

Among his works with orchestra are three [[opera]]s, two [[ballet]], [[incidental music]] for plays, [[film music]] and concertos, some with unusual solo instruments such as [[harpsichord]] and [[Organ (music)|organ]]. The harpsichordist [[Wanda Landowska]] inspired the composition of the [[Concert champêtre]].{{sfn|Ivry|1996}}

'''Collaboration in the group ''Les Six'''''

Poulenc was a member of the group of composers ''[[Les Six]]'', with [[Georges Auric]], [[Louis Durey]], [[Arthur Honegger]], [[Darius Milhaud]] and [[Germaine Tailleferre]], and contributed to their collective productions, which included another ballet.{{sfn|Bialek|2012}}

'''Sacred music and choral music'''

Poulenc turned to writing also religious music in the 1930s, composing a [[Mass (Poulenc)|Mass]] in G major for [[a cappella]] choir. He composed the [[Stabat Mater (Poulenc)|Stabat Mater]] in 1950 in memory of the painter [[Christian Bérard]] in 1950. The late [[Gloria (Poulenc)|Gloria]] for soprano, choir and orchestra became one of his best-known works.{{sfn|Hyperion|2016}}{{sfn|Clements|2008}} He drew inspiration for his sacred compositions mostly from liturgical texts.

''' Songs '''

For his songs and [[song cycle]]s, he often collaborated with contemporary poets, setting poems by writers such as [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Louis Aragon]], [[Paul Éluard]], [[Max Jacob]], [[Federico García Lorca]], [[Pierre de Ronsard|Ronsard]] and [[Louise de Vilmorin]], whom he mentioned in titles. He further set poems by [[Louis Aragon]], [[Théodore de Banville]], [[Maurice Carême]], [[Colette]], [[Robert Desnos]], [[Maurice Fombeure]], [[Marie Laurencin]], [[Madeleine Ley]], [[François de Malherbe]], [[Jean Moréas]], [[Jean Nohain]] and [[Paul Valéry]], among others. In 1943, during the occupation of France, a cantata ''[[Figure humaine]]'' on poems by Éluard which celebrate ''[[Liberté (poem)|Liberté]]''.{{sfn|Hell|1978|p=183}}

== Table of works ==

In the table, the works are initially listed by the FP number. Other information given is the French title, a translation if commonly used, the [[Key (music)|key]], the scoring if not clear from the title, the year(s) of composition, the genre, text information, notes and a free score when available, and the page number in the catalogue. Abbreviations used are "rev." for "revised", "orch." for "orchestrated" and "sc." for "score".{{sfn|Schmidt|1995}}

In ''Genre'', instrumental pieces are distinguished as ''orchestral'' and ''chamber'' music, particularly that for piano. The group of stage works contains operas, ballets and incidental music, while film scores are marked separately. Sacred and secular music for voice is divided in ''choral'', for [[cantata]]s and [[motet]]s, and ''vocal'', holding songs and song cycles.

'''Theoretical astronomy''' is the use of the analytical models of physics and chemistry to describe [[astronomical objects]] and astronomical phenomena.

[[Ptolemy]]'s [[Almagest]], although a brilliant treatise on theoretical [[astronomy]] combined with a practical handbook for computation, nevertheless includes many compromises to reconcile discordant observations. Theoretical astronomy is usually assumed to have begun with [[Johannes Kepler]] (1571–1630), and [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Kepler's laws]]. It is co-equal with observation. The general history of astronomy deals with the history of the descriptive and theoretical astronomy of the Solar System, from the late sixteenth century to the end of the nineteenth century. The major categories of works on the history of modern astronomy include general histories, national and institutional histories, instrumentation, descriptive astronomy, theoretical astronomy, positional astronomy, and astrophysics. Astronomy was early to adopt computational techniques to model stellar and galactic formation and celestial mechanics. From the point of view of theoretical astronomy, not only must the mathematical expression be reasonably accurate but it should preferably exist in a form which is amenable to further mathematical analysis when used in specific problems. Most of theoretical astronomy uses Newtonian theory of gravitation, considering that the effects of general relativity are weak for most celestial objects. The obvious fact is that theoretical astronomy cannot (and does not try to) predict the position, size and temperature of every star in the heavens. Theoretical astronomy by and large has concentrated upon analyzing the apparently complex but periodic motions of celestial objects.

The aim of astronomy is to understand the physics and chemistry from the laboratory that is behind cosmic events so as to enrich our understanding of the cosmos and of these sciences as well.&lt;ref name=Narlikar/&gt;

==Integrating astronomy and chemistry==
{{Main|Astrochemistry}}
'''Astrochemistry''', the overlap of the disciplines of [[astronomy]] and [[chemistry]], is the study of the abundance and reactions of [[chemical elements]] and molecules in space, and their interaction with radiation. The formation, atomic and chemical composition, evolution and fate of [[Molecular cloud|molecular gas cloud]]s, is of special interest because it is from these clouds that solar systems form.

Infrared astronomy, for example, has revealed that the [[interstellar medium]] contains a suite of complex gas-phase carbon compounds called aromatic hydrocarbons, often abbreviated ([[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon|PAH]]s or PACs). These molecules composed primarily of fused rings of carbon (either neutral or in an ionized state) are said to be the most common class of carbon compound in the galaxy. They are also the most common class of carbon molecule in [[meteorite]]s and in cometary and asteroidal dust ([[cosmic dust]]). These compounds, as well as the amino acids, nucleobases, and many other compounds in meteorites, carry [[deuterium]] (&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H) and [[isotope]]s of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen that are very rare on earth, attesting to their extraterrestrial origin. The PAHs are thought to form in hot circumstellar environments (around dying carbon rich [[red giant]] stars).

The sparseness of interstellar and interplanetary space results in some unusual chemistry, since symmetry-forbidden reactions cannot occur except on the longest of timescales. For this reason, molecules and molecular ions which are unstable on earth can be highly abundant in space, for example the [[Protonated molecular hydrogen|H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] ion. Astrochemistry overlaps with [[astrophysics]] and [[nuclear physics]] in characterizing the nuclear reactions which occur in stars, the consequences for [[stellar evolution]], as well as stellar 'generations'. Indeed, the nuclear reactions in stars produce every naturally occurring [[chemical element]]. As the stellar 'generations' advance, the mass of the newly formed elements increases. A first-generation star uses elemental [[hydrogen]] (H) as a fuel source and produces [[helium]] (He). Hydrogen is the most abundant element, and it is the basic building block for all other elements as its nucleus has only one [[proton]]. Gravitational pull toward the center of a star creates massive amounts of heat and pressure, which cause [[nuclear fusion]]. Through this process of merging nuclear mass, heavier elements are formed. [[Lithium]], [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]] are examples of elements that form in stellar fusion. After many stellar generations, very heavy elements are formed (e.g. [[iron]] and [[lead]]).

==Tools of theoretical astronomy==
Theoretical astronomers use a wide variety of tools which include [[mathematical model|analytical models]]  (for example, [[polytrope]]s to approximate the behaviors of a [[star]]) and [[computation]]al  [[Numerical analysis|numerical simulations]]. Each has some advantages. Analytical models of a process are generally better for giving insight into the heart of what is going on. Numerical models can reveal the existence of phenomena and effects that would otherwise not be seen.&lt;ref name=Roth&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.39.525|author=Roth H |title=A Slowly Contracting or Expanding Fluid Sphere and its Stability |journal=Phys. Rev. |volume=39|issue=3 |pages=525–9 |date=1932 |bibcode=1932PhRv...39..525R}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eddington&gt;{{Cite book|author=Eddington AS |title=Internal Constitution of the Stars |date=1926 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, England |isbn=0-521-33708-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astronomy theorists endeavor to create theoretical models and figure out the observational consequences of those models. This helps observers look for data that can refute a model or help in choosing between several alternate or conflicting models.

Theorists also try to generate or modify models to take into account new data. Consistent with the general scientific approach, in the case of an inconsistency, the general tendency is to try to make minimal modifications to the model to fit the data. In some cases, a large amount of inconsistent data over time may lead to total abandonment of a model.

==Topics of theoretical astronomy==
Topics studied by theoretical astronomers include:
# [[stellar dynamics]] and [[Stellar evolution|evolution]];
# [[Galaxy formation and evolution|galaxy formation]];
# [[large-scale structure of the universe|large-scale structure]]  of [[matter]]  in the [[Universe]];
# origin of [[cosmic ray]]s;
# [[general relativity]] and [[physical cosmology]], including [[string theory|string]] cosmology and [[astroparticle physics]].

Astrophysical relativity serves as a tool to gauge the properties of large scale structures for which gravitation plays a significant role in physical phenomena investigated and as the basis for [[black hole]] (''astro'')[[physics]] and the study of [[gravitational waves]].

==Astronomical models==
Some widely accepted and studied theories and models in astronomy, now included in the [[Lambda-CDM model]] are the [[Big Bang]], [[Cosmic inflation]], [[dark matter]], and fundamental theories of [[physics]].

==Leading topics in theoretical astronomy==
[[Dark matter]] and [[dark energy]] are the current leading topics in astronomy,&lt;ref&gt;http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/dark_matter.html third paragraph, "There is currently much ongoing research by scientists attempting to discover exactly what this dark matter is". Retrieved 2009-11-02&lt;/ref&gt; as their discovery and controversy originated during the study of the galaxies.

==Theoretical astrophysics==
Of the topics approached with the tools of theoretical physics, particular consideration is often given to stellar photospheres, stellar atmospheres, the solar atmosphere, planetary atmospheres, gaseous nebulae, nonstationary stars, and the interstellar medium. Special attention is given to the internal structure of stars.&lt;ref name=Sobolev&gt;{{Cite book|author=Sobolev VV |title=Course in theoretical astrophysics |date=1985 |pages=504 |edition=3rd revised and enlarged |publisher=Izdatel'stvo Nauka |location=Moscow |bibcode=1985cta..book.....S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weak equivalence principle===
The observation of a neutrino burst within 3 h of the associated optical burst from [[Supernova 1987A]] in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]] (LMC) gave theoretical astrophysicists an opportunity to test that neutrinos and photons follow the same trajectories in the gravitational field of the galaxy.&lt;ref name=Krauss&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Krauss LM|author2=Tremaine S |title=Test of the Weak Equivalence Principle for Neutrinos and Photons |journal=Phys.

A general form of the first law of thermodynamics for stationary [[black hole]]s can be derived from the microcanonical functional integral for the gravitational field.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Brown JD|author2=York JW Jr. |title=Microcanonical functional integral for the gravitational field |journal=Phys. Rev. D |date=Apr 1993 |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=1420–31 |url=http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.47.1420 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.47.1420 |arxiv = gr-qc/9209014 |bibcode = 1993PhRvD..47.1420B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The boundary data
# the gravitational field as described with a micocanonical system in a spatially finite region and
# the density of states expressed formally as a functional integral over Lorentzian metrics and as a functional of the geometrical boundary data that are fixed in the corresponding action,
are the thermodynamical extensive variables, including the energy and angular momentum of the system.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt; For the simpler case of nonrelativistic mechanics as is often observed in astrophysical phenomena associated with a black hole event horizon, the density of states can be expressed as a real-time functional integral and subsequently used to deduce Feynman's imaginary-time functional integral for the canonical partition function.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt;

==Theoretical astrochemistry==
Reaction equations and large reaction networks are an important tool in theoretical astrochemistry, especially as applied to the gas-grain chemistry of the interstellar medium.&lt;ref name=Vasyunin&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Vasyunin AI|author2=Semenov DA|author3=Wiebe DS|author4=Henning T |title=A UNIFIED MONTE CARLO TREATMENT OF GAS-GRAIN CHEMISTRY FOR LARGE REACTION NETWORKS. I. TESTING VALIDITY OF RATE EQUATIONS IN MOLECULAR CLOUDS |journal=Astrophys.

===Interstellar organics===
"An important goal for theoretical astrochemistry is to elucidate which organics are of true interstellar origin, and to identify possible interstellar precursors and reaction pathways for those molecules which are the result of aqueous alterations."&lt;ref name=Ehrenfreund&gt;{{Cite book|author=Ehrenfreund P|author2=Charnley SB|author3=Botta O |title=A voyage from dark clouds to the early Earth ''In: Astrophysics of life: proceedings of the Space Telescope Science Institute Symposium held in Baltimore, Maryland, May 6–9, 2002, Volume 16 of Space Telescope Science Institute symposium series'' |date=2005 |editor=Livio M |editor2= Reid IN |editor3=Sparks WB |pages=1–20 of 110 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, England |isbn=9780521824903 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the ways this goal can be achieved is through the study of carbonaceous material as found in some meteorites. Carbonaceous chondrites (such as C1 and C2) include organic compounds such as amines and amides; alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones; aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons; sulfonic and phosphonic acids; amino, hydroxycarboxylic, and carboxylic acids; purines and pyrimidines; and [[kerogen]]-type material.&lt;ref name=Ehrenfreund/&gt; The organic inventories of primitive meteorites display large and variable enrichments in deuterium, [[carbon-13]] (&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C), and [[nitrogen-15]] (&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N), which is indicative of their retention of an interstellar heritage.&lt;ref name=Ehrenfreund/&gt;

===Chemistry in cometary comae===
The chemical composition of comets should reflect both the conditions in the outer solar nebula some 4.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; ayr, and the nature of the natal interstellar cloud from which the [[Solar system]] was formed.&lt;ref name=Rodgers&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Rodgers SD|author2=Charnley SB |title=A model of the chemistry in cometary comae: deuterated molecules |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |date=Mar 2002 |volume=330 |issue=3 |pages=660–74 |bibcode=2002MNRAS.330..660R |doi=10.1046/j.1365-8711.2002.05165.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; While comets retain a strong signature of their ultimate interstellar origins, significant processing must have occurred in the protosolar nebula.&lt;ref name=Rodgers/&gt; Early models of coma chemistry showed that reactions can occur rapidly in the inner coma, where the most important reactions are proton transfer reactions.&lt;ref name=Rodgers/&gt; Such reactions can potentially cycle deuterium between the different coma molecules, altering the initial D/H ratios released from the nuclear ice, and necessitating the construction of accurate models of cometary deuterium chemistry, so that gas-phase coma observations can be safely extrapolated to give nuclear D/H ratios.&lt;ref name=Rodgers/&gt;

==Theoretical chemical astronomy==
While the lines of conceptual understanding between theoretical astrochemistry and theoretical chemical astronomy often become blurred so that the goals and tools are the same, there are subtle differences between the two sciences. Theoretical chemistry as applied to astronomy seeks to find new ways to observe chemicals in celestial objects, for example. This often leads to theoretical astrochemistry having to seek new ways to describe or explain those same observations.

===Astronomical spectroscopy===
The new era of chemical astronomy had to await the clear enunciation of the chemical principles of spectroscopy and the applicable theory.&lt;ref name=Merrill&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Merrill PW |title=Great Epochs in Astronomy |journal=Astronomical Society of the Pacific Leaflets |date=1954 |volume=7 |pages=41–8 |bibcode=1954ASPL....7...41M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemistry of dust condensation===
Supernova radioactivity dominates light curves and the chemistry of dust condensation is also dominated by radioactivity.&lt;ref name=Clayton&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Clayton DD|author2= Liu W |title=Radioactivity Frontier for Supernova Chemistry |journal=Bull. Am. Astron. Soc. |date=1999 |volume=31 |pages=739 |bibcode=1999HEAD....4.3602C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dust is usually either carbon or oxides depending on which is more abundant, but Compton electrons dissociate the CO molecule in about one month.&lt;ref name=Clayton/&gt; The new chemical astronomy of supernova solids depends on the supernova radioactivity:
# the radiogenesis of &lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Ca  from &lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Ti decay after carbon condensation establishes their supernova source,
# their opacity suffices to shift emission lines blueward after 500 d and emits significant infrared luminosity,
# parallel kinetic rates determine trace isotopes in meteoritic supernova graphites,
# the chemistry is kinetic rather than due to thermal equilibrium and
# is made possible by radiodeactivation of the CO trap for carbon.&lt;ref name=Clayton/&gt;

==Theoretical physical astronomy==
Like theoretical chemical astronomy, the lines of conceptual understanding between theoretical astrophysics and theoretical physical astronomy are often blurred, but, again, there are subtle differences between these two sciences. Theoretical physics as applied to astronomy seeks to find new ways to observe physical phenomena in celestial objects and what to look for, for example. This often leads to theoretical astrophysics having to seek new ways to describe or explain those same observations, with hopefully a convergence to improve our understanding of the local environment of Earth and the physical [[Universe]].

===Weak interaction and nuclear double beta decay===
Nuclear matrix elements of relevant operators as extracted from data and from a shell-model and theoretical approximations both for the two-neutrino and neutrinoless modes of decay are used to explain the weak interaction and nuclear structure aspects of nuclear double beta decay.&lt;ref name=Suhonen&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0370-1573(97)00087-2|author=Suhonen J|author2=Civitarese O |title=Weak-interaction and nuclear-structure aspects of nuclear double beta decay |journal=Phys.

===Neutron-rich isotopes===
New neutron-rich isotopes, &lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;Ne, &lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt;Na, and &lt;sup&gt;43&lt;/sup&gt;Si have been produced unambiguously for the first time, and convincing evidence for the particle instability of three others, &lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;Ne, &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Na, and &lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt;Mg has been obtained.&lt;ref name=Notani&gt;{{Cite journal|display-authors=6|author=Notani M|author2=Sakurai H|author3=Aoi N|author4=Yanagisawa Y|author5=Saito A|author6=Imai N|author7=Gomi T|author8=Miura M|author9=Michimasa S|author10=Iwasaki H|author11=Fukuda N|author12=Ishihara M|author13=Kubo T|author14= Kubono S|author15=Kumagai H|author16=Lukyanov SM|author17=Motobayashi T|author18=Onishi TK|author19=Penionzhkevich YE|author20=Shimoura S|author21=Teranishi T|author22=Ue K|author23=Ugryumov V|author24=Yoshida A |title=New neutron-rich isotopes, &lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;Ne, &lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt;Na and &lt;sup&gt;43&lt;/sup&gt;Si, produced by fragmentation of a 64 A MeV 48Ca beam |journal=Phys.

==Theory of astronomical time keeping==
Until recently all the time units that appear natural to us are caused by astronomical phenomena:
# Earth's orbit around the Sun =&gt; the year, and the seasons,
# [[Moon]]'s orbit around the Earth =&gt; the month,
# Earth's rotation and the succession of brightness and darkness =&gt; the day (and night).

High precision appears problematic:
# amibiguities arise in the exact definition of a rotation or revolution,
# some astronomical processes are uneven and irregular, such as the noncommensurability of year, month, and day,
# there are a multitude of time scales and calendars to solve the first two problems.&lt;ref name=Husfeld&gt;{{Cite web|author=Husfeld D|author2=Kronberg C |title=Astronomical Time Keeping |url=http://www.maa.mhn.de/Scholar/times.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these time scales are [[sidereal time]], [[solar time]], and [[universal time]].

===Atomic time===
{{Main|International Atomic Time}}
[[File:Clock accuracy.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Historical accuracy of atomic clocks from [[NIST]].]]
From the [[International System of Units|Systeme Internationale]] (SI) comes the second as defined by the duration of 9 192 631 770 cycles of a particular hyperfine structure transition in the ground state of [[caesium-133]] (&lt;sup&gt;133&lt;/sup&gt;Cs).&lt;ref name=Husfeld/&gt; For practical usability a device is required that attempts to produce the SI second (s) such as an [[atomic clock]]. But not all such clocks agree. The weighted mean of many clocks distributed over the whole Earth defines the [[International Atomic Time|Temps Atomique International]]; i.e., the Atomic Time TAI.&lt;ref name=Husfeld/&gt; From the [[General theory of relativity]] the time measured depends on the altitude on earth and the spatial velocity of the clock so that TAI refers to a location on sea level that rotates with the Earth.&lt;ref name=Husfeld/&gt;

===Ephemeris time===
{{Main|Ephemeris time}}
Since the Earth's rotation is irregular, any time scale derived from it such as [[Greenwich Mean Time]] led to recurring problems in predicting the [[Ephemeris|Ephemerides]] for the positions of the [[Moon]], [[Sun]], [[planet]]s and their [[natural satellite]]s.&lt;ref name=Husfeld/&gt; In 1976 the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) resolved that the theoretical basis for ephemeris time (ET) was wholly non-relativistic, and therefore, beginning in 1984 ephemeris time would be replaced by two further time scales with allowance for relativistic corrections. Their names, assigned in 1979,&lt;ref name=Guinot&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Guinot B|author2=Seidelmann PK |title=Time scales&amp;nbsp;– Their history, definition and interpretation |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics |date=Apr 1988 |volume=194 |issue=1–2 |pages=304–8 |bibcode=1988A&amp;A...194..304G }}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasized their dynamical nature or origin, [[Barycentric Dynamical Time]] (TDB) and [[Terrestrial Dynamical Time]] (TDT).  Both were defined for continuity with ET and were based on what had become the standard SI second, which in turn had been derived from the measured second of ET.
{{See also|Dynamical time scale}}
During the period 1991–2006, the TDB and TDT time scales were both redefined and replaced, owing to difficulties or inconsistencies in their original definitions. The current fundamental relativistic time scales are [[Geocentric Coordinate Time]] (TCG) and [[Barycentric Coordinate Time]] (TCB). Both of these have rates that are based on the SI second in respective reference frames (and hypothetically outside the relevant gravity well), but due to relativistic effects, their rates would appear slightly faster when observed at the Earth's surface, and therefore diverge from local Earth-based time scales using the SI second at the Earth's surface.&lt;ref name=Klioner&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Klioner S |display-authors=etal |title=Units of relativistic time scales and associated quantities |journal=IAU Symposium |volume=261 |date=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The currently defined IAU time scales also include [[Terrestrial Time]] (TT) (replacing TDT, and now defined as a re-scaling of TCG, chosen to give TT a rate that matches the SI second when observed at the Earth's surface),&lt;ref name=Resol&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://syrte.obspm.fr/IAU_resolutions/Resol-UAI.rtf |title=IAU 2000 resolutions, at Resolution B1.9. }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a redefined Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB), a re-scaling of TCB to give TDB a rate that matches the SI second at the Earth's surface.

===Extraterrestrial time-keeping===
{{Main|Timekeeping on Mars|Martian calendar}}

===Stellar dynamical time scale===
For a [[star]], the dynamical time scale is defined as the time that would be taken for a test particle released at the surface to fall under the [[star]]'s potential to the centre point, if pressure forces were negligible.  In other words, the dynamical time scale measures the amount of time it would take a certain [[star]] to collapse in the absence of any [[internal pressure]].  By appropriate manipulation of the equations of stellar structure this can be found to be

&lt;math&gt; \tau_{dynamical} \simeq \frac{R}{v} = \sqrt{\frac{R^3}{2GM}} \sim 1/\sqrt{G\rho} &lt;/math&gt;

where R is the [[radius]] of the star, G is the [[gravitational constant]], M is the [[mass]] of the star and v is the [[escape velocity]].  As an example, the [[Sun]] dynamical time scale is approximately 1133 seconds.  Note that the actual time it would take a star like the Sun to collapse is greater because internal pressure is present.

The 'fundamental' oscillatory mode of a star will be at approximately the dynamical time scale. Oscillations at this frequency are seen in [[Cepheid variables]].

==Theory of astronomical navigation==

===On earth===

The basic characteristics of applied astronomical navigation are
# usable in all areas of sailing around the earth,
# applicable autonomously (does not depend on others&amp;nbsp;– persons or states) and passively (does not emit energy),
# conditional usage via optical visibility (of horizon and celestial bodies), or state of cloudiness,
# precisional measurement, sextant is 0.1', altitude and position is between 1.5' and 3.0'.
# temporal determination takes a couple of minutes (using the most modern equipment) and ≤ 30 min (using classical equipment).&lt;ref name=Stajic/&gt;

The superiority of satellite navigation systems to astronomical navigation are currently undeniable, especially with the development and use of GPS/NAVSTAR.&lt;ref name=Stajic&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Stajic D |title=Astronomical navigation at the beginning of the third millenium |journal=Publ Astron Obs Belgrade ''In: Proceedings of the XIII National Conference of Yugoslav Astronomers, Belgrade, October 17–20, 2002'' |date=Oct 2003 |volume=75 |pages=209–16 |bibcode=2003POBeo..75..209S }}{{sic}}&lt;/ref&gt; This global satellite system
# enables automated three-dimensional positioning at any moment,
# automatically determines position continuously (every second or even more often),
# determines position independent of weather conditions (visibility and cloudiness),
# determines position in real time to a few meters (two carrying frequencies) and 100 m (modest commercial receivers), which is two to three orders of magnitude better than by astronomical observation,
# is simple even without expert knowledge,
# is relatively cheap, comparable to equipment for astronomical navigation, and
# allows incorporation into integrated and automated systems of control and ship steering.&lt;ref name=Stajic/&gt; The use of astronomical or celestial navigation is disappearing from the surface and beneath or above the surface of the earth.
{{See also|Geodetic astronomy|Astronomical algorithm|Figure of the Earth|International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service}}
'''Geodetic astronomy''' is the application of [[astronomy|astronomical]] methods into [[Wiktionary:Network|network]]s and technical projects of [[geodesy]] for
* [[apparent places]] of stars, and their [[proper motion]]s
* precise astronomical [[astro navigation|navigation]]
* astro-geodetic [[geoid]] determination and
* modelling the rock [[density|densities]] of the topography and of [[geological]] layers in the [[subsurface]]
* [[Satellite geodesy]] using the stellar background (see also [[astrometry]] and cosmic triangulation)
* Monitoring of the [[Earth rotation]] and polar wandering
* Contribution to the time system of physics and [[geosciences]]

'''Astronomical algorithms''' are the [[algorithm]]s used to calculate [[ephemeris|ephemerides]], [[calendar]]s, and positions (as in [[celestial navigation]] or [[satellite navigation]]).

Many astronomical and navigational computations use the [[Figure of the Earth]] as a surface representing the earth.

The [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service]] (IERS), formerly the International Earth Rotation Service, is the body responsible for maintaining global time and [[Frame of reference|reference frame]] standards, notably through its Earth Orientation Parameter (EOP) and [[International Celestial Reference System]] (ICRS) groups.

===Deep space===
{{Main|Deep Space Network}}
The '''Deep Space Network''', or '''DSN''', is an international [[Wiktionary:network|network]] of large [[#Antennas|antenna]]s and communication facilities that supports [[interplanetary spaceflight|interplanetary]] [[spacecraft]] missions, and [[radio astronomy|radio]] and [[radar astronomy]] observations for the exploration of the [[solar system]] and the [[universe]]. The network also supports selected Earth-orbiting missions. DSN is part of the [[NASA]] [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL).

===Aboard an exploratory vehicle===
An observer becomes a deep space explorer upon escaping Earth's orbit.&lt;ref name=Kawakatsu&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2006.12.019|author=Kawakatsu Y |title=Concept study on Deep Space Orbit Transfer Vehicle |journal=Acta Astronautica |date=Dec 2007 |volume=61 |issue=11–12 |pages=1019–28 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576507001300|bibcode=2007AcAau..61.1019K}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[Deep Space Network]] maintains communication and enables data download from an exploratory vessel, any local probing performed by sensors or active systems aboard usually require astronomical navigation, since the enclosing network of satellites to ensure accurate positioning is absent.

The '''Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala''' ('''USAC''', ''University of San Carlos of Guatemala'') is the biggest and oldest university of Guatemala; it is also the fourth founded in [[the Americas]]. Established in the [[Kingdom of Guatemala]] during the Spanish colony, it was the most prestigious institution of higher education in [[Central America]] — and the only one in Guatemala until 1954.&lt;ref group = lower-alpha&gt;In 1954 a coup led by the National Liberation Movement which was sponsored by the [[United Fruit Company]] and coordinated by [[CIA]] and [[State Department]] American operatives who had links with the US company triumphed .&lt;/ref&gt;

The University has had five major transformations:
* '''Royal and Pontifical University of San Carlos Borromeo''' (1676–1829): Established during the colony by the Spanish Crown in the 17th century, approved by the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and directed by [[regular clergy|regular orders]] of the [[Catholic Church]]. After the [[Act of Independence of Central America|Independence in 1821]], it was called only Pontifical University.
* '''Academia de Ciencias''' ('''Academy of Science''') (1834–1840): a secular institution created during the [[Central American Federation]] by the liberal governor [[Mariano Galvez]].
* '''Pontifical University of San Carlos Borromeo''' (1840–1875): an ecclesiastical institution run by the [[regular clergy|regular orders]] during the governments of [[Rafael Carrera]] and [[Vicente Cerna y Cerna]], ratified by the [[Concordat of 1854]].
* '''National University of Guatemala''' (1875–1944): a secular and [[positivism|positivist]] institution divided into colleges of Notary and Law, Medicine and Pharmacy.
* '''University of San Carlos of Guatemala''' (1944-): a socially oriented secular institution established after the [[Guatemalan Revolution|Revolution of 1944]].

The University grew out of the Colegio de Santo Tomás de Aquino (Saint Thomas Aquinas High School), founded in 1562 by Bishop [[Francisco Marroquín]].&lt;ref name=paganini/&gt; After a series of [[1773 Guatemala earthquake|major earthquakes in 1773]], which destroyed many parts of the city of Santiago de los Caballeros, the crown authorities ordered the evacuation of the city and the relocation of its government, religious and university functions to the new capital [[Guatemala City|La Nueva Guatemala de la Asunción]], the  university's present location.&lt;ref name=paganini&gt;{{harvnb|Paganini|1947|pp=49–197}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early years, from the 16th to 19th centuries, it offered studies in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil]] and [[liturgical]] law, [[theology]], [[philosophy]], [[medicine]] and [[indigenous languages of the Americas|indigenous languages]].

However, their activities were interrupted after the Independence of [[Central America]] in 1821. At that time, each province of the former [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]] promoted the creation of a local university. The university remained as an institution in Guatemala, but it closed in 1829, after the conservative [[criollo people|criollos]] were expelled from Central America, and in 1834 converted into the "Academy of Sciences". In 1840, with the comeback of the conservatives, it was turned into the "Pontifical University of San Carlos Borromeo" once again and even for a short period between 1918 and 1920, it was called "Estrada Cabrera University" in honor of the then president, lawyer [[Manuel Estrada Cabrera]]. After the [[Guatemalan Revolution|Revolution of October 1944]], the USAC managed to obtain total autonomy, but from 1954, with the resurgence of Catholic education and the establishment of private universities, an attrition process of the university began, which included constant nonpayment of the budget percentage that corresponds to the University by the Constitution and the persecution and assassination of student leaders and faculty members throughout the duration of the [[Guatemala Civil War]] (1960–1996).

==History==
===First era: Royal and Pontifical University of San Carlos Borromeo ===
[[File:Carlo Borromeo.jpg|200px|thumb|Saint [[Charles Borromeo|Carlo Borromeo]], by [[Giovanni Ambrogio Figino]]. Oil on canvas, 41 × 48 cm. [[Biblioteca Ambrosiana]]. The University of San Carlos was established under his protection on 31 January 1676.&lt;ref name=paganini/&gt;]]
The university tradition in Guatemala and Central America goes back to the 17th century, when the University of San Carlos was founded on 31 January 1676 by Royal Decree of [[Carlos II of Spain|Carlos II]] in the colonial capital of [[Antigua, Guatemala|Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala]]. The Royal University of San Carlos became the third Royal College founded in Spanish America and it was consecrated by [[Pope Innocent XI]] on June 18, 1687.&lt;ref name=paganini/&gt;

[[File:1a. Universidad.JPG|thumb|200px|Section of the memorial to the first University in the city of [[Antigua Guatemala]]&lt;ref name=paganini/&gt;]]
Colonization by the Spaniards implied a new formation of society, with its brand new civil and ecclesiastical institutions. As time went by, residents demanded a place in the royal institutions for their descendants, in return for the heroics of their ancestors during the battles of conquest. However, there were no schools to teach youth to become public servants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pavón Romero|first=Armando|title=Universitarios en la Nueva España|publisher=CESU-UNAM |location=México|year=2003|language=Spanish|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until the second half of the 16th century that the first initiatives to found schools that covered more than religious indoctrination and reading and writing took place. The first bishop of Guatemala, [[Francisco Marroquín]], requested the approval of the Spanish crown to set up a grammar class, in which Latin was to be taught, as it was the intellectual language of the time. This single fact has been the basis to perpetuate the myth that links bishop Marroquin to the early stages of the University of San Carlos.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Among those historians that have perpetuated the myth is Juan Rodríguez Cabal, who presented a letter that Marroquín sent to Spain in 1548 requesting the establishment of a university. Rodríguez Cabal's investigations were published for the first time in the 1950s, and as part of the third centennial of the foundation of the University of San Carlos in 1976, the University of San Carlos press made several more copies.&lt;ref name=cabal/&gt;}}

Towards the end of his life, in 1562, Marroquin left in his will some funds to set up a school, the Santo Tomás de Aquino, where  Grammar, Arts, Philosophy and Theology would be taught. The beneficiaries of this pious enterprise would be the children of poor Spaniards, given that they could not travel to cities (like Mexico) where the Royal Universities were. This will has been also interpreted by scholars as the origin of the University of San Carlos. However, the late priest had a clear idea of the difference between a school (i.e., a home for students, with or without classes) and a university (or General Study) where the students earned degrees. About this, historian John Tate Lanning tells that "his will is so well known that there are some scholars that have not even seen it and have already read a lot of things that are not there at all. Nowhere in his will Marroquín talks about any university, much less talk about his intentions to establish one..."{{sfn|Tate Lanning|1977|p=8}} On the other hand, what is documented is that major Pedro Crespo Suárez left in his will twenty thousand pesos to set up the classes for the university that is "in the works with the authorities".&lt;ref name=hernandez30&gt;{{harvnb|Hernández de León|1930|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1598, the third bishop of Guatemala Gómez Fernández de Córdoba y Santillán, O.S.H., following ecclesiastical directions from the [[Council of Trent]] and on the basis of the royal decrees issued after that council, authorized the foundation of the "Nuestra Señora de la Asunción" School and Seminary, which was the first higher educational institution in the [[Kingdom of Guatemala]].{{sfn|Pérez Puente|2012|pp=188-194}} The [[Jesuits]], who already had their Colegio de San Borja and wanted to run the Seminary themselves, opposed its foundation, as they did not like other [[regular clergy|regular orders]] - [[Mercedarians]], [[Franciscans]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] or the leader of the [[secular clergy]] took an initiative in religious and educational matters.

The president of the Real Audiencia authorized that classes should start while they were awaiting the authorization to build the new school for the students; at the time they only had one classroom in the Dominican convent where, in theory, they gave the Arts, Theology and Religion classes.{{sfn|Pérez Puente|2012|p=195}} After several decades, discussions and petitions, king [[Carlos II of Spain|Carlos II]] on 31 January 1676, granted a license to the city of [[Antigua Guatemala|Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala]] to found a University. This would be third royal university in the Spanish Empire in America, and the second in New Spain, after the one in Mexico.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;To review the process that led to the foundation of the University of San Carlos,
it is recommended to read procedure 373 of the Guatemalan Real Audiencia en the General Archive of Indias.&lt;/ref&gt; After the disputatious process of organization, and five years after the royal decree, the university started officially its lectures of five of the nine classes, on 7 January 1681, with little more of sixty registered students and with its first president, Dr. José de Baños y Soto Mayor, who was in charge of the Cathedral, Preacher of the King of Spain and Doctor from the University of Osuna.&lt;ref name=hernandez30/&gt;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;About the first setup of the university, the historical records are not too precise and even contradictory. See in the Central American General Archive, A1. Leg. 1885, Exp. 12245.&lt;/ref&gt; The university started under the protection of [[Charles Borromeo|San Carlos Borromeo]], with its first directive written by Francisco Saraza y Arce, who copied from those of the University of México which, in turn, were adapted from the [[Universidad de Salamanca]] in Spain.&lt;ref name=paganini/&gt;

==== First graduates and science teaching ====
[[File:Antonio Liendo y Goicochea.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Antonio Liendo y Goicoechea]], a Franciscan friar, reformed education at the University.  He was a professor of most of the eventual leaders of the Central American independence.]]
In 1660 the printer [[:es:José de Pineda Ibarra]] arrived at [[Antigua Guatemala|Santiago de los Caballeros]]. Among all his works he introduced university graduation cards, where it was written what the final exam was going to be about, date and time for the exam, and the names of the university authorities and student sponsors.{{sfn|Luján Muñoz|1980|p=12}}

On 11 July 1717, thirty years after the its papal sanction, the first medicine student graduated; his name was Vicente Ferrer González. The next physician to graduate was Pedro Palacios y Cóbar, who presented his final exam seventeen years later; and forty-seven years after that, the eminent Dr. [[José Felipe Flores]] graduated.

The Franciscan friar Juan Antonio Liendo y Goicoechea reformed university education towards the end of the 18th century by introducing science; Chemistry, Physics, Anatomy and Mathematics; and technology studies.{{sfn|Luján Muñoz|1980|p=12}}

=== Second era: Science Academy ===
[[File:Retratogalvez 2014-06-22 11-25.jpg|thumb|200px|Doctor [[Mariano Gálvez]] during his gubernatorial term as Head of State of Guatemala&lt;br /&gt;He founded the agnostic Science Academy in substitution of the religious University of San Carlos.&lt;br /&gt;He is buried in the Museum of the University - formerly College of Law-.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Viaje a Guatemala|year=n.d.|url=http://www.viajeaguatemala.com/museo-nacional-de-historia-donde-guatemala-cuenta-su-pasado|journal=Viaje a Guatemala|title=Museo Nacional de Historia: donde Guatemala cuenta su pasado|accessdate=30 June 2014|language=Spanish|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

After Independence, the University of San Carlos lost its Royal status and became simply the "Pontifical University of San Carlos Borromeo" but it was in a precarious position: after the move from [[Antigua Guatemala|Santiago de los Caballeros]] it had to use a borrowed building to teach, and in 1821 its new one was not finished yet; besides, the political climate of the region was very unstable at the time. In 1825, Dr. [[Juan José de Aycinena y Piñol]] was elected as president of the University, and kept the religious curriculum that the institution had had for decades. However, in 1829, the conservative regime of his brother [[Mariano de Aycinena y Piñol]] was defeated by the liberal general [[Francisco Morazán]], and the conservatives - mainly the Aycinena family - and the [[regular clergy]] were expelled from [[Central America]] and the University was suspended. In 1834, when doctor [[Mariano Gálvez]] was head of State of Guatemala, he found the Science Academy in the State, which took the position that the Pontifical University had previously occupied; the new university eliminated religious education altogether and implemented clases of [[Algebra]], [[Geometry]], [[Trigonometry]] and [[Physics]]; besides, the institution began to offer studies in engineering. The Academy of Science was open until 1840, because in that year the conservatives regained power in Guatemala under the strong leadership of General [[Rafael Carrera]] who reopened the old "Pontifical University of San Carlos Borromeo";&lt;ref name=cabal&gt;{{cite book|last=Rodríguez Cabal|first=Juan|title= Universidad de Guatemala: su origen, fundación, organización|publisher=Universitaria|location=Guatemala|year=1976|language=Spanish|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Aycinena was once again named as president of the university.

=== Third era: Pontifical University ===
{{Main article|Concordat of 1854}}

[[File:Concordato2.jpg|thumb|200px|Article #2 of the [[Concordat of 1854]] by which the Government of Guatemala entrusted the country's education to the Catholic Church]]
The power that the Catholic Church and the Aycinena family - to whom most of Carrera's advisors and secretaries belonged - had during the conservative regime in Guatemala was ratified the [[Concordat of 1854]], in which Guatemala entrusted the education of its people to the regular clergy of the Catholic Church, committed itself to respect all church property -including haciendas, monasteries and sugar mills, authorized mandatory tithing and let the bishops censor all the country's publications; in return, Guatemala obtained indulgences for Army members, was allowed to keep all those properties that had been taken from the orders in 1829 - provided they were now in private hands, received a tax of the church inconme and had the right to prosecute any priest or bishop under Guatemalan law, if necessary.{{sfn|Aycinena|1854|p=1-16}} The [[concordat]] was designed by [[Juan José de Aycinena y Piñol]], who was a cabinet member of the government - besides being the University president; then, it was first ratified by Secretary of the Interior, Justice and Ecclesiastical affairs [[Pedro de Aycinena]] and finally, approved by president [[Rafael Carrera]], who in 1854 was appointed as Guatemala's president for life.

=== Fourth era: The university during the Liberal regimes===

After the Liberal Revolution in 1871, the conservatives defeat resulted in a complete change of direction in the education in Guatemala:  once again the [[regular clergy]] was expelled from the country, and all of their properties we confiscated. The education changed from completely religious to agnostic and kept like that until 1954.

The new Liberal regime founded the Polytechnic School -Military Academy- in 1873 to prepare military engineers, topographers and telegraphers, besides military officers. In July 1875, [[Justo Rufino Barrios]] closed the Pontifical University of San Carlos Borromeo and in its place founded the Central College of Law and the Central College of Medicine and Pharmacy which formed the National University of Guatemala.  The government decreed that the teaching of Medicine had to be practical - as much as possible - and philosophical, with all the modern scientific theories.{{sfn|Chapa Bezanilla|2004|p=58}} In 1877, the government found the Western College of Law in [[Quetzaltenango]]{{sfn|Arévalo Martínez|1945|p=12}} and in 1879 founded the National Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcd.gob.gt/biblioteca-nacional/|title=Biblioteca Nacional|location=Guatemala|author=Ministerio de Cultura y Deportes|accessdate=26 July 2014|language=Spanish|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President general [[Manuel Lisandro Barillas Bercián]] (1885–1892) founded the Western College of Medicine in [[Quetzaltenango]] and granted scholarship to the best students to continue their education abroad, both from Guatemala and Quetzaltenango.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Museo Militar|url=http://museo.mil.gt/v1/index.php/manuel-lisandro-barillas |journal=Museo Militar de Guatemala|title=Manuel Lisandro Barillas|year=n.d.|accessdate=7 August 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211055122/http://museo.mil.gt/v1/index.php/manuel-lisandro-barillas|archivedate=11 December 2014|language=Spanish|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Torres|2007|p=12}}

On 21 March 1893, during the government of general [[José María Reina Barrios]], decree #193 of the [[Congress of Guatemala|National Assembly]] established that all the board of directors members, deans and faculty of the National University colleges would be appointed by the [[President of Guatemala]]; thus the colleges lost the autonomy to select their own authorities.{{sfn|Arévalo Martínez|1945|p=76}}

In 1897, after the failure of the [[Exposición Centroamericana]] and the deep economic crisis that ensued, Reina Barrios implemented austerity measures that included closing the schools and University colleges.{{sfn|Torres Espinoza|2007|p=14}} At the end of that year, Salvador Mendieta came back to Guatemala to attend the University, but due the political stability of the times after the revolts against Reina Barrios both in the Eastern and Western regions of the country once it was known that Reina Barrios had extended his presidential term, and the closing of the university, decided to move to [[México]] in early 1898.{{sfn|Silva H.|n.d.|p=5}} However, after the assassination of president Reina Barrios on 8 February, the Guatemalan government reopened the educational institutions, claiming that they were the basis for all the Liberal institutions;  Mendieta, then, registered to begin that semester in the College of Law of the National University.{{sfn|Silva H.|n.d.|p=5}}

==== Estrada Cabrera presidency====
{{Main article|Manuel Estrada Cabrera}}

{{quote box|align=left|width=300px|At that moment, the new association started the student body reaction against the feudalist Centralamerica that prepared its students for political servility.|Salvador Mendieta&lt;br /&gt;About "El Derecho" student association&lt;br /&gt;1899}}

[[File:Medicina1907.jpg|200px|thumb|College of Medicine and Pharmacy in 1897.]]

Nicaraguan citizen Salvador Mendieta, who had already been expelled once from the Central National Institute for Boys by the former president [[José María Reyna Barrios]] for attempting to form a student association aimed at criticizing the school principal,{{sfn|Silva H.|n.d.|p=5}} founded on 18 June 1899 along with other fellow students "El Derecho" student association.  The new association had members from the colleges of Law, Engineering and Medicine and an ideology identified with the Central American union.{{sfn|Silva H.|n.d.|p=5-6}} The new society became public on 15 September 1899 when the Guatemala City mayor invited some of its members to ceremonies for the Independence of Central America celebration that took place in the College of Law.

This society had several humanistic and social goals:
* gather all the Central American students around the idea of the region unity
* tighten social relationships and encourage intellectual sharing
* promote the formation of similar societies all across Central America
* organize the fight between those who think and those who oppress.{{sfn|Silva H.|n.d.|p=6-7}}

Due to the strong accusations against his presidency, Estrada Cabrera closed "El Derecho" after only a year of its life, and they had Mendieta sent to prison after which he sent the Nicaraguan into exile for promoting rebellion against his government.{{sfn|Silva H.|n.d.|p=7}}

In April 1899, the National Assembly submitted Estrada Cabrera a decree declaring the autonomy of the University colleges to elect their own authorities; the president vetoed the decree indicating that "''the colleges could not be autonomous given that they were dependent on the State in all senses [...]''"{{sfn|Arévalo Martínez|1945|p=76}} Therefore, the different colleges remain as dependencies of the Secretary of Public Education, which submitted a yearly review of their status, and also recommended the president who to choose as dean and faculty members. Also, by a decree published on 16 June 1900, Estrada Cabrera militarized all the male student centers, including the university colleges, who received military instruction for the six first months of their careers.&lt;ref name=arzobispado/&gt;

[[File:Usac1907.jpg|thumb|200px|Facsimile of a decree published in ''El Guatemalteco'', official newspaper of Guatemala in 1907, showing that President of Guatemala appointed the National University faculty members.{{sfn|El Guatemalteco|22 March 1907|p=4}}]]

By 1907, the colleges were:

* College of Law (seventy students)
* College of Medicine and Pharmacy (150 students)
* Dentistry institute (5 students)
* School of midwives (10 students)
* School of Engineering (15 students){{sfn|El Guatemalteco|22 May 1907|p=6-7}}

Note that in 1907, the school of Engineering was part of the National University. This school, due to budget reasons, was alternatively part of the National University and the Military Academy; finally in 1908, the school was left as part of the university for good, after president Estrada Cabrera closed the Academy following a failed assassination attempt that the cadets had plotted against him.{{sfn|Arévalo Martínez|1945|p=128}}

In  1918, the servility towards the presidents was at its peak and the university was renamed "University of Guatemala, Estrada Cabrera", by decree of the National Assembly on 2 May 1918.{{sfn|El Guatemalteco|15 May 1918|p=3}} Francisco Galvez Portocarrero, close friend of the president, lobbied heavily for the new university given that in a recent trip to [[Perú]], [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]] he liked the model the universities followed in those South American countries. Upon returning to Guatemala, Galvez - who was also a National Assembly representative- brought along a complete library about universities and convinced both the president and the Assembly members to create the "University of Guatemala".{{sfn|Hernández de León|1930|p=15 de mayo}}

==== Carlos Herrera presidency (1920–1921) ====
{{Main article|Carlos Herrera y Luna}}

University "Estrada Cabrera", was closed after the falling of the former president. However, one of the first decrees of the new president [[Carlos Herrera y Luna]] -appointed president by the National Assembly on 8 April- was to appoint new authorities and faculty for the National University, which now had the following academic departments:{{sfn|Silva H.|n.d.|p=58}}

* College of Natural Science and Pharmacy
* College of Law
* College of Medicine
* College of engineering

Herrera y Luna, as a token of appreciation of all the efforts of the university students during the last days of Estrada Cabrera regime, gave the different colleges their autonomy to elected their own authorities, although it did not grant them full autonomy.  At this time the Student Body Association was founded and included [[Miguel Angel Asturias]], among a series of other Guatemalan intellectuals, and the second era of "El Derecho" Law student association, which had been closed by Estrada Cabrera in 1899.{{sfn|Silva H.|s.f.|p=58}}

=== Fifth era: the University after the 1944 Revolution ===
{{Main article|Guatemalan Revolution}}

After the revolution against general Ubico's successor, general [[Federico Ponce Vaides]], on 20 October 1944, the new government granted its complete autonomy to the University; Decree #12 on 11 November 1944 granted autonomy and renamed the institution as "Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala" ("University of San Carlos of Guatemala"). The university's new role was to be director of college education in Guatemala, and to cooperated in study and solution of the critical problems that Guatemala faced at the time.&lt;ref name=arzobispado&gt;{{cite journal|author=ODHA|title=Era por la vida tras por lo que íbamos|editor=Monseñor Mario Ríos Mont|year=n.d.|location=Guatemala|journal=Oficina de Derechos Humanos del Arzobispado|url=http://www.odhag.org.gt/pdf/Era%20tras%20la%20vida.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729151405/http://www.odhag.org.gt/pdf/Era%20tras%20la%20vida.pdf|archivedate=29 July 2014|language=Spanish|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New colleges were created that time:

* College of Human Studies: created by then president Dr. [[Juan José Arévalo]] on 17 September 1945. Among its founder were Dr. [[Eduardo García Máynez]] -professor emeritus of the [[Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México]]- as honorary faculty. The college studied: [[Philosophy]], [[History]], [[Literature]], [[Psychology]] and [[Pedagogy]].&lt;ref name=arevalo&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc3KBvf5gwI |title=Vida de Juan José Arévalo|website=Youtube|accessdate=14 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* College of Agriculture
* College of Architecture
* College of Economics&lt;ref name=cabal/&gt;

Likewise, access was granted to both women and to all the society members that had been excluded from the institution in the past.&lt;ref name=imparcial &gt;{{harvnb|El Imparcial|25 de noviembre de 1944|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== After 1954 coup d'état ====
{{See also|Operation PBSUCCESS}}

Following its constitutional mandate, the university became involved in the political life of the country, presenting concrete social, economic and political proposals.  However, with the beginning of the [[Cold War]] between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] -major super powers that split world dominance after their victory in [[World War II]], the [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'état]], the [[Cuban Revolution]] in 1959 and the influx of students from all over the social spectrum in Guatemala, Marxism became radical in the University. Besides, then archbishop of Guatemala [[Mariano Rossell y Arellano]] found out that it was urgent to recover some of the former influence [[Catholic Church]] used to have, and that it lost during the liberal regime of [[Justo Rufino Barrios]] in 1872, and therefore decided to work with the [[United Fruit Company]] to get rid of the Revolutionary governments whom he accused of [[atheist]] and [[communist]]. On 4 April 1954, Rossell y Arellano issued an open letter in which he denounced Communism advances in the country, and begged Guatemalans to rise in arms and fight against the common enemy of God and the Land. His letter has published all over Guatemala, and even though he kept claiming that the Catholic Church was not seeking privileges in its anticommunist quest, Rossel y Arellano was able that after the 1954 coup, new president colonel [[Carlos Castillo Armas]] included the following back in the new Constitution of Guatemala, for the first time since 1872:&lt;ref name=esquipulas /&gt;
* that the Catholic Church had the right to own real estate and other properties
* that religious education was declared of public interest
* that the State supported religious education
* that there were independent private universities not connected with University of San Carlos.&lt;ref name=esquipulas&gt;{{cite web|author=Esquipulas en línea|url=http://www.esquipulas.com.gt/biografias/monsenor-mariano-rossell-y-arellano/|website=Esquipulas en línea|title=Biografia de Mariano Rossell Arellano|accessdate=1 September 2014|date=n.d.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220213329/http://www.esquipulas.com.gt/biografias/monsenor-mariano-rossell-y-arellano/|archivedate=20 December 2013|language=Spanish|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This way, the Catholic Church recover some of the former power it held before 1871, when the Liberal Reform confiscated its properties and cancelled its privileges, in a direct attack against it as the main conservative party member of the time.

==== Nottebohm case and the Dean of the College of Law ====
{{Main article|Nottebohm case}}

[[File:Adolfo Molina Orantes 005.jpg|thumb|200px|Doctor in Law [[:es:Adolfo Molina Orantes|Adolfo Molina Orantes]], College of Law Dean and legal advisor of the Guatemalan delegates for the [[Nottebohm case]] before the [[International Court of Justice]].]]

Between 1951 and 1955, College of Law dean, Dr. [[:es:Adolfo Molina Orantes|Adolfo Molina Orantes]], worked as a legal advisor for the Guatemalan delegation before the [[International Court of Justice]] of [[The Hague]] for the [[Nottebohm case]] (Liechtenstein v. Guatemala) [1955].  The case about Mr. Nottebohm, who was born 16 September 16, 1881, in Hamburg, [[Germany]] and possessed German citizenship although he lived in Guatemala from 1905 until 1943 because he never became a citizen of Guatemala. On October 9, 1939, Nottebohm applied to become a naturalized citizen of Liechtenstein. The application was approved and he became a citizen of that country. He then returned to Guatemala on his Liechtenstein passport and informed the local government of his change of nationality. When he tried to return to Guatemala once again in 1943 he was refused entry as an enemy alien since the Guatemalan authorities did not recognize his naturalization and regarded him as still German. It has been suggested that the timing of the event was due to the recent entry of the United States and Guatemala into the Second World War. He was later extradited to the United States, where he was held at an internment camp until the end of the war. All his possessions in Guatemala were confiscated. After his release, he lived out the rest of his life in Liechtenstein.&lt;ref name=icj/&gt;

The Government of Liechtenstein granted Nottebohm protection against unjust treatment by the government of Guatemala and petitioned the International Court of Justice. However, the government of Guatemala argued that Nottebohm did not gain Liechtenstein citizenship for the purposes of international law. The court agreed and thus stopped the case from continuing.
&lt;ref name=icj&gt;{{harvnb|International Court of Justice|1955|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nottebohm case was subsequently cited in many definitions of [[nationality]]. and Dr. Molina Orantes was recognized as an expert in international Law and named permanent consultant of the International Court.

==== Private universities ====

As a result of the political climate changes after the coup of 1954, the society elites decided to create their own private universities,&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;[[Universidad Rafael Landívar]] in 1961, [[Universidad del Valle de Guatemala]] in 1966, [[Universidad Francisco Marroquín]] in 1971, and so on.&lt;/ref&gt; which would have very different ideologies from the ones presented in the University of San Carlos.  Basically the new institutions would have capitalist and liberal ideologies while the national university chose Marxism.  After heavy lobbying, in 1965 the new ISR tax law exonerated potential private universities from any kind of taxation and state contributions, and in 1966 the Law of Private Universities was approved.{{sfn|Molina|2011|p=}}

In 1957 the highly regarded Marxist historian [[:es:Severo Martínez Peláez]] return to Guatemala after his exile and joined the University as a faculty member. The College of Economics dean, Rafael Piedrasanta Arandi, and the university president, Edmundo Vásquez Martínez, approved a scholarship for Martinez Pelaez to research the [[Archivo General de Indias]] in [[Sevilla]], [[Spain]] between 1967 and 1969. From this research comes his main work, ''La patria del criollo'', published in 1970, as well as the program of Economic History of Central America of the College of Economics and the total reform of the School of History in 1978.{{sfn|Centro de Estudios Urbanos y Regionales (USAC)|1998|p=4}}

In 1979, due to death threats from the general [[Fernando Romeo Lucas García]] regime, Martínez Peláez had to go into exile once again with his family and continued with his research and teaching activities in the [[Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla]] in [[Mexico]], where he was an invited speaker in several seminars and created new curricula for the College of History.  Besides, he had important meetings with historians and Guatemalan exiles in Mexico.{{sfn|Centro de Estudios Urbanos y Regionales (USAC)|1998|p=15}}

==== Veterinary medicine ====

The College of Veterinary was created on 27 September 1957,&lt;ref name="Man"&gt;{{harvnb|Facultad de Veterinaria y Zootenica|s.f.|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and initially was part of the College of Medicine and was located in the old Medicine Building in Guatemala City Historical Downtown. In 1958 and 1959 it moved into private homes that the university rented &lt;ref name="Man"/&gt; in zones 9 and 4 of Guatemala City;  it also used the University's Botanic Garden library in zone 4. By 1960, the College of Veterinary moved into its definite home in the main University campus.&lt;ref name="Man"/&gt;

On 11 January 1969 the School of Animal Studies, which was independent of the School of Veterinary medicine.&lt;ref name="Man"/&gt; and on 27 September 1974 it moved into the new modular buildings on the southwest section of the main campus, next to the Veterinary Medicine Hospital.&lt;ref name="Man"/&gt;

===Repression and decline ===
{{Main article|Guatemala Civil War}}

During general [[Miguel Ydígoras Fuentes]] presidency, the university started suffering repression due to its position alongside the main labor unions, with three students murdered in front of the College of Law in 1962.

==== The EXMIBAL Case====
During the government of [[Julio César Méndez Montenegro]] the possibility of giving the nickel mines in [[Izabal Department|Izabal]] in concession to a Canadian mining company was brought to the table, but it did not materialized. As soon as the general [[Carlos Arana Osorio]] took office on 1 July 1970, he reopened the case and began working in for EXMIBAL to get a concession. However, many social sectors opposed to it, arguing that it would be too costly for the country. One of the main opponents was the Commission that the [[University of San Carlos]] created to discuss the matter; among the members of the commission was the lawyer [[:es:Oscar Adolfo Mijangos López|Oscar Adolfo Mijangos López]], then representative in the [[Congress of Guatemala|Congress]], the respected Guatemalan intellectual [[:es:Alfonso Bauer Paiz|Alfonso Bauer Paiz]] -who had been part of the staff of presidents [[Juan José Arévalo Bermejo]] and [[Jacobo Arbenz Guzman]], and Julio Carney Herrera&lt;ref name=arzobispado/&gt;  Both Camey Herrera and Bauer Paiz were shot in November 1970: Carney died of his wounds while Bauer Paz, severely wounded, had to go into exile.&lt;ref name=rakosy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minesandcommunities.org/article.php?a=7057|website=MAC: Mines and communities|title=Victimization - the EXMIBAL Story|last=Rakosy|first=Betsy|year=2002|accessdate=17 September 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006082651/http://www.minesandcommunities.org/article.php?a=7057|archivedate=6 October 2014|language=Spanish|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commission members had strongly opposed the conditions proposed by the Government to grant the concession EXMIBAL; after the attack against Bauer Paiz and Carney, on 13 February 1971 Mijangos López was assassinated by unknown assailants as he left his office long the 4th Avenue in Zone 1 of the [[Guatemala City]]. Mijangos Lopez had been under the fatal impression that the government was not going to assassinate him because he was on a wheelchair since 1958.&lt;ref name=arzobispado/&gt;

On 8 May 1971, Arana Osorio's administration finally granted the concession to EXMIBAL;&lt;ref name=arzobispado/&gt; it covered 385 square kilometers in the area of [[El Estor]], with and initial investment of US$228 million. The mine, built in the mountains of indigenous maya Q'eqchi people, included a residential complex of 700 homes, numerous offices, a hospital, a small shopping center, school, a golf course and a large area for industrial processing.&lt;ref name=rakosy/&gt;

==== Laugerud and Lucas García military governments====
{{Main article|Kjell Eugenio Laugerud García|Fernando Romeo Lucas García|Guatemalan Civil War}}

During the military governments of the seventies, the tension between the government and the university kept growing, until it reached its peak in 1978 during the massive demonstration that occurred to protest rising urban public transportation costs. The Association of University Students (AEU) had a leading role in the protests, but this brought persecution of their leaders and the murder of the secretary general of the association [[Oliverio Castañeda de León]], on 20 October of that year.  Just fifteen days after the murder of Castañeda de León, was missing his successor, Antonio Ciani García, and over the next 18 months almost every student leader and university faculty with political connections were threatened (even with the legal parties). Whoever did not paid attention and continued with their protest activities, was simply killed or kidnapped.

In early 1979, the following attacks occurred against renowned members of the University:
* On 25 January 1979,  [[Alberto Fuentes Mohr]], Doctor of Economics, [[Congress of Guatemala|Congress]] representative, leader of the Social Democratic Party (PSD) and former Minister of Finance and Foreign Affairs during the administration of [[Julio César Méndez Montenegro]], was murdered.
* That same day, but a few hours later, was shot and killed the student and union leader Ricardo Martinez Solorzano.
* On 14 February, Manuel Lisandro Andrade Roca, general secretary of the University in the tenure of [[Saúl Osorio Paz]] as university president -and a student leader during the "Marches of 1962"- was killed.
* On 22 March, former Guatemala City mayor [[Manuel Colom Argueta]] was killed, in an operation in which his murderers allegedly used a helicopter to direct the operation&lt;ref name=Aguilera&gt;{{harvnb|Aguilera Peralta|Romero Imery|1981|pp=135–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Colom had been director of Center for Urban and Regional Studies (CEUR) of the University of San Carlos of Guatemala and a political leader of the United Revolutionary Front (FUR). Next to Fuentes Mohr, he was the most prominent members of the legal political opposition and their deaths ended, even more, the political space in Guatemala. These murders and threats against leaders of the FUR and the PSD continued in 1979 and 1980, and in subsequent years against the [[Guatemalan Christian Democracy]] party.
At the University, university president [[Saúl Osorio Paz]], after attacks on his colleagues and death threats against him, began to live in presidency, protected by student brigades of the communist FRENTE student party. In an unprecedented case, the president directed the University from underground for almost two years.&lt;ref name=Aguilera/&gt;

The effect of state repression was worse on the student movement: the AEU ended decimated. Despite all this, the association continued to be a belligerent organization during this campaign of terror. To protect themselves, the AEU restructured its organizational form such that their leaders were not so vulnerable, and declined to reveal their names.

In January 1979, a new freshmen generation arrived to the university. Many of them had been members of the CEEM or student associations in the public institutes and had participated in the events of October 1978. It was them who took the leadership of the AEU. But it was much more difficult to replace the fallen or exiled faculty, which resulted in a marked decline in the academic quality of the institution.&lt;ref name=comisionaguda/&gt; Later, laws that severely restricted the university autonomy were proposed, and violating the constitutional mandate to give 5% of the national budget to the institution became commonplace for the government.&lt;ref name=comisionaguda&gt;{{harvnb|Comisión para el Esclarecimiento Histórico: Agudización|1999|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Burning the Spain Embassy in Guatemala ====
{{See also|Guatemalan Civil War}}

On 31 January 1980, several students from the University of San Carlos advised a k'iche' peasant group who wanted to let the world know about their precarious situation; when  the country's newspapers did not dare to publish their demands, and after all legal avenues to be heard had been exhausted, the group decided to take the premises of the Embassy of Spain and use it as a platform for their demands.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Ambassador [[Máximo Cajal López]] had visited the k'iche' farmer communities a few months before, and had gathered information for a report on them, which was never published, but the draft of which still exists.&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction of the government of general [[Fernando Romeo Lucas Garcia]] was strong and direct: police surrounded the premises of the Embassy and after several hours of siege, the situation ended with the burning of the room where all the people who were inside the embassy had taken refugre, including almost the entire Embassy staff and some random visitors, including former vice president of Guatemala, [[Eduardo Cáceres Lehnhoff]] and former Foreign Affairs Minister, [[Adolfo Molina Orantes]].&lt;ref name=niunovivo&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watchv=FG6fh9M8wdc |title = Ni uno vivo|website=YouTube|accessdate = July 2, 2014|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only two survivors were Ambassador [[Máximo Cajal López]] and peasant Gregorio Yuja Xona, who were taken to the Private Hospital Herrera Llerandi. Yuja was kidnapped there and a group tried to kidnap the ambassador, but he was taken from the hospital just in time by the Ambassador of Costa Rica in Guatemala; Cajal left the country that night. Yuja, meanwhile, was tortured and his body thrown off the premises of the President mansion at the University of San Carlos. His body was buried in the Heroes and Martyrs Plaza on Central Campus.&lt;ref name=niunovivo /&gt;

==== 1985 civil unrest: military invasion of Central Campus ====
{{Main article|Óscar Humberto Mejía Victores}}

During the government of general [[Óscar Humberto Mejía Victores]], the Mutual Support Group (GAM) -led by [[Nineth Montenegro]]- was founded{{sfn|Siglo 21|9 July 2010|p=}} and the High School Student Coordination Group (CEEM) also gained considerable strength. The latter was formed by students from the Central National Institute for Boys, the Central Normal Institute for Young Ladies Belén and Rafael Aqueche&lt;ref group = lower-alpha&gt;By 1985, the economic elites had left Guatemala City downtown, along with these once premier schools which now were attended by the low middle and low income areas of the city.&lt;/ref&gt;  which organized mass protests in September 1985 against the rising prices for public transportation. At least ten people died in Guatemala City in the most extensive wave of urban unrest since protests against the government of [[Fernando Romeo Lucas Garcia]] in August 1978. The unrest began with demonstrations against rising prices public transportation but then became widespread due to the bad economic situation the country was in at the time. Burning of buses, blockades and massive protests that resulted in destruction of public infrastructure occurred almost every day. The government responded with three thousand Army soldiers, whom supported by light armored forces and the riot squad of the National Police, were deployed in central and peripheral areas of the city. Also, the night of 3 September 1985 the University of San Carlos of Guatemala was occupied by the military who allegedly found an underground shooting range subversive propaganda.&lt;ref name=elpais85/&gt;

Several hundred people were arrested and General Mejia Víctores addressed the nation through a television and radio address in which he announced measures to address prevailing social unrest. General Mejia announced public schools closure until further notice and the freezing of prices of consumer goods;&lt;ref name=elpais85&gt;{{harvnb|El País|1985|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the end, as part of the process solution a high school student bonus was granted to both elementary and high schools so they could be transported free in public transportation, plus all the public school students were promoted by decree. Students who graduated by decree in 1985 were received with brutal initiations by the different student bodies through the University.&lt;ref name=elpais85/&gt;

==== Constitution of 1985: Election of judges and university representatives before government institutions====

{{Quote box|align=right|width=400px|Article 215. Election of the Supreme Court&lt;br/&gt;.

|Constitution of the Republic of Guatemala, 1985.{{sfn|Dighero Herrera|2002|p=169}}}}

After the murder or forced exile of most of its faculty, the stability of the College of Law after the [[Guatemalan Civil War]] was recovered with deanship of Cipriano Soto Tobar, who took office in 1988. Soto Tobar took a significant effort on hiring faculty. However, his main goal was to establishg political networks to favor political lobbies exploiting the new role that the Constitution assigned to the University of San Carlos:&lt;ref name=veliz&gt;{{cite web|last=Véliz|first=Rodrigo|url=https://nomada.gt/que-hicieron-los-profesores-de-derecho-para-que-la-usac-perdiera-prestigio/|title=¿Qué hizo Derecho para que la USAC perdiera prestigio?|year=2014|location=Guatemala|website=Nómada|language=Spanish|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; which, enacted in 1985, entrusted the College of Law and the University of San Carlos with the task of naming representatives to the process of election of judges of the highest courts of the land,{{sfn|Dighero Herrera|2002|pp=169-170}} as well as the Comptroller General of Accounts,{{sfn|Dighero Herrera|2002|pp=180-181}} and the Chief Public Prosecutor {{sfn|Dighero Herrera|2002|p=197}} Also, the University was given the power to send a judge to the Constitutionality Court.{{sfn|Dighero Herrera|2002|p=214}}

These networks took hold and strengthened thru the nineties setting up relationships with institutions and society sectors that were not associated as a university. After leaving the deanship, the University Council nominated Soto to the Constitutionality Court, although there were persistent rumors that he was selling diplomas and certificates. However, his application was accepted because his involvement in these felonies could not be proved because no credible evidence was presented.{{sfn|Hernández Pico|2001|p =}} Two of his performances in the Constitutionality Court showed possible political compromise: first, he voted to validate an illegal adoption network and, then he voted in favor of the registration as a presidential candidate of general [[Efraín Ríos Montt]], despite the prohibition of the 1985 Constitution, which does not allowed as a candidate anybody that had been part of a coup d'état.{{sfn|Castillo Zamora|2013|p=}} In those years, adoption networks operating in Guatemala could collect up to US$60,000 per child and went from delivering 1200 children in 1997 to more than four thousand in 2004.&lt;ref name=veliz/&gt;

Estuardo Galvez, who took that Dean office in 2000 -and later went on to become university president, was one of the members of the networks established by Soto; realizing the importance of the Bar Association, which was also a participant in the election of judges -and until then controlled by lawyers linked to the traditional capital of the country- Galvez sought from the beginning of his term to favor his post graduate students placing them in public institutions so that they could show their loyalty with favorable votes in the Bar elections.&lt;ref name=veliz/&gt; After several elections, and once Galvez was no longer Dean, the network that Soto set up beat the traditional capital lawyers in the Bar Association elections by 300 votes; as recorded in the minutes, the majority of his votes were young lawyers -his former students.&lt;ref name=veliz/&gt;

==== Student leaders murders in 1989====

In 1987, the president of the Student Association "El Derecho" (AED), Willy Ligorría, was expelled from the Association of University Students (AEU) for embezzling funds from the [[Huelga de Dolores]] Committee, for his direct involvement in an embezzlement money of the association and usurpation of functions and for signing as acting as General Secretary in various activities and international documents.&lt;ref name=rehmi89/&gt; After his departure, a series of death threats against members of the board of the AEU began: in 1989 there was a steady escalation of threats, some of them signed by death squads as "the Dolorosa", the "Jaguar of Justice" or "Secret Anticommunist-Army". Despite his expulsion, Ligorría, maintained a very high and combative profile, while his close friend, Marco Tulio Montenegro, was still part of AEU.&lt;ref name=rehmi89&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.derechoshumanos.net/lesahumanidad/informes/guatemala/informeREMHI-Tomo2.htm#t2c3-m20|author=Informe REMHI|journal=Fundación Acción Pro-Derechos Humanos|title=Proyecto Interdiocesano de Recuperación de la Memoria Histórica |year=n.d.|accessdate=23 October 2013|language=Spanish|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, several student body leaders returned to Guatemala from exile intending to achieve a resurgence of student coordination, which was practically dismantled since the seventies. But on August 21, Iván Ernesto Gonzalez was arrested and kinapped; the next day, Carlos Contreras Conde, leader of the University Student Movement (MEU), was abducted near the university. That same day Hugo Leonel Gramajo was abducted and introduced in a red pick-up with foreign plates. On 23 August, Victor Hugo Rodriguez Jaramillo and Silvia Azurdia Utrera founders of MEU, were kidnapped and taken violenty amid two cars that blocked their way. And Mario De León left a press conference that the Student Body held that day at around 19:45 hours and was detained by the National Police and has not been seen again since.&lt;ref name=rehmi89/&gt; Finally, Aaron Ochoa disappeared the next day.

During an emergency meeting in which the response to the government offensive was being discussed, Willy Ligorría called to say that he knew where Hugo Gramajo and Aaron Ochoa were hidden and that he could bring the still free student leaders to them. In September other members of the student movement, Carlos Chutá Carney, Carlos Humberto Cabrera and Carlos Palencia were kidnapped and found dead shortly afterwards.&lt;ref name=rehmi89/&gt;

After the murders of the student leaders, Ligorría spoke at some rallies in college and participated in the demonstrations that took place.  On Saturday September 15 at 14:15 hours he left for Panamá along with Marco Tulio Montenegro and Byron Milian Vicente. Montenegro returned to Guatemala on 11 November 1989 to rejoin the AEU, but he was already a suspect, and was killed with knife soon after. Meanwhile, Ligorría was appointed Head of Research of Public Prosecutions.&lt;ref name=rehmi89/&gt;&lt;ref group = lower-alpha&gt;According to research that was subsequently conducted, it was determined that Ligorría had strong ties with a "gang" of zone 18, whose members went armed at all times; College students suspected that the "maras" had been formed by the army. Ligorría was also affiliated with the Democratic Socialist Party (PSD) and even wasted money in their university activities, although he always maintained a revolutionary speech, was a member of ORPA and maintained contact with Danilo Rodriguez, chief of the FAR.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 12, 1997, the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity, which became a political party after the peace accords, formally accused Ligorría for his involvement in the murder of the student leader, claiming that he was a member of military intelligence.

[[File:Yamashina Institute for Ornithology.JPG|right|thumb|300px|The Yamashina Institute for Ornithology]]
The {{nihongo|'''Yamashina Institute for Ornithology'''|山階鳥類研究所 |Yamashina Chōruikenkyūsho}} is a [[Foundation (nonprofit organization)|non-profit scientific research organization]] in [[Japan]], specializing in [[ornithology]] studies.

==History==
The Yamashina Institute for Ornithology was founded by Dr. [[Yoshimaro Yamashina]] at his home in [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]], [[Tokyo]] as a private museum to store his collection of bird specimens and books. [[Marquis]] Yamashina was the second son of [[Prince Yamashina Kikumaro]]. He opened his museum to the public in 1942. At the Institute, Yamashina conducted research into bird [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] based on [[chromosomes]], and wrote numerous technical journal articles and books on ornithology.

The Institute relocated to its present location approximately 30 kilometer east of Tokyo at [[Abiko, Chiba]] in 1984. The Institute has maintained close ties to the [[Imperial Family of Japan]]. It is chaired by HIH [[Prince Akishino]], younger brother to the [[Naruhito, Crown Prince of Japan|Crown Prince Naruhito]] of Japan, and their younger sister [[Sayako Kuroda|Princess Sayako]] worked as a researcher at the Institute from 1992-2005, where she specialized in the study of [[kingfishers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article589235.ece] ''The Times'', Nov 12 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The Institute is organized into three research sections:

*The '''Ornithology Research Laboratory''' specializes in the [[ecology]] and systematics of birds, including foraging patterns of marine birds and genetic variations of bird populations, mainly using [[DNA sequencing]].
*The '''Bird Migration Research Center''' conducts [[bird banding]] campaigns, tagging more than 200,000 birds each year. It also experiments with [[radio telemetry]], radar and satellite tracking to investigate [[bird migration|migratory patterns]].
*The '''Library and Collection Center''' maintains a collection of 69,000 different avian specimens from all over the world, especially from eastern Asia and the north-western Pacific regions and a library of 39,000 ornithological books and periodicals.

==Publications and events==
The Yamashina Institute publishes several journals and reports, including the ''Journal of the Yamashina Institute for Ornithology'', the annual ''Report of the Bird Migration Research Center'' and a monthly newspaper for support group members.

The Institute also sponsors a biannual ''Yamashina Yoshimaro Memorial Ornithological Award'' to an individual or group who has made remarkable contributions to the development ornithology or the protection of birds.
