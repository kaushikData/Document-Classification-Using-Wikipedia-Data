The '''A299''', better known as the '''Thanet Way''', is a major road in the county of [[Kent]], England, and runs from Brenley Corner near [[Faversham]] (where it merges into the [[M2 motorway (Great Britain)|M2]]) to [[Ramsgate]] via [[Whitstable]] and [[Herne Bay, Kent|Herne Bay]]. It is predominantly used for [[freight]] traffic to [[Port of Ramsgate|Ramsgate Harbour]] and local traffic to [[Isle of Thanet|Thanet]],&lt;ref name="kcc"/&gt; and is {{convert|22|mi}} long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?saddr=51.334526,1.389384&amp;daddr=Thanet+Way%2FA299&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=51.315593,0.979843&amp;spn=0.240766,0.616608&amp;sll=51.30387,0.928345&amp;sspn=0.007526,0.019269&amp;geocode=FX5NDwMdSDMVAA%3BFb3VDgMdWSoOAA&amp;t=h&amp;mra=ls&amp;z=11 |title=Directions to Thanet Way/A299 |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |work= |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also provides access to [[Manston Airport]].

==History==
The A299 was originally allocated to the original road from Faversham to Herne Bay, via Graveney, Seasalter and Whitstable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/maps/index.php?view=51.35236,0.98824&amp;map=NPEMap&amp;zoom=7&amp;layer=9|title=Quarter Inch Map of Great Britain|publisher=[[Ordnance Survey]]|date=1930|accessdate=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the modern route was constructed in the early 1930s as an unemployment relief project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1931/feb/12/unemployment-1#S5CV0248P0_19310212_HOC_434|title=UNEMPLOYMENT : Captain Harold Balfour |publisher=Hansard |date=12 Feb 1931 |accessdate=24 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1930/jan/21/kent|title=Kent|publisher=Hansard|date=21 January 1930|accessdate=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this, all traffic from the west to the Isle of Thanet had to go via [[Canterbury]].

The A299 was upgraded between 1989 and 1997 to dual carriageway for almost its entire length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1994/may/09/a299|title=A99|publisher=Hansard|date=9 May 1994|accessdate=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kcc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1996/dec/04/kent-capital-challenge|title=Kent Capital Challenge|date=4 December 1996|publisher=Hansard|accessdate=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitstable and Herne Bay were bypassed, with the old road becoming the A2990, and the A299 to the west of Whitstable and east of Herne Bay received an online upgrade. 

The original Thanet Way project, and hence the A299, used to end near [[Monkton, Kent|Monkton]], where the A253 once continued to Ramsgate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/maps/index.php?view=51.36018,1.30289&amp;map=NPEMap&amp;zoom=7&amp;layer=1|title=1 Inch Seventh Series Map|publisher=[[Ordnance Survey]]|date=1960|accessdate=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This section of road has been renumbered as an extension of the A299 to [[Port of Ramsgate|Ramsgate Harbour]].  

The section from Minster roundabout to the Lord of the Manor roundabout was diverted on to a new dual carriageway during 2009-12, constructed as part of East Kent access phase 2 to provide better access to Manston Airport and the [[Pfizer]] complex at [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]]. It was opened by [[Norman Baker]] on 23 May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kent.gov.uk/roads_and_transport/highway_improvements/major_transport_schemes/current_schemes/east_kent_phase_2.aspx |title=East Kent Access Phase 2 |publisher=Kent County Council |date= |accessdate=13 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130311231554/http://kent.gov.uk/roads_and_transport/highway_improvements/major_transport_schemes/current_schemes/east_kent_phase_2.aspx |archivedate=11 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aladdin''' is a [[Impact crater|crater]] in the northern hemisphere of [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]].  Aladdin was first discovered in ''[[Voyager 2]]'' images.  It is located at 60.7° North [[Latitude]], 26.7° West [[Longitude]] and is 37.4 kilometers across.&lt;ref name="USGS"/&gt;  It is located near the craters [[Ali Baba (crater)|Ali Baba]] and [[Samad (crater)|Samad]].&lt;ref name="Se-2"/&gt;  Aladdin has a large dome in its interior, suggesting the crater has undergone some viscous relaxation.

[[Aladdin]] is named after a famous hero from ''[[Arabian Nights]]'' who finds a magic lamp.

'''Background-oriented schlieren''' ('''BOS''') is a novel technique for [[flow visualization]] of [[density]] [[gradients]] in [[fluids]] using the [[Gladstone–Dale relation]] between density and refractive index of the fluid.

BOS simplifies the visualization process by eliminating the need for the use of expensive [[mirror]]s, [[lasers]] and [[knife-edges]]. In its simplest form, BOS makes use of simple background patterns of the form of a randomly generated dot-pattern, an inexpensive [[strobe]] light source and a high speed [[digital camera]].

In its initial stages of implementation, it is mostly being used as a qualitative visualization method. Further research into developing the technique will enable quantitative visualization of fluid flows, in various applications including [[cryogenic]] flows, [[supersonic]] and [[hypersonic]] flows, [[biomedical]] device flow visualization etc.

Bright light sources such as the sun and moon can also be used to visualize shock wave patterns around aircraft, a technique named Background Oriented Schlieren using Celestial Objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/t-38c-passes-in-front-of-the-sun-at-supersonic-speed|title=Photographic Shockwave Research Reaches New Heights with BOSCO Flights|last=Kamlet|first=Matt|date=2016-04-13|website=NASA Website|publisher=|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bovine stool associated circular virus''''' is a single stranded DNA virus with a circular genome that was isolated from bovine stool.&lt;ref&gt;Kim HK, Park SJ, Nguyen VG, Song DS, Moon HJ, Kang BK, Park BK (2011) Identification of a novel single stranded circular DNA virus from bovine stool. J Gen Virol {{doi|10.1099/vir.0.037838-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Virology==

This virus was isolated from cows that appeared to be healthy. It has also been isolated from healthy pig stool.

==Genome==

The genome is a single stranded circular DNA molecule 2600 bases in length.  It has two [[open reading frame]]s encoding a [[replicase]] and [[capsid]] protein. The reading frames are arranged in opposite orientations on the genome. A stem loop is present between the 3' ends of the open reading frames. This is like [[chimpanzee stool associated circular virus]] and unlike any other known circular DNA virus.

==Taxonomy==

This virus appears to form a clade with the [[chimpanzee stool associated circular virus]]. Their relationship with other viruses is not yet known. The closest relations appear to be the ''[[Nanoviridae]]'' but further work is required to clarify this point.

'''Cognitive behavioral training''' (CBTraining), sometimes referred to as structured cognitive behavioral training, ('''SCBT''') is a regimented cognitive-behavioral process that uses a systematic, highly structured workshop-style approach to break down and replace dysfunctional emotionally dependent behaviors. The roots of CBTraining lie in [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT), and like CBT the basic premise of CBTraining is that behavior is inextricably related to beliefs, thoughts and emotions.  However, CBTraining is delivered in a highly structured, regimented format and combines several other [[behavioral change theories]] and methodologies in addition to CBT. Cognitive behavioral training is currently used primarily in the [[behavioral health]] industry and in [[criminal psychology]].

==Difference from CBT==
Although CBTraining employs some similar foundational concepts that define Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, there are some fundamental differences between CBTraining and CBT, both in philosophy and in application.
CBTraining is training, not therapy. This is a critical distinction: unlike typical forms and applications of CBT, CBTraining is a process that is absolutely finite. That is to say, when a person begins taking a structured cognitive behavioral training course or program, there is already in place a set schedule – and therefore a predetermined end date – to training. Among one other main difference is the goal for a change in  
In CBT, as with most therapy, the patient plays a large role in determining the direction of the therapy, including the intensity and duration. An CBTraining course, or program, is usually broken up into a series of progressive, strategically ordered sessions – each one with a particular focus. CBTraining unfolds step by step, guiding the participant through the process of retraining the brain and dissolving the emotionally dependent thinking. Participants of SCBT take "classes," are quizzed, and are given "[[Homework in psychotherapy|homework]]". Much of the homework in CBTraining is based on [[writing therapy]]; as people write their emotional experience, their sense of trauma and stress is diminished. CBTraining is not tailored to the individual, it is tailored to the specific dependency it addresses. Cognitive behavioral training aims to create rapid change in the "students," is given in some sort of group or class form, and is governed by a prearranged pathway to change.
Cognitive Behavioral Skills Training has been used to teach and firmly implant social behavioral modification in children. Here is a concise explanation of a main difference between cognitive behavioral therapy and cognitive behavioral skills training: "...cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on how beliefs affect mood...skills training focuses on practicing pragmatic skills of living..."&lt;ref&gt;Granholm, Eric PhD. [http://www.learningrx.com/cognitive-behavioral-skills-training-faq.htm "Cognitive Behavioral Skills Training"]&lt;/ref&gt; CBTraining aims for swift and permanent implantation of new skills in living.

==Description==
Cognitive behavioral training (CBTraining) is a cognitive-based process designed with the aim to systematically break down emotionally driven dependencies and behaviors, replacing them with behaviors that are based on [[rational choice]]. Like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), the philosophy of CBTraining is rooted to one essential notion: feeling and thought are inextricably linked.

CBTraining contends that in any emotionally dependent relationship, people make emotional decisions rather than rational choices. When an emotionally dependent relationship occurs, it creates a belief-induced emotional state. When someone is in this state, they are incapable of making rational choices for more than a short period of time due to an emotion-driven subconscious process that overrides their conscious mind. This phenomenon explains why an overeater cannot resist having another bite... and another... and another, despite the fact that they are not physically hungry and they know that overeating is unhealthy.

CBTraining was born out of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and utilizes well established theories of psychology and treatment, including: [[bibliotherapy]], [[acceptance and commitment therapy]], behavioral self-control theory, behavioral economic theory, [[self-determination theory]], and [[motivational interviewing]]. Each of these methods plays a role in CBTraining, at varying stages of completion, in the common endeavor to bring a new sense of cognizant awareness in the participant.

Cognitive Behavioral Training, applied in a structured way (CBTraining), has also been used to deal effectively with women dealing with the stressors of having breast cancer  (e.g., changing thoughts about stressors ) in studies done at the University of Miami.&lt;ref&gt;Science Daily: Gallagher, Annette [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/05/140516203346.htm "Cognitive behavioral or relaxation training helps women reduce distress during breast cancer treatment"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Willpower==
In addressing addictive behavior and other potentially destructive behavior compelling to the participant, CBTraining uses an approach of urge conditioning/desensitization. This approach stands in stark contrast to what is commonly most instinctive to people (urge avoidance), and seems counter-intuitive at first. The approach of urge desensitization has been applied to patients with gambling addictions, and research has shown it to be effective.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Psychiatry: Myongji Hospital, Goyang, Gyeonggi South Korea; Han C. Kim D. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24293014 "Desensitization of Triggers and Urge Reproducing for Pathological Gambling: A Case Series"]&lt;/ref&gt;
When a person is trying to quit smoking, for instance, the instinct is to remove all smoking paraphernalia from his presence. While this "out of sight, out of mind" approach seems to make sense, it does nothing to actually deal with the emotionally driven urge to smoke. CBTraining contends that, in fact, this white-knuckled method of willpower only lends the urge more power. With urge conditioning/desensitization, the participant is asked to actually create urges in order to become comfortable with having them. As the strategic format of CBTraining unfolds through the training, the urges are methodically stripped of their power. In acknowledging "urge", says CBTraining, you are actually acknowledging your power to choose.

Further distinguishing CBTraining from its closely related psychological predecessors is the inclusion of the concept of "Training" in place of "Therapy". CBTraining is a planned, intricately designed and systematically applied regimen that is purposely finite. CBTraining begins with a specific goal, and is constructed as a time-specific road map to achieving the goal. As a person undergoes the training, CBTraining aims to change not only this person's self-talk but his/her [[self-image]] at a subconscious level, so that the change in behavior is intrinsically motivated and willpower never really plays a part in it.

==History of development==

Along with CBT, CBTraining also owes some debt to [[Albert Ellis]]'s [[rational emotive behavior therapy]] (REBT), formerly known as Rational Emotive Therapy. REBT is classified as a form of CBT,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbtsearch.com/varying-forms-of-cbt/ |title=Different Types Of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy |accessdate=3 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is anchored by the belief that a person is "affected emotionally by his/her perspective and attitude about outside things." As with CBTraining, REBT incorporates Positive Self-Image Psychology.
Lou Ryan, a pioneer in the creation, development, and practical application of CBTraining, worked for some time under the guidance of Albert Ellis. In the early 1980s, Ryan, who was well-versed in Ellis's theories and philosophies, met Ellis in Hawaii after a series of seminars. Ellis recognized his own impact in Ryan's CBTraining programs, and played a peripheral part in some of the development.
According to Ryan when asked about the evolutional process of his particular philosophy: "I had collected a potpourri of different types of approaches, programs, and philosophies that I had come across through the years. To me, what seemed to be missing was vision. Vision for what people want from life is motivating but can often be lost in the daily trudge of life." About his time with Ellis, Ryan said: "I had met him at a conference in Hawaii. We met afterwards, and I told him what I was doing, that there were similarities between what we were doing. I asked him if he would review what I had put together, and for his input... he coached me on a few things. It occurred to me to add a structure to all of these philosophies."&lt;ref&gt;Live interview with Lou Ryan, San Diego CA, February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
Also involved in some of the early development of SCBT were John E. Martin&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.path4success.com/wp_PDF_files/BioJohnMartin.pdf Martin, Dr. John E]&lt;/ref&gt; and Scott T. Waters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Scott_Walters/ Walters, Dr. Scott T]&lt;/ref&gt; In a written critical evaluation of SCBT] is the strategic and effective use of techniques that exclusively target people who are ready to change now." They went on to say, in the same report, "...the rigidity of language and pacing might result in negative feelings towards a Training that gives so little choice itself."&lt;ref&gt;Martin, John E. PhD; Walters, Scott T. PhD."Evaluation of SelfHelpWorks Lifestyle Intervention Site: A Three Tiered Critical Analysis" August, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific applications==

CBT has been used most notably in two different spectrums: health and wellness, and criminal psychology (with the intention to minimize recidivism).

===Health and wellness===

CBTraining has been established to some degree in changing emotionally addictive behaviors related to tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;John Martin, Ph.D;David M. Young [http://operationsmokefree.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/OSF-Case-Studies.pdf "Comparison of American Cancer Society versus Internet Based treatment for Smokers"] February 2003 San Diego State University Graduate Research&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Wooley, M.D.;John Whitlock, Ph.D [http://operationsmokefree.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/OSF-Case-Studies.pdf "Case Study #1 St. Lukes Hospital and Medical Center"] San Antonio TX, February 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  There is evidence that cognitive group behavioral training may be beneficial for patients with type 1 diabetes in their self-care.&lt;ref&gt;Diabetes Research Group [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15721974 "Cognitive Behavioral Group Training for Patients with Type 1 Diabetes"] March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; SCBT has been used to help people with diabetes manage their disease, with the primary goal being maintained lifestyle changes to slow or halt the progression of the disease. San Diego based SelfHelpWorks Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.selfhelpworks.com/corporate/scbt.aspx "SelfHelpWorks"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416175544/http://www.selfhelpworks.com/corporate/scbt.aspx |date=2014-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has incorporated SCBT as a core component of its behavioral training courses for smoking cessation, alcohol management, weight management, diabetes management, and stress management. Case studies&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.selfhelpworks.com/corporate/science.aspx "Case Study: 390 Corporate Employees""Health Risk Assessment (HRA) Comparison"]&lt;/ref&gt; within the American workplace indicate the efficacy of CBTraining, however as of yet academic studies in this promising area are still relatively sparse.
Cognitive Behavioral Training has been used, combined with diet and exercise to reduce body weight and raise physical capacity in health care workers.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, J.R.; Faber, Anne; Ekner, Dorte; Overgaard, Kristian; Holtermann, Andreas; Sogaard, Karen [http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/11/671 "Diet, physical exercise and cognitive behavioral training as a combined workplace based intervention to reduce body weight and increase physical capacity in health care workers - a randomized controlled trial."]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Addiction===

CBTraining has been perhaps most documented in its efficacy with addiction-related issues that involve substances such as food, alcohol and tobacco. Since the philosophy of CBTraining is that feeling is related to thought, and thought can lead to belief, it assumes that addiction in itself is at least partially dependent on the continued dysfunctional and oft-practiced thoughts and beliefs of the addict. Much of CBTraining is the encouragement to expand your "comfort zone" until the discomfort of physical withdrawal is no longer bothersome. For instance, when seasoned smokers decide to quit on their own, they typically consider it a matter of willpower, following the natural instinct to avoid cigarettes and "white knuckle" it. By contrast, CBTraining focuses on the cognitive aspects. It systematically applies a combination of techniques that makes the smoker consciously aware of the urge to smoke, explains the emotionally charged thought process that is really causing the urges, and brings the smoker to the point of purposefully creating urges while choosing the benefits of not smoking over the consequences of smoking in a way that no longer causes discomfort.

===Stress and anxiety===

SCBT contends that high levels of stress and anxiety are the practiced, subconscious choice of the mind. If stress is a feeling related to thought, and if thinking thoughts that produce stress is an unconscious habit, then this unconscious habit must first be made conscious to the patient. Once this is accomplished, the power to change thought, and hence feeling, is feasible.
In a nine-week "brief structured cognitive behavioral intervention" designed for family caregivers for persons diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]], there was a reduction in stress and anxiety – "Moreover, these reductions in anxiety were maintained through a six-week follow-up period..."&lt;ref&gt;Rhonda L. Akkerman, Phd. [http://www.rosalynncarter.org/caregiver_intervention_database/dimentia/brief_structured_cognitive_behavioral_therapy/ "Brief Structured Cognitive Behavioral Therapy"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disease management===

SCBT has been used in helping diabetics manage their disease. Since [[diabetes]] is a disease that needs to be managed to a large degree by the patient himself/herself, much is dependent on the patient's lifestyle. In addition to producing a shift in mindset from living like a victim to living normally, SCBT has been used to help change pre-existing aversions to healthy living that are known to exacerbate the diabetic condition or, in the case of [[type 2 diabetes]], may even have brought it on in the first place.

In all areas CBTraining is applied to, there is maintained a key concept that when one is constantly aware of the power to choose, one will not be vulnerable to feelings of deprivation.

===In adolescents with behavior disorders===

A training program was developed and applied with the specific aim to increase self-control and reduce aggression in young people.&lt;ref&gt;Etscheidt, S.[http://www.childtrends.org/?programs=cognitive-behavioral-training-program-for-behaviorally-disordered-adolescents] "Reducing Aggressive Behavior and Improving Self-Control: A Cognitive-Behavioral Training Program for Behaviorally Disordered Adolescents."&lt;/ref&gt; Students were divided into six classes, with five students comprising each class.

There was also a study regarding the effectiveness of CBTraining in hyperactive boys in anger-inducing situations &lt;ref&gt;Hinshaw, S.P.; Henker, B; Whalen, C.K. [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00913461 "Self-control in hyperactive boys in anger-inducing situations: Effects of cognitive-behavioral training and of methylphenidate"] Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology March 1984, Volume 12, Issue 1, pp 55–77 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00913461&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Criminal behavior===

Cognitive-behavioral programs developed for criminal offenders tend to focus on either [[cognitive deficits]] or [[cognitive distortions]]. Numerous studies have been conducted in correctional settings testing the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral techniques at reducing recidivism. Highly individualized one-on-one cognitive-behavioral therapy, provided by clinical psychologists or other mental health workers, is simply not practical on a large scale within our prison system. Therefore cognitive-behavioral therapies in correctional settings consist of highly structured treatments that are typically delivered to groups of 8 to 12 individuals in classroom-like settings.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, David B.; Bouffard, Leana Allen; Mackenzie, Doris L. [http://cjb.sagepub.com/content/32/2/172.short "A Quantitative Review of Structured, Group-Oriented, Cognitive-Behavioral Programs for Offenders"] Criminal Justice and Behavior April 2005 vol. 32 no. 2 172-204 http://cjb.sagepub.com/content/32/2/172.short)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of access==

===In group/in person===
In the use of structured cognitive programs for convicted criminals to reduce [[recidivism]], the method was in person, and in group form.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, David B.; Bouffard, Leana Allen; Mackenzie, Doris L. [http://cjb.sagepub.com/content/32/2/172.short "A Quantitative Review of Structured, Group-Oriented, Cognitive-Behavioral Programs for Offenders"] Criminal Justice and Behavior April 2005 vol. 32 no. 2 172-204) http://cjb.sagepub.com/content/32/2/172.short)&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence that, when targeting this particular issue, SCBT has been used in any other format to date.

==Criticisms==
Although studies have been limited, initial data indicates that success with SCBT is largely dependent on the active, cooperative participation of the patient. The number one factor in inefficacy is failure to complete the training.
This essentially means that CBTraining, as it is presented in internet form, is geared towards participants who, in relation to the stages-of-change theory, are in the preparation and action stages.&lt;ref&gt;Gold, Mark S. MD [http://psychcentral.com/lib/stages-of-change/000265 "Stages of Change"] Psyche Central&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, CBTraining will be most effective when applied to people with a high motivation to change. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is an indicator of limitations. Simply put, SCBT is not likely to be effective treatment in someone who has no intention to change.

'''Critical security studies''' is an [[academic discipline]] within [[security studies]] which rejects mainstream approaches to security

==Definition==
Some use the term critical security studies to refer to all approaches that are critical of mainstream/orthodox realist approaches. Others see critical security studies as a distinct approach in its own right committed to emancipatory theory.&lt;ref&gt; Williams, Paul (2005) 'Critical Security Studies' in ''International Society and Its Critics'', A. Bellamy (ed.), Oxford: Oxford University Press, P. 135&lt;/ref&gt; Those representing the latter view are usually referred to as the [[Welsh School (security studies)]].

'''David Hungerford Ashton''' [[Order of Australia|OAM]] (6 July 1927 – 22 November 2005) was an Australian [[botanist]] and [[ecologist]].  He was the world expert on ''[[Eucalyptus regnans]]'' forests, claimed to be the most important timber species in Australia.

Ashton was born in [[Melbourne]].  He received his [[Bachelor of Science]] in 1949, and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in 1957.  He taught for thirty years at the [[University of Melbourne]], from 1962 to 1992, influencing several generations of [[Victoria, Australia|Victorian]] botanists and foresters. His professional expertise ranged from [[angiosperms]], [[pteridophyte]]s, [[bryophyte]]s, [[lichen]]s and [[fungi]].  He was also able to synthesise many biological problems ecologically, especially in [[Eucalyptus regnans|Mountain Ash]] forests including geology, plant and animal species interactions, the effects of fire and climate, insect and seed dispersal. He wrote more than 200 scientific articles in over 20 publications.

Since 2000, 'The David Ashton Biodiversity and Ecosystems Award' has been awarded annually for the best Victorian ecological research.

He was awarded the [[Order of Australia|Medal of the Order of Australia]] in 2001, "For service to the science of plant ecology, particularly in the areas of forest regeneration, conservation and management." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.science.unimelb.edu.au/community/achievers/ science.unimelb.edu.au/community/achievers/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051105012803/http://www.science.unimelb.edu.au/community/achievers/ |date=2005-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6637">'''David Lloyd Jones''' (born 1944) is an [[Australians|Australian]] horticultural botanist and the author of a large number of books and papers, especially on Australian orchids.&lt;ref name="ANBG"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jones, David Lloyd (1944 - )|url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/biography/jones-david-lloyd.html|publisher=Australian National Botanic Gardens|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ANBG(2)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cross|first1=Rob|last2=Spencer|first2=Roger|title=Face behind the names|url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/biography/PDF-articles/Jones-David-L-Australian-Horticulture-April-2011.pdf|publisher=Australian National Botanic Gardens|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones was born in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and in his youth, was a student at  [[Burnley College (Australia)|Burnley Horticultural College]], then the [[University of Melbourne]], graduating with the degree of [[Bachelor of Science in Agriculture]]. He was employed for 14 years by the Victorian [[Department of Environment and Primary Industries (Victoria)|Department of Agriculture]] where he helped develop programs involving the nutrient requirements of Australian native plants. He later owned several commercial [[Plant nursery|nurseries]] and in 1972 his first description of an orchid, ''[[Pterostylis aestiva]]''&lt;ref name=APNI&gt;{{cite web|title=''Pterostylis aestiva''|url=https://id.biodiversity.org.au/instance/apni/486366|publisher=APNI|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was published, then in 1978, his first book, ''Australian Ferns and Fern Allies'', written with Stephen Clemesha was published.&lt;ref name="ferns"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=David L.|last2=Clemesha|first2=Stephen C.|title=Australian ferns and fern allies|date=1989|publisher=Currawong Press|location=Chatswood (N.S.W.)|isbn=073010298X|edition=revised}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 Jones worked first as a horticultural research officer at the [[Australian National Botanic Gardens]] in [[Canberra]] and a year later began an intensive study of the taxonomy of Australian plant groups, especially orchids. From 1994 he worked as a research scientist in the Orchid Research Group at the Centre for Plant Biodiversity Research until his retirement in 2007.&lt;ref name="ANBG" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ANBG(2)" /&gt;

Jones facilitated a cooperation with groups of both professional and amateur botanists which has led to the description of many new species. Jones has travelled extensively and visited many remote areas of Australia in the search for new orchid species. He is the author of more than 350 papers describing new species of [[Orchidaceae|orchids]], 18 of [[cycad]]s as well as of other groups, including the fern genus ''[[Revwattsia]]''&lt;ref name=APNI(2)&gt;{{cite web|title=''Revwattsia''|url=https://id.biodiversity.org.au/instance/apni/578682|publisher=APNI|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has published many books on Australian plants. He is described by fellow botanist, [[Mark Alwin Clements]] as "without doubt one of the outstanding botanists of our time" and by [[Rob Cross (Australian botanist)|Rob Cross]] and [[Roger David Spencer|Roger Spencer]], horticultural botanists at the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne]], as "probably the most prolific horticultural botanist that Australia has produced."&lt;ref name="ANBG" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ANBG(2)" /&gt;

'''Charles David White''' (July 1, 1862 &amp;ndash; February 7, 1935), who normally went by his middle name, was an American [[geologist]], born in [[Palmyra (town), New York|Palmyra, New York]].

He graduated from [[Cornell University]] in 1886, and in 1889 became a member of the [[United States Geological Survey]]. Eventually, he rose to be chief geologist.

In 1903 he became an associate curator of [[paleobotany]] at the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. He wrote numerous papers on geological and paleontological subjects.

The [[David White House]], his home for 15 years, is a U.S. [[National Historic Landmark]].&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"&gt;{{citation|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: David White House|url={{NHLS url|id=76002133}} |format=pdf|date=July 1975 |author=James Sheire |publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made one of the most comprehensive studies on the [[Glossopteris]] Flora, the main component of the fossil deposits of mineral coal in Brazil.&lt;ref name="Glossopteris"&gt;White, D.

(Facsimile edition: 1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

David White won the [[Mary Clark Thompson Medal|Thompson Medal]] in 1931 and the [[Charles Doolittle Walcott Medal|Walcott Medal]] in 1934.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8029">[[File:GraphHeatCapacityElements SelectedRange.png|thumb|upright=2.2|Molar heat capacity of most elements at 25&amp;nbsp;°C is in the range between 2,8 ''R'' and 3,4 ''R'': Plot as a function of atomic number with a y range from 22.5 to 30 J/mol K.]]
The '''Dulong–Petit law''', a thermodynamic law proposed in 1819 by French physicists [[Pierre Louis Dulong]] and [[Alexis Thérèse Petit]], states the classical expression for the molar specific [heat capacity] of certain chemical elements.  Experimentally the two scientists had found that the heat capacity per weight (the mass-specific heat capacity) for a number of elements was close to a constant value, ''after'' it had been multiplied by a number representing the presumed relative atomic weight of the element. These [[atomic weight]]s had shortly before been suggested by [[John Dalton]] and modified by [[Jacob Berzelius]].

In modern terms, Dulong and Petit found that the heat capacity of a [[mole (unit)|mole]] of many solid elements is about 3''R'', where ''R'' is the modern constant called the universal [[gas constant]]. Dulong and Petit were unaware of the relationship with ''R'', since this constant had not yet been defined from the later [[Kinetic Molecular Theory|kinetic theory]] of gases. The value of 3''R'' is about 25 [[joule]]s per [[kelvin]], and Dulong and Petit essentially found that this was the heat capacity of certain solid elements per mole of atoms they contained.

The modern theory of the heat capacity of solids states that it is due to [[phonon|lattice vibration]]s in the solid and was first derived in crude form from this assumption by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1907. The [[Einstein solid]] model thus gave for the first time a reason why the Dulong–Petit law should be stated in terms of the classical heat capacities for gases.

==Equivalent forms of statement of the law==

An equivalent statement of the Dulong–Petit law in modern terms is that, regardless of the nature of the substance, the [[specific heat capacity]] '''c''' of a solid element (measured in joule per kelvin per kilogram) is equal to 3'''R'''/''M'', where ''R'' is the [[gas constant]] (measured in joule per kelvin per mole) and ''M'' is the [[molar mass]] (measured in kilogram per mole). Thus, the heat capacity per mole of many elements is 3''R''.

The initial form of the Dulong–Petit law was:

:&lt;math&gt;cM = K&lt;/math&gt;

where c is the specific heat, ''M'' the atomic weights accepted in that day, and '''K''' is a new constant which we know today is about '''3R'''.

In modern terms the mass '''m''' divided by atomic weight ''M'' gives the number of moles '''N'''.

:&lt;math&gt;m/M = N&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, using uppercase '''C''' for the ''total'' heat capacity, and lowercase '''c''' for the specific heat capacity '''c''' :

:&lt;math&gt;(C/m)M = K&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C(M/m) = C/N = K = 3R&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;C/N = 3R&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore, the heat capacity of most solid crystalline substances is '''3R''' per mole of substance.

Dulong and Petit did not state their law in terms of the [[gas constant]] ''R'' (which was not then known). Instead, they measured the values of heat capacities (per weight) of substances and found them smaller for substances of greater atomic weight as inferred by Dalton and other early atomists. Dulong and Petit then found that when multiplied by these atomic weights, the value for the heat capacity (which would now be the heat capacity ''per [[mole (unit)|mole]]'' in modern terms) was nearly constant, and equal to a value which was later recognized to be 3 ''R''.

In other modern terminology, the [[Heat capacity#Dimensionless heat capacity|dimensionless heat capacity]] is equal to 3.

For chemical applications the Dulong-Petit Law is approximately given by the relation:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{atomic\;weight} \;\cdot\; \mathrm{specific\; heat\; capacity} = 6.4 &lt;/math&gt;

==Application limits==
[[File:GraphHeatCapacityOfTheElementsI2s.png|thumb|upright=2.2|The molar heat capacity plotted of most elements at 25°C plotted as a function of atomic number. The value of bromine is for the gaseous state. For iodine, a value for the gas and one for the solid is shown.]]

Despite its simplicity, Dulong–Petit law offers fairly good prediction for the specific heat capacity of many elementary solids with relatively simple crystal structure at high [[temperature]]s. This is because in the classical theory of [[heat capacity]], the heat capacity of solids approaches a maximum of 3''R'' per [[mole (unit)|mole]] of atoms because full vibrational-mode degrees of freedom amount to 3 degrees of freedom per atom, each corresponding to a quadratic kinetic energy term and a quadratic potential energy term. By the [[equipartition theorem]], the average of each quadratic term is {{frac|1|2}}''kT'', or {{frac|1|2}}''RT'' per mole (see derivation below). Multiplied by 3 degrees of freedom and the two terms per degree of freedom, this amounts to 3''R'' per mole heat capacity.

The Dulong&amp;ndash;Petit law fails at room temperatures for light atoms bonded strongly to each other, such as in metallic beryllium and in carbon as diamond. Here, it predicts higher heat capacities than are actually found, with the difference due to higher-energy vibrational modes not being populated at room temperatures in these substances.

In the very low (cryogenic) temperature region, where the quantum mechanical nature of energy storage in all solids manifests itself with larger and larger effect, the law fails for all substances. For crystals under such conditions, the [[Debye model]], an extension of the Einstein theory that accounts for statistical distributions in atomic vibration when there are lower amounts of energy to distribute, works well.

==Derivation==

A system of vibrations in a crystalline solid lattice can be modelled by considering harmonic oscillator potentials along each degree of freedom. Then, the [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] of the system can be written as&lt;ref name="landau"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Landau |first1=L. D. |last2=Lifshitz |first2=E. M.|title=Statistical Physics Pt. 1|edition= 3rd|series= Course in Theoretical Physics|volume= 5|year=1980|publisher=Pergamon Press|location= Oxford|isbn=978-0-7506-3372-7|page= 193,196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;F=N\varepsilon_0+k_BT\sum_\alpha \log\left(1-e^{-\hbar\omega_{\alpha}/k_BT}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where the index ''&amp;alpha;'' sums over all the degrees of freedom.  In the 1907 [[Einstein solid|Einstein model]] (as opposed to the later [[Debye model]]) we consider only the high-energy limit:

: &lt;math&gt;k_BT\gg\hbar\omega_\alpha. \, &lt;/math&gt;

Then

: &lt;math&gt;1-e^{-\hbar\omega_\alpha/k_BT} \approx \hbar\omega_\alpha/k_BT \, &lt;/math&gt;

and we have

: &lt;math&gt;F=N\varepsilon_0+k_BT\sum_{\alpha}\log\left(\frac{\hbar\omega_{\alpha}}{k_BT}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Define ''geometric mean frequency'' by

: &lt;math&gt;\log\bar{\omega}=\frac{1}{M}\sum_\alpha \log\omega_\alpha,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''M'' measures the total number of degrees of freedom of the system.

Thus we have

: &lt;math&gt;F=N\varepsilon_0-Mk_BT\log k_BT+Mk_BT\log\hbar\bar{\omega}. \, &lt;/math&gt;

Using energy

: &lt;math&gt;E=F-T\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial T}\right)_V,&lt;/math&gt;

we have

: &lt;math&gt;E=N\varepsilon_0+Mk_BT. \, &lt;/math&gt;

This gives specific heat

: &lt;math&gt;C_V=\left(\frac{\partial E}{\partial T}\right)_V=Mk_B,&lt;/math&gt;

which is independent of the temperature.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11312">The '''EMC effect''' is the surprising observation that the [[Cross section (physics)|cross section]] for [[deep inelastic scattering]] from an [[atomic nucleus]] is different from that of the same number of free [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s (collectively referred to as [[nucleon]]s). From this observation, it can be inferred that the [[quark]] momentum distributions in nucleons bound inside nuclei are different from those of free nucleons. This effect was first observed in 1983 at [[CERN]] by the [[European Muon Collaboration]],&lt;ref name="aubert"&gt;{{cite journal|author=J.J. Aubert|display-authors=etal|year=1983|title=The ratio of the nucleon structure functions F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; for iron and deuterium|journal=Phys. Lett.

It was unexpected, since the average binding energy of protons and neutrons inside nuclei is insignificant when compared to the energy transferred in deep inelastic scattering reactions that probe quark distributions. While over 1000 scientific papers have been written on the topic and numerous hypotheses have been proposed, no definitive explanation for the cause of the effect has been confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/53091 D. Higinbotham, G.A Miller, O. Hen, and K. Rith, CERN Courier, April, 26 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Determining the origin of the EMC effect is one of the major unsolved problems in the field of [[nuclear physics]].

== Background ==
[[Proton]]s and [[neutron]]s, collectively referred to as [[nucleon]]s, are the constituents of [[Atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]], and nuclear matter such as that in [[neutron star]]s. Protons and neutrons themselves are composite particles made up of [[quark]]s and [[gluon]]s, a discovery made at [[SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory|SLAC]] in the late 1960s using [[deep inelastic scattering]] (DIS) experiments ([[List of Nobel laureates in Physics|1990 Nobel Prize]]). In the DIS reaction, a probe (typically an accelerated [[electron]]) scatters from an individual quark inside a nucleon. By measuring the cross section of the DIS process, the [[Parton distribution function|distribution of quarks inside the nucleon]] can be determined. These distributions are effectively functions of a single variable, known as Bjorken-x, which is a measure of the momentum fraction of the struck quark. Experiments using DIS from protons by electrons and other probes have allowed physicists to measure the proton's quark distribution over a wide range of Bjorken-x, i.e. the probability of finding a quark with momentum fraction x in the proton. Experiments using [[deuterium]] and [[helium-3]] targets have similarly allowed physicists to determine the quark distribution of the neutron.

==Experimental history ==
[[File:EMC Effect.png|thumb|right|Fig 1. The original figure from the paper by the EMC Collaboration.&lt;ref name="aubert" /&gt; In the absence of the EMC effect, the data would not have a falling slope as a function of Bjorken-x.]]In 1983, the [[European Muon Collaboration]] published results from an experiment conducted at [[CERN]] in which the DIS reaction was measured for high-energy [[muon]] scattering from iron and deuterium targets. It was expected that the cross section for DIS from iron divided by that from deuterium, and scaled by a factor of 28 (The [[iron-56]] nucleus has 28 times more nucleons than deuterium) would be approximately 1. Instead, the data (fig. 1) showed a decreasing slope in the region of 0.3 &lt; x &lt; 0.7, reaching a minimum of 0.85 at the largest values of x. This decreasing slope is a hallmark of the EMC effect. The slope of this cross section ratio between 0.3 &lt; x &lt; 0.7 is often referred to as the "size of the EMC effect" for a given nucleus.

Since that landmark discovery, the EMC effect has been measured over a wide-range of nuclei, at several different laboratories, and with multiple different probes. Notable examples include the E139 experiment at [[SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory|SLAC]], which measured the EMC effect in &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He, &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;Be, &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C, &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;Al, &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ca, &lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Fe, &lt;sup&gt;108&lt;/sup&gt;Ag, and &lt;sup&gt;197&lt;/sup&gt;Au,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gomez|first=J.|last2=Arnold|first2=R.

These predictions do not match the experimental data.]]

== Possible explanations ==
The EMC effect is surprising because of the difference in energy scales between nuclear binding and deep inelastic scattering. Typical binding energies for nucleons in nuclei are on the order of 10 [[Electronvolt|megaelectron volts]] (MeV). Typical energy transfers in DIS are on the order of several gigaelectron volts (GeV). Nuclear binding effects were therefore believed to be insignificant when measuring quark distributions. A number of hypotheses for the cause of the EMC effect have been offered. While many older hypotheses, such as [[Fermi motion]] (see Fig. 2), nuclear [[pion]]s, and others have been ruled out by electron scattering or [[Drell–Yan process|Drell-Yan]] data, modern hypotheses generally fall into two viable categories: mean-field modification, and short-range correlated pairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hen|first=Or|last2=Miller|first2=Gerald A.|last3=Piasetzky|first3=Eli|last4=Weinstein|first4=Lawrence B.|date=2017-11-13|title=Nucleon-nucleon correlations, short-lived excitations, and the quarks within|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/RevModPhys.89.045002|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|volume=89|issue=4|pages=045002|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.89.045002|arxiv=1611.09748|bibcode=2017RvMP...89d5002H}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Norton|first=P.

=== Mean-field modification ===
The mean-field modification hypothesis suggests that the nuclear environment leads to a modification of nucleon structure. As an illustration, consider that the average density inside a nuclear matter is approximately 0.16 nucleons per [[Femtometre|fm]]&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. If nuclei were hard-spheres, their radius would be approximately 1.1 fm, leading to a density of only 0.13 nucleons per fm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, assuming [[Close-packing of equal spheres|ideal close-packing]]. Nuclear matter is dense, and the close proximity of nucleons may allow quarks in different nucleons to interact directly, leading to nucleon modification. Mean-field models predict that all nucleons experience some degree of structure modification, and they are consistent with the observation that the EMC effect increases with nuclear size, scales with local density, and saturates for very large nuclei. Furthermore, mean-field models also predict a large "polarized EMC effect,&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; a large modification of the spin-dependent g&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; structure function for nuclei relative to that of their constituent protons and neutrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cloët|first=I.C.|last2=Bentz|first2=W.|last3=Thomas|first3=A.W.|title=EMC and polarized EMC effects in nuclei|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2006.08.076|journal=Physics Letters B|volume=642|issue=3|pages=210–217|doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2006.08.076|arxiv=nucl-th/0605061|bibcode=2006PhLB..642..210C}}&lt;/ref&gt; This prediction will be tested experimentally as part of the [[Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility#12 GeV upgrade|Jefferson Lab 12-GeV program]].

=== Short-range correlations ===
Rather than all nucleons experiencing some modification, the short-range correlations hypothesis predicts that most nucleons at any one time are unmodified, but some are substantially modified. The most heavily modified nucleons are those in temporary short-range correlated (SRC) pairs. It has been observed that approximately 20% of nucleons (in medium and heavy nuclei) at any given moment are part of short-lived pairs with significant spatial overlap with a partner nucleon. The nucleons in these pairs then recoil apart with large back-to-back momenta of several hundred MeV/''[[Speed of light|c]]'', larger than the nuclear [[Fermi Momentum|Fermi momentum]], making them the highest-momentum nucleons in the nucleus. In the short-range correlations hypothesis, the EMC effect stems from large modification of these high-momentum SRC nucleons. This is supported by the observation that the size of the EMC effect in different nuclei correlates linearly with the density of SRC pairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weinstein|first=L.

A '''free-return trajectory''' is a [[trajectory]] of a [[spacecraft]] traveling away from a primary body (for example, the [[Earth]]) where gravity due to a secondary body (for example, the [[Moon]]) causes the spacecraft to return to the primary body without propulsion (hence the term ''free'').&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.braeunig.us/apollo/free-return.htm Diagram of the free return] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308063028/http://www.braeunig.us/apollo/free-return.htm |date=2016-03-08 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Earth–Moon ==

The first spacecraft to use a free-return trajectory was the Soviet [[Luna 3]] mission in October 1959. It used the moon's gravity to send it back towards the earth so that the photographs it had taken of the far side of the moon could be downloaded by radio.

Symmetrical free-return trajectories were studied by [[Arthur Schwaniger]] of [[NASA]] in 1963 with reference to the Earth–Moon system.&lt;ref name="traj"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schwaninger|first=Arthur J.|title=Trajectories in the Earth-Moon Space with Symmetrical Free Return Properties|publisher=[[NASA]] / [[Marshall Space Flight Center]]|location=Huntsville, Alabama|year=1963|series=Technical Note D-1833|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112106596973;view=1up;seq=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied cases in which the trajectory at some point crosses at a right angle the line going through the centre of the Earth and the centre of the moon, and also cases in which the trajectory crosses at a right angle the plane containing that line and perpendicular to the plane of the moon's orbit. In both scenarios we can distinguish between:&lt;ref name="traj"/&gt;
* A [[Circumlunar trajectory|circumlunar]] free-return trajectory around the Moon. The spacecraft passes behind the Moon. It moves there in a direction opposite to that of the Moon, or at least slower than the Moon in the same direction. If the craft's orbit begins in a normal (west to east) direction near Earth, then it makes a [[Analemma|figure 8]] around the Earth and Moon when plotted in a coordinate system that rotates as the moon goes around the earth.
* A cislunar free-return trajectory. The spacecraft goes beyond the orbit of the Moon, returns to inside the Moon's orbit, moves in front of the Moon while being diverted by the Moon's gravity to a path away from the Earth to beyond the orbit of the Moon again, and is drawn back to Earth by Earth's gravity. (There is no real distinction between these trajectories and similar ones that never go beyond the Moon's orbit, but the latter may not get very close to the Moon, so are not considered as relevant.)

In both the circumlunar case and the cislunar case, the craft can be moving generally from west to east around the earth (co-rotational), or from east to west (counter-rotational).

For trajectories in the plane of the Moon's orbit with small [[periselenum]] radius (close approach of the Moon), the flight time for a cislunar free-return trajectory is longer than for the circumlunar free-return trajectory with the same periselenum radius. Flight time for a cislunar free-return trajectory decreases with increasing periselenum radius, while flight time for a circumlunar free-return trajectory increases with periselenum radius.&lt;ref name="traj"/&gt;

The speed at a perigee of 6555&amp;nbsp;km from the centre of the earth for trajectories passing between 2000 and 20&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;km from the moon is between 10.84 and 10.92&amp;nbsp;km/s regardless of whether the trajectory is cislunar or circumlunar or whether it is co-rotational or counter-rotational.&lt;ref&gt;Schwaninger, Fig. 9, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the simplified model where the orbit of the Moon around the Earth is circular, Schwaniger found that there exists a free-return trajectory in the plane of the orbit of the Moon which is periodic. After returning to low altitude above the Earth (the perigee radius is a parameter, typically 6555&amp;nbsp;km) the spacecraft would start over on the same trajectory. This periodic trajectory is counter-rotational (it goes from east to west when near the Earth). It has a period of about 650 hours (compare with a sidereal month, which is 655.7 hours, or 27.3 days). Considering the trajectory in an inertial (non-rotating) frame of reference, the perigee occurs directly under the Moon when the Moon is on one side of the Earth. Speed at perigee is about 10.91&amp;nbsp;km/s. After 3 days it reaches the Moon's orbit, but now more or less on the opposite side of the Earth from the Moon. After a few more days, the craft reaches its (first) apogee and begins to fall back toward the Earth, but as it approaches the Moon's orbit, the Moon arrives, and there is a gravitational interaction. The craft passes on the near side of the Moon at a radius of 2150&amp;nbsp;km (410&amp;nbsp;km above the surface) and is thrown back outwards, where it reaches a second apogee. It then falls back toward the Earth, goes around to the other side, and goes through another perigee close to where the first perigee had taken place. By this time the Moon has moved almost half an orbit and is again directly over the craft at perigee. Other cislunar trajectories are similar but do not end up in the same situation as at the beginning, so cannot repeat.&lt;ref name="traj"/&gt;

There will of course be similar trajectories with periods of about two sidereal months, three sidereal months, and so on. In each case, the two apogees will be further and further away from Earth. These were not considered by Schwaniger.

This kind of trajectory can occur of course for similar [[three-body problem]]s; this problem is an example of a [[Three-body problem#Circular restricted three-body problem|circular restricted three-body problem]].

While in a true free-return trajectory no propulsion is applied, in practice there may be small mid-course corrections or other [[Orbital maneuver|maneuvers]].

A free-return trajectory may be the initial trajectory to allow a safe return in the event of a systems failure; this was applied in the [[Apollo 8]], [[Apollo 10]], and [[Apollo 11]] lunar missions. In such a case a free return to a suitable reentry situation is more useful than returning to near the Earth, but then needing propulsion anyway to prevent moving away from it again. Since all went well, these Apollo missions did not have to take advantage of the free return and [[Orbit insertion|inserted into orbit]] upon arrival at the Moon.

Due to the landing-site restrictions that resulted from constraining the launch to a free return that flew by the Moon, subsequent Apollo missions, starting with [[Apollo 12]] and including the ill-fated [[Apollo 13]], used a hybrid trajectory that launched to a highly elliptical Earth orbit that fell short of the Moon with effectively a free return to the atmospheric entry corridor. They then performed a mid-course maneuver to change to a trans-Lunar trajectory that was not a free return.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.braeunig.us/apollo/hybrid-profile.htm Hybrid trajectory diagram] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118234041/http://www.braeunig.us/apollo/hybrid-profile.htm |date=2013-01-18 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; This retained the safety characteristics of being on a free return upon launch and only departed from free return once the systems were checked out and the lunar module was docked with the command module, providing back-up maneuver capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/afj/launchwindow/lw1.html|title=Apollo lunar landing launch window: The controlling factors and constraints|last=Wheeler|first=Robin|year=2009|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=2009-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, within hours after the accident, Apollo 13 used the lunar module to maneuver from its planned trajectory to a circumlunar free-return trajectory.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Cass, "[http://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/space-flight/apollo-13-we-have-a-solution Apollo 13, We Have a Solution]", ''IEEE Spectrum'', APRIL 2005 (accessed August 6, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo 13 was the only Apollo mission to actually turn around the Moon in a free-return trajectory (however, two hours after perilune, propulsion was applied to speed the return to Earth by 10 hours and move the landing spot from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific Ocean).

== Earth–Mars ==
A free-return transfer orbit to Mars is also possible. As with the Moon, this option is mostly considered for manned missions. [[Robert Zubrin]], in his book ''[[The Case for Mars]]'', discusses various trajectories to Mars for his mission design [[Mars Direct]]. The [[Hohmann transfer orbit]] can be made free-return. It takes 250 days (0.68&amp;nbsp;years) in the transit to Mars, and in the case of a free-return style abort without the use of propulsion at Mars, 1.5 years to get back to Earth, at a total [[delta-v]] requirement of 3.34&amp;nbsp;km/s. Zubrin advocates a slightly faster transfer, that takes only 180 days to Mars, but 2 years back to Earth in case of an abort. This route comes also at the cost of a higher delta-v of 5.08&amp;nbsp;km/s. Zubrin claims that even faster routes have a significantly higher delta-v cost and free-return duration (e.g. transfer to Mars in 130 days takes 7.93&amp;nbsp;km/s delta-v and 4 years on the free return), and thus advocates for the 180-day transfer even if more efficient propulsion systems, that are claimed to enable faster transfers, should materialize.&lt;ref name="Zubrin 1996 p. "&gt;{{cite book | last=Zubrin | first=Robert | title=The case for Mars: the plan to settle the red planet and why we must | publisher=Free Press | location=New York | year=1996 | isbn=978-0-684-83550-1 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A free return is also the part of various other mission designs, such as [[Mars Semi-Direct]] and [[Inspiration Mars]].

There also exists the option of two- or three-year free-returns that do not rely on the gravity of Mars, but are simply transfer orbits with periods of 2 or 1.5 years, respectively. A two-year free return means from Earth to Mars (aborted there) and then back to Earth all in 2 years.&lt;ref name=Wooster&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Paul Wooster]] et al.|title=Trajectory Options for Human Mars Missions|url=https://smartech.gatech.edu/bitstream/handle/1853/14747/HumanMarsMissionTrajectories.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202203100/https://smartech.gatech.edu/bitstream/handle/1853/14747/HumanMarsMissionTrajectories.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|archivedate=December 2, 2017|deadurl=no|doi=10.2514/6.2006-6308|date=Aug 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entry corridor (range of permissible path angles) for landing on Mars is limited, and experience has shown that the path angle is hard to fix (e.g. +/- 0.5 deg). This limits entry into the atmosphere to less than 9&amp;nbsp;km/s. On this assumption, a two-year return is not possible for some years, and for some years a [[delta-v]] kick of 0.6 to 2.7&amp;nbsp;km/s at Mars may be needed to get back to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Wooster ''et al.'', ''op. cit.'', Table 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

NASA published the [[Mars Design Reference Mission|Design Reference Architecture 5.0]] for Mars in 2009, advocating a 174-day transfer to Mars, which is close to Zubrin's proposed trajectory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/373665main_NASA-SP-2009-566.pdf Human Exploration of Mars Design Reference Architecture 5.0].&lt;/ref&gt; It cites a delta-v requirement of approximately 4&amp;nbsp;km/s for the trans-Mars injection, but does not mention the duration of a free return to Earth.

[[File:FCC schematic.png|thumb|350px|The future circular colliders considered under the FCC study compared to previous circular colliders.]]

The '''Future Circular Collider''' (FCC) study aims at developing conceptual designs for a post-[[LHC]] [[particle accelerator]] research infrastructure in a global context, with an energy significantly above that of previous circular colliders ([[Super Proton Synchrotron|SPS]], [[Tevatron]], [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Benedikt |first1=M. |last2=Zimmermann |first2=F. |date=28 March 2014 |title=The Future Circular Collider Study |url=https://cerncourier.com/the-future-circular-collider-study/ |website=CERN Courier |accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Benedikt |first1=M. |last2=Zimmermann |first2=F. |date=Spring 2015 |title=Future Circular Collider (FCC) Study |url=https://www.aps.org/units/fip/newsletters/201502/collider.cfm |website=FIP Newsletter |accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FCC study explores the feasibility of different particle collider scenarios with the aim of significantly expanding the current energy and luminosity frontiers. It aims to complement existing technical designs for linear electron/positron colliders ([[International Linear Collider|ILC]] and [[Compact Linear Collider|CLIC]]).

The study has an emphasis on proton/proton ([[hadron]]) and electron/positron ([[lepton]]) colliders while a hadron/lepton scenario is also examined. The study explores the potential of [[hadron]] and [[lepton]] circular colliders, performing an in-depth analysis of infrastructure and operation concepts and considering the technology research and development programmes that are required to build and operate a future circular collider. A conceptual design is planned to be delivered before the end of 2018, in time for the next update of the [[European Strategy for Particle Physics]].

==Background==

The study hosted by CERN has been initiated as a direct response to the high-priority recommendation of the updated European Strategy for Particle Physics, published in 2013:

"CERN should undertake design studies for accelerator projects in a global context, with emphasis on proton-proton and electron-positron high-energy frontier machines. These design studies should be coupled to a vigorous accelerator R&amp;D programme, including high-field magnets and high-gradient accelerating structures, in collaboration with national institutes, laboratories and universities worldwide."

This is in line with the recommendations of the United States’ Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5) and of the International Committee for Future Accelerators (ICFA).

The discovery of the Higgs boson at the LHC, together with the absence so far of any phenomena beyond the Standard Model in collisions at centre of mass energies up to 8 TeV, has triggered an interest in future colliders to push the energy and precision frontiers. A future “energy frontier” collider at 100 TeV is a “discovery machine”, reaching out to so far unknown territories. "New physics" seen at such a machine could explain observations such as the prevalence of matter over antimatter and non-zero neutrino masses.

==Motivation==

The LHC has greatly advanced our understanding of [[matter]] and the [[Standard Model]] (SM), however it cannot confirm every aspect of the SM nor explore other key questions about the [[Universe]]. To find out more about [[dark matter]], the matter/antimatter asymmetry, or the origin of [[neutrino]] masses, extended energy and mass reach and higher precision are necessary.

The Future Circular Collider (FCC) study develops options for potential high-energy frontier circular colliders at CERN for the post-LHC era that will open up new horizons in the field of fundamental physics. Among other things, it plans to study dark matter, which accounts for approximately 25% of the visible universe, make precise measurements of the Higgs boson, and explore beyond the Standard Model theories.

A Future Circular Collider could open a window for exploring the unknown 95% of the [[Universe]]: What is [[dark matter]]? Are there [[Supersymmetry|supersymmetric particles]]? Are there other [[fundamental interactions]]?

The discovery of the [[Higgs boson]] was a milestone in the long-standing effort to complete the [[Standard Model of Particle Physics]], the theory that describes the laws governing most of the known Universe. Yet the Standard Model cannot explain several observations, such as:

* evidence for [[dark matter]],
* prevalence of matter over [[antimatter]],
* the [[neutrino]] masses.

Expanding our understanding of the [[Physical law|fundamental law]]s of nature requires the energy frontier to be pushed further. Reaching this goal within the 21st century in an efficient and reliable way calls for a larger circular collider.

The FCC, with its high precision and high energy reach, could extend the search of new particles and interactions well beyond the LHC, that may hold the key to understanding those unexplained phenomena.

[[File:OpenQuestions jpg.jpg|thumb|Five percent of the Universe is directly observable. The [[Standard Model of Particle Physics]] describes it precisely. What about the remaining 95%?]]

==Scope==
The FCC Study puts an emphasis on proton/proton high-energy and electron/positron high-intensity frontier machines. A hadron/lepton interaction scenario is also examined.

A 100 TeV hadron collider in a 100&amp;nbsp;km long tunnel defines therefore the overall infrastructure for the FCC study. The development of baseline designs for an energy-frontier hadron collider and a luminosity-frontier electron/positron collider forms the core of the study.

The FCC study will identify the technological advancements required for reaching the new energy and intensity frontiers and will make the first step by performing technology feasibility assessments. The study will provide an analysis of the infrastructure and operation cost while cost optimization, greater efficiency and reliable operation are key parameters in the study.

The FCC study explores the physics cases for all collider scenarios in a coordinated way that embraces discovery and precision physics. Scientists and engineers are working on the detector concepts needed to address the physics questions in each of the scenarios (hh, ee, he). The work programme includes experiment and detector concept studies to allow new physics to be explored. Detector technologies will be based on experiment concepts, the projected collider performances and the physics cases. Innovative technologies have to be developed in diverse fields, such as cryogenics, superconductivity, material science, and computer science, including new data processing and data management concepts.

Creativity and innovation are needed to develop the physics case, meet the required accelerator parameters and realise unprecedented experiments.

==Accelerators==

The FCC Study will develop and evaluate three accelerator concepts for its conceptual design report.

===FCC-hh (proton/proton and ion/ion)===

A future energy-frontier hadron collider will be able to discover force carriers of new interactions up to masses of around 30 TeV. In such a machine, the discovery reach for dark matter particles will extend well beyond the TeV region, while supersymmetric partners of quarks and gluons can be produced at masses up to 15-20 TeV and the search for a possible substructure inside quarks can be extended down to distance scales of 10&lt;sup&gt;−21&lt;/sup&gt; m. Billions of Higgs bosons and trillions of top quarks will be produced, creating new opportunities for the study of rare decays and flavour physics, which tremendously benefit from higher collision energies.

A hadron collider will also extend the study of Higgs and gauge boson interactions to energies well above the TeV scale, providing a way to analyse in detail the mechanism underlying the breaking of the electroweak symmetry.

The FCC-hh collider offers an opportunity to push the exploration of the collective structure of matter at the most extreme density and temperature conditions to new frontiers through the study of heavy-ion collisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zimmerman |first1=F. |last2=Benedikt |first2=M. |last3=Schulte |first3=D. |last4=Wenninger |first4=J. |chapter=Challenges for Highest Energy Circular Colliders |chapter-url=http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/AccelConf/IPAC2014/papers/moxaa01.pdf|title=Proceedings of IPAC2014, Dresden, Germany |isbn=978-3-95450-132-8 |page=1–6 |id=MOXAA01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Hinchliffe |first1=I. |last2=Kotwal |first2=A. |last3=Mangano |first3=M.

===FCC-ee (electron/positron)===

A lepton collider with centre-of-mass collision energies between 90 and 350 GeV is considered a potential intermediate step towards the realisation of the hadron facility. Clean experimental conditions have given e+e− storage rings a strong record of accomplishment both for measuring known particles with the highest precision and for exploring the unknown.

More specifically, high luminosity and improved handling of lepton beams would create the opportunity to measure the properties of the Z, W, Higgs, and top particles, as well as the strong interaction, with unequalled accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ellis |first1=J. |last2=You |first2=T. |year=2016 |title=Sensitivities of Prospective Future e&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; Colliders to Decoupled New Physics |journal=[[Journal of High Energy Physics]] |volume=2016 |issue=3 |page=89 |arxiv=1510.04561  |bibcode=2016JHEP...03..089E |doi=10.1007/JHEP03(2016)089}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |last1=d'Enterria |first1=D.|year=2016 |title=Physics case of FCC-ee |eprint=1601.06640  |class=hep-ex}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unique measurements of invisible or exotic decays of the Higgs and Z bosons would offer discovery potential for dark matter or heavy neutrinos. In effect, the FCC-ee could enable profound investigations of electroweak symmetry breaking and open a broad indirect search for new physics over several orders of magnitude in energy or couplings.

===FCC-he (electron/proton)===

With the huge energy provided by the 50 TeV proton beam and the potential availability of an electron beam with energy of the order of 60 GeV, new horizons open up for the physics of [[deep inelastic scattering]]. The FCC-he collider would be both a high-precision Higgs factory and a powerful microscope that could discover new particles, study quark/gluon interactions, and examine possible further substructure of matter in the world. With such a programme, accompanied by unprecedented measurements of strong and electroweak interaction phenomena, the hadron/electron collider is another unique complement to the exploration of nature at high energies.

==Technologies==

As the development of a next generation particle accelerator requires state-of-the-art technology, the FCC Study has undertaken extensive R&amp;D to create the equipment and machines that are needed for the realization of the project. Technology R&amp;D relies on interdisciplinary synergies, taking into account the experience from past and present accelerator projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barletta |first1=W. |last2=Battaglia |first2=M. |last3=Klute |first3=M. |last4=Mangano |first4=M. |last5=Prestemon |first5=S. |last6=Rossi |first6=L. |last7=Skands |first7=P. |year=2014 |title=Future Hadron Colliders: from physics perspectives to technology R&amp;D |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168900214008523 |journal=[[Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A]]  |volume=764 |pages=352–368 |bibcode=2014NIMPA.764..352B |doi=10.1016/j.nima.2014.07.010 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Materials FCC.png|thumb|The FCC study drives the research in the field of superconducting materials.]]

The foundations for these advancements are being laid in a focused R&amp;D programmes:

* a 16 Tesla high-field accelerator magnet and related super-conductor research,
* a 100 MW radiofrequency acceleration system that can efficiently transfer power from the electricity grid to the beams,
* a highly efficient large-scale cryogenics infrastructure to cool down superconducting accelerator components and the accompanying refrigeration systems.

[[File:16TeslaMagnet.png|thumb|The CERN magnet group produced a 16.2-Tesla peak field magnet – nearly twice that produced by the current LHC dipoles paving the way for future more powerful accelerators.]]
[[File:MAX 2889.jpg|thumb|New superconducting Radiofrequency (RF) Cavities are developed to accelerate particles to higher energies.]]

Numerous other technologies are needed for reliable, sustainable and efficient operation. The effective interplay of different science and technology domains (accelerator physics, high-field magnets, cryogenics, vacuum, civil engineering, material science, superconductors) is the key to success.

Advancing technology and engineering for high-energy particle physics and accelerators creates significant benefits for society. These innovations lead to new products and services that change our daily lives.

The rich and diverse FCC R&amp;D programme attracts significant interest from students of different fields ranging from material sciences, chemistry, mechanical and electrical engineering, over computer science, mathematics, reliability engineering to technology management, international business management, entrepreneurship, patent and innovation management, international law and social sciences.

===Magnet Technologies===

High-field superconducting magnets are a key enabling technology for a frontier hadron collider. To steer a 50 TeV beam over a 100&amp;nbsp;km tunnel, 16-Tesla dipoles will be necessary, twice the strength of the magnetic field of the LHC.

[[File:MagnetsFCC.jpg|thumb|Evolution of superconducting Nb-Ti magnets for particle accelerator use.]]

The magnet R&amp;D aims to extend the range of operation of accelerator magnets based on Low Temperature Superconductors (LTS) up to 16 T and explore the technological challenges inherent to the use of High Temperature Superconductors (HTS) for accelerator magnets in the 20 T range.

===Superconducting Radiofrequency Cavities===

The beams that move in a circular accelerator lose a percentage of their energy, approximately 4.4%, at every turn. To maintain their energy, a system of radiofrequency constantly provides 50&amp;nbsp;MW to each beam.

At a 45&amp;nbsp;GeV system, the percentage of energy loss is expected to increase and the superconducting RF cavities will have to deliver a total of 100 MW of acceleration power.

===Cryogenics===

Liquefaction of gas is a power-intensive operation that requires state-of-the-art [[cryogenic]] technology. The future lepton and the hadron colliders would make intensive use of low-temperature superconducting devices, operated at 4.5 K and 1.8 K, requiring very large-scale distribution, recovery, and storage of cryogenic fluids.

[[File:Cryogenics.jpg|thumb|Improving refrigeration cycle efficiency from 33% to 45% leads to 20% reduced cost and reduced power.]]

As a result, the cryogenic systems that have to be developed correspond to two to four times the presently deployed systems and require increased availability and maximum energy efficiency. Any further improvements in cryogenics are expected to find wide applications in medical imaging techniques.

The cryogenic beam vacuum system for an energy-frontier hadron collider must absorb an energy of 50 W per meter at cryogenic temperatures. To protect the magnet cold bore from the head load, the vacuum system needs to be resistant against electron cloud effects, highly robust, and stable under superconducting quench conditions.

It should also allow fast feedback in presence of impedance effects. New composite materials have to be developed to achieve these unique thermo-mechanics and electric properties for [[collimation]] systems. Such materials could also be complemented with the ongoing exploration of thin-film NEG coating that is used in the internal surface of the copper vacuum chambers.

===Collimation===

Finally, a 100 TeV hadron collider requires efficient and robust collimators, as 100&amp;nbsp;kW of hadronic background is expected at the interaction points. Moreover, fast self-adapting control systems with sub-millimeter collimation gaps are necessary to prevent irreversible damage of the machine and manage the 180 GJ stored in each magnet.

To address these challenges, the FCC Study searches for designs that can withstand the large energy loads with acceptable transient deformation and no permanent damage. Novel composites with unprecedented thermo-mechanical and electric properties will be investigated in cooperation with the FP7 HiLumi LHC DS and EuCARD2 programmes.

==Timescale==

The Large Hadron Collider at CERN with its High Luminosity upgrade is the world’s primary instrument for exploring the energy frontier until 2035. This defines the time window for preparing a post-LHC high-energy physics research infrastructure.

[[LEP]] and [[LHC]] have shown that a time-frame of 30 years is appropriate for the design and construction of a large accelerator complex and particle detectors. The significant lead time calls for a coordinated global effort. The goal is to ensure the seamless continuation of the world’s particle physics programme after the LHC era.

[[File:FCC timescales.png|thumb|The significant lead time of approximately twenty years for the design and construction of a large-scale accelerator calls for a coordinated effort.]]

==International Collaboration==

The FCC study hosted by CERN is an international collaboration of more than 70 institutes from all over the world.

This prepares the ground for geographically well-balanced contributions, leveraging the competences of world experts in the numerous areas concerned. It also ensures that the entire worldwide scientific community is involved from the very start of the endeavour.

Bringing together physics, experiments, accelerator concepts and technology R&amp;D within a single study will result in a coherent and consistent design for a future large-scale research infrastructure.

The experience from the operation of LEP and LHC and the unique opportunity to test the novel technologies in the High Luminosity LHC provide a solid basis for assessing the feasibility of a post-LHC particle accelerator.
The study will deliver a Conceptual Design Report (CDR) by the end of 2018, in time for the next European Strategy for Particle Physics.

==Organisation==

The FCC Study is hosted by CERN, also a Participant in the Collaboration, as a direct response to the recommendation made in the update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics 2013, adopted by the Organisation's Council. The Study is governed by three bodies: the International Collaboration Board (ICB), the International Steering Committee (ISC), and the International Advisory Committee (IAC).

[[File:OrganizatioFCC.jpg|thumb|The organization of the FCC Study]]

The ICB reviews the resource needs of the Study and finds matches within the Collaboration. It so channels the contributions from the Participants of the Collaboration aiming at a geographically well-balanced and topically complementary network of contributions The ISC is the supervisory and main governing body for the execution of the Study and acts on behalf of the Collaboration.

It is responsible for the proper execution and implementation of the decisions of the ICB, deriving and formulating the strategic scope, individual goals and the work programme of the Study. Its work is facilitated by the Coordination Group, the main executive body of the project, which coordinates the individual work packages and performs the day-to-day management of the Study.

Finally, the IAC reviews the scientific and technical progress of the Study and shall submit scientific and technical recommendations to the International Steering Committee to assist and facilitate major technical decisions.

==Similar studies==

Following the first run of the LHC, there is consensus in the scientific community that the results will have to be complemented by a collider that can study the discoveries in greater detail by producing different kinds of collisions. Several studies for future particle accelerators, both linear and circular, are therefore carried out.

The [[Compact Linear Collider]] (CLIC) examines the feasibility of a high-energy (up to 3 TeV), high-luminosity lepton (electron/positron) collider, while the [[International Linear Collider]] is a similar project, planned to have a collision energy of 500 GeV. In 2013, the two studies formed an organisational partnership, the Linear Collider Collaboration (LCC) to coordinate and advance the global development work for the linear collider. Concerning the LHC, a high-luminosity upgrade is planned to extend its operation lifetime into the mid-2030s. The upgrade will facilitate the detection of rare processes and improve statistically marginal measurements.

The '''Home Energy Resources Unit''' or Home Energy Recovery Unit (HERU) is a [[prototype]] [[kitchen appliance]] which is claimed to use [[household waste]] to generate [[energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-43643709 |title=New gadget turning waste into hot water |last=Gregory-Kumar |first=David |date=2018-04-04 |work=BBC News |access-date=2018-08-28 |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
Household waste, both organic and inorganic, is placed into a main chamber. Plastic and cardboard packaging as well as food waste can be inserted as fuel, and the waste does not need to be sorted or separated.&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://uk.mobile.reuters.com/video/2018/07/02/machine-transforms-household-trash-into?videoId=441354971&amp;videoChannel=82|title=Machine transforms household trash into fuel|work=Reuters video|date=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It then goes through an eight-hour cycle. The chamber containing the waste is heated to 100° [[celsius]] to evaporate water and remove [[oxygen]]. The temperature is then increased and [[pyrolysis]] takes place. Oxygen is then re-introduced to allow [[incineration]] of the [[Pyrolysis#Coke, carbon, charcoals, and chars|pyrolised waste]] for [[water heating]]. After eight hours, a tankful of stored hot water is produced, and all plastic, cardboard and organic waste is reduced to [[gas]] and [[ash]]. The gas is then used in a domestic [[boiler]], and the ash can be flushed safely into an ordinary sewage system. Any glass or metal waste is left in a [[thermal cleaning|clean state]].&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-43643709|title=New kitchen appliance turning rubbish into hot water|website=BBC.co.uk|date=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gizmodo"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2018/04/personal-incinerators-are-one-mans-vision-of-the-future/|title=Personal Incinerators Are One Man's Vision of the Future|website=Gizmodo.co.uk|date=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James F. Blinn''' (born 1949) is an American computer scientist who first became widely known for his work as a computer graphics expert at [[NASA]]'s [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL), particularly his work on the pre-encounter animations for the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] project,&lt;ref&gt;See Wayne Carlson's [http://accad.osu.edu/~waynec/history/tree/jpl.html history of JPL] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220072129/http://accad.osu.edu/~waynec/history/tree/jpl.html |date=2007-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; his work on the [[Carl Sagan]] documentary series ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage|Cosmos]]'', and the research of the [[Blinn–Phong shading model]].

He is credited with formulating Blinn's Law, which asserts that rendering time tends to remain constant, even as computers get faster. Animators prefer to improve quality, rendering more complex scenes with more sophisticated algorithms, rather than using less time to do the same work as before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Physically Based Rendering: From Theory to Implementation |first1=Matt |last1=Pharr |first2=Wenzel |last2=Jakob |first3=Greg |last3=Humphreys |edition=Third |publisher=Morgan Kaufmann Publishers |year=2017 |isbn=978-0-12-800645-0 |page=48 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=iNMVBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA48&amp;lpg=PA48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Digital Lighting and Rendering |first=Jeremy |last=Birn |edition=Second |publisher=New Riders |year=2006 |isbn=978-0321316318 |page=279 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=tNH7T0TxQy0C&amp;pg=SA9-PA32&amp;lpg=SA9-PA32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
In 1970, he received his bachelor's degree in physics and communications science, and later a master's degree in engineering from the [[University of Michigan]]. In 1978 he received a Ph.D. in [[computer science]] from the [[University of Utah College of Engineering|College of Engineering]] at the [[University of Utah]].

Blinn devised new methods to represent how objects and light interact in a three-dimensional virtual world, like [[environment mapping]] and [[bump mapping]]. He is well known for creating animation for three television series: [[Carl Sagan]]'s ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]''; ''[[Project MATHEMATICS!]]''; and the pioneering instructional graphics in ''[[The Mechanical Universe]]''. His simulations of the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] spacecraft visiting [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] have been seen widely.

Blinn was affiliated with the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] at the [[California Institute of Technology]] until 1995. Thereafter, he joined [[Microsoft Research]], where he was a graphics fellow until his retirement in 2009.  Blinn also worked at the [[New York Institute of Technology]] during the summer of 1976.

In fact, the headquarters of the Order have diplomatic extraterritoriality, ... but in addition, the Italian State recognizes the exercise, in the headquarters, of the prerogatives of sovereignty. This means that Italian sovereignty and Maltese sovereignty coexist without overlapping, because the Order exercises sovereign functions in a wider area than occurs in the diplomatic missions of the States for, although enjoying extraterritoriality, the guarantees deriving from the privilege of immunity [in those diplomatic missions] are constrained to a purely administrative area; the Order, instead, makes use of extraterritoriality to meet the very acts of sovereign self-determination that are the same as the States (legislative, judicial, administrative, financial acts). |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

'''Ludwig Haberlandt''' (1 February 1885 – 22 July 1932) is known as a father of [[hormonal contraception]]. In 1921 he carried out experiments on rabbits and he demonstrated a temporary hormonal contraception in a female by transplanting ovaries from a second, pregnant, animal.

His father was the eminent botanist, [[Gottlieb Haberlandt]], [[plant tissue culture]] theorist and visionary; his grandfather was the European 'soybean' pioneer and trailblazer [[Friedrich J. Haberlandt]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.soyinfocenter.com/HSS/friedrich_haberlandt1.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/n055345662r754w0/ | doi=10.1007/s00508-009-1280-x | volume=121 | title=Ludwig Haberlandt – A pioneer in hormonal contraception | year=2009 | journal=Wiener klinische Wochenschrift | pages=746–749 | last1 = Haberlandt | first1 = Edda}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930 he began clinical trials after successful production of a hormonal preparation, Infecundin®, by the [[Gedeon Richter|G. Richter]] Company in Budapest, Hungary. He ended his 1931 book, ''Die hormonale Sterilisierung des weiblichen Organismus'', with a visionary claim: 'Unquestionably, practical application of the temporary hormonal sterilization in women would markedly contribute to the ideal in human society already enunciated a generation earlier by [[Sigmund Freud]] (1898). Theoretically, one of the greatest triumphs of mankind would be the elevation of procreation into a voluntary and deliberate act.' He was hounded for his views on reproductive biology up to his death from either suicide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/n055345662r754w0/ | doi=10.1007/s00508-009-1280-x | volume=121 | title=Ludwig Haberlandt – A pioneer in hormonal contraception | year=2009 | journal=Wiener klinische Wochenschrift | pages=746–749 | last1 = Haberlandt | first1 = Edda}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/0548583t7788r763/ | doi=10.1007/s00508-009-1271-y | volume=121 | title=Ludwig Haberlandt – "Grandfather of the Pill" | year=2009 | journal=Wiener klinische Wochenschrift | pages=727–728 | last1 = Djerassi | first1 = Carl}}&lt;/ref&gt; or heart attack.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.inkling.com/read/clinical-gynecologic-endocrinology-infertility-8th/chapter-22/the-history-of-oral&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maldivesfish2.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Coral reefs form complex marine ecosystems with tremendous [[biodiversity]].]][[File:Blue Linckia Starfish.JPG|thumb|Here, we can see different types of [[starfish]], coral reefs and [[fish]]es in the [[Great Barrier Reef]].]]

'''Marine ecosystems''' are among the largest of [[Earth]]'s [[aquatic ecosystem]]s and are distinguished by waters that have a high salt content. These systems contrast with [[freshwater ecosystem]]s, which have a lower [[salt]] content. Marine waters cover more than 70% of the surface of the Earth and account for more than 97% of Earth's water supply&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oceanicinstitute.org/aboutoceans/aquafacts.html|title=Oceanic Institute|website=www.oceanicinstitute.org|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/habitats/ocean/|title=Ocean Habitats and Information|date=2017-01-05|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 90% of habitable space on Earth&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/ioc-oceans/focus-areas/rio-20-ocean/blueprint-for-the-future-we-want/marine-biodiversity/facts-and-figures-on-marine-biodiversity/|title=Facts and figures on marine biodiversity {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Marine ecosystems include nearshore systems, such as the [[salt marsh]]es, [[Mudflat|mudflats]], [[Seagrass|seagrass meadows]], [[mangrove]]s, rocky [[Intertidal zone|intertidal systems]] and [[coral reefs]]. They also extend outwards from the coast to include offshore systems, such as the surface [[ocean]], [[Pelagic zone|pelagic ocean]] waters, the [[deep sea]], [[Hydrothermal vent|oceanic hydrothermal vents]], and the [[Benthos|sea floor]]. Marine ecosystems are characterized by their associated biological community of interacting organisms and their physical environment.

== Types ==

=== Salt marsh ===
{{Main|Salt marsh}}
According to NOAA, salt marshes are defined as "coastal wetlands that are flooded and drained by salt water brought in by the tides".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/saltmarsh.html|title=What is a salt marsh?|last=Administration|first=US Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric|website=oceanservice.noaa.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; These marshy grounds are able to prevent flooding as well as help maintain water quality by absorbing rainwater and runoff that comes through the area.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Mangroves ===
{{Main|Mangrove}}
[[Mangrove|Mangroves]] are a compilation of different mangrove tree species living together near the coastline to create a forest. These mangrove forests have intricate root systems that provide habitat to many species and act as a buffer to soil erosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/mangroves.html|title=What is a mangrove forest?|last=Administration|first=US Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric|website=oceanservice.noaa.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intertidal zones ===
Intertidal zones are the areas that are visible during low tide and covered up by saltwater during high tide. In these zones simple organisms can be found in tide pools. These areas also have a higher salinity because salt is left diarrhea  has occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thewildclassroom.com/biomes/intertidal.html|title=Intertidal zone|website=www.thewildclassroom.com|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Estuaries ===
Estuaries occur where there is a noticeable change in salinity between saltwater and freshwater sources, for example, the confluence between a river and an ocean. Many organisms rely on this fragile ecosystem at least once during their life cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/estuary.html|title=What is an estuary?|last=Administration|first=US Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric|website=oceanservice.noaa.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lagoons ===
The National Geographic Society defines lagoons as a "shallow body of water protected from a larger body of water (usually the ocean) by sandbars, barrier islands, or coral reefs." There are two different types of lagoons: coastal lagoons and atoll lagoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/lagoon/|title=lagoon|last=Society|first=National Geographic|date=2011-01-21|work=National Geographic Society|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coral reefs ===
{{Main|Coral reef}}
[[Coral reef|Coral reefs]] are one of the most well-known marine ecosystems within the world. The largest being that of the Great Barrier Reef. These reefs are composed of large coral colonies of a variety of species living together. The corals form multiple symbiotic relationships with the organisms around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ocean.si.edu/corals-and-coral-reefs|title=Corals and Coral Reefs|date=2012-09-12|work=Ocean Portal {{!}} Smithsonian|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deep sea and sea floor ===
{{see|deep sea community}}
The deep sea contains up to 95% of the space occupied by living organisms.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ocean.si.edu/deep-sea|title=The Deep Sea|date=2012-07-24|work=Ocean Portal {{!}} Smithsonian|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with the sea floor (or benthic zone), these two areas have yet to be fully explored and have their organisms documented.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ecosystemexperts.weebly.com/the-benthic-zone.html|title=The Benthic Zone|website=Ecosystems|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecosystem services ==
{{Main|Ecosystem services}}
In addition to providing many benefits to the natural world, marine ecosystems also provide social, economic, and biological [[ecosystem services]] to humans. Pelagic marine systems regulate the global climate, contribute to the water cycle, maintain biodiversity, provide food and energy resources, and create opportunities for recreation and tourism&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.millenniumassessment.org/documents/document.287.aspx.pdf|title=Millenium Ecosystem Asessment, Marine Systems|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Economically, marine systems support billions of dollars worth of capture fisheries, aquaculture, offshore oil and gas, and trade and shipping.

Ecosystem services fall into multiple categories, including supporting services, provisioning services, regulating services, and cultural services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oceanwealth.org/ecosystem-services/|title=Ecosystem Services {{!}} Mapping Ocean Wealth|website=oceanwealth.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-03-24|title=Ecosystem services|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ecosystem_services&amp;oldid=832161260|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Threats to marine ecosystems ==
Although marine ecosystems provide essential ecosystem services, these systems face various threats&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icriforum.org/about-coral-reefs/status-and-threat-coral-reefs|title=Status of and Threat to Coral Reefs  {{!}} International Coral Reef Initiative|website=www.icriforum.org|language=en|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

=== Human exploitation and development ===
Coastal marine systems experience growing population pressure and nearly 40% of people in the world live within 100km of the coast&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.millenniumassessment.org/documents/document.288.aspx.pdf|title=Millennium Ecosystem Asessment, Coastal Systems|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Humans often aggregate near coastal habitats to take advantage of ecosystem services. For example, coastal capture fisheries from mangrove and coral reef habitats is estimated to be worth a minimum of $34 billion per year&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. Yet, many of these habitats are either marginally protected or not protected. Mangrove area has declined worldwide by more than one-third since 1950&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alongi|first=Daniel M.|date=September 2002|title=Present state and future of the world's mangrove forests|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/environmental-conservation/article/present-state-and-future-of-the-worlds-mangrove-forests/0E3D6B0DF6EE2E9DBD48582964AD492A|journal=Environmental Conservation|language=en|volume=29|issue=3|pages=331–349|doi=10.1017/S0376892902000231|issn=1469-4387}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and 60% of the world's coral reefs are now immediately or directly threatened&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/methodology/components/coral-reefs-area|title=Coral Reefs|website=Ocean Health Index|language=en|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wri.org/publication/reefs-risk-revisited|title=Reefs at Risk Revisited {{!}} World Resources Institute|website=www.wri.org|language=en|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Human development, aquaculture, and industrialization often lead to the destruction, replacement, or degradation of coastal habitats&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

Moving offshore, pelagic marine systems are directly threatened by overfishing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coll|first=Marta|last2=Libralato|first2=Simone|last3=Tudela|first3=Sergi|last4=Palomera|first4=Isabel|last5=Pranovi|first5=Fabio|date=2008-12-10|title=Ecosystem Overfishing in the Ocean|url=https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0003881|journal=PLoS ONE|language=en|volume=3|issue=12|pages=e3881|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0003881|issn=1932-6203|pmc=2587707|pmid=19066624}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Global fisheries landings peaked in the late 1980s, but are now declining, despite increasing fishing effort.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Fish biomass and average trophic level of fisheries landing are decreasing, leading to declines in marine biodiversity. In particular, local extinctions have led to declines in large, long-lived, slow-growing species, and those that have narrow geographic ranges &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. Biodiversity declines can lead to associated declines in ecosystem services.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2675">'''Neutron economy''' is defined as the ratio of an adjoint weighted average of the excess [[neutron]] production divided by an adjoint [[weighted average]] of the [[Nuclear fission|fission]] production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DOE Fundamentals handbook Vol1|url=http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2013/06/f2/h1019v1.pdf|work=h1019v1|publisher=US Department of Energy|accessdate=17 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319145623/http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2013/06/f2/h1019v1.pdf|archivedate=19 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DOE Fundamentals handbook Vol2|url=http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2013/06/f2/h1019v2.pdf|work=h1019v2|publisher=US Department of Energy|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distribution of neutron energies in a nuclear reactor differs from the fission [[neutron spectrum]] due to the slowing down of neutrons in elastic and inelastic collisions with fuel, coolant and construction material. Neutrons slow down in elastic and inelastic collisions, until they are absorbed via [[Neutron capture]] or lost by leakage. Neutron economy is the balanced account, in a reactor, of the neutrons created and the neutrons lost through absorption by non-fuel elements, resonance absorption by fuel, and leakage while fast and thermal energy ranges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nuceng.ca/ep4d3/ep4d3index.htm |title=Engineering Physics 4D3/6D3 - Nuclear Reactor Analysis |accessdate=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heavy Water]] is an extremely efficient moderator. As a result, reactors using heavy water, such as the [[CANDU]] also have a high neutron economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.candu.org/candu_reactors.html |title=CANDU Reactors |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225220611/http://www.candu.org/candu_reactors.html |archivedate=2012-02-25 |accessdate=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The quantity that indicates how much the neutron economy is out of balance is given the term '''Reactivity'''. If a reactor is exactly [[critical mass (nuclear)|critical]] - that is, the neutron production is exactly equal to neutron destruction - then the reactivity is zero. If the reactivity is positive - then the reactor is [[critical mass (nuclear)|supercritical]]. If the reactivity is negative - then the reactor is [[critical mass (nuclear)|subcritical]].

However the term '''neutron economy''' is used not just for the instantaneous reactivity of a reactor but also to describe the overall efficiency of a [[nuclear reactor]] design.

{{History of war}}
In the field of [[military theory]], the '''operational level of war''' (also called the '''operational art''', as derived from {{lang-ru|оперативное искусство}}, or the '''operational warfare''') represents the level of command that connects the details of [[military tactics|tactics]] with the goals of [[strategy]].&lt;ref&gt;p.24, Simpkin&lt;/ref&gt;

In Joint U.S. military [[Military doctrine|doctrine]], '''operational art''' is "the cognitive approach by commanders and staffs—supported by their skill, knowledge, experience, creativity, and judgment—to develop strategies, campaigns, and operations to organize and employ military forces by integrating ends, ways, and means."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://armypubs.army.mil/doctrine/DR_pubs/dr_a/pdf/adrp5_0.pdf|title=Army Doctrine Reference Publication (ADRP) 5-0, The Operations Process|last=Department of the Army|first=|publisher=Government Printing Office|year=May 2012|isbn=|location=Washington, DC|pages=2–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It correlates political needs and military power. Operational art is defined by its military-political scope, not by force size, scale of operations or degree of effort. Likewise, operational art provides theory and skills, and the operational level permits doctrinal structure and process.{{sfn|Robinson|1997}}

During the 18th and early 19th centuries, the synonymous term '''grand tactics''' (or, less frequently, ''maneuver tactics''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hess |first1=Earl |title=Civil War Infantry Tactics: Training, Combat, and Small-Unit Effectiveness |date=2015 |publisher=Louisiana State University Press |location=Baton Rouge |isbn=978-0-8071-5937-8 |page=xxi |edition=fourth }}&lt;/ref&gt;) was often used to describe the manoeuvres of troops not tactically [[engagement (military)|engaged]], while in the late 19th century to the [[First World War]] and through the Second World War, the term '''minor strategy''' was used by some military commentators.&lt;ref&gt;p.218, Jablonsky&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;p.28, Whitman&lt;/ref&gt; Confusion over terminology was brought up in professional military publications, that sought to identify "...slightly different shades of meaning, such as tactics, major tactics, minor tactics, grand strategy, major strategy, and minor strategy".&lt;ref&gt;p.3, Bundel&lt;/ref&gt; The term was not widely used in the United States or Britain before 1980–1981,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/?id=hLBANX5rTIsC&amp;pg=PA21 |title=The German 1918 Offensives: A Case Study in the Operational Level of War |isbn=9781134252251 |author1=Zabecki |first1=David T |pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QTFLUTXixXEC |publisher=DIANE Publishing |page=v |title=The Operational Level of War |isbn=9781428915749}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sKGK_t8mYKAC&amp;lpg=PA175&amp;pg=PA175 |page=175 |title=Strategy and History |isbn=9780887380655 |author1=Luttwak |first1=Edward |year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; when it became much discussed and started to enter military doctrines and officer combat training courses.&lt;ref&gt;p. 111, Stone&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
Operational art comprises four essential elements: time, space, means and purpose. Each element is found in greater complexity at the operational level than at the tactical or strategic level. This is true, in part, because operational art must consider and incorporate more of the strategic and tactical levels than those levels must absorb from the operational level. Although much can be gained by examining the four elements independently, it is only when they are viewed together that operational art reveals its intricate fabric.{{sfn|Robinson|1997}}

The challenge of operational art is to establish a four-element equilibrium that permits the optimal generation and application of military power in achieving the political goal. Viewing time, space, means and purpose as a whole requires great skill in organizing, weighing and envisioning masses of complex, often contradictory factors. These factors often exist for extended periods, over great distances and with shifting mixes of players, systems and beliefs, pursuing political goals which may or may not be clear, cogent or settled. Compounding factors, such as the opponent's actions, create further ambiguity.{{sfn|Robinson|1997}}

===Mission analysis===
The operational-level strategist possesses numerous tools to frame and guide their thinking, but chief among these are mission analysis and end state. Mission analysis answers the question "What is to be accomplished?" Through mission analysis, the operational-level planner fuses political aims and military objectives. In so doing, the planner determines what application of military force will create military power to achieve the political purpose. Subordinate processes here include defining objectives and centers of gravity, but excessive dependence on analytical mechanisms can create false security. The final test rewards success, not the quality of the argument. Conversely, the planner cannot hope to "feel" a way to victory—complexity demands an integration of thought and effort.{{sfn|Robinson|1997}}

===End state===
End state answers the question "What will constitute success?" The campaign end state is not merely a desired status quo of the military goal. It also establishes a touchstone for the tactical, operational and strategic levels. The end state manifests the intended results of military power and exposes any limitations. Indeed, an achievable end state may require the employment of nonmilitary elements of national power. As such, it recognizes that military power alone may not be capable of attaining political success.{{sfn|Robinson|1997}}

==Skills required==
An operational-level strategy must continually inventory and weigh time, space, means and purpose, extrapolating from them outcomes and likelihood. To accomplish this, practitioners need both skill and theory, experience and knowledge. At the operational level, skills and experience must usually be developed indirectly, through formal training, military history and real-world practicum.{{sfn|Robinson|1997}}

Success at the tactical level is no guarantee of success at the operational level: mastery of operational art demands strategic skills. Without a strong grounding in the theory and application of operational art, a successful tactician has little hope of making the demanding leap from tactics. The operational level strategist must see clearly and expansively from the foxhole into the corridors of national or coalition authority. They must be aware of the plausibility and coherence of strategic aims, national will and the players who decide them. Successful operational art charts a clear, unbroken path from the individual soldier's efforts to the state or coalition's goals.{{sfn|Robinson|1997}}

== Role in historiography ==

While the emerging corpus of operational art and the establishment of a specifically operational level of war are relatively new, in practice operational art has existed throughout recorded history. Peoples and commanders have long pursued political goals through military actions, and one can examine campaigns of any period from the [[existential]] perspective of operational art. Current schools of thought on the operational art share the fundamental view that military success can be measured only in the attainment of political-strategic aims, and thus historians can analyze any war in terms of operational art.{{sfn|Robinson|1997}}

In the case of [[World War II]] analysis, the [[Wehrmacht]] did not use the operational level as a formal doctrinal concept during the campaigns of 1939–1945. While personnel within the German forces knew of operational art, awareness and practice was limited principally to [[German General Staff | general-staff]] trained officers. Nevertheless, the existential nature of operational art means that examining a campaign or an operation against political aims is valid irrespective of the doctrine or structures of the period. Thus the elements of operational art—time, space, means and purpose—can illuminate thoughts and actions of any era, regardless of the prevailing contemporary doctrine or structure.{{sfn|Robinson|1997}}

The '''philosophy of social science''' is the study of the logic, methods, and foundations of social sciences such as psychology, economics, and political science. Philosophers of social science are concerned with the differences and similarities between the social and the [[natural science]]s, causal relationships between social phenomena, the possible existence of social laws, and the [[ontology|ontological]] significance of [[structure and agency]].

== Auguste Comte and positivism ==
{{Main|Auguste Comte|Positivism}}
Comte first described the epistemological perspective of positivism in ''[[The Course in Positive Philosophy]]'', a series of texts published between 1830 and 1842. These texts were followed by the 1848 work, ''[[A General View of Positivism]]'' (published in English in 1865). The first three volumes of the ''Course'' dealt chiefly with the physical sciences already in existence ([[mathematics]], [[astronomy]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]]), whereas the latter two emphasised the inevitable coming of [[social science]]. Observing the circular dependence of theory and observation in science, and classifying the sciences in this way, Comte may be regarded as the first [[philosopher of science]] in the modern sense of the term.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/ Stanford Encyclopaedia: Auguste Comte&lt;/ref&gt; For him, the physical sciences had necessarily to arrive first, before humanity could adequately channel its efforts into the most challenging and complex "Queen science" of human society itself. His ''View of Positivism'' would therefore set-out to define, in more detail, the empirical goals of sociological method.

Comte offered an [[social evolutionism|account of social evolution]], proposing that society undergoes three phases in its quest for the truth according to a general 'law of three stages'. The idea bears some similarity to [[Karl Marx|Marx's]] view that human society would progress toward a [[communist]] peak. This is perhaps unsurprising as both were profoundly influenced by the early [[Utopian socialist]], [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], who was at one time Comte's teacher and mentor. Both Comte and Marx intended to develop, scientifically, a new secular ideology in the wake of European [[secularisation]].

The early sociology of [[Herbert Spencer]] came about broadly as a reaction to Comte.  Writing after various developments in evolutionary biology, Spencer attempted (in vain) to reformulate the discipline in what we might now describe as [[social Darwinism|socially Darwinistic]] terms (although Spencer was a proponent of [[Lamarckism]] rather than Darwinism).

The modern academic discipline of sociology began with the work of Émile Durkheim (1858–1917). While Durkheim rejected much of the detail of Comte's philosophy, he retained and refined its method, maintaining that the social sciences are a logical continuation of the natural ones into the realm of human activity, and insisting that they may retain the same objectivity, rationalism, and approach to causality.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"&gt;Wacquant, Loic.  1992.  "Positivism." In Bottomore, Tom and William Outhwaite, ed., ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Social Thought''&lt;/ref&gt; Durkheim set up the first European department of sociology at the [[University of Bordeaux]] in 1895.  In the same year he argued, in ''[[The Rules of Sociological Method]]'' (1895):&lt;ref name="autogenerated2000"&gt;Gianfranco Poggi (2000). ''Durkheim.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; "[o]ur main goal is to extend scientific rationalism to human conduct... What has been called our positivism is but a consequence of this rationalism."&lt;ref name="DinW"&gt;Durkheim, Emile. 1895.  ''The Rules of Sociological Method''.  Cited in Wacquant (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; Durkheim's seminal monograph ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]'' (1897), a case study of suicide rates amongst [[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] populations, distinguished sociological analysis from [[psychology]] or philosophy.

The positivist perspective, however, has been associated with '[[scientism]]'; the view that the methods of the natural sciences may be [[absolute (philosophy)|applied to all]] areas of investigation, be it philosophical, social scientific, or otherwise. Among most social scientists and historians, orthodox positivism has long since fallen out of favor. Today, practitioners of both social and physical sciences recognize the distorting effect of [[observer bias]] and structural limitations. This scepticism has been facilitated by a general weakening of deductivist accounts of science by philosophers such as Thomas Kuhn, and new philosophical movements such as [[critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]] and [[neopragmatism]]. Positivism has also been espoused by '[[Technocracy|technocrats]]' who believe in the inevitability of [[social progress]] through science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;Schunk, ''Learning Theories: An Educational Perspective, 5th'', 315&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher-sociologist [[Jürgen Habermas]] has critiqued pure [[instrumental rationality]] as meaning that scientific-thinking becomes something akin to [[ideology]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William, 1988 ''Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers'', Polity Press (Second Edition 2009), {{ISBN|978-0-7456-4328-1}} p.68&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Durkheim]], [[Marx]], and [[Max Weber|Weber]] are more typically cited as the fathers of contemporary social science. In [[psychology]], a positivistic approach has historically been favoured in [[behaviourism]].

==Epistemology==
In any discipline, there will always be a number of underlying philosophical predispositions in the projects of scientists. Some of these predispositions involve the nature of social knowledge itself, the nature of social reality, and the locus of human control in action.&lt;ref&gt;Cote, James E. and Levine, Charles G. (2002). ''Identity formation, Agency, and Culture'', Mahwah, New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Intellectuals have disagreed about the extent to which the social sciences should mimic the methods used in the natural sciences. The founding [[positivism|positivists]] of the social sciences argued that social phenomena can and should be studied through conventional [[scientific methods]]. This position is closely allied with [[scientism]], [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] and [[physicalism]]; the doctrine that all phenomena are ultimately reducible to physical entities and physical laws. Opponents of naturalism, including advocates of the ''[[verstehen]]'' method, contended that there is a need for an interpretive approach to the study of human action, a technique radically different from natural science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy|editor=Robert Audi|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|year=1999|edition=Second|pages=704|isbn=0-521-63722-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental task for the philosophy of social science has thus been to question the extent to which [[positivism]] may be characterized as 'scientific' in relation to fundamental [[epistemological]] foundations. These debates also rage ''within'' contemporary social sciences with regard to [[subjectivity]], [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]], [[intersubjectivity]] and practicality in the conduct of theory and research. Philosophers of social science examine further epistemologies and methodologies, including [[Philosophical realism|realism]], [[critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]], [[instrumentalism]], [[structural functionalism|functionalism]], [[structuralism]], [[Antipositivism|interpretivism]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], and [[post-structuralism]].

Though essentially all major social scientists since the late 19th century have accepted that the discipline faces challenges that are different from those of the [[natural science]]s, the ability to determine [[causality|causal relationships]] invokes the same discussions held in science [[meta-theory]]. Positivism has sometimes met with caricature as a breed of naive empiricism, yet the word has a rich history of applications stretching from [[Auguste Comte|Comte]] to the work of the [[Vienna Circle]] and beyond. By the same token, if positivism is able to identify causality, then it is open to the same [[critical rationalism|critical rationalist]] non-[[justificationism]] presented by [[Karl Popper]], which may itself be disputed through [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s conception of epistemic [[paradigm shift]].

Early German hermeneuticians such as [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] pioneered the distinction between natural and social science ('[[Geisteswissenschaft]]'). This tradition greatly informed [[Max Weber]] and [[Georg Simmel]]'s [[antipositivism]], and continued with [[critical theory]].&lt;ref name="Outhwaite, William 2009 p.22"&gt;Outhwaite, William, 1988 ''Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers'', Polity Press (Second Edition 2009), {{ISBN|978-0-7456-4328-1}} p.22&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1960s, a general weakening of deductivist accounts of science has grown side-by-side with critiques of "[[scientism]]", or 'science ''as ideology'''.&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William, 1988 ''Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers'', Polity Press (Second Edition 2009), {{ISBN|978-0-7456-4328-1}} p.19&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jürgen Habermas]] argues, in his ''On the Logic of the Social Sciences'' (1967), that "the positivist thesis of unified science, which assimilates all the sciences to a natural-scientific model, fails because of the intimate relationship between the social sciences and history, and the fact that they are based on a situation-specific understanding of meaning that can be explicated only hermeneutically … access to a symbolically prestructured reality cannot be gained by observation alone." &lt;ref name="Outhwaite, William 2009 p.22"/&gt; ''Verstehende'' social theory has been the concern of phenomenological works, such as [[Alfred Schütz]] ''Phenomenology of the Social World'' (1932) and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]]'s ''[[Truth and Method]]'' (1960).&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William, 1988 ''Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers'', Polity Press (Second Edition 2009), {{ISBN|978-0-7456-4328-1}} p.23&lt;/ref&gt; Phenomenology would later prove influential in the subject-centred theory of the [[post-structuralists]].

The mid-20th-century [[linguistic turn]] led to a rise in highly philosophical sociology, as well as so-called "[[Postmodernism|postmodern]]" perspectives on the social acquisition of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Giddens, A |title=Sociology |publisher=Polity |location=Oxford, UK |pages=714|year=2006|isbn= 0-7456-3379-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; One notable critique of social science is found in [[Peter Winch]]'s Wittgensteinian text ''The Idea of Social Science and its Relation to Philosophy'' (1958). [[Michel Foucault]] provides a potent critique in his [[The Order of Things|archaeology of the human sciences]], though Habermas and [[Richard Rorty]] have both argued that Foucault merely replaces one such system of thought with another.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Habermas. ''Taking Aim at the Heart of the Present'' in Hoy, D (eds) 'Foucault: A critical reader' Basil Blackwell. Oxford, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Rorty. ''Foucault and Epistemology'' in Hoy, D (eds) 'Foucault: A critical reader' Basil Blackwell. Oxford, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

One underlying problem for the [[social psychology|social psychologist]] is whether studies can or should ultimately be understood in terms of the meaning and consciousness behind social action, as with [[folk psychology]], or whether more objective, natural, materialist, and behavioral facts are [[Eliminative materialism|to be given exclusive study]]. This problem is especially important for those within the social sciences who study qualitative mental phenomena, such as [[consciousness]], associative meanings, and [[mental representation]]s, because a rejection of the study of meanings would lead to the reclassification of such research as non-scientific. Influential traditions like psychodynamic theory and symbolic interactionism may be the first victims of such a paradigm shift. The philosophical issues lying in wait behind these different positions have led to commitments to certain kinds of methodology which have sometimes bordered on the partisan. Still, many researchers have indicated a lack of patience for overly dogmatic proponents of one method or another.&lt;ref&gt;Slife, B.D. and Gantt, E.E. (1999) Methodological pluralism: a framework for psychotherapy research. Journal of Clinical Psychology, 55(12), pp1453–1465.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social research remains extremely common and effective ''in practise'' with respect to political institutions and businesses. [[Michael Burawoy]] has marked the difference between [[public sociology]], which is focused firmly on practical applications (though see e.g. Thibodeaux, 2016&lt;ref&gt;Thibodeaux, Jarrett. 2016. Production as Social Change: Policy Sociology as a Public Good. ''Sociological Spectrum''. 36 (3): 183-190&lt;/ref&gt;), and ''academic'' or ''professional'' sociology, which involves dialogue amongst other social scientists and philosophers.

==Ontology==
[[Structure and agency]] forms an enduring debate in social theory: "Do social structures determine an individual's behaviour or does human agency?" In this context '[[agency (sociology)|agency]]' refers to the capacity of individuals to act independently and make free choices, whereas '[[social structure|structure]]' refers to factors which limit or affect the choices and actions of individuals (such as social class, religion, gender, ethnicity, and so on). Discussions over the primacy of structure or agency relate to the very core of social ontology ("What is the social world made of?", "What is a cause in the social world, and what is an effect?"). One attempt to reconcile postmodern critiques with the overarching project of social science has been the development, particularly in Britain, of [[critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]]. For critical realists such as [[Roy Bhaskar]], traditional positivism commits an 'epistemic fallacy' by failing to address the ontological conditions which make science possible: that is, structure and agency itself.

'''Political opportunity theory''', sometimes also known as the '''political process theory''' or '''political opportunity structure''', is an approach of [[social movements]] heavily influenced by [[political sociology]]. It argues that success or failure of social movements is primarily affected by political opportunities. Social theorists Peter Eisinger, [[Sidney Tarrow]], David Meyer and [[Doug McAdam]] are considered among the most prominent supporters of this theory.

==Theory==
Three vital components for movement formation are:
# '''Insurgent Consciousness:''' Certain members of society feel deprived, mistreated, and have grievances directed at a system that they perceive as unjust (see also [[deprivation theory]]).&lt;ref name=etal&gt;Ryan Cragun, Deborah Cragun, et al, ''Introduction to Sociology'', Blacksleet River, {{ISBN|1-4499-7747-2}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rJFHTucmPTMC&amp; Google Print, p.233-234]&lt;/ref&gt; When a collective sense of injustice develops, it motivates people to become movement members.&lt;ref name=etal/&gt; Movement activists do not choose their goals at random, it is the political context which stresses certain grievances around which movements organize.&lt;ref name=dsm/&gt;
# '''Organizational Strength:''' Similar to the main argument of the [[resource mobilization theory]], the argument here is that the social movement must have strong and efficient leadership and sufficient resources.&lt;ref name=etal/&gt; The political opportunity theory has much in common with the related [[resource mobilization]] theory, particularly when it is seen as focusing on mobilization of resources ''external'' to the movement.&lt;ref name=t/&gt; Associated and indigenous organizations also play a major role in recruiting and motivating actors to join and participate within social movements. Often, the rise of a movement merges with other preexisting and highly organized blocs of individuals who lend the movement resources and support. The more heavily that individuals are integrated into disconnected but otherwise mobile communities, the higher the likelihood of those communities merging and lending support to causes that their members are active in.
# '''Political Opportunities:''' If the existing political system is vulnerable to a challenge, it creates an opportunity for others – like the movement members – to issue such a challenge and try to use this opportune time to push through a social change.&lt;ref name=etal/&gt; This vulnerability can be the result of:
## Increasing [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|political pluralism]]
## Decline in [[political repression|repression]]
## Division within [[elite]]s (particularly when it grows to a point where some support organized opposition)
## Increased political enfranchisement&lt;ref name=etal/&gt;

Political opportunity theory argues that the actions of the activists are dependent on the existence – or lack – of a specific political opportunity.&lt;ref name=dsm&gt;[[David S. Meyer]], ''Protest and Political Opportunities'', Annual Review of Sociology, Vol. 30: 125-145 (Volume publication date August 2004), {{doi|10.1146/annurev.soc.30.012703.110545}} [http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146%2Fannurev.soc.30.012703.110545]&lt;/ref&gt; There are various definitions of political opportunity, but Meyer (2004) stresses that of Tarrow (1998):
{{quote|"consistent – but not necessarily formal or permanent – dimensions of the political struggle that encourage people to engage in contentious politics".&lt;ref name=t&gt;Tarrow S. 1998. Power in Movement. New York: Cambridge Univ. Press. 2nd ed.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From these three components emerges what proponent Doug McAdam terms cognitive liberation, the ability for those active in political protest to recognize their collective strength and take advantage of political opportunities as they become available to them. As political opposition to the movement's demands weakens, members may feel a collective sense of symbolic efficacy, the capacity to enact significant change within the political arena. This opens up significant opportunities for movements to both recruit members and mobilize under a concentrated and effective cycle of demands.

Over time these broad socioeconomic processes develop, maintain and cause decline within the movement. A movement, once developed, may be affected by the level of social control placed on it, which in turn affects its ability to mobilize and maintain members. For when the movement's demands are portrayed as underdeveloped or unattractive they risk losing or failing to receive support from outside institutions.

Furthermore, movements may be affected by oligarchization, when a class of individuals within the movement work to ensure the maintenance of the movement itself rather than a continual push for collective goals, or cooptation, when outside support is garnered for the movement at the same time as it is forced to sacrifice its goals to meet the demands of these supporting institutions. This in turn may lead to the loss of indigenous support, and along with it many of the supporting grassroots organizations that were able to quickly mobilize members at the onset of the movement.

Meyer (2004) credits Eisinger (1973) with first use of the political opportunity theory framed in such a way (traces of which, of course, go further back).&lt;ref name=dsm/&gt; Eisinger asked why in the 1960s the level of riots about race and poverty varied between different places in the United States and notes that lack of visible openings for participation of repressed or discouraged dissident made riots more likely. Thus the inability to legally air grievances was the political opportunity which led to organization and mobilization of movements expressing their grievances by rioting.&lt;ref&gt;Eisinger P . 1973 . The conditions of protest behavior in American cities . Am. Polit. Sci. Rev. 81 : 11 – 28&lt;/ref&gt;

Meyer (2004) in his overview of political opportunity theory noted that this broader context can affect:
* "mobilizing",
* "advancing particular claims rather than others",
* "cultivating some alliances rather than others",
* "employing particular political strategies and tactics rather than others", and
* "affecting mainstream institutional politics and policy".&lt;ref name=dsm/&gt;

A key advantage of the theory is that it explains why social movements emerge and/or increase their activity at a given time.&lt;ref name=etal/&gt; When there are no political opportunities, simply having grievances (organizational consciousness) and resources will not be enough.&lt;ref name=etal/&gt; Only when all three of these components are present, the movement has a chance to succeed.&lt;ref name=etal/&gt;

Along with social movement research, Thibodeaux&lt;ref&gt;Thibodeaux, Jarrett. 2014. "Three Versions of Constructionism and their Reliance on Social Conditions in Social Problems Research". ''Sociology''. 48(4): 829-837.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that political opportunity structures should be used when analyzing the importance and meaning of social problems.

==Vs. political structure==
Within the [[structure and agency]] debate, actions of activists (agents) can only be understood when seen in the broader context of political opportunities (structure).&lt;ref name=dsm/&gt; The term structure has been used to characterize political opportunities in older scholarship.&lt;ref name=t/&gt; A political opportunity structure has been defined as the circumstances surrounding a political landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Jereon Gunning, Hamas, democracy, religion and violence&lt;/ref&gt; However, Tarrow – who has used this term in his earlier publications himself – now argues it is misleading, as most opportunities need to be perceived, and are situational, not structural.&lt;ref name=t/&gt; Political opportunity structures are prone to change and can alter in days (or last for decades). Demographics and socioeconomic factors create "structure" which affects political actors.

==Political mediation model==
One side model based on the political opportunity theory is known as the political mediation model. The political mediation model focuses on how the political context affects the strategic choices of the political actors.&lt;ref name=etal/&gt; This model goes beyond looking at whether the movements just succeeded or failed, and analyzes other consequences, including unintentional, as well as [[collective benefits]].&lt;ref name=etal/&gt;

Opposite of political opportunity is a political constraint.

==Criticism==
The political process model has been criticized both structurally and conceptually. Critics suggest that political process theorists utilize overly broad definitions as to what constitute political opportunities, and those definitions vary widely based on the historical context of the social movement itself. Furthermore, as political process theory frames movements as legally or politically detached from the state, it ignores movements that form out of cultural solidarity or do not directly stand in opposition to extant rules or regulations. Critics contend that theorists place too great an emphasis on the role of social networks while often almost entirely ignoring the cultural underpinnings that allow these networks to form and subsist.
In response to some criticisms, [[Doug McAdam]], [[Sidney Tarrow]] and [[Charles Tilly]] proposed the Dynamics of Contention research program, which focuses on identifying mechanisms to explain political opportunities, rather than relying on an abstract structure.&lt;ref&gt;McAdam D, Tarrow S, Tilly C. 2001. Dynamics of Contention. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
[[MoveOn.org]] is an organization that started in 1998&lt;ref name="What is MoveOn.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://front.moveon.org/about/|title=What is MoveOn.org?|website=MoveOn.Org {{!}} Democracy In Action|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; which still operates to this day. MoveOn.org is a progressive&lt;ref name="What is MoveOn.org"/&gt; organization that specifically centers around political issues. MoveOn.org allows viewers to start their own petitions, a form of [[collective behavior]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.peoi.org/Courses/Coursesen/socfwk/ch/ch21a.html|title=Chapter 21 Section A Types of Collective Behavior|website=www.peoi.org|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; which could potentially start a social movement of its own. MoveOn.org also includes other petitions and political articles and video clips on the front page&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://front.moveon.org/|title=MoveOn.Org {{!}} Democracy In Action|website=MoveOn.Org {{!}} Democracy In Action|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; for people to sign and view as a mechanism for people to assemble over a similar issue, perpetuating the concept of [[solidarity]], or a sense of collective identity over political discourse. MoveOn.org can also be applied to [[Resource mobilization|resource mobilization theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://healthcommcapacity.org/resource-mobilization-important/|title=What is Resource Mobilization and Why is it so Important? - Health Communication Capacity Collaborative - Social and Behavior Change Communication|date=2014-10-20|website=Health Communication Capacity Collaborative - Social and Behavior Change Communication|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the fact that MoveOn.org is a site that is meant to assemble people, which adds to the strength and success of the organization.

[[Image:IBM1442.corestore.jpg|thumb|IBM 1442 card reader/punch for 80 column cards]]

A '''computer punched card reader''' or just '''computer card reader''' is a [[computer input device]] used to read [[Computer program|computer programs]] in either source or executable form and [[Data (computing)|data]] from [[punched cards]]. A '''computer card punch''' is a computer output device that punches holes in cards. Sometimes computer punch card readers were combined with computer card punches and, later, other devices to form multifunction machines.
It is a input device and also an output device.
Most early computers, such as the [[ENIAC]], and the [[IBM Naval Ordnance Research Calculator|IBM NORC]], provided for punched card input/output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Nancy | last = Stern | title = From ENIAC to UNIVAC: An Appraisal of the Eckert-Mauchly Computers | publisher = Digital Press | year = 1981 | isbn = 0-932376-14-2 |page=50 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Card readers and punches, either connected to computers or in [[off-line]] card to/from [[magnetic tape]] configurations, were ubiquitous through the mid-1970s.

Punched cards had been in use since the 1890s; their technology was mature and reliable. Card readers and punches developed for [[Unit record equipment|punched card machines]] were readily adaptable for computer use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/701/701_1415bx11.html The IBM 711 Punched Card Reader's card-feeding mechanism was similar to the IBM 402's card-feeding mechanism]&lt;/ref&gt; Businesses were familiar with storing data on punched cards and [[keypunch]] machines were widely employed. Punched cards were a better fit than other 1950s technologies, such as [[magnetic tape]], for some computer applications as individual cards could easily be updated without having to access a computer.

==Operation==
The standard measure of speed is ''cards per minute'', abbreviated CPM: The number of cards which can be read or punched in one minute. Card reader models vary from 300 to around 2,000&amp;nbsp;CPM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roy|first1=Gautam|title=Computer Studies for Engineering Students|date=2007|publisher=Allied Publishers Limited|location=Mumbai, IN|isbn=9788184242119|page=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ke1ntekzR-kC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=%222000+cards+per+minute%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwir5YzNsJfOAhWGlx4KHXLSBvgQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%222000%20cards%20per%20minute%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=July 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; If all columns of an 80 column card encode information this translates to approximately 2,500 characters per second (CPS).

Cards may be read using mechanical ''brushes'' that make an electrical contact for a hole, and no contact if no punch, or [[photoelectric]] sensors that function similarly. Timing relates the signals to the position on the card.  Cards may be read serially, column by column, or in parallel, row by row.

Card punches necessarily run more slowly to allow for the mechanical action of punching, up to around 300&amp;nbsp;CPM or 400 characters per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=IBM Corporation|title=IBM 3505 Card Reader and IBM 3525 Card Punch Subsystem|date=1971|url=https://archive.org/stream/bitsavers_ibm35xxGA2rand3525CardPunchSubsystemMar71_5020408/GA21-9124-1_3505_Card_Reader_and_3525_Card_Punch_Subsystem_Mar71#page/n1/mode/1up|accessdate=July 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some card devices offer the ability to ''interpret'', or print a line on the card displaying the data that is punched. Typically this slows down the punch operation. Many punches read the card just punched and compare its actual contents to the original data punched, to protect against punch errors. Some devices allow data to be read from a card and additional information to be punched into the same card.

Readers and punches include a ''hopper'' for input cards and one or more ''stackers'' for cards read or punched.  A function called ''stacker select'' allows the controlling computer to choose which stacker a card just read or punched will be placed into.

[[File:IBM1130CopyCard.agr.jpg|thumb|[[Binary code|Binary]] punched card.]]
For some computer applications, [[Binary numeral system|binary]] formats were used, where each hole represented a single binary digit (or "[[bit]]"), every column (or row) is treated as a simple bitfield, and every combination of holes is permitted. For example, the IBM 711 card reader used with the [[IBM 700/7000 series#Scientific Architecture (704/709/7090/7094)|704/709/7090/7094 series]] scientific computers treated every row as two 36-bit words, ignoring 8 columns. (The specific 72 columns used were selectable using a [[plugboard]] control panel, which is almost always wired to select columns 1–72.) Sometimes the ignored columns (usually 73–80) were used to contain a sequence number for each card, so the card deck could be sorted to the correct order in case it was dropped. An alternative format, used by the [[IBM 704]]'s IBM 714 native card reader, is referred to as Column Binary or Chinese Binary, and used 3 columns for each 36-bit word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Thelen | first = Ed | title = Chinese Binary | url = http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/JVG-ChineseBinary.doc | accessdate = 12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later computers, such as the [[IBM 1130]] or [[System/360]], used every column. The [[IBM 1401]]'s card reader could be used in Column Binary mode, which stored two characters in every column, or one 36-bit word in three columns when used as input device for other computers. However, most of the older card punches were not intended to punch more than 3 holes in a column. The ''multipunch'' key is used to produce binary cards, or other characters not on the keyboard.&lt;ref name="IBM 22-8484-3"&gt;{{cite book|author1=IBM|title=IBM Operator's Guide, 22-8484-3 1955 Type 24 Card Punch|date=1955|publisher=IBM|accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Quasinormal modes''' ('''QNM''') are the modes of [[energy]] dissipation of a perturbed object or field, ''i.e.'' they describe perturbations of a field that decay in time.

==Example==
A familiar example is the perturbation (gentle tap) of a wine glass with a knife: the glass begins to ring, it rings with a set, or superposition, of its natural frequencies — its modes of sonic energy dissipation. One could call these modes ''[[Normal mode|normal]]'' if the glass went on ringing forever. Here the amplitude of oscillation decays in time, so we call its modes ''quasi-normal''. To a high degree of accuracy, '''quasinormal''' ringing can be approximated by

:&lt;math&gt;\psi(t) \approx e^{-\omega^{\prime\prime}t}\cos\omega^{\prime}t&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\psi\left(t\right)&lt;/math&gt; is the amplitude of oscillation,
&lt;math&gt;\omega^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt; is the frequency, and
&lt;math&gt;\omega^{\prime\prime}&lt;/math&gt; is the decay rate.  The quasinormal
frequency is described by two numbers,

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \left(\omega^{\prime} , \omega^{\prime\prime}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

or, more compactly

:&lt;math&gt;\psi\left(t\right) \approx \operatorname{Re}(e^{i\omega t})&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\omega =\omega^{\prime} + i\omega^{\prime\prime}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\omega}&lt;/math&gt; is what is commonly referred to as the
'''quasinormal mode frequency'''. It is a [[complex number]] with two pieces of information: real part is the temporal oscillation; imaginary part is the temporal, [[exponential decay]].

::&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:qnm.jpg]] --&gt;

In certain cases the amplitude of the wave decays quickly, to follow the decay for a longer time one may plot &lt;math&gt;\log\left|\psi(t)\right|&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:log(abs(qnm)).jpg]] --&gt;
{{listen |filename=qnm.ogg |title=The sound of quasinormal ringing |description=}}

==Mathematical Physics==
In [[theoretical physics]], a '''quasinormal mode''' is a formal solution of linearized [[differential equation]]s (such as the linearized equations of [[general relativity]] constraining perturbations around a [[black hole]] solution) with a complex [[eigenvalue]] ([[frequency]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Quasinormal modes of black holes: From astrophysics to string theory|url = http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/RevModPhys.83.793|journal = Reviews of Modern Physics|date = 2011-07-11|pages = 793–836|volume = 83|issue = 3|doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.83.793|first = R.

[[Black hole]]s have many quasinormal modes (also: ringing modes) that describe the exponential decrease of asymmetry of the black hole in time as it evolves towards the perfect spherical shape.

Recently, the properties of quasinormal modes have been tested in the context of the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]]. Also, the asymptotic behavior of quasinormal modes was proposed to be related to the [[Immirzi parameter]] in [[loop quantum gravity]], but convincing arguments have not been found yet.

==Biophysics==

In computational biophysics, quasinormal modes, also called quasiharmonic modes, are derived from diagonalizing the matrix of equal-time correlations of atomic fluctuations.

The '''Research Data Alliance''' ('''RDA''') is a research community organization started in 2013 by the [[European Commission]], the American [[National Science Foundation]] and [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]], and the Australian [[Department of Industry, Innovation, Climate Change, Science, Research and Tertiary Education|Department of Innovation]]. Its mission is to build the social and technical bridges to enable open sharing of data.&lt;ref name="rdawebsite"&gt;Research Data Alliance (2018) [https://rd-alliance.org/about-rda "About RDA"]. Web Page. Accessed 2018-04-27&lt;/ref&gt; The RDA vision is researchers and innovators openly sharing data across technologies, disciplines, and countries to address the grand challenges of society.&lt;ref name="rdawebsite"&gt;Research Data Alliance (2018) [https://rd-alliance.org/about-rda "About RDA"]. Web Page. Accessed 2018-04-27&lt;/ref&gt; The RDA is a major recipient of support in the form of grants from its constituent members' governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

As of July 2018, the RDA has over 7,100 individual members from 137 countries.&lt;ref name="whoisrda"&gt;Research Data Alliance (2018) [https://www.rd-alliance.org/about-rda/who-rda.html "Who is RDA?"]. Web Page. Accessed 2018-08-06&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
The RDA's main vehicle for outputs are 18-month long working groups that generate recommendations aimed at the RDA community. In addition to working groups, interest groups with no fixed lifetime can produce either informal or "supported" outputs which carry some degree of RDA endorsement. 

== Meetings ==

The RDA organises two major plenary conferences a year that are often co-located within other international data sharing initiatives such as the 12th RDA plenary being part of "[http://internationaldataweek.org International Data Week], 2018" in Gaborone, co-organised by RDA, the ICSU [[World Data System]] (WDS), the ICSU [[Committee on Data for Science and Technology]] (CODATA), University of Botswana (UoB) and the Academy of Science of South Africa (ASSAf).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

--&gt;'''Reverse computation''' is a [[computer software|software]] application of the concept of [[reversible computing]].

Because it offers a possible solution to the heat problem faced by chip manufacturers, reversible computing has been extensively studied in the area of computer architecture.  The promise of reversible computing is that the amount of heat loss for reversible architectures would be minimal for significantly large numbers of transistors.&lt;ref&gt;

The concept of reverse computation is somewhat simpler than reversible computing in that reverse computation is only required to restore the ''equivalent'' state of a software application, rather than support the reversibility of the set of all possible instructions.  Reversible computing concepts have been successfully applied as ''reverse computation'' in software application areas such as database design,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; suggest the application of reverse computation to reduce state saving overheads
in ''parallel discrete event simulation'' (PDES). They define an approach based on reverse event codes (which can be automatically generated), and
demonstrate performance advantages of this approach over
traditional state saving for fine-grained applications (those
with a small amount of computation per event).
The key property that reverse computation
exploits is that a majority of the operations that modify the
state variables are “constructive” in nature. That is, the [[undo]]
operation for such operations requires no history. Only the
most current values of the variables are required to undo the
operation. For example, operators such as ++, ––, +=, -=, *=
and /= belong to this category. Note, that the *= and /= operators
require special treatment in the case of multiply or divide
by zero, and overflow / underflow conditions. More complex
operations such as circular shift (swap being a special case),
and certain classes of random number generation also belong
here.

Operations of the form a = b, modulo and bit-wise computations
that result in the loss of data, are termed to be destructive.
Typically these operations can only be restored using
conventional state-saving techniques. However, we observe
that many of these destructive operations are a consequence
of the arrival of data contained within the event being
processed. For example, in the work of Yaun, Carothers, et al., with large-scale TCP simulation,&lt;ref&gt;

The swap operation makes this operation reversible.

==History of Reverse Computation as applied to Parallel Discrete Event Simulation==

[[File:Simulation-taxonomy.png|thumb|right|Taxonomy of digital simulation.]]

In 1985 Jefferson introduced the optimistic synchronization protocol, which was utilized in parallel discrete event simulations, known as Time Warp.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  To date, the technique known as ''Reverse Computation'' has only been applied in software for optimistically synchronized, parallel discrete event simulation.

In December 1999, Michael Frank graduated from the [[University of Florida]].  His [[doctoral thesis]] focused on reverse computation at the hardware level, but included descriptions of both an instruction set architecture and a high level programming language (R) for a processor based on reverse computation.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Dr. Frank maintains two websites of his publications on [http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/revcomp/writing.html reverse computation to 2004] and [http://www.eng.fsu.edu/~mpf/pubs.htm later].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 Carothers and Perumalla published a paper for the Principles of Advanced and Distributed Simulation workshop&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pads-workshop.org/ PADS]&lt;/ref&gt; as part of their graduate studies under Richard Fujimoto, introducing technique of Reverse Computation as an alternative rollback mechanism in optimistically synchronized parallel discrete event simulations (Time Warp).  In 1998, Carothers became an associate professor at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]].   Working with graduate students David Bauer and Shawn Pearce, Carothers integrated the Georgia Tech Time Warp design into Rensselaer’s Optimistic Simulation System (ROSS), which supported only reverse computation as the rollback mechanism.   Carothers also constructed RC models for BitTorrent at General Electric, as well as numerous network protocols with students (BGP4, TCP Tahoe, Multicast).  Carothers created a course on Parallel and Distributed Simulation in which students were required to construct RC models in ROSS.

Around the same time, Perumalla graduated from [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] and went to work at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] (ORNL).  There he built the uSik simulator, which was a combined optimistic / conservative protocol PDES.  The system was capable of dynamically determining the best protocol for LPs and remapping them during execution in response to model dynamics.  In 2007 Perumalla tested uSik on [[Blue Gene#Blue Gene/L|Blue Gene/L]] and found that, while scalability is limited to 8K processors for pure Time Warp implementation, the conservative implementation scales to 16K available processors.  Note that benchmarking was performed using PHOLD with a constrained remote event rate of 10%, where the timestamp of events was determined by an exponential distribution with a mean of 1.0, and an additional lookahead of 1.0 added to each event.  This was the first implementation of PDES on Blue Gene using reverse computation.

From 1998 to 2005 Bauer performed graduate work at RPI under Carothers, focusing solely on reverse computation.  He developed the first PDES system solely based on reverse computation, called Rensselaer’s Optimistic Simulation System (ROSS).&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; for combined shared and distributed memory systems.  From 2006 to 2009 Bauer worked under E.H. Page at [[Mitre Corporation]], and in collaboration with Carothers and Pearce pushed the ROSS simulator to the 131,072 processor [[Blue Gene#Blue Gene/P|Blue Gene/P]] (Intrepid).  This implementation was stable for remote event rates of 100% (every event sent over the network).  During his time at RPI and MITRE, Bauer developed the network simulation system ROSS.Net&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; that supports semi-automated experiment design for black-box optimization of network protocol models executing in ROSS.  A primary goal of the system was to optimize multiple network protocol models for execution in ROSS.  For example, creating an LP layering structure to eliminate events being passed between network protocol LPs on the same simulated machine optimizes simulation of TCP/IP network nodes by eliminating zero-offset timestamps between TCP and IP protocols.  Bauer also constructed RC agent-based models for social contact networks to study the effects of infectious diseases, in particular pandemic influenza, that scale to hundreds of millions of agents; as well as RC models for Mobile ad-hoc networks implementing functionality of mobility (proximity detection) and highly accurate physical layer electromagnetic wave propagation (Transmission Line Matrix model).&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

There has also been a recent push by the PDES community into the realm of continuous simulation.  For example, Fujimoto and Perumalla, working with Tang et al.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; have implemented an RC model of particle-in-cell and demonstrated excellent speedup over continuous simulation for models of light as a particle.  Bauer and Page demonstrated excellent speedup for an RC Transmission Line Matrix model (P.B. Johns, 1971), modeling light as a wave at microwave frequencies.  Bauer also created an RC variant of [[Compartmental models in epidemiology|SEIR]] that generates enormous improvement over continuous models in the area of infectious disease spread.  In addition, the RC SEIR model is capable of modeling multiple diseases efficiently, whereas the continuous model explodes exponentially with respect to the number of combinations of diseases possible throughout the population.

C(s) and G(s) denote compensator and plant transfer functions, respectively.|A basic closed loop control system, using unity negative feedback. C(s) and G(s) denote compensator and plant transfer functions, respectively.|220x220px]]The controller parameters are typically matched to the [[Process (engineering)|process]] characteristics and since the process may change, it is important that the controller parameters are chosen in such a way that the [[Control theory#Closed-loop_transfer_function|closed loop]] system is not sensitive to variations in process dynamics. One way to characterize sensitivity is through the nominal sensitivity peak &lt;math&gt;M_s&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;K.J. Astrom and T. Hagglund, PID Controllers: Theory, Design and Tuning, 2nd ed. Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, USA: ISA - The Instrumentation, Systems, and Automation Society, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;M_s = \max_{0 \leq \omega &lt; \infty} \left| S(j \omega) \right| = \max_{0 \leq \omega &lt; \infty} \left| \frac{1}{1 + G(j \omega)C(j \omega)} \right|&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;G(s)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C(s)&lt;/math&gt; denote the plant and controller's transfer function in a basic closed loop control system using unity negative feedback. 

The sensitivity function &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, which appears in the above formula also describes the transfer function from external disturbance to process output. In fact, assuming an additive disturbance ''n'' after the output 
[[File:Block_diagram_for_sensitivity_transfer_function.svg|thumb|Block diagram of a control system with disturbance]]
of the plant, the transfer functions of the closed loop system are given by

&lt;math&gt;Y(s) = \frac{C(s)G(s)}{1+C(s)G(s)} R(s)  + \frac{1}{1+C(s)G(s)} N(s)&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, lower values of &lt;math&gt;|S|&lt;/math&gt; suggest further attenuation of the external disturbance. The sensitivity function tells us how the disturbances are influenced by feedback. Disturbances with frequencies such that &lt;math&gt;|S(j \omega)|&lt;/math&gt; is less than one are reduced by an amount equal to the distance to the critical point &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; and disturbances with frequencies such that &lt;math&gt;|S(j \omega)|&lt;/math&gt; is larger than one are amplified by the feedback.&lt;ref&gt;K.J. Astrom, "Model uncertainty and robust control," in Lecture Notes on Iterative Identification and Control Design. Lund, Sweden: Lund Institute of Technology, Jan. 2000, pp. 63–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important that the largest value of the sensitivity function be limited for a control system and it is common to require that the maximum value of the sensitivity function, &lt;math&gt;M_s&lt;/math&gt;, be in a range of 1.3 to 2.

==Sensitivity Circle==
The quantity &lt;math&gt;M_s&lt;/math&gt; is the inverse of the shortest distance from the [[Nyquist plot|Nyquist curve]] of the loop transfer function to the critical point &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt;. A sensitivity &lt;math&gt;M_s&lt;/math&gt; guarantees that the distance from the critical point to the Nyquist curve is always greater than &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{M_s}&lt;/math&gt; and the Nyquist curve of the loop transfer function is always outside a circle around the critical point &lt;math&gt;-1+0j&lt;/math&gt; with the radius &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{M_s}&lt;/math&gt;, known as the '''sensitivity circle'''. &lt;math&gt;M_s&lt;/math&gt; defines the maximum value of the sensitivity function and the inverse of &lt;math&gt;M_s&lt;/math&gt; gives you the shortest distance from the open-loop transfer function &lt;math&gt;L(j\omega)&lt;/math&gt; to the critical point &lt;math&gt;-1+0j&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;A.

'''''Skepticality''''' is the official [[podcast]] of [[The Skeptics Society]]'s ''[[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|Skeptic]]'' magazine. Beginning in May 2005, the podcast explores [[Rationality|rational thought]], [[Skepticism|skeptical]] ideas, and famous [[Mythology|myths]] from around the world and throughout history.  Each episode is an audio magazine featuring regular segments by contributors who are specialized in specific areas of critical thought followed by featured content which is usually in the form of an interview with a researcher, author, or individual who is helping promote skeptical thought and/or science in an effective way.  It has featured interviews with [[James Randi]], and scientists, such as authors and astronomers [[Phil Plait]] and [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], [[Greg Graffin]] from ''[[Bad Religion]]'', [[Adam Savage]] from the ''[[MythBusters]]'', songwriter [[Jill Sobule]], author [[Ann Druyan]] and science communicator [[Bill Nye]].

''Skepticality'' is co-hosted by [[Derek Colanduno]] and "Swoopy" [[Robynn McCarthy]].

TASA was founded in 1963 as the Sociological Association of Australia and New Zealand (SAANZ). In 1988 with the [[New Zealand]] branch splitting off into the [[Sociological Association of Aotearoa (New Zealand)]], the association changed its name to TASA.

TASA holds an annual conference, and publishes since 1965 the (formerly, Australian and New Zealand) ''[[Journal of Sociology]]'', the premiere journal for Australian sociological research.

Membership of TASA stood at about 400 in the early 1900s.

'''''The Johns Hopkins Science Review''''' is a US television series about science that was produced at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]] from 1948-1955.&lt;ref name=archives /&gt;&lt;ref name=LaFollette2013&gt;{{cite book|last1=LaFollette|first1=Marcel Chotkowski|title=Science on American television : a history|date=2013|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, Ill.|isbn=978-0-226-92199-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1950, the series aired on the [[DuMont Television Network]] until the network's demise in 1955. The series' creator was [[Lynn Poole]], who wrote or co-wrote most of its episodes and acted as the on-camera host. In 2002, Patrick Lucanio and Gary Coville wrote that, "In retrospect, Lynn Poole created one of those unique series that allowed television to fulfill its idealized mission as both an educational and an entertainment medium."&lt;ref name=Lucanio&gt;{{cite book |first1=Patrick |last1=Lucanio |first2=Gary |last2=Coville |title=Smokin' Rockets: The Romance of Technology in American Film, Radio and Television, 1945-1962 |year=2002 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9780786412334 |pages=108–114 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=chD8HUd5uXcC&amp;pg=PA108 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original series was followed by three related series produced by Poole at Johns Hopkins University: ''Tomorrow'' (1955), ''Tomorrow's Careers'' (1955-1956), and ''Johns Hopkins File 7'' (1956-1960). Johns Hopkins University ended its production of television series in 1960.&lt;ref name=archives /&gt;

==Broadcast history==
The original series aired from March 9, 1948, to March 6, 1955. Initially, the show was broadcast only in the Baltimore area. Starting with the December 17, 1948, episode, shows were broadcast by [[CBS]] from stations along the east coast.

As was typical in the early days of television broadcasting, each show was broadcast live from a studio at Johns Hopkins University. Each week's show involved one or more guests, often from the Johns Hopkins faculty and staff. Poole acted as the host and interviewer. The guest might show how a scientific apparatus such an electron microscope or an oscilloscope worked, or would briefly explain scientific ideas to the viewers. In the December 5, 1950, episode, the live broadcast of a fluoroscope screen was used by doctors in New York and Chicago to diagnose the injuries to a machinist in the hospital in Baltimore. In the April 21, 1952, episode, a scientist drank a solution containing the radioactive isotope of iodine, and then followed its progress in his own body with a Geiger counter. The guests were sometimes national figures like [[Wernher von Braun]] (October 20, 1952), [[George Gamov]], and [[Harold Urey]]. The show famously showed a live birth and gave instructions to women viewers about breast self-examination.&lt;ref name=archives /&gt;&lt;ref name=DePasquale&gt;{{cite journal |title=Live from Baltimore -- It's the Johns Hopkins Science Review! |last=De Pasquale |first=Sue |work=Johns Hopkins Magazine |date=February 1995 |volume=47 |issue=1 |url=http://www.jhu.edu/jhumag/295web/scirevu.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each half-hour episode was broadcast from [[WJZ-TV|WAAM]] in [[Baltimore]]. The series moved to the [[DuMont Television Network]] in November 1949 through station [[WMAR]].&lt;ref name=archives /&gt; The program aired Tuesdays at 8:30 pm EST during the 1950-51 season, Mondays at 8:30pm EST during the 1951-52 season, and Wednesdays at 8pm EST during the 1952-53 season. According to the [[1953-54 United States network television schedule]], the show remained in the Wednesday at 8pm EST slot for the 1953-54 season.

The series would win the network [[Peabody Award]]s in 1950 (honorable mention) and 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Peabody Awards: Winners - 1950s |url=http://www.peabody.uga.edu/winners/winners_1950s.php |publisher=The University of Georgia |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310070208/http://www.peabody.uga.edu/winners/winners_1950s.php |archivedate=2012-03-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McNeil"&gt;{{cite book |last=McNeil |first=Alex |title=Total Television: Fourth edition |pages=438–439 |year=1996 |location=New York |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=0-14-024916-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A spin-off program, ''[[Johns Hopkins File 7]]'', aired on a [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] basis from 1956 to 1960. Like the ''Review'', ''File 7'' was broadcast by WAAM and featured host Lynn Poole.&lt;ref name=archives /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brooks"&gt;Brooks, Tim and Earle Marsh (1985). ''The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network TV Shows 1946 to Present'' p. 433. Ballantine: New York. {{ISBN|0-345-31864-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archives==
Approximately 303 episodes of the original series were made. There are records of 238 episodes, and [[kinescope]] films from 186 episodes, stored in Special Collections of the Milton Eisenhower Library at Johns Hopkins University.&lt;ref name=archives&gt;{{cite web |title=Johns Hopkins Television Programs 1948-1960 |year=2004 |last=Sobol |first=Cathy |url=http://www.library.jhu.edu/collections/specialcollections/jhuxmlkineFind.body.html |publisher=Special Collections, Milton S.

At least three episodes survive at the [[UCLA Film and Television Archive]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

In addition, Johns Hopkins University has records and films of the three successor series.&lt;ref name=archives /&gt;

* Secondly, it presents nine theoretical models that would work for sustainable open-source development: two non-profit, seven for-profit.
* Thirdly it states a theory to decide when it is economically interesting for software to remain closed.

'''Tommaso Perelli''' (1704&amp;ndash;1783) was an [[Italy|Italian]] astronomer.

Born into a noble family of [[Arezzo]], Perelli was encouraged by his father to study [[law]] at the [[University of Pisa]], but [[Guido Grandi]] (1671&amp;ndash;1742), an [[abbot]] who was teaching [[mathematics]] there, steered him toward [[science]]. When his father died, Perelli abandoned the study of law for good. He decided to get a degree in [[physics]] and [[medicine]]. He studied [[astronomy]] and medicine at the [[University of Bologna]], and [[Greek literature]] at the [[University of Padua]]. He was then appointed by the [[Tuscan government]] to the chair in astronomy at the University of Pisa, where he became a noted astronomer and hydraulics expert. He was the first to identify the hill of [[Arcetri]], near [[Galileo]]'s (1564&amp;ndash;1642) last home, [[Villa Il Gioiello]], as ideal location for astronomical observations.&lt;ref&gt;Barsanti, Danilo, and Leonardo Rombai.

'''Vietnamese studies''' (Việt Nam học) in general is the study of [[Vietnam]] and things related to Vietnam. It refers, especially, to the study of modern [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] and literature, history, ethnology, and the philological approach, respectively.

The specialist in this area is called a Vietnamist.

==University programs==
Several major universities in the [[United States]] offer a Vietnamese studies major or program, including the [[University of Houston]], [[University of California]], and [[Yale University]].

The '''Youngs River''' is a tributary of the [[Columbia River]], approximately {{convert|27|mi|km}} long, in northwest [[Oregon]] in the [[United States]]. It drains part of the [[Northern Oregon Coast Range]] in the extreme northwest corner of state, entering the Columbia via [[Youngs Bay]] just approximately {{convert|10|mi|km|0}} from its mouth.

It rises in a remote section of the mountains of central [[Clatsop County, Oregon|Clatsop County]], north of [[Saddle Mountain State Natural Area]]. It flows generally northwest, passing over [[Youngs River Falls]]. The falls were encountered in 1806 by a hunting party of the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] from nearby [[Fort Clatsop]] and documented in [[William Clark]]'s journals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/item/lc.jrn.1806-03-05|title=Journals of the Lewis &amp; Clark Expedition; Wednesday March 5th 1806}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It broadens in a large [[estuary]] and enters the south end of Youngs Bay on the Columbia at [[Astoria, Oregon|Astoria]]. It receives the [[Klaskanine River]] from the east approximately {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} south of Astoria. It receives the [[Wallooskee River]] from the east approximately {{convert|2|mi|km|0}} south of Astoria.

Named tributaries of Youngs River from source to mouth are Fall Creek and South Fork Youngs River, then Fox, Osgood, Rock, Bayney, Wawa, and Moosmoos creeks followed by the Klaskanine River.
