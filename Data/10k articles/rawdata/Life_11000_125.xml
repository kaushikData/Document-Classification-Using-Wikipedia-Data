'''Abd al-Haqq I ibn Mihyu ibn Abi Bakr ibn Hamama''' (died 1217) was the first [[Marinid]] (or Banu abd al-Haqq) [[sheikh]], leader and an [[eponym]] for that dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsAfrica/AfricaMorocco.htm Merinid Dynasty / Marinids / Beni Merin] - The History Files (African Kingdoms)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Around 1215, the new [[Almohad]] caliph, [[Yusuf II, Almohad Caliph|Yusuf II Al-Mustansir]] was still young and the Almohads had earlier suffered a severe defeat against Christian kingdoms of Iberia on 16 July 1212 in the [[battle of Las Navas de Tolosa]]. The "Banu Marin" (or the Marinids) took advantage of the situation and attacked the Almohads who sent 10,000 men to fight them. The battle took place on the coast of the [[Rif]] region. The Almohads were defeated. During 1217, the Berber nomads and tribes clashed with the Marinids around [[Fes]]  but were defeated.  However Abd al-Haqq was mortally wounded during these clashes.

The Marinids took possession of the Rif and were able to maintain their control of the region despite attempted counter-attacks by the Almohads.

'''Abundius and Abundantius''' (died c. 304) are [[Christian]] [[martyr]]s who were killed during the [[Diocletian persecution]]. Their [[feast day]] is celebrated on September 16.

==Biography==
Abundius was a [[priest]] who had earlier [[resurrect]]ed [[John and Marcianus|'''John''', the son of '''Marcianus''']]. Upon hearing of this, the emperor ordered these three, with Abundantius, a deacon, to be [[decapitation|beheaded]]. The executions were carried out at the 26th [[milestone]] of the [[Via Flaminia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Saint Augustine's Abbey|first=|date=30 June 2015 |title=The Book of Saints|url=https://books.google.gr/books?id=hpfmCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=ru&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=|publisher=Aeterna Press|location=London, United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Veneration==
Their bodies were later transferred to the church of [[Cosmas and Damian]] in Rome. The bodies of [[John and Marcianus|Marcianus and John]] were found around 1001 and transferred to [[Civita Castellana]]. There, they were elected to be the city's principal [[patron saints]]. In 1583, the relics of Abundius and Abundantius were transferred to the SS. Nome di Gesu, where they were placed under the church's [[altar|high altar]]. [[Aloysius Gonzaga]] heard [[mass]] there before becoming a [[Jesuit]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12335">The '''Ashkelon dog cemetery''' is a burial ground in the city of [[Ashkelon]] in Israel where possibly thousands of dogs were interred in the fifth to third centuries BC. The majority of the dogs were puppies; all had similarities to the modern [[Canaan Dog]], perhaps representing the ancestral population from which the modern breed is descended. It is the largest known cemetery of this kind in the ancient world. Its discoverer suggests that it may have been the product of a religious cult focused on the reputed healing properties of dogs' saliva, and an otherwise obscure reference in the [[Book of Deuteronomy]] may refer to similar cultic activities in Jerusalem. Alternatively, it may have been the site of a facility for breeding dogs for trade in the Near East.

==Description==
[[File:CanaanDogChakede.jpg|right|thumb|A Canaan Dog, a breed similar to the animals buried in the Ashkelon dog cemetery]]
The cemetery was discovered in the [[Ashkelon National Park]] by [[Lawrence Stager]] during excavations undertaken between 1986–1994 for the [[Leon Levy]] Expedition to Ashkelon. His team uncovered the skeletons of more than 1,300 dogs.&lt;ref name="WapnishHesse1993" /&gt;
&lt;ref name="Bailey2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bailey|first=Kenneth E.|title=Jesus Through Middle Eastern Eyes: Cultural Studies in the Gospels|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YbfMBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA385|year=2008|publisher=[[InterVarsity Press]]|isbn=978-0-8308-2568-4|page=385}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had been buried at a time when the [[Phoenicia]]n-populated city was ruled by [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid Persia]] as a client state.&lt;ref name="WapnishHesse1993" /&gt;

Most of the dogs were found buried in a series of terraces which had previously been occupied by a large warehouse overlooking the sea. The burial ground extended south into an area that appears to have only been briefly been used as a dog cemetery before being built upon, and probably extended west into an area that has been lost to coastal erosion. The burials have been dated to between the fifth and the first part of the fourth century BC.&lt;ref name="WapnishHesse1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wapnish|first1=Paula|last2=Hesse|first2=Brian|title=Pampered Pooches or Plain Pariahs? The Ashkelon Dog Burials|journal=[[The Biblical Archaeologist]]|jstor=3210250|volume=56|issue=2|year=1993|pages=55|issn=0006-0895|doi=10.2307/3210250}}&lt;/ref&gt; The burial ground may have been in use for about fifty years.&lt;ref name="Smith2015" /&gt; Stager notes that as "only the eastern limits of the cemetery have been established, we can speculate that it was originally much larger, with dog burials probably numbering in the thousands." He describes it as "by far the largest dog cemetery known in the ancient world."&lt;ref name="Hobgood-Oster2008" /&gt; Another series of burials was found to the north-east, where dogs had been buried in streets or in thoroughfares between large buildings. These were of later dates, from the late Persian period to the early Hellenistic period.&lt;ref name="WapnishHesse1993" /&gt;

Each animal occupied an individual shallow pit and was laid on its side with its tail tucked between its hind legs. The burials were not marked, there were no offerings in the pits and the dogs were not oriented in any consistent direction.&lt;ref name="Ackerman-LiebermanZalashik2013-33"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ackerman-Lieberman|first1=Phillip|last2=Zalashik|first2=Rakefet|title=Jew's Best Friend?: The Image of the Dog Throughout Jewish History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yCkjCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT33|year=2013|publisher=[[Sussex Academic Press]]|isbn=978-1-78284-049-7|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corpses were carefully interred, in some cases perhaps having their limbs bound at the ankles before burial. In contrast, the burial pits were dug somewhat haphazardly, overlapping and occasionally intruding on each other.&lt;ref name="WapnishHesse1993" /&gt; At least sixty percent of the dogs were puppies; some were probably fetuses. The burials appear to have taken place individually over time, rather than ''en masse''.&lt;ref name="Hobgood-Oster2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hobgood-Oster|first=Laura|title=Holy Dogs and Asses: Animals in the Christian Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T_hAaO4HDaUC&amp;pg=PA85|year=2008|publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]|isbn=978-0-252-03213-4|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cause of death does not appear to have been sacrificial.&lt;ref name="Crouch2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Crouch|first=C.L.|title=The Making of Israel: Cultural Diversity in the Southern Levant and the Formation of Ethnic Identity in Deuteronomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pU73AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA152|date=16 June 2014|publisher=[[Brill Publishers|BRILL]]|isbn=978-90-04-27469-3|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of the skeletons show evidence of fatal injuries, and they do not show any signs of having been cut up or skinned before burial. It is possible that they could have been poisoned, which would have left no traces on the skeletons. However, it seems more likely that the deaths were due to natural causes, as the death rates for urban dogs in a pre-veterinary environment were very high; perhaps as many as fifty percent are likely to have died in their first year.&lt;ref name="WapnishHesse1993" /&gt;

An alternative hypothesis has been put forward suggesting that the dogs died in an epidemic. However, this is inconsistent with the demographics of the buried dogs, as an outbreak would be expected to affect all members of the affected population, whereas the Ashkelon population is heavily skewed towards puppies.&lt;ref name="WapnishHesse1993" /&gt;

The dogs were physically similar, with close anatomical similarities to the present-day [[Canaan Dog]].&lt;ref name="Farina2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Farina|first=William|title=Man Writes Dog: Canine Themes in Literature, Law and Folklore|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZqwzAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59|year=2014|publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company|McFarland]]|isbn=978-1-4766-1455-7|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than being a single breed, they appear to represent examples of a naturally occurring [[canid]] population adapted to the hot and semi-arid conditions of the region. Dogs of this type gave rise to the Canaan Dog through [[selective breeding]] in modern times.&lt;ref name="WapnishHesse1993" /&gt;

==Interpretation==

Numerous dog burials with religious contexts have been found in the southern Levant, dating back as far as 3500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Ackerman-Lieberman &amp; Zalashik, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon of dog burials in the region appears to have reached a peak under the Persian rule (586–332 BC) and continued into the Hellenistic period, though the reasons for the growth and decline of the practice are unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Ackerman-Lieberman &amp; Zalashik, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Individual or small numbers of dog burials have been found throughout the region, though the Ashkelon cemetery is in a class of its own for its sheer size.&lt;ref name="Ackerman-LiebermanZalashik2013-33" /&gt;

Stager hypothesizes that "the best explanation seems to be that the Ashkelon dogs were revered as sacred animals. As such, they were probably associated with a particular deity and with that god's [[temenos|sacred precinct]], about which the dogs were free to roam." The care taken with the individual interments indicates "an intense relationship between dogs and humans."&lt;ref name="Hobgood-Oster2008" /&gt; Dogs were revered in Persian [[Zoroastrian]] tradition, but were also associated with healing gods in [[Canaanite religion|Canaanite]], Phoenician, [[Babylonian religion|Babylonian]] and [[Assyria]]n tradition.&lt;ref name="Farina2014" /&gt; For instance, the Babylonian goddess of health, [[Nintinugga]] or Gula, had the dog as her symbol and was described as "she who by the touch of her pure hand revives the dead."&lt;ref name="Allen2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Robert H.|title=The Classical Origins of Modern Homophobia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yfe2BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA154|year=2006|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-2349-1|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; M. Heltzer notes evidence from Sicily of a possible cultic link between dogs and the Middle Eastern goddess [[Astarte]],&lt;ref name="Heltzer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heltzer|first1=M.|title=On the Vth Century BCE Dogs from Ashkelon|journal=[[Transeuphratène]]|issue=15|year=1998|pages=149–152|issn=|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Herodotus]] mentions that the oldest temple in Ashkelon was dedicated to [[Aphrodite]], who the Greeks associated with Astarte.&lt;ref name="Edrey2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Edrey|first1=Meir|title=The Dog Burials at Achaemenid Ashkelon Revisited|journal=Tel Aviv|volume=35|issue=2|year=2013|pages=267–282|issn=0334-4355|doi=10.1179/tav.2008.2008.2.267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dogs may have been part of a healing cult in which they were trained to lick the wounds or sores or humans, in exchange for a fee.&lt;ref name="Bailey2008" /&gt; Stager speculates that future archaeologists may discover a temple dedicated to the cult somewhere in the ruins of ancient Ashkelon.&lt;ref name="Farina2014" /&gt; The identity of the deity concerned is unknown, but he suggests that it may have been [[Resheph]], the Phoenician god of healing and plague.&lt;ref name="Milgrom1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Milgrom|first=Jacob|title=Pomegranates and Golden Bells: Studies in Biblical, Jewish, and Near Eastern Ritual, Law, and Literature in Honor of Jacob Milgrom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1poyGNWV3UcC&amp;pg=PA396|year=1995|publisher=[[Eisenbrauns]]|isbn=978-0-931464-87-4|page=396}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dogs and other animals are encouraged to lick injuries to benefit the sick or injured from the healing properties of saliva, which contains mild antibiotics.&lt;ref name="Allen2006" /&gt;

The [[Book of Deuteronomy]] may refer to this obliquely in a verse (23:18) which reads: "You shall not bring the hire of a prostitute or the wages of a dog into the house of the Lord your God in payment for any vow." Biblical scholars have interpreted "the wages of a dog" ({{Lang-he| מְחִ֣יר כֶּ֗לֶב }} ''məḥîr keleḇ'') as a reference to male prostitution.&lt;ref name="Barclay2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barclay|first=William|title=The Revelation of John, Volume Two|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pzo__RUjN4EC&amp;pg=PA256|year=2004|publisher=[[Westminster John Knox Press]]|isbn=978-1-61164-028-1|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is possible that the phrase refers instead to healing dogs. Stager speculates that a similar cult may have operated in the vicinity of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], whose attendants may have received fees for their services. This could have prompted the [[Deuteronomist]] to prohibit using such fees as payments for vows in the Temple.&lt;ref name="Milgrom1995" /&gt; The dogs would have been seen as doubly impure for being associated with a foreign religion and consuming the filth emanating from sores and wounds.&lt;ref name="Allen2006" /&gt;

The main area where dogs were buried has often been termed a cemetery, implying a sacred area set aside for burials, but Paula Wapnish and Brian Hesse note that "dogs were buried where there was space, rather than a space being prepared to receive dogs." If the dogs were buried in conjunction with religious activities, the combination of careful burial with a lack of markers or [[grave goods]] and the disturbance of previous burials may indicate that the dogs were revered up to the point of burial, then granted no significance thereafter. Alternatively, Wapnish and Hesse suggest that the dogs were simply semi-feral urban dogs whose burial in one principal site was simply the result of local custom rather than any religious motivation.&lt;ref name="WapnishHesse1993" /&gt; Another explanation has been put forward by Anne Marie Smith, who argues that the dogs could have been bred for trade to supply dog-venerating cults in the eastern Mediterranean and Middle East, and were buried on the same site where they lived.&lt;ref name="Smith2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Anne Marie|title=The Ashkelon Dog Cemetery Conundrum|journal=[[Journal for Semitics]]|volume=24|issue=1|year=2015|pages=93–108|issn=1013-8471|url=https://www.academia.edu/19227774/The_Ashkelon_Dog_Cemetery_Conundrum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

In 2010, BioMarin became involved in controversy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-11798183 | title = Drug firms accused of exploiting loophole for profit  | last = Goldberg | first = Adrian | date = 2010-11-21 | accessdate = 2010-11-21 | publisher = [[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1315441/Hospitals-forced-use-unlicensed-medicines-save-millions.html | title = Hospitals are forced to use unlicensed medicines to save millions | date = 2010-09-27 | accessdate = 2010-11-21 | location=London | work=Daily Mail | first=Daniel | last=Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt; surrounding [[3,4-diaminopyridine]] (3,4-DAP). BioMarin markets a phosphate salt of 3,4-DAP under the name [[Firdapse]]. In 2010, BioMarin was granted exclusive licensing rights to Firdapse for 10 years. As a result, the price of a prescribed [[National Health Service]] treatment course has increased from $1,987 for the unlicensed drug to $69,970 for Firdapse. The company states that prior to its licensing, there was no guaranteed quality control of the product and no way of formally monitoring for uncommon side effects through the regulatory process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url = http://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c6459 | title = What makes an orphan drug? | date = 2010-11-10 | accessdate = 2010-11-21 | publisher = British Medical Journal }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, BioMarin  Pharmaceuticals was at the center of a high profile debate regarding [[expanded access]] of cancer patients to experimental drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Andrea Sloan Faces Pharma Firm With History Of Indifference | date = 2013-09-26 | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/26/andrea-sloan-biomarin_n_3997527.html | work = Huffington Post | accessdate = 2013-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the advice of her doctor, Andrea Sloan, a patient with advanced ovarian cancer, requested that the company  provide her with access to BMN 673, an unapproved [[PARP inhibitor]] drug candidate that had exhibited promising activity in a small [[Phase 1 clinical trial]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7041">Generally speaking, a '''biological pacemaker''' is one or more types of cellular components that, when "implanted or injected into certain regions of the heart," produce specific electrical stimuli that mimic that of the body's natural [[Cardiac pacemaker|pacemaker cells]].&lt;ref name="ActonArr13"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-4tb34BiNagC&amp;pg=PA57 |chapter=Chapter 3: Genetics - Patent Issued for Method for Controlling Pacemaker Therapy |title=Arrhythmia: New Insights for the Healthcare Professional |editor=Acton, Q.A. |author1=Kenknight, B. |author2=Girouard, S.D. |publisher=ScholarlyEditions |location=Atlanta, GA |year=2013 |pages=27–60 |isbn=9781481650717 |accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's indicated for issues such as [[heart block]], [[Bradycardia|slow heart rate]], and [[Cardiac resynchronization therapy|asynchronous heart ventricle contractions]].&lt;ref name="EllisSci14"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/279760.php |title=Scientists create 'biological pacemakers' by transplanting gene into hearts |author=Ellis, Marie |work=Medical News Today |publisher=MediLexicon International Ltd |date=17 July 2014 |accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HattoriBlue15"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/06/150622125201.htm |title=Blue light sets the beat in biological pacemaker |author=Hattori, K. |work=Science Daily |date=22 June 2015 |accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biological pacemaker is intended as an alternative to the [[artificial cardiac pacemaker]] that's been in human use since the late 1950s. Despite their success, several limitations and problems with artificial pacemakers have emerged during the past decades such as [[electrode]] fracture or damage to [[insulator (electrical)|insulation]], [[infection]], re-operations for [[battery (electricity)|battery]] exchange, and [[venous thrombosis]]. The need for an alternative is most obvious in children, including premature [[Infant|newborn babies]], where size mismatch and the fact that pacemaker leads do not grow with children are a problem.&lt;ref name="ActonArr13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="YuModern11"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.intechopen.com/books/modern-pacemakers-present-and-future/biological-pacemaker-main-ideas-and-optimization |chapter=Chapter 30: Biological Pacemaker – Main Ideas and Optimization |title=Modern Pacemakers - Present and Future |author1=Yu, H.-G. |author2=Lin, Y.-C. |editor=Das, M.K. |publisher=InTech |year=2011 |pages=549–572 |isbn=9789533072142 |doi=10.5772/13350 |accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more biological approach has been taken in order to mitigate many of these issues. However, the implanted biological pacemaker cells still typically need to be supplemented with an artificial pacemaker while the cells form the necessary electrical connections with cardiac tissue.&lt;ref name="ActonArr13" /&gt;

==History==
The first successful experiment with biological pacemakers was carried out by Arjang Ruhparwar's group at [[Hannover Medical School]] in Germany using transplanted [[fetal]] heart [[muscle cells]]. The process was first introduced at the scientific sessions of the [[American Heart Association]] in [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]] in 2001, and the results were published in 2002.&lt;ref name="RuhparwarTrans02"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Transplanted fetal cardiomyocytes as cardiac pacemaker |journal=European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery |author1=Ruhparwar, A. |author2=Tebbenjohanns, J. |author3=Niehaus, M. |display-authors=etal |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=853–857 |year=2002 |doi=10.1016/S1010-7940(02)00066-0 |pmid=12062274}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later, Eduardo Marban's group from [[Johns Hopkins University]] published the first successful gene-therapeutic approach towards the generation of pacemaking activity in otherwise non-pacemaking adult [[cardiomyocytes]] using a [[guinea pig]] model.&lt;ref name="MiakeBio02"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Biological pacemaker created by gene transfer |journal=Nature |author1=Miake, J. |author2=Marbán, E. |author3=Nuss, H.B. |volume=419 |issue=6903 |pages=132–133 |year=2002 |doi=10.1038/419132b |pmid=12226654}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigators postulated latent pacemaker capability in normal [[Cardiac muscle|heart muscle]] cells. This potential ability is suppressed by the [[inward-rectifier potassium ion channel|inward-rectifier potassium current]] Ik1 encoded by the [[gene]] Kir2 which is not expressed in [[Cardiac pacemaker|pacemaker cells]]. By specific inhibition of Ik1 below a certain level, spontaneous activity of cardiomyocytes was observed with resemblance to the action potential pattern of genuine pacemaker cells.

Meanwhile, other genes and cells have been discovered, including heart muscle cells derived from [[embryonic stem cell]]s, "HCN" genes which encode the [[wild type]] pacemaker current I(f). Michael Rosen's group demonstrated that transplantation of HCN2-transfected human mesenchymal [[stem cell]]s (hMSCs) leads to expression of functional HCN2 channels [[in vitro]] and [[in vivo]], mimicking overexpression of HCN2 genes in cardiac [[myocyte]]s.&lt;ref name="PlotnikovBio04"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Biological pacemaker implanted in canine left bundle branch provides ventricular escape rhythms that have physiologically acceptable rates |journal=Circulation |author1=Plotnikov, A.N. |author2=Sosunov, E.A. |author3=Qu, J. |display-authors=etal |volume=109 |issue=4 |pages=506–512 |year=2004 |doi=10.1161/01.CIR.0000114527.10764.CC |pmid=14734518}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Ruhparwar's group again demonstrated a type of biological pacemaker, this time showing that by injection of the "Adenylate Cyclase" gene into the heart muscle a biological cardiac pacemaker can be created.&lt;ref name="RuhparwarAdenylate10"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Adenylate-cyclase VI transforms ventricular cardiomyocytes into biological pacemaker cells |journal=Tissue Engineering Part A |author1=Ruhparwar, A. |author2=Kallenbach, K. |author3=Klein, G. |display-authors=etal |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=1867–1872 |doi=10.1089/ten.tea.2009.0537 |pmid=20067385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently a gene called TBX18 has been non-invasively applied to speed up heart rates caused by heart block (2014),&lt;ref name="EllisSci14" /&gt; and light-sensitive genes that react to blue light have been injected in order "to activate the heart simultaneously from a number of sites" (2015).&lt;ref name="HattoriBlue15" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19549">A '''chiral''' phenomenon is one that is not identical to its [[mirror image]] (see the article on [[Chirality (mathematics)|mathematical chirality]]). The [[Spin (physics)|spin]] of a [[Elementary particle|particle]] may be used to define a '''handedness''', or helicity, for that particle, which, in the case of a massless particle, is the same as chirality. A [[symmetry transformation]] between the two is called [[parity (physics)|parity]] transformation. Invariance under parity transformation by a [[Dirac fermion]] is called '''chiral symmetry'''.

[[Wu experiment|An experiment]] on the [[weak nuclear force|weak decay]] of [[cobalt]]-60 nuclei carried out by [[Chien-Shiung Wu]] and collaborators in 1957 demonstrated that [[parity violation|parity is not a symmetry]] of the universe.

==Chirality and helicity==
{{see also|Helicity (particle physics)}}
The helicity of a particle is ''right-handed'' if the direction of its [[spin (physics)|spin]] is the same as the direction of its motion. It is ''left-handed'' if the directions of spin and motion are opposite. So a standard [[clock]], with its spin vector defined by the rotation of its hands, tossed with its face directed forwards, has left-handed helicity.

Mathematically, helicity is the sign of the projection of the [[spin (physics)|spin]] [[vector (geometric)|vector]] onto the [[momentum]] [[vector (geometric)|vector]]: “left” is negative, “right” is positive.

[[Image:Right left helicity.svg|center]]
The ''chirality'' of a particle is more abstract: It is determined by whether the particle transforms in a right- or left-handed [[Group representation|representation]] of the [[Poincaré group]].&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Note, however, that representations such as [[Dirac spinor]]s and others, have both right- and left-handed components. In cases like this, we can define [[projection operator]]s that project out either the right or left hand components and discuss the right- and left-handed portions of the representation.&lt;/ref&gt;

For massless particles – [[photon]]s, [[gluon]]s, and (hypothetical) [[graviton]]s – chirality is the same as [[helicity (particle physics)|helicity]]; a given massless particle appears to spin in the same direction along its axis of motion regardless of point of view of the observer.

For massive particles – such as [[electron]]s, [[quark]]s, and [[neutrino]]s – chirality and helicity must be distinguished: In the case of these particles, it is possible for an observer to change to a [[Frame of reference|reference frame]] moving faster than the spinning particle, in which case the particle will then appear to move backwards, and its helicity (which may be thought of as “apparent chirality”) will be reversed.

A ''massless'' particle moves with the [[speed of light]], so no real observer (who must always travel at less than the [[speed of light]]) can be in any reference frame where the particle appears to reverse its relative direction of spin, meaning that all real observers see the same helicity. Because of this, the direction of spin of massless particles is not affected by a change of viewpoint ([[Lorentz boost]]) in the direction of motion of the particle, and the sign of the projection (helicity) is fixed for all reference frames: The helicity of massless particles is a “''relativistic invariant''” (a quantity whose value is the same in all inertial reference frames) which always matches the massless particles' chirality.

The discovery of [[neutrino oscillation]] implies [[neutrino#Mass|that neutrinos have mass]], so the only observed massless particle is the [[photon]]. The [[gluon]] is also expected to be massless, although the assumption that it is has not been conclusively tested. Hence, these are the only two particles now known for which helicity could be identical to chirality, and only one of them has been confirmed by measurement. All other observed particles have mass and thus may have different helicities in different reference frames. It is still possible that as-yet unobserved particles, like the [[graviton]], might be massless, and hence have invariant helicity that matches their chirality, like the [[photon]].

==Chiral theories==
Only left-handed [[fermion]]s and right-handed antifermions interact with the [[weak force|weak interaction]].&lt;ref&gt;Bogdan Povh, Klaus Rith, Christoph Scholz, Frank Zetsche, ''Particles and Nuclei: An Introduction to the Physical Concepts'', (Springer 2006) p. 145, {{ISBN|978-3-540-36683-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In most circumstances, two left-handed [[fermion]]s interact more strongly than right-handed or opposite-handed [[fermions]], implying that the universe has a preference for left-handed chirality, which violates a symmetry of the other forces of nature.

Chirality for a [[Fermionic field#Dirac fields|Dirac fermion]]  {{mvar|ψ}} is defined through the operator [[Gamma matrices|{{math|''γ''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;}}]], which has [[eigenvalue, eigenvector, and eigenspace|eigenvalue]]s ±1.  
Any Dirac field can thus be projected into its left- or right-handed component by acting with the [[Projection (linear algebra)|projection operators]] {{math|½(1−''γ''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;)}} or {{math|½(1+''γ''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;)}} on {{mvar|ψ}}.

The coupling of the charged weak interaction to fermions is proportional to the first projection operator, which is responsible for this interaction's [[parity (physics)|parity symmetry]] violation.

A common source of confusion is due to conflating this operator with the [[helicity (particle physics)|helicity]] operator. Since the helicity of massive particles is frame-dependent, it might seem that the same particle would interact with the weak force according to one frame of reference, but not another.  The resolution to this false paradox is that ''the chirality operator is equivalent to helicity for massless fields only'', for which helicity is not frame-dependent.  By contrast, for massive particles, ''chirality is not the same as helicity'', so there is no frame dependence of the weak interaction: a particle that couples the weak force in one frame, does so in every frame.

A theory that is asymmetric with respect to chiralities is called a ''chiral theory'', while a non-chiral (i.e., parity-symmetric) theory is sometimes called a ''vector theory''.  Many pieces of the [[Standard Model]] of physics are non-chiral, which is traceable to  [[Anomaly (physics)|anomaly cancellation]] in chiral theories.  [[Quantum chromodynamics]] is an example of a ''vector theory'', since both chiralities of all quarks appear in the theory, and couple to gluons in the same way.

The [[electroweak theory]], developed in the mid 20th century, is an example of a ''chiral theory''. Originally, it assumed that [[neutrino#Mass|neutrinos were massless]], and only assumed the existence of left-handed [[neutrino]]s (along with their complementary right-handed antineutrinos). After the observation of [[neutrino oscillation]]s, which imply that [[neutrino#Mass|neutrinos are massive]] like all other [[fermion]]s, the revised [[electroweak theory|theories of the electroweak interaction]] now include both right- and left-handed [[neutrino]]s.  However, it is still a chiral theory, as it does not respect parity symmetry.

The exact nature of the [[neutrino]] is still unsettled and so the [[electroweak theory|electroweak theories]] that have been proposed are somewhat different, but most accommodate the chirality of [[neutrino]]s in the same way as was already done for all other [[fermions]].

==Chiral symmetry==
Vector [[gauge theory|gauge theories]] with massless Dirac fermion fields  {{mvar|ψ}}  exhibit chiral symmetry, i.e., rotating the left-handed and the right-handed components independently makes no difference to the theory. We can write this as the action of rotation on the fields:
:&lt;math&gt;\psi_L\rightarrow e^{i\theta_L}\psi_L&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\psi_R\rightarrow \psi_R&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;\psi_L\rightarrow \psi_L&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\psi_R\rightarrow e^{i\theta_R}\psi_R.&lt;/math&gt;

With {{mvar|N}} [[Flavor (particle physics)|flavors]], we have unitary rotations instead: {{math|''U(N)&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;times;U(N)&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

More generally, we write the right-handed and left-handed states as a projection operator acting on a spinor. The right-handed and left-handed projection operators are
:&lt;math&gt; P_R = \frac{1 + \gamma^5}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt; P_L = \frac{1 - \gamma^5}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Massive fermions do not exhibit chiral symmetry, as the mass term in the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]],    {{math|  ''m''{{overset|&amp;mdash;|''ψ''}}''ψ''}},  breaks chiral symmetry explicitly.

[[Chiral symmetry breaking|Spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking]] may also occur in some theories, as it most notably does in [[quantum chromodynamics]].

The chiral symmetry transformation can be divided into a component that treats the left-handed and the right-handed parts equally, known as '''vector symmetry''', and a component that actually treats them differently, known as '''axial symmetry'''.&lt;ref&gt;Ta-Pei Cheng and Ling-Fong Li, ''Gauge Theory of Elementary Particle Physics'',  (Oxford 1984) {{ISBN|978-0198519614}}&lt;/ref&gt; (cf. [[Current algebra]].) A scalar field model encoding chiral symmetry and its [[chiral symmetry breaking|breaking]] is the [[chiral model]].

The most common application is expressed as equal treatment of clockwise and counter-clockwise rotations from a fixed frame of reference.

The general principle is often referred to by the name '''chiral symmetry'''. The rule is absolutely valid in the [[classical mechanics]] of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], but results from [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] experiments show a difference in the behavior of left-chiral versus right-chiral [[subatomic particles]].

===Example: ''u'' and ''d'' quarks in QCD===
Consider [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD) with two ''massless'' [[quarks]] {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|d}} (massive fermions do not exhibit chiral symmetry). The Lagrangian reads
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} = \overline{u}\,i\displaystyle{\not}D \,u + \overline{d}\,i\displaystyle{\not}D\, d + \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{gluons}~.&lt;/math&gt;

In terms of left-handed and right-handed spinors, it reads
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} = \overline{u}_L\,i\displaystyle{\not}D \,u_L + \overline{u}_R\,i\displaystyle{\not}D \,u_R + \overline{d}_L\,i\displaystyle{\not}D \,d_L  + \overline{d}_R\,i\displaystyle{\not}D \,d_R + \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{gluons} ~.&lt;/math&gt;
(Here, {{mvar|i}} is the imaginary unit and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\not}D&lt;/math&gt; the [[Dirac operator]].)

Defining
:&lt;math&gt;q = \begin{bmatrix} u \\ d \end{bmatrix} ,&lt;/math&gt;
it can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} = \overline{q}_L\,i\displaystyle{\not}D \,q_L + \overline{q}_R\,i\displaystyle{\not}D\, q_R + \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{gluons} ~.&lt;/math&gt;

The Lagrangian is unchanged under a rotation of ''q&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' by any 2×2 unitary matrix  {{mvar|L}}, and ''q&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' by any 2×2 unitary matrix {{mvar|R}}.

This symmetry of the Lagrangian is called ''flavor chiral symmetry'', and denoted as {{math|''U(2)&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;×U(2)&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.   It decomposes into
:&lt;math&gt;SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_V \times U(1)_A ~.&lt;/math&gt;

The singlet vector symmetry, {{math|''U(1)&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;''}},  acts as
:&lt;math&gt;
q_L \rightarrow e^{i\theta} q_L \qquad
q_R \rightarrow e^{i\theta} q_R ~,
&lt;/math&gt;
and corresponds to [[baryon number]] conservation.

The singlet axial group  {{math|''U(1)&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''}}  acts as
:&lt;math&gt;
q_L \rightarrow e^{i\theta} q_L \qquad
q_R \rightarrow e^{-i\theta} q_R ~,
&lt;/math&gt;
and it does not correspond to a conserved quantity, because it is explicitly violated by a [[anomaly (physics)|quantum anomaly]].

The remaining chiral symmetry {{math|''SU(2)&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;×SU(2)&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;''}} turns out to be [[spontaneous symmetry breaking|spontaneously broken]] by a [[quark condensate]] 
&lt;math&gt;\textstyle \langle \bar{q}^a_R q^b_L \rangle = v \delta^{ab}&lt;/math&gt; formed through nonperturbative action of QCD gluons, 
into the diagonal vector subgroup ''SU(2)&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;'' known as [[isospin]]. The [[Goldstone bosons]] corresponding to the three broken generators are the three [[pions]]. 
As a consequence, the effective theory of QCD bound states like the baryons, must now include mass terms for them, ostensibly disallowed by unbroken chiral symmetry. Thus, this [[chiral symmetry breaking]] induces the bulk of hadron masses, such as those for the [[nucleon]]s &amp;mdash; in effect, the bulk of the mass of all visible matter.

In the real world, because of the nonvanishing and differing masses of the quarks,  ''SU(2)&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;×SU(2)&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' is only an approximate symmetry&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gell-Mann | first1 = M. | last2 = Renner | first2 = B. | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.175.2195 | title = Behavior of Current Divergences under SU_{3}×SU_{3} | journal = Physical Review | volume = 175 | issue = 5 | pages = 2195 | year = 1968 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1968PhRv..175.2195G }}&lt;/ref&gt; to begin with, and therefore the pions are not massless, but have small masses: they are [[Chiral symmetry breaking|pseudo-Goldstone boson]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Peskin |first1=Michael |last2=Schroeder |first2=Daniel | title = An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory | publisher = Westview Press | year = 1995 | pages = 670 | isbn = 0-201-50397-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===More Flavors===
For more  "light" quark species, {{mvar|N}}  [[Flavour (particle physics)|flavors]]  in general, the corresponding chiral symmetries are ''U(N)&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;×U(N)&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'',  decomposing into
:&lt;math&gt;SU(N)_L \times SU(N)_R \times U(1)_V \times U(1)_A ~,&lt;/math&gt;
and exhibiting a very analogous [[chiral symmetry breaking]] pattern.

Most usually, {{mvar|N}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3 is taken, the ''u, d'', and ''s'' quarks taken to be light (the [[Eightfold way (physics)]]), so then approximately massless for the symmetry to be meaningful to a lowest order, while the other three quarks are sufficiently heavy to barely have a residual chiral symmetry be visible for practical purposes.

===An application in Particle Physics===
In [[theoretical physics]], the [[electroweak]] model breaks [[parity (physics)|parity]] maximally. All its [[fermion]]s are chiral [[Weyl fermion]]s, which means that the charged [[W and Z bosons|weak gauge bosons]] only couple to left-handed quarks and leptons. (Note that the neutral electroweak Z boson couples to left ''and'' right-handed fermions.)

Some theorists found this objectionable, and so conjectured a [[Grand unification theory|GUT]] extension of the [[weak force]] which has new, high energy [[W' and Z' bosons]], which now couple with right handed quarks and leptons:
:&lt;math&gt;{[SU(2)_W\times U(1)_Y]\over \mathbb{Z}_2}&lt;/math&gt;
to
:&lt;math&gt;{SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R\times U(1)_{B-L}\over \mathbb{Z}_2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here, SU(2)&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; (pronounced SU(2) left) is none other than the above SU(2)&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt;, while  [[B−L]] is the [[baryon number]] minus the [[lepton number]]. The electric charge formula in this model is given by
:&lt;math&gt; Q= I_{3L}+I_{3R}+\frac{B-L}{2}&lt;/math&gt;;
where &lt;math&gt;\! I_{3L,R}&lt;/math&gt; are the [[weak isospin]] values of the fields in the theory.

There is also the [[chromodynamic]] SU(3)&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;. The idea was to restore parity by introducing a '''left-right symmetry'''. This is a [[group extension]] of '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (the left-right symmetry) by
:&lt;math&gt;{SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}\over \mathbb{Z}_6}&lt;/math&gt;
to the [[semidirect product]]
:&lt;math&gt;{SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}\over \mathbb{Z}_6} \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2.&lt;/math&gt;

This has two [[connected space|connected component]]s where '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; acts as an [[automorphism]], which is the composition of an [[Involution (mathematics)|involutive]] [[outer automorphism]] of SU(3)&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; with the interchange of the left and right copies of SU(2) with the reversal of U(1)&lt;sub&gt;B−L&lt;/sub&gt;. It was shown by Rabindra N. Mohapatra and [[Goran Senjanovic]] in 1975 that [[left-right symmetry]] can be [[spontaneous symmetry breaking|spontaneously broken]] to give a chiral low energy theory, which is the Standard Model of Glashow, Weinberg and Salam and it also connects the small observed neutrino masses to the breaking of left-right symmetry via the [[seesaw mechanism]].

In this setting, the chiral [[quark]]s
:&lt;math&gt;(3,2,1)_{1\over 3}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;(\bar{3},1,2)_{-{1\over 3}}&lt;/math&gt;
are unified into an [[irreducible representation]] (“irrep”)
:&lt;math&gt;(3,2,1)_{1\over 3}\oplus(\bar{3},1,2)_{-{1\over 3}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[lepton]]s are also unified into an [[irreducible representation]]
:&lt;math&gt;(1,2,1)_{-1}\oplus(1,1,2)_1.&lt;/math&gt;

The Higgs bosons needed to implement the breaking of left-right symmetry down to the Standard Model
are
:&lt;math&gt;(1,3,1)_{2}\oplus(1,1,3)_{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

This then predicts three [[sterile neutrino]]s, which is perfectly consistent with {{As of|2005|alt=current}} [[neutrino oscillation]] data. Within the seesaw mechanism, the sterile neutrinos become superheavy without affecting physics at low energies.

Because the left-right symmetry is spontaneously broken, left-right models predict [[Domain wall (string theory)|domain wall]]s.
This left-right symmetry idea first appeared in the [[Pati–Salam model]] (1974), Mohapatra–Pati models (1975).

'''Christine Abrahams'''  was a gallery director and major supporter of contemporary Australian art in [[melbourne, Australia|Melbourne]] since the 1970s. 

==Life==
Artist [[Lenton Parr]] said of Christine that she valued art "as a gift to the spirit and a source of pleasure and enlightenment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary|last=Parr|first=Lenton|date=October 1994|publisher=Art Monthly Australia|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She was Manager of Powell Street Gallery between 1976 and 1980 (the lessees were Melbourne solicitor Harry Curtis and a Caulfield doctor, David Rosenthal), and a Co-Director of Axiom Gallery from 1980 to 1982. 

==Christine Abrahams Gallery==
Christine founded the eponymous Christine Abrahams Gallery on 12 February 1983 at 27 Gipps Street [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]], an inner, once-industrial, suburb of Melbourne, in the same precinct as an increasing number of other commercial galleries, including the long-running Pinacotheca Gallery.

The building was converted in 1980 from a clothing factory by the architect of Abrahams' own 1982 Brighton residence,&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood, Helen, 'The Hide-Art', ''Plenty'', vol. 5, November/January 1990 pp.42-44 (Abrahams House, Brighton, photographs by Ashley Evans).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daryl Jackson]], who preserved the industrial aesthetic of exposed trusses, bare concrete floors and steel roller-door. Jackson himself exhibited at the gallery in April 1984, showing drawings and models for a 'more humane' neo-industrial style.&lt;ref&gt;Murdoch, Anna (1984)  'Dealing with other people's truths'. In The Age Thursday April 5, 1984, p.14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holloway, Memory (1984) 'Stimulating architecture'. In The Age, Wednesday March 28 1984, p.14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christine Abrahams Gallery showed a broad spectrum of visual arts by contemporary artists, architects, sculptors, potters, photographers, jewellers, and furniture makers. It was operated after Christine's death in 1994 by her son Guy Abrahams, who had been co-director since 1987. 

The gallery closed after 25 years in November 2008.

==Influence==
Christine initiated the influential [[Australian Contemporary Art Fair]] (now [[Melbourne Art Fair]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Established galleries featured at art fair|date=9 September 2008|publisher=Australian Jewish News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a member of its organising committee in 1988, 1990 and 1992. 

She was on the board of the Fifth [[Australian Sculpture Triennial]] (1993) and was a member of the Visual Art Export Group of the [[Australia Council]] and the [[Craft Council of Victoria]].

The '''Coda''' is a group of [[fictional]] female [[warrior]]s in [[Wildstorm]] [[comic book|comics]]. The Coda first appeared in ''[[WildC.A.T.S.]]'' volume 1 #1 (August, 1992) and were created by [[Brandon Choi]] and [[Jim Lee]]. 

==Fictional background==
The Coda are a particular race of all female aliens who live on the planet Khera. They are trained in their own unique form of martial arts. Their weapon of choice is the Clef Blade, a weapon resembling a harpoon or a lance, though they often wield swords or even modern firearms. Coda warriors usually wear red markings on their face.  A sign (usually a circle) on the forehead and stripes on the cheeks) depicting their ranking within the sisterhood. A second class group of Coda warriors of different species have formed on various planets, carrying the blood of original Coda warriors only.

===Khera===
The Coda was founded on the planet Khera, home to the [[Kherubim]]. The Kherubim were a race blessed with longevity, but the downside was that they had become nearly infertile. Childbirth was a great honor and therefore every Kheran had to participate in a ritual in which a Kheran female and a Kheran male had to couple once. Should the female become pregnant and give birth, she would go on to become a priestess. Otherwise she could do with her life as she pleased. [[Zealot (Wildstorm)|Lady Zannah]] had been selected to mate with [[Mister Majestic|Majestros]] and their union did result in childbirth, the child [[Savant (Wildstorm)|Kenesha]]. Zannah, though, loved being a warrior; so her mother, Harmony, proposed a plan: She would tell her people that Zannah's child had died, and would raise Kenesha as her own daughter. Zannah accepted, and Harmony became a figure of legend, the only Kherubim to have given birth to more than one child in ages. This legend was the foundation of the Sisterhood known as the Coda, a completely female [[caste]] of warriors, devoted to the honor of combat. Their male counterpart is known as the Brotherhood of the Sword. Over the millennia, the Coda would grow in power, and at present they are the second largest political faction within Kherubim society. Only the Pantheon is slightly larger. The Coda's headquarters is Zealot's former home, the Tower of Red Lament. Among the Coda on Khera, there is a small cell of elite assassins called the Skein. They have no known counterpart among the Earthborn Coda. The first rule of The Coda is: ''The weapon is the extension of the flesh, the flesh of the mind, the mind of the soul''.

===Earth===
The Kherubim were at war with the [[Daemonite]]s, another spacefaring race. During a ship-to-ship combat, a Kheran and a Daemonite vessel crashlanded on Earth. Both Zannah and Kenesha were on board this vessel. The Kherubim were physically identical to humans and quickly integrated within human society, inspiring tales of superhuman heroes, gods and angels. The Daemonites had the ability to possess human hosts and inspired tales of possession, demons and monsters. Their war continued underground. 

To aid them in their war, Zannah, now called Zealot and two of her fellow Coda generals, Andromache and Artemis, started training human Coda Warriors, giving birth to the myth of the Amazons. They established a hidden Coda city on Mt. Themyscira in [[Greece]]. Kenesha took the name [[Savant (Wildstorm)|Savant]], but had no desire to join the Coda. As the Earthborn sisterhood are not born immortals, the immortal members take part in a ''Blood Dance'' with the newer members worthy of being called Coda Warriors. In the ritual they cut each other in a ritualistic dance and rub each other's wounds, thus mingling the blood, transferring the immortal blood into the non-immortal. The blood of a Kherubim, mingled with a human's during a special ritual, gave the gift of longevity to normal humans and this became an important ritual for Earth's Coda. The Kheran Coda sisterhood have been shown to perform this ritual also, but as they are all immortal, their reasons have more to do with the symbolic than with the need for survival. The Coda's Cleft Blades, both on Khera and on Earth, are considered very sacred to the sisterhood. They are only to be used in a death duel or in their ritual Blood Dance. During a battle near Troy (presumably the [[Trojan War]]), Zealot's actions branded her as a traitor to the rest of the Coda, to be killed on sight. The Coda general Andromache took over the role of [[Majestrix]]. Under her rule the Coda began selling their skills to the highest bidders and became less noble warriors and more power hungry conquerors. They also began establishing smaller Coda bases around the world. Though Mt. Themyscira still proved to be the oldest and most sacred of homes to the Amazons, the Coda have also been shown to reside in a massive island off the coast of Africa which they refer to as the Coda Citadel, as discovered by members of [[Gen¹³]].&lt;ref&gt;''Gen¹³'' (vol. 2), #3-5&lt;/ref&gt;  As Zealot was seen as a traitor to the sisterhood, she became a constant target of The Coda for several centuries.

[[Image:CodaWarrior.JPG|thumb|[[Zealot (Wildstorm)|Zealot]] displays standard Coda weapons, such as the Cleft Blade]]
In the mid 20th century, Zealot trained [[Grifter (comics)|Grifter]] in the fighting style of the Coda, making him the first male Coda. When the Coda discovered this they marked Grifter a target for extermination as they believed the Coda ways are only to be carried by women. By now many Coda were working for the Cabal, an organisation founded by the Daemonites. Zealot, Grifter and Savant all were part of the [[WildC.A.T.s]] and Zealot also eventually trained WildC.A.T.s member [[Voodoo (Wildstorm)|Voodoo]] in the Coda martial arts. The WildC.A.T.s and Coda fought often. The WildC.A.T.s returned once to Khera where Zealot was nearly assassinated by her own Coda Sisters, just to make her a martyr for their cause. Zealot was disgusted with the Sisters betrayal of their ideals and returned to Earth with the other WildC.A.T.s.

Several months later on Earth, Zealot apparently died on a mission causing the WildC.A.T.s to disband. She decided that the actions of the Coda on Earth and on Khera proved that the Coda had become corrupt and decided that the corruption had to be destroyed. She set out to single-handedly erase the Coda from the face of the Earth. She killed all Coda in America she could find, but spared Grifter, because of their shared romantic past. She warned him not to follow her.

Zealot continued her quest in Europe and destroyed most of the Coda there, but was captured by their top agent, The Grand Sarin. Grifter gathered several allies to save her, resulting in a war between his forces and the Coda. In the end, his small group turned out not to be enough, but Grifter called in the help of former WildC.A.T.s member and his current employer, [[Spartan (comics)|Jack Marlowe]], who used his powers to teleport part of the Mediterranean Sea on top of the Coda, drowning many of them. Majestrix Andromache survived and with her surviving troops she faced Grifter and his friends. At the same time FBI-agent Chandler, whose partner had been killed by the Coda, had found the Coda's armory. Chandler detonated the armory, blowing up the entire Coda base. Grifter and his friends were teleported away by Marlowe in time, but Andromache and her soldiers were caught in the blast.

Currently there are only few Earth-born Coda left. Majestrix Andromache was among the Coda fighting Grifter and his allies and died in the explosion. Recently, in the pages of ''Majestic'', [[Mister Majestic]] and Zealot have encountered Kherubim Coda Warriors on Earth. Also the Coda-traitor Charis (known as [[Nemesis (Wildstorm)|Nemesis]]) recently joined forces with the former WildC.A.T.s in the pages of ''Wildcats: Nemesis''. During the ''Wildstorm Armageddon'' story line The few remaining Coda were gathered up by the thought long dead Devin, formerly excommunicated acolyte of their order who survived into obscurity until the end of the world occurred. Gathering up the few remaining Coda survivors of the Post Apocalyptic world to create her own sisterhood, with her as Majestrix, which expanded its numbers through the weary travelers and soccer moms looking for safe respite that only her sect could provide, all while keeping any capable males captured as breeding labor in order to proliferate their ranks; Devin would eventually come into conflict with a past [[Caitlin Fairchild]] and her weathered survivor friends of [[Gen 13]].

==Notable members==
*Andromache, Kheran Majestrix of the Coda on Earth. Presumed dead.
*Artemis, a Kheran general who followed Zealot to Earth.
*Olympia Atreides, WildC.A.T.S. member and possibly the sole [[Daemonite]] Coda.
*Baroness Destine, killed by Zealot.
*Christine Blaze, Agent of [[International Operations]], infiltrated the Coda.
*Cassandra, Coda warrior stationed in the Himalayas. She killed Susanna Chaste and in return was killed by [[Divine Right (comic)|Max Faraday]] using her life-energy to resurrect Susanna. 
*Cordelia, Matriarch of the Coda and ruler of Melanesia. Former ally of [[Team 7]].
*Delphae, the Coda mystic/shaman with the power to open teleportation portals.
*Devin, disfigured assassin charged to capture Voodoo. Thought to have been expired in the second attempt but survives unto the future World's End event as Majestrix of remaining coda.
*The Grand Sarin, Coda assassin in special powered armour. Said to be the best assassin among the Earth-born Coda. Killed by Grifter in [[Ladytron (comics)|Ladytron]]'s body.
*[[Grifter (comics)|Grifter]], sole male Coda.
*Lady Harmony, mother of Lady Zannah and head of the Kheran Coda sect called the Skein. She was killed in battle.
*Sister Maxima is the only known over-weight Coda warrior. She's an earth born Coda and resides at the Coda Citadel off the coast of Africa.
*[[Nemesis (Wildstorm)|Nemesis]] (real name: Charis), a member of the Adrastea class from [[Kherubim|Khera]].
*[[Zealot (Wildstorm)|Zealot]], former Majestrix of the Coda of Earth

Note: both [[Savant (Wildstorm)|Savant]] and [[Voodoo (Wildstorm)|Voodoo]] have had Coda-training, but neither have devoted themselves enough to be considered true Coda warriors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1127">In [[theoretical physics]], '''composite gravity''' refers to models that attempted to derive [[general relativity]] in a framework where the [[graviton]] is constructed as a composite bound state of more elementary particles, usually [[fermion]]s. A theorem by [[Steven Weinberg]] and [[Edward Witten]] shows that this is not possible in [[Lorentz covariance|Lorentz covariant]] theories: massless particles with [[spin (physics)|spin]] greater than one are forbidden. The [[AdS/CFT correspondence]] may be viewed as a loophole in their argument. However, in this case not only the graviton is emergent; a whole [[spacetime]] dimension is emergent, too.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Emergency psychiatry''' is the clinical application of [[psychiatry]] in [[emergency medicine|emergency]] settings.&lt;ref name=Currier/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt; Conditions requiring psychiatric interventions may include [[failed suicide attempt|attempted suicide]], [[substance abuse]], [[clinical depression|depression]], [[psychosis]], violence or other rapid [[behavior|changes in behavior]]. Psychiatric emergency services are rendered by professionals in the fields of [[medicine]], [[nursing]], [[psychology]] and [[social work]].&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt; The demand for emergency psychiatric services has rapidly increased throughout the [[world]] since the 1960s, especially in [[urban area]]s.&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lipton/&gt; Care for patients in situations involving emergency psychiatry is complex.&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt;

Individuals may arrive in psychiatric emergency service settings through their own voluntary request, a referral from another health professional, or through [[involuntary commitment]]. Care of patients requiring psychiatric intervention usually encompasses crisis stabilization of many serious and potentially life-threatening conditions which could include acute or chronic [[mental illness|mental disorders]] or symptoms similar to those conditions.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt;

==Definition==
Symptoms and conditions behind psychiatric emergencies may include [[parasuicide|attempted]] [[suicide]], [[substance dependence]], [[alcohol intoxication]], acute [[clinical depression|depression]], presence of [[delusion]]s, violence, [[panic attack]]s, and significant, rapid changes in behavior.&lt;ref name=ClercqLamarreVergouwen&gt;De Clercq, M.; Lamarre, S.; Vergouwen, H. (1998). ''Emergency Psychiatry and Mental Health Policty: An International Point of View''. New York: Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt; Emergency psychiatry exists to identify and/or [[treatment of mental illness|treat]] these symptoms and psychiatric conditions. In addition, several rapidly lethal medical conditions present themselves with common psychiatric symptoms. A [[physician]]'s or a [[nurse]]'s ability to identify and intervene with these and other medical conditions is critical.&lt;ref name=Currier&gt;Currier, G.W. ''New Developments in Emergency Psychiatry: Medical, Legal, and Economic''. (1999). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Delivery of services==
The place where emergency psychiatric services are delivered are most commonly referred to as Psychiatric Emergency Services, Psychiatric Emergency Care Centers, or Comprehensive Psychiatric Emergency Programs. [[Mental health professional]]s from a wide area of disciplines, including [[medicine]], [[nursing]], [[psychology]], and [[social work]] in these settings alongside [[psychiatrist]]s and emergency [[physician]]s.&lt;ref name=Hillard&gt;Hillard, R. &amp; Zitek, B. (2004). ''Emergency Psychiatry''. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; The facilities, sometimes housed in a [[psychiatric hospital]], psychiatric ward, or [[emergency department]], provide immediate treatment to both voluntary and involuntary patients [[24 hours a day, 7 days a week]].&lt;ref name=USNews&gt;{{Cite web|publisher=US News &amp; World Report |accessdate=2007-07-15 |title=Glossary |url=http://health.usnews.com/usnews/health/hospitals/articles/glossary.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SFNAMI&gt;{{Cite web |publisher=NAMI-San Francisco |accessdate=2007-07-15 |title=Crisis Service |url=http://www.namisf.org/crisis-serv.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710103126/http://www.namisf.org/crisis-serv.html |archivedate=2007-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a protected environment, psychiatric emergency services exist to provide brief stay of two or three days to gain a diagnostic clarity, find appropriate alternatives to psychiatric hospitalization for the patient, and to treat those patients whose symptoms can be improved within that brief period of time.&lt;ref name=AllenM&gt;Allen, M.H. (1995). ''The Growth and Specialization of Emergency Psychiatry''. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Even precise psychiatric diagnoses are a secondary priority compared with interventions in a crisis setting.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt; The functions of psychiatric emergency services are to assess patients' problems, implement a short-term treatment consisting of no more than ten meetings with the patient, procure a 24-hour holding area, mobilize teams to carry out interventions at patients' residences, utilize emergency management services to prevent further crises, be aware of inpatient and outpatient psychiatric resources, and provide 24/7 [[telephone counseling]].&lt;ref name=Hillard2&gt;Hillard, J.R. (1990). ''Manual of Clinical Emergency Psychiatry''. Washington D.C.: American Psychiatric Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Expand section|date=January 2010}}
Since the 1960s the demand for emergency psychiatric services has endured a rapid growth due to [[deinstitutionalization]] both in [[Europe]] and the [[United States]]. Deinstitutionalization, in some locations, has resulted in a larger number of severely mentally ill people living in the community.  There have been increases in the number of medical specialties, and the multiplication of transitory treatment options, such as [[psychiatric medication]].&lt;ref name=Bassuk&gt;Bassuk, E.L. &amp; Birk, A.W. (1984). ''Emergency Psychiatry: Concepts, Methods, and Practices''. New York: Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lipton&gt;Lipton, F.R. &amp; Goldfinger, S.M. (1985). ''Emergency Psychiatry at the Crossroads''. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hedges&gt;Hedges, D. &amp; Burchfield, C. (2006). ''Mind, Brain, and Drug: An Introduction to Psychopharmacology''. Boston: Pearson Education.&lt;/ref&gt; The actual number of psychiatric emergencies has also increased significantly, especially in psychiatric emergency service settings located in [[urban area]]s.&lt;ref name=ClercqLamarreVergouwen/&gt;

Emergency psychiatry has involved the evaluation and treatment of unemployed, homeless and other disenfranchised populations. Emergency psychiatry services have sometimes been able to offer accessibility, convenience, and anonymity.&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt; While many of the patients who have used psychiatric emergency services shared common sociological and demographic characteristics, the symptoms and needs expressed have not conformed to any single psychiatric profile.&lt;ref name=Gerson&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gerson S, Bassuk E |title=Psychiatric emergencies: an overview |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=137 |issue=1 |pages=1–11 |year=1980 |pmid=6986089|doi=10.1176/ajp.137.1.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The individualized care needed for patients utilizing psychiatric emergency services is evolving, requiring an always changing and sometimes complex treatment approach.&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt;

==Scope==

===Suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts===
As of 2000, the [[World Health Organization]] estimated one million suicides in the world each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mental_health/prevention/suicide/suicideprevent/en/ |publisher=World Health Organization |title=Suicide prevention (SUPRE) |accessdate=2007-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are countless more suicide attempts. Psychiatric emergency service settings exist to treat the mental disorders associated with an increased risk of completed suicide or suicide attempts. Mental health professionals in these settings are expected to predict acts of violence patients may commit against themselves (or others), even though the complex factors leading to a suicide can stem from  many sources, including psychosocial, biological, interpersonal, anthropological, and religious. These mental health professionals will use any resources available to them to determine risk factors, make an overall assessment, and decide on any necessary treatment.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt;

===Violent behavior===
Aggression can be the result of both internal and external factors that create a measurable activation in the [[autonomic nervous system]]. This activation can become evident through symptoms such as the clenching of fists or jaw, pacing, slamming doors, hitting palms of hands with fists, or being easily startled. It is estimated that 17% of visits to psychiatric emergency service settings are [[homicide|homicidal]] in origin and an additional 5% involve both suicide and homicide.&lt;ref name=Hughes&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hughes DH |title=Suicide and violence assessment in psychiatry |journal=General hospital psychiatry |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=416–21 |year=1996 |pmid=8937907 |doi= 10.1016/S0163-8343(96)00037-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence is also associated with many conditions such as acute intoxication, acute psychosis, [[paranoid personality disorder]], [[antisocial personality disorder]], [[narcissistic personality disorder]] and [[borderline personality disorder]]. Additional risk factors have also been identified which may lead to violent behavior. Such risk factors may include prior arrests, presence of hallucinations, delusions or other neurological impairment, being uneducated, unmarried, etc.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt; Mental health professionals complete violence risk assessments to determine both security measures and treatments for the patient.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt;

===Psychosis===
Patients with [[psychotic]] symptoms are common in psychiatric emergency service settings. The determination of the source of the psychosis can be difficult.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt; Sometimes patients brought into the setting in a psychotic state have been disconnected from their previous treatment plan. While the psychiatric emergency service setting will not be able to provide long term care for these types of patients, it can exist to provide a brief respite and reconnect the patient to their case manager and/or reintroduce necessary psychiatric medication. A visit to a crisis unit by a patient suffering from a chronic mental disorder may also indicate the existence of an undiscovered precipitant, such as change in the lifestyle of the individual, or a shifting medical condition. These considerations can play a part in an improvement to an existing treatment plan.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt;

An individual could also be suffering from an acute onset of psychosis. Such conditions can be prepared for diagnosis by obtaining a medical or psychopathological history of a patient, performing a [[mental status examination]], conducting [[psychological testing]], obtaining [[neuroimaging|neuroimages]], and obtaining other neurophysiologic measurements. Following this, the mental health professional can perform a [[differential diagnosis]] and prepare the patient for treatment. As with other patient care considerations, the origins of acute psychosis can be difficult to determine because of the mental state of the patient. However, acute psychosis is classified as a medical emergency requiring immediate and complete attention. The lack of identification and treatment can result in suicide, homicide, or other violence.&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt;

===Substance dependence, abuse and intoxication===
[[Image:Psychoactive Drugs.jpg|right|thumb|Illicit [[psychoactive drugs]], a cause of psychotic symptoms.]]
Another common cause of psychotic symptoms is substance intoxication. These acute symptoms may resolve after a period of observation or limited psychopharmacological treatment. However the underlying issues, such as substance dependence or abuse, is difficult to treat in the emergency department, as it is a long term condition.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Both acute [[alcohol intoxication]] as well as other forms of substance abuse can require psychiatric interventions.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt; Acting as a [[depressant]] of the [[central nervous system]], the early effects of [[ethanol|alcohol]] are usually desired for and characterized by increased talkativeness, giddiness, and a loosening of social inhibitions. Besides considerations of impaired concentration, verbal and motor performance, insight, judgment and short term memory loss which could result in behavioral change causing injury or death, levels of alcohol below 60 milligrams per deciliter of blood are usually considered non-lethal. However, individuals at 200 milligrams per deciliter of blood are considered grossly intoxicated and concentration levels at 400 milligrams per deciliter of blood are lethal, causing complete [[anesthesia]] of the [[respiratory system]].&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt;

Beyond the dangerous behavioral changes that occur after the consumption of certain amounts of alcohol, idiosyncratic intoxication could occur in some individuals even after the consumption of relatively small amounts of alcohol. Episodes of this impairment usually consist of confusion, disorientation, delusions and visual [[hallucination]]s, increased aggressiveness, rage, agitation and violence. Chronic [[alcoholic]]s may also suffer from alcoholic hallucinosis, wherein the cessation of prolonged drinking may trigger auditory hallucinations. Such episodes can last for a few hours or an entire week. [[Antipsychotic]]s are often used to treat these symptoms.&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt;

Patients may also be treated for substance abuse following the [[route of administration|administration]] of psychoactive substances containing [[amphetamine]], [[caffeine]], [[tetrahydrocannabinol]], [[cocaine]], [[phencyclidine]]s, or other [[inhalant]]s, [[opioid]]s, [[sedative]]s, [[hypnotic]]s, [[anxiolytic]]s, [[psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants]]. Clinicians assessing and treating substance abusers must establish therapeutic rapport to counter [[denial]] and other negative attitudes directed towards treatment. In addition, the clinician must determine substances used, the route of administration, dosage, and time of last use to determine the necessary short and long term treatments. An appropriate choice of treatment setting must also be determined. These settings may include outpatient facilities, partial hospitals, residential treatment centers, or hospitals. Both the immediate and long term treatment and setting is determined by the severity of dependency and seriousness of physiological complications arising from the abuse.&lt;ref name= Hillard/&gt;

===Hazardous drug reactions and interactions===
[[Drug overdose|Overdoses]], [[drug interaction]]s, and dangerous reactions from psychiatric medications, especially antipsychotics, are considered psychiatric emergencies. [[Neuroleptic malignant syndrome]] is a potentially lethal complication of first or second generation antipsychotics.&lt;ref name=Hedges/&gt; If untreated, neuroleptic malignant syndrome can result in fever, muscle rigidity, confusion, unstable vital signs, or even death.&lt;ref name=Hedges/&gt; [[Serotonin syndrome]] can result when [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s or [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s mix with [[buspirone]].&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt; Severe symptoms of serotonin syndrome include [[hyperthermia]], delirium, and [[tachycardia]] that may lead to shock. Often patients with severe general medical symptoms, such as unstable vital signs, will be transferred to a general medical emergency department or medicine service for increased monitoring.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

===Personality disorders===
Disorders manifesting dysfunction in areas related to [[cognition]], [[affect (psychology)|affectivity]], interpersonal functioning and impulse control can be considered [[personality disorder]]s.&lt;ref name=DSM&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (2000). ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: Fourth Edition''. Washington D.C.: American Psychiatric Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Patients suffering from a personality disorder will usually not complain about symptoms resulting from their disorder. Patients suffering an emergency phase of a personality disorder may showcase combative or suspicious behavior, suffer from brief psychotic episodes, or be delusional. Compared with outpatient settings and the general population, the prevalence of individuals suffering from personality disorders in inpatient psychiatric settings is usually 7–25% higher. Clinicians working with such patients attempt to stabilize the individual to their baseline level of function.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt;

===Anxiety===
Patients suffering from an extreme case of [[anxiety]] may seek treatment when all support systems have been exhausted and they are unable to bear the anxiety. Feelings of anxiety may present in different ways from an underlying medical illness or psychiatric disorder, a secondary functional disturbance from another psychiatric disorder, from a primary psychiatric disorder such as [[panic disorder]] or [[generalized anxiety disorder]], or as a result of stress from such conditions as [[adjustment disorder]] or [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]. Clinicians usually attempt to first provide a "safe harbor" for the patient so that assessment processes and treatments can be adequately facilitated.&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt; The initiation of treatments for mood and anxiety disorders are important as patients suffering from anxiety disorders have a higher risk of premature death.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt;

===Disasters===
[[Natural disaster]]s and [[man-made hazards]] can cause severe psychological stress in victims surrounding the event. [[Emergency management]] often includes psychiatric emergency services designed to help victims cope with the situation. The impact of disasters can cause people to feel shocked, overwhelmed, immobilized, panic-stricken, or confused. Hours, days, months and even years after a disaster, individuals can experience tormenting memories, vivid nightmares, develop apathy, withdrawal, memory lapses, fatigue, loss of appetite, insomnia, depression, irritability, panic attacks, or dysphoria.&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt;

Due to the typically disorganized and hazardous environment following a disaster, mental health professionals typically assess and treat patients as rapidly as possible. Unless a condition is threatening life of the patient, or others around the patient, other medical and basic survival considerations are managed first. Soon after a disaster clinicians may make themselves available to allow individuals to ventilate to relieve feelings of isolation, helplessness and vulnerability. Dependent upon the scale of the disaster, many victims may suffer from both chronic or acute [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]. Patients suffering severely from this disorder often are admitted to psychiatric hospitals to stabilize the individual.&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt;

===Abuse===
Incidents of [[physical abuse]], [[sexual abuse]] or [[rape]] can result in dangerous outcomes to the victim of the criminal act. Victims may suffer from extreme anxiety, fear, helplessness, confusion, eating or sleeping disorders, hostility, guilt and shame. Managing the response usually encompasses coordinating psychological, medical and legal considerations. Dependent upon legal requirements in the region, mental health professionals may be required to report criminal activity to a police force. Mental health professionals will usually gather identifying data during the initial assessment and refer the patient, if necessary, to receive medical treatment. Medical treatment may include a [[physical examination]], collection of medicolegal evidence, and determination of the risk of [[pregnancy]], if applicable.&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt;

==Treatment==
Treatments in psychiatric emergency service settings are typically transitory in nature and only exist to provide dispositional solutions and/or to stabilize life-threatening conditions.&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt; Once stabilized, patients suffering chronic conditions may be transferred to a setting which can provide long term [[psychiatric rehabilitation]].&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt; Prescribed treatments within the emergency service setting vary dependent upon the patient's condition.&lt;ref name=Walker&gt;Walker, J.I. (1983) ''Psychiatric Emergencies''. Philadelphia: J.B. Lippincott.&lt;/ref&gt; Different forms of psychiatric medication, [[psychotherapy]], or [[electroconvulsive therapy]] may be used in the emergency setting.&lt;ref name= Walker/&gt;&lt;ref name=RundHutzler&gt;Rund, D.A, &amp; Hutzler, J.C. (1983). ''Emergency Psychiatry''. St. Louis: The C.V. Mosby Company.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Potter&gt;Potter, M. (2007, May 31). ''[http://www.nihrc.org/dms/data/NIHRC/attachments/dd/files/91/Mental_health_issues_(Michael_Potter).pdf Setting the Standards: Human Rights and Health – Mental Health]''. Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission.&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction and efficacy of psychiatric medication as a treatment option in psychiatry has reduced the utilization of physical restraints in emergency settings, by reducing dangerous symptoms resulting from acute exacerbation of mental illness or substance intoxication.&lt;ref name=RundHutzler/&gt;

===Medications===
With time as a critical aspect of emergency psychiatry, the rapidity of effect is an important consideration.&lt;ref name=RundHutzler/&gt; [[Pharmacokinetics]] is the movement of drugs through the body with time and is at least partially reliant upon the [[route of administration]], [[absorption (pharmacokinetics)|absorption]], [[distribution (pharmacology)|distribution]] and [[metabolism]] of the medication.&lt;ref name=Hedges/&gt;&lt;ref name=HolfordSheiner&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Holford N.H.G |author2=Sheiner L.B. | year = 1981 | title = Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling in vivo | url = | journal = CRC Critical Reviews in Bioengineering | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 273–322 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A common route of administration is oral administration, however if this method is to work the drug must be able to get to the stomach and stay there.&lt;ref name=Hedges/&gt; In cases of [[vomiting]] and nausea this method of administration is not an option. [[Suppositories]] can, in some situations, be administered instead.&lt;ref name=Hedges/&gt; Medication can also be administered through [[intramuscular injection]], or through [[intravenous therapy|intravenous injection]].&lt;ref name=Hedges/&gt;

The amount of time required for absorption varies dependent upon many factors including drug [[solubility]], gastrointestinal [[motility]] and [[pH]].&lt;ref name=Hedges/&gt; If a medication is administered orally the amount of [[food]] in the stomach may also affect the rate of absorption.&lt;ref name=Hedges/&gt; Once absorbed medications must be distributed throughout the body, or usually with the case of psychiatric medication, past the [[blood–brain barrier]] to the [[brain]].&lt;ref name=Hedges/&gt; With all of these factors affecting the rapidity of effect, the time until the effects are evident varies. Generally, though, the timing with medications is relatively fast and can occur within several minutes. As an example, physicians usually expect to see a remission of symptoms thirty minutes after [[haloperidol]], an antipsychotic, is administered intramuscularly.&lt;ref name=RundHutzler/&gt; [[Antipsychotics]], especially [[Haloperidol]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=3298219|year=2012|author1=Wilson|first1=M. P.|title=The Psychopharmacology of Agitation: Consensus Statement of the American Association for Emergency Psychiatry Project BETA Psychopharmacology Workgroup|journal=Western Journal of Emergency Medicine|volume=13|issue=1|pages=26–34|last2=Pepper|first2=D|last3=Currier|first3=G. W.|last4=Holloman Jr|first4=G. H.|last5=Feifel|first5=D|doi=10.5811/westjem.2011.9.6866|pmid=22461918}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as assorted [[benzodiazepines]] are the most frequently used drugs in emergency psychiatry, especially agitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=2507712|year=2008|author1=Wilhelm|first1=S|title=Use of antipsychotics and benzodiazepines in patients with psychiatric emergencies: Results of an observational trial|journal=BMC Psychiatry|volume=8|pages=61|last2=Schacht|first2=A|last3=Wagner|first3=T|doi=10.1186/1471-244X-8-61|pmid=18647402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychotherapy===
Other treatment methods may be used in psychiatric emergency service settings. [[Brief therapy|Brief psychotherapy]] can be used to treat acute conditions or immediate problems as long as the patient understands his or her issues are psychological, the patient trusts the physician, the physician can encourage hope for change, the patient has motivation to change, the physician is aware of the psychopathological history of the patient, and the patient understands that their confidentiality will be respected.&lt;ref name=RundHutzler/&gt; The process of brief therapy under emergency psychiatric conditions includes the establishment of a primary complaint from the patient, realizing psychosocial factors, formulating an accurate representation of the problem, coming up with ways to solve the problem, and setting specific goals.&lt;ref name=RundHutzler/&gt; The information gathering aspect of brief psychotherapy is therapeutic because it helps the patient place his or her problem in the proper perspective.&lt;ref name=RundHutzler/&gt; If the physician determines that deeper psychotherapy sessions are required, he or she can transition the patient out of the emergency setting and into an appropriate clinic or center.&lt;ref name=RundHutzler/&gt;

===ECT===
[[Electroconvulsive therapy]] is a controversial form of treatment which [[5150 (Involuntary psychiatric hold)#Additional rights|cannot be involuntarily applied]] in psychiatric emergency service settings.&lt;ref name=RundHutzler/&gt;&lt;ref name=Potter/&gt; Instances wherein a patient is depressed to such a severe degree that the patient cannot be stopped from hurting himself or herself or when a patient refuses to swallow, eat or drink medication, electroconvulsive therapy could be suggested as a therapeutic alternative.&lt;ref name=RundHutzler/&gt; While preliminary research suggests that electroconvulsive therapy may be an effective treatment for depression, it usually requires a course of six to twelve sessions of convulsions lasting at least 20 seconds for those antidepressant effects to occur.&lt;ref name=Hedges/&gt;

==Observation and collateral information==
There are other essential aspects of emergency psychiatry: observation and collateral information. The observation of the patient's behavior is an important aspect of emergency psychiatry inasmuch as it allows the clinicians working with the patient to estimate prognosis and improvements/declines in condition. Many jurisdictions base involuntary commitment on dangerousness or the inability to care for one's basic needs. Observation for a period of time may help determine this. For example, if a patient who is committed for violent behavior in the community, continues to behave in an erratic manner without clear purpose, this will help the staff decide that hospital admission may be needed.

Collateral information or parallel information is information obtained from family, friends or treatment providers of the patient. Some jurisdictions require consent from the patient to obtain this information while others do not. For example, with a patient who is thought to be paranoid about people following him or spying on him, this information can be helpful discern if these thoughts are more or less likely to be based in reality. Past episodes of suicide attempts or violent behavior can be confirmed or disproven.

==Disposition==
Patient receive emergency services often on a time limited basis such as 24 or 72 hours. After this time, and sometimes earlier, the staff must decide the next place for the patient to receive services. This is referred to as disposition. This is one of the essential features of emergency psychiatry.

===Hospital admission===
[[Image:EmergencyPsychiatryProcess.PNG|thumb|right|The emergency care process.]]
The staff will need to determine if the patient needs to be admitted to a psychiatric inpatient facility or if they can be safely discharged to the community after a period of observation and/or brief treatment.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Initial emergency psychiatric evaluations usually involve patients who are acutely agitated, [[paranoid]], or who are suicidal. Initial evaluations to determine admission and interventions are designed to be as therapeutic as possible.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt;

====Involuntary commitment====
[[Involuntary commitment]], or sectioning, refers to situations where [[police officer]]s, health officers, or [[Health care provider|health professionals]] classify an individual as dangerous to themselves, others, [[5150 (Involuntary psychiatric hold)#5150 criteria|gravely disabled]], or mentally ill according to the applicable government law for the region. After an individual is transported to a psychiatric emergency service setting, a preliminary professional assessment is completed which may or may not result in [[involuntary treatment]].&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt; Some patients may be discharged shortly after being brought to psychiatric emergency services while others will require longer observation and the need for continued involuntary commitment will exist. While some patients may initially come voluntarily, it may be realized that they pose a risk to themselves or others and involuntary commitment may be initiated at that point.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

====Referrals and voluntary hospitalization====
In some locations, such as the United States, voluntary hospitalizations are outnumbered by involuntary commitments partly due to the fact that insurance tends not to pay for hospitalization unless an imminent danger exists to the individual or community. In addition, psychiatric emergency service settings admit approximately one third of patients from [[assertive community treatment]] centers.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt; Therefore, patients who are not admitted will be referred to services in the community.

[[File:Suicide-deaths-per-100000-trend.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Suicide-deaths-per-100000-trend]]

An estimated 1 million people worldwide die by [[suicide]] every year. It is estimated that global annual suicide fatalities could rise to over 1.5 million by 2020. Globally, suicide ranks among the three leading causes of death among those aged 15–44 years. Attempted suicides are up to 20 times more frequent than completed ones.

[[Incidence (epidemiology)|Incidence]] of suicide in a society depends on a range of factors. [[Clinical depression]] is an especially common cause. [[Substance abuse]] and severe physical disease or infirmity are also recognized as causes. The [[Eastern Europe]] and  [[East Asia]] regions have the highest [[suicide rate]] worldwide. The region with the lowest suicide rate is the [[Caribbean]], followed by the [[Middle East]].

[[Gender differences in suicide|Gender difference]]s play a significant role in suicide as well. Furthermore, among all age groups in most of the world, females tend to show higher rates of reported nonfatal suicidal behaviors, while males have a much higher rate of completed suicides.

== Overview ==
In most countries the incidence of suicides is higher than the incidence of intentional [[homicide]]s. More people die of suicide than die of war and murder.&lt;ref name=rtenews&gt;{{cite news|title=World Suicide Prevention Day is marked |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2004/0910/suicide.html|accessdate=11 June 2012 |newspaper=Raidió Teilifís Éireann|date=10 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 report by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) states that nearly a million people take their own lives every year, more than those murdered or killed in war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

According to the [[National Institute of Mental Health]], [[suicide contagion]] is a serious problem, especially for young people. Suicide can be facilitated in vulnerable teens by exposure to real or fictional accounts of suicide, including media coverage of suicide, such as intensive reporting of the suicide of a celebrity or idol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{See also|List of countries by suicide rate}}

Suicide rates are highest in Europe's [[Baltic states]], where around 40 people per 100,000 die by suicide each year. The lowest rates are found mainly in Caribbean/West Indies nations and a few countries in Asia.&lt;ref name="Staff 2002"/&gt;

In the [[United States]], [[male]]s are four times more likely to die by suicide than [[female]]s, although more women than men report suicide attempts and [[self-harm]] with suicidal intentions. Male suicide rates are higher than females in all age groups (the ratio varies from 3:1 to 10:1). In other western countries, males are also much more likely to die by suicide than females (usually by a factor of 3–4:1). It was the 8th leading cause of death for males, and 19th leading cause of death for females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2003, in the United States, whites and Asians were nearly 2.5 times more likely to kill themselves than were blacks or Hispanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Hoyert

The likelihood of suicide attempts are increased in both gay males and lesbians, as well as bisexuals of both sexes when compared to their heterosexual counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1300/J035v15n03_06 |title=Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual College Students |year=2001 |last1=Westefeld |first1=John |first2=Michael |first3=Brian |first4=Steve |journal=Journal of College Student Psychotherapy |volume=15 |pages=71–82 |last2=Maples |last3=Buford |last4=Taylor |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fergusson DM, Horwood LJ, Ridder EM, Beautrais AL |title=Sexual orientation and mental health in a birth cohort of young adults |journal=Psychological Medicine |volume=35 |issue=7 |pages=971–81 |date=July 2005 |pmid=16045064 |doi=10.1017/S0033291704004222}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Silenzio VM, Pena JB, Duberstein PR, Cerel J, Knox KL |title=Sexual Orientation and Risk Factors for Suicidal Ideation and Suicide Attempts Among Adolescents and Young Adults |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=97 |issue=11 |pages=2017–9 |date=November 2007 |pmid=17901445 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2006.095943 |pmc=2040383}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gender and suicide|trend of having a higher incident rate]] among females is no exception with lesbians or bisexual females and when compared with homosexual males, lesbians are more likely to attempt than gay or bisexual males.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucalgary.ca/~ramsay/attempted-suicide-gay-lesbian-all-studies.htm Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual &amp; Transgender "Attempted Suicide" Incidences/Risks Suicidality Studies From 1970 to 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sandfort, T; et al.  Lesbian and Gay Studies: An Introductory, Interdisciplinary Approach.  Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Race and age play a factor in the increased risk. The highest ratios for males are attributed to caucasians when they are in their youth. By the age of 25, their risk is down to less than half of what it was however black gay males risk steadily increases to 8.6 times more likely. Through a lifetime the risks are 5.7 for white and 12.8 for black gay and bisexual males.&lt;ref name="intro"/&gt;

Lesbian and bisexual females have opposite effects with less attempts in youth when compared to heterosexual females. Through a lifetime the likelihood to attempt nearly triple the youth 1.1 ratio for caucasian females, however for black females the rate is affected very little (less than 0.1 to 0.3 difference) with heterosexual black females having a slightly higher risk throughout most of the age-based study.&lt;ref name="intro"/&gt;

Gay and lesbian youth who attempt suicide are disproportionately subject to anti-gay attitudes, and have weaker skills for coping with discrimination, isolation, and loneliness,&lt;ref name="intro"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rotheram-Boris, et al. (1994); Proctor and Groze (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; and were more likely to experience family rejection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ryan C, Huebner D, Diaz RM, Sanchez J |title=Family rejection as a predictor of negative health outcomes in white and Latino lesbian, gay, and bisexual young adults |journal=Pediatrics |volume=123 |issue=1 |pages=346–52 |date=January 2009 |pmid=19117902 |doi=10.1542/peds.2007-3524}}&lt;/ref&gt; than those who do not attempt suicide.

One study found that same-sex sexual behavior, but not homosexual attraction or homosexual identity, was significantly predictive of suicide among Norwegian adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wichstrøm L, Hegna K |title=Sexual orientation and suicide attempt: a longitudinal study of the general Norwegian adolescent population |journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology |volume=112 |issue=1 |pages=144–51 |date=February 2003 |pmid=12653422 |doi=10.1037/0021-843X.112.1.144}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Denmark, the age-adjusted suicide mortality risk for men in registered domestic partnerships was nearly eight times greater than for men with positive histories of heterosexual marriage and nearly twice as high for men who had never married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mathy RM, Cochran SD, Olsen J, Mays VM |title=The association between relationship markers of sexual orientation and suicide: Denmark, 1990–2001 |journal=Soc Psychiatry Psychiatr Epidemiol |volume= 46|issue= 2|pages= 111–7|date=December 2009 |pmid=20033129 |doi=10.1007/s00127-009-0177-3 |pmc=3034881}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of suicide, undertaken in Sweden, involved the analysis of data records for 6,456 [[Same-sex marriage|same-sex married]] couples and 1,181,723 man-women marriages.  Even with [[LGBT rights in Sweden|Sweden's tolerant attitude regarding homosexuality]], it was determined that for same-sex married men the suicide risk was nearly three times higher than for different-sex married men, even after an adjustment for HIV status.  For women, it was shown that there was a tentatively elevated suicide risk for same-sex married women over that of different-sex married women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10654-016-0154-6  |title=Suicide in married couples in Sweden: Is the risk greater in same-sex couples |author=Björkenstam, Charlotte et al|date=11 May 2016|work=[[European Journal of Epidemiology]]|doi=10.1007/s10654-016-0154-6 | accessdate=27 November 2016 |volume=31 |pages=685–690}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social factors===
Higher levels of social and national cohesion reduce suicide rates. Suicide levels are highest among the retired, [[unemployment|unemployed]], [[Poverty|impoverished]], [[divorce]]d, the childless, urbanites,{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} [[empty nester]]s, and other people who live alone. Suicide rates also rise during times of economic uncertainty. (Although [[poverty]] is not a direct cause, it can contribute to the risk of suicide).&lt;ref name="Diego De Leo &amp; Russell Evans Griffith University 2003"&gt;{{cite web

[[Epidemiology|Epidemiological]] studies generally show a relationship between suicide or suicidal behaviors and socio-economic disadvantage, including limited educational achievement, [[homelessness]], unemployment, economic dependence, and contact with the [[police]] or justice system.&lt;ref name="Diego De Leo &amp; Russell Evans Griffith University 2003"/&gt; [[War]] is traditionally believed to be associated with a fall in suicide rates; however, this has been questioned in recent studies, showing a more complex picture than previously conceived.&lt;ref&gt;Changes in Scottish suicide rates during the Second World War.

A 2015 UK study by the [[Office for National Statistics]], commissioned by [[Public Health England]], which considered 18,998 deaths of people aged between 20 and 64, found that men working in the construction industry and women employed in culture, media and sport, healthcare and primary school teaching were at the highest risk of suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/mar/17/male-construction-workers-greatest-risk-suicide-england-study-finds|title=Male construction workers at greatest risk of suicide, study finds|first=Haroon|last=Siddique|date=17 March 2017|publisher=|accessdate=19 March 2017|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health and suicide===
[[File:Relationship between bmi and suicide.png|thumb|Risk of suicide decreases with increased body mass index in the United States.&lt;ref name="pmid19907331"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mukamal KJ, Rimm EB, Kawachi I, O'Reilly EJ, Calle EE, Miller M |title=Body Mass Index and Risk of Suicide Among One Million US Adults |journal=Epidemiology |volume= 21|issue= 1|pages= 82–6|date=November 2009 |pmid=19907331 |doi=10.1097/EDE.0b013e3181c1fa2d |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Major depressive disorder|Depression]], either unipolar or as part of [[bipolar disorder]], is an especially common cause. [[Substance abuse]], severe physical disease or infirmity are also recognized causes.

An unknown number of suicidal fatalities are falsely presumed to be the consequences of severe illnesses, infectious, malignant, mental et cetera.{{clarify|date=August 2016}}

====Suicide and body mass index====
Risk of suicide may decrease with increased weight and is low in [[obesity|obese persons]].&lt;ref name="pmid19907331" /&gt; The connection is not well understood, but it is hypothesized that elevated body weight results in higher circulating levels of [[tryptophan]], [[serotonin]], and [[leptin]], which in turn reduces [[impulsivity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ottar Bjerkeset |author2=Pål Romundstad |author3=Jonathan Evans |author4=David Gunnell |title=Association of Adult Body Mass Index and Height with Anxiety, Depression, and Suicide in the General Population|journal=Am.

However, other studies indicate that suicide rates increase with extreme obesity, and it is difficult to control for conflating factors such as BMI-related differences in longevity, which have a significant bearing on suicide rates.&lt;ref name="Depression and anxiety"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wagner|first=B|title=Extreme obesity is associated with suicidal behavior and suicide attempts in adults: results of a population-based representative sample|work=Depression and Anxiety|publisher=Wiley Periodicals, Inc.|pmid=23576272|doi=10.1002/da.22105|volume=30|pages=975–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seasonal suicide===
{{main|Seasonal effects on suicide rates}}
The idea that suicide is more common during the winter holidays (including [[Christmas]] in the [[northern hemisphere]]) is actually a myth, generally reinforced by media coverage associating suicide with the holiday season. The [[National Center for Health Statistics]] found that suicides drop during the winter months, and peak during spring and early summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=17344747|title=Study: Suicides Drop During Holidays|publisher=|accessdate=19 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ViolencePrevention/suicide/holiday.html|title=Holiday Suicides: Fact or Myth-Suicide-Violence Prevention-Injury Center-CDC|publisher=|accessdate=19 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Considering that there is a correlation between the winter season and rates of depression,&lt;ref&gt;See [[Seasonal affective disorder]]&lt;/ref&gt; there are theories that this might be accounted for by capability to commit suicide and relative cheerfulness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/2013085-overview|title=Suicide: Practice Essentials, Overview, Etiology|date=28 October 2016|publisher=|accessdate=19 March 2017|via=eMedicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suicide has also been linked to other seasonal factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/820241.stm|title=BBC News - HEALTH - Suicide 'linked to' the moon|publisher=|accessdate=19 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The variation in suicides by day of week is actually greater than any seasonal variation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/31780455/ns/health-mental_health/t/deadliest-day-suicides-wednesday/] NBC News article referencing a study published in Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suicide trends===
Certain time trends can be related to the type of death. In the [[United Kingdom]], for example, the steady rise in suicides from 1945 to 1962-63 was probably to some extent curtailed following the removal of [[carbon monoxide]] from domestic gas supplies which occurred with the change from [[coal gas]] to [[natural gas]] during the sixties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | jstor = 25565893 | last1 = Kreitman | first1 = N. | title = The coal gas story.

It is estimated that global annual suicide fatalities could rise to 1.5 million by 2020.
Worldwide, suicide ranks among the three leading causes of death among those aged 15–44 years. Suicide attempts are up to 20 times more frequent than completed suicides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Since March 2018, [[Euthanasia#Passive euthanasia|passive euthanasia]] is legal in India under strict guidelines. Patients must consent through a [[living will]], and must be either terminally ill or in a vegetative state.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://m.economictimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/the-aruna-shanbaug-case-which-changed-euthanasia-laws-in-india/a-landmark-verdict/amp-slideshow/6323107.cms.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Court verdicts on Euthanasia ==
On 9 March 2018 the Supreme Court of India legalised passive [[euthanasia]] by means of the withdrawal of [[life support]] to patients in a [[permanent vegetative state]]. The decision was made as part of the verdict in a case involving [[Aruna Shanbaug]], who had been in a Persistent Vegetative State (PVS) until her death in 2015.

On 9 March 2018, the Supreme Court of India, passed a historic judgement-law permitting Passive Euthanasia in the country. This judgment was passed in wake of Pinki Virani’s plea to lust highest court in December 2009 under the Constitutional provision of “Next Friend”. It’s a landmark law which places the power of choice in the hands of the individual, over government, medical or religious control which sees all suffering as “destiny”. The Supreme Court specified two irreversible conditions to permit Passive Euthanasia Law in its 2011 Law: (I) The brain-dead for whom the ventilator can be switched off (II) Those in a Persistent Vegetative State (PVS) for whom the feed can be tapered out and pain-managing palliatives be added, according to laid-down international specifications.

The same judgement-law also asked for the scrapping of 309, the code which penalises those who survive suicide-attempts. In December 2014, government of India declared it's intention to do so.

However, on 25 February 2014, a three-judge bench of Supreme Court of India had termed the judgment in the ''Aruna Shanbaug case to be 'inconsistent in itself' and has referred the issue of euthanasia to its five-judge [[Supreme Court of India#Size of the court|Constitution bench]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://onelawstreet.com/2014/02/common-cause-a-regd-society-v-union-of-india-2014-5-scc-338-euthanasia-reference-to-constitution-bench/|title = Common Cause (A Regd. Society) v. Union of India – (2014) 5 SCC 338 [Euthanasia reference to Constitution Bench]|date = 24 February 2014|accessdate = 18 May 2015|website = 1, Law Street|publisher = Supreme Court of India|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

And on December 23, 2014, Government of India endorsed and re-validated the Passive Euthanasia judgement-law in a Press Release, after stating in the Rajya Sabha as follows: that The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in its judgment dated 7.3.2011 [WP (Criminal) No. 115 of 2009], while dismissing the plea for mercy killing in a particular case, laid down comprehensive guidelines to process cases relating to passive euthanasia. Thereafter, the matter of mercy killing was examined in consultation with the Ministry of Law and Justice and it has been decided that since the Hon'ble Supreme Court has already laid down the guidelines, these should be followed and treated as law in such cases. At present, there is no proposal to enact legislation on this subject and the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court is binding on all. The Health Minister, J P Nadda stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha.

The high court rejected active euthanasia by means of lethal injection. In the absence of a law regulating euthanasia in India, the court stated that its decision becomes the law of the land until the [[Indian parliament]] enacts a suitable law.&lt;ref name="Hindu1"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article1516644.ece| title=Supreme Court disallows friend's plea for mercy killing of vegetative Aruna | publisher=The Hindu| date=7 March 2011| accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-03-07/india/28665650_1_passive-euthanasia-life-support-path-breaking| title=Aruna Shanbaug case: SC allows passive euthanasia in path-breaking judgment| publisher=The Times of India| date=7 March 2011| accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Euthanasia|Active euthanasia]], including the administration of lethal compounds for the purpose of ending life, is still illegal in India, and in most countries.&lt;ref name="LA-times"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-india-euthanasia-20110308,0,1497102.story|title=India's Supreme Court lays out euthanasia guidelines|publisher=LA Times|date=8 March 2011|accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 the Supreme Court of India declared through a five-judge Constitution bench that, if strict guidelines are followed, the government would honor "[[living wills]]" allowing consenting patients to be passively euthanized if the patient suffers from a terminal illness or is in a vegetative state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=India allows 'living wills' for terminally ill|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-43341155|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=BBC News|date=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aruna Shanbaug case==
{{Main|Aruna Shanbaug Case}}
Aruna Shanbaug was a nurse working at the [[King Edward Memorial Hospital and Seth Gordhandas Sunderdas Medical College|King Edward Memorial Hospital]], [[Parel]], [[Mumbai]]. On 27 November 1973 she was strangled and sodomized by Sohanlal Walmiki, a sweeper. During the attack she was strangled with a chain, and the deprivation of oxygen has left her in a vegetative state ever since. She has been treated at KEM since the incident and is kept alive by feeding tube. On behalf of Aruna, her friend [[Pinki Virani]], a social activist, filed a petition in the Supreme Court arguing that the "continued existence of Aruna is in violation of her right to live in dignity". The Supreme Court made its decision on 7 March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/after-36-yrs-of-immobility-a-fresh-hope-of/555048/| title=After 36 yrs of immobility, a fresh hope of death| publisher=Indian Express| date=17 December 2009| accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court rejected the plea to discontinue Aruna's life support but issued a set of broad guidelines legalising passive euthanasia in India. The Supreme Court's decision to reject the discontinuation of Aruna's life support was based on the fact that the hospital staff who treat and take care of her did not support euthanizing her.&lt;ref name="Hindu1"/&gt; She died from pneumonia on 18 May 2015, after being in a coma for a period of 42 years.

==Supreme Court decision==
While rejecting Pinki Virani's plea for Aruna Shanbaug's euthanasia, the court laid out guidelines for passive euthanasia.&lt;ref name="Hindu1"/&gt; According to these guidelines, passive euthanasia involves the withdrawing of treatment or food that would allow the patient to live.&lt;ref name="LA-times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-12662124|title=India court rejects Aruna Shanbaug euthanasia plea|publisher=BBC|date=7 March 2011|accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forms of active euthanasia, including the administration of lethal compounds, legal in a number of nations and jurisdictions including [[Luxembourg|Luxemburg]], [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]], as well as the US states of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Oregon]], are still illegal in India.&lt;ref name="LA-times" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Times-Widely" /&gt;

Elsewhere in the world active euthanasia is almost always illegal.&lt;ref name="Times-Widely"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-03-08/india/28667689_1_euthanasia-fatal-injection-terminally-ill-patients|title=Euthanasia: Widely debated, rarely approved|date=8 March 2011|accessdate=8 March 2011|publisher=Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legal status of passive euthanasia, on the other hand, including the withdrawal of nutrition or water, varies across the nations of the world.&lt;ref name=gov&gt;[https://fam.state.gov/FAM/07FAM/07FAM0200apE.html 7 FAM 200 Appendix E: Death with Dignity.] US Department of State Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 7.&lt;/ref&gt; As India had no law about euthanasia, the Supreme Court's guidelines are law until and unless Parliament passes legislation.&lt;ref name="LA-times" /&gt; India's [[Ministry of Law and Justice (India)|Minister of Law and Justice]], [[Veerappa Moily]], called for serious political debate over the issue.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; The following guidelines were laid down:
# A decision has to be taken to discontinue life support either by the parents or the spouse or other close relatives, or in the absence of any of them, such a decision can be taken even by a person or a body of persons acting as a next friend. It can also be taken by the doctors attending the patient. However, the decision should be taken bona fide in the best interest of the patient.
# Even if a decision is taken by the near relatives or doctors or next friend to withdraw life support, such a decision requires presence of two witness and countersigned by first class judicial magistrate, and should also be approved by a medical board set up by the hospital.

== Reference to Constitution Bench ==
On 25 February 2014, while hearing a PIL filed by NGO Common Cause, a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India observed that the judgment in ''Aruna Shanbaug'' case was based on a wrong interpretation of the constitution bench judgment in ''Gian Kaur v. State of Punjab''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Between life and death for 42 long years, Aruna Shanbaug passes away|url = http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/in-coma-for-42-years-kem-nurse-aruna-shanbaug-passes-away/|website = The Indian Express|publisher = |date = 2015-05-19|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Court observed that the judgment in inconsistent in itself as though it observes that euthanasia can be allowed only by legislature yet it goes on to lay down guidelines on the same. Therefore, court has referred the issue to a constitution bench which shall be heard by a strength of at least five judges. Court observed:&lt;blockquote&gt;''In view of the inconsistent opinions rendered in Aruna Shanbaug (supra) and also considering the important question of law involved which needs to be reflected in the light of social, legal, medical and constitutional perspective, it becomes extremely important to have a clear enunciation of law. Thus, in our cogent opinion, the question of law involved requires careful consideration by a Constitution Bench of this Court for the benefit of humanity as a whole.''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The Five-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court was tasked with deciding whether Article 21 of the Constitution includes in its ambit the right to die with dignity by means of executing a living wills/advance directives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://scobserver.clpr.org.in/cases/whether-right-life-includes-right-die/|title=Euthanasia, Living Wills, &amp; the Right to Die - Supreme Court Observer|work=Supreme Court Observer|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==
After the court ruling ''[[The Telegraph (Kolkata)|The Telegraph]]'' consulted with Muslim, Hindu, Jain and Christian religious leaders. Though generally against legalising euthanasia, Christians and the Jains thought passive euthanasia was acceptable under some circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1110308/jsp/nation/story_13683131.jsp|title=Faiths take nuanced view|publisher=The Telegraph - Calcutta|date=7 March 2011|accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jains and Hindus have the traditional rituals ''[[Santhara]]'' and ''[[Prayopavesa]]'' respectively, wherein one fasts unto death. The Jain vow of ''sallekhanā'' or ''santhara'', is observed by the Jains only in special circumstances. These are mentioned in the Jain texts like ''[[Ratnakaranda śrāvakācāra]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Jain |first=Champat Rai |authorlink=Champat Rai Jain |url=https://archive.org/details/TheRatnaKarandaSravakachara |title=The Ratna Karanda Sravakachara |publisher=The Central Jaina Publishing House |date=1917}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some members of India's medical establishment were skeptical about euthanasia due to the country's weak rule of law and the large gap between the rich and the poor, which might lead to the exploitation of the elderly by their families.&lt;ref name="LA-times" /&gt;

Reporters for [[Reuters]] observed in 2018 that "The issue is not considered politically contentious in India."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=India's top court upholds passive euthanasia, allows living wills|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-court-euthanasia/indias-top-court-upholds-passive-euthanasia-allows-living-wills-in-landmark-judgment-idUSKCN1GL0MF|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=Reuters|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Franklin Benjamin Gowen''' (February 9, 1836 – December 13, 1889) served as president of the [[Reading Company|Philadelphia and Reading Railroad]] (commonly referred to as the  Reading Railroad) in the 1870s/80s. He is identified with the undercover infiltration and subsequent court prosecutions of [[Molly Maguires]], mine workers, saloonkeepers and low-level local political figures arraigned and tried for multiple acts of violence, including murders and attempted murders of coal mine operators, foremen and workers, and peace officers.&lt;ref&gt;''Report of the Committee of the Judiciary, General, of the Senate of Pennsylvania, in Relation to the Anthracite Coal Difficulties, with the Accompanying Testimony'', Harrisburg, 1871; pp 14–15, 19, 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Other aspects of Gowen's presidency that merit consideration include:
* Despite the Reading Railroad being legally prohibited by its corporate charter from owning or operating coal mines, under Gowen's leadership the railroad obtained 142 square miles (368&amp;nbsp;km²) of coal lands and illegally ran numerous mining operations upon them,{{sfnp|Daggett|1908|p=77}} but the state of Pennsylvania deemed the prohibition to be unenforceable.
* He was a central figure in negotiating both the first written labor agreement between mine workers and operators in the U.S., and the first industry-wide [[price-fixing]] agreement in the U.S. {{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}
* He played a signal role in the [[Great Railroad Strike of 1877]], including the [[Reading Railroad Massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, Douglas L., "Reading's Place in The Great Strike &amp; After", ''The Historical Review of Berks County'', Fall 2000 (also available [http://www.berkshistory.org/articles/railroad.html online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070804153037/http://www.berkshistory.org/articles/railroad.html |date=2007-08-04 }}).&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Under his leadership the Reading Railroad twice fell into [[Bankruptcy in the United States|bankruptcy]].&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed case study, see Daggett, Chapter III&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the second one, Gowen was finally blocked from further direct involvement in the railroad's affairs when a syndicate led by [[J.P. Morgan]] obtained control of the corporation. {{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

==Early years==
Franklin Benjamin Gowen was born in [[Mount Airy, Philadelphia|Mount Airy, Pennsylvania]], now part of [[Philadelphia]], the fifth child of an Irish [[Protestant]] immigrant, James Gowen, a successful [[grocer]], and his wife, Mary (née Miller), who was of [[German American]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;Schlegel, Marvin Wilson, ''Ruler of the Reading: The Life of Franklin B. Gowen'', Harrisburg: Archives Publishing Company of Pennsylvania, 1947, pp 3–4; a comprehensive biography of Gowen, but its author notes that "the disappearance of Gowen's personal papers has left tantalizing gaps in his portrait", vii&lt;/ref&gt;

Although his formal education was ended by his father at age 13, when he apprenticed the youth to a [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]] merchant, as a young adult Gowen studied law with a local attorney in [[Pottsville, Pennsylvania]]. Following admission to the bar and joining the local Democratic party, he was elected [[District Attorney]] for [[Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania]] in 1862. He left that position in 1864 to pursue a private law practice that led him first to represent the Reading Railroad and a few years later to take on its presidency. Throughout his time with the railroad and afterward, Gowen continued practicing law and  trying cases — sometimes as a special prosecutor on behalf of the state of Pennsylvania. At the time of his death, he was pursuing a case before the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] on behalf of a private client against the [[Standard Oil]] [[Trust (19th century)|trust]]. In the course of these hearings, Gowen cross-examined [[John D. Rockefeller]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Family, education and early law practice==
James Gowen, described later in life as a "hot-tempered, domineering, old Irishman",&lt;sup&gt;[needs citation]&lt;/sup&gt; emigrated from Ireland in 1811. He was listed as a "wine merchant" in property records regarding his 1834 purchase of 500 S. 5th Street in Philadelphia for [[United States dollar|$]]3,000.  The property, which would become the Gowen household and store, consisted of a brick building with retail space on the ground floor and living quarters above it. He sold the property to Peter Woods for $4,500. in 1846.&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, Richard S., (June 19, 1963), ''[http://www.brynmawr.edu/iconog/uphp/t162227/web-content/TransferHistory.pdf 500 S. 5th Street, Chain of Title]'' ([[Portable Document Format|PDF]]). Retrieved March 5, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  James Gowen served as director, and later as comptroller, of Philadelphia's public schools; and also as a director of the [[Bank of Pennsylvania]]. He was an ardent Jeffersonian [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican]].{{sfnp|Schlegel|1947|p=2}}

Franklin Gowen was the fifth of ten children born to James Gowen and Mary Miller. Mary, 16 years James's junior, came from an early-immigrated German family: by tradition, her ancestors had been closely associated with [[Francis Daniel Pastorius]], founder of [[Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Germantown]] (now part of Philadelphia), the first permanent German settlement in Pennsylvania. {{sfnp|Schlegel|1947|p=3–4}}

Prior to Franklin's birth in 1836, the Gowens moved from central Philadelphia to take up their residence in Mary's family home (James had bought out the interests of other family members) in Mt. Airy, just north of Germantown.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Young Franklin attended [[John Beck's Boys Academy]], a boarding school in [[Lititz, Pennsylvania]], from the ages of nine to thirteen.  At that point, however, his formal schooling was curtailed.  Instead he was apprenticed to a Lancaster dry goods merchant/coal dealer named Thomas Baumgardner, who held an interest in an iron furnace at [[Shamokin, Pennsylvania]]. Baumgardner liked and came to trust Franklin so that at age 19, Gowen found himself dispatched as clerk (i.e., bookkeeper) for that iron business.{{sfnp|Schlegel|1947|p=6|ps=&amp;nbsp;Describes Gowen being sent to "manage" the iron furnace. An earlier source describes a document listing Gowen as "clerk", and also indicates the significance of Baumgardner's Shamokin interests. Bell, Herbert C., ed., ''History of Northumberland County, Pennsylvania, etc, etc.'', Chicago, Ill.: Brown, Runk &amp; Co., 1891, pp. 615–16, 800.}} It was during this Shamokin period that Gowen met and courted his future wife, Esther Brisben (sometimes spelled Brisbane) of [[Sunbury, Pennsylvania|Sunbury]].

After completing his apprenticeship, Gowen relocated to Pottsville, seat of Schuylkill County and the principal municipality in the southern portion of Pennsylvania's [[Coal Region|coal region]].  There he helped found the Pottsville Literary Society (at one of whose meetings he orated on "The Triumphs of Genius"), and entered into a partnership to operate a coal mine nearby. The mine failed (1859), leaving 23-year-old Gowen US$20,000 in debt.  But undaunted Franklin Gowen—married now—studied law in the office of Benjamin Cumming, a Pottsville attorney.  He was admitted to the bar in 1860.{{sfnp|Schlegel|1947|p=7-8}}

He established his own practice, at the same time becoming active in the local Democratic party. Gowen served as Schuylkill County's elected [[District Attorney]] (1862–64), though in that period, according to his generally sympathetic biographer, he was "doing too well with his private practice to have time to bother with prosecuting criminals."&lt;ref name=Schlegel10&gt;Schlegel, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;  Others{{who|date=February 2018}} argue that Gowen would have diligently prosecuted numerous cases but for his suspects uniformly being furnished with alibis by fellow criminals, some of whom he brought to justice two decades later as Mollie Maguires.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}  Whatever Gowen's personal attitude towards his official duties, the climate in Schuylkill County at the time was less than conducive to normal conduct of criminal investigations: First, at that time an elected county sheriff was the principal law enforcement officer.  Second, and much to the point during Gowen's tenure, in July 1863, roughly the midpoint of his D.A. service and of the Civil War, a national conscription act was passed to bolster Union forces. The eruption of anti-draft riots in [[New York Draft Riots|New York]] and other cities threatened to replicate in Schuylkill County as well. Threats and violence, including murder, occurred in several localities.  Federal troops were deployed to the county to face down these fierce anti-draft feelings and disruptions, and finally conscription was effected under military force.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Anthony F.C., ''St. Clair'' (1987), {{ISBN|0-394-52867-0}}, pp. 326–328.  For deeper analysis and discussion, see also Palladino, Grace, ''Another Civil War'' (1990), {{ISBN|0-252-01671-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When his own draft number came up that same year, Gowen—by then a father of three—was well-off enough to pay for a substitute, a common practice among those who could afford it.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

When Gowen left public office in 1864 in favor of his more lucrative private law practice, among his clients was the Reading Railroad.  His practice prospered, and he was finally able to satisfy the lingering judgments against him from the mine failure and to buy a fashionable home in Pottsville.{{sfnp|Schlegel|1947|p=10}}

In 1865, his two young sons—James and Franklin Benjamin, Jr.—died from illness, leaving his daughter Ellen an only child: she was to have no other brothers or sisters.  Also that spring Franklin's beloved younger brother, George, was killed in the final days of the Civil War.  Col. George Gowen, who had originally moved to Schuylkill County to assist in his brother's mining enterprise, was regarded in Pottsville as a local hero, and the [[Grand Army of the Republic|G.A.R.]] post and local militia company were given his name.{{sfnp|Schlegel|1947|p=10}}

Much legal activity in Pottsville at the time had to do with clearing disputed land titles on behalf of both individuals and companies hoping to reap profits from the increasing anthracite trade.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, Hoffman, John N., ''Girard Estate Coal Land in Pennsylvania 1801–1884'', Washington, D.C.:  Smithsonian Institution Press, 1972, p. 15; and Montgomery, Morton L., ''History of Berks County in Pennsylvania'', Philadelphia: Everts, Peck &amp; Richards, 1886, p. 456&lt;/ref&gt;  Beyond any work of this kind, Gowen was involved in representing the Reading against personal-injury negligence claims, some of which he argued successfully before the state Supreme Court, exonerating the Reading from liability.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Throughout his career, Franklin Gowen was renowned as an eloquent and persuasive speaker.  A number of his orations were published and sold in pamphlet form.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}  In an 1866 contract dispute—when Gowen was the Reading's local counsel in Pottsville—he won handily for the Reading, against its rival Pennsylvania Railroad, before the state Supreme Court, "bolster[ing] his points with legal citations, classical quotations, humorous stories, and even a toy train."&lt;ref name=Schlegel11&gt;Schlegel, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;  Other notable instances included his closing argument as prosecutor in the 1876 murder trial of John Kehoe, vilified at the time as the "King of the Mollie Maguires," in which he portrayed the murders and other crimes attributed to Mollies as being an evil unparalleled in all human history, and as not locally motivated, but driven by orders from other places—Pittsburgh, New York—even other lands—England, Ireland, Scotland;&lt;ref&gt;''Report of the case of the Commonwealth vs. John Kehoe et al. members of the Ancient Order of Hibernians, commonly known as "Molly Maguires," etc. etc.'', Pottsville [Pa.] : Miners' Journal Book and Job Rooms, 1876, pp. 184–186&lt;/ref&gt; and his three-hour argument in 1881 before a gathering of outraged stockholders of the bankrupt Reading Railroad, inside Philadelphia's [[Academy of Music (Philadelphia)|Academy of Music]], by which he turned open hostility into enthusiastic rounds of applause{{sfnp|Schlegel|1947|p=222-224}} Kehoe received the death penalty and was hung. He was later exonerated and posthumously pardoned by the State of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/portal/communities/documents/1865-1945/kehoe-death-warrant.html "Justice was done posthumously. Kehoe's great grandson refused to accept the verdict and worked tirelessly to have Kehoe's name cleared. In early January of l979, Governor Milton J. Shapp issued a full pardon to John J. Kehoe"&lt;/ref&gt; One twentieth-century commentator described Gowen's oratory skills thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Even in cold print..., his speeches tend to unsettle the judgment.{{sfnp|Bruce|1959|p=37}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By 1867, having impressed the Reading Railroad's management in Philadelphia with his legal exertions on their behalf, including the above-mentioned state Supreme Court victory over the Pennsylvania Railroad, he was invited to Philadelphia to head the corporation's legal department.{{sfnp|Schlegel|1947|p=11}}  Leaving Pottsville behind, Gowen sold his home to [[George DeBenneville Keim]], a fellow attorney and close personal friend, who was to figure significantly during Gowen's future presidency of the railroad.

==Running the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad==
===Assuming the presidency===
Once established in Philadelphia as chief counsel for the railroad, Gowen further gained the trust of the current president, [[Charles E. Smith (P&amp;R president)|Charles E. Smith]], so that when Smith took a needed ocean voyage for his health in mid-1869, 33-year-old Gowen was put in charge upon Smith's recommendation to the Board of Managers.  When Smith was unable to return for the next board election in January 1870, Gowen was elected president in his own right, a position he would occupy for more than a decade.

The Philadelphia and Reading Railroad was a regional carrier only, not a trunk line with its own through connections to Pittsburgh, Chicago and beyond, like the [[Pennsylvania Railroad|Pennsylvania]], the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|Baltimore and Ohio]] (B&amp;amp;O) or the [[Erie Railroad|Erie]] railroads.  Rather than a hauler of general freight and passengers, the Reading initially had been formed in the 1830s specifically for the purpose of hauling anthracite coal from Schuylkill County to Philadelphia and points between.

In the post-Civil War climate of Northern industrial growth and prosperity, the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad even prior to Gowen's presidency was involved in dual processes of consolidating control over sub-regional carriers that fed into it, by either acquisition or lease; and of building connections through other lines to Pittsburgh and beyond.  Gowen, as Pottsville counsel and especially as chief counsel of the Reading, was not only aware of, but very close to these endeavors—and secret purchases of Schuylkill County coal lands, in violation of the railroad's corporate charter.&lt;ref&gt;Buggy, Bernard E., "The History of the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Coal &amp; Iron Company", ''Publications of the Historical Society of Schuylkill County'', vol. IX, no. 1, Pottsville, Pennsylvania: Historical Society of Schuylkill County, 1989, pp. 54–57&lt;/ref&gt;

The core of the Reading's business, however, remained anthracite hauling, and as president Gowen sought to stabilize this core by obtaining control over both ends of the industry that the railroad connected: anthracite production and marketing.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===Controlling production: quelling labor disputes in the mines===
Gowen's drive to stabilize production began almost as soon as he became president, following a miners' strike action in the Schuylkill coal fields in 1869–70 that resulted in fluctuations of coal traffic on the Reading.  The two sides in the dispute were a loose coalition of mine operators, the Anthracite Board of Trade; and a young union, the [[Workingmen's Benevolent Association of Schuylkill County|Workingmen's Benevolent Association]] (WBA).  Both the miners and the operators were interested in manipulating the price of anthracite at market by controlling the amount produced; but they were in dispute over how fluctuations in real market prices should reflect back upon wages in the mines.  Franklin Gowen was asked by the Board of Trade to mediate.  This resulted in the "Gowen Compromise," a sliding-scale arrangement tying wages to the rise and fall of anthracite's market prices. This scheme was incorporated in July 1870 into the first written contract between miners and operators in the U.S.  Gowen was not a disinterested party in the original dispute, however, his real concerns being to stabilize revenues for the Reading and to do so by introducing his own manipulations of anthracite prices.

So in the next mining season, when workers and operators entered into fresh disputes over the 1870 contract, he organized a loose (for the time being) combination of anthracite haulers that uniformly hiked freight rates to prohibitive levels, thereby cutting mine operators' revenues so ultimately to force the miners into accepting wages that the combination wanted.

Feelings ran so high against this, that Gowen found himself having to mount a vigorous self-defense before state legislators against what was deemed unprecedented assumption of power by a corporation.  Gowen, both testifying and cross-examining other witnesses, defended himself by taking the offensive. He attacked the WBA generally, and its leader, John Siney, personally, as ignorant, demagogic, wrong-headed in their misunderstandings of the laws of supply and demand; as preventing men from working, forcing the poor to pay high prices for coal, and ruining the iron industry.{{sfnp|Schlegel|1947|p=27–29}}

It was in these same hearings that Gowen first began to formulate in public discourse his theory that the miners' union had at its core a murderous criminal association:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This organization first came into full fledged existence, in all the [coal] regions, in 1869.  They then formed the Workingmen's Benevolent association, extending throughout the entire coal fields of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;''Report of the Committee of the Judiciary, General'', p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I do not charge this Workingmen's Benevolent association with it, but I say there is an association which votes in secret, at night, that men's lives shall be taken, and that they shall be shot before their wives, murdered in cold blood, for daring to work against the order....  ''I do not blame this association'', but I blame another association for doing it; and it happens that the only men who are shot are the men who dare to disobey the mandates of the Workingmen's Benevolent association.&lt;ref&gt;''Report of the Committee of the Judiciary, General'', p. 19, emphasis in original&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This idea, already formed in his mind well before any pointed investigation of such a spectral secret society, Gowen was to expand and propound later in the decade into the image of an international conspiracy as the ultimate target behind the prosecution of coal-region Mollie Maguires.

===Controlling production: the Philadelphia &amp;amp; Reading Coal &amp;amp; Iron Company===
Unlike later-formed anthracite-hauling railroads tied to other portions of the coal region, such as the [[Lehigh Valley Railroad|Lehigh Valley]] and the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad|Delaware, Lackawanna &amp;amp; Western]], whose corporate charters allowed them to also be involved in mining operations, the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad's charter prohibited it.

At this time in the U.S., the granting, regulation, and rescission of corporate charters were managed by the legislative rather than executive branch in most states.  So adding to the allowed pursuits of the Reading by amending its charter was not a matter of simply a board decision and filing of papers.  This legal obstacle to increasing the Reading's control over coal production Gowen sneaked around in 1871 by eking out, through political allies, the Pennsylvania legislature's chartering a new corporation, the [[Laurel Run Improvement Company]], whose vaguely set-out purpose was to be involved in coal and iron, and whose shares could be purchased by "any railroad or mining company".&lt;ref name=Schlegel82&gt;Schlegel, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; This new company was quickly bought outright by the Reading as a subsidiary and renamed the [[Reading Anthracite Company|Philadelphia &amp;amp; Reading Coal &amp;amp; Iron Company]] (the Coal &amp; Iron Co). In the meantime, Gowen obtained passage through the legislature of another bill permitting the Reading Railroad to borrow an unlimited amount of money. Gowen quickly arranged for a US$25 million bond issue and sent agents to buy up Schuylkill County coal land for the Coal &amp; Iron Co.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

During the period from 1871–74, Gowen's Philadelphia and Reading Railroad continued to borrow at the rate of US$16 million per year to buy up and develop Schuylkill County coal lands, including numerous existing mining operations. In a number of cases, loans were extended to foundering mine operators to keep them afloat, and Reading money was also put up to build iron furnaces along its rail lines.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

====Twin Shaft Colliery====
In collaboration with his close friend, George deBenneville Keim—who had bought Gowen's Pottsville home in 1864, and was subsequently appointed first president of the Coal &amp; Iron Co.—Gowen's perhaps most crucial business bet was made upon these lands:  development of the Pottsville Twin Shaft Colliery.  This enterprise was based on a theory of mining the Schuylkill Basin coal field promoted by [[Eli Bowen]] in his 1862 book, ''Coal, and the Coal Trade'', where he called for "large capital" to sink two "enormously deep and permanent shafts" to a depth of two thousand feet "before a single pound of coal is allowed to be sent to market."  "[W]ith night and day shifts," Bowen estimated, the shafts "could be sunk down within two or three years."  Shafts once sunk, the "mining would be carried on night and day, with three eight-hour shifts."  "[A]fterwards you can work it like a machine."&lt;ref&gt;Bowen, Eli, ''Coal, and the Coal Trade'', Philadelphia: T.B. Peterson &amp; Bros.; and Pottsville, Penna.: B. Bannan, 1862, pp. 31, 34, 32.  See also Wallace, 430–432.&lt;/ref&gt;  The object of these deep diggings was to reach the famous [[Mammoth Vein]], an undulating seam of high-quality anthracite twenty-five feet thick, projected as providing a virtually inexhaustible supply.  This indeed was the shared vision and plan of Gowen and Keim from the outset of the Coal &amp; Iron Co.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, pp. 430–431&lt;/ref&gt;

Three years into the project, however, the Mammoth Vein was estimated as still {{convert|800|ft|m}} deeper than digging had reached.  Even after the colliery became operative in 1875, its production never reached even 1/10 of its projected output 750,000 tons per year.  In total, the mine operated only ten years, with a ''cumulative'' output of 275,871 tons.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, p. 435&lt;/ref&gt;

====Financing the Coal &amp;amp; Iron Co.====
The aggressively expansive operations of the Coal &amp; Iron Co., including the Twin Shaft project, required vast outlays of money, and the coal and iron operations were not returning a profit on those outlays.  Rather, the source of Coal &amp; Iron Co. funding was an increasing load of debt owed by the parent railroad:  increased by US$65 million during the first five years of Gowen's presidency—almost twice the railroad's valuation when he took the helm in 1869.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Annual interest on this debt, about US$4 million, was a little less than the average profit of the railroad during those years. The public face of the Reading's finances—prospectuses and annual reports—obscured these realities.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

In 1874, Franklin B. Gowen came under attack again, this time charged before stockholders of accounting sleight of hand—of cloaking continuous losses in the Coal &amp; Iron Co. by infusing into that subsidiary as "capital investment" funds borrowed by the parent railroad, only to mysteriously shuffle large portions of that "investment" back to the parent to cover high dividends paid to railroad shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;Schlegel, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;  In light of those consistent high dividends, though, these accusations were sloughed off, and there was no shareholder revolt to derail him.

===Controlling the anthracite markets===
The specific destination of coal bound to Philadelphia was that city's [[Port Richmond, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Port Richmond]] area along the Delaware River.  In this complex of rail yards and wharves, coal was unloaded for local marketing or for transshipment by boat to other markets such as New York and Boston.  In the late 1840s and early 1850s, one of Gowen's predecessors as president of the Philadelphia &amp; Reading, John Tucker, undertook to bolster the railroad's presence and control in Port Richmond with the aim of achieving unquestioned leadership of the coal trade on the Delaware.  The Reading's Port Richmond facilities in 1852 were estimated to comprise {{convert|49|acre|m2}}, including 20 wharves that would allow more than 100 vessels to be loaded simultaneously, and space for storage in slack times of a quarter million tons of coal.&lt;ref&gt;Holton, James L., ''The Reading Railroad: History of a Coal Age Empire'', vol. 1; {{ISBN|0-9620844-1-7}}, pp. 129, 131&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin Gowen endeavored to improve upon the benefits to the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad of this shipping terminus / transshipping hub.  In 1871–72, he undertook to undermine business of the competing independent coal dealers in the area—known as "factors"—by setting up a new sales organization under the auspices of the Coal &amp; Iron Co.  Gowen's aim was not only to market the Reading organization's coal, but that of other mine operators whose output the railroad hauled, as well.

Depicting the factors, who sold typically at commissions of 20 to 25 cents a ton, as sitting "at the water's edge like leeches, sucking the life-blood of a healthy trade," he offered to operators who previously marketed through the factors to sell their coal at only 10 cents per ton.&lt;ref&gt;Schlegel, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; A number of operators found the proposal immediately agreeable. But Gowen's next move was not as well received: he offered to consolidate under the Coal &amp; Iron Co. the sales businesses of fifteen factors who also owned their own mining operations.  This proposal rebuffed, Gowen moved to shut down the businesses of independent factors (who did not have their own mines) by denying them continued wharf room at Port Richmond.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The public controversies stirred up by all these actions lasted into 1873.  Rising above it all, in January of that year Gowen presided over formation of the "coal pool" or "anthracite combination"—including other big coal executives [[Asa Packer]], Thomas Dickson, George Hoyt, and Samuel Sloan—which established "the first industry-wide price-fixing agreement in America."&lt;ref&gt;Schlegel, p.44&lt;/ref&gt;  It both set the sales price for coal and allotted the tonnage each member railroad was allowed to haul to market for the coming year.

This anthracite combination fared well, even with the onset of a national depression following the [[Panic of 1873]]. In anticipation of lagging demand for coal in 1874, a long, formal agreement was put in place to enforce regulation of the trade more effectively. Some coal operators remained outside the coal pool, and for these the Reading Railroad devised a new annoyance: continuing to load coal cars with Coal &amp; Iron Co. anthracite even beyond the Reading's allotted tonnage, then lining these loaded cars on side tracks, thus limiting the availability of empty cars for hauling the other mine operators' output.  The result was haphazard disruption of production and sales for these operators.

Once again, in 1875, Franklin Gowen was called before an investigative committee, for issues raised by his role and actions in another miners' strike (the "Long Strike"—see below), and more substantially for his high-handed maneuverings in the coal trade. Even the legality of the 1871 charter of the Laurel Run Improvement Company and the Reading Railroad's transformation of that shell into the powerful Coal &amp; Iron Co. were assailed. The investigating legislators' final report was fully in Gowen's favor. Also as in other instances, Gowen's orations were broadcast in pamphlet form and in newspaper advertisements.&lt;ref name=Schlegel82/&gt;

==="Long Strike" and Mollie Maguires===
The "Gowen Compromise" of 1870 did not end strife over wages and other conditions in the coal region. Neither did the imposition of wages through the anthracite combination's exerting control over coal prices at market.  Neither, to be certain, were mining disputes the beginning or end of labor upheavals in America in the 1870s.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

As noted above, in the 1871 legislative investigation of coal field agitations and the Reading, Gowen portrayed the WBA as having at its core a murderous, secret association. In his 1875 testimony before another investigative committee, he characterized this same core of the union as "Communists."&lt;ref&gt;Schlegel, p. 84.&lt;br&gt;See Wikipedia articles on the [[Paris Commune]] and [[International Workingmen's Association]] to better understand the contemporary connotations of this charge.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1873, the failure of Jay Cooke &amp; Co. precipitated first the Panic of 1873 and in its wake the worst U.S. financial depression up to that time, which resonated with the concurrent transatlantic [[Long Depression]]. Initially, northeastern U.S. anthracite markets were not badly affected, largely due to controls put in place by Gowen's coal pool. In 1874, in addition to shoring up this coal pool's internal checks to make sure all members played by the rules, Gowen also organized Schuylkill County's independent coal operators into the Schuylkill Coal Exchange. By autumn 1874 it was common knowledge that these operators (including the Coal &amp; Iron Co.) were intent upon precipitating a ruinous miners' strike by which to destroy the WBA (by this time renamed the Miners and Laborers Benevolent Association, or M&amp;amp;LBA).&lt;ref&gt;Schlegel, pp. 63–65.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a strike was indeed brought about by severe slashes in wages offered to miners (20% cut) and mine laborers (10% cut). Known as the "Long Strike", the work stoppage lasted through June 1875, ending in the collapse of the union.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

In October 1873, Gowen met in Philadelphia with [[Allan Pinkerton]].  Pinkerton's published account of the meeting depicts Gowen laying out in some detail the existence, background and nature of a criminal secret society called Mollie Maguires, transplanted from Ireland to the coal region of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;Schlegel, pp. 87–88, citing Allan Pinkerton, ''The Molly Maguires and the Detectives'' (New York, 1877), pp. 13–15&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:James McParland.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[James McParland]] who infiltrated the [[Molly Maguires]] for the [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton Agency]].]]Pinkerton's [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|detective agency]] was already an established presence in the coal fields, having been active supervising the [[Coal and Iron Police]], a private police force authorized by the state of Pennsylvania in 1865, paid for by railroad, mining and iron interests.  Pinkerton was glad to take on additional work for the Reading Railroad.
One of his detectives, [[James McParland]], infiltrated what he testified was the Mollies' innermost circle and provided, as a surprise witness, what proved to be damning evidence in several murder trials.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

A series of murders July and September 1875, following the breakdown of the WBA and its Long Strike, led to several arrests over the next year of men identified as Mollie Maguires. Arrests, trials, convictions and hangings of Mollie Maguires occurred in the adjoining counties of Schuylkill and Carbon, in 1876-78. Catholics were excluded from juries. Gowen himself acted as special prosecutor in more than one trial in Schuylkill, most notably in 1876 at that of [[Girardville, Pennsylvania#Notable people|John "Black Jack" Kehoe]], whom he characterized in his summation as "chief conspirator, murderer, and villain" and "with having made money by his traffic in the souls of his fellow-men". In this same summation he speculated that had detective McParland had one more year to complete his undercover investigation, the jury "would have had the pleasure ... of hanging some men who are not citizens of Schuylkill county," such as "the head of this order at Pittsburg, and ... its head in New York"; and suggested further that the ultimate source and directive force behind the secret order would have been found in England, Ireland and Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;''Report of the Case of the Commonwealth vs. John Kehoe, et al.'', Pottsville, 1876, pp. 184, 186&lt;/ref&gt;

Kehoe was initially tried and convicted of conspiracy, and subsequently of a murder that had occurred during Gowen's term as District Attorney—despite another man's signed admission of guilt for the murder. Kehoe was posthumously pardoned by Pennsylvania Governor [[Milton Shapp]] in 1979.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Controversial at the time, circumstances and events surrounding both the Long Strike and the Mollie Maguire prosecutions and hangings have grown even more so with the passage of time.  Gowen's multi-faceted role in particular—from his 1871 and 1875 testimonies positing a Mollie-like criminal enterprise at the heart of the WBA, which he also rhetorically linked to Communism; to the coincidental timing of the hopeless Long Strike precipitated by the Schuylkill Coal Exchange that Gowen had organized, on one hand, and his bankrolling the undercover anti-Mollie machinations, on the other; plus partially substantiated claims that McParland or other Pinkertons essentially on the Reading Railroad payroll instigated both Mollie-like activities and anti-Mollie vigilantism&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, Miller, Donald L., and Richard E. Sharpless, ''The Kingdom of Coal:  Work, Enterprise and Ethnic Communities in the Mine Fields'', 1985; and Campbell, Patrick, ''A Molly Maguire Story'', 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;—has eluded historical consensus.

===Wiggans Patch Massacre===
On December 10, 1875, 20 year old pregnant Ellen O'Donnell McAllister was awakened by a strange noise at 3 a.m. She woke up her husband telling him of the noise. At this time, around 20 masked men kicked in the door and started firing in the house. As Ellen walked down the steps, she was shot at point blank range. She and her unborn baby were murdered, along with her brother, Charles O'Donell. The matriarch of the house, Margaret O'Donnell, was pistol whipped by the assailants and they roughed up the boarders Mrs. O'Donnell kept. Ellen's husband, Charles McAllister, managed to escape, as did James O'Donnell, another O'Donnell sibling, and James McAllister, brother of Ellen's husband, Charles. It was said the attack occurred because the O'Donnell family were suspected members of the Molly Maguires. Ellen's body and that of her brother were taken to [[Tamaqua, Pennsylvania|Tamaqua]] by train. Upon arrival, the corpses were packed in ice and stored overnight in the train station to await burial at old St. Jerome's Cemetery. Ellen's sister, Mary Ann, was married to the John "Black Jack" Kehoe, who history dubbed "The King of the Molly Maguires".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Murders remain unsolved 140 years later|url=http://www.tnonline.com/2015/oct/30/murders-remain-unsolved-140-years-later|website=tnonline.com|accessdate=2016-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, documents and communications have emerged between Franklin Gowen, Allan Pinkerton, and the captain of the Coal and Iron Police, Captain Linden, which strongly suggest that this tragic event was not only premeditated but executed with precision.  Furthermore, documents show that funding for the massacre was paid for by coal and railroad money and some sources say that billionaire Asa Packer may have fronted a good portion of the financial backing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Franklin Gowen|url=http://wigganspatch.webs.com/franklingowen.htm|website=wigganspatch.webs.com|accessdate=2016-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Great Strike of 1877===
During Franklin Gowen's presidency, the Reading Railroad was one of the richest corporations in the world—running not only trains, but an empire of coal mines, of canals and oceangoing vessels; and even trying (unsuccessfully) a subsidiary rail venture in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;Holton, pp. 202–203&lt;/ref&gt; Though its corporate management resided in Philadelphia, the motive power propelling the railroad emanated from Reading, roughly {{convert|60|mi|km}} northwest of the larger city, where a {{convert|36|acre|m2|adj=on}} engineering/production shop complex sat adjacent to the downtown. Disputes between the Reading and laborers embroiled not only miners in the Coal &amp; Iron division, but engineers and other workers in the Railroad division as well. Both the Reading Railroad and its namesake city were fertile grounds for early unionization. In particular, the city of Reading was throughout the 1870s home to a very motivated local of the [[Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers]] (the BLE). Gowen's crushing of the WBA, coupled with his widely hailed unraveling of the Mollie Maguires, heartened railroad capitalists nationwide. His triumphs refreshed their confidence that unionism could be squashed altogether. This impression of Gowen's prowess against unions was reinforced by his moves to quell a BLE strike in Reading in April 1877. Having learned from spies of a strike about to happen, Gowen issued an ultimatum: leave the union, or be fired. Nearly 80 per cent of the railroad's engineers walked off the job. Bosses and other non-union employees were pressed into service to run the trains until "temporary" replacements (i.e., [[strikebreaker]]s) could be hired on. The ''New York Times'' hailed the destruction of the "dictatorial" BLE and encouraged "employers generally" to imitate Gowen's anti-union stance.&lt;ref name="Bruce"&gt;Bruce, Robert V., ''1877: Year of Violence'', 1959. [Reprinted 1989]; {{ISBN|0-929587-05-7}}, pp. 40–42&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the spring of 1877, heads of the four major U.S. trunk lines — the B&amp;amp;O, the New York Central, the Erie and the Pennsylvania — held meetings to determine how, by working together, they could all "earn more and … spend less". The initial fruits of these meetings was a freight pooling arrangement along lines similar to Gowen's anthracite combination, to increase revenues by reducing competition. They also determined that, after Gowen's defeating the BLE, a reduction in rail workers' wages was timely.&lt;ref name="Bruce"/&gt; The Pennsylvania was the first of the four to act, announcing an across-the-board wage cut of 10 per cent, effective June 1, 1877. Cuts on other roads — not just the four trunk lines — followed, affecting rail workers nationwide. The B&amp;amp;O's 10 per cent cut precipitated, in July 1877, a work stoppage in [[Martinsburg, West Virginia]], which multiplied with telegraphic speed into the [[Great Railroad Strike of 1877]]. The Great Strike flashed from coast to coast; workers on railroad after railroad, in city after city, struck as well, forcing a halt to all rail activity in or through numerous locales, and in some places triggering general non-railroad work stoppages. Interstate commerce was paralyzed for weeks. As the Strike spread, destructive and deadly violence erupted in some major cities — Baltimore; Pittsburgh, Reading and Scranton, Pennsylvania; Buffalo, Chicago, and San Francisco. Almost immediately upon his return from Europe, on the very day the Great Strike broke out, Gowen instituted massive layoffs of brakemen across the railroad, in effect both sanctioning and reinforcing the other railroads' moves while he was gone. In Reading, back in April and May, striking BLE engineers had been quickly displaced by strikebreakers and then blacklisted—but the strikebreakers, as well as other workers, were not paid by the cash-strapped Reading Railroad from May through mid-July. While the Great Strike gathered momentum, Gowen found the money to pay back wages in Reading. Local outrage at Gowen and the Reading was intensified as newly laid-off brakemen swelled the ranks of unemployed railroad men and strikebreakers saw their wages as a transparent effort to buy loyalty. {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Ultimately, within a month of the first Mollie Maguire hangings (June 20, 1877), the ongoing BLE strike in Reading, which Gowen believed he had broken just as he had the WBA strike in 1875, gained fresh momentum from the unfolding Great Strike; tensions in the city escalated until, on July 23, 10 citizens were killed by the Pennsylvania state militia in the [[Reading Railroad Massacre]]. Federal troops were dispatched to Reading to restore order. Following the Massacre, in October 1877 Gowen personally prosecuted men whom Pinkerton spies had pinpointed as the local BLE ringleaders, but they were acquitted. {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

[[File:Uriah-stephens-circa-1900.gif|thumb|right|180px|Uriah S. Stephens, founder of the Knights of Labor]]
Three months later, in January 1878, Reading was the site of the first national convention of the [[Knights of Labor]], which grew into one of the important U.S. labor organizations of the nineteenth century. As with many early labor organizations, its membership rolls and meetings were secret, to help avoid infiltration and blacklisting. The Knights creed and organization crossed occupational lines, attempting to become a sort of "union of unions." As such, after the collapse of the WBA/M&amp;amp;LBA, miners in the anthracite region formed locals of the Knights of Labor. In one incident, when Coal &amp; Iron Co. workers struck for back pay, Gowen once again raised the issue of terrorism.  Seeking to avert the spread of the strike, he sent an open letter to the ''Miner's Journal'' newspaper in Pottsville exposing the names of the officers and membership of the Knights assemblies.  He also implied that there was a "gang" within the union, similar to the Mollies, whose task was to sabotage coal company property. The Knights fought back by challenging the Schuylkill County authorities to arrest the alleged terrorists, but as Gowen's charges were unsubstantiated, the matter went no further.&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Sharpless, p. 215, citing Harold Aurand, ''From the Molly Maguires to the United Mine Workers'', pp. 115–116&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bankruptcies and ouster from the Reading===

====Reading Railroad's first bankruptcy====
The United States was roiled repeatedly throughout the nineteenth century by financial panics  
and resultant economic recessions, each with transatlantic dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;See Wikipedia  
articles: [[Panic of 1819]], [[Panic of 1825]], [[Panic of 1837]], [[Panic of 1847]], [[Panic of 
1873]], [[Panic of 1884]], [[Panic of 1890]], [[Panic of 1893]].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Panic of 1837]] was pivotal for the Reading Railroad. After the road's optimistic startup on a foundation of American capital in 1834, because it was "constructed without financial stint... the income from the company's operations had to be maintained at an unusually high level just to stay in the black."&lt;ref&gt;Holton, pp. 120–121&lt;/ref&gt; During the American economic  
contraction following the 1837 panic, management turned in desperation to London for fresh capital and credit. The resulting influx of badly needed cash made the Reading the first American railroad to come under direct English influence as to its management.&lt;ref&gt;Adler,  
Dorothy R., ''British Investment in American Railways, 1834–1898'', 1970, {{ISBN|0-8139-0311-4}}, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; From well prior to Gowen's presidency, and continuing through it until the Reading Railroad came fully under J.P. Morgan's sway, these London interests exerted great influence.

The Reading better weathered the panics of 1847 and 1857, but under Franklin Gowen's management and expansionist programs, the Panic of 1873 and its follow-on depression were once again of instrumental importance. The railroad fell deeper and deeper into debt until, finally, in May 1880, the well was dry: the Reading had gone bankrupt.

Despite the harsh realities of the depression that ran from late 1873 into 1879, it was significant misjudgments on Gowen's part that led to the Reading Railroad's collapse in 1880.
His determination to dominate, through the Reading Railroad, the overall supply/demand dynamic of anthracite was hemmed in by insurmountable bounds from the outset.

The mining theory behind the ultimately wasteful development of the Pottsville Twin Shaft operation was not well grounded in the geologic science even of that time. But that theory alone did not make up Gowen's rationale for the massive expenditures of the Coal &amp; Iron Co. He believed that the Schuylkill Valley—which from colonial times until the Civil War had been the center of American iron-making—would, because of the importance of [[anthracite iron]], continue to hold that preeminent position indefinitely. He stated this belief forthrightly in the Reading Railroad annual report for 1870;&lt;ref&gt;Schlegel, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; but already the use of lower-cost [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] made from more widely available [[bituminous coal]], together with expanding markets in the Midwest and West, was driving the center of the iron industry (and soon, steelmaking) to Pittsburgh. Already the importance of anthracite as an indispensable industrial fuel was slipping.

Even Gowen's anthracite combination, successful at maintaining profitable market prices even as depression set in, was not able to continue long in unity. Internecine squabbles and continued deteriorating business conditions all around undermined the effectiveness of this pooling effort, and coal prices and revenues fluctuated year by year. The combination unraveled in August 1876, with Gowen angrily denouncing erstwhile coal pool member Asa Packer by name. Meanwhile, earlier in the year the Coal &amp; Iron Company's retail marketing operation at Port Richmond was transferred to an independent concern.&lt;ref&gt;Schlegel, pp. 153–155&lt;/ref&gt; As the Philadelphia coal market continued to decline, Schuylkill County mine operators sent Thomas Baumgardner, who had given Franklin Gowen his first introduction to the coal and iron businesses during his apprenticeship, as part of a committee to get a read on Gowen's intentions. Still out of sorts over the larger anthracite combination's falling apart, Gowen would not commit to any new price-fixing arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;Schlegel, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, Gowen did not well discern the special nature of the Reading, as compared to other railroads of the time, in terms of its underlying capitalization. As noted above, the road was "constructed without financial stint"; specifically, it was laid out at a cost per mile that far exceeded that of other lines in the coal region, or even of such trunk lines as the B&amp;amp;O and Erie.&lt;ref&gt;Holton, p. 16, gives a figure of $180,000/mile; Dagget give $193,417/mile for the Reading (p. 75), $41,237 for the B&amp;amp;O (p. 1), and $43,961 for the Erie (p. 34); and Childs, C.G., ed., ''Pennsylvania the Pioneer in Internal Improvements'', Philadelphia, 1847, indicates Schuylkill and Lehigh coal region carriers, exclusive of the Reading, as ranging from $6,667 to $67,500/mile, but puts the Reading at $118,280/mile. Even allowing for differences in reporting periods for these figures, those for the Reading Railroad are consistently eye-popping.&lt;/ref&gt; Carrying costs for this capitalization was the issue that first drove the Reading into the arms of English lenders and investors. Somewhat a relief on both sides of the Atlantic, then, was the period 1861–1867, when the railroad managed to cut its funded debt roughly in half—from $11,819,400 to $5,902,300.&lt;ref&gt;Poor, Henry V., ''Manual of the Railroads of the United States, for 1868-69'', New York, 1868, pp. 258–264&lt;/ref&gt;

This was the fiscally sound, but still burdened, Reading Railroad whose presidency Gowen assumed in 1869. Instead of gleaning insight from the railroad's successful struggle to bring its overhead under control, he turned the enterprise in the following decade into a mysteriously accounted borrowing machine. In 1874, a former Gowen friend turned enemy by Gowen's organization of the anthracite industry, accused Gowen in print of dishonest and misleading financial representations in the Reading's annual report and its prospectuses.&lt;ref&gt;Schlegel, p. 56, citing Borda, Eugene, ''A Few Remarks on the Last Report of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company'', Philadelphia, 1874&lt;/ref&gt; Though Gowen was able to easily slough off such accusation at that time, it was renewed more powerfully in 1876 by Charles E. Smith—Gowen's direct predecessor as president, who had recommended the young man for the position in his absence. Even following Gowen's election to the post in his own right, Smith had remained on the corporation's Board of Managers. After hearing from Gowen of a US$7 million [[Floating charge|floating debt]] that had never been discussed in any board meetings, Smith inspected the unpublished books of the subsidiary Coal &amp; Iron Co., which issued no annual report of its own. He found that the parent corporation's floating debt was being transferred to the subsidiary before the parent's fiscal year end in November, to avoid appearing in year-end statements; only to be shifted back to the parent prior to the subsidiary's own fiscal year end in December, thus effectively masking the joint enterprise's precarious condition overall. Smith raised the issue to the Reading's principal source of funds, the [[McCalmont Brothers]] investment banking firm in London, seeking Gowen's ouster, but was rebuffed. Though Gowen remained as president, and Smith resigned from the board, the incident forced Gowen's 1876 annual report to approximate frankness. It indicated the corporation's funded debt as US$65 million, resulting in US$5.5 million annually in carrying charges, compared to just over US$3 million in earnings for the railroad and a US$600,000 loss for the Coal &amp; Iron Co.&lt;ref&gt;Schlegel, pp. 186–189&lt;/ref&gt;

From that time, through fresh sanguine predictions for improvements in the business climate and the Reading's overall performance, which allowed him to borrow more funds on a less grand scale and to get the McCalmonts to defer interest payments due; and maneuverings such as periodically paying workers in scrip—essentially promissory notes—instead of cash, Franklin Gowen continued to run the Reading. In early 1880, employees were paid in cash for the first time in sixteen months.&lt;ref&gt;Holton, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; Then, on Friday, May 22, 1880, two Coal &amp; Iron Co. checks, intended to transfer cash to the railroad, bounced. Gowen offered railroad promissory notes to make the checks good, but the bank turned him down. McCalmont Brothers ignored Gowen's plea by cable for a fresh loan of a half million dollars.&lt;ref&gt;Schlegel, p. 199; Holton, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; That same day the Reading announced suspension of payments on debt.

Reading Railroad stock dropped from 23 to 12½ in one hour of trading. An anonymous statement from the corporate offices predicted resumption of payments in thirty days, without bankruptcy. Ex-president Smith, however, predicted that the company had "no future but bankruptcy, and it must get rid of Mr. Gowen, or bankruptcy won't help it. Should he be made [[Administrative receivership|receiver]], it will be the same old story."&lt;ref&gt;Schlegel, pp. 199–200&lt;/ref&gt;

The following Monday, a formal declaration of bankruptcy was filed at the U.S. Circuit Court in Pittsburgh. Franklin Gowen was appointed as one of three receivers; the others were Philadelphia bankers with no personal ties to the corporation.

====Contentious recovery, new expansionism====
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2014}}
Though Gowen's powers as president were eclipsed by the appointment of receivers, his position as the one receiver who had close knowledge of the overall operations of the combined rail and coal businesses placed him in the middle of revitalization efforts. However, his hitherto support from the McCalmont Brothers banking concern was about to unravel through a series of discords into downright enmity. The McCalmonts owned at the time two-thirds of the Reading's stock and half of its bonds, and they formed their own committee to look after the interests of (especially British) bondholders.&lt;ref&gt;Holton, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; Initially this committee, chaired by a former [[Lord Chancellor]], approved with reservations Gowen's inclusion as a receiver on the bases that "[t]he proprietors of the bonds and stocks of the company in America have evinced their satisfaction with the choice of receivers," and that his "action... as receiver will be controlled by his colleagues and by the court."&lt;ref&gt;Schlegel, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;

Before any concrete planning to regain solvency could be undertaken, an accurate accounting of the railroad's condition was required. The receivers' report, issued in June 1880, indicated total liabilities of US$145,494,005. Annual carrying charges were just over US$7.5 million, while net revenues were just under US$5.5 million. Already, this early into the process, the English bondholders' committee contended that expansions in the Reading's floating debt incurred during the six months prior to the bankruptcy were not covered by value in the corporation's assets.{{sfnp|Daggett|1908|p=81–82}}

Three plans of reorganization were put forth before the end of 1880. The first came from the McCalmont faction; the second from a former vice president of the Reading; and the third from Franklin Gowen. The McCalmont plan would have given preferred protection to senior mortgage bond holders and also would have put a levy upon stockholders, US$15 per share, towards substantially paying down floating debt. The second plan did away with the levy—heavily objected to by American shareholders—but was contingent for success upon the Reading's preferred stock being worth roughly four times its current trading value.{{sfnp|Daggett|1908|p=84}} The third plan was put forth by Franklin Gowen in the context of known contemplation by the English bondholders of exercising their right of foreclosure against the Reading. Gowen's plan called for receivership to last for five years, for which time he projected increasingly improved business performance, reduction of fixed expenses to a manageable level, and liquidation of floating debt by the selling off of assets and/or conversion into preferred stock. This plan, as put forth to the McCalmonts, was accompanied by Gowen's offer to step aside as receiver. The English faction agreed to a plan very close to Gowen's, but with the stipulation that Gowen should indeed be replaced as receiver by someone not involved in the corporation's management prior to the bankruptcy. Gowen backpedaled vigorously. {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

He still held the positions of receiver and president, and had the confidence generally of the corporate board and of many American investors. In late 1880 Gowen traveled to England to attempt repairing relations there, and at the same time sought to postpone the annual shareholder meeting, with its election of president and board, from its regular January schedule. Through cross litigation by the Reading board and the McCalmonts the postponement was realized, and then Gowen began a campaign to get American shareholders to not attend the meeting. His argument to them was that the Reading was in danger of undermining influences from rival railroads but his hope was that the postponement would change the voting rules, and the absence of his allied shareholders would prevent a qualified quorum from being present. When the meeting was finally held in March 1881, however, and the McCalmont-dominated voting resulted in election of a different president and board from Gowen and his associates, Gowen resorted to new litigation. State and federal courts ruled against him, though, and he grudgingly gave access to the corporate offices to his temporary successor, Frank S. Bond — although in surrendering the physical office, Gowen retained possession of the company records. It was at this point that Gowen hired the Philadelphia Academy of Music for the purpose of addressing stockholders, as well as Philadelphia's political and business leaders. His three-hour oration not only excoriated the McCalmont Brothers' "cowardly meanness", but accused them and their American agents, [[Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.|Kidder, Peabody]], of working in league with the Pennsylvania Railroad in order to attempt moving the Reading into the sphere of control of that much larger corporation. This oration was interrupted frequently by applause, but did not affect Gowen's removal from the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Holton, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

No longer president, Gowen was still a receiver, and from that position he continued to lobby for his reorganization plan to stockholders, to the McCalmonts, and even to the new president. President Bond, however, was lobbying for his own new plan of reorganization, and things remained at somewhat of a standstill in that regard. On another front, however, Gowen was maneuvering to regain the presidency, and toward that end he forged a pivotal alliance with [[William Henry Vanderbilt|William Vanderbilt]], president of the [[New York Central Railroad|New York Central]] and other railroads. Vanderbilt bought up a large block of Reading Railroad stock, sufficient to reelect Gowen as president in January 1882. The same annual meeting saw resolutions passed approving Gowen's reorganization plan and requiring the incoming board of managers to put that plan into effect.

In response to this turn of events, McCalmont Brothers liquidated its holdings in the Reading and withdrew from ongoing litigation. The forty-year predominance of English capital in the finances and affairs of the Reading Railroad was thus ended; but in exchange the company's future became a fresh, inviting target for opportunistic American capital. In 1881 and 1882 the Coal &amp; Iron Co. continued to register losses, but the railroad actually saw upturns in its passenger, coal and merchandise freight business lines. Austerity measures implemented early in the bankruptcy at the railroad's car production and repair shops in Reading now found these operations taxed to their limits. Rather than rehabilitate these units, though, Gowen put money into building diverse new stations as well as a million-bushel grain elevator at Port Richmond. He also moved to expand the Reading Railroad's scope by having it lease the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]] (the Jersey Central). Vanderbilt supported the move as it would increase the value of his own railroad's interconnection at New York Harbor. Ominously, the Jersey Central was at the time in receivership, and the deal included assumption by Gowen's Reading of the Jersey Central's US$2 million of floating debt and guaranteeing a 6% dividend on all of the Central's stock then outstanding.&lt;ref&gt;Holton, p. 226; Daggett, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

Next, Gowen and Vanderbilt hit upon a plan to turn the Reading into a trunk line by building new extensions: two from [[Williamsport, Pennsylvania|Williamsport]]: one to Buffalo and one to northwestern Pennsylvania's soft coal region in Clearfield County; a third, in collaboration with the B&amp;amp;O, that would form a direct line from Washington, DC through Philadelphia to New York; and most ambitiously a fourth — the so-called [[South Pennsylvania Railroad|South Penn line]] — that would extend the Reading's western reach from [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] to Pittsburgh. They formed a syndicate including steelmakers [[Andrew Carnegie]], Henry Oliver, [[Henry Clay Frick]], Pennsylvania career politician [[J. Donald Cameron]], and—paradoxically, given Gowen's longstanding litigious hostility to Standard Oil — John D. and [[William Rockefeller]].  
Operating in the atmosphere of improved business conditions generally, the Reading Railroad emerged from receivership in February 1883.

That year witnessed continued improvement in the Reading's rail businesses, and in his annual report at the end of the year, Gowen made glowing predictions of prosperity for the road overall, including its new expansionist endeavors. "The company has now surmounted the difficulties of the last four eventful years", Gowen proclaimed; but that was not an accurate assessment of all the facts.  Nevertheless, President Gowen seized the moment of high praise from American shareholders for "rescuing our property from bankruptcy against the malignant and determined efforts of its enemies and conspirators to foreclose and wreck it", to remove himself from the official duties and pressures of president.{{sfnp|Daggett|1908|p=99}} At the January 1884 annual meeting he resigned in favor of his recommended successor, George deBenneville Keim, his close friend and associate since their days as young attorneys in Pottsville. Gowen's resignation was over the objections of his ally and friend, William Vanderbilt; but the former assured the recent investor in the Reading that the nature of his relationship with Keim would assure his close involvement in all matters related to running the company.{{sfnp|Schlegel|1947|p=247}}

The same meeting that elected Keim authorized a new US$12 million loan issue to pay the recently increased floating debt and the balance due on the Jersey Central deal. It considered a proposal from Gowen of paying out a 21% dividend on preferred stock, in case the loan issue should be successfully placed. However, in spite of President Gowen's glowing predictions at the end of calendar year 1883, "[s]carcely any of the benefits of [his] plan of reorganization had been secured; fixed charges had not been reduced, because it had been impossible to get creditors to take new securities in exchange for the old, and equally impossible to sell any considerable amount of the new securities for cash. {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

While old charges had remained unabated, new charges had been added ... and the very gain in earnings which might have been construed as favorable was due to increased mileage [i.e., expansion of the Reading system], and was not proportional to the growth of the system." An additional immediate legacy of the second Gowen expansionist presidency was the payment in company scrip for labor and supplies in May 1884 and an accompanying new fall in the value of Reading Railroad securities. On June 2, 1884, although Gowen was no longer president of the Reading, the company again passed as a direct result of his adventuristic management into bankruptcy and the hands of receivers, including this time not Gowen but his hand-picked successor as president, George deB. Keim.{{sfnp|Daggett|1908|p=100–101}}

Before Keim's election as president, Franklin Gowen had assured his friend, William Vanderbilt, that "on account of the relations existing between Mr. Keim and myself ... I can control the Reading...." {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} However the new management, under Keim, in fact was not keen to continue Gowen's affiliation with the company at all.  Following a confrontation between the two old friends, in which Gowen was told (by his own later recounting) "you were not a very successful president of this company, and now other people have got hold of it; we are responsible and you are not"; Gowen's hyperbolic response eventually obtained him a position as counsel, allowing him to offer advice but make no decisions.{{sfnp|Schlegel|1947|p=247–248}}

Throughout 1884 and into 1885, Gowen jockeyed and jostled to make his way back into active management of the Reading, but with no real headway.  A hidden roadblock to all his efforts was that management was attempting to obtain fresh financing through the Philadelphia firm of Drexel and Company. It was clear that these conservative financiers—including a not yet well known partner, J.P. Morgan—would have inevitably turned away from any such dealing if Franklin Gowen were managerially involved in the Reading. These matters were further complicated by tightening business conditions in those two years. Vanderbilt's alliance with Gowen had begun as part of a campaign by his New York Central against the Pennsylvania Railroad, and both of these trunk lines were feeling the pinch of hard times. Morgan felt the pinch as well in the form of poor performance from his New York Central share holdings.

Morgan then began a campaign of his own to bring peace—that is, an amicable reduction of profit-destroying competition—between the two trunk lines. In the working out of this peace, Gowen's erstwhile syndicate for constructing the South Penn line that would turn the Reading into a viably competitive trunk line was undermined entirely, leaving little prospect of completing that project. Ultimately, significant portions of the South Penn's right of way and partly completed gradings lay fallow until they were eventually utilized in the 1930s for construction of the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]].

====Gowen's ouster====
Gowen planned and undertook in November 1885 a new campaign to regain control of the Reading.  He published a plan that included having himself reappointed as a receiver, raising new millions of dollars, holding on to the Jersey Central (whose lease by the Reading was in jeopardy through litigation), and even to complete the elusive attainment of trunk line status for the railroad. In December, once again he rented the Philadelphia Academy of Music, which filled to standing room capacity to hear his three-hour oration denouncing present management and its willfully ignoring his advice on how to save the company, as well as the present receivers' reorganization plan. {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In place of these, Gowen proposed his own reorganization plan based, one more time, upon optimistic earnings estimates and his ability to attract new money into the company. Also, one more time, his oration carried the audience into great enthusiasm. Such was the momentum generated by Gowen's overall campaign that Keim conceded the January 1886 presidential election in advance; Gowen and his Board of Managers slate were elected unanimously and adopted a resolution calling for a change in the receivership. Notwithstanding the optimistic reorganization plan Gowen rode back into the presidency, shareholder enthusiasm and a board resolution were insufficient to remove the Reading from its deeply troubled circumstance. Before Gowen was able to mobilize any of the money required to take action, Morgan reentered the arena, this time heading a syndicate that offered to return peace and prosperity to the company through a different means. An anonymous member of Morgan's syndicate described a central element of the proposed peace:&lt;blockquote&gt;In order to do this it has been found necessary to get rid of Mr. Gowen. We have all combined to get him out of railroad management, just as all the powers of Europe combined to crush Napoleon, and there will be no peace until Mr. Gowen is in St. Helena. He is an able and brilliant man and in some respects a veritable Napoleon, but he is no railroad manager.... The trouble with Mr. Gowen is that he wants to be fighting all the time. When he was after the Molly Maguires he was in his element, but as a railroad manager he is a failure.&lt;ref&gt;Schlegel, p. 269, quoting the ''Philadelphia Times'', February 10, 1866.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This syndicate proposed its reorganization plan to the sitting receivers, who decided to cooperate towards putting it into effect. Gowen immediately attempted to put together his own syndicate, but this failed to bear sufficient fruit. Through a series of maneuverings with associates and erstwhile Gowen friends and allies, as well as minor changes to its original proposal, Morgan's group was able to win Gowen over — even to the provision requiring that he step down, once and for all, as president of the Reading Railroad. His resignation was effective September 17, 1886. {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==Life after the railroad==
Gowen never completely gave up the practice of law. A notable instance was during the run up to the Reading's May 1880 bankruptcy: in March Gowen was in Harrisburg prosecuting bribery cases on behalf of the state of Pennsylvania, growing out of the state's Railroad Riots Act investigations, and from Gowen's perspective an extension of his ongoing legal wranglings against the allied activities of the Pennsylvania Railroad and Standard Oil. Gowen was president of the Reading Railroad and also had a history of involvement in civic matters. He had been a Democratic representative to the state constitutional convention in 1873 and had been a board of governors member of the Philadelphia Reform Club. As well, also in the run up to the railroad's 1880 bankruptcy, he had lent his name in support of one side of a fight for control of the state Democratic convention. At another point during his presidency his name was rumored as a possible Democratic candidate for Pennsylvania governor. In his forced retirement from the active affairs of the Reading, Gowen spent time composing limericks and also translating German poetry. Involvement with literature was not new to him — recall his founding role in the Pottsville Literary Society decades before; and he was well versed enough in the stage to include lengthy descriptions of two plays in his speech at one of the Molly Maguire trials.&lt;ref&gt;Schlegel, p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the enforced peace introduced by J.P. Morgan among formerly cutthroat competing railroads, Gowen found opportunity to wage legal war against his old enemies, the Standard Oil and Pennsylvania Railroad, before the then new [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] (ICC). Early in 1889, he found himself in the odd position of representing an old friend, Eckley B. Coxe, in a suit before the ICC against, essentially, the same coal monopoly that Gowen himself had forged more than a decade before. Shortly before his death, many of Gowen's friends and associates noticed a change in his overall mood. They remarked upon his more somber demeanor and noted that for a trip home to Philadelphia, he had boarded the wrong train. Gowen wrote to his insurance agent on December 9, 1889, to ask if he could cash in his $90,000 life insurance policy. Three days later, after he had arrived in [[Washington, D.C.]], to argue a case before the Interstate Commerce Commission, Gowen purchased a revolver at a hardware store on Pennsylvania Avenue. {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==Death==
Franklin B. Gowen died of a gunshot wound to the head on December 13, 1889, at [[Wormley's Hotel]] in [[Washington, DC]].  There still remains some controversy as to whether his death was suicide or homicide.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Patrick (2002), ''Who killed Franklin Gowen?''; {{ISBN|0-9637701-5-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have speculated that he was murdered by Molly Maguires in retaliation. However, [[Francis I. Gowen|the Gowen family]] hired Captain Robert Linden of the Pinkerton Agency to investigate. Linden had been the senior Pinkerton involved in the Reading Co. and thus considered qualified to determine if there were any connection of that sort. Linden ruled out a Molly connection very quickly. The owner of Wolford's Hardware Store on Pennsylvania Avenue came forward to identify Gowen as the man who had bought a pistol the day before. Conspiracy theories about assassins and impersonations were put aside when the Gowen family reported that he had been "acting queerly for some time and that there was a strain of hereditary insanity in his family."&lt;ref&gt;James D. Horan and Howard Swiggett, ''The Pinkerton Story'', 1951, pp. 158–59.&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Simply put, [Gowen] turn[ed] the company from one of economic conservatism to daring adventurism. Every aspect of the [Reading Co.]'s existence was to be enervated and agitated and sometimes turned topsy-turvy during the Gowen years of the 1870s and 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;Holton, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The few scraps of letters and memoranda {{em|from}} Gowen that shed some light on this seem to indicate that he was impatient, even bored, when details of real railroading practices came to his attention.  It was corporate power and financial finagling that interested this complex man. . . . Gowen's financial rewards were meager, and while he did attain considerable public attention and the trappings of his office, this dynamic leader ultimately was consumed by his final failure and his career ended in tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;Holton, pp. 171–72 (emphasis in original text)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In December 2014, the FDA approved a nine-valent Gardasil-based vaccine, Gardasil 9, to protect against infection with the strains covered by the first generation of Gardasil as well as five other HPV strains responsible for 20% of cervical cancers (HPV-31, HPV-33, HPV-45, HPV-52, and HPV-58).&lt;ref name=Gardasil9&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm426485.htm|type=press release|title=FDA approves Gardasil 9 for prevention of certain cancers caused by five additional types of HPV|date=10 December 2014|access-date=28 February 2015|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110233107/http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm426485.htm|archive-date=10 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 2018, the FDA approved expanded use of Gardasil 9 to include individuals 27 through 45 years old.&lt;ref name="expanded"&gt;{{cite press release|title=FDA approves expanded use of Gardasil 9 to include individuals 27 through 45 years old |url=https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm622715.htm |accessdate=October 5, 2018 |work=fda.gov |date=October 5, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gardasil is a prophylactic HPV vaccine, meaning that it is designed to prevent HPV infections. For maximum effect, it is recommended that girls receive the vaccine prior to becoming sexually active. However, women who were already infected with one or more of the four HPV types targeted by the vaccine (6, 11, 16, or 18) were protected from clinical disease caused by the remaining HPV types in the vaccine. Common [[plantar wart]]s are caused by HPV 1, 2 and 4,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://virus.stanford.edu/papova/HPV.html |title=Humanitas Papiloma Virus |access-date=26 February 2018 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228135643/http://virus.stanford.edu/papova/HPV.html |archive-date=28 February 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which are not prevented by  this vaccine.

Since Gardasil will not block infection with all of the HPV types that can cause cervical cancer, the vaccine should not be considered a substitute for routine [[pap smear]]s.

Fewer HPV infections mean fewer complications from the virus and less time and money spent on the detection, work-up, and treatment of cervical cancer and its precursor, cervical dysplasia. It prevents infertility caused by cervical biopsies and reduces the [[laryngeal papillomatosis|severe respiratory problems of children who are infected by HPV from their mothers]].

In addition, protection against HPV 6 and HPV 11 is expected to eliminate 90% of the cases of genital warts. Gardasil also protects against [[vulvar cancer|vulvar]] and [[vaginal cancer]]s caused by HPV types 16 and 18.&lt;ref name=VulvarCA&gt;

In December 2010, Gardasil was approved by the FDA for prevention of anal cancer and associated precancerous lesions due to human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16, and 18 in people ages 9 through 26 years.&lt;ref&gt;

HPV infections, especially HPV 16, contribute to some [[head and neck cancer]] (HPV is found in an estimated 26-35% of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma).&lt;ref name="doi:10.1186/1758-3284-1-36"&gt;

FDA approved Gardasil 9 for women and men aged 27 to 45. In a large, longitudinal study of women in this age group (n=3200), the vaccine was found to be 88% effective against persistent HPV infections that cause certain types genital warts and cancers.  Vaccine efficacy for men in this age group was inferred. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=FDA approves expanded use of Gardasil 9 to include individuals 27 through 45 years old |url=https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm622715.htm |accessdate=9 October 2018 |agency=Food &amp; Drug Administration |date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Efficacy===

An alternative vaccine known as [[Cervarix]] is manufactured by [[GlaxoSmithKline]].&lt;ref name=pmid_20508593&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = FDA licensure of bivalent human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV2, Cervarix) for use in females and updated HPV vaccination recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) | journal = MMWR.

The [[National Cancer Institute]] says, "Gardasil and Cervarix have been shown to provide protection against persistent cervical HPV 16/18 infections for up to 8 years, which is the maximum time of research follow-up thus far...HPV vaccination has also been found to prevent nearly 100 percent of the precancerous cervical cell changes that would have been caused by HPV 16/18. The data so far show duration of protection for up to 6.4 years with Cervarix and for up to 5 years for Gardasil—in women who were not infected with HPV at the time of vaccination."&lt;ref name="National Cancer Institute HPV Q&amp;A" /&gt;

Gardasil has been shown to be partially effective (approximately 38%) in preventing cervical cancer caused by ten other high-risk HPV types.&lt;ref&gt;

===Biotechnology===
The HPV major [[capsid]] protein, L1, can spontaneously self-assemble into [[virus-like particle]]s (VLPs) that resemble authentic HPV [[virion]]s. Gardasil contains [[recombinant virus|recombinant]] VLPs assembled from the L1 proteins of HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18. Since VLPs lack the viral [[DNA]], they cannot induce cancer. They do, however, trigger an [[antibody]] response that protects vaccine recipients from becoming infected with the HPV types represented in the vaccine. The L1 proteins are produced by separate [[ethanol fermentation|fermentations]] in recombinant ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' and self-assembled into VLPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merck.ca/assets/en/pdf/products/GARDASIL-PM_E.pdf|title=Gardasil Product Monograph|author=Merck Canada Inc.|access-date=2013-02-20|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224164943/http://www.merck.ca/assets/en/pdf/products/GARDASIL-PM_E.pdf|archive-date=2014-02-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Cancer Institute]] writes:
:Widespread vaccination has the potential to reduce cervical cancer deaths around the world by as much as two-thirds, if all women were to take the vaccine and if protection turns out to be long-term. In addition, the vaccines can reduce the need for medical care, biopsies, and invasive procedures associated with the follow-up from abnormal Pap tests, thus helping to reduce health care costs and anxieties related to abnormal Pap tests and follow-up procedures.&lt;ref name="National Cancer Institute HPV Q&amp;A"&gt;

===Long-term impact and cost-effectiveness===
{{Update|date=July 2009}}

Whether the effects are temporary or lifelong, widespread vaccination could have a substantial public health impact. As of 2018, studies have proven that cervical cancer rates have dropped significantly since the introduction of Gardasil. &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aappublications.org/news/2018/08/09/cervicalcancer080918|title=Cervical cancer declines follow HPV vaccine introduction|last=Jenco|first=Melissa|date=August 9, 2018|website=AAP News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Gardasil was introduced in 2006, 270,000 women died of cervical cancer worldwide in 2002.&lt;ref name="pmid15860602"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohen J | title = Public health. High hopes and dilemmas for a cervical cancer vaccine | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5722 | pages = 618–21 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15860602 | doi = 10.1126/science.308.5722.618 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, the mortality rate from cervical cancer has dropped 50% from 1975 which is due to the Gardasil vaccination along with increased focus on cervical screening. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.net/cancer-types/cervical-cancer/statistics|title=Cervical Cancer: Statistics|last=|first=|date=January 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;Acting FDA Administrator [[Andrew von Eschenbach]] said the
vaccine will have "a dramatic effect" on the health of women around the world.&lt;ref name="FDAapproval"&gt;
{{cite news| url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13206572/ns/health-cancer/| title = FDA approves first vaccine for cervical cancer| work = [[msnbc.com]]| agency = [[Associated Press]]| date = June 16, 2006| access-date = 2006-06-08| deadurl = no| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110219171120/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13206572/ns/health-cancer/| archive-date = February 19, 2011| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gardasil is an important tool in reducing cervical cancer rates even in countries where screening programs are routine. The [[National Cancer Institute]] estimated that 9,700 women would develop cervical cancer in 2006, and 3,700 would die.&lt;ref name="National Cancer Institute SEER"&gt;[http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/cervix.html SEER Stat Fact Sheets: Cervix Uteri] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706125134/http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/cervix.html |date=2014-07-06 }}. [[National Cancer Institute]]. Retrieved 30 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Merck and [[CSL Limited]] are expected to market Gardasil as a cancer vaccine, rather than an [[Sexually transmitted disease|STD]] vaccine. In the early years of Gardasil's introduction it was  unclear how widespread the use of the three-shot series would be, in part because of its $525 list price ($175 each for three shots).&lt;ref name="Gardisil Vaccine - Vaccination"&gt;{{cite web|title=Health Blue Book|url=http://healthcarebluebook.com/page_Results.aspx?id=324&amp;dataset=MD&amp;g=Gardisil++Vaccine|access-date=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; But as of 2013, vaccine coverage has been rising.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2013, about 55% of girls ages 13-17 years had at least one dose of the vaccination covered, up from 29% in 2007. Coverage for women ages 18-34 also has increased significantly since 2007.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Studies using different pharmacoeconomic models predict that vaccinating young women with Gardasil in combination with screening programs may be more cost effective than screening alone.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | vauthors = Stanley M | title = Prevention strategies against the human papillomavirus: the effectiveness of vaccination | journal = Gynecologic Oncology | volume = 107 | issue = 2 Suppl 1 | pages = S19-23 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 17938013 | doi = 10.1016/j.ygyno.2007.07.068 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These results have been important in decisions by many countries to start vaccination programs.&lt;ref&gt;

{{cite journal | vauthors = Steben M | title = Rebuttal: Do you approve of spending $300 million on HPV vaccination?

Since penile and anal cancers are much less common than cervical cancer, HPV vaccination of young men is likely to be much less cost-effective than for young women.&lt;ref name=NYTIMES0808 /&gt;

The August 2009 issue of the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' had an article reiterating the safety of Gardasil&lt;ref name=pmid_19690307 /&gt; and another questioning the way it was presented to doctors and parents.&lt;blockquote&gt;The new vaccine against 4 types of human papillomavirus (HPV), Gardasil, like other immunizations appears to be a cost-effective intervention with the potential to enhance both adolescent health and the quality of their adult lives. However, the messages and the methods by which the vaccine was marketed present important challenges to physician practice and medical professionalism. By making the vaccine's target disease cervical cancer, the sexual transmission of HPV was minimized, the threat of cervical cancer to adolescents was maximized, and the subpopulations most at risk practically ignored. The vaccine manufacturer also provided educational grants to professional medical associations (PMAs) concerned with adolescent and women's health and oncology. The funding encouraged many PMAs to create educational programs and product-specific speakers' bureaus to promote vaccine use. However, much of the material did not address the full complexity of the issues surrounding the vaccine and did not provide balanced recommendations on risks and benefits. As important and appropriate as it is for PMAs to advocate for vaccination as a public good, their recommendations must be consistent with appropriate and cost-effective use.&lt;ref&gt;

According to the CDC, as of 2012, use of the HPV vaccine had cut rates of infection with HPV-6, -11, -16 and -18 in half in American teenagers (from 11.5% to 4.3%) and by one third in American women in their early twenties (from 18.5% to 12.1%).&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite web|author=Haelle, Tara|authorlink=Tara Haelle|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tarahaelle/2016/02/23/hpv-infection-rates-plummet-in-young-women-due-to-vaccine/#3b6a130d5c4d|title=HPV Infection Rates Plummet In Young Women Due To Vaccine|work=Forbes|date=February 23, 2016|access-date=February 23, 2016|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160226093032/http://www.forbes.com/sites/tarahaelle/2016/02/23/hpv-infection-rates-plummet-in-young-women-due-to-vaccine/#3b6a130d5c4d|archive-date=February 26, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Research findings that pioneered the development of the vaccine began in 1991 by investigators [[Jian Zhou]] and [[Ian Frazer]] in The [[University of Queensland]], Australia. Researchers at [[UQ]] found a way to form non-infectious virus-like particles (VLP), which could also strongly activate the immune system. Subsequently, the final form of the vaccine was developed in parallel, by researchers at [[Georgetown University]] Medical Center, the [[University of Rochester]], the [[University of Queensland]] in Australia, and the U.S. [[National Cancer Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McNeil C | title = Who invented the VLP cervical cancer vaccines? | journal = Journal of the National Cancer Institute | volume = 98 | issue = 7 | pages = 433 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16595773 | doi = 10.1093/jnci/djj144 | url = http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/98/7/433.full | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140226001813/http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/98/7/433.full | df =  | deadurl = no | archive-date = 2014-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, the FDA approved Gardasil-9, which protects against 9 strains of HPV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mrknewsroom.com/news-release/prescription-medicine-news/fda-approves-mercks-hpv-vaccine-gardasil9-prevent-cancers-an|title=FDA Approves Merck's HPV Vaccine, GARDASIL®9, to Prevent Cancers and Other Diseases Caused by Nine HPV types – Including Types that Cause About 90% of Cervical Cancer Cases - Merck Newsroom Home|author=|date=|website=www.mrknewsroom.com|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027084211/http://www.mrknewsroom.com/news-release/prescription-medicine-news/fda-approves-mercks-hpv-vaccine-gardasil9-prevent-cancers-an|archive-date=2017-10-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The governor of Texas, [[Rick Perry]], issued an executive order [[Rick Perry#Healthcare|adding Gardasil to the state's required vaccination list]], which was later overturned by the Texas legislature. Perry has also allowed parents to opt out of the program more easily. Through lobbying efforts, Merck has suggested that state governments make vaccination with Gardasil mandatory for school attendance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/21/business/21merck.html|title=Merck to halt lobbying for vaccine for girls|first1=Andrew|last1=Pollack|first2=Stephanie|last2=Saul|date=21 February 2007|access-date=4 July 2018|work=[[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has upset some conservative and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] groups.&lt;ref name="FDAapproval" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Houppert|first=Karen | name-list-format = vanc |url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20070326/houppert/print|title=Who's Afraid of Gardasil?|journal=[[The Nation]]|date=March 26, 2007|access-date=2009-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/moral-majority-take-on-gsk-and-merck-over-cancer-drugs-481844.html|title=Moral majority take on GSK and Merck over cancer drugs|author=Danny Fortson|work=[[The Independent]]|date=11 June 2006|access-date=2006-06-12|deadurl=no|archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20060614122733/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/moral-majority-take-on-gsk-and-merck-over-cancer-drugs-481844.html|archive-date=14 June 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few conservative groups, such as the [[Family Research Council]] (FRC), have expressed their fears that vaccination with Gardasil might give girls a false sense of security regarding sex and lead to promiscuity,&lt;ref name="FDAapproval" /&gt;&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Perry's decision was later criticized on September 12, 2011 by fellow presidential candidates [[Rick Santorum]] and [[Michele Bachmann]] during the [[Republican Party (United States) presidential debates, 2012|Republican Party presidential debate]] as being an overreach of state power in a decision properly left to parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In Republican Race, a Heated Battle Over the HPV Vaccine|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/14/us/politics/republican-candidates-battle-over-hpv-vaccine.html | first1 = Trip | last1 = Gabriel| first2 = Denise | last2 = Grady | name-list-format = vanc |work=New York Times|date=2011-09-13|access-date=2011-09-14|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914111415/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/14/us/politics/republican-candidates-battle-over-hpv-vaccine.html|archive-date=2011-09-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gigantothermy allows animals to maintain body temperature, but is most likely detrimental to endurance and muscle power as compared with endotherms due to decreased anaerobic efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Maximal Aerobic and Anaerobic Power Generation in Large Crocodiles versus Mammals: Implications for Dinosaur Gigantothermy|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0069361|journal = PLoS ONE|date = 2013-07-05|pmc = 3702618|pmid = 23861968|pages = e69361|volume = 8|issue = 7|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0069361|first = Roger S.|last = Seymour}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mammals' bodies have roughly four times as much surface area occupied by mitochondria as reptiles, necessitating larger energy demands, and consequently producing more heat to use in thermoregulation.  An ectotherm the same size of an endotherm would not be able to remain as active as the endotherm, as heat is modulated behaviorally rather than biochemically.  More time is dedicated to basking than eating.

== Advantages ==
Large ectotherms displaying the same body size as large endotherms have the advantage of a slow metabolic rate, meaning that it takes reptiles longer to digest their food.  Subsequently gigantothermic ectotherms would not have to eat as often as large endotherms that need to maintain a constant influx of food to meet energy demands.  Although lions are much smaller than crocodiles, the lions must eat more often than crocodiles because of the higher metabolic output necessary to maintain the lion's  heat and energy.  The crocodile needs only to lie in the sun to digest more quickly and create ATP.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5144">'''Ingression''' is one of the many changes in the location or relative position of [[Cell (biology)|cells]] that takes place during the [[gastrulation]] stage of animal development.  It produces an animal's [[mesenchyme]] cells at the onset of gastrulation.  During the [[epithelial-mesenchymal transition]] (EMT), the primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs) detach from the [[epithelium]] and become internalized mesenchyme cells that can migrate freely (Figure 1).  Each animal system utilizes an EMT to produce mesenchyme cells.&lt;ref name="PMID 18228256"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wu SY, Ferkowicz M, McClay DR |title= Ingression of primary mesenchyme cells of the sea urchin embryo: a precisely timed epithelial mesenchymal transition.|journal= Birth Defects Res C Embryo Today|volume=81 |issue=4 |pages=241–52|year=2007 |pmid= 18228256|doi=10.1002/bdrc.20113 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the mechanisms of ingression are not fully understood, studies using the sea urchin as a model organism have begun to shed light on this developmental process, and will be the focus here.  There are three main changes that must occur within a cell to enable the process of ingression.  The ingressing PMCs must first alter their affinity for the neighboring epithelial cells that will remain in the [[vegetal plate]] (vertebrate PMCs ingress from the [[primitive streak]]).  During this time, these cells must lose their affinity for the hyaline layer to which their [[apical surface]] is attached.  The ingressing cells will then apically constrict and alter their cellular architecture through a dramatic reorganization of their [[cytoskeleton]].  Lastly, these cells will modify their mode of motility and presumably gain affinity for the basal lamina which composes the lining of the [[blastocoel]], the future migration substrate of the PMCs,.&lt;ref name="PMID 12606282"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Peterson RE, McClay DR |title= Primary mesenchyme cell patterning during the early stages following ingression. |journal= Dev. Biol.|volume=254 |issue=1 |pages=68–78|year=2003 |pmid= 12606282|doi=10.1016/S0012-1606(02)00025-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://worms.zoology.wisc.edu/frogs/gast/gast_morph.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in the adhesion properties of these cells are the best characterized and understood mechanism of ingression.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  In sea urchins, epithelial cells adhere to one another as well as the hyaline layer through classic adherens and [[cadherin]] junctions.  Ingression is a very dynamic process however, and the first sign of an ingressing cell is seen when a future PMC loses its adhesion to hyaline, loses adhesion and cadherin, and increase their adhesion to a [[basal laminal]] substrate.  These processes occur rapidly, over approximately 30 minutes.  It is not understood how the PMCs penetrate the basal lamina.  The basal lamina is a loose matrix, therefore it is possible that the ingressing cells squeeze through the matrix.  It is also hypothesized that the PMCs use a [[protease]].&lt;ref name="PMID 18228256"/&gt; EMT is determined by a dynamic gene regulatory network (GRN). snail and twist are two key [[transcription factors]] that makes up the GRN. Within an hour of ingression, numerous transcript factors are activated.  It is known that [[beta-catenin]] (β-catenin) plays a key role in EMT.  When β-catenin function is blocked, no EMT results.  If β-catenin is over-expressed, too many cells undergo EMT.  The vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) is also necessary for the PMCs to function as mesenchymal cells.&lt;ref name="PMID 18228256"/&gt;  Lastly, it is thought that the ingression of PMCs is further facilitated simply through the simultaneous ingression neighboring cells.&lt;ref name="PMID 12606282"/&gt;

Within birds and mammals, [[epiblast]] cells converge at the midline and ingress at the primitive streak.  Ingression of these cells results in formation of the [[mesoderm]].&lt;ref&gt;. http://biology.kenyon.edu/courses/biol114/Chap14/Chapter_14.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of ingression to internalize presumptive mesoderm is considered a major evolutionary change in mesoderm morphogenesis within [[chordates]].  Within chordate embryos, there is an evolutionary trend exhibited in the mechanisms used to internalize presumptive mesoderm.  Basal chordates rely predominantly on invagination, anamniote vertebrates and reptiles on a varying combination of involution and ingression, and birds and mammals primarily on ingression.&lt;ref name="PMID 18041055"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shook DR, Keller R |title= Epithelial type, ingression, blastopore architecture and the evolution of chordate mesoderm morphogenesis. |journal= J Exp Zool B Mol Dev Evol.|volume=310 |issue=1 |pages=85–110|year=2008 |pmid= 18041055|doi=10.1002/jez.b.21198 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides ingression, two other types of internalizing cell movements may occur during gastrulation: [[invagination]] and [[Involution (medicine)|involution]].&lt;ref name="worms.zoology.wisc.edu"&gt;"http://worms.zoology.wisc.edu/frogs/gast/gast_morph.html"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Wasserman''' (born 1948)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=James Wasserman Biography |accessdate=2011-07-19 |url=http://jameswassermanbooks.com/Jimbio.html |work=Jameswassermanbooks.com |publisher=James Wasserman Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American author and occultist. A member of [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] since 1976 and a book designer by trade, he has written extensively on spiritual and political liberty.

==Publishing career==
Wasserman began working in 1973 at [[Weiser Books]], then the world’s largest bookstore and publishing company to specialize in esoteric literature. While working at Weiser, he met and befriended legendary filmmakers and occultists [[Harry Everett Smith|Harry Smith]] and [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Igliori |first=Paola |title=American Magus: Harry Smith |page=275 |publisher=Inandout Press |location=New York, NY |year=1996 |isbn=0-9625119-9-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wasserman worked with Brazilian occultist [[Marcelo Ramos Motta]] to publish the ''Commentaries of AL'' in 1975, for which he wrote the introduction. Additionally, he supervised the 1976 Weiser publication of [[The Book of the Law]], the first popular edition to append the holograph manuscript to the typeset text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Crowley |first=Aleister |authorlink=Aleister Crowley |title=The Book of the Law |publisher=Samuel Weiser |location=New York, NY |year=1976 |isbn=0-87728-334-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wasserman |first=James |title=In the Center of the Fire: A Memoir of the Occult 1966-1989 |page=111 |publisher=Ibis Press |location=Lake Worth, FL |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-89254-201-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, Wasserman arranged to professionally re-photograph [[Frieda Harris]]' [[Tarot]] paintings for use in an improved second edition of [[Aleister Crowley]]'s [[Thoth tarot deck|Thoth Tarot]] deck, and also wrote the instruction booklet.&lt;ref name="Just Energy Radio"&gt;{{cite web|last=Louise |first=Rita |url=http://www.justenergyradio.com/archive-pages/jwasserman.htm |title=James Wasserman - Secrets of Masonic Washington |work=Justenergyradio.com |publisher=Body, Mind &amp; SoulHealer |accessdate=November 22, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203104002/http://www.justenergyradio.com/archive-pages/jwasserman.htm |archivedate=December 3, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wasserman left Weiser in 1977 to found Studio 31, where he produced the ''[[Simon Necronomicon]]'', a volume purporting to be the mythological ''[[Necronomicon]]'' made famous by [[Howard Philips Lovecraft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Simon |title=The Necronomicon |publisher=Schlangekraft/Barnes Graphic |location=New York, NY |year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, it was reissued in a high-quality 31st anniversary edition by Ibis Press. In 1994, Wasserman assembled a team of scholars, photographers, and editorial staff to produce a full-color version of ''The Egyptian Book of the Dead'' featuring the [[Papyrus of Ani]] as discussed in [[In the Center of the Fire]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wasserman |first=James |title=In the Center of the Fire: A Memoir of the Occult 1966-1989 |pages=145–147 |publisher=Ibis Press |location=Lake Worth, FL |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-89254-201-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His edition of the Book of the Dead was described as offering "much of value in presentation, layout and commentary"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

In 2014, the Twentieth Anniversary Edition was completed, revised and expanded, adding: "Thoughts on this Twentieth Anniversary Edition" by James Wasserman;  "Coming Forth Into the Day" by [[J. Daniel Gunther]]; and "An Annotated Bibliography and Study Guide" by Dr. Ogden Goelet. This new edition includes some corrections and improvements to the color plates, and was completely recreated in electronic format.

==Ordo Templi Orientis==
A member of O.T.O. since 1976, Wasserman founded one of its oldest lodges, Tahuti Lodge, in [[New York City]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tahutilodge.org/history.php |title=Tahuti Lodge O.T.O., serving the New York City Metropolitan Area |year=2009 |work=Tahutilodge.org |publisher=Tahuti Lodge, [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] |accessdate=November 22, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123143703/http://tahutilodge.org/history.php |archivedate=November 23, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has played a key role within the Order in publishing the literary corpus of Aleister Crowley. In 1983, he worked with two other members of O.T.O. to produce ''[[The Holy Books of Thelema]],''&lt;ref name="Just Energy Radio"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Crowley |first=Aleister |authorlink=Aleister Crowley |title=The Holy Books of Thelema |publisher=Samuel Weiser |location=York Beach, Maine |year=1983 |isbn=0-87728-579-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wasserman |first=James |title=In the Center of the Fire: A Memoir of the Occult 1966-1989 |page=187 |publisher=Ibis Press |location=Lake Worth, FL |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-89254-201-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; a collection of Crowley’s Class A (inspired) writings. In 1986, his essay “An Introduction to the History of the O.T.O.” appeared in ''[[The Equinox]] III, No. 10''. In 2009, he and his wife Nancy published ''To Perfect This Feast,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wasserman |first=James &amp; Nancy|title=To Perfect This Feast: A Commentary on Liber XV  |page=3 |publisher=Sekmet Books |year=2010|edition =2nd |isbn=978-0-9718870-3-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; a performance commentary on the [[Liber XV, The Gnostic Mass|Gnostic Mass]]. Revised for a second edition in 2010, the book is now in its third and final edition, published 2013. Wasserman is described by Dan Burstein as "a founder of the modern Ordo Templi Orientis” in his guide to [[Dan Brown]]'s novel ''Angels &amp; Demons''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burstein |first=Dan |title=Secrets of Angels and Demons  |page=140 |publisher=CDS Books |location=New York, NY |year=2004 |isbn=1-59315-140-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Wasserman wrote ''In the Center of the Fire'', an extensive account of his own experiences in the development of the modern O.T.O.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wasserman |first=James |title=In the Center of the Fire: A Memoir of the Occult 1966-1989 |page=3 |publisher=Ibis Press |location=Lake Worth, FL |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-89254-201-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, he designed and produced a collection of essays for Ordo Templi Orientis published as ''Success Is Your Proof: One Hundred Years of O.T.O. in North America: A Festschrift in Honor of Hymenaeus Beta, Celebrating Thirty Years of Leadership''. He contributed an essay entitled "The New Aeon in the New World: The Law of Liberty in the Wild West." Eleven other ranking members of the Order contributed essays on a wide range of topics such as Thelemic doctrine, magical practices, Order history, and biographical treatments.

==Underlying philosophy==
Wasserman’s work in O.T.O. and his numerous writings point to a philosophy based on individual liberty and the opportunity for direct personal experience of God within.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wasserman |first=James|title=Divine Warriors: The Birth of Heresy  |page=84 |publisher=Destiny Books |year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This more modern conception of   [[Gnosticism]]  dispenses with the myriad variations  of the term as it is applied to numerous sub sects within major religions long ago. Modern Gnosticism simply presupposes the ability to forge a direct link with the highest level of divinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wasserman |first=James |title=The Temple of Solomon: From Ancient Israel to Secret Societies |page=18 |publisher=Inner Traditions |location=Rochester, VT |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-59477-220-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Wasserman further advances the notion that political liberty offers humanity the best conditions for spiritual growth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jameswassermanbooks.com/Political-liberty.html Political Liberty as a Spiritual Value]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public appearances==
Wasserman has appeared on several television networks including The History Channel, The Discovery Channel, National Geographic TV; and numerous radio broadcasts including NPR, Coast to Coast Radio, and 21st Century Radio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jameswassermanbooks.com/jim-mediapage.html James Wasserman Media Page]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, he discussed his book ''Secrets of Masonic Washington'' at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube |id=0QDMK_CUeP8 |title=James Wasserman at the National Press Club 2009 Part 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, his performance of Liber Israfel was broadcast on The Discovery Channel in a program entitled Secrets of Secret Societies. In 2013, Swirling Star Lodge filmed a 50-minute talk he presented on a modern history of the O.T.O, a supplement to ''In the Center of the Fire''.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube |id=TmDsxyTc3a8 |title=James Wasserman at Swirling Star Lodge,  "A Modern History of the O.T.O." 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Swirling Star Lodge released a video of a performance of the Gnostic Mass based on the instructions in ''To Perfect This Feast''  &lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube |id=VhUpJubHlAc |title=To Perfect This Feast: The Gnostic Mass 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, Wasserman addressed the O.T.O. in Vancouver, British Columbia in celebration of its one hundredth year in North America. In 2017 he addressed NOTOCON on "The Roots of O.T.O. in the Crusades," a public version of which is on his website.

'''John Bede Dalley''' (5 October 1876 – 6 September 1935) was an Australian journalist and novelist, editor of ''[[Melbourne Punch]]''.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;

Dalley was born in Rose Bay, Sydney, the second son of [[William Bede Dalley]] (1831–1888) and Eleanor Jane, ''née'' Long.&lt;ref name=ADB&gt;

Following his father's death in 1888, John and his brothers were sent to England by their Uncle and guardian [[William Alexander Long]], where they attended St Augustine's Abbey school at [[Ramsgate]], and [[Beaumont College]]. On 1 November 1895, Dalley matriculated from [[University College, Oxford]].&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;

Dalley was [[called to the bar]] in London in 1901 and practised at Sydney until 1907, when he joined the staff of ''[[The Bulletin]]'' after becoming deaf from a fall off a horse. After being rejected several times, he joined the Australian Field Artillery in March 1915 as [[Second Lieutenant]].&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt; He served in World War I for three years in [[Egypt]] and France.

On Dalley's return from the War, he rejoined ''The Bulletin''. In 1924 Dalley was appointed editor of ''Melbourne Punch'' which, however, ceased publication about a year later. Dalley returned to Sydney and became associate-editor of ''The Bulletin''. He then spent several years in London as representative of the ''[[The Herald (Australia)|Melbourne Herald]]''.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt; In 1928 he published a novel ''No Armour'', which was followed in 1929 by ''Max Flambard'', and in 1930 by ''Only the Morning''. These books, though scarcely in the front rank of Australian fiction, are all well written commentaries on the life of the period. Dalley also wrote short stories and was an excellent all-round journalist. He was washed off the rocks while fishing and drowned on 6 September 1935. He married Claire, daughter of Charles Scott, who survived him with a daughter.

A '''Kelgian''' ([[Sector General#Sector General's physiological classification system|physiological classification]] '''DBLF''') is one of about seventy known intelligent species in the fictional [[Sector General]] universe, and one of the most common species in Sector 12 General Hospital itself.  Overall, A Kelgian resembles a 5–6&amp;nbsp;ft. long furry [[caterpillar]] whose fur is constantly rippling in various patterns.  The motion of the fur of a Kelgian is a completely accurate guide to what it is feeling and necessary for communication within the species itself.  This trait makes the Kelgians completely incapable of any form of untruth.

==Physical summary==

===Requirements===
Kelgians, as indicated by the first letter "D" of their classification, are oxygen breathers whose normal gravity approximates the [[standard gravity]] of Earth.  Their atmosphere is an oxygen-nitrogen combination that also approximates Earth's.  They are [[herbivores]], eating plants (such as crelletin vine shoots) by putting their face inside of their bowl.  They sleep in an "S" or a question mark pose in zero-gravity or, in regular gravity, on a bed.

===Physiology===
They are about 5–6&amp;nbsp;ft. long once they reach maturity and they walk and lie [[horizontal plane|horizontally]], although they can temporarily stand up on their rearmost four legs, at which point they would be at eye level with average humans. They have four extensible eye-stalks which can turn to give a 360° view of their surroundings.  Their number of legs varies throughout the series, but is generally held to be 12 pairs, or 24 legs.&lt;ref name="24legs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elvwood.org/Gurps/SectorGeneral/Kelgians.html|title=GURPS Sector General races|year=2002|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|accessdate=11 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have no neck or skeleton, due to an immense and highly vulnerable [[cardiovascular system]].  This system is complex, with two hearts and many thin-walled [[blood vessels]] near the surface. This, combined with high pressure and a high pulse rate, makes cuts very dangerous; a Kelgian can bleed to death from a minor injury if not controlled. Their skin is thicker than a human's, and they have two mouths, one for their digestive system and one for their respiratory system.  A Kelgian female conceives once in her lifetime, producing two offspring of each gender.  Their speech sounds like a series of hoots and whines to human ears.

Their fur, which is always in motion, is a perfect and uncontrollable mirror to their emotional state, and gives emotional context to the Kelgian voice which has no emotion in it.  They highly value their fur, as it is very important to their pre-marriage proposals and allows them to speak properly.  Doctors operating on them will try to remove as little fur as possible.  Because of the properties of their fur, Kelgians never developed the concept of being diplomatic, lying, or politeness (and indeed are infamous for this trait).

The '''Kungälv school shooting''' took place on 4 March 1961 in Kungälvs läroverk, in central [[Kungälv]] in [[Västra Götaland]], [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scancomark.com/Scandinavia-today/Swedish-public-school-students-prepared-to-protect-themselves-in-case-of-a-school-shooting-120716032013|title=Swedish public school students drilled to protect themselves in case of a school  shooting|first=Driscole - Granscole Studios|last=London|website=www.scancomark.com|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school is currently known as [[Thorildskolan]]. It was the first reported [[school shooting]] in Sweden and one of the earliest in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;https://schoolshooters.info/sites/default/files/timeline_school_shootings_1.5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Seven youngsters were wounded by 15 bullets fired by the perpetrator and one died from his wounds.

The memory of the murdered Per Håkan Altvall is kept alive in Kungälv via a stipend "awarded annually to one or a number of students known for good friendship and social support to students".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Anja|first=Paulsson|title=Per Håkan AltvallsStipendium|url=http://www.kungalv.se/upload/1%20Skola/Gymnasiet%20Syd/Nytt/v%2020.pdf|accessdate=22 December 2012|newspaper=Mimers Hus Gymnasium Nytt|year=2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714204952/http://www.kungalv.se/upload/1%20Skola/Gymnasiet%20Syd/Nytt/v%2020.pdf|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Incident ==
Around 23:30 on March 4, 1961, a large group of youngsters were dancing in the school gym hall. During the last dance, 17-year-old Ove Conry Andersson entered, pulled out a gun and started shooting randomly. People attempted to hide under chairs and behind a piano. Seven were wounded, including 18-year-old Per Håkan Altvall, who later died from his wounds. He was hit in the stomach&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thelocal.se/20130320/46828 |newspaper=[[The Local]] |title=School shooting 'likely' in Sweden: agency |author=The Local/dl |date=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an eyewitness states that the perpetrator first shot Altvall in the leg and later on his way out shot him again in the stomach, killing him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stromstadstidning.se/nyheter/gl%C3%B6m-inte-skolattacken-1979-1.2117831|title="Glöm inte skolattacken 1979"|work=Strömstads tidning|access-date=2017-03-04|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wounded were first taken to a classroom in the school and later to Kungälv hospital.

Kungälv police chased the gunman all night on the road to [[Ytterby]], where it was assumed he had escaped. Kungälv police requested assistance from police in both Ytterby and [[Gothenburg]]. The following morning, March 5, just before 8 a.m., the killer showed up at the police station, driven there by an older coworker. A few hours later, the 17 year old gunman had willingly told the police all his details of the incident. The shooter had been to a different party earlier and drank two mixed drinks, then watched an ice hockey game while drinking cognac with a friend. At 10.30 p.m. he first entered the school dance and got into a fight with a guest who was also an amateur boxer. Andersson then went to get his gun, came back and started shooting, killing Altvall before escaping and hiding in the Fontin forest. The chase for Andersson was the largest police activity in west Sweden to date, involving a total of 50 policemen plus dogs.  

On March 6, all of the school gathered in the gym hall in memory of Per Altvall.

==Perpetrator==
Andersson was known in Kungälv for his interest in cowboy movies and told the police he wanted to be like heroes in the movies. This event led to the first proposal to the government to investigate the effects of media violence, and the then-popular radio show "Tidsspegeln" (Mirror of Time) held a debate about "ideals and heroes for the youth" with the headline "Can we blame [[Bonanza|Cartwrights]]".

A 1995 article in Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter reported that Andersson was considered mentally unbalanced, partly because of the effects of alcohol, at the time of the shooting, and sentenced to closed psychiatric treatment. He refused to comment but DN mentioned that "it is known that he had married and had children less than four years after the incident." Altvall's mother Essie, then 88, was also interviewed and mentioned that she reached out to Andersson's mother shortly after the shooting and had forgiven the shooter for the murder of her son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dn.se/arkiv/lordag-sondag/forlat-sonens-mordare |newspaper=[[Dagens Nyheter]] |title=Förlät sonens mördare |trans-title=Forgave his son's killer |first=Anna-Maria |last=Hagerfors |date=1995-02-19 |access-date=23 October 2015 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andersson committed [[suicide]] on 12 August 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://densvartadahlian.blogg.se/2012/november/skottdramat-i-kungalv.html|title=- Skottdramat i Kungälv|website=densvartadahlian.blogg.se|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alberto Pérez Jiménez''' (May 15, 1975 – June 29, 2009) was a [[Mexico|Mexican]] ''[[Lucha libre|Luchador]]'' ''[[wrestling mask|enmascarado]]'' who worked in the ''[[Mini-Estrella]]'' division from 1990 until his death in 2009.  He was best known under the [[ring name]] '''La Parkita''', having used the name in [[Asistencia Asesoría y Administración]] (AAA), the Mexican [[Independent circuit]] and [[Chikara (professional wrestling)|Chikara]] in the United States. His older brother Mario and twin brother Alejandro also wrestled under the names [[Espectrito]] and [[Espectrito II]] respectively.  On June 29, 2009 both twins were killed by prostitutes in Mexico City.

==Professional wrestling career==
After being trained by his older brother Mario, who wrestles as [[Espectrito]], Alberto made his professional wrestling debut in 1990 as a ''Mini-Estrella'' named Gemelito Diablo. Working in the Mini division does not necessarily mean that Alberto is a [[Dwarfism|dwarf]] as several short wrestlers work in the "Mini" division.&lt;ref name=MondoMini&gt;{{cite book|author=Madigan, Dan|title=Mondo Lucha A Go-Go: the bizarre &amp; honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling|publisher=HarperCollins Publisher|year=2007|chapter=You ain't seen nothing yet: the minis|pages=209–212|isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on he wrestled as ''Voladorcito'', a mini version of the wrestler [[Super Parka|Volador]] and even briefly wore the outfit of ''Octagoncito'' when the original [[Octagoncito]] was unable to wrestle.

In 1992 [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]]'s (CMLL) head booker [[Antonio Peña]] left the promotion to create his own promotion, [[Asistencia Asesoría y Administración]] (AAA). In CMLL Peña had been instrumental in the creation of the ''Mini-Estrellas'' division and immediately started a Minis division in AAA as well, consisting of several CMLL Minis and a crew of new Minis signed on AAA's creation.&lt;ref name=SL182&gt;{{cite news|author=Ocampo, Ernesto|title=El fin de una era: Adiós a Antonio Peña|work=SuperLuchas|id=issue 182|date=October 7, 2006|url=http://superluchas.net/2006/10/07/el-fin-de-una-era/|accessdate=October 14, 2009|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these signees was Alberto Pérez Jiménez, through the recommendation of his brother Mario Pérez Jiménez who worked for AAA at the time. Jiménez was given the gimmick of ''La Parkita'', a ''Mascota'' (Miniature version) of the popular wrestler [[Adolfo Tapia|La Parka]], complete with a skeleton mask and body suit. Later on Alberto began doing double duty, working some nights as La Parkita and other nights as ''Payasito Amarillo'', forming a trio with ''Payasito Rojo'' and ''Payasito Azul'' to form the trio ''Los Payasitos'' a mini version of the ''rudo'' (bad guy or [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]]) trio of clowns called ''[[Los Payasos]]''. On June 10, La Parkita was one of the 13 Minis who participated in the main event of [[Triplemanía III-A]], a multi-man ''[[Lucha libre#Luchas de Apuestas|Luchas de Apuestas]]'', or bet match, where each participant put their mask on the line. La Parkita managed to save his mask while Payasito Rojo was unmasked after the match.&lt;ref name="Trip3A"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/triple.html#iii-a|title=Asistencia Asesoria y Administracion TripleMania|accessdate=January 15, 2010|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight days later La Parkita was on the losing side of an eight-mini match at [[Triplemanía III-B]]; the match saw the team of Torerito, [[Super Muñequito]], [[Octagoncito]] and [[Mascarita Sagrada]] defeat La Parkita, Espectrito I, Espectrito II and Fuercita Guerrera.&lt;ref name="Trip3B"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/triple.html#iii-b|title=Asistencia Asesoria y Administracion TripleMania|accessdate=January 15, 2010|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later the Jiménez brothers lost to [[Tzuki|Máscarita Sagráda, Jr.]], Super Muñequito and Mini Frisbee at [[Triplemanía IV-C]].&lt;ref name="Trip4C"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/triple.html#iv-c|title=Asistencia Asesoria y Administracion TripleMania|accessdate=January 15, 2010|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alberto left AAA, being fired for missing too many shows. Peña gave the ''La Parkita'' to another wrestler but Alberto kept working as La Parkita on the Mexican [[Independent circuit]], although he never regularly worked for one single promotion after leaving AAA.

==Personal life==
Alberto Pérez Jiménez is the twin brother of Alejandro Pérez Jiménez who was best known under the ring name Espectrito II or Espectro, Jr. Alberto and Alejandro's older brother Mario Pérez Jiménez is also a wrestler known primarily as Espectrito.

==Death==
{{wikinews|65-year-old woman arrested over the death of two Mexican wrestlers}}
Alberto Pérez Jiménez along with his twin brother Alejandro (also a professional midget wrestler under the name of [[Espectrito II]]), were found murdered on June 29, 2009. It was reported that the two brothers checked into a hotel after a Sunday night show. Allegedly two female prostitutes approached the wrestlers, and were invited back to their hotel room. There the two women spiked the men's drinks with what was believed to be eye drops mixed with alcohol.&lt;ref name=death&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/wrestling/2513096/Mexican-wrestling-midget-brothers-found-dead-after-hooker-romp.html|title=Midget wrestlers dead after hooker romp|author=Aldren, Mike|date=July 2, 2009|accessdate=August 19, 2009|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The drinks were intended to knock the men out, but they died instead, perhaps due to their small stature. The prostitutes were allegedly part of a group called  La Filtracion.&lt;ref name=BBCArrest/&gt;&lt;ref name=death/&gt; On July 22, 2009 it was reported that the Mexican police had arrested one of the two women suspected in the death of the Pérez Jiménez twins. Police traced the whereabouts of the woman by tracking one of the Pérez Jiménez' twins cell phones which she used. The woman admitted to going to the hotel room with the Pérez Jiménez twins but denied being involved in their death.&lt;ref name=BBCArrest&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8162991.stm|title=Mexican midget wrestlers arrest.|date=July 22, 2009|accessdate=August 19, 2009|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 12, 2009 Mexican police tracked down the second supspect in [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]] and arrested her. She admitted to being at the crime scene but maintained that it was her accomplice who administered the drugs that killed the Pérez Jiménez twins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://superluchas.net/2009/08/12/ya-capturadas-las-dos-presuntas-responables-de-la-muerte-de-la-parkita-y-espectrito-ii/|title=Capturadas las dos presuntas responsables de la muerte de La Parkita y Espectrito II|date=August 12, 2009|accessdate=August 19, 2009|author=Ocampo, Jorge|work=SuperLuchas|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two women were later found guilty and, on July 12, 2010, sentenced to 47 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/694931.html|title=Sentencian a 47 años a asesinas de mini luchadores|date=July 12, 2010|accessdate=July 13, 2010|author=Martínez, Fernando|work=[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]]|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of the Jiménez twins' murder was the subject of an episode of ''Tabloid with [[Jerry Springer]]'' that shows a dramatized version of the events including an interview with their mother Maria Elena Jiménez and brother Juan Jiménez. The episode revealed that Alberto was starting to become involved with local politics, but did not reveal any actual links between their death and Alberto's political aspirations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | series=Tabloid with Jerry Springer | title=Fame and Misfortune | network=[[Investigation Discovery]] | date=June 20, 2015 |season=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Not to be confused with==
While Alberto Pérez Jiménez was the first wrestler to use the "La Parkita" ring character at least two other wrestlers have used the name in AAA after Alberto left the promotion.
*[[Octagoncito (AAA)|La Parkita II]] – The wrestler that took over after Jiménez, currently wrestles as the second version of Octagoncito
*[[La Parkita III]] – The current version of La Parkita, having played the part since 1997

[[Captain (land)|Major]] '''Lee Lue''' (1935 &amp;ndash; 12 July 1969) was a [[Laos|Laotian]] [[Hmong people|Hmong]] [[fighter bomber]] pilot notable for flying more combat missions than any other pilot in the [[Kingdom of Laos]]. Lee Lue flew continuously, as many as 10 missions a day and averaging 120 combat missions a month to build a total of more than 5,000 sorties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afa.org/magazine/June1999/0699plain.asp Air Force Association - The Plain of Jars] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010110927/http://www.afa.org/magazine/june1999/0699plain.asp |date=2006-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee Lue was the leader of the special group of Hmong pilots flying [[T-28 Trojan|T-28Ds]] from [[Long Tieng]] against the [[Pathet Lao]] and [[North Vietnamese]] positions. The group was funded by the [[CIA]] and was part of the regular [[Royal Lao Air Force]], but took orders directly from MR2 Commander Gen. Vang Pao. He was shot down by anti-aircraft fire and killed over Laos near [[Muang Soui]] on 12 July 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utdallas.edu/library/collections/speccoll/Leeker/laos3.pdf Air America in Laos III – in combat] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614182457/http://www.utdallas.edu/library/collections/speccoll/Leeker/laos3.pdf |date=2007-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his death, he had flown more combat missions than any pilot in history.&lt;ref&gt;Hillmer, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

A motto attributed to him was "Fly 'til you die."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hamline.edu/gse/diversity_web/hmong.pdf |title=Hmong - A Resource Guide for teachers |accessdate=2013-10-01 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071108163808/http://www.hamline.edu/gse/diversity_web/hmong.pdf |archivedate=November  8, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Lee Lue was born in 1935 to Chong Ger Lee and his wife Pa Vang in the village of Phou Pheng in [[Xiangkhoang Province]], Laos. In 1953, Lee Lue's family moved to Xieng Khouang city after the [[Vietnam]]ese invaded Laos. After the war ended in 1955, Lee Lue married Jou and two years later their first child, a son named Ze, was born. Lee Lue studied in Xieng Khouang city and later enrolled in teacher training school. In 1959, he took a position as an elementary school teacher in Lat Houng. He was among a handful of Hmong teachers in the entire country.  As the Secret War was escalating in 1967, [[Touby Lyfoung]] and General [[Vang Pao]] requested volunteers for flight training in T-28s. The training took place in Thailand. With six months of flight training, Lee Lue and another volunteer, Vang Toua, became the first two Hmong T-28 fighter pilots. Lee Lue successfully flew aerial support for ground troops and built a record number of sorties.

Away from the war, Lee Lue devoted his time to studying maps, and playing cards with his comrades. Prior to his death, Lee Lue had purchased his military uniform and was waiting to receive the rank of major. "He was excited about the promotion," said his wife Jou.  Hours before his death, the area of Muang Soui was under heavy enemy attack.  Gen. Vang Pao then telephoned Lee Lue, who was flying from Vientiane, to see if he carried any bombs with him as he was on his way to Long Cheng. Lee Lue's [[North American T-28 Trojan|T-28]] was armed. Vang Pao needed Lee Lue to attack the [[Pathet Lao]] troops in Muang Soui as they were losing ground as well as troops. On that day, Lee Lue's T-28 was hit and his plane was later found in debris. "His death is among a few soldiers I cried to," stated Vang Pao in 2006. According to Christopher Robbin's book, ''The Ravens'', respect for Lee Lue and his skills was shared by not just the Hmong but also seasoned American pilots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learnabouthmong.org/presentation/hmonghistory_files/frame.htm#slide0007.htm HMONG HISTORICAL FIGURES PRESENTATION] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927095233/http://www.learnabouthmong.org/presentation/hmonghistory_files/frame.htm |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, Vang Toua was lost among thick clouds and never seen again.

[[File:LeMisanthrope.jpg|thumb|''[[The Misanthrope|Le Misanthrope]]'', 1719 ed.]]
'''Misanthropy''' is the general [[hatred]], dislike, [[distrust]] or [[contempt]] of the [[human]] species or [[human nature]]. A '''misanthrope''' or '''misanthropist''' is someone who holds such views or feelings. The word's origin is from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words [[wikt:μῖσος|μῖσος]] (''misos'', "hatred") and [[wikt:ἄνθρωπος|ἄνθρωπος]] (''anthrōpos'', "man, human"). The condition is often confused with [[asociality]].

== Western culture ==
=== Arts ===
[[Gustave Flaubert]] once declared that he would "die of suppressed rage at the folly of [his] fellow men."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vFzQdS8N_5IC&amp;pg=PR14|title=The Letters of Gustave Flaubert: 1857-1880|page=xiv|publisher=Harvard University Press|date=1982|isbn=0674526406}}&lt;/ref&gt; Misanthropy has also been ascribed to a number of writers of satire, such as [[William S. Gilbert]] ("I hate my fellow-man") and [[William Shakespeare]] (''[[Timon of Athens]]''). [[Jonathan Swift]] is widely believed to have been misanthropic (see ''[[A Tale of a Tub]]'' and, most especially, Book IV of ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]''). Poet [[Philip Larkin]] has been described as a misanthrope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books-mr-miseryguts-philip-larkins-letters-show-all-the-grim-humour-that-was-a-hallmark-of-his-great-1558190.html|title=Books: Mr Miseryguts: Philip Larkin's letters show all the grim humour that was a hallmark of his great poems, but, as the years pass, they also chart the true depths of his misanthropy and despair|last=Raban|first=Jonathan|newspaper=The Independent|date=October 17, 1992|accessdate=June 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Molière]]'s play ''[[The Misanthrope]]'' is one of the more famous French plays on this topic. Less famous, but more contemporary is the 1971 play by [[Françoise Dorin]], ''[[Un sale égoïste]]'' (A Filthy Egoist) which takes the point of view of the misanthrope and entices the viewer to understand his motives.

[[Michelangelo]] has been called a misanthrope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1bALBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA211|title=Art, Myth and Deviance|page=211|last=Shoham|first=Shlomo Giora|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|date=2008|isbn=1443802972}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Don Van Vliet]] (commonly known as Captain Beefheart) has been described as a misanthrope, with close friend Kristine McKenna stating that he "thought human beings were the worst species that was ever dreamed up".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/dec/18/local/la-me-captain-beefheart-20101218/2|title=Don Van Vliet dies at 69; avant-garde rock musician known as Captain Beefheart|last=Cromelin|first=Richard|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=December 18, 2010|accessdate=June 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Morrissey]], a songwriter, has been dubbed "pop's most famous misanthrope".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://flavorwire.com/466695/the-most-morrissey-lyrics-from-morrisseys-new-album|title=The Most Morrissey Lyrics From Morrissey’s New Album|last=Hawking|first=Tom|magazine=Flavorwire|date=July 15, 2014|accessdate=June 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fernando Pessoa]]'s "factless autobiography" ''[[The Book of Disquiet]]'' has been described as misanthropic. {{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

=== Philosophy ===
The [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic philosopher]] [[Heraclitus]] was by various accounts a misanthrope and a loner who had little patience for human society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ancient.eu/Heraclitus_of_Ephesos/|title=Heraclitus_of_Ephesus|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/54988783|title=Death by philosophy : the biographical tradition in the life and death of the archaic philosophers Empedocles, Heraclitus, and Democritus|last=1953-|first=Chitwood, Ava,|date=2004|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=|isbn=0472113887|location=Ann Arbor|pages=80|oclc=54988783}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a fragment, the philosopher complained that "people [were] forever without understanding" of what was, in his view, the nature of reality.

In Western philosophy, misanthropy has been connected to [[social isolation|isolation from human society]]. In [[Plato]]'s ''[[Phaedo]]'', [[Socrates]] describes a misanthrope in relation to his fellow man: "Misanthropy develops when without art one puts complete trust in somebody thinking the man absolutely true and sound and reliable and then a little later ''discovers'' him to be bad and unreliable ... and when it happens to someone often ... he ends up ... hating everyone."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Stern| first=Paul| title=Socratic Rationalism and Political Philosophy: An Interpretation of Plato's Phaedo| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nJAFnvm2fg4C| year=1993| publisher=SUNY Press| isbn=978-0-7914-1573-3| page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Misanthropy, then, is presented as a potential result of thwarted expectations or even excessively naïve optimism, since Plato argues that "art" would have allowed the potential misanthrope to recognize that the majority of men are to be found in between good and evil.&lt;ref&gt;Stern 95.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] follows a more [[Ontology|ontological]] route: the misanthrope, as an essentially [[solitude|solitary]] man, is not a man at all: he must be a beast or a god, a view reflected in the [[Renaissance]] view of misanthropy as a "beast-like state".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Jowett| first=John| title=The Oxford Shakespeare: The Life of Timon of Athens| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gHTKzYKrh6wC| year=2004| publisher=Oxford UP| isbn=978-0-19-281497-5| page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a difference between philosophical pessimism and misanthropy. [[Immanuel Kant]] said that "Of the crooked timber of humanity, no straight thing can ever be made", and yet this was not an expression of the uselessness of mankind itself. Kant further stated that hatred of mankind can take two distinctive forms: aversion from men ([[Anthropophobia]]) and enmity towards them.&lt;ref name="kant191"&gt;{{cite book| author=Immanuel Kant| title=Lectures on Ethics| date=2001-03-19| publisher=Cambridge University Press| isbn=978-0-521-78804-5| page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; The condition can arise partly from dislike and partly from ill-will.&lt;ref name="kant191"/&gt;

[[Martin Heidegger]] has also been said&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/926820993|title=Reading Heidegger's Black Notebooks 1931-1941|last=|first=|publisher=|others=Farin, Ingo,, Malpas, Jeff,|year=|isbn=0262034018|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=321|oclc=926820993}}&lt;/ref&gt; to show misanthropy in his concern of the "they"—the tendency of people to conform to one view, which no one has really thought through, but is just followed because, "they say so". This might be thought of as more a criticism of [[conformity]] than of people in general. Unlike [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], Heidegger was opposed to any systematic ethics; however, in some of his later thought he does see the possibility of harmony between people, as part of the four-fold, mortals, gods, earth and sky.

== Jewish thought ==
In the Judeo philosophies (800–1400), the [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish philosopher]] [[Saadia Gaon]] uses the [[Platonism|Platonic]] idea that the self-isolated man is dehumanized by friendlessness&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|title=Friendliness; and my fight against it|first=Gavin|last=McLoughlin |publisher=Touchstone Press |year=2003|pages=2–6|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; to argue against the misanthropy of [[anchorite]] [[asceticism]] and [[Recluse|reclusiveness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Goodman| first = Lenn Evan| title = Jewish and Islamic Philosophy: Crosspollinations in the Classic Age| year = 1999| publisher = [[Edinburgh University Press]]| pages = 25–6| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Misanthropy is more pronounced among people from specific professions, especially among content moderators. This outlook often derives from the serious psychological toll of reviewing violent, sexually abusive, and disturbing content for a living.&lt;ref&gt;Doughty, Howard A. "What's Yours Is Mine: Against the Sharing Economy." The Innovation Journal 21.1 (2016): 1.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=The Innovation Journal article referenced is a review by Doughty of a book by Tom Slee about the Sharing Economy, specifically Uber and AirBnB, and not about content moderators being misanthropic|date=August 2018}}

In ''[[Nautilus (science magazine)|Nautilus]]'', Leonard Mlodinow writes of [[Isaac Newton]], "It would be nice to be able to say that this giant of intellect was an empathetic, agreeable man, but if he had any such tendencies he did a good job suppressing them and coming off as an arrogant misanthrope."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://nautil.us/issue/19/illusions/the-loneliest-genius|title=The Loneliest Genius|last=Mlodinow|first=Leonard|magazine=Nautilus|date=November 27, 2014|accessdate=June 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23298">'''Models of neural computation''' are attempts to elucidate, in an abstract and mathematical fashion, the core principles that underlie information processing in biological nervous systems, or functional components thereof. This article aims to provide an overview of the most definitive models of neuro-biological computation as well as the tools commonly used to construct and analyze them.

==Introduction==
Due to the complexity of nervous system behavior, the associated experimental error bounds are ill-defined, but the relative merit of the different [[scientific model|models]] of a particular subsystem can be compared according to how closely they reproduce real-world behaviors or respond to specific input signals. In the closely related field of computational [[neuroethology]], the practice is to include the environment in the model in such a way that the [[Control theory#Closed-loop transfer function|loop is closed]]. In the cases where competing models are unavailable, or where only gross responses have been measured or quantified, a clearly formulated model can guide the scientist in designing experiments to probe biochemical mechanisms or network connectivity.

In all but the simplest cases, the mathematical equations that form the basis of a model cannot be solved exactly. Nevertheless, computer technology, sometimes in the form of specialized software or hardware architectures, allow scientists to perform iterative calculations and search for plausible solutions. A computer chip or a robot that can interact with the natural environment in ways akin to the original organism is one embodiment of a useful model. The ultimate measure of success is however the ability to make testable predictions.

==General criteria for evaluating models==

===Speed of information processing===
The rate of information processing in biological neural systems are constrained by the speed at which an action potential can propagate down a nerve fibre. This conduction velocity ranges from 1&amp;nbsp;m/s to over 100&amp;nbsp;m/s, and generally increases with the diameter of the neuronal process. Slow in the timescales of biologically-relevant events dictated by the speed of sound or the force of gravity, the nervous system overwhelmingly prefers parallel computations over serial ones in time-critical applications.

===Robustness===
A model is robust if it continues to produce the same computational results under variations in inputs or operating parameters introduced by noise. For example, the direction of motion as computed by a robust [[motion perception|motion detector]] would not change under small changes of [[luminance]], [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] or velocity jitter.

===Gain control===
This refers to the principle that the response of a nervous system should stay within certain bounds even as the inputs from the environment change drastically. For example, when adjusting between a sunny day and a moonless night, the retina changes the relationship between light level and neuronal output by a factor of more than &lt;math&gt;10^6&lt;/math&gt;  so that the signals sent to later stages of
the visual system always remain within a much narrower range of amplitudes.&lt;ref name=Ferster&gt;{{cite news

===Linearity versus nonlinearity===
A '''linear''' system is one whose response in a specified unit of measure, to a set of inputs considered at once, is the sum of its responses due to the inputs considered individually.

[[Linear algebra|Linear]] systems are easier to analyze mathematically and are a persuasive assumption in many models including the McCulloch and Pitts neuron, population coding models, and the simple neurons often used in [[Artificial neural network]]s. Linearity may occur in the basic elements of a neural circuit such as the response of a postsynaptic neuron, or as an emergent property of a combination of nonlinear subcircuits.&lt;ref name="MolnarHsueh2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Molnar|first1=Alyosha|last2=Hsueh|first2=Hain-Ann|last3=Roska|first3=Botond|last4=Werblin|first4=Frank S.|title=Crossover inhibition in the retina: circuitry that compensates for nonlinear rectifying synaptic transmission|journal=Journal of Computational Neuroscience|volume=27|issue=3|year=2009|pages=569–590|issn=0929-5313|doi=10.1007/s10827-009-0170-6 | pmid = 19636690|pmc=2766457}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though linearity is often seen as incorrect, there has been recent work suggesting it may, in fact, be biophysically plausible in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singh|first=Chandan|last2=Levy|first2=William B.|date=2017-07-13|title=A consensus layer V pyramidal neuron can sustain interpulse-interval coding|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0180839|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=12|issue=7|pages=e0180839|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0180839|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cash|first=Sydney|last2=Yuste|first2=Rafael|date=1998-01-01|title=Input Summation by Cultured Pyramidal Neurons Is Linear and Position-Independent|url=http://www.jneurosci.org/content/18/1/10|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|language=en|volume=18|issue=1|pages=10–15|issn=0270-6474|pmid=9412481}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

A computational neural model may be constrained to the level of biochemical signalling in individual [[neurons]] or it may describe an entire organism in its environment. The examples here are grouped according to their scope.

===Models of information transfer in neurons===
{{main|biological neuron model}}
The most widely used models of information transfer in biological neurons are based on analogies with electrical circuits. The equations to be solved are time-dependent differential equations with electro-dynamical variables such as current, conductance or resistance, capacitance and voltage.

====Hodgkin–Huxley model and its derivatives====
{{main|Hodgkin–Huxley model}}
The Hodgkin–Huxley model, widely regarded as one of the great achievements of 20th-century biophysics, describes how [[action potential]]s in neurons are initiated and propagated in axons via [[voltage-gated ion channel]]s. It is a set of [[nonlinearity|nonlinear]] [[ordinary differential equation]]s that were introduced by [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin]] and [[Andrew Huxley]] in 1952 to explain the results of [[voltage clamp]] experiments on the [[squid giant axon]]. Analytic solutions do not exist, but the [[Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm]], a modified [[Gauss–Newton algorithm]], is often used to [[curve fitting|fit]] these equations to voltage-clamp data.

The [[FitzHugh–Nagumo model]] is a simplication of the Hodgkin–Huxley model. The [[Hindmarsh–Rose model]] is an extension which describes neuronal spike bursts. The Morris–Lecar model is a modification which does not generate spikes, but describes slow-wave propagation, which is implicated in the inhibitory synaptic mechanisms of [[central pattern generator]]s.

====Solitons====
{{main|Soliton model in neuroscience}}
{{Empty section|date=January 2011}}

====Transfer functions and linear filters====
This approach, influenced by [[control theory]] and [[signal processing]], treats neurons and synapses as time-invariant entities that produce outputs that are [[LTI System Theory|linear combinations]] of input signals, often depicted as sine waves with a well-defined temporal or spatial frequencies.

The entire behavior of a neuron or synapse are encoded in a [[transfer function]], lack of knowledge concerning the exact underlying mechanism notwithstanding. This brings a highly developed mathematics to bear on the problem of information transfer.

The accompanying taxonomy of [[linear filter]]s turns out to be useful in characterizing neural circuitry. Both [[low-pass filter|low-]] and [[high-pass filter]]s are postulated to exist in some form in sensory systems, as they act to prevent information loss in high and low contrast environments, respectively.

Indeed, measurements of the transfer functions of neurons in the [[horseshoe crab]] retina according to linear systems analysis show that they remove short-term fluctuations in input signals leaving only the long-term trends, in the manner of low-pass filters.  These animals are unable to see low-contrast objects without the help of optical distortions caused by underwater currents.&lt;ref name=barlow1993&gt;{{cite journal

===Models of computations in sensory systems ===

====Lateral inhibition in the retina: Hartline–Ratliff equations====
In the retina, an excited neural receptor can suppress the activity of surrounding neurons within an area called the inhibitory field. This effect, known as [[lateral inhibition]], increases the contrast and sharpness in visual response, but leads to the epiphenomenon of [[Mach bands]]. This is often illustrated by the [[illusion|optical illusion]] of light or dark stripes next to a sharp boundary between two regions in an image of different luminance.

The Hartline-Ratliff model describes interactions within a group of ''p'' [[photoreceptor cell]]s.&lt;ref name=kuhnhadeler&gt;{{cite journal
 | doi = 10.1007/BF00319520
 | title = Stationary States of the Hartline–Ratliff Model
 |author1=K. P. Hadeler  |author2=D. Kuhn
  |lastauthoramp=yes | journal = Biological Cybernetics
 | year = 1987
 | volume = 56
 | pages = 411–417
 | issue = 5–6
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming these interactions to be '''linear''', they proposed the following relationship for the '''steady-state response rate''' &lt;math&gt;r_p&lt;/math&gt; of the given ''p''-th photoreceptor in terms of the steady-state response rates &lt;math&gt;r_j&lt;/math&gt; of the ''j'' surrounding receptors:

&lt;math&gt;r_{p}=\left|\left[e_{p}-\sum_{j=1,j\ne p}^{n}k_{pj}\left|r_{j}-r_{pj}^{o}\right|\right]\right|&lt;/math&gt;.

Here,

&lt;math&gt;e_p&lt;/math&gt; is the excitation of the target ''p''-th receptor from sensory transduction

&lt;math&gt;r_{pj}^o&lt;/math&gt; is the associated threshold of the firing cell, and

&lt;math&gt;k_{pj}&lt;/math&gt; is the coefficient of inhibitory interaction between the ''p''-th and the ''j''th receptor. The inhibitory interaction decreases with distance from the target ''p''-th receptor.

====Cross-correlation in sound localization: Jeffress model====
According to [[Lloyd A. Jeffress|Jeffress]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jeffress | first1 = L.A. | year = 1948 | title = A place theory of sound localization | url = | journal = Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 35–39 | doi=10.1037/h0061495 | pmid=18904764}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to compute the location of a sound source in space from [[interaural time difference]]s, an auditory system relies on [[Analog delay line|delay lines]]: the induced signal from an [[ipsilateral]] auditory receptor to a particular neuron is delayed for the same time as it takes for the original sound to go in space from that ear to the other.  Each postsynaptic cell is differently delayed and thus specific for a particular inter-aural time difference. This theory is equivalent to the mathematical procedure of [[cross-correlation]].

Following Fischer and Anderson,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fischer | first1 = Brian J. | last2 = Anderson | first2 = Charles H. | year = 2004 | title = A computational model of sound localization in the barn owl | url = | journal = Neurocomputing | volume = 58–60 | issue = | pages = 1007–1012 | doi=10.1016/j.neucom.2004.01.159}}&lt;/ref&gt; the response of the postsynaptic neuron to the signals from the left and right ears is given by

&lt;math&gt;y_{R}\left(t\right) - y_{L}\left(t\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt;y_{L}\left(t\right)=\int_{0}^{\tau}u_{L}\left(\sigma\right)w\left(t-\sigma\right)d\sigma&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y_{R}\left(t\right)=\int_{0}^{\tau}u_{R}\left(\sigma\right)w\left(t-\sigma\right)d\sigma&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;w\left(t-\sigma\right)&lt;/math&gt; represents the delay function. This is not entirely correct and a clear eye is needed to put the symbols in order.

Structures have been located in the barn owl which are consistent with Jeffress-type mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine E. Carr, 1993. Delay Line Models of Sound Localization in the Barn Owl "American Zoologist" Vol. 33, No. 1 79–85&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cross-correlation for motion detection: Hassenstein–Reichardt model====
A motion detector needs to satisfy three general requirements: pair-inputs, asymmetry and nonlinearity.&lt;ref&gt;Borst A, Egelhaaf M., 1989. Principles of visual motion detection. "Trends in Neurosciences"  12(8):297–306&lt;/ref&gt; The cross-correlation operation implemented asymmetrically on the responses from a pair of photoreceptors satisfies these minimal criteria, and furthermore, predicts features which have been observed in the response of neurons of the lobula plate in bi-wing insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Joesch | first1 = M. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2008 | title = Response properties of motion-sensitive visual interneurons in the lobula plate of Drosophila melanogaster | url = | journal = Curr. Biol. | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 368–374 | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2008.02.022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The master equation for response is

&lt;math&gt;R = A_1(t-\tau)B_2(t) - A_2(t - \tau)B_1(t)&lt;/math&gt;

The HR model predicts a peaking of the response at a particular input temporal frequency. The conceptually similar Barlow–Levick model is deficient in the sense that a stimulus presented to only one receptor of the pair is sufficient to generate a response. This is unlike the HR model, which requires two correlated signals delivered in a time ordered fashion. However the HR model does not show a saturation of response at high contrasts, which is observed in experiment. Extensions of the Barlow-Levick model can provide for this discrepancy.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalo G. de Polavieja, 2006. Neuronal Algorithms That Detect the Temporal Order of Events "Neural Computation" 18 (2006) 2102–2121&lt;/ref&gt;

====Watson–Ahumada model for motion estimation in humans====
This uses a cross-correlation in both the spatial and temporal directions, and is related to the concept of [[optical flow]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew B. Watson and Albert J. Ahumada, Jr., 1985. Model of human visual-motion sensing "J. Opt. Soc. Am. A" 2(2) 322–341&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurophysiological metronomes: neural circuits for pattern generation===
Mutually [[inhibitory]] processes are a unifying motif of all [[central pattern generator]]s. This has been demonstrated in the stomatogastric  (STG)  nervous system of crayfish and lobsters.&lt;ref&gt;Michael P. Nusbaum and Mark P. Beenhakker, A small-systems approach to motor pattern generation, Nature 417, 343–350 (16 May 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Two and three-cell oscillating networks based on the STG have been constructed which are amenable to mathematical analysis, and which depend in a simple way on synaptic strengths and overall activity, presumably the knobs on these things.&lt;ref&gt;Cristina Soto-Treviño, Kurt A. Thoroughman and Eve Marder, L. F. Abbott, 2006. Activity-dependent modification of inhibitory synapses in models of rhythmic neural networks Nature Vol 4 No 3 2102–2121&lt;/ref&gt; The mathematics involved is the theory of [[dynamical systems]].

===Feedback and control: models of flight control in the fly===
Flight control in the fly is believed to be mediated by inputs from the visual system and also the [[halteres]], a pair of knob-like organs which measure angular velocity. Integrated computer models of ''[[Drosophila]]'', short on neuronal circuitry but based on the general guidelines given by [[control theory]] and data from the tethered flights of flies, have been constructed to investigate the details of flight control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://strawlab.org/2011/03/23/grand-unified-fly/|title=the Grand Unified Fly (GUF) model|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mendeley.com/download/public/2464051/3652638122/d3bd7957efd2c8a011afb0687dfb6943731cb6d0/dl.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software modelling approaches and tools==

===Neural networks===
{{main|neural network}}
In this approach the strength and type, excitatory or inhibitory, of synaptic connections are represented by the magnitude and sign of weights, that is, numerical [[coefficients]] &lt;math&gt;w'&lt;/math&gt; in front of the inputs &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to a particular neuron. The response of the &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;-th neuron is given by a sum of nonlinear, usually "[[sigmoid function|sigmoidal]]" functions &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; of the inputs as:

&lt;math&gt;f_{j}=\sum_{i}g\left(w_{ji}'x_{i}+b_{j}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

This response is then fed as input into other neurons and so on. The goal is to optimize the weights of the neurons to output a desired response at the output layer respective to a set given inputs at the input layer. This optimization of the neuron weights is often performed using the [[Backpropagation| backpropagation algorithm]] and an optimization method such as [[gradient descent]] or [[Newton's method| Newton's method of optimization]]. Backpropagation compares the output of the network with the expected output from the training data, then updates the weights of each neuron to minimize the contribution of that individual neuron to the total error of the network.

===Genetic algorithms===
[[Genetic algorithms]] are used to evolve neural (and sometimes body) properties in a model brain-body-environment system so as to exhibit some desired behavioral performance. The evolved agents can then be subjected to a detailed analysis to uncover their principles of operation. Evolutionary approaches are particularly useful for exploring spaces of possible solutions to a given behavioral task because these approaches minimize a priori assumptions about how a given behavior ought to be instantiated. They can also be useful for exploring different ways to complete a computational neuroethology model when only partial neural circuitry is available for a biological system of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Computational_neuroethology|title=Computational neuroethology|first1=Randall|last1=Beer|first2=Hillel|last2=Chiel|date=4 March 2008|publisher=|volume=3|issue=3|doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.5307|journal=Scholarpedia|pages=5307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NEURON===
The [[Neuron (software)|NEURON]] software, developed at Duke University, is a simulation environment for modeling individual neurons and networks of neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/|title=NEURON - for empirically-based simulations of neurons and networks of neurons|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NEURON environment is a self-contained environment allowing interface through its [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] or via scripting with [[hoc (programming language)|hoc]] or [[Python (programming language)|python]]. The NEURON simulation engine is based on a Hodgkin–Huxley type model using a Borg–Graham formulation. Several examples of models written in NEURON are available from the online database ModelDB.&lt;ref&gt;McDougal RA, Morse TM, Carnevale T, Marenco L, Wang R, Migliore M, Miller PL, Shepherd GM, Hines ML.

==Embodiment in electronic hardware==

===Conductance-based silicon neurons===
Nervous systems differ from the majority of silicon-based computing devices in that they resemble [[analog computer]]s (not [[digital data]] processors) and massively [[parallel computing|parallel]] processors, not [[von Neumann architecture|sequential]] processors. To model nervous systems accurately, in real-time, alternative hardware is required.

The most realistic circuits to date make use of [[analogue electronics|analog]] properties of existing [[digital electronics]] (operated under non-standard conditions) to realize Hodgkin–Huxley-type models ''in silico''.&lt;ref&gt;L.

"'''Mortal Coil'''" is the twelfth episode of the [[Star Trek: Voyager (season 4)|fourth season]] of the American [[Science fiction on television|science fiction television]] series ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', the 80th episode overall. The episode originally aired on December 17, 1997, on the [[UPN]] network. Directed by [[Allan Kroeker]], it was written by [[Bryan Fuller]], and produced by [[Kenneth Biller]] and [[Joe Menosky]].

Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the [[Starfleet]] and [[Maquis (Star Trek)|Maquis]] crew of the starship [[USS Voyager (Star Trek)|USS ''Voyager'']] after they were stranded in the [[Delta Quadrant]] far from the rest of the [[Federation (Star Trek)|Federation]]. In this episode, it deals with a starring character's death, resurrection, and crisis of faith.

==Plot==
[[Neelix]]  is killed while participating in a survey mission of a protomatter [[nebula]]. Using a technique devised by [[Seven of Nine]] , however, the [[Doctor (Star Trek)|Doctor]]  is able to revive Neelix after being dead for nearly 19 hours. Distressed that he had not perceived the [[afterlife]] while he was dead, Neelix begins to question his [[religion|religious beliefs]]. With the aid of [[Chakotay]], Neelix embarks on a [[spirit]]ual [[vision quest]], during which he confronts his dead sister, Alixia, who mocks him and then dies and crumbles into dust. He then finds himself on a slab, surrounded by visions of his shipmates, who tell him that life is irrelevant and that he knows what he has to do.

Convinced that his existence is meaningless and that his life has no purpose, Neelix decides to commit [[suicide]] by [[Transporter (Star Trek)|transporting]] himself into the nebula. Despite the attempts of his shipmates, Neelix prepares to beam off until [[Starfleet ranks and insignia#The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, and Voyager|Ensign]] [[Samantha Wildman]] arrives to ask Neelix if he could console [[Naomi Wildman|Naomi]], who believes she saw a [[monster]] in the [[Replicator (Star Trek)|replicator]] and who will only allow Neelix to tuck her in. Realizing that he does, indeed, have purpose in his life, Neelix relents and heads for the Wildmans' quarters. Once there, Naomi, who had heard that Neelix was sick, wonders if a monster had got him. "Yes", Neelix replies, "But I chased him away."&lt;ref name="VOY Companion"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ruditis |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Ruditis |title=Star Trek Voyager Companion |year=2003 |publisher=[[Pocket Books]] |location=New York |isbn=0-7434-1751-8| pages=217–219 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theme===
In this episode, Neelix's religious faith is seriously challenged; he eventually chooses to live without it. [[Chakotay]] serves as a counterpoint to his perspective, encouraging Neelix not to abandon all faith. In ''Star Trek: The Human Frontier'', Michèle and [[Duncan Barrett]] discuss this episode as an example of Star Trek's shifting attitudes towards religion, specifically ''Voyager''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s treatment of religious faith and how it can change. The Barretts contrast this episode with "[[Sacred Ground (Star Trek: Voyager)|Sacred Ground]]," in which the rationalist [[Kathryn Janeway|Captain Janeway]] ([[Kate Mulgrew]]) is forced to accept the possibility of forces outside rational explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Barrett |first=Michèle |author2=Duncan Barrett |title=Star Trek: The Human Frontier |year=2000 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=New York |isbn= 0-415-92982-2 |pages=148–149 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both episodes are considered as illustrations of how "Star Trek articulates the conflicts between religion and science that continue to recur in modern western thought."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Barrett |first=Michèle |author2=Duncan Barrett |title=Star Trek: The Human Frontier |year=2000 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=New York |isbn= 0-415-92982-2 |page=145 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[File:Ethan Phillips.jpg|thumb|Ethan Phillips portrayed Neelix, resurrected protagonist]]
[[Ethan Phillips]], who plays [[Neelix]], said he felt the episode was the most rewarding of the show for him, and that it was one of his favorites. "I thought that was a beautiful show," he said, "It was very existential [...] and very well directed by [[Allan Kroeker]]."&lt;ref name="STC20010201"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/community/chat/archive/transcript/1240.html|title = Community :: Chat :: Transcript Archive :: Ethan Phillips ("Neelix" - VOY)|date= 2001-02-01|accessdate = 2007-07-25|work = STARTREK.COM|publisher = [[CBS Paramount Television]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mortal Error: The Shot That Killed JFK''''' is a 1992 non-fiction book by Bonar Menninger outlining a theory by [[sharpshooter]], [[gunsmith]] and [[ballistics]] expert Howard Donahue that a [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent accidentally fired the shot that actually killed President [[John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref name=star&gt;{{cite news|title=Mortal error?

==Background and Overview==
[[File:Hickey-ar-15 jfk.jpg|thumb| Photo showing driver Agent George Hickey shortly after JFK was killed holding the [[Colt AR-15|AR-15]] rifle that accidental shooting theorists say killed Kennedy.]]

Donahue first became interested in the story of the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] after participating in a re-creation of the shooting as one of eleven invited marksmen and sharpshooters.&lt;ref name="Hunter"/&gt; He demonstrated that it would have been possible for [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] to have fired three shots in the time specified by the [[Warren Commission]], and was the only one of the eleven to better the 5.6-second window. However the experience highlighted to Donahue other concerns regarding the Warren report, and in particular the fact that the testimony of [[ballistics]] experts seemed to have been completely omitted from the Commission's evidence gathering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Burnes|first=Brian|title=Another JFK theory: An accident Kansas City man's book says fatal bullet was fired by a Secret Service agent.|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=KC&amp;p_theme=kc&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EAF3D760E529E06&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|accessdate=August 5, 2012|newspaper=[[Kansas City Star]]|date=February 21, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conducting his own investigation, Donahue eventually decided that the bullet that struck Kennedy in the head had in fact been fired by [[United States Secret Service]] Special Agent George Warren Hickey Jr. (March 24, 1923 to February 25, 2005) from an [[AR-15]] rifle carried in the car immediately following the President's vehicle. The series of events is as follows: After the first shot which hit the street was fired, Hickey turns completely around and acquires Oswald on the sixth floor of the school book depository building. His turned head is documented in an AP photograph by [[James Altgens]]. Hickey reaches for the AR-15 under the seat, releases the safety and begins to lift the gun. The second shot is fired by Oswald, hitting the president and Texas Governor [[John Connally]]. The president's car and the follow-up car containing Hickey suddenly speed up. This is attested to by [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent [[Clint Hill (Secret Service)|Clint Hill]]. Agent Hickey, who is unstable because he is standing on the cushion of the seat, rather than the floor of the car, begins to fall back due to the acceleration of the vehicle, pulling the trigger of the AR-15. The gun is pointed toward Kennedy at that instant, and the bullet strikes him squarely in the back of the head.

In parallel, he believes Oswald's second shot through Kennedy's neck may have already critically wounded the president before the third shot was fired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Agent's Error Killed Kennedy, Book Says|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SL&amp;p_theme=sl&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB04D90B1E2B874&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|accessdate=August 5, 2012|newspaper=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]|date=February 23, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Donahue was encouraged in his investigations by Ralph Reppert, a reporter for the ''[[Baltimore Sun]]''. In 1977, Reppert published Donahue's theory in two articles, which appeared on Sunday, May 1, and the following Sunday, with the second article accompanied by an editorial. These two men were keen to collaborate on a book on the subject,&lt;ref name=reppert1&gt;''...Reppert and Donahue agreed the next logical step would be to write a book. (Mortal Error 1992 paperback edition p. 121)&lt;/ref&gt; but this was cut short by Reppert's ill health and subsequent death.&lt;ref name=reppert2&gt;''In theory, at least, there was still the prospect of the book in collaboration with Reppert. In those heady days following the publication of the Sun article, both men had been in full, excited agreement that a book would be the next logical step.'' (Mortal Error 1992 paperback edition p. 188)&lt;/ref&gt; Donahue later also approached author [[John H. Davis (author)|John Davis]] in the hope that a book would still be written.&lt;ref name=davis&gt;''Much to Howard's delight, Davis said he was very interested in the theory and the possibility of doing a book.'' (Mortal Error 1992 paperback edition p. 211)&lt;/ref&gt; The original copyright of Mortal Error read "Copyright 1992 Bonar Menninger and Howard Donahue"&lt;ref&gt;Mortal Error 1992 paperback edition [[Book design#Front cover, spine, and back cover of the dust-jacket|flyleaf]]&lt;/ref&gt; but some later editions did not mention Donahue's copyright. The ''Acknowledgements'' section (dated January 21, 1992) begins "Special thanks to Nick Beltrante for a great news tip, the late Ralph Reppert for showing the way, Howard and Katie Donahue for casting their lot with me...".&lt;ref name=BM/&gt;

Donahue's reconstruction of the trajectories of the shots that struck Kennedy and Governor Connally supported the [[single-bullet theory]] for the second shot. Donahue decided that the impossible trajectory suggested by the Warren Commission was only necessary because there was an error in their positioning of Connally. He also concluded that this was Oswald's second shot, the first having missed owing to the misalignment of the rifle's telescopic sight but with a ricochet fragment slightly wounding Kennedy, and that Oswald had not fired a third shot, the third cartridge case found at the scene having been a slightly bent and empty one kept in the rifle's chamber.&lt;ref name=BM&gt;''Mortal Error'', {{ISBN|0-283-06136-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither Donahue nor Menninger commented on whether the Warren Commission's key finding, that Oswald acted alone, was correct or not. Menninger notes that the theory is consistent with Oswald being involved in a conspiracy.&lt;ref name=p146&gt;p. 146 ''Of course, Donahue's understanding of the fatal shot in no way precluded the possibility that Oswald was involved in some kind of conspiracy.''&lt;/ref&gt; The term "cover-up" is mentioned in the book, rather than ''conspiracy''.

{{Wikiquote|Mortal Error}}

==Synopsis==
The book takes the overall form of a [[narrative]], in which Menninger describes Donahue's enquiries over twenty-five years.

Chapter 1, ''A Chance Telephone Call'', describes the events that led to Donahue's interest in the assassination, and a brief biography up until that point.

Chapters 2 and 3, ''The Warren Report'' and ''The Critics'', then give the context and summary of the [[Warren Report|report]], and a detailed summary of its critics as of 1968.

Chapter 4, ''The Single Bullet Theory'' presents Donahue's analysis of the shot which, according to the Warren Commission, struck both Kennedy and [[John Connally|Connally]], and suggests that the "[[Single-bullet theory|magic bullet]]" trajectory is only necessary because the estimated position of the Governor was wrong. One of Oswald's shots could therefore have caused both men's injuries as claimed, but there remain other unanswered questions.

Chapter 5, ''The Head Shot'' describes Donahue's analysis of the shot that hit Kennedy in the head, using the Warren Commission evidence (particularly the official [[John F. Kennedy autopsy|autopsy report]]), stills from the [[Zapruder film]] and other photos, and holes drilled in a plaster skull. Numerous questions arise surrounding the completeness and even accuracy of the autopsy report.

{{quote|...two crippling problems with the government's claim that Lee Harvey Oswald fired the shot that hit Kennedy in the head: 1) the apparent trajectory of the bullet did not seem to match the location of Oswald's sniper's nest, and 2) the type of bullet fired was totally at odds with the rounds that Oswald was known to have used. (p. 56)}}

Chapter 6, ''A Fortuitous Encounter'', describes Donahue's first correspondence with the Secret Service, and reviews the conclusions that led to his approaching them.

{{quote|In just eight months, working on weekends and evenings in his cluttered basement den, he had been able to construct a rebuttal to the critics of the Commission's single bullet theory that effectively destroyed their principal arguments. More important, he was sure he'd identified two serious flaws in the Government's explanation of the head wound, flaws those same critics has (sic) missed entirely. (p. 57)}}

He then by chance meets Dr. [[Russell Fisher]], who led the [[Clark Panel]] which reviewed the autopsy in 1968, and who provides a copy of its report and many insights into details of the autopsy report and problems with the material provided to the panel. The suspicion of an accidental discharge by a Secret Service agent grows.

{{quote|Well, you know more about guns than I do," he said. "But that would certainly explain the strange antics of the government." (p. 65)}}

Chapter 7, ''Kennedy's Unknown Wound'', describes Donahue's conclusion that Kennedy suffered a scalp wound from a ricochet fragment from Oswald's first shot, using the material provided by Fisher. This resolves some problems with the timing of the reactions of Kennedy and Connally.

Chapter 8, ''Murphy's Law'', resumes the story of Donahue's career as his expertise and reputation as an expert witness grows.

Chapter 9, ''The Discovery'', describes more of Donahue's career, and his discovery of a photo showing a Secret Service agent holding a weapon that could have produced the kind of wound Kennedy suffered (the photo eventually used on the cover of the book). This revives his interest in publishing an article on his findings.

{{quote|Howard here. You're not going to believe this, and God help me if I'm wrong, but I think we can do the story. I found the gun. (p. 108)}}

Chapter 10, ''Breaking News'', describes the first publication of Donahue's conclusions in articles by Ralph Reppert, and attempts to contact Hickey. Questions are asked regarding the nature of the cover-up, and particularly about whether Robert Kennedy was involved in it.

Chapters 11 to 13 describe Donahue's experiences with the [[United States House Select Committee on Assassinations]].

{{quote|Obviously, they had no intention of examining the evidence Howard had assembled. (p. 157)}}

{{quote|Rose informed Donahue that he'd travel extensively around the country to interview a number of Secret Service agents and police officers about what happened in Dallas. "So, did you interview Hickey?" Donahue asked. "He was right there in Washington." "No, I did not," Rose replied. "Why not?" Donahue asked. "I really don't know," Rose said finally. (pp. 186–187, describing a conversation that took place in 1983)}}

Chapter 14, ''The AR-15'', describes the ill health and death of Reppert, the reporter who wrote the articles that broke the story, which ends their proposed collaboration on a book on Donahue's theory and puts the book proposal on hold. The story of the AR-15 is told, with comparisons to the M-1, AK-47, M-14 and M-16, and some very critical assessments of the adoption of the M-14 and M-16.

{{quote|Do you know what killed most of us? Our own rifles... (p. 196)}}

Chapter 15, ''The Final Breakthrough'', presents more ballistics, especially estimating the size of the head shot entry wound and its relevance. [[John H. Davis (author)|John Davis]], another possible author for the book, is contacted and is at first enthusiastic. Howard gives up his Masters studies in forensics but becomes increasingly employed as an expert witness despite this.

{{quote|...the bullet that struck Kennedy's neck had cracked one of his vertebrae... if Kennedy would have survived the trauma at all&amp;nbsp;– something Lattimer doubted&amp;nbsp;– it probably would have been only as a vegetable quadriplegic. (p. 199)}}

Chapter 16, ''Hope Dies Hard'', gives a brief history of the Secret Service, their nightmare assignment guarding Kennedy, and their reaction to the shooting. There follows Hickey's involvement in the Warren Commission and statements by him and other agents. Donahue's conversation with one notable conspiracy theorist is also described.

Chapter 17, ''Today'', is a recap as of spring 1991, describing reactions from Secret Service agents and others to the theory, and more attempts to contact Hickey.

{{quote|I do not believe that George Hickey is to blame for what happened. He was a brave man trying to do his job. (p. 237, Donahue speaking)}}

An afterword headed ''Note from the Publisher'' describes more attempts to contact Hickey, and to discuss the theory with the Secret Service and others, and why the decision to publish the book was taken.

There are several appendices:
* Appendix A: Testimony and Written Statements by Secret Service Agents Regarding Events of November 22, 1963

* Appendix C: Excerpts from Interviews Conducted by the House Select Committee on Assassinations with Drs. Humes, Petty, Angel, Baden, Boxwell, and Loquvam
* Appendix D: Trajectory Analysis from the House Select Committee on Assassinations Hearings

Finally, there are chapter by chapter [[endnote]]s giving sources and their bibliographic details,&lt;ref&gt;pp. 335–350&lt;/ref&gt; and an index.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 351–361&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Reaction to ''Mortal Error'' has been mixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bready|first=James|title=The 'JFK' theory that's too simple for Americans to believe|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1992-02-27/news/1992058163_1_donahue-high-treason-mortal-error|accessdate=August 5, 2012|newspaper=[[Baltimore Sun]]|date=February 27, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Balducki of the [[Associated Press]] cited that Donahue's "scrupulousness" made his theory of the JFK assassination plausible.&lt;ref name="Balducki 1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Balducki|first=James|title=New JFK assassination book just another theory|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XnJiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=G3cNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1125%2C1346946|accessdate=August 5, 2012|newspaper=Observer-Reporter|date=June 7, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balducki praised the book, saying "Menninger interprets the story with a sharpness and fluidity that never unravels amid the surge of detail".&lt;ref name="Balducki 1"/&gt; [[David Pietrusza]] called Donahue's theory unusual due to him not tying the assassination to Mafia, CIA, or FBI, but that there were "still problems with Donahue's theory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pietrusza|first=David|title=Mysterious Deaths&amp;nbsp;— John F.

Pre-publication orders topped 100,000,&lt;ref  name=star/&gt; but the book caused little impact at the time. Menninger commented in 2013 that this might be because Donahue's theory was "equally disliked by both conspiracy theorists and supporters of the Warren Commission."&lt;ref name=conspiracy&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sanfordherald.com/x2082482323/TAKE-5-Author-Accidental-shot-killed-JFK |title=TAKE 5: Author: Accidental shot killed JFK |date=November 15, 2013 |newspaper=Sanford Herald |accessdate=December 2, 2013 |quote=[the theory was] equally disliked by both conspiracy theorists and supporters of the Warren Commission.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Howard Donahue died in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/tv/jfk-the-smoking-gun-review-conspiracy-theory-documentary-feels-recycled-1.6349099 |accessdate=November 30, 2013 |title='JFK, The Smoking Gun' review: Conspiracy theory documentary feels recycled |date=October 31, 2013 |first=Verne |last=Gay |newspaper=Newsday }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1999-12-21/news/9912210051_1_donahue-ballistics-expert-warren-commission |accessdate=November 30, 2013 |date=December 21, 1999 |title=Howard C. H. Donahue, 77, ballistics expert, studied Kennedy's death |newspaper=Baltimore Sun |first=Frederick N. |last=Rasmussen }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Smoking Gun'' documentary, his daughter Colleen Donahue Lorenzen remembers her father being surprised that his work aroused so little interest.

At the time of his death, Donahue was working on another book on the same topic.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1999-12-21/news/9912210051_1_donahue-ballistics-expert-warren-commission retrieved 16 December 2013 ''According to his daughter, Colleen Donahue Lorenzen of Riderwood, Mr. Donahue was working on a related book at his death. "He had discovered a TV tape in a German archive that showed the assassination from a different angle as well as a Secret Service agent standing up in a car."''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Australian journalist and former police detective Colin McLaren published a book and documentary both titled ''[[JFK: The Smoking Gun]]'', examining and supporting Donahue's theory.

===Lawsuit===
Prior to the publication of the book in 1992, both the publisher and the author contacted Hickey to invite his participation in the book and offering him a chance to respond to the allegations.  In 1995 Hickey sued [[St. Martin's Press]] over the claims made in ''Mortal Error''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Suit Filed over JFK Book|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KilUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=K44DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1168%2C1925936|accessdate=August 5, 2012|newspaper=The News|date=August 23, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=JFK killing theory on trial for libel|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cqgyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=O-cFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3631,4306584&amp;dq=mortal-error-the-shot-that-killed-jfk&amp;hl=en|accessdate=5 August 2012|newspaper=[[Lawrence Journal-World]]|date=August 23, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suit was eventually dismissed in 1997 on the grounds that Hickey had waited too long after the book's initial publication to file against the publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Brien|first=Dennis|title=Defamation suit involving book on JFK dismissed Judge notes time limit|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1997-09-30/news/1997273060_1_hickey-defamation-mortal-error|accessdate=August 5, 2012|newspaper=Baltimore Sun|date=September 30, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hickey refiled suit when the paper-back edition was published, and later settled with St Martin's Press in 1998 on undisclosed terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Retired agent paid undisclosed amount in JFK shooting case|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dUsxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gOYFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4654%2C213971|accessdate=August 5, 2012|newspaper=[[Gettysburg Times]]|date=February 4, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Natalya Alyakina-Mroszek''' (ca. 1955–17 June 1995), often transliterated as Natalia, was a Russian broadcast journalist, who was working for the German radio news agency Rufa Rundfunk-Agenturdienste  and ''[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]]'' magazine, in [[Budyonnovsk]], [[Russia]] when she was killed during the [[First Chechen War]].&lt;ref name=probe&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/journalists-husband-slams-official-probe/337393.html |title=Journalist's Husband Slams Official 'Probe' &amp;#124; News |publisher=Themoscowtimes.com |date=1995-07-06 |accessdate=2015-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CPJAttacks&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpj.org/attacks95/att95europe.html |title=Attacks on the Press in 1995 |publisher=Cpj.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journalists-in-russia.org/journalists/view/66|title=Journalists in Russia, Alyakina|publisher=Journalists-in-russia.org|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ifex&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ifex.org/russia/1996/07/17/soldier_who_shot_russian_journalist/ |title=Soldier who shot Russian journalist given suspended sentence |publisher=Ifex.org |date= |accessdate=2015-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal details==
Natalya Alyakina-Mroszek was 40 years old when she was killed. She was married to Gisbert Mrozek, sometimes spelled Gizbert, who was also a working journalist for Rufa.&lt;ref name=moscowtimes&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/russian-troops-shoot-journalist-dead/338139.html |title=Russian Troops Shoot Journalist Dead &amp;#124; News |publisher=Themoscowtimes.com |date=1995-06-20 |accessdate=2015-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
While passing through an Army checkpoint in route to cover a mass hostage situation on July 29, 1994, Natalya Alyakina-Mroszek and the driver of the car were shot at by a Russian soldier.

'''Nonviolent Communication''' (abbreviated '''NVC''', also called '''Compassionate Communication''' or '''Collaborative Communication'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Center for Collaborative Communication|url=http://www.collaborative-communication.org/|accessdate=Nov 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Branscomb"/&gt;) is an approach to nonviolent living developed by [[Marshall Rosenberg]] beginning in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Gear"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Gates | first1=Bob | last2=Gear | first2=Jane | last3=Wray |first3=Jane | title = Behavioural Distress: Concepts &amp; Strategies | publisher = Bailliere Tindall |year=2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the idea that all human beings have the capacity for compassion and only resort to violence or behavior that harms themselves and others when they do not recognize more effective strategies for meeting needs.&lt;ref name="KashtanAssump"&gt;Inbal Kashtan, Miki Kashtan, [http://baynvc.org/key-assumptions-and-intentions-of-nvc/ Key Assumptions and Intentions of NVC], BayNVC.org&lt;/ref&gt; Habits of thinking and speaking that lead to the use of violence (social, psychological and physical) are learned through culture. NVC theory supposes all human behavior stems from attempts to meet [[Fundamental human needs|universal human needs]] and that these [[need]]s are never in conflict. Rather, conflict arises when strategies for meeting needs clash. NVC proposes that people identify shared needs, revealed by the thoughts and feelings that surround these needs, and collaborate to develop strategies that meet them. This creates both harmony and learning for future cooperation.&lt;ref name=Fullerton&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.gtcs.org.uk/nmsruntime/saveasdialog.aspx?lID=230&amp;sID=6450 |title=The development of "Nonviolent Communication" in an early years setting to support conflict resolution and develop an emotional intelligence related to both self and others. |last=Fullerton |first=Elaine |journal=Behaviour4Learning |publisher=GTC Scotland |date=February 2009 |accessdate=Sep 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NVC supports change on three interconnected levels: with self, with others, and with groups and social systems. As such it is particularly present in the areas of personal development, relationships, and social change. NVC is ostensibly taught as a process of interpersonal communication designed to improve compassionate connection to others. However, due to its far-reaching impact it has also been interpreted as a spiritual practice, a set of values, a parenting technique, a method of social change, a mediation tool, an educational orientation, and a worldview.

Rosenberg related ways he used Nonviolent Communication in peace programs in conflict zones including [[Rwanda]], [[Burundi]], [[Nigeria]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Colombia]], [[Serbia]], [[Croatia]], [[Ireland]], and the [[Middle East]] including the [[Palestinian Territories]].&lt;ref name=Rosenberg2001&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|first=Marshall|title=Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Compassion|year=2001|publisher=Puddledancer Press|location=Encinitas, CA| page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and development==
According to a biography of Rosenberg on the Center for Nonviolent Communication (CNVC) website, Nonviolent Communication training evolved from his search for a way to rapidly disseminate peacemaking skills. CNVC says that NVC emerged from work he was doing with civil rights activists in the early 1960s, and that during this period he also mediated between rioting students and college administrators, and worked to peacefully desegregate public schools in long-segregated regions.&lt;ref name="Bio"&gt;[http://www.cnvc.org/about/marshall-rosenberg.html Our founder's bio], cnvc.org&lt;/ref&gt;

A master's thesis by Marion Little (2008) says that the roots of the NVC model developed in the late 1960s, when Rosenberg was working on [[racial integration]] in schools and organizations in the [[Southern United States]].&lt;ref name="Little"&gt;Little, Marion (2008) [http://www.cnvc.org/sites/cnvc.org/files/MLittle_Thesis0408.pdf Total Honesty/Total Heart: Fostering empathy development and conflict resolution skills. A violence prevention strategy]. MA Thesis, Dispute Resolution, Victoria, B.C., Canada: University of Victoria, 286.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest version of the model (observations, feelings, and action-oriented wants) was part of a training manual Rosenberg prepared in 1972. The model had evolved to its present form (observations, feelings, needs and requests) by 1992. The dialog between Rosenberg and NVC colleagues and trainers continued to influence the model, which by the late 2000s put more emphasis on ''self-empathy'' as a key to the model's effectiveness. Another shift in emphasis, since 2000, has been the reference to the model as a ''process''. The focus is thus less on the "steps" themselves and more on the practitioner's ''[[intention]]s'' in speaking ("Is the intent to get others to do what one wants, or to foster more meaningful relationships and mutual satisfaction?") in listening ("Is the intent to prepare for what one has to say, or to extend heartfelt, respectful attentiveness to another?") and the quality of connection experienced with others.&lt;ref name="Little"/&gt;

Also according to Little's thesis, Rosenberg's work with [[Carl Rogers]] on research to investigate the [[Person-centered therapy#The necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary and sufficient conditions]] of a [[therapeutic relationship]] was central to the development of NVC. Rogers emphasized: 1) experiential learning, 2) "frankness about one's emotional state," 3) the satisfaction of hearing others "in a way that resonates for them," 4) the enriching and encouraging experience of "creative, active, sensitive, accurate, empathic listening," 5) the "deep value of congruence between one's own inner experience, one's conscious awareness, and one's communication," and, subsequently, 6) the enlivening experience of unconditionally receiving love or appreciation and extending the same.&lt;ref name="Little"/&gt;

Little says Rosenberg was influenced by [[Erich Fromm]], [[George Albee]], and [[George Armitage Miller|George Miller]] to adopt a community focus in his work, moving away from clinical psychological practice. The central ideas influencing this shift by Rosenberg were that: (1) individual mental health depends on the social structure of a community (Fromm), (2) therapists alone are unable to meet the psychological needs of a community (Albee), and (3) knowledge about human behavior will increase if psychology is freely given to the community (Miller).&lt;ref name="Little"/&gt;

According to Little, Rosenberg's early work with children with [[learning disabilities]] shows his interest in [[psycholinguistics]] and the power of language, as well as his emphasis on [[collaboration]]. In its initial development, the NVC model re-structured the pupil-teacher relationship to give students greater responsibility for, and decision-making related to, their own learning. The model has evolved over the years to incorporate institutional power relationships (i.e., police-citizen, boss-employee) and informal ones (i.e. man-woman, rich-poor, adult-youth, parent-child). The ultimate aim is to develop societal relationships based on a [[Restorative practices|restorative]], "[[partnership]]" paradigm and mutual [[respect]], rather than a [[Retributive justice|retributive]], fear-based, "[[Dominance hierarchy|domination]]" paradigm.&lt;ref name="Little"/&gt;

Little also says Rosenberg identified [[Mahatma Gandhi]] as an inspiration for the NVC model, and that Rosenberg's goal was to develop a practical process for interaction rooted in the philosophy of [[Ahimsa]], which Little translates as "the overflowing love that arises when all ill-will, anger, and hate have subsided from the heart."&lt;ref name="Little"/&gt;

In order to show the differences between communication styles, Rosenberg started to use two animals. Violent communication was represented by the carnivorous Jackal as a symbol of aggression and especially dominance. The herbivorous Giraffe on the other hand, represented his NVC strategy. The Giraffe was chosen as symbol for NVC as its long neck is supposed to show the clear-sighted speaker, being aware of his fellow speakers' reactions; and because the Giraffe has a large heart, representing the compassionate side of NVC. In his courses he tended to use these animals in order to make the differences in communication clearer to the audience.

===Overview===
[[File:Gewaltfreie Kommunikation nach Marshall Rosenberg.jpg|thumbnail|Cards with basic human needs in the hands of exercise group participants.]]
Nonviolent Communication holds that most conflicts between individuals or groups arise from miscommunication about their [[Need|human need]]s, due to [[Coercion#Psychological|coercive]] or [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] language that aims to induce [[fear]], [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[shame]], etc. These "violent" modes of communication, when used during a conflict, divert the attention of the participants away from clarifying their needs, their feelings, their perceptions, and their requests, thus perpetuating the conflict.

Marshall Rosenberg, the founder of Nonviolent Communication, published numerous training materials to help in efforts to bring about radical social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Marshall|title=The Nonviolent Communication Training Course|date=2006|publisher=Sounds True, Inc.|location=Boulder, Colorado|isbn=1-59179-443-9|pages=Disc Eight, "How Nonviolent Communication Supports Social Change"}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was concerned with transforming the "gangs and domination structures" through the method he called "ask, ask, ask". He suggested social change activists could focus on gaining access to those in power in order to "ask, ask, ask" for changes that will make life better for all including the powerful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Marshall|title=The Heart of Social Change: How You Can Make a Difference in Your World|date=2005|publisher=PuddleDancer Press|location=Encinitas, California|isbn=978-1-892005-46-5|pages=10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote about the need for the protective use of force, distinguishing it from the punitive use of force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Marshall|title=Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Compassion|date=August 2002|publisher=PuddleDancer Press|location=Encinitas, California|isbn=1-892005-02-6|pages=155–163|edition=8th Printing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assumptions===
Two NVC trainers characterize the assumptions underlying NVC as follows:&lt;ref name="KashtanAssump"/&gt;
#All human beings share the same needs
#Our world offers sufficient resources for meeting everyone's basic needs
#All actions are attempts to meet needs
#Feelings point to needs being met or unmet
#All human beings have the capacity for compassion
#Human beings enjoy giving
#Human beings meet needs through interdependent relationships
#Human beings change
#Choice is internal
#The most direct path to peace is through self-connection

===Intentions===
The trainers also say that practicing NVC involves having the following intentions:&lt;ref name="KashtanAssump"/&gt;
*Open-hearted living
#[[Self-compassion]]
#Expressing from the heart
#Receiving with compassion
#Prioritizing connection
#Moving beyond "right" and "wrong" to using needs-based assessments
*Choice, responsibility, peace
#Taking responsibility for our feelings
#Taking responsibility for our actions
#Living in peace with unmet needs
#Increasing capacity for meeting needs
#Increasing capacity for meeting the present moment
*Sharing power (partnership)
#Caring equally for everyone's needs
#Using force minimally and to protect rather than to educate, punish, or get what we want without agreement

===Communication that blocks compassion===
Rosenberg says that certain ways of communicating tend to alienate people from the experience of compassion:&lt;ref name="Rosenberg"&gt;{{cite book | last=Rosenberg | first=Marshall | authorlink = Marshall Rosenberg | title = Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life | publisher = Puddledancer Press |year=2003 | isbn = 1-892005-03-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|ch.2}}
*''Moralistic judgments'' implying wrongness or badness on the part of people who don't act in harmony with our values. Blame, insults, put-downs, labels, criticisms, comparisons, and diagnoses are all said to be forms of judgment. (''Moralistic judgments'' are not to be confused with ''[[value judgment]]s'' as to the qualities we value.) The use of moralistic judgments is characterized as an impersonal way of expressing oneself that does not require one to reveal what is going on inside of oneself. This way of speaking is said to have the result that "Our attention is focused on classifying, analyzing, and determining levels of wrongness rather than on what we and others need and are not getting."
*''Demands'' that implicitly or explicitly threaten listeners with blame or punishment if they fail to comply.
*''Denial of responsibility'' via language that obscures awareness of personal responsibility. It is said that we deny responsibility for our actions when we attribute their cause to: vague impersonal forces ("I had to"); our condition, diagnosis, personal or psychological history; the actions of others; the dictates of authority; group pressure; institutional policy, rules, and regulations; gender roles, social roles, or age roles; or uncontrollable impulses.
*''Making comparisons'' between people.
*A premise of ''deserving'', that certain actions merit reward while others merit punishment.

===Four components===
[[File:The Inner World of OFNR (NVC).png|thumb|upright=1.3|How Observation, Feelings, Needs and Requests are connected in the NVC system]]
Rosenberg invites NVC practitioners to focus attention on four components:
*'''Observation''': the facts (what we are seeing, hearing, or touching) as distinct from our evaluation of meaning and significance. NVC discourages static [[generalization]]s. It is said that "When we combine observation with evaluation others are apt to hear criticism and resist what we are saying." Instead, a focus on observations specific to time and context is recommended.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg"/&gt;{{rp|ch.3}}
*'''Feelings''': emotions or sensations, free of thought and story. These are to be distinguished from thoughts (e.g., "I feel I didn't get a fair deal") and from words colloquially used as feelings but which convey what we think we are (e.g., "inadequate"), how we think others are evaluating us (e.g., "unimportant"), or what we think others are doing to us (e.g., "misunderstood", "ignored"). Feelings are said to reflect whether we are experiencing our needs as met or unmet. Identifying feelings is said to allow us to more easily connect with one another, and "Allowing ourselves to be vulnerable by expressing our feelings can help resolve conflicts."&lt;ref name="Rosenberg"/&gt;{{rp|ch.4}}
*'''Needs''': universal human needs, as distinct from particular strategies for meeting needs. It is posited that "Everything we do is in service of our needs."&lt;ref name="SpeakPeace"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|first=Marshall B.|title=Speak Peace in a World of Conflict: What You Say Next Will Change Your World|year=2005|publisher=Puddledancer Press|isbn=978-1-892005-17-5|pages=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Request''': request for a specific action, free of demand. Requests are distinguished from demands in that one is open to hearing a response of "no" without this triggering an attempt to force the matter. If one makes a request and receives a "no" it is recommended not that one give up, but that one empathize with what is preventing the other person from saying "yes," before deciding how to continue the conversation. It is recommended that requests use clear, positive, concrete action language.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg"/&gt;{{rp|ch.6}}

===Modes===
There are three primary modes of application of NVC:
*'''Self-empathy''' involves compassionately connecting with what is going on inside us. This may involve, without blame, noticing the thoughts and judgments we are having, noticing our feelings, and most critically, connecting to the needs that are affecting us.&lt;ref name="SpeakPeace"/&gt;{{rp|ch.4}}
*'''Receiving empathically''', in NVC, involves "connection with what's alive in the other person and what would make life wonderful for them... It's not an understanding of the head where we just mentally understand what another person says... Empathic connection is an understanding of the heart in which we see the beauty in the other person, the divine energy in the other person, the life that's alive in them... It doesn't mean we have to feel the same feelings as the other person. That's sympathy, when we feel sad that another person is upset. It doesn't mean we have the same feelings; it means we are with the other person... If you're mentally trying to understand the other person, you're not present with them."&lt;ref name="SpeakPeace"/&gt;{{rp|ch.5}} Empathy involves "emptying the mind and listening with our whole being." NVC suggests that however the other person expresses themselves, we focus on listening for the underlying observations, feelings, needs, and requests. It is suggested that it can be useful to reflect a paraphrase of what another person has said, highlighting the NVC components implicit in their message, such as the feelings and needs you guess they may be expressing.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg"/&gt;{{rp|ch.7}}
*'''Expressing honestly''', in NVC, is likely to involve expressing an observation, feeling, need, and request. An observation may be omitted if the context of the conversation is clear. A feeling might be omitted if there is sufficient connection already, or the context is one where naming a feeling isn't likely to contribute to connection. It is said that naming a need in addition to a feeling makes it less likely that people will think you are making them responsible for your feeling. Similarly, it is said that making a request in addition to naming a need makes it less likely that people will infer a vague demand that they address your need. The components are thought to work together synergistically. According to NVC trainer Bob Wentworth, "an observation sets the context, feelings support connection and getting out of our heads, needs support connection and identify what is important, and a request clarifies what sort of response you might enjoy. Using these components together minimizes the chances of people getting lost in potentially disconnecting speculation about what you want from them and why."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Roles of the Four Components of NVC |last=Wentworth |first=Bob|work=capitalnvc.net |url=http://capitalnvc.net/bobrolesofcomponents}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
As of 2008, NVC was said to lack significant "longitudinal analytical research,"&lt;ref name="Fullerton" /&gt; and few studies had evaluated the effectiveness of NVC training programs.&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt; There had been little discussion of NVC in academic contexts, and most evidence for the effectiveness of NVC was said to be anecdotal or based on theoretical support. Since that time, the number of publications reporting research on NVC has more than doubled.&lt;ref name="NVCresearch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnvc.org/about-us/projects/nvc-research/nvc-research|title=NVC Research|publisher=Center for Nonviolent Communication|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carme Juncadella produced a systematic review of research as of 2013 related to the impact of NVC on the development of empathy.&lt;ref name=Juncadella&gt;{{cite journal|last=Juncadella|first=Carme Mampel|title=What is the impact of the application of the Nonviolent Communication model on the development of empathy? Overvie|journal=MSc in Psychotherapy Studies|date=October 2013|url=http://www.cnvc.org/sites/default/files/NVC_Research_Files/Carme_Mampel_Juncadella.pdf|accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She found 13 studies which met her inclusion criteria (three were published in peer reviewed journals; ten were unpublished theses or researcher reports). Eleven of these suggested an increase in empathy subsequent to the application of NVC (five of these with evidence of statistical significance) and two did not. Juncadella notes several shortcomings of her review. None of the studies she included were randomized and only three used validated instruments. As a result she used a narrative synthesis review format, which, "lacks precision," but allows the summarization of studies of different types, sizes, outcome measures and aims. She suggests the primary limitation of her review is that a number of relevant studies exist that could not be included due to lack of availability. She suggests these might have significantly altered her results. Finally, she includes the following caveat: "I must mention the inevitable subjectivity bias present throughout the whole review. In spite of the efforts made towards 'disciplined subjectivity'... my decisions show a degree of uncertainty and inaccuracy born via the tension between the weak evidence of the studies and my own convictions about the NVC model." Her overall assessment of the current research on NVC's efficacy in promoting the development of empathy is that the results are promising, but "would need to be confirmed with further studies bearing stronger designs and more appropriate measures." She notes that a major shortcoming of the existing research is the "mismatch between the constructs of the model and the validated empathy measures" and suggests that improved instruments need to be developed to adequately test NVC.

As of 2017, fifteen master's theses and doctoral dissertations are known to have tested the model on sample sizes of 108 or smaller and generally have found the model to be effective.&lt;ref name="Branscomb"&gt;Jane Branscomb (2011), [http://www.cnvc.org/sites/cnvc.org/files/NVC_Research_Files/NVC%20Research/branscomb_dissertation.pdf Summation Evaluation of a Workshop in Collaborative Communication], M.A. Thesis, Rollins School of Public Health of Emory University.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Little"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NVCresearch" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nash, A.L.

MS Sociology. Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia: pp.40&lt;/ref&gt;

Allan Rohlfs, who first met Rosenberg in 1972 and was a founder of the Center for Nonviolent Communication, in 2011 explained a paucity of academic literature as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Virtually all conflict resolution programs have an academic setting as their foundation and therefore have empirical studies by graduate students assessing their efficacy. NVC is remarkable for its roots. Marshall Rosenberg, Ph.D. ([[clinical psychology]], [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|U of Wisconsin]]) comes from a full time private practice in clinical psychology and consultation, never an academic post. NVC, his creation, is entirely a grassroots organization and never had until recently any foundation nor grant monies, on the contrary funded 100% from trainings which were offered in public workshops around the world. ... Empirical data is now coming slowly as independent researchers find their own funding to conduct and publish empirical studies with peer review.&lt;ref name="Allan Rohlfs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nwcompass.org/about-nvc/note-origins-nvc/|title=Note on the Origins of NVC|publisher=Northwest Compassionate Communication|accessdate=22 Sep 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Richard Bowers' master's thesis (2012),&lt;ref&gt;Bowers, Richard D. (2012). ''Toward an Integrated Model: Using Nonviolent Communication in Mediation''. MA Thesis, Conflict Analysis and Engagement, Yellow Springs, OH: Antioch University Midwest.&lt;/ref&gt; updated to book form by Bowers and Moffett (2012),&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Empathy in Conflict Intervention: The Key to Successful NVC Mediation|last = Bowers|first = Richard|publisher = Harmony World Publishing|year = 2012|isbn = 978-1-4776-1460-0|location = |pages = |last2 = Moffett|first2 = Nelle}}&lt;/ref&gt; asserts that NVC has been absent from academic programs due to a lack of research into the theoretical basis for the model and lack of research on the reliability of positive results. Bowers' thesis meets the first objection through an analysis of existing theories which provide solid support for each element of the NVC (mediation) model. Without this theoretical understanding, it would not be clear what aspects of the NVC model make it work or even if it can be effectively applied by anyone other than Marshall Rosenberg. This theoretical analysis can provide a foundation for further empirical research on the effectiveness and reliability of the model.

A variety of benefits were reported, including "conversations and meetings were notably more efficient, with issues being resolved in 50-80 percent less time."

NVC has reportedly been an element of a bundle of interventions that produced dramatic changes in [[Psychiatric and mental health nursing#Organization of mental health care|forensic psychiatric nursing]] settings in which a high level of violence is the norm. NVC was adopted, in combination with other interventions, in an effort to reduce violence. The interventions were said to reduce key violence indicators by 90 percent over a three-year period in a medium security unit,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Riemer |first1=D. |last2=Corwith |first2=C. |year=2007 |title= Application of core strategies: reducing seclusion &amp; restraint use|journal=On the Edge |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=7–10 |url=http://www.cnvc.org/sites/default/files/research/OTEFall2007.pdf |accessdate=Mar 19, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by around 50 percent in a single year in a maximum security unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Riemer |first1=D. |year=2009 |title=Creating Sanctuary: Reducing Violence in a Maximum Security Forensic Psychiatric Hospital Unit |journal=On the Edge |volume=15 |issue=1 |url=http://www.iafn.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=302 |accessdate=Sep 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 study examined the effects of combined NVC and [[Mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]] training on 885 male inmates of the [[Monroe Correctional Complex]] in [[Monroe, Washington]]. The training was found to reduce recidivism from 37% to 21%, and the training was estimated as having saved the state $5 million per year in reduced incarceration costs. The training was found to increase equanimity, decrease anger, and lead to abilities to take responsibility for one's feelings, express empathy, and to make requests without imposing demands.&lt;ref name=FreedomProjectStudy&gt;{{cite journal|last=Suarez|first=Alejandra|author2=Dug Y.

NVC has also been reported as effective in reducing domestic violence. Male participants who graduated from an NVC-based batterer intervention program in California had zero percent recidivism within 5 years, according to the relevant District Attorneys' offices. The news report contrasted this with a recidivism rate of 40 percent within 5 years as reported by the Domestic Abuse Intervention Project for graduates of their batterer intervention program based on the [[Duluth Model]], said to previously offer the lowest known domestic violence recidivism rate.&lt;ref name=Battering&gt;{{cite news|title=Batterers' intervention recidivism rates lowest known to date|url=http://www.mtdemocrat.com/news/batterers-intervention-recidivism-rates-lowest-known-to-date/|accessdate=1 May 2014|newspaper=Mountain Democrat (Placerville, CA)|date=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowers and Moffett&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; provide a thoughtful study of the important role of empathy and human needs in mediation through the development of a theoretical model to explain the effectiveness of NVC mediation. The authors present theories of human needs and the basis for a common core of needs. They discuss theories that explain the importance of understanding human needs in the context of conflict resolution. They clearly distinguish core human needs from interests (strategies) and how focusing on needs is a paradigm shift in the field of conflict resolution. Further, Bowers and Moffett present theories of empathy
from the pioneering work of Carl Rogers, [[Heinz Kohut]], and others. Empathy is distinguished from sympathy and active listening, pointing out how the word empathy is often confused in the literature by using it interchangeably with these other two terms. They also examine stage theories of the development of empathy as well as constructive-developmental theories related to empathy.

Some recent research appears to validate the existence of universal human needs.&lt;ref&gt;The Atlantic, [https://www.theatlantic.com/life/archive/2011/08/maslow-20-a-new-and-improved-recipe-for-happiness/243486/ Maslow 2.0: A New and Improved Recipe for Happiness]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tay |first1=Louis|last2=Diener|first2=Ed

==Relationship to spirituality==
As Theresa Latini notes, "Rosenberg understands NVC to be a fundamentally [[Spirituality|spiritual]] practice."&lt;ref name=Latini&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall Rosenberg describes the influence of his spiritual life on the development and practice of NVC:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I think it is important that people see that spirituality is at the base of Nonviolent Communication, and that they learn the mechanics of the process with that in mind. It's really a spiritual practice that I am trying to show as a way of life. Even though we don't mention this, people get seduced by the practice. Even if they practice this as a mechanical technique, they start to experience things between themselves and other people they weren't able to experience before. So eventually they come to the spirituality of the process. They begin to see that it's more than a communication process and realize it's really an attempt to manifest a certain spirituality.&lt;ref name="Spiritual Basis of Nonviolent Communication"&gt;{{cite web|title=Spiritual Basis of Nonviolent Communication: A Question and Answer Session with Marshall B. Rosenberg, Ph.D|url=http://www.cnvc.org/learn-online/spiritual-basis/spiritual-basis-nonviolent-communication|publisher=Center for Nonviolent Communication|accessdate=Dec 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rosenberg further states that he developed NVC as a way to "get conscious of" what he calls the "Beloved Divine Energy".&lt;ref name="Spiritual Basis of Nonviolent Communication"/&gt;

Many people have found Nonviolent Communication to be very complementary to [[Buddhism]], both in theory and in manifesting Buddhist ideals in practice.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.fwbo-news.org/features/2008/05/nvc-in-fwbo-heart-to-heart.html NVC in the FWBO: Heart-to-Heart Communication]", Shantigarbha, ''FWBO &amp; TBMSG News'', May 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://shambhalatimes.org/2009/01/31/buddhism-and-nonviolent-communication/ Buddhism and Nonviolent Communication]", Jason Little, ''Shambhala Times'', January 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LasaterSay"&gt;{{cite book| title=What We Say Matters: Practicing Nonviolent Communication |last1=Lasater|last2=Lasater|first1=Judith Hanson|first2=Ike K.|publisher=Rodmell Press|year=2009|pages=192|isbn=978-1-930485-24-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to other models==
Marion Little examines theoretical frameworks related to NVC. The influential [[Getting to Yes|interest-based model]] for conflict resolution, negotiation, and mediation developed by [[Roger Fisher (academic)|Fisher]], [[William Ury|Ury]], and Patton at the [[Harvard Negotiation Project]] and at the [[Program on Negotiation]] in the 1980s appears to have some conceptual overlap with NVC, although neither model references the other.&lt;ref name="Little"/&gt;{{rp|31–35}} Little suggests [[Parent Effectiveness Training|The Gordon Model for Effective Relationships]] (1970) as a likely precursor to both NVC and interest-based negotiation, based on conceptual similarities, if not any direct evidence of a connection.&lt;ref name="Little"/&gt;{{rp|35–41}} Like Rosenberg, [[Thomas Gordon (psychologist)|Gordon]] had worked with Carl Rogers, so the models' similarities may reflect common influences.&lt;ref name="Little"/&gt;{{rp|35}}

Suzanne Jones sees a substantive difference between [[active listening]] as originated by Gordon and empathic listening as recommended by Rosenberg, insofar as active listening involves a specific step of reflecting what a speaker said to let them know you are listening, whereas empathic listening involves an ongoing process of listening with both heart and mind and being fully present to the other's experience, with an aim of comprehending and empathizing with the needs of the other, the meaning of the experience for that person.&lt;ref name="SJones"&gt;Jones, Suzanne (2009) [http://www.cnvc.org/sites/cnvc.org/files/NVC_Research_Files/NVC%20in%20Schools/TRADITIONAL_EDUCATION_OR_PARTNERSHIP_EDUCATION_S_Jones.pdf Traditional Education or Partnership Education: Which Educational Approach Might Best Prepare Students for the Future?] MA Thesis, Communication, San Diego, California. USA. San Diego University: 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gert Danielsen and Havva Kök both note an overlap between the premises of NVC and those of Human Needs Theory (HNT), an academic model for understanding the sources of conflict and designing conflict resolution processes, with the idea that "Violence occurs when certain individuals or groups do not see any other way to meet their need, or when they need understanding, respect and consideration for their needs."&lt;ref name=Danielsen&gt;{{cite web|last=Danielsen|first=Gert|title=Meeting Human Needs, Preventing Violence: Applying Human Needs Theory to the Conflict in Sri Lanka|url=http://www.cnvc.org/sites/cnvc.org/files/NVC_Research_Files/NVC%20and%20Violence%20Prevention/Danielsen2005.pdf|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Havva Kök, [http://turin.sgir.eu/uploads/Kok-paper_for_section_6_reducing_violence_by_meeting_human_needs.pdf "Nonviolent Communication in Political Conflicts"], USAK Yearbook of International Politics and Law, Volume 2, (2009). pp. 349–362&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burton, John 1990b.

Chapman Flack sees an overlap between what Rosenberg advocates and [[critical thinking]], especially [[Bertrand Russell]]'s formulation uniting kindness and clear thinking.&lt;ref name="Flack"/&gt;

Martha Lasley sees similarities with the Focused Conversation Method developed by the [[The Institute of Cultural Affairs International|Institute of Cultural Affairs (ICA)]], with NVC's ''observations'', ''feelings'', ''needs'', and ''requests'' components relating to FCM's ''objective'', ''reflective'', ''interpretive'', and ''decisional'' stages.&lt;ref&gt;Lasley, Martha (2005) ''Difficult Conversations: Authentic Communication Leads to Greater Understanding and Teamwork''.

==Responses==
As of 2008, some researchers noted that NVC lacked an evidence base beyond the copious anecdotal claims of effectiveness and similarly lacked discussion in the literature of the theoretical basis of the model.&lt;ref name="Gear" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fullerton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt;

Several researchers have attempted a thorough evaluation of criticisms and weaknesses of NVC and assessed significant challenges in its application.&lt;ref name="Juncadella" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Altmann&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Altmann|first=Tobias |title=Evaluation der Gewaltfreien Kommunikation in Quer- und Längsschnittdaten |type=Unpublished dissertation |publisher=University of Leipzig, Institut für Psychologie II |date=2010|url=http://www.gewaltfrei-dach.eu/sites/default/files/medium-wissenschaftliche-arbeit-altmann-tobias-diplomarbeit.pdf|accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bitschnau&gt;{{cite book|last=Bitschnau|first=Karoline|title=Die Sprache der Giraffen. Wie die Gewaltfreie Kommunikation Ihr Leben verändern kann |date=2008|publisher=Paderborn (Junfermann)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Oboth&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oboth|first=Monika|title=Inspiration und Herausforderung.|journal=Spektrum der Mediation.|date=2007|volume=28|pages=9–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; These span a range of potential problems, from the practical to the theoretical, and include concerns gathered from study participants and researchers.

The difficulty of using NVC as well as the dangers of misuse are common concerns. In addition, Bitschnau&lt;ref name="Bitschnau" /&gt; and Flack&lt;ref name="Flack" /&gt; find a paradoxical potential for violence in the use of NVC, occasioned by its unskilled use. Bitschnau further suggests that the use of NVC is unlikely to allow everyone to express their feelings and have their needs met in real life as this would require inordinate time, patience and discipline. Those who are skilled in the use of NVC may become prejudiced against those who are not and prefer to converse only among themselves.

Oboth suggests that people might hide their feelings in the process of empathy, subverting the nonviolence of communication.&lt;ref name="Oboth" /&gt;

The massive investment of time and effort in learning to use NVC has been noted by a number of researchers.&lt;ref name="Juncadella" /&gt;

Chapman Flack, in reviewing a training video by Rosenberg, finds the presentation of key ideas "spell-binding" and the anecdotes "humbling and inspiring", notes the "beauty of his work", and his "adroitly doing fine attentive thinking" when interacting with his audience. Yet Flack wonders what to make of aspects of Rosenberg's presentation, such as his apparent "dim view of the place for thinking" and his building on [[Walter Wink]]'s account of the origins of our way of thinking. To Flack, some elements of what Rosenberg says seem like pat answers at odds with the challenging and complex picture of human nature history, literature and art offer.&lt;ref name="Flack"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+subtle+violence+of+nonviolent+language.-a0152267677 |title=The subtle violence of nonviolent language. |last=Flack|first=Chapman |journal=[[CrossCurrents]] |volume=56|number=3|issn=0011-1953|date=September 2006|accessdate=January 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flack notes a distinction between the "strong sense" of Nonviolent Communication as a virtue that is possible with care and attention, and the "weak sense," a mimicry of this born of ego and haste. The strong sense offers a language to examine one's thinking and actions, support understanding, bring one's best to the community, and honor one's emotions. In the weak sense, one may take the language as rules and use these to score debating points, label others for political gain, or insist that others express themselves in this way. Though concerned that some of what Rosenberg says could lead to the weak sense, Flack sees evidence confirming that Rosenberg understands the strong sense in practice. Rosenberg's work with workshop attendees demonstrates "the real thing." Yet Flack warns that "the temptation of the weak sense will not be absent." As an antidote, Flack advises, "Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others," (also known as the [[robustness principle]]) and guard against the "metamorphosis of nonviolent communication into subtle violence done in its name."&lt;ref name="Flack"/&gt;

Ellen Gorsevski, assessing Rosenberg's book, ''Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Compassion'' (1999) in the context of geopolitical rhetoric, states that "the relative strength of the individual is vastly overestimated while the key issue of [[structural violence]] is almost completely ignored."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Gorsevski | first1=Ellen | title = Peaceful Persuasion: The Geopolitics of Nonviolent Rhetoric | pages=166, 227–228 |publisher = State University of New York Press |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center for Nonviolent Communication (CNVC), founded by Marshall Rosenberg, has trademarked the terms ''NVC'', ''Nonviolent Communication'' and ''Compassionate Communication'', among other terms, for clarity and branding purposes.&lt;ref name="Sharing"&gt;[http://www.cnvc.org/node/6832 Guidelines for sharing NVC], cnvc.org&lt;/ref&gt;

CNVC certifies trainers who wish to teach NVC in a manner aligned with CNVC's understanding of the NVC process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnvc.org/training/certification.html Certification], cnvc.org&lt;/ref&gt; CNVC also offers trainings by certified trainers.&lt;ref name="IIT"&gt;[http://www.cnvc.org/training/international-intensive-trainings-iits.html Nonviolent Communication International Intensive Training], cnvc.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Some trainings in Nonviolent Communication are offered by trainers sponsored by organizations considered as allied with, but having no formal relationship with, the Center for Nonviolent Communication founded by Marshall Rosenberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Organizations |url=http://www.nvcworld.com/organisations |publisher=NVC World |website=nvcworld.com |accessdate=October 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://capitalnvc.net/organizationofmovement Organization of the NVC Movement], capitalnvc.net&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these trainings are announced through CNVC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnvc.org/trainingcal Training Schedule], cnvc.org&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous NVC organizations have sprung up around the world, many with regional focuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nvcworld.com/organisations |title=International Organisations |first= |last= |work=nvcworld.com |year=2011 |accessdate=October 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnvc.org/organizations |title=Find nvc organizations |work=cnvc.org|year=2011 |accessdate=October 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Norman Harry Packard''' (born 1954 in [[Billings, Montana]])&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Bass, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q9aOedEfOMMC&amp;dq= ''The eudaemonic pie''], Houghton Mifflin, 1985, p.26&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[chaos theory]] [[physicist]] and one of the founders of the [[Prediction Company]] and [[ProtoLife]]. He is an alumnus of [[Reed College]] and the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}. Packard is known for his contributions to both chaos theory and cellular automata. He also coined the phrase "the edge of chaos".&lt;ref&gt;Packard, Norman, "Adaptation Toward the Edge of Chaos", 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="p"&gt;Bass, Thomas A., ''The Predictors'', 1999, Henry Holt Publishing, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Between 1976 and 1981, he worked with fellow graduate students in [[Santa Cruz, California]], forming the [[Eudaemons]] collective with [[J. Doyne Farmer]] and others, to develop a strategy for beating the [[roulette]] wheel using a toe-operated computer. The computer could, in theory, predict in what area a roulette ball would land on a wheel, giving the player a significant statistical advantage over the house. Although the project itself was a success, they ran into great practical difficulty employing the technique on-site in Las Vegas casinos, and many of the members left to pursue other fields of academia. The experiences of Norman, Doyne Farmer, and crew were later chronicled in the book ''[[Eudaemons|The Eudaemonic Pie]]'' (1985) by Thomas Bass.  Their experience was also chronicled on the television series "Breaking Vegas."

Around the same time, he formed the [[Dynamical Systems Collective]] with friends [[Robert Shaw (Physicist)|Rob Shaw]], [[J. Doyne Farmer|Doyne Farmer]], and [[James P. Crutchfield|James Crutchfield]]. The collective was best known for its work in probing chaotic systems for signs of order.

In 1982, Packard left Santa Cruz for France to take a post-doctoral fellowship at the [[Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques]] in [[Bures-sur-Yvette]], [[France]]. He left after one year and joined the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]. At the IAS, he worked with [[Stephen Wolfram]] and friend [[Robert Shaw (Physicist)|Rob Shaw]] to explain [[cellular automata]] and the tendency for matter to organize itself.

==Professional work==
===Center for Complex Systems Research===

in 1985 Packard moved with Wolfram to the physics department of University of Illinois, where he eventually became an associate professor, and where he was a founding member of the Center for Complex Systems Research.

===Santa Fe Institute===

Packard was involved with the [[Santa Fe Institute]] over many years, in several capacities including external professor and member of the science steering committee.

===Prediction Company===

In the spring of 1985, Packard and Doyne Farmer realized that their research in fields such as chaos, Genetic Algorithms and cellular automata could help build a system for predicting the [[stock market]]. Five years later they founded [[Prediction Company]], a small company dedicated to making a model for predicting what a market would do during a certain time period. A brief outline of some of the genetic algorithm techniques he used in the early days is presented in chapter 2 of reference 5 below. In 2004, Prediction Company received the "Employer of Choice" award in the small size category for the State of [[New Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.predict.com/html/company.htm Prediction Company: Company Profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902191532/http://www.predict.com/html/company.htm |date=2006-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company still exists today as a subsidiary of Swiss bank [[UBS AG]].

===European Center for Living Technology===

Packard was one of the founders of the [[European Center for Living Technology]] (ECLT), hosted by the University of Venice, Ca' Foscari.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecltech.org European Center for Living Technology]&lt;/ref&gt;  The ECLT received its first funding from PACE (Programmable Artificial Cell Evolution), a project coordinated by John S. McCaskill and funded by the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.istpace.org Programmable Artificial Cell Evolution]&lt;/ref&gt;  From its inception in 2004 and for over a decade Packard has served on its science board, and as co-director.

===ProtoLife===

In 2004, Packard founded [[ProtoLife]], the first company to capitalize on living technology. The goal of the company is to optimize complex chemical reactions and other complex processes.  The company was launched in [[Venice, Italy]], and is currently based in [[San Francisco]].

===Lucky Sort===

In 2011 Packard joined Lucky Sort&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luckysort.com Lucky Sort Inc.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115210119/http://luckysort.com/ |date=2013-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as Chief Science Officer.  At Lucky Sort he guides research to discover and display structure in high volume text data streams.

The '''paternal age effect''' is the statistical relationship between paternal age at conception and biological effects on the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = paternal age effect|url = http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/paternal+age+effect|accessdate = 2015-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such effects can relate to [[Birth mass|birthweight]], congenital disorders, life expectancy, and psychological outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Autism Spectrum Disorders|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Prf0InCqQS0C&amp;pg=PA837&amp;dq=paternal+age+effect+low+birth+weight++congenital+problems&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yD9nVYnzFMuhNqyqgKAP&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=paternal%20age%20effect%20low%20birth%20weight%20%20congenital%20problems&amp;f=false|publisher = Oxford University Press, USA|date = 2011-06-17|isbn = 9780195371826|first = David|last = Amaral|first2 = Geraldine|last2 = Dawson|first3 = Daniel|last3 = Geschwind}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 review found that while severe health effects are associated with higher paternal age, the total increase in problems caused by paternal age is low.&lt;ref name=Ur2017/&gt; While paternal age has increased since 1960-1970 this is not seen as a major public health concern.&lt;ref name=Ur2017&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Urhoj|first2=Stine Kjaer|date=February 2017|title=Is advanced paternal age a health risk for the offspring?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0015028216630911|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=107|issue=2|pages=312–318|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2016.12.019|issn=0015-0282|last1=Nybo Andersen|first1=Anne-Marie|accessdate=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The genetic quality of sperm, as well as its volume and motility, all may decrease with age,&lt;ref name="About.com article by R. Gurevich"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://infertility.about.com/od/causesofinfertility/f/maleagefertile.htm|title=Does Age Affect Male Fertility?|last=Gurevich|first=Rachel|date=June 10, 2008|work=About.com:Fertility|publisher=About.com|accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=3854059 | pmid=23912310 | doi=10.1038/aja.2013.92 | volume=15 | title=The effects of advanced paternal age on fertility | year=2013 | journal=Asian J. Androl. | pages=723–8 | author=Kovac JR, Addai J, Smith RP, Coward RM, Lamb DJ, Lipshultz LI}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading the population geneticist [[James F. Crow]] to claim that the "greatest mutational health hazard to the human genome is fertile older males".&lt;ref name="Crow 8380–8386"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crow|first=James F.|title= The high spontaneous mutation rate: Is it a health risk?|date=August 5, 1997|volume=94|issue=16|pages=8380–8386|pmc=33757|pmid=9237985|doi=10.1073/pnas.94.16.8380|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paternal age effect was first proposed implicitly by [[Wilhelm Weinberg|Weinberg]] in 1912,&lt;ref name="Weinberg 1912"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weinberg|first=W|title= Zur Vererbung des Zwergwuchses. (On the inheritance of dwarfism)|date=1912|volume=9|issue=|pages=710–718|pmc=|pmid=|doi=|journal=Arch Rassen-u Gesell Biol}}&lt;/ref&gt; and explicitly by [[Lionel Penrose|Penrose]] in 1955.&lt;ref name="Penrose 1955"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Penrose|first=LS|title= Parental age and mutation|date=1955|volume=269|issue=|pages=312–313|pmc=|pmid=13243724|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(55)92305-9 |journal=Lancet}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA-based research started more recently, in 1998, in the context of paternity testing.

==Health effects==
Evidence for a paternal age effect has been proposed for a number of conditions, diseases and other effects. In many of these, the statistical evidence of association is weak, and the association may be related by [[confounding]] factors, or behavioural differences.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Wray|first2=Naomi R|last3=Peyrot|first3=Wouter J|last4=McGrath|first4=John J|last5=Visscher|first5=Peter M|last6=Goddard|first6=Michael E|date=2016-05-23|title=Risk of psychiatric illness from advanced paternal age is not predominantly from de novo mutations|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/ng.3577|journal=Nature Genetics|volume=48|issue=7|pages=718–724|doi=10.1038/ng.3577|issn=1061-4036|last1=Gratten|first1=Jacob|accessdate=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ur2017/&gt; Conditions proposed to show correlation with paternal age include the following:&lt;ref name= "Tournaye-2009"&gt;H. Tournaye, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=-SlaAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA104 Male Reproductive Ageing]," in Bewley, Ledger, and Nikolaou, eds., ''Reproductive Ageing'', Cambridge University Press (2009), {{ISBN|9781906985134}} (accessed 15 November 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Single-gene disorders===
Advanced paternal age may be associated with a higher risk for certain [[Genetic disorder#Single-gene disorder|single-gene disorders]] caused by [[mutation]]s of the [[FGFR2]], [[FGFR3]], and [[RET proto-oncogene|RET]] genes.&lt;ref name="toriello2008"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Toriello HV, Meck JM |title=Statement on guidance for genetic counseling in advanced paternal age |journal=Genet. Med. |volume=10 |issue=6 |pages=457–60 |year=2008 |pmid=18496227 |pmc=3111019 |doi=10.1097/GIM.0b013e318176fabb}}&lt;/ref&gt; These conditions are [[Apert syndrome]], [[Crouzon syndrome]], [[Pfeiffer syndrome]], [[achondroplasia]], [[thanatophoric dysplasia]], [[multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2]], and [[multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2b]].&lt;ref name="toriello2008" /&gt; The most significant effect concerns achondroplasia (a form of dwarfism), which might occur in about 1 in 1,875 children fathered by men over 50, compared to 1 in 15,000 in the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Kovac JR, Addai J, Smith RP, Coward RM, Lamb DJ, Lipshultz LI |title=The effects of advanced paternal age on fertility |journal=Asian J. Androl. |volume=15 |issue=6 |pages=723–8 |year=2013 |pmid=23912310 |pmc=3854059 |doi=10.1038/aja.2013.92}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the risk for achondroplasia is still considered clinically negligible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Czeizel AE, Czeizel B, Vereczkey A |title=The participation of prospective fathers in preconception care |journal=Clin Med Insights Reprod Health |volume=7 |issue= |pages=1–9 |year=2013 |pmid=24453513 |pmc=3888083 |doi=10.4137/CMRH.S10930}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FGFR genes may be particularly prone to a paternal age effect due to selfish spermatogonial selection, whereby the influence of spermatogonial mutations in older men is enhanced because cells with certain mutations have a [[Natural selection|selective advantage]] over other cells (see [[#DNA mutations|§&amp;nbsp;DNA mutations]]).&lt;ref name="ramasamy2015" /&gt;

===Pregnancy effects===
Several studies have reported that advanced paternal age is associated with an increased risk of [[miscarriage]].&lt;ref name="abbas2015"&gt;{{cite journal | authors = Abbas HA, Rafei RE, Charafeddine L, Yunis K | year = 2015 | title = Effects of Advanced Paternal Age on Reproduction and Outcomes in Offspring | journal = NeoReviews | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = e69 -e83 | doi = 10.1542/neo.16-2-e69}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strength of the association differs between studies.&lt;ref name="sharma2015"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Sharma R, Agarwal A, Rohra VK, Assidi M, Abu-Elmagd M, Turki RF |title=Effects of increased paternal age on sperm quality, reproductive outcome and associated epigenetic risks to offspring |journal=Reprod. Biol. Endocrinol. |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=35 |year=2015 |pmid=25928123 |doi=10.1186/s12958-015-0028-x | url = http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/s12958-015-0028-x.pdf |pmc=4455614}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been suggested that these miscarriages are caused by [[chromosome abnormalities]] in the sperm of aging men.&lt;ref name="abbas2015" /&gt; An increased risk for [[stillbirth]] has also been suggested for pregnancies fathered by men over 45.&lt;ref name="sharma2015" /&gt;

===Birth outcomes===
A [[systematic review]] published in 2010 concluded that the graph of the risk of low birthweight in infants with paternal age is "saucer-shaped" (U-shaped); that is, the highest risks occur at low and at high paternal ages.&lt;ref name="Shah-2010"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Shah PS; Knowledge Synthesis Group on determinants of preterm/low birthweight births | title = Paternal factors and low birthweight, preterm, and small for gestational age births: a systematic review | journal = Am J Obstet Gynecol | volume = 202 | issue = 2 | pages = 103–23 | year = 2010 | url = http://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378%2809%2900952-1/fulltext | doi = 10.1016/j.ajog.2009.08.026 | pmid = 20113689 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared with a paternal age of 25–28 years as a reference group, the odds ratio for low birthweight was approximately 1.1 at a paternal age of 20 and approximately 1.2 at a paternal age of 50.&lt;ref name="Shah-2010"/&gt;  There was no association of paternal age with [[preterm birth]]s or with [[small for gestational age]] births.&lt;ref name="Shah-2010"/&gt;

===Mental illness===

===Intelligence===
A review 2005 found a U-shaped relationship between paternal age and low [[intelligence quotient]]s (IQs).&lt;ref name="Malaspina-2005"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1097/00041444-200506000-00008 |vauthors=Malaspina D, Reichenberg A, Weiser M, Fennig S, Davidson M, Harlap S, Wolitzky R, Rabinowitz J, Susser E, Knobler HY | title = Paternal age and intelligence: implications for age-related genomic changes in male germ cells | journal = Psychiatr Genet | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 117–25 | year = 2005 | url = http://journals.lww.com/psychgenetics/Abstract/2005/06000/Paternal_age_and_intelligence__implications_for.8.aspx | pmid = 15900226 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest IQ was found at paternal ages of 25-44; fathers younger than 25 and older than 44 tended to have children with lower IQs.&lt;ref name="Malaspina-2005"/&gt; Malaspina ''et al.'' also reviewed the literature and found that "at least a half dozen other studies ... have demonstrated significant associations between paternal age and human intelligence."&lt;ref name="Malaspina-2005"/&gt;

A 2009 study examined children at 8 months, 4 years, and 7 years and found that paternal age was associated with poorer scores in almost all [[neurocognitive]] tests used, but that maternal age was associated with better scores on the same tests.&lt;ref name="Saha-2009"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Saha S, Barnett AG, Foldi C, Burne TH, Eyles DW, Buka SL, McGrath JJ |title=Advanced Paternal Age Is Associated with Impaired Neurocognitive Outcomes during Infancy and Childhood |journal=PLoS Med |year=2009 | volume=6 | issue=3 | pages=e40 | doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000040 | url = http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1000040 | pmid= 19278291 | pmc=2653549 | editor1-last=Brayne | editor1-first=Carol }}&lt;/ref&gt; An editorial accompanying the paper emphasized the importance of controlling for [[socioeconomic status]] in studies of paternal age and intelligence.&lt;ref name="Cannon-2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Cannon M | title = Contrasting Effects of Maternal and Paternal Age on Offspring Intelligence: The clock ticks for men too | journal = PLoS Med | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = e42 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.1000042 | url = http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1000042 | pmid = 19278293 | pmc = 2653550 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 paper from Spain provided further evidence that average paternal age is elevated in cases of intellectual disability.&lt;ref name="Lopez-Castroman-2010"&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Lopez-Castroman J, Gómez DD, Belloso JJ, Fernandez-Navarro P, Perez-Rodriguez MM, Villamor IB, Navarrete FF, Ginestar CM, Currier D, Torres MR, Navio-Acosta M, Saiz-Ruiz J, Jimenez-Arriero MA, Baca-Garcia E | title = Differences in maternal and paternal age between schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders | journal = Schizophr Res | volume = 116 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 184–90 | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1016/j.schres.2009.11.006 | url = http://www.schres-journal.com/article/S0920-9964%2809%2900557-X/abstract | pmid = 19945257 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later research concluded that previously reported negative associations might be explained by confounding factors, especially parental intelligence and education.

===Life expectancy===
A 2008 paper found a U-shaped association between paternal age and the overall mortality rate in children (i.e., mortality rate up to age 18).&lt;ref name="Zhu-2008"&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Zhu JL, Vestergaard M, Madsen KM, Olsen J | title = Paternal age and mortality in children | journal = Eur J Epidemiol | volume = 23 | issue = 7 | pages = 443–7 | year = 2008 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/0r7507752277k8r4/ | doi = 10.1007/s10654-008-9253-3 | pmid = 18437509 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the relative mortality rates were higher, the absolute numbers were low, because of the relatively low occurrence of genetic abnormality. The study has been criticized for not adjusting for maternal health, which could have a large effect on child mortality.&lt;ref&gt;"In this particular study, no adjustment was made for the health of the mother, and this could have had a large effect on child mortality." National Health Service (UK), "[http://www.nhs.uk/news/2008/06June/Pages/Olderdadsanddeathofchildren.aspx Older Dads and the Death of Children]," (accessed 15 November 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers also found a correlation between paternal age and offspring death by injury or poisoning, indicating the need to control for social and behavioral confounding factors.&lt;ref&gt;Tournaye 2009, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 a study showed that greater age at paternity tends to increase telomere length in offspring for up to two generations. Since telomere length has effects on health and mortality, this may have effects on health and the rate of aging in these offspring. The authors speculated that this effect may provide a mechanism by which populations have some plasticity in adapting longevity to different social and ecological contexts.&lt;ref name=Eisenberg&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eisenberg|first1=Dan T.A.|last2=Hayes|first2=M.

Parents do not decide when to reproduce randomly. This implies that paternal age effects may be [[Confounding|confounded]] by social and genetic predictors of reproductive timing.

A simulation study concluded that reported paternal age effects on psychiatric disorders in the epidemiological literature are too large to be explained only by mutations. They conclude that a model in which parents with a genetic liability to psychiatric illness tend to reproduce later better explains the literature.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Later age at parenthood is also associated with a more stable family environment, with older parents being less likely to divorce or change partners.&lt;ref name="Schmidt2011" /&gt; Older parents also tend to occupy a higher socio-economic position and report feeling more devoted to their children and satisfied with their family.&lt;ref name="Schmidt2011" /&gt; On the other hand, the risk of the father dying before the child becomes an adult increases with paternal age.&lt;ref name="Schmidt2011"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Schmidt L, Sobotka T, Bentzen JG, Nyboe Andersen A |title=Demographic and medical consequences of the postponement of parenthood |journal=Hum.

To adjust for genetic liability, some studies compare full siblings. Additionally or alternatively, studies statistically adjust for some or all of these confounding factors. Using sibling comparisons or adjusting for more covariates frequently changes the direction or magnitude of paternal age effects. For example, one study drawing on Finnish census data concluded that increases in offspring mortality with paternal age could be explained completely by parental loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Elo|first2=Irma T.|last3=Kohler|first3=Iliana V.|last4=Martikainen|first4=Pekka|date=October 2014|title=The association between advanced maternal and paternal ages and increased adult mortality is explained by early parental loss|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953614003670|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=119|pages=215–223|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.06.008|issn=0277-9536|last1=Myrskylä|first1=Mikko|accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, a population-based cohort study drawing on 2.6 million records from Sweden found that risk of [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] was only positively associated with paternal age when comparing siblings.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Rickert|first2=Martin E.|last3=Frans|first3=Emma|last4=Kuja-Halkola|first4=Ralf|last5=Almqvist|first5=Catarina|last6=Sjölander|first6=Arvid|last7=Larsson|first7=Henrik|last8=Lichtenstein|first8=Paul|date=2014-02-26|title=Paternal age at childbearing and offspring psychiatric and academic morbidity|journal=JAMA Psychiatry|doi=10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2013.4525|issn=2168-622X|last1=D’Onofrio|first1=Brian M.|volume=71|page=432|pmc=3976758}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanisms==
Several hypothesized chains of causality exist whereby increased paternal age may lead to health effects.&lt;ref name="sharma2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="malaspina2015" /&gt; There are different types of genome mutations, with distinct mutation mechanisms: 
*DNA length mutations of repetitive DNA (such as [[telomere]]s and [[microsatellite]]s), caused by cellular copying errors
*DNA point mutations, caused by cellular copying errors and also by chemical and physical insults such as radiation
*chromosome breaks and rearrangements, which can occur in the resting cell 
*epigenetic changes, i.e. methylation of the DNA, which can activate or silence certain genes, and is sometimes passed down from parent to child

===Telomere length===
[[Telomeres]] are repetitive genetic sequences at both ends of each chromosome that protect the structure of the [[chromosome]].&lt;ref name="wiener2012"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Wiener-Megnazi Z, Auslender R, Dirnfeld M |title=Advanced paternal age and reproductive outcome |journal=Asian J. Androl. |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=69–76 |year=2012 |pmid=22157982 |pmc=3735149 |doi=10.1038/aja.2011.69}}&lt;/ref&gt; As men age, most telomeres shorten, but sperm telomeres increase in length.&lt;ref name="sharma2015" /&gt; The offspring of older fathers have longer telomeres in both their sperm and [[white blood cells]].&lt;ref name="sharma2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wiener2012" /&gt; A large study showed a positive paternal, but no independent maternal age effect on telomere length. Because the [[Twin study|study used twins]], it could not compare siblings who were discordant for paternal age. It found that telomere length was 70% heritable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Codd|first2=Veryan|last3=Nyholt|first3=Dale R.|last4=Deelen|first4=Joris|last5=Mangino|first5=Massimo|last6=Willemsen|first6=Gonneke|last7=Albrecht|first7=Eva|last8=Amin|first8=Najaf|last9=Beekman|first9=Marian|date=October 2013|title=Meta-analysis of telomere length in 19 713 subjects reveals high heritability, stronger maternal inheritance and a paternal age effect|url=http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v21/n10/abs/ejhg2012303a.html|journal=European Journal of Human Genetics|volume=21|issue=10|pages=1163–1168|doi=10.1038/ejhg.2012.303|issn=1018-4813|last1=Broer|first1=Linda|last10=de Geus|first10=Eco J.

===DNA point mutations===
In contrast to [[oogenesis]], [[spermatogenesis|the production of sperm cells]] is a lifelong process.&lt;ref name="sharma2015" /&gt; Each year after puberty, [[spermatogonia]] (precursors of the [[spermatozoa]]) divide [[meiosis|meiotically]] about 23 times.&lt;ref name="malaspina2015"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Malaspina D, Gilman C, Kranz TM |title=Paternal age and mental health of offspring |journal=Fertil. Steril. |volume= 103|issue= |pages= 1392–6|year=2015 |pmid=25956369 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2015.04.015 |pmc=4457665}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the age of 40, the spermatogonia will have undergone about 660 such divisions, compared to 200 at age 20.&lt;ref name="malaspina2015" /&gt; Copying errors might sometimes happen during the [[DNA replication]] preceding these cell divisions, which may lead to new (''de novo'') [[mutations]] in the sperm DNA.&lt;ref name="ramasamy2015"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Ramasamy R, Chiba K, Butler P, Lamb DJ |title=Male biological clock: a critical analysis of advanced paternal age |journal=Fertil. Steril. |volume= 103|issue= |pages= 1402–6|year=2015 |pmid=25881878 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2015.03.011 |pmc=4955707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''selfish spermatogonial selection'' hypothesis proposes that the influence of spermatogonial mutations in older men is further enhanced because cells with certain mutations have a [[Natural selection|selective advantage]] over other cells.&lt;ref name="malaspina2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="goriely2013"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Goriely A, Wilkie AO | title ="Selfish spermatogonial selection": a novel mechanism for the association between advanced paternal age and neurodevelopmental disorders | journal = Am. J. Psychiatry | volume = 170 | pages = 599–608 | year = 2013 | doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2013.12101352 | pmc= 4001324 | pmid = 23639989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such an advantage would allow the mutated cells to increase in number through [[Clone (cell biology)|clonal]] expansion.&lt;ref name="malaspina2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="goriely2013" /&gt; In particular, mutations that affect the [[Ras subfamily|RAS]] [[Signalling pathway|pathway]], which regulates spermatogonial proliferation, appear to offer a competitive advantage to spermatogonial cells, while also leading to diseases associated with paternal age.&lt;ref name="goriely2013" /&gt;

===Epigenetic changes===
[[File:DNA methylation.jpg|thumb|DNA methylation]]
The production of sperm cells involves [[DNA methylation]], an [[epigenetic]] process that regulates the [[gene expression|expression of genes]].&lt;ref name="malaspina2015" /&gt; Improper [[genomic imprinting]] and other errors sometimes occur during this process, which can affect the expression of genes related to certain disorders, increasing the offspring's susceptibility.&lt;ref name="Perrin-2007" /&gt; The frequency of these errors appears to increase with age.&lt;ref name="Perrin-2007" /&gt; This could explain the association between paternal age and schizophrenia.&lt;ref name="Perrin-2007"&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Perrin MC, Brown AS, Malaspina D | title = Aberrant Epigenetic Regulation Could Explain the Relationship of Paternal Age to Schizophrenia | journal = Schizophr Bull | volume = 33 | issue = 6 | pages = 1270–3 | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1093/schbul/sbm093 | url = http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/sbm093v1 | pmid = 17712030 | pmc = 2779878 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semen===
A 2001 review on variation in semen quality and fertility by male age concluded that older men had lower semen volume, lower sperm motility, and a decreased percent of normal sperm.&lt;ref name="Kidd-2001"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kidd SA, Eskenazi B, Wyrobek AJ |title=Effects of male age on semen quality and fertility: a review of the literature |journal=Fertil Steril |volume=75 |issue=2 |pages=237–48 |year=2001 |pmid=11172821 |doi= 10.1016/S0015-0282(00)01679-4|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0015-0282(00)01679-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; One common factor is the abnormal regulation of sperm once a mutation arises.  It has been seen that once taking place, the mutation will almost always be positively selected for and over time will lead to the mutant sperm replacing all non-mutant sperm.  In younger males, this process is corrected and regulated by the growth factor receptor-RAS signal transduction pathway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goriely|first1=Anne|last2=Wilkie|first2=Andrew|title=Paternal Age Effect Mutations and Selfish Spermatogonial Selection: Causes and Consequences for Human Disease|journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics|date=2012|volume=90|issue=2|pages=175–200|doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2011.12.017|pmid=22325359|pmc=3276674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 review indicated that increasing male age is associated with declines in many semen traits, including semen volume and percentage motility. However, this review also found that sperm concentration did not decline as male age increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=Sheri L.|last2=Dunleavy|first2=Jessica|last3=Gemmell|first3=Neil J.|last4=Nakagawa|first4=Shinichi|title=Consistent age-dependent declines in human semen quality: A systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=Ageing Research Reviews|date=January 2015|volume=19|pages=22–33|doi=10.1016/j.arr.2014.10.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===X-linked effects===
Some classify the paternal age effect as one of two different types. One effect is directly related to advanced paternal age and autosomal mutations in the offspring. The other effect is an indirect effect in relation to mutations on the X chromosome which are passed to daughters who are then at risk for having sons with X-linked diseases.&lt;ref name="medterms"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=33298|title=Definition of Advanced paternal age}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1912, [[Wilhelm Weinberg]], a German physician, was the first person to hypothesize that non-inherited cases of [[achondroplasia]] could be more common in last-born children than in children born earlier to the same set of parents.&lt;ref name="Crow-2000"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Crow JF |title=The origins, patterns and implications of human spontaneous mutation |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=40–7 |year=2000 |doi=10.1038/35049558 |url=http://ender.bu.edu/~tgardner/be209/lectures/12/articles/Crow.JF_NatRevGen_00.pdf |pmid=11262873 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029211526/http://ender.bu.edu/~tgardner/be209/lectures/12/articles/Crow.JF_NatRevGen_00.pdf |archivedate=October 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Weinberg "made no distinction between paternal age, maternal age and [[birth order]]" in his hypothesis. In 1953, Krooth used the term "paternal age effect" in the context of achondroplasia, but mistakenly thought the condition represented a maternal age effect.&lt;ref name="Crow-2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Krooth-1953"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Krooth RS | title = Comments on the estimation of the mutation rate for achondroplasia | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 373–6 | year = 1953 | pmid = 13104383 | pmc = 1716528 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|375}} The paternal age effect for achondroplasia was described by [[Lionel Penrose]] in 1955. At a DNA level, the paternal age effect was first reported in 1998 in routine paternity tests.&lt;ref name="Brinkmann-1998"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brinkmann B, Klintschar M, Neuhuber F, Huhne J, Rolf B | title = Mutation Rate in Human Microsatellites: Influence of the Structure and Length of the Tandem Repeat | journal = Am J Hum Genet| volume = 62 | issue = 6 | pages = 1408–1415 | year = 1998 | doi = 10.1086/301869 | pmid = 9585597 | pmc = 1377148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific interest in paternal age effects is relevant because the average paternal age increased in countries such as the United Kingdom,&lt;ref name="Bray-2006"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bray I, Gunnell D, Smith GD | title = Advanced paternal age: How old is too old? | journal = J Epidemiol Community Health| volume = 60 | issue = 10 | pages = 851–3 | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1136/jech.2005.045179 | pmid = 16973530 | pmc = 2566050}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Products/92A449676DCE3145CA25766A00120E3D?opendocument |title= 3301.0 - Births, Australia, 2008.

==Medical assessment==
The [[American College of Medical Genetics]] recommends [[obstetric ultrasonography]] at 18–20 weeks [[gestation]] in cases of advanced paternal age to evaluate fetal development, but it notes that this procedure "is unlikely to detect many of the conditions of interest." They also note that there is no standard definition of ''advanced paternal age'';&lt;ref name="Toriello-2008"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Toriello HV, Meck JM; Professional Practice and Guidelines Committee, American College of Medical Genetics | title = Statement on guidance for genetic counseling in advanced paternal age | journal = Genet Med | volume = 10 | issue = 6 | pages = 457–60 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1097/GIM.0b013e318176fabb | url = http://journals.lww.com/geneticsinmedicine/Abstract/2008/06000/Statement_on_guidance_for_genetic_counseling_in.10.aspx | pmid = 18496227 | pmc = 3111019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is commonly defined as age 40 or above, but the effect increases linearly with paternal age, rather than appearing at any particular age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Frans E, MacCabe JH, Reichenberg A |title=Advancing paternal age and psychiatric disorders |journal=World Psychiatry |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=91–3 |year=2015 |pmid=25655163 |pmc=4329902 |doi=10.1002/wps.20190}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2006 review, any adverse effects of advanced paternal age "should be weighed up against potential social advantages for children born to older fathers who are more likely to have progressed in their career and to have achieved financial security."&lt;ref name="Bray-2006"/&gt;

Geneticist [[James F. Crow]] described mutations that have a direct visible effect on the child's health and also mutations that can be latent or have minor visible effects on the child's health; many such minor or latent mutations allow the child to reproduce, but cause more serious problems for grandchildren, great-grandchildren and later generations.&lt;ref name="Crow 8380–8386"/&gt;

PTSD symptoms may result when a traumatic event causes an over-reactive adrenaline response, which creates deep neurological patterns in the brain.

PTSD has been hypothesized to be a maladaptive learning pathway to fear response through a hypersensitive, hyperreactive, and hyperresponsive HPA axis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yehuda R | title = Clinical relevance of biologic findings in PTSD | journal = The Psychiatric Quarterly | volume = 73 | issue = 2 | pages = 123–33 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12025720 | doi = 10.1023/A:1015055711424 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low [[cortisol]] levels may predispose individuals to PTSD: Following war trauma, [[Sweden|Swedish]] soldiers serving in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] with low pre-service salivary cortisol levels had a higher risk of reacting with PTSD symptoms, following war trauma, than soldiers with normal pre-service levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aardal-Eriksson E, Eriksson TE, Thorell LH | title = Salivary cortisol, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and general health in the acute phase and during 9-month follow-up | journal = Biological Psychiatry | volume = 50 | issue = 12 | pages = 986–93 | date = December 2001 | pmid = 11750895 | doi = 10.1016/S0006-3223(01)01253-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because cortisol is normally important in restoring [[homeostasis]] after the stress response, it is thought that trauma survivors with low cortisol experience a poorly contained—that is, longer and more distressing—response, setting the stage for PTSD.

It is thought that the locus coeruleus-noradrenergic system mediates the over-consolidation of fear memory. High levels of cortisol reduce noradrenergic activity, and because people with PTSD tend to have reduced levels of cortisol, it has been proposed that individuals with PTSD cannot regulate the increased noradrenergic response to traumatic stress.&lt;ref name="PTSD fact and fiction"/&gt; Intrusive memories and conditioned fear responses are thought to be a result of the response to associated triggers. [[Neuropeptide Y]] has been reported to reduce the release of norepinephrine and has been demonstrated to have [[anxiolytic]] properties in animal models. Studies have shown people with PTSD demonstrate reduced levels of NPY, possibly indicating their increased anxiety levels.&lt;ref name="Skelton 2012 628–637" /&gt;

Other studies indicate that people that suffer from PTSD have chronically low levels of [[serotonin]], which contributes to the commonly associated behavioral symptoms such as anxiety, ruminations, irritability, aggression, suicidality, and impulsivity.&lt;ref name="Olszewski 2005 40"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olszewski TM, Varrasse JF | title = The neurobiology of PTSD: implications for nurses | journal = Journal of Psychosocial Nursing and Mental Health Services | volume = 43 | issue = 6 | pages = 40–7 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 16018133 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Serotonin also contributes to the stabilization of glucocorticoid production.

[[Dopamine]] levels in a person with PTSD can help contribute to the symptoms associated. Low levels of dopamine can contribute to [[anhedonia]], [[apathy]], [[Attentional control|impaired attention]], and motor deficits. Increased levels of dopamine can cause [[psychosis]], [[Psychomotor agitation|agitation]], and restlessness.&lt;ref name="Olszewski 2005 40" /&gt;

Multiple studies described elevated concentrations of the [[thyroid hormone]] [[triiodothyronine]] in PTSD.&lt;ref name = "Chatzitomaris_2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chatzitomaris A, Hoermann R, Midgley JE, Hering S, Urban A, Dietrich B, Abood A, Klein HH, Dietrich JW | title = Thyroid Allostasis-Adaptive Responses of Thyrotropic Feedback Control to Conditions of Strain, Stress, and Developmental Programming | journal = Frontiers in Endocrinology | volume = 8 | pages = 163 | date = 20 July 2017 | pmid = 28775711 | pmc = 5517413 | doi = 10.3389/fendo.2017.00163 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of type 2 [[Allostatic load|allostatic]] adaptation may contribute to increased sensitivity to catecholamines and other stress mediators.

Hyperresponsiveness in the norepinephrine system can also be caused by continued exposure to high stress. Overactivation of norepinephrine receptors in the prefrontal cortex can be connected to the flashbacks and nightmares frequently experienced by those with PTSD. A decrease in other norepinephrine functions (awareness of the current environment) prevents the memory mechanisms in the brain from processing that the experience, and emotions the person is experiencing during a flashback are not associated with the current environment.&lt;ref name="Olszewski 2005 40" /&gt;

There is considerable controversy within the medical community regarding the neurobiology of PTSD. A 2012 review showed no clear relationship between cortisol levels and PTSD.  The majority of reports indicate people with PTSD have elevated levels of [[corticotropin-releasing hormone]], lower basal [[cortisol]] levels, and enhanced negative feedback suppression of the HPA axis by [[dexamethasone]].&lt;ref name="Skelton 2012 628–637" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lindley SE, Carlson EB, Benoit M | title = Basal and dexamethasone suppressed salivary cortisol concentrations in a community sample of patients with posttraumatic stress disorder | journal = Biological Psychiatry | volume = 55 | issue = 9 | pages = 940–5 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15110738 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsych.2003.12.021 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

People with PTSD have decreased brain activity in the dorsal and rostral [[Anterior cingulate cortex|anterior cingulate]] cortices and the [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]], areas linked to the experience and regulation of emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Etkin A, Wager TD | title = Functional neuroimaging of anxiety: a meta-analysis of emotional processing in PTSD, social anxiety disorder, and specific phobia | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 164 | issue = 10 | pages = 1476–88 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17898336 | pmc = 3318959 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.2007.07030504 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amygdala is strongly involved in forming emotional memories, especially fear-related memories.  During high stress, the [[hippocampus]], which is associated with placing memories in the correct context of space and time and memory recall, is suppressed. According to one theory this suppression may be the cause of the [[flashbacks (psychology)|flashbacks]] that can affect people with PTSD. When someone with PTSD undergoes [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] similar to the traumatic event, the body perceives the event as occurring again because the memory was never properly recorded in the person's memory.&lt;ref name="Skelton 2012 628–637" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van der Kolk B | title = Posttraumatic stress disorder and the nature of trauma | journal = Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–22 | date = March 2000 | pmid = 22034447 | pmc = 3181584 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amygdalocentric model of PTSD proposes that the amygdala is very much aroused and insufficiently controlled by the medial [[prefrontal cortex]] and the hippocampus, in particular during [[Extinction (psychology)|extinction]].&lt;ref name="Milad"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Milad MR, Pitman RK, Ellis CB, Gold AL, Shin LM, Lasko NB, Zeidan MA, Handwerger K, Orr SP, Rauch SL | title = Neurobiological basis of failure to recall extinction memory in posttraumatic stress disorder | journal = Biological Psychiatry | volume = 66 | issue = 12 | pages = 1075–82 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19748076 | pmc = 2787650 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsych.2009.06.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is consistent with an interpretation of PTSD as a syndrome of deficient extinction ability.&lt;ref name="Milad" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stein"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stein MB, Paulus MP | title = Imbalance of approach and avoidance: the yin and yang of anxiety disorders | journal = Biological Psychiatry | volume = 66 | issue = 12 | pages = 1072–4 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19944792 | pmc = 2825567 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsych.2009.09.023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[basolateral amygdala|basolateral]] nucleus (BLA) of the amygdala is responsible for the comparison and development of associations between unconditioned and conditioned responses to stimuli, which results in the fear conditioning present in PTSD. The BLA activates the [[central nucleus]] (CeA) of the amygdala, which elaborates the fear response, (including behavioral response to threat and elevated startle response). Descending inhibitory inputs from the [[medial prefrontal cortex]] (mPFC) regulate the transmission from the BLA to the CeA, which is hypothesized to play a role in the extinction of conditioned fear responses.&lt;ref name="Skelton 2012 628–637" /&gt;  While as a whole, amygdala hyperactivity is reported by meta analysis of functional neuroimaging in PTSD, there is a large degree of heterogeniety, more so than in social anxiety disorder or phobic disorder.  Comparing dorsal(roughly the CeA) and ventral(roughly the BLA) clusters, hyperactivity is more robust in the ventral cluster, while hypoactivity is evident in the dorsal cluster.  The distinction may explain the blunted emotions in PTSD(via desensitization in the CeA) as well as the fear related component.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Goodkind M, Etkin A | veditors = Sklar P, Buxbaum J, Nestler E, Charney D | title=Neurobiology of Mental Illness|publisher=Oxford University Press|edition=5th|chapter=Functional Neurocircuitry and Neuroimaging Studies of Anxiety Disorders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
PTSD can be difficult to diagnose, because of:
* the subjective nature of most of the diagnostic criteria (although this is true for many mental disorders); 
* the potential for over-reporting, e.g., while seeking disability benefits, or when PTSD could be a [[mitigating factor]] at criminal sentencing; 
* the potential for under-reporting, e.g., stigma, pride, fear that a PTSD diagnosis might preclude certain employment opportunities;
* symptom overlap with other mental disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=First |first1=Michael B. | name-list-format = vanc |title=DSM-5® Handbook of Differential Diagnosis |date=2013 |publisher=American Psychiatric Pub |isbn=9781585629985 |page=225 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=haOvBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA225 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* association with other mental disorders such as major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder;
* substance use disorders, which often produce some of the same signs and symptoms as PTSD; and 
* substance use disorders can increase vulnerability to PTSD or exacerbate PTSD symptoms or both; and
* PTSD increases the risk for developing substance abuse disorders.
*the differential expression of symptoms culturally (specifically with respect to avoidance and numbing symptoms, distressing dreams, and somatic symptoms)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders|date=2013-05-22|url=https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.books.9780890425596.dsm07|work=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|language=en|doi=10.1176/appi.books.9780890425596.dsm07|isbn=0890425558|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PTSD was classified as an&amp;nbsp;[[anxiety disorder]]&amp;nbsp;in the ''DSM-IV'', but has since been reclassified as a "trauma- and stressor-related disorder" in the ''DSM-5''.&lt;ref name="DSM5" /&gt; The ''DSM-5'' diagnostic criteria for PTSD include four symptom clusters: re-experiencing, avoidance, negative alterations in cognition/mood, and alterations in arousal and reactivity.&lt;ref name="DSM5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NIH2016" /&gt;

=== International classification of diseases ===
The International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10 (ICD-10) classifies PTSD under "Reaction to severe stress, and adjustment disorders."&lt;ref name="World Health Organization"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/bluebook.pdf|title=The ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders|publisher=World Health Organization|pages=120–121|format=PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323025330/http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/bluebook.pdf|archive-date=2014-03-23|deadurl=no|access-date=2014-01-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICD-10 criteria for PTSD include re-experiencing, avoidance, and either increased reactivity or inability to recall certain details related to the event.&lt;ref name="World Health Organization" /&gt;

The [[ICD-11]] diagnostic description for PTSD contains three components or symptom groups (1) re-experiencing, (2) avoidance, and (3) heightened sense of threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.who.int/news-room/detail/18-06-2018-who-releases-new-international-classification-of-diseases-(icd-11)|title=WHO releases new International Classification of Diseases (ICD 11)|work=World Health Organization|access-date=2018-11-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brewin|first=Chris R.|last2=Cloitre|first2=Marylène|last3=Hyland|first3=Philip|last4=Shevlin|first4=Mark|last5=Maercker|first5=Andreas|last6=Bryant|first6=Richard A.|last7=Humayun|first7=Asma|last8=Jones|first8=Lynne M.|last9=Kagee|first9=Ashraf|date=2017|title=A review of current evidence regarding the ICD-11 proposals for diagnosing PTSD and complex PTSD|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29029837|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|volume=58|pages=1–15|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2017.09.001|issn=1873-7811|pmid=29029837}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another difference between the ICD-10 and ICD-11 PTSD diagnostic formulations, ICD-11 no longer includes verbal thoughts about the traumatic event as a symptom.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; There is a predicted lower rate of diagnosed PTSD using ICD-11 compared to ICD10 or DSM-5.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; ICD-11 also proposes identifying a distinct group with complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD), who have more often experienced multiple and sustained traumas and have greater functional impairment than those with PTSD. &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Differential diagnosis ===

A diagnosis of PTSD requires that the person has been exposed to an extreme, life-threatening stressor. Any stressor can result in a diagnosis of [[adjustment disorder]] and it is an appropriate diagnosis for a stressor and a symptom pattern that does not meet the criteria for PTSD.

The symptom pattern for [[acute stress disorder]] must occur and be resolved within four weeks of the trauma. If it lasts longer, and the symptom pattern fits that characteristic of PTSD, the diagnosis may be changed.&lt;ref name=DSM4 /&gt;

[[Obsessive compulsive disorder]] may be diagnosed for [[intrusive thought]]s that are recurring but not related to a specific traumatic event.&lt;ref name=DSM4 /&gt;

In extreme cases of prolonged, repeated traumatization where there is no viable chance of escape, survivors may develop [[complex post-traumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref name="Herman1992"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Herman |first1=Judith Lewis | name-list-format = vanc |title=Complex PTSD: A syndrome in survivors of prolonged and repeated trauma |journal=Journal of Traumatic Stress |date=July 1992 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=377–391 |doi=10.1007/BF00977235}}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurs as a result of layers of trauma rather than a single traumatic event, and includes additional symptomatology, such as the loss of a coherent sense of self.&lt;ref name="Herman1997"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Herman |first1=Judith Lewis | name-list-format = vanc |title=Trauma and Recovery |date=1997 |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-465-08730-3 |pages=119–122 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modest benefits have been seen from early access to [[cognitive behavioral therapy]].

=== Psychological debriefing ===
{{see also|Debriefing#Crisis intervention}}

Trauma-exposed individuals often receive treatment called ''psychological debriefing'' in an effort to prevent PTSD, which consists of interviews that are meant to allow individuals to directly confront the event and share their feelings with the counselor and to help structure their memories of the event.&lt;ref name=AHRQ2013/&gt;  However, several [[Meta-analysis|meta-analyses]] find that psychological debriefing is unhelpful and is potentially harmful.&lt;ref name=AHRQ2013&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gartlehner|first1=Gerald|last2=Forneris|first2=Catherine A.|last3=Brownley|first3=Kimberly A.|last4=Gaynes|first4=Bradley N.|last5=Sonis|first5=Jeffrey|last6=Coker-Schwimmer|first6=Emmanuel|last7=Jonas|first7=Daniel E.|last8=Greenblatt|first8=Amy|last9=Wilkins|first9=Tania M.|last10=Woodell|first10=Carol L.|last11=Lohr|first11=Kathleen N. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Interventions for the Prevention of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in Adults After Exposure to Psychological Trauma|date=2013|publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (US)|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK133347|pmid=23658936}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Feldner2007&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Feldner MT, Monson CM, Friedman MJ | title = A critical analysis of approaches to targeted PTSD prevention: current status and theoretically derived future directions | journal = Behavior Modification | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 80–116 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17179532 | doi = 10.1177/0145445506295057 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.595.9186 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rose S, Bisson J, Churchill R, Wessely S | title = Psychological debriefing for preventing post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 2 | pages = CD000560 | date = 2002 | pmid = 12076399 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD000560 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is true for both single-session debriefing and multiple session interventions.&lt;ref name=Cochrane2009/&gt; As of 2017 The [[American Psychological Association]] assessed psychological debriefing as ''No Research Support/Treatment is Potentially Harmful''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Psychological Debriefing for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder|url=https://www.div12.org/psychological-treatments/treatments/psychological-debriefing-for-post-traumatic-stress-disorder/|website=www.div12.org|publisher=Society of Clinical Psychology: Division 12 of The American Psychological Association|access-date=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Depicting basic tenets of CBT.jpg|thumb|The diagram depicts how emotions, thoughts, and behaviors all influence each other. The triangle in the middle represents CBT's tenet that all humans' core beliefs can be summed up in three categories: self, others, future.]]

CBT seeks to change the way a person feels and acts by changing the patterns of thinking or behavior, or both, responsible for negative emotions.

In 2002, Shapiro and Maxfield published a theory of why this might work, called adaptive information processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shapiro F, Maxfield L | title = Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR): information processing in the treatment of trauma | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | volume = 58 | issue = 8 | pages = 933–46 | date = August 2002 | pmid = 12115716 | doi = 10.1002/jclp.10068 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory proposes that eye movement can be used to facilitate emotional processing of memories, changing the person's memory to attend to more adaptive information.&lt;ref name=VAguideline&gt;{{cite web |last=The Management of Post-Traumatic Stress Working Group |title=VA/DoD clinical practice guideline for management of post-traumatic stress |url=http://www.healthquality.va.gov/Post_Traumatic_Stress_Disorder_PTSD.asp |access-date=2 June 2013 |publisher=Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense |page=Version 2.0 |year=2010 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530234757/http://www.healthquality.va.gov/Post_Traumatic_Stress_Disorder_PTSD.asp |archive-date=30 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The therapist initiates voluntary rapid eye movements while the person focuses on memories, feelings or thoughts about a particular trauma.&lt;ref name=UK2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=CochraneGilliesKids&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gillies D, Taylor F, Gray C, O'Brien L, D'Abrew N | title = Psychological therapies for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder in children and adolescents | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 12 | issue =  | pages = CD006726 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23235632 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006726.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The therapists uses hand movements to get the person to move their eyes backward and forward, but hand-tapping or tones can also be used.&lt;ref name=UK2005/&gt;  EMDR closely resembles [[cognitive behavior therapy]] as it combines exposure (re-visiting the traumatic event), working on cognitive processes and relaxation/self-monitoring.&lt;ref name=UK2005/&gt; However, exposure by way of being asked to think about the experience rather than talk about it has been highlighted as one of the more important distinguishing elements of EMDR.&lt;ref name="Jeffries/Davis"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jeffries FW, Davis P | title = What is the role of eye movements in eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)? a review | journal = Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapy | volume = 41 | issue = 3 | pages = 290–300 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23102050 | doi = 10.1017/S1352465812000793 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been multiple small controlled trials of four to eight weeks of EMDR in adults&lt;ref name="AHRQtreat92"&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Jonas DE, Cusack K, Forneris CA |title=Psychological and pharmacological treatments for adults with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) |lay-url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0055845/ |laysource=Pubmed Health (plain English) |publisher=US Agency for Healthcare Quality and Research |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK137702/ |series=Comparative Effectiveness Reviews |issue=92 |date=April 2013 |place=Rockville, MD |pmid=23658937 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001133718/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK137702/ |archive-date=2013-10-01 |df= }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;  as well as children and adolescents.&lt;ref name="CochraneGilliesKids" /&gt; EMDR reduced PTSD symptoms enough in the short term that one in two adults no longer met the criteria for PTSD, but the number of people involved in these trials was small and thus results should be interpreted with caution pending further research.&lt;ref name="AHRQtreat92" /&gt; There was not enough evidence to know whether or not EMDR could eliminate PTSD in adults.&lt;ref name="AHRQtreat92" /&gt; In children and adolescents, a recent meta-analysis of [[randomized controlled trials]] using [[MetaNSUE]] to avoid biases related to missing information found that EMDR was at least as efficacious as CBT, and superior to waitlist or placebo.&lt;ref name=MetaNSUE/&gt; There was some evidence that EMDR might prevent depression.&lt;ref name="AHRQtreat92" /&gt; There were no studies comparing EMDR to other psychological treatments or to medication.&lt;ref name="AHRQtreat92" /&gt; Adverse effects were largely unstudied.&lt;ref name="AHRQtreat92" /&gt; The benefits were greater for women with a history of sexual assault compared with people who had experienced other types of traumatizing events (such as accidents, physical assaults and war). There is a small amount of evidence that EMDR may improve re-experiencing symptoms in children and adolescents, but EMDR has not been shown to improve other PTSD symptoms, anxiety, or depression.&lt;ref name="CochraneGilliesKids" /&gt;

The eye movement component of the therapy may not be critical for benefit.&lt;ref name="UK2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VAguideline" /&gt; As there has been no major, high quality randomized trial of EMDR with eye movements versus EMDR without eye movements, the controversy over effectiveness is likely to continue.&lt;ref name="Jeffries/Davis" /&gt; Authors of a meta-analysis published in 2013 stated, "We found that people treated with eye movement therapy had greater improvement in their symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder than people given therapy without eye movements....Secondly we found that that in laboratory studies the evidence concludes that thinking of upsetting memories and simultaneously doing a task that facilitates eye movements reduces the vividness and distress associated with the upsetting memories."&lt;ref name="pmid23266601"/&gt;

=== Medication ===
While many medications do not have enough evidence to support their use, three (fluoxetine, paroxetine, and venlafaxine) have been shown to have a small benefit over placebo.&lt;ref name="Hos2015"/&gt; With many medications, residual PTSD symptoms following treatment is the rule rather than the exception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Krystal JH, Neumeister A | title = Noradrenergic and serotonergic mechanisms in the neurobiology of posttraumatic stress disorder and resilience | journal = Brain Research | volume = 1293 | pages = 13–23 | date = October 2009 | pmid = 19332037 | pmc = 2761677 | doi = 10.1016/j.brainres.2009.03.044 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Glucocorticoids ====
[[Glucocorticoids]] may be useful for short-term therapy to protect against neurodegeneration caused by the extended stress response that characterizes PTSD, but long-term use may actually promote neurodegeneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Griffin GD, Charron D, Al-Daccak R | title = Post-traumatic stress disorder: revisiting adrenergics, glucocorticoids, immune system effects and homeostasis | journal = Clinical &amp; Translational Immunology | volume = 3 | issue = 11 | pages = e27 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25505957 | pmc = 4255796 | doi = 10.1038/cti.2014.26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cannabinoids|cannabinoid]] [[nabilone]] is sometimes used [[Off-label use|off-label]] for nightmares in PTSD.

The [[National Comorbidity Survey|National Comorbidity Survey Replication]] has estimated that the [[lifetime prevalence]] of PTSD among adult Americans is 6.8%, with women (9.7%) more than twice as likely as men&lt;ref name="Olszewski 2005 40" /&gt;  (3.6%) to have PTSD at some point in their lives.&lt;ref name=Kessler95&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kessler RC, Sonnega A, Bromet E, Hughes M, Nelson CB | title = Posttraumatic stress disorder in the National Comorbidity Survey | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 52 | issue = 12 | pages = 1048–60 | date = December 1995 | pmid = 7492257 | doi = 10.1001/archpsyc.1995.03950240066012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 60% of men and more than 60% of women experience at least one traumatic event in their life. The most frequently reported traumatic events by men are rape, combat, and childhood neglect or physical abuse. Women most frequently report instances of rape, sexual molestation, physical attack, being threatened with a weapon and childhood physical abuse.&lt;ref name="Olszewski 2005 40" /&gt; 88% of men and 79% of women with lifetime PTSD have at least one [[comorbid]] psychiatric disorder. Major depressive disorder, 48% of men and 49% of women, and lifetime alcohol abuse or dependence, 51.9% of men and 27.9% of women, are the most common comorbid disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sher L | title = Neurobiology of suicidal behavior in post-traumatic stress disorder | journal = Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics | volume = 10 | issue = 8 | pages = 1233–5 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20662745 | doi = 10.1586/ern.10.114 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Military combat ====
The [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] estimates that 830,000 Vietnam War veterans suffered symptoms of PTSD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mintz |first=S. |year=2007 |url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=513 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030907033319/http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=513 |archive-date=2003-09-07 |title=The War's Costs |website=Digital History}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''National Vietnam Veterans' Readjustment Study'' (NVVRS) found 15.2% of male and 8.5% of female Vietnam veterans to suffer from current PTSD at the time of the study. Life-Time prevalence of PTSD was 30.9% for males and 26.9% for females. In a reanalysis of the NVVRS data, along with analysis of the data from the Matsunaga Vietnam Veterans Project, Schnurr, Lunney, Sengupta, and Waelde found that, contrary to the initial analysis of the NVVRS data, a large majority of Vietnam veterans suffered from PTSD symptoms (but not the disorder itself). Four out of five reported recent symptoms when interviewed 20–25 years after Vietnam.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web |last=Price |first=Jennifer L. |title=Findings from the National Vietnam Veterans' Readjustment Study – Factsheet |work=United States Department of Veterans Affairs |publisher=National Center for PTSD |url=http://ncptsd.va.gov/ncmain/ncdocs/fact_shts/fs_nvvrs.html?printable-template=factsheet |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430104839/http://www.ncptsd.va.gov/ncmain/ncdocs/fact_shts/fs_nvvrs.html |archive-date=2009-04-30 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 study from [[Georgia State University]] and [[San Diego State University]] found that rates of PTSD diagnosis increased significantly when troops were stationed in combat zones, had tours of longer than a year, experienced combat, or were injured. Military personnel serving in combat zones were 12.1 percentage points more likely to receive a PTSD diagnosis than their active-duty counterparts in non-combat zones. Those serving more than 12 months in a combat zone were 14.3 percentage points more likely to be diagnosed with PTSD than those having served less than one year.  Experiencing an enemy firefight was associated a 18.3 percentage point increase in the probability of PTSD, while being wounded or injured in combat was associated a 23.9 percentage point increase in the likelihood of a PTSD diagnosis. For the 2.16&amp;nbsp;million U.S. troops deployed in combat zones between 2001 and 2010, the total estimated two-year costs of treatment for combat-related PTSD are between $1.54&amp;nbsp;billion and $2.69&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/federalstate/psychological-costs-war-military-combat-mental-health/ |title=Psychological Costs of War: Military Combat and Mental Health |publisher=Journalistsresource.org |access-date=2014-01-29 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202140609/http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/federalstate/psychological-costs-war-military-combat-mental-health/ |archive-date=2014-02-02 |df= |date=2012-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost 50% of World Trade Center workers who self-identified as alcohol users reported drinking more during the rescue efforts.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Nearly a quarter of these individuals reported drinking more following the recovery.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; If determined to have probable PTSD status, the risk of developing an alcohol problem was double compared to those without psychological [[morbidity]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Social disability was also studied in this cohort as a social consequence of the September 11 attacks. Defined by the disruption of family, work, and social life, the risk of developing social disability increased 17-fold when categorized as having probable PTSD.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== History ==
The 1952 edition of the DSM-I includes a diagnosis of "gross stress reaction", which has similarities to the modern definition and understanding of PTSD.&lt;ref name="Posttraumatic stress disorder: a history and a critique"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Andreasen NC | title = Posttraumatic stress disorder: a history and a critique | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1208 | issue = Psychiatric and Neurologic Aspects of War | pages = 67–71 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20955327 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2010.05699.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gross stress reaction is defined as a "normal personality [utilizing] established patterns of reaction to deal with overwhelming fear" as a response to "conditions of great stress".&lt;ref name= "DSM-I"&gt;{{cite book|last1=American Psychiatric Association|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual|date=1952|publisher=American Psychiatric Association Mental Hospital Service|isbn=978-0890420171|page=326.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diagnosis includes language which relates the condition to combat as well as to "civilian catastrophe".&lt;ref name=DSM-I /&gt;

Early in 1978, the term was used in a working group finding presented to the Committee of Reactive Disorders.&lt;ref name=IHHRT /&gt; The condition was added to the [[DSM-III]], which was being developed in the 1980s, as posttraumatic stress disorder.&lt;ref name="Posttraumatic stress disorder: a history and a critique" /&gt;&lt;ref name=IHHRT&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Shalev | first1 = Arieh Y. | last2 = Yehuda | first2 = Rachel | first3 = Alexander C. | last3 = McFarlane | name-list-format = vanc  |title=International handbook of human response to trauma |publisher=Kluwer Academic/Plenum Press |location=New York |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=978-0-306-46095-1}}{{page needed|date=January 2014}};[https://web.archive.org/web/20070617045846/http://www.istss.org/what/history2.cfm on-line].&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[DSM-IV]], the spelling "posttraumatic stress disorder" is used, while in the [[ICD-10]], the spelling is "post-traumatic stress disorder".&lt;ref name=icd10-2007&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online2007/index.htm?gf40.htm+F431 |title=International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision Version for 2007 |publisher=World Health Organization (UN) |year=2007 |access-date=October 3, 2011 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205050052/http://apps.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online2007/index.htm?gf40.htm+F431 |archive-date=December 5, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The addition of the term to the DSM-III was greatly influenced by the experiences and conditions of U.S. military veterans of the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="AllInTheMind"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/allinthemind/stories/2004/1214098.htm |title=When trauma tips you over: PTSD Part 1 |series=All in the Mind |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Commission |date=9 October 2004 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603155139/http://www.abc.net.au/rn/allinthemind/stories/2004/1214098.htm |archive-date=3 June 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its association with the war in Vietnam, PTSD has become synonymous with many historical war-time diagnoses such as [[railway spine]], stress syndrome, [[homesickness|nostalgia]], soldier's heart, [[shell shock]], [[Combat stress reaction|battle fatigue]], [[combat stress reaction]], or traumatic war neurosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Brave New Brain: Conquering Mental Illness in the Era of the Genome |last=Andreasen |first=Nancy C. |authorlink=Nancy Coover Andreasen |date=Feb 19, 2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-516728-3 |page=303}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Joshua A. 2013, VOL. 5 NO. 02 pp. 1–3.

The correlations between combat and PTSD are undeniable; according to Stéphane Audoin-Rouzeau and Annette Becker, "One-tenth of mobilized American men were hospitalized for mental disturbances between 1942 and 1945, and, after thirty-five days of uninterrupted combat, 98% of them manifested psychiatric disturbances in varying degrees."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ralphmag.org/CG/world-war-one2.html World War One – A New Kind of War | Part II] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303191857/http://www.ralphmag.org/CG/world-war-one2.html |date=2016-03-03 }}, From ''14 – 18 Understanding the Great War'', by Stéphane Audoin-Rouzeau, Annette Becker{{incomplete short citation|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, much of the available published research regarding PTSD is based on studies done on veterans of the war in Vietnam.  A study based on personal letters from soldiers of the 18th-century [[Prussian Army]] concludes that combatants may have had PTSD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Im Kugelhagel der Musketen |language=German |first=Sascha |last=Möbius |magazine=[[Damals]] |pages=64–69 |volume=47 |issue=12 |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aspects of PTSD in soldiers of ancient [[Assyria]] have been identified using written sources from 1300–600 BCE. These Assyrian soldiers would undergo a three-year rotation of combat before being allowed to return home, and were purported to have faced immense challenges in reconciling their past actions in war with their civilian lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/ancient-assyrian-soldiers-were-haunted-war-too-180954022/ | title=Ancient Assyrian Soldiers Were Haunted by War, Too}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connections between the actions of Viking [[berserkers]] and the hyperarousal of post-traumatic stress disorder have also been drawn.&lt;ref&gt;Shay, J. (2000). "Killing rage: physis or nomos—or both" pp. 31–56 in ''War and Violence in Ancient Greece''. Duckworth and the Classical Press of Wales. {{ISBN|0715630466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The researchers from the Grady Trauma Project highlight the tendency people have to focus on the combat side of PTSD: "less public awareness has focused on civilian PTSD, which results from trauma exposure that is not combat related... " and "much of the research on civilian PTSD has focused on the sequelae of a single, disastrous event, such as the [[Oklahoma City bombing]], [[September 11th attacks]], and [[Hurricane Katrina]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Civilian PTSD Symptoms and Risk for Involvement in the Criminal Justice System|journal=Journal of the Academy of Psychiatry and the Law|date=2012-12-01|volume=40|issue=4|pages=522–529|url=http://www.jaapl.org/content/40/4/522.full?sid=b7a23ae3-d147-48af-b8fc-310fa08605e7|access-date=2014-11-29|issn=1093-6793}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disparity in the focus of PTSD research affects the already popular perception of the exclusive interconnectedness of combat and PTSD. This is misleading when it comes to understanding the implications and extent of PTSD as a neurological disorder.  Dating back to the definition of Gross stress reaction in the DSM-I, civilian experience of catastrophic or high stress events is included as a cause of PTSD in medical literature. The 2014 National Comorbidity Survey reports that "the traumas most commonly associated with PTSD are combat exposure and witnessing among men and rape and sexual molestation among women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kessler RC, Sonnega A, Bromet E, Hughes M, Nelson CB | title = Posttraumatic stress disorder in the National Comorbidity Survey | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 52 | issue = 12 | pages = 1048–60 | date = December 1995 | pmid = 7492257 | doi = 10.1001/archpsyc.1995.03950240066012 | url = http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=497313 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141204123835/http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=497313 | df =  | deadurl = no | archive-date = 2014-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Because of the initial overt focus on PTSD as a combat related disorder when it was first fleshed out in the years following the war in Vietnam, in 1975 Ann Wolbert Burgess and Lynda Lytle Holmstrom defined Rape trauma syndrome, RTS, in order to draw attention to the striking similarities between the experiences of soldiers returning from war and of rape victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holmstrom|first1=Lynda Lyttle|last2=Burgess|first2=Ann Wolbert | name-list-format = vanc |title=The Victim of Rape: Institutional Reactions|publisher=Wiley-Interscience|isbn=978-0471407850|year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; This paved the way for a more comprehensive understanding of causes of PTSD.

After PTSD became an official psychiatric diagnosis with the publication of DSM-III (1980), the number of [[Personal injury|personal injury lawsuits]] ([[Tort|tort claims]]) asserting the plaintiff suffered from PTSD increased rapidly. However, [[Trier of fact|triers of fact]] (judges and juries) often regarded the PTSD diagnostic criteria as imprecise, a view shared by legal scholars, trauma specialists, [[forensic psychology|forensic psychologists]], and [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrists]]. Professional discussions and debates in academic journals, at conferences, and between thought leaders, led to a more clearly-defined set of diagnostic criteria in DSM-IV, particularly the definition of a "traumatic event".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/ptsd-traumatic-principle-and-lawsuits|title=PTSD, the Traumatic Principle and Lawsuits|work=Psychiatric Times|author-first=C.B.|author-last=Scrignar|language=en|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DSM-IV classified PTSD under anxiety disorders, but the DSM-5 created a new category called "Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders," in which PTSD is now classified.&lt;ref name="DSM5" /&gt;

== Terminology ==
The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] does not hyphenate 'post' and 'traumatic', thus, the [[DSM-5]] lists the disorder as ''posttraumatic stress disorder''. However, many scientific journal articles and other scholarly publications do hyphenate the name of the disorder, ''viz.'', post-traumatic stress disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Search results: 'post-traumatic stress disorder' in the title of a journal article|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=post-traumatic%20stress%20disorder%5BTitle%5D|publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine|access-date=21 January 2015|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514050330/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=post-traumatic%20stress%20disorder%5BTitle%5D|archive-date=14 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dictionaries also differ with regard to the preferred spelling of the disorder with the ''Collins English Dictionary - Complete and Unabridged'' using the hyphenated spelling, and the ''American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fifth Edition'' and the ''Random House Kernerman Webster's College Dictionary'' giving the non-hyphenated spelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PTSD|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/PTSD|website=[[TheFreeDictionary.com]]|publisher=Farlex, Inc.|access-date=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some at the Pentagon have used the terminology "PTSS" (syndrome instead of disorder, to avoid connotation of stigma), or just "PTS."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Thompson |first1=Mark |title=The Disappearing "Disorder": Why PTSD is becoming PTS |url=http://nation.time.com/2011/06/05/the-disappearing-disorder-why-ptsd-is-becoming-pts/ |accessdate=3 October 2018 |work=Time |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Most knowledge regarding PTSD comes from studies in high-income countries.&lt;ref name="FodorUnterhitzenberger2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fodor KE, Unterhitzenberger J, Chou CY, Kartal D, Leistner S, Milosavljevic M, Nocon A, Soler L, White J, Yoo S, Alisic E | title = Is traumatic stress research global?

To recapitulate some of the neurological and neurobehavioral symptoms experienced by the [[veteran]] population of recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, researchers at the [[Roskamp Institute]] and the James A Haley Veteran's Hospital (Tampa) have developed an animal model to study the consequences of [[mild traumatic brain injury]] (mTBI) and PTSD.&lt;ref name="Ojo2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ojo JO, Greenberg MB, Leary P, Mouzon B, Bachmeier C, Mullan M, Diamond DM, Crawford F | title = Neurobehavioral, neuropathological and biochemical profiles in a novel mouse model of co-morbid post-traumatic stress disorder and mild traumatic brain injury | journal = Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience | volume = 8 | pages = 213 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25002839 | pmc = 4067099 | doi = 10.3389/fnbeh.2014.00213 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the laboratory, the researchers exposed mice to a repeated session of unpredictable stressor (i.e. predator odor while restrained), and physical trauma in the form of inescapable foot-shock, and this was also combined with a mTBI. In this study, PTSD animals demonstrated recall of traumatic memories, anxiety, and an impaired social behavior, while animals subject to both mTBI and PTSD had a pattern of disinhibitory-like behavior. mTBI abrogated both contextual fear and impairments in social behavior seen in PTSD animals. In comparison with other animal studies,&lt;ref name="Ojo2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Poulos 2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Poulos AM, Reger M, Mehta N, Zhuravka I, Sterlace SS, Gannam C, Hovda DA, Giza CC, Fanselow MS | title = Amnesia for early life stress does not preclude the adult development of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms in rats | journal = Biological Psychiatry | volume = 76 | issue = 4 | pages = 306–14 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 24231200 | pmc = 3984614 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsych.2013.10.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; examination of [[Neuroendocrine cell|neuroendocrine]] and [[neuroimmune system|neuroimmune]] responses in plasma revealed a trend toward increase in [[corticosterone]] in PTSD and combination groups.

=== Psychotherapy adjuncts ===
[[MDMA]] was used for [[psychedelic therapy]] for a variety of indications before its criminalization in the U.S. in 1985. In response to its criminalization, the [[Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies]] was founded as a nonprofit drug-development organization to develop MDMA into a legal prescription drug for use as an adjunct in psychotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Emerson A, Ponté L, Jerome L, Doblin R | title = History and future of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) | journal = Journal of Psychoactive Drugs | volume = 46 | issue = 1 | pages = 27–36 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24830183 | doi = 10.1080/02791072.2014.877321 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The drug is hypothesized to facilitate psychotherapy by reducing fear, thereby allowing people to reprocess and accept their traumatic memories without becoming emotionally overwhelmed. In this treatment, people participate in an extended psychotherapy session during the acute activity of the drug, and then spend the night at the treatment facility. In the sessions with the drug, therapists are not directive and support the patients in exploring their inner experiences. People participate in standard psychotherapy sessions before the drug-assisted sessions, as well as after the drug-assisted psychotherapy to help them integrate their experiences with the drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Manual for MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy in the Treatment of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder |publisher=[[Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies]] |date=4 January 2013 |url=http://www.maps.org/research/mdma/MDMA-Assisted_Psychotherapy_Treatment_Manual_Version_6_FINAL.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912081631/http://www.maps.org/research/mdma/MDMA-Assisted_Psychotherapy_Treatment_Manual_Version_6_FINAL.pdf |archive-date=2014-09-12 |access-date=31 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The phase 2 clinical trails of the MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy, was publicized at the end of November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/29/us/ptsd-mdma-ecstasy.html|title=F.D.A.

'''RMS ''Titanic''''' was a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[superliner (passenger ship)|passenger liner]] that [[Sinking of the RMS Titanic|sank in the North Atlantic Ocean]] in the early hours of 15 April 1912, after colliding with an [[iceberg]] during her [[maiden voyage]] from [[Southampton]] to [[New York City]]. There were an [[Sinking of the RMS Titanic#Casualties and survivors|estimated 2,224 passengers and crew]] aboard, and more than 1,500 died, making it one of the deadliest commercial [[List of maritime disasters in the 20th century#Peacetime disasters|peacetime maritime disasters]] in modern history. [[Royal Mail Ship|RMS]] ''Titanic'' was the [[List of world's longest ships|largest ship afloat]] at the time she entered service and was the second of three {{sclass-|Olympic|ocean liner|1}}s operated by the [[White Star Line]]. She was built by the [[Harland and Wolff]] shipyard in [[Belfast]]. [[Thomas Andrews (shipbuilder)|Thomas Andrews]], her architect, died in the disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Official investigation report - the sinking of RMS Titanic|publisher=The final board of inquiry|location=London|edition=1|url=http://www.sshsa.org/media/splash/TheFinalBoardofInquiry.pdf|accessdate=27 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171031070441/http://www.sshsa.org/media/splash/TheFinalBoardofInquiry.pdf|archive-date=31 October 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Titanic'' was under the command of Capt. [[Edward Smith (sea captain)|Edward Smith]], who also [[The captain goes down with the ship|went down with the ship]]. The ocean liner carried some of the wealthiest people in the world, as well as hundreds of emigrants from [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain and Ireland]], [[Scandinavia]] and elsewhere throughout Europe who were seeking a new life in the United States. The first-class accommodation was designed to be the pinnacle of comfort and luxury, with an on-board gymnasium, swimming pool, libraries, high-class restaurants and opulent cabins. A high-powered [[wireless telegraphy|radiotelegraph transmitter]] was available for sending passenger "marconigrams" and for the ship's operational use.&lt;ref&gt;Hsu, J. (17 April 2012). "How Marconi's Wireless Tech Helped Save Titanic Passengers", New York: NBC NEWS. Assessed at: http://www.nbcnews.com/id/47046053/ns/technology_and_science-innovation/t/how-marconis-wireless-tech-helped-save-titanic-passengers/#.WgSS4Fu3z3g&lt;/ref&gt; Although ''Titanic'' had advanced safety features such as watertight compartments and remotely activated watertight doors, it only carried enough [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]] for 1,178 people—about half the number on board, and one third of her total capacity—due to outdated maritime safety regulations. The ship carried 16 lifeboat [[davit]]s which could lower three lifeboats each, for a total of 48 boats. However, ''Titanic'' carried only a total of 20 lifeboats, four of which were collapsible and proved hard to launch during the sinking.&lt;ref&gt;Vander Hook, S. (2008). Titanic. Edina, Minnesota: ABDO Publishing Company., p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving Southampton on 10 April 1912, ''Titanic'' called at [[Cherbourg]] in France and Queenstown (now [[Cobh]]) in Ireland before heading west to New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Titanic Ship Listing |url=http://www.chriscunard.com/titanic.php |publisher=Chris' Cunard Page |accessdate=12 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415195436/http://www.chriscunard.com/titanic.php |archivedate=15 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 April, four days into the crossing and about {{convert|375|mi|abbr=out|sigfig=2}} south of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], she hit an iceberg at 11:40&amp;nbsp;p.m. ship's time. The collision caused the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] plates to buckle inwards along her [[Port and starboard|starboard]] (right) side and opened five of her sixteen watertight [[Compartment (ship)|compartments]] to the sea; she could only survive four flooding. Meanwhile, passengers and some crew members were evacuated in lifeboats, many of which were launched only partially loaded. A disproportionate number of men were left aboard because of a "[[women and children first]]" protocol for loading lifeboats.&lt;ref&gt;Second Officer Lightoller insisted on excluding men, while First Officer Murdoch, on the other side of the ship, permitted men and women to board the lifeboats.&lt;/ref&gt; At 2:20&amp;nbsp;a.m., she broke apart and foundered with well over one thousand people still aboard. Just under two hours after ''Titanic'' sank, the Cunard liner {{RMS|Carpathia}} arrived and brought aboard an estimated 705 survivors.

The disaster was met with worldwide shock and outrage at the huge loss of life and the regulatory and operational failures that led to it. Public inquiries in Britain and the United States led to [[Changes in safety practices after the sinking of the RMS Titanic|major improvements in maritime safety]]. One of their most important legacies was the establishment in 1914 of the [[International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea]] (SOLAS), which still governs maritime safety today. Additionally, several new wireless regulations were passed around the world in an effort to learn from the many missteps in wireless communications—which could have saved many more passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2110509 |title=Patrick S. Ryan, The ITU and the Internet's Titanic Moment |date= 18 July 2012 |accessdate=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Wreck of the RMS Titanic|wreck of ''Titanic'']] was discovered in 1985 (more than 70&amp;nbsp;years after the disaster), and remains on the seabed. The ship was split in two and is gradually disintegrating at a depth of {{convert|12415|ft|m}}. Thousands of artefacts&lt;!-- ARTEFACTS is the correct spelling in British English --&gt; have been recovered and displayed at museums around the world. ''Titanic'' has become one of the most famous ships in history; her memory is kept alive by numerous [[RMS Titanic in popular culture|works of popular culture, including books, folk songs, films, exhibits, and memorials]]. ''Titanic'' is the second largest ocean liner wreck in the world, only beaten by her sister {{HMHS|Britannic}}, the largest ever sunk, although she holds the record as the largest sunk while actually in service as a liner due to ''Britannic'' being used as a [[hospital ship]] at the time of her sinking. The final survivor of the sinking, [[Millvina Dean]], aged two months at the time, died in 2009 at the age of 97.

== Background ==
The name ''Titanic'' was derived [[Titan (mythology)|from Greek mythology]] and meant 'gigantic'. Built in Belfast, Ireland, in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] (as it was then known)&lt;!--DO NOT ALTER, Northern Ireland did not exist in 1912!--&gt;, the [[Royal Mail Ship|RMS]] ''Titanic'' was the second of the three {{sclass-|Olympic|ocean liner|1}}s—the first was the {{RMS|Olympic}} and the third was the {{HMHS|Britannic}}.{{sfn|Chirnside|2004|p=319}} Britannic was originally to be called Gigantic and was to be over 1,000 feet long.&lt;ref&gt;[https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045433/1911-11-08/ed-1/seq-1/#date1=1911&amp;sort=relevance&amp;rows=20&amp;words=Titanic&amp;searchType=basic&amp;sequence=0&amp;index=12&amp;state=&amp;date2=1911&amp;protext=Titanic&amp;y=0&amp;x=0&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=2 The Washington Herald] November 8, 1911...[White Star places order for Gigantic carried on front page of The Washington Herald&lt;/ref&gt; They were by far the largest vessels of the British shipping company [[White Star Line]]'s fleet, which comprised 29 steamers and tenders in 1912.{{sfn|Beveridge|Hall|2011|p=27}} The three ships had their genesis in a discussion in mid-1907 between the White Star Line's chairman, [[J. Bruce Ismay]], and the American financier [[J. P. Morgan]], who controlled the White Star Line's parent corporation, the [[International Mercantile Marine Co.]] (IMM).

The White Star Line faced an increasing challenge from its main rivals [[Cunard Line|Cunard]], which had recently launched the {{RMS|Lusitania||2}} and the {{RMS|Mauretania|1906|2}}—the fastest passenger ships then in service—and the German lines [[Hamburg America Line|Hamburg America]] and [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]]. Ismay preferred to compete on size rather than speed and proposed to commission a new class of liners that would be larger than anything that had gone before as well as being the last word in comfort and luxury.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=26}} The company sought an upgrade in their fleet primarily in response to the Cunard giants but also to replace their oldest pair of passenger ships still in service, being the {{SS|Teutonic}} of 1889 and {{SS|Majestic|1890|6}} of 1890. ''Teutonic'' was replaced by ''Olympic'' while ''Majestic'' was replaced by ''Titanic''. ''Majestic'' would be brought back into her old spot on White Star's New York service after ''Titanic'''s loss.&lt;ref name="SS Majestic Back in Service"&gt;{{cite news|title=Outgoing Steamships – Sail Saturday October 26, 1912: Majestic (Southampton)|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030272/1912-10-24/ed-1/seq-15/#date1=1912&amp;index=8&amp;rows=20&amp;words=Majestic+Ss&amp;searchType=basic&amp;sequence=0&amp;state=&amp;date2=1912&amp;proxtext=SS+Majestic&amp;y=11&amp;x=18&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=1|accessdate=18 May 2015|newspaper=The Sun|date=24 October 1912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ships were constructed by the Belfast shipbuilders [[Harland and Wolff]], who had a long-established relationship with the White Star Line dating back to 1867.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=25}} Harland and Wolff were given a great deal of latitude in designing ships for the White Star Line; the usual approach was for the latter to sketch out a general concept which the former would take away and turn into a ship design. Cost considerations were relatively low on the agenda and Harland and Wolff was authorised to spend what it needed on the ships, plus a five percent profit margin.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=25}} In the case of the ''Olympic''-class ships, a cost of £3 million (£250 million in 2015 money) for the first two ships was agreed plus "extras to contract" and the usual five percent fee.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=12}}

Harland and Wolff put their leading designers to work designing the ''Olympic''-class vessels. The design was overseen by [[William Pirrie, 1st Viscount Pirrie|Lord Pirrie]], a director of both Harland and Wolff and the White Star Line; [[Naval architecture|naval architect]] [[Thomas Andrews (shipbuilder)|Thomas Andrews]], the managing director of Harland and Wolff's design department; Edward Wilding, Andrews' deputy and responsible for calculating the ship's design, stability and trim; and [[Alexander Carlisle]], the shipyard's chief draughtsman and general manager.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=14}} Carlisle's responsibilities included the decorations, equipment and all general arrangements, including the implementation of an efficient [[lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] [[davit]] design.{{efn|Carlisle would leave the project in 1910, before the ships were launched, when he became a shareholder in [[Axel Welin|Welin Davit &amp; Engineering Company Ltd]], the firm making the ship's davits.&lt;ref name="TIPCarlisle"/&gt; Wilding was sacked following the ''Titanic'' disaster, having apparently been blamed by Pirrie, unfairly, for the ship's loss.{{sfn|McCluskie|1998|p=20}}}}

On 29 July 1908, Harland and Wolff presented the drawings to J. Bruce Ismay and other White Star Line executives. Ismay approved the design and signed three "letters of agreement" two days later, authorising the start of construction.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=55}} At this point the first ship—which was later to become ''Olympic''—had no name, but was referred to simply as "Number 400", as it was Harland and Wolff's four hundredth hull. ''Titanic'' was based on a revised version of the same design and was given the number 401.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=56}}

== Dimensions and layout ==
[[File:Cd51-1000g.gif|right|thumb|400px|''Titanic'' in 1912]]
''Titanic'' was {{convert|882|ft|9|in|m}} long with a maximum breadth of {{convert|92|ft|6|in|m}}. Her total height, measured from the base of the keel to the top of the bridge, was {{convert|104|ft|m}}.{{sfn|McCluskie|1998|p=22}} She measured 46,328 [[gross register tonnage|gross register tons]] and with a draught of {{convert|34|ft|7|in|m}}, she displaced 52,310 tons.{{sfn|Chirnside|2004|p=efn319}}

All three of the ''Olympic''-class ships had ten decks (excluding the top of the officers' quarters), eight of which were for passenger use. From top to bottom, the decks were:
* '''The Boat Deck''', on which the lifeboats were housed. It was from here during the early hours of 15 April 1912 that ''Titanic''{{-'}}s lifeboats were lowered into the North Atlantic. The bridge and wheelhouse were at the forward end, in front of the captain's and officers' quarters. The bridge stood {{convert|8|ft|m}} above the deck, extending out to either side so that the ship could be controlled while docking. The wheelhouse stood directly behind and above the bridge. The entrance to the First Class [[Grand Staircase of the RMS Titanic|Grand Staircase]] and gymnasium were located midships along with the raised roof of the First Class lounge, while at the rear of the deck were the roof of the First Class smoke room and the relatively modest Second Class entrance. The wood-covered deck was divided into four segregated promenades: for officers, First Class passengers, engineers, and Second Class passengers respectively. Lifeboats lined the side of the deck except in the First Class area, where there was a gap so that the view would not be spoiled.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=47}}{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=229}}
* '''A Deck''', also called the '''Promenade Deck''', extended along the entire {{convert|546|ft|m}} length of the [[superstructure]]. It was reserved exclusively for First Class passengers and contained First Class cabins, the First Class lounge, smoke room, reading and writing rooms and Palm Court.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=47}}
* '''B Deck''', the '''Bridge Deck''', was the top weight-bearing deck and the uppermost level of the hull. More First Class passenger accommodations were located here with six palatial staterooms (cabins) featuring their own private promenades. On ''Titanic'', the ''À La Carte'' Restaurant and the Café Parisien provided luxury dining facilities to First Class passengers. Both were run by subcontracted chefs and their staff; all were lost in the disaster. The Second Class smoking room and entrance hall were both located on this deck. The raised forecastle of the ship was forward of the Bridge Deck, accommodating Number 1 hatch (the main hatch through to the cargo holds), numerous pieces of machinery and the anchor housings.{{efn|It was kept off-limits to passengers; the famous "flying" scene at the ship's bow from the 1997 film ''Titanic'' would not have been permitted in real life.}} Aft of the Bridge Deck was the raised Poop Deck, {{convert|106|ft|m}} long, used as a promenade by Third Class passengers. It was where many of ''Titanic''{{-'}}s passengers and crew made their last stand as the ship sank. The forecastle and Poop Deck were separated from the Bridge Deck by [[well deck]]s.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=48}}{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=232}}
* '''C Deck''', the '''Shelter Deck''', was the highest deck to run uninterrupted from stem to stern. It included both well decks; the aft one served as part of the Third Class promenade. Crew cabins were housed below the forecastle and Third Class public rooms were housed below the Poop Deck. In between were the majority of First Class cabins and the Second Class library.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=48}}{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=233}}
* '''D Deck''', the '''Saloon Deck''', was dominated by three large public rooms—the First Class Reception Room, the First Class Dining Saloon and the Second Class Dining Saloon. An open space was provided for Third Class passengers. First, Second and Third Class passengers had cabins on this deck, with berths for firemen located in the bow. It was the highest level reached by the ship's watertight bulkheads (though only by eight of the fifteen bulkheads).{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=48}}{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=235}}
* '''E Deck''', the '''Upper Deck''', was predominantly used for passenger accommodation for all three classes plus berths for cooks, seamen, stewards and [[coal trimmer|trimmers]]. Along its length ran a long passageway nicknamed [[Scotland Road]], in reference to a famous street in Liverpool. Scotland Road was used by Third Class passengers and crew members.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=48}}{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=236}}
* '''F Deck''', the '''Middle Deck''', was the last complete deck and mainly accommodated Second and Third Class passengers and several departments of the crew. The Third Class dining saloon was located here, as were the swimming pool, [[Turkish bath]] and kennels.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=48}}{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=236}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Eveleth |first1=Rose |title=The Definitive Guide to the Dogs on the Titanic |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/definitive-guide-dogs-titanic-180950319/ |website=Smithsonian |accessdate=17 October 2018 |language=en |date=March 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''G Deck''', the '''Lower Deck''', was the lowest complete deck that carried passengers, and had the lowest portholes, just above the waterline. The squash court was located here along with the traveling post office where letters and parcels were sorted ready for delivery when the ship docked. Food was also stored here. The deck was interrupted at several points by [[orlop]] (partial) decks over the boiler, engine and turbine rooms.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=48}}{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=237}}
* The '''Orlop Decks''' and the '''Tank Top''' below that were on the lowest level of the ship, below the waterline. The orlop decks were used as cargo spaces, while the Tank Top—the inner bottom of the ship's hull—provided the platform on which the ship's boilers, engines, turbines and electrical generators were housed. This area of the ship was occupied by the engine and boiler rooms, areas which passengers would have been prohibited from seeing. They were connected with higher levels of the ship by flights of stairs; twin spiral stairways near the bow provided access up to D Deck.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=48}}{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=237}}

In the source cited below {{sfn|Beveridge|2008|p=100}} this photograph is identified as Olympic (and Beveridge is highly reliable!).

''Titanic'' was equipped with three main engines—two [[reciprocating engine|reciprocating]] four-[[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]], [[triple-expansion]] [[steam engine]]s and one centrally placed low-pressure [[steam turbine|Parsons turbine]]—each driving a [[propeller (marine)|propeller]]. The two reciprocating engines had a combined output of 30,000&amp;nbsp;hp. The output of the steam turbine was 16,000&amp;nbsp;hp.{{sfn|McCluskie|1998|p=22}} The White Star Line had used the same combination of engines on an earlier liner, the {{SS|Laurentic|1908|6}}, where it had been a great success.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=120}} It provided a good combination of performance and speed; reciprocating engines by themselves were not powerful enough to propel an ''Olympic''-class liner at the desired speeds, while turbines were sufficiently powerful but caused uncomfortable vibrations, a problem that affected the all-turbine Cunard liners {{RMS|Lusitania||2}} and {{RMS|Mauretania|1906|2}}.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=121}} By combining reciprocating engines with a turbine, fuel usage could be reduced and motive power increased, while using the same amount of steam.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=79}}

The two reciprocating engines were each {{convert|63|ft|m}} long and weighed 720 tons, with their bedplates contributing a further 195 tons.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=121}} They were powered by steam produced in 29 boilers, 24 of which were double-ended and five single-ended, which contained a total of 159 furnaces.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=80}} The boilers were {{convert|15|ft|9|in|m}} in diameter and {{convert|20|ft|m}} long, each weighing 91.5 tons and capable of holding 48.5 tons of water.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=126}}

They were heated by burning coal, 6,611 tons of which could be carried in ''Titanic''{{-'}}s bunkers, with a further 1,092 tons in Hold 3. The furnaces required over 600 tons of coal a day to be shovelled into them by hand, requiring the services of 176 [[Fireman (steam engine)|firemen]] working around the clock.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=148}} 100 tons of ash a day had to be disposed of by ejecting it into the sea.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=86}} The work was relentless, dirty and dangerous, and although firemen were paid relatively generously{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=148}} there was a high suicide rate among those who worked in that capacity.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=85}}

Exhaust steam leaving the reciprocating engines was fed into the turbine, which was situated aft. From there it passed into a [[surface condenser]], to increase the efficiency of the turbine and so that the steam could be condensed back into water and reused.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=96}} The engines were attached directly to long shafts which drove the propellers. There were three, one for each engine; the outer (or wing) propellers were the largest, each carrying three blades of manganese-bronze alloy with a total diameter of {{convert|23.5|ft|m}}.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=126}} The middle propeller was slightly smaller at {{convert|17|ft|m}} in diameter,{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=127}} and could be stopped but not reversed.

''Titanic''{{-'}}s electrical plant was capable of producing more power than an average city power station of the time.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=74}} Immediately aft of the turbine engine were four 400&amp;nbsp;kW steam-driven electric generators, used to provide electrical power to the ship, plus two 30&amp;nbsp;kW auxiliary generators for emergency use.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=106}} Their location in the stern of the ship meant they remained operational until the last few minutes before the ship sank.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=107}}

=== Technology ===

==== Watertight compartments and funnels ====
The interiors of the ''Olympic''-class ships were subdivided into 16 primary [[Compartment (ship)|compartments]] divided by 15 bulkheads which extended well above the waterline. Eleven vertically closing watertight doors could seal off the compartments in the event of an emergency.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=44}} The ship's exposed decking was made of pine and teak, while interior ceilings were covered in painted granulated [[cork (material)|cork]] to combat condensation.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=104}} Standing above the decks were four funnels, each painted buff with black tops, (though only three were functional—the last one was a dummy, installed for aesthetic purposes and also for kitchen ventilation)—and two masts, each {{convert|155|ft|m}} high, which supported derricks for working cargo.

==== Rudder and steering engines ====
''Titanic''{{-'}}s rudder was so large—at {{convert|78|ft|8|in|m}} high and {{convert|15|ft|3|in|m}} long, weighing over 100 tons—that it required [[steering engine]]s to move it. Two steam-powered steering engines were installed though only one was used at any one time, with the other one kept in reserve. They were connected to the short [[tiller]] through stiff springs, to isolate the steering engines from any shocks in heavy seas or during fast changes of direction.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=68}} As a last resort, the tiller could be moved by ropes connected to two steam [[Capstan (nautical)|capstans]].{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=70}} The capstans were also used to raise and lower the ship's five anchors (one port, one starboard, one in the centreline and two [[Anchor#Kedging|kedging anchors]]).{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=70}}

==== Water, ventilation and heating ====
The ship was equipped with her own waterworks, capable of heating and pumping water to all parts of the vessel via a complex network of pipes and valves. The main water supply was taken aboard while ''Titanic'' was in port, but in an emergency the ship could also distil fresh water from seawater, though this was not a straightforward process as the distillation plant quickly became clogged by salt deposits. A network of insulated ducts conveyed warm air, driven by electric fans, around the ship, and First Class cabins were fitted with additional electric heaters.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=74}}

==== Radio communications ====
[[File:1913 Marconi operator room for 5 kilowatt ocean liner station.JPG|thumb|250px|Marconi company receiving equipment for a 5 kilowatt ocean liner station.]]

''Titanic'''s radiotelegraph equipment (then known as [[wireless telegraphy]]) was leased to the White Star Line by the [[Marconi Company|Marconi International Marine Communication Company]], which also supplied two of its employees, [[Jack Phillips (wireless officer)|Jack Phillips]] and [[Harold Bride]], as operators. The service maintained a 24-hour schedule, primarily sending and receiving passenger telegrams, but also handling navigation messages including weather reports and ice warnings.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=162}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beveridge|first1=Bruce|last2=Andrews|first2=Scott|last3=Hall|first3=Steve|last4=Klistorner|first4=Daniel|editor-last=Braunschweiger|editor-first=Art |title=Titanic : the ship magnificent|volume=Volume one: Design &amp; construction|date=2008|publisher=History Press|location=Stroud, Gloucestershire|isbn=978-0752446066|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hsu, J. (17 April 2012) "How Marconi's Wireless Tech Helped Save Titanic Passengers," New York: NBC News. Accessed on 11/9/17 at: http://www.nbcnews.com/id/47046053/ns/technology_and_science-innovation/t/how-marconis-wireless-tech-helped-save-titanic-passengers/#.WgSS4Fu3z3g&lt;/ref&gt;

The radio room was located on the Boat Deck, in the officers' quarters. A soundproofed "Silent Room", next to the operating room, housed loud equipment, including the transmitter and a motor-generator used for producing alternating currents. The operators' living quarters were adjacent to the working office. The ship was equipped with a 'state of the art' 5&amp;nbsp;kilowatt rotary [[spark-gap transmitter]], operating under the radio callsign MGY, and communication was conducted in [[Morse code]]. This transmitter was one of the first Marconi installations to use a rotary spark gap, which gave ''Titanic'' a distinctive musical tone that could be readily distinguished from other signals. The transmitter was one of the most powerful in the world, and guaranteed to broadcast over a radius of {{convert|350|mi|0|abbr=out}}. An elevated [[T-antenna]] that spanned the length of the ship was used for transmitting and receiving. The normal operating frequency was 500&amp;nbsp;kHz (600 m wavelength), however the equipment could also operate on the "short" wavelength of 1,000&amp;nbsp;kHz (300 m wavelength) that was employed by smaller vessels with shorter antennas.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=165}}

=== Passenger facilities ===
{{further|First class facilities of the RMS Titanic|Second and Third-class facilities on the RMS Titanic}}
{{refimprove section|date=April 2017}}
The passenger facilities aboard ''Titanic'' aimed to meet the highest standards of luxury. According to ''Titanic''{{'}}s general arrangement plans, the ship could accommodate 833 First Class Passengers, 614 in Second Class and 1,006 in Third Class, for a total passenger capacity of 2,453. In addition, her capacity for crew members exceeded 900, as most documents of her original configuration have stated that her full carrying capacity for both passengers and crew was approximately 3,547. Her interior design was a departure from that of other passenger liners, which had typically been decorated in the rather heavy style of a [[manor house]] or an [[English country house]].{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=57}}

''Titanic'' was laid out in a much lighter style similar to that of contemporary high-class hotels—the [[The Ritz London Hotel|Ritz Hotel]] was a reference point—with First Class cabins finished in the [[Empire style]].{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=57}} A variety of other decorative styles, ranging from the [[Renaissance]] to [[Louis XV Style|Louis XV]], were used to decorate cabins and public rooms in First and Second Class areas of the ship. The aim was to convey an impression that the passengers were in a floating hotel rather than a ship; as one passenger recalled, on entering the ship's interior a passenger would "at once lose the feeling that we are on board ship, and seem instead to be entering the hall of some great house on shore".{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=182}}

Among the more novel features available to first-class passengers was a 7&amp;nbsp;ft. deep saltwater swimming pool, a gymnasium, a [[squash (sport)|squash]] court, and a [[Turkish bath]] which comprised [[electric bath]], steam room, cool room, massage room, and hot room.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=182}} First-class common rooms were impressive in scope and lavishly decorated. They included a Lounge in the style of the [[Palace of Versailles]], an enormous Reception Room, a men's Smoking Room, and a Reading and Writing Room. There was an À la Carte Restaurant in the style of the [[The Ritz Hotel, London|Ritz Hotel]] which was run as a concession by the famous Italian restaurateur [[Luigi Gatti (businessman)|Gaspare Gatti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-victim/gaspare-antonio-pietro-gatti.html|title=Gaspare Antonio Pietro Gatti : Titanic Victim|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''Café Parisien'' decorated in the style of a French sidewalk café, complete with ivy covered trellises and wicker furniture, was run as an annex to the restaurant. For an extra cost, first-class passengers could enjoy the finest French ''haute cuisine'' in the most luxurious of surroundings.&lt;ref name="NMNI 1st Class Cafe Parisien"/&gt; There was also a ''Verandah Café'' where tea and light refreshments were served, that offered grand views of the ocean. At 114&amp;nbsp;ft. long X 92&amp;nbsp;ft. wide, the Dining Saloon on D-Deck was the largest room afloat and could seat almost 600 passengers at a time.&lt;ref&gt;Brewster, Hugh &amp; Coulter, Laurie. 882 1/2 Answers to Your Questions About The Titanic, Scholastic Press, 1998; 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

--&gt;
Third Class (commonly referred to as Steerage) accommodations aboard ''Titanic'' were not as luxurious as First or Second Class, but even so were better than on many other ships of the time. They reflected the improved standards which the White Star Line had adopted for trans-Atlantic immigrant and lower-class travel. On most other North Atlantic passenger ships at the time, Third Class accommodations consisted of little more than open dormitories in the forward end of the vessels, in which hundreds of people were confined, often without adequate food or toilet facilities.

The White Star Line had long since broken that mould. As seen aboard ''Titanic'', all White Star Line passenger ships divided their Third Class accommodations into two sections, always at opposite ends of the vessel from one another. The established arrangement was that single men were quartered in the forward areas, while single women, married couples and families were quartered aft. In addition, while other ships provided only open berth sleeping arrangements, White Star Line vessels provided their Third Class passengers with private, small but comfortable cabins capable of accommodating two, four, six, eight and 10 passengers.{{sfn|Beveridge|2008|p=15}}

Third Class accommodations also included their own dining rooms, as well as public gathering areas including adequate open deck space, which aboard ''Titanic'' comprised the Poop Deck at the stern, the forward and aft well decks, and a large open space on D Deck which could be used as a social hall. This was supplemented by the addition of a smoking room for men and a General Room on C Deck which women could use for reading and writing. Although they were not as glamorous in design as spaces seen in upper class accommodations, they were still far above average for the period.

Leisure facilities were provided for all three classes to pass the time. As well as making use of the indoor amenities such as the library, smoking rooms, and gymnasium, it was also customary for passengers to socialise on the open deck, promenading or relaxing in hired deck chairs or wooden benches. A passenger list was published before the sailing to inform the public which members of the great and good were on board, and it was not uncommon for ambitious mothers to use the list to identify rich bachelors to whom they could introduce their marriageable daughters during the voyage.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=189}}

One of ''Titanic''{{-'}}s most distinctive features was her First Class staircase, known as the [[Grand Staircase of the RMS Titanic|Grand Staircase]] or Grand Stairway. Built of solid [[English oak]] with a sweeping curve, the staircase descended through seven decks of the ship, between the Boat Deck to E deck, before terminating in a simplified single flight on F Deck.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=59}} It was capped with a dome of wrought iron and glass that admitted natural light to the stairwell. Each landing off the staircase gave access to ornate entrance halls paneled in the [[William and Mary style|William &amp; Mary]] style and lit by [[ormolu]] and crystal light fixtures.{{sfn|Lynch|1992|p=53}}

At the uppermost landing was a large carved wooden panel containing a clock, with figures of "Honour and Glory Crowning Time" flanking the clock face.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=59}} The Grand Staircase was destroyed during the sinking and is now just a void in the ship which modern explorers have used to access the lower decks.{{sfn|Lynch|1992|p=207}} During the filming of James Cameron's ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' in 1997, his replica of the Grand Staircase was ripped from its foundations by the force of the inrushing water on the set. It has been suggested that during the real event, the entire Grand Staircase was ejected upwards through the dome.{{sfn|Merideth|2003|p=236}}

=== Mail and cargo ===
[[File:La Circassienne au Bain, After Blondel.JPG|thumb|upright| ''[[La Circassienne au Bain]]''; the most highly valued item of cargo lost on the ''Titanic''.{{efn|Copy of the neoclassical oil painting by [[Merry-Joseph Blondel]]&lt;ref name="New York Times 1913, p.28"&gt;New York Times, Thursday 16 January 1913, ''Titanic Survivors Asking $6,000,000'', p.28&lt;/ref&gt;}}]]
Although ''Titanic'' was primarily a passenger liner, she also carried a substantial amount of cargo. Her designation as a [[Royal Mail Ship]] (RMS) indicated that she carried mail under contract with the [[Royal Mail]] (and also for the [[United States Post Office Department]]). For the storage of letters, parcels and specie (bullion, coins and other valuables), {{convert|26800|cuft|m3}} of space in her holds was allocated. The Sea Post Office on G Deck was manned by five postal clerks; three Americans and two Britons, who worked 13 hours a day, seven days a week sorting up to 60,000 items daily.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=146}}

The ship's passengers brought with them a huge amount of baggage; another {{convert|19455|cuft|m3}} was taken up by first- and second-class baggage. In addition, there was a considerable quantity of regular cargo, ranging from furniture to foodstuffs, and a 1912 Renault Type CE Coupe de Ville motor car.&lt;ref&gt;Staff. (13 April 2012). "
The car that went down with the Titanic," New York: Fox News., Accessed on (11/9/18) at: http://www.foxnews.com/auto/2012/04/13/car-that-went-down-with-titanic.html&lt;/ref&gt; Despite later myths, the cargo on ''Titanic''{{-'}}s maiden voyage was fairly mundane; there was no gold, [[Raise the Titanic!|exotic minerals]] or diamonds, and one of the more famous items lost in the shipwreck, a jewelled copy of the ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]]'', was valued at only £405 (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|405|1912|r=-2}}}} today).{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1987|p=131}} According to the claims for compensation filed with Commissioner Gilchrist, following the conclusion of the Senate Inquiry, the single most highly valued item of luggage or cargo was a large neoclassical oil painting entitled ''[[La Circassienne au Bain]]'' by French artist [[Merry-Joseph Blondel]]. The painting's owner, first class passenger [[Mauritz Håkan Björnström-Steffansson]], filed a claim for $100,000 ($2.4 million equivalent in 2014) in compensation for the loss of the artwork.&lt;ref name="New York Times 1913, p.28"/&gt;

''Titanic'' was equipped with eight electric cranes, four electric winches and three steam winches to lift cargo and baggage in and out of the hold. It is estimated that the ship used some 415 tons of coal whilst in Southampton, simply generating steam to operate the cargo winches and provide heat and light.&lt;ref&gt;''The Titanic: The Memorabilia Collection'', by Michael Swift, Igloo Publishing 2011, {{ISBN|978-0-85780-251-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lifeboats ===
{{Main|Lifeboats of the RMS Titanic}}
[[File:Titanic lifeboat.jpg|thumb|250px|A collapsible lifeboat with canvas sides]]
''Titanic'' carried a total of 20 lifeboats: 14 standard wooden Harland and Wolff lifeboats with a capacity of 65&amp;nbsp;people each and four Englehardt "collapsible" (wooden bottom, collapsible canvas sides) lifeboats (identified as A to D) with a capacity of 47&amp;nbsp;people each. In addition, she had two emergency [[Cutter (boat)#Rowing|cutters]] with a capacity of 40&amp;nbsp;people each.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=112}}{{efn|Measurement of lifeboats: '''1–2:''' 25'2" long by 7'2" wide by 3'2" deep; {{convert|326.6|cuft|m3}}; '''3–16:''' 30' long by 9'1" wide by 4' deep; {{convert|655.2|cuft|m3}} and '''A–D:''' 27'5" long by 8' wide by 3' deep; {{convert|376.6|cuft|m3}} }} ''Olympic'' herself did not even carry the four collapsibles A–D during the 1911–12 season. All of the lifeboats were stowed securely on the boat deck and, except for collapsible lifeboats&amp;nbsp;A and B, connected to [[davit]]s by ropes. Those on the starboard side were odd-numbered 1–15 from bow to stern, while those on the port side were even-numbered 2–16 from bow to stern.{{sfn|Lord|1997|p=78}}

Both cutters were kept swung out, hanging from the davits, ready for immediate use, while collapsible lifeboats&amp;nbsp;C and D were stowed on the boat deck (connected to davits) immediately inboard of boats&amp;nbsp;1 and 2 respectively. A and B were stored on the roof of the officers' quarters, on either side of number&amp;nbsp;1 funnel. There were no davits to lower them and their weight would make them difficult to launch by hand.{{sfn|Lord|1997|p=78}} Each boat carried (among other things) food, water, blankets, and a spare life belt. Lifeline ropes on the boats' sides enabled them to save additional people from the water if necessary.

''Titanic'' had 16 sets of davits, each able to handle four lifeboats. This gave ''Titanic'' the ability to carry up to 64 wooden lifeboats{{sfn|Chirnside|2004|p=26}} which would have been enough for 4,000&amp;nbsp;people—considerably more than her actual capacity. However, the White Star Line decided that only 16 wooden lifeboats and four collapsibles would be carried, which could accommodate 1,178&amp;nbsp;people, only one-third of ''Titanic''{{'s}} total capacity. At the time, the Board of Trade's regulations required British vessels over 10,000&amp;nbsp;tons to only carry 16&amp;nbsp;lifeboats with a capacity of 990 occupants.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=112}}

Therefore, the White Star Line actually provided more lifeboat accommodation than was legally required.{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=38}}{{efn|Since 1894, when the largest passenger ship under consideration was the [[Cunard Line]]'s 13,000-ton {{RMS|Lucania|3=2}}, the Board of Trade had made no provision to increase the existing scale regarding the number of required lifeboats for larger ships, such as the 46,000-ton ''Titanic''. Sir Alfred Chalmers, nautical adviser to the Board of Trade from 1896 to 1911, had considered the matter of adjusting the scale "from time to time", but because he not only assumed that experienced sailors would need to be carried "uselessly" aboard ship only to lower and man the extra lifeboats, but also anticipated the difficulty in getting away a greater number than 16&amp;nbsp;boats in any emergency, he "did not consider it necessary to increase [the scale]".&lt;ref name="BritishInq"/&gt;}} At the time, lifeboats were intended to ferry survivors from a sinking ship to a rescuing ship—not keep afloat the whole population or power them to shore. Had the {{SS|Californian}} responded to ''Titanic'''s [[Distress signal|distress calls]], the lifeboats may have been adequate to ferry the passengers to safety as planned.&lt;ref name=wsj1&gt;{{cite news|title=The Real Reason for the Tragedy of the Titanic|last=Berg|first=Chris|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=13 April 2012|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304444604577337923643095442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Building and preparing the ship ==

=== Construction, launch and fitting-out ===
[[File:Titanic Disaster - Genuine Footage (1911-1912).webm|thumbnail|Titanic Disaster – Genuine Footage (1911–1912)]]

The sheer size of ''Titanic'' and her sister ships posed a major engineering challenge for Harland and Wolff; no shipbuilder had ever before attempted to construct vessels this size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stufftheydontwantyoutoknow.com/podcasts/titanic.htm|title=Titanic Conspiracies|date=2017-10-06|work=Titanic Conspiracies {{!}} Stuff They Don't Want You to Know|access-date=2017-10-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ships were constructed on Queen's Island, now known as the [[Titanic Quarter, Belfast|Titanic Quarter]], in [[Port of Belfast|Belfast Harbour]]. Harland and Wolff had to demolish three existing [[slipway]]s and build two new ones, the largest ever constructed up to that time, to accommodate both ships.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=12}} Their construction was facilitated by an enormous gantry built by [[Sir William Arrol &amp; Co.]], a Scottish firm responsible for the building of the [[Forth Bridge]] and London's [[Tower Bridge]]. The Arrol Gantry stood {{convert|228|ft|m}} high, was {{convert|270|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|840|ft|m}} long, and weighed more than 6,000 tons. It accommodated a number of mobile cranes. A separate floating crane, capable of lifting 200 tons, was brought in from Germany.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=78}}

The construction of ''Olympic'' and ''Titanic'' took place virtually in parallel, with ''Olympic''{{-'}}s keel laid down first on 16 December 1908 and ''Titanic''{{-'}}s on 31 March 1909.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=56}} Both ships took about 26 months to build and followed much the same construction process. They were designed essentially as an enormous floating [[box girder]], with the [[keel]] acting as a backbone and the frames of the hull forming the ribs. At the base of the ships, a double bottom {{convert|5|ft|3|in|m}} deep supported 300 frames, each between {{convert|24|in|cm}} and {{convert|36|in|cm}} apart and measuring up to about {{convert|66|ft|m}} long. They terminated at the bridge deck (B Deck) and were covered with steel plates which formed the outer skin of the ships.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=42}}

The 2,000 hull plates were single pieces of [[rolling (metalworking)|rolled]] steel [[structural steel|plate]], mostly up to {{convert|6|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|30|ft|m}} long and weighing between 2.5 and 3 tons.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=43}} Their thickness varied from {{convert|1|in|cm}} to {{convert|1.5|in|cm}}.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=44}} The plates were laid in a [[Clinker (boat building)|clinkered]] (overlapping) fashion from the keel to the bilge. Above that point they were laid in the "in and out" fashion, where [[strake]] plating was applied in bands (the "in strakes") with the gaps covered by the "out strakes", overlapping on the edges. Commercial oxy-fuel and electric arc [[welding]] methods, ubiquitous in [[metal fabrication|fabrication]] today, were still in their infancy; like most other iron and steel structures of the era, the hull was held together with over three million iron and steel [[rivet]]s, which by themselves weighed over 1,200 tons. They were fitted using hydraulic machines or were hammered in by hand.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=87}} In the 1990s some material scientists concluded{{sfn|Felkins|Leighly|Jankovic|1998}} that the steel plate used for the ship was subject to being especially brittle when cold, and that this brittleness exacerbated the impact damage and hastened the sinking. It is believed that, by the standards of the time, the steel plate's [[quality (business)|quality]] was good, not faulty, but that it was inferior to what would be used for shipbuilding purposes in later decades, owing to advances in the [[metallurgy]] of [[steelmaking]].{{sfn|Felkins|Leighly|Jankovic|1998}} As for the rivets, considerable emphasis has also been placed on their quality and strength.{{sfn|Broad|1997}}{{sfn|''Materials Today'', 2008}}{{sfn|McCarty|Foecke|2012|p={{page needed|date=March 2012}}}}{{sfn|Broad|2008}}{{sfn|Verhoeven|2007|p=49}}

One of the last items to be fitted on ''Titanic'' before the ship's launch was her two side anchors and one centre anchor. The anchors themselves were a challenge to make with the centre anchor being the largest ever forged by hand and weighing nearly 16 tons. Twenty Clydesdale draught horses were needed to haul the centre anchor by wagon from the [[N. Hingley &amp; Sons Ltd|Noah Hingley &amp; Sons Ltd]] forge shop in Netherton, near Dudley, United Kingdom to the Dudley railway station two miles away. From there it was shipped by rail to Fleetwood in Lancashire before being loaded aboard a ship and sent to Belfast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-the-hingley-anchors.html|title=Titanic: The Hingley Anchors|first=Jonathan|last=Smith|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of constructing the ships was difficult and dangerous. For the 15,000 men who worked at Harland and Wolff at the time,{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=105}} safety precautions were rudimentary at best; a lot of the work was dangerous and was carried out without any safety equipment like hard hats or hand guards on machinery. As a result, deaths and injuries were to be expected. During ''Titanic''{{-'}}s construction, 246 injuries were recorded, 28 of them "severe", such as arms severed by machines or legs crushed under falling pieces of steel. Six people died on the ship herself while she was being constructed and fitted out, and another two died in the shipyard workshops and sheds.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=109}} Just before the launch a worker was killed when a piece of wood fell on him.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=33}}

''Titanic'' was launched at 12:15&amp;nbsp;p.m. on 31 May 1911 in the presence of Lord Pirrie, J. Pierpoint Morgan, J. Bruce Ismay and 100,000 onlookers.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=15}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn88064469/1911-06-06/ed-1/seq-4/#date1=1911&amp;sort=relevance&amp;rows=20&amp;words=Titanic&amp;searchType=basic&amp;sequence=0&amp;index=19&amp;state=&amp;date2=1911&amp;protext=Titanic&amp;y=0&amp;x=0&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=4 The Caucasian], (newspaper of Shreveport, Louisiana)  June 6 1911...Retrieved October 4 2018&lt;/ref&gt; 22 tons of soap and tallow were spread on the slipway to lubricate the ship's passage into the [[River Lagan]].{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=33}} In keeping with the White Star Line's traditional policy, the ship was not formally named or christened with champagne.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=15}} The ship was towed to a fitting-out berth where, over the course of the next year, her engines, funnels and superstructure were installed and her interior was fitted out.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=18}}

Although ''Titanic'' was virtually identical to the class's lead ship ''Olympic'', a few changes were made to distinguish both ships. The most noticeable exterior difference was that ''Titanic'' (and the third vessel in class, {{HMHS|Britannic||2}}) had a steel screen with sliding windows installed along the forward half of the A Deck promenade. This was installed as a last minute change at the personal request of Bruce Ismay, and was intended to provide additional shelter to first class passengers.&lt;ref name="Marriott"/&gt; Extensive changes were made to B Deck on ''Titanic'' as the promenade space in this deck, which had proven unpopular on ''Olympic'' was converted into additional First Class cabins, including two opulent parlour suites with their own private promenade spaces. The ''À la Carte'' restaurant was also enlarged and the ''Café Parisien'', an entirely new feature which did not exist on ''Olympic'', was added. These changes made ''Titanic'' slightly heavier than her sister, and thus she could claim to be the largest ship afloat. The work took longer than expected due to design changes requested by Ismay and a temporary pause in work occasioned by the need to repair ''Olympic'', which had been in a collision in September 1911. Had ''Titanic'' been finished earlier, she might well have missed her collision with an iceberg.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=33}}

=== Sea trials ===
[[File:RMS Titanic 2.jpg|thumb|250px|RMS ''Titanic'' leaving [[Belfast, Northern Ireland|Belfast]] for her sea trials on 2 April 1912]]

''Titanic''{{-'}}s sea trials began at 6&amp;nbsp;a.m. on Tuesday, 2 April 1912, just two days after her fitting out was finished and eight days before she was due to leave Southampton on her maiden voyage.{{sfn|Spignesi|1998|p=22}} The trials were delayed for a day due to bad weather, but by Monday morning it was clear and fair.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=44}} Aboard were 78 stokers, greasers and firemen, and 41&amp;nbsp;members of crew. No domestic staff appear to have been aboard. Representatives of various companies travelled on ''Titanic''{{'s}} sea trials, Thomas Andrews and Edward Wilding of Harland and Wolff and Harold A. Sanderson of IMM. Bruce Ismay and Lord Pirrie were too ill to attend. [[Jack Phillips (wireless officer)|Jack Phillips]] and [[Harold Bride]] served as radio operators, and performed fine-tuning of the Marconi equipment. Francis Carruthers, a surveyor from the Board of Trade, was also present to see that everything worked, and that the ship was fit to carry passengers.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|pp=44, 46}}

The sea trials consisted of a number of tests of her handling characteristics, carried out first in [[Belfast Lough]] and then in the open waters of the [[Irish Sea]]. Over the course of about 12 hours, ''Titanic'' was driven at different speeds, her turning ability was tested and a "crash stop" was performed in which the engines were reversed full ahead to full astern, bringing her to a stop in {{convert|850|yards|m|0|abbr=on}} or 3 minutes and 15 seconds.{{sfn|Chirnside|2004|pp=39–40}} The ship covered a distance of about {{convert|80|nmi|mi km}}, averaging {{convert|18|kn|mph km/h}} and reaching a maximum speed of just under {{convert|21|kn|mph km/h}}.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=45}}

On returning to Belfast at about 7&amp;nbsp;p.m., the surveyor signed an "Agreement and Account of Voyages and Crew", valid for 12 months, which declared the ship seaworthy. An hour later, ''Titanic'' departed Belfast to head to Southampton, a voyage of about {{convert|570|nmi|mi km}}. After a journey lasting about 28 hours she arrived about midnight on 4 April and was towed to the port's Berth 44, ready for the arrival of her passengers and the remainder of her crew.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=46}}

== Maiden voyage ==
Both ''Olympic'' and ''Titanic'' registered [[Liverpool]] as their home port. The offices of the White Star Line as well as Cunard were in Liverpool, and up until the introduction of the ''Olympic'', most British ocean liners for both Cunard and White Star, such as ''Lusitania'' and ''Mauretania'', sailed out of Liverpool followed by a port of call in [[Queenstown, Ireland]]. Since the company's founding in 1871, a vast majority of their operations had taken place out of Liverpool. However, in 1907 White Star established another service out of the port of Southampton on England's south coast, which became known as White Star's "Express Service". Southampton had many advantages over Liverpool, the first being its proximity to London.{{sfn|McCluskie|1998|p=21}}

In addition, Southampton, being on the south coast, allowed ships to easily cross the [[English Channel]] and make a port of call on the northern coast of France, usually at [[Cherbourg]]. This allowed British ships to pick up clientele from continental Europe before recrossing the channel and picking up passengers at Queenstown. The ''Southampton-Cherbourg-New York run'' would become so popular that most British ocean liners began using the port after [[World War I]]. Out of respect for Liverpool, ships continued to be registered there until the early 1960s. ''[[Queen Elizabeth 2]]'' was one of the first ships registered in Southampton when introduced into service by Cunard in 1969.{{sfn|McCluskie|1998|p=21}}

''Titanic'''s maiden voyage was intended to be the first of many trans-Atlantic crossings between Southampton and New York via Cherbourg and Queenstown on westbound runs, returning via [[Plymouth]] in England while eastbound. Indeed, her entire schedule of voyages through to December 1912 still exists.&lt;ref&gt;Eaton and Haas; ''The Misadventures of the White Star Line'', c.1990&lt;/ref&gt; When the route was established, four ships were assigned to the service. In addition to ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic'', the {{RMS|Oceanic|1899|6}} and the brand new {{RMS|Adriatic|1907|6}} sailed the route. When the ''Olympic'' entered service in June 1911, she replaced ''Teutonic'', which after completing her last run on the service in late April was transferred to the Dominion Line's Canadian service. The following August, ''Adriatic'' was transferred to White Star's main Liverpool-New York service, and in November, ''Majestic'' was withdrawn from service impending the arrival of ''Titanic'' in the coming months, and was mothballed as a reserve ship.&lt;ref&gt;De Kerbrech, Richard, "Ships of the White Star Line", p. 50, 53, 112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leaflet"/&gt;

White Star's initial plans for ''Olympic'' and ''Titanic'' on the Southampton run followed the same routine as their predecessors had done before them. Each would sail once every three weeks from Southampton and New York, usually leaving at noon each Wednesday from Southampton and each Saturday from New York, thus enabling the White Star Line to offer weekly sailings in each direction. Special trains were scheduled from London and Paris to convey passengers to Southampton and Cherbourg respectively.&lt;ref name="Leaflet"/&gt; The deep-water dock at Southampton, then known as the "''White Star Dock''{{-"}}, had been specially constructed to accommodate the new ''Olympic''-class liners, and had opened in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Southampton in 1912 |url=http://www.southampton.gov.uk/s-leisure/artsheritage/history/titanic/exhibitions/southampton1912.aspx |publisher=Southampton City Council |accessdate=1 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122005156/http://www.southampton.gov.uk/s-leisure/artsheritage/history/titanic/exhibitions/southampton1912.aspx |archivedate=22 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Crew ===
{{main|Crew of the RMS Titanic}}

''Titanic'' had around 885 crew members on board for her maiden voyage.{{sfn|Mersey|1912|pp=110–111}} Like other vessels of her time, she did not have a permanent crew, and the vast majority of crew members were casual workers who only came aboard the ship a few hours before she sailed from Southampton.{{sfn|Barratt|2009|p=84}} The process of signing up recruits had begun on 23 March and some had been sent to Belfast, where they served as a skeleton crew during ''Titanic''{{-'}}s sea trials and passage to England at the start of April.{{sfn|Barratt|2009|p=83}}

Captain [[Edward Smith (sea captain)|Edward John Smith]], the most senior of the White Star Line's captains, was transferred from ''Olympic'' to take command of ''Titanic''.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|pp=43–44}} [[Henry Tingle Wilde]] also came across from ''Olympic'' to take the post of [[Chief Mate]]. ''Titanic''{{-'}}s previously designated Chief Mate and First Officer, [[William McMaster Murdoch]] and [[Charles Lightoller]], were bumped down to the ranks of First and Second Officer respectively. The original Second Officer, [[David Blair (mariner)|David Blair]], was dropped altogether.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=241}}{{efn|He expressed deep disappointment about the decision before the voyage, but was presumably greatly relieved afterwards.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=241}}}} The [[Third mate|Third Officer]] was [[Herbert Pitman]] [[MBE]], the only deck officer who was not a member of the [[Royal Naval Reserve]]. Pitman was the second to last surviving officer.

''Titanic''{{-'}}s crew were divided into three principal departments: Deck, with 66 crew; Engine, with 325; and Victualling (pronounced ''vi-tal-ling''), with 494.{{sfn|Barratt|2009|p=92}} The vast majority of the crew were thus not seamen, but were either engineers, firemen, or stokers, responsible for looking after the engines, or stewards and galley staff, responsible for the passengers.{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=238}} Of these, over 97% were male; just 23 of the crew were female, mainly stewardesses.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=242}} The rest represented a great variety of professions—bakers, chefs, butchers, fishmongers, dishwashers, stewards, gymnasium instructors, laundrymen, waiters, bed-makers, cleaners, and even a printer,{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=242}} who produced a daily newspaper for passengers called the ''Atlantic Daily Bulletin'' with the latest news received by the ship's wireless operators.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=162}}{{efn|''Titanic'' also had a ship's cat, Jenny, who gave birth to a litter of kittens shortly before the ship's maiden voyage; all perished in the sinking.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=246}}}}

Most of the crew signed on in Southampton on 6 April;{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=56}} in all, 699 of the crew came from there, and 40% were natives of the town.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=242}} A few specialist staff were self-employed or were subcontractors. These included the five postal clerks, who worked for the Royal Mail and the United States Post Office Department, the staff of the First Class ''A La Carte'' Restaurant and the Café Parisien, the radio operators (who were employed by Marconi) and the eight musicians, who were employed by an agency and travelled as second-class passengers.{{sfn|Barratt|2009|p=50}} Crew pay varied greatly, from Captain Smith's £105 a month (equivalent to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|105|1912|r=-2}}}} today) to the £3 10''[[Shilling (British coin)|s]]'' (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|3.5|1912|r=-1}}}} today) that stewardesses earned. The lower-paid victualling staff could, however, supplement their wages substantially through tips from passengers.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=246}}

=== Passengers ===
{{main|Passengers of the RMS Titanic}}
[[File:John Jacob Astor 1909.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Jacob Astor IV]] in 1909. He was the wealthiest person aboard ''Titanic''.]]

''Titanic''{{-'}}s passengers numbered approximately 1,317&amp;nbsp;people: 324 in First Class, 284 in Second Class, and 709 in Third Class. Of these, 869 (66%) were male and 447 (34%) female. There were 107 children aboard, the largest number of which were in Third Class.{{sfn|Barratt|2009|p=93}} The ship was considerably under capacity on her maiden voyage, as she could accommodate 2,453 passengers—833 First Class, 614 Second Class, and 1,006 Third Class.{{sfn|Howells|1999|p=18}}

Usually, a high prestige vessel like ''Titanic'' could expect to be fully booked on its maiden voyage. However, a [[National coal strike of 1912|national coal strike]] in the UK had caused considerable disruption to shipping schedules in the spring of 1912, causing many crossings to be cancelled. Many would-be passengers chose to postpone their travel plans until the strike was over. The strike had finished a few days before ''Titanic'' sailed; however, that was too late to have much of an effect. ''Titanic'' was able to sail on the scheduled date only because coal was transferred from other vessels which were tied up at Southampton, such as {{SS|City of New York}} and {{RMS|Oceanic|1899|6}}, as well as coal ''Olympic'' had brought back from a previous voyage to New York, which had been stored at the White Star Dock.&lt;ref name="Marriott"/&gt;

Some of the most prominent people of the day booked a passage aboard ''Titanic'', travelling in First Class. Among them (with those who perished marked with a dagger†) were the American millionaire [[John Jacob Astor IV]]† and his wife [[Madeleine Astor|Madeleine Force Astor]], industrialist [[Benjamin Guggenheim]]†, painter and sculptor [[Francis Davis Millet]]†, [[Macy's]] owner [[Isidor Straus]]† and his wife [[Ida Straus|Ida]]†, [[Denver]] millionairess [[Margaret Brown|Margaret "Molly" Brown]],{{efn|Known afterward as the "Unsinkable Molly Brown" due to her efforts in helping other passengers while the ship sank}} Sir [[Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon, 5th Baronet|Cosmo Duff Gordon]] and his wife, [[couturière]] [[Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon|Lucy (Lady Duff-Gordon)]], Lieut. Col. [[Arthur Godfrey Peuchen|Arthur Peuchen]], writer and historian [[Archibald Gracie IV|Archibald Gracie]], cricketer and businessman [[John Thayer (cricketer)|John B.

Ross, [[Washington Roebling]]'s nephew Washington A. Roebling II, [[Andrew Saks]]'s daughter Leila Saks Meyer with her husband Edgar Joseph Meyer† (son of [[Marc Eugene Meyer]]), senator [[William A. Clark]]'s nephew Walter M. Clark with his wife Virginia, great-great-grandson of soap manufacturer [[Andrew Pears]], Thomas C. Pears, with wife, [[John S. Pillsbury]]'s honeymooning grandson John P. Snyder and wife, Nelle, [[Dorothy Parker]]'s New York manufacturer uncle Martin Rothschild with his wife, Elizabeth, among others.&lt;ref name="Passengers"/&gt;

''Titanic''{{-'}}s owner [[J. P. Morgan]] was scheduled to travel on the maiden voyage but cancelled at the last minute.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|loc=Chapter 8}} Also aboard the ship were the White Star Line's managing director [[J. Bruce Ismay]] and ''Titanic''{{-'}}s designer [[Thomas Andrews (shipbuilder)|Thomas Andrews]]†, who was on board to observe any problems and assess the general performance of the new ship.{{sfn|Brewster|Coulter|1998|p=18}}

The exact number of people aboard is not known, as not all of those who had booked tickets made it to the ship; about 50 people cancelled for various reasons,{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=73}} and not all of those who boarded stayed aboard for the entire journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://historyonthenet.com/Titanic/passengers.htm |title=Titanic—Passenger and Crew statistics |publisher=Historyonthenet.com |accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fares varied depending on class and season. Third Class fares from London, Southampton, or Queenstown cost £7 5''s'' (equivalent to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|7.25|1912|r=-2}}}} today) while the cheapest First Class fares cost £23 (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|23|1912|r=-2}}}} today).&lt;ref name="Leaflet"/&gt; The most expensive First Class suites were to have cost up to £870 in high season (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|870|1912|r=-3}}}} today).{{sfn|Howells|1999|p=18}}

=== Collecting passengers ===
''Titanic''{{-'}}s maiden voyage began on Wednesday, 10 April 1912. Following the embarkation of the crew the passengers began arriving at 9:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., when the [[London and South Western Railway]]'s boat train from [[London Waterloo station]] reached [[Southampton Terminus railway station]] on the quayside, alongside ''Titanic''{{-'}}s berth.{{sfn|Barratt|2009|p=61}} The large number of Third Class passengers meant they were the first to board, with First and Second Class passengers following up to an hour before departure. Stewards showed them to their cabins, and First Class passengers were personally greeted by Captain Smith.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=252}} Third Class passengers were inspected for ailments and physical impairments that might lead to their being refused entry to the United States – a prospect the White Star Line wished to avoid, as it would have to carry anyone who failed the examination back across the Atlantic.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=73}} In all, 920 passengers boarded ''Titanic'' at Southampton – 179 First Class, 247 Second Class, and 494 Third Class. Additional passengers were to be picked up at [[Cherbourg]] and [[Cobh|Queenstown]].&lt;ref name="Marriott"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marriott|first=Leo|title=TITANIC|year=1997|publisher=PRC Publishing Ltd|isbn=978-1-85648-433-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The maiden voyage began at noon, as scheduled. An accident was narrowly averted only a few minutes later, as ''Titanic'' passed the moored liners {{SS|City of New York}} of the [[American Line]] and ''Oceanic'' of the White Star Line, the latter of which would have been her running mate on the service from Southampton. Her huge displacement caused both of the smaller ships to be lifted by a bulge of water and then drop into a trough. ''New York''{{-'}}s mooring cables could not take the sudden strain and snapped, swinging her around stern-first towards ''Titanic''. A nearby tugboat, ''Vulcan'', came to the rescue by taking ''New York'' under tow, and Captain Smith ordered ''Titanic''{{-'}}s engines to be put "full astern".{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=76}} The two ships avoided a collision by a matter of about {{convert|4|ft|m}}. The incident delayed ''Titanic''{{-'}}s departure for about an hour, while the drifting ''New York'' was brought under control.{{sfn|Brewster|Coulter|1998|p=22}}

After making it safely through the complex tides and channels of [[Southampton Water]] and the [[Solent]], ''Titanic'' disembarked the Southampton [[Maritime pilot|pilot]] at the [[Nab Tower|Nab Lightship]] and headed out into the [[English Channel]]. She headed for the French port of Cherbourg, a journey of {{convert|77|nmi|mi km}}.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=71}} The weather was windy, very fine but cold and overcast.{{sfn|Halpern|2011|p=79}} Because Cherbourg lacked docking facilities for a ship the size of ''Titanic'', [[Ship's tender|tenders]] had to be used to transfer passengers from shore to ship. The White Star Line operated two at Cherbourg, the {{SS|Traffic|1911|6}} and the {{SS|Nomadic|1911|6}}. Both had been designed specifically as tenders for the ''Olympic''-class liners and were launched shortly after ''Titanic''.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=92}} (''Nomadic'' is today the only White Star Line ship still afloat.) Four hours after ''Titanic'' left Southampton, she arrived at Cherbourg and was met by the tenders. There, 274 additional passengers were taken aboard – 142 First Class, 30 Second Class, and 102 Third Class. Twenty-four passengers left aboard the tenders to be conveyed to shore, having booked only a cross-Channel passage. The process was completed within only 90 minutes and at 8&amp;nbsp;p.m. ''Titanic'' [[Weigh anchor|weighed anchor]] and left for Queenstown{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=93}} with the weather continuing cold and windy.{{sfn|Halpern|2011|p=79}}

At 11:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. on Thursday 11 April, ''Titanic'' arrived at [[Cork Harbour]] on the south coast of Ireland. It was a partly cloudy but relatively warm day, with a brisk wind.{{sfn|Halpern|2011|p=79}} Again, the dock facilities were not suitable for a ship of ''Titanic'''s size, and tenders were used to bring passengers aboard. In all, 123 passengers boarded ''Titanic'' at Queenstown – three First Class, seven Second Class and 113 Third Class. In addition to the 24 cross-channel passengers who had disembarked at Cherbourg, another seven passengers had booked an overnight passage from Southampton to Queenstown. Among the seven was Father [[Francis Browne]], a [[Jesuit]] trainee who was a keen photographer and took many photographs aboard ''Titanic'', including the last-ever known photograph of the ship. A decidedly unofficial departure was that of a crew member, stoker John Coffey, a Queenstown native who sneaked off the ship by hiding under mail bags being transported to shore.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=100}} ''Titanic'' weighed anchor for the last time at 1:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. and departed on her westward journey across the Atlantic.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=100}}

From there she travelled {{convert|1620|nmi|mi km}} along a [[Great Circle]] route across the North Atlantic to reach a spot in the ocean known as "the corner" south-east of Newfoundland, where westbound steamers carried out a change of course. ''Titanic'' sailed only a few hours past the corner on a [[rhumb line]] leg of {{convert|1023|nmi|mi km}} to [[Nantucket Shoals]] Light when she made her fatal contact with an iceberg.{{sfn|Halpern|2011|p=75}} The final leg of the journey would have been {{convert|193|nmi|mi km}} to [[Ambrose Light]] and finally to [[New York Harbor]].{{sfn|Halpern|2011|p=73}}

From 11 April to [[local apparent time|local apparent noon]] the next day, ''Titanic'' covered {{convert|484|nmi|mi km}}; the following day, {{convert|519|nmi|mi km}}; and by noon on the final day of her voyage, {{convert|546|nmi|mi km}}. From then until the time of her sinking she travelled another {{convert|258|nmi|mi km}}, averaging about {{convert|21|kn|mph km/h}}.{{sfn|Halpern|2011|pp=74–75}}

The weather cleared as she left Ireland under cloudy skies with a headwind. Temperatures remained fairly mild on Saturday 13 April, but the following day ''Titanic'' crossed a cold [[weather front]] with strong winds and waves of up to {{convert|8|ft|m}}. These died down as the day progressed until, by the evening of Sunday 14 April, it became clear, calm and very cold.{{sfn|Halpern|2011|p=80}}

The first three days of the voyage from Queenstown had passed without apparent incident. A fire had begun in one of ''Titanic'''s [[coal bunker]]s approximately 10 days prior to the ship's departure, and continued to burn for several days into its voyage,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.titanicology.com/Titanica/FireDownBelow.pdf Fire Down Below] – by Samuel Halpern.

''Titanic'' received a series of warnings from other ships of drifting ice in the area of the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland]].{{sfn|Ryan|1985|p=9}} One of the ships to warn ''Titanic'' was the Atlantic Line's {{SS|Mesaba|1897|2}}.&lt;ref name=HW319&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theyard.info/ships/ships.asp?entryid=319 |title=Winifreda |publisher=The Yard |accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the ship continued to steam at full speed, which was standard practice at the time.{{sfn|Mowbray|1912|p=278}} Although the ship was not trying to set a speed record,{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=24}} timekeeping was a priority, and under prevailing maritime practices, ships were often operated at close to full speed, with ice warnings seen as advisories and reliance placed upon lookouts and the watch on the bridge.{{sfn|Mowbray|1912|p=278}} It was generally believed that ice posed little danger to large vessels. Close calls with ice were not uncommon, and even head-on collisions had not been disastrous. In 1907 {{SS|Kronprinz Wilhelm}}, a German liner, had rammed an iceberg but still had been able to complete her voyage, and Captain Smith himself had declared in 1907 that he "could not imagine any condition which would cause a ship to founder. Modern shipbuilding has gone beyond that."{{sfn|Barczewski|2006|p=13}}{{efn|Captain Edward Smith had been in command of ''Titanic''{{-'}}s sister ''Olympic'' when she in 1911 collided with a warship.

=== Sinking ===
{{main|Sinking of the RMS Titanic|l1=Sinking of the RMS ''Titanic''}}

At 11:40&amp;nbsp;p.m. ([[ship's time]]) on 14 April, lookout [[Frederick Fleet]] spotted an iceberg immediately ahead of ''Titanic'' and alerted the bridge.{{sfn|Lord|2005|p=2}} [[Chief mate|First Officer]] [[William McMaster Murdoch|William Murdoch]] ordered the ship to be steered around the obstacle and the engines to be stopped,{{sfn|Barczewski|2006|p=191}} but it was too late; the starboard side of ''Titanic'' struck the iceberg, creating a series of holes below the waterline.{{efn|The official enquiry found that damage extended about 300 feet, but both Edward Wilding's testimony and modern [[ultrasound]] surveys of the [[Wreck of the RMS Titanic|wreck]] suggest the total area was perhaps a few narrow openings totalling perhaps no more than {{convert|12|to|13|sqft|m2|1}}.{{sfn|Report|1912|p=question 20422, Day 19}}{{sfn|Broad|1997}}}} The hull was not punctured by the iceberg, but rather dented such that the hull's seams buckled and separated, allowing water to seep in. Five of the ship's watertight compartments were breached. It soon became clear that the ship was doomed, as she could not survive more than four compartments being flooded. ''Titanic'' began sinking bow-first, with water spilling from compartment to compartment as her angle in the water became steeper.{{sfn|Ballard|1987|p=22}}

Those aboard ''Titanic'' were ill-prepared for such an emergency. In accordance with accepted practices of the time, where ships were seen as largely unsinkable and lifeboats were intended to transfer passengers to nearby rescue vessels,{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=116}}{{efn|An incident confirmed this philosophy while ''Titanic'' was under construction: the White Star liner ''Republic'' was involved in a collision and sank. Even though she did not have enough lifeboats for all passengers, they were all saved because the ship was able to stay afloat long enough for them to be ferried to ships coming to assist.{{sfn|Chirnside|2004|p=29}}}} ''Titanic'' only had enough lifeboats to carry about half of those on board; if the ship had carried her full complement of about 3,339 passengers and crew, only about a third could have been accommodated in the lifeboats.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=109}} The crew had not been trained adequately in carrying out an evacuation. The officers did not know how many they could safely put aboard the lifeboats and launched many of them barely half-full.{{sfn|Barczewski|2006|p=21}} Third-class passengers were largely left to fend for themselves, causing many of them to become trapped below decks as the ship filled with water.{{sfn|Barczewski|2006|p=284}} The "[[women and children first]]" protocol was generally followed when loading the lifeboats,{{sfn|Barczewski|2006|p=284}} and most of the male passengers and crew were left aboard.

At 2:20&amp;nbsp;a.m., two hours and 40 minutes after ''Titanic'' struck the iceberg, her rate of sinking suddenly increased as her forward deck dipped underwater, and the sea poured in through open hatches and grates.{{sfn|Halpern|Weeks|2011|p=118}} As her unsupported stern rose out of the water, exposing the propellers, the ship began to break in two between the third and fourth funnels, due to the immense forces on the keel.{{sfn|Ballard|1987|p=204}} With the bow underwater, and air trapped in the stern, the stern remained afloat and buoyant for a few minutes longer, rising to a nearly vertical angle with hundreds of people still clinging to it,{{sfn|Barczewski|2006|p=29}} before sinking. For many years it was generally believed the ship sank in one piece; however, when [[Wreck of the RMS Titanic|the wreck was located]] many years later, it was discovered that the ship had fully broken in two. All remaining passengers and crew were immersed into lethally cold water with a temperature of {{convert|28|°F|0|abbr=on}}. Sudden immersion into freezing water typically causes death within minutes, either from [[cardiac arrest]], uncontrollable breathing of water, or [[cold incapacitation]] (not, as commonly believed, from [[hypothermia]]),{{efn|Life expectancy in such temperatures is often under 15 minutes even for people who are young and fit. The victims would have died from [[Involuntary action|bodily reactions]] to freezing water rather than [[hypothermia]] (loss of core temperature). Immersed into freezing seas, around 20% of victims die within two minutes from [[cold shock response|cold shock]] (uncontrolled [[hyperventilation|rapid breathing]] and gasping causing water inhalation, massive increase in blood pressure, cardiac strain leading to cardiac arrest, and [[panic]]), another 50% die within 15–30 minutes from [[cold incapacitation]] (inability to use or control limbs and hands for swimming or gripping, as the body 'protectively' shuts down peripheral muscles to protect its core),&lt;ref&gt;[http://mariovittone.com/2010/10/the-truth-about-cold-water/ "The Truth About The Cold Water"].

Distress signals were sent by wireless, rockets, and lamp, but none of the ships that responded was near enough to reach ''Titanic'' before she sank.{{sfn|Brewster|Coulter|1998|pp=45–47}} A radio operator on board the [[Russian American Line|''Birma'']], for instance, estimated that it would be 6&amp;nbsp;a.m. before the liner could arrive at the scene. Meanwhile, the {{SS|Californian}}, which was the last to have been in contact before the collision, saw ''Titanic''{{'}}s flares but failed to assist.{{sfn|Brewster|Coulter|1998|pp=64–65}} Around 4&amp;nbsp;a.m., {{RMS|Carpathia}} arrived on the scene in response to ''Titanic''{{-'}}s earlier distress calls.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=238}}

About 710&amp;nbsp;people survived the disaster and were conveyed by ''Carpathia'' to New York, ''Titanic''{{-'}}s original destination, while at least 1,500&amp;nbsp;people lost their lives.{{sfn|Mersey|1912|pp=110–111}} ''Carpathia''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s captain described the place as an ice field that had included 20&amp;nbsp;large bergs measuring up to {{convert|200|ft|m}} high and numerous smaller bergs, as well as ice floes and debris from ''Titanic''; passengers described being in the middle of a vast white plain of ice, studded with icebergs.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|pp=242, 245}} This area is now known as [[Iceberg Alley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthsky.org/earth/a-trip-down-canadas-iceberg-alley|title=A trip down Canada’s Iceberg Alley - EarthSky.org|website=earthsky.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arrival of ''Carpathia'' in New York ===
[[File:Titanic paperboy_crop.jpg|thumb|upright|London newsboy Ned Parfett with news of the disaster.]]

{{RMS|Carpathia}} took three days to reach New York after leaving the scene of the disaster. Her journey was slowed by pack ice, fog, thunderstorms and rough seas.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=266}} She was, however, able to pass news to the outside world by wireless about what had happened. The initial reports were confused, leading the American press to report erroneously on 15 April that ''Titanic'' was being towed to port by the {{SS|Virginian}}.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=256}}

Later that day, confirmation came through that ''Titanic'' had been lost and that most of her passengers and crew had died.{{sfn|Butler|2002|p=169}} The news attracted crowds of people to the White Star Line's offices in London, New York, Montreal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Whatley Design Group, 2000 |url=http://www.vehiculepress.com/montreal/titanic.html |title=A Walking Tour of Montreal – Sites Related to the Titanic Disaster |publisher=Vehiculepress.com |date=15 April 1912 |accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Southampton,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kerins|first=Dan|title=White Star Offices, Canute Chambers, Canute Road, Southampton|url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/heritage/titanic/trail/locations/9443568.Canute_Chambers/|work=Titanic trail|publisher=Southern Daily Echo|accessdate=21 March 2012|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liverpool and Belfast.&lt;ref&gt;''In His Court''. Mike Yorkey (2002) p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; It hit hardest in Southampton, whose people suffered the greatest losses from the sinking.&lt;ref name="Southampton2012"/&gt; Four out of every five crew members came from this town.{{sfn|Butler|2002|p=172}}{{efn|The Salvation Army newspaper, ''The War Cry'', reported that "none but a heart of stone would be unmoved in the presence of such anguish. Night and day that crowd of pale, anxious faces had been waiting patiently for the news that did not come. Nearly every one in the crowd had lost a relative."{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=261}} It was not until 17 April that the first incomplete lists of survivors came through, delayed by poor communications.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=262}}}}

''Carpathia'' docked at 9:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. on 18 April at New York's [[Pier 54]] and was greeted by some 40,000&amp;nbsp;people waiting at the quayside in heavy rain.{{sfn|Butler|2002|pp=170, 172}} Immediate relief in the form of clothing and transportation to shelters was provided by the Women's Relief Committee, the [[Travelers Aid Society of New York]], and the [[National Council of Jewish Women|Council of Jewish Women]], among other organisations.{{sfn|Landau|2001|pp=22–23}} Many of ''Titanic''{{-'}}s surviving passengers did not linger in New York but headed onwards immediately to relatives' homes. Some of the wealthier survivors chartered private trains to take them home, and the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] laid on a special train free of charge to take survivors to [[Philadelphia]]. ''Titanic''{{-'}}s 214 surviving crew members were taken to the [[Red Star Line]]'s steamer {{SS|Lapland}}, where they were accommodated in passenger cabins.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=183}}

''Carpathia'' was hurriedly restocked with food and provisions before resuming her journey to [[Rijeka|Fiume]], [[Austria-Hungary]]. Her crew were given a bonus of a month's wages by Cunard as a reward for their actions, and some of ''Titanic''{{-'}}s passengers joined together to give them an additional bonus of nearly £900 (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|900|1912|r=-3}}}} today), divided among the crew members.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=184}}

The ship's arrival in New York led to a frenzy of press interest, with newspapers competing to be the first to report the survivors' stories. Some reporters bribed their way aboard the [[pilot boat]] ''New York'', which guided ''Carpathia'' into harbour, and one even managed to get onto ''Carpathia'' before she docked.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=182}} Crowds gathered outside newspaper offices to see the latest reports being posted in the windows or on billboards.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=204}} It took another four days for a complete list of casualties to be compiled and released, adding to the agony of relatives waiting for news of those who had been aboard ''Titanic''.{{efn|On 23 April, the ''Daily Mail'' reported: "Late in the afternoon hope died out. The waiting crowds thinned, and silent men and women sought their homes. In the humbler homes of Southampton there is scarcely a family who has not lost a relative or friend. Children returning from school appreciated something of tragedy, and woeful little faces were turned to the darkened, fatherless homes."{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=173}}}}

=== Insurance, aid for survivors and lawsuits ===
In January 1912, the hulls and equipment of ''Titanic'' and ''Olympic'' had been insured through [[Lloyd's of London]] and [[London Marine Insurance]]. The total coverage was £1,000,000 (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|1000000|1912|r=-6}}}} today) per ship. The policy was to be "free from all average" under £150,000, meaning that the insurers would only pay for damage in excess of that sum. The premium, negotiated by brokers Willis Faber &amp; Company (now [[Willis Group]]), was 15 ''s'' (75 ''p'') per £100, or £7,500 (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|7500|1912|r=-4}}}} today) for the term of one year. Lloyd's paid the White Star Line the full sum owed to them within 30 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lloyd's |title=Titanic Information Sheet |url=http://www.lloyds.com/~/media/Images/News%20and%20Insight/News%20and%20features/2012/Titanic%20slip.pdf |accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many charities were set up to help the victims and their families, many of whom lost their sole breadwinner, or, in the case of many Third Class survivors, everything they owned. On 29 April opera stars [[Enrico Caruso]] and [[Mary Garden]] and members of the [[Metropolitan Opera]] raised $12,000 ($300,000 in 2014)&lt;ref&gt;from Bing.com – [http://www.davemanuel.com/inflation-calculator.php Dave Manuel's Inflation Calculator] Retrieved 21 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt; in benefits for victims of the disaster by giving special concerts in which versions of "Autumn" and "Nearer My God To Thee" were part of the programme.&lt;ref name="NYTimes 1912-04-30"/&gt; In Britain, relief funds were organised for the families of ''Titanic''{{-'}}s lost crew members, raising nearly £450,000 (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|450000|1912|r=-6}}}} today). One such fund was still in operation as late as the 1960s.{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=174}}

In the United States and Britain, more than 60 survivors combined to sue the White Star Line for damages connected to loss of life and baggage.&lt;ref name="Fort Wayne"/&gt; The claims totalled $16,804,112 (appr. $419 million in 2018 USD), which was far in excess of what White Star argued it was responsible for as a [[Limited liability company]] under American law.&lt;ref name="NY Times"/&gt; Because the bulk of the litigants were in the United States, White Star petitioned the [[United States Supreme Court]] in 1914, which ruled in its favour that it qualified as an LLC and found that the causes of the ship's sinking were largely unforeseeable, rather than due to negligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_vault/2013/04/16/titanic_lawsuits_claim_from_one_third_class_passenger_tells_harrowing_story.html| title=After the Titanic, the Lawsuits| author=Rebecca Onion| publisher=Slate.com| date=2013-04-16| access-date=2018-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sharply limited the scope of damages survivors and family members were entitled to, prompting them to reduce their claims to some $2.5 million. White Star only settled for $664,000 (appr. $16.56 million in 2018), about 27% of the original total sought by survivors.&lt;ref name="NY Times"/&gt; The settlement was agreed to by 44 of the claimants in December 1915, with $500,000 set aside for the American claimants, $50,000 for the British, and $114,000 to go towards interest and legal expenses.&lt;ref name="Fort Wayne"&gt;{{cite article| url=https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-owners-settle.html| title=Titanic Owners Offer to Settle for $664,000| publisher=Fort Wayne Gazette| date=1915-12-18| access-date=2018-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NY Times"&gt;{{cite article| url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1915/12/18/170357322.pdf| title=TITANIC CLAIMANTS TO ACCEPT $664,000; Tentative Settlement Reached by Lawyers Representing Both Sides.

=== Investigations into the disaster ===
{{main|United States Senate inquiry into the sinking of the RMS Titanic|British Wreck Commissioner's inquiry into the sinking of the RMS Titanic}}

Even before the survivors arrived in New York, investigations were being planned to discover what had happened, and what could be done to prevent a recurrence. Inquiries were held in both the United States and United Kingdom, the former more robustly critical of traditions and practices, and scathing of the failures involved, and the latter broadly more technical and expert-oriented.{{sfn|Barczewski|2006|pp=70–1}}

The [[United States Senate inquiry into the sinking of the RMS Titanic|U.S. Senate's inquiry into the disaster]] was initiated on 19 April, a day after ''Carpathia'' arrived in New York.{{sfn|Brewster|Coulter|1998|p=72}} The chairman, Senator [[William Alden Smith]], wanted to gather accounts from passengers and crew while the events were still fresh in their minds. Smith also needed to subpoena all surviving British passengers and crew while they were still on American soil, which prevented them from returning to the UK before the American inquiry was completed on 25 May.&lt;ref name="Senate"/&gt; The British press condemned Smith as an opportunist, insensitively forcing an inquiry as a means of gaining political prestige and seizing "his moment to stand on the world stage". Smith, however, already had a reputation as a campaigner for safety on U.S. railroads, and wanted to investigate any possible malpractices by railroad tycoon J. P. Morgan, ''Titanic''{{-'}}s ultimate owner.{{sfn|Butler|1998|pp=180–186}}

The [[British Wreck Commissioner's inquiry into the sinking of the RMS Titanic|British Board of Trade's inquiry into the disaster]] was headed by [[John Bigham, 1st Viscount Mersey|Lord Mersey]], and took place between 2 May and 3 July. Being run by the Board of Trade, who had previously approved the ship, it was seen by some as having little interest in its own or White Star's conduct being found negligent.{{sfn|Barczewski|2006|pp=70–71, 182}}

Each inquiry took testimony from both passengers and crew of ''Titanic'', crew members of Leyland Line's ''Californian'', Captain [[Arthur Rostron]] of ''Carpathia'' and other experts.{{sfn|Butler|1998|pp=192–194}} The British inquiry also took far greater expert testimony, making it the longest and most detailed court of inquiry in British history up to that time.{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=194}} The two inquiries reached broadly similar conclusions: the regulations on the number of lifeboats that ships had to carry were out of date and inadequate,{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=195}} Captain Smith had failed to take proper heed of ice warnings,{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=189}} the lifeboats had not been properly filled or crewed, and the collision was the direct result of steaming into a dangerous area at too high a speed.{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=195}}

Neither inquiry's findings listed negligence by IMM or the White Star Line as a factor. The American inquiry concluded that since those involved had followed standard practice the disaster was an [[act of God]].{{sfn|Barczewski|2006|p=67}} The British inquiry concluded that Smith had followed long-standing practice that had not previously been shown to be unsafe,{{sfn|Lynch|1992|p=189}} noting that British ships alone had carried 3.5 million passengers over the previous decade with the loss of just 10 lives,{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=265}} and concluded that Smith had done "only that which other skilled men would have done in the same position". Lord Mersey did however find fault with the "extremely high speed (twenty-two knots) which was maintained" following numerous ice warnings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lord Mersey's Report on the Loss of the "Titanic"|journal=Nature|date=25 April 1912|volume=89|issue=2232|pages=581–584|doi=10.1038/089581d0|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt; noting that without hindsight, "what was a mistake in the case of the ''Titanic'' would without doubt be negligence in any similar case in the future".{{sfn|Lynch|1992|p=189}}

The recommendations included strong suggestions for major changes in maritime regulations to implement new safety measures, such as ensuring that more lifeboats were provided, that lifeboat drills were properly carried out and that wireless equipment on passenger ships was manned around the clock.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=223}} An [[International Ice Patrol]] was set up to monitor the presence of icebergs in the North Atlantic, and maritime safety regulations were harmonised internationally through the [[International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea]]; both measures are still in force today.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=310}}

On 18 June 1912, [[Guglielmo Marconi]] gave evidence to the Court of Inquiry regarding the telegraphy. Its final report recommended that all liners carry the system and that sufficient operators maintain a constant service.&lt;ref&gt;Court of Inquiry ''Loss of the S.S. Titanic'' 1912&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Role of the SS ''Californian'' ====
[[File:Californian.jpg|thumb|250px|The {{SS|Californian}}, which had tried to warn ''Titanic'' of the danger from pack-ice]]

One of the most controversial issues examined by the inquiries was the role played by {{SS|Californian}}, which had been only a few miles from ''Titanic'' but had not picked up her distress calls or responded to her signal rockets. ''Californian'' had warned ''Titanic'' by radio of the pack ice (that was the reason ''Californian'' had stopped for the night) but was rebuked by ''Titanic''{{-'}}s senior wireless operator, [[Jack Phillips (wireless officer)|Jack Phillips]].{{sfn|Butler|2002|p=160}}

Testimony before the British inquiry revealed that at 10:10&amp;nbsp;p.m., ''Californian'' observed the lights of a ship to the south; it was later agreed between Captain [[Stanley Lord]] and Third Officer C.V. Groves (who had relieved Lord of duty at 11:10&amp;nbsp;p.m.) that this was a passenger liner.{{sfn|Butler|2002|p=160}} At 11:50&amp;nbsp;p.m., the officer had watched that ship's lights flash out, as if she had shut down or turned sharply, and that the port light was now visible.{{sfn|Butler|2002|p=160}} Morse light signals to the ship, upon Lord's order, were made between 11:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. and 1:00&amp;nbsp;a.m., but were not acknowledged.{{sfn|Butler|2002|p=161}} If ''Titanic'' was as far from the ''Californian'' as Lord claimed, then he knew, or should have known, that Morse signals would not be visible. A reasonable and prudent course of action would have been to awaken the wireless operator and to instruct him to attempt to contact ''Titanic'' by that method. Had Lord done so, it is possible he could have reached ''Titanic'' in time to save additional lives.&lt;ref name=wsj1/&gt;

Captain Lord had gone to the chartroom at 11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. to spend the night;{{sfn|Butler|2002|p=159}} however, Second Officer Herbert Stone, now on duty, notified Lord at 1:10&amp;nbsp;a.m. that the ship had fired five rockets. Lord wanted to know if they were company signals, that is, coloured flares used for identification. Stone said that he did not know and that the rockets were all white. Captain Lord instructed the crew to continue to signal the other vessel with the Morse lamp, and went back to sleep. Three more rockets were observed at 1:50&amp;nbsp;a.m. and Stone noted that the ship looked strange in the water, as if she were [[Angle of list|listing]]. At 2:15&amp;nbsp;a.m., Lord was notified that the ship could no longer be seen. Lord asked again if the lights had had any colours in them, and he was informed that they were all white.{{sfn|Chirnside|2004|p=344}}

''Californian'' eventually responded. At around 5:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., Chief Officer George Stewart awakened wireless operator [[Cyril Furmstone Evans]], informed him that rockets had been seen during the night, and asked that he try to communicate with any ship. He got news of ''Titanic''{{'}}s loss, Captain Lord was notified, and the ship set out to render assistance. She arrived well after ''Carpathia'' had already picked up all the survivors.{{sfn|Butler|2002|pp=164–165}}

The inquiries found that the ship seen by ''Californian'' was in fact ''Titanic'' and that it would have been possible for ''Californian'' to come to her rescue; therefore, Captain Lord had acted improperly in failing to do so.{{sfn|Butler|2002|pp=191, 196}}{{efn| Lord protested his innocence to the end of his life, and many researchers have asserted that the known positions of ''Titanic'' and ''Californian'' make it impossible that the former was the infamous "mystery ship", a topic which has "generated ... millions of words and ... hours of heated debates" and continues to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Paul Rogers |url=http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/the-titanic-and-the-indifferent-stranger.html |title=The ''Titanic'' and the Indifferent Stranger |publisher=Encyclopedia-titanica.org |date= |accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Survivors and victims ===
{{main|List of Titanic passengers}}
&lt;!--[[File:Titanic casualties.svg|thumb|Breakdown of casualties according to the British Board of Trade report [[Media:Titanic casualties.svg|(click for detail)]]]] May be read in the subarticle, please don't clutter.--&gt;

The number of casualties of the sinking is unclear, due to a number of factors. These include confusion over the passenger list, which included some names of people who cancelled their trip at the last minute, and the fact that several passengers travelled under aliases for various reasons and were therefore double-counted on the casualty lists.{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=239}} The death toll has been put at between 1,490 and 1,635&amp;nbsp;people.{{sfn|Lord|1976|p=197}} The tables below use figures from the British [[Board of Trade]] report on the disaster.{{sfn|Mersey|1912|pp=110–111}} While the use of Marconi wireless system did not achieve the result of bringing a rescue ship to the ''Titanic'' before it sank, the use of wireless did bring the ''Carpathia'' in time to rescue some of the survivors who otherwise would have perished due to exposure.&lt;ref&gt;Hsu, J.  (17 April 2012). "How Marconi's Wireless Tech Helped Save ''Titanic'' Passengers", New York: NBC News. Accessed at: http://www.nbcnews.com/id/47046053/ns/technology_and_science-innovation/t/how-marconis-wireless-tech-helped-save-titanic-passengers/&lt;/ref&gt;

The water temperature in the area where ''Titanic'' sank, which was well below normal, also contributed to the rapid death of many passengers during the sinking. Water temperature readings taken around the time of the accident were reported to be {{convert|28|°F}}. Typical water temperatures were normally in the mid-40&amp;nbsp;°F range during mid-April.&lt;ref&gt;Lipman, D. (11 April 2012). "The weather during the ''Titanic'' disaster: looking back 100 years", ''The Washington Post''.  Accessed at: https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/post/the-weather-during-the-titanic-disaster-looking-back-100-years/2012/04/11/gIQAAv6SAT_blog.html&lt;/ref&gt; The coldness of the water was a critical factor, often causing death within minutes for many of those in the water.

Fewer than a third of those aboard ''Titanic'' survived the disaster. Some survivors died shortly afterwards; injuries and the effects of exposure caused the deaths of several of those brought aboard ''Carpathia''.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1994|p=179}} The figures show stark differences in the survival rates of the different classes aboard ''Titanic''. Although only 3% of first-class women were lost, 54% of those in third class died. Similarly, five of six first-class and all second-class children survived, but 52 of the 79 in third class perished. The differences by gender were even bigger: nearly all female crew members, first and second class passengers were saved. Men from the First Class died at a higher rate than women from the Third Class.{{sfn|Howells|1999|p=94}} In total, 50% of the children survived, 20% of the men and 75% of the women.

The last living survivor, [[Millvina Dean]] from England, who at only nine weeks old was the youngest passenger on board, died aged 97 on 31 May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/01/last-titanic-survivor-dies Last ''Titanic'' survivor, a baby put in a lifeboat, dies at 97] ''The Guardian''.

=== Retrieval and burial of the dead ===
[[File:RMS Titanic Graves in Fairview Cemetery.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=Photograph|Markers of ''Titanic'' victims, [[Fairview Cemetery, Halifax, Nova Scotia|Fairview Cemetery]], Halifax, Nova Scotia]]
Once the massive loss of life became known, White Star Line chartered the cable ship [[CS Mackay-Bennett|CS ''Mackay-Bennett'']] from [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]], to retrieve bodies.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=228}} Three other Canadian ships followed in the search: the cable ship ''Minia'',{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=232}} lighthouse supply ship ''Montmagny'' and [[seal hunting|sealing vessel]] ''Algerine''.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=234}} Each ship left with embalming supplies, undertakers, and clergy. Of the 333 victims that were eventually recovered, 328 were retrieved by the Canadian ships and five more by passing North Atlantic steamships.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=225}}{{efn|Most of the bodies were numbered, however, the five passengers [[burial at sea|buried at sea]] by ''Carpathia'' went unnumbered.&lt;ref name="gov ns ca bodies"/&gt;}}

The first ship to reach the site of the sinking, the CS&amp;nbsp;''Mackay-Bennett'', found so many bodies that the embalming supplies aboard were quickly exhausted. Health regulations required that only embalmed bodies could be returned to port.&lt;ref name="gov ns ca victims"/&gt; Captain Larnder of the ''Mackay-Bennett'' and undertakers aboard decided to preserve only the bodies of first class passengers, justifying their decision by the need to visually identify wealthy men to resolve any disputes over large estates. As a result, many third class passengers and crew were buried at sea. Larnder identified many of those buried at sea as crew members by their clothing, and stated that as a mariner, he himself would be contented to be buried at sea.&lt;ref name="funeral ship"/&gt;

Bodies recovered were preserved for transport to Halifax, the closest city to the sinking with direct rail and steamship connections. The Halifax coroner, [[John Henry Barnstead]], developed a detailed system to identify bodies and safeguard personal possessions. Relatives from across North America came to identify and claim bodies. A large temporary morgue was set up in the [[curling]] rink of the [[Mayflower Curling Club]] and undertakers were called in from all across eastern Canada to assist.&lt;ref name="funeral ship"/&gt; Some bodies were shipped to be buried in their home towns across North America and Europe. About two-thirds of the bodies were identified. Unidentified victims were buried with simple numbers based on the order in which their bodies were discovered. The majority of recovered victims, 150&amp;nbsp;bodies, were buried in three Halifax cemeteries, the largest being [[Fairview Cemetery, Halifax, Nova Scotia|Fairview Lawn Cemetery]] followed by the nearby [[Mount Olivet Cemetery (Halifax)|Mount Olivet]] and [[Baron de Hirsch Cemetery, Halifax|Baron de Hirsch]] cemeteries.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|pp=244–245}}

In mid-May 1912, {{RMS|Oceanic|1899|6}} recovered three bodies over {{convert|200|mi|km}} from the site of the sinking who were among the original occupants of Collapsible&amp;nbsp;A. When Fifth Officer [[Harold Lowe]] and six crewmen returned to the wreck site sometime after the sinking in a lifeboat to pick up survivors, they rescued a dozen males and one female from Collapsible&amp;nbsp;A, but left the dead bodies of three of its occupants.{{efn|Thomson Beattie, a first class passenger, and two crew members, a fireman and a seaman.}} After their retrieval from Collapsible&amp;nbsp;A by ''Oceanic'', the bodies were buried at sea.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|pp=242–243}}

The last ''Titanic'' body recovered was steward James McGrady, Body No. 330, found by the chartered Newfoundland sealing vessel ''Algerine'' on 22 May and buried at [[Fairview Cemetery, Halifax, Nova Scotia|Fairview Lawn Cemetery]] in Halifax on 12 June.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Ruffman, ''Titanic Remembered: The Unsinkable Ship and Halifax'' Formac Publishing (1999), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only 333 bodies of ''Titanic'' victims were recovered, one in five of the over 1,500 victims. Some bodies sank with the ship while currents quickly dispersed bodies and wreckage across hundreds of miles making them difficult to recover. By June, one of the last search ships reported that life jackets supporting bodies were coming apart and releasing bodies to sink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://museum.gov.ns.ca/mmanew/en/home/whattoseedo/Titanic/FAQ.aspx#5 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130125202240/http://museum.gov.ns.ca/mmanew/en/home/whattoseedo/Titanic/FAQ.aspx#5 |archivedate=25 January 2013 |title=Why So Few? |publisher=Museum.gov.ns.ca |date= |accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wreck ==
{{main|Wreck of the RMS Titanic}}
[[File:Titanic wreck bow.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The bow of the wrecked RMS ''Titanic'', photographed in June 2004]]

''Titanic'' was long thought to have sunk in one piece and, over the years, many schemes were put forward for raising the wreck. None came to fruition.{{sfn|Ward|2012|p=166}} The fundamental problem was the sheer difficulty of finding and reaching a wreck that lies over {{convert|12000|ft|m}} below the surface, in a location where the water pressure is over {{convert|6,500|psi|bar}}.{{sfn|Spignesi|2012|p=221}} A number of expeditions were mounted to find ''Titanic'' but it was not until 1 September 1985 that a Franco-American expedition led by [[Robert Ballard]] succeeded.{{sfn|Ward|2012|pp=171–172}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Paper says Titanic discovered|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/834054/paper_says_titanic_discovered/?|work=The San Bernardino County Sun|date=1 September 1985|page=3|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The team discovered that ''Titanic'' had in fact split apart, probably near or at the surface, before sinking to the seabed. The separated bow and stern sections lie about a third of a mile (0.6&amp;nbsp;km) apart in [[Titanic Canyon]] off the coast of Newfoundland. They are located {{convert|13.2|mi|km}} from the inaccurate coordinates given by ''Titanic''{{-'}}s radio operators on the night of her sinking,{{sfn|Halpern|Weeks|2011|pp=126–127}} and approximately {{convert|715|mi|0|abbr=out}} from Halifax and {{convert|1250|mi|0|abbr=out}} from New York.

Both sections struck the sea bed at considerable speed, causing the bow to crumple and the stern to collapse entirely. The bow is by far the more intact section and still contains some surprisingly intact interiors. In contrast, the stern is completely wrecked; its decks have pancaked down on top of each other and much of the hull plating was torn off and lies scattered across the sea floor. The much greater level of damage to the stern is probably due to structural damage incurred during the sinking. Thus weakened, the remainder of the stern was flattened by the impact with the sea bed.{{sfn|Ballard|1987|p=205}}

The two sections are surrounded by a debris field measuring approximately {{convert|5|x|3|mi|km}}.{{sfn|Canfield|8 March 2012}} It contains hundreds of thousands of items, such as pieces of the ship, furniture, dinnerware and personal items, which fell from the ship as she sank or were ejected when the bow and stern impacted on the sea floor.{{sfn|Ballard|1987|p=203}} The debris field was also the last resting place of a number of ''Titanic''{{-'}}s victims. Most of the bodies and clothes were consumed by sea creatures and bacteria, leaving pairs of shoes and boots—which have proved to be inedible—as the only sign that bodies once lay there.{{sfn|Ballard|1987|p=207}}

Since its initial discovery, the wreck of ''Titanic'' has been revisited on numerous occasions by explorers, scientists, filmmakers, tourists and salvagers, who have recovered thousands of items from the debris field for conservation and public display. The ship's condition has deteriorated significantly over the years, particularly from accidental damage by submersibles but mostly because of an accelerating rate of growth of iron-eating bacteria on the hull.{{sfn|Ward|2012|p=171}} In 2006, it was estimated that within 50 years the hull and structure of ''Titanic'' would eventually collapse entirely, leaving only the more durable interior fittings of the ship intermingled with a pile of rust on the sea floor.{{sfn|Crosbie|Mortimer|2006|p=last page (no page number specified)}}

Many artefacts&lt;!-- ARTEFACTS is the correct spelling in British English --&gt; from ''Titanic'' have been recovered from the sea bed by RMS Titanic Inc., which exhibits them in touring exhibitions around the world and in a permanent exhibition at the [[Luxor Las Vegas]] hotel and casino in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]].{{sfn|Spignesi|2012|p=259}} A number of other museums exhibit artefacts&lt;!-- ARTEFACTS is the correct spelling in British English --&gt; either donated by survivors or retrieved from the floating bodies of victims of the disaster.{{sfn|Ward|2012|pp=248, 251}}

On 16 April 2012, the day after the 100th anniversary of the sinking, photos were released showing possible human remains resting on the ocean floor. The photos, taken by [[Robert Ballard]] during an expedition led by [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] in 2004, show a boot and a coat close to ''Titanic'''s stern which experts called "compelling evidence" that it is the spot where somebody came to rest, and that human remains could be buried in the sediment beneath them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/travel/news/human-remains-at-titanic-shipwreck-site/story-fn32891l-1226327630683 "Human remains pictured at Titanic shipwreck site"].

This means that all states party to the convention will prohibit the pillaging, commercial exploitation, sale and dispersion of the wreck and its artefacts. Because of the location of the wreck in [[international waters]] and the lack of any exclusive jurisdiction over the wreckage area, the convention provides a state co-operation system, by which states inform each other of any potential activity concerning ancient shipwreck sites, like the ''Titanic'', and co-operate to prevent unscientific or unethical interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/underwater-cultural-heritage/the-heritage/did-you-know/titanic/ |title=Titanic &amp;#124; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |publisher=Unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/Titanics-remains-to-come-under-Unescos-protection/articleshow/12551324.cms | title= Titanic's remains to come under Unesco's protection

=== Safety ===
{{Main|Changes in safety practices after the sinking of the RMS Titanic}}
[[File:USCG International Ice Patrol C-130.jpg|thumb|250px|An ice patrol aircraft inspecting an iceberg]]

After the disaster, recommendations were made by both the British and American Boards of Inquiry stating that ships should carry enough lifeboats for all aboard, mandated lifeboat drills would be implemented, lifeboat inspections would be conducted, etc. Many of these recommendations were incorporated into the [[International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea]] passed in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.captainsvoyage-forum.com/showthread.php/1294-SOLAS-and-the-requirement-of-lifeboats-on-passenger-vessels |title=Captainsvoyage-forum, lifeboat requirements |publisher=Captainsvoyage-forum.com |date= |accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The convention has been updated by periodic amendments, with a completely new version adopted in 1974.&lt;ref name="IMO-1974"&gt;''[http://www.imo.org/About/Conventions/ListOfConventions/Pages/International-Convention-for-the-Safety-of-Life-at-Sea-(SOLAS),-1974.aspx International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS)]''. [[International Maritime Organization]], 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Signatories to the convention followed up with national legislation to implement the new standards. For example in Britain, new "Rules for Life Saving Appliances" were passed by the [[Board of Trade]] on 8 May 1914 and then applied at a meeting of British steamship companies in Liverpool in June 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Conlin |first=Dan |url=http://marinecurator.blogspot.ca/2013/04/new-artifact-titanic-report-that.html |title=A Titanic Report that Changed History |publisher=Marinecurator.blogspot.ca |date=15 April 2013 |accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, the United States government passed the [[Radio Act of 1912]]. This act, along with the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, stated that radio communications on passenger ships would be operated 24 hours a day, along with a secondary power supply, so as not to miss distress calls. Also, the Radio Act of 1912 required ships to maintain contact with vessels in their vicinity as well as coastal onshore radio stations.&lt;ref name="marconi"&gt;{{cite web|last=Minichiello, P.E. |first=Ray |title=TITANIC Tragedy Spawns Wireless Advancements |publisher=The Guglielmo Marconi Foundation, U.S.A., Inc. |url=http://www.marconiusa.org/history/titanic.htm |accessdate=30 September 2016 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19981203092341/http://www.marconiusa.org/history/titanic.htm |archivedate=3 December 1998 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it was agreed in the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea that the firing of red rockets from a ship must be interpreted as a sign of need for help. Once the Radio Act of 1912 was passed it was agreed that rockets at sea would be interpreted as distress signals only, thus removing any possible misinterpretation from other ships.&lt;ref name="marconi"/&gt;

Finally, the disaster led to the formation and international funding of the [[International Ice Patrol]], an agency of the United States Coast Guard that to the present day monitors and reports on the location of North Atlantic Ocean icebergs that could pose a threat to transatlantic sea traffic. Coast Guard aircraft conduct the primary reconnaissance. In addition, information is collected from ships operating in or passing through the ice area. Except for the years of the two World Wars, the International Ice Patrol has worked each season since 1913. During the period there has not been a single reported loss of life or property due to collision with an iceberg in the patrol area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/index.php?pageName=IIPHome |title=Navigation Center, Ice Patrol |publisher=Navcen.uscg.gov |date= |accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912, the [[Board of Trade]] [[bareboat charter|chartered]] the [[barque]] {{ship||Scotia|barque|2}} to act as a [[weather ship]] in the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland]], keeping a look-out for icebergs. A [[Marconi Company|Marconi]] [[wireless telegraphy|wireless]] was installed to enable her to communicate with stations on the coast of [[Labrador]] and [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]].&lt;ref name=Times150213&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The ice danger in the North Atlantic |day_of_week=Saturday |date=15 February 1913 |page_number=4 |issue=40136 |column=C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stamp&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mikeskidmore.supanet.com/st-br-scotia.htm |title=45p SY Scotia |publisher=Mike Skidmore |accessdate=17 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030922142819/http://www.mikeskidmore.supanet.com/st-br-scotia.htm |archivedate=22 September 2003 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Titanic'' has gone down in history as the ship that was called unsinkable.{{efn|An example is Daniel Butler's book about RMS ''Titanic'', titled ''Unsinkable''}} For more than 100 years, she has been the inspiration of fiction and non-fiction. She is commemorated by monuments for the dead and by museums exhibiting artefacts from the wreck. Just after the sinking, memorial postcards sold in huge numbers{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=327}} together with memorabilia ranging from tin candy boxes to plates, whiskey jiggers,{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|pp=329–330}} and even black mourning teddy bears.{{sfn|Maniera|2003|p=50}} Several survivors wrote books about their experiences{{sfn|Rasor|2001|p=77}} but it was not until 1955 the first historically accurate book ''[[A Night to Remember (book)|A Night to Remember]]'' was published.{{sfn|Lord|2005|p=xii}}

The first film about the disaster, ''[[Saved from the Titanic]]'', was released only 29 days after the ship sank and had an actual survivor as its star—the silent film actress [[Dorothy Gibson]].{{sfn|Spignesi|2012|p=267}} The British film [[A Night to Remember (1958 film)|''A Night to Remember'' (1958)]] is still widely regarded as the most historically accurate movie portrayal of the sinking.{{sfn|Heyer|2012|p=104}} The most financially successful by far has been [[James Cameron]]'s ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (1997), which became the highest-grossing film in history up to that time,{{sfn|Parisi|1998|p=223}} as well as the winner of 11 [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] at the [[70th Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Cameron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oscar.go.com/oscar-history/year/1998|title=The Oscars 2015 News, Blogs &amp; Articles - Academy Awards â€" Oscars 2015&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Titanic'' disaster was commemorated through a variety of memorials and monuments to the victims, erected in several English-speaking countries and in particular in cities that had suffered notable losses. These included Southampton, Liverpool and Belfast in the United Kingdom; New York and Washington, D.C. in the United States; and Cobh (formerly Queenstown) in Ireland.{{sfn|Spignesi|2012|pp=262–263}} A number of museums around the world have displays on ''Titanic'', the most prominent is in [[Belfast]], the ship's birthplace (see next section).

RMS Titanic Inc., which is authorised to salvage the wreck site, has a permanent ''Titanic'' exhibition at the [[Luxor Las Vegas]] hotel and casino in [[Nevada]] which features a 22-ton slab of the ship's hull. It also runs an exhibition which travels around the world.{{sfn|Ward|2012|p=252}} In Nova Scotia, Halifax's [[Maritime Museum of the Atlantic]] displays items that were recovered from the sea a few days after the disaster. They include pieces of woodwork such as panelling from the ship's First Class Lounge and an original deckchair,{{sfn|Ward|2012|p=251}} as well as objects removed from the victims.{{sfn|Spignesi|2012|p=261}} In 2012 the centenary was marked by plays, radio programmes, parades, exhibitions and special trips to the site of the sinking together with commemorative stamps and coins.&lt;ref name="Southampton2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ITV com Titanic"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/mar/28/iceberg-right-ahead-review Iceberg Right Ahead!—review] ''The Guardian''.

In a frequently commented-on literary coincidence, [[Morgan Robertson]] authored a novel called ''[[Futility, or the Wreck of the Titan|Futility]]'' in 1898 about a fictional British passenger liner with the plot bearing a number of similarities to the ''Titanic'' disaster. In the novel the ship is the SS ''Titan'', a four-stacked liner, the largest in the world and considered unsinkable. And like the ''Titanic'', she sinks after hitting an iceberg and does not have enough lifeboats.&lt;ref name="Titanic - Futilityu"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.historyonthenet.com/Titanic/futility.htm | title=Titanic – Futility | accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====In Northern Ireland====
Only recently has the significance of ''Titanic'' most notably been given by [[Northern Ireland]] where it was built by [[Harland and Wolff]] in the capital city, [[Belfast]]. While the rest of the world embraced the glory and tragedy of ''Titanic'', in its birth city, ''Titanic'' remained a taboo subject throughout the 20th century. The sinking brought tremendous grief and was a blow to the city's pride. But its shipyard was also a place many Catholics regarded as hostile.&lt;ref name="Titanic Centre opens"&gt;{{cite news|title=New ''Titanic'' Belfast complex opens|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-17571457|accessdate=3 February 2018|publisher=BBC|date=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter half of the century, during a 30-year sectarian conflict ''Titanic'' was a reminder of the lack of civil rights that in part contributed towards [[the Troubles]]. While the fate of Titanic remained a well-known story within local households throughout the 20th century, commercial investment around RMS ''Titanic''{{'s}} legacy was modest because of these issues.&lt;ref name="belfast-embraces-the-titanic"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dalby|first1=Douglas|title=Raising the Memory of the Titanic, and a City’s Role in Its Creation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/16/world/europe/belfast-embraces-the-titanic.html|accessdate=3 February 2018|publisher=New York Times|date=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Troubles and [[Good Friday Agreement]], the number of overseas tourists visiting Northern Ireland dramatically increased to 30 million (100% rise by 2008).&lt;ref name="NI Tourism stats"&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Rourke|first1=Richard|title=Reducing Ireland’s Oil Dependence: additional thoughts|url=https://aspoireland.wordpress.com/2011/10/17/dependence-additional-thoughts/|website=aspoireland|accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently identified in the Northern Ireland Tourism Board's Strategic Framework for Action 2004–2007 that the significance of and interest in ''Titanic'' globally (partly due to the [[Titanic (1997 film)|1997 film ''Titanic'']]) was not being fully exploited as a tourist attraction.&lt;ref name="tourism in Northern Ireland"&gt;{{cite web|title=a strategic framework for action 2004–2007|url=http://titanicbelfast.com/BlankSite/files/e7/e7c46933-2dc2-4e6d-a04c-7f189057b2ca.pdf|website=nitb|publisher=Northern Ireland Tourist Board|accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, ''Titanic'' Belfast® was spearheaded, along with some smaller projects, such as a [[Titanic Memorial, Belfast|''Titanic'' memorial]].&lt;ref name="Birth of ''Titanic'' Belfast"&gt;{{cite web|title=Birth of ''Titanic'' Belfast|url=http://titanicbelfast.com/Explore/The-Titanic-Belfast-Building/The-Birth-of-Titanic-Belfast.aspx|website=nitb|publisher=Northern Ireland Tourist Board|accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 on the ship's centenary, [[Titanic Belfast|''Titanic'' Belfast]] visitor attraction was opened on the site of the shipyard where ''Titanic'' was built.{{sfn|BBC News|31 March 2012}} It was Northern Ireland's second most visited tourist attraction with almost 700,000 visitors in 2016.&lt;ref name="''Titanic'' Quarter"&gt;{{cite news|title=IN FULL: NI's top tourist attractions for 2016|url=https://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/business/in-full-ni-s-top-tourist-attractions-for-2016-1-7979222|accessdate=3 February 2018|publisher=News Letter|date=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite over [[List of ships built by Harland and Wolff|1,600 ships]] being built by [[Harland and Wolff]] in Belfast Harbour, Queen's Island became renamed after its most famous ship, [[Titanic Quarter]] in 1995. Once a sensitive story, ''Titanic'' is now considered one of Northern Ireland's most iconic and uniting symbols.&lt;ref name="''Titanic'' unites community"&gt;{{cite news|title=BUILDING A PROSPEROUS  AND UNITED COMMUNITY:  A PROGRESS REPORT|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/249239/Building_a_Prosperous_and_United_Community_-_A_Progress_Report__publication_version_.PDF|accessdate=3 February 2018|publisher=British Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late August 2018, several groups were vying for the right to purchase the 5,500 ''Titanic'' relics that were an asset of the bankrupt [[Premier Exhibitions]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2018/07/news-titanic-uk-belfast-bankruptcy-cameron/|title=James Cameron: Getting Titanic Artifacts to U.K. Would Be 'a Dream'|author=Dawn McCarty, Jef Feeley, Chris Dixon|first=|date=2018-07-24|website=|publisher=National Geographic|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2018-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, [[Titanic Belfast|''Titanic'' Belfast]], Titanic Foundation Limited and the [[National Museums Northern Ireland]] joined with the [[National Maritime Museum]] as a consortium that was raising money to purchase the 5,500 artifacts. The group intended to keep all of the items together as a single exhibit. Oceanographer [[Robert Ballard]] said he favored this bid since it would ensure that the memorabilia would be permanently displayed in Belfast (where the Titanic was built) and in [[Greenwich]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The museums were critical of the bid process set by the Bankruptcy court in Jacksonville, Florida. The minimum bid for the 11 October 2018 auction was set at US$21.5 million (£16.5m) and the consortium did not have enough funding to meet that amount.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-45766021 Titanic: Salvaged treasure may not return to Belfast BBC 5 October 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jaxdailyrecord.com/article/the-basch-report-titanic-artifacts-finally-to-be-sold-at-auction Bankrupt Premier Exhibitions Inc. owns 5,500 items from the ill-fated ocean liner The Basch Report 3 October 2018]&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 October 2018, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that a consortium of three [[Hedge fund|hedge funds]]—[[Apollo Global Management]], Alta Fundamental Advisers, and PacBridge Capital Partners—had paid US$19.5 million for the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/17/business/titanic-treasures-bids-hedge-funds.html|title=The Titanic’s Artifacts Are About to Change Hands.

[[File:White Swan Hotel Olympic Suite.jpg|thumb|First Class Lounge of the ''Olympic'' which was almost identical to that of the ''Titanic'', seen today as a dining room in the White Swan Hotel, Alnwick]]

There have been several proposals and studies for a project to build a [[ship replica|replica ship]] based on the Titanic. A project by South African businessman Sarel Gaus was abandoned in 2006, and a project by Australian businessman [[Clive Palmer]] was announced in 2012, known as the ''[[Titanic II]]''.

A Chinese shipbuilding company known as Wuchang Shipbuilding Industry Group Co., Ltd commenced construction in January 2014 to build [[Titanic replica (Sichuan, China)|a replica ship of the ''Titanic'']] for use in a resort. The vessel will house many features of the original, such as a ballroom, dining hall, theatre, first-class cabins, economy cabins and swimming pool.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.skynews.com.au/culture/offbeat/2016/12/05/china-to-build-full-size-titanic-replica.html|title=China to build full-size Titanic replica|last=Ltd|first=Australian News Channel Pty|access-date=25 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-11/30/c_135870964.htm|first=Mu|last=Xuequan

It will be permanently docked at the resort and feature an audiovisual simulation of the sinking, which has caused some criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/titanic-replica-china-iceberg-collision-seven-star-energy-a7448331.html|title=Full size Titanic replica will stage ‘simulation’ of iceberg collision in China|date=30 November 2016|work=The Independent|access-date=25 March 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RMS ''Olympic'' was the sister ship of the ''Titanic''. The interior decoration of the dining salon and the grand staircase were in identical style and created by the same craftsmen. Large parts of the interior of the ''Olympic'' were later sold and are now in the [[White Swan Hotel, Alnwick]], which gives an impression of how the interior of the ''Titanic'' looked.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3504">The '''Samaritan's dilemma''' is a dilemma in the act of [[charity (practice)|charity]]. It hinges on the idea that when presented with charity, in some location such as a [[soup kitchen]], a person will act in one of two ways: using the charity to improve their situation, or coming to rely on charity as a means of survival. The term ''Samaritan's dilemma'' was coined by economist [[James M. Buchanan]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YwoWAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Samaritan%27s+dilemma%22&amp;dq=%22Samaritan%27s+dilemma%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BqiUT5rlN6jG6AHFi_GPBA&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBg Roger E. Meiners, "Victim Compensation", Lexington Books, 1978 p. 99]&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument against charity frequently cites the Samaritan's dilemma as reason to forgo charitable contributions. It is also a common argument against [[communism]] and [[socialism]], claiming that state [[aid]] is equivalent to charity, and that the beneficiaries of such aid will become [[Sloth (deadly sin)|slothful]] or otherwise negligent members of [[society]]. The more aid that is received the less likely the recipient will seek out a permanent solution for their condition. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fee.org/articles/the-samaritans-dilemma-and-the-welfare-state/|title=The Samaritans Dilemma and the Welfare State {{!}} E.C. Pasour|date=1991-06-01|access-date=2018-04-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dilemma's name is a reference to the biblical [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]].

== Samaritan's dilemma in disaster preparedness ==
A study published in 2016 looked at 5089 major [[Natural disaster|natural disasters]] in 81 [[Developing country|developing countries]] over a 33 year period. Results showed that among the countries that received natural disaster relief had less incentives to provide their own natural disaster protections. This effect is exacerbated the poorer and less-developed the country is that receives the aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raschky|first=Paul A.|last2=Schwindt|first2=Manijeh|title=Aid, Catastrophes and the Samaritan's Dilemma|url=https://doi-org.ezproxy.uky.edu/10.1111/ecca.12194|journal=Economica|volume=83|issue=332|pages=624–645|doi=10.1111/ecca.12194}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Avoiding the Samaritan's dilemma ==
Much foreign aid comes in the form of monetary compensation for damages or direct relief such as food or water. This type of direct aid does not provide any incentive for the recipient to become independent. By introducing incentives that developing countries can meet by building up natural disaster protection the effects of the Samaritan's dilemma can be effectively mitigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/60856158|title=The samaritan's dilemma : the political economy of development aid|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Gibson, Clark C., 1961-|isbn=9780199278848|location=Oxford|oclc=60856158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arms of Acland.svg|thumb|200px|Arms of Acland: ''Chequy argent and sable, a fesse gules'']]
'''Sir Hugh Acland, 5th Baronet''' (ca. 1639 – 9 March 1714) was an English [[Member of Parliament]], from a family of Devonshire gentry. He obtained a confirmation of the family baronetcy in 1678, and served as a Member of Parliament for two boroughs in Devon in 1679 and from 1685 to 1687. Never very active in national politics, he was one of the many Tories estranged by James II's pro-Catholicism, but remained a Tory after the Glorious Revolution. He continued to hold local office in Devon off and on until his death in 1714, when he was succeeded by his grandson.

==Career==
He was a younger son of [[Sir John Acland, 1st Baronet]] and his wife Elizabeth. He matriculated at [[Exeter College, Oxford]] on 27 November 1652 and received his B.A. on 22 June 1655.&lt;ref name="foster"&gt;{{cite book | title=Alumni Oxonienses 1500-1714 | editor-first=Joseph | editor-last=Foster | year=1891 | location=Oxford | url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/alumni-oxon/1500-1714/pp1-28 | accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was appointed a [[justice of the peace]] for Devon in 1670, and in 1672, he succeeded his nephew [[Sir Arthur Acland, 4th Baronet|Arthur]] as baronet and inherited an estate worth £2,000 per year. In 1673, he was appointed a commissioner for assessment in Devon, and unsuccessfully contested a by-election at [[Tiverton (UK Parliament constituency)|Tiverton]] following the death of [[Sir Thomas Carew, 1st Baronet]]. He was appointed to the commission on recusants in 1675 and made a freeman of [[Exeter]]; in 1676, he was appointed a [[deputy lieutenant]] of the county.&lt;ref name="hop"&gt;{{HistoryofParliament|1660|first=J. S. |last=Crossette |title=ACLAND, Sir Hugh, 1st of 5th Bt. (c.1639-1714), of Killerton, Devon. |url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1660-1690/member/acland-sir-hugh-1639-1714}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family baronetcy was of somewhat uncertain status; the [[letters patent]] to his father were either lost during the confusion of the [[English Civil War]] or never passed the seals. Sir Hugh's predecessors in the baronetcy had generally died in their minorities and had not pursued the claim. Hugh obtained new letters patent dated 21 January 1678 which confirmed the original grant and granted [[Order of precedence in England and Wales|precedence]] to the baronetcy of the original date of issue, 24 June 1644.&lt;ref name="hop" /&gt;

Acland again stood for Parliament for [[Barnstaple (UK Parliament constituency)|Barnstaple]] in the [[English general election, March 1679|spring 1679 election]] and was successfully returned. He was not an active member and, though thought to be a Court supporter, was absent from the division on the [[Exclusion Crisis|exclusion bill]]. He did not stand again in the [[English general election, October 1679|fall 1679 election]]. In 1680, he left the Devon committee for assessment; he was already a colonel of militia foot by this time.&lt;ref name="hop" /&gt;

He stood for [[Devon (UK Parliament constituency)|Devon]] in the [[English general election, 1681|1681 election]] but was defeated. Appointed a justice of the peace and an alderman for [[Tiverton, Devon|Tiverton]] in 1683, he was returned to Parliament for that constituency as a Tory in [[English general election, 1685|1685]], and elected mayor of the town the following year. He was also appointed a JP for [[South Molton]] in 1684. After the collapse of the [[Monmouth Rebellion]], he was appointed a commissioner for rebels' estates. Once again, he was largely inactive in Parliament, serving on the committee to prevent the export of wool.&lt;ref name="hop" /&gt; In 1687, the Tiverton corporation was remodelled by [[quo warranto]] proceedings and he was removed from his offices there.&lt;ref name="tiverton"&gt;{{HistoryofParliament|1660 |first=John P. |last=Ferris |title=Tiverton |url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1660-1690/constituencies/tiverton}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1688 he joined with many of the Devonshire gentry in repeating the temporizing answer given by [[Sir Edward Seymour, 4th Baronet|Sir Edward Seymour]] to the "Three Questions" of [[James II of England|James II]], and was consequently dismissed from his county offices.&lt;ref name="hop" /&gt;

Acland was reappointed a JP for Devon in October 1688 and served on the commission for assessment again from 1689 to 1690. He was [[High Sheriff of Devon]] in 1690. He refused to sign the Association in 1696 and was removed from the bench at this time. Reappointed in 1700, he apparently refused a deputy lieutenancy in 1701 due to a quarrel with Sir Edward Seymour. Off the bench again in 1702, he was appointed to the deputy lieutenancy again in 1703 and a JP for the third time in about 1704. He continued to serve in these posts throughout the reign of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], and died on 9 March 1714.&lt;ref name="hop" /&gt;

==Family==
He married Anne, daughter of Sir Thomas Daniel of Beswick Hall, Yorkshire, on 19 March 1674 and had seven children:&lt;ref name="visitation"&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Vivian | editor-first=John Lambrick | editor-link=John Lambrick Vivian | title=The Visitations of the County of Devon: Comprising the Heralds' Visitations of 1531, 1564 &amp; 1620 | publisher=H.S.

Burke's Peerage confuses Arthur Daniel with his nephew Arthur (d. 1740), the son of John Acland.}}

'''Sultan-Ahmed Magomedsalihovich Ibragimov''' ({{lang-ru|Султан-Ахмед Магомедсалихович Ибрагимов}}; born 8 March 1975)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/SPORT/06/03/olympics.savon/index.html |title=CNN.com - Felix Savon - Jun 8, 2004 |website=Edition.cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a Russian former [[professional boxer]] who competed from 2002 to 2008, and held the [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] [[heavyweight]] title from 2007 to 2008. As an [[amateur boxing|amateur]] he won silver medals at the [[2000 Olympics]] and [[2000 European Amateur Boxing Championships|2000 European Championships]], and bronze at the [[2001 World Amateur Boxing Championships|2001 World Championships]], all in the heavyweight division.

Ibragimov is only the sixth [[southpaw stance|southpaw]] world heavyweight champion in history: the others being [[Michael Moorer]], [[Corrie Sanders]], [[Chris Byrd]], [[Ruslan Chagaev]], and [[Charles Martin (boxer)|Charles Martin]].

==Professional career==
Ibragimov turned professional and rose through the heavyweight ranks by knocking out journeymen [[Al Cole]], [[Zuri Lawrence]], [[Friday Ahunanya]] and [[Lance Whitaker]]. On 28 July 2007, Ibragimov's record improved to 19-0-1 when he fought to a draw with [[Ray Austin (boxer)|Ray Austin]] in a grueling 12 round [[IBF]] heavyweight title eliminator.

===WBO heavyweight champion===
{{Main article|Sultan Ibragimov vs. Evander Holyfield}}
Despite the draw against Ray Austin, Ibragimov received a title shot from another sanctioning organization, the [[WBO]]. He was scheduled to challenge [[Shannon Briggs]] for the WBO heavyweight title on 10 March 2007, but because Briggs became ill with pneumonia, Ibragimov instead faced [[Javier Mora (Boxer)|Javier Mora]] at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York on that date. Ibragimov knocked out [[Javier Mora (Boxer)|Mora]] 46 seconds into the first round.  This win broke the record for the quickest knockout in a main event bout in Madison Square Garden, which was previously held by [[Lee Savold]] who defeated [[Buddy Walker]] in 1948.

Ibragimov faced the heavy-handed WBO Heavyweight Champion Shannon Briggs in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]] on 2 June 2007. With an exception of an early and late pressure by Briggs in round one &amp; twelve, rounds two to eleven were mostly controlled by Ibragimov, out-boxing his larger opponent with fast combinations.

On 13 October 2007, Sultan Ibragimov won his first title defense against  the aging former heavyweight champion [[Evander Holyfield]] by unanimous decision&lt;ref&gt;''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', Issue No.47, 327 (Friday, 3 August 2007), 'Holyfield steps back into the ring', Article by Gareth A. Davies&lt;/ref&gt;  for the WBO heavyweight title at [[Khodynka Arena]] in [[Moscow, Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=2958364 |title=Holyfield replaces Chagaev as Ibragimov's opponent |website=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2007-08-02 |accessdate=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibragimov fought [[Wladimir Klitschko]] on 23 February 2008 at [[Madison Square Garden]].  This fight was a unification bout laying the two fighters' [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]], [[International Boxing Organization|IBO]], and [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] titles on the line. This was the only title unification since 1999 when Lennox Lewis and Evander Holyfield fought.

===Unification bout against Wladimir Klitschko===
{{Main article|Wladimir Klitschko vs. Sultan Ibragimov}}

He was defeated by Wladimir Klitschko by way of a unanimous decision. Ibragimov had his moments, but for the most part was unable to get past Klitschko's long jab and occasional straight right hand, he struggled to land any significant punches on his larger opponent.

===Retirement===
In February 2009 there were rumors about Ibragimov's retirement from boxing following his loss to Wladimir Klitschko,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.klitschkoblog.com/2009/02/sultan-ibragimov-retires.html|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120904111317/http://www.klitschkoblog.com/2009/02/sultan-ibragimov-retires.html|deadurl=yes|title=Sultan Ibragimov Retires|date=4 September 2012|archivedate=4 September 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
which were later confirmed in July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=4367766 |title=Former heavyweight champ Sultan Ibragimov retires |website=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2009-07-31 |accessdate=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxingnews24.com/2009/07/sultan-ibragimov-retires-boxing |title=Sultan Ibragimov retires - Boxing - Boxing News |website=Boxingnews24.com |date=2009-07-29 |accessdate=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a largely undistinguished career, Ibragimov retired as one of only five heavyweight champions, along side [[Gene Tunney]], [[Rocky Marciano]], [[Riddick Bowe]] and [[Nicolai Valuev]] to have never suffered a stoppage defeat.

==Personal life==
Ibragimov is of [[Caucasian Avars|Avar]] [[Dagestan]]i descent, and is Muslim by faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/15/magazine/15Briggs.t.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/B/Briggs,%20Shannon&amp;pagewanted=all|title=Shannon Briggs Says Nyet|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2016-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; His cousin, [[Timur Ibragimov]], is also a former heavyweight professional boxer. However, while Sultan competed for Russia, Timur represented Uzbekistan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928000928/http://www.boxinginsider.com/news/stories/146258129.php ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mma365.com/interviews/sultan_ibragimov.html|title=Exclusive interview with heavyweight boxing prospect Sultan Ibragimov|date=13 October 2007|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013130748/http://mma365.com/interviews/sultan_ibragimov.html|archivedate=13 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[https://arxiv.org/abs/0903.1069  Tensor-Entanglement-Filtering Renormalization Approach and Symmetry Protected Topological Order ],  Phys. Rev. '''B80''', 155131 (2009); 
Frank Pollmann, Erez Berg, Ari M. Turner, Masaki Oshikawa,
[https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.4059 Symmetry protection of topological order in one-dimensional quantum spin systems ],  Phys. Rev. '''B85''',  075125 (2012).
&lt;/ref&gt;
is a kind of order in  [[absolute zero|zero-temperature]]  quantum-mechanical states of matter that have  a symmetry and a finite energy gap.

To derive the results in a most-invariant way,  [[renormalization group|renormalization group methods]] are used (leading to equivalence classes corresponding to certain fixed points).&lt;ref name=defspt /&gt; The SPT order  has the following defining properties:

(a) ''distinct SPT states with a given symmetry cannot be smoothly deformed into each other without a phase transition, if the deformation preserves the symmetry''. &lt;br&gt;
(b) ''however, they all can be smoothly deformed into the same trivial product state without a phase transition, if the symmetry is broken during the deformation''.

The above definition works for both bosonic systems and fermionic systems, which leads to the notions of bosonic SPT order and fermionic SPT order.

Using the notion of [[quantum entanglement]], we can say that SPT states
are [[short-range entanglement|short-range entangled]] states ''with a symmetry'' (by contrast: for long-range entanglement see [[topological order]], which is not related to the famous [[EPR paradox]]).
Since short-range entangled states have only trivial [[topological order]]s 
we may also refer the SPT order as Symmetry Protected "Trivial" order.

==Characteristic properties of SPT order==

# The boundary effective theory of a non-trivial SPT state always has pure [[Anomaly matching condition|gauge anomaly]] or mixed gauge-gravity anomaly for the symmetry group.&lt;ref&gt;
Xiao-Gang Wen,
''Classifying gauge anomalies through SPT orders and classifying gravitational anomalies through topological orders''
Phys. Rev. D 88, 045013 (2013); arXiv:1303.1803.
&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the boundary of a SPT state is either gapless or degenerate, regardless how we cut the sample to form the boundary. A gapped non-degenerate boundary is impossible for a non-trivial SPT state.  If the boundary is a gapped degenerate state, the degeneracy may be caused by  spontaneous symmetry breaking and/or (intrinsic) topological order.
# [[Monodromy defects]] in non-trivial 2+1D SPT states carry non-trival statistics&lt;ref&gt;
Michael Levin, Zheng-Cheng Gu,
''Braiding statistics approach to symmetry-protected topological phases'',
Phys. Rev. B 86, 115109 (2012),  arXiv:1202.3120.
&lt;/ref&gt; and fractional quantum numbers&lt;ref&gt;
Xiao-Gang Wen,
''Topological invariants of symmetry-protected and symmetry-enriched topological phases of interacting bosons or fermions'',
 arXiv:1301.7675.
&lt;/ref&gt; of the symmetry group. Monodromy defects are created by twisting the boundary condition along a cut by a symmetry transformation. The ends of such cut are the monodromy defects. For example, 2+1D bosonic Z&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; SPT states are classified by a Z&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; integer ''m''. One can show that ''n'' identical elementary monodromy defects in a Z&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; SPT state labeled by ''m'' will carry a total Z&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; quantum number ''2m'' which is not a multiple of ''n''. 
# 2+1D bosonic U(1) SPT states have a Hall conductance that is quantized as an even integer.&lt;ref&gt;
Yuan-Ming Lu, Ashvin Vishwanath,
''Theory and classification of interacting 'integer' topological phases in two dimensions: A Chern–Simons approach'',
Phys. Rev. B 86, 125119 (2012),  arXiv:1205.3156.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Zheng-Xin Liu, Jia-Wei Mei, Peng Ye, and Xiao-Gang Wen, "U(1)×U(1) symmetry protected topological order in Gutzwiller wave functions", Phys. Rev. B 90, 235146 (2014), arXiv:1408.1676.&lt;/ref&gt; 2+1D bosonic SO(3) SPT states have a quantized spin Hall conductance.&lt;ref&gt;

''Symmetry protected Spin Quantum Hall phases in 2-Dimensions'',
Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 067205 (2013), arXiv:1205.7024.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation between SPT order and (intrinsic) topological order==
SPT states are short-range entangled while topologically ordered states are long-range entangled.
Both intrinsic [[topological order]], and also SPT order, can sometimes have protected [[gapless boundary excitation]]s. The difference is subtle: the gapless boundary excitations in intrinsic [[topological order]] can be robust against any local perturbations, while the gapless boundary excitations in SPT order are robust only against local perturbations ''that do not break the symmetry''. So the gapless boundary excitations in intrinsic [[topological order]] are topologically protected, while the gapless boundary excitations in SPT order are ''symmetry protected''.&lt;ref&gt;One should also note the semantical subtleness of the name SPT: "symmetry protected"  does not mean that the stability of the state is  conserved "because of the symmetry", but it is  just meant that the symmetry is ''kept'' by the interactions corresponding to the process.&lt;/ref&gt;

We also know that an intrinsic [[topological order]] has emergent [[fractional charge]], emergent [[fractional statistics]], and emergent [[gauge theory]]. In contrast, a SPT order has no emergent [[fractional charge]]/[[fractional statistics]] for finite-energy excitations, nor emergent [[gauge theory]] (due to its short-range entanglement). Note that the monodromy defects discussed above are not finite-energy excitations in the spectrum of the Hamiltonian, but defects created by '''modifying''' the Hamiltonian.

==Examples of SPT order==

The first example of SPT order is the [[AKLT|Haldane phase]] of odd-integer-spin chain.&lt;ref&gt;
F. D. M. Haldane, Phys. Rev. Lett. 50, 1153 (1983), Phys.
Lett. 3,464 (1983); I. Affleck and F. D. M. Haldane, Pyhs.
Rev. B 36, 5291 (1987); I. Affleck, J. Phys.: Condens.
Matter. 1, 3047 (1989).
&lt;/ref&gt; It is a SPT phase protected by [[SO(3)]] spin rotation symmetry.&lt;ref name=defspt/&gt; 
(Note that Haldane phases of even-integer-spin chain do not have SPT order.)
A more well known example of SPT order is the [[topological insulator]] of non-interacting fermions, a SPT phase protected by [[U(1)]] and [[time reversal symmetry]].

On the other hand, fractional [[quantum Hall effect|quantum Hall]] states are not SPT states. They are states with (intrinsic) topological order and long-range entanglements.

==Group cohomology theory for SPT phases==

Using the notion of [[quantum entanglement]], one obtains the following general picture of gapped
phases at zero temperature. All gapped zero-temperature phases can be divided into two classes: [[long-range entanglement|long-range entangled]] phases (''ie'' phases with intrinsic [[topological order]]) and [[short-range entanglement|short-range entangled]] phases (''ie'' phases with no intrinsic [[topological order]]). All short-range entangled phases can be further divided into three classes:  [[Spontaneous symmetry breaking|symmetry-breaking]] phases, SPT phases, and their mix (symmetry breaking order and SPT order can appear together).

It is well known that [[Spontaneous symmetry breaking|symmetry-breaking]] orders are described by [[group theory]]. For bosonic SPT phases with pure gauge anomalous boundary, it was shown that they are classified by [[group cohomology]] theory:&lt;ref name=spt&gt;

Just like group theory can give us 230 crystal structures in 3+1D, [[group cohomology]] theory can give us various SPT phases in any dimensions with any on-site symmetry groups.

On the other hand, the fermionic SPT orders are described by [[group super-cohomology]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;
Zheng-Cheng Gu, [[Xiao-Gang Wen]],
[https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.2648 Symmetry-protected topological orders for interacting fermions – fermionic topological non-linear sigma-models and a group super-cohomology theory ]
&lt;/ref&gt; So the group (super-)cohomology theory allows us to construct many
SPT orders even for interacting systems, which include  interacting topological insulator/superconductor.

==A complete classification of 1D gapped quantum phases (with interactions)==

Using the notions of [[quantum entanglement]] and SPT order, one can obtain
a complete classification of all 1D gapped quantum phases.

First, it is shown that there is no (intrinsic) [[topological order]] in 1D (''ie'' all 1D gapped states
are short-range entangled).&lt;ref&gt;
F. Verstraete, J. I. Cirac, J. I. Latorre, E. Rico, and M. M.
Wolf, Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 140601 (2005).
&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, if the Hamiltonians have no symmetry, all their 1D gapped quantum states belong to one phase—the phase of trivial product states.
On the other hand, if the Hamiltonians do have a symmetry,  their 1D gapped quantum states 
are either [[Spontaneous symmetry breaking|symmetry-breaking]] phases, SPT phases, and their mix.

Such an understanding allows one to classify all 1D gapped quantum phases:&lt;ref name=spt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

84, 165139, (2011), [https://arxiv.org/abs/1010.3732 arXiv:1010.3732].
&lt;/ref&gt; All 1D gapped phases are classified by
the following three mathematical objects: &lt;math&gt;(G_H, G_\Psi, H^{2} [G_\Psi , U(1)])&lt;/math&gt; , where &lt;math&gt;G_H&lt;/math&gt; is the symmetry group of the Hamiltonian, &lt;math&gt;G_\Psi&lt;/math&gt; the symmetry group of the ground states, and &lt;math&gt;H^{2} [G_\Psi, U(1)]&lt;/math&gt; the second [[group cohomology]] class of &lt;math&gt;G_\Psi&lt;/math&gt;. (Note that &lt;math&gt;H^{2} [G, U(1)]&lt;/math&gt; classifies the projective representations of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.) If there is no symmetry breaking (''ie'' &lt;math&gt;G_\Psi=G_H&lt;/math&gt;), the 1D gapped phases are classified by the projective representations of symmetry group &lt;math&gt;G_H&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Systems art''' is [[art]] influenced by [[cybernetics]], and [[systems theory]], that reflects on natural systems, social systems and social signs of the [[art world]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aat-ned.nl/wwwopac.exe?database=aat&amp;language=1&amp;TAB=&amp;%250=2583 Systems art], Dutch Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus, retrieved March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Systems art emerged as part of the first wave of the [[conceptual art]] movement extended in the 1960s and 1970s. Closely related and overlapping terms are ''[[Anti-form movement]]'', ''[[Cybernetic art]]'', ''Generative Systems'', ''[[Process art]]'', ''Systems aesthetic'', ''Systemic art'', ''Systemic painting'' and ''Systems sculptures''.

==Related fields of systems art==

=== Anti-form movement ===
By the early 1960s Minimalism had emerged as an abstract movement in art (with roots in [[geometric abstraction]] via [[Malevich]], [[the Bauhaus]] and [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]]) which rejected the idea of relational, and subjective painting, the complexity of [[Abstract expressionist]] surfaces, and the emotional [[zeitgeist]] and polemics present in the arena of [[Action painting]]. Minimalism argued that extreme simplicity could capture all of the sublime representation needed in art. The term '''Systematic art''' was coined by [[Lawrence Alloway]] in 1966 as a description of the method artists, such as [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Al Held]] and [[Frank Stella]],  were using for composing [[abstract painting]]s.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;Chilvers, Ian and Glaves-Smith, John, ''A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art'', second edition (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2009), p. 694. {{ISBN|0199239665}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Associated with painters such as [[Frank Stella]], minimalism in painting, as opposed to other areas, is a modernist movement. Depending on the context, minimalism might be construed as a precursor to the postmodern movement. Seen from the perspective of writers who sometimes classify it as a postmodern movement, early minimalism began and succeeded as a modernist movement to yield advanced works, but which partially abandoned this project when a few artists changed direction in favor of the anti-form movement.

In the late 1960s the term [[Postminimalism]] was coined by [[Robert Pincus-Witten]]&lt;ref&gt;''Movers and Shakers, New York'', "Leaving C&amp;M", by Sarah Douglas, [[Art &amp; Auction|Art+Auction]], March 2007, V.XXXNo7.&lt;/ref&gt; to describe minimalist derived art which had content and contextual overtones which minimalism rejected, and was applied to the work of [[Eva Hesse]], [[Keith Sonnier]], [[Richard Serra]] and new work by former minimalists [[Robert Smithson]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Sol LeWitt]], and Barry Le Va, and others. Minimalists like [[Donald Judd]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[John McCracken (artist)|John McCracken]] and others continued to produce their [[Late modernism|late modernist]] paintings and sculpture for the remainder of their careers.

=== Cybernetic art ===
[[File:Tsai opticalpainting.jpg|thumb|right|''Optical Painting'' by [[Wen-Ying Tsai]] (1964)]] 
Audio feedback and the use of tape loops, sound synthesis and computer generated compositions reflected a cybernetic awareness of information, systems and cycles. Such techniques became widespread in the 1960s in the music industry. The visual effects of electronic feedback became a focus of artistic research in the late 1960s, when video equipment first reached the consumer market. [[Steina and Woody Vasulka]], for example, used "all manner and combination of audio and video signals to generate electronic feedback in their respective of corresponding media."&lt;ref name="RA 07"&gt;[[Edward A. Shanken]], "From Cybernetics to Telematics: The Art, Pedagogy, and Theory of Roy Ascott," in Roy Ascott (2003, 2007), ''Telematic Embrace: Visionary Theories of Art, Technology, and Consciousness'', University of California, {{ISBN|0-520-22294-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

With related work by Edward Ihnatowicz, [[Wen-Ying Tsai]] and cybernetician [[Gordon Pask]] and the animist kinetics of Robert Breer and [[Jean Tinguely]], the 1960s produced a strain of cybernetic art that was very much concerned with the shared circuits within and between the living and the technological. A line of cybernetic art theory also emerged during the late 1960s. Writers like Jonathan Benthall and [[Gene Youngblood]] drew on cybernetics and cybernetic. The most substantial contributors here were the British artist and theorist [[Roy Ascott]] with his essay "Behaviourist Art and the Cybernetic Vision" in the journal Cybernetica (1966–67), and  the American critic and theorist [[Jack Burnham]]. In ''Beyond Modern Sculpture'' from 1968 Burnham builds cybernetic art into an extensive theory that centers on art's drive to imitate and ultimately reproduce life.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell Whitelaw (2004), ''Metacreation: Art and Artificial Life'', MIT Press, {{ISBN|0-262-23234-0}} p.17-18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in 1968, curator Jasia Reichardt organized the landmark exhibition, Cybernetic Serendipity, at the Institute of Contemporary Art in London.

=== Generative systems ===
{{main|Generative art}}
[[File:Dombis 1687.jpg|thumb|Installation view of ''Irrational Geometrics'' 2008 by [[Pascal Dombis]]]]
Generative art is [[art]] that has been generated, composed, or constructed in an [[algorithmic art|algorithmic]] manner through the use of systems defined by [[computer]] [[software]] [[algorithms]], or similar [[mathematical]] or mechanical or [[random]]ised autonomous processes. [[Sonia Landy Sheridan]] established Generative Systems as a program at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] in 1970 in response to social change brought about in part by the computer-robot communications revolution.&lt;ref name = "SLS 83"&gt;Sonia Landy Sheridan, "Generative Systems versus Copy Art: A Clarification of Terms and Ideas", in: ''[[Leonardo Journal|Leonardo]]'', Vol. 16, No. 2 (Spring, 1983), pp. 103-108. {{doi|10.2307/1574794}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program, which brought artists and scientists together, was an effort at turning the artist's passive role into an active one by promoting the investigation of contemporary scientific—technological systems and their relationship to art and life. Unlike copier art, which was a simple commercial spin-off, Generative Systems was actually involved in the development of elegant yet simple systems intended for creative use by the general population. Generative Systems artists attempted to bridge the gap between elite and novice by directing the line of communication between the two, thus bringing first generation information to greater numbers of people and bypassing the entrepreneur.&lt;ref name = "SLS 83"/&gt;

=== Process art ===
{{main|Process art}}
[[File:Bolognini-CIMs.JPG|thumb|right|[[Maurizio Bolognini]], ''Collective Intelligence Machines'' series (CIMs, from 2000). These are generative and interactive installations using the mobile phone network and participation technologies taken from e-democracy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurizio Bolognini]], "De l'interaction à la démocratie. Vers un art génératif post-digital" / [http://www.bolognini.org/lectures/amx.htm "From interactivity to democracy. Towards a post-digital generative art"], in ''Ethique, esthétique, communication technologique'', Edition L'Harmattan. Paris, 2011, pp. 229-239.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Process art is an [[artistic movement]] as well as a creative sentiment and world view where the end product of ''art'' and ''craft'', the ''[[:wikt:objet d’art|objet d’art]]'', is not the principal focus. The 'process' in process art refers to the process of the formation of art: the gathering, sorting, collating, associating, and patterning.  Process art is concerned with the actual ''doing''; art as a [[rite]], [[ritual]], and [[performance]]. Process art often entails an inherent motivation, rationale, and [[intentionality]]. Therefore, art is viewed as a creative journey or process, rather than as a deliverable or end product.
In the artistic discourse the work of [[Jackson Pollock]] is hailed as an antecedent. Process art in its employment of [[serendipity]] has a marked correspondence with [[Dada]]. Change and transience are marked themes in the process art movement. The [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] states that Robert Morris in 1968 had a groundbreaking exhibition and essay defining the movement and the Museum Website states as "Process artists were involved in issues attendant to the body, random occurrences, improvisation, and the liberating qualities of nontraditional materials such as wax, felt, and latex. Using these, they created eccentric forms in erratic or irregular arrangements produced by actions such as cutting, hanging, and dropping, or organic processes such as growth, condensation, freezing, or decomposition".&lt;ref&gt;Source:  {{cite web |url=http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/glossary_Process_art.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200906/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/glossary_Process_art.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }} (accessed: Thursday, March 15, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Systemic art ===
According to Chilvers (2004) "earlier in 1966 the British art critic [[Lawrence Alloway]] had coined the term "Systemic art", to describe a type of abstract art characterized by the use of very simple standardized forms, usually geometric in character, either in a single concentrated image or repeated in a system arranged according to a clearly visible principle of organization. He considered the chevron paintings of [[Kenneth Noland]] as examples of Systemic art, and considered this as a branch of [[Minimal art]]".&lt;ref&gt;"Systemic art." The Oxford Dictionary of Art. Ed. Ian Chilvers. Oxford University Press, 2004. eNotes.com. 2006. 19 Mar, 2008 [http://www.enotes.com/oxford-art-encyclopedia/ systemic-art]&lt;/ref&gt;

John G. Harries considered a common ground in the ideas that underlie developments in 20th-century art such as [[Serial art]], Systems Art, [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] and [[Kinetic art]]. These kind of arts often do not stem directly from observations of things visible in the external natural environment, but from the observation of depicted shapes and of the relationship between them.&lt;ref name = "JGH 81"&gt;John G. Harries, "Personal Computers and Notated Visual Art", in: ''[[Leonardo Journal|Leonardo]]'', Vol. 14, No. 4 (Autumn, 1981), pp. 299-301.&lt;/ref&gt; Systems art, according to Harries, represents a deliberate attempt by artists to develop a more flexible frame of reference. A style in which its frame of reference is taken as a model to be emulated rather than as a cognitive systems, that only leads to the institutionalization of the imposed model. But to transfer the meaning of a picture to its location within a systemic structure does not remove the need to define the constitutive elements of the system: if they are not defined, one will not know how to build the system.&lt;ref name = "JGH 81"/&gt;
[[Image:Roy-csnewskool.png|right|thumb|Newskool [[ASCII art]] Screenshot]]

=== Systemic painting ===
Systemic Painting, according to Auping (1989) "was the title of an highly influential exhibition at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] in 1966 assembled and introduction written by [[Lawrence Alloway]] as curator. The show contained numerous works that many critics today would consider part of the [[Minimal art]]".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Auping (1989), ''Abstraction, Geometry, Painting: Selected Geometric Abstract Painting'', Albright-Knox Art Gallery, page 72.&lt;/ref&gt; In the catalogue Alloway noted, that ... "paintings, such as those in this exhibition are not, as has been often claimed, impersonal. The personal is not expunged by using a neat technique: anonymity is not a consequence of highly finishing a painting".&lt;ref name = "LA 66"&gt;Lawrence Alloway, "Systemic Painting", in: ''Minimal Art: A Critical Anthology'', by Gregory Battcock (1995). p.19.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "systemic painting" later on has become the name for artists who employ systems make a number of aesthetic decisions before commencing 
to paint.&lt;ref&gt;John Albert Walker (1973), ''Glossary of Art, Architecture, and Design Since 1945: Terms and Labels'', p.197.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Systems sculpture ===
According to Feldman (1987) "[[serial art]], serial painting, systems sculpture and [[ABC art]], were art styles of the 1960s and 1970s in which simple geometric configurations are repeated with little or no variation. Sequences becomes important as in mathematics and linguistic context. These works rely on simple arrangements of basic volumes and voids, mechanically produced surfaces, and algebraic permutations of form. The impact on the viewer, however, is anything but simple".&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Burke Feldman (1987), ''Composition (Art)'', H.N. Abrams, {{ISBN|0-13-940602-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Trow Ghyll skeleton''' is a set of human remains discovered on 24 August 1947 in a cave near [[Clapham, North Yorkshire|Clapham]] in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]]. It was named after a prominent topographical feature located some {{convert|800|m|yd|sigfig=1}} away. Although the identity of the body has never been ascertained, it has been claimed that they were those of a [[Germany|German]] [[Espionage|spy]]. The unexplained death has been described as "the most notable" mystery over a possible Nazi agent in Britain.

==Discovery==
On 24 August 1947, two friends who were keen [[Caving|potholers]] decided to go out looking for new potholes to explore near the famous [[Ingleborough Cave]]. They were Jim Leach (23 December 1920 &amp;ndash; 15 March 2000) who was then working as an [[electrician]] and living at [[Great Harwood]] near [[Blackburn]], and Harold Burgess (1918 &amp;ndash; 11 August 2000), then a motor [[engineer]] and living in [[Leeds]]. The two were good friends (known as "Jim and Budge") who were members of the [[Northern Pennine Club]] and later became business partners.

At about 12:30 PM, they discovered a small hole  (subsequently named Body Pot) which was partly obscured by stones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brook|first=Alan|first2=D.|last2=Brook|first3= J.|last3=Griffiths|first4= M.H.|last4=Long,|title=Northern Caves, Volume 2 The Three Peaks|pages=174|isbn=1-85568-033-5|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; On moving the stones to make the entrance bigger, Leach climbed down about 10 feet where he saw a pair of shoes. Looking round he then saw the skull and the rest of the body, under a large stone (although it was not resting on the body); the remains had suffered advanced decomposition and there was hardly any flesh remaining. Burgess spotted near the body a small bottle of white powder which he assumed to be [[flash powder]].

Leach and Burgess returned to Clapham to raise the alarm and later that afternoon returned to the cave with Police Sergeant Nock of [[Ingleton, Yorkshire|Ingleton]]; the police stationed a guard outside the cave until the body could be photographed and then removed the following day. The remains were taken to [[Skipton]] mortuary and the effects found in the cave were sent to the [[forensics|forensic laboratory]] at [[Wakefield]]. The local community was quickly reassured that foul play had been ruled out as a cause of death.

===A second skeleton===
By coincidence, a week later on 31 August another skeleton was found not far away at [[Gaping Gill]]. These remains were unidentified but were found to be those of a man of between 25 and 35 years, who had died two or three years previously, and had been killed in a fall down the cave.

==Inquest==
The findings of the various checks on the discovery were reported to an [[inquest]] held on 25 November at Skipton town hall before [[Coroner]] Stephen E. Brown and a jury. Leach and Burgess gave evidence of their discovery, and the police witnesses told of how they had preserved the evidence and transmitted it to the appropriate authorities. The main evidence at the inquest was given by the scientific witnesses.

===Post mortem examination===
On 26 August Professor P. L. Sutherland conducted a [[post mortem]] examination on the body. He found that the remains were those of a man who was 5 ft. 5 ¼ in. tall, aged between 22 and 30 at the time of death, and that death had occurred at least two and no more than six years before. He was able to rule out broken or diseased bones as a cause of death (none were fractured or broken), although not all of them were present. The bones were entirely separate from each other and the brain had disappeared; his clothes had rotted to the point where it was difficult to distinguish them.

===Forensic tests===
Lewis Nickolls of the North East Forensic Science Laboratory reported that the man had been wearing a blue shirt and tie, and a grey-blue suit with red and white stripes "about three to the inch". He had a tweedy herringbone overcoat, grey [[trilby]] hat, and a plum coloured scarf (which would have been over the mouth at the time of death). He also had light brown to auburn hair. 

The most interesting evidence dealt with those of the man's possessions which had not rotted away. The glass bottle seen by Burgess turned out not to contain flash powder, but [[Sodium cyanide]], a lethal poison. The bottle was full to the shoulder although it was possible, said Nickolls, to have extracted a lethal dose from it. An unbroken [[ampule]] of the same material was also found. Of his other possessions, the man had coins to the value of 11 shillings 5 ½ pence, with none of the coins newer than 1939. Nickolls said that the date of death would have been two years after that.

There were two pairs of shoes, one of which had been made in 1938 and the other in 1939. There was a mineral water bottle of a type supplied to hotels in [[Morecambe]], [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] and Ingleton, and containing a blue 'crown' top not introduced until 1940. Other items found with the man included a wristlet watch, handkerchief, shaving tube, studs, toothbrush, fountain pen, propelling pencil, compass, box of matches, tablets, flashlamp, and toiletries. The man had a key but the police were unable to identify the lock which it opened.

==Identity==
When the body was discovered, wide publicity was given and several people came forward to link missing relatives to the remains. The police compiled the suggestions into a list of 18, of which four turned out to be alive, ten were ruled out for bearing no resemblance to the remains, and for the four remaining it was impossible to say whether they were the man. The inquest returned a verdict that there was insufficient evidence of cause of death and to identify the remains.

==Mystery==
At the inquest, Nicholls had been asked about the cyanide phial and ampule and said that it was used commercially and as a poison for vermin. However, he had to admit that he had not seen the same design before. The legal historian [[A. W. B. Simpson]], who was living in Clapham at the time of the discovery, later noted that the only known users of such an ampule were spies operating in enemy countries, who had them in order to commit [[suicide]] in the event that they were discovered.

Simpson claimed that the individual was "plainly connected in some way with the German secret service" and that he was "the most notable .. mystery" over a German agent. He further remarked that "Such enquiries as I have made from persons who ought to know have produced evasiveness".

However, Simpson's claims are not supported by German intelligence documents discovered after the war. According to the British domestic security service, [[MI5]], Germany had sent around 115 agents against Britain during the course of the war. Almost all of these had been successfully identified and caught, with the exception of [[Willem Ter Braak]] &amp;ndash; not the body found at Trow Ghyll &amp;ndash; who had committed suicide before being captured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mi5.gov.uk/output/Page122.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060213171706/http://www.mi5.gov.uk/output/Page122.html |archivedate=2006-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="99094">[[Torture]], the infliction of severe physical or psychological pain upon an individual to extract information or a confession, or as an illicit [[extrajudicial punishment]], is prohibited by [[international law]] and is illegal in most countries. However, it is still used by many governments. The subject of this article is the use of torture since the adoption of the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR), which prohibited it.

==Torture in modern society==

Torture is widely practiced worldwide: [[Amnesty International]] received reports of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in more than 150 countries during the four-year period from 1997 to 2000. These accusations concerned acts against [[political prisoner]]s in 70 countries and other prisoners and detainees in more than 130 countries.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, [https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ACT40/001/2003 ''Combating torture – a manual for action''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202125125/http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ACT40/001/2003 |date=2 December 2012 }}, October 2002, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; State torture has been extensively documented and studied, often as part of efforts at [[truth and reconciliation commission|collective memory and reconciliation]] in societies that have experienced a change in government. Surveys of torture survivors reveal that torture "is not aimed primarily at the extraction of information ... Its real aim is to break down the victim's personality and identity."&lt;ref name=Tizon2002&gt;Orlando Tizon, CovertAction Quarterly, Summer 2002. Tizon is assistant director of the Torture Abolition and Survivors Support Coalition (TASSC) in Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; When applied indiscriminately, torture is used as a tool of repression and deterrence against dissent and community empowerment.

While many states use torture, few wish to be described as doing so, either to their own citizens or to international bodies. So a variety of strategies are used to circumvent their legal and humanitarian duties, including [[plausible deniability]], [[secret police]], "need to know", denial that certain activities constitute torture, appeal to various laws (national or international), use of a [[judicial jurisdiction|jurisdictional argument]], claim of "overriding need", the use of [[torture by proxy]], and so on.&lt;ref name=AIImpunity&gt;Amnesty International, [https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ACT40/024/2001 ''End impunity: Justice for the victims of torture''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230012927/http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ACT40/024/2001 |date=30 December 2013 }}, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all regimes and governments engaging in torture (and other crimes against humanity) consistently deny engaging in it, in spite of overwhelming [[hearsay]] and physical evidence from the citizens they tortured. Through both denial and avoidance of prosecution, most people ordering or carrying out acts of torture do not face legal consequences for their actions.&lt;ref name=AIImpunity /&gt; UN Special Rapporteur for the Commission on Human Rights, Sir [[Nigel Rodley]], believes that "impunity continues to be the principal cause of the perpetuation and encouragement of human rights violations and, in particular, torture."&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Rodley, "Report on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment," UN Document A/54/426, 1 October 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

While states, particularly their prisons, law enforcement, military and intelligence apparatus, are major perpetrators of torture, many [[non-state actor]]s also engage in it. These include [[paramilitary|paramilitaries]] and [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]]s, criminal actors such as [[organized crime]] syndicates and [[kidnappers]].

A recent approach to interrogations has been to use techniques such as [[waterboarding]], sexual humiliation and [[sexual abuse]], and [[war dog#Use against prisoners|dogs]] to intimidate or pressure prisoners in a manner claimed to be legal under national or international law. Electric shock techniques such as the use of [[stun belt]]s and [[taser]]s have been considered appropriate provided that they are used to "control" prisoners or suspects, even non-violent ones, rather than to extract information. These techniques have been widely criticized as torture.

==Technology==

While methods of torture are often quite crude, a number of new technologies of control have been used by torturers in recent years.  The Brazilian government devised a number of new electrical and mechanical means of torture during the military dictatorship from 1964 to 1985, and proceeded to train military officials from other right-wing Latin American countries in their techniques.&lt;ref name=Weschler1990a&gt;[[Lawrence Weschler]], ''A Miracle, A Universe: Settling Accounts with Torturers'', 1990: 62–63.&lt;/ref&gt; One is the use of tasers and electro-shock devices now widely sold to prison authorities around the world. Minor refinements of ancient techniques--including tearing out fingernails and toenails with iron tools, burning the soles of the feet with clothes irons, and probing between the toes with electric wood-burning pencils--are also widely applied.  Some African nations employ an iron foot-squeezing device patterned after the medieval French boot.

==Inter-state collaboration==

Substantial cooperation between states in the methods and coordination of torture has been documented. Through the [[Phoenix Program]], the United States helped [[South Vietnam]] co-ordinate a system of detention, torture and assassination of suspected members of the National Liberation Front, or [[Viet Cong]]. During the 1980s wars in Central America, the U.S. government provided manuals and training on [[interrogation]] that extended to the use of torture (see [[U.S. Army and CIA interrogation manuals]]). The manuals were also distributed by Special Forces Mobile Training teams to military personnel and intelligence schools in Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Peru. The manuals have a chapter devoted to "coercive techniques".

The southern cone governments of South America – Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Bolivia, Paraguay and Brazil – involved in [[Operation Condor]] co-ordinated the [[forced disappearance|disappearance]], torture and execution of dissidents in the 1970s. Hundreds were killed in coordinated operations, and the bodies of those recovered were often mutilated and showed signs of torture. This system operated with the knowledge and support of the United States government through the State Department, Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Department.&lt;ref name=JPMcSherry&gt;J. Patrice McSherry, [https://web.archive.org/web/20030316080744/http://larcdma.sdsu.edu/humanrights/rr/PLAarticles/mcsherry.html "Operation Condor: Clandestine Inter-American System"], ''Social Justice'', Winter 1999 v26 i4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States government has, at least since the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]], used the tactic of [[rendition (law)|legal rendition]] in which suspected terrorists were extradited to countries where they were to be prosecuted for crimes allegedly committed. In the "war on terror" this has evolved into [[extraordinary rendition]], the delivery of prisoners or others recently captured, including terrorism suspects, to foreign governments known to practice torture are Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, and Afghanistan. Human rights activists have alleged that the practice amounts to [[kidnapping]] for the purpose of torture, or torture by proxy. A related practice is the operation of facilities for imprisonment, and it is widely believed torture, in foreign countries. In November 2005, the [[Washington Post]] reported —-  citing administration sources —- that such facilities are operated by the [[CIA]] in Thailand (until 2004), Afghanistan, and several unnamed Eastern European countries.&lt;ref name=WPost2005&gt;Dana Priest, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/01/AR2005110101644_pf.html "CIA Holds Terror Suspects in Secret Prisons"], ''The Washington Post'', 2 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]] reports that planes associated with rendition have landed repeatedly in Poland and Romania.&lt;ref name=HumanRightsWatch&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/11/07/usint11995.htm "Statement on U.S. Secret Detention Facilities in Europe"], Human Rights Watch, 7 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent instances of torture in selected countries==
{{Expand list|date=August 2008}}
The use of torture is geographically widespread. A review by [[Amnesty International]], which did not use the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]] as its definition of torture, of its case files found "reports of torture or ill-treatment by state officials in more than 150 countries from 1997 to 2000". These reports described widespread or persistent patterns of abuse in more than 70 countries and torture-related deaths in more than 80.&lt;ref name=stoptorture&gt;[http://www.amnestyusa.org/stoptorture/about.html "Denounce Torture"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220234103/http://www.amnestyusa.org/stoptorture/about.html |date=20 February 2006 }}, Amnesty International.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Afghanistan===
{{see also|Bagram torture and prisoner abuse}}
Torture has been reported in Afghanistan under each of its recent governments.  Under Najibullah's Soviet-backed regime, beating and electric shocks were widely reported.&lt;ref name=WT1988&gt;Richard S. Ehrlich, [https://web.archive.org/web/20091027182744/http://www.geocities.com/asia_correspondent/afghan8804psychiatristwt.html "Psychiatric center treats victims of Afghanistan torture"], ''The Washington Times'', 11 April 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; After the mujahidin victory, Afghanistan fell into a state of chaos, and, according to Amnesty International, "Torture of civilians in their homes has become endemic ... In almost every jail run by the armed political groups, torture is reported to be a part of the daily routine".&lt;ref name="everyjail"&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/ailib/intcam/afgan/afgint.htm "International responsibility for a human rights disaster"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215123813/http://www.amnesty.org/ailib/intcam/afgan/afgint.htm |date=15 February 2009 }}, Amnesty International, November 1995. {{ISBN|0-86210-250-2}}&gt; AI Index: ASA/11/09/95.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Taliban]] are likewise reported to have engaged in torture.&lt;ref name=Telegraph2005&gt;Christina Lamb, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/1358063/I-was-one-of-the-Taliban's-torturers-I-crucified-people.html "I was one of the Taliban's torturers: I crucified people"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', London, 30 September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the U.S. overthrow of the Taliban, torture has been reported on several occasions, both by Afghan groups and by U.S. troops.  In the [[Herat]] region, dominated by the warlord [[Ismail Khan]], [[Human Rights Watch]] reported extensive torture in 2002.&lt;ref name=HRW2002&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/press/2002/11/herat1105.htm "Afghanistan: Torture and Political Repression in Herat"], Human Rights Watch, 5 November 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Torture by US troops has been alleged in news reports by the [[New York Times]].&lt;ref name=NYT2005_05_20&gt;Tim Golden, [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/20/international/asia/20abuse.html "In U.S. Report, Brutal Details of 2 Afghan Inmates' Deaths"], ''The New York Times'', 20 May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2008 the UK Ministry of Defence claimed that they and the Afghan army had uncovered a Taliban torture chamber where two individuals were believed to have been beaten.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/MilitaryOperations/ColdstreamGuardsFindTortureChamber.htm "Coldstream Guards Find torture Chamber"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311181512/http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/MilitaryOperations/ColdstreamGuardsFindTortureChamber.htm |date=11 March 2008 }}, Ministry of Defence, 11 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Albania===

Under [[Enver Hoxha|Enver Hoxha's]] [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania]], torture was widely used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/h/o.htm |title=Ho |publisher=[[Marxists Internet Archive]] |accessdate=11 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its fall, Amnesty International has reported [[police abuses]] amounting to torture;{{ref|AIUSA_Albania}} the government says it has "made efforts to punish all acts of torture under the Albanian criminal justice system".{{ref|OHCHR}}

===Algeria===

According to [[Pierre Vidal-Naquet]] in "Torture; Cancer of Democracy" and "Les Damnees de la Terre" by Franz Fanon, torture was practiced endemically by the French forces, commanded by General [[Jacques Massu]], bringing together the experience of "Les Paras" in the Indo-China War and German troops in the [[French Foreign Legion]].

===Angola===

In Angola's 27-year civil war, according to Amnesty International, "many were tortured" by both sides.&lt;ref name="E/CN.4/1994/31"&gt;[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/commission/torture94/cat-angola.htm "Report of the Special Rapporteur on torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment"], U.N.

{{Further information|Dirty War}}
During the so-called "[[Dirty War]]" carried out in the 1970s, in particular, but not only, by the [[National Reorganization Process|military dictatorship]] from 1976 to 1983, tens of thousands of Argentines were "[[forced disappearance|disappeared]]" by the junta, many never to be seen again. The [[CONADEP|National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons]] concluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In nearly all the cases brought to the attention of the Commission, the victims speak of acts of torture. Torture was an important element in the methodology of repression. Secret torture centres were set up, among other reasons, to enable the carrying out of torture to be carried out undisturbed.&lt;ref name=CONADEP&gt;{{cite web |publisher=National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons |url=http://www.nuncamas.org/english/library/nevagain/nevagain_001.htm |title=The ''Nunca Más'' (Never Again) CONADEP Report |year=1984 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060202021642/http://www.nuncamas.org/english/library/nevagain/nevagain_001.htm |archivedate=2006-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Torture was used regularly by the Brazilian dictatorship regime from 1964 to 1977 against dissidents. It included torturing their children, some of whom were less than 2 years old at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Torturado pela Ditadura Militar ainda bebê, filho de jornalista Dermi Azevedo morre em São Paulo|url=http://noticias.r7.com/brasil/torturado-pela-ditadura-militar-ainda-bebe-filho-de-jornalista-dermi-azevedo-morre-em-sao-paulo-18022013|website=R7 Noticias|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regime of [[Augusto Pinochet]] in Chile in the 1970s used torture extensively against political opponents. Chile's [[Valech Report|National Commission on Political Imprisonment and Torture]] (Comisión Nacional sobre Prisión Política y Tortura) concluded in 2004 that torture had been a systematically implemented policy of the government, and recommended reparations. The commission heard the testimony of more than 35,000 witnesses, whose testimonies are to be kept secret for fifty years.&lt;ref name=HRWChile&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/01/13/chile9846.htm |title=Chile: World Report, Human Rights Watch 2005 |publisher=Human Rights Watch }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/01/18/chile12205.htm "Chile"], ''Human Rights Watch World Report 2006''.&lt;/ref&gt; Among those tortured were future president [[Michelle Bachelet]], who was held along with her mother at the notorious [[Villa Grimaldi]] detention center in the capital [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]].

Although torture was outlawed in China in 1996, a UN investigator found torture to still be widespread in 2005, particularly because the narrow definition of the law, leaving a mark, does not comply with the UN definition.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Watts, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/dec/03/china.jonathanwatts "Torture still widespread in China, says UN investigator"], ''The Guardian'', London, 3 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

They are confined to narrow cells with no sunlight called "drawers" that have cement beds, a hole on the ground for their bodily needs, and are infested with a multitude of rodents, roaches, and other insects. These female prisoners lack all sort of necessary personal possessions and almost always have no water, even for bathing, often drinking this precious liquid full of insects. The food distributed to them is terrible, smells rotten, and is stored in receptacles lacking in hygiene. Even prison officials have complained of the small quantities served. In these "drawers" the women remain weeks and months.

===France===
{{Further information|Torture during the Algerian War|Human rights in France}}
During the [[Algerian War of Independence]] (1954–1962), the [[Military of France|French military]] used torture against the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] and the civilian population. The French interrogators were notorious for the use of man-powered [[electrical generator]]s on suspects: this form of torture was called ''(la) gégène''.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

That France has provided a pivotal role in the evolution of western torture practices is the central thesis of the French film ''Death Squadrons: The French School'' by [[Marie-Monique Robin|Monique Robin]].
The French had themselves developed practices in defence of its declining empire through the 20th century, setting up torture "universities" at ''Poulo Condor'' (now ''[[Côn Sơn Island|Côn Sơn]]'') – an island off Vietnam (then [[French Indo-China]], subsequently taken over by the United States) and at [[Skikda|Philippeville]] (now ''Skikda'') in Algeria.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

[[Police abuse]] remains a reality in France today, while France has been condemned by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) for the conditions of detention in prisons, including the use of torture on detainees.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Although the law and the Constitution prohibits any kind of torture, such practices happen. In 2004, the [[French police|Inspector General of the National Police]] received 469 registered complaints about illegitimate police violence during the first 11 months of the year, down from 500 during the same period in 2003. There were 59 confirmed cases of police violence, compared to 65 in the previous year. In April 2004, the ECHR condemned the government for "inhumane and degrading treatments" in the 1997 case of a teenager beaten while in police custody. The court ordered the government to pay Giovanni Rivas $20,500 (15,000 euros) in damages and $13,500 (10,000 euros) in court costs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2004/41681.htm "2004 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices in France"], US [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]].&lt;/ref&gt; The head of the police station in [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], near Paris, has been forced to resign after allegations of rape and other violence committed by the police force under his orders.

===Guatemala===

During the [[Guatemalan civil war]] and the repression by the army against civilians and suspected opponents of the military dictatorship, murder (even [[genocide]]), torture, rape and inhumane and degrading treatment was systematically used by the Guatemalan armed forces and police. There is evidence that the [[CIA]], in anticommunist campaigns during the 1980s, was involved in these tortures (in Latin America the threat of communism was often used as justification for dictatorship during the [[Cold War]]). Thousands of victims were tortured and murdered. For example, [[Dianna Ortiz]], an American nun who was teaching poor [[Maya peoples|Maya]]n children in the Guatemala highlands, claims that U.S. personnel were present in interrogation and torture rooms in [[Guatemala City]] in 1989 when she was kidnapped, taken to a secret prison and repeatedly raped and tortured by Guatemalan right-wing forces. Ortiz survived because of her American citizenship. Sister Ortiz chronicled her experiences and recovery in a book, ''The Blindfold's Eyes''.&lt;ref&gt;Dianna Ortiz and Patricia Davis, ''The Blindfold's eyes: My journey from torture to truth'', Maryknoll, New York, 2002. {{ISBN|1-57075-435-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; "There were other people in the clandestine cell, the clandestine prison, as well, and I could hear terrible screams. Many were killed. I saw some bodies. There were children, as well", wrote Dianna Ortiz.

===India===
India has not ratified the UN Convention against Torture. Custodial deaths and extrajudicial killings are on the rise. The [[Asian Centre for Human Rights]] released its report, Torture in India 2010, at a press conference in New Delhi. The report stated that, taking 2000 as the base year, custodial deaths have decreased by 41.66%&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100319192605/http://www.achrweb.org/impact/achr-impact2009.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; government between 2004–2005 to 2007–2008. This includes 70.72% increase of deaths in prison and 12.60% increase while in police custody.
The government has stated that it intends to pass the Anti Torture Act 2010 so it can ratify the UN convention against torture. The bill provides up to a 10-year sentence for physical or mental torture by the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Cabinet-clears-anti-torture-bill/articleshow/5776064.cms | work=The Times of India | title=Cabinet clears anti-torture bill | date=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arya Aramnejad]], a singer, was jailed for his song "Ali Barkhiz" where he denounces the Islamic regime's crimes during the [[2009 Ashura protests]].

In a study of torture in Iran published in 1999, Iranian-born political historian [[Ervand Abrahamian]] included Iran along with "[[Stalinism|Stalinist Russia]], [[History of the People's Republic of China (1949–1976)|Maoist China]], and early modern Europe" of the [[Inquisition]] and [[Witch-hunt#Early Modern Europe|witch hunts]], as societies that "can be considered to be in a league of their own" in the systematic use of torture.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, ''Tortured Confessions'' 1999, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

Torture techniques used in the Islamic Republic include:

&lt;blockquote&gt;whipping, sometimes of the back but most often of the feet with the body tied on an iron bed; the qapani; deprivation of sleep; suspension from ceiling and high walls; twisting of forearms until they broke; crushing of hands and fingers between metal presses; insertion of sharp instruments under the fingernails; cigarette burns; submersion under water; standing in one place for hours on end; mock executions; and physical threats against family members. Of these, the most prevalent was the whipping of soles, obviously because it was explicitly sanctioned by the sharia.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, ''Tortured Confessions'', 1999, p.139&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Chronicle of Higher Education]] International, reports that the widespread practice of [[rape|raping]] women imprisoned for engaging in political protest has been effective in keeping female college students "less outspoken and less likely to take part" in political demonstrations. The journal quotes an Iranian college student as saying, "most of the girls arrested are raped in jail. Families can't cope with that."&lt;ref&gt;1 August 2008,  "Among Scholars, Resistance and Resilience in Iran, Tradition of dissent survives despite government pressure" By AISHA LABI, ''Chronicle of Higher Education International''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iraq===

The government headed by [[Baath Party|Baathist]] [[Saddam Hussein]] made extensive use of torture, including at the notorious [[Abu Ghraib prison]].

The post-[[2003 Invasion of Iraq|invasion]] [[Iraqi Interim Government|Iraqi government]] holds thousands of people in prison. After investigating from July to October 2004, [[Human Rights Watch]] found that torture was "routine and commonplace." According to their report,

{{Quotation|Methods of torture or ill-treatment cited included routine beatings to the body using a variety of implements such as cables, hosepipes and metal rods.  Detainees reported kicking, slapping and punching; prolonged suspension from the wrists with the hands tied behind the back; electric shocks to sensitive parts of the body, including the earlobes and genitals; and being kept blindfolded and/or handcuffed continuously for several days.

Despite apparently credible claims that people were fed into [[Saddam Hussein's alleged shredder|Saddam Hussein's plastic shredder]] (most likely within Abu Ghraib) prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, no such device was found after the war. In October 1990, it was alleged that Iraqi soldiers had "thrown babies from incubators" during the invasion of Kuwait. This story was supposed to have come from the 'eye-witness testimony' of a 15-year-old Kuwaiti girl, [[Nurse Nayirah]]. Years later it emerged that she was the daughter of [[Saud bin Nasir Al-Sabah]], Kuwait's ambassador to the United States, and that the story was the creation of the [[Hill &amp; Knowlton]] public relations firm employed by the Kuwaitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Stauber, J., Rampton, S.}} (1995) ''Toxic Sludge Is Good for You ''.

===Israel===

After investigation of continued allegations of torture, the Supreme Court ruled in 1999&lt;ref name=SCR&gt;[http://elyon1.court.gov.il/files_eng/94/000/051/A09/94051000.a09.htm Supreme Court ruling], (HCJ 5100/94)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://takdin.co.il/searchg/HCJ%20510094%20Public%20Committee%20Against%20Torture%20v.%20State_hd_0L34rDp8qN3KnC30kQ7Hj.html ''Public Committee Against Torture v. State of Israel''], 15 July 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; that all torture - even moderate physical pressure - was illegal. This decision was praised by human-rights organizations. Despite this reform of the law, [[Amnesty International]] continues to express concerns to Israel about treatment which amounts to torture, and remains unhappy about the steps taken by Israel to eliminate torture. [[Amnesty International]]  stated in 2002:

{{Quotation|...the Israeli HCJ in September 1999 banned a number of interrogation methods ...However the judgment left ... loopholes by which methods amounting to torture or other ill-treatment in detention may continue.|Amnesty International|3=&lt;ref name=AI_Israel&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde15/074/2002/en/ "Israel and the Occupied Territories: Mass detention in cruel, inhuman and degrading conditions"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Amnesty International Index: MDE 15/074/2002, 23 May 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The human rights group [[B'Tselem]] estimated that 85% of all Palestinian detainees suspected of terrorism are subject to prolonged [[sleep deprivation]]; prolonged sight deprivation or [[sensory deprivation]]; forced, prolonged maintenance of body positions that grow increasingly painful; confinement in tiny, closet-like spaces; exposure to temperature extremes, such as in deliberately overcooled rooms; prolonged toilet and hygiene deprivation; and degrading treatment, such as forcing detainees to eat and use the toilet at the same time. Allegations have been made of frequent beatings. Such acts violate Article 16 of the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]].  In January 2000, B'Tselem claimed that the Israeli [[Shin Bet|General Security Service]]'s (GSS) methods of interrogation amounted to the [[five techniques]]: "[The] GSS used methods comparable to those used by the British in 1971, viz. sleep deprivation, infliction of physical suffering, and sensory isolation. But the GSS used them for much longer periods, so the resulting pain and suffering were substantially greater. In addition, the GSS used direct violence... Thus,... in practice, the GSS methods were substantially more severe than those used by the British in 1971..."&lt;ref name=BTselem2000&gt;B'Tselem, ''Legislation allowing for the use of physical force'', January 2000, pp.32,48.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kenya===

[[Mau Mau]] inflicted torture and death on 1,819 [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] during their uprising in the 1950s, along with 58 people of European and Asian descent.

===Lebanon===
Suspected [[Hezbollah]] guerrillas, their families and Lebanese civilian internees were previously detained in the [[South Lebanon Army]] (SLA) prison at [[Khiam]] in the then Israeli-occupied Southern Lebanon. Torture, including electric shock torture, by the SLA was routine. This was detailed after the end of the occupation in 2000, when Lebanese who freed the prisoners found instruments of torture.&lt;ref name=HRW_Israel&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/reports/1994/israel/ "Torture and ill-treatment: Israel's Interrogation of Palestinians from the Occupied Territories"], Human Rights Watch, June 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=unhchr_Israel&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/0/daf82ddcda36946e80256609004b7df9?OpenDocument "Concluding observations of the Committee against Torture: Israel. 18/05/98"] by [[UNHCR]] Committee Against Torture, Twentieth session, 4–22 May 1998, A/53/44, paras.232–242.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nigeria===

In 2005, Human Rights Watch documented that Nigerian police in the cities of [[Enugu]], [[Lagos]] and [[Kano]] routinely practice torture. Dozens of witnesses and survivors stepped forward to testify to repeated, severe beatings, abuse of sexual organs, rape, death threats, injury by shooting, and the denial of food and water. These abuses were used in campaigns against common crime.&lt;ref name=HRWNigeria2005&gt;[http://hrw.org/reports/2005/nigeria0705/ "Rest in Pieces: Police Torture and Deaths in Custody in Nigeria"], Human Rights Watch, July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Systematic torture was used in conjunction with military occupation in an attempt to quell anti-[[petroleum|oil]] protests by the [[Ogoni people]] in the [[Niger Delta]], according to a [[World Council of Churches]] report.&lt;ref name=WCC1997&gt;Deborah Robinson, [http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Urgent_Action/dc_4897.html "Ogoni: The Struggle Continues"], World Council of Churches.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian pastors in Nigeria have been involved in the torturing and killing of children accused of witchcraft.

===North Vietnam===
From 1961 to 1973, the North Vietnamese and Vietcong held hundreds of Americans captive. Hanoi's Ministry of Public Security's Medical Office (MPSMO) was responsible for "preparing studies and performing research on the most effective Soviet, French, Communist Chinese and other ...techniques..." of extracting information from POWs. The MPSMO "...supervised the use of torture and the use of drugs to induce [American] prisoners to cooperate." Its functions also "...included working with Soviet and Communist Chinese intelligence advisors who were qualified in the use of medical techniques for intelligence purposes."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiu.edu/~fcf/warcrimes.cuba.vietnam.html "War Crimes: The Cuban-Vietnam Connection"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718102449/http://www.fiu.edu/~fcf/warcrimes.cuba.vietnam.html |date=18 July 2008 }}, National Alliance of Families.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Palestinian Territories===
The [[Palestinian Authority]] has reportedly practiced torture in the occupied territories over the years. Amnesty International found: "Torture [by the Palestine Authority] of [[detainee]]s remained widespread. Seven detainees died in custody. Unlawful killings, including possible extrajudicial executions, continued to be reported."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Recent publications Highlighted research |url=https://www.amnesty.org/ailib/aireport/ar98/mde21.htm |title=Library |publisher=Amnesty International |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208141705/http://www.amnesty.org/ailib/aireport/ar98/mde21.htm |archivedate=8 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 100 cases of torture by Palestinian security services were reported in 2010. Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, said: "The reports of torture by Palestinian security services keep rolling in. President Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad are well aware of the situation. They need to reverse this rampant impunity and make sure that those responsible are prosecuted."&lt;ref&gt;"West Bank: Reports of Torture in Palestinian Detention." UNHCR. 20 October 2010.

At least six Palestinians have died under torture in PA prisons. According to a report by the Arab Organization for Human Rights in Britain, the PA has used torture on a systematic basis for years. Methods include beatings with cables, pulling out nails, suspension from the ceiling, flogging, kicking, cursing, electric shocks, sexual harassment and the threat of rape. The report went on to say "Every one of those detainees has been subject to humiliating and degrading treatment and stayed in cells for more than 10 days. The analysis shows that an astonishing 95 percent of the detainees were subjected to severe torture, others feeling the detrimental effects on their health for varying periods."&lt;ref&gt;Abu Toameh, Khaled.

Human Rights Watch reported 147 cases of torture by Hamas in the West Bank during 2011 and that none of the perpetrators had been prosecuted "despite consistent allegations of severe abuse." It further stated that "Some men said they had needed medical care due to torture and sought to obtain medical records as evidence that they had been tortured, but that hospital officials refused to provide them. Hamas’s rival in the West Bank, the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority, arrests and detains Palestinians arbitrarily, including Hamas members or sympathizers, and similarly subjects detainees to torture and abuse."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/10/03/gaza-arbitrary-arrests-torture-unfair-trials Gaza: Arbitrary Arrests, Torture, Unfair Trials]. 3 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In another report, Human Rights Watch "documents cases in which [Palestinian] security forces tortured, beat, and arbitrarily detained journalists, confiscated their equipment, and barred them from leaving the West Bank and Gaza." HRW also reported an incident in which "the Hamas Ministry of Interior summoned a journalist who published an article on torture by Hamas authorities in secret detention facilities, threatened to take legal action against him if he did not publish an apology for the article, and warned him to correct his 'biased' reporting."&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch (6 April 2011).

Torture and humiliation, or ''[[dedovshchina]]'', are also widespread in Russian's military, according to Human Rights Watch.&lt;ref name="dedov"&gt;[http://hrw.org/reports/2004/russia1004/6.htm "The Consequences of Dedovshchina"], Human Rights Watch, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; This is essentially the Russian version of [[bullying]] or [[hazing]] that is practiced in the American military, however it is often much more brutal.

In the most extreme cases, hundreds of innocent people from the street were arbitrarily arrested, beaten, tortured, and raped by special police forces ("Red Terror").

===Saudi Arabia===

Saudi Arabia officially considers torture illegal under [[Islamic Law]]; however, it is widely practiced, as in the case of [[William Sampson (author)|William Sampson]]. According to a 2003 report by Amnesty International, "torture and ill-treatment remained rife."&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.amnesty.org/report2003/sau-summary-eng "AI Report 2003: Saudi Arabia"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060501215008/http://web.amnesty.org/report2003/sau-summary-eng |date=1 May 2006 }}, Amnesty International, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Hanny Megally, Executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch, stated in 2002 "The practice of torture in Saudi Arabia is well documented",&lt;ref&gt;

===Soviet Union===

Torture was widely practiced by the brutal [[NKVD|Soviet secret police]] during the [[Stalinism]] era to extract (often false) confessions from suspects often called [[enemy of the people|enemies of the people]]. One of the most prevalent and effective types of torture was [[sleep deprivation]], nicknamed "conveyor" due to interrogators replacing one another to keep the inmate from sleeping.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Solzhenitsyn. "The Gulag Archipelago"&lt;/ref&gt; The use of torture was authorized by the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee of the Communist Party]] and personally by [[Joseph Stalin]]. During the [[Doctor's Plot]], Stalin ordered falsely accused physicians to be tortured "to death".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novayagazeta.ru/data/2008/gulag09/00.html "Stalin's torture: 'Beat them to death'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020110400/http://www.novayagazeta.ru/data/2008/gulag09/00.html |date=20 October 2008 }}, ''Novaya Gazeta'', Moscow, 16 October 2008. {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Torture was still used after Stalin by the [[KGB]] but not on the same extent and level.

===Spain===
The Spanish kingdom categorically denies the existence of torture.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, [http://web.amnesty.org/report2004/esp-summary-eng ''AI Report 2004''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050218023703/http://web.amnesty.org/report2004/esp-summary-eng |date=18 February 2005 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Spanish authorities consistently fail to implement recommendations by the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture and the UN Committee Against Torture to combat the use of torture in detention. The UN committee expressed its concern "about the length of judicial procedures and made reference to reports that indicated that five years had sometimes passed between crime and sentence. The Committee warned that this problem reduces the effect of penal action and discourages people to file complaints." It further indicated that "all members of the Committee were also deeply concerned about the legal practice of five days incommunicado detention" (since October 2003, a reform of the Criminal Procedure Code has extended that period to a maximum of 13 days).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ishr.ch/About%20UN/Reports%20and%20Analysis/CAT/CAT-29thSession.htm#_ftnref4 |title=Fourth periodic report on Spain in the 29th session of the UN Committee Against Torture |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050301143523/http://www.ishr.ch/About%20UN/Reports%20and%20Analysis/CAT/CAT-29thSession.htm |archivedate=2005-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Committee for the Prevention of Torture, [http://cpt.coe.int/en/states/esp.htm "Spain"], Council of Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009 a video emerged of a United Arab Emirates Royal [[Sheikh|Sheik]], Sheik [[Issa bin Zayed Al Nahyan]] (a son of [[Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan]]) directing the torture of an Afghan grain dealer Mohammed Shah Poor The video includes the man being tortured with a cattle prod to his genitals, sand in his mouth and being run over by a [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] [[SUV]]. A man in a UAE police uniform is seen on the tape tying the victim's arms and legs, and later holding him down. The official response of the UAE government was that Sheik Issa is the man shown in the video but he did nothing wrong. The incidents depicted in the videotapes were not part of a pattern of behaviour, the Ministry of the Interior said.&lt;ref&gt;[http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/posted/archive/2009/04/23/267703.aspx ABC revealed torture movie]{{dead link|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=7402099&amp;page=1 |title=ABC News Exclusive: Torture Tape Implicates UAE Royal Sheikh |publisher=ABC News |date=22 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kenya====
During the [[Mau Mau uprising]] of the 1950s, British colonial forces rounded up more than a million of [[Kikuyu people]] — most of them innocent victims of [[collective punishment]] — and imprisoned them in [[concentration camps]] in order to flush out the Mau Mau insurgency. In order to extract information about the insurgency and terrorize the enemy, the British used brutal methods to force Kenyans to confess and repudiate the Mau Mau oath. Under slogans like "labor and freedom" and other variations on "[[Arbeit macht frei]]," inmates were worked to death as slave labor filling in mass graves under cruel conditions. Some men were anally raped with knives. Some women had their breasts mutilated and cut off. Eyes were gouged out and ears cut off and skin lacerated with coiled barbed wire. Interrogation involved stuffing a detainee’s mouth with mud and stamping on his throat until he passed out or died. Survivors were sometimes burned alive, while British guards and interrogators took joy and laughed. British troops denying access to medical aid to the detainees were widespread. A former British officer described a British detention camp in Kenya in 1954: "Short rations, overwork, brutality, humiliating and disgusting treatment, flogging — all in violation of the [[UN Declaration of Human Rights]]." According to Canon Bewes, a British missionary, there was a "constant stream of reports of brutalities by police, military and home guards. Some of the people had been using castration instruments and two men had died under castration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Britain's gulag: the brutal end of empire in Kenya |pages=124–145 |publisher=Pimlico |author=Caroline Elkins |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Histories of the Hanged: The Dirty War in Kenya and the End of Empire |pages=150–154 |publisher=W.

Among the detainees who suffered severe mistreatment was [[Hussein Onyango Obama]], the grandfather of [[U.S. President]] [[Barack Obama]]. According to his widow, British soldiers forced pins into his fingernails and buttocks and squeezed his testicles between metal rods and two others were castrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/05/kenyan-mau-mau-payout-uk-regret-abuse |title= Kenya: UK expresses regret over abuse as Mau Mau promised payout |date=5 June 2013 |work=The Guardian |location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; One British settler described the typical British interrogation:

{{Quotation|We knew the slow method of torture [at the Mau Mau Investigation Center] was worse than anything we could do. Special Branch there had a way of slowly electrocuting a Kuke—they'd rough up one for days. Once I went personally to drop off one gang member who needed special treatment. I stayed for a few hours to help the boys out, softening him up. Things got a little out of hand. By the time I cut his balls off, he had no ears, and his eyeball, the right one, I think, was hanging out of its socket. Too bad, he died before we got much out of him.}}

On 22 November 1954, Colonel Arthur Young sent a letter to [[List of colonial governors of Kenya|Governor]] [[Evelyn Baring, 1st Baron Howick of Glendale|Evelyn Baring]] about the "inhumanity" of various parts of the security forces amid his investigations of wrongdoing:

{{quotation|The other lamentable aspect of this case [i.e. Judgment of the East Africa Court of Appeal, Criminal Appeals 891 and 892 of 1954] is the horror of some of the so called Screening Camps which, in my judgment, now present a state of affairs so deplorable that they should be investigated without delay so that the ever increasing allegations of inhumanity and disregard of the rights of the African citizen are dealt with and so that Government will have no reason either to be embarrassed or ashamed of the acts which are done in its name by its own servants. As things are at present there is no one who can investigate such allegations and no independent authority who is responsible for the conduct at these camps. An African who is unfortunate enough to suffer from the brutalities which are clearly evident has no one to whom he can complain and no one to regard his interests since the local Administrative Officer is, himself, the authority for the camps. Moreover, the injured person is unlikely to appeal to the police for redress if they are to be regarded as subordinate to the Executive...I do not consider that in the present circumstances Government have taken all the necessary steps to ensure that in its Screening Camps the elementary principles of justice and humanity are observed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leighday.co.uk/LeighDay/media/LeighDay/documents/Mau%20Mau/Historian%20witness%20statements/Prof-Elkins-3rd-Statement--Exhibit-CE1-.pdf?ext=.pdf rof-Elkins-3rd-Statement--Exhibit]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In January 1955, Baring sent a telegram to [[Alan Lennox-Boyd, 1st Viscount Boyd of Merton|Alan Lennox-Boyd]], the Secretary of State for the Colonies and a cabinet minister, and told them that eight white European officers who had been accused of serious crimes, including accessory to murder, would be given immunity from prosecution. One district officer was accused of the "beating up and roasting alive of one African". A Kenyan Regiment Sergeant and a field intelligence assistance had been implicated in the burning of two further suspects "during screening operations". "I had not myself realised until today that the extension of the principle of clemency to all members of the security forces involved so many cases with Europeans as principals," wrote Baring.&lt;ref name="MAU MAU"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13044974 |title= British Mau Mau abuse papers revealed|date=12 April 2011  |author=Dominic Casciani |work=BBC |location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, Baring's administration devised the "dilution technique" — a system of assaults and psychological shocks to detainees, to force the compliance of the toughest Mau Mau supporters. Lennox-Boyd was told that one commander, Terrence Gavaghan, had developed the techniques at the Mwea camps in central Kenya - and he needed permission to treat the worst detainees in a "rough way". Baring telegrammed the Colonial Secretary in London asking for his approval to use "overpowering" force, and the cabinet minister's approval came within weeks. A ministerial delegation saw firsthand prisoners beaten for refusing to don camp clothes. Ringleaders of the "Mau Mau moan" - a chant of defiance - were singled out for special punishment. They were beaten and forced to the ground. Once there, a boot was placed on their throat while mud was forced into their mouths. Gavaghan also explained how difficult detainees would be subjected to the "third degree". "The measures adopted were to be kept awake all night, having water thrown at him and to be beaten up on a variety of pretexts."&lt;ref name="MAU MAU"/&gt;

One Hanslope Park document is a letter between Kenyan Special Branch police officers about treatment of "fanatical" detainees at the Mwea camps.

{{quotation|If they deny having taken an oath they are given summary punishment which usually consists of a good beating up. This treatment usually breaks a large proportion. If this treatment does not bear fruit the detainee is taken to the far end of the camp where buckets of stone are waiting. These buckets are placed on the detainee's head and he is made to run around in circles until he agrees to confess the oath.&lt;ref name="MAU MAU"/&gt;}}

In June 1957, Eric Griffith-Jones, the attorney general of the British administration in Kenya, wrote to Baring, detailing the way the regime of abuse at the colony's detention camps was being subtly altered. He said that the mistreatment of the detainees is "distressingly reminiscent of conditions in [[Nazi Germany]] or [[Soviet Union|Communist Russia]]". Despite this, he said that in order for abuse to remain legal, Mau Mau suspects must be beaten mainly on their upper body, "vulnerable parts of the body should not be struck, particularly the spleen, liver or kidneys", and it was important that "those who administer violence ... should remain collected, balanced and dispassionate". He also agreed to draft legislation that sanctioned beatings, as long as the abuse was kept secret, and reminded the governor that "If we are going to sin," he wrote, "we must sin quietly."&lt;ref name="MAU"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/05/kenyan-mau-mau-payout-uk-regret-abuse |title=Kenya: UK expresses regret over abuse as Mau Mau promised payout |date=5 June 2013 |publisher=guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/05/kenyan-mau-mau-payout-uk-regret-abuse |title=Sins of colonialists lay concealed for decades in secret archive |date=18 April 2012 |publisher=Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Northern Ireland====
During [[the Troubles]], members of the British Army and the British security forces had routinely used torture on [[List of organisations known as the Irish Republican Army|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) suspects in [[Northern Ireland]], a part of the United Kingdom.

In 1971, as part of [[Operation Demetrius]], fourteen arrested men were subjected to a program of "deep interrogation" at [[Shackleton Barracks|a secret interrogation centre]]. The interrogation methods involved [[sensory deprivation]] and were referred to as the "[[five techniques]]". The [[European Court of Human Rights]] defined them as ''wall-standing, hooding, subjection to noise, deprivation of sleep, and deprivation of food and drink''. For seven days, when not being interrogated, the detainees were kept [[hooding|hooded]] and handcuffed in a cold cell and subjected to a continuous loud hissing noise. Here they were forced to stand in a [[stress position]] for many hours and were deprived of sleep, food and drink. They were also repeatedly beaten, and some reported being kicked in the genitals, having their heads banged against walls and being threatened with injections. The effect was severe pain, severe physical and mental exhaustion, severe anxiety, depression, hallucinations, disorientation and repeated loss of consciousness.&lt;ref name=mcguffin4&gt;[http://www.irishresistancebooks.com/guineapigs/guineapigs.htm ''The Guineapigs''] by John McGuffin (1974, 1981). [http://www.irishresistancebooks.com/guineapigs/guinea4.htm Chapter 4: The Experiment].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mcguffin6&gt;[http://www.irishresistancebooks.com/guineapigs/guineapigs.htm ''The Guineapigs''] by John McGuffin (1974, 1981). [http://www.irishresistancebooks.com/guineapigs/guinea6.htm Chapter 6: Replay].&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourteen so-called "Hooded Men" were the only detainees subjected to all five techniques together. Some other detainees were subjected to at least one of the five techniques, along with other interrogation methods.&lt;ref name=mcguffin9&gt;[http://www.irishresistancebooks.com/guineapigs/guineapigs.htm ''The Guineapigs''] by John McGuffin (1974, 1981). [http://www.irishresistancebooks.com/guineapigs/guinea9.htm Chapter 9: Down on the Killing Floor].&lt;/ref&gt; These allegedly included [[waterboarding]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/northernireland/6862034/Prisoners-in-Northern-Ireland-subjected-to-waterboarding-by-British-army-officers.html "Prisoners in Northern Ireland 'subjected to waterboarding by British army officers'"]. ''The Telegraph''. 22 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Electric shock#Torture|electric shocks]], burning with matches and candles, forcing internees to stand over hot electric fires while beating them, beating and squeezing of the genitals, inserting objects into the anus, injections, [[Foot whipping|whipping the soles of the feet]], and psychological abuse such as [[Russian roulette]].&lt;ref name=mcguffin9/&gt;

Details of the "deep interrogation" program became known to the public, sparking outrage. In response, the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British Government]] commissioned an inquiry, under [[Hubert Parker, Baron Parker of Waddington|Lord Parker]], to look into the five techniques. In 1972 the 'Parker Report' concluded that the five techniques were illegal under domestic law. British Prime Minister, [[Edward Heath]], then announced that the five techniques would no longer be used under his government. However, he said that if a future British government decided to reintroduce them, it would need to be approved by Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Tobias. ''This Side of Silence: Human Rights, Torture, and the Recognition of Cruelty''. University of Pennsylvania Press, 2011. pp.34-35&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Government of Ireland|Irish Government]] had begun international legal action against the British Government over the Hooded Men in 1971. In 1976, the [[European Commission of Human Rights]] ruled that the program of deep interrogation, using the five techniques, amounted to "torture".&lt;ref name=bbcnov14&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-30177715 "Amnesty calls on Irish government to reopen 'hooded men' case"]. BBC News. 24 November 2014. Retrieved 12 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The case was then referred to the [[European Court of Human Rights]]. In 1978 it ruled that the program amounted to "inhuman and degrading treatment" which breached the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], but did not amount to torture.&lt;ref name=bbcnov14/&gt; In 2014, evidence emerged that the British Government had withheld information from the Court. Following these revelations, the Irish Government announced in December 2014 that it would be asking the Court to review its judgement and acknowledge the five techniques as torture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/2014/1202/664159-hooded-men/ "State to apply to have 'Hooded Men' judgment revised by ECHR"] (RTÉ News);[http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/government-asks-european-court-to-revise-hooded-men-ruling-1.2022790 "Government asks European court to revise 'Hooded Men' ruling"] (Irish Times); [https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-30296397 "Hooded Men: Irish government bid to reopen 'torture' case"] (BBC News). Retrieved 12 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court's ruling, that the five techniques did not amount to torture, was later cited by the United States and Israel to justify their own interrogation methods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caj.org.uk/contents/1264 "The Hooded Men - joint press release from CAJ and the Pat Finucane Centre"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322042506/http://www.caj.org.uk/contents/1264 |date=22 March 2016 }}.

On 23 February 2005, British soldiers were found guilty of abuse of Iraqi prisoners arrested for looting at a [[British Army]] camp called Bread Basket, in [[Basra]], during May 2003. The judge at the military court, Judge Advocate Michael Hunter, said of photographs and the soldier's behaviour:

{{Quotation|Anyone with a shred of human decency would be revolted by what is contained in those pictures. The actions of you and those responsible for these acts have undoubtedly tarnished the international reputation of the British Army and, to some extent, the British nation too, and it will no doubt hamper the efforts of those who are now risking their lives striving to achieve stability in the Gulf region, and it will probably be used by those who are working against such ends.|Judge Advocate Michael Hunter|}}

On 7 December 2005, the House of Lords reversed the deportations of Muslims convicted on "evidence procured by torture inflicted by foreign officials", and cited the 1978 case in ruling that centuries of common law and recent international conventions made torture anathema in the country's courts. Lord Bingham said it was "clear that from its very earliest days the common law of England set its face firmly against the use of torture"; Lord Nicholls said "Torture is not acceptable. This is a bedrock moral principle in this country"; Lord Hoffman said "The use of torture is dishonourable. It corrupts and degrades the state which uses it and the legal system which accepts it."; Lord Hope said it was "one of most evil practices known to man"; Lord Rodgers said "the unacceptable nature of torture ... has long been unquestioned in this country."; Lord Carswell referred to the "abhorrence felt by civilised nations for the use of torture"; and Lord Brown said that "torture is an unqualified evil.

Rumsfeld]], and creating a parallel legal system below international standards.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, [https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/AMR51/155/2006/en "Rubber stamping violations in the 'war on terror': Congress fails human rights"], 27 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Scheinin, [http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/13A2242628618D12C12572140030A8D9?opendocument "UN expert on human rights and counterterrorism concerned that Military Commissions Act is now law in United States"], UN High Commission for Human Rights, 27 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Waldron, [http://www.vanderbilt.edu/alumni/email/InBrief/2006Spring/charney_lecture_06.html "The Rule against Torture as a Legal Archetype"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906050258/http://www.vanderbilt.edu/alumni/email/InBrief/2006Spring/charney_lecture_06.html |date=6 September 2006 }}, Charney Lecture, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with the ''Washington Post'', the [[convening authority]] of the [[Guantanamo military commissions]], [[Susan J. Crawford]], a retired judge, who was responsible for reviewing practices at the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]], said of one Guantanamo Bay detainee, "his treatment met the legal definition of torture, and that is why I did not refer the case" for prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/13/AR2009011303372.html?hpid=topnews "Detainee Tortured, Says U.S. Official"], ''The Washington Post'', 13 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Government denies that torture is being conducted in the detention camps at [[Guantanamo Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/press/2001/11/TortureQandA.htm Human Rights Watch], 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dana Priest and Barton Gellman, "U.S. Decries Abuse but Defends Interrogations", ''The Washington Post'', 26 December 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported in June 2008 that, according to human rights lawyers, the USA was "operating floating prisons to house those arrested in its war on terror":

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"According to research carried out by Reprieve, the US may have used as many as 17 ships as 'floating prisons' since 2001. Detainees are interrogated aboard the vessels and then rendered to other, often undisclosed, locations, it is claimed. Ships that are understood to have held prisoners include the [[USS Bataan (LHD-5)|USS Bataan]] and [[USS Peleliu (LHA-5)|USS Peleliu]]. A further 15 ships are suspected of having operated around the British territory of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, which has been used as a military base by the UK and the Americans.
&lt;br /&gt;
... The Reprieve study includes the account of a prisoner released from Guantánamo Bay, who described a fellow inmate's story of detention on an amphibious assault ship. 'One of my fellow prisoners in Guantánamo was at sea on an American ship with about 50 others before coming to Guantánamo ... he was in the cage next to me. He told me that there were about 50 other people on the ship. They were all closed off in the bottom of the ship. The prisoner commented to me that it was like something you see on TV. The people held on the ship were beaten even more severely than in Guantánamo.'"&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Campbell and Richard Norton-Taylor, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/02/usa.humanrights "US accused of holding terror suspects on prison ships"], ''The Guardian'', London, 2 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Uzbekistan===

After an investigating visit to Uzbekistan, [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]] on Torture  [[Theo van Boven]] concluded:&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/pub/2005/Uzbekistan_Special_Rapporteur_Report_Feb03.pdf Report of the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture], UN Commission on Human Rights, February 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|Even though only a small number of torture cases can be proved with absolute certainty, the copious testimonies gathered ... are so consistent in their description of torture techniques and the places and circumstances in which torture is perpetrated that the pervasive and persistent nature of torture throughout the investigative process cannot be denied.|Theo van Boven|}}

Forms of torture frequently cited include immersion in boiling water, exposure to extreme heat and cold, "the use of electric shock, temporary suffocation, hanging by the ankles or wrists, removal of fingernails, punctures with sharp objects, rape, the threat of rape, and the threat of murder of family members."&lt;ref name=HRWUzbek2001&gt;Human Rights Watch, [https://www.hrw.org/wr2k1/europe/uzbekistan.html Uzbekistan, World Report 2001].&lt;/ref&gt; (For example, see [[Muzafar Avazov]].)

In 2003, Britain's Ambassador for Uzbekistan, Craig Murray, said that information was being extracted under extreme torture from dissidents in that country, and that the information was subsequently being used by Britain and other western, democratic countries which disapproved of torture.&lt;ref name=Telegraph_23Oct2004&gt;Robin Gedye, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/4194001/The-envoy-silenced-after-telling-undiplomatic-truths.html "The envoy silenced after telling undiplomatic truths"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', London, 23 October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Whegs''' (''wheel-legs or wing-legs'') are mechanisms for [[robot]] locomotion.  Whegs use a strategy of locomotion that combines the simplicity of the [[wheel]] with the obstacle-clearing advantages of the foot.

Whegs were pioneered at the Biologically Inspired Robotics Laboratory at [[Case Western Reserve University]]. Whegs development and improvements based on [[cockroach]] climbing behavior in several robots has been done in collaboration with the Ritzmann lab in the Biology department at [[Case Western Reserve University]] on cockroach climbing behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biorobots.case.edu/projects/whegs/whegs-i/|title=Whegs™ I {{!}} Biologically Inspired Robotics|website=biorobots.case.edu|access-date=2016-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Whegs robots were inspired by the Prolero robot, designed in 1996 at [[European Space Agency|the European Space Agency]], and the [[rhex|RHex]] robot, developed by a multiuniversity effort funded by the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://biorobots.cwru.edu/projects/whegs/ Whegs Series Robots]&lt;/ref&gt;  The mobility system is based on studies on the locomotion of the cockroach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper | title = Comparing Cockroach and Whegs Robot Body Motions | citeseerx = 10.1.1.84.5410 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/288/5463/80.summary|last=Taubes|first=Gary|year=2000|title=Biologists and Engineers Create a New Generation of Robots That Imitate Life|journal=Science|volume=288|issue=5463|pages=80–83|doi=10.1126/science.288.5463.80|accessdate=November 2011}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wing-legs are found on flying robots and are [[Wing|wings]] dual-purposed as legs for locomotion when the robot is on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Laboratory of Intelligent Systems [http://lis.epfl.ch/DALER DALER project]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Religious text primary|date=October 2011}}
According to the [[Book of Mormon]], '''Zenock''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|iː|n|ə|k}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/pronunciation?lang=eng LDS.org: "Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide"] (retrieved 2012-02-25), [[Wikipedia:IPA for English|IPA]]-ified from «zē´nuk»&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[old world]] [[prophet]] whose pre-Christian era writings were recorded upon the [[plates of brass]]. Zenock is quoted or paraphrased a number of times by writers in the Book of Mormon, including [[Nephi, son of Lehi|Nephi]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/1_ne/19/10,12,16#10 1 Nephi 19:10, 12, 16].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alma, son of Alma]],&lt;ref name= "alma"&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/alma/33/15-17#15 Alma 33:15-17].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amulek]],&lt;ref name="scriptures.lds.org"&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/alma/34/7#7 Alma 34:7].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nephi, son of Helaman]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/hel/8/20#20 Helaman 8:20].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mormon (prophet)|Mormon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/3_ne/10/16#16 3 Nephi 10:6].&lt;/ref&gt;

Zenock is reported to have written and prophesied about the divinity, death, and [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] of the coming [[Messiah]]. In the Book of Alma (chapter 33 verse 17), Alma the Younger reports that Zenock was [[Stoning|stoned]] to death for preaching that the Messiah would be the "Son of God."&lt;ref name="scriptures.lds.org"/&gt;

Research on early manuscripts of the Book of Mormon suggests the name's intended spelling was "Zenoch" rather than "Zenock."&lt;ref name=Skousen&gt;{{citation |url= http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/publications/jbms/?vol=7&amp;num=1&amp;id=167 |last= Skousen |first= Royal |title= How Joseph Smith Translated the Book of Mormon: Evidence from the Original Manuscript |journal= [[Journal of Book of Mormon Studies]] |volume= 7 |issue= 1 |pages= 22–31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of the Book of Mormon, there is no evidence that Zenock existed. However, there is evidence that writings of, and references to several ancient Israelite prophets were destroyed by the ruling class of the ancient Jews. There is a reference in the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] to an ancient prophet known as the [[Teacher of Righteousness]] who was driven out of Jewish society because he preached of the coming of a Messiah. Outside of the Dead Sea Scrolls, there is no other reference to this person, and until 1950, there was absolutely no record of his existence. The scrolls state that the Teacher of Righteousness was descended from another mysterious prophet named [[Zadok]], which might have been a transcribed or altered version of the Book of Mormon name Zenock.&lt;ref name=Nibley&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url= http://publications.maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/fullscreen/?pub=1101&amp;index=13 |chapter= Chapter 10: The Dead Sea Scrolls: Some Questions and Answers |first= Hugh |last= Nibley |authorlink= Hugh Nibley |year= 1986 |editor1-first= John W. |editor1-last= Welch |editor1-link= John W.

==Etymology==
It is possible that the name Zenock (or Zenoch) is derived from the Hebrew word זָנַח (zanach - Strong's H2186), meaning to push aside, reject or forsake.{{cn|date=October 2017}} In fact, the name Zenock may be a pun. After citing Zenock's words concerning the "Son of God," Alma wrote that "because the people would not understand his words they stoned him to death"&lt;ref name= "alma"/&gt;, a most effective way of pushing aside, rejecting, or forsaking him.
