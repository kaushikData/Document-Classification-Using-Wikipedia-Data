      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4160">A '''bias incident''' or '''hate incident''' is an act of hostility motivated by racism, religious intolerance, or other prejudice. A bias incident is different from a [[hate crime]] in that it does not necessarily involve criminal activity. Examples include graffiti, verbal abuse, and distribution of hate-group literature.

== On school campuses ==
Organizations such as the U.S. [[Community Relations Service]], the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]], and the [[Anti-Defamation League]] recommend that school administrators denounce bias incidents on their campuses regardless of whether a crime is committed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Responding to Hate Crimes and Bias-Motivated Incidents on College/University Campuses |publisher = Community Relations Service|date= May 2000 |page = 19|url = http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED446659}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.tolerance.org/supplement/identifying-and-responding-bias-incidents|title = Identifying And Responding To Bias Incidents|date = |accessdate = March 22, 2015|website = Teaching Tolerance|publisher = Southern Poverty Law Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=adl&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://archive.adl.org/campus/guide/bias_incidents.html|title = Hate Crimes and Bias Incidents|date = |accessdate = March 22, 2015|website = Responding to Bigotry and Intergroup Strife on Campus: Guide for College and University Administrators|publisher = Anti-Defamation League |year=2008 |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reasons for having such a policy include preventing minor incidents from escalating into violence and protecting the reputation of the school and its surrounding community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Hate Crimes on Campus: The Problem and Efforts to Confront It|last = Wessler|first = Stephen|publisher = Bureau of Justice Assistance|date= October 2001 |page = 11|url = http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED459656|last2 = Moss|first2 = Margaret}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=adl/&gt; Supporters of such policies say that they help maintain an atmosphere of civility in which people feel free to express themselves without fear of retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;Community Relations Service. pg. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 article in ''[[The Daily Caller]]'' argues that bias response policies that do not clearly define their scope are a threat to free speech because they could punish the expression of legitimate opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://dailycaller.com/2014/09/04/university-squelches-freedom-of-speech-with-campus-wide-discrimination-initiative/|title = University Squelches Freedom Of Speech With Campus-Wide Discrimination Initiative|last = Colton|first = Emma|date = September 4, 2014|journal = The Daily Caller |access-date = March 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A response to a bias incident begins with the victim or a bystander reporting it to the school's administration. After receiving the report, a school official (often a [[campus police]] officer) may begin to collect evidence and offer physical and emotional support to the victim.&lt;ref&gt;Community Relations Service. pg. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The institution may issue a public statement in order to dispel rumors, calm tensions, and state that bias incidents are not tolerated.&lt;ref name=adl/&gt; School leadership may hold an open meeting to discuss the incident. [[Diversity training]] events may be included during orientation programs in an effort to prevent bias incidents from happening in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Wessler &amp; Moss. pp. 11–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Law enforcement ==
Even if there is no crime to prosecute, some jurisdictions encourage their citizens to report bias incidents to the police. Police officers can provide assistance to the victims, and some police departments are required to keep records of reported bias incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/wales/discrimination_w/discrimination_hate_crime_e/what_are_hate_incidents_and_hate_crime.htm|title = What are hate incidents and hate crime?|date = |accessdate = March 22, 2015|website = Adviceguide|publisher = Citizens Advice|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bloom County''''' is an American [[comic strip]] by [[Berkeley Breathed]] which originally ran from December 8, 1980, until August 6, 1989.  It examined events in politics and culture through the viewpoint of a fanciful small town in [[Middle America (US)|Middle America]], where children often have adult personalities and vocabularies and where animals can talk.

On July 12, 2015, Breathed started drawing ''Bloom County'' again. The first revived strip was published via Facebook on July 13, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Mazza, Ed. (July 13, 2015) [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bloom-county-comic-strip-is-coming-back_55a32f7ce4b0b8145f72f611 'Bloom County' Comic Strip Is Coming Back] ''Huffington Post''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history and production==
&lt;!--Comparisons between Bloom County and Iowa **need to be referenced from secondary sources that describe aspects as similar**--&gt;
''Bloom County'' originated from a comic strip known as ''[[The Academia Waltz]]'', which Breathed produced for ''[[The Daily Texan]]'', the student newspaper of the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]]. The comic strip attracted the notice of the editors of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', who recruited him to do a nationally syndicated strip. On December 8, 1980, ''Bloom County'', syndicated by [[The Washington Post Writers Group]], made its debut and featured some of the characters from ''Academia Waltz,'' including former frat-boy [[Steve Dallas]] and the [[paraplegic]] [[Vietnam war]] veteran [[Cutter John]].

Breathed set ''Bloom County'' in a small town. Breathed said he made the choice because he had followed a girlfriend to [[Iowa City, Iowa|Iowa City]], [[Iowa]]; Breathed commented, "You draw—literally—from your life if you’re going to write anything with some juice to it. I did just that."&lt;ref name="ICv2int"&gt;"[http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/15842.html ICv2 Interview: Berkeley Breathed]." ''[[ICv2]]''. September 17, 2009. Retrieved September 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Breathed's hand-printed signature on his strips was usually presented in mirror image, i.e. right to left.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalnerdy.com/2009/07/30/my-statement-on-ie6 My Statement on IE6], www.globalnerdy.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Breathed was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in [[editorial cartooning]] in 1987 for ''Bloom County''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/book-news/comics/article/43048-berkeley-breathed-sets-the-record-straight.html Berkeley Breathed Sets the Record Straight], Sam Thielman (May 4, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Solomon1987"&gt;{{cite news |last=Solomon |first=Charles |date=November 26, 1987 |title=Strip That Split the Cartoonists |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24859341/strip_that_split_cartoonists_by/ |newspaper=[[The Los Angeles Times]] |publisher=The Times Mirror Company |location=Los Angeles, CA |volume=106 |issue=358 |edition=Main |department=View |pages=1,42 |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The win was disapproved of by many members of [[Association of American Editorial Cartoonists]].&lt;ref name="Charney2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldstein|first=Kalman|editor-last=Charney||editor-first=Maurice|title=Comedy: A Geographic and Historical Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Og4ntxFQP2cC&amp;pg=PA133|year=2005|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-32714-8|page=133|chapter=9.

==Characters==

===Core characters===
[[File:Bloom County characters.jpeg|thumb|right|300px|Major characters ''(from left to right)'': Oliver, Opus, Binkley, Steve Dallas, Portnoy, Milo, Bill, Hodge-Podge, and Milquetoast]]
At the very beginning of the strip (December 1980), the central setting was the Bloom boarding house run by the grandparents of Milo Bloom.  As the strip continued, various boarders (and/or pets) moved into the boarding house.  In the order the characters debuted:

*'''[[Milo Bloom]]''' is a 10-year-old newspaper reporter and probably the most worldly-wise of the bunch.  Milo was the original protagonist of ''Bloom County'', and much of the action takes place at the [[boarding house]] owned by his family. In the very earliest strips, Milo's grandfather ("The Major") was a central character, although after the first year or so, The Major's role diminished and the character soon vanished.
*'''[[Cutter John]]''' is a wheelchair-using [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] [[veteran]], noted for indulging in ''[[Star Trek]]'' fantasies with the meadow animals (Hodge-Podge, Portnoy and Opus), as well as [[anti-war]] protests. He is not a womanizer like Steve Dallas (below), but he is more popular with the ladies. His visage is nearly identical to that of Breathed himself. The character had previously appeared in Breathed's previous comic strip, ''The Academia Waltz'', where he had been known as 'Saigon John'.
*'''[[Steve Dallas]]''', introduced in May 1981, was (like Cutter John) originally a featured character in ''The Academia Waltz''.  Steve is Bloom County's sole defense attorney.  A chain smoker and former "[[frat boy]]," Dallas spends most of his free time either trying to seduce women or concocting get-rich-quick schemes, including forming and managing a [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band, [[Billy and the Boingers]] (previously known as [[Metal umlaut|Deathtöngue]]).
*'''[[Michael Binkley]]''' was also originally introduced in May 1981.  Binkley was a schoolmate of Milo's who did not live in the boardinghouse, but with his father, Tom Binkley. He is wishy-washy and overly reflective (in the mold of [[Charlie Brown]]), when not contemplating the lives of famous figures in [[popular culture|pop culture]], often at his father's bedside in the middle of the night.  His "anxiety closet" has been a staple of many storylines.
*'''[[Opus the Penguin|Opus]]''' is a large-nosed penguin (occasionally mistaken for a [[puffin]]) with a [[herring]] addiction who lost track of his mother during the [[Falklands War]]. (They were later reunited in a closing storyline at the end of the strip's first series.) He was originally introduced as the pet penguin of Michael Binkley ("A boy and his penguin!" "A penguin and his boy!") in June 1981. However, Opus was only seen in a few strips that month before disappearing.  He was then re-introduced as a full-time cast member in January 1982. By this point, Opus was no longer Binkley's pet, and he eventually became a boarder at the Bloom house. Opus' hopeless naïveté and optimism made him a fan favorite, and he quickly became the center of the strip, as well as the subject of two "sequel" strips (''[[Outland (comics)|Outland]]'' and ''[[Opus (comic strip)|Opus]]''), three children's books, and a television special entitled ''[[A Wish for Wings That Work]]''.
*'''[[Bill the Cat]]''' is a large orange tabby cat. Introduced originally in the summer of 1982 as a parody of the comic character [[Garfield]], and saying little beyond his trademark responses, "Ack" and "Pbthhh", he has become something of a blank slate around which various plots revolved. Numerous strips indicated that his persistent near-[[catatonia|catatonic]] state was the result of drug use or brain damage resulting from once being legally dead and then revived after too long a period. In the Christmas special ''A Wish for Wings That Work'', Opus recounts having rescued Bill from a University Science Lab where they had replaced his brains with [[Tater Tots]]. He's been a [[cult]] [[Rajneeshpuram|member]] ("[[Bhagwan]] Bill"), [[televangelist]] ("Fundamentally Oral Bill"), perennial [[Presidential]] candidate (for the National Radical Meadow Party), heavy metal rock star ("Wild Bill Catt"), nuclear power plant operator at [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]], and, in the last months of the series, had his brain surgically replaced with [[Donald Trump]]'s.  He has been known to speak on occasion, most notably during the [[Red Scare|Communist witch-hunt]] trials of which he has been a subject, when he remarked, "Say, you don't suppose the 'Jury Box' is anything like a litter box, do you?" Bill has apparently had affairs with [[Jeane Kirkpatrick]], [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Diana]] and [[Socks the cat]].
*'''[[Hodge-Podge (character)|Hodge-Podge]]''' is a rabbit who is best friends with Portnoy and Cutter John.  He is politically conservative and [[fanaticism|fanatical]] about various issues, despite the fact that he is extremely ignorant about those same issues. Both Hodge-Podge and Portnoy (below) started off circa 1982 as unnamed minor characters, whose roles gradually increased as the strip continued.
*'''[[Portnoy (Bloom County character)|Portnoy]]''' is a groundhog, although his [[species]] was a mystery for most of the strip's run. Before the revelation that he was a groundhog, he was portrayed as a squirrel, gopher, and possum.  Portnoy was the grouchiest and most bigoted character by far and in a few strips was a bully to Opus.
*'''[[Oliver Wendell Jones]]''' is a schoolmate of Milo and Binkley, introduced in 1983.  He is also a young [[Hacker (computer security)|computer hacker]] and gifted scientist, having invented a miracle hair-growth formula, among other things. He once tried to bring an end to the [[Cold War]] by introducing onto the front page of ''[[Pravda]]'' the headline, "[[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]] Urges Disarmament: Total! Unilateral!", but faulty translation caused the headline to read, "Gorbachev Sings Tractors: Turnip! Buttocks!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://i44.tinypic.com/20rl4is.jpg "Scan of actual strip"] Retrieved March 26, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He has a fairly extensive criminal record as a result of his numerous computer pranks.  Oliver is African-American.  [[Oliver Wendell Jones#Mothering|His mother]] has dressed her son to resemble Michael Jackson, much to Oliver's chagrin.

===Other characters===
{{See also|Minor characters in Bloom County}}
*[[Bobbi Harlow]] is the feminist schoolteacher of Milo and Binkley and the love interest of both Steve and Cutter. She was a major character until 1983, when she disappeared. She appears only once in the strip's later years, when Opus learns she has joined the crew of ''[[The Phil Donahue Show]]''.  In August of 1981, her parents visited, and met Steve, whom they disliked.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gocomics.com/bloomcounty/1981/08/07&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Minor characters in Bloom County#Quiche Lorraine|Quiche Lorraine]], cousin of Bobbi Harlow and one-time girlfriend of Steve Dallas.  She was only dating Steve because of his body.
*Cozy Fillerup, single mother and love interest to Cutter John. She was introduced in the 2015 revival of the strip when Cutter John and crew ran over her with his wheelchair, the "''Aluminium Falcon''."
*Abby Fillerup, Cozy's sole daughter. She was introduced in the 2015 revival of the strip. She practices yoga, acupuncture, and other [[New Age]] beliefs. As her introduction is quite recent, her importance and involvement with the future of the strip is unknown. She has been seen to participate in the gang's pop culture fantasies, and is often seen engaging in antics with the main cast.
*[[Tom Binkley]], Binkley's father, usually distraught over his son's behavior, his own divorce or mid-life crisis.
*[[Minor characters in Bloom County#Frank Jones|Frank Jones]], Oliver's father, who funds his son's scientific endeavors, particularly his cure for [[baldness]] made from cat-sweat.
*[[Minor characters in Bloom County#Mrs. Jones|Mrs. Jones]], Oliver's mother, distrustful of technology and science, usually with good reason.
*[[Lola Granola]], briefly Opus' fiancée.
*[[Milquetoast the Cockroach]]
*[[Rosebud the Basselope]]
*[[Ronald-Ann Smith]]

==Notable storylines==
''For detailed summaries of all storylines, see the entries for the individual books.''
* Opus was originally intended to have a run of just two weeks, but his status was cemented with a memorable Sunday strip involving a [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] asking for money. Opus continued to misunderstand the Krishna's request for money before finally misinterpreting "Prayer temples for Hare Krishnas" as "Pear pimples for hairy fishnuts!" Breathed wrote in one of the ''Bloom County'' books that the reaction was so overwhelmingly strong he made Opus a permanent member of the cast.
*In 1984 the American Meadow Party ran Bill the Cat as its presidential candidate opposing Ronald Reagan and Walter Mondale, with Opus as the vice presidential candidate. The sequence parodied the entire campaign season and the lengths some parties would go to, with Opus becoming near suicidal when told he is running behind pickled prunes in popularity polls. It did lead to the slogan of disaffected voters everywhere, "Don't blame me. I voted for Bill and Opus." 
* Steve forms a [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band with Opus, Hodge Podge, and Bill, initially called "Deathtöngue". Steve is forced to rename the band "Billy and the Boingers" after he is brought before a [[United States Congress|congressional]] hearing investigating the effect of heavy metal music on youth, similar to the [[Parents Music Resource Center]].
* Opus decides to reunite with his long-lost mother for Christmas in [[Antarctica]], only to discover that his mother supposedly died saving soldiers in the [[Falklands]] war.  Her gravestone reads, 'The Falklands Martyr: She Loved her Boy'. She is later revealed to be alive.
* The cast of Bloom County goes on [[labor strike|strike]].  W. A. Thornhump refuses to concede to any of their demands and attempts to have his office staff fill in.  Things get ugly when Steve Dallas crosses the picket line and Thornhump hires [[Strikebreaker|strike-breakers]] to play Opus, Bill, and Oliver.  In the end, the strikers are defeated, although Opus still throws eggs at Steve, saying "Here comes breakfast from Aunt Opus!!"
*Oliver invents Dr. Oliver's Scalp Tonic using Bill the Cat's perspiration motivated from the thought of [[Dan Quayle]] becoming US President.  The tonic miraculously will restore hair on anyone, but has the side effect of users coughing up hairballs.  The US government bans it, but the gang decide to continue producing it illegally after discovering that desperate customers are willing to buy it at exorbitant prices. In a parody of the [[war on drugs]], the gang is extremely successful while thwarting the ineffectual government attempts to stop the illegal trade. As violent crime arises from the trade, the tonic operation is fatally undermined when the government legalizes it. The effects are later to be shown as temporary, leaving Oliver's father totally bald.
*Oliver learns of the [[Apartheid]] system in South Africa. He invents a "pigmentizer", which will temporarily turn a white person black. Cutter John and Opus are dispatched to Washington to zap the [[South Africa]]n ambassador, but their balloon-powered wheelchair crashes into the Atlantic Ocean and they disappear. Though officially listed as "Eaten By Squid", Opus reappears some time later, suffering from such strong amnesia that he initially has no idea he is even a penguin. Eventually the fake news of a secret wedding between Eddie Murphy and Diane Sawyer, Opus' longtime crush, shocks him into recalling what happened. After drifting for a while between lost islands, using the wheelchair as a raft, Cutter John and Opus were rescued by a Soviet submarine and arrested as spies. In order to rescue him, Steve Dallas meets with Russian envoys to trade Cutter John in for the one thing they want from Bloom County: Bill the Cat.
*Donald Trump is accidentally and fatally injured by the anchor of his own yacht. Incredibly, surgeons turn to Bill the Cat as a donor body in which to insert Trump's still-living brain. Trapped in Bill's body, Trump finds himself disinherited from his financial empire and estranged from his wife [[Ivana Trump|Ivana]]. With nowhere else to turn, he takes Bill's place in the Bloom County boarding house, making unsuccessful attempts to start from scratch and occasionally being given equally unsuccessful lessons on the value of life by Opus. This eventually culminates in Trump regaining power and using it to buy out Bloom County, firing the entire staff of characters in the process.

==End and spinoff strips==
Breathed decided to end the strip in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kahn |first=Joseph P. |date=May 7, 1989 |title=Cartoonist is quiet on plans to move out of Bloom County |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24859879/cartoonist_is_quiet_about_plans_to/ |newspaper=[[Daily Record (Morristown)|Daily Record]] |publisher=Morristown Newspapers |location=[[Parsippany-Troy Hills, New Jersey|Parsipanny]], NJ |volume=2 |issue=164 |page= |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with the continuity of the Bill the Cat/Donald Trump storyline, Trump "buys out" the comic strip and fires all of the cast. In the strip's final weeks the cast found new "jobs" with other comic strips. A "goodbye party" was held over the course of the week where characters talked about joining new strips. Portnoy and Hodge Podge get jobs as janitors behind the scenes at ''[[Marmaduke]]''; Steve Dallas joins the cast of ''[[Cathy (comic strip)|Cathy]]'' and attempts to pitch himself as a new superhero, but is quickly fired from both jobs; Michael Binkley becomes a wild boar skinner for ''[[Prince Valiant]]''. [[Lola Granola]] says that she's been invited to pose for ''[[Playboy]]'', which Opus dislikes. Milo Bloom is seen with a snake swallowing him head first and informing Opus he would be appearing Tuesdays in ''[[The Far Side]]''. Oliver Wendell Jones is seen with the distinct features of ''[[Family Circus]]'' characters. He informs Opus he is being "[[Desegregation busing in the United States|bussed in]]" to the strip as part of a court order. Once ''Bloom County'' characters are scattered, only Opus is left as part of a plot to transition to Breathed's next strip in ''Bloom County'''s final week.

Shortly after ''Bloom County'' ended, Breathed started a [[Sunday strip|Sunday-only strip]] called ''[[Outland (comic strip)|Outland]]'' with original characters and situations introduced in ''Bloom County'''s final days. However, Opus, Bill and other characters eventually reappeared and slowly took over the strip. ''Outland'' ran from September 3, 1989, to March 26, 1995. Another Sunday-only spinoff strip called ''[[Opus (comic strip)|Opus]]'' ran from November 23, 2003, to November 2, 2008.

==Return==
On July 12, 2015, Breathed posted to his Facebook page a photo with the caption "A return after 25 years. Feels like going home." The photo showed him drawing a comic strip with the title ''Bloom County 2015'' with Opus pictured in the first frame.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/berkeleybreathed/photos/a.114529165244512.10815.108793262484769/1003525033011583/?type=1&amp;theater Facebook posting]&lt;/ref&gt; A fan asked in the comments on the picture if this was in response to [[Donald Trump]]'s presidential campaign, and Mr. Breathed responded to the comment that "This creator can't precisely deny that the chap you mention had nothing to do with it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Breathed|first1=Berkeley|title=Photo on Facebook Page|url=https://www.facebook.com/berkeleybreathed/photos/a.114529165244512.10815.108793262484769/1003525033011583/?type=1|website=Facebook|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, July 13, 2015, the first comic of the revived strip was officially posted online, also to Breathed's Facebook page.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/berkeleybreathed/photos/a.114529165244512.10815.108793262484769/1004028256294594/?type=1&amp;theater Facebook posting]&lt;/ref&gt; The strip was relaunched under the ''Bloom County 2015'' title, only to be renamed simply as ''Bloom County'' at the start of 2016.

On the return of the strips Breathed stated,{{quote|Deadlines and dead-tree media took the fun out of a daily craft that was only meant to be fun. I had planned to return to Bloom County in 2001, but the sullied air sucked the oxygen from my kind of whimsy. Bush and Cheney’s fake war dropped it for a decade like a bullet to the head. But silliness suddenly seems safe now. Trump’s merely a sparkling symptom of a renewed national ridiculousness. We’re back baby.}} Breathed originally had no plans of publishing the new strips outside of his Facebook page, commenting that “Newspapers need deadlines, alas. Like my departed friend [[Douglas Adams]] used to say, the only part of deadlines I enjoyed was the whooshing sound as they sped by.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/13/berkeley-breathed-publishes-first-new-bloom-county-strip-since-1989/|title=Berkeley Breathed Publishes First New 'Bloom County' Strip Since 1989 - The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; An archive of the new strips has started at [[GoComics]] since then.  A new book was announced in June 2016, ''Bloom County Episode XI: A New Hope'' will be a compilation of strips from 2015 and 2016.

==Influence==
''Bloom County'' has had an influence on other cartoonists, particularly cartoonists who have an irreverent bent or tackle political topics in their work.

For example, Scott Kurtz, creator of the [[webcomic]] ''[[PvP]]'', acknowledged Breathed's contributions at one point with a strip expressing the opinion that "so many webcomics. ..are nothing but ''Bloom County'' ripoffs", then lampooning itself by [[mimic]]king Breathed's art and dialogue style in the final panel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pvponline.com/comic/1999/10/01/fri-oct-01/ PvPonline » Archive » Fri Oct 01&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aaron McGruder]], creator of the comic and later animated series ''[[The Boondocks (TV series)|The Boondocks]]'', has paid homage to Breathed's work as well, with a few aspects of the strip bearing more than a passing resemblance to important ''Bloom County'' features (including at least a couple of artistic similarities), and an episode of the animated series wherein the character Uncle Ruckus calls Breathed "Master Penguin Draw'er".

The series was adapted into the 1991 animated Christmas special entitled ''[[A Wish for Wings That Work]]'', which is now available on DVD.

==Bloom County==
The fictional setting of ''Bloom County'' served as a recurring backdrop for the comic and its sequels, although the nature of the setting was frequently altered.

In the comics, the county is presented as a stereotypical [[Midwestern United States|American midwestern]] small town. The small town setting was frequently contrasted with the increasing [[globalization]] taking place in the rest of the world; though Bloom County contained the likes of farmers and wilderness creatures by default, it was frequented by [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishnas]], feminists, and [[rock and roll|rock]] stars.

While the location of Bloom County is never explicitly mentioned, there have been some clues in the strip. When Oliver Jones identified Bloom County as the place where [[Comet Halley|Halley's Comet]] would crash into Earth, a sign was seen saying that it was at 35.05 N  146.55 E. This would place it in the Pacific Ocean, about 300 miles off the coast of Japan. Oliver's previous calculation was 39.43 N  105.01 W, which would place it just south of [[Denver, Colorado]]. In an early strip, Milo gives his address as "Box 163, Bloom County, N.I., 12460", the zip code for which would place it about 30 miles southwest of [[Albany, New York]].  Another strip has Opus trying to make airline reservations to [[Des Moines, Iowa]].  He balks at the outrageously high quoted price for a ticket stating that "Des Moines is just 94 miles from Bloom County".  Geographically, this would place Bloom County in either [[Iowa]] or the far north-central tier of counties of [[Missouri]], but likely referring to the distance from [[Iowa City]], where the strip was produced, to Des Moines. (See Real World References below). Also, in a Sunday strip with L.H. Puttgrass, he is holding a [[King Soopers]] bag, which would place the comic in Colorado.  On January 29, 2016, Berkeley Breathed posted on Facebook that "The Bloom County boarding house still sits in beautiful hayseedless Iowa City, home for this cartoonist for four years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Breathed|first1=Berkeley|title=Berkeley Breathed's Bloom County|url=https://www.facebook.com/berkeleybreathed/posts/1124245374272881|website=Facebook|publisher=Berkeley Breathed|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The county was home to the Bloom Boarding House, Steve Dallas' law offices, the ''Bloom Beacon'' and ''Bloom Picayune'' newspapers, at least one pond, and Milo's Meadow. In the comic's later years, the county contained what appeared to be a big-city [[ghetto]] ("the wrong side of the tracks", as it was known).

The geographical profile of the county was fluid as the artistic style of the strip evolved. During most of ''Bloom County'''s run, the rural meadow setting was presented realistically, while in its later years it became increasingly more abstract.

The ''Outland'' setting of the strip was originally set apart from the county by way of a magical doorway. By ''Outland''&lt;nowiki&gt;'s&lt;/nowiki&gt; end, the Outland appeared to be a part of Bloom County itself.

The final ''Outland'' strip listed the characters as living at "555 Hairybutt St. Bloom County, Outland".

''Opus'' also takes place in Bloom County.

===Real-world references===
[[File:Iowa city linsay house.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Linsay House]], Iowa City, model for the Bloom County boarding house.]]
The setting of ''Bloom County'' resembled [[Iowa City, Iowa]], in several ways; Breathed lived there during the early years of the strip. The Bloom Boarding House, for example, which appeared as a high contrast photo within the strip, is modeled after the [[Linsay House]] located at 935 East College Street in Iowa City.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Holden | first=Greg | title=The Booklover's Guide to the Midwest: A Literary Tour | page=113 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ItuQdL22RKgC&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;ots=QpagjMvkk-&amp;dq=linsay%20house%20bloom%20county&amp;pg=PA113#v=onepage&amp;q=linsay%20house%20bloom%20county&amp;f=false | publisher=Clerisy Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Langton|first1=Diane|title=Time Machine: Bloom County House|url=http://thegazette.com/subject/news/time-machine-bloom-county-house-20150126|accessdate=26 March 2015|work=Cedar Rapids Gazette|date=January 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Iowa City landmark, The [[Prairie Lights]] Bookstore, was referred to in the strip as the Prairie Lights Newsstand, original ''Bloom County'' artwork from Breathed hangs in the bookstore. An original ''Bloom County'' strip hangs in the [[Iowa City Public Library]]. Breathed used the [[call letters]] [[KRNA]] to refer to ''Bloom County'''s rock radio station featuring [[Minor characters in Bloom County#"Rockin' Charmin' Harmin"|"Rockin' Charmin' Harmon"]]. The call letters belong to an actual Iowa City rock station which featured a disc jockey named "Charmin'" Jeff Harmon in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.krna.com 94.1 KRNA – Eastern Iowa’s Real Rock&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Several Iowa City local news items also directly inspired ''Bloom County'' storylines. For example, a fictional Ronald Reagan sexist gaffe, referring to women as "little dumplin's", was lifted from [[University of Iowa]] football coach [[Hayden Fry]]'s comment, infuriating feminists at the university.&lt;ref name="UPI_Fry"&gt;{{cite web|title=No changes for Bloom County|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1985/05/05/No-changes-for-Bloom-County/3340484113600/|website=UPI|publisher=United Press International, Inc.|accessdate=15 March 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315045026/http://www.upi.com/Archives/1985/05/05/No-changes-for-Bloom-County/3340484113600/|archivedate=15 March 2017|language=en|date=5 May 1985|quote=One of the more notable Iowa-born gags followed University of Iowa football Coach Hayden Fry's remark in calling women 'little dumplings.' Breathed turned that into a presidential crisis by having Ronald Reagan misquoted in The New York Times as calling feminists 'little dumplings.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Bloom County'' books==
Like many other popular comic strips, ''Bloom County'' has been republished in various [[Comics collection|collections]]. By 2004, the comic strip was reprinted in 11 books, the first having been published in 1983 and the last in that year. None of the reprints contained complete runs of the strip, although ''Bloom County Babylon'' contained many of the strips that preceded ''[[Loose Tails]]''.  All of the daily strips have been reprinted in ''[[Comics Revue]]'' magazine.

[[IDW Publishing]] published ''The Bloom County Library'', a five volume hardback [[Comics collection|collection]] of all ''Bloom County'' strips, beginning in October 2009.  This series is part of their ''Library of American Comics'' series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idwpublishing.com/news/article/252/ IDW Press Release] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208125617/http://www.idwpublishing.com/news/article/252/ |date=February 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a complete reprint of the strip, including side notes about cultural and political references made in the strip, "Headlines" breaks to identify the top stories of the day, and commentary from Breathed. Each volume has three separate releases: a standard edition, a signed edition, and a signed, remarked edition. Breathed said that the reason why the strips printed in ''The Bloom County Library'' were not published in previous collections was that the publisher would not let Breathed publish 400 pages each year, so Breathed had to reduce the content in each book. Breathed also said that he believes that, "I just closed my eyes and dropped a dart on the ones to be included." He felt relieved the publishers did not "have to ask […] to do this again."&lt;ref name="ICv2int"/&gt;

On October 25, 2017 IDW published ''Bloom County: Real, Classy, &amp; Compleat: 1980-1989'', collecting the complete run of ''Bloom County'' in two volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.idwpublishing.com/bring-the-complete-bloom-county-home-today/ |date=October 25, 2017 |title=Bring The Complete Bloom County Home Today |author=Staff writer |website=IDW |publisher=IDW Entertainment |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181026194329/https://www.idwpublishing.com/bring-the-complete-bloom-county-home-today/ |archive-date=October 26, 2018 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; An "Ultimate Collectors Set" was also released, including the original art from a daily strip featuring Opus, a page from Breathed's sketchbooks, and a personalized sketch of Opus on the slipcover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/09/19/berke-breatheds-new-complete-bloom-county-set-costs-1200-heres/ |date=September 17, 2017 |title=Berke Breathed’s New Complete ‘Bloom County’ Set Costs $1200 – Here’s Why |last=Johnston |first=Rich |website=[[Bleeding Cool]] |publisher=[[Avatar Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Charles Wong''' ({{zh|t=黃景培}}; born April 27, 1941) is a former [[politician]] in Ontario, [[Canada]]. He was a [[Ontario Liberal Party|Liberal]] member of the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]] from 1987 to 1990 who represented the [[Downtown Toronto|downtown]] [[Toronto]] riding of [[Fort York (electoral district)|Fort York]].

In private life, served as chair of Goulding, Rose &amp; Turner Ltd.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pas.gov.on.ca/scripts/en/bios.asp?boardID=140156&amp;persID=154554 |title=Public Appointments Secretariat, Ontario, Canada: Agency Members Biographies |publisher=www.pas.gov.on.ca |accessdate=2011-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a director of May Mikkila Inc., Abico Management Ltd., Multilingual Television Ltd., Channel 47 Toronto (Canada's first multilingual television station)&lt;ref name=icao/&gt; and Sky Continental Management Inc.

He also is the author of "Computing: An Introduction" and the co-author of "Algorithms", both published in 1967.

==Politics==
He was elected to the Ontario legislature in the [[Ontario general election, 1987|1987 provincial election]], defeating [[Joe Pantalone]] of the [[New Democratic Party of Ontario|New Democratic Party]] (NDP) by 137 votes in the downtown Toronto riding of [[Fort York (electoral district)|Fort York]].&lt;ref name="1987 results"&gt;{{cite news |title=Results from individual ridings |newspaper=The Windsor Star |date=September 11, 1987 |page=F2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was appointed to cabinet on September 29, 1987 as [[Minister of Energy (Ontario)|Minister of Energy]].&lt;ref name="1987PetCab"&gt;{{cite news |title=Wrye gets new cabinet job |newspaper=The Windsor Star |date=September 29, 1987 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named [[Ministry of Citizenship and Immigration (Ontario)|Minister of Citizenship]] responsible for race relations, multiculturalism and [[Ontario Human Rights Commission]] on August 2, 1989.&lt;ref name="1989PetCab"&gt;{{cite news |title=Veterans bear load as 8 ministers cut in Peterson shuffle |last=Allen |first=Gene |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |date=August 3, 1989 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Liberals were defeated by the NDP in the [[Ontario general election, 1990|1990 provincial election]], and Wong lost the Fort York riding by about 1,500 votes to [[Rosario Marchese]].&lt;ref name="1990 results"&gt;{{cite news |title=Ontario election: Riding-by-riding voting results |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |date=September 7, 1990 |page=A12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sought to return to the legislature in the [[Ontario general election, 1995|1995 election]], but lost again to Marchese by over 2,000 votes.&lt;ref name="1995 Election Results"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://results.elections.on.ca/results/1995_results/valid_votes.jsp?e_code=36&amp;rec=0&amp;district=fort+york&amp;flag=E&amp;layout=G |title=Summary of Valid Ballots by Candidate |publisher=Elections Ontario |date=June 8, 1995 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223210723/http://results.elections.on.ca/results/1995_results/valid_votes.jsp?e_code=36&amp;rec=0&amp;district=fort+york&amp;flag=E&amp;layout=G |archivedate=February 23, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26411">A '''lightweight web browser''' is a [[web browser]] that sacrifices some of the features of a mainstream web browser in order to reduce the consumption of [[system resource]]s, and especially to minimize the [[memory footprint]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9243574/5_lesser_known_browsers_Free_lightweight_and_low_maintenance?pageNumber=1 |title=5 lesser-known browsers: Free, lightweight and low-maintenance |last=Arora |first=Himanshu |date=6 November 2013 |website=[[Computerworld]] |publisher=International Data Group |accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://freecode.com/articles/lightweight-web-browsers |title=Lightweight Web Browsers |last=Klimkiewicz |first=Kamil |date=18 January 2003 |website=[[Freecode]] |publisher=Dice Holdings |accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geekiest.net/post/Memory-usage-of-the-browsers-Lightest-browser.aspx |title=Memory usage of the browsers – Lightest browser |last=Arimbra |first=Krishnan |date=16 July 2013 |website=Geekiest.Net |accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tables below compare lightweight web browsers. Several of them use a common [[Browser engine|layout engine]], but each has a unique combination of features and a potential niche. The minimal [[user interface]] in [[surf (web browser)|surf]], for example, does not have [[Tab (GUI)|tabs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://surf.suckless.org/ |title=surf |accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas [[xombrero]] can be driven with [[vi]]-like keyboard commands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://opensource.conformal.com/wiki/xombrero#Quick-Start_Tutorial |title=xombrero wiki § Quick-Start Tutorial |date=1 March 2012 |last=Peereboom |first=Marco |last2=Hill |first2=David |publisher=Conformal Systems |accessdate=30 August 2014|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four of the browsers compared—[[Lynx (web browser)|Lynx]], [[w3m]], [[Links (web browser)|Links]], and [[ELinks]]—are designed for [[text mode]], and can function in a [[terminal emulator]]. Links 2 has both a [[text-based user interface]] and a [[graphical user interface]]. w3m is, in addition to being a web browser, also a [[terminal pager]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://w3m.sourceforge.net/ |title=w3m |last=Ito |first=Akinori |website=w3m.sourceforge.net |accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
&lt;!--
STOP: Please do not add entries to this list that do not have their own separate articles. See WP:WTAF and WP:NOTDIR for details.
This list of lightweight web browsers needs to include the file size of the browser in order to compare.

'''Context management''' is a dynamic computer process that uses 'subjects' of data in one application, to point to data resident in a separate application also containing the same subject.

[[Context_(computing)|Context]] management allows users to choose a subject once in one application, and have all other applications containing information on that same subject 'tune' to the data they contain, thus eliminating the need to redundantly select the subject in the varying applications.

An example from the [[healthcare industry]] where Context Management is widely used, multiple applications operating "in context" through use of a context manager would allow a user to select a patient (i.e., the subject) in one application and when the user enters the other application, that patient's information is already pre-fetched and presented, obviating the need to re-select the patient in the second application.  The further the user 'drills' into the application (e.g., test, result, diagnosis, etc.) all context aware applications continue to drill-down into the data, in context with the user's requests.

Context management is gaining in prominence in healthcare due to the creation of the '''Clinical Context Object Workgroup''' standard committee ([[CCOW]]) which has created a standardized protocol enabling applications to function in a 'context aware' state.

Context management is gaining in the Business Rule market as well.  Knowing the context of any information exchange is critical. For example, a seller may need to know such things as: is this shipment urgent, is this a preferred customer,
do they need English or Spanish, what model is the part for? Without context, mistakes and run-on costs rapidly ensue.
In automating information integration, knowing and defining context of use is the single most pervasive and important factor.
This context mechanism is at the heart of allowing users to quantify what their context factors are precisely, this removes the guess work from business transaction exchanges between business transaction information management partners and allows them to formalize their collaboration agreements exactly.

The '''Dormition of the Mother of God''' ({{lang-el|Κοίμησις Θεοτόκου}}, ''Koímēsis [[Theotokos|Theotokou]]'' often anglicized as ''Kimisis;'' Bulgarian: Успение на Пресвета Богородица, "Uspenie na Presveta Bogoroditsa", Russian: Успение Пресвятыя Богородицы, ''Uspenie Presvetia Bogoroditsi;'' Georgian: მიძინება ყოვლადწმიდისა ღვთისმშობელისა) is a [[Great Feasts of the Orthodox Church|Great Feast]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox Churches|Oriental Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] which commemorates the "falling asleep" or death of [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Mary]] the ''[[Theotokos]]'' ("[[Mother of God]]", literally translated as ''God-bearer''), and her bodily resurrection before being taken up into heaven. It is celebrated on [[15 August]] (28 August [[Old Style and New Style dates|N.S.]] for those following the [[Julian Calendar]]) as the '''Feast of the Dormition''' of the Mother of God. The [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] celebrates the Dormition not on a fixed date, but on the Sunday nearest 15 August.

The death or Dormition of Mary is not recorded in the [[New Testament|Christian canonical scriptures]].

[[Hippolytus of Thebes]], a 7th- or 8th-century author, claims in his partially preserved chronology to the New Testament that Mary lived for 11 years after the death of Jesus, dying in [[AD 41]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Paul's early period: chronology, mission strategy, theology| author= [[Rainer Riesner]]| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=7mAqa7PYr4kC&amp;pg=PA120| page=120| accessdate= August 20, 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Dormition'' expresses the belief that the Virgin died without suffering, in a state of spiritual peace. This belief does not rest on any scriptural basis, but is based on apocryphal writings. In [[Pseudo-John]] the Evangelist's ''Liber de Dormitione Mariae'', lit. "Book of the Dormition of Mary", known in English as "The Falling Asleep of the Holy Mother of God", Mary's soul is carried to heaven, while her body is carried away by angels to be preserved until the ultimate [[Resurrection of the Dead|resurrection]].&lt;ref name="Westminster"&gt;Alan Richardson, John Bowden (editors), ''The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology'', p.[https://books.google.com/books?id=PN7UMUTBBPAC&amp;pg=PA48  48], 1983, Westminster John Knox Press, {{ISBN|9780664227487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dormition fast==

The Feast of the Dormition is preceded by a two-week [[fasting|fast]], referred to as the Dormition Fast. From August 1 to August 14 (inclusive) [[Eastern Orthodoxy#Fasting|Orthodox]] and Eastern Catholics fast from [[red meat]], [[poultry]], [[Broth|meat products]], [[dairy|dairy products]] (eggs and milk products), fish, oil, and wine. The Dormition Fast is a stricter fast than either the [[Nativity Fast]] (Advent) or the [[Apostles' Fast]], with only wine and oil (but no fish) allowed on weekends. As with the other Fasts of the Church year, there is a [[Great Feast]] that falls during the Fast; in this case, the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]] (August 6), on which fish, wine and oil are allowed.

In some places, the services on weekdays during the Fast are similar to the services during [[Great Lent]] (with some variations). Many churches and monasteries in the Russian tradition perform the lenten services on at least the first day of the Dormition Fast. In the Greek tradition, during the Fast either the Great [[Paraklesis]] (Supplicatory [[Canon (hymnography)|Canon]]) or the Small Paraklesis is celebrated every evening except Saturday evening and the Eves of the Transfiguration and the Dormition.&lt;ref&gt;Outside the Dormition Fast it is always the Small Supplicatory Canon (Paraklesis) which is chanted. During the Dormition Fast, however, the [[Typikon]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} prescribes that the Small and Great Supplicatory Canons be chanted on alternate evenings: If August 1st falls on a Monday through Friday, the cycle begins with the Small Supplicatory Canon; if August 1st falls on a Saturday or Sunday, the cycle begins with the Great Supplicatory Canon.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first day of the Dormition Fast is a [[feast day]] called the [[Procession of the Cross]] (August 1), on which day it is customary to have an [[Procession#Outdoors|outdoor procession]] and perform the [[holy water#Lesser Blessing of Waters|Lesser Blessing of Water]]. In Eastern Orthodoxy it is also the day of the Holy Seven Maccabees, Martyrs Abimus, Antonius, Gurias, Eleazar, Eusebonus, Alimus, and Marcellus, their mother Solomonia, and their teacher Eleazar. Therefore, the day is sometimes referred to as "Makovei". Finally it is also considered the First of the three "Feasts of the Saviour" in August, the Feast to the All-Merciful Saviour and the Most Holy Mother of God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holytrinityorthodox.com/calendar/index.htm Holy Trinity Russian Orthodox Church - Orthodox Calendar]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance of the feast==

In Orthodoxy and Catholicism, in the language of the scripture, death is often called a "sleeping" or "falling asleep" (Greek κοίμησις; whence κοιμητήριον &gt; ''coemetērium'' &gt; cemetery, "a place of sleeping"). A prominent example of this is the name of this feast; another is the Dormition of [[Saint Anne|Anna]], Mary's mother.

==Origin and adoption of the tradition==
[[File:Theofanus uspenie.jpg|thumb|Icon of the Dormition by [[Theophan the Greek]], 1392. The [[Theotokos]] is depicted lying on a [[bier]], surrounded by the [[Twelve Apostles]]. At center, [[Jesus Christ]] is shown in a [[mandorla]], swaddling the [[soul]] of the Virgin Mary (a red [[seraph]] is shown above his head). To either side of him are depicted the [[Hieromartyr]]s [[Dionysius the Areopagite]] and [[Ignatius of Antioch|Ignatius the God-Bearer]] who, according to tradition, are responsible for transmitting the account of the dormition.]]

===Related sites===

The Dormition tradition is associated with various places, most notably with [[Jerusalem]], which contains [[Mary's Tomb]] and the [[Hagia Maria Sion Abbey|Basilica of the Dormition]], and [[Ephesus]], which contains the [[House of the Virgin Mary]], and also with [[Constantinople]] where the [[Cincture of the Theotokos]] was enshrined from the 5th through 14th centuries.

===1st-5th century===

The first four Christian centuries are silent regarding the end of the Virgin Mary's life, though it is asserted, without surviving documentation, that the feast of the Dormition was being observed in Jerusalem shortly after the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]].&lt;ref&gt;A fairly representative example of mainstream Orthodox teaching is offered by Sophia Fotopoulou: "We have no historical data to indicate how long the Mother of God remained on earth after the [[ascension of Christ]] into heaven, nor when, where, or how she died, for the Gospels say nothing of this. The foundation for the feast of the Dormition is to be found in a [[sacred tradition]] of the Church dating from apostolic times, apocryphal writings, the constant faith of the People of God, and the unanimous opinion of the [[church fathers|holy Fathers]] and [[Doctors of the Church]] of the first thousand years of Christianity." [http://www.newsfinder.org/site/more/the_dormition_of_theotokos  "The Dormition of the Theotokos"].&lt;/ref&gt;

Up until the 5th century [[Church Fathers]] do not mention the death of the Virgin, and before the 4th-5th century Dormition was not celebrated among the Christians as a holy day.&lt;ref&gt;Прот. Владимир Сорокин. [http://www.btrudy.ru/resources/BT10/67_Sorokin.pdf Догмат Римско-Католической Церкви о взятии Божией Матери в небесную славу с православной точки зрения]. // [[Богословские труды]]. Вып. 10. Московская Патриархия, 1973. С. 71, 74&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] (c. 310/20–403), a Jew by birth, born in [[Phoenicia]], converted to Christianity in adulthood and lived as a monk for over 20 years in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] from 335-340 to 362, writes in "[[Panarion]]" in "Contra antidicomarianitas" about the death of the Virgin Mary the following:
:"If any think [ I ] am mistaken, moreover, let them search through the scriptures any neither find Mary's death, nor whether or not she died, nor whether or not she was buried — even though John surely travelled throughout Asia. And yet, nowhere does he say that he took the holy Virgin with him. Scripture simply kept silence because of the overwhelming wonder, not to throw men's minds into consternation. For I dare not say — though I have my suspicions, I keep silent. Perhaps, just as her death is not to be found, so I may have found some traces of the holy and blessed Virgin."{{citation needed |date= June 2018}} "The holy virgin may have died and been buried — her falling asleep was with honour, her death in purity, her crown in virginity. Or she may have been put to death — as the scripture says, 'And a sword shall pierce through her soul' — her fame is among the martyrs and her holy body, by which light rose on the world, [rests] amid blessings. Or she may have remained alive, for God is not incapable of doing whatever he wills. No one knows her end. But we must not honour the saints to excess; we must honor their Master. It is time for the error of those who have gone astray to cease."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ru.scribd.com/doc/166106444/Frank-Williams-the-Panarion-of-Epiphanius-of-Salamis-Books-II-and-III-de-Fide-2013 Frank Williams, "The ''Panarion'' of Epiphanius of Salamis", Books II and III, 78, Contra antidicomarianst. 23.8; p. 635]{{dead link |date= December 2016 |bot= InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christians in the late 4th century had different opinions regarding Mary's death; some believed that she was martyred. For this reason, [[Ambrose]], for example, wrote:
:"Neither the letter of Scripture nor Tradition does not teach us that Mary had left this life as a consequence of suffering from bodily ulcers."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lTERAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=ru#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false PL 15 EXPOSITIO EVANG. SEC. LUC. LIB. II. 61. col. 1574]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late 5th till 7th century===

The earliest Dormition traditions surface in manuscripts at some point in the late 5th century, when three distinct narrative traditions describing the end of Mary's life suddenly appear.&lt;ref name="Shoemaker"&gt;Stephen J. Shoemaker, 2003. ''Ancient Traditions of the Virgin Mary's Dormition and Assumption' ([[Oxford University Press]])&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Shoemaker characterised them as the "Palm of the Tree of Life" narratives, the "Bethlehem" narratives, and the "Coptic" narratives—aside from a handful of atypical narratives.&lt;ref name="Shoemaker"/&gt;

The events of the Dormition of the Virgin and her burial are dealt with in several known [[apocrypha]]: "Tale of the Dormition of the Virgin" by Pseudo-John the Theologian (emerged in the mid-5th century or later),&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/apocalypsesapocr02tiscuoft#page/94/mode/2up Тischеndоrf С. Apocalypses apocryphae. Mosis, Esdrae, Pauli, Ioannis item Mariae Dormitio. Lipsiae, 1866, p. 95–112]&lt;/ref&gt; "De transitu Virginis Mariae" by [[Pseudo-Melitus|Pseudo-Melito of Sardis]] (5th century),&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-AQRAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=ru#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  p. 5, col. 1231]&lt;/ref&gt; the composition of [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]], "According to John, Archbishop of Thessalonica." One of these apocrypha is placed in the "History of the Church" by [[Nikephoros Kallistos Xanthopoulos]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=anUyAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=ru#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false PG. 145. Col. 812—817]&lt;/ref&gt;

All listed apocrypha are quite late - 5th and 6th century - and their content differs from each other. Therefore, the Church did not adopt all their content, but only the basic idea that the Virgin Mary blissfully rested and Her soul was adopted by her Son Jesus Christ at Dormition. According to Nikephoros Kallistos Xanthopoulos in his "History of the Church," Emperor [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]] (582—602) issued an edict which set the date for the celebration of the Dormition - August 15.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rIe6FDUeeg8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=ru#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false PG. 147. Col. 292]&lt;/ref&gt; After that Christians in the empire began to celebrate the death of the Virgin Mary. [[Modestus of Jerusalem|Modestus, Patriarch of Jerusalem]] (630—632) said at this celebration, while preaching, that he regrets the lack of specific information about the death of the Virgin Mary.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9sYUAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=ru#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  p. 86b, col. 3278-3312]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rome the feast called Dormitio Beatae Virginis was established by [[Pope Sergius I]] (687-701), borrowed from Constantinople.&lt;ref&gt;[http://krotov.info/history/00/posnov/16_posn.html#_Toc536360531 М. Поснов. История Христианской Церкви]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Narrative===

According to later Catholic{{dubious|No source given. Seems to be at least also Orthodox, by further text here.|date=July 2018}} tradition, Mary, having spent her life after [[Pentecost]] supporting and serving the nascent Church, was living in the house of the Apostle John, in Jerusalem, when the Archangel Gabriel revealed to her that her death would occur three days later.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} The [[Twelve apostles|apostles]], scattered throughout the world, are said to have been miraculously transported to be at her side when she died. The sole exception was [[Thomas (Apostle)|Thomas]], who was preaching in [[Thomas the Apostle#Mission in India|India]]. He is said to have arrived in a cloud above her tomb exactly three days after her death, and to have seen her body leaving to heaven. He asked her "Where are you going, O Holy One?", at which she took off her [[Girdle of Thomas|girdle]] and gave it to him saying "Receive this my friend", after which she disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Dormition (Keemeesis) of the Theotokos |url= http://www.balamand.edu.lb/theology/feastdormition.htm |work= The Life of the Virgin Mary, The Theotokos |publisher= Holy Apostles Convent and Dormition Skete |accessdate= 6 May 2011|deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110517103818/http://www.balamand.edu.lb/theology/feastdormition.htm |archivedate=17 May 2011 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas was taken to his fellow apostles, whom he asked to see her grave, so that he could bid her goodbye. Mary had been buried in [[Gethsemane]], according to her request. When they arrived at the grave, her body was gone, leaving a sweet fragrance. An apparition is said to have confirmed that [[Jesus|Christ]] had taken her body to heaven after three days to be reunited with her soul. [[Orthodox theology]] teaches that the [[Theotokos]] has already undergone the bodily [[resurrection]], which all will experience at the [[second coming]], and stands in heaven in that [[glorification|glorified]] state which the other righteous ones will only enjoy after the [[Last Judgment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Ware |first= Archimandrite Kallistos |author-link= Timothy Ware |last2= Mary |first2= Mother |title= The Festal Menaion |place= London |publisher= Faber and Faber |year= 1984 |page=64 |isbn= 0-571-11137-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dormition versus Assumption==

The Dormition of the Theotokos is celebrated on August 15 (August 28, [[Old Style and New Style dates|N.S.]] for those following the [[Julian Calendar]]), the same calendar day as the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] Feast of the [[Assumption of Mary]]. The Dormition and the Assumption are the different names respectively in use by the Eastern and Catholic traditions for the end of Mary's life and departure from the earth, although the beliefs are not necessarily identical.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Orthodox view===

The Orthodox Church specifically holds one of the two Roman Catholic alternative beliefs, teaching that Mary died a natural death, like any human being; that her soul was received by Christ upon death; and that her body was [[resurrection|resurrected]] on the third day after her repose, at which time she was taken up, bodily only, into [[heaven]] when the apostles, miraculously transported from the ends of the earth, found her tomb to be empty.&lt;ref name=Menaia&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.anastasis.org.uk/15aug.htm |title= Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130526022525/http://www.anastasis.org.uk/15aug.htm |archivedate= 2013-05-26 |df= }} "The Menaia &amp;ndash; 15 August  &amp;ndash; Commemoration of the Falling Asleep of our Most Holy Lady, the Mother of God and Ever-Virgin Mary." Retrieved 2013-08-12&lt;/ref&gt; The specific belief of the Orthodox is expressed in their [[Proper (liturgy)|liturgical texts]] used at the feast of the Dormition.&lt;ref name=Menaia/&gt;

===Catholic view===

The Catholic doctrine of the Assumption covers Mary's bodily movement to heaven, but the [[dogma]]tic definition avoids saying whether she was dead or alive at that point. The question had been in dispute in Catholic theology, and although she is normally shown in Catholic art as alive at the point of assumption, many Catholics believe she had died in the normal way. [[Pope Pius XII]] alludes to the fact of her death at least five times, but left open the question of whether or not Mary actually underwent death in connection with her departure, in his [[Apostolic constitution]], ''[[Munificentissimus Deus]]'' (1950), which dogmatically defined [[ex cathedra]] (''i.e.'', infallibly) the [[Dogma of the Assumption|Assumption]].&lt;ref name="PiusXII"&gt;Apostolic Constitution ''[[Munificentissimus Deus]]'' [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_p-xii_apc_19501101_munificentissimus-deus_en.html item 44 at the Vatican web site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904181017/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_p-xii_apc_19501101_munificentissimus-deus_en.html |date=4 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 June 1997 during a General Audience Pope John Paul II stated that Mary experienced natural death prior to her assumption into Heaven, stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is true that in Revelation death is presented as a punishment for sin. However, the fact that the Church proclaims Mary free from original sin by a unique divine privilege does not lead to the conclusion that she also received physical immortality. The Mother is not superior to the Son who underwent death, giving it a new meaning and changing it into a means of salvation. Involved in Christ’s redemptive work and associated in his saving sacrifice, Mary was able to share in his suffering and death for the sake of humanity’s Redemption. What Severus of Antioch says about Christ also applies to her: “Without a preliminary death, how could the Resurrection have taken place?” (Antijulianistica, Beirut 1931, 194f.). To share in Christ’s Resurrection, Mary had first to share in his death. The New Testament provides no information on the circumstances of Mary’s death. This silence leads one to suppose that it happened naturally, with no detail particularly worthy of mention. If this were not the case, how could the information about it have remained hidden from her contemporaries and not have been passed down to us in some way? As to the cause of Mary’s death, the opinions that wish to exclude her from death by natural causes seem groundless. It is more important to look for the Blessed Virgin’s spiritual attitude at the moment of her departure from this world. In this regard, St Francis de Sales maintains that Mary’s death was due to a transport of love. He speaks of a dying “in love, from love and through love”, going so far as to say that the Mother of God died of love for her Son Jesus (Treatise on the Love of God, bk. 7, ch. XIII-XIV). Whatever from the physical point of view was the organic, biological cause of the end of her bodily life, it can be said that for Mary the passage from this life to the next was the full development of grace in glory, so that no death can ever be so fittingly described as a “dormition” as hers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/1997/documents/hf_jp-ii_aud_25061997_en.html |title= General Audience - 25 June 1997, sections 3 and 4 |publisher= Vatican.va |date= 1997-06-25 |accessdate= 2013-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Commonalities===

Both views agree that she was taken up into heaven bodily.&lt;ref name="PiusXII"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Menaia/&gt;

===Other denominations===

The [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic]] observance of the feast corresponds to that of their Orthodox counterparts, whether Eastern Orthodox or Oriental Orthodox.

==Liturgical practices==
Malankara orthodox church which is an oriental orthodox church celebrated feast of dormition on August 15 with great importance as that day is the national independence day of India.

===Byzantine===

It is customary{{why|date=January 2015}} in many places{{where|date=January 2015}} to bless fragrant herbage{{which|date=January 2015}} on the Feast of the Dormition.

In some places,{{where|date=January 2015}} the Rite of the "Burial of the Theotokos" is celebrated at the Dormition, during the [[All-Night Vigil]]. The order of the service is based on the service of the Burial of Christ on [[Holy Saturday|Great Saturday]]. An [[Epitaphios (liturgical)|Epitaphios]] of the Theotokos, a richly embroidered cloth icon portraying her lying in state is used, together with specially composed hymns of lamentation which are sung with [[Psalm 119|Psalm 118]]. Special [[Evlogitaria]] for the Dormition are chanted, echoing the Evlogitaria of the Resurrection chanted at [[matins]] on Sundays throughout the year as well as on [[Lazarus Saturday]] and [[Holy saturday#Eastern practice|Great Saturday]]. This Epitaphios is placed on a bier and carried in procession as is the Epitaphios of Christ on during Great Saturday.

This practice began in [[Jerusalem]], and from there it was carried to [[Russia]], where it was followed in various Dormition Cathedrals, in particular that of [[Dormition Cathedral, Moscow|Moscow]]. The practice slowly spread among the Russian Orthodox, though it is not by any means a standard service in all parishes, or even most cathedrals or monasteries. In Jerusalem, the service is chanted during the Vigil of the Dormition. In some Russian churches and monasteries, it is served on the third day after Dormition.

The Feast of the Dormition has a one-day [[Forefeast]] and 8&lt;ref&gt;On Mount Athos, 16 days&lt;/ref&gt; days of [[Afterfeast]]. The feast is framed and accentuated by three feasts in honour of [[Jesus Christ]], known as the "Three Feasts of the Saviour in August". These are: the [[Procession of the Cross]] (August 1), the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]] (August 6), and the [[Icon]] of Christ "[[Not Made by Hand]]" (August 16).

===Maronite===

The [[Maronite Church]] has a tradition that their Third Anaphora of the Apostle Peter or ''Sharrar'' (the Maronite redaction of the [[Holy Qurbana of Addai and Mari]]) was originally composed for and used at the funeral of the Theotokos. This tradition probably developed because in its final form the anaphora has twelve paragraphs, i.e., one for each concelebrating apostle present at the funeral mass of the Theotokos.

==Depiction in art==
===Orthodox iconography===

One might notice the similarities between the traditional depictions of the Dormition of the Theotokos in Byzantine iconography and the account of the death of the Egyptian Desert Father, [[Sisoes the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stjohndc.org/Russian/saints/e_0107c.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501205740/http://www.stjohndc.org/Russian/saints/e_0107c.htm|date=May 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both Christ is seen coming to receive the soul of the dying saint surrounded by an [[aureola]] or cloud of blinding light and accompanied by the angels and prophets. In Byzantine iconography the other Christs shown surrounded by such a cloud of light are those also seen in icons of the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]], the [[Resurrection]] and the [[Last Judgment]]. One might further note that in some icons of the Dormition the Theotokos is depicted at the top of the icon in a similar aureola before the opening gates of heaven. This suggests that contemporary accounts of the deaths of the Desert Fathers accompanied by sudden burst of light came to influence the development of the iconography of the Dormition.

===Catholic art===

The Dormition is known as the [[Death of the Virgin]] in Catholic art, where it is a reasonably common subject, mostly drawing on Byzantine models, until the end of the [[Middle Ages]]. The ''[[Death of the Virgin (Caravaggio)|Death of the Virgin]]'' by [[Caravaggio]], of 1606, is probably the last famous Western painting of the subject.

The '''''Encyclopédie nouvelle, ou dictionnaire philosophique, scientifique, littéraire et industriel, offrant le tableau des connaissances humaines au XIXe siècle''''' was a [[France|French]] [[encyclopedia]] founded by [[Pierre Leroux]] and [[Jean Reynaud]] and published in installments from 1834 through 1841. It reflected the [[socialist]] philosophy of the founders.

Volume 1 (with an imprint of 1836, though the first installment appeared in 1834) covered A-Ari; volume 2, Ari-Bos; volume 3, Bot-Cons; volume 4, Const-Épic; and volume 8, Sap-Zor. Volumes 5 through 7 were never finished as planned, but materials issued in installments and intended for these volumes were eventually bound together in a miscellaneous volume covering the sequences Episc-Force and Organog-Phil.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1997">'''Expert determination''' is a historically accepted form of [[dispute resolution]] invoked when there is not a ''formulated dispute'' in which the parties have defined positions that need to be subjected to [[arbitration]], but rather both parties are in agreement that there is a need for an evaluation. Expert determination is a procedure by which the parties to a dispute appoint an independent and neutral expert to determine the dispute in private. Like arbitration, it allows trade secrets and other sensitive information to be kept out of the public domain. The expert will be a person with specialist or technical knowledge relevant to the dispute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cms.bwbllp.com/Files/Publications/GuideToExpertDetermination.pdf Bates Wells &amp; Braithewaite's Guide to Expert Determination Advocates for International Development]&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice itself is well established where complex legal institutions either have not developed, or are unavailable, such as tribal societies and criminal organisations.

In the context of modern jurisprudence, the word "expert" appears first in ''Bottomley v Ambler'' 1878 38 LT 545, this was however used ambiguously also referring to arbitrators having the qualification of expert. The first mention that distinguishes specifically against the practise of arbitration, and introduces the formula "''as an expert and not as an arbitrator''" was in ''Dean v. Prince'' 1953 Ch. 590 at 591 (misquoted) and subsequently on appeal in the year 1954 1 Ch. 409 at 415. In [[Contract Law]], the [[party (law)|parties]] are free to include a [[forum selection clause]] appointing a [[special referee]] to resolve specialised but disputed factual issues between them.

'''''Farmers' Almanac''''' is an annual [[North America]]n [[periodical]] that has been in continuous publication since 1818. Published by Geiger of [[Lewiston, Maine]], the ''Farmers' Almanac'' provides long-range [[weather prediction]]s for both the U.S. and Canada, informative and quirky articles, tips, and valuable calendars, and information on everything from the best days to garden, fish, view planets and meteor showers, and take vacations, to full moon dates and lore, and ways to use natural remedies and life hacks for a healthier, less-stressful life. 

Each new year’s edition is released at the end of August of the previous year and contains 16 months of weather predictions broken into 7 zones for the continental US as well as seasonal weather maps for the winter and summer ahead. 

In addition to the U.S. version, there is a Canadian ''Farmers’ Almanac'' and a Promotional Version that is sold to businesses as a marketing and public relations tool.

==History==

Founded in 1818, the ''Farmers’ Almanac'' mixes a blend of long-range weather predictions, humor, fun facts, and  advice on gardening, cooking, fishing, conservation, and other topics.

The ''Farmers’ Almanac'' has had seven editors. Poet, astronomer, and teacher David Young, Philom., held the post for 34 years from the day he and publisher Jacob Mann first founded The Almanac Publishing Company in Morristown, New Jersey. Following Young’s death in 1852, a string of successors took the helm, beginning with astronomer Samuel Hart Wright.

In 1933 Ray Geiger took over as the sixth editor of the ''Farmers’ Almanac'' and began what became the longest-running editorship in ''Farmers’ Almanac'' history.   

In 1994, upon completion of his 60th consecutive edition, Ray passed the editorial reins onto his son, Peter, who had been serving as Associate Editor for 15 years. Peter, who also serves as Executive Vice President of Geiger, hired Sandi Duncan to serve as Managing Editor with him. Sandi was the first woman editor in 178 years to hold an editorial position.

==Weather prediction==
[[File:Farmers 1818.jpg|frame|The first edition of the ''Farmers' Almanac'', from 1818]]
Predictions for each edition are made as far as two years in advance. The U.S. retail edition of the ''Farmers' Almanac'' contains weather predictions for 7 U.S. climatic zones, defined by the publishers, in the continental United States, broken into 3-day intervals. Seasonal maps and summaries for each season are also shared in each new edition, as are forecasts for annual sporting events. Predictions cover 16 months, from the previous September (through December of the publication year).

The ''Farmers' Almanac'' will only state publicly that their method is an “exclusive mathematical and astronomical formula, that relies on sunspot activity, tidal action, planetary position and many other factors." The Almanac's forecaster is referred to by the pseudonym Caleb Weatherbee. According to the publishers, the true identity of the forecaster is kept secret to prevent him or her from being "badgered."

== Accuracy ==
Publishers point to "many longtime Almanac followers claim that their forecasts are 80% to 85% accurate" on their website. Their website also contains a list of the many more “famous” weather predictions they have accurately forewarned of and like to point out that they’ve been predicting the weather longer than the National Weather Service. 

In addition to the popular U.S. version, there is also the Canadian ''Farmers' Almanac'' and a branded promotional version that businesses can personalize and distribute to customers. The total annual distribution of all ''Farmers' Almanac'' editions is more than 2 million copies.

== Online ==
Bringing the wisdom of the ages into the digital age, in 1997 FarmersAlmanac.com was created as a way to share the Almanac’s content digitally. Today it is one of the most popular sites for people of all ages to access long-range weather predictions, and  learn when the best days are to plant your garden, go fishing, find the date of the full moon, or quit a habit. 

== Social Media ==
The ''Farmers’ Almanac’s'' popularity continues to grow digitally. The Almanac has over 1.2 million followers on Facebook, and a strong following on Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest and other social media sites.    

==Notable articles==
Most editions of the ''Farmers' Almanac'' include a "human crusade," advocating for a change in some accepted social practice or [[convention (norm)|custom]]. Previous crusades have included: "How Much Daylight Are We Really Saving," a recommendation for a revised [[Daylight Saving Time]] schedule (2007); "Why is Good Service So Hard to Schedule," recommending that service providers offer more specific timeframes when scheduling home visits (2006); "A Kinder, Gentler Nation," urging readers to exercise more common [[courtesy]] (2003); "Saturday: The Trick to Making Halloween a Real Treat," advocating that the observance of [[Halloween]] be moved to the last Saturday in October (1999); "A Cure for Doctors' Office Delays," demanding more prompt medical service and calling for a "Patients' Bill of Rights" (1996); and "Pennies Make No Sense," which sought to eliminate the [[Cent (United States coin)|penny]], and to permanently replace the [[United States one-dollar bill|dollar bill]] with less costly-to-produce [[Dollar (United States coin)|dollar coin]]s (1989).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.farmersalmanac.com/pennies4profit/pennies-make-no-sense/ |title=

==Popular culture==
{{In popular culture|section|date=January 2017}}
A "farmer's almanac" has been referenced in numerous television shows and movies, including ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|MASH]]'', ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]]'', ''[[Wings (NBC TV series)|Wings]]'', ''[[Cold Case (TV series)|Cold Case]]'', ''[[The Last Starfighter]]'', and ''[[Father of the Bride (1991 film)|Father of the Bride]]''.  Popular culture does not always distinguish between the ''Farmers' Almanac'' and the older ''Old Farmer's Almanac'', so it is not always clear to which publication a particular reference is meant to allude.

Country singer [[Randy Travis]] has a song titled "The Family Bible and ''The Farmer's Almanac''" on his CD ''A Man Ain't Made of Stone''. The song is about his farmer grandfather and what a wise man he was, yet the only two books he owned were the ones told in the title. He got all the life advice he needed from those two books.

Therefore, these fatāwā received relatively little attention until after the August [[1998 United States embassy bombings]], for which bin Laden was indicted.&lt;ref name="indicted"&gt;[http://cns.miis.edu/reports/pdfs/binladen/indict.pdf Copy of indictment] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120906010435/http://cns.miis.edu/reports/pdfs/binladen/indict.pdf |date=September 6, 2012 }} USA v.

==1996 fatwā==
Bin Laden's 1996 fatwā is entitled "Declaration of War against the Americans Occupying the Land of the Two Holy Places". This document is sometimes called the ''Ladenese epistle'', a term derived from bin Laden's surname.&lt;ref name="1996 text"&gt;{{cite web|title=[Text of] Bin Laden’s [1996] Fatwa|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/military-july-dec96-fatwa_1996/|publisher=PBS News Hour|accessdate=14 June 2014|ref=August 23, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a long piece, and complains of American activities in numerous countries. It was faxed to supporters across the world.&lt;ref name="pete"&gt;[[Peter Bergen|Bergen, Peter]], ''[[Holy War, Inc.]]'', 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  It first appeared in the London-based Arabic paper ''[[Al-Quds Al-Arabi]]''.&lt;ref name="1996 text"/&gt;

==1998 fatwā==
The 1998 fatwā&lt;ref name="e1998"/&gt; reached ''Al Quds Al Arabi'' by fax,&lt;ref name="lewis1998"&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/54594/bernard-lewis/license-to-kill-usama-bin-ladins-declaration-of-jihad| title=License to Kill: Usama bin Ladin's Declaration of Jihad|author=Lewis, Bernard|journal=Foreign Affairs|date=November 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was signed by five people, four of whom represented specific Islamist groups:
*Osama bin Laden&lt;ref name="e1998"/&gt;
*[[Ayman al-Zawahiri]],&lt;ref name="e1998"/&gt; "emir of the Jihad Group in Egypt", probably meaning [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad|Islamic Jihad]]
*[[Ahmed Refai Taha]], alias Abu Yasser, of [[al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya]] (in Egypt).&lt;ref name="e1998"/&gt; This endorsement was retracted because of the enormous unpopularity of terrorism in Egypt following the [[Luxor massacre]] of tourists and Egyptians by al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya.  Taha explained his signature to fellow members of the Islamic Group saying he had only been asked over the telephone to join in a statement of support for the Iraqi people.&lt;ref&gt;al-Zayyat, Montasser, ''The Road to al-Qaeda, The Story of Bin Laden's Right-Hand Man'', (University of Michigan Press. 2004. p.89)&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Mir Hamzah]]"&lt;ref name="e1998"/&gt;
*[[Fazul Rahman]], "emir of the Jihad Movement in Bangladesh",&lt;ref name="e1998"/&gt; probably Harakat ul-Jihad-i-Islami/Bangladesh or HUJI-B; HUJI itself is in Pakistan.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The signatories as a group were identified as the "World Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders". This fatwā complains of American military presence in the Arabian Peninsula, the blockade of Iraq and American support for [[Israel]]. It purports to provide religious authorization for indiscriminate killing of Americans and Jews everywhere. It appeared in February 1998 and the embassy bombings followed in August.

===World Islamic Front===
The [[Al-Qaeda|World Islamic Front]] is the organization that issued the World Islamic Front Statement of 23 February 1998, "Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders",&lt;ref name="e1998"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Islamic Front Statement, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 23 February 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.cornell.edu/colldev/mideast/fatw2.htm Original Arabic text] of the fatwa.&lt;/ref&gt; listing the actions of [[United States|Americans]] that they claim conflict with "God's order", and stating that the Front's "ruling to kill the Americans and their allies—civilians and military—is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it."  Terrorism experts consider the "World Islamic Front" synonymous with [[al-Qaeda]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

The [[9/11 Commission]] uses the text of the 23 February 1998 [[fatwa]] as evidence that linked [[Osama bin Laden]], [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], and [[al-Qaeda]] to the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]] in [[New York City]], [[Washington, D.C.]], and near [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania]].

===Effects of the World Islamic Front Statement===
The 23 February 1998 fatwa is the first known official order of the World Islamic Front.  The [[fatwa]] calls upon each individual member of the existing [[Ummah]] to, "in accordance with the words of Almighty God, 'fight the pagans all together as they fight you all together,' and 'fight them until there is no more tumult or oppression, and there prevail justice and faith in God.'"  The fatwa is widely regarded by terrorism experts as the founding document of the World Islamic Front.

The '''Hat and Fragrance Textile Gallery''' is an exhibit space at [[Shelburne Museum]] in [[Shelburne, Vermont]] which houses [[quilt]]s, hatboxes, and various other textiles.
The name "Hat and Fragrance" refers both to [[Electra Havemeyer Webb]]'s collection of hatboxes and to the fragrant, herbal sachets used to preserve textiles. In 1954, Shelburne Museum was the first museum to exhibit quilts as works of art; prior to this exhibition quilts were only shown as accessories in historic houses.

== History ==

Captain Benjamin Harrington built this structure about 1800 in [[Shelburne, Vermont]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heartofthevillage.com/rooms-and-accommodations/&lt;/ref&gt; Harrington, who owned and operated a nearby inn, used the building as a [[Distillation|distillery]] to produce spirits to serve at his inn. The building later served as the Shelburne town barn but, after a period of disuse, the town gave the building to the Museum in 1947 when the Museum moved it to its present site.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Ralph Nading and Lilian Baker Carlisle. The Story of The Shelburne Museum. 1955.&lt;/ref&gt;

Constructed of hand-hewn timbers and rough planks, the Museum used the building as a storage and workshop space for several years while deciding how to renovate it as a textile gallery. Adopting the name “Hat and Fragrance,” which refers to the Museum’s collection of hatboxes and herbal sachets used to preserve early textiles, the Museum paneled the interior walls with maple, birch, and beech veneers in decorative patterns.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shelburnemuseum.org/buildings_and_grounds/detail.php?id=11&lt;/ref&gt; The original structure still maintains this decorative paneling. The museum later built four additional rooms to provide further exhibition space.&lt;ref name="Shelburne Museum 1993"&gt;Shelburne Museum. 1993. Shelburne Museum: A Guide to the Collections. Shelburne: Shelburne Museum, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collection ==
=== Hatboxes and Bandboxes ===

Hatboxes and their smaller relation the [[wikt:bandbox|bandbox]] were made of thin sheets of bent wood or pasteboard and covered with decorative printed papers. Serving as an inexpensive form of luggage for men and women, the boxes carried and stored hats, collars, cuffs, and other finery. Their use increased in the 19th century as new roads, steamboats, and steam locomotives encouraged more people to travel.

[[Shelburne Museum]]’s collection of over two hundred hatboxes and bandboxes is one of the largest and most comprehensive on public display in the country. The collection represents the wide variety of box sizes and forms, paper colors, and designs and is particularly rich in rare, early papers.

Most hat-and-bandbox factories were located in larger cities such as [[New York City|New York]], [[Boston]], [[Philadelphia]], or [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]]. However, many individuals operated small companies to make and sell hatboxes to local markets. One of the best known of these craftspeople is [[Hannah Davis (craftsperson)|Hannah Davis]] (1784–1863) of [[Jaffrey, New Hampshire]], whose work is well represented in the Museum’s collection.

Early boxes were covered with printed and handpainted paper imported from [[England]] and [[Europe]]. Wallpaper from American printers became available in the 19th century and was quickly adopted by hat and bandbox makers.

Patterns and colors for the papers were influenced by current decorating styles. The images of [[classical architecture]], [[griffin]]s, and [[chariot]]s pulled by birds were inspired by the mid-19th century interest in [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] history. Common and exotic creatures such as [[cattle|cow]]s, [[beaver]]s, [[anaconda]]s, and [[giraffe]]s were inspired by zoos, traveling animal exhibitions, illustrated bestiaries, and geography books. Finally, hatbox makers often copied illustrations of American city and rural scenes, historic landmarks, new modes of transportation, or important people and events published in popular books and magazines. Popular papers include the New York City Deaf and Dumb Asylum, a duck hunt, a sidewheel steamboat, President Harrison’s log cabin and a balloon ascension.&lt;ref name="Shelburne Museum 1993"/&gt;

=== Quilts and Bedcoverings ===

[[Embroidery|Embroidered]] bed-rugs and blankets, [[Woven coverlet|coverlet]]s, and [[quilt]]s were a critical necessity in poorly heated early American homes. The making of bedcovers provided women with an important creative outlet and often served as the primary source of decoration in sparsely furnished 17th- and 18th-century homes. As America’s economy grew in the 19th century, the increase in leisure time and the availability of inexpensive factory-woven cloth encouraged thousands of women to embroider, sew, and quilt bedcovers for their families and friends.

[[Shelburne Museum]] was one of the first institutions to collect and exhibit American textiles which possess bold graphic patterns, clarity of line, intense colors, and the imaginative combinations of human figures, animals and vegetation which is often whimsical and out of scale.

The still-growing collection at the Museum is remarkable in its size and quality. Over seven hundred quilts, coverlets, blankets, and bed-rugs from the 18th and 19th century illustrate the different types of bedcovers, the diversity of designs and fabrics, and the many methods of manufacture used by creative men and women. Although the collection predominantly represents New England and the northern states, it also includes examples from the southern and mid-western regions as well as from such distinctive groups as the [[Amish]], [[Pennsylvania Dutch]], and native [[Hawaii]]ans.

Bed-rugs, a traditional northern European bedcover, were brought to America from northern England and widely used until the early 19th century. Now quite rare, these thick, heavy bedcovers were embroidered with handspun and dyed yarns on wool fabric to create a dense pile surface similar to that of an [[Oriental rug]].

Hand-woven blankets, treasured for their warmth and durability, often were embroidered with colorful handspun wool yarns. Women embroidered swirling vine, floral and shell patterns on plain blankets and filled squares of window-pane-checked blankets with stars and flowers.

Single and double coverlets, hand-woven in bold, geometric patterns from the mid-eighteenth to mid-19th centuries were considered more decorative than plain or plaid blankets. While most were woven in blue and white, some weavers chose to emphasize the patterns by combining two or more colors. [[Jacquard loom|Jacquard]] coverlets, introduced in the early 19th century became immediately popular because of their elaborate floral, mosaic, figural, and patriotic patterns. Professional [[weaver (occupation)|weaver]]s advertised them as fancy coverlets to differentiate them from hand-woven coverlets with geometric patterns.

Quilts are made by joining layers of cloth – usually a decorative top, warm filling of either raw wool or cotton, and plain backing – and sewing or “quilting” them together. The method by which the quilt top is made, pieced, [[applique|appliqué]]d, or plain, determines the nature of the design.

The first quilts made in America followed English and European traditions. Early plain whole-cloth quilts were made from lengths of imported, highly glazed, richly colored wool fabric. The stitches used to secure the layers followed decorative swirling vine and floral patterns similar to those used in embroidery or in painted decorations on furniture and walls.

The earliest pieced quilts were made by sewing or “piecing” small geometric pieces of fabric together in simple honeycomb or triangle patterns. As American women perfected the art of quilt making in the early 19th century, they developed more complex patterns often requiring hundreds of thousands of tiny pieces. Geometric star, flower, and figural patterns were pieced together in small blocks and then sewn together to make a quilt top.

The first American appliquéd quilts, made in the 18th century, used the ''broderie perse'', French for [[Persian embroidery]], technique of cutting entire motifs from imported printed fabric, then sewing them on a plain fabric background. 19th-century quilters continued this tradition adding their own twists, they followed patterns printed in ladies’ magazines, copied from a friend, or designed their own.

Occasionally women also stenciled, painted and embroidered fabrics to imitate elaborate quilt of coverlet patterns. Other bedcovers were [[knitting|knit]]ted or [[crochet]]ed in elegant patterns.

== History ==

The roots of [[Gaels|Gaelic]] Nova Scotia are found in the [[Highlands and Islands]] of [[Scotland]] where significant socio-economic changes in the 18th century disrupted a pastoral life-style.  These changes prompted many to emigrate to Nova Scotia.&lt;ref name=settlement&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novascotia.com/en/home/discovernovascotia/history/routestoyourroots/settlementpatterns/scottishsettlement.aspx|title=Acadian, Mi’kmaq, Gaelic, Scottish, African Culture|work=novascotia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the late 18th and early 19th centuries, thousands of [[Scottish people|Scots]] settled in eastern Nova Scotia.  Through a pattern of chain emigration, settlers often chose to create new communities based on family connections, religious or political beliefs.  The settlers faced new hardships such as a vastly different [[climate]], however they persevered and began clearing land, building homes and outbuildings, cultivating their land and establishing new lives and communities.&lt;ref name=settlement/&gt;

==History==
To form a political group in the European Parliament, there needed to be 20 MEPs from six different states (subsequently increased to 25 MEPs from seven states, for the 2009 session&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/elections/article6455650.ece Times OnLine] "No shortage of European bedfellows for BNP," by David Charter (June 8th, 2009 - retrieved on June 10th, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;). The accession of [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]] brought into the European Parliament a number of new far-right MEPs providing sufficient numbers to form a far right group.&lt;ref name="IHT"&gt;{{cite web|last=Brunwasser|first=Matthew|title=Bulgaria and Romania bolster far right profile in EU Parliament|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/01/14/news/right.php|date=2007-01-14|publisher=International Herald Tribune|accessdate=2007-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incentives for forming a group are approximately €1 million in public funds and guaranteed seats on the [[committees of the European Parliament]]. There were concerns in other parties about public funds and influence going towards a group with such an ideology.&lt;ref name="IHT"/&gt; Despite attempts to block the group's formation, it was formed on 15 January 2007.&lt;ref name = "EU Observer"/&gt; However other MEPs successfully blocked ITS from gaining positions on Parliamentary committees, including two vice-presidencies, despite normally being entitled to them.&lt;ref name="DW"&gt;{{cite web|title = Far-Right Wing Group Sidelined in European Parliament|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2335201,00.html|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=2007-02-02|accessdate=2007-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest component was [[National Front (France)|France's National Front]] and its chairman in the Parliament, [[Bruno Gollnisch]], was chair of the ITS group. The National Front had previous allied with other far right groups in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="IHT"/&gt; Following the [[European Parliament election, 2007 (Bulgaria)|Bulgarian European Parliament elections]], the group gained two more Ataka MEPs, [[Slavcho Binev]] and [[Desislav Chukolov]].

The PRM announced on 8 November 2007 that it would withdraw its five members from the group on 12 November 2007 over comments made by [[Alessandra Mussolini]] over the expulsion of Romanian criminals from Italy in early November 2007, thus dooming the parliamentary group to falter less than a year after its creation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eupolitix.com/EN/News/200711/9fc13651-1cb0-4a8c-977e-9529a4e94ce2.htm theparliament.com - Far-right group in EU parliament collapses&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andreas Mölzer]] stated in an interview with ''[[Die Presse]]'' that the group was searching for other MEPs who might join their group to save it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diepresse.com/home/politik/eu/342017/index.do?_vl_backlink=/home/politik/eu/index.do |title="Rechtsaußen-Fraktion" nach Mussolini-Ausbruch vor Ende « |publisher=Diepresse.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other MEPs have already welcomed the prospect of the group's demise&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7086986.stm | work=BBC News | title=EU far-right bloc faces collapse | date=2007-11-09 | accessdate=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Alyn Smith]] MEP stating that it "warms the heart" to watch them arguing amongst themselves.

==Policies==
The group's founding charter has been described as "broadly [[anti-immigration]], anti-[[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|EU constitution]] and anti-[[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|Turkish EU membership]],"&lt;ref name="Watts2008"/&gt;&lt;ref  name = "EU Observer" /&gt; while participants have emphasised that the group will function relatively loosely.  Alessandra Mussolini described it as "more a technical than a political group [...] We are mainly getting together out of necessity.

The Romanian PRM leader stated that he favours a strong association and eventual EU membership for Turkey provided it settles the dispute regarding Cyprus and that the common ground for the new group is based exactly on the values the group's name suggests.&lt;ref&gt;Romanian ''OTV'' channel, January 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''India Office Records''' are a very large collection of documents relating to the administration of [[India]] from 1600 to 1947, the period spanning [[Company rule in India|Company]] and [[British Raj|British rule in India]]. The archive is held in [[London]] by the [[British Library]] and is publicly accessible.

The records come from four main sources: the English and later British [[East India Company]] (1600–1858), the Board of Control (1784–1858), the [[India Office]] (1858–1947), and the [[Burma Office]] (1937–48).  The collection also includes records from many smaller related institutions.  Overall, the collection is made up of approximately 175,000 items, including official publications and records, manuscripts, photographs, printed maps and private papers.  These items take up approximately nine miles of shelving units.

==Historical background==
{{See also|Company rule in India}}
[[File:IndiaPolitical1893ConstablesHandAtlas.jpg|thumb|The British Indian Empire in 1893]]
The historical scope of the records begins in 1600, when the East India Company was granted exclusive rights to trade in much of [[Asia]], including the entire [[Indian subcontinent]].  During its first 100 years, much of the East India Company's energy was involved in maintaining its trade privileges, as it faced competition from domestic and international companies.

Although the East India Company was established as a trading company, it became more and more involved in local affairs in India during the early 18th century, and eventually came to hold large swaths of land in the subcontinent.  In the mid-18th century, the Company began to undertake a governmental role in large parts of India, in order to organize the nascent colony to better facilitate trade.

In an effort to increase its own involvement in the administration of India, the British Government passed [[Pitt's India Act]] in 1784, which established the Board of Control to direct the East India Company in its governing role.

In 1858, in the aftermath of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], the British government abolished the East India Company's right to govern India, and brought the subcontinent directly under the control of the [[British Empire]].  The India Office, under the direction of the [[Secretary of State for India]], was established to maintain administrative control over the increasingly important colony.  In 1937, a separate Burma Office was established to alleviate some of the India Office's administrative burden.

==History of the Records==
[[File:East India House THS 1817 edited.jpg|thumb|[[East India House]] in Leadenhall Street was the London headquarters of the East India Company.]]
The India Office Records themselves have a very interesting history. There were different levels of care for the records over the years, but interest in preserving them was established very early.  A “Keeper” of East India Company records was appointed in 1771, with a mission to arrange current records and to preserve historical records.

Toward the end of the East India Company's governance in India, an increasing number of documents were sent to London and incorporated into the records.  In fact, it was one of the most documented administrations ever.  However, when the control of India was transferred to the India Office, they set up a committee to review the records provided by the East India Company.  On the committee's recommendation, more than 300 tons of records were sold as wastepaper.  Although this was certainly a great loss to the collection, there is evidence that many of these records were duplications, or contained very little relevant information.

The first attempt to arrange and describe the records occurred in 1879, when [[George Christopher Molesworth Birdwood|George Birdwood]] published his ''Report on the old records of the India Office''.

In 1947, the year of Indian independence, ownership of the records transferred to the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] of the [[British government]].  In 1967, the Office decided to move the records to a new facility on [[Blackfriars Road]], where they were merged with the India Office Library.  It was during this transition that the records were transformed into a modern archival collection.  A [[Library classification|classification system]] for the records was determined, most of which is still being used.

In 1982, the entire collection was moved to the British Library.  They are currently a part of the British Library [[Asia, Pacific and Africa Collections]], and they are administered as Public Records, which means that they are available for public consultation in the British Library Reading Rooms.

==Arrangement of the Records==

The classification system for the records was created with two goals: to preserve the original order of the records as much as was possible, and to clarify the administrative history of the records.  Each series of records was assigned a letter, from A to Z, and certain series also have descriptive subclasses.  The classes are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelpregion/asia/india/indiaofficerecords/indiaofficearrangement/indiaofficearrangedrecord.html |title=India Office Records: Arrangement of the Records, and List of Classes |accessdate=30 December 2008 |work=www.bl.uk |publisher=The British Library Board |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genealogical research in the collection==

The collection is useful for [[genealogy|genealogical]] and [[family history]] research, particularly for those who have ancestors who were [[Anglo-Indian]] or who were born or lived in [[British India]].  Recognising this, the British Library has developed resources to facilitate this process, including biographical indexes, professional research services and close links with the [[Families In British India Society]].

The East India Company, the Board of Control and the India Office kept extensive [[Ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] records concerning British people in India.  These records, including documentation of births, [[baptism]]s, marriages, and burials are all contained in the “N” series of the collection.  For those who know the occupation of their ancestor in India, the British Library provides a guide to records produced by various positions, facilitating the discovery of material that an ancestor created in the course of his work for the British administration in India.  Most of these records can be found in the “L” series.

==Materials relating to Gandhi==
{{more footnotes|section|date=December 2008}}

The collection can be used to bolster research on almost any topic involving the history of India from 1600-1947 by providing unique information relating to the British administration's understanding of events.  Perhaps one of the most interesting parts of the collection is the set of records pertaining to [[Mohandas Gandhi]].  Much is known about Gandhi's life and ideas through many sources, but these records provide interesting insight into the development of his ideas, as well as his personal life. Information on the Indian administration's feelings and frustrations concerning Gandhi is also in the records.
[[File:MKGandhi.jpg|thumbnail|&lt;center&gt;Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi&lt;/center&gt;]]
The material relating to Gandhi can be found in folders R/3/1/289-334.  There are two particularly interesting sets of documents in this series.  The first of these are administrative records containing reactions to Gandhi and plans concerning his activities.  Most of these were originally classified as “Most Secret,” “Very Secret,” or “Top Secret.”  (This detail in itself gives insight into the administration's increasing concern with secrecy, as well as their fear of Gandhi and the threat he posed to British authority.)  Many of these records are proposals for responses to Gandhi's actions, including plans to prepare for riots in the event of his death during one of his fasts.

The second set of documents consists of correspondence to and from Gandhi.  Gandhi wrote extensively to various British government officials, and there are 93 letters from Gandhi, as well as 48 letters to Gandhi from the administration personnel.  Many of the letters currently held in the collection are copies from originals, but as the records have been so well-kept in the 20th century, their authenticity is not in question.  The time period of the correspondence is 1922 to 1945.

Many of the letters from Gandhi express criticism of British policies in India and reveal Gandhi's sophisticated analysis of world politics, as well as his commitment to peace.  In many, he appeals to the British to work with him to end the oppression of the Indians.

Perhaps the most unusual of Gandhi's letters in the collection is a copy of a letter sent to [[Adolf Hitler]], in which Gandhi expresses admiration for Hitler's passion for his nation, but urges him to seek non-violent means to address Germany's concerns.  He also refers to some of Hitler's writings as “monstrous,” and makes it clear that he has no interest in seeking German aid for the end of British rule in India.

The most personal of letters from Gandhi in the collection relate to the illness and death of his wife in 1944.  In these letters, one can see Gandhi's frustration at watching [[Kasturba Gandhi]]'s condition worsen as he was powerless to help her.  He repeatedly appealed to the British to send medical aid, including an [[Ayurvedic]] physician, and when it became clear that she would not survive, he lashed out at them, complaining that her treatment was inadequate.

Most of the letters written to Gandhi contained in the collection are accusatory, complaining that Gandhi did not live up to his rhetoric about non-violence.  The letters reflect a belief that Gandhi's fasts and other dramatic forms of protest stirred up violence among the Indian population.  Many of the letters also deny Gandhi's accusations that the British government was involved in systematic repression of the Indian people and failed to live up to its role as a steward of India and the Indian people.

There is also one letter in the collection from [[Franklin Roosevelt]], who was the President of the United States at the time.  In the letter, he acknowledges Gandhi's concerns about India, but suggests that [[World War II]] and the defeat of the [[Axis powers]] should take precedence.  He asks Gandhi to support the British regime so that they will not be forced to divide their attention.

'''Jean Millar Valentine''' (born 1924, [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], [[Scotland]]) was an operator of the [[bombe]] decryption device in Hut 11 at [[Bletchley Park]] in [[England]], designed by [[Alan Turing]] and others during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYNen5muQSE | title=Operating the Bombe: Jean Valentine's story | publisher=[[YouTube]] | author=ComputerHeritage | accessdate=28 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a member of the "Wrens" ([[Women's Royal Naval Service]], WRNS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first=Katy | last=Lewis | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/threecounties/content/articles/2009/05/28/bletchley_park_jean_valentine_feature.shtml | title=Breaking the codes: Former Bletchley Park Wren, Jean Valentine, reveals exactly what went on at the World War II codebreaking centre | publisher=[[BBC]] | work=Beds, Herts &amp; Bucks | date=3 June 2009 | accessdate=28 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was one of a number of women who worked at Bletchley Park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findingada.com/2009/08/the-women-of-bletchley-park/ The Women of Bletchley Park], [http://findingada.com/ Finding Ada], 26 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, she lived in [[Steeple Claydon]] in [[Buckinghamshire]]. She started working on 15 shillings (75 pence) a week. Along with her co-workers, she remained quiet about her war work until the mid-1970s.

More recently, Jean Valentine has been involved with the reconstruction of the bombe at [[Bletchley Park Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/visit/attractions.rhtm What to see at Bletchley Park: Bombe Rebuild Project], Bletchley Park, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; completed in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Ben | last=Fenton | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1528227/Bletchley-hums-again-to-the-Turing-Bombe.html | title=Bletchley hums again to the Turing Bombe | newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] | date=7 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 June 2012, Jean Valentine spoke on her wartime experiences at Bletchley Park and elsewhere as part of a ''Turing's Worlds'' event to celebrate the centenary of the birth of Alan Turing, organized by the [[Oxford University Department for Continuing Education|Department for Continuing Education]]'s [[Rewley House]] at [[Oxford University]] in cooperation with the [[British Society for the History of Mathematics]] (BSHM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Driving Miss Valentine | url=http://diaphania.blogspirit.com/archive/2012/06/24/driving-miss-valentine.html | website=Diaphania.blogspirit.com | publisher=[[Blogspot]] | date=6 July 2012 | accessdate=3 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Jean | last=Valentine | section=A Wren's eye view | pages=125–127 | title=[[The Turing Guide]] | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | date=2017 | isbn=978-0-19-874783-3 | editor-first1=Jack | editor-last1=Copeland | editor-link1=Jack Copeland | editor2=et al. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Valentine mentions during an interview conducted by Joe Miller for the BBC, how moving down to London was a new experience for her, as she had never been out of Scotland up to that point. Valentine worked for eight hours during the day at Bletchley Park and mentioned how no one would ever talk about what they have done or would be doing when outside of Bletchley Park. 
Valentine worked in Hut 11 as has been previously mentioned, recalling how there would be “five machines within the hut, ten girls and one petty officer that would be in charge of the telephone”. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/women-were-key-code-breaking-bletchley-park-180954044/?no-ist|title=Women Were Key to WWII Code-Breaking at Bletchley Park|first=Marissa|last=Fessenden|publisher=|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYNen5muQSE|title=Operating the Bombe: Jean Valentine's story|first=|last=computingheritage|date=14 March 2013|publisher=|accessdate=8 March 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[domain name system]]s, a '''lame delegation''', also known as a '''lame response''', is a type of [[error]] that results when a [[name server]] is designated as the authoritative server for a [[domain name]] for which it does not have authoritative data. 

The [[American Registry for Internet Numbers]] (ARIN) has a Draft Policies and Proposals concerning lame delegations  - Policy 2002-1: Lame Delegations in IN-ADDR.ARPA . See https://www.arin.net/policy/proposals/2002_1.html

==Biography==
Leonard Lauder is the elder son of Joseph and [[Estée Lauder (person)|Estée Lauder]] and the elder brother of [[Ronald Lauder]]. His family is Jewish. He married [[Evelyn Lauder|Evelyn Hausner]] in July 1959.&lt;ref name=NYT1995&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/02/garden/at-work-with-evelyn-lauder-from-pink-lipstick-to-pink-ribbons.html|title=At Work With: Evelyn Lauder; From Pink Lipstick To Pink Ribbons|last=Nemy|first=Enid|date= February 2, 1995|work=The New York Times|access-date= April 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had two sons: [[William P. Lauder|William]], executive chairman of the Estée Lauder Companies, and Gary, managing director of Lauder Partners LLC.&lt;ref name="EL website"/&gt;

He is a graduate of the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]], and he also studied at [[Columbia Business School|Columbia University's Graduate School of Business]] before serving as a lieutenant in the [[U.S. Navy]]. He formally joined Estée Lauder in 1958 when he was 25.&lt;ref name="EL website"/&gt;

Lauder gained notoriety in 2001 for creating the [[Lipstick index]], a since discredited [[economic indicator]].[6]

On January 1, 2015, he married photographer Judy Ellis Glickman.

For many years, he has lived in an [[Upper East Side]] penthouse in Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;Rosman, Katherine (April 29, 2015). [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/30/fashion/beginning-again-the-love-story-of-leonard-lauder-and-judy-glickman.html?_r=0 "Beginning Again: The Love Story of Leonard Lauder and Judy Glickman"].  ''[[The New York Times]]''. Retrieved June 22, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
===Arts and culture===
Lauder is a major art collector (he began by buying [[Art Deco]] postcards when he was six), but his particular focus, rather than on American artists, is on works by the [[Cubism|Cubist]] masters [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], [[Georges Braque|Braque]], [[Juan Gris|Gris]], and [[Fernand Léger|Léger]]. He also collects [[Gustav Klimt|Klimt]]. Much of his art comes from some of the world's most celebrated collections, including those of [[Gertrude Stein]], the Swiss banker [[Raoul La Roche]], and the British art historian [[Douglas Cooper (art historian)|Douglas Cooper]].&lt;ref name="MetCubism"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/10/arts/design/leonard-lauder-is-giving-his-cubist-collection-to-the-met.html|title=Cubism, Which Changed Art, Now Changes the Met|last=Vogel|first=Carol|date= April 9, 2013|work=The New York Times|access-date= April 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In autumn, 2012, the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] opened an exhibition of 700 of his postcards, a tiny part of the promised gift he has made to the museum of 120,000 postcards: ''The Postcard Age: Selections from the Leonard A. Lauder Collection''. In an interview in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', Lauder explained how postcards turned him into a collector, and how these "mini-masterpieces" remained his lifelong pursuit to the point where his late wife, Evelyn, called the collection his "mistress".&lt;ref name="NewYorker"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2012/10/the-pleasures-of-postcards.html|title=Leonard Lauder's Postcard Collection at the Museum of Fine Arts : The New Yorker|last=Dobrzynski|first=Judith H.|date= October 25, 2012|work=[[The New Yorker]]|access-date= April 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lauder's interest in postcards led him to be acquainted with one of the owners of the [[Gotham Book Mart]], a Manhattan bookstore, and he sought to help the Gotham re-establish its presence in the city when the owner had sold its long-time building and needed a new space. Lauder bought a building at 16 East [[List of numbered streets in Manhattan|46th Street]] along with a partner, letting the building's storefront space to the Gotham. Later, the Gotham fell behind on rents, eventually resulting in Lauder and his partner to file for eviction. In a much-publicized closure of the bookstore, the [[New York City Marshal]] later auctioned the store's inventory, which was bought in a lot by Lauder and his partner to some protest from many other independent book sellers and collectors who were present at the proceedings and hoping to purchase some of the bibliophilic treasures.&lt;ref name="Gotham"&gt;{{Cite news

Lauder has long been a major benefactor of the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]]. In 1971, he joined the museum's acquisitions board and in 1977, by then president of his family's business, he became a Whitney trustee.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Pogrebin and Timothy L. O'Brien (December 5, 2004). [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/05/arts/design/05pogr.html "A Museum of One's Own"]. ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; He became president in 1990&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;Grace Glueck (June 14, 1990). [https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/14/arts/leonard-lauder-to-head-whitney-museum-board.html "Leonard Lauder to Head Whitney Museum Board"]. ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been chairman since 1994. He has donated both money and many works of art to the Whitney, and is the museum's most prolific fundraiser. His 2008 donation to it of $131 million is the largest in the museum's history.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/profile/leonard-lauder/ "Profile: Leonard Lauder"]. ''[[Forbes]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the Leonard and Evelyn Lauder Fund, he and his wife have also sponsored several exhibitions at the Whitney.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; The fifth-floor permanent collection galleries are named for the couple. In 1998, he told a reporter for ''The New York Times'' that his "dream job" was to be the Whitney Museum's director. Most recently, Lauder gave $131 million for the Whitney's endowment.

A long-time supporter of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City, Lauder led the creation of a research center for Modern art at the museum, which he helped support through a $22 million endowment made alongside museum trustees and other benefactors. In April 2013, he promised his collection of 81 pieces of [[Cubist]] art,&lt;ref name="The Met" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/12/arts/design/a-met-exhibition-spotlights-a-lauder-trove-of-cubism.html "A Collector's Personal Perspective, A Met Exhibition Spotlights a Lauder Trove of Cubism"]. ''The New York Times''. October 10, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of 34 pieces by [[Pablo Picasso]], 17 by [[Georges Braque]], 15 by [[Fernand Léger]], and 15 by [[Juan Gris]] to the museum; together, they are valued at more than one billion dollars.&lt;ref name="MetCubism"/&gt; It has been described by [[William Acquavella]], of [[Acquavella Galleries]], as "without doubt the most important collection any private person has put together in many, many years,"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21583610-cosmetics-mogul-makes-influential-gift-metropolitan-museum-art-focus "Leonard Lauder's art collection: Focus, focus, focus"].  ''[[The Economist]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social causes===
Lauder is co-founder and chairman of the [[Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation]], a member of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], a trustee of the [[Aspen Institute]], chairman of The Aspen Institute International Committee, and a member of the President's Council of [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elcompanies.com/Pages/The-Lauder-Family.aspx The Family] Estée Lauder Companies.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with his wife, Evelyn, he helped create the Evelyn H Lauder Breast Center at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Vanessa Friedman (December 23, 2010).

Some of those works (such as Wyeth 1901&lt;ref name="Wyeth_1901"/&gt;) are so comprehensive that their entire content cannot be reproduced here. This list includes all that are frequently encountered in today's [[health care]] in [[English-speaking world|English-speaking]] regions.

Some of these are obsolete (such as the [[apothecaries' system|apothecaries' units]]); others remain current.

Abbreviations which are [[deprecation|deprecated]] by the [[Joint Commission]] are marked in red. Those abbreviations which are deprecated by other organizations, such as the [[Patient safety organization#Institute for Safe Medication Practices|Institute for Safe Medication Practices]] (ISMP) and the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA), are marked in orange.

The Joint Commission is an independent, non-profit, non-governmental organization which offers [[accreditation]] to hospitals and other health care organizations in the United States. While their recommendations are not binding on U.S. physicians, they are required of organizations who wish accreditation by the Joint Commission.

==Similarity of handwritten letters==
Especially in handwritten prescriptions or orders, and most especially in hasty handwriting (which is the usual kind), letter shape can be ambiguous. The example below compares "a" and "o" in a script where both consist of an incoming stroke, a loop from about 12 o'clock, and an outgoing stroke. They differ only in the angle of the latter.

&lt;div style="float:left;"&gt;

{{cursive script|a}}

{{cursive script|o}}

&lt;/div&gt;

{{clear}}

==Numerical notation==
When expressing a numerical quantity, [[Roman numerals]] are commonly used in place of arabic digits so as to avoid confusion.{{clarify|date=February 2017}}&lt;!-- How is that less confusing?  Is there a source which verifies this is the reason?? --&gt;  The numbers 1 - 3 (I, II, III), usually written as upper-case Roman numerals, often have the appearance of a capital "T" or a series of capital "T's" with a dot above each "T."  They are also sometimes written as lower-case Roman numerals (i, ii, iii).

==Currently discouraged practices==
* Abbreviating names of [[drugs]]
* Using [[Apothecaries' system|apothecary's units]]
* Using [[trailing zero]]s or not using a [[leading zero]]

'''Mehmed VI''' ({{lang-ota|محمد السادس}} ''Meḥmed-i sâdis'', {{lang|ota-Arab|وحيد الدين}} ''Vahideddin'', {{lang-tr|Vahideddin}} or {{lang|tr|Altıncı Mehmet}}), who is also known as ''Şahbaba'' (meaning "Emperor-father") among his relatives, (14 January 1861 – 16 May 1926) was the 36th and last Sultan of the [[Ottoman Empire]], reigning from 1918 to 1922. The brother of [[Mehmed V]], he became heir to the throne after the 1916 suicide of [[Abdülaziz]]'s son [[Şehzade Yusuf Izzeddin]] as the eldest male member of the [[House of Osman]]. He acceded to the throne after the death of Mehmed V.&lt;ref&gt;Freely, John, ''Inside the Seraglio'', 1999, Chapter 16: The Year of Three Sultans.&lt;/ref&gt; He was girded with the [[Sword of Osman]] on 4 July 1918, as the thirty-sixth ''[[padishah]]''. His father was Sultan [[Abdulmejid I]] and mother was [[Gülüstü Hanım]] (1830 – 1865), an ethnic [[Abkhaz people|Abkhazian]], daughter of Prince Tahir Bey Çaçba and his wife Afişe Lakerba, originally named Fatma Çaçba.&lt;ref name="Harun"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harun Açba|title=Kadın efendiler: 1839-1924|url=https://books.google.com/books?gA0nNAAACAAJ|year=2007|publisher=Profil|isbn=978-9-759-96109-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mehmed was removed from the throne when the [[Abolition of the Ottoman Sultanate|Ottoman sultanate was abolished]] in 1922.

==Biography==
Mehmed VI was born at the [[Dolmabahçe Palace]], in [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Encyclopædia Britannica|volume=7|editor-first=Hugh|editor-last=Chisholm|year=1911|number=3|quote=Constantinople, the capital of the Turkish Empire}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9368294/Istanbul Britannica, Istanbul]:''When the Republic of Turkey was founded in 1923, the capital was moved to Ankara, and Constantinople was officially renamed Istanbul in 1930.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reign===
The [[World War I|First World War]] was a disaster for the Ottoman Empire. British and allied forces had conquered [[Baghdad]], [[Damascus]], and [[Jerusalem]] during the war and most of the Ottoman Empire was divided amongst the European allies. At the [[San Remo conference]] of April 1920, the [[France|French]] were granted a mandate over [[Syria]] and the [[United Kingdom|British]] were granted one over [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Mesopotamia]]. On 10 August 1920, Mehmed's representatives signed the [[Treaty of Sèvres]], which recognised the mandates and recognised [[Kingdom of Hejaz|Hejaz]] as an independent state.

Turkish nationalists rejected the settlement by the Sultan's four signatories. A new government, the [[Turkish Grand National Assembly]], under the leadership of [[Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal (Atatürk)]] was formed on 23 April 1920, in [[Ankara]] (then known as Angora). The new government denounced the rule of Mehmed VI and the command of [[Süleyman Şefik Pasha]] who was in charge of the army commissioned to fight the civil war for the empire (the [[Kuva-yi Inzibatiye|Kuvâ-i İnzibâtiyye]]), as a result a temporary constitution was drafted.

===Exile and death===
The Grand National Assembly of Turkey abolished the [[Sultanate]] on 1 November 1922, and Mehmed VI was expelled from Constantinople. Leaving aboard the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[warship]] [[HMS Malaya|''Malaya'']] on 17 November, he went into exile in [[Malta]]; Mehmed later lived on the [[Italian Riviera]].

On 19 November 1922, Mehmed's first cousin and heir Abdulmejid Efendi was elected [[Caliph]], becoming the new head of the Imperial House of Osman as [[Abdulmejid II]] before the [[Caliphate]] was abolished by the Turkish Grand National Assembly in 1924.

Mehmed died on 16 May 1926 in [[Sanremo]], [[Italy]], and was buried at the [[Tekkiye Mosque]] of Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] in Damascus.&lt;ref&gt;Freely, John, ''Inside the Seraglio'', published 1999, Chapter 19: The Gathering Place of the Jinns&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Monty Python's The Meaning of Life''''', also known simply as '''''The Meaning of Life''''', is a 1983 British [[Musical film|musical]] [[sketch comedy]] film written and performed by the [[Monty Python]] troupe, directed by [[Terry Jones]]. It was the last film to feature all six Python members before [[Graham Chapman]]'s death in 1989.

Unlike ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail|Holy Grail]]'' and ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian|Life of Brian]]'', the film's two predecessors, which each told a single, more-or-less coherent story,&lt;ref name="guard2013"/&gt; ''The Meaning of Life'' returned to the sketch format of the troupe's [[Monty Python's Flying Circus|original television series]] and their first film from twelve years earlier, ''[[And Now for Something Completely Different]]'', loosely structured as a series of comic sketches about the various stages of life. It was accompanied by the [[short film]] ''[[The Crimson Permanent Assurance]]''.

Released on 23 June 1983 in the United Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;McCall, Douglas (2013-11-12). Monty Python: A Chronology, 1969-2012, 2d ed. p97. McFarland. {{ISBN|9780786478118}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Meaning of Life'', although not as acclaimed as its predecessors, was still well received critically and was a minor box office success, grossing almost $15 million on a $9 million budget. It also screened at the [[1983 Cannes Film Festival]], where it won the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix]]. The film appears in a 2010 list of the top 20 [[cult films]] published by ''The Boston Globe''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/gallery/top_cult_films?pg=2 |title=Top 20 cult films, according to our readers |author=Boston.com Staff |publisher=The Boston Globe |work=boston.com |accessdate=1 February 2016 |date=27 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
A group of fish in a posh restaurant's [[fish tank|tank]] swim together casually, until they look at the customers outside of the tank and see their friend Howard being eaten. This leads them to question the [[meaning of life]]. The question is explored in the first sketch, "The Miracle of Birth", which features a woman in labour being ignored by the doctors in favour of impressing the hospital's administrator. In [[Yorkshire]], a [[Catholic Church in the United Kingdom|Roman Catholic]] man loses his job and returns home to tell his numerous children that he will have to sell them off for scientific experiments due to the Catholic church's [[Christian views on contraception|opposition to contraception]]; this leads to the musical number "[[Every Sperm is Sacred]]". Meanwhile, a [[Protestantism in the United Kingdom|Protestant]] man and his wife discuss having non-reproductive sex.

In "Growth and Learning", a class of boys are taught school etiquette and then watch their teacher have sex with his wife as part of their [[sex education]]. One boy laughs, and is forced into a violent [[rugby football|rugby]] match against the higher grades as punishment. "Fighting Each Other" first focuses on a [[World War I]] officer trying to rally his men to find cover during an attack, but they insist on throwing him a going away party; then, an army [[Regimental sergeant major|RSM]] attempts to drill his platoon but ends up excusing them all to pursue leisure activities. In 1879, during the [[Anglo-Zulu War]], a soldier finds his leg has been bitten off. Suspecting a [[tiger]], despite being in Africa, the soldiers hunt for it and find two men suspiciously wearing two halves of a tiger costume.

"The Middle of the Film" briefly introduces a segment called "Find the Fish", a surreal scene where bizarre characters ask the audience to find a fish hidden in the sequence. "Middle Age" involves a middle-aged American couple visiting a dungeon-themed [[Cuisine of Hawaii|Hawaiian]] restaurant, where, to the interest of the fish, the waiter offers a conversation about philosophy and the meaning of life. The customers are unable to make sense of it and move on to a discussion of "live organ transplants". "Live Organ Transplants" involves two [[paramedic]]s visiting Mr. Brown, a card-carrying [[organ donor]], forcefully removing his [[liver]] whilst he is still alive. Brown's wife speaks with a musician who performs "[[Galaxy Song]]" while discussing man's insignificance in the universe. The Crimson Permanent Assurance pirates invade a corporate boardroom where executives are discussing the meaning of life, but a tumbling skyscraper ends their assault.

In "The Autumn Years", the horribly obese [[Mr. Creosote]] visits a French restaurant, to the horror of the fish tank. He vomits continuously and devours an enormous meal. When the [[maître d']] gives him a wafer-thin mint, Creosote's stomach begins to rapidly expand until it explodes, the maître d' then giving him the bill. Two staff members clean up Creosote's remains while discussing the meaning of life. One leads the audience to his house, spouts some philosophy, and then angrily dismisses them.

"Death" features a condemned man choosing the manner of his own execution: being chased off a cliff by topless women and falling into his own grave below. The [[Grim Reaper]] thereupon enters an isolated country house and invites himself to dinner. The guests try to guess who he is until the Reaper tells them they all died from food poisoning. They accompany the Grim Reaper to [[Heaven]], depicted as a [[Las Vegas]]-style hotel in perpetual [[Christmas]], where a [[Tony Bennett]]-lookalike performs "Christmas in Heaven" to the cast.

"The End of the Film" epilogue features the host of "The Middle of the Film" being handed an envelope containing the meaning of life. She reads it out: "Try and be nice to people, avoid eating fat, read a good book every now and then, get some walking in, and try and live together in peace and harmony with people of all creeds and nations".

==Production==
According to Palin, "the writing process was quite cumbersome. An awful lot of material didn't get used. ''Holy Grail'' had a structure, a loose one: the search for the grail. Same with ''Life of Brian''. With this, it wasn't so clear. In the end, we just said: 'Well, what the heck. We have got lots of good material, let's give it the loosest structure, which will be the meaning of life'".&lt;ref name="guard2013" /&gt;

After the film's title was chosen, [[Douglas Adams]] called Jones to tell him he had just finished a new book, to be called ''[[The Meaning of Liff]]''; Jones was initially concerned about the similarity in titles, which led to the scene in the [[title sequence]] of a tombstone which, when hit by a flash of lightning, changes from "The Meaning of Liff" to "The Meaning of Life".&lt;ref name="guard2013" /&gt;

Principal photography began on July 12, 1982 and was completed about two months later, on September 11.  A wide variety of locations were used, such as [[Porchester Hall]] in [[Queensway, London|Queensway]] for the Mr. Creosote sketch, where hundreds of pounds of fake vomit had to be cleaned up on the last day due to a wedding being scheduled hours later. The [[Malham Moors]] were chosen for the Grim Reaper segment; the countryside near [[Strathblane]] was used for the Zulu War; and "Every Sperm Is Sacred" was shot in [[Colne]], [[Lancashire]] with interiors done at [[Elstree Studios]].

The film was produced on a budget of less than US$10 million, which was still bigger than that of the earlier films. This allowed for large-scale choreography and crowd sequences, a more lavishly produced soundtrack that included new original songs, and much more time able to be spent on each sketch, especially ''The Crimson Permanent Assurance''. Palin later said that the larger budget, and not making the film for the [[BBC]] (i.e., television), allowed the film to be more daring and dark.&lt;ref name="guard2013" /&gt;

The idea for the hospital sketch came from Chapman, himself a physician,&lt;ref name=split&gt;{{cite web|url=http://splitsider.com/2013/09/dick-cavetts-semi-serious-talk-with-graham-chapman/|title=Dick Cavett’s Semi-Serious Talk with Graham Chapman|last=Ess|first=Ramsey|date=September 20, 2013|work=Splitsider|publisher=[[The Awl]]|accessdate=September 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had noticed that hospitals were changing, with "lots and lots of machinery".&lt;ref name="guard2013" /&gt; According to Palin, the organ transplant scene harked back to Python's love of bureaucracy, and sketches with lots of people coming round from the council with different bits of paper.&lt;ref name="guard2013" /&gt;

During the filming of the scene where Palin's character explains Catholicism to his children, his line was "that rubber thing at the end of my ''sock''", which was later overdubbed with ''cock''.&lt;ref name="guard2013" /&gt;

===''The Crimson Permanent Assurance''===
{{main|The Crimson Permanent Assurance}}
The [[short film]] ''[[The Crimson Permanent Assurance]]'' introduces the feature. It is about a group of elderly office clerks working in a small [[accounting]] firm. They rebel against [[yuppie]] corporate masters, transform their office building into a [[pirate ship]], and raid a large financial district. One of the boardrooms raided reappears later in the film, from shortly before the attack begins until the narrator apologises and a skyscraper falls and crushes the marauders.

The short was intended as an [[animation|animated]] sequence in the feature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hunter |first1=I.

==Release==
The original [[tagline]] read "It took God six days to create the Heavens and the Earth, and Monty Python just 90 minutes to screw it up"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Birkinshaw |first1=Julian |last2=Ridderstråle  |first2=Jonas |year=2017 |chapter=Linking Strategy Back to Purpose |title=Fast/Forward: Make Your Company Fit for the Future |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=1503602311}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the length of ''The Meaning of Life'' proper is 90 minutes, but becomes 107 minutes as released with  the "Short Subject Presentation", ''The Crimson Permanent Assurance''). In an April 2012 re-release held by the [[American Film Institute]], the tagline is altered to read "It took God six days to create the Heavens and the Earth, and Monty Python just 1 hour and 48 minutes to screw it up".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afi.com/silver/films/2012/v9i2/montypython.aspx |title=Monty Python at the Movies |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |accessdate=22 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ireland banned the film on its original release as it had previously done with ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'', but later rated it [[Irish Film Censor's Office|15]] when it was released on video. In the United Kingdom the film was rated [[18 (British Board of Film Classification)|18]] when released in the cinema&lt;ref name="BBFC"/&gt; and on its first release on video, but was re-rated [[British Board of Film Classification|15]] in 2000.

===Critical reception===
[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film 2 and a half stars out of four, calling it a "a barbed, uncompromising attack on generally observed community standards".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ebert|first1=Roger|title=Monty Python's The Meaning of Life Movie Review (1983),|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/monty-pythons-meaning-of-life-1983|publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|accessdate=22 February 2016|date=1 April 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Vincent Canby]] declared it "the ''[[Ben Hur (1959 film)|Ben Hur]]'' of sketch films, which is to say that it's a tiny bit out of proportion", concluding it was amusing, but he wished it were consistently amusing.&lt;ref name="Canby"&gt;{{cite web|last=Canby |first=Vincent |title=MONTY PYTHON, 'THE MEANING OF LIFE' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F03E4D7123BF932A05750C0A965948260 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=20 July 2017 |date=31 March 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' staff assessed it as disgusting, ridiculous, tactless, but above all, amusing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff |first= |title=Review: Monty Python's The Meaning of Life |url=https://variety.com/1982/film/reviews/monty-python-s-the-meaning-of-life-1200425486/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=20 July 2017 |date=31 December 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' awarded 3 stars out of 4, calling it "fresh and original and delightfully offensive. What more can you ask of a comedy?"&lt;ref&gt;[[Gene Siskel|Siskel, Gene]] (April 1, 1983). "Python 'Meaning of Life' tingles with high-voltage shocks". ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. Section 3, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Sheila Benson of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that the film was full of "raunchy talk, blasphemy (well, sacrilege) and one example of what kids call a totally ''gnarly,'' gross-out scene. The problem for the reviewer (to be specific, this reviewer) is when you are laughing this much it makes logging all the fast-flying offenses almost impossible."&lt;ref&gt;Benson, Sheila (March 31, 1983). "Python's 'Life' Raunchy But Funny". ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Calendar, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Gary Arnold of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' was negative, writing that "The strongest impressions left by this picture have less to do with its largely tedious attempts to burlesque human weakness and pomposity than with the group's failure to evolve a coherent satiric outlook."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Arnold |first=Gary |date=April 4, 1983 |title='Life' Without Meaning |url= |journal=[[The Washington Post]] |page=B1, B2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A review by Steve Jenkins in ''[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' was also negative, writing that the return to a sketch format constituted a "great leap backwards" for the troupe and that the film's outrageous moments "cannot disguise the overall air of ''déjà vu'' and playing it safe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jenkins |first=Steve |date=June 1983 |title=Monty Python's Meaning of Life |url= |journal=[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]] |volume=50 |issue=593 |page=163 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]''{{'}}s Ian Nathan rated it three of five stars, describing it as "too piecemeal and unfocused, but it possesses some of their most iconic musings and inspired madness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nathan |first=Ian |title=Monty Python's The Meaning of Life Review |url=http://www.empireonline.com/movies/monty-pythons-meaning-life/review/ |work=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] |accessdate=20 July 2017 |date=1 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' gave the film four stars out of five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chilton|first1=Martin|title=Monty Python's The Meaning of Life, review|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmreviews/10765951/Monty-Pythons-The-Meaning-of-Life-review.html|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=22 February 2016|date=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''2015 Movie Guide'', [[Leonard Maltin]] awarded it three stars, calling it "A barrel of bellylaughs", identifying the [[Mr. Creosote]] and "[[Every Sperm is Sacred]]" sketches as the most memorable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Maltin |first=Leonard |year=2014 |title=Leonard Maltin's 2015 Movie Guide |publisher=Penguin |isbn=0698183614}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a rating of 85%, based on 33 reviews, with an [[Weighted mean|average rating]] of 7.3/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/monty_pythons_the_meaning_of_life/ | title=Monty Python's The Meaning of Life | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher=[[Flixster]] | accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accolades===
''The Meaning of Life'' was awarded the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Jury Prize]] at the [[1983 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/1432/year/1983.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Monty Python's The Meaning of Life |accessdate=16 June 2009|work=festival-cannes.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121185217/http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/1432/year/1983.html |archivedate=12 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Cannes jury, led by [[William Styron]], were fiercely split on their opinions on several films in competition, ''The Meaning of Life'' had general support, securing it the second-highest honour after the [[Palme d'Or]] for ''[[The Ballad of Narayama (1983 film)|The Ballad of Narayama]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dionne |first1=E.J., Jr. |title=JAPANESE FILM AWARDED TOP PRIZE AT CANNES |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/20/movies/japanese-film-awarded-top-prize-at-cannes.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=20 May 1983 |accessdate=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the [[37th British Academy Film Awards]], Andre Jacquemin, Dave Howman, Michael Palin and Terry Jones were also nominated for Original Song for "[[Every Sperm is Sacred]]."

'''Mozilla Sunbird''' is a discontinued [[free and open-source software|free and open-source]], [[cross-platform]] [[calendaring software|calendar application]] that was developed by the [[Mozilla Foundation]], [[Sun Microsystems]] and many volunteers.&lt;ref name="volunteerlist"&gt;[https://www.mozilla.org/credits/ Mozilla contributors list], ''Mozilla.org''&lt;/ref&gt; Mozilla Sunbird was described as "...&amp;nbsp;a cross platform standalone calendar application based on Mozilla's [[XUL]] user interface language."&lt;ref name="mainsunbirdpage"&gt;[https://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/sunbird/index.html The Sunbird Project - Standalone Calendar] - Main project page describing the project.&lt;/ref&gt; Announced in July 2003,&lt;ref name="sunbirdAnnounced"&gt;[http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=3432 Mozilla Sunbird Standalone Calendar Project Launches - MozillaZine Talkback] - MozillaZine article announcing the Sunbird Project&lt;/ref&gt; Sunbird was a standalone version of the [[Mozilla Calendar Project]].

It was developed as a standalone version of the [[Lightning (software)|Lightning]] calendar and scheduling extension for the [[Mozilla Thunderbird]] and [[SeaMonkey]] mail clients. Development of Sunbird was ended with release 1.0 beta 1 to focus on development of [[Lightning (software)|Mozilla Lightning]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/releases/sunbird1.0b1.html Sunbird 1.0 beta1 Release Notes]: "This is the last public Sunbird release by the Calendar Project." . Retrieved 2010-04-01.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/calendar/2009/02/calendar_project_at_a_critical.html Calendar Project at a critical juncture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126024401/http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/calendar/2009/02/calendar_project_at_a_critical.html |date=2010-01-26 }}, Calendar Weblog. Retrieved 2010-04-01.&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2017}}, the “latest development version” of Sunbird was still 1.0b1 from January 2010, and no later version has been announced. Unlike Lightning, Sunbird does not receive updates to its time zones database anymore.

==Sun contributions==
Sun Microsystems contributed significantly to the Lightning extension project to provide users with a free and open-source alternative to [[Microsoft Office]] by combining [[OpenOffice.org]] and Thunderbird/Lightning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Paquet |first=Simon |url=http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/calendar/2006/10/sun_microsystems_announces_int.html |title=Calendar Weblog |publisher=Weblogs.mozillazine.org |date=2006-10-05 |accessdate=2010-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212170048/http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/calendar/2006/10/sun_microsystems_announces_int.html |archivedate=2010-02-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sun's key focus areas in addition to general bug fixing were calendar views, team/collaboration features and support for the [[Sun Java System Calendar Server]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openoffice.org/editorial/mozilla_lightning_and_OOo.html |title=Interview On Mozilla Lighting and |publisher=Openoffice.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since both projects share the same code base, any contribution to one of them is a direct contribution to the other.

==Trademark issues and Iceowl==
{{Main|Mozilla Corporation software rebranded by the Debian project}}
Although it is released under a [[Mozilla Public License|MPL]], MPL/[[GNU General Public License|GPL]]/[[LGPL]] tri-license, there are trademark restrictions in place on Mozilla Sunbird which prevent the distribution of modified versions with the Mozilla branding.

As a result, the [[Debian]] project created [[Iceowl]], a virtually identical version without the branding restrictions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5570">[[Image:SchlosstheaterCharlottenburg.jpg|thumb|250px|Former home of the Museum für Vor- und Frühgeschichte in Charlottenburg]]
The '''Museum für Vor- und Frühgeschichte''' (''"Museum for prehistory and early history"''), part of the [[Berlin State Museums]], is one of major [[archaeology|archaeological]] museums of [[Germany]], and among the largest supra-regional collections of [[prehistory|prehistoric]] finds in [[Europe]]. It was previously located in the former theatre building by [[Carl Ferdinand Langhans]], next to [[Schloss Charlottenburg]], and encompasses six exhibition halls on three floors. Since October 2009, the museum's exhibitions are now displayed in the [[Neues Museum]] on [[Museum Island]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smb.museum/smb/sammlungen/details.php?lang=en&amp;objID=15&amp;p=1&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from  a permanent exhibition, it regularly houses temporary exhibits. Attached to the museum is a specialised library on prehistoric [[archaeology]] with over 50,000 volumes. Furthermore, the museum houses the ''Commission for the exploration of archaeological collections and documents from northeast Central Europe'', a project for the study of [[ancient Egypt]]ian calendars, and a number of other bodies.

== History ==

The collection goes back to the [[Cabinet of curiosities]] and later art collection of the [[Hohenzollern]] who assembled an initial collection of ancient finds from 1830 onwards in [[Schloss Monbijou]] under the name "Museum Vaterländischer Altertümer" (''Museum of National Antiquities''). Later, the collection moved first to the [[Neues Museum]], then, in 1886, to the Ethnographic Museum (Prinz-Albrecht-Strasse) and in 1921 into the [[Martin Gropius Bau|Martin-Gropius-Bau]], where it was renamed "Staatliches Museum für Vor- und Frühgeschichte" in 1931. The museum's financial supporters and contributors of material included [[Rudolf Virchow]] and [[Heinrich Schliemann]]. 

After [[World War II]], parts of the collections were confiscated by the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.n-tv.de/773873.html n-tv:Merowinger-Schau: Beutekust in Moskau]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-9181196.html ''Beutekunst: Zurück in die Kindheit''], spiegel.de, 3. April 1995 &lt;/ref&gt;


The Museum moved to Schloss Charlottenburg (then [[West Berlin]]) in 1960. After [[German reunification]], the collection of the [[East Berlin]] "Museum für Vor- und Frühgeschichte " was incorporated.

== Exhibition halls ==
The museum visit takes the form of a circuit walk. It includes the following rooms:

=== Rudolf-Virchow-Studio ===
The Rudolf-Virchow-Studio (Room 1) contains an overview of the technological history of the [[Stone Age]], [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age]].It also contains PCs with interactive displays and a lecture hall.

=== Schliemann-Saal ===

The '''National Union Catalog''' (NUC) is a printed [[library catalog|catalog]] of books catalogued by the [[Library of Congress]] and other American and Canadian libraries, issued serially beginning in the 1950s. It is not related to the [[NUCMC|National Union Catalog of Manuscript Collections]] (NUCMC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/coll/nucmc/newfaqs.html#14 |title=14. Is NUCMC the same as NUC? |work=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=National Union Catalog of Manuscript Collections (NUCMC), Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Union Catalog of Pre-1956 Imprints, a set of 754 volumes, largely superseded the older Library of Congress Catalog of printed books, and included printed works published before 1956 which are held by major American and Canadian [[library|libraries]]. It is sometimes referred to as ''the Mansell'', after its publisher.  This set is a massive [[bibliography]] compiled during the period from 1968 to 1981. It contains photocopies of printed catalog cards from major American and Canadian libraries, arranged alphabetically by author's last name, or by title for books that have no author, such as the [[Bible]].

The NUC of Pre-1956 Imprints was an important resource for verifying bibliographic information and finding copies of books before the advent of large electronic bibliographic databases, such as [[WorldCat]]; the massive size and weight of the set make it less useful now. However, given that approximately 27% of the books listed in the NUC Pre-1956 Imprints were not in listed WorldCat as of 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Project history==
The [[Library of Congress]] began its [[union catalog]] project in 1901 in an attempt to locate and note the location of a copy of every important book in the [[United States]].  With financial assistance from [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]], the collection grew to over 11 million cards.  Copies of these cards were distributed to a number of libraries around the country. Eventually the cards for all materials catalogued by the cooperating libraries were reproduced and issued serially in printed volumes as the National Union Catalog, supplementing the Library of Congress Catalog of Printed Books. Monthly NUC catalogs were cumulated quarterly, annually, and multi-annually.

In an effort to simplify research, it was decided in the 1960s to collect and publish all of the references to pre-1956 imprints in a single alphabetical listing.  [[Mansell Information/Publishing Ltd.]], the company which created the [[British Museum]] library catalog, won the contract to publish the proposed union catalog. Over the next 14 years, about five 600-page volumes were published each month until the NUC of Pre-1956 Imprints was completed, largely superseding the older Library of Congress Catalog of Printed Books.

===Physical dimensions===
The NUC of Pre-1956 Imprints is published in 754 volumes, containing over 528,000 pages.  The set takes up approximately {{convert|130|ft|m}} of shelf space. It weighs three tons.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5660">A '''partwork''' is a written publication released as a series of planned [[magazine]]-like issues over a period of time.  Issues are typically released on a weekly, fortnightly or monthly basis, and often a completed set is designed to form a reference work on a particular topic.

==Publication==
Partwork series run for a determined length and have a finite life. Generally, partworks cover specific areas of interest, such as sports, hobbies, or children's interest and stories such as ''[[PC Ace]]'' and the successful ''[[The Ancestral Trail]]'' series by [[Marshall Cavendish]] Ltd. They are generally sold at [[newsagent]]s and are mostly supported by massive [[television advertising]] campaigns for the launch. In the [[United Kingdom]], partworks are usually launched by heavy television advertising each January.&lt;ref name="scotsman"&gt;{{cite news|

Partworks often include cover-mounted items with each issue that build into a complete set over time.&lt;ref name="scotsman" /&gt; For example, a partwork about art might include a small number of paints or pencils that build into a complete art-set; a partwork about [[dinosaur]]s might include a few [[replica]] bones that build a complete model skeleton at the end of the series; a partwork about [[film]]s may include a [[DVD]] with each issue. In [[Europe]], partworks with collectable models are extremely popular; there are a number of different publications that come with character figurines or [[die casting|diecast]] model vehicles, for example: The [[James Bond Car Collection]].

In addition, completed partworks have sometimes been used to create case-bound reference works and [[encyclopedia]]s. An example is the multi-volume ''Illustrated Science and Invention Encyclopedia'' which was created with material first published in the ''How It Works'' partwork.

In the UK, partworks are the fourth-best selling magazine sector, after TV listing guides, women's weeklies and women's monthlies.  A common inducement is a heavy discount for the first one or two issues.  The same series can be sold worldwide in different languages and even in different variations.&lt;ref name="scotsman" /&gt;

== History ==
Prior to the invention of printing, the [[Manuscript culture#Pecia system|Pecia System]] was used in European university cities. Books were divided into sections known as ''Pecia''. Students or other individuals could rent the individual pieces and copy them by hand. In this way, several individuals could work on copying one book at the same time.

With the advent of printing, ''serialized publication'' came into use by printers and publishers. Between 1728 and 1732, [[Nicolas Tindal|Nicolas Tindal's]] English translation of [[Paul de Rapin|Paul de Rapin's]] ''L'Histoire d'Angleterre'' (The History of England) was issued by a London printer in monthly parts. A rival printer then tried to compete by selling another translation of de Rapin's work in weekly, six-penny installments.&lt;ref name="woolf" /&gt; An edition of ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs]]'' was issued in three-penny installments in 1732.&lt;ref name="woolf"&gt;{{cite book |last= Woolf |first= Daniel R.|title= Reading history in early modern England
  |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year= 2000 |page=279|isbn= 0-521-78046-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AS0XO7C_Rc8C&amp;pg=PA279#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, printing a book was a lengthy process, copies of each section of the book being printed in turn until the work was complete; the sections would then be collated and the print–run of books could then be sold. The alternative of selling individual sections as soon as they were printed would enable the printer could gain a steady income while the book was being produced, and potentially increase sales by selling to people who could not afford the upfront cost of a copy of the complete book.

In the 19th century, many of [[Charles Dickens]]' novels were first published as partworks. For example, ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'' was first published in 19 parts, between 1836 and 1837. ''[[The Old Curiosity Shop]]'' was first published in 88 weekly parts between April 1840 and November 1841.

In the mid-20th century, partwork serialized encyclopedias were issued. Publishers soon branching out to topics, including cookery books and series on gardening and car maintenance.&lt;ref name="scotsman" /&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Partworks, particularly those that contain parts for the production of a model or similar collectable items that are individually of little value, often draw criticism for the extremely high prices of their finished product. One example, released in the UK in 2009, required the purchase of 125 issues to collect the parts for a static, model aircraft; the total would be £620.25. Examples of other models that cost over £400 to produce are cited, and some subscribers complain they have parts missing that they are unable to replace.&lt;ref name="scotsman" /&gt;

{{Patent law}}
{{Capitalism|Concepts}}
A '''patent''' is a form of [[intellectual property]].  A patent gives its owner the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, and importing an [[invention]] for a limited period of time, usually twenty years. The patent rights are granted in exchange for an [[sufficiency of disclosure|enabling public disclosure]] of the invention. People who are employed to do research are often obligated by their [[employment contract]]s to [[Assignment (law)|assign]] inventions to their employer. In most countries patent rights fall under [[Private law|civil law]] and the patent holder needs to sue someone [[Patent infringement|infringing the patent]] in order to enforce their rights. In some [[Outline_of_industry#Major_industries|industries]] patents are an essential form of [[competitive advantage]]; in others they are irrelevant.&lt;ref name="WIPO Handbook Ch 2"&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/about-ip/en/iprm/pdf/ch2.pdf WIPO Intellectual Property Handbook: Policy, Law and Use.

The procedure for granting patents, requirements placed on the patentee, and the extent of the exclusive rights vary widely between countries according to national laws and international agreements. Typically, however, a granted patent application must include one or more [[Patent claim|claims]] that define the invention. A patent may include many claims, each of which defines a specific property right. These claims must meet relevant [[patentability]] requirements, such as [[novelty (patent)|novelty]], [[Utility (patent)|usefulness]], and [[inventive step and non-obviousness|non-obviousness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wipo.int/patents/en/faq_patents.html#protection |title=Patents: Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=[[World Intellectual Property Organization]] |accessdate=24 June 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620234910/http://www.wipo.int/patents/en/faq_patents.html#protection |archivedate=20 June 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lemley-2005"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lemley, Mark A. |author2=Shapiro, Carl|year=2005|title=Probabilistic Patents|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives, Stanford Law and Economics Olin Working Paper No. 288|volume=19|page=75|doi=10.2139/ssrn.567883}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[World Trade Organization]]'s (WTO) [[TRIPS Agreement]], patents should be available in WTO member states for any invention, in all fields of technology, provided they are new, involve an inventive step, and are capable of industrial application.&lt;ref&gt;Article 27.1. of the TRIPs Agreement.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, there are variations on what is [[patentable subject matter]] from country to country, also among WTO member states. TRIPS also provides that the [[term of patent|term of protection]] available should be a minimum of twenty years.&lt;ref name=PatentLength/&gt;

==Definition==
The word ''patent'' originates from the [[Latin]] ''patere'', which means "to lay open" (i.e., to make available for public inspection). It is a shortened version of the term ''[[letters patent]]'', which was an open document or instrument issued by a monarch or government granting exclusive rights to a person, predating the modern patent system.  Similar grants included [[land patent]]s, which were land grants by early state governments in the USA, and [[printing patent]]s, a precursor of modern copyright.

In modern usage, the term ''patent'' usually refers to the right granted to anyone who invents something new, useful and non-obvious. Some other types of intellectual property rights are also called ''patents'' in some jurisdictions: [[Industrial design right|industrial design rights]] are called ''[[Design patent|design patents]]'' in the US,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s1502.html|title=1502 Definition of a Design [R-08.2012]|work=Manual of Patent Examining Procedure|publisher=USPTO|accessdate=7 January 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107075408/http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s1502.html|archivedate=7 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[plant breeders' rights]] are sometimes called ''plant patents'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uspto.gov/patents/resources/types/plant_patents.jsp|title=General Information About 35 U.S.C. 161 Plant Patents|publisher=USPTO|accessdate=7 January 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107075405/http://www.uspto.gov/patents/resources/types/plant_patents.jsp|archivedate=7 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[utility model]]s and ''[[Gebrauchsmuster]]'' are sometimes called ''petty patents'' or ''innovation patents''.

The additional qualification ''utility patent'' is sometimes used (primarily in the US) to distinguish the primary meaning from these other types of patents. Particular species of patents for inventions include [[biological patent]]s, [[business method patent]]s, [[chemical patent]]s and [[software patent]]s.

[[File:Venetian Patent Statute 1474.png|thumb|right|220px|The [[Venetian Patent Statute]], issued by the Senate of Venice in 1474, and one of the earliest statutory patent systems in the world.]]
Although there is some evidence that some form of patent rights was recognized in [[Ancient Greece]] in the Greek city of [[Sybaris]],&lt;ref name="Anthon"&gt;[[Charles Anthon]], ''A Classical Dictionary: Containing An Account of the Principal Proper Names Mentioned in Ancient Authors, And Intended To Elucidate All The Important Points Connected With The Geography, History, Biography, Mythology, And Fine Arts Of The Greeks And Romans Together With An Account Of Coins, Weights, And Measures, With Tabular Values Of The Same'', Harper &amp; Bros, 1841, page 1273.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phylarchus of Naucratis, "The Deipnosophists, or, Banquet of the Learned of Athenæus", Translated from Ancient Greek by H.Bohn 12:20, p.835&lt;/ref&gt; The first statutory patent system is generally regarded to be the [[Venetian Patent Statute]] of 1474. Patents were systematically granted in [[Venice]] as of 1474, where they issued a decree by which new and inventive devices had to be communicated to the Republic in order to obtain legal protection against potential infringers. The period of protection was 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wolfgang-pfaller.de/venedig.htm | title=Wolfgang-Pfaller.de: Patentgesetz von Venedig | language=German, Italian | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630055924/http://www.wolfgang-pfaller.de/venedig.htm | archivedate=2007-06-30 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

This was incorporated into the [[Statute of Monopolies]] (1624) in which Parliament restricted the Crown's power explicitly so that the King could only issue letters patent to the inventors or introducers of original inventions for a fixed number of years. The Statute became the foundation for later developments in patent law in England and elsewhere.

Important developments in patent law emerged during the 18th century through a slow process of judicial interpretation of the law. During the reign of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], patent applications were required to supply a complete specification of the principles of operation of the invention for public access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/patent/p-about/p-whatis/p-history/p-history-18century.htm|title=The 18th century|publisher=Intellectual Property Office|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422075818/http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/patent/p-about/p-whatis/p-history/p-history-18century.htm|archivedate=2014-04-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal battles around the 1796 patent taken out by [[James Watt]] for his [[steam engine]], established the principles that patents could be issued for improvements of an already existing machine and that ideas or principles without specific practical application could also legally be patented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History of Copyright |publisher=[[UK Intellectual Property Office]] |year=2006 |url=http://www.patent.gov.uk/about-history-copy.htm |accessdate=2007-08-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929090202/http://www.patent.gov.uk/about-history-copy.htm |archivedate=2007-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by the [[philosophy]] of [[John Locke]], the granting of patents began to be viewed as a form of intellectual property right, rather than simply the obtaining of economic privilege.

The English legal system became the foundation for patent law in countries with a [[common law]] heritage, including the United States, New Zealand and Australia. In the [[Thirteen Colonies]], inventors could obtain patents through petition to a given colony's legislature. In 1641, [[Samuel Winslow (patentee)|Samuel Winslow]] was granted the first patent in North America by the [[Massachusetts General Court]] for a new process for making salt.&lt;ref&gt;James W.

The modern French patent system was created during the [[French Revolution|Revolution]] in 1791.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Galvez-Behar,"La République des inventeurs. Propriété et organisation de l'invention en France, 1791-1922", Rennes, Presses universitaires de Rennes, 2008, {{ISBN|978-2-7535-0695-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Patents were granted without examination since inventor's right was considered as a natural one. Patent costs were very high (from 500 to 1,500 francs). Importation patents protected new devices coming from foreign countries. The patent law was revised in 1844 - patent cost was lowered and importation patents were abolished.

The first Patent Act of the U.S. Congress was passed on April 10, 1790, titled "An Act to promote the progress of useful Arts".&lt;ref&gt;Online at Library of Congress: "A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774 - 1875": First Congress, Session II, chapter VII, 1790: [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=001/llsl001.db&amp;recNum=232 "An Act to Promote the Progress of Useful Arts"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118130913/http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=001%2Fllsl001.db&amp;recNum=232 |date=2016-01-18 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The first patent was granted on July 31, 1790 to [[Samuel Hopkins (inventor)|Samuel Hopkins]]  for a method of producing [[potash]] (potassium carbonate). A revised patent law was passed in 1793, and in 1836 a major revision to the patent law was passed. The 1836 law instituted a significantly more rigorous application process, including the establishment of an examination system. Between 1790 and 1836 about ten thousand patents were granted. By the Civil War about 80,000 patents had been granted.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph M. Gabriel, Medical Monopoly: Intellectual Property Rights and the Origins of the Modern Pharmaceutical Industry.

==Law==
{{Intellectual property}}

===Effects===
A patent does not give a right to make or use or sell an invention.&lt;ref name="Herman"&gt;"A patent is not the grant of a right to make or use or sell. It does not, directly or indirectly, imply any such right. It grants only the right to exclude others. The supposition that a right to make is created by the patent grant is obviously inconsistent with the established distinctions between generic and specific patents, and with the well-known fact that a very considerable portion of the patents granted are in a field covered by a former relatively generic or basic patent, are tributary to such earlier patent, and cannot be practiced unless by license thereunder." – ''Herman v. Youngstown Car Mfg. Co.'', 191 F. 579, 584–85, 112 CCA 185 (6th Cir. 1911)&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, a patent provides, from a legal standpoint, the [[Natural and legal rights|right]] to ''exclude others''&lt;ref name="Herman"/&gt; from making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the patented [[invention]] for the [[Term of patent|term of the patent]], which is usually 20 years from the filing date&lt;ref name=PatentLength&gt;Article 33 of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights ([[TRIPS]]).&lt;/ref&gt; subject to the payment of [[maintenance fee (patent)|maintenance fees]]. From an economic and practical standpoint however, a patent is better and perhaps more precisely regarded as conferring upon its proprietor "a right to ''try'' to exclude by asserting the patent in court", for many granted patents turn out to be invalid once their proprietors attempt to assert them in court.&lt;ref name="lemley-2005"/&gt; A patent is a limited property right the government gives inventors in exchange for their agreement to share details of their inventions with the public. Like any other property right, it may be sold, licensed, [[mortgage law|mortgaged]], assigned or transferred, given away, or simply abandoned.

A patent, being an exclusionary right, does not necessarily give the patent owner the right to exploit the invention subject to the patent. For example, many inventions are improvements of prior inventions that may still be covered by someone else's patent.&lt;ref name="Herman"/&gt; If an inventor obtains a patent on improvements to an existing invention which is still under patent, they can only legally use the improved invention if the patent holder of the original invention gives permission, which they may refuse.

Some countries have "working provisions" that require the invention be exploited in the jurisdiction it covers. Consequences of not working an invention vary from one country to another, ranging from revocation of the patent rights to the awarding of a compulsory license awarded by the courts to a party wishing to exploit a patented invention. The patentee has the opportunity to challenge the revocation or license, but is usually required to provide evidence that the reasonable requirements of the public have been met by the working of invention.

===Challenges===
{{anchor|Invalid patent}}
In most jurisdictions, there are ways for third parties to challenge the validity of an allowed or issued patent at the national patent office; these are called [[Opposition proceeding|opposition proceedings]].  It is also possible to challenge the validity of a patent in court. In either case, the challenging party tries to prove that the patent should never have been granted. There are several grounds for challenges: the claimed subject matter is not [[patentable subject matter]] at all;  the claimed subject matter was actually not new, or was obvious to experts in the field, at the time the application was filed; or that some kind of fraud was committed during prosecution with regard to listing of inventors, representations about when discoveries were made, etc.  Patents can be found to be invalid in whole or in part for any of these reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ford|first1=Roger Allan|title=Patent Invalidity Versus Noninfringement|journal=Cornell Law Review|volume=99|issue=1|pages=71–128|url=http://cornelllawreview.org/files/2013/11/99CLR71.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017073705/http://cornelllawreview.org/files/2013/11/99CLR71.pdf|archivedate=2016-10-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Silverman|first1=Arnold B.|title=Evaluating the Validity of a United States Patent|journal=JOM|date=1990|volume=42|issue=7|page=46|url=http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/JOM/matters/matters-9007.html|doi=10.1007/bf03221022|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823135108/http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/JOM/matters/matters-9007.html|archivedate=2016-08-23|df=|bibcode=1990JOM....42g..46S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infringement===
{{Main article|Patent infringement}}
Patent infringement occurs when a third party, without authorization from the patentee, makes, uses, or sells a patented invention. Patents, however, are enforced on a nation by nation basis. The making of an item in China, for example, that would infringe a U.S. patent, would not constitute infringement under US patent law unless the item were imported into the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mallor|first1=Jane|title=BUSINESS LAW: THE ETHICAL, GLOBAL, AND E-COMMERCE ENVIRONMENT|publisher=McGraw-Hill/Irwin|isbn=978-0-07-352498-6|pages=266|edition=15th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enforcement===
Patents can generally only be enforced through [[Lawsuit|civil lawsuits]] (for example, for a U.S. patent, by an action for patent infringement in a United States federal court), although some countries (such as [[France]] and [[Austria]]) have criminal penalties for [[wikt:wanton#Adjective|wanton]] infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=DLA Piper Rudnick Gray Cary |year=2005 |title=Patent Litigation across Europe |url=http://cecollect.com/ve/ZZf3096aBBft91T940 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006203134/http://cecollect.com/ve/ZZf3096aBBft91T940 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-10-06 |publisher=cecollect.com |authorlink=DLA Piper Rudnick Gray Cary }}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the patent owner seeks monetary compensation for past infringement, and seeks an [[injunction]] that prohibits the defendant from engaging in future acts of infringement. To prove infringement, the patent owner must establish that the accused infringer practises all the requirements of at least one of the claims of the patent. (In many jurisdictions the scope of the patent may not be limited to what is literally stated in the claims, for example due to the ''[[doctrine of equivalents]]'').

An accused infringer has the right to challenge the validity of the patent allegedly being infringed in a [[counterclaim]].  A patent can be found invalid on grounds described in the relevant patent laws, which vary between countries.  Often, the grounds are a subset of requirements for [[patentability]] in the relevant country. Although an infringer is generally free to rely on any available ground of invalidity (such as a [[Novelty (patent)|prior publication]], for example), some countries have sanctions to prevent the same validity questions being relitigated.  An example is the UK [[Certificate of contested validity]].

Patent [[license|licensing agreements]] are [[contract]]s in which the patent owner (the licensor) agrees to grant the licensee the right to make, use, sell, and/or import the claimed invention, usually in return for a royalty or other compensation.  It is common for companies engaged in complex technical fields to enter into multiple license agreements associated with the production of a single product. Moreover, it is equally common for competitors in such fields to license patents to each other under [[cross-licensing]] agreements in order to share the benefits of using each other's patented inventions.

===Ownership===
In most countries, both natural persons and corporate entities may apply for a patent. In the United States, however, only the inventor(s) may apply for a patent although it may be [[assignment (law)|assigned]] to a corporate entity subsequently&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Assignee (Company) Name | url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/patents/patog/week39/OG/help/help.htm#Assignee%20(Company)%20Name | work=Help Page | publisher=U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) | accessdate=2007-07-25 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814113345/http://www.uspto.gov/web/patents/patog/week39/OG/help/help.htm#Assignee%20(Company)%20Name | archivedate=2007-08-14 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and inventors may be required to assign inventions to their employers under an employment contract. In most European countries, ownership of an invention may pass from the inventor to their employer by rule of law if the invention was made in the course of the inventor's normal or specifically assigned employment duties, where an invention might reasonably be expected to result from carrying out those duties, or if the inventor had a special obligation to further the interests of the employer's company.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.ipo.gov.uk/practice-sec-039.pdf Section 39 of the UK Patents Act] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225004529/http://www.ipo.gov.uk/practice-sec-039.pdf |date=2009-02-25 }} as an example. The laws across Europe vary from country to country but are generally harmonised. In an Australian context, see ''University of Western Australia v Gray'' [2008] FCA 498 [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/federal_ct/2008/498.html AUSTLII]&lt;/ref&gt;

The inventors, their successors or their assignees become the proprietors of the patent when and if it is granted. If a patent is granted to more than one proprietor, the laws of the country in question and any agreement between the proprietors may affect the extent to which each proprietor can exploit the patent. For example, in some countries, each proprietor may freely license or assign their rights in the patent to another person while the law in other countries prohibits such actions without the permission of the other proprietor(s).

The ability to assign ownership rights increases the [[market liquidity|liquidity]] of a patent as property.  Inventors can obtain patents and then sell them to third parties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/27-trips_04c_e.htm Article 28.2 TRIPs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170622154724/https://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/27-trips_04c_e.htm |date=2017-06-22 }}: "''Patent owners shall also have the right to assign, or transfer by succession, the patent and to conclude licensing contracts.''".&lt;/ref&gt;  The third parties then own the patents and have the same rights to prevent others from exploiting the claimed inventions, as if they had originally made the inventions themselves.

===Governing laws===
{{See also|Outline of patents}}

The grant and enforcement of patents are governed by national laws, and also by international treaties, where those treaties have been given effect in national laws.  Patents are granted by national or regional patent offices.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) [http://www.wipo.int/patentscope/en/patents_faq.html#patent FAQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225083135/http://www.wipo.int/patentscope/en/patents_faq.html |date=2013-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A given patent is therefore only useful for protecting an invention in the country in which that patent is granted. In other words, patent law is territorial in nature. When a patent application is published, the invention disclosed in the application becomes [[prior art]] and enters the [[public domain]] (if not protected by other patents) in countries where a patent applicant does not seek protection, the application thus generally&lt;!--There might be grace periods in some countries (?)--&gt; becoming prior art against anyone (including the applicant) who might seek patent protection for the invention in those countries.

Commonly, a nation or a group of nations forms a [[patent office]] with responsibility for operating that nation's patent system, within the relevant patent laws. The patent office generally has responsibility for the grant of patents, with infringement being the remit of national courts. 

The authority for patent statutes in different countries varies. In the UK, substantive patent law is contained in the Patents Act 1977 as amended.&lt;ref&gt;United Kingdom law requiring no explicit authority due to the [[Supremacy of Parliament]].&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] empowers [[United States Congress|Congress]] to make laws to "promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts..." The laws Congress passed are codified in [[Title 35 of the United States Code]] and created the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]].

There is a trend towards global harmonization of patent laws, with the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) being particularly active in this area.{{cn|date=January 2018}} The [[TRIPS Agreement]] has been largely successful in providing a forum for nations to agree on an aligned set of patent laws.  Conformity with the TRIPS agreement is a requirement of admission to the WTO and so compliance is seen by many nations as important.  This has also led to many developing nations, which may historically have developed different laws to aid their development, enforcing patents laws in line with global practice.

Internationally, there are international treaty procedures, such as the procedures under the [[European Patent Convention]] (EPC) [constituting the [[European Patent Organisation]] (EPOrg)], that centralize some portion of the filing and examination procedure. Similar arrangements exist among the member states of [[African Regional Intellectual Property Organization|ARIPO]] and [[Organisation Africaine de la Propriété Intellectuelle|OAPI]], the analogous treaties among African countries, and the nine [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] member states that have formed the [[Eurasian Patent Organization]]. A key international convention relating to patents is the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property]], initially signed in 1883. The Paris Convention sets out a range of basic rules relating to patents, and although the convention does not have direct legal effect in all national jurisdictions, the principles of the convention are incorporated into all notable current patent systems. The most significant aspect of the convention is the provision of the right to claim [[priority right|priority]]: filing an application in any one member state of the Paris Convention preserves the right for one year to file in any other member state, and receive the benefit of the original filing date. Another key treaty is the [[Patent Cooperation Treaty]] (PCT), administered by [[World Intellectual Property Organization|WIPO]] and covering more than 150 countries. The Patent Cooperation Treaty provides a unified procedure for filing patent applications to protect inventions in each of its contracting states. A patent application filed under the PCT is called an international application, or PCT application.

===Application and prosecution===
{{Main article|Patent application|Patent prosecution}}
A patent is requested by filing a written [[Patent application|application]] at the relevant patent office.  The person or company filing the application is referred to as "the applicant". The applicant may be the inventor or its assignee. The application contains a description of how to make and use the invention that must provide [[sufficiency of disclosure|sufficient detail]] for a person skilled in the art (i.e., the relevant area of technology) to make and use the invention. In some countries there are requirements for providing specific information such as the usefulness of the invention, the [[Sufficiency of disclosure|best mode]] of performing the invention known to the inventor, or the [[technical problem]] or problems solved by the invention. Drawings illustrating the invention may also be provided.

The application also includes one or more [[Patent claim|claims]] that define what a patent covers or the "scope of protection".

After filing, an application is often referred to as "[[patent pending]]".  While this term does not confer legal protection, and a patent cannot be enforced until granted, it serves to provide warning to potential infringers that if the patent is issued, they may be liable for damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/media/pages/whatis/patents.htm|title=What does 'patent pending' mean?|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829120240/http://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/media/pages/whatis/patents.htm|archivedate=29 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;USPTO web site, [http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/doc/general/patpend.htm ''Patent Marking and "Patent Pending"'' (Excerpted from General Information Concerning Patents print brochure)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802035958/http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/doc/general/patpend.htm |date=2009-08-02 }}, Consulted on August 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[UK Intellectual Property Office]] web site, [http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/patent/p-manage/p-useenforce/p-displayrights.htm ''Display your rights''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903125501/http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/patent/p-manage/p-useenforce/p-displayrights.htm |date=2009-09-03 }}, (under "IPO Home&gt; Types of IP&gt; Patents&gt; Managing your patents&gt; Using and enforcing") Consulted on August 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once filed, a patent application is [[Patent prosecution|"prosecuted"]]. A [[patent examiner]] reviews the patent application to determine if it meets the [[patentability]] requirements of that country.  If the application does not comply, objections are communicated to the applicant or their [[patent attorney|patent agent or attorney]] through an [[Office action]], to which the applicant may respond.  The number of Office actions and responses that may occur vary from country to country, but eventually a final rejection is sent by the patent office, or the patent application is granted, which after the payment of additional fees, leads to an issued, enforceable patent.  In some jurisdictions, there are opportunities for third parties to bring an [[opposition proceeding]] between grant and issuance, or post-issuance.

Once granted the patent is subject in most countries to [[maintenance fee (patent)|renewal fees]] to keep the patent in force. These fees are generally payable on a yearly basis.  Some countries or regional patent offices (e.g. the [[European Patent Office]]) also require annual renewal fees to be paid for a patent application before it is granted.

====Costs====
The costs of preparing and filing a patent application, prosecuting it until grant and maintaining the patent vary from one jurisdiction to another, and may also be dependent upon the type and complexity of the invention, and on the type of patent.

The European Patent Office estimated in 2005 that the average cost of obtaining a European patent (via a Euro-direct application, i.e. not based on a PCT application) and maintaining the patent for a 10-year term was around €32,000.&lt;ref&gt;With the following assumptions: "18 pages (11 pages description, 3 pages claims, 4 pages drawings), 10 claims, patent validated in 6 countries (Germany, United Kingdom, France, Italy, Spain, Switzerland), excl. in-house preparation costs for the patentee" (the costs relate to European patents granted in 2002/2003), in European Patent Office, [http://www.european-patent-office.org/epo/new/cost_analysis_2005_en.pdf ''The cost of a sample European patent – new estimates''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527201548/http://www.european-patent-office.org/epo/new/cost_analysis_2005_en.pdf |date=2008-05-27 }}, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[London Agreement (2000)|London Agreement]] entered into force on May 1, 2008, this estimation is however no longer up-to-date, since fewer translations are required.

In the United States, in 2000 the cost of obtaining a patent ([[patent prosecution]]) was estimated to be from $10,000 to $30,000 per patent.&lt;ref name="lemley"&gt;Lemley, Mark A., Rational Ignorance at the Patent Office (February 2001). Northwestern University Law Review, Vol. 95, No. 4, 2001. {{doi|10.2139/ssrn.261400}}&lt;/ref&gt; When patent litigation is involved (which in year 1999 happened in about 1,600 cases compared to 153,000 patents issued in the same year&lt;ref name="lemley" /&gt;), costs increase significantly: although 95% of patent litigation cases are settled [[Settlement (litigation)|out of court]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hblaw.org/articles-reader/items/carry-a-big-stick.html|title=Holland &amp; Bonzagni a full Service IP Law Firm in Western Massachusetts - Holland &amp; Bonzagni, P.C.

===Alternatives===
A [[defensive publication]] is the act of publishing a detailed description of a new invention without patenting it, so as to establish [[prior art]] and public identification as the creator/originator of an invention, although a defensive publication can also be anonymous. A defensive publication prevents others from later being able to patent the invention.

A [[trade secret]] is information that is intentionally kept confidential and that provides a competitive advantage to its possessor. Trade secrets are protected by [[non-disclosure agreement]] and [[labour law]], each of which prevents information leaks such as [[Breach of confidence|breaches of confidentiality]] and [[industrial espionage]]. Compared to patents, the advantages of trade secrets are that the value of a trade secret continues until it is made public,&lt;ref name="klinkert-6"&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.miplc.de/research/lecture-series/ |title=The Misappropriation of Trade Secrets in Germany and U.S. Discovery Aid |first=Friedrich |last=Klinkert |date=April 2012 |conference=[[Munich Intellectual Property Law Center|MIPLC]] Lecture Series |accessdate=May 6, 2012 |page=6 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608121247/http://www.miplc.de/research/lecture-series/ |archivedate=June 8, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas a patent is only in force for a specified time, after which others may freely copy the invention; does not require payment of fees to governmental agencies or filing paperwork;&lt;ref name="klinkert-6"/&gt; has an immediate effect;&lt;ref name="klinkert-6"/&gt; and does not require any disclosure of information to the public.&lt;ref name="klinkert-6"/&gt; The key disadvantage of a trade secret is its vulnerability to [[reverse engineering]].&lt;ref name="klinkert-7"&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.miplc.de/research/lecture-series/ |title=The Misappropriation of Trade Secrets in Germany and U.S. Discovery Aid |first=Friedrich |last=Klinkert |date=April 2012 |conference=[[Munich Intellectual Property Law Center|MIPLC]] Lecture Series |accessdate=May 6, 2012 |page=7 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608121247/http://www.miplc.de/research/lecture-series/ |archivedate=June 8, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
Primary incentives embodied in the patent system include incentives to invent in the first place; to disclose the invention once made; to invest the sums necessary to experiment, produce and market the invention; and to [[design around]] and improve upon earlier patents.&lt;ref name="Markey"/&gt;

Supporters of patents argue that without patent protection, R&amp;D spending would be significantly less or eliminated altogether, limiting the possibility of technological advances or breakthroughs.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Corporations would be much more conservative about the R&amp;D investments they made, as third parties would be [[Free-rider problem|free to exploit]] any developments.

This allows the inventor to accumulate capital from licensing the invention and may allow innovation to occur because he or she may choose not to manage a manufacturing buildup for the invention.

==Origin and recording==
According to [[Michael Azerrad|Michael Azerrad's]] 1993 Nirvana biography, ''[[Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana]]'', "Pennyroyal Tea" was written by Cobain in 1990 in an [[Olympia, Washington]] apartment he shared with Nirvana drummer, [[Dave Grohl]]. "Dave and I were screwing around on a [[4-track (multitrack)|4-track]]," Cobain explained, "and I wrote that song in about thirty seconds. And I sat down for like half-an-hour and wrote the lyrics and then we recorded it."&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, Michael. Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana. Doubleday, 1994. {{ISBN|0-385-47199-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was first performed live on April 17, 1991 at the [[OK Hotel]] in [[Seattle, Washington]], the show at which Nirvana also debuted their breakthrough single, "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]."&lt;ref name="autogenerated19"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gaar|first1=Gillian G.|title=In Utero|date=2006|publisher=Continium|location=United States|isbn=0-8264-1776-0|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two unfinished takes, both lacking vocals, were recorded by [[Jack Endino]] on October 26, 1992, at [[Reciprocal Recording|Word of Mouth]] in [[Seattle, Washington]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated19"/&gt;

The final version was recorded by [[Steve Albini]] at [[Pachyderm Studio]] in [[Cannon Falls, Minnesota]] in February, 1993, and officially released on ''In Utero'' in September, 1993. Cobain was unsatisfied with the recording, telling [[David Fricke]] in a 1993 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' interview that the song "was not recorded right. There is something wrong with that. That should have been recorded like ''[[Nevermind]]'', because I know that's a strong song, a hit single. We're toying with the idea of re-recording it or remixing it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fricke|first1=David|title=Kurt Cobain, The Rolling Stone Interview: Success Doesn't Suck|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/kurt-cobain-the-rolling-stone-interview-19940127|accessdate=21 January 2018|publisher=Rolling Stone|date=January 27, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was remixed by [[Scott Litt]], who had remixed the ''In Utero'' songs "[[Heart-Shaped Box]]" and "[[All Apologies]]" prior to the album's release, on November 22, 1993 at Bad Animals in [[Seattle, Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garr|first1=Gillian G.|title=In Utero|date=2006|publisher=Continium|location=United States|isbn=0-8264-1776-0|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version appears on the censored [[Wal-Mart]] and [[Kmart]] versions of ''In Utero'', released in March 1994, and is the mix that was released as a single. It also appears on the band's two [[greatest hits album]]s, ''[[Nirvana (Nirvana album)|Nirvana]]'' (2002) and ''[[Icon (Nirvana album)|Icon]]'' (2010).

==Composition and lyrics==
The song's title refers to the tea made from boiling the leaves of the plant ''[[Mentha pulegium]]'', or pennyroyal, which is used as an [[abortifacient]], among other things, in [[traditional medicine]]. In Cobain's unused liner notes for ''In Utero'', published posthumously in [[Journals (Cobain)|''Journals'']] in 2002, the entry for "Pennyroyal Tea" simply reads: "herbal abortive... it doesn't work, you hippie."&lt;ref&gt;Cobain, Kurt. "Journals". Published in 2002 by Riverhead Books. {{ISBN|978-1-57322-232-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview in the October 1993 issue of ''Impact'', Cobain gave greater insight into the song, saying that it was about a person suffering from severe depression:&lt;ref&gt;Punter, Jennie. (October 1993). "[http://www.nirvanaclub.com/info/articles/10.00.93-impact.html In Womb]." ''Impact''. Retrieved May 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|When I ask Cobain if 'Penny Royal Tea' is about indigestion, he half-laughs. 'Penny royal tea is a herbal abortive,' he says. 'I threw that in because I have so many friends who have tried to use that, and it never worked. The song is about a person who's beyond depressed; they're in their death bed, pretty much.' Cobain's own bout with serious stomach pain was well documented last year. 'Yeah, it did rub off on the song,' he admits. And I couldn't help noticing the 'Canadian' reference to a [[Leonard Cohen]] afterworld. 'That was my therapy, when I was depressed and sick. I'd read things like ''[[Malone Dies|Malloy Dies]]'' [sic] by [[Samuel Beckett|Beckett]], or listen to Leonard Cohen, which would actually make it worse,' he laughs.}}

In a 1995 interview, Cohen told ''[[Addicted to Noise]]'' correspondent Peter Howell, "I'm sorry I couldn't have spoken to the young man. I see a lot of people at the [[Mount Baldy Zen Center|Zen Centre]], who have gone through drugs and found a way out that is not just Sunday school. There are always alternatives, and I might have been able to lay something on him. Or maybe not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=MTV News Staff |title=Leonard Cohen on Kurt Cobain |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/504567/leonard-cohen-on-kurt-cobain/ |accessdate=29 November 2018 |work=MTV |date=August 6, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=de Lisle|first=Tim|title=Who held a gun to Leonard Cohen's head?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/sep/17/2|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=25 May 2013|location=London|date=September 17, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release and reception==
The "Pennyroyal Tea" single was recalled shortly after Cobain's death in April 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |date=April 30, 1994 |title=Cashbox - International - U.K/London Calling |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Archive-Cash-Box-IDX/90s/1994/CB-1994-04-30-OCR-Page-0016.pdf#search=%22nirvana%20pennyroyal%22 |magazine=[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]] |location= |publisher= |access-date=August 15, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The single's cancellation may have in part be due to the title of one of the [[A-side and B-side|b-sides]], "[[I Hate Myself and Want to Die]],"&lt;ref name="Pennyroyal3"/&gt;, although it may have been cancelled regardless of this, so as not to capitalize on Cobain's death.&lt;ref name="Pennyroyal3"/&gt;

At the time, only retail versions of the [[CD single]] made in [[Germany]] had been manufactured and distributed.&lt;ref name="Pennyroyal3"/&gt; The singles were recalled and destroyed by the record label or retailers, but some copies were put aside, which is apparently the source of surviving copies. Some copies may have been sold by retailers, despite the recall.&lt;ref name="Pennyroy.al3"/&gt; A [[Promo single|promotional CD single]] manufactured in the [[United Kingdom]] survived in even smaller numbers than the German retail CD.&lt;ref name="Pennyroyal3.2"&gt;[http://crimson-ceremony.net/pr3/page.php?id=pt-promo-uk Pennyroyal 3 - Penny Royal Tea promo]. crimson-ceremony.net. Retrieved on March 10, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Sleeves for the single's release in the UK, on 7 inch vinyl and cassette, were manufactured, but the single itself was not pressed in the UK prior to the recall. &lt;ref name="Pennyroyal3.3"&gt;[http://crimson-ceremony.net/pr3/page.php?id=pt-sleeves-uk Pennyroyal 3 - Pennyroyal Tea UK sleeves and inserts]. crimson-ceremony.net.

Retrieved on March 10, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

A planned promotional performance on the UK TV show ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' is evident as a [[Digital Audio Tape]] has been discovered containing three different mixes of "Pennyroyal Tea" all without vocals for the show which was strictly live vocal to track performances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://crimson-ceremony.net/pr3/page.php?id=pt-tvmixes TV Mixes Penny Royal Tea] crimson-ceremony.net.

Reviewing ''In Utero'' for ''Rolling Stone'', Fricke wrote, "In the sepulchral folk intro of 'Penny Royal Tea,' Cobain almost sounds like [[Michael Stipe]] at the beginning of [[R.E.M.|R.E.M.’s]] [[Drive (R.E.M. song)|Drive]]' — before the heaving, fuzz-burnt chorus comes lashing down with a vengeance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Fricke |first1=David |title=In Utero |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/in-utero-248756/ |accessdate=6 November 2018 |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=16 September 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review of the album for the ''[[NME]]'', John Mulvey wrote that "Pennyroyal Tea" was "a terrific song – straightforward, insidious, oddly moving," but that "the guitars don’t scream enough, the chorus doesn’t tower like it should, and overall it’s the one real ‘Call [[Butch Vig]]’ moment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mulvey |first1=John |title=Nirvana : In Utero |url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/reviews-nirvana-7373 |accessdate=26 November 2018 |publisher=NME |date=4 September 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the ''NME'' ranked it at number six on their list of the "20 Greatest Nirvana Songs Ever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://microsites.nme.com/php/nirvana/top20/index.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050206034701/http://microsites.nme.com/php/nirvana/top20/index.php|title=Countdown: 20 Greatest Nirvana Songs Ever|work=[[NME]]|date=March 26, 2004|archivedate=February 6, 2005|accessdate=August 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' erroneously included the song on their list of "12 Album Tracks That Should Have Been Singles, But Weren't," at number two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/q150lists.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718180112/http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/q150lists.htm |title=105: Missed Hits - 12 Album Tracks That Should Have Been Singles, But Weren't |work=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]|date=2004|archivedate=July 18, 2011|accessdate=October 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, ''Rolling Stone'' placed it at number 11 on their ranking of 102 Nirvana songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Johnston |first1=Maura |title=No Apologies: All 102 Nirvana Songs Ranked|accessdate=23 November 2018 |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artwork===

Unlike the artwork for the previous ''In Utero'' singles, "Heart-Shaped Box" and "[[All Apologies]]"/ "[[Rape Me]]", the artwork for the "Pennyroyal Tea" single featured no input from Cobain. "We got it done and I don't know that Kurt was around to approve it or not," recalls designer [[Robert M. Fisher|Robert Fisher]]. "I think it might just have been shot to management to approve or something."&lt;ref&gt;Gaar, Gillian G. In Utero. Continuum, 2006. {{ISBN|0-8264-1776-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The single's cover features a teacup on a table next to a used ashtray, a cream pitcher and animal crackers.

==MTV Unplugged version==

A live, acoustic version was recorded during the band's ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' performance on November 18, 1993 at Sony Music Studios in [[New York City]]. The band had tried different approaches to the song during the rehearsal earlier that day, performing it in a different key and with guitarist [[Pat Smear]] on backing vocals. However, during the show Cobain decided to attempt the song on his own and in the regular key, asking, "Am I going to do this by myself?" to which Grohl replied, "Do it by yourself," and Cobain joking that "if it sounds bad, these people are just going to have to wait." The song was performed in the same arrangement as the ''In Utero'' version but without the guitar solo, and Cobain paused before the third verse, as if briefly forgetting what lyric to sing next, then regained himself and completed the song. Cobain's biographer, [[Charles R. Cross|Charles Cross]], called this version Cobain's "single greatest moment onstage," writing that "like all the high-water marks of his career, it came at a time when he seemed destined to fail."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cross|first1=Charles R.|title=Heavier Than Heaven|date=August 15, 2001|publisher=Hyperion|location=United States|isbn=0-7868-6505-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This version was officially released on the album ''[[MTV Unplugged in New York]]'' in November, 1994. Footage of the performance, as well as from the rehearsals, were released on the ''MTV Unplugged in New York'' DVD in November, 2007.

==Music video==
[[Dutch people|Dutch]] director [[Anton Corbijn]] was asked to direct a music video for "Pennyroyal Tea", but he refused, saying he did not believe he could make a video better than the one he had made for "[[Heart-Shaped Box]]", the first single from ''In Utero''. American director [[Jeffery Plansker]] was enlisted as the director instead, but the planned video was abandoned after Cobain's death in April 1994.&lt;ref name="Pennyroyal3.4"&gt;[http://crimson-ceremony.net/pr3/page.php?id=pt-videoproposal Pennyroyal 3 - Pennyroyal Tea Music Video]. crimson-ceremony.net.

The '''Public Suffix List''' is a catalog of 
certain Internet [[domain name]]s.  The term is also known by the form '''effective top-level domain''' ('''eTLD''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.mozilla.org/Gecko:Effective_TLD_List|title=Public Suffix List - MozillaWiki|website=wiki.mozilla.org|accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Mozilla Foundation]] maintains suffix list for the security and privacy policies of its [[Firefox]] web browser, though it is available for other uses under the [[Mozilla Public License]] (MPL).

==List==
The list is used by [[Mozilla]] browsers (Firefox), by Google in [[Google Chrome|Chrome]] and [[Chromium (web browser)|Chromium]] projects on certain platforms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=364745|title=364745 - Treat PSL matching consistently across all platforms |website=bugs.chromium.org|accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and by [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/cookies-and-herokuapp-com|title=Cookies and the Public Suffix List|date=11 October 2013|publisher=Heroku|accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Future{{which|date=May 2017}} versions of [[Internet Explorer]] will also use the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2014/10/06/interoperable-top-level-domain-name-parsing-comes-to-ie.aspx|title=Interoperable Top Level Domain Name Parsing comes to IE|date=6 October 2014|publisher=IEBlog|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mozilla,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publicsuffix.org/|title=Public Suffix List|website=publicsuffix.org|accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|A "public suffix" is one under which Internet users can directly register names. Some examples of public suffixes are ".com", ".co.uk" and "pvt.k12.wy.us".}}

While ''com'', ''uk'', and ''us'' are [[top-level domain]]s (TLDs), Internet users cannot always register the next level of domain, such as "co.uk" or "wy.us", because these may be controlled by [[domain name registrar|domain registrars]]. By contrast, users can register second level domains within ''com'', such as ''example.com'', because registrars control only the top level. The Public Suffix List is intended to enumerate all domain suffixes controlled by registrars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://trac.ietf.org/trac/dbound/wiki/AdditionalBackgroundInformation |title=Additional Background Information for dbound |date=13 April 2015 |author=Murray Kucherawy |work=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] working group |quote=The PSL is maintained by a web browser producer and is kept current by volunteers on a best-effort basis. It contains a list of points in the hierarchical namespace at which registrations take place, and is used to identify the boundary between so-called "public" names (below which registrations can occur, such as ".com" or ".org.uk") and the private names (organizational names) that domain registrars create within them.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some uses for the list are:
* Avoiding [[HTTP cookie#Supercookie|"supercookies"]], HTTP cookies set for high-level domain name suffixes. In other words, a page at foo.example.co.uk might normally have access to cookies at bar.example.co.uk, but example.co.uk should be walled off from cookies at example2.co.uk, since the latter two domains could be registered by different owners.
* Finding [[DMARC]] policy records for email subdomains.
* Highlighting the most important part of a domain name in the [[user interface]].
* Improving the sorting of browser history entries by site.

'''Ralph L. Berry''' (November 20, 1906 – July 21, 1973), better known by the [[ring name]] '''"Wild" Red Berry''', was an [[United States|American]] [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]].&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt;

Berry was a [[World Light Heavyweight Championship (National Wrestling Association)#Title history|nine-time]] [[World Light Heavyweight Championship (National Wrestling Association)|NWA World Light Heavyweight Champion]] and an important smaller wrestler of the 1930s to the 1950s, as well as a famous [[Manager (professional wrestling)|professional wrestling manager]] in his later years.

Standing only 5'8", Berry had to find creative ways to win his matches, which is why he oftentimes turned to rule breaking. His defiant in-ring actions made him one of the most hated professional wrestlers of the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. Berry did not care, as his disregard for authority eventually lead him to more than fifteen [[professional wrestling championship]] reigns over the course of his lengthy career.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''WWE Encyclopedia Updated and Expanded the Definitive Guide to WWE''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Berry continued his deviant behavior long after his in-ring career came to a close. As manager to such top stars as [[Gorilla Monsoon]], [[The Fabulous Kangaroos]] and [[Bull Ramos]], Berry was not above using his signature cane as a weapon.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Professional wrestling career ==
Berry started off as a [[Boxing|boxer]] in 1923, eventually winning the Kansas State Middleweight Championship. After breaking both of his hands, he decided to change his sport to [[professional wrestling]].&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt;&lt;ref name=dead/&gt; His first recorded match was in 1926 but wrestled at carnivals prior to that date.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; By 1937, he had won his first title, the [[National Wrestling Association]]'s [[World Light Heavyweight Championship (National Wrestling Association)|World Light Heavyweight Championship]]. Berry held the World Light Heavyweight Championship nine times between 1937 and 1947,&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt; trading it often with [[Danny McShain]]. Berry and McShain feuded for years in Southern California.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt;

In 1947, Berry suffered an arm injury and infection that made him sit out for a year.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; After the advent of the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA) in 1948, he held several regional championships for NWA member promotions, including the [[NWA Texas Heavyweight Championship]] twice in 1949, the NWA Arkansas Junior Heavyweight Championship in 1954, and the [[NWA Central States Heavyweight Championship]] in 1952 and 1957.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrestling-titles.com Wrestling-Titles.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In his [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feuds]], Berry usually played the [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]], or villain, except in his hometown of Pittsburg, where he was well-beloved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpol.net/tonyd/wildred2.htm Earl Morey, "Memories Will Linger About Local Wild Man", ''The Pittsburg Headlight-Sun'', July 24, 1973]&lt;/ref&gt;

Berry began managing wrestlers in 1958, including [[The Fabulous Kangaroos]] ([[Al Costello]] and [[Roy Heffernan]]).&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt;&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; He also managed [[Hans Mortier|Hans "The Great" Mortier]].&lt;ref name=slam&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/2010/05/31/14197786.html|title="Wild" Red Berry was the mouth that roared|author=Johnson, Steven|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=2010-06-03|date=June 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was often seen at ringside wearing a warm up jacket with the phrase, "I am Right" emblazoned on the back. When The Fabulous Kangaroos were feuding with The Scufflin' Hillbillies in the northeast, Hillbillies manager "Cousin alfred" appeared with a jacket that said "He's Wrong!" on the back.

Berry was also the manager of [[Gorilla Monsoon]] from 1963 to 1969 during Monsoon's heel days. He would speak for Monsoon in [[Promo (professional wrestling)|promos]], because Monsoon's character was a [[Muteness|mute]] from [[Manchuria]] ([[kayfabe]]) and took Monsoon and [[Killer Kowalski]] to the World Wide Wrestling Federation's (WWWF, now [[WWE]]) [[WWWF United States Tag Team Championship|United States Tag Team Championship]]. Berry also managed Monsoon in a series of matches against [[WWE World Championship|WWWF World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Bruno Sammartino]] during the Monsoon-Sammartino feud. In 1969, when Monsoon [[Turn (professional wrestling)|turned]] into a [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]], he dropped Berry as his manager.

Berry was inducted into the Wrestling Hall of Fame in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] in 1972. In 1996, Berry was inducted into the [[Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame]].

== Personal life ==
Berry dropped out of school at age 12 to work in a coal mine to support his family.&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt;&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; He had two younger siblings.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt;

Outside the ring, Berry was active in Pittsburg political circles. He was elected Parks Commissioner once.&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt; He also twice served as acting mayor.  He also tried acting on at least one occasion, appearing in the 1953 film ''My Wife's Best Friend''. He was also in the episode "Well Oiled" of ''[[The Abbott and Costello Show]]'' as "Wild" Red Berry, but is credited as Red Barry.&lt;ref name=dead/&gt;&lt;ref name=abb&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0857436/ "The Abbott and Costello Show", ''IMDb'', 09/09/2011]&lt;/ref&gt; In his later life, he was both an active [[Freemasonry|Mason]] and [[Shriners|Shriner]].&lt;ref name=dead/&gt;

A year and a half before he died, Berry suffered a stroke which inhibited his ability to speak.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; In 1973, he died of a heart attack.&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt; A species of ''[[Echinopsis]]'', developed by Bob Schick, was named after Berry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huntington.org/BotanicalDiv/Schick/hybrids/wild_red_berry.html 'Wild Red Berry' page from the 1996-2004 Schick Hybrids Catalog]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a softball field in Pittsburg is named after Berry.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt;

Berry also appeared on an episode of ''You Bet Your Life'' with [[Groucho Marx]] as a contestant where he and his partner won $1000.&lt;ref&gt;''You Bet Your Life''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pringle followed ''Science Fiction'' with ''[[Modern Fantasy: The 100 Best Novels]]'' (1988).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pringle, David|title=Modern Fantasy: The 100 Best Novels|publisher= [[Grafton Books]] |date=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xanadu followed ''Science Fiction'' with at least three more "100 Best" books ([[#100 Best series|below]]).

==Scope==

In the introduction Pringle offers the working definition, "Science fiction is a form of fantastic fiction which exploits the imaginative perspectives of modern science." In turn, modern science is the "scientific world-view ... as it has come to be accepted by the intelligent layperson", which arguably "first became common property in the mid to late 19th century."&lt;ref&gt;''Science Fiction'', 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within fantastic fiction he distinguishes science fiction from "[[Horror fiction|Supernatural Horror]]" and "[[Heroic fantasy|Heroic Fantasy]]". They may be represented by ''[[Dracula]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', featuring "the irruption of some supernatural force into the everyday world" and "set in completely imaginary worlds" respectively. He also names the subclass "Fabulations", which do not belong in this book "unless they have a significant scientific or technological content".&lt;ref&gt;''Science Fiction'', 11, 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=NB&gt;Example fabulations are Brian Aldiss, ''[[The Malacia Tapestry]]'' (1976) and John Crowley, ''Little, Big'' (1981). Pringle's subsequent book ''Modern Fantasy: The 100 Best Novels'' (1988) covers both of those works and its introduction adds the "Fabulation" category more formally. Briefly, in a fabulation the real world setting is distorted "in ways other than the supernaturally horrific" (''Modern Fantasy'', 19).&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, science fiction has a real world setting and "fantastic developments which are explicable in terms of the scientific world-view." World-view does not mean accepted theory or fact: "many sf writers cheat: they use sleight-of-hand rather than genuine scientific knowledge." "The skilful use of [[pseudoscience|pseudo-science]] and gobbledygook" may be good enough to exploit the world-view.&lt;ref&gt;''Science Fiction'', 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The time period covered is approximately that for science fiction as a category of book publication, although the selected books were not all published in that category.&lt;ref&gt;''Science Fiction'', 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pringle admits that fewer than thirty selections may generously be called even "masterpieces ''of their sort''". On the whole,&lt;ref&gt;''Science Fiction'', 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Some of them are old favourites of my own ... Some are other people's favourites, novels which have been outstandingly popular or influential, or which seem to be especially good representatives of their type. A small minority, perhaps as many as ten, are books for which I have little or no personal enthusiasm: they have been included for the sake of balance and variety.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==100 Best series==

Xanadu Publications of London published at least four "100 Best" books.&lt;!-- Fantasy back dustjacket blurbs Horror and lists the other two "previously available"; dates from ISFDB --&gt; Transatlantic editions or simply jacket and cover designs&lt;!-- or simply WorldCat library cataloguing conventions --&gt; may variably use "the" and "hundred" in the subtitles. [[Carroll &amp; Graf]] published the books in the U.S.

* ''Science Fiction: The 100 Best Novels'', by David Pringle (1985), foreword by Michael Moorcock
* ''Crime and Mystery: The 100 Best Books'', by [[H.R.F. Keating]] (1987), foreword by [[Patricia Highsmith]]
* ''Horror: The 100 Best Books'', edited by [[Stephen Jones (author)|Stephen Jones]] and [[Kim Newman]] (November 1988)
* ''Fantasy: The 100 Best Books'', by [[James Cawthorn]] and Michael Moorcock (November 1988)

Xanadu commissioned Moorcock to write ''Fantasy''. When it became "clear that I would not be able to deliver it for a long time, the publishers and I agreed that James Cawthorn was the person to take it over." Cawthorn was the primary author of the selections "mainly", according to Cawthorn, and of the text "by far", according to Moorcock. (''Fantasy'', "Introduction", p.&amp;nbsp;9. The introduction, pp.&amp;nbsp;8–10, comprises a long section signed by Cawthorn, a short one signed by Moorcock, and joint unsigned "Notes and Acknowledgments".)

''Science Fiction'' is a collection of 100 reviews, nearly uniform in length (all one to two pages), with a moderately long introduction by the author.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pl.cgi?29203 ''Science Fiction''. First edition contents at ISFDB.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Horror'' comprises essays on 100 different books by 100(?) horror writers, apparently more-than-one- to less-than-six pages in length.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pl.cgi?297925 ''Horror''. First edition contents at ISFDB.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fantasy'' is a collection of 100 reviews, nearly uniform in length (little short of two pages), with a short introduction by the authors separately and jointly.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pl.cgi?187153 ''Fantasy''. Carroll &amp; Graf, 1991, contents at ISFDB. Pagination matches the 1st Carroll &amp; Graf edition; page-counts match the Xanadu editions.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adaptive Behavior (2014): 1059712314528009. {{doi|10.1177/1059712314528009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;). The main goal is to control a large number of [[robot]]s (with limited sensing/processing ability) to accomplish a common task/problem. Hardware limitation and cost of robot platforms limit current research in swarm robotics to mostly performed by simulation software (e.g. Stage,&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, Richard. "[http://autonomylab.org/doc/vaughan_si08.pdf Massively multi-robot simulation in stage]". Swarm Intelligence 2.2-4 (2008): 189-208.&lt;/ref&gt; ARGoS&lt;ref&gt;Pinciroli, Carlo, et al.

IEEE, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;). On the other hand, simulation of swarm scenarios that needs large numbers of agents is extremely complex and often inaccurate due to poor modelling of external conditions and limitation of computation.

'''''The American Card Catalog''''' is a reference book for American trade cards produced before 1951, compiled by [[Jefferson Burdick]].

It has become the ''de facto'' method in identifying and organizing trade cards produced in the [[Americas]] pre-1951.  The book catalogues sports and non-sports cards, but is best known for its categorization of [[baseball card]]s. Sets like 1909-11 White Borders, 1910 Philadelphia Caramel’s, and 1909 Box Tops are most commonly referred to by their ACC catalogue numbers.  They are, respectively, [[T206]], E95, and W555.

The following is a list of card classifications in which baseball cards are found.  Two examples of each type have been listed.
