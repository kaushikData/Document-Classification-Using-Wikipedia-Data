'''AACE International''' (Association for the Advancement of [[Cost engineering|Cost Engineering]]) was founded in 1956 by 59 cost estimators and cost engineers during the organizational meeting of the [[American Association of Cost Engineering]] at the [[University of New Hampshire]] in [[Durham, New Hampshire|Durham]], [[New Hampshire]].  AACE International Headquarters is located in [[Morgantown, West Virginia|Morgantown]], [[West Virginia]], USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Amos|first=Jennie|title=The Rich History of AACE International|journal=Cost Engineering|date=July 2005|volume=47|issue=7|pages=5–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; AACE is a [[501(c)(3)]] non-profit professional association. AACE International is a member of the Board of the Council of Engineering and Scientific Specialty Boards (CESB).

== Activities ==
AACE is a non-profit organization with about 15 employees at its headquarters in Morgantown, WV.    A variety of other organizations  in the United States provide similar certifications,  often specialized for particular industries, such as power, manufacturing, gas and oil.

AACE is the publisher of ''Cost Engineering'', a bi-monthly technical journal, ''Skills and Knowledge of Cost Engineering'' (currently in its 6th edition), Source magazine (a bi-monthly magazine), 20 different AACE International ''Professional Practice Guides'', approximately 80 Recommended Practices, and its most comprehensive publication, the ''[[Total Cost Management]] Framework: An Integrated Approach to Portfolio, Program and Project Management''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.aacei.org/resources/publications|title=Publications|website=web.aacei.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Certification programs==
AACE currently manages eight [[certification]] programs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.aacei.org/certification/certifications-offered|title=Certifications Offered|website=web.aacei.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;, as  listed below. All require agreeing to adhere to a canons of ethics, and passing an examination. Most require prior industry experience, and also involve recertification by continuing education or reexamination.  

*''Certified Cost Technician'' (formerly known as Interim Cost Consultant), an entry-level certification and is not eligible for renewal
*''Certified Scheduling Technician'', an entry level certification
*''Certified Cost Professional (formerly Certified Cost Consultant / Certified Cost Engineer),'' which additionally requires a technical paper submission 
*''Certified Estimating Professional'' 
*''Certified Forensic Claims Consultant'', which has additional requirements, including submission of a publication
*''Decision &amp; Risk Management Professional''
*''Earned Value Professional''
*''Planning &amp; Scheduling Professional''

Since becoming a charter member of the Council of Engineering and Scientific Specialty Boards in 1990, six of its certification programs (CCP, CCT, CEP, CST, EVP and PSP) have been accredited by the CESB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.aacei.org/certification/accreditation-annual-reports|title=Accreditation Annual Reports|website=web.aacei.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Membership==
As of 2012, AACE reported over 8,000 members. To network in local areas, there are over 80 local sections located in 80 countries.  There are also 11 technical sub-committees and 17 special interest groups.

An '''agent-based model''' ('''ABM''') is a class of [[computational models]] for [[computer simulation|simulating]] the actions and interactions of autonomous agents (both individual or collective entities such as organizations or groups) with a view to assessing their effects on the system as a whole. It combines elements of [[game theory]], [[complex systems]], [[emergence]], [[computational sociology]], [[multi-agent system]]s, and [[evolutionary programming]]. [[Monte Carlo method]]s are used to introduce randomness.  Particularly within ecology, ABMs are also called '''individual-based models''' ('''IBMs'''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grimm |first1=Volker |first2=Steven F. |last2=Railsback |title=Individual-based Modeling and Ecology |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2005 |pages=485 |isbn=978-0-691-09666-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and individuals within IBMs may be simpler than fully autonomous agents within ABMs. A review of recent literature on individual-based models, agent-based models, and multiagent systems shows that ABMs are used on non-computing related scientific domains including [[biology]], ecology and [[social science]].&lt;ref name="Niazi-Hussain"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Muaz |last1=Niazi |first2=Amir |last2=Hussain |year=2011 |title=Agent-based Computing from Multi-agent Systems to Agent-Based Models: A Visual Survey |journal=Scientometrics |volume=89 |issue=2 |pages=479–499 |doi=10.1007/s11192-011-0468-9 |url=http://cecosm.yolasite.com/resources/Accepted_Scientometrics_ABM_Website.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012005027/http://cecosm.yolasite.com/resources/Accepted_Scientometrics_ABM_Website.pdf |archivedate=October 12, 2013 |deadurl=yes|arxiv=1708.05872 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Agent-based modeling is related to, but distinct from, the concept of '''[[multi-agent system]]s''' or '''multi-agent simulation''' in that the goal of ABM is to search for explanatory insight into the collective behavior of agents obeying simple rules, typically in natural systems, rather than in designing agents or solving specific practical or engineering problems.&lt;ref name="Niazi-Hussain"/&gt;

Agent-based models are a kind of [[Microscale and macroscale models|microscale model]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Leif |last1=Gustafsson |first2=Mikael |last2=Sternad |year=2010 |title=Consistent micro, macro, and state-based population modelling |journal=Mathematical Biosciences |volume=225 |issue=2 |pages=94–107 |doi=10.1016/j.mbs.2010.02.003 |pmid=20171974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that simulate the simultaneous operations and interactions of multiple agents in an attempt to re-create and predict the appearance of complex phenomena. The process is one of [[emergence]] from the lower (micro) level of systems to a higher (macro) level. As such, a key notion is that simple behavioral rules generate complex behavior. This principle, known as [[KISS principle|K.I.S.S.]] ("Keep it simple, stupid"), is extensively adopted in the modeling community. Another central tenet is that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.  Individual agents are typically characterized as boundedly rational, presumed to be acting in what they perceive as their own interests, such as reproduction, economic benefit, or social status,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://policy.rutgers.edu/andrews/projects/abm/abmarticle.htm |title=Agent-Based Models of Industrial Ecosystems |publisher=[[Rutgers University]] |date=October 6, 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720041914/http://policy.rutgers.edu/andrews/projects/abm/abmarticle.htm |archivedate=July 20, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; using heuristics or simple decision-making rules. ABM agents may experience "learning", adaptation, and reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/99/suppl_3/7280 |title=Agent-based modeling: Methods and techniques for simulating human systems |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=99 |pages=7280–7 |date=May 14, 2002 |doi=10.1073/pnas.082080899 |pmid=12011407 |pmc=128598 |last1=Bonabeau |first1=E. |bibcode=2002PNAS...99.7280B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most agent-based models are composed of: (1) numerous agents specified at various scales (typically referred to as agent-granularity); (2) decision-making heuristics; (3) learning rules or adaptive processes; (4) an interaction topology; and (5) an environment. ABMs are typically implemented as [[computer simulation]]s, either as custom software, or via ABM toolkits, and this software can be then used to test how changes in individual behaviors will affect the system's emerging overall behavior.

==History==
The idea of agent-based modeling was developed as a relatively simple concept in the late 1940s. Since it requires computation-intensive procedures, it did not become widespread until the 1990s.

===Early developments===
The history of the agent-based model can be traced back to the [[Von Neumann universal constructor|Von Neumann machine]], a theoretical machine capable of reproduction. The device [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]] proposed would follow precisely detailed instructions to fashion a copy of itself. The concept was then built upon by von Neumann's friend [[Stanislaw Ulam]], also a mathematician; Ulam suggested that the machine be built on paper, as a collection of cells on a grid. The idea intrigued von Neumann, who drew it up—creating the first of the devices later termed [[cellular automata]].
Another advance was introduced by the mathematician [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]].  He constructed the well-known [[Conway's Game of Life|Game of Life]]. Unlike von Neumann's machine, Conway's Game of Life operated by tremendously simple rules in a virtual world in the form of a 2-dimensional [[checkerboard]].

===1970s and 1980s: the first models===

One of the earliest agent-based models in concept was [[Thomas Schelling]]'s segregation model,&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schelling |first=Thomas C. |title=Dynamic Models of Segregation |year=1971 |journal=Journal of Mathematical Sociology |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=143–186 |url=http://zolaist.org/wiki/images/c/cf/Models_of_Segregation.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1080/0022250x.1971.9989794}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was discussed in his paper "Dynamic Models of Segregation" in 1971.  Though Schelling originally used coins and graph paper rather than computers, his models embodied the basic concept of agent-based models as autonomous agents interacting in a shared environment with an observed aggregate, emergent outcome.

In the early 1980s, [[Robert Axelrod]] hosted a tournament of [[Prisoner's Dilemma]] strategies and had them interact in an agent-based manner to determine a winner.  Axelrod would go on to develop many other agent-based models in the field of political science that examine phenomena from [[ethnocentrism]] to the dissemination of culture.&lt;ref name="Axelrod_1997"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Axelrod |given=Robert |authorlink=Robert Axelrod |year=1997 |title=The Complexity of Cooperation: Agent-Based Models of Competition and Collaboration |publisher=Princeton: Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-01567-5 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;
By the late 1980s, [[Craig Reynolds (computer graphics)|Craig Reynolds]]' work on [[flocking behavior|flocking]] models contributed to the development of some of the first biological agent-based models that contained social characteristics. He tried to model the reality of lively biological agents, known as [[artificial life]], a term coined by [[Christopher Langton]].

The first use of the word "agent" and a definition as it is currently used today is hard to track down.  One candidate appears to be [[John Henry Holland|John Holland]] and John H. Miller's 1991 paper "Artificial Adaptive Agents in Economic Theory",&lt;ref name="Holland"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Holland |first1=J.H. |last2=Miller |first2=J.H. |title=Artificial Adaptive Agents in Economic Theory |year=1991 |journal=American Economic Review |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=365–71 |url=http://zia.hss.cmu.edu/miller/papers/aaa.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051027152415/http://zia.hss.cmu.edu/miller/papers/aaa.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-10-27 |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; based on an earlier conference presentation of theirs.

At the same time, during the 1980s, social scientists, mathematicians, operations researchers, and a scattering of people from other disciplines developed Computational and Mathematical Organization Theory (CMOT).  This field grew as a special interest group of The Institute of Management Sciences (TIMS) and its sister society, the Operations Research Society of America (ORSA).

===1990s: expansion===
With the appearance of StarLogo in 1990, [[Swarm (simulation)|Swarm]] and [[NetLogo]] in the mid-1990s and [[Repast (modeling toolkit)|RePast]] and [[AnyLogic]] in 2000, or GAMA&lt;ref&gt;[http://gama-platform.org/ GAMA]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2007 as well as some custom-designed code, modelling software became widely available and the range of domains that ABM was applied to, grew.  Bonabeau (2002) is a good survey of the potential of agent-based modeling as of the time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bonabeau |first=Eric |title=Agent-based modeling: methods and techniques for simulating human systems |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=99 |issue=3 |pages=7280–7287 |year=2002 |doi=10.1073/pnas.082080899 |bibcode=2002PNAS...99.7280B |pmid=12011407 |pmc=128598}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1990s were especially notable for the expansion of ABM within the social sciences, one notable effort was the large-scale ABM, [[Sugarscape]], developed by
[[Joshua M. Epstein]] and [[Robert Axtell]] to simulate and explore the role of social phenomena such as seasonal migrations, pollution, sexual reproduction, combat, and transmission of disease and even culture.&lt;ref name="GAS"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Joshua M. |last1=Epstein |authorlink1=Joshua M. Epstein |first2=Robert |last2=Axtell |authorlink2=Robert Axtell |title=Growing artificial societies: social science from the bottom up |publisher=Brookings Institution Press |date=October 11, 1996 |pages=224 |isbn=978-0-262-55025-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable 1990s developments included [[Carnegie Mellon University]]'s [[Kathleen Carley]] ABM,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/projects/construct/index.php |title=Construct |publisher=Computational Analysis of Social Organizational Systems |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to explore the co-evolution of social networks and culture.
During this 1990s timeframe [[Nigel Gilbert]] published the first textbook on Social Simulation: Simulation for the social scientist (1999) and established a journal from the perspective of social sciences: the ''[[Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation]]'' (JASSS). Other than JASSS, agent-based models of any discipline are within scope of SpringerOpen journal ''[[Complex Adaptive Systems Modeling]]'' (CASM).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casmodeling.com Springer Complex Adaptive Systems Modeling Journal (CASM)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the mid-1990s, the social sciences thread of ABM began to focus on such issues as designing effective teams, understanding the communication required for organizational effectiveness, and the behavior of social networks.  CMOT—later renamed Computational Analysis of Social and Organizational Systems (CASOS)—incorporated more and more agent-based modeling.  Samuelson (2000) is a good brief overview of the early history,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Samuelson |first=Douglas A. |title=Designing Organizations |journal=OR/MS Today |date=December 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Samuelson (2005) and Samuelson and Macal (2006) trace the more recent developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Samuelson |first=Douglas A. |title=Agents of Change |journal=OR/MS Today |date=February 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.orms-today.org/orms-8-06/fragent.html |last1=Samuelson |first1=Douglas A. |last2=Macal |first2=Charles M. |title=Agent-Based Modeling Comes of Age |journal=OR/MS Today |date=August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, the merger of TIMS and ORSA to form [[INFORMS]], and the move by INFORMS from two meetings each year to one, helped to spur the CMOT group to form a separate society, the North American Association for Computational Social and Organizational Sciences (NAACSOS).  Kathleen Carley was a major contributor, especially to models of social networks, obtaining [[National Science Foundation]] funding for the annual conference and serving as the first President of NAACSOS.  She was succeeded by David Sallach of the [[University of Chicago]] and [[Argonne National Laboratory]], and then by Michael Prietula&lt;ref&gt;[http://goizueta.emory.edu/faculty/academic_areas/isom/prietula_michael.html Michael Prietula]&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Emory University]]. At about the same time NAACSOS began, the [[European Social Simulation Association]] (ESSA) and the Pacific Asian Association for Agent-Based Approach in Social Systems Science (PAAA), counterparts of NAACSOS, were organized.  As of 2013, these three organizations collaborate internationally.  The First World Congress on Social Simulation was held under their joint sponsorship in Kyoto, Japan, in August 2006.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} The Second World Congress was held in the northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C., in July 2008, with [[George Mason University]] taking the lead role in local arrangements.

===2000s and later===

More recently, [[Ron Sun]] developed methods for basing agent-based simulation on models of human cognition, known as [[cognitive social simulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sun |first=Ron |authorlink=Ron Sun |title=Cognition and Multi-Agent Interaction: From Cognitive Modeling to Social Simulation |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2006 |url=http://www.cambridge.org/uk/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0-521-83964-5 |isbn=978-0-521-83964-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill McKelvey, Suzanne Lohmann, Dario Nardi, Dwight Read and others at [[UCLA]] have also made significant contributions in organizational behavior and decision-making.  Since 2001, UCLA has arranged a conference at Lake Arrowhead, California, that has become another major gathering point for practitioners in this field.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} In 2014, Sadegh Asgari from [[Columbia University]] and his colleagues developed an agent-based model of the construction competitive bidding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Developing a Virtual Laboratory for Construction Bidding Environment Using Agent-Based Modeling |journal=Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering |date=2014-10-06 |pages=04014105 |volume=29 |issue=6 |doi=10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000440 |first=R. |last=Awwad |first2=S. |last2=Asgari |first3=A. |last3=Kandil}}&lt;/ref&gt; While his model was used to analyze the low-bid lump-sum construction bids, it could be applied to other bidding methods with little modifications to the model.

==Theory==
Most computational modeling research describes systems in [[Steady state|equilibrium]] or as moving between equilibria. Agent-based modeling, however, using simple rules, can result in different sorts of complex and interesting behavior.  The three ideas central to agent-based models are agents as objects, [[emergence]], and [[complexity]].

Agent-based models consist of dynamically interacting rule-based agents. The systems within which they interact can create real-world-like complexity.  Typically agents are
[[situated]] in space and time and reside in networks or in lattice-like neighborhoods. The location of the agents and their responsive behavior are encoded in [[algorithm]]ic form in computer programs.  In some cases, though not always, the agents may be considered as intelligent and purposeful.  In ecological ABM (often referred to as "individual-based models" in ecology), agents may, for example, be trees in forest, and would not be considered intelligent, although they may be "purposeful" in the sense of optimizing access to a resource (such as water).
The modeling process is best described as [[inductive reasoning|inductive]]. The modeler makes those assumptions thought most relevant to the situation at hand and then watches phenomena emerge from the agents' interactions. Sometimes that result is an equilibrium. Sometimes it is an emergent pattern. Sometimes, however, it is an unintelligible mangle.

In some ways, agent-based models complement traditional analytic methods. Where analytic methods enable humans to characterize the equilibria of a system, agent-based models allow the possibility of generating those equilibria. This generative contribution may be the most mainstream of the potential benefits of agent-based modeling. Agent-based models can explain the emergence of higher-order patterns—network structures of terrorist organizations and the Internet, [[power-law distributions]] in the sizes of traffic jams, wars, and stock-market crashes, and social segregation that persists despite populations of tolerant people. Agent-based models also can be used to identify lever points, defined as moments in time in which interventions have extreme consequences, and to distinguish among types of path dependency.

Rather than focusing on stable states, many models consider a system's robustness—the ways that complex systems adapt to internal and external pressures so as to maintain their functionalities. The task of harnessing that complexity requires consideration of the agents themselves—their diversity, connectedness, and level of interactions.

===Framework===
Recent work on the Modeling and simulation of Complex Adaptive Systems has demonstrated the need for combining agent-based and complex network based models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Aditya Kurve |author2=Khashayar Kotobi |author3=George Kesidis |title=An agent-based framework for performance modeling of an optimistic parallel discrete event simulator |journal=Complex Adaptive Systems Modeling |volume=1 |pages=12 |doi=10.1186/2194-3206-1-12 |year=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Muaz A.

# Complex Network Modeling Level for developing models using interaction data of various system components.
# Exploratory Agent-based Modeling Level for developing agent-based models for assessing the feasibility of further research. This can e.g. be useful for developing proof-of-concept models such as for funding applications without requiring an extensive learning curve for the researchers.
# Descriptive Agent-based Modeling (DREAM) for developing descriptions of agent-based models by means of using templates and complex network-based models. Building DREAM models allows model comparison across scientific disciplines.

===Organizational ABM: agent-directed simulation===

The agent-directed simulation (ADS) metaphor distinguishes between two categories, namely "Systems for Agents" and "Agents for Systems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eng.auburn.edu/~yilmaz/ADS.html |title=Agent-Directed Simulation |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Systems for Agents (sometimes referred to as agents systems) are systems implementing agents for the use in engineering, human and social dynamics, military applications, and others. Agents for Systems are divided in two subcategories. Agent-supported systems deal with the use of agents as a support facility to enable computer assistance in problem solving or enhancing cognitive capabilities. Agent-based systems focus on the use of agents for the generation of model behavior in a system evaluation (system studies and analyses).

==Implementation==

Many agent-based modeling software are designed for serial [[Von Neumann architecture|von-Neumann computer architectures]]. This limits the speed and scalability of these systems. A recent development is the use of data-parallel algorithms on Graphics Processing Units [[GPU]]s for ABM simulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Isaac Rudomin |url=https://sites.google.com/site/rudominisaac/shader-agents |title=Large Crowds in the GPU |year=2006 |publisher=[[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education]] |accessdate=|display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111054342/https://sites.google.com/site/rudominisaac/shader-agents |archivedate=January 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Roshan M. |last=D'Souza |url=http://www.me.mtu.edu/~rmdsouza/ABM_GPU.html |title=Mega-Scale Interactive Agent-Based Model Simulations on the GPU |publisher=[[Michigan Technological University]] |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Paul |last1=Richmond |first2=Daniela M. |last2=Romano |url=http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~daniela/Paul_abgpu_IWSV_2008.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090115220835/http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~daniela/Paul_abgpu_IWSV_2008.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 15, 2009 |format=PDF |title=Agent Based GPU, a Real-time 3D Simulation and Interactive Visualisation Framework for Massive Agent Based Modelling on the GPU |journal=Proceedings International Workshop on Super Visualisation (IWSV08) |year=2008 |accessdate=April 27, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The extreme memory bandwidth combined with the sheer number crunching power of multi-processor GPUs has enabled simulation of millions of agents at tens of frames per second.

==Verification and validation==
[[Verification and validation]] (V&amp;V) of simulation models is extremely important.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Sargent |first1=R.

As an example of V&amp;V technique, consider VOMAS (virtual overlay multi-agent system),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Muaz |last1=Niazi |first2=Amir |last2=Hussain |first3=Mario |last3=Kolberg |title=Verification and Validation of Agent-Based Simulations using the VOMAS approach |journal=Proceedings of the Third Workshop on Multi-Agent Systems and Simulation '09 (MASS '09), as Part of MALLOW 09, Sep 7–11, 2009, Torino, Italy |url=http://www.cs.stir.ac.uk/~man/papers/VOMAS_CRV_aug_05_09_Muazv2.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614052017/http://www.cs.stir.ac.uk/~man/papers/VOMAS_CRV_aug_05_09_Muazv2.pdf |archivedate=June 14, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; a software engineering based approach, where a virtual overlay multi-agent system is developed alongside the agent-based model. The agents in the multi-agent system are able to gather data by generation of logs as well as provide run-time validation and verification support by watch agents and also agents to check any violation of invariants at run-time. These are set by the Simulation Specialist with help from the SME ([[subject-matter expert]]). Muazi et al. also provide an example of using VOMAS for verification and validation of a forest fire simulation model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Muaz |last1=Niazi |first2=Qasim |last2=Siddique |first3=Amir |last3=Hussain |first4=Mario |last4=Kolberg |title=Verification &amp; Validation of an Agent-Based Forest Fire Simulation Model |journal=Proceedings of the Agent Directed Simulation Symposium 2010, as Part of the ACM SCS Spring Simulation Multiconference |pages=142–149 |date=April 11–15, 2010 |url=http://cs.stir.ac.uk/~man/papers/2_ADS_09_Final_Paper.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725083937/http://cs.stir.ac.uk/~man/papers/2_ADS_09_Final_Paper.pdf |archivedate=July 25, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VOMAS provides a formal way of validation and verification. To develop a VOMAS, one must design VOMAS agents along with the agents in the actual simulation, preferably from the start. In essence, by the time the simulation model is complete, one can essentially consider it to be one model containing two models:
# An agent-based model of the intended system
# An agent-based model of the VOMAS

Unlike all previous work on verification and validation, VOMAS agents ensure that the simulations are validated in-simulation i.e. even during execution. In case of any exceptional situations, which are programmed on the directive of the Simulation Specialist (SS), the VOMAS agents can report them. In addition, the VOMAS agents can be used to log key events for the sake of debugging and subsequent analysis of simulations. In other words, VOMAS allows for a flexible use of any given technique for the sake of verification and validation of an agent-based model in any domain.

Details of validated agent-based modeling using VOMAS along with several case studies are given in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Muaz A. K. |last=Niazi |title=Towards A Novel Unified Framework for Developing Formal, Network and Validated Agent-Based Simulation Models of Complex Adaptive Systems |date=June 11, 2011 |publisher=[[University of Stirling]]|hdl=1893/3365 }} PhD Thesis&lt;/ref&gt; This thesis also gives details of "exploratory agent-based modeling", "descriptive agent-based modeling" and "validated agent-based modeling", using several worked case study examples.

===Complex systems modelling===

Mathematical models of complex systems are of three types: [[black-box]] (phenomenological), [[White box (software engineering)|white-box]] (mechanistic, based on the [[first principles]]) and [[Grey box model|grey-box]] (mixtures of phenomenological and mechanistic models).&lt;ref name="Kalmykov Lev V., Kalmykov Vyacheslav L.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In black-box models, the individual-based (mechanistic) mechanisms of a complex dynamic system remain hidden. [[File:Mathematical models for complex systems.jpg|thumb|Mathematical models for complex systems]] Black-box models are completely nonmechanistic. They are phenomenological and ignore a composition and internal structure of a complex system. We cannot investigate interactions of subsystems of such a non-transparent model. A white-box model of complex dynamic system has ‘transparent walls’ and directly shows underlying mechanisms. All events at micro-, meso- and macro-levels of a dynamic system are directly visible at all stages of its white-box model evolution. In most cases mathematical modelers use the heavy black-box mathematical methods, which cannot produce mechanistic models of complex dynamic systems. Grey-box models are intermediate and combine black-box and white-box approaches. [[File:Logical deterministic individual-based cellular automata model of single species population growth.gif|thumb|Logical deterministic individual-based cellular automata model of single species population growth]] Creation of a white-box model of complex system is associated with the problem of the necessity of an a priori basic knowledge of the modeling subject. The deterministic logical [[Cellular automaton|cellular automata]] are necessary but not sufficient condition of a white-box model. The second necessary prerequisite of a white-box model is the presence of the physical [[ontology]] of the object under study. The white-box modeling represents an automatic hyper-logical inference from the [[first principle]]s because it is completely based on the deterministic logic and axiomatic theory of the subject. The purpose of the white-box modeling is to derive from the basic axioms a more detailed, more concrete mechanistic knowledge about the dynamics of the object under study. The necessity to formulate an intrinsic [[axiomatic system]] of the subject before creating its white-box model distinguishes the cellular automata models of white-box type from cellular automata models based on arbitrary logical rules. If cellular automata rules have not been formulated from the first principles of the subject, then such a model may have a weak relevance to the real problem.&lt;ref name="Kalmykov Lev V., Kalmykov Vyacheslav L. White-box model" /&gt;

'''Authoritarian literature''' &lt;ref&gt;Gardner, John. ''The Art of Fiction''. New York: Random House 1983. Vintage Books ed. New York: Random House 1991. pp. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; is a term used by [[John Gardner (novelist)|John Gardner]] to designate the body of literature written by persons living under an [[authoritarian]] governmental regime. Literary works produced in these regimes share common characteristics that make the designation useful. Authoritarian regimes revere their leaders, who historically were typically referred to as kings, along with advisors to the king. These leaders were considered innately better than ordinary people. The authoritarian leader, and his approved circle, if not directly writing about a subject themselves, were the only ones who could designate, approve, and sanction writers as acceptable authorities. Government authorities also financially supported writers under a [[patronage]] system. The writers in such a system therefore must necessarily be careful to ensure the composition of their work met (or would meet) the approval of authorities. Failure to comply risked official warnings, loss of governmental sanction, and sometimes even imprisonment or loss of life.

Fiction produced under authoritarian regimes tends to be didactic. Subject matter can vary in terms of plot, but the didactic point of the work is almost always to illustrate what authorities would consider the proper comportment of individuals within the authoritarian society. This didactic point is conveyed to readers in order to idealize the existing social structure and thus, hopefully, perpetuate it. Authoritarian fiction is considered to be demonstrative in purpose rather than explorative. The author's narrative voice is also usually authoritarian in order to impart something known by the author that is presumably not known by the reader. Since most people don't enjoy and resist being spoken to as an inferior, the more successful (or popular) authors of such literature are the ones who best disguise, or sugarcoat, their didactic purpose. One common way to achieve such indirectness is through the use of the form [[allegory]].

==Examples==

Good examples of authoritarian literature include ''[[Beowulf]]'', ''[[Pilgrim's Progress]]'', and in [[English literature]] we see vestiges as late as [[Charles Dickens]]. While didacticism forms a significant component of [[George Bernard Shaw|Shaw]]'s, [[George Orwell|Orwell]]'s and [[C. S. Lewis]]' fiction as well, their works can not strictly be considered as authoritarian literature because they were not writing at the whim of political leaders. Dickens was not writing for the British government either, but he used the same forms of his predecessors, who did write for the court, particularly in his earlier novels, such as ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' and ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'', where we most easily observe a certain preachiness. Dickens constructed his plots for the sake of demonstration rather than the purpose of exploration. However, Charles Dickens is a transitional figure, and in his later novels, such as ''[[Great Expectations]]'', we can "feel the two impulses warring in the writer's mind".&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, John. ''The Art of Fiction''. New York: Random House 1983. Vintage Books ed. New York: Random House 1991. pp. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary Works==

Authoritarian literature is, of course, not a purely historical phenomenon. It persists as the dominant form of everyday literature of [[Middle East]]ern countries ([[Turkey]], [[Israel]], [[Lebanon]], and arguably [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Iran]]'s literature excepted), and, until recently, [[Chinese literature]]. To understand the nature of authoritarian literature's purpose is to better understand the reason for the forms in which we see literature currently being produced in these countries.

The antithesis to Authoritarian literature is Anti-Authoritarian literature. Practitioners of this genre in the aforementioned countries are routinely subjected to harsh sanctions, and many choose to go into exile in order to write freely. Still other writers suffer censorship and imprisonment at their government's hands (e.g. [[Sunallah Ibrahim]] and [[Abdul Rahman Munif]]). Authoritarian literature authors, however, who write works of fiction that support or praise governments, as expected, often see promotion to positions of authority within their respective country's governing cultural body

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1835">'''The Bernard Revel Graduate School of Jewish Studies''' was [[Yeshiva University]]’s first graduate school. Founded in 1937, it was named for Yeshiva University's first president, [[Bernard Revel]]. Its curriculum prepares highly trained teachers, researchers, and scholars in Jewish studies and emphasizes the critical analysis of primary sources, studies in methodology, and extensive readings in secondary literature.

[[Arthur Hyman]] was replaced as Revel’s dean by [[David Berger (professor)|David Berger]], though he maintains the position of Distinguished Service Professor of Philosophy.

== Academics ==
The School offers the following degree programs:
* M.A. in Bible, Medieval Jewish History, Modern Jewish history, Jewish Philosophy, and Talmudic Studies
* Ph.D. in Jewish Studies with concentrations in Bible, Jewish History, Jewish Philosophy, and Talmudic Studies
* joint B.A./M.A. program for Yeshiva University undergraduates

The Harry Fischel School for Higher Jewish Studies, established in 1945, offers the Revel program during the summer, with courses taught by distinguished visiting scholars, many from Israeli universities.

== Facilities ==
Classes are held at Yeshiva University’s Wilf Campus in [[New York City]]’s [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] neighborhood. Facilities include the Mendel Gottesman Library, with comprehensive research collections (some 200,000 volumes strong) in Jewish studies. The library is also a member of METRO and the [[New York Area Theological Library Association]].

'''C-value''' is the amount, in [[picogram]]s, of [[DNA]] contained within a [[haploid]] [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] (e.g. a [[gamete]]) or one half the amount in a [[diploid]] [[somatic cell]] of a [[eukaryotic]] organism. In some cases (notably among diploid organisms), the terms C-value and [[genome size]] are used interchangeably; however, in [[Polyploidy|polyploids]] the C-value may represent two or more [[genome]]s contained within the same nucleus. Greilhuber ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Greilhuber2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Greilhuber J, Doležel J, Lysák M, Bennett MD |year=2005 |title=The origin, evolution and proposed stabilization of the terms 'genome size' and 'C-value' to describe nuclear DNA contents |journal=Annals of Botany |volume=95 |doi=10.1093/aob/mci019 |pmid=15596473 |issue=1 |pages=255–60|pmc=4246724 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested some new layers of terminology and associated abbreviations to clarify this issue, but these somewhat complex additions are yet to be used by other authors.

== Origin of the term ==
Many authors have incorrectly assumed that the 'C' in "C-value" refers to "characteristic", "content", or "complement".  Even among authors who have attempted to trace the origin of the term, there had been some confusion because Hewson Swift did not define it explicitly when he coined it in 1950.&lt;ref name="Swift1950"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Swift H |year=1950 |title=The constancy of deoxyribose nucleic acid in plant nuclei |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA |volume=36 |issue=11 |pages=643–654|pmid=14808154 |pmc=1063260 |doi=10.1073/pnas.36.11.643}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his original paper, Swift appeared to use the designation "1C value", "2C value", etc., in reference to "classes" of DNA content (e.g., Gregory 2001,&lt;ref name="Gregory2001"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gregory TR |year=2001 |title=Coincidence, coevolution, or causation? DNA content, cell size, and the C-value enigma |journal=Biological Reviews |volume=76 | doi = 10.1017/S1464793100005595 | pmid=11325054 |issue=1 |pages=65–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2002&lt;ref name="Gregory2002"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gregory TR |year=2002 |title=A bird's-eye view of the C-value enigma: genome size, cell size, and metabolic rate in the class Aves |journal=Evolution |volume=56 |pmid=11913657 |issue=1 |pages=121–30 |doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2002.tb00854.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;); however, Swift explained in personal correspondence to Prof. Michael D. Bennett in 1975 that "I am afraid the letter C stood for nothing more glamorous than 'constant', i.e., the amount of DNA that was characteristic of a particular [[genotype]]" (quoted in Bennett and Leitch 2005&lt;ref name="Bennett2005"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Bennett MD, Leitch IJ |year=2005 |chapter=Genome size evolution in plants |title=[[The Evolution of the Genome]] |editor=T.R. Gregory |pages=89–162 |publisher=Elsevier |location=San Diego}}&lt;/ref&gt;). This is in reference to the report in 1948 by Vendrely and Vendrely of a "remarkable constancy in the nuclear DNA content of all the cells in all the individuals within a given animal species" (translated from the original [[French language|French]]).&lt;ref name="Vendrely1948"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vendrely R, Vendrely C |year=1948 |title=La teneur du noyau cellulaire en acide désoxyribonucléique à travers les organes, les individus et les espèces animales&amp;nbsp;: Techniques et premiers résultats |journal=Experientia |volume=4 |issue=11 |pages=434–436 |language=French|pmid=18098821 |last2=Vendrely |doi=10.1007/bf02144998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swift's study of this topic related specifically to variation (or lack thereof) among [[chromosome]] sets in different cell types within individuals, but his notation evolved into "C-value" in reference to the haploid DNA content of individual species and retains this usage today.

== Variation among species ==

C-values vary enormously among species. In animals they range more than 3,300-fold, and in land plants they differ by a factor of about 1,000.&lt;ref name="Bennett2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gregory2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Gregory TR |year=2005 |chapter=Genome size evolution in animals |title=[[The Evolution of the Genome]] |editor=T.R. Gregory |pages=3–87 |publisher=Elsevier |location=San Diego}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Protist]] genomes have been reported to vary more than 300,000-fold in size, but the high end of this range ([[Amoeba (genus)|''Amoeba'']]) has been called into question.  Variation in C-values bears no relationship to the complexity of the organism or the number of [[genes]] contained in its genome; for example, some single-celled [[protozoa|protists]] have genomes much larger than that of [[humans]]. This observation was deemed counterintuitive before the discovery of [[non-coding DNA]]. It became known as the C-value paradox as a result.  However, although there is no longer any [[paradox]]ical aspect to the discrepancy between C-value and gene number, this term remains in common usage.  For reasons of conceptual clarification, the various puzzles that remain with regard to genome size variation instead have been suggested to more accurately comprise a complex but clearly defined puzzle known as the C-value enigma.  C-values correlate with a range of features at the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] and organism levels, including [[cell size]], [[cell division]] rate, and, depending on the [[taxon]], body size, [[metabolic rate]], developmental rate, [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] complexity, geographical distribution, or [[extinction]] risk (for recent reviews, see Bennett and Leitch 2005;&lt;ref name="Bennett2005"/&gt; Gregory 2005&lt;ref name="Gregory2005"/&gt;).

The '''C-value enigma''' or '''C-value paradox''' is the complex puzzle surrounding the extensive variation in nuclear [[genome size]] among [[eukaryotic]] species. At the center of the C-value enigma is the observation that genome size does not correlate with organismal complexity; for example, some single-celled [[protozoa|protists]] have genomes much larger than that of [[humans]].

Some prefer the term C-value enigma because it explicitly includes all of the questions that will need to be answered if a complete understanding of [[genome size]] [[evolution]] is to be achieved (Gregory 2005). Moreover, the term [[paradox]] implies a lack of understanding of one of the most basic features of eukaryotic genomes: namely that they are composed primarily of [[non-coding DNA]]. Some have claimed that the term paradox also has the unfortunate tendency to lead authors to seek simple one-dimensional solutions to what is, in actuality, a multi-faceted puzzle.&lt;ref name="kew" /&gt; For these reasons, in 2003 the term "C-value enigma" was endorsed in preference to "C-value paradox" at the Second Plant Genome Size Discussion Meeting and Workshop at the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]], [[United Kingdom|UK]],&lt;ref name=kew&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rbgkew.org.uk/cval/pgsm/index.html# |title=Second Plant Genome Size Discussion Meeting and Workshop |access-date=2015-04-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201130244/http://www.rbgkew.org.uk/cval/pgsm/index.html# |archive-date=2008-12-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
and an increasing number of authors have begun adopting this term.

=== C-value paradox ===
In 1948, Roger and Colette Vendrely reported a "remarkable constancy in the nuclear DNA content of all the cells in all the individuals within a given animal species",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vendrely R, Vendrely C|year=1948 |title=La teneur du noyau cellulaire en acide désoxyribonucléique à travers les organes, les individus et les espèces animales: Techniques et premiers résultats |journal=Experientia |volume=4 |pages=434–436 |doi=10.1007/bf02144998 |pmid=18098821 |issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; which they took as evidence that [[DNA]], rather than [[protein]], was the substance of which [[genes]] are composed. The term C-value reflects this observed constancy. However, it was soon found that C-values ([[genome size]]s) vary enormously among species and that this bears no relationship to the ''presumed'' number of genes (''as reflected by'' the [[complexity]] of the [[organism]]). For example, the [[Somatic cells|cells]] of some [[salamanders]] may contain 40 times more DNA than those of humans.&lt;ref name="Gregory, T.R. (2013). Animal Genome Size Database"&gt;{{cite web|title=Animal Genome Size Database|url=http://www.genomesize.com/statistics.php?stats=amphibs|accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that C-values were assumed to be constant because genetic information is encoded by DNA, and yet bore no relationship to presumed gene number, this was understandably considered [[paradox]]ical; the term "C-value paradox" was used to describe this situation by C.A. Thomas, Jr. in 1971.

The discovery of [[non-coding DNA]] in the early 1970s resolved the main question of the C-value paradox: [[genome size]] does not reflect [[gene]] number in [[eukaryotes]] since most of their DNA is non-coding and therefore does not consist of genes. The [[human genome]], for example, comprises less than 2% protein-coding regions, with the remainder being various types of non-coding DNA (especially [[transposable elements]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== C-value enigma ===
The term "C-value enigma" represents an update of the more common but outdated term "C-value paradox" (Thomas 1971), being ultimately derived from the term "C-value" (Swift 1950) in reference to [[haploid]] [[Cell nucleus|nuclear]] [[DNA]] contents. The term was coined by Canadian biologist [[T. Ryan Gregory|Dr. T. Ryan Gregory]] of the [[University of Guelph]] in 2000/2001. In general terms, the C-value enigma relates to the issue of variation in the amount of [[non-coding DNA]] found within the [[genome]]s of different eukaryotes.

The C-value enigma, unlike the older C-value paradox, is explicitly defined as a series of independent but equally important component questions, including:

* What types of non-coding DNA are found in different eukaryotic genomes, and in what proportions?
* From where does this non-coding DNA come, and how is it spread and/or lost from genomes over time?
* What effects, or perhaps even functions, does this non-coding DNA have for [[chromosomes]], [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]], [[Somatic cells|cells]], and [[organisms]]?
* Why do some species exhibit remarkably streamlined chromosomes, while others possess massive amounts of non-coding DNA?

†Source of table: Doležel ''et al.'', 2003&lt;ref name="Dolezel2003"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Doležel J, Bartoš J, Voglmayr H, Greilhuber J |title=Letter to the editor: Nuclear DNA Content and Genome Size of Trout and Human |journal=Cytometry |volume=51A |issue=2 |pages=127–128 |year=2003 |doi=10.1002/cyto.a.10013 |pmid=12541287}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The formulas for converting the number of nucleotide pairs (or base pairs) to picograms of DNA and vice versa are:&lt;ref name="Dolezel2003"/&gt;
 genome size (bp) = (0.978 x 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) x DNA content (pg)
 DNA content (pg) = genome size (bp) / (0.978 x 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;)
 1 pg = 978 Mbp

By using the data in Table 1, relative masses of nucleotide pairs can be calculated as follows: A/T = 615.383 and G/C = 616.3711, bearing in mind that formation of one phosphodiester linkage involves a loss of one H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecule. Further, phosphates of nucleotides in the DNA chain are acidic, so at physiologic pH the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion is dissociated. Provided the ratio of A/T to G/C pairs is 1:1 (the [[GC-content]] is 50%), the mean relative mass of one nucleotide pair is 615.8771.

The relative molecular mass may be converted to an absolute value by multiplying it by the [[atomic mass unit]] (1 u) in picograms. Thus, 615.8771 is multiplied by 1.660539 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; pg. Consequently, the mean mass per nucleotide pair would be 1.023 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; pg, and 1 pg of DNA would represent 0.978 × 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; base pairs (978 Mbp).&lt;ref name="Dolezel2003"/&gt;

No species has a GC-content of exactly 50% (equal amounts of A/T and G/C nucleotide bases) as assumed by Doležel ''et al.''  However, as a G/C pair is only heavier than an A/T pair by about 1/6 of 1%, the effect of variations in GC content is small.  The actual GC content varies between species, between chromosomes, and between [[Isochore (genetics)|isochores]] (sections of a chromosome with like GC content).  Adjusting Doležel's calculation for GC content, the theoretical variation in base pairs per picogram ranges from 977.0317 Mbp/pg for 100% GC content to 978.6005 Mbp/pg for 0% GC content (A/T being lighter, has more Mbp/pg), with a midpoint of 977.8155 Mbp/pg for 50% GC content.

The X gamete and Y gamete both contain 22 autosomes whose combined lengths comprise the majority of the genome in both gametes.  The X gamete contains an [[X chromosome]], while the Y gamete contains a [[Y chromosome]].  The larger size of the X chromosome is responsible for the difference in the size of the two gametes. When the gametes are combined, the XX female zygote has a size of 6,062,084,834 bp while the XY male zygote has a size 5,963,271,354 bp. However, the base pairs of the XX female zygote are distributed among 2 homologous groups of 23 heterologous chromosomes each, while the base pairs of the XY male zygote are distributed among 2 homologous groups of 22 heterologous chromosomes each plus 2 heterologous chromosomes. Although each zygote has 46 chromosomes, 23 chromosomes of the XX female zygote are heterologous while 24 chromosomes of the XY male zygote are heterologous. As a result, the C-value for the XX female zygote is 3.099361 while the C-value for the XY male zygote is 3.157877.

(Chantal Mouffe) data sheet (b. 17 June 1943) }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a Belgian [[political theorist]], currently teaching at [[University of Westminster]].&lt;ref name="Westminster"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.westminster.ac.uk/about-us/our-people/directory/mouffe-chantal |title=Chantal Mouffe |publisher=westminster.ac.uk |accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is best known for her contribution to the development—jointly with [[Ernesto Laclau]], with whom she co-authored ''[[Hegemony and Socialist Strategy]]''—of the so-called [[Essex School of discourse analysis]],&lt;ref&gt;See Jules Townshend, 'Discourse theory and political analysis: a new paradigm from the Essex School?’, ''British Journal of Politics and International Relations'', Vol. 5, No. 1, February 2003, pp. 129–142, and ‘Laclau and Mouffe’s Hegemonic Project: The Story So Far’, ''Political Studies'', 52, 2004, pp. 269-288.&lt;/ref&gt; a type of [[post-Marxist]] political inquiry drawing on [[Gramsci]], post-structuralism and theories of identity, and redefining Leftist politics in terms of radical democracy and [[context free grammar]]s of power relations. Her highest cited publication is ''Hegemony and socialist strategy: Towards a radical democratic politics'' at 15309 times, according to Google Scholar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C44&amp;q=Chantal+Mouffe&amp;btnG= |title=Chantal Mouffe |publisher=scholar.google.com |accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Chantal Mouffe studied at the Universities of [[Université catholique de Louvain|Louvain]], [[University of Paris|Paris]] and [[University of Essex|Essex]] and has worked in many universities throughout the world (in Europe, North America and Latin America). She has also held visiting positions at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Cornell University|Cornell]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]] (Paris). During the 1989–1995 period she served as Programme Director at the [[Collège international de philosophie]] in Paris. She currently holds a professorship at the Department of Politics and International Relations, [[University of Westminster]] in the United Kingdom, where she directs the Centre for the Study of Democracy.&lt;ref name="Westminster"/&gt;

==Work==
A prominent critic of [[deliberative democracy]] (especially in its [[John Rawls|Rawlsian]] and [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermasian]] versions), she is also known for her critical use of the work of [[Carl Schmitt]], mainly the concept of "the political", in proposing a radicalization of modern democracy—what she calls "agonistic pluralism". She has developed an interest in highlighting the radical potential of artistic practices. Mouffe's ''Agonistics: Thinking the World Politically'' (2013) has been criticised by Timothy Laurie for its strong focus on State institutions, noting that Mouffe's "professed enthusiasm for (some) non-Western Islamist movements is solely conditional upon their assumption of State instruments".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title= Review: 'Agonistics: Thinking the World Politically' | first= Timothy | last= Laurie | newspaper= Melbourne Journal of Politics | year= 2013 | url= https://www.academia.edu/5433656}} vol. 36, pp. 76-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''dendrite''' is a branching projection of the [[cytoplasm]] of a [[cell (biology)|cell]]. While the term is most commonly used to refer to the [[dendrite|branching projections]] of [[neuron]]s, it can also be used to refer to features of other types of cells that, while having a similar appearance, are actually quite distinct structures.

Non-neuronal cells that have dendrites:
*[[Dendritic cell]]s, part of the [[mammal]]ian [[immune system]]
*[[Melanocyte]]s, [[pigment]]-producing cells located in the [[human skin|skin]]
*[[Merkel cell]]s, receptor-cells in the skin associated with the [[sense of touch]]

The '''Dynamic Graphics Project''' (commonly referred to as '''dgp''') is an interdisciplinary research laboratory at the [[University of Toronto]] devoted to projects involving [[Computer Graphics]], [[Computer Vision]], and [[Human Computer Interaction]]. The lab began as the computer graphics research group of [[Computer Science]] Professor [https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Mezei Leslie Mezei] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;http://hciweb.cs.toronto.edu/DGPis40/speakers_session5.html&lt;/ref&gt; Mezei invited [[Bill Buxton]], a  pioneer of [[human-computer interaction|human–computer interaction]] to join. In 1972, [[Ronald Baecker]], another [[human-computer interaction|HCI]] pioneer joined dgp, establishing dgp as the first Canadian university group focused on computer graphics and human-computer interaction.&lt;ref&gt;http://graphicsinterface.org/wp-content/uploads/gi2005-frontmatter.pdf Ron Baecker CHCCS 2005 Achievement Award&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, dgp has hosted many well known faculty and students in computer graphics, computer vision and HCI (e.g., [[Alain Fournier]], [[William Reeves (animator)|Bill Reeves]],  [[Jos Stam]], [[Demetri Terzopoulos]], [[Marilyn Tremaine]]). dgp also occasionally hosts [[artist in residence|artists in residence]] (e.g., [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winner [[Chris Landreth]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.utoronto.ca/news/oscar-winning-animator-and-filmmaker-chris-landreth-u-t-computer-science&lt;/ref&gt;). Many past and current researchers at [[Autodesk]] (and before that [[Alias Systems Corporation|Alias Wavefront]]) graduated after working at dgp.&lt;ref&gt;http://hciweb.cs.toronto.edu/DGPis40/alumni.php?page=home&lt;/ref&gt; dgp is located in the St. George Campus of University of Toronto in the [[Bahen Centre for Information Technology]]. dgp researchers regularly publish at [[ACM SIGGRAPH]], [[ACM SIGCHI]] and [[ICCV]].

dgp hosts the Toronto User Experience (TUX) Speaker Series and the Sanders Series Lectures &lt;ref&gt;http://www.tux-hci.org&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5010">'''Eclectic approach''' is a method of [[language education]] that combines various approaches and methodologies to teach language depending on the aims of the lesson and the abilities of the learners.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/article/eclectic-approach https://www.teachingenglish.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; Different teaching methods are borrowed and adapted to suit the requirement of the learners. It breaks the monotony of the class.
In addition, It is a conceptual approach that does not merely include one paradigm or a set of assumptions. Instead, eclecticism adheres to or is constituted from several theories, styles, and ideas in order to gain a thorough insight about the subject, and draws upon different theories in different cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alizadeh|first1=Farideh|last2=Hashim|first2=Mohd Nasir|title=Eclecticism in Drama|date=2016|url=https://www.amazon.com/Eclecticism-Drama-Farideh-Alizadeh/dp/1522899103/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1469894779&amp;sr=1-2}} 10.6084/m9.figshare.3511156 &amp; 10.5281/zenodo.59378.svg&lt;/ref&gt; ‘Eclecticism’ is common in many fields of study such as psychology, martial arts, philosophy,teaching,religion and drama &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alizadeh|first1=Farideh|last2=Hashim|first2=Mohd Nasir|title=Eclecticism In Drama|date=2016|url=https://www.amazon.com/Eclecticism-Drama-Farideh-Alizadeh/dp/1522899103/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1469894779&amp;sr=1-2}} 10.6084/m9.figshare.3511156 &amp; 10.5281/zenodo.59378.svg&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches Methods ==

There are varied approaches and methods used for language teaching. In eclectic approach, the teacher can choose from these different methods and approaches:
* '''[[Grammar-translation method|Grammar-translation Method]]:''' It is a method of teaching languages by which students learn grammatical rules and then apply those rules by translating between the target language and the native language.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/theteachersetofinstruments/methods-and-approaches-in-elt/grammar-translation-method https://theteachersetofinstruments]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Direct method (education)|Direct Method]]:''' In this method the teacher refrains from using the students' native language. The target language is directly used for teaching all the four skills—listening, speaking, reading and writing.
* '''Structural-situational Approach:''' In this approach, the teacher teaches language through a careful selection, gradation and presentation of vocabulary items and structures through situation based activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aslam|first1=Mohammad|title=Teaching of English|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9788175965911|page=61|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Audio-lingual method|Audio-lingual/Audio-visual Method]]:''' In this style of teaching students are taught through a system of reinforcement. Here new words and grammar are directly taught without using the students' native language. However, unlike [[Direct method (education)|direct method]], [[audio-lingual method]] does not focus on vocabulary. Instead, the teacher focuses on grammar through drill and practice.
* '''[[Bilingual method|Bilingual Method]]:''' The word 'bilingual' means the ability to speak two languages fluently. In bilingual method, the teacher teaches the language by giving mother tongue equivalents of the words or sentences. This method was developed by C.J. Dodson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dash|first1=Neena|last2=Dash|first2=M|title=Teaching English As An Additional Language|date=2007|publisher=Atlantic|isbn=9788126907793|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Communicative language teaching |Communicative Language Teaching]]:''' This approach lays emphasis on oral method of teaching. It aims to develop communicative competence in students.
* '''Total-Physical Response:''' It is based on the theory that memory is enhanced through association with physical response.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onestopenglish.com/support/methodology/teaching-approaches/teaching-approaches-total-physical-response/146503.article http://www.onestopenglish.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The Silent Way:''' In this method the teacher uses a combination of silence and gestures to focus students' attention. It was developed by [[Caleb Gattegno]].

==Advantages==
* The teacher has more flexibility.
* No aspect of language skill is ignored.
* There is variety in the classroom.
* Classroom atmosphere is dynamic.
*These types of programs not only negotiate teacher skill-development within an improved recognition of and respect for cross-cultural and multi-linguistic classroom settings, but also encourages student pride in their heritage, language, communication preferences and self-identity &lt;ref&gt;Crandall, J. (2003). They do speak English: World Englishes in the U.S. schools. Eric Clearing House on Languages and Linguistics, 26(3). &lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents may come from a range of faiths including: [[Islam]]; [[Jainism]]; [[Christianity]] ([[Catholicism]], [[Evangelicalism]] and [[Orthodox Christianity]]); [[Judaism]]; [[Buddhism]] and Indigenous traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ritz|first=Janet|title=Thoughts on Eco-Spirituality|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/janet-ritz/thoughts-on-ecospirituali_b_63595.html|accessdate=7 January 2014|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=8 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although many of their practices and beliefs may differ, a central claim is that there is "a spiritual dimension to our present ecological crisis."&lt;ref name=Vaughan2013&gt;{{cite news|last=Vaughan-Lee|first=Llewellyn|title=Eco-spirituality: towards a values-based economic structure|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/eco-spirituality-values-based-economic-structure|accessdate=7 January 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the environmentalist Sister Virginia Jones, "Eco-spirituality is about helping people experience 'the holy' in the natural world and to recognize their relationship as human beings to all creation.&lt;ref name=Bonfiglio /&gt;

Ecospirituality has been influenced by the ideas of [[deep ecology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aburrow|first=Yvonne|title=Eco-spirituality and theology|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/sermonsfromthemound/2013/01/eco-spirituality-and-theology/|work=Sermons from the Mound|publisher=Pantheos|accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eco-spirituality|url=http://www.acton.org/public-policy/environmental-stewardship/eco-spirituality|publisher=Acton Institute|accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is characterized by "recognition of the inherent value of all living beings and the use of this view in shaping environmental policies" &lt;ref&gt;Drengson, Alan. 2012. "Some Thought on the Deep Ecology Movement." Foundation for Deep Ecology. http://www.deepecology.org/deepecology.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly to [[ecopsychology]], it refers to the connections between the science of ecology and the study of psychology.  'Earth-based' spirituality is another term related to ecospirituality; it is associated with pagan religious traditions and the work of prominent ecofeminist, [[Starhawk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blumberg|first=Antonia|title=Celebrate The Winter Solstice With Los Angeles' Own Eco-Pagans|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/11/starhawk-los-angeles-ritual_n_4390396.html|accessdate=7 January 2014|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecospirituality refers to the intertwining of intuition and bodily awareness pertaining to a relational view between human beings and the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journals2.scholarsportal.info/pdf/08980101/v18i0003/227_e.xml|publisher = American Holistic Nurses' Association|last = Lincoln|first = Valerie|page = 227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
Ecospirituality finds its history in the relationship between spirituality and the environment. Some scholars say it "flows from an understanding of cosmology or the story of the origin of the universe."  &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Delaney|first1 = Colleen|title = Ecospirituality: The Experience of Environmental Meditation in Patients With Cardiovascular Disease|journal = Holistic Nursing Practice|volume = 23|issue=6|pages = 362}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are multiple origin stories about how the spiritual relationship with people and the environment began. In [[Indigenous American philosophy|Native America philosophy]], there are many unique stories of how spirituality came to be. A common theme in a number of them is the discussion of a Great Spirit that lives within the universe and the earth represents its presence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Ecospirituality has also sprung from a reaction to the Western world's materialism and consumerism, characterized by ecotheologian [[Thomas Berry]] as a "crisis of cosmology."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Scholars have argued that "the modern perspective is based on science and focused on the human self with everything else being outside, resulting in the demise of the metaphysical world and the disenchantment with the cosmos." &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Therefore, ecospirituality originates as a rebuttal to the emphasis on the material as well as Western separation from the environment, where the environment is regarded as a set of material resources with primarily instrumental value.

== Ecological crisis ==
Ecospirituality became popularized due to a need for a reconceptualization of the human relationship with the environment. Terms such as environmental crisis, ecological crisis, climate change, global warming all refer to an ongoing global issue that needs to be addressed. Generally the ecological crisis is referring to the destruction of the earth’s ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Ecological Crisis|url = http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199680856.001.0001/acref-9780199680856-e-999|doi = 10.1093/acref/9780199680856.001.0001/acref-9780199680856-e-999|last = Mayhew|first = Susan|date = 2015|journal = A Dictionary of Geography|publisher = Oxford Reference}}&lt;/ref&gt; What this encompasses is a highly controversial debate in scientific and political spheres.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is Climate Change?|url = http://www.davidsuzuki.org/issues/climate-change/science/climate-change-basics/climate-change-101-1/|website = David Suzuki Foundation|accessdate = 2015-12-07|date = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Globally we are faced with pollution of our basic needs (air, and water) as well as the depletion of important resources, most notably food resources.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Annette Van Schalkwyk refers to the environmental crisis as “man-made”.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; It is arguably the result of a “mechanistic and capitalistic world view”.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Whether it is man-made, or as some argue, a natural occurrence, humans are not helping. Pollution and depletion of resources play a major role in the ecological crisis.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Bringing religion into the ecological crisis is controversial due to the divide between religion and science. Ecospirituality is prepared to acknowledge science, and work in tandem with religion to frame the environment as a sacred entity in need of protection.

Mary Evelyn Tucker notes the importance of religion and ecology connecting with sustainability. Due to the environmental crisis, perceptions of [[sustainability]] are changing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = World Religions, the Earth Charter, and Sustainability|url = http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/156853508x359930;jsessionid=c0hosllagal8n.x-brill-live-02|journal = Worldviews: Global Religions, Culture, and Ecology|date = 2008-11-01|issn = 1568-5357|pages = 115–128|volume = 12|issue = 2|doi = 10.1163/156853508X359930|first = Mary Evelyn|last = Tucker}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religion and ecology, and the way people experience ecospirituality, could contribute to this changing definition of sustainability.

== Research on ecospirituality ==

Ecospirituality has been studied by academics in order to understand a clearer definition of what individuals label as ecospirituality and the framework in which they create this definition. One study focused on [[Holistic nursing|holistic nurses]], who themselves characterize their profession as having a fundamentally spiritual nature and a sense of the importance of the environment.&lt;ref name="Lincoln, Valerie 2000 p. 227"&gt;Lincoln, Valerie (September 2000).  American Holistic Nurses' Association. p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers performed a phenomenological study where they assessed the nurses' ecospiritual consciousness. For the purpose of their study, they defined ecospiritual consciousness as "accessing a deep awareness of one's ecospiritual relationship."&lt;ref name="Lincoln, Valerie 2000 p. 227"/&gt; They then narrowed down their findings to the five principles of ecospiritual consciousness, which are: tending, dwelling, reverence, connectedness, and sentience.&lt;ref name="Lincoln, Valerie 2000 p. 227"/&gt;
# Tending was defined as "being awake and conscious," with "deep, inner self-reflection."&lt;ref name="Lincoln, Valerie 2000 p. 227"/&gt;
# Dwelling was defined as "a process of being with the seen and the unseen."&lt;ref name="Lincoln, Valerie 2000 p. 227"/&gt;
# Reverence was defined as "rediscovering the mystery present present in all creation and is embodied sense of the sacred," focusing on the earth.&lt;ref name="Lincoln, Valerie 2000 p. 227"/&gt;
# Connectedness was defined as an "organic relationship with the universe." &lt;ref name="Lincoln, Valerie 2000 p. 227"/&gt;
# Sentience was defined as "a sense of knowing."&lt;ref name="Lincoln, Valerie 2000 p. 227"/&gt;
Another study looked at medical effects of ecospirituality by having patients with cardiovascular disease practice "environmental meditation" and log regular journal entries about their experiences.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Delaney, Colleen. "Ecospirituality: The Experience of Environmental Meditation in Patients With Cardiovascular Disease". Holistic Nursing Practice. 23(6): 362.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers started out with the research question of, ''"What is the essence of the experience of ecospirituality meditation in patients with CVD?"'' CVD is an acronym for [[Cardiovascular Disease|cardiovascular disease]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; From analyzing journal entries of participants, researchers abstracted four major themes of ecospirituality meditation: entering a new time zone, environmental reawakening, finding a new rhythm, and the creation of a healing environment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;
# Entering a new time zone was described by researchers as "the expansion of time during meditation."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Delaney, Colleen. "Ecospirituality: The Experience of Environmental Meditation in Patients With Cardiovascular Disease". Holistic Nursing Practice. 23(6): 366.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Environmental Reawakening was described by researchers as "opened participants’ eyes to vistas not previously noticed"&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
# Finding a new rhythm was described by the researchers as "enhanced relationships with their family, friends, coworkers, and even their pets."&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Delaney, Colleen. "Ecospirituality: The Experience of Environmental Meditation in Patients With Cardiovascular Disease". Holistic Nursing Practice. 23(6): 367.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The creation of a healing environment was described by the researchers as "With raised consciousnesses, they became aware of the choices they had regarding what types of intentions and energy that wanted to put out in their environment"&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;
This research was driven by the goal of raising awareness among healthcare professionals about ecospirituality and the medical importance of both self and environmental consciousness. Anecdotal evidence showed a decrease in [[blood pressure]].&lt;ref&gt;Delaney, Colleen. "Ecospirituality: The Experience of Environmental Meditation in Patients With Cardiovascular Disease". Holistic Nursing Practice. 23(6): 368.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the psychological benefits of environmental meditation were the main focus for the researchers.

==Dark Green Religion==

Dark Green Religion is one way in which people, both secular and religious, connect with nature on a spiritual level.  [[Bron Taylor]] defines Dark Green Religion as "religion that considers nature to be sacred, imbued by intrinsic value, and worthy of reverent care" in his book ''Dark Green Religion: Nature Spirituality and the Planetary Future.'' &lt;ref name="Taylor, Bron 2009"&gt;Taylor, Bron. "Dark green religion." Nature Spirituality and the Planetary Future. UC Berkeley (2009). xi.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Nature religion]] is an overarching term of which Dark Green Religion is a part of. A key part of Dark Green Religion is the "depth of its consideration of nature." &lt;ref name="Taylor, Bron 2009"/&gt;
Dark Green Religion differs from Green Religion. Green Religion claims that it is a religious obligation for humans to be environmental stewards, while Dark Green Religion is a movement that simply holds nature as valuable and sacred.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Bron. "Dark green religion." Nature Spirituality and the Planetary Future. UC Berkeley (2009). 10.&lt;/ref&gt;
Spiritual types of Dark Green Religion include [[Spiritual naturalism|Naturalistic]] and [[Supernatural]]istic forms of [[Animism]] and of [[Gaianism]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Taylor, Bron. "Dark green religion." Nature Spirituality and the Planetary Future. UC Berkeley (2009). 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The diverse views within Dark Green Religion are not without the idea that the earth is sacred and worthy of care. The perceptions of Dark Green Religion are global and flexible. Taylor's use of the word 'Dark' gestures toward these negative possibilities. According to Taylor, Dark Green Religion has the possibility to "inspire the emergence of a global, civic, earth religion."&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Bron. "Dark green religion." Nature Spirituality and the Planetary Future. UC Berkeley (2009). x.&lt;/ref&gt; Dark Green, Green and Nature Religions are arguably all a part of ecospirituality. The term ecospirituality is versatile and overarching.

==Ecofeminism and spirituality==
The umbrella term "ecospirituality" covers the feminist theology called [[Ecofeminism]].&lt;ref name="Ecofeminism 2010"&gt;Elizabeth A Johnson on Ecofeminism (Burke Lecture: An Ecological Inquiry – Jesus and the Cosmos) University of California Television, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ecofeminism was first coined by the French writer Françoise D'Eaubonne in her book, ''Le Féminisme ou la Mort'' in order to name the connection between the patriarchal subjugation of women and the destruction of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford, Anne. ''Introducing Feminist Theology''. Marknoll: Orbis Books: 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In it, she argues that women have different ways of seeing and relating to the world than men.&lt;ref name="Annie L. Booth 1999"&gt;Does the Spirit Move You? Environmental Spirituality – Annie L. Booth, Faculty of Natural Resources and Environmental Studies University of Northern British Columbia, Environmental Values Vol. 8, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; These differences can give rise alternative insights on interactions between humans and the natural world when women's perspectives are considered.&lt;ref name="Annie L. Booth 1999"/&gt; The suppression and control of woman and the natural world are connected.&lt;ref name="Annie L. Booth 1999"/&gt; On the ecofeminist view, women are controlled because they are thought to be closer to primitive nature.&lt;ref name="Annie L. Booth 1999"/&gt; By understanding the connection between femininity and nature and by exploring feminine ways of seeing and relating, ecofeminism asserts that humans can realize positive ways of interacting with the natural world and with each other.&lt;ref name="Annie L. Booth 1999"/&gt;

=== Ecofeminism and Christianity on the ecological crisis ===
A significant figure in Christian ecofeminism is [[Rosemary Radford Ruether]]. Ruether argues that feminism and ecology share a common vision, even though they use different languages.&lt;ref name="Ruether, Rosemary Radford 1992"&gt;Ruether, Rosemary Radford. ''Gaia and God: An Ecofeminist Theology of Earth Healing.'' San Francisco: HarperCollins, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; In her work, ''Gaia and God: An Ecofeminist Theology of Earth Healing'' Ruether provides three recommendations on ways to move forward with repairing and "healing" the ecological crisis.&lt;ref name="Ruether, Rosemary Radford 1992"/&gt; The first recommendation is that "the ecological crisis needs to be seen not just as a crisis in the health of nonhuman ecosystems, polluted water, contaminated skies, threatened climate change, deforestation, extinction of species, important as all these realities are. Rather one needs to see the interconnections between the impoverishment of the earth and the impoverishment of human groups, even as others are enriching themselves to excess."&lt;ref name="Ruether, Rosemary Radford 1992"/&gt; The second recommendation is that "a healed ecosystem – humans, animals, land, air, and water together – needs to be understood as requiring a new way of life, not just a few adjustments here and there."&lt;ref name="Ruether, Rosemary Radford 1992"/&gt; The third and final recommendation is that the need for a new vision is necessary: "one needs to nurture the emergence of a new planetary vision and communal ethic that can knit together people across religions and cultures. There is rightly much dismay at the role that religions are playing in right-wing politics and even internecine violence today. But we need also to recognize the emergence of new configurations of inter-religious relations."&lt;ref name="Ruether, Rosemary Radford 1992"/&gt;

===Ecofeminism and Christianity in liberation theology ===
According to [[Ivone Gebara]], in Latin America, particularly in Christian Churches in Brazil, it is difficult to be a feminist, but more difficult to be an ecofeminist.&lt;ref name="Gebara, Ivone 2003"&gt;Gebara, Ivone. “Ecofeminism: A Latin American Perspective.” Crosscurrents, Spring 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Gebara explains ecology as one of the "deepest concerns of feminism and ecology as having a deep resonance or a political and anthropolocial consequence from a feminist perspective."&lt;ref name="Gebara, Ivone 2003"/&gt; Gebara believes that it is the task of different groups of Latin American women to "provide a new order of meaning including marginalized people."&lt;ref name="Gebara, Ivone 2003"/&gt; This task is both challenging and political. Gebara says: "We can choose the life of the planet and the respect of all living beings or we choose to die by our own bad decisions."&lt;ref name="Gebara, Ivone 2003"/&gt;

== World religions and ecospirituality ==

=== Ecospirituality and paganism ===
Paganism is a nature-based religion that exists in a multitude of forms.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Introduction to Pagan Studies|last = Davy|first = Barbara Jane|publisher = |year = 2006|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no official doctrine or sacred text that structures its practice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Due to its lack of structure, many Pagans believe that it should be used as a tool to combat the current ecological crisis because it is flexible and can adapt to the environment's needs.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.thegreenfuse.org/harris/sacredeco.htm|title = Sacred Ecology|date = |accessdate = |website = The Green Fuse|publisher = |last = Collins|first = Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecospirituality advocates contend that an ecology-based religion that focuses on the nurturing and healing of the earth is necessary in modernity.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Sacredness and Sustainability: Searching for a Practical Eco-Spirituality|last = Van Schalkwyk|first = Annalet|date = 2011|journal = Religion and Theology|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As paganism is already based in nature worship, many believe it would be a useful starting point for ecospirituality.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ecopagan.com/|title = A Pagan Community Statement on the Environment|date = |accessdate = |website = Ecopagan|publisher = |last = Halstead|first = John}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, [[Modern Paganism|neopagan]] revivals have seen the emergence of pagan communities that are more earth-focused. They may build their rituals around advocacy for a sustainable lifestyle and emphasize complete interconnectedness with the earth.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Paganism understands divine figures to exist not as transcendent beings, but as immanent beings in the present realm,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; meaning that their divine figures exist within each of us, and within nature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many pagans believe in ''interconnectedness'' among all living beings, which allows them to foster moments of self-reflection before acting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These pagan ideals coincide with ecospirituality because pagans understand the environment to be part of the divine realm and part of their inner self. Therefore, in their view, harming the environment directly affects their wellbeing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://cicministry.org/scholarly/sch012.htm|title = Neo-paganism and Environmental Ethics|date = 1995|accessdate = |website = Critical Issues Commentary Scholarly|publisher = |last = DeWaay|first = Bob}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pagans have already recognized the importance of incorporating environmental ideologies with their own religious beliefs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.religionandnature.com/ern/sample/Harris--Dragon.pdf|title = Dragon Environmental Network|date = 2005|accessdate = |website = Religion and Nature|publisher = London &amp; New York: Continuum|last = Taylor|first = Bron}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dragon Environmental Network is a pagan community based in the UK. They are committed to practicing "eco-magic" with the intention of recognizing the earth as sacred and divine.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Their four goals are as follows:&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
# Increase general awareness of the sacredness of the Earth.
# Encourage pagans to become involved in conservation work.
# Encourage pagans to become involved in environmental campaigns.
# Develop the principles and practice of magical and spiritual action for the environment.  
Paganism combines religion with environmental activism. Pagans organize protests, campaigns, and petitions with the environment in mind while staying true to their religious beliefs.  [[Bron Taylor]], argues that their core Pagan beliefs greatly improves their environmental activism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Additionally, the Pagan community has recently released a statement on the ecological crisis.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It explains that Pagans lead lives that foster “harmony with the rhythms of our great Earth" and that they view the Earth as their equal in stating “we are neither above nor separate from the rest of nature”. It states that we are part of a web of life, and are fully interconnected with the biosphere. This connection to all living beings is seen as spiritual and sacred. And in turn it provides a framework that Pagans can use to combine their religious beliefs with environmental activism. It calls for a return to ancient understandings of the earth by listening to ancient wisdom. It asks Pagans to practice their religion in all aspects of their lives in order to give the Earth room to heal. The statement concludes by stating “building a truly sustainable culture means transforming the systems of domination and exploitation that threaten our future into systems of symbiotic partnership that support our ecosystems”.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Ecospirituality and Christianity ===
Most Christian theology has centered on the doctrine of creation.&lt;ref name="Ecofeminism 2010"/&gt; According to [[Elizabeth Johnson (theologian)|Elizabeth Johnson]], in recent years, this has led to growing ecological awareness among Christians.&lt;ref name="Ecofeminism 2010"/&gt; The logic of this stance is rooted in the theological idea that since God created the world freely, it has an intrinsic value and is worthy of our respect and care.&lt;ref name="Ecofeminism 2010"/&gt; In 1990, [[Pope John Paul II]] wrote a letter on ecological issues.&lt;ref name="Ecofeminism 2010"/&gt; He concluded the letter with a discussion of Christian belief and how it should lead to ethical care of the earth.&lt;ref name="Ecofeminism 2010"/&gt; He ended the letter with the principle "respect for life and the dignity of human person must extend also to the rest of creation."&lt;ref name="Ecofeminism 2010"/&gt;

The doctrines of Christ that Christians follow also have the potential for ecological spirituality for they support interpretations that are consistent with ecospirituality.&lt;ref name="Ecofeminism 2010"/&gt; According to Elizabeth Johnson, Jesus' view of the Kingdom of God included earthly wellbeing.&lt;ref name="Ecofeminism 2010"/&gt;  According to [[Thomas Berry]], Christians recognize a need for an Earth Ethic.&lt;ref name="Berry, Thomas 2009"&gt;Berry, Thomas. ''The Christian Future and the Fate of Earth.'' Orbis Books: New York, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, leader of the Greek Orthodox Church, has organized major religion and science symposia on water issues across Europe, the Amazon River and Greenland.&lt;ref name="Berry, Thomas 2009"/&gt; He has issued statements – including a joint statement with John Paul II in 2002 – calling destruction of the environment "ecological sin."&lt;ref name="Berry, Thomas 2009"/&gt;  Bishop Malone, president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops has said: "The Church stands in need of a new symbolic and affective system through which to proclaim the Gospel to the modern world."&lt;ref name="Thomas Berry 1985, page 26"&gt;Thomas Berry, "Christian Cosmology." ''The Christian Future and the Fate of Earth'', 1985, page 26.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ecotheology of the late [[Thomas Berry]], he argues that Christians often fail to realize that both their social and religious wellbeing depend on the wellbeing of Earth.&lt;ref name="Thomas Berry 1985, page 26"/&gt; Earth provides sustenance for physical, imaginative and emotions, and religious wellbeing.&lt;ref name="Thomas Berry 1985, page 26"/&gt; In Thomas Berry's view, the Christian future will depend on the ability of Christians to assume their responsibility for Earth's fate.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Berry, "The Christian Future and the Fate of Earth," ''The Christian Future and the Fate of Earth'', 1989, page 35.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such responsibility-taking can be seen in the founding of an association called "Sisters of Earth," which is made up of nuns and laywomen.&lt;ref name="Thomas Berry 1994, page 78"&gt;Thomas Berry, "Women Religious: Voices of Earth," ''The Christian Future and the Fate of Earth'', 1994, page 78.&lt;/ref&gt; This network of women from diverse religious communities is significant, both for the movement of general concern for the natural world and for the religious life in Christian contexts.&lt;ref name="Thomas Berry 1994, page 78"/&gt;

=== Ecospirituality and Hinduism  ===

Many teachings in [[Hinduism]] are intertwined with the ethics of ecospirituality in their stress on environmental wellbeing. The Hindu text called the ''[[Taittiriya Upanishad|Taittariya Upanishad]]'' refers to creation as offspring of the Supreme Power, ''[[paramatman]]''. Thus, the environment is related to something that is divine and therefore deserves respect.&lt;ref name="Gottlieb, Roger S. 2006"/&gt; Since the late 1980s when the negative effects of mass industrialization were becoming popularized, India instituted administrative policies to deal with environmental conservation. These policies were rooted in the ways that the Hindu religion is tied to the land.&lt;ref name="Gottlieb, Roger S. 2006"/&gt;

In the Hindu text ''Vajur Veda'' (32.10), God is described as being present in all living things, further reinforcing the need to show respect for creation.&lt;ref name="Gottlieb, Roger S. 2006"/&gt; Passages such as this lead some Hindus to become [[vegetarians|vegetarian]] and to affirm a broader type of ecospiritual connection to the Earth. ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'' 3.8.15. states that, "God, Kesava, is pleased with a person who does not harm or destroy other non-speaking creatures or animals." &lt;ref name="Gottlieb, Roger S. 2006"/&gt; This notion is tied in with the Hindu concept of [[Karma in Hinduism|karma]]. Karma means that the pain caused to other living things will come back to you through the process of [[reincarnation]].&lt;ref name="Gottlieb, Roger S. 2006"/&gt;

Ecospirituality can also be seen in the ''Prithivi Sukta'' which is a "Hymn to Mother Earth."&lt;ref name="Gottlieb, Roger S. 2006"/&gt; In this text, the Earth is humanized into a spiritual being to which humans have familial ties. Through ecospirituality, the notion of praising and viewing the Earth in this way brings about its strong connections to Hinduism.

===Ecospirituality and Jainism===

Contemporary [[Jainism|Jaina faith]] is “inherently ecofriendly.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Key Chapple|first1=Christopher|editor1-last=Gottlieb|editor1-first=Roger S.|title=Jainism and Ecology|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-974762-7|pages=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In terms of the ecological crisis, Jains are “quite self-conscious of the ecological implications of their core teachings.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Key Chapple|first1=Christopher|editor1-last=Gottlieb|editor1-first=Roger S.|title=Jainism and Ecology|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-974762-7|pages=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jain teachings center on five vows that lead to reverse the flow of  or release karma. One of these vows is [[ahimsa]] or non-violence. Ahimsa “is said to contain the key to advancement along the spiritual path (sreni). This requires abstaining from harm to any being that possesses more than one sense”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Key Chapple|first1=Christopher|editor1-last=Gottlieb|editor1-first=Roger S.|title=Jainism and Ecology|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-974762-7|pages=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principles of the Jaina tradition are rooted in environmental practices. The Jaina connection to nature is conducive to ecospirituality.

=== Ecospirituality and Islam ===

Some scholars argue that while looking at the scriptural sources of [[Islam]], you can see it is an ecologically orientated religion.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;[[Richard Foltz]], "Islam." in Roger S. Gottlieb, ed., ''The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Ecology''. Oxford University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Looking at textual sources of Islam, the [[shari'a]] preach a number of environmentally focused guidelines to push environmentalism, in particular, "maintenance of preserves, distribution of water, and the development of virgin lands."&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Much of Muslim environmentalism is a result of the [[Quran|Qur'anic]] stress of stewardship which is explained through the Arabic concept ''[[Caliphate|khilafa]]''.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; A quote translated from the ''[[hadith]]'' states, "verily, this world is sweet and appealing, and Allah placed you as vice-regents thereinl he will see what you do."&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Within the Islamic faith, there is a set importance to following the messages set forth in scripture, therefore the environmentalism spoken through them has led to a spirituality around the environment. This spirituality can also be seen with Qur'anic concept of ''[[tawhid]]'', which translates to unity.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Many Muslim environmentalists see this meaning spiritually as "all-inclusive" when in relation to the Earth.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

A majority of Muslim writers draw attention to the environmental crisis as a direct result of social injustice.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;  Many argue that the problem is not that, "humans as a species are destroying the balance of nation, but rather that ''some'' humans are taking more than their share."&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Muslim environmentalists such as [[Fazlun Khalid]], [[Yasin Dutton]], Omar Vadillo, and Hashim Dockrat have drawn a correlation between the capitalist nature of the global economy to being un-Islamic and essentiality leading to ecological crisis.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

The issues of environmental degradation are especially important to Muslims as majority of Muslims live in developing countries where they see the effects of the ecological crisis on a daily basis.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; This has led to conferences discussing Islam and the environment to take place in [[Iran]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] as well as the introduction of environmental nongovernmental organizations.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

=== Ecospirituality and Buddhism ===
[[Buddhism]] has been around for hundreds of years, however with the modern knowledge on topics such as [[global warming]], many Buddhist scholars have looked back at how Buddhist teaching would respond to the environmental crisis and created what is called Green Buddhism.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Gottlieb, Roger S., ed. The Oxford handbook of religion and ecology. "The Greening of Buddhism." Stephanie Kaza. Oxford University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the key players in this introduction was [[Gary Snyder]] who brought to light where Buddhist practice and ecological thinking intertwine.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Green Buddhism made waves in the 1980s when they publicly address the ecological crisis to create awareness and in 1989 when the [[Dalai Lama]] won a [[Nobel Peace Prize|Noble Peace Prize]] for the proposed introduction of [[Tibet]] as an ecological reserve.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Buddhism has been open to working with other world religions to combat the environment crisis seen at an international conference for Buddhist-Christian studies that addressed the environment.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Although Green Buddhism has not commented much on technical issues such as air and water pollution, they use their spirituality to focus heavily on "rich resources for immediate application in [[Ethical eating|food ethics]], [[animal rights]], and [[consumerism]]."&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5672">'''Embryonated''', '''unembryonated''' and '''de-embryonated''' are terms generally used in reference to eggs or, in [[botany]], to seeds. The words are often used as professional [[jargon]] rather than as universally applicable terms or concepts. Examples of relevant fields in which the words are useful include [[Reproductive system|reproductive biology]], [[virology]], [[microbiology]], [[parasitology]], [[entomology]], and [[poultry]] [[husbandry]]. Since the words are widely used in the various disciplines, there seems to be little present prospect of replacing them with universal, definitive, and distinct terms.

==Meaning==
The terms ''embryonated'', ''unembryonated'' and ''de-embryonated'' respectively mean "having an [[embryo]]", "not having an embryo", and "having lost an embryo", and they most often refer to eggs. In [[Merriam-Webster]] the earliest known use of the term "embryonated" dates from 1687, while Oxford gives a reference dating from 1669.&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-861271-0"&gt;{{cite book |author=Brown, Lesley |title=The New shorter Oxford English dictionary on historical principles |publisher=Clarendon |location=Oxford [Eng.] |year=1993 |pages= |isbn=0-19-861271-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Embryonate===
The term ''embryonate'' can be used as an [[adjective]] to mean ''embryonated'', or as a [[noun]] to mean ''one containing an embryo'' (e.g. "We selected only the embryonates and discarded the rest").

''Embryonate'' can also be used as an [[intransitive verb]] meaning ''to develop an embryo'' (e.g. "In 2-4 weeks after deposition in soil, they embryonate if the soil conditions are suitable").&lt;ref name="isbn0-12-370519-3"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Gerba, Charles P. |author2=Maier, Raina M. |author3=Pepper, Ian L. |title=Environmental microbiology |publisher=Elsevier Academic Press |location=Amsterdam |year=2009 |pages= |isbn=0-12-370519-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===De-embryonate===
''De-embryonate'' refers to the removal of embryos from seeds or similar reproductive units, typically in physiological studies. As with embrionate, it can either be a verb, noun or adjective. In some contexts the term "embryonectomy" may be used.&lt;ref&gt;Lin, Paul P. C.: Effects of methylglyoxal-bis (guanylhydrazone) and abscisic acid on polyamine metabolism in embryonectomized barley seeds. Pub: Plant Growth Regulation Volume 3, Numbers 3-4, 257-268, {{doi|10.1007/BF00117584}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, loss of the embryo may result from the activity of [[seed predation]] by insects.&lt;ref&gt;M. Al Jabr Ahmed : Effect of Bruchid Beetles (Bruchidius Arabicus Decelle) Infestation on the Germination of Acacia tortilis (Forssk.) Hayne) Seeds : American Journal of Environmental Sciences 4 (4): 285-288, 2008 ISSN 1553-345X&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
There often is confusion in applying the term to various classes of unfertilised eggs and [[trophic egg]]s, depending on the area of expertise.

===Virology===
In virology, eggs of domestic poultry are used for [[Microbiological culture|culturing]] viruses for research purposes. Viruses generally can propagate only in live cells, so only a fertilised egg with a good supply of growing embryonic tissue is useful. Practitioners call such an egg ''embryonated'', as opposed to merely fertilised, because they're referring to an advanced stage of development, not merely after fertilisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Knipe | first = David | title = Fields' Virology | publisher = Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins | location = Philadelphia | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-7817-6060-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Entomology===
In entomology, an egg sometimes is called unembryonated until it contains a visibly segmented embryo. An unembryonated egg might be a trophic egg, probably (but not necessarily) unfertilised or at least infertile. Such an egg will not contain a viable [[zygote]]. Alternatively, "unembryonated" might refer to an egg that is "immature", not yet well into the process of development. These are likely to take a long time to hatch, as opposed to eggs that are laid partly [[Egg incubation|incubate]]d and ready to hatch soon after, or even at the time of [[oviposition]].

"Unembryonated" can also describe an empty shell, such as a [[Head louse#Nits|nit]], the egg of a louse that has already hatched or has died. However, this usage is rarely described. Burgess (1995) states: "We have...come to reserve the term "nit" for the hatched and empty egg shell and refer to the developing embryonated egg as an "egg"".&lt;ref name="Burgess1995"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Burgess IF  | title = Human lice and their management  | journal = Advances in parasitology  | volume = 36  | pages = 271–342  | year = 1995  | pmid = 7484466  | doi = 10.1016/S0065-308X(08)60493-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Helminthology===
In [[helminthology]], the state of development of an egg is often relevant to particular phases of the life cycle; commonly the visible presence of an embryo is an important criterion for egg "maturity". Use of this definition of embryonated is common in certain scientific literature. For example: "...Immature eggs are discharged in the biliary ducts and in the stool. Eggs become embryonated in water".&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Tolan, Jr.; Fascioliasis Due to Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica Infection.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4118">In network security, '''evasion''' is bypassing an information security device in order to deliver an [[Exploit (computer security)|exploit]], [[Attack (computing)|attack]], or other form of [[malware]] to a target network or system, without detection. Evasions are typically used to counter network-based intrusion detection and prevention systems (IPS, IDS) but can also be used to by-pass firewalls and defeat [[malware analysis]]. A further target of evasions can be to crash a network security device, rendering it in-effective to subsequent targeted attacks.

==Description==
Evasions can be particularly nasty because a well-planned and implemented evasion can enable full sessions to be carried forth in packets that evade an IDS. Attacks carried in such sessions will happen right under the nose of the network and service administrators.

The security systems are rendered ineffective against well-designed evasion techniques, in the same way a stealth fighter can attack without detection by radar and other defensive systems.

A good analogy to evasions is a system designed to recognize keywords in speech patterns on a phone system, such as “break into system X”. A simple evasion would be to use a language other than English, but which both parties can still understand, and wishfully a language that as few people as possible can talk.

==Evasion attacks==
Various advanced and targeted evasion attacks have been known since the mid-1990s:

* A seminal text describing the attacks against IDS systems appeared in 1997.&lt;ref name="50ways"&gt;[http://all.net/Analyst/netsec/1997-12.html 50 Ways to Defeat Your Intrusion Detection System]&lt;/ref&gt;
* One of the first comprehensive description of attacks was reported by Ptacek and Newsham in a technical report in 1998.&lt;ref name="ptacek"&gt;Ptacek, Newsham: Insertion, Evasion, and Denial of Service: Eluding Network Intrusion Detection, Technical report, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1998, also an article in the Phrack Magazine describes ways to by-pass network intrusion detection.&lt;ref name="phrack"&gt;[http://www.phrack.com/issues.html?issue=54&amp;id=10 Defeating Sniffers and Intrusion Detection Systems]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reports==
The 1997 article&lt;ref name=50ways/&gt; mostly discusses various shell-scripting and character-based tricks to fool an IDS. The Phrack Magazine article&lt;ref name=phrack/&gt; and the technical report from Ptacek et al.&lt;ref name=ptacek/&gt; discusses TCP/IP protocol exploits, evasions and others. More recent discussions on evasions include the report by Kevin Timm.&lt;ref name="timm"&gt;[http://www.symantec.com/connect/articles/ids-evasion-techniques-and-tactics IDS Evasion Techniques and Tactics]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protecting against evasions==
The challenge in protecting servers from evasions is to model the end-host operation at the network security device, i.e., the device should be able to know how the target host would interpret the traffic, and if it would be harmful, or not. A key solution in protecting against evasions is traffic normalization at the IDS/IPS device.&lt;ref name="handley"&gt;M. Handley, V. Paxson, C. Kreibich, Network intrusion detection: evasion, traffic normalization, and end-to-end protocol semantics, Usenix Security Symposium, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lately there has been discussions on putting more effort on research in evasion techniques. A presentation at [[Hack.lu]] discussed some potentially new evasion techniques and how to apply multiple evasion techniques to by-pass network security devices.&lt;ref name="hacklu"&gt;[http://2009.hack.lu/index.php/Workshops#Advanced_Network_Based_IPS_Evasion_Techniques Advanced Network Based IPS Evasion Techniques]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8114">{{Refimprove|date=September 2014}}
In [[archaeology]] and [[anthropology]], the term '''excarnation''' (also known as '''defleshing''') refers to the practice of removing the flesh and organs of [[cadaver|the dead]] before burial, leaving only the bones.

Excarnation may be precipitated through natural means, involving leaving a body exposed for animals to scavenge, or it may be purposefully undertaken by butchering the corpse by hand.

==Platform burial==
Practices making use of natural processes for excarnation are the [[Tibetan sky burial]], [[Comanche]] platform burials, and traditional [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] funerals (see [[Tower of Silence]]).

Archaeologists believe that in this practice, people typically left the body exposed on a woven litter or altar. When the excarnation was complete, the litter with its remains would be removed from the site. Since [[metatarsals]], finger bones and toe bones are very small, they would easily fall through gaps in the woven structure or roll off the side during this removal. Thus, a site in which only small bones are found is suggestive of ritual excarnation.

Some [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] groups in the southeastern portion of [[North America]] practised deliberate excarnation in [[Protohistory|protohistoric]] times.

There have been numerous solar concentrators installed in Mumbai to incinerate the body as an alternative way to naturally break it down to bare bones in just 3 days. These practices are changing due to a shortage of vultures in India, and has caused the practice to evolve in order to still serve the same purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Markandya|first=Anil|last2=Taylor|first2=Tim|last3=Longo|first3=Alberto|last4=Murty|first4=M.N.|last5=Murty|first5=S.|last6=Dhavala|first6=K.|title=Counting the cost of vulture decline—An appraisal of the human health and other benefits of vultures in India|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S092180090800178X|journal=Ecological Economics|volume=67|issue=2|pages=194–204|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2008.04.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other methods==
From the pattern of marks on some human bones at prehistoric sites, researchers have inferred that members of the community removed the flesh from the bones as part of its burial practices.

Neolithic farmers living in [[Tavoliere delle Puglie|Tavoliere, Italy]] over 7000 years ago practiced ritual defleshing of the dead. Light cut marks on the bones suggest the bones were defleshed up to a year after death. The bones were deposited in Scaloria Cave, and when excavated were mixed with animal bones, broken pottery and stone tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/archaeology/2015/03/stone-age-italians-defleshed-their-dead |title=Stone-age Italians defleshed their dead |last1=Shaw |first1=Garry |last2= |first2= |date=27 March 2015 |website=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]] |access-date=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Middle Ages, excarnation was practised by European cultures as a way to preserve the bones when the deceased was of high status or had died some distance from home. One notable example of a person who underwent excarnation following death was [[Christopher Columbus]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}.  The American Revolutionary War general, [[Anthony Wayne]], also underwent a form of excarnation.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh T. Harrington and Lisa A. Ennis. "Mad" Anthony Wayne: His Body Did Not Rest in Peace. http://www.americanrevolution.org/wayne.html, citing History of Erie County, Pennsylvania, vol. 1. pp. 211–2. Warner, Beers &amp; Co., Chicago. 1884.&lt;/ref&gt; A practice known as mos teutonicus, or active excarnation, was a German custom. The bodies were broken down differently than solely defleshing, they were cut up and subsequently boiled in either wine, water, or vinegar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/60742129|title=Interacting with the dead : perspectives on mortuary archaeology for the new millennium|date=2005|publisher=University Press of Florida|others=Rakita, Gordon F. M., 1971-|isbn=0813028566|location=Gainesville|oclc=60742129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern [[Japan]], where [[cremation]] is predominant, it is common for close relatives of the deceased to transfer, using special chopsticks, the remaining bones from the ashes to a special jar in which they will be interred. However, in ancient Japanese society, prior to the introduction of [[Buddhism]] and the funerary practice of cremation, the corpse was exposed in a manner very similar to the [[Tibetan sky burial]]. See ''[[Japanese funeral]].''

Pre-contact Hawaiians ritually defleshed the bones of high-ranking nobles (ali'i) so that they could be interred in reliquaries for later veneration. The remains of [[James Cook|Captain Cook]], who the Hawaiians had believed to be the god [[Lono]], were treated this way after his death. The [[Moriori people|Moriori]] of the [[Chatham Islands]] (now part of New Zealand) placed their dead in a sitting position in the sand dunes looking out to sea; others were strapped to young trees in the forest. In time, the tree grew into and through the bones, making them one.

Following the excarnation process, many societies retrieved the bones for burial.

==Defleshing during the Middle Ages==
During the Middle Ages in Europe, defleshing was a mortuary procedure used mainly to prepare human remains for transport over long distances. The practice was used only for nobility. It involved removing skin, muscles, and organs from a body, leaving only the bones.
In this procedure, the head, arms, and legs were detached from the body. The process left telltale cuts on the bones.

King Saint [[Louis IX of France]] is said to have been defleshed by boiling his corpse until the flesh separated from the bones. This was intended to preserve his bones, to avoid decaying of the remains during their return to France from the [[Eighth Crusade]], and to provide relics. The process is known as [[mos Teutonicus]].&lt;ref name=Westerhof&gt;{{cite book |last=Westerhof |first=Danielle |editor-first=|editor-last=|title=Death and the Noble Body in Medieval England |publisher= Boydell Press |date=October 16, 2008 |pages= |chapter= |isbn= 1843834162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinguishing excarnation from cannibalism==
Archaeologists seeking to study the practice of ritual excarnation in the archeological record must differentiate between the removal of flesh as a burial practice, and as a precursor to [[cannibalism]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7wnjBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22An+Archaeology+of+Desperation&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjI2Pagur_bAhVB0YMKHWrOARIQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22An%20Archaeology%20of%20Desperation&amp;f=false|title=An Archaeology of Desperation: Exploring the Donner Party's Alder Creek Camp|last=Scott|first=G.

One common approach is to compare the tool marks and other cuts on the bones with butchered animal bones from the same site, with the assumption that cannibalized humans would have been prepared like any other meat, whereas excarnated bodies would be prepared differently. Cannibalized bones, in contrast to excarnated bones, may also exhibit telltale signs such as human tooth marks, broken long bones (to facilitate marrow extraction), and signs of cooking, such as "pot polishing".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.archaeology.org/blog/criteria-for-cannibalism/|title=Beyond Stone and Bone    » Criteria for Cannibalism - Archaeology Magazine Archive|website=archive.archaeology.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12407">'''Experimental physics''' is the category of disciplines and sub-disciplines in the field of [[physics]] that are concerned with the [[observation]] of physical [[Phenomenon|phenomena]] and [[experiment]]s. Methods vary from discipline to discipline, from simple experiments and observations, such as the [[Cavendish experiment]], to more complicated ones, such as the [[Large Hadron Collider]].

==Overview==

Experimental physics regroups all the disciplines of physics that are concerned with data acquisition, data–acquisition methods, and the detailed conceptualization (beyond simple [[thought experiment]]s) and realization of laboratory experiments. It is often put in contrast with [[theoretical physics]], which is more concerned with predicting and explaining the physical behaviour of nature than the acquisition of knowledge about it.

Although experimental and theoretical physics are concerned with different aspects of nature, they both share the same goal of understanding it and have a symbiotic relation. The former provides data about the universe, which can then be analyzed in order to be understood, while the latter provides explanations for the data and thus offers insight on how to better acquire data and on how to set up experiments. Theoretical physics can also offer insight on what data is needed in order to gain a better understanding of the universe, and on what experiments to devise in order to obtain it.

==History==
As a distinct field, experimental physics was established in [[early modern Europe]], during what is known as the [[Scientific Revolution]], by physicists such as [[Galileo Galilei]], [[Christiaan Huygens]], [[Johannes Kepler]], [[Blaise Pascal]] and Sir [[Isaac Newton]]. In the early 17th century, Galileo made extensive use of experimentation to validate physical theories, which is the key idea in the modern scientific method. Galileo formulated and successfully tested several results in dynamics, in particular the law of [[inertia]], which later became the first law in [[Newton's laws of motion]]. In Galileo's ''[[Two New Sciences]]'', a dialogue between the characters Simplicio and Salviati discuss the motion of a ship (as a moving frame) and how that ship's cargo is indifferent to its motion. Huygens used the motion of a boat along a Dutch canal to illustrate an early form of the conservation of [[momentum]].

Experimental physics is considered to have reached a high point with the publication of the ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' in 1687 by Sir Isaac Newton (1643–1727). In 1687, Newton published the ''Principia'', detailing two comprehensive and successful physical theories: [[Newton's laws of motion]], from which arise [[classical mechanics]]; and [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], which describes the [[fundamental force]] of [[gravity]]. Both theories agreed well with experiment. The ''Principia'' also included several theories in [[fluid dynamics]].

From the late 17th century onward, [[thermodynamics]] was developed by physicist and chemist [[Robert Boyle|Boyle]], [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Young]], and many others. In 1733, [[Daniel Bernoulli|Bernoulli]] used statistical arguments with classical mechanics to derive thermodynamic results, initiating the field of [[statistical mechanics]]. In 1798, [[Benjamin Thompson|Thompson]] demonstrated the conversion of mechanical work into heat, and in 1847 [[James Joule|Joule]] stated the law of conservation of [[energy]], in the form of heat as well as mechanical energy. [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], in the nineteenth century, is responsible for the modern form of [[statistical mechanics]].

Besides classical mechanics and thermodynamics, another great field of experimental inquiry within physics was the nature of [[electricity]]. Observations in the 17th and eighteenth century by scientists such as [[Robert Boyle]], [[Stephen Gray (scientist)|Stephen Gray]], and [[Benjamin Franklin]] created a foundation for later work. These observations also established our basic understanding of electrical charge and [[electric current|current]]. By 1808 [[John Dalton]] had discovered that atoms of different elements have different weights and proposed the modern [[Atomic theory|theory of the atom]].

It was [[Hans Christian Ørsted]] who first proposed the connection between electricity and magnetism after observing the deflection of a compass needle by a nearby electric current. By the early 1830s [[Michael Faraday]] had demonstrated that magnetic fields and electricity could generate each other. In 1864 [[James Clerk Maxwell]] presented to the [[Royal Society]] a set of equations that described this relationship between electricity and magnetism. [[Maxwell's equations]] also predicted correctly that [[light]] is an [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic wave]]. Starting with astronomy, the principles of [[natural philosophy]] crystallized into fundamental [[law of physics|laws of physics]] which were enunciated and improved in the succeeding centuries. By the 19th century, the sciences had segmented into multiple fields with specialized researchers and the field of physics, although logically pre-eminent, no longer could claim sole ownership of the entire field of scientific research.

==Current experiments==

[[File:Construction of LHC at CERN.jpg|right|thumb|A view of the [[Compact Muon Solenoid|CMS]] detector, an experimental endeavour of the [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]] at [[CERN]].]]

Some examples of prominent experimental physics projects are:

* [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider]] which collides heavy ions such as [[gold]] ions (it is the first heavy ion collider) and [[proton]]s, it is located at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]], on Long Island, USA.
* [[Hadron Elektron Ring Anlage|HERA]], which collides [[electron]]s or [[positron]]s and protons, and is part of [[DESY]], located in [[Hamburg]], Germany.
* [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]], or the Large [[Hadron]] [[Collider]], which completed construction in 2008 but suffered a series of setbacks. The LHC began operations in 2008, but was shut down for maintenance until the summer of 2009. It is the world's most energetic collider upon completion, it is located at [[CERN]], on the French-Swiss border near [[Geneva]]. The collider became fully operational March 29, 2010 a year and a half later than originally planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|date=2010-03-29|title=Yes, we did it!|url=http://cdsweb.cern.ch/journal/CERNBulletin/2010/14/News%20Articles/1246424?ln=en|publisher=[[CERN]]|accessdate=2010-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[LIGO]], the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, is a large-scale physics experiment and observatory to detect cosmic gravitational waves and to develop gravitational-wave observations as an astronomical tool. Currently two LIGO observatories exist: LIGO Livingston Observatory in [[Livingston, Louisiana]], and LIGO Hanford Observatory near [[Richland, Washington|Richland]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]].
* [[James Webb Space Telescope|JWST]], or the [[James E. Webb|James Webb]] Space Telescope, is planned for launch in 2021. It will be the successor to the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]. It will survey the sky in the infrared region. The main goals of the JWST will be in order to understand the initial stages of the universe, galaxy formation as well as the formations of stars and planets, and the origins of life.

==Method==
{{main|Experiment}}
Experimental physics uses two main methods of experimental research, [[Scientific control|controlled experiments]], and [[natural experiment]]s. Controlled experiments are often used in [[laboratories]] as laboratories can offer a controlled environment. Natural experiments are used, for example, in [[astrophysics]] when observing [[celestial objects]] where control of the variables in effect is impossible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5249">In [[music]], '''flat''' or '''bemolle''' (Italian: "soft B") means "lower in [[pitch (music)|pitch]]". More specifically, in [[musical notation]], flat means "lower in [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] by one [[semitone]] (half step)". Flat is the opposite of [[Sharp (music)|sharp]], which is a raising of pitch.

In [[music notation]], the flat symbol, {{Music|b}}, derived from a stylised lowercase "''b''", lowers a [[Musical note|note]] by a [[semitone|half step]] (semitone).&lt;ref&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2003). ''Music in Theory and Practice, Vol. 1'', p. 6. McGraw-Hill, Seventh edition. "''Flat'' ({{music|b}})—lowers the pitch a half step."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/NewDesign/fglossary.files/bglossary.files/Flat.htm Flat], [http://www.naxos.com/education/glossary.asp Glossary], [[Naxos Records]]&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the music below has a key signature with three flats (indicating either [[E-flat major|E{{Music|b}} major]] or [[C minor]]) and the note, [[D♭ (musical note)|D{{Music|b}}]], has a flat [[Accidental (music)|accidental]].

: &lt;score lang="lilypond"&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f
\relative c'' { 

  \clef treble \key es \major \time 4/4 des1
} }

&lt;/score&gt;
The [[Unicode]] character ♭ (U+266D) can be found in the [[Plane (Unicode)|block]] [[Miscellaneous Symbols]]; its [[HTML entity]] is &lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;#9837;&lt;/tt&gt;.

Under [[twelve-tone equal temperament]], [[C-flat (musical note)|C{{music|b}}]] for instance is the same as (or [[enharmonically equivalent]] to) [[B (musical note)|B{{music|natural}}]], and [[G-flat (musical note)|G{{music|b}}]] is equivalent to [[F♯ (musical note)|F{{Music|#}}]]. In any other [[Musical tuning#Tuning systems|tuning system]], such enharmonic equivalences in general do not exist. To allow extended [[just intonation]], composer [[Ben Johnston (composer)|Ben Johnston]] uses a sharp as an accidental to indicate a note is raised 70.6 [[cent (music)|cents]] (ratio 25:24), and a flat to indicate a note is lowered 70.6 cents.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Fonville]]. "Ben Johnston's Extended Just Intonation- A Guide for Interpreters", p. 109, ''Perspectives of New Music'', Vol. 29, No. 2 (Summer, 1991), pp. 106–137. "...the [[Just chromatic semitone|25/24 ratio]] is the sharp ({{music|#}}) ratio...this raises a note approximately 70.6 cents."&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Intonation (music)|intonation]], flat can also mean "slightly lower in pitch" (by some unspecified amount). If two simultaneous notes are slightly out-of-tune, the lower-pitched one (assuming the higher one is properly pitched) is "flat" with respect to the other. Furthermore, the verb ''flatten'' means to lower the pitch of a note, typically by a [[Comma (music)|small musical interval]].

== Key signatures ==
Flats are used in the [[key signature]]s of
* [[F major]] / [[D minor]]
* [[B-flat major|B{{music|b}} major]] / [[G minor]]
* [[E-flat major|E{{music|b}} major]] / [[C minor]]
* [[A-flat major|A{{music|b}} major]] / [[F minor]]
* [[D-flat major|D{{music|b}} major]] / [[B-flat minor|B{{music|b}} minor]]
* [[G-flat major|G{{music|b}} major]] / [[E-flat minor|E{{music|b}} minor]]
* [[C-flat major|C{{music|b}} major]] / [[A-flat minor|A{{music|b}} minor]]
The order of flats in the key signatures of music notation, following the [[circle of fifths]], is B{{music|b}}, E{{music|b}}, A{{music|b}}, D{{music|b}}, G{{music|b}}, C{{music|b}} and F{{music|b}} ([[mnemonic|mnemonics]] for which include '''B'''attle '''E'''nds '''A'''nd '''D'''own '''G'''oes '''C'''harles' '''F'''ather ''and'' '''B'''efore '''E'''ating '''A''' '''D'''oughnut '''G'''et '''C'''offee '''F'''irst).

== Related symbols ==
'''Double flats''' also exist, which look like {{music|bb}} (similar to two flats, {{music|b}}{{music|b}}) and lower a note by two semitones, or a whole step. The Unicode character 𝄫 (U+1D12B) in the [[Musical Symbols (Unicode block)|Musical Symbols]] block represents the double-flat sign.

: &lt;score vorbis="1"&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f
\relative c'' { 

  \clef treble \key c \major \time 4/4 beses1
} }

&lt;/score&gt;
A '''quarter-tone flat''' or '''half flat''', indicating the use of [[quarter tone]]s, may be marked with various symbols including a flat with a slash ({{music|flatstroke}}) or a reversed flat sign ({{music|d}}). A '''three-quarter-tone flat''', '''flat and a half''' or '''sesquiflat''', is represented by a half flat and a regular flat ({{music|db}}).

: &lt;score vorbis="1"&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f
\relative c'' { 

  \clef treble \key c \major \time 4/4 ceh1 deseh
} }&lt;/score&gt;
Although very uncommon, a '''triple flat''' ({{music|bbb}}) can sometimes be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informatics.indiana.edu/donbyrd/CMNExtremes.htm|title=Extremes of Conventional Music Notation|last=Byrd|first=Donald|date=September 2016|publisher=[[Indiana University Bloomington]]|access-date=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lowers a note three [[semitone]]s.

'''Gilbert Ryle''' (19 August 1900 – 6 October 1976) was a British philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gilbert-Ryle|title=Gilbert Ryle {{!}} British philosopher|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-09-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a representative of the generation of British [[ordinary language philosophy|ordinary language philosopher]]s who shared [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]]'s approach to philosophical problems,&lt;ref&gt;[[A. C. Grayling]] (''Wittgenstein,'' Oxford University Press, (Oxford), 1988, p.114) is certain that, despite the fact that Wittgenstein's work ''might'' have possibly played some "''second or third-hand [part in the promotion of] the philosophical concern for language which was dominant in the mid-century''", ''neither'' Gilbert Ryle ''nor'' any of those in the so-called "[[Ordinary language philosophy]]" school that is chiefly associated with [[J. L. Austin]] (and, according to Grayling, [[G. E. Moore]], [[C. D. Broad]], [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[A. J. Ayer]]) were Wittgensteinians. Grayling asserts that "''most of them were largely unaffected by Wittgenstein's later ideas, and some were actively hostile to them''"&lt;/ref&gt; and is principally known for his critique of [[Cartesian dualism]], for which he coined the phrase "the [[ghost in the machine]]." Some of his ideas in the philosophy of mind have been referred to as "behaviourist." Ryle's best known book is ''[[The Concept of Mind]]'' (1949), in which he writes that the "general trend of this book will undoubtedly, and harmlessly, be stigmatised as 'behaviourist'."&lt;ref&gt;Ryle, Gilbert.''The Concept of Mind''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2002. Pp. 327.&lt;/ref&gt; Ryle, having engaged in detailed study of the key works of [[Bernard Bolzano]], [[Franz Brentano]], [[Alexius Meinong]], [[Edmund Husserl]], and [[Martin Heidegger]], himself suggested instead that the book "could be described as a sustained essay in [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], if you are at home with that label."&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Ryle, "Phenomenology versus ''The Concept of Mind''," in ''Collected Papers'', London: Hutchinson, 1971, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Ryle was born in [[Brighton]], England, in 1900, and grew up in an environment of learning. His father was a Brighton doctor, a generalist who had interests in philosophy and [[astronomy]], and passed on to his children an impressive library. Ryle was educated at [[Brighton College]], and in 1919 he went up to [[The Queen's College, Oxford|The Queen's College]] at [[Oxford University|Oxford]] to study [[Classics]] but was quickly drawn to Philosophy. He graduated with a "triple first": first-class honours in classical honour moderations (1921), ''literae humaniores'' (1923), and politics, philosophy, and economics (1924), and was appointed as lecturer in philosophy at [[Christ Church, Oxford]] in 1925. A year later, he became a Student ([[Fellow]]) and tutor at Christ Church, where he remained until 1940.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| last = Tanney | first = Julia | title = Gilbert Ryle | encyclopedia = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | publisher = The Metaphysics Research Lab | location = Stanford, CA | date = Winter 2003 | url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ryle/ | accessdate = 5 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In World War II he was commissioned in the Welsh Guards. A capable linguist, he was recruited into [[military intelligence|intelligence]] work and by the end of the war had been promoted to the rank of Major. After the war he returned to Oxford and was elected [[Waynflete Professor of Metaphysical Philosophy]] and Fellow of [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]. He published his principal work, ''The Concept of Mind'' in 1949. He was President of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1945 to 1946, and editor of the philosophical journal ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'' from 1947 to 1971. Ryle died on 6 October 1976 at [[Whitby]], North Yorkshire.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encyclopedia" /&gt;

His brothers [[John Alfred Ryle|John Alfred]] (1889–1950) and George Bodley (1902–1978), both educated at [[Brighton College]] as well, also had eminent careers. John became [[Regius Professor of Physic (Cambridge)|Regius Professor of Physic]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] 1935–45 and physician to King George V. George, after serving as Director of Forestry first for Wales and then England, was Deputy-Director of the [[Forestry Commission]] 1963–65 and appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]].

==Work==
===''The Concept of Mind''===
{{Main|The Concept of Mind}}

In ''The Concept of Mind'', Ryle argues that dualism involves [[category mistake]]s and philosophical [[nonsense]]. Category mistakes and nonsense as philosophical topics continued to inform Ryle's work. Students in his 1967-8 Oxford audience would be asked rhetorically what was wrong with saying that there are three things in a field: two cows and a pair of cows. They were also invited to ponder whether the bung-hole of a beer barrel is part of the barrel or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.the-philosophy.com/ryle-concept-mind-summary|title=Ryle: The concept of mind (Summary)|website=www.the-philosophy.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy as cartography===
{{cquote|The philosophical arguments which constitute this book are intended not to increase what we know about minds but to rectify the logical geography of the knowledge we already possess.&lt;ref&gt;Concept of Mind p 1&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Ryle thought it was no longer possible to believe that it was a philosopher's task to study mental as opposed to physical objects. However, in its place, Ryle saw the tendency of philosophers to search for objects whose nature was neither physical nor mental. Ryle believed, instead, that "philosophical problems are problems of a certain sort; they are not problems of an ordinary sort about special entities."&lt;ref name="Stanford Encyclopedia" /&gt;

Ryle offers the analogy of philosophy as being like [[cartography]]. Competent speakers of a language, Ryle believes, are to a philosopher what ordinary villagers are to a mapmaker. The ordinary villager has a competent grasp of his village, and is familiar with its inhabitants and [[geography]]. However, when asked to interpret a map for the same knowledge he has practically, the villager will have difficulty until he is able to translate his practical knowledge into universal cartographal terms. The villager thinks of the village in personal and practical terms, while the mapmaker thinks of the village in neutral, public, cartographical terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

By "mapping" the words and phrases of a particular statement, philosophers are able to generate what Ryle calls "implication threads." In other words, each word or phrase of a statement contributes to the statement in that, if the words or phrases were changed, the statement would have a different implication. The philosopher must show the directions and limits of different implication threads that a "concept contributes to the statements in which it occurs." To show this, he must be "tugging" at neighbouring threads, which, in turn, must also be "tugging." Philosophy, then, searches for the meaning of these implication threads in the statements in which they are used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Knowing-how and knowing-that===
{{main|Descriptive knowledge|Procedural knowledge}}
A distinction deployed in ''The Concept of Mind'', between knowing-how and knowing-that (e.g., knowing how to tie a reef knot and knowing that Queen Victoria died in 1901), has attracted independent interest.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jason Stanley]] and [[Timothy Williamson]], "Knowing How", ''[[Journal of Philosophy]]'', '''98'''(8): 411–444, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction is also the origin of [[Procedural memory|procedural]] (knowing-how) and [[Declarative memory|declarative]] (knowing-that) models of [[Long-term memory|long term memory]].

Ryle took a narrow view of the scope of his field. For him, philosophy did not extend beyond the philosophy of mind, philosophical logic, and the philosophy of language. Ethics, political philosophy, and aesthetics were 'philosophy' only by a strained courtesy and a burdensome historical tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.philosophybasics.com/philosophers_ryle.html|title=Gilbert Ryle &gt; By Individual Philosopher &gt; Philosophy|website=www.philosophybasics.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Concept of Mind]]'' was recognised on its appearance as an important contribution to philosophical psychology, and an important work in the [[ordinary language philosophy]] movement. However, in the 1960s and 1970s the rising influence of the [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivist]] theories of [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Herbert A. Simon]], [[Jerry Fodor]] and others in the neo-Cartesian school became predominant. Chomsky even wrote a book entitled ''[[Cartesian Linguistics]]''. The two major post-War schools in the [[philosophy of mind]], the [[representationalism]] of [[Jerry Fodor]] and the [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]] of [[Wilfrid Sellars]], posited precisely the 'internal' cognitive states that Ryle had argued against. However, as influential modern philosopher and former student [[Daniel Dennett]] has pointed out, recent trends in [[psychology]] such as [[embodied cognition]], [[discursive psychology]], [[situated cognition]] and others in the [[post-cognitivist]] tradition have provoked a renewed interest in Ryle's work. Dennett has provided a sympathetic foreword to the 2000 edition of ''The Concept of Mind''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[Richard Webster (British author)|Richard Webster]] endorsed Ryle's arguments against mentalist philosophies, suggesting that they implied that "theories of human nature which repudiate the evidence of behaviour and refer solely or primarily to invisible mental events will never in themselves be able to unlock the most significant mysteries of human nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Webster, Richard |title=Why Freud Was Wrong: Sin, Science and Psychoanalysis |publisher=The Orwell Press |location=Oxford |year=2005 |pages=vii, 483 |isbn=0951592254 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GEIA is governed by an international steering committee &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geiacenter.org/about/geia-steering-committee GEIA Steering Committee]&lt;/ref&gt; and hosts biennial conferences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geiacenter.org/community/geia-conferences GEIA Conferences and Schools]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goals ==
* Access: Make emissions data and information about emissions more readily available
* Analysis: Improve the scientific basis for emissions information and policy making
* Community: Strengthen the science and policy relationships to enhance access to and analysis of emissions
information

== Partnerships ==
* Emissions of atmospheric Compounds &amp; Compilation of Ancillary Data (ECCAD) provides data access to many emissions inventory datasets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eccad.sedoo.fr ECCAD website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Glycogen is the analogue of [[starch]], a glucose [[polymer]] that functions as energy storage in [[plant]]s. It has a structure similar to [[amylopectin]] (a component of starch), but is more extensively branched and compact than starch. Both are white [[powder (substance)|powders]] in their dry state. Glycogen is found in the form of granules in the [[cytosol]]/cytoplasm in many [[cell (biology)|cell]] types, and plays an important role in the [[glucose cycle]]. Glycogen forms an [[energy]] reserve that can be quickly mobilized to meet a sudden need for glucose, but one that is less compact than the energy reserves of [[triglycerides]] (lipids). As such it is also found as storage reserve in many parasitic protozoa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ryley|first1=JF|title=Studies on the metabolism of the protozoa. 5.

Glycogen is a branched [[biopolymer]] consisting of linear chains of [[glucose]] [[Residue (chemistry)|residues]] with an average chain length of approximately 8–12 glucose units.&lt;ref&gt;Manners, D. J. Carbohydr. Polym. 1991, 16, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Glucose units are linked together linearly by α(1→4) [[glycosidic bond]]s from one glucose to the next. Branches are linked to the chains from which they are branching off by α(1→6) glycosidic bonds between the first glucose of the new branch and a glucose on the stem chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Biochemistry |edition = 7th, International |last = Berg, Tymoczko &amp; Stryer |year = 2012 |publisher = W. H. Freeman |isbn = 1429203145 |page = 338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the way glycogen is synthesised, every glycogen granule has at its core a [[glycogenin]] protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Biochemistry |edition = 7th, International |last = Berg|year = 2012 |publisher = W. H. Freeman |isbn = |page = 650|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glycogen in muscle, liver, and fat cells is stored in a hydrated form, composed of three or four parts of water per part of glycogen associated with 0.45&amp;nbsp;[[Molar concentration#Units|millimoles]] (18&amp;nbsp;mg) of potassium per gram of glycogen.&lt;ref name="pmid1615908"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kreitzman SN, Coxon AY, Szaz KF | title=Glycogen storage: illusions of easy weight loss, excessive weight regain, and distortions in estimates of body composition | journal=[[The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition]] | volume=56 | issue=1 Suppl | year=1992 | pages=292s–93s  | url = http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/56/1/292S.full.pdf | id= | pmid=1615908}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==

===Liver===
As a meal containing [[carbohydrate]]s or protein is eaten and [[digestion|digested]], [[blood glucose]] levels rise, and the [[pancreas]] secretes [[insulin]]. Blood glucose from the [[portal vein]] enters liver cells ([[hepatocyte]]s). Insulin acts on the hepatocytes to stimulate the action of several [[enzyme]]s, including [[glycogen synthase]]. Glucose molecules are added to the chains of glycogen as long as both insulin and glucose remain plentiful. In this [[postprandial]] or "fed" state, the liver takes in more glucose from the blood than it releases.

After a meal has been digested and glucose levels begin to fall, insulin secretion is reduced, and glycogen synthesis stops. When it is needed for [[Food energy|energy]], glycogen is broken down and converted again to glucose. [[Glycogen phosphorylase]] is the primary enzyme of glycogen breakdown. For the next 8–12 hours, glucose derived from liver glycogen is the primary source of blood glucose used by the rest of the body for fuel.

[[Glucagon]], another hormone produced by the pancreas, in many respects serves as a countersignal to insulin. In response to insulin levels being below normal (when blood levels of glucose begin to fall below the normal range), glucagon is secreted in increasing amounts and stimulates both [[glycogenolysis]] (the breakdown of glycogen) and [[gluconeogenesis]] (the production of glucose from other sources).

===Muscle===
[[Skeletal muscle|Muscle cell]] glycogen appears to function as an immediate reserve source of available glucose for muscle cells. Other cells that contain small amounts use it locally, as well. As muscle cells lack [[glucose-6-phosphatase]], which is required to pass glucose into the blood, the glycogen they store is available solely for internal use and is not shared with other cells. This is in contrast to liver cells, which, on demand, readily do break down their stored glycogen into glucose and send it through the blood stream as fuel for other organs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oregonstate.edu/instruct/bb450/summer09/lecture/glycogennotes.html|title=Glycogen Biosynthesis; Glycogen Breakdown|website=oregonstate.edu|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Glycogen was discovered by [[Claude Bernard]]. His experiments showed that the liver contained a substance that could give rise to reducing sugar by the action of a "ferment" in the liver. By 1857, he described the isolation of a substance he called "''la matière glycogène''", or "sugar-forming substance". Soon after the discovery of glycogen in the liver, A. Sanson found that muscular tissue also contains glycogen. The empirical formula for glycogen of ({{chem|C|6|H|10|O|5}})&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; was established by [[August Kekulé|Kekulé]] in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=F. G. Young |title=Claude Bernard and the Discovery of Glycogen|journal=British Medical Journal |volume=1 |issue=5033 (Jun. 22, 1957) |pages=1431–37 |year=1957 |jstor=25382898 |doi=10.1136/bmj.1.5033.1431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metabolism==

===Synthesis===
{{Main|Glycogenesis}}

Glycogen synthesis is, unlike its breakdown, [[endergonic]]—it requires the input of energy. Energy for glycogen synthesis comes from [[uridine triphosphate]] (UTP), which reacts with [[glucose-1-phosphate]], forming [[UDP-glucose]], in a reaction catalysed by [[UTP—glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase]]. Glycogen is synthesized from monomers of [[UDP-glucose]] initially by the protein [[glycogenin]], which has two [[tyrosine]] anchors for the reducing end of glycogen, since glycogenin is a homodimer. After about eight glucose molecules have been added to a tyrosine residue, the enzyme [[glycogen synthase]] progressively lengthens the glycogen chain using UDP-glucose, adding α(1→4)-bonded glucose to the reducing end of the glycogen chain.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, D. (2013) Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry, 6th ed., W.H. Freeman and Company (p. 618)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[glycogen branching enzyme]] catalyzes the transfer of a terminal fragment of six or seven glucose residues from a nonreducing end to the C-6 hydroxyl group of a glucose residue deeper into the interior of the glycogen molecule. The branching enzyme can act upon only a branch having at least 11 residues, and the enzyme may transfer to the same glucose chain or adjacent glucose chains.

===Breakdown===
{{Main|Glycogenolysis}}
Glycogen is cleaved from the nonreducing ends of the chain by the enzyme [[glycogen phosphorylase]] to produce monomers of glucose-1-phosphate:

[[File:Glycogen phosphorylase stereo.png|600px|center|Action of Glycogen Phosphorylase on Glycogen]]

In vivo, phosphorolysis proceeds in the direction of glycogen breakdown because the ratio of phosphate and glucose-1-phosphate is usually greater than 100.&lt;ref&gt;Stryer, L. (1988) Biochemistry, 3rd ed., Freeman (p. 451)&lt;/ref&gt; Glucose-1-phosphate is then converted to [[G6P|glucose 6-phosphate]] (G6P) by [[phosphoglucomutase]]. A special [[glycogen debranching enzyme|debranching enzyme]] is needed to remove the α(1-6) branches in branched glycogen and reshape the chain into a linear polymer. The G6P monomers produced have three possible fates:
* G6P can continue on the [[glycolysis]] pathway and be used as fuel.
* G6P can enter the [[pentose phosphate pathway]] via the enzyme [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase]] to produce NADPH and 5-carbon sugars.
* In the liver and kidney, G6P can be dephosphorylated back to glucose by the enzyme [[glucose 6-phosphatase]]. This is the final step in the [[gluconeogenesis]] pathway.

==Clinical relevance==

===Disorders of glycogen metabolism===
The most common disease in which glycogen [[metabolism]] becomes abnormal is [[diabetes]], in which, because of abnormal amounts of insulin, liver glycogen can be abnormally accumulated or depleted. Restoration of normal glucose metabolism usually normalizes glycogen metabolism, as well.

In [[hypoglycemia]] caused by excessive insulin, liver glycogen levels are high, but the high insulin levels prevent the [[glycogenolysis]] necessary to maintain normal blood sugar levels. [[Glucagon]] is a common treatment for this type of hypoglycemia.

Various [[inborn error of metabolism|inborn errors of metabolism]] are caused by deficiencies of enzymes necessary for glycogen synthesis or breakdown. These are collectively referred to as [[glycogen storage disease]]s.

===Glycogen depletion and endurance exercise===
{{See also|Central nervous system fatigue}}
Long-distance athletes, such as [[Marathon (sport)|marathon]] runners, [[Cross-country skiing|cross-country skiers]], and [[cyclist]]s, often experience glycogen depletion, where almost all of the athlete's glycogen stores are depleted after long periods of exertion without sufficient carbohydrate consumption. This phenomenon is referred to as "[[hitting the wall]]".

Glycogen depletion can be forestalled in three possible ways. First, during exercise, carbohydrates with the highest possible rate of conversion to blood glucose (high [[glycemic index]]) are ingested continuously. The best possible outcome of this strategy replaces about 35% of glucose consumed at heart rates above about 80% of maximum. Second, through endurance training adaptations and specialized regimens (e.g. fasting low-intensity endurance training), the body can condition type I muscle fibers to improve both fuel use efficiency and workload capacity to increase the percentage of fatty acids used as fuel,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/training/methods-of-endurance-training-part-1.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/fat-loss/qa-steady-state-vs-tempo-training-and-fat-loss.html&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|reason = http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/training/methods-of-endurance-training-part-1.html
References fuel utilization at lower intensity levels of endurance training|date = August 2013}} sparing carbohydrate use from all sources. Third, by consuming large quantities of carbohydrates after depleting glycogen stores as a result of exercise or diet, the body can increase storage capacity of intramuscular glycogen stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.directlyfitness.com/store/carbing-cyclical-ketogenic-diet/ |last=McDonald |first=Lyle |title=Research Review: An In-Depth Look Into Carbing Up On The Cyclical Ketogenic Diet |access-date=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Lyle. ''The Ketogenic Diet: A Complete Guide for the Dieter and the Practitioner. ''Lyle McDonald, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Costill DL et. al. Muscle glycogen utilization during prolonged exercise on successive days. J Appl Physiol (1971) 31: 834–38."&lt;/ref&gt; This process is known as [[carbohydrate loading]]. In general, glycemic index of carbohydrate source does not matter since muscular insulin sensitivity is increased as a result of temporary glycogen depletion.&lt;ref&gt;Glycogen depletion and increased insulin sensitivity and responsiveness in muscle after exerciseAm J Physiol Endocrinol MetabDecember 1, 1986&amp;nbsp;251:(6) E664–69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Lyle. The Ultimate Diet 2.0. Lyle McDonald, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

When experiencing glycogen debt, athletes often experience extreme [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] to the point that it is difficult to move. As a reference, the very best professional cyclists in the world will usually finish a 4- to 5-hr stage race right at the limit of glycogen depletion using the first three strategies.

When athletes ingest both carbohydrate and [[caffeine]] following exhaustive exercise, their glycogen stores tend to be replenished more rapidly;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Pedersen DJ, Lessard SJ, Coffey VG, etal |title=High rates of muscle glycogen resynthesis after exhaustive exercise when carbohydrate is coingested with caffeine |journal=Journal of Applied Physiology |volume=105 |issue=1 |pages=7–13 |date=July 2008 |pmid=18467543 |doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.01121.2007 |type=Original article }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Gaudet | first1=Laura | last2=Jackson | first2=Allen | last3=Streitz | first3=Carmyn | last4=McIntire | first4=Kyle | last5=McDaniel | first5=Larry | title=The Effects Of Caffeine On Athletic Performance | url=http://journals.cluteonline.com/index.php/CTMS/article/view/5518 | publisher=Clute Institute | accessdate=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Recovery nutrition review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Beelen M, Burke LM, Gibala MJ, van Loon L JC | title = Nutritional strategies to promote postexercise recovery | journal = International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism | volume = 20 | issue = 6 | pages = 515–32 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21116024 | doi = 10.1123/ijsnem.20.6.515 | url = http://journals.humankinetics.com/doi/pdf/10.1123/ijsnem.20.6.515}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the minimum dose of caffeine at which there is a [[clinically significant]] effect on glycogen repletion has not been established.&lt;ref name="Recovery nutrition review" /&gt;

Various [[scientist]]s and [[engineer]]s contributed to the development of [[internal combustion engine]]s. In 1791, [[John Barber (engineer)|John Barber]] developed a [[turbine]]. In 1794 Thomas Mead patented a gas engine. Also in 1794 Robert Street patented an internal combustion engine, which was also the first to use the liquid fuel (gasoline), and built an engine around that time. In 1798, [[John Stevens (inventor, born 1749)|John Stevens]] designed the first American internal combustion engine. In 1807, [[France|French]] engineers [[Nicéphore Niépce|Nicéphore]] (who went on to invent [[photography]]) and [[Claude Niépce]] ran  a prototype internal combustion engine, using controlled dust explosions, the [[Pyréolophore]]. This engine powered a boat on the [[Saône]] river, France. The same year,  the  [[Swiss]] engineer [[François Isaac de Rivaz]] built an internal combustion engine ignited by electric spark. In 1823, [[Samuel Brown (engineer)|Samuel Brown]] patented the first internal combustion engine to be applied industrially, one of his engines pumped water on the [[Croydon Canal]] from 1830 to 1836. He also demonstrated a boat using his engine on the Thames in 1827, and an engine driven carriage in 1828.

Father [[Eugenio Barsanti]], an Italian engineer, together with [[Felice Matteucci]] of Florence invented the first real internal combustion engine in 1853. Their patent request was granted in London on June 12, 1854, and published in London's Morning Journal under the title "Specification of Eugene Barsanti and Felix Matteucci, Obtaining Motive Power by the Explosion of Gasses". In 1860, [[Belgian]] [[Etienne Lenoir|Jean Joseph Etienne Lenoir]] produced a gas-fired internal combustion engine. In 1864, [[Nikolaus Otto]] patented the first atmospheric gas engine. In 1872, American [[George Brayton]] invented the first commercial liquid-fueled internal combustion engine. In 1876, [[Nikolaus Otto]], working with [[Gottlieb Daimler]] and [[Wilhelm Maybach]], patented the compressed charge, four-cycle engine. In 1879, [[Karl Benz]] patented a reliable [[two-stroke]] gas engine. In 1892, [[Rudolf Diesel]] developed the first compressed charge, compression ignition engine. In 1926, [[Robert Goddard (scientist)|Robert Goddard]] launched the first liquid-fueled rocket. In 1939, the [[Heinkel He 178]] became the world's first [[jet aircraft]].  In 1954 German engineer [[Felix Wankel]] patented a "pistonless" engine using an eccentric rotary design.

*1864: [[Nikolaus Otto]], patented in England and other countries his first atmospheric gas engine. Otto was the first to build and sell this type of compressionless  engine designed with an indirect-acting free-piston, whose great efficiency won the support of [[Eugen Langen]] and then most of the market, which at that time was mainly for small stationary engines fueled by lighting gas.  [[Eugen Langen]] collaborated with Otto in the design and they began to manufacture it in 1864.&lt;ref&gt;http://services.eng.uts.edu.au/~johnd/ICEngines/HISTORY%20OF%20THE%20OTTO.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Engine starting==
{{Main article|Starter motor}}
Early internal combustion engines were started by hand cranking.  Various types of starter motor were later developed.  These included:

* An auxiliary petrol engine for starting a larger petrol or diesel engine. The [[Hucks starter]] is an example
* Cartridge starters, such as the [[Coffman engine starter]], which used a device like a blank [[shotgun]] cartridge. These were popular for [[aircraft engine]]s
* [[Air start system|Pneumatic starters]]
* Hydraulic starters
* [[Starter (engine)|Electric starters]]

Electric starters are now almost universal for small and medium-sized engines, while pneumatic starters are used for large engines.

==Modern vs. historical piston engines==
The first piston engines did not have compression, but ran on an air-fuel mixture sucked or blown in during the first part of the intake stroke. The most significant distinction between '''modern internal combustion engines''' and the early designs is the use of [[compression (physical)|compression]] of the fuel charge prior to combustion.

The problem of ignition of fuel was handled in early engines with an open flame and a sliding gate.  To obtain a faster engine speed Daimler adopted a Hot Tube ignition which allowed 600&amp;nbsp;rpm immediately in his 1883 horizontal cylinder engine and very soon after over 900&amp;nbsp;rpm.  Most of the engines of that time could not exceed 200&amp;nbsp;rpm due to their ignition and induction systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supercars.net/forum/threads/1883-high-speed-engine-with-hot-tube-ignition.19553/|title=1883: High-speed engine with hot-tube ignition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first practical engine, Lenoir's, ran on illuminating gas (coal gas).  It wasn't until 1883, that Daimler created an engine that ran on liquid petroleum, a fuel called Ligroin which has a chemical makeup of Hexane-N.  The fuel is also known as petroleum naptha.

Otto's first engines were push engines which produced a push through the entire stroke (like a Diesel).  Daimler's engines produced a rapid pulse, more suitable for mobile engine use.

A '''human interface device''' or '''HID''' is a type of [[Peripheral|computer device]] usually used by humans that takes [[Input device|input]] from humans and gives [[Output device|output]] to humans. 

The term "HID" most commonly refers to the [[USB human interface device class|USB-HID]] specification. The term was coined by Mike Van Flandern of [[Microsoft]] when he proposed that the [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] committee create a Human Input Device class working group.{{When|date=February 2011}} The working group was renamed as the Human Interface Device class at the suggestion of Tom Schmidt of [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] because the proposed standard supported bi-directional communication.{{When|date=February 2011}}

== HID standard ==
The HID standard was adopted primarily to enable innovation in [[Personal computer|PC]] [[input device]]s and to simplify the process of installing such devices.  Prior to the introduction of the HID concept, devices usually conformed to strictly defined [[Communications protocol|protocol]]s for [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]], [[keyboard (computing)|keyboard]]s and [[joystick]]s; for example, the standard mouse-protocol at the time supported relative X- and Y-axis data and binary input for up to two buttons, with no legacy support. All hardware innovations necessitated either overloading the use of data in an existing protocol or the creation of custom device drivers and the evangelization of a new protocol to developers. By contrast, all HID-defined devices deliver self-describing packages that may contain any number of data types and formats. A single HID driver on a computer parses data and enables dynamic association of data [[Input/output|I/O]] with application functionality, which has enabled rapid innovation and development, and prolific diversification of new human-interface devices.

A working committee with representatives from several prominent companies developed the HID standard.  The list of participants appears in the "Device Class Definition for Human Interface Devices (HID)"&lt;ref&gt;

document. The concept of a self-describing extensible protocol initially came from Mike Van Flandern and [[Manolito Adan]] while working on a project named "Raptor" at [[Microsoft]], and independently from Steve McGowan, who worked on a device protocol for [[Access Bus]] while at [[Forte Technologies|Forte]].  After comparing notes at a Consumer Game Developer Conference, Steve and Mike agreed to collaborate on a new standard for the emerging [[Universal Serial Bus]] (USB).

The HID protocol has its limitations, but all modern mainstream [[operating system]]s will recognize standard USB HID devices, such as keyboards and mouse, without needing a specialized driver. When installed, a message saying that "A "HID-compliant device" has been recognized" generally appears on screen.  In comparison, this message does not usually appear for devices connected via the [[PS/2 connector|PS/2]] 6-pin [[DIN connector]]s which preceded USB. PS/2 does not typically support [[plug-and-play]], which means that connecting a PS/2 keyboard or mouse with the computer powered on does not always work and may pose a hazard to the computer's motherboard. Likewise, the PS/2 standard does not support the HID protocol.  The [[USB human interface device class]] describes a USB HID.

=== Components of the HID protocol ===
In the HID protocol, there are 2 entities: the "host" and the "device". The device is the entity that directly interacts with a human, such as a keyboard or mouse. The host communicates with the device and receives input data from the device on actions performed by the human. Output data flows from the host to the device and then to the human.  The most common example of a host is a [[Personal computer|PC]] but some [[Mobile phone|cell phones]] and [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]] also can be hosts.

The HID protocol makes implementation of devices very simple. Devices define their data packets and then present a "HID descriptor" to the host. The HID descriptor is a hard coded array of bytes that describes the device's data packets. This includes: how many packets the device supports, the size of the packets, and the purpose of each byte and bit in the packet.  For example, a keyboard with a calculator program button can tell the host that the button's pressed/released state is stored as the 2nd bit in the 6th byte in data packet number 4 (note: these locations are only illustrative and are device-specific). The device typically stores the HID descriptor in ROM and does not need to intrinsically understand or parse the HID descriptor. Some mouse and keyboard hardware in the market today is implemented using only an 8-bit [[Central processing unit|CPU]].

The host is expected to be a more complex entity than the device. The host needs to retrieve the HID descriptor from the device and parse it before it can fully communicate with the device. Parsing the HID descriptor can be complicated.  Multiple operating systems are known to have shipped bugs in the [[device driver]]s responsible for parsing the HID descriptors years after the device drivers were originally released to the public.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} However, this complexity is the reason why rapid innovation with HID devices is possible.

The above mechanism describes what is known as HID "report protocol". Because it was understood that not all hosts would be capable of parsing HID descriptors, HID also defines "boot protocol". In boot protocol, only specific devices are supported with only specific features because fixed data packet formats are used. The HID descriptor is not used in this mode so innovation is limited. However, the benefit is that minimal functionality is still possible on hosts that otherwise would be unable to support HID. The only devices supported in boot protocol are
* Keyboard – Any of the first 256 key codes ("Usages") defined in the HID Usage Tables, Usage Page 7 can be reported by a keyboard using the boot protocol, but most systems only handle a subset of these keys.  Most systems support all 104 keys on the [[IBM PC keyboard|IBM AT-101]] layout, plus the three extra keys designed for [[Windows 95|Microsoft Windows 95]] (the left and right [[Windows key]], and the [[Menu key]]).  Many systems also support additional keys on basic western European 105-, Korean 106-, Brazilian ABNT 107- and Japanese DOS/V 109-key layouts. Buttons, knobs and keys that are not reported on Usage Page 7 are not available.  For example, a particular US keyboard's QWERTY keys will function but the Calculator and Logoff keys will not because they are defined on Usage Page 12 and cannot be reported in boot protocol.
* Mouse – Only the X-axis, Y-axis, and the first 3 buttons will be available.  Any additional features on the mouse will not function.
One common usage of boot mode is during the first moments of a computer's boot up sequence.  Directly configuring a computer's [[BIOS]] is often done using only boot mode.
Sometimes a message will appear informing the user that the device has installed the correct driver and is now usable.

=== HID definition of a device ===
According to the HID specification, a device is described, during the report mode, as a set of controls or group of controls.
Controls are matched by a field containing the data, and another containing a usage tag.
Each usage tag is described in the spec as the constructor suggested use of the data described in the report mode.

== Other protocols using HID ==
Since HID's original definition over USB, HID is now also used in other [[Bus (computing)|computer communication buses]].  This enables HID devices that traditionally were only found on USB to also be used on alternative buses.  This is done since existing support for USB HID devices can typically be adapted much faster than having to invent an entirely new protocol to support mouse, keyboards, and the like.  Known buses that use HID are:
* [[Bluetooth profile#Human Interface Device Profile (HID)|Bluetooth HID]] – Used for mouse and keyboards that are connected via [[Bluetooth]]
* Serial HID – Used in Microsoft's [[Windows Media Center]] PC remote control receivers.
* [[ZigBee]] input device – ZigBee ([[RF4CE]]) supports HID devices through the ZigBee input device profile.
* HID over [[I²C]] – Used for embedded devices in Microsoft Windows 8&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=HID over I2C| url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/jj127208(v=vs.85).aspx| publisher=Microsoft| accessdate=2016-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bluetooth low energy#HID Connectivity|HOGP (HID over GATT)]] – Used for HID devices connected using Bluetooth low energy technology

'''iCivics, inc.''' (formerly Our Courts) is a [[501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit organization]] in the United States that provides [[Educational game|educational online games]] and lesson plans to promote [[civics]] education and encourage students to become active citizens.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; iCivics was founded in 2008 by retired [[Supreme Court of the United States]] Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]]. iCivics’s stated mission is to “ensure every student receives a high-quality civic education, and becomes engaged in – and beyond – the classroom.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

iCivics, inc. is supported by private donations and grants and had annual expenses of $2.2 million in 2015.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Among the top contributors were the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation|Gates Foundation]] and the [[John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation|MacArthur Foundation]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;iCivics, Inc. (2016). ''iCivics Annual Report 2015''.

==History==
Justice O’Connor developed the Our Courts project in partnership with [[Georgetown University Law School]] and [[Arizona State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icivics.org/news/icivics-celebrates-gaming-milestone|title=iCivics Celebrates Gaming Milestone|last=Curley|first=Jeffrey|publisher=iCivics|accessdate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cabengo.com/projects/our-courts/|title=Cabengo  » Our Courts|website=cabengo.com|access-date=2016-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2009, Justice O'Connor went on [[The Daily Show]] with [[Jon Stewart]] to promote Our Courts and civics education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/videos/index.jhtml?videoId=220242&amp;title=sandra-day-o-connor-pt--1|title=Justice O'Connor Interview|last=The Daily Show|publisher=The Daily Show|accessdate=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2009/03/04/justice-oconnor-not-only-smart-and-moderate-but-funny/|title=Justice O'Connor: Not Only Smart and Moderate...But Funny!|last=Jones|first=Ashby|date=4 March 2009|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Our Courts added ''Supreme Decision'' and ''Do I Have A Right?'' to the website in August 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.edweek.org/login.html?source=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2009/08/20/01civics.h29.html&amp;destination=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2009/08/20/01civics.h29.html&amp;levelId=2100|title=Celebrities Lend Weight to Promote Civics Education|date=August 20, 2009 (updated August 25, 2009)|work=[[Education Week]]|publisher=Education Week|author=Zehr, Mary Ann|accessdate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was incorporated as iCivics, inc. in May 2010 as the variety of content and users began to expand more rapidly.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icivics.org/news/introducing-our-new-site|title=Introducing our new site {{!}} iCivics|website=www.icivics.org|access-date=2016-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more comprehensive website was launched, supplementing the gaming modules with classroom lessons on the branches of government.

[[Above the Law (blog)|Above The Law]] sponsored a ''Do I Have A Right?'' challenge in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abovethelaw.com/2010/01/the-atl-do-i-have-a-right-challengecongratulations-from-justice-oconnor/|title=The ATL ‘Do I Have A Right?’ Challenge: Congratulations from Justice O’Connor|last=Lat|first=David|publisher=Above The Law|accessdate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice O'Connor was the keynote speaker at [[Games for Change]] in 2010, and iCivics was featured at the Games for Change conference in New York in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/charles-tsai/al-gore-games-social-good_b_881017.html|title=Al Gore: 'Games Are the New Normal'|last=Tsai|first=Charles|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Washington Post]] Editorial Board highlighted the shortcomings of traditional civics education, and the efforts of iCivics.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/making-history-and-civics-a-priority/2011/06/17/AGb1tYZH_story.html|title=Making History and Civics a Priority|last=Editorial Board|date=17 June 2011|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 the website added seven games and 16 lesson plans, and had over 700,000 unique visitors.&lt;ref&gt;iCivics, Inc. (2012). ''Annual Report 2011''. Retrieved from www.guidestar.org/ViewEdoc.aspx?eDocId=2772999&amp;approved=True&lt;/ref&gt; By 2013 it was the most widely adopted civics curriculum in America.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Currently, the governing board of iCivics includes O’Connor as well as current Justice Sonia Sotomayor and the Honorable Robert Henry, president of Oklahoma City University. The executive director of iCivics is Louise Dubé, previously Managing Director of Digital Learning at [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icivics.org/our-team|title=Our Team {{!}} iCivics|website=www.icivics.org|access-date=2016-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
Justice O’Connor initially envisioned Our Courts as a response to a perceived misunderstanding of the justice system in America.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As keynote speaker at the [[National Council for the Social Studies|NCSS]] annual conference in 2007, she noted “that while two-thirds of Americans know at least two judges on FOX Television’s ‘American Idol’ reality program, less than one in 10 can name the Chief Justice of the United States.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanbar.org/newsletter/publications/law_matters_home/oconnor.html|title=Law Matters Winter 2008 {{!}} Justice O'Connor Addresses NCSS Conference|website=www.americanbar.org|access-date=2016-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; At present, ourcourts.org maintains this mission,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ourcourts.org/our-approach/|title=Our Approach - Our Courts America|website=ourcourts.org|access-date=2016-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; but iCivics has a broader mission incorporating education on the legislative and executive branches of government as well as civics at a local level.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.guidestar.org/profile/38-3796793|title=iCivics - GuideStar Profile|last=|first=|date=|website=www.guidestar.org|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-25|quote=Self-reported}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization focuses on broadly improving civics education but also on closing the civics [[Achievement gap in the United States|education gap]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; O'Connor saw the state of civics education as a result of the failure of traditional education methods, as well as funding cuts and lower graduation requirements imposed by the [[No Child Left Behind Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nea.org/home/38146.htm|title=Courting Kids|access-date=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Our Courts collaborator [[James Paul Gee|James Gee]], a professor of literacy at Arizona State University, convinced her that educational games were the key to civics education, due to their capacity to teach problem solving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/28/technology/sandra-day-oconnor-supreme-court-video-games.html|title=A Supreme Court Pioneer, Now Making Her Mark on Video Games|last=Singer|first=Natasha|date=2016-03-27|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

iCivics games have been evaluated for their educational effectiveness in a handful of research studies. ''Branches of Power'' was shown to be both engaging and educational for a majority of students in a test group.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Carrie, Jason Lancaster, Wilhelmina Savenye, and Nancy Haas. "A Formative Evaluation of the Balance of Power Game and Curriculum." ''The Journal of Applied Instructional Design'' 3, no. 3 (December 2013): 5-16.&lt;/ref&gt; A significant number of students also play the games again at home, greatly increasing absorption of concepts and improving test scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://trevorowens.org/portfolio/owens_Effects%20of%20learning%20from%20a%20civics%20video%20game.doc|title=Effects of learning from a civics video game|last=Owens|first=Trevor|date=December 2010|website=Trevor Owens|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general iCivics curriculum has been shown to be an effective mechanism for education on civics topics as measured by scores on the US citizenship test. It was particularly effective among younger students in grades 4-6 and less effective among high school seniors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=LeCompte|first=Karen|last2=Moore|first2=Brandon|last3=Blevins|first3=Brooke|date=Fall 2011|title=The Impact of iCivics on Students’ Core Civic Knowledge|url=|journal=Research in the Schools|volume=18|issue=2|doi=|pmid=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interactive writing exercise Drafting Board also improved [[persuasive writing]] skills among 8th graders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://civicyouth.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/WP_76_KawashimaGinsberg.pdf|title=Summary of Findings from the Evaluation of iCivics’ Drafting Board Intervention|last=Kawashima-Ginsberg|first=Kei|date=December 2012|website=CIRCLE|publisher=THE CENTER FOR INFORMATION &amp; RESEARCH ON CIVIC LEARNING &amp; ENGAGEMENT|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization is currently working on extending its curriculum to high school and reaching more high school educators. It currently serves one in four high school government and history teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.guidestar.org/profile/38-3796793|title=iCivics - GuideStar Profile|website=www.guidestar.org|access-date=2016-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Immunomics''' is the study of [[immune system]] regulation and response to [[pathogens]] using [[genome]]-wide approaches. With the rise of [[genomic]] and [[proteomic]] technologies, scientists have been able to visualize [[Biological network|biological networks]] and infer interrelationships between genes and/or proteins; recently, these technologies have been used to help better understand how the immune system functions and how it is regulated. Two thirds of the genome is active in one or more immune cell types and less than 1% of genes are uniquely expressed in a given type of cell. Therefore, it is critical that the expression patterns of these immune cell types be deciphered in the context of a network, and not as an individual, so that their roles be correctly characterized and related to one another.&lt;ref name="first"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Heng TS, Painter MW |title=The Immunological Genome Project: networks of gene expression in immune cells |journal=Nat.

Traditionally, scientists studying the immune system have had to search for [[antigens]] on an individual basis and identify the protein sequence of these antigens (“[[epitopes]]”) that would stimulate an immune response. This procedure required that antigens be isolated from whole cells, digested into smaller fragments, and tested against T- and B-cells to observe T- and B- cell responses. These classical approaches could only visualize this system as a static condition and required a large amount of time and labor.

Immunomics has made this approach easier by its ability to look at the immune system as a whole and characterize it as a dynamic model.  It has revealed that some of the immune system’s most distinguishing features are the continuous motility, turnover, and plasticity of its constituent cells. In addition, current genomic technologies, like [[microarrays]], can capture immune system gene expression over time and can trace interactions of microorganisms with cells of the [[innate immune system]]. New, proteomic approaches, including T-cell and B-cells-[[epitope mapping]], can also accelerate the pace at which scientists discover antibody-antigen relationships.

== Definition ==
A host’s immune system responds to pathogen invasion by a set of pathogen-specific responses in which many “players” participate; these include [[antibodies]], [[T-helper cells]], [[cytotoxic T-cells]], and many others. [[Antigen-presenting cells]] (APC) are capable of internalizing pathogens and displaying a fragment of the antigen – the [[epitope]] - with [[major histocompatibility complex]]es (MHCs) on the cell surface. T-cell response is initiated when [[T-cells]] recognize these displayed epitopes. Only specific peptide sequences from some pathogen-specific antigens are needed to stimulate T- and B- cell responses; that is, the whole pathogenic peptide sequence is not necessary to initiate an immune response. The ‘[[immunome]]’ of a pathogen is described by its set of epitopes, and can be defined by comparing genome sequences and applying immunoinformatic tools.&lt;ref&gt;De Groot AS, Martin W (2003). “From immunome to vaccine: epitope mapping and vaccine design tools.” Immunoinformatics: Bioinformatic Strategies for Better Understanding of Immune Function. Wiley, Chichester.

== History ==

Alizadeh et al. were some of the first to recognize the potential of [[cDNA]] [[microarrays]] to define gene expression of immune cells. Their analysis probed gene expression of human B and T [[lymphocytes]] during cellular activation and/or stimulation with [[cytokines]], a type of signaling regulatory molecule. Many of the activated genes in stimulated T lymphocytes were known to be involved in the G0/G1 [[cell cycle]] transition or encoding for [[chemokines]], signaling molecules involved in inflammatory response. This team was also able to visualize temporal patterns of gene expression during T cell [[mitogenesis]]. In the concluding paragraphs of their landmark paper, these scientists state “virtually every corner of immunological research will benefit from cDNA microarray analysis of gene expression,” and, thus, heralded the rise of immunomics.

Limited by available microarrays and a non-complete human genome at this point in time, this same set of researchers were motivated to create a specialized microarray that focused on genes preferentially expressed in a given cell type, or known to be functionally important in a given biological process. As a result, they designed the “Lymphochip” cDNA microarray, which contained 13,000 genes and was enriched for genes of importance to the immune system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Alizadeh A, Eisen M, Botstein D, Brown PO, Staudt LM |title=Probing lymphocyte biology by genomic-scale gene expression analysis |journal=J. Clin. Immunol. |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=373–9 |date=November 1998 |pmid=9857281 |url=http://www.princeton.edu/genomics/botstein/publications/1998_Alizadeh_Probing.pdf |format=PDF|last2=Eisen |last3=Botstein |last4=Brown |last5=Staudt }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iyer et al.’s 1999 article was another to reveal the importance of applying genomic technologies to immunological research. Although not intending to address any aspect of immunity at the start of their experiment, these researchers observed that the expression profiles of [[Serum (blood)|serum]]-stimulated [[fibroblasts]] were far richer than anticipated and suggested an important physiological role for fibroblasts in healing wounds. The serum-induced genes have been associated with processes relevant to wound healing, including genes directly involved in remodeling the clot and extracellular matrix, as well as genes encoding signal proteins for inflammation, the development of new blood vessels, and regrowth of epithelial tissue. Additionally, one of the most significant results of this expression analysis was the discovery of more than 200 previously unknown genes whose expression was temporally regulated during the response of fibroblasts to serum. These results revealed the importance of viewing the immune response as a collaborative physiological program and begged for further study of the immune system as a network, and not just as individual pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Iyer VR, Eisen MB, Ross DT |title=The transcriptional program in the response of human fibroblasts to serum |journal=Science |volume=283 |issue=5398 |pages=83–7 |date=January 1999 |pmid=9872747 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/283/5398/83.full |doi=10.1126/science.283.5398.83|author2=and others |displayauthors=1 |bibcode=1999Sci...283...83I |last3=Ross |last4=Schuler |last5=Moore |last6=Lee |last7=Trent |last8=Staudt |last9=Hudson |last10=Boguski |last11=Lashkari |last12=Shalon |last13=Botstein |last14=Brown }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Moutaftsi et al. demonstrated that epitope-mapping tools could accurately identify the epitopes responsible for 95% of the murine T-cell response to [[vaccinia virus]]. Through their work, these scientists introduced the interdisciplinary realm of informatics and immunology while employing genomic, proteomic, and immunological data. The striking success and ease of this method encouraged researchers both to define the immunome of other pathogens, and to measure the breadth and overlap of pathogen immunomes that give rise to immunity. Additionally, it suggested other applications in which epitope-mapping tools could be used including autoimmunity, transplantation, and [[immunogenicity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Moutaftsi M, Peters B, Pasquetto V, etal |title=A consensus epitope prediction approach identifies the breadth of murine T(CD8+)-cell responses to vaccinia virus |journal=Nat.

== Technologies used ==

=== Immunomic microarrays ===

Several types of microarrays have been created to specifically observe the immune system response and interactions. ''Antibody microarrays'' use antibodies as probes and antigens as targets. They can be used to directly measure the antigen concentrations for which the antibody probes are specific. ''Peptide microarrays'' use antigen peptides as probes and serum antibodies as targets. These can be used for functional immunomic applications to the understanding of autoimmune diseases and allergies, definition of B-cell epitopes, vaccine studies, detection assays, and analysis of antibody specificity.  ''MHC microarrays'' are the most recent development in immunomic arrays and use peptide-MHC complexes and their co-stimulatory molecules as probes and T-cell populations as targets. Bound T-cells are activated and secrete cytokines, which are captured by specific detection antibodies. This microarray can map MHC-restricted T cell epitopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Braga-Neto UM, Marques ET |title=From functional genomics to functional immunomics: new challenges, old problems, big rewards |journal=PLoS Comput. Biol. |volume=2 |issue=7 |pages=e81 |date=July 2006 |pmid=16863395 |pmc=1523295 |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020081 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020081|last2=Marques Jr |bibcode=2006PLSCB...2...81B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lymphochip ====
[[File:Lymphochip.jpg|thumb|The Lymphochip: A specialized cDNA microarray]]

The Lymphochip is a specialized human cDNA microarray enriched for genes related to immune function. 17,853 [[cDNA]] clones were taken from three sources. The first set of clones were selected if identified [[expressed sequence tags]] (ESTs) were unique or enriched specifically in lymphoid cDNA libraries; these represent ~80% of the Lymphochip clones. The second set of clones was identified during first-generation microarray analysis of immune responses. Finally, 3,183 genes that are known or suspected to have roles in immune function, [[oncogenesis]], [[apoptosis]], cell proliferation, or being [[open reading frames]] from pathogenic human viruses were used on the Lymphochip. New genes are frequently being added.

=== T- and- B-cell-epitope mapping tools ===

[[Epitope mapping]] identifies the sites of [[antibodies]] to which their target antigens bind. In the past, scientists would have to isolate antigens, digest them into smaller fragments, and determine which of these fragments stimulated T- and B- cell responses to define an antibody’s epitope. Immunomics harnesses the power of bioinformatics and offers mapping algorithms that accelerate the discovery of epitope sequences. These algorithms are relevant to vaccine design and for characterizing and modifying immune responses in the context of [[autoimmunity]], [[endocrinology]], [[allergy]], transplantation, diagnostics and engineering of therapeutic proteins.

T-cell and B-cell epitope mapping algorithms can computationally predict epitopes based on the genomic sequence of pathogens, without prior knowledge of a protein’s structure or function. A series of steps are used to identify epitopes:
# Comparison between virulent and avirulent organisms identify candidate genes that code for epitopes that solicit T-cell responses by looking for sequences that are unique to virulent strains. Additionally, differential microarray technologies can discover pathogen-specific genes that are upregulated during host-interaction and may be relevant for analysis because they are critical to the function of the pathogen.
# [[Immunoinformatics]] tools predict regions of these candidate genes that interact with T cells by scanning genome-derived protein sequences of a pathogen.
# These predicted peptides are synthesized and used in in vitro screening against T cells. Recognizing a positive immune response can suggest that this peptide contains an epitope that stimulates immune response in the course of natural infection or disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=De Groot AS, Berzofsky JA |title=From genome to vaccine – new immunoinformatics tools for vaccine design |journal=Bioinformatics in Vaccine Design |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=425–8 |year=2004 |doi= 10.1016/j.ymeth.2004.06.004|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1046202304001239|last2=Berzofsky }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tetramer staining by flow cytometry ===

The guiding principle behind [[flow cytometry]]&lt;nowiki&gt; is that cells or subcellular particles are tagged with fluorescent probes are passed through a laser beam and sorted by the strength of fluorescence emitted by cells contained in the droplets. MHC [[tetramer staining]] by flow cytometry identifies and isolates specific T cells based on the binding specificity of their cell surface receptors with fluorescently-tagged MHC-peptide complexes.&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Altman JD, Moss PA, Goulder PJ |title=Phenotypic analysis of antigen-specific T lymphocytes |journal=Science |volume=274 |issue=5284 |pages=94–6 |date=October 1996 |pmid=8810254 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8810254 |doi=10.1126/science.274.5284.94|author2=and others |displayauthors=1 |bibcode=1996Sci...274...94A |last3=Goulder |last4=Barouch |last5=McHeyzer-Williams |last6=Bell |last7=McMichael |last8=Davis }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ELISPOT ===
[[ELISPOT]] is a modified version of the [[ELISA]] immunoassay and is a common method of monitoring immune responses.

== Contributions to understanding the immune system==
Immunomics has made a considerable impact on the understanding of the immune system by uncovering differences in gene expression profiles of cell types, characterizing immune response, illuminating immune cell lineages and relationship, and establishing gene regulatory networks. Whereas the following list of contributions is not complete, it is meant to demonstrate the broad application of immunomic research and powerful consequences on immunology.

=== Immune cell activation and differentiation ===

==== B lymphocyte anergy ====
Microarrays have discovered gene expression patterns that correlate with antigen-induced activation or anergy in B lymphocytes. Lymphocyte anergy pathways involve induction of some, but not all of the signaling pathways used during lymphocyte activation. For example, [[NFAT]] and [[MAPK/ERK kinase]] pathways are expressed in anergic (or “tolerant) cell lines, whereas [[NF-kB]] and [[c-Jun N-terminal kinases]] pathways are not. Of the 300 genes that were altered in expression after antigen-stimulated naïve B cells, only 8 of these genes were regulated in tolerant B cells. Understanding these “tolerance” pathways have important implications for designing immunosuppressive drugs. These gene expression signatures of tolerant B cells could be used during drug screens to probe for compounds that mimic the functional effects of natural tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Healy JI, Goodnow CC |title=Positive versus negative signaling by lymphocyte antigen receptors |journal=Annu. Rev. Immunol. |volume=16 |issue= |pages=645–70 |year=1998 |pmid=9597145 |doi=10.1146/annurev.immunol.16.1.645 |url=http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.immunol.16.1.645?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed|last2=Goodnow }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lymphocyte differentiation ====
Gene expression profiles during human [[lymphocyte]] differentiation has followed mature, naïve B cells from their resting state through [[germinal center]] reactions and into terminal differentiation. These studies have shown that germinal center B cells represent a distinct stage in differentiation because the gene expression profile is different from activated peripheral B cells. Although no in vitro culture system has been able to induce resting peripheral B cells to adopt a full germinal center phenotype, these gene expression profiles can be used to measure the success of in vitro cultures in mimicking the germinal center state as they are being developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Alizadeh A, Eisen M, Davis RE |title=The lymphochip: a specialized cDNA microarray for the genomic-scale analysis of gene expression in normal and malignant lymphocytes |journal=Cold Spring Harb.

==== Lymphoid malignancies ====
About 9 of every 10 human lymphoid cancers derive from B cells. Distinct immunome-wide expression patterns in a large number of [[diffuse large cell lymphoma]] (DLCL)– the most common form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma – have identified at least two different subtypes in what was previously thought to be a single disease. One subset of these DLCLs shows a similar gene expression pattern to that of normal germinal center B cells and implies that the tumor cell originated from a germinal center B cell. Other surveys of B cell malignancies show that follicular lymphomas share expression features with germinal center B cells, whereas chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells resemble resting peripheral blood lymphocytes. Furthermore, heterogeneity in each of these cell lines also suggest that different subtypes exist within each type of lymphoma, just as it has been shown in DLCL. Such knowledge can be used to direct patients to the most appropriate therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Alizadeh AA, Eisen MB, Davis RE |title=Distinct types of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma identified by gene expression profiling |journal=Nature |volume=403 |issue=6769 |pages=503–11 |date=February 2000 |pmid=10676951 |doi=10.1038/35000501 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v403/n6769/full/403503a0.html|author2=and others |displayauthors=1 |bibcode=2000Natur.403..503A |last3=Davis |last4=Ma |last5=Lossos |last6=Rosenwald |last7=Boldrick |last8=Sabet |last9=Tran |last10=Yu |last11=Powell |last12=Yang |last13=Marti |last14=Moore |last15=Hudson |last16=Lu |last17=Lewis |last18=Tibshirani |last19=Sherlock |last20=Chan |last21=Greiner |last22=Weisenburger |last23=Armitage |last24=Warnke |last25=Levy |last26=Wilson |last27=Grever |last28=Byrd |last29=Botstein |last30=Brown }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immune response ===

====Macrophage responses to bacteria====
Microarrays have analyzed global responses of [[macrophages]] to different microorganisms and have confirmed that these responses sustain and control inflammatory processes, and also kill microorganisms. These independent studies have been able to better describe how macrophages mount attacks against different microorganisms.  A “core transcriptional response” was observed to induce 132 genes and repress 59 genes. Induced genes include pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines, and their respective receptors. A “pathogen-specific response” was also observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ricciardi-Castagnoli P, Granucci F |title=Opinion: Interpretation of the complexity of innate immune responses by functional genomics |journal=Nat. Rev. Immunol. |volume=2 |issue=11 |pages=881–9 |date=November 2002 |pmid=12415311 |doi=10.1038/nri936 |url=http://www.nature.com/nri/journal/v2/n11/full/nri936.html|last2=Granucci }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dendritic response to pathogen====
[[Dendritic cells]] (DCs) help macrophages sustain inflammatory processes and participate in the [[innate immune system]] response, but can also prime [[adaptive immunity]]. Gene expression analyses have shown that DCs can “multi-task” by temporally segregating their different functions. Soon after recognizing an infectious agent, immature DCs transition to a state of early activation via a core response characterized by rapid downregulation of genes involved with pathogen recognition and [[phagocytosis]], upregulation of cytokine and chemokine genes to recruit other immune cells to the side of inflammations; and expression of genes that control migratory capacity. Early activated DCs are enabled to migrate from non-lymphoid tissues to lymph nodes, where they can prime T-cell responses. These early DCs responses are related to innate immunity and consist of the “core transcriptional response” of DCs. Pathogen-specific responses have a stronger influence on the DC’s ability to regulate adaptive immunity.

=== Distinguishing immune cell types ===
Comparing distinctions between immune cells’ overall transcriptional program can generate plots that position each cell type to best reflect its expression profile relative to all other cells and can reveal interesting relationships between cell types. For example, the transcriptional profiles from thymic medullary epithelial immune cells mapped closer to lymphocytes than to other epithelia. This can suggest that a functional interaction exists between these two cells type and requires the sharing of particular transcripts and proteins.  When comparing gene expression profiles from cells of the blood system, T-cell and B-cell subsets tightly group with their respective cell types.

By looking at the transcriptional profile of different T-cells, scientists have shown that natural killer T-cells are a close variant of conventional [[CD4+ T cells]], rather than an intermediary cell-type between T cells and [[natural killer cells]]. Additionally, DCs, natural killer cells, and B cells are tightly grouped based on their global expression profiles. It may have been expected that B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes would cluster separately from each other, or that natural killer cells would be more closely related to T cells because they share common precursors, cytolytic activity, and similar activation markers. Therefore, immunomics has established relationship between cell lineages that depart from classical views. Additionally, it may better explain the observed plasticity in lymphoid and myeloid cell differentiation because of the considerable overlap between global expression profiles of these different lineages.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hyatt G, Melamed R, Park R, etal |title=Gene expression microarrays: glimpses of the immunological genome |journal=Nat. Immunol. |volume=7 |issue=7 |pages=686–91 |date=July 2006 |pmid=16785882 |doi=10.1038/ni0706-686 |url=http://www.nature.com/ni/journal/v7/n7/full/ni0706-686.html   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immune cell regulatory networks ===
Networks represent the broadest level of genetic interactions and aim to link all genes and transcripts in the immunological genome. Cellular phenotypes and differentiation states are ultimately established by the activity of these networks of co-regulated genes. One of the most complete networks in immunology has deciphered regulatory connections among normal and transformed human B cells. This analysis suggests a hierarchical network where a small number of highly connected genes (called “hubs”) regulated most interactions. Proto-[[oncogene]] [[MYC]] emerged as a major hub and highly influential regulator for B cells. Notably, MYC was found to directly control [[BYSL]], a highly conserved, but poorly characterized gene, and is the largest hub in the whole B cell network. This suggests that BYSL encodes an important cellular molecule and a critical effecter of MYC function, and motivates additional studies to elucidate its function. Therefore, using gene expression data to create networks can reveal genes highly influential in immune cell differentiation that pre-genomic technologies had not yet identified.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;

== Practical applications ==

=== Vaccine development ===
As quoted by Stefania Bambini and Rino Rappuoli, “New powerful genomics technologies have increased the number of disease that can be addressed by vaccination, and decreased the time for discover research and [[vaccine]] development.” The availability of complete genome sequences of pathogens in combination with high-throughput genomics technologies have helped to accelerate vaccine development. Reverse vaccinology uses genomic sequences of viral, bacterial, or parasitic pathogens to identify genes potentially encoding genes that promote [[pathogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bambini S, Rappuoli R |title=The use of genomics in microbial vaccine development |journal=Drug Discov. Today |volume=14 |issue=5–6 |pages=252–60 |date=March 2009 |pmid=19150507 |doi=10.1016/j.drudis.2008.12.007 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1359-6446(08)00434-0|last2=Rappuoli }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first application of reverse vaccinology identified vaccine candidates against ''[[Neisseria meningitidis]]'' serogroup B. Computational tools identified 600 putative surface-exposed or secreted proteins from the complete genome sequence of a MenB pathogenic strain, on the basis of sequence features. These putative proteins were expressed in E. coli, purified, and used to immunize mice. Tests using mice immune sera estimated the ability of antibodies to protect against these proteins. The proteins able to solicit a robust immune response were checked for sequence conservation across a panel of meningitides strains and allowed for further selection of antigen able to elicit an immune response against most strains in the panel. On the basis of these antigen sequences, scientists have been able to develop a universal “cocktail” vaccine against ''Neisseria meninitidis'' that uses five antigens to promote immunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pizza M, Scarlato V, Masignani V, etal |title=Identification of vaccine candidates against serogroup B meningococcus by whole-genome sequencing |journal=Science |volume=287 |issue=5459 |pages=1816–20 |date=March 2000 |pmid=10710308 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/287/5459/1816.full |doi=10.1126/science.287.5459.1816   |bibcode=  2000Sci...287.1816.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Similar approaches have been used for a variety of other human pathogens, such as ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'', ''[[Chlamydia pneumoniae]]'', ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'', ''[[Porphyromonas gingivalis]]'', ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'', ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'', amongst others. Additionally, studies have started for the development of vaccines against viruses.

=== Disease diagnosis ===
The inventory of receptors and signal transduction pathways that immune cells use to monitor and defend the body gives rise to signature patterns of altered gene expression in peripheral blood cells that reflect the character of the infection or injury. Therefore, recognizing characteristic expression profiles of peripheral blood cells may be a powerful diagnostic tool by recruiting these cells as “spies” to detect occult diseases or agents that cannot be readily cultured from the host.

For example, [[cytomegalovirus]] (CMV) infection of [[fibroblasts]] and HTLV-I infection of T lymphocytes revealed distinct gene expression profiles.  CMV infection provoked a unique interferon response whereas HTLV-1 infection induced NF-kB target genes. A type of white blood cells have also been tested again bacterial exposures and immunome expression varied based on the type of bacterial strain used.

Monitoring the change of peripheral blood gene expression can also help determine the course of infection and help treat patients with a therapy tailored to their disease stage. This approach has already been used against sepsis – a disease that progresses through a predictable line of events.
Changes gene expression signatures may precede clinical exacerbation of symptoms, like in [[multiple sclerosis]], and allow physicians to nip these “flare-ups” in the bud.&lt;ref name="first"/&gt;

== Immunological genome project ==
{{main|Immunological Genome Project}}
The immune system is a network of genetic and signaling pathways connected by a network of interacting cells. The [[Immunological Genome Project]] seeks to generate a complete compendium of protein-coding gene expression for all cell populations in the mouse immune system. It analyzes both steady-state conditions within different cell populations, and in response to genetic and/or environmental perturbations created by natural genetic polymorphism, gene knock-out, gene knock-down by [[RNAi]], or drug treatment. Computational tools to reverse-engineer or predict immune cell regulatory networks use these expression profiles.

By 2008, the ImmGen project involved seven immunology and three computational biology laboratories across the United States and over 200 cell populations involved in the immune system had been identified and described. This consortium has created a data browser to explore the expression patterns of particular genes, networks of co-regulated genes, and genes that can reliably distinguish cell types. Raw data is also accessible from the NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.immgen.org/index_content.html The Immunological Genome Project]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE15907 NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Journal of Biblical Literature''''' ('''''JBL''''') is one of three [[academic journals]] published by the [[Society of Biblical Literature]] (SBL).
First published in 1881, ''JBL'' is the flagship journal of the field. ''JBL'' is published quarterly and includes scholarly articles, critical notes, and book reviews by members of the Society. 
''JBL'' is available on line as well as in print:

''JBL'' has a moving window of Open Access. Aside from the current issue, the past three years of ''JBL'' are freely available to the public in PDF form, after registering on the SBL website. Previous issues, back to 1881, are available in the JSTOR Arts and Sciences III collection."&lt;ref&gt;Carl Kinbar, [http://sblonline.org/Article.aspx?ArticleId=580 'Open Access and the SBL',] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014152635/http://www.sblonline.org/Article.aspx?ArticleId=580 |date=2006-10-14 }} ''[[SBL Forum]]'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The journal was originally published under the title ''Journal of the Society of Biblical Literature and Exegesis''. The current name was adopted with volume 9 (1890).

At the fourth meeting, on 29 December 1881, the SBL council voted to print 500 copies of a journal, including the full text of papers read at the society's annual June meetings.&lt;ref&gt;
''JBL'' '''50''' (1931): xxiv-xlix.&lt;/ref&gt;

''JBL'' was, at first, an annual serial, from 1882 to 1905 (though two serials appeared in each of 1886 and 1887). ''JBL'' became semiannual from 1906 to 1911, and has been quarterly since 1912 (with a hiatus in 1915 and exceptional years with only two serials).&lt;ref name="Scriptures" /&gt;

In 1916, the SBL secretary passed on to the members a communication, from the Third Assistant Postmaster General of the United States, refusing to give the ''JBL'' the second-class rate discount for scholarly journals, "on the ground that it was not scientific."&lt;ref name=Scriptures&gt;Saunders, Ernest W., 'Journal', in chapter 8, [http://www.sbl-site.org/SSchapter8.aspx 'Of the Making of Books'], of ''Searching the Scriptures: A History of the Society of Biblical Literature, 1880-1980'', (Chico: Scholars' Press, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Journal of the Society for Biblical Literature in the United States was published in Leipzig through World War I down to the Nazi period—yet for the most part this feature showed up only when it became a problem for delivery after Germany began to be devastated after 1916."&lt;ref&gt;
Martin E. Marty, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3260316 Review of ''Searching the Scriptures'',] ''Journal of Biblical Literature'' '''103''' (1984): 85-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samuel Sharpe (scholar)|Samuel Sharpe]], an English [[Minister (Christianity)|ordained minister]] and [[Egyptology|egyptologist]] was editor of a journal also called ''Journal of Bibilical Literature'', published from London prior to the establishment of SBL and its journal.

The '''''Journal of Graphics Tools''''' (JGT) was a quarterly [[peer-reviewed]] [[scientific journal]] covering [[computer graphics]]. It was established in 1996 and published by [[A K Peters, Ltd.]], now part of [[Taylor &amp; Francis]]. From 2009-2011 the journal was published as the '''''Journal of Graphics, GPU, &amp; Game Tools'''''. In 2012, a large part of the [[editorial board]] resigned to form the [[open access]] ''Journal of Computer Graphics Techniques'' (JCGT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McGuire |first=Morgan |title=Journal of Computer Graphics Techniques |url=http://jcgt.org |publisher=JCGT |accessdate=1 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Journal of Graphics Tools'' continued with a new editorial board. The last [[editor-in-chief]] is Francesco Banterle ([[Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell'Informazione]]). Previous editors-in-chief have been Andrew Glassner, Ronen Barzel, Doug Roble, and Morgan McGuire. The final volume was released in 2013 and the journal formally ceased with its final issue in 2015.

{{update|carbon tax/ETS as the relevant legislation has been repealed|date=July 2014|inaccurate=yes}}

'''Mitigation of global warming''' involves taking actions to reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions and to enhance sinks aimed at reducing the extent of [[global warming]]. This is in distinction to [[adaptation to global warming]], which involves taking action to minimise the effects of global warming. [[Scientific opinion on climate change|Scientific consensus on global warming]], together with the precautionary principle and the fear of non-linear climate transitions, is leading to increased effort to develop new technologies and sciences and carefully manage others in an attempt to mitigate global warming.

[[Carbon capture and storage|Carbon capture and storage (CCS)]] for [[coal-fired power station]]s has been put forward as a solution to rising greenhouse gas emissions. However, CCS cannot deliver in time to avoid dangerous increases in temperatures, as widespread commercial use of CCS is not expected before 2030.

Following the introduction of government [[mandatory renewable energy targets]], more opportunities have opened up for [[renewable energy]] technologies such as [[wind power]], [[photovoltaics]], and [[solar thermal]] technologies. The deployment of these technologies provides opportunities for mitigating greenhouse gases.

A [[Carbon pricing in Australia|carbon price]] was introduced on 1 July 2012 by the government of [[Julia Gillard]] with the purpose of reducing [[Australia]]'s carbon emissions. It requires large businesses (defined as those with annual [[carbon dioxide equivalent]] emissions over 25,000 [[tonne]]s annually) to pay a price for emissions permits. The tax was scrapped by the [[Tony Abbott|Abbott government]] in July 2014 in what was a widely criticised and highly publicised move.

==Government policy==

Some components of the [[Government of Australia|government's]] emissions reductions strategy have been:
* the [[Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme|Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS)]] (which was a proposal for an emissions trading scheme that would have established a market in greenhouse gas permits);
* the Renewable Energy Target;
* "investment in renewable energy technologies and in the demonstration of carbon capture and storage";
* "action on energy efficiency."&lt;ref&gt;[http://climatechange.gov.au/whitepaper/report/index.html CPRS White Paper], Chapter 1, page 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carbon Trading and Emission Trading Scheme==
{{Main|Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme}}
In June 2007, former Australian Prime Minister, [[John Howard]], announced that Australia would adopt a Carbon Trading Scheme  by 2012. The scheme was expected to be the same as the counterpart in United States and European Union using carbon credits, where businesses must purchase a license in order to generate pollution.

The scheme received broad criticism from both the [[Australian Labor Party|ALP]] and [[Australian Greens|Greens]]. The ALP believed that the scheme was too weak as well as a bad political move by the government. The lack of clear target by the government for this scheme before the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 federal election]] produced a high degree of skepticism on the willingness of the government on mitigation of global warming in Australia.

In March 2008, the newly elected Labor government of Prime Minister [[Kevin Rudd]] announced that the [[Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme]] (a cap-and-trade emissions trading system) would be introduced in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.planetark.com/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/48946/story.htm  | title = Australian Carbon Trade to Boost Affordable Energy |publisher=Planet Ark |date=2008-06-24 |accessdate=2009-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; however this scheme was initially delayed by a year to mid-2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Peter |last=Smith | url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8fe917cc-390c-11de-8cfe-00144feabdc0.html  | title =Rudd delays carbon trading |newspaper=The Financial Times |date=2009-05-05 |accessdate=2009-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently delayed further until 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.climatechange.gov.au/en/media/whats-new/cprs-delayed.aspx |title=Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme  |publisher=Australian Government Department of Climate Change and Energy |date=2010-05-05 |accessdate=2010-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, Kevin Rudd announced the delay the CPRS until after the commitment period of the [[Kyoto Protocol]], which ends in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.climatechange.gov.au/en/media/whats-new/cprs-delayed.aspx | title = CPRS Delayed}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reasons given were the lack of [[bipartisan]] support for the CPRS and slow international progress on climate action for the delay.

The Federal Opposition strongly criticised the delay&lt;ref name="cprs-aust"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kelly|first=Joe|title=Tony Abbott accuses Kevin Rudd of lacking 'guts' to fight for ETS|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/tony-abbott-accuses-kevin-rudd-of-lacking-guts-to-fight-for-ets/story-e6frg6xf-1225859266626|work=[[The Australian]]|publisher=[[News Limited]]|date=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did community and grassroots action groups such as [[GetUp]].&lt;ref name="age-cprs10"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hartcher|first=Peter|title=It's time for Labor to fret |url=http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/politics/its-time-for-labor-to-fret-20100430-tz7s.html|work=[[The Age]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|date=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carbon taxation==
{{main|Carbon tax in Australia}}
Another method of [[mitigation of global warming]] considered by the Australian Government is a [[carbon tax]]. This method would involve imposing an additional tax on the use of [[fossil fuel]]s to generate energy. Compared to the CPRS and CTS/ETS, a carbon tax would set the cost for all carbon emissions, while the cap itself would be left unattended, allowing [[free market]] movements.

This tax would primarily be aimed to reduce the use of fossil fuels for energy generation, and also look to increase [[efficient energy use]] and increase demand for [[Alternative energy|alternative energies]].&lt;ref name="cis-ct"&gt;{{cite web|title=Exploring a Carbon Tax for Australia|url=http://www.cis.org.au/policy_monographs/pm80.pdf|publisher=Centre for Independent Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A carbon tax was introduced by the government of [[Julia Gillard]] on 1 July 2012. It requires businesses emitting over 25,000 tonnes of [[carbon dioxide equivalent]] emissions annually to purchase emissions permits, which initially cost [[A$]]23 for one [[tonne]] of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent. The tax was repealed by the Australian senate on 17 July 2014.

==Coal==
{{See also|Coal mining in Australia}}
Reduction in the mining, use and export of coal is favoured by environmental groups such as [[Greenpeace Australia Pacific|Greenpeace]]. The Government prefers to support attempts to develop so-called "clean coal" [[Coal pollution mitigation|pollution mitigation]], and, in early 2009, had support from then opposition leader [[Malcolm Turnbull]] for this.&lt;ref name="turnbull"&gt;{{cite news |first=Danielle |last=Cronin |url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/local/news/general/turnbull-promises-better-cheaper-plan-to-tackle-climate-change/1415416.aspx?storypage=0 |title=Turnbull promises better, cheaper plan to tackle climate change |newspaper=The Canberra Times|date=2009-01-24 |accessdate=2010-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dr [[Mark Diesendorf]], a Senior Lecturer at the Institute of Environmental Studies at the [[University of New South Wales]], Australia, and a former principal research scientist with the Australian [[CSIRO|Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)]], the continent produced about 200 million tons (Mt) of [[carbon dioxide|carbon dioxide equivalent]] in 2004. Almost all of the coal emissions were emitted by [[list of proposed coal fired power stations in Australia|coal fired power stations]]. On top of this coal is responsible for 42.1% of Australia's [[greenhouse gas|greenhouse gas emissions]], not counting export coal, based on 2004 GHG inventory.

Two forms of [[coal]] are mined in Australia, depending on the region: high quality black coal and lower quality [[Lignite|brown coal]]. Black coal is mainly found in [[Queensland]] and [[New South Wales]], and is used for both domestic power generation and for export overseas. It is normally mined underground before being transported to power stations, or export shipping terminals. Brown coal is mainly found in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[South Australia]], and is of lower quality due a higher ash and water content. Today there are three open cut brown coal mines in Victoria used for [[Base load power plant|baseload power generation]].

[[Coal]] is the most polluting of all [[fossil fuels]], and the single greatest threat to the climate.&lt;ref name="rochon6"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rochon|first=Emily |title=False Hope: Why carbon capture and storage won't save the climate|year=2008|publisher=Greenpeace International|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every stage of coal use brings substantial environmental damage.&lt;ref name="Diesendorf215"&gt;{{cite book|last=Diesendorf|first=Mark |title=[[Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy]]|year=2007|publisher=UNSW Press|pages=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phasing out dirty, unsustainable energy is one of the most important elements to [[climate change mitigation]].&lt;ref name="Teske12"&gt;{{cite book|last=Teske|first=Sven|title=energy [r]evolution: A Sustainable Energy Australia Outlook|year=2008|publisher=Greenpeace International, European Renewable Energy Council (EREC)|pages=12|author2=Vincent, Julien}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today coal supplies almost one quarter of the worlds energy.&lt;ref name="Teske17"&gt;{{cite book|last=Teske|first=Sven|title=energy [r]evolution: A Sustainable Energy Australia Outlook|year=2008|publisher=Greenpeace International, European Renewable Energy Council (EREC)|pages=17|author2=Vincent, Julien}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown coal is by far the most polluting, and is currently used in Victoria. In order to have significant effects on greenhouse gas emissions, there needs to be a replacement of coal energy with gas within Victoria.

==Carbon capture and storage==
{{See also|Carbon capture and storage in Australia}}
The [[Rudd-Gillard Government]] stated support for research into [[Carbon capture and storage in Australia|carbon capture and storage CCS]] as a possible solution to rising greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with [[Richard Denniss]]; {{cite episode | credits = [[Margot O'Neill]] | title = Clean coal fails to capture critics | series = Lateline | serieslink = Lateline | airdate = 2009-04-16 | seriesno = 19 | number = 10 | transcripturl = http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2008/s2544000.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; CCS is an integrated process, made up of three distinct parts: carbon capture, transport, and storage (including measurement, monitoring and verification).&lt;ref name=rochon6 /&gt; Capture technology aims to produce a concentrated stream of [[carbon dioxide|{{CO2}}]] that can be compressed, transported, and stored. Transport of captured {{CO2}} to storage locations is most likely to be via pipeline. Storage of the captured carbon is the final part of the process.&lt;ref name=rochon6 /&gt; The vast majority of {{CO2}} storage is expected to occur in geological sites on land, or below the seabed. Disposing of waste {{CO2}} in the ocean has also been proposed, but this method has been largely discounted due to the significant impacts {{CO2}} would have on the ocean ecosystem and legal constraints that effectively prohibit it.&lt;ref name=rochon6 /&gt;

However, according to the [[Greenpeace|Greenpeace False Hope Report]], CCS cannot deliver in time to avoid a dangerous increase in world temperatures. The earliest timeframe for deployment of CCS is not expected before 2030, and global emissions need to start falling well before that.

The Report also states that CCS wastes energy, and uses between 10-40% of the energy produced by a power station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abanades|first=J. C.|title=Summary for Policymakers in IPCC, Special Report on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, U.K.|editor=Metz, B.|display-authors=etal|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also asserts that CCS is expensive, potentially doubling plant costs, and is very risky, as permanent storage cannot be guaranteed.

==Nuclear energy==
{{See also|Nuclear Power in Australia}}
In terms of resources, aside from its strong production of low-cost coal and natural gas, Australia has approximately 40% of the world's [[uranium]] deposits, and is considered to be the second largest producer of uranium behind [[Canada]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}  Nuclear technology offers significant generation capability.   Claiming that it is carbon-free, some claim that increased reliance on [[nuclear power]] could reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions which cause [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;Massachusetts Institute of Technology,[http://web.mit.edu/nuclearpower/pdf/nuclearpower-full.pdf The Future of Nuclear Power]&lt;/ref&gt;   Others dispute this claim, pointing out that large amounts of fossil fuels are burned to construct, operate, and maintain these facilities.&lt;ref name="Diesendorf252"&gt;{{cite book|last=Diesendorf|first=Mark |title=[[Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy]]|year=2007|publisher=UNSW Press|pages=252–254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other perceived problems include that [[enriched uranium]] can also be used as a nuclear weapon, prompting security issues such as [[nuclear proliferation]]. Also [[Radioactive waste|nuclear waste]] requires extensive waste management because it can remain radioactive for centuries.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

The only nuclear reactor in Australia is currently located at [[Nuclear Power in Australia|Lucas Heights]], and it has had leaks of water into [[heavy water]] since its completion, reducing public confidence in nuclear power plants in Australia.{{citation needed|date=January 2011|reason=This needs a cite and maybe some clarifying}}

==Renewable energy==
{{Main|Renewable energy in Australia}}
[[Image:Wattle Point windmill.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The information centre near the base of one of the towers at [[Wattle Point Wind Farm]]]]
[[Renewable energy]] technologies currently contribute about 6% of [[Australia]]'s total energy supply and some 8% of Australia's electricity supply, with [[hydro-electricity]] by far the largest single contributor.&lt;ref name="puff"&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/environment/how-solar-ran-out-of-puff/2007/04/16/1176696757654.html# How solar ran out of puff] ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 17 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian Government has announced a [[mandatory renewable energy targets|mandatory renewable energy target (MRET)]] to ensure that renewable energy obtains a 20% share of electricity supply in Australia by 2020. To ensure this, the government has committed that the MRET will increase from 9,500 gigawatt-hours to 45,000 gigawatt-hours by 2020. After 2020 the proposed ETS and improved efficiencies from innovation and in manufacture are expected to allow the MRET to be phased out by 2030.

Following the introduction of government Mandatory Renewable Energy Targets,&lt;ref name="puff" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Australian Government, [http://www.orer.gov.au/ Office of the Renewable Energy Regulator] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504235738/http://www.orer.gov.au/ |date=2007-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; more opportunities have opened up for renewable energies such as [[wind power]], [[photovoltaics]], and [[solar thermal]] technologies. The deployment of these technologies provides opportunities for mitigating [[greenhouse gases]].&lt;ref name="IEA"&gt;International Energy Agency (2007).
[http://www.iea.org/textbase/papers/2006/renewable_factsheet.pdf ''Renewables in global energy supply: An IEA facts sheet''], OECD, 34 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2006, Australia had 817 [[megawatts|megawatts (MW)]] of installed wind power capacity,&lt;ref&gt;Global Wind Energy Council,[http://www.gwec.net/uploads/media/07-02_PR_Global_Statistics_2006.pdf Global wind energy markets continue to boom – 2006 another record year] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110407175732/http://www.gwec.net/uploads/media/07-02_PR_Global_Statistics_2006.pdf |date=2011-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; mainly in South Australia. A 154 MW, A$420 million, [[solar power station in Victoria|solar photovoltaic power station]] is planned for Victoria.&lt;ref name="advance"&gt;[http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/article613720.ece Australia advances with solar power] ''The Times'', 26 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
Initiatives are also being taken with [[ethanol fuel]] and [[geothermal energy]] exploration.&lt;ref name="Hot rocks"&gt;[http://www.mineweb.net/mineweb/view/mineweb/en/page38?oid=20361&amp;sn=Detail Big energy role for central Australia’s hot rocks] ''Mineweb'', 2 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wind power===
{{Main|Wind power in Australia}}
[[Wind farm]]s are highly compatible with agricultural and pastoral land use. While they span approximately 25 ha per MW of installed capacity, only about 1-3% of that land is actually taken up with their towers, access roads and other equipment.&lt;ref name="Diesendorf112"&gt;{{cite book|last=Diesendorf|first=Mark |title=[[Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy]]|year=2007|publisher=UNSW Press|pages=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wind turbine]]s are also extremely efficient. Large [[wind turbine]]s convert about 45% of the wind passing through the area swept out by the blades into electricity; by comparison, modern coal-fired power stations convert to electricity only 35% of the energy stored in coal.&lt;ref name="Diesendorf113"&gt;{{cite book|last=Diesendorf|first=Mark |title=[[Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy]]|year=2007|publisher=UNSW Press|pages=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some experts, wind energy, at appropriate sites, is the most economical of all renewable energy sources other than large-scale hydro-electricity.&lt;ref name="Diesendorf124"&gt;{{cite book|last=Diesendorf|first=Mark |title=[[Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy]]|year=2007|publisher=UNSW Press|pages=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bioenergy===
{{Main|Biofuel in Australia}}
[[Bioenergy]] is energy produced from [[biomass]].&lt;ref name="Diesendorf128"&gt;{{cite book|last=Diesendorf|first=Mark |title=[[Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy]]|year=2007|publisher=UNSW Press|pages=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biomass is material produced by photosynthesis, or is an organic by-product from a waste stream. Thus it can be seen as stored solar energy.&lt;ref name="Diesendorf128" /&gt; In terms of reducing [[greenhouse gas|greenhouse gas emissions]], biomass offers four different types of contribution:
*solid, liquid and gaseous [[biofuel in Australia|biofuels]] can substitute for fossil fuels in the generation of electricity and useful heat;
*liquid and gaseous biofuels can substitute  for oil in transportation;
*biomass can be used in place of many greenhouse intensive materials;
*biomass can be converted to [[biochar]], an organic char coal that greatly enhances the ability of soil to sequester carbon.&lt;ref name="Diesendorf129"&gt;{{cite book|last=Diesendorf|first=Mark |title=[[Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy]]|year=2007|publisher=UNSW Press|pages=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sustainable energy expert [[Mark Diesendorf]] suggests that bioenergy could produce 39% of Australia’s electricity generation.&lt;ref name="Diesendorf151"&gt;{{cite book|last=Diesendorf|first=Mark |title=[[Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy]]|year=2007|publisher=UNSW Press|pages=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solar heat and electricity===
{{Main|Solar power in Australia}}
[[Solar cells|Solar heat and electricity]] together have the potential for supplying almost all of Australia’s stationary energy.&lt;ref name="Diesendorf169"&gt;{{cite book|last=Diesendorf|first=Mark |title=[[Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy]]|year=2007|publisher=UNSW Press|pages=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; With suitable government policies, particularly at the state and local levels, [[solar hot water]] could cost-effectively provide the vast majority of hot water systems in Australia, and make considerable reductions in residential electricity consumption.&lt;ref name="Diesendorf169" /&gt; Although solar electricity is still expensive, its potential scale of application is huge and its prospects for further substantial cost reductions are excellent.

==Energy efficiency==
{{Main|Green building in Australia}}
{{See also|Efficient energy use}}
The most important energy saving options include improved [[thermal insulation]] and building design, super efficient electrical machines and drives, and a reduction in energy consumption by vehicles used for goods and passenger traffic. Industrialised countries such as Australia, which currently use energy in the least efficient way, can reduce their consumption drastically without the loss of either housing comfort or amenity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energyblueprint.info/fileadmin/media/documents/national/australia_report.pdf Energy Revolution: A sustainable Australia Energy Outlook] p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Increased energy efficiency of buildings had the support of the former leader of the federal opposition, Malcolm Turnbull.&lt;ref name="turnbull"/&gt;

==Biochar==
[[Biochar]] has been promoted as a technique for mitigation of global warming. The former leader of the federal opposition, Malcolm Turnbull brought biochar into the political debate by announcing that burying agricultural waste was one of three under-invested areas that his mitigation strategy was committed to opening up.&lt;ref name="turnbull"/&gt;

Publications and interest groups which track the fledgling Australian industry are divided over the suitability of biochar to the economy. Brian Toohey of ''[[The Australian Financial Review]]'' has said it is yet to be proven commercially viable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Toohey | first = Brian | title = A perfect green solution − in theory | work = The Weekend Australian Financial Review | page = 22 | date = 2008-12-30 | url = http://afr.com/home/viewer.aspx?EDP://20081230000030687165&amp;section=industry-energy_utilities&amp;title=A+perfect+green+solution+-+in+theory | accessdate = 2009-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friends of the Earth Australia]], one of the larger environmental lobby groups, is fundamentally opposed to biochar, calling it "part of a series of false solutions to climate change" which will be "based on large-scale industrial plantations and will lead to the acquisition of large tracts of land, furthering the erosion of indigenous peoples' and community rights while not adequately addressing the climate crisis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Senjen |first=Rye |title=Biochar − another dangerous technofix |work=Chain Reaction |issue=106 |date=August 2009 |pages=9–10 |url=http://www.foe.org.au/resources/chain-reaction/editions/chain-reaction-106/biochar-2212-another-dangerous-technofix/ |accessdate=2009-09-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003162307/http://www.foe.org.au/resources/chain-reaction/editions/chain-reaction-106/biochar-2212-another-dangerous-technofix |archivedate=October 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Green Left Weekly]]'' has published several editorials supporting the development of a large-scale biochar industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Clarke | first = Renfrey | title = Can biochar help stop climate change? | work = Green Left Weekly | issue = 789 | date = 2009-04-01 | page = 11 | url = http://www.greenleft.org.au/2009/789/40643 | accessdate = 2009-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reforestation==
Reforestation and revegetation were promoted by Malcolm Turnbull as a favoured option for reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name="turnbull"/&gt;

== Renewable energy targets==
{{main article|Energy policy of Australia#Renewable energy targets}}
{{See also|Renewable energy in Australia#Renewable energy programmes}}
An Expanded Renewable Energy Target was passed by the Australian Parliament on 20 August 2009, to ensure that renewable energy achieves a 20% share of electricity supply in Australia by 2020. To ensure this the Federal Government has committed that the [[MRET]] will increase from 9,500 gigawatt-hours to 45,000 gigawatt-hours by 2020. The scheme lasts until 2030.&lt;ref&gt;[Australian Government: Office of the Renewable Energy Regulator {{cite web |url=http://www.orer.gov.au/legislation/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026000000/http://www.orer.gov.au/legislation/index.html |archivedate=2011-10-26 |df= }}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pathways for climate change mitigation==

===Greenpeace energy revolution===
{{See also|Greenpeace}}
[[Greenpeace]] calls for a complete energy revolution. There are some fundamental aspects to this revolution, aimed as changing the way that energy is produced, distributed and consumed.&lt;ref name="Teske6"&gt;{{cite book|last=Teske|first=Sven|title=energy [r]evolution: A Sustainable Energy Australia Outlook|year=2008|publisher=Greenpeace International, European Renewable Energy Council (EREC)|pages=6|author2=Vincent, Julien}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five principles of this revolution are:
*implement renewable solutions, especially through decentralised energy systems;
*respect the natural limits of the environment;
*phase out dirty, unsustainable energy sources;
*create greater equity in the use of resources;
*decouple economic growth from the consumption of fossil fuels.&lt;ref name="Teske6" /&gt;

Other goals of the energy revolution are:
*renewable energy: 40% of electricity provided by renewable sources by 2020;
*coal-fired power will be phased out entirely by 2030;
*using electricity for the transport system and cutting consumption of fossil fuels through efficiency.

The energy revolution report also looks at policy suggestions for the Australian Government in regards to climate change. Policy suggestions of the report include:
*legislate a greenhouse gas reduction target of greater than 40% below 1990 levels by 2020;
*establish an emissions trading scheme that delivers a decrease of our emissions in line with legislated interim targets;
*legislate a national target for 40% of electricity to be generated by renewable energy sources by 2020;
*massively invest in the deployment of renewable energy and strongly regulate for energy efficiency measures;
*establish an immediate moratorium on new coal-fired power stations and extensions to existing coal-fired power stations, and phase out existing coal-fired power stations in Australia by 2030;
*set a target of 2% per year to reduce Australia’s primary energy demand;
*ensure transitional arrangements for coal dependent communities that might be affected by the transition to a clean energy economy;
*redirect all public subsidies that encourage the use and production of fossil fuels towards implementing energy efficiency programs, deploying renewable energy and supporting the upgrading of public transport infrastructure;
*develop a highly trained “green” workforce through investment in training programs and apprenticeships.&lt;ref name="Teske8"&gt;{{cite book|last=Teske|first=Sven|title=energy [r]evolution: A Sustainable Energy Australia Outlook|year=2008|publisher=Greenpeace International, European Renewable Energy Council (EREC)|pages=8|author2=Vincent, Julien}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate Code Red: The case for a sustainability emergency===
{{Main|Climate Code Red}}
[[Climate Code Red]] states that the key strategies for cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero are resource efficiency backed up by the substitution of renewable energy for fossil fuel sources.&lt;ref name="spratt55"&gt;{{cite book|last=Spratt|first=David|title=Climate Code Red: The case for a sustainability emergency|year=2008|publisher=Friends of the Earth|pages=55|author2=Sutton, Phillip }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report sites ultra-efficient technologies and synergies, and wind power as ways in which to tackle the climate change problem within Australia.

Climate Code Red also has an outline for a rapid transition to a safe-climate economy. This plan includes:
*having the building capacity to plan, coordinate and allocate resources for high priority infrastructure projects and to invest sufficiently in the means to make safe-climate producer and consumer goods;
*fostering research and innovation to produce, develop and scale up the necessary technologies, products and processes;
*national building and industry energy efficiency programmes, including mandatory and enforceable minimum standards for domestic and commercial buildings, and the allocation of public resources to help householders, especially those with limited financial capacity, to reduce energy use;
*the rapid construction of capacity across a range of renewable technologies at both a national and micro level to produce sufficient electricity to allow the closure of the fossil fuel-fired generating industry;
*the conversion and expansion of Australia’s car industry to manufacture zero-emission vehicles for public and [[private transport]];
*the renewal and electrification of national and regional train networks to provide the capacity to shift all long-distance freight from road and air to rail;
{{further|High-speed rail in Australia}}
*providing safe-climate expertise, technologies, goods and services to less developed nations to support their transition to the post-carbon world;
*adjustment and reskilling programmes for workers, communities and industries affected by the impacts of global warming and by the transition to the new economy.&lt;ref name="spratt59"&gt;{{cite book|last=Spratt|first=David|title=Climate Code Red: The case for a sustainability emergency|year=2008|publisher=Friends of the Earth|pages=59|author2=Sutton, Phillip }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme}}

==Solutions==
There a number of ways to achieve the goals outlined above. This includes implementing clean, renewable solutions and decentralizing energy systems.&lt;ref name=Teske6 /&gt; Existing technologies are available to use energy effectively and ecologically, including the use of [[solar energy|solar]], [[wind power|wind]], and other renewable technologies, which have experienced double digit market growth globally in the last decade.&lt;ref name=Teske12 /&gt;

A large section of the scientific community believe that one of the real solutions to [[avoiding dangerous climate change]] lies in renewable energy and energy efficiency that can start protecting the climate today. Technically accessible renewable energy sources such as wind, wave, and solar, are capable of providing six times more energy than the world currently consumes.&lt;ref name="rochon5"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rochon|first=Emily |title=False Hope: Why carbon capture and storage won't save the climate|year=2008|publisher=Greenpeace International|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; As coal is one of the highest emitters of greenhouse gases, closing coal power stations is one of the most powerful tools for carbon emission reduction.

===Economic impact===
The economic impact of a 60% reduction of emissions by 2050 was modelled in 2006 in a study commissioned by the Australian Business Roundtable on Climate Change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessroundtable.com.au/html/documents.html The Allen Consulting Group - Deep Cuts in Greenhouse Gas Emissions - Economic, Social and Environmental Impacts for Australia]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Neutron star collision.ogv|thumb|200px|right|17 August 2017: [[Gravitational wave]] ([[GW170817]]) detected from merger of two [[neutron star]]s&lt;ref name="SM-20171016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20171016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20171016" /&gt; (00:23 video; artist concept).]]
A '''neutron star merger''' is a type of [[stellar collision]]. It occurs in a fashion similar to the rare brand of [[type Ia supernovae]] resulting from merging [[white dwarf]]s. When two [[neutron star]]s orbit each other closely, they [[inspiral|spiral inward]] as time passes due to [[gravitational radiation]]. When the two neutron stars meet, their merger leads to the formation of either a more massive neutron star, or a [[black hole]] (depending on whether the mass of the remnant exceeds the currently poorly known [[Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit]]). The merger can also create a magnetic field that is trillions of times stronger than that of Earth in a matter of one or two milliseconds. These events are believed to create [[gamma-ray burst#Short gamma-ray bursts|short gamma-ray bursts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosswog|first1=Stephan|year=2013|title=Astrophysics: Radioactive glow as a smoking gun|journal=Nature|volume=500|issue=7464|pages=535–6|bibcode=2013Natur.500..535R|doi=10.1038/500535a|pmid=23985867}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mergers are also believed to produce [[kilonovae]], which are transient sources of fairly [[isotropic]] longer wave electromagnetic radiation due to the [[radioactive decay]] of heavy [[r-process]] nuclei that are produced and ejected during the merger process.&lt;ref name=Tanvir2013&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature12505| pmid = 23912055| title = A 'kilonova' associated with the short-duration γ-ray burst GRB 130603B| journal = Nature| volume = 500| issue = 7464| pages = 547–9| year = 2013| last1 = Tanvir | first1 = N.

In October 2018, astronomers reported that [[GRB 150101B]], a [[gamma-ray burst]] event detected in 2015, may be directly related to the historic [[GW170817]], a [[gravitational wave]] event detected in 2017, and associated with the merger of two [[neutron star]]s. The similarities between the two events, in terms of [[gamma ray]], [[optical]] and [[x-ray]] emissions, as well as to the nature of the associated host [[Galaxy|galaxies]], are "striking", suggesting the two separate events may both be the result of the merger of neutron stars, and both may be a kilonova, which may be more common in the universe than previously understood, according to the researchers.&lt;ref name="EA-20181016"&gt;{{cite news |author=[[University of Maryland]] |title=All in the family: Kin of gravitational wave source discovered - New observations suggest that kilonovae -- immense cosmic explosions that produce silver, gold and platinum--may be more common than thought |url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-10/uom-ait101518.php |date=16 October 2018 |work=[[EurekAlert!]] |accessdate=17 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NC-20181016"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Troja, E. et al. |title=A luminous blue kilonova and an off-axis jet from a compact binary merger at z = 0.1341 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06558-7 |date=16 October 2018 |journal=[[Nature Communications]] |volume=9 |number=4089 (2018) |doi=10.1038/s41467-018-06558-7 |accessdate=17 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20181016"&gt;{{cite news |last=Mohon |first=Lee |title=GRB 150101B: A Distant Cousin to GW170817 |url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/chandra/images/grb-150101b-a-distant-cousin-to-gw170817.html |date=16 October 2018 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=17 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SPC-20181017"&gt;{{cite web |last=Wall |first=Mike |title=Powerful Cosmic Flash Is Likely Another Neutron-Star Merger |url=https://www.space.com/42158-another-neutron-star-crash-detected.html |date=17 October 2018 |work=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=17 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in October 2018, scientists presented a new third way (two earlier methods, one based on [[redshift]]s and another on the [[cosmic distance ladder]], gave results that do not agree), using information from [[gravitational wave]] events (especially those involving the merger of neutron stars, like [[GW170817]]), of determining the [[Hubble's law|Hubble Constant]], essential in establishing the rate of [[expansion of the universe]].&lt;ref name="PHYS-20181022"&gt;{{cite web |last=Lerner |first=Louise |title=Gravitational waves could soon provide measure of universe's expansion |url=https://phys.org/news/2018-10-gravitational-universe-expansion.html |date=22 October 2018 |work=[[Phys.org]] |accessdate=22 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NAT-20181017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chen |first1=Hsin-Yu |last2=Fishbach |first2=Maya |last3=Holz |first3=Daniel E. |title=A two per cent Hubble constant measurement from standard sirens within five years |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0606-0 |date=17 October 2018 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |doi=10.1038/s41586-018-0606-0 |accessdate=22 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The association of GW170817 with GRB 170817A in both space and time is strong evidence that neutron star mergers do create short gamma-ray bursts.  The subsequent detection of an SSS17a in the area in which GW170817 and GRB 170817A were known to have occurred and its having the expected characteristics for a kilonova is strong evidence that neutron star mergers do produce kilonovae.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2854">The '''New England Centenarian Study''' is a study of persons aged 100 and over ([[centenarian]]s) in the [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] area. It is one of the oldest, largest and most prestigious studies of its kind in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldhealth.net/news/the_new_england_centerian_study/|title=The New England Centerian Study|date=2005-12-02|publisher=WorldHealth.net|accessdate=1 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study began in 1994 and was originally focused on research into [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's]]. However, it soon became apparent that most centenarians did not have Alzheimer's even though other forms of [[dementia]] were common. So it transitioned into finding out why some people can live to 100 and others don't. Some findings included that centenarians had natural advantages, including large blood-platelet size. Studies for genes managed to identify only one major gene associated with longevity.

Researchers are now investigating more detailed genetic analysis including [[epigenetics]]. Formerly located at [[Harvard University]], the Study is now located at [[Boston University]] and led by Dr. [[Tom Perls]].

In 2006, an offshoot, the New England [[Supercentenarian]] Study, was begun.

A study of gene tests of hundreds of [[centenarian]]s reported in July 2010 that genetics plays an extremely important role in deciding who reaches that age. Centenarians rarely develop diseases of aging, and are more likely to bounce back from diseases. Led by Perls, the study was funded by the [[National Institute on Aging]]'s Division of [[Geriatrics]] and Clinical [[Gerontology]].&lt;ref name="keim71"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/07/centenarian-genetics/|title=Genetic Secrets of Living to 100|last=Keim|first=Brandon|date=July 1, 2010|publisher=Wired.com|accessdate=1 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stein71"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/01/AR2010070104287.html|title=New study of centenarians links certain genetic variations to a long lifespan|last=Stein|first=Rob|date=July 1, 2010|publisher=The Washington Post Company|accessdate=1 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Orthosilicic acid''' is the [[chemical compound]] with formula {{chem|Si(|OH|)|4}}. It is assumed to be present in dilute solutions of [[silicon dioxide]] (silica) {{chem|SiO|2}} in water. It can be synthesized in [[non-aqueous solution]]s.

==Introduction==
The term "silicic acid" has traditionally been used as a [[synonym]] for [[silicon dioxide]], SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, also known as "silica". Strictly speaking, silica is the [[anhydride]] of orthosilicic acid, Si(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, from which it can be obtained by a [[dehydration reaction]]. 
:Si(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;↓ + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
The solubility of silica in pure water is about 1.5mM, or less, depending on the solid state structure of the compound. Because the concentration of orthosilicic acid is so low, it has not been fully characterized. It has been predicted to be "a very weak acid".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pauling |first1=Linus |title=The nature of the chemical bond |date=1960 |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaka, New York |page=557 |edition=3rd.}}&lt;/ref&gt; More concentrated solutions of orthosilicic acid are unstable and turn into [[silica gel]] and other species.&lt;ref name=gye/&gt;

The situation changed in 2017, when the orthosilicic acid monomer was obtained by [[hydrogenolysis]] of tetrakis(benzoyloxy)silane, (Si(OCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, in solution in [[dimethylacetamide]] or related solvents. The crystal structure of this compound  was determined by [[X-ray crystallography]]. [[Neutron diffraction]] was also used to determine the location of the hydrogen atoms. Di-silicic acid was synthesized by hydrogenation of its hexa-benzoyloxy derivative, R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-SiOSi-R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, R=CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O. Cyclic trisilicic acid, Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and cyclic tetrasilicic acid, Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; were synthesized by variations of this method.&lt;ref name=synthesis&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Igarashi |first1=Masayasu |last2=Matsumoto |first2=Tomohiro |last3=Yagahashi |first3=Fujio |last4=Yamashita |first4=Hiroshi |last5=Ohhara |first5=Takashi |last6=Hanashima |first6=Takayasu |last7=Nakao |first7=Akiko |last8=Moyosh |first8=Taketo |last9=Sato |first9=Kazuhiko |last10=Shimada |first10=Shigeru |title=Non-aqueous selective synthesis of orthosilicic acid and its oligomers |journal=Nature Communications |date=2017 |volume=8  |issue=1 |pages=140 |doi=10.1038/s41467-017-00168-5|pmid=28747652|pmc=5529440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With these new discoveries, the term ''silicic acid'' has become ambiguous: it has been applied traditionally as a synonym for silica, SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but it can now also be used for the compound Si(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The traditional meaning is retained in this article when it was used as such in a cited publication.

==Plants and animals==
Outside the marine environment compounds of silicon have very little biological function. Small quantities of silica are absorbed from the soil by some plants, to be then excreted in the form of [[phytolith]]s.&lt;ref name=snyder&gt;G.H.Snyder (2001): "Methods for silicon analysis in plants, soils, and fertilizers". ''Studies in Plant Science'', volume 8, chapter 11, Pages 185-196 {{doi|10.1016/S0928-3420(01)80015-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subcutaneous injections of orthosilicic acid solutions (around 1%) in [[mice]] were found to cause local [[inflammation]] and [[edema]].  [[peritoneum|Peritoneal]] injections of 0.1 [[milliliter|mL]] of freshly prepared acid were often lethal. The toxicity decreased markedly as the solution aged, to the point that after the solution turned to a gel it had no effects other than mechanical ones.  The solutions were equally toxic when administed by [[intravenous injection]], but seasoned or gelled solutions were about as toxic as fresh ones.&lt;ref  name=gye&gt;W. E. Gye and W. J. Purdy (1922): "The Poisonous Properties of Colloidal Silica. I: The Effects of the Parenteral Administration of Large Doses" ''British Journal of Experimental Pathology'', volume 3, issue 2, pages 75–85. {{PMC|2047780}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research concerning the correlation of [[aluminium]] and [[Alzheimer's disease]] has included the ability of silicic acid in beer to reduce aluminium uptake in the digestive system as well as to increase renal excretion of aluminium &lt;ref name="pmid16988476"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Exley C, Korchazhkina O, Job D, Strekopytov S, Polwart A, Crome P |title=Non-invasive therapy to reduce the body burden of aluminium in Alzheimer's disease |journal=J.

''Dissolved silica'' (DSi) is a term used in the field of oceanography to describe the form of water-soluble [[silica]], which is assumed to be {{chem|Si(OH)|4}} (orthoslicic acid) or its conjugate bases (orthosilicate anions) such as {{chem|Si(OH)|3|O|-}} and {{chem|Si(OH)|2|O|2|2-}}. Theoretical computations indicate that the dissolution of silica in water proceeds through the formation of a {{chem|SiO|2}}·2{{chem|H|2|O}} complex and then orthosilicic acid.&lt;ref&gt;Bhaskar Mondal, Deepanwita Ghosh, and Abhijit K.

For many decades it was debated whether orthosilicic acid, Si(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, exists in [[aqueous solution]]s at ambient temperature;&lt;ref name = Iler&gt;{{cite book |last1=Iler |first1=Ralph K. |title=The Chemistry of Silica: Solubility, Polymerization, Colloid and Surface Properties and Biochemistry of Silica |date=1970 |publisher=Wley |location=New York |isbn= 978-0-471-02404-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; this uncertainty originated from the poor solubility of [[silicon dioxide]], SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

The [[solubility product|solubility]] of silicon dioxide in water strongly depends on its crystal structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fournier |first1=Robert O. |last2=Rowe |first2=Jack J. |title=The solubility of amorphous silica in water at high temperatures and high pressures |journal=American Mineralogist |date=1977 |volume=62 |pages=1052–1056|url=http://www.minsocam.org/ammin/AM62/AM62_1052.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The species that are present in a solution  in equilibrium with a solid have not been definitively characterised because of their low concentrations. Many authors have speculated that silicic acid may be present, at [[Molar concentration|sub-millimolar]] concentrations, in rivers, lakes and sea water.&lt;ref name="Iler"/&gt;

Orthosilicic acid was synthesized for the first time in the year 2017.&lt;ref name=synthesis&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Igarashi |first1=Masayasu |last2=Matsumoto |first2=Tomohiro |last3=Yagahashi |first3=Fujio |last4=Yamashita |first4=Hiroshi |last5=Ohhara |first5=Takashi |last6=Hanashima |first6=Takayasu |last7=Nakao |first7=Akiko |last8=Moyosh |first8=Taketo |last9=Sato |first9=Kazuhiko |last10=Shimada |first10=Shigeru |title=Non-aqueous selective synthesis of orthosilicic acid and its oligomers |journal=Nature Communications |date=2017 |volume=8  |issue=1 |pages=140 |doi=10.1038/s41467-017-00168-5|pmid=28747652|pmc=5529440}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was obtained by [[hydrogenolysis]] of tetrakis(benzoyloxy)silane, (Si(OCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, in solution in [[dimethylacetamide]] or related solvents. The crystal structure of this compound  was determined by [[X-ray crystallography]]. [[Neutron diffraction]] was also used to determine the location of the hydrogen atoms.

is a [[dehydration reaction]], not an [[acid-base reaction]]; in consequence, di-silicic acid cannot be easily obtained from  mono-silicic acid. Di-silicic acid was synthesized by hydrogenation of its hexa-benzoyloxy derivative, R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-SiOSi-R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, R=CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O.

'''Photometric stereo''' is a technique in [[computer vision]] for estimating the [[surface normals]] of objects by observing that object under different lighting conditions. It is based on the fact that the amount of light reflected by a surface is dependent on the orientation of the surface in relation to the light source and the observer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |url=http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~yingwu/teaching/EECS432/Notes/lighting.pdf

}}&lt;/ref&gt; By measuring the amount of light reflected into a camera, the space of possible surface orientations is limited. Given enough light sources from different angles, the surface orientation may be constrained to a single orientation or even overconstrained.

The technique was originally introduced by Woodham in 1980.&lt;ref name="Woodham1980"&gt;Woodham, R.J. 1980. Photometric method for determining surface orientation from multiple images.  Optical Engineerings 19, I, 139-144.&lt;/ref&gt;  The special case where the data is a single image is known as '''shape from shading''', and was analyzed by B. K. P. Horn in 1989.&lt;ref name="BKPHorn89"&gt;B. K. P. Horn, 1989. Obtaining shape from shading information. In B. K. P. Horn and M. J. Brooks, eds., Shape from Shading, pages 121–171. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Photometric stereo has since been generalized to many other situations, including extended light sources and non-[[Lambertian]] surface finishes.  Current research aims to make the method work in the presence of projected shadows, highlights, and non-uniform lighting.

==Basic Method==
Under Woodham's original assumptions — [[Lambertian reflectance]], known point-like distant light sources, and uniform [[albedo]] — the problem can be solved by inverting the linear equation &lt;math&gt;I = L \cdot n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is a (known) vector of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; observed intensities, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the (unknown) surface normal, and &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is a (known) &lt;math&gt;3 \times m&lt;/math&gt; matrix of normalized light directions.

This model can easily be extended to surfaces with non-uniform albedo, while keeping the problem linear.&lt;ref name="BarskyPetrou03"&gt;S. Barsky and Maria Petrou, 2003. The 4-source photometric stereo technique for 3-dimensional surfaces in the presence of highlights and shadows. In IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, vol. 25, issue 10, pages 1239-1252. IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt; Taking an albedo reflectivity of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, the formula for the reflected light intensity becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;I = k (L \cdot n)&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is square (there are exactly 3 lights) and non-singular, it can be inverted, giving:

:&lt;math&gt;L^{-1} I = k n&lt;/math&gt;

Since the normal vector is known to have length 1, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; must be the length of the vector &lt;math&gt;k n&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the normalised direction of that vector.
If &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is not square (there are more than 3 lights), a generalisation of the inverse can be obtained using the [[Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |url=http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~csverma/CS766_09/Stereo/stereo.html
  |title=Photometric Stereo

  |publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison
  |accessdate=2015-03-24
}}&lt;/ref&gt; by simply multiplying both sides with &lt;math&gt;L^T&lt;/math&gt; giving:

:&lt;math&gt;L^T I = L^T k (L \cdot n)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(L^T L)^{-1} L^T I = k n&lt;/math&gt;

After which the normal vector and albedo can be solved as described above.

==Non-Lambertian surfaces==
The classical photometric stereo problem concerns itself only with [[Lambertian reflectance|Lambertian surfaces]], with perfectly diffuse reflection. This is unrealistic for many types of materials, especially metals, glass and smooth plastics, and will lead to aberrations in the resulting normal vectors.

Many methods have been developed to lift this assumption. In this section, a few of these are listed.

===Specular reflections===
Historically, in [[computer graphics]], the commonly used model to render surfaces started with Lambertian surfaces and progressed first to include simple [[Specular reflection|specular reflections]]. Computer vision followed a similar course with photometric stereo. Specular reflections were among the first deviations from the Lambertian model. These are a few adaptations that have been developed.

* Many techniques ultimately rely on modelling the reflectance function of the surface, that is, how much light is reflected in each direction.&lt;ref&gt;Hemant D. Tagare and Rui J.P. de Figueiredo, 1991. A Theory of Photometric Stereo for a Class of Diffuse Non-Lambertian Surfaces. In IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, vol. 13, no. 2. IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt; This reflectance function has to be [[Inverse function|invertible]]. The reflected light intensities towards the camera is measured, and the inverse reflectance function is fit onto the measured intensities, resulting in a unique solution for the normal vector.

===General BRDFs and beyond===
According to the [[Bidirectional reflectance distribution function]] (BRDF) model, a surface may distribute the amount of light it receives in any outward direction. This is the most general known model for [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] surfaces. Some techniques have been developed to model (almost) general BRDFs. In practice, all of these require many light sources to obtain reliable data. These are methods in which surfaces with general BRDFs can be measured.

* Determine the explicit BRDF prior to scanning.&lt;ref&gt;Katsushi Ikeuchi, 1981. Determining Surface Orientations of Specular Surfaces by Using the Photometric Stereo Method. In IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, vol. PAMI-3, issue 6, pages 661-669. IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt; To do this, a different surface is required that has the same or a very similar BRDF, of which the actual geometry (or at least the normal vectors for many points on the surface) is already known.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Hertzmann and Steven M. Seitz, 2005. Example-Based Photometric Stereo: Shape Reconstruction with General, Verying BRDFs. In IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, vol. 27, no. 8. IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt; The lights are then individually shone upon the known surface, and the amount of reflection into the camera is measured. Using this information, a look-up table can be created that maps reflected intensities for each light source to a list of possible normal vectors. This puts constraints on the possible normal vectors the surface may have, and reduces the photometric stereo problem to an interpolation between measurements. Typical known surfaces to calibrate the look-up table with are spheres for their wide variety of surface orientations.
* Restricting the BRDF to be symmetrical.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Holroyd, Jason Lawrence, Greg Humphreys and Todd Zickler, 2008. A Photometric Approach for Estimating Normals and Tangents. In ACM SIGGRAPH Asia 2008 Papers, pages 133:1-133:9. ACM.&lt;/ref&gt; If the BRDF is symmetrical, the direction of the light can be restricted to a cone about the direction to the camera. Which cone this is depends on the BRDF itself, the normal vector of the surface, and the measured intensity. Given enough measured intensities and the resulting light directions, these cones can be approximated and therefore the normal vectors of the surface.

Some progress has been made towards modelling an even more general surfaces, such as [[Bidirectional reflectance distribution function#Related functions|Spatially Varying Bidirectional Distribution Functions]] (SVBRDF), [[Bidirectional scattering distribution function|Bidirectional surface scattering reflectance distribution functions]] (BSSRDF), and accounting for [[Diffuse reflection#Interreflection|interreflections]].&lt;ref&gt;Shree K. Nayar, Katsushi Ikeuchi and Takeo Kanade, 1991. Shape from interreflections. In International Journal of Computer Vision, vol. 6, number 3, pages 173-195.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miao Liao, Xinyu Huang and Ruigang Yang, 2011. Interreflection Removal for Photometric Stereo by Using Spectrum-dependent Albedo. In 2011 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 689-696. IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt; However, such methods are still fairly restrictive in photometric stereo. Better results have been achieved with [[structured light]].&lt;ref&gt;Tongbo Chen, Hendrik Lensch, Christian Fuchs and H.P. Seidel, 2007. Polarization and Phase-shifting for 3D Scanning of Translucent Objects. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2007, pages 1-8. IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt;

PCFGs extend [[context-free grammar]]s similar to how [[hidden Markov model]]s extend [[regular grammar]]s. Each [[Formal grammar#The syntax of grammars|production]] is assigned a probability. The probability of a derivation (parse) is the product of the probabilities of the productions used in that derivation. These probabilities can be viewed as parameters of the model, and for large problems it is convenient to learn these parameters via [[machine learning]]. A probabilistic grammar's validity is constrained by context of its training dataset.

PCFGs have application in areas as diverse as [[natural language processing]] to the study the structure of [[RNA]] molecules and design of [[programming language]]s. Designing efficient PCFGs has to weigh factors of scalability and generality. Issues such as grammar ambiguity must be resolved. The grammar design affects results accuracy. Grammar parsing algorithms have various time and memory requirements.

==Definitions==
'''Derivation:'''  The process of recursive generation of strings from a grammar.
                                           
'''[[Parsing]]:''' Finding a valid derivation using an automaton.

'''[[Parse tree|Parse Tree:]]''' The alignment of the grammar to a sequence.

An example of a parser for PCFG grammars is the [[pushdown automaton]]. The algorithm parses grammar nonterminals from left to right in a [[Stack (abstract data type)#Applications|stack-like]] manner. This [[Brute-force search|brute-force]] approach is not very efficient. In RNA secondary structure prediction variants of the '''[[CYK algorithm|Cocke–Younger–Kasami (CYK) algorithm]]''' provide more efficient alternatives to grammar parsing than pushdown automata.&lt;ref name="Durbin 1998" /&gt; Another example of a  PCFG parser is the Stanford Statistical Parser which has been trained using Treebank,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Klein|first=Daniel|author2=Manning, Christopher |title=Accurate Unlexicalized Parsing|journal=Proceedings of the 41st Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics|year=2003|pages=423–430|url=http://nlp.stanford.edu/~manning/papers/unlexicalized-parsing.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formal definition ==
Similar to a [[Context-free grammar|CFG]], a probabilistic context-free grammar {{mvar|G}}  can be defined by a quintuple:

:&lt;math&gt;G = (M, T, R, S, P)&lt;/math&gt;

where 
* {{mvar|M}}  is the set of non-terminal symbols
* {{mvar|T}}  is the set of terminal symbols
* {{mvar|R}}  is the set of production rules
* {{mvar|S}}  is the start symbol
* {{mvar|P}}  is the set of probabilities on production rules

==Relation with hidden Markov models==
PCFGs models extend [[context-free grammar]]s the same way as [[hidden Markov model]]s extend [[regular grammar]]s.

The [[Inside–outside algorithm|Inside-Outside algorithm]] is an analogue of the [[Forward-backward algorithm|Forward-Backward algorithm]]. It computes the total probability of all derivations that are consistent with a given sequence, based on some PCFG.  This is equivalent to the probability of the PCFG generating the sequence, and is intuitively a measure of how consistent the sequence is with the given grammar. The Inside-Outside algorithm is used in model [[Parameterization|parametrization]] to estimate prior frequencies observed from training sequences in the case of RNAs.

[[Dynamic programming]] variants of the [[CYK algorithm]] find the [[Viterbi algorithm|Viterbi parse]] of a RNA sequence for a PCFG model.  This parse is the most likely derivation of the sequence by the given PCFG.

==Grammar construction==
Context-free grammars are represented as a set of rules inspired from attempts to model natural languages.&lt;ref name="Chomsky_1957" /&gt; The rules are absolute and have a typical syntax representation known as [[Backus–Naur form]]. The production rules consist of terminal '''&lt;math&gt;\left \{a, b \right\}&lt;/math&gt;''' and non-terminal '''{{mvar|S}}''' symbols and a blank '''&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;''' may also be used as an end point.  In the production rules of CFG and PCFG the left side has only one nonterminal whereas the right side can be any string of terminal or nonterminals. In PCFG nulls are excluded.&lt;ref name="Durbin 1998" /&gt; An example of a grammar:
                                     
:                                     &lt;math&gt;
                                        S \to aS, S \to bS, S \to \epsilon
     &lt;/math&gt;                               
This grammar can be shortened using the '|' ('or') character into:

:                                     &lt;math&gt;    S\to aS | bS |\epsilon &lt;/math&gt;

Terminals in a grammar are words and through the grammar rules a non-terminal symbol is transformed into a string of either terminals and/or non-terminals. The above grammar is read as "beginning from a non-terminal {{mvar|S}} the emission can generate either {{mvar|a}} or {{mvar|b}} or &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;".
Its derivation is: 
:                                      &lt;math&gt;S \Rightarrow aS\Rightarrow abS\Rightarrow abbS \Rightarrow abb&lt;/math&gt;

[[Ambiguous grammar]] may result in ambiguous parsing if applied on [[homograph]]s since the same word sequence can have more than one interpretation. [[pun|Pun sentences]] such as the newspaper headline "Iraqi Head Seeks Arms" are an example of ambiguous parses.

One strategy of dealing with ambiguous parses (originating with grammarians as early as [[Pāṇini]]) is to add yet more rules, or prioritize them so that one rule takes precedence over others. This, however, has the drawback of proliferating the rules, often to the point where they become difficult to manage. Another difficulty is overgeneration, where unlicensed structures are also generated.

Probabilistic grammars circumvent these problems by ranking various productions on frequency weights, resulting in a "most likely" (winner-take-all) interpretation.  As usage patterns are altered in [[Historical linguistics|diachronic]] shifts, these probabilistic rules can be re-learned, thus updating the grammar.

Assigning probability to production rules makes a PCFG. These probabilities are informed by observing distributions on a training set of similar composition to the language to be modeled. On most samples of broad language, probabilistic grammars where probabilities are estimated from data typically outperform hand-crafted grammars. CFGs when contrasted with PCFGs are not applicable to RNA structure prediction because while they incorporate sequence-structure relationship they lack the scoring metrics that reveal a sequence structural potential &lt;ref name="Dowell 2004" /&gt;

==Weighted context-free grammar==
A '''weighted context-free grammar''' ('''WCFG''') is a more general category of [[context-free grammar]], where each production has a numeric weight associated with it. The weight of a specific [[parse tree]] in a WCFG is the product&lt;ref name=PCFG_WCFG_same&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1162/coli.2007.33.4.477|title=Weighted and Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars Are Equally Expressive|year=2007|last1=Smith|first1=Noah A.|last2=Johnson|first2=Mark|journal=Computational Linguistics|volume=33|issue=4|pages=477}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or sum&lt;ref name=sumWeightedCFG&gt;{{Cite book|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-68155-7_31|chapter=The Weighted Cfg Constraint|title=Integration of AI and OR Techniques in Constraint Programming for Combinatorial Optimization Problems|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|year=2008|last1=Katsirelos|first1=George|last2=Narodytska|first2=Nina|last3=Walsh|first3=Toby|isbn=978-3-540-68154-0|volume=5015|pages=323|chapter-url=https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=zKlk6bA3u3oC&amp;pg=PA323&amp;dq=isbn:9783540681540|citeseerx=10.1.1.150.1187}}&lt;/ref&gt; ) of all rule weights in the tree.  Each rule weight is included as often as the rule is used in the tree.  A special case of WCFGs are PCFGs, where the weights are ([[logarithm]]s of &lt;ref name=logLinear&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~mjohnson/papers/ESSLLI05-wcfgs.pdf#page=10 |title=log linear or Gibbs models|first=Mark |last=Johnson|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Statistical properties of probabilistic context-free grammars|first=Zhiyi|last=Chi|journal=Computational Linguistics|volume=25|issue=1|date=March 1999|pages=131–160|url=http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/J/J99/J99-1004.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821232432/http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/J/J99/J99-1004.pdf|archivedate=2010-08-21|df=}}
&lt;/ref&gt;) [[probability|probabilities]].

An extended version of the [[CYK algorithm]] can be used to find the "lightest" (least-weight) derivation of a string given some WCFG.

When the tree weight is the product of the rule weights, WCFGs and PCFGs can express the same set of [[probability distribution]]s.&lt;ref name=PCFG_WCFG_same/&gt;

==Applications==

===RNA structure prediction===
Energy minimization&lt;ref name="McCaskill 1990" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Juan 1999" /&gt; and PCFG provide ways of predicting RNA secondary structure with comparable performance.&lt;ref name="Eddy 1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sakakibara 1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Durbin 1998" /&gt; However structure prediction by PCFGs is scored probabilistically rather than by minimum free energy calculation. PCFG model parameters are directly derived from frequencies of different features observed in databases of RNA structures &lt;ref name="Dowell 2004" /&gt; rather than by experimental 
determination as is the case with energy minimization methods.&lt;ref name="Zuker 2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mathews 1999" /&gt;

The types of various structure that can be modeled by a PCFG include long range interactions, pairwise structure and other nested structures. However, pseudoknots can not be modeled.&lt;ref name="Eddy 1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sakakibara 1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Durbin 1998" /&gt; PCFGs extend CFG by assigning probabilities to each production rule. A maximum probability parse tree from the grammar implies a maximum probability structure. Since RNAs preserve their structures over their primary sequence; RNA structure prediction can be guided by combining evolutionary information from comparative sequence analysis with biophysical knowledge about a structure plausibility based on such probabilities. Also search results for structural homologs using PCFG rules are scored according to PCFG derivations probabilities. Therefore, building grammar to model the behavior of base-pairs and single-stranded regions starts with exploring features of structural [[multiple sequence alignment]] of related RNAs.&lt;ref name="Durbin 1998" /&gt; 
:                                            &lt;math&gt;S \to aSa | bSb | aa | bb&lt;/math&gt;

The above grammar generates a string in an outside-in fashion, that is the basepair on the furthest extremes of the terminal is derived first. So a string such as &lt;math&gt;aabaabaa&lt;/math&gt; is derived by first generating the distal {{mvar|a}}'s on both sides before moving inwards:
:                                           &lt;math&gt;S \Rightarrow aSa \Rightarrow aaSaa \Rightarrow aabSbaa \Rightarrow aabaabaa&lt;/math&gt;

A PCFG model extendibility allows constraining structure prediction by incorporating expectations about different features of an RNA . Such expectation may reflect for example the propensity for assuming a certain structure by an RNA.&lt;ref name="Dowell 2004" /&gt;  However incorporation of too much information may increase PCFG space and memory complexity and it is desirable that a PCFG-based model be as simple as possible.&lt;ref name="Dowell 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Knudsen 2003" /&gt;

Every possible string {{mvar|x}} a grammar generates is assigned a probability weight &lt;math&gt;P(x|\theta)&lt;/math&gt; given the PCFG model &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;. It follows that the sum of all probabilities to all possible grammar productions is  &lt;math&gt;\sum_{\text{x}}P(x|\theta)=1&lt;/math&gt;. The scores for each paired and unpaired residue explain likelihood for secondary structure formations. Production rules also allow scoring loop lengths as well as the order of base pair stacking hence it is possible to explore the range of all possible generations including suboptimal structures from the grammar and accept or reject structures based on score thresholds.&lt;ref name="Durbin 1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dowell 2004" /&gt;

====Implementations====
RNA secondary structure implementations based on PCFG approaches can be utilized in :
* Finding consensus structure by optimizing structure joint probabilities over MSA.&lt;ref name="Knudsen 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Knudsen 1999" /&gt;
* Modeling base-pair covariation to detecting homology in database searches.&lt;ref name="Eddy 1994" /&gt;
* pairwise simultaneous folding and alignment.&lt;ref name="Rivas 2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Holmes 2002" /&gt;

Different implementation of these approaches exist. For example, Pfold is used in secondary structure prediction from a group of related RNA sequences,&lt;ref name="Knudsen 2003" /&gt; covariance models are used in searching databases for homologous sequences and RNA annotation and classification,&lt;ref name="Eddy 1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gardner 2010" /&gt; RNApromo, CMFinder and TEISER are used in finding stable structural motifs in RNAs.&lt;ref name="Yao 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rabani 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodarzi 2012" /&gt;

====Design considerations====
PCFG design impacts the secondary structure prediction accuracy. Any useful structure prediction probabilistic model based on PCFG has to maintain simplicity without much compromise to prediction accuracy. Too complex a model of excellent performance on a single sequence may not scale.&lt;ref name="Durbin 1998" /&gt; A grammar based model should be able to:
* Find the optimal alignment between a sequence and the PCFG.
* Score the probability of the structures for the sequence and subsequences.
* Parameterize the model by training on sequences/structures.
* Find the optimal grammar parse tree (CYK algorithm).
* Check for ambiguous grammar (Conditional Inside algorithm).

The resulting of multiple parse trees per grammar denotes grammar ambiguity. This may be useful in revealing all possible base-pair structures for a grammar. However an optimal structure is the one where there is one and only one correspondence between the parse tree and the secondary structure.

Two types of ambiguities can be distinguished. Parse tree ambiguity and structural ambiguity. Structural ambiguity does not affect thermodynamic approaches as the optimal structure selection is always on the basis of lowest free energy scores.&lt;ref name="Dowell 2004" /&gt; Parse tree ambiguity concerns the existence of multiple parse trees per sequence. Such an ambiguity can reveal all possible base-paired structures for the sequence by generating all possible parse trees then finding the optimal one.&lt;ref name="Sipser 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrison 1978" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hopcroft 1979" /&gt; In the case of structural ambiguity multiple parse trees describe the same secondary structure. This obscures the CYK algorithm decision on finding an optimal structure as the correspondence between the parse tree and the structure is not unique.&lt;ref name="Giegerich 2000" /&gt; Grammar ambiguity can be checked for by the conditional-inside algorithm.&lt;ref name="Durbin 1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dowell 2004" /&gt;

====Building a PCFG model====
A probabilistic context free grammar consists of terminal and nonterminal variables. Each feature to be modeled has a production rule that is assigned a probability estimated from a training set of RNA structures. Production rules are recursively applied until only terminal residues are left.

A starting non-terminal &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\mathit{S}}&lt;/math&gt; produces loops. The rest of the grammar proceeds with parameter &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\mathit{L}}&lt;/math&gt; that decide whether a loop is a start of a stem or a single stranded region {{mvar|s}} and parameter &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\mathit{F}}&lt;/math&gt; that produces paired bases.

The formalism of this simple PCFG looks like:
:                                                &lt;math&gt;\mathit{S \to LS|L}&lt;/math&gt;
:                                                &lt;math&gt;\mathit{L \to s | dFd}&lt;/math&gt;
:                                                &lt;math&gt;\mathit{F \to dFd | LS}&lt;/math&gt;

The application of PCFGs in predicting structures is a multi-step process. In addition, the PCFG itself can be incorporated into probabilistic models that consider RNA evolutionary history or search homologous sequences in databases. In an evolutionary history context inclusion of prior distributions of RNA structures of a structural alignment in the production rules of the PCFG facilitates good prediction accuracy.&lt;ref name="Knudsen 1999" /&gt;

A summary of general steps for utilizing PCFGs in various scenarios:
 
* Generate production rules for the sequences.
* Check ambiguity.
* Recursively generate parse trees of the possible structures using the grammar. 
* Rank and score the parse trees for the most plausible sequence.&lt;ref name="Durbin 1998" /&gt;

====Algorithms====
Several algorithms dealing with aspects of PCFG based probabilistic models in RNA structure prediction exist. For instance the inside-outside algorithm and the CYK algorithm. The inside-outside algorithm is a recursive dynamic programming scoring algorithm that can follow [[Expectation-maximization algorithm|expectation-maximization]] paradigms. It computes the total probability of all derivations that are consistent with a given sequence, based on some PCFG. The inside part scores the subtrees from a parse tree and therefore subsequences probabilities given an PCFG. The outside part scores the probability of the complete parse tree for a full sequence.&lt;ref name="Lari and Young 1990" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lari and Young 1991" /&gt; CYK modifies the inside-outside scoring. Note that the term 'CYK algorithm' describes the CYK variant of the inside algorithm that finds an optimal parse tree for a sequence using a PCFG. It extends the actual [[CYK algorithm]] used in non-probabilistic CFGs.&lt;ref name="Durbin 1998" /&gt;

The inside algorithm calculates &lt;math&gt;\alpha(i,j,v)&lt;/math&gt; probabilities for all &lt;math&gt;i, j, v&lt;/math&gt;  of a parse subtree rooted at &lt;math&gt;W_v&lt;/math&gt; for subsequence &lt;math&gt;x_i,...,x_j&lt;/math&gt;. Outside algorithm calculates &lt;math&gt;\beta(i,j,v)&lt;/math&gt; probabilities of a complete parse tree for sequence {{mvar|x}} from root excluding the calculation of &lt;math&gt;x_i,...,x_j&lt;/math&gt;. The variables {{mvar|&amp;alpha;}} and {{mvar|&amp;beta;}} refine the estimation of probability parameters of an PCFG. It is possible to reestimate the PCFG algorithm by finding the expected number of times a state is used in a derivation through summing all the products of {{mvar|&amp;alpha;}} and {{mvar|&amp;beta;}} divided by the probability for a sequence {{mvar|x}} given the model &lt;math&gt;P(x|\theta)&lt;/math&gt;. It is also possible to find the expected number of times a production rule is used by an expectation-maximization that utilizes the values of {{mvar|&amp;alpha;}} and {{mvar|&amp;beta;}}.&lt;ref name="Lari and Young 1990" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lari and Young 1991" /&gt; The CYK algorithm calculates &lt;math&gt;\gamma(i, j, v)&lt;/math&gt; to find the most probable parse tree &lt;math&gt;\hat{\pi}&lt;/math&gt; and yields &lt;math&gt;\log P(x, \hat{\pi}|\theta)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Durbin 1998" /&gt;

Memory and time complexity for general PCFG algorithms in RNA structure predictions are &lt;math&gt;O(L^2M)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;O(L^3M^3)&lt;/math&gt; respectively. Restricting a PCFG may alter this requirement as is the case with database searches methods.

====PCFG in homology search====
Covariance models (CMs) are a special type of PCFGs with applications in database searches for homologs, annotation and RNA classification. Through CMs it is possible to build PCFG-based RNA profiles where related RNAs can be represented by a consensus secondary structure.&lt;ref name ="Eddy 1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sakakibara 1994" /&gt; The RNA analysis package Infernal uses such profiles in inference of RNA alignments.&lt;ref name="Nawrocki 2013" /&gt; The Rfam database also uses CMs in classifying RNAs into families based on their structure and sequence information.&lt;ref name="Gardner 2010" /&gt;

CMs are designed from a consensus RNA structure. A CM allows [[indel]]s of unlimited length in the alignment. Terminals constitute states in the CM and the transition probabilities between the states is 1 if no indels are considered.&lt;ref name="Durbin 1998" /&gt; Grammars in a CM are as follows:

:;         &lt;math&gt;P \to aWb&lt;/math&gt;:probabilities of pairwise interactions between 16 possible pairs
:;         &lt;math&gt;L \to aW&lt;/math&gt;:probabilities of generating 4 possible single bases on the left
:;         &lt;math&gt;R \to Wa&lt;/math&gt;:probabilities of generating 4 possible single bases on the right
:;         &lt;math&gt;B \to SS&lt;/math&gt;:bifurcation with a probability of 1
:;         &lt;math&gt;S \to W&lt;/math&gt;:start with a probability of 1
:;         &lt;math&gt;E \to \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;:end with a probability of 1

The model has 6 possible states and each state grammar includes different types of secondary structure probabilities of the non-terminals. The states are connected by transitions. Ideally current node states connect to all insert states and subsequent node states connect to non-insert states. In order to allow insertion of more than one base insert states connect to themselves.&lt;ref name="Durbin 1998" /&gt;

In order to score a CM model the inside-outside algorithms are used. CMs use a slightly different implementation of CYK. Log-odds emission scores for the optimum parse tree - &lt;math&gt;\log \hat{e}&lt;/math&gt; - are calculated out of the emitting states &lt;math&gt;P,~L,~R&lt;/math&gt;. Since these scores are a function of sequence length a more discriminative measure to recover an optimum parse tree probability score- &lt;math&gt;\log\text{P}(x, \hat{\pi}|\theta)&lt;/math&gt; - is reached by limiting the maximum length of the sequence to be aligned and calculating the log-odds relative to a null. The computation time of this step is linear to the database size and the algorithm has a memory complexity of &lt;math&gt;O(M_aD+M_bD^2)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Durbin 1998" /&gt;

==== Example: Using evolutionary information to guide structure prediction ====
The KH-99 algorithm by Knudsen and Hein lays the basis of the Pfold approach to predicting RNA secondary structure.&lt;ref name="Knudsen 2003" /&gt; In this approach the parameterization requires evolutionary history information derived from an alignment tree in addition to probabilities of columns and mutations. The grammar probabilities are observed from a training dataset.

===== Estimate column probabilities for paired and unpaired bases =====
In a structural alignment the probabilities of the unpaired bases columns and the paired bases columns are independent of other columns. By counting bases in single base positions and paired positions one obtains the frequencies of  bases in loops and stems.
For basepair {{mvar|X}} and {{mvar|Y}} an occurrence of &lt;math&gt;XY&lt;/math&gt; is also counted as an occurrence of &lt;math&gt;YX&lt;/math&gt;. Identical basepairs such as &lt;math&gt;XX&lt;/math&gt; are counted twice.

===== Calculate mutation rates for paired and unpaired bases =====
By pairing sequences in all possible ways overall mutation rates are estimated. In order to recover plausible mutations a sequence identity threshold should be used so that the comparison is between similar sequences. This approach uses 85% identity threshold between pairing sequences. 
First single base positions differences -except for gapped columns- between sequence pairs are counted such that if the same position in two sequences had different bases {{mvar|X, Y}} the count of the difference is incremented for each sequence.

 {{nowrap|while &lt;math&gt;X\ne Y&lt;/math&gt;}}
                {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;        C_{\text{XY}} +1&lt;/math&gt; first sequence  pair}}
                {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;        C_{\text{YX}} +1&lt;/math&gt; second sequence pair}}

 {{nowrap|Calculate mutation rates.}}
                {{nowrap|Let  &lt;math&gt;r_{\text{XY}}= &lt;/math&gt; mutation of base X to base Y &lt;math&gt;= \frac {K~C_{\text{XY}}} {P_{x}P_{s}}&lt;/math&gt;}}
                {{nowrap|Let  &lt;math&gt;r_{\text{XX}}= &lt;/math&gt; the negative of the rate of X mutation to other bases &lt;math&gt;= - \sum r_{\text{XY}}&lt;/math&gt;}}
                {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;P_{s} =&lt;/math&gt; the probability that the base is not paired.}}

For unpaired bases a 4 X 4 mutation rate matrix is used that satisfies that the mutation flow from X to Y is reversible:&lt;ref name="Tavaré 1986" /&gt;
:                &lt;math&gt;PX^rXY = PY^rYX&lt;/math&gt; 
For basepairs a 16 X 16 rate distribution matrix is similarly generated.&lt;ref name="Muse 1995" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schöniger  1994" /&gt;
The PCFG is used to predict the prior probability distribution of the structure whereas posterior probabilities are estimated by the inside-outside algorithm and the most likely structure is found by the CYK algorithm.&lt;ref name="Knudsen 2003" /&gt;

===== Estimate alignment probabilities =====
After calculating the column prior probabilities the alignment probability is estimated by summing over all possible secondary structures. Any column {{mvar|C}}  in a secondary structure &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; for a sequence {{mvar|D}} of length {{mvar|l}} such that &lt;math&gt;D=(C_1,~C_2, ...C_l )&lt;/math&gt; can be scored with respect to the alignment tree {{mvar|T}} and the mutational model {{mvar|M}}. The prior distribution given by the PCFG is &lt;math&gt;P(\sigma|M)&lt;/math&gt;. The phylogenetic tree, {{mvar|T}} can be calculated from the model by maximum likelihood estimation. Note that gaps are treated as unknown bases and the summation can be done through [[dynamic programming]].&lt;ref name="Baker 1979" /&gt; 
:       &lt;math&gt;P(D|T,M)&lt;/math&gt;
:               &lt;math&gt;=\sum P (D, \sigma |T,M)&lt;/math&gt;
:               &lt;math&gt;=\sum P(D|\sigma, T, M) P(\sigma|T,M)&lt;/math&gt;
:               &lt;math&gt;=\sum P(D|\sigma,T,M) P(\sigma|M)&lt;/math&gt;

===== Assign production probabilities to each rule in the grammar =====
Each structure in the grammar is assigned production probabilities devised from the structures of the training dataset. These prior probabilities give weight to predictions accuracy.&lt;ref name="Knudsen 1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lari and Young 1990" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lari and Young 1991" /&gt; The number of times each rule is used depends on the observations from the training dataset for that particular grammar feature. These probabilities are written in parenthesis in the grammar formalism and each rule will have a total of 100%.&lt;ref name="Knudsen 2003" /&gt; For instance:

:              &lt;math&gt; S \to LS (80\%) |L (20\%)&lt;/math&gt;
:              &lt;math&gt;L \to s (70\%) | dFd (30\%)&lt;/math&gt;
:              &lt;math&gt;F \to dFd (60.4\%)| LS (39.6\%)&lt;/math&gt;

===== Predict the structure likelihood =====
Given the prior alignment frequencies of the data the most likely structure from the ensemble predicted by the grammar can then be computed by maximizing &lt;math&gt;P(\sigma|D,T,M)&lt;/math&gt; through the CYK algorithm. The structure with the highest predicted number of correct predictions is reported as the consensus structure.&lt;ref name="Knudsen 2003" /&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{MAP}= \arg\underset{\sigma}\max P(D| \sigma,T^ML, M) P(\sigma|M)&lt;/math&gt;

===== Pfold improvements on the KH-99 algorithm =====
PCFG based approaches are desired to be scalable and general enough. Compromising speed for accuracy needs to as minimal as possible. Pfold addresses the limitations of the KH-99 algorithm with respect to scalability, gaps, speed and accuracy.&lt;ref name="Knudsen 2003" /&gt; 
*In Pfold gaps are treated as unknown. In this sense the probability of a gapped column equals that of an ungapped one. 
*In Pfold the tree {{mvar|T}} is calculated prior to structure prediction through neighbor joining and not by maximum likelihood through the PCFG grammar. Only the branch lengths are adjusted to maximum likelihood estimates. 
*An assumption of Pfold is that all sequences have the same structure. Sequence identity threshold and allowing a 1% probability that any nucleotide becomes another limit the performance deterioration due to alignment errors.

===Protein sequence analysis===
Whereas PCFGs have proved powerful tools for predicting RNA secondary structure, usage in the field of protein sequence analysis has been limited. Indeed, the size of the [[amino acid]] alphabet and the variety of interactions seen in proteins make grammar inference much more challenging.&lt;ref name="Searls D 2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Searls | first1 = D | year = 2013 | title = Review: A primer in macromolecular linguistics | url = | journal = Biopolymers | volume = 99 | issue = 3| pages = 203–217 | doi=10.1002/bip.22101| pmid = 23034580 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, most applications of [[formal language theory]] to protein analysis have been mainly restricted to the production of grammars of lower expressive power to model simple functional patterns based on local interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Krogh | first1 = A | last2 = Brown | first2 = M | last3 = Mian | first3 = I | last4 = Sjolander | first4 = K | last5 = Haussler | first5 = D | year = 1994 | title = Hidden Markov models in computational biology: Applications to protein modeling | url = | journal = J Mol Biol | volume = 235 | issue = 5| pages = 1501–1531 |doi=10.1006/jmbi.1994.1104 | pmid=8107089}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sigrist | first1 = C | last2 = Cerutti | first2 = L | last3 = Hulo | first3 = N | last4 = Gattiker | first4 = A | last5 = Falquet | first5 = L | last6 = Pagni | first6 = M | last7 = Bairoch | first7 = A | last8 = Bucher | first8 = P | year = 2002 | title = PROSITE: a documented database using patterns and profiles as motif descriptors | url = | journal = Brief Bioinform | volume = 3 | issue = 3| pages = 265–274 | doi=10.1093/bib/3.3.265 | pmid=12230035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since protein structures commonly display higher-order dependencies including nested and crossing relationships, they clearly exceed the capabilities of any CFG.&lt;ref name="Searls D 2013"/&gt; Still, development of PCFGs allows expressing some of those dependencies and providing the ability to model a wider range of protein patterns.

One of the main obstacles in inferring a protein grammar is the size of the alphabet that should encode the 20 different [[amino acids]]. It has been proposed to address this by using physico-chemical properties of [[amino acids]] to reduce significantly the number of possible combinations of right side symbols in production rules: 3 levels of a quantitative property are utilised instead of the 20 [[amino acid]] types, e.g. small, medium or large [[van der Waals volume]].&lt;ref name="Dyrka W 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dyrka | first1 = W | last2 = Nebel | first2 = J-C | year = 2009 | title = A Stochastic Context Free Grammar based Framework for Analysis of Protein Sequences | journal = BMC Bioinformatics | volume = 10 | issue = | page = 323 | doi=10.1186/1471-2105-10-323 | pmid=19814800 | pmc=2765975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on such a scheme, PCFGs have been produced to generate both [[binding site]] &lt;ref name="Dyrka W 2009"/&gt;  and helix-helix contact site descriptors.&lt;ref name="Dyrka W 2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dyrka | first1 = W | last2 = Nebel J-C | first2 = Kotulska M | year = 2013 | title = Probabilistic grammatical model of protein language and its application to helix-helix contact site classification | url = | journal = Algorithms for Molecular Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 1| page = 31 | doi=10.1186/1748-7188-8-31| pmid = 24350601 | pmc = 3892132 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A significant feature of those grammars is that analysis of their rules and parse trees can provide biologically meaningful information.&lt;ref name="Dyrka W 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dyrka W 2013"/&gt;

In [[computing]], a [[computer program]] or [[subroutine]] is called '''reentrant''' if it can be interrupted in the middle of its execution and then safely be called again ("re-entered") before its previous invocations complete execution. The interruption could be caused by an internal action such as a jump or call, or by an external action such as an [[interrupt]] or [[signal (computing)|signal]]. Once the reentered invocation completes, the previous invocations will resume correct execution.

This definition originates from single-threaded programming environments where the flow of control could be interrupted by an [[interrupt]] and transferred to an [[interrupt service routine]] (ISR). Any subroutine used by the ISR that could potentially have been executing when the interrupt was triggered should be reentrant. Often, subroutines accessible via the operating system [[kernel (computing)|kernel]] are not reentrant. Hence, interrupt service routines are limited in the actions they can perform; for instance, they are usually restricted from accessing the file system and sometimes even from allocating memory.

This definition of reentrancy differs from that of [[thread-safety]] in multi-threaded environments. A reentrant subroutine can achieve thread-safety,{{sfn|Kerrisk|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=2SAQAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA657 657]}} but being reentrant alone might not be sufficient to be thread-safe in all situations. Conversely, thread-safe code does not necessarily have to be reentrant (see below for examples).

Other terms used for reentrant programs include "pure procedure" or "sharable code".{{sfn|Ralston|2000|p=1514–1515}}

Reentrancy of a subroutine that operates on operating-system resources or non-local data depends on the [[atomicity (programming)|atomicity]] of the respective operations. For example, if the subroutine modifies a 64-bit global variable on a 32-bit machine, the operation may be split into two 32-bit operations, and thus, if the subroutine is interrupted while executing, and called again from the interrupt handler, the global variable may be in a state where only 32 bits have been updated. The programming language might provide atomicity guarantees for interruption caused by an internal action such as a jump or call. Then the function {{code|f}} in an expression like &lt;code&gt;(global:=1) + (f())&lt;/code&gt;, where the order of evaluation of the subexpressions might be arbitrary in a programming language, would see the global variable either set to 1 or to its previous value, but not in an intermediate state where only part has been updated. (The latter can happen in [[C programming language|C]], because the expression has no [[sequence point]].) The operating system might provide atomicity guarantees for [[signal (computing)|signals]], such as a system call interrupted by a signal not having a partial effect. The processor hardware might provide atomicity guarantees for [[interrupt]]s, such as interrupted processor instructions not having partial effects.

==Examples==
To illustrate reentrancy, this article uses as an example a [[C (programming language)|C]] utility function, {{code|swap()}}, that takes two pointers and transposes their values, and an interrupt-handling routine that also calls the swap function.

===Neither reentrant nor thread-safe===
This is an example swap function that fails to be reentrant or thread-safe. As such, it should not have been used in the interrupt service routine &lt;code&gt;isr()&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
int tmp;

void swap(int* x, int* y)
{
    tmp = *x;
    *x = *y;
    *y = tmp;    /* Hardware interrupt might invoke isr() here. */
}

void isr()
{
    int x = 1, y = 2;
    swap(&amp;x, &amp;y);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Thread-safe but not reentrant===
The function {{code|swap()}} in the preceding example can be made thread-safe by making {{code|tmp}} [[Thread-local storage|thread-local]]. It still fails to be reentrant, and this will continue to cause problems if {{code|isr()}} is called in the same context as a thread already executing {{code|swap()}}:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
_Thread_local int tmp;

void swap(int* x, int* y)
{
    tmp = *x;
    *x = *y;
    *y = tmp;    /* Hardware interrupt might invoke isr() here. */
}

void isr()
{
    int x = 1, y = 2;
    swap(&amp;x, &amp;y);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Reentrant but not thread-safe===
The following (somewhat contrived) modification of the swap function, which is careful to leave the global data in a consistent state at the time it exits, is reentrant; however, it is not thread-safe, since it does not ensure the global data is in a consistent state during execution:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
int tmp;

void swap(int* x, int* y)
{
    /* Save global variable. */
    int s;
    s = tmp;

    tmp = *x;
    *x = *y;
    *y = tmp;     /* Hardware interrupt might invoke isr() here. */

    /* Restore global variable. */
    tmp = s;
}

void isr()
{
    int x = 1, y = 2;
    swap(&amp;x, &amp;y);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Reentrant and thread-safe===
An implementation of {{code|swap()}} that allocates {{code|tmp}} on the [[call stack|stack]] instead of on the [[heap (programming)|heap]] is both thread-safe and reentrant:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
void swap(int* x, int* y)
{
    int tmp;
    tmp = *x;
    *x = *y;
    *y = tmp;    /* Hardware interrupt might invoke isr() here. */
}

void isr()
{
    int x = 1, y = 2;
    swap(&amp;x, &amp;y);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Background==
Reentrancy is not the same thing as [[idempotence]], in which the function may be called more than once yet generate exactly the same output as if it had only been called once. Generally speaking, a function produces output data based on some input data (though both are optional, in general). Shared data could be accessed by any function at any time. If data can be changed by any function (and none keep track of those changes), there is no guarantee to those that share a datum that that datum is the same as at any time before.

Data has a characteristic called [[Scope and extent|scope]], which describes where in a program the data may be used. Data scope is either [[global variable|global]] (outside the [[variable scope|scope]] of any function and with an indefinite extent) or [[Local variables, recursion and reentrancy|local]] (created each time a function is called and destroyed upon exit).

Local data is not shared by any routines, re-entering or not; therefore, it does not affect re-entrance. Global data is defined outside functions and can be accessed by more than one function, either in form of [[global variable]]s (data shared between all functions), or as [[static variable]]s (data shared by all functions of the same name). In [[object-oriented programming]], global data is defined in the scope of a class and can be private, making it accessible only to functions of that class. There is also the concept of [[instance variable]]s, where a class variable is bound to a class instance. For these reasons, in object-oriented programming, this distinction is usually reserved for the data accessible outside of the class (public), and for the data independent of class instances (static).

Reentrancy is distinct from, but closely related to, [[thread-safety]]. A function can be [[thread-safe]] and still not reentrant. For example, a function could be wrapped all around with a [[mutex]] (which avoids problems in multithreading environments), but, if that function were used in an interrupt service routine, it could starve waiting for the first execution to release the mutex. The key for avoiding confusion is that reentrant refers to only ''one'' thread executing. It is a concept from the time when no multitasking operating systems existed.

==Rules for reentrancy==
;Reentrant code may not hold any static or global non-constant data.
:Reentrant functions can work with global data. For example, a reentrant interrupt service routine could grab a piece of hardware status to work with (e.g., serial port read buffer) which is not only global, but volatile. Still, typical use of static variables and global data is not advised, in the sense that only [[atomic (computer science)|atomic]] [[read-modify-write]] instructions should be used in these variables (it should not be possible for an interrupt or signal to come during the execution of such an instruction). Note that in C, even a read or write is not guaranteed to be atomic; it may be split into several reads or writes.{{r|Preshing (2013)}} The C standard and SUSv3 provide &lt;code&gt;sig_atomic_t&lt;/code&gt; for this purpose, although with guarantees only for simple reads and writes, not for incrementing or decrementing.{{sfn|Kerrisk|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=2SAQAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA428 428]}} More complex atomic operations are available in [[C11 (C standard revision)|C11]], which provides &lt;code&gt;stdatomic.h&lt;/code&gt;.
;Reentrant code may not [[self-modifying code|modify itself]].
:The operating system might allow a process to modify its code. There are various reasons for this (e.g., [[blitting]] graphics quickly) but this would cause a problem with reentrancy, since the code might not be the same next time.
:It may, however, modify itself if it resides in its own unique memory. That is, if each new invocation uses a different physical machine code location where a copy of the original code is made, it will not affect other invocations even if it modifies itself during execution of that particular invocation (thread).
;Reentrant code may not call non-reentrant [[computer program]]s or [[Subroutine|routines]].
:Multiple levels of user, object, or process [[Priority queue|priority]] or [[multiprocessing]] usually complicate the control of reentrant code. It is important to keep track of any access or side effects that are done inside a routine designed to be reentrant.

==Reentrant interrupt handler==
A reentrant interrupt handler is an [[interrupt handler]] that re-enables interrupts early in the interrupt handler. This may reduce [[interrupt latency]].{{sfn|Sloss|Symes|Wright|Rayfield|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vdk4ZGRqMskC&amp;pg=PA342 342]}} In general, while programming interrupt service routines, it is recommended to re-enable interrupts as soon as possible in the interrupt handler. This practice helps to avoid losing interrupts.{{r|Regehr (2006)}}

==Further examples==
In the following code, neither &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; nor &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; functions are reentrant.

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
int v = 1;

int f()
{
    v += 2;
    return v;
}

int g()
{
    return f() + 2;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

In the above, {{code|f()}} depends on a non-constant global variable {{code|v}}; thus, if two threads execute it and access {{code|v}} concurrently, a [[race condition]] results. The value of {{code|v}} and, therefore, the return value of {{code|f}}, cannot be predicted with confidence: they will vary depending on the timing of the execution.{{clarify|date=May 2012|reason=This appears to be confusing reentrancy and thread-safety.}} Hence, {{code|f}} is not reentrant. Neither is {{code|g}}, because it calls {{code|f}}, which is not reentrant.

These slightly altered versions ''are'' reentrant:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
int f(int i)
{
    return i + 2;
}

int g(int i)
{
    return f(i) + 2;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

In the following, the function is thread-safe, but not reentrant:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
int function()
{
    mutex_lock();

    // ...
    // function body
    // ...

    mutex_unlock();
}
&lt;/source&gt;

In the above, {{code|function()}} can be called by different threads without any problem. But, if the function is used in a reentrant interrupt handler and a second interrupt arises inside the function, the second routine will hang forever. As interrupt servicing can disable other interrupts, the whole system could suffer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5308">'''Secondary orality''' is a concept in the work of scholar [[Walter J. Ong]], as first described in his book ''Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing of the Word'', published in 1982 (2nd ed. 2002), [[Walter J. Ong]] and discussing the differences between oral and literate cultures. 

In this book, Ong used the phrase ‘secondary orality’, describing it as “essentially a more deliberate and self-conscious orality, based permanently on the use of writing and print” (Ong, 1982, p.&amp;nbsp;133).&lt;ref&gt;Ong, W. J. (1982). ''Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing the Word''. New York: Methuen.&lt;/ref&gt; According to his way of thinking, secondary orality is not primary orality, the [[orality]] of pre-literate cultures. Oral societies operated on [[polychronic time]], with many things happening at once—socialization played a great role in the operation of these cultures, memory and memorization were of greater importance, increasing the amount of copiousness and redundancy. Oral cultures were additive rather than subordinate, closer to the human life world, and more situational and participatory than the more abstract qualities of literate cultures. 

Secondary orality is orality that is dependent on literate culture and the existence of writing, such as a television anchor reading the news or radio. While it exists in sound, it does not have the features of primary orality because it presumes and rests upon literate thought and expression, and may even be people reading written material. Thus, secondary orality is usually not as repetitive, redundant, agonistic, etc. the way primary orality is, and cultures that have a lot of secondary orality are not necessarily similar to primarily oral cultures. Secondary orality should not be confused with "oral residue" in which a culture has not fully transitioned to literate / written culture and retains many of the characteristics of primary oral cultures. Secondary orality is a phenomenon of post-literacy era, whereas oral residue is a stage in the transition from pre-literate to literate.

==The Gutenberg Parenthesis==
Ong notes that human communication has been dominated by oral culture, and the first signs of literacy date only 6 000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Ong, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Pettitt, Associate Professor of English at the University of Southern Denmark, agrees with Ong, ''et al.'', by considering literate learning more the anomaly than the rule.  He considers this to be a post-Gutenberg era where knowledge is formed through digital media, delivered over the internet.  Calling the previous 500 years a "Gutenberg Parenthesis", he explains that before Gutenberg, knowledge was formed orally and, now, in this post-Gutenberg era, knowledge is formed—increasingly—through "secondary orality" on the Internet. &lt;ref&gt;Pettitt, Tom ''Before the Gutenberg Parenthesis: Elizabethan-American Compatibilties'' https://www.academia.edu/2946207/Before_the_Gutenberg_Parenthesis_Elizabethan-American_Compatibilities&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by Professor Lars Ole Sauerberg. &lt;ref&gt;Pettitt, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; 

==McLuhan's Global Village==
In [[The Gutenberg Galaxy]], [[Marshall McLuhan]] discussed his notion of the "[[Global Village (term)|global village]]", a concept that can be related to Ong's account of secondary orality.  Liliana Bounegru notes the emergence of social media (e.g. [[Facebook]]) and microblogging (i.e.[[Twitter]]) are re-[[Tribalism|tribalizing]] our cultures.  Conversations in these social spaces are written, but are more conversational in tone than written communications; they are "rapid communication with large groups of people in a speed that would resemble oral storytelling, without having to share the same physical space with your audience." &lt;ref&gt;Bounegru, Liliana 'Secondary Orality in Microblogging' at Masters of Media. [http://mastersofmedia.hum.uva.nl/2008/10/13/secondary-orality-in-microblogging/]  Bounegru is Project Coordinator at the European Journalism Centre, Maastricht, NL and a MA candidate in Media Studies, University of Amsterdam.

This is achieved by each processor having multiple "threads" (or "work-items" or "Sequence of SIMD Lane operations"), which execute in lock-step, and are analogous to [[SIMD lanes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Michael McCool |author2=James Reinders |author3=Arch Robison |title=Structured Parallel Programming: Patterns for Efficient Computation |publisher=Elsevier |year=2013 |page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SIMT execution model has been implemented on several [[GPU]]s and is relevant for [[general-purpose computing on graphics processing units]] (GPGPU), e.g. some [[supercomputer]]s combine CPUs with GPUs.

SIMT was introduced by [[Nvidia]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nvidia.com/content/PDF/fermi_white_papers/NVIDIA_Fermi_Compute_Architecture_Whitepaper.pdf |title=Nvidia Fermi Compute Architecture Whitepaper |date=2009 |website=http://www.nvidia.com/ |publisher=NVIDIA Corporation |accessdate=2014-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=teslaPaper&gt;{{cite journal |title=NVIDIA Tesla: A Unified Graphics and Computing Architecture |date=2008 |page=6 {{subscription required|s}} |doi=10.1109/MM.2008.31 |volume=28 |issue=2 |journal=IEEE Micro|last1=Lindholm |first1=Erik |last2=Nickolls |first2=John |last3=Oberman |first3=Stuart |last4=Montrym |first4=John }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote| Nvidia's [[Tesla (microarchitecture)|Tesla GPU microarchitecture]] (first available November 8, 2006 as implemented in the ''"G80"'' GPU chip) introduced the single-instruction multiple-thread (SIMT) execution model where multiple independent threads execute concurrently using a single instruction.}}

[[ATI Technologies]] (now [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]]) released a competing product slightly later on May 14, 2007, the [[TeraScale (microarchitecture)#TeraScale 1|TeraScale 1]]-based ''"R600"'' GPU chip.

As access time of all the widespread [[random-access memory|RAM]] types (e.g. [[DDR SDRAM]], [[GDDR SDRAM]], [[XDR DRAM]], etc.) is still relatively high, engineers came up with the idea to hide the latency that inevitably comes with each memory access. Strictly, the latency-hiding is a feature of the zero-overhead scheduling implemented by modern GPUs. This might or might not be considered to be a property of 'SIMT' itself.

SIMT is intended to limit [[instruction fetching]] overhead,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first1=Sean |last1=Rul |first2=Hans |last2=Vandierendonck |first3=Joris |last3=D’Haene |first4=Koen |last4=De Bosschere |title=An experimental study on performance portability of OpenCL kernels |year=2010 |conference=Symp. Application Accelerators in High Performance Computing (SAAHPC)}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. the latency that comes with memory access, and is used in modern GPUs (such as those of [[Nvidia]] and [[AMD]]) in combination with 'latency hiding' to enable high-performance execution despite considerable latency in memory-access operations. This is where the processor is oversubscribed with computation tasks, and is able to quickly switch between tasks when it would otherwise have to wait on memory. This strategy is comparable to [[Multithreading (computer architecture)|multithreading in CPUs]] (not to be confused with [[Multi-core processor|multi-core]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~vetter/keeneland/tutorial-2011-04-14/12-advanced_topics_in_cuda.pdf |title=Advanced Topics in CUDA |date=2011 |website=cc.gatech.edu |accessdate=2014-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A downside of SIMT execution is the fact that thread-specific control-flow is performed using "masking", leading to poor utilization where a processor's threads follow different control-flow paths. For instance, to handle an ''IF''-''ELSE'' block where various threads of a processor execute different paths, all threads must actually process both paths (as all threads of a processor always execute in lock-step), but masking is used to disable and enable the various threads as appropriate. Masking is avoided when control flow is coherent for the threads of a processor, i.e. they all follow the same path of execution. The masking strategy is what distinguishes SIMT from ordinary SIMD, and has the benefit of inexpensive synchronization between the threads of a processor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Michael McCool |author2=James Reinders |author3=Arch Robison |title=Structured Parallel Programming: Patterns for Efficient Computation |publisher=Elsevier |year=2013 |pages=209 ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spalting''' is any form of [[wood]] coloration caused by [[fungi]]. Although primarily found in dead [[tree]]s, spalting can also occur in living trees under [[stress (biology)|stress]]. Although spalting can cause weight loss and strength loss in the wood, the unique coloration and patterns of spalted wood are sought by [[woodworkers]].&lt;ref name="Robinson07"/&gt;

==Types==
Spalting is divided into three main types: [[pigmentation]], white rot and zone lines.  Spalted wood may exhibit one or all of these types in varying degrees. Both hardwoods ([[deciduous]]) and softwoods ([[coniferous]]) can spalt, but zone lines and white rot are more commonly found on hardwoods due to enzymatic differences in white rotting fungi. Brown rots are more common to conifers, although one brown rot, ''[[Fistulina hepatica]]'' (beefsteak fungus), is known to cause spalting.&lt;ref name="FW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finewoodworking.com/Materials/MaterialsArticle.aspx?id=32485|title=Spalted wood: Find out how wood and fungi interact to create beautiful boards|last=Robinson|first=Sara|work=[[Fine Woodworking]]|publisher=[[Taunton Press]]|accessdate=2009-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pigmentation===

Pigmentation is caused when fungi produce extracellular pigments ''inside'' wood. Bluestain is also a form of pigmentation, however generally bluestain pigments are bound within the [[hypha]]e cell walls.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of the Institute of Wood Science'' 14, 18-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RaynerBoddy98"&gt;Rayner, A.D.M., and Boddy, L. (1988). Fungal Decomposition of Wood. Its biology and Ecology. John Wiley and Sons: New York.&lt;/ref&gt;  A visible color change can be seen if enough hyphae are concentrated in an area.&lt;ref name="Zabel92"&gt;Zabel, R.A., and Morrell, J.J.  (1992). ''Wood Microbiology. Decay and Its Prevention''. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, Academic Press, INC: New York&lt;/ref&gt;  Pigmenting fungi classified as spalting fungi do decay wood, they simply do so at a slower rate (soft rotting) than white rotting fungi.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, D.L., and Glaeser, J.A. 2015. Wood decay by ''Chlorociboria aeruginascens'' (Nyl.) Kanas (Helotiales, Leotiaceae) and associated basidiomycete fungi. ''International Biodeterioration &amp; Biodegradation'' 105:239-244.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anagnost, S.E., Worrall, J.J., and Wang, C.J.K. 1994. Diffuse cavity formation in soft rot of pine. ''Wood Science and Technology'' 28(3):199-208&lt;/ref&gt;  The most common groups of pigmentation fungi are the [[deuteromycota|imperfect fungi]] and the [[Ascomycota|ascomycetes]].&lt;ref name="RaynerTodd82"&gt;Rayner, A.D.M., and Todd, N.K.  (1982). ''Population Structure in Wood-Decomposing Basidiomycetes''. Cambridge University Press:  New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Mold fungi, such as ''[[Trichoderma]]'' spp., are not considered to be spalting fungi, as their hyphae do not colonize the wood internally and they do not produce the enzymes necessary to digest the wood cell wall components.

===White rot===

The mottled white pockets and bleaching effect seen in spalted wood is due to white rot fungi.  Primarily found on hardwoods, these fungi "bleach" by consuming [[lignin]], which is the slightly pigmented area of a wood cell wall.&lt;ref&gt;Liese, W. (1970). Ultrastructural aspects of woody-tissue disintegration. ''Annual Review of Phytopathology'' 8, 231-257.&lt;/ref&gt; Some white rotting can also be caused by an effect similar to pigmentation, in which the white hyphae of a fungus, such as ''[[Trametes versicolor]]'' (Fr.) Pil., is so concentrated in an area that a visual effect is created.&lt;ref&gt;Blanchette, R.A. (1984). Screening wood decayed by white rot fungi for preferential lignin degradation.  ''Applied and Environmental Microbiology'' 48 (3), 647-653.
&lt;/ref&gt;  

Both [[compressive strength|strength]] and weight loss occur with white rot decay, causing the "punky" area often referred to by woodworkers.  Brown rots, the "unpleasing" type of spalting, do not degrade lignin, thus creating a crumbly, cracked surface which cannot be stabilized.&lt;ref name="Zabel92"/&gt;  Both types of rot, if uncontrolled, will render wood useless.

===Zone lines===

Dark dotting, winding lines and thin streaks of red, brown and black are known as [[intraspecific antagonism|zone lines]].  This type of spalting does not occur due to any specific type of fungus, but is instead an interaction zone in which different fungi have erected barriers to protect their resources.&lt;ref name="RaynerTodd82"/&gt;  They can also be caused by a single fungus delineating itself.  The lines are often clumps of hard, dark [[mycelium]], referred to as [[pseudosclerotium|pseudosclerotial]] plate formation.&lt;ref&gt;Cease, K.R., Blanchette, R.A., and Highley, T.L.  (1989). Interactions between
''Scytalidium'' species and brown- or white-rot Basidiomycetes in birch wood. ''Wood Science and Technology''  23, 151-161&lt;/ref&gt; 

Zone lines themselves do not damage the wood. However, the fungi responsible for creating them often do.

==Conditions==
Conditions required for spalting are the same as the conditions required for fungal growth: fixed nitrogen, [[micronutrient]]s, water, warm temperatures and oxygen.&lt;ref name="Zabel92"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manion, P.D. (1991). ''Tree Disease Concepts''. 2nd ed. Prentice-Hall: New Jersey&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Water:'''
Wood must be saturated to a 20% [[water content|moisture content]] or higher for fungal colonization to occur.  Wood placed underwater lacks sufficient oxygen, and colonization cannot occur.&lt;ref name="EatonHale93"&gt;Eaton, R.A., and Hale, M.D.C.  (1993). ''Wood: Decay, Pests, and Protection''. Chapman &amp; Hall: New York.&lt;/ref&gt;  

'''Temperature:'''
The majority of fungi prefer warm temperatures between 10 and 40&amp;nbsp;°C,&lt;ref name="EatonHale93"/&gt; with rapid growth occurring between 20 and 32&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, C.J., and Siggers, P.V. (1933). Temperature relations of wood-destroying fungi. ''Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics'' 47, 997-1008.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oxygen:'''
Fungi do not require much oxygen, but conditions such as waterlogging will inhibit growth.&lt;ref&gt;Fogarty, W.M., &amp; Ward, O.P. (1973). Growth and enzyme production by ''Bacillus subtilius''  and ''Flavobacterium pectinovorum'' in ''Picea sitchensis''. ''Wood Science and Technology'' 7, 261-270.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kamp, B.J., Gokhale, A.A., and Smith, R.S. (1979). Decay resistance owing to near-anaerobic conditions in black cottonwood wetwood. ''Canadian Journal of Forest Research'' 9(1), 39-44.&lt;/ref&gt;  

'''Time:'''
Different fungi require different amounts of time to colonize wood.  Research conducted on some common spalting fungi found that ''Trametes versicolor'', when paired with ''[[Bjerkandera adusta]]'', took eight weeks to spalt 1.5 inch (38&amp;nbsp;mm) cubes of ''[[Acer saccharum]]''.&lt;ref name="Robinson07"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=S.C. |author2=Richter, D.L. |author3=Laks, P.E. |date=2007-04-01|title=Colonization of sugar maple by spalting fungi|journal=Forest Products Journal|issue=April 2007|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-6523356/Colonization-of-sugar-maple-by.html|accessdate=2008-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Colonization continued to progress after this time period, but the structural integrity of the wood was compromised.  The same study also found that ''Polyporus brumalis'', when paired with ''Trametes versicolor'', required 10 weeks to spalt the same size cubes.

==Commonly spalted woods==

The Ohio Department of Natural Resources found that pale hardwoods had the best ability to spalt.&lt;ref&gt;
Ohio Department of Natural Resources. (2005). Spalted Wood.  Division home page: Forest Industries.&lt;/ref&gt; Some common trees in this category include [[maple]] (''Acer'' spp.), [[birch]] (''Betula'' spp.) and [[beech]] (''Fagus'' spp.).  However, recent research suggests that [[sugar maple]] (''Acer saccharum'') and [[aspen]] (''Populus'' sp.) are preferred by both white rot and pigment fungi.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, S.C., Laks, P.E. (2010a). Wood species affects colonization rates of ''Chlorociboria'' sp. ''International Biodeterioration &amp; Biodegradation'' 64:305-308.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, S.C., Laks, P.E. (2010b). Culture age and wood species affect zone line production of ''Xylaria polymorpha''. ''The Open Mycology Journal'' in press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common spalting fungi==

One of the trickier aspects to spalting is that some fungi cannot colonize wood alone; they require other fungi to have preceded them to create favorable conditions. Fungi progress in waves of primary and secondary colonizers,&lt;ref name="RaynerBoddy98"/&gt; where primary colonizers initially capture and control resources, change the [[pH]] of the wood and its structure, and then must defend against secondary colonizers that then have the ability to colonize the substrate.&lt;ref name="RaynerBoddy98"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmer, L., Renvall, P., &amp; Stenlid, J.  (1997). Selective replacement between species of wood-rotting Basidiomycetes, a laboratory study.  ''Mycological Research''  6, 714-720.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Ceratocystis]]'' spp. (Ascomycetes) contains the most common blue stain fungi.&lt;ref&gt;Croan, S.C.  (2000). Evaluation of white-rot fungal growth on Southern Yellow Pine wood chips pretreated with blue-stain fungi.  The International Research Group on Wood Preservation: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service.  31st Meeting.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Trametes versicolor]]'', (Basidiomycetes) is found all over the world and is a quick and efficient white rot of hardwoods.&lt;ref name="RaynerBoddy98"/&gt; ''[[Xylaria polymorpha]]'' (Pers. ex Mer.) Grev. (Ascomycetes) has been known to bleach wood, but is unique in that it is one of the few fungi that will erect zone lines without any antagonism from other fungi.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, A.H.  (1933). Zone lines in plant tissues. I. The black lines formed by ''Xylaria polymorpha'' (Pers.) Grev. in hardwoods.  ''Annals of Applied Biology'' 21, 1-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

Initial lab work was conducted on spalting in the 1980s at [[Brigham Young University]].  A method for improving machinability in spalted wood using [[methyl methacrylate]] was developed in 1982,&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, K.W. (1982). Improving the Working Properties of Spalted Woods Through Impregnation with Methyl Methacrylate.  Thesis: Brigham Young University.&lt;/ref&gt; and several white rot fungi responsible for zone line formation were identified in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, L.W. (1987). The Nature of Spalted Wood: Analysis of Zone Line Formation Between Six White Rot Fungi. Thesis: Brigham Young University.&lt;/ref&gt;  Current research at [[Michigan Technological University]] has identified specific time periods at which certain spalting fungi will interact, and how long it takes for said fungi to render the wood useless.&lt;ref name="Robinson07"/&gt;  Researchers from this university also developed a test for evaluating the machinability of spalted wood using a universal test machine.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, S.C., Laks, P.E., Richter, D.L. and Pickens, J. B. (2007). Evaluating loss of machinability in spalted sugar maple. ''Forest Products Journal'' 57(4), 33-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5764">'''Spiritual self-schema therapy''', sometimes referred to as '''3-S Therapy''', was developed at Yale University School of Medicine by S. Kelly Avants, Ph.D., and Arthur Margolin, Ph.D. It is a therapy for addicted individuals who have contracted [[HIV]] or are at risk for contracting [[HIV]], whose goals are to reduce illicit drug use as well as drug- and sex-related risk behaviors.  In general, it aims to promote living a spiritual life aiding in their recovery .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Spiritual Self-Schema (3-S) development program for the treatment of addiction and HIV risk behavior|url=http://medicine.yale.edu/spiritualselfschema/training/manuals/therapy.aspx|publisher=Yale School of Medicine|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spiritual self-schema therapy has a non-theistic foundation based on Buddhist practices, which are very similar to contemporary cognitive-behavioral techniques, and incorporates the client's spiritual beliefs, which do not need to be specifically or conventionally religious. &lt;ref name="3-S Theoretical Foundation"&gt;{{cite web|title=3-S Theoretical Foundation|url=http://www.3-s.us/about/foundation/index.aspx|publisher=Yale School of Medicine|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  3-S therapy does not "convert" clients to Buddhism or any other spiritual or religious belief system, but always works within the client's pre-existing set of beliefs. 

==Self-schema==
The term [[self-schema]] describes a mental process to aim in understanding and organizing incoming information (stimuli). An example would include looking in your rearview mirror while driving and seeing flashing lights - typically an individual has an automatic response and prepares to pull over with out having to think. This illustrates a well-organized schema on "flashing lights". The connection between self-schema and spiritual self-schema therapy is shown in the automatic beliefs about oneself. An individual doesn't have to stop and think "Who am I? How would somebody like that respond to this situation?" If an individual is shy and believes they are ugly, they may see somebody looking in their direction and assume the person is staring at how ugly they are, when in reality they could be finding the person quite attractive or even not looking at them at all.

==3-S at Yale==
[[Yale School of Medicine]] has started a program called 3-S Thearpy, signifying '''S'''piritual '''S'''elf-'''S'''chema. Self-schemas can be helpful, but they can also be problematic. Stereotypes are an example. Additionally, people who believe that they are "bad, worthless, or unlovable" do significant amounts of mental damage to themselves. Yale School of Medicine's 3-S program promotes [[spirituality]] as a strong resource for coping with life's troubles. The goal of its program is to create a path to enhance one's spiritual nature.&lt;ref name="3-S Theoretical Foundation" /&gt;  The therapy manuals for 3-S Therapy, in English, as well as translated into Spanish and Russian, are available at the Yale University website: https://medicine.yale.edu/spiritualselfschema/training/manuals/therapy.aspx

==HIV==
There is a growing trend in attempting to integrate spiritual and religious beliefs into [[HIV]] prevention and addiction treatment. Spiritual self-schema therapy is one such attempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Avants|first1=S.

The '''spring bloom''' is a strong increase in [[phytoplankton]] abundance (i.e. stock) that typically occurs in the early spring and lasts until late spring or early summer. This seasonal event is characteristic of temperate North Atlantic, sub-polar, and coastal waters.&lt;ref name="Mann"&gt;Mann, K.H., Lazier, J.R.N. (2006).

"Biological Oceanography" Oxford: Blackwell Publishing Ltd. {{ISBN|978-0-632-05536-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Phytoplankton blooms occur when growth exceeds losses, however there is no universally accepted definition of the magnitude of change or the threshold of abundance that constitutes a bloom. The magnitude, spatial extent and duration of a bloom depends on a variety of abiotic and biotic factors. Abiotic factors include light availability, nutrients, temperature, and physical processes that influence light availability,&lt;ref name="Mann" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Winder" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oviatt"&gt;Oviatt, C., Keller, A., and Reed, L.

==Classical mechanism==

In the spring, more light becomes available and stratification of the water column occurs as increasing temperatures warm the surface waters (referred to as thermal stratification). As a result, vertical mixing is inhibited and phytoplankton and nutrients are entrained in the euphotic zone.&lt;ref name="Mann" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt; This creates a comparitvely high nutrient and high light environment that allows rapid phytoplankton growth.&lt;ref name="Mann" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

Along with thermal stratification, spring blooms can be triggered by salinity stratification due to freshwater input, from sources such as high river runoff. This type of stratification is normally limited to coastal areas and estuaries, including Chesapeake Bay.&lt;ref name="Harding"&gt;Harding, L. W. and Perry, E. S. (1997). "Long-term increase of phytoplankton biomass in Chesapeake Bay, 1950–94." Marine Ecological Progress Series 157: 39–52. {{doi|10.3354/meps157039}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freshwater influences primary productivity in two ways. First, because freshwater is less dense, it rests on top of seawater and creates a stratified water column.&lt;ref name="Mann" /&gt; Second, freshwater often carries nutrients &lt;ref name="Winder" /&gt; that phytoplankton need to carry out processes, including photosynthesis.

Rapid increases in phytoplankton growth, that typically occur during the spring bloom, arise because phytoplankton can reproduce rapidly under optimal growth conditions (i.e., high nutrient levels, ideal light and temperature, and minimal losses from grazing and vertical mixing). In terms of reproduction, many species of phytoplankton can double at least once per day, allowing for exponential increases in phytoplankton stock size. For example, the stock size of a population that doubles once per day will increase 1000-fold in just 10 days.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt; In addition, there is a lag in the grazing response of herbivorous [[zooplankton]] at the start of blooms, which minimize phytoplankton losses. This lag occurs because there is low winter zooplankton abundance and many zooplankton, such as copepods, have longer generation times than phytoplankton.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;

Spring blooms typically last until late spring or early summer, at which time the bloom collapses due to nutrient depletion in the stratified water column and increased grazing pressure by zooplankton.&lt;ref name="Mann" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Winder" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smayda" /&gt; The most limiting nutrient in the marine environment is typically [[nitrogen]] (N). This is because most organisms are unable to fix atmospheric nitrogen into usable forms (i.e. ammonium, nitrite, or nitrate). However, with the exception of coastal waters, it can be argued, that [[iron]] (Fe) is the most limiting nutrient because it is required to fix nitrogen, but is only available in small quantities in the marine environment, coming from dust storms and leaching from rocks.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt; [[Phosphorus]] can also be limiting, particularly in freshwater environments and tropical coastal regions.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;

During winter, wind-driven turbulence and cooling water temperatures break down the stratified [[water column]] formed during the summer. This breakdown allows vertical mixing of the water column and replenishes nutrients from deep water to the surface waters and the rest of the [[euphotic zone]]. However, vertical mixing also causes high losses, as phytoplankton are carried below the euphotic zone (so their [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] exceeds primary production). In addition, reduced illumination (intensity and daily duration) during winter limits growth rates.

==Alternative mechanisms==

Historically, blooms have been explained by Sverdrup's [[critical depth]] hypothesis, which says blooms are caused by shoaling of the mixed layer. Similarly, Winder and Cloern (2010) described spring blooms as a response to increasing temperature and light availability.&lt;ref name="Winder"&gt;Winder, M. and Cloern, J.E. (2010). "The annual cycles of phytoplankton biomass". Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B 365: 3215–3226. {{doi|10.1098/rstb.2010.0125}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, new explanations have been offered recently, including that blooms occur due to:
*Coupling between phytoplankton growth and zooplankton grazing.&lt;ref name="Behrenfeld"&gt;Behrenfeld, M.J. (2010). "Abandoning Sverdrup's Critical Depth Hypothesis on phytoplankton blooms". Ecology 91:977–989. {{doi|10.1890/09-1207.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The onset of near surface stratification in the spring.&lt;ref name="Chiswell"&gt;Chiswell, S. M., 2011, The spring phytoplankton bloom: don’t abandon Sverdrup completely: Marine Ecology Progress Series, v. 443, p. 39-50 - {{doi|10.3354/meps09453}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Mixing of the water column, rather than stratification &lt;ref name="Townsend"&gt;Townsend, D.W., Cammen, L.M., Holligan, P.M., Campbell, D.E., Pettigrew, N.R. (1994). "Causes and consequences of variability in the timing of spring phytoplankton blooms". Deep-Sea Research 41: 747-765&lt;/ref&gt;
*Low turbulence &lt;ref name="Huisman"&gt;Huisman, J., van Oostveen, P., Weissing, F.J. (1999). "Critical depth and critical turbulence: two different mechanisms for the development of phytoplankton blooms." Limnological Oceanography 44: 1781-1787&lt;/ref&gt;
*Increasing light intensity (in shallow water environments).&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;

==Northward progression==

At greater [[latitudes]], spring blooms take place later in the year. This northward progression is because spring occurs later, delaying thermal stratification and increases in illumination that promote blooms. A study by Wolf and Woods (1988) showed evidence that spring blooms follow the northward migration of the 12&amp;nbsp;°C isotherm, suggesting that blooms may be controlled by temperature limitations, in addition to stratification.&lt;ref name="Mann" /&gt;

At high latitudes, the shorter warm season commonly results in one mid-summer bloom. These blooms tend to be more intense than spring blooms of temperate areas because there is a longer duration of daylight for photosynthesis to take place. Also, grazing pressure tends to be lower because the generally cooler temperatures at higher latitudes slow zooplankton metabolism.&lt;ref name="Mann" /&gt;

==Species succession==

The spring bloom often consists of a series of sequential blooms of different phytoplankton species. Succession occurs because different species have optimal nutrient uptake at different ambient concentrations and reach their growth peaks at different times. Shifts in the dominant phytoplankton species are likely caused by biological and physical (i.e. environmental) factors.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt; For instance, [[diatom]] growth rate becomes limited when the supply of [[silicate]] is depleted.&lt;ref name="Mann" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kristiansen"&gt;Kristiansen, S., Farbrot, T., and Naustvoll, L. (2001). "Spring bloom nutrient dynamics in the Oslofjord". Marine Ecology Progress Series 219: 41–49&lt;/ref&gt; Since silicate is not required by other phytoplankton, such as [[dinoflagellates]], their growth rates continue to increase.

For example, in oceanic environments, diatoms (cells diameter greater than 10 to 70&amp;nbsp;µm or larger) typically dominate first because they are capable of growing faster. Once silicate is depleted in the environment, diatoms are succeeded by smaller dinoflagellates.&lt;ref name="Mann" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kristiansen" /&gt; This scenario has been observed in Rhode Island,&lt;ref name="Smayda1957"&gt;Smayda, T.J.(1957). "Phytoplankton studies in lower Narragansett Bay". Limnology and Oceanography 2(4) 342-359&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nixon"&gt;Nixon, S.W., Fulweiler, R.W., Buckley, B.A., Granger, S.L., Nowicki, B.L., Henry, K.M. (2009). "The impact of changing climate on phenology, productivity, and benthic-pelagic coupling in Narragansett Bay". Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science 82: 1-18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pratt"&gt;Pratt, D.M.(1959). "The phytoplankton of Narragansett Bay". Limnology and Oceanography 4(4) 425-440&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Massachusetts and Cape Cod Bay.&lt;ref name="Hunt"&gt;Hunt, C.D., Borkman, D.G., Libby, P.S., Lacouture, R., Turner, J.T., and Mickelson, M.J. (2010). "Phytoplankton Patterns in Massachusetts Bay—1992–2007". Estuaries and Coasts 33: 448–470. {{doi|10.1007/s12237-008-9125-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of a spring bloom, when most nutrients have been depleted, the majority of the total phytoplankton [[biomass]] is very small phytoplankton, known as ultraphytoplankton (cell diameter &lt;5 to 10&amp;nbsp;µm).&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt; Ultraphytoplankton can sustain low, but constant stocks, in nutrient depleted environments because they have a larger [[surface area to volume ratio]], which offers a much more effective rate of [[diffusion]].&lt;ref name="Mann" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt; The types of phytoplankton comprising a bloom can be determined by examination of the varying photosynthetic pigments found in [[chloroplasts]] of each species.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;

==Variability and the influence of climate change==

Variability in the patterns (e.g. timing of onset, duration, magnitude, position, and spatial extent) of annual spring bloom events has been well documented.&lt;ref name="Winder" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smayda" /&gt; These variations occur due to fluctuations in environmental conditions, such as wind intensity, temperature, freshwater input, and light. Consequently, spring bloom patterns are likely sensitive to [[global climate change]].

Links have been found between temperature and spring bloom patterns. For example, several studies have reported a correlation between earlier spring bloom onset and temperature increases over time.&lt;ref name="Winder" /&gt; Furthermore, in Long Island Sound and the Gulf of Maine, blooms begin later in the year, are more productive, and last longer during colder years, while years that are warmer exhibit earlier, shorter blooms of greater magnitude.&lt;ref name="Smayda" /&gt;

Temperature may also regulate bloom sizes. In Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, a study by Durbin et al. (1992)&lt;ref name="Durbin"&gt;Durbin, A.G. and Durbin, E.G. (1992). "Seasonal changes in size frequency distribution and estimated age in the marine copepod Acartia hudsortica during a winter-spring diatom bloom in Narragansett Bay". Limnol. Oceanogr., 37(2): 379-392&lt;/ref&gt; indicated that a 2&amp;nbsp;°C increase in water temperature resulted in a three-week shift in the maturation of the copepod, ''Acartia hudsonica'', which could significantly increase zooplankton grazing intensity. Oviatt et al. (2002) &lt;ref name="Oviatt" /&gt; noted a reduction in spring bloom intensity and duration in years when winter water temperatures were warmer. Oviatt et al. suggested that the reduction was due to increased grazing pressure, which could potentially become intense enough to prevent spring blooms from occurring altogether.

Miller and Harding (2007) &lt;ref name="MillerWD"&gt;Miller, W.D. and Harding Jr., L.W. (2007). "Climate forcing of the spring bloom in Chesapeake Bay". Marine Ecology Progress Series 331: 11–22&lt;/ref&gt; suggested climate change (influencing winter weather patterns and freshwater influxes) was responsible for shifts in spring bloom patterns in the Chesapeake Bay. They found that during warm, wet years (as opposed to cool, dry years), the spatial extent of blooms was larger and was positioned more seaward. Also, during these same years, biomass was higher and peak biomass occurred later in the spring.

'''Security and strategic studies''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] [[List of academic disciplines|academic field]] centered on the study of [[Conflict (process)|conflict]] and [[peace]] [[Strategy|strategies]], often devoting special attention to the relationship between [[international politics]], [[geostrategy]], [[international diplomacy]], [[international economics]], and [[armed forces|military power]]. In the scope of the studies are also subjects such as the role of [[intelligence]], [[diplomacy]], and international cooperation for security and defense. The subject is normally taught at the [[post-graduate]] academic or professional, usually strategic-political and strategic-military levels.

The academic foundations of the subject began with classic texts initially from the Orient such as [[Sun Tzu]]’s ''[[Art of War]]'' and went on to gain a European focus with [[Carl von Clausewitz]]’s ''[[On War]]''. Like Clausewitz, many academics in this field reject monocausal theories and hypotheses that reduce the study of conflict to one independent variable and one dependent variable.  Already in the late eighteenth century, a colourful mathematician named [[Dietrich Heinrich von Bülow]] attempted to establish mathematical formulae for the conduct of war.  Carl von Clausewitz rejected Bülow’s approach and his popular claim that warfare could be reduced to positivist, teachable principles of war.  Instead of formulae, we find Clausewitz stressing, time and again, that the whole purpose of educating the military commander is not to give him a series of answers for the task he will face (the complexities of which cannot be foreseen), but to educate him about different aspects of what will face him so as to let him evaluate the situation for himself, and develop his own strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Otte: “Educating Bellona: Carl von Clausewitz and Military Education”, in G.C. Kennedy &amp; K. Neilson (eds): ''Military Education: Past, Present and Future'' (New York: Praeger, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;  Strategic thinkers on the whole will search for recurrent patterns, which in themselves cannot predict the characteristics of any individual case even if it doubtless fits a larger category; not all patterns of characteristics will be found in all cases.

In recent times, the major conflicts of the nineteenth century and the two [[World Wars]] have spurred strategic thinkers such as [[Alfred Thayer Mahan|Mahan]], [[Julian Corbett|Corbett]], [[Giulio Douhet]], [[Liddell Hart]] and, later, [[Andre Beaufre|André Beaufre]]. The Cold War with its danger of degenerating into a nuclear war produced an expansion of the discipline, with authors like [[Bernard Brodie (military strategist)|Bernard Brodie]], [[Michael Howard (historian)|Michael Howard]], [[Raymond Aron]], [[Lucien Poirier]], [[Lawrence Freedman]], [[Colin S. Gray|Colin Gray]], and many others.

== Surface engineering ==

[[Surface engineering]] is the sub-discipline of [[materials science]] which deals with the surface of solid matter.  It has applications to [[chemistry]], [[mechanical engineering]], and [[electrical engineering]] (particularly in relation to [[semiconductor manufacturing]]).

[[Solids]] are composed of a bulk material covered by a surface. The surface which bounds the bulk material is called the [[Surface phase]]. It acts as an interface to the surrounding environment. The bulk material in a solid is called the [[Bulk phase]].

The surface phase of a solid interacts with the surrounding environment. This interaction can degrade the surface phase over time. Environmental degradation of the surface phase over time can be caused by [[wear]], [[corrosion]], [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] and [[Creep (deformation)|creep]].

Surface engineering involves altering the properties of the Surface Phase in order to reduce the degradation over time. This is accomplished by making the surface robust to the environment in which it will be used.

===Applications and Future of Surface Engineering===

Surface engineering techniques are being used in the automotive, aerospace, missile, power, electronic, biomedical,&lt;ref name="synthesis2010"/&gt; textile, petroleum, petrochemical, chemical, steel, power, cement, machine tools, construction industries. Surface engineering techniques can be used to develop a wide range of functional properties, including physical, chemical, electrical, electronic, magnetic, mechanical, wear-resistant and corrosion-resistant properties at the required substrate surfaces.  Almost all types of materials, including metals, ceramics, polymers, and composites can be coated on similar or dissimilar materials.  It  is also possible to form coatings of newer materials (e.g., met glass. beta-C3N4), graded deposits, multi-component deposits etc.

In 1995, surface engineering was a ₤10 billion market in the United Kingdom. Coatings, to make surface life robust from wear and corrosion, was approximately half the market.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

[[Functionalization of Antimicrobial Surfaces]] is a unique technology that can be used for sterilization in health industry, self-cleaning surfaces and protection from bio films.

In recent years, there has been a paradigm shift in surface engineering from age-old electroplating to processes such as vapor phase deposition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=He|first=Zhenping|author2=Ilona Kretzschmar |title=Template-Assisted GLAD: Approach to Single and Multipatch Patchy Particles with Controlled Patch Shape|journal=Langmuir|date=6 December 2013|volume=29|issue=51|pages=15755–15761|doi=10.1021/la404592z|pmid=24313824}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=He|first=Zhenping|author2=Kretzschmar, Ilona |title=Template-Assisted Fabrication of Patchy Particles with Uniform Patches|journal=Langmuir|date=3 June 2012|volume=28|issue=26|pages=9915–9919|doi=10.1021/la3017563|pmid=22708736}}&lt;/ref&gt; diffusion, thermal spray &amp; welding using advanced heat sources like plasma,&lt;ref name="vacuum2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="synthesis2010"/&gt; laser, ion, electron, microwave, solar beams, synchrotron radiation,&lt;ref name="synthesis2010"/&gt; pulsed arc, pulsed combustion, spark, friction and induction.

It's estimated that loss due to wear and corrosion in the US is approximately $500 billion. In the US, there are around 9524 establishments (including automotive, aircraft, power and construction industries) who depend on engineered surfaces with support from 23,466 industries.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

== Surface functionalization ==

{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}
'''Surface functionalization''' introduces chemical [[functional group]]s to a surface. This way, materials with functional groups on their surfaces can be designed from substrates with standard bulk material properties. Prominent examples can be found in semiconductor industry and biomaterial research.&lt;ref name="synthesis2010"/&gt;

'''The Reasons that Induced Dr. S. to Write a Poem Call'd the Lady's Dressing Room''' is a poem by [[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]] published in 1734. The poem is a [[satire]] and was written in response to a poem by [[Jonathan Swift]] entitled "[[The Lady's Dressing Room]]". The poem is part of a poetic duel between the two poets, in which Montagu attacks Swift's character and suggests that he wrote "The Lady's Dressing Room" as a result of his sexual frustration and impotence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lorenzo Modia|first=Maria Jesus|title=Teaching Eighteenth-century Poetic Satire with a Competency-based  Approach: Jonathan Swift and Lady Mary Wortley Montagu|journal=International Education Studies|date=December 2011|volume=4|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both poems have been seen as satires of gender roles and stereotypes of the time, although Swift's poem has received greater praise and recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weise|first=Wendys|title=Seeing and the Difference It Makes: Ocularity, Gender, and Space in Swift's and Montagu's "Dressing Room" Satires|journal=Taylor &amp; Francis Group, Women's Studies|year=2006|volume=35|issue=8|pages=707–738|doi=10.1080/00497870600945600}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
The poem is a narrative where "the Doctor", referring to [[Jonathan Swift]], is the protagonist. The tale relates his journey one day to meet with a prostitute named Betty that he has been attempting to woo. After paying for her services, however, he finds himself experiencing an episode of impotence. He proceeds to blame his sexual failure on Betty and she returns his blame, allocating it to his old age. The Doctor insists that his money be returned to him but Betty refuses to do so. He swears vengeance, saying, "I'll so describe your dressing room / The very Irish shall not come". Here Montagu references Swift's poem, "[[The Lady's Dressing Room]]", and also slights Swift's Irish nationality. Betty the prostitute replies with another reference to Swift's poem saying, "I'm glad you'll write. / You'll furnish paper when I shite."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=al.]|first=general editors, Joseph Black ... [et|title=The restoration and the eighteenth century.|year=2006|publisher=Broadview Press|location=Peterborough, Ontario [u.a.]|isbn=1-55111-611-1|edition=Repr. with corrections.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
The poem's biting satire obviously overtly attacks Dr. Swift and his writings. It also actively accuses Swift of Misogyny and sexism. Swift's poem was highly invasive as it chronicles the unwanted entry of a man into a lady's dressing room where he sees the woman no longer as an elevated goddess, but as a normal human being with normal bodily functions. In his poem he attacks womankind, abasing them as vile and disgusting creatures. More importantly, the scene he depicts "unveils" the myth of femininity. The 18th century required women to be flawless, gentle and pure in public and private. Swift mocks them in both spheres, deeply desecrating the female image. He also brings their integrity into question, suggesting that they, through attempting to be clean, are hiding their inherent filthiness. Not everyone found Swift's satire tasteful, but his writing was very influential. 

Montagu's poem, however, suggests that the hatred of women that inspired Swift to write his poem is actually just a result of his own sexual frustration and incapacity. In denouncing Swift's misogynistic views, Montagu also criticizes his pessimism in other subject areas. Swift was known as a satirist to be extremely cynical and critical of nearly everything. This poem stands to reason that all of Swift's pessimism is a result of internal issues and failures. Montagu mocks the double standard required for women; Swift invalidates females in both the public and private sphere and Montagu refutes this with cleverly pointed satire.

For both poems, the form is very significant. Their use of satire made their work possible. They could raise eyebrows without starting fires and question contradictory systems and values while eliciting pleased smiles. This form popularized their works.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2697">A '''tidal shock''' occurs when a [[star cluster]] or other distributed [[astronomical object]] passes by a large mass
such as an [[interstellar cloud]], resulting in [[gravitational perturbation]] on a time scale that is much less than the mean time for a star to complete an orbit within the cluster. The [[tidal force]] from this event can increase the dynamic energy of the cluster, in effect heating it up. This causes the cluster to expand and shed some of the outer stars.&lt;ref name=aj176_L51/&gt;

Tidal shocks occur, for example, when a [[globular cluster]] passes through the galactic plane or near the core of the [[Milky Way]]. These events are an important factor during the early evolution of a globular cluster. They work to truncate the outer part of clusters, thereby limiting the impact of future tidal shocks.&lt;ref name=lee2001/&gt; Streams of stars shed from a globular cluster as a result of tidal shock can form what are termed [[tidal tail]]s. These are extended streams of stars that lead away from the cluster.&lt;ref name=raa9_10_1131/&gt; Such streams can be used to trace the orbital path of the cluster.&lt;ref name=jkas35_2_75/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18377">The term transformation (also "transition" or "system change") in the field of [[mediated cross-border communication]]  refers to
a media system's change from for instance [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] or [[Communism|communist]] structures to a new media system with different [[structure]]s and control mechanisms.&lt;ref name="Hadamik"&gt;Hadamik (2004), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared  to the studies of media systems, transformation research is focused on the [[collective]] and [[individual]] actors who "demand, support, and manage change".&lt;ref&gt;Kleinsteuber (2010), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; They can be found in [[government]]s, [[Political party|parties]], [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]], civil society organizations or [[Advocacy group|interest groups]]. To the largest extent, transformation research addresses change from [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] to [[Democracy|democratic]] media systems. Since transformation processes in media systems are always linked to the political and [[socioeconomic development]], transformation research is not solely focused on the transformation of the media systems, but also on sectors like [[politics]], [[economy]], [[society]], or [[culture]].&lt;ref name="Hadamik" /&gt;

Transformation  research is a comparative approach, since processes in different stages of the [[Political system|political]] or media system are compared. The approach is highly complex, because it combines comparison with the dimension of space and time, for instance by analyzing similar change processes of media systems in different world regions and times in history. This causes problems, because the changing systems can exhibit considerable differences between one another. Although there are differences between them, transformation processes often occur at the same time and significant similarities between the resulting patterns can be observed.&lt;ref&gt;Kleinsteuber (2010), p. 23-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interrelation between transformation processes of political and media systems ==

The transformation research on media systems has its origin in transformation studies of [[political science]]s. Fragments of [[political science]] theories were applied in comparative [[media studies]],&lt;ref&gt;Kleinsteuber (2010), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;  since transformation processes of media systems are strongly connected to the transformation of [[political system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Voltmer (2008), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Katharina Hadamik (2003) describes this connection as "political-medial transformation-parallelism". She stresses that the media system in a [[State (polity)|state]] cannot take any path of transformation. It is connected to the transformation of the [[political system]]. For instance, [[State (polity)|states]] which develop democratic structures and [[constitution]]al conditions in their [[political system]] also build out free or relatively free media systems. In contrast, media systems in [[State (polity)|states]] with weaker or even no transformation of the [[political system]] have much higher barriers of development to overcome.&lt;ref&gt;Hadamik (2004), p. 54-56.&lt;/ref&gt; So, "it is the political system that ultimately has the power to make binding decisions and thus shapes the basic structure and functioning of the media system".&lt;ref name="Voltmer"&gt;Voltmer (2012), p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; This strong connection between [[political system|political]] and media system can be emphasized by watching the process of transformation from an [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] to a [[Democracy|democratic]] [[political system|system]] in both [[politic]]s and [[media (communication)|media]].

The transformation from an [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] to a [[Democracy|democratic]] [[political system]] has three phases:&lt;ref&gt;Merkel (1999), p. 119-169.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Phase 1: end of the old [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] [[regime]]

Phase 2: transformation and [[institutionalisation]] of [[democracy]]

Phase 3: [[democratic consolidation|consolidation of democracy]] through a new system

The process of transformation from an [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] to a [[Democracy|democratic]] media system also has three phases, similar to the phases of transformation in [[political system]]s:&lt;ref&gt;Hadamik (2004), p. 57-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Phase 1: breakthrough in the media sector

Phase 2: fixation of the changes in the [[Media (communication)|media]] sector

Phase 3: development of a stable media system

== Types of transformation processes==

In comparative media system research, scholars have identified three processes of change in media systems: homogenization, heterogenization, and hybridization.

=== Homogenization towards one model of media systems ===

In  the field of comparative media system research, homogenization is defined as the convergence of many media systems towards one specific model, caused by changes in [[Political structure|political]] and [[economy|economic]] structures, commercialization, and [[technological change|changes in technology]]. [[culture|Cultural]] differences between the countries are said to become less important, since a few international [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]] dominate the global [[media (communication)|media]] industry. In 2004, the authors Hallin and Mancini  attested a convergence of European media systems towards the [[Comparing Media Systems: Three Models of Media and Politics#The three models of media and politics|Liberal Media System]] prevalent in North America, the United Kingdom and Ireland. Relating to the convergence of media systems, four constitutive factors can be identified:&lt;ref&gt;Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004a), p. 25-41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004b), p. 251-254, 294-295.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boczkowski, Mitchelstein &amp; Walter (2011), p. 379.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Americanization: The changing [[organizational structure]]s and behaviors within the [[Media (communication)|media]] are heading towards patterns first established in the United States. Moreover, the US American model of politically neutral and professional [[journalism]] is becoming more and more influential for other media systems. The journalistic education of the United States has said to have been a strong influence on journalism cultures worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004a), p. 25-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004b), p. 254-259.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hardy (2008), p. 119-122.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Technological change: New [[technology|technologies]] can lead to adaptations by individuals and social [[institution]]s, for instance assuming new communication procedures associated with the new [[technology]]. These effects often produce common practices across different [[social environment|social contexts]]. The development of professional [[journalism]] is also connected to [[technological change]].&lt;ref&gt;Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004b), p. 259-261.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hardy (2008), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Secularization]]: The term [[secularization]] describes "the separation of citizens from attachments of religious and ideological 'faiths,' and the decline of institutions based on these faiths".&lt;ref&gt;Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004b), p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; This separation results in a decline of political parties, since they are connected to [[ideology|ideologies]] and particular social milieus. Hence, [[secularization]] leads media systems towards the [[Comparing Media Systems: Three Models of Media and Politics#The three models of media and politics|Liberal Model]].&lt;ref&gt;Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004a), p. 28-32, 34-38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004b), p. 263-267.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Commercialization: Commercialization can be seen as the most important force of homogenization. It has changed the print [[media (communication)|media]] as well as the electronic [[media (communication)|media]]. The transition of European broadcasting systems, from predominantly public service systems in the 1970s to a system with commercial domination today, gave the strongest impetus for homogenization. Thus, commercialization decreases the ties of media system and [[political system]].&lt;ref&gt;Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004a), p. 38-40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004b), p. 273-282.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a tendency of homogenization towards the [[Comparing Media Systems: Three Models of Media and Politics#The three models of media and politics|Liberal Model]] can be attested, there still are important differences between the systems. First of all, the variations between the [[political system]]s of each country seem to persist in the future. Furthermore, the [[party system|party]] and [[voting system|electoral systems]] between the countries remain different. Moreover, the [[List of country legal systems|legal systems]] of the countries are still distinct. Also, even though there is a trend towards neutral journalism, [[political parallelism]] in the national press of [[Comparing Media Systems: Three Models of Media and Politics#The three models of media and politics|Democratic Corporatist]] countries still persists and will probably remain in the immediate future. Thus, a complete converge of the media systems seems unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004b), p. 282-287, 301.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boczkowski, Mitchelstein &amp; Walter (2011), p. 380.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hardy (2008), p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also limits and countertendencies against homogenization. There is evidence of countertendencies relating to the reduction of [[Polarization (politics)|political polarization]] and [[ideology|ideological]] differences between parties. In some countries, new extremist parties on the far right of the political spectrum arose, motivated through issues of [[immigration]], [[multiculturalism]] and integration. Moreover, so called [[advocacy journalism]] does not only persist in [[Comparing Media Systems: Three Models of Media and Politics#The three models of media and politics|Polarized Pluralist]] countries (especially in Italy, Spain and Greece), but new forms of it are also beginning to proliferate in all kinds of media systems.&lt;ref&gt;Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004b), p. 284-285, 301.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heterogenization of media systems ===

Some scholars argue against the [[theory]] of homogenization of media systems that due to national [[political culture]]s and [[institution]]s, a process of heterogenization rather than homogenization, has to be stated.&lt;ref&gt;Boczkowski, Mitchelstein &amp; Walter (2011), p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt; The countertendencies of homogenization (for instance new right extremist parties, new forms of [[advocacy journalism]], divergence processes in the styles of election coverage between the United States and Great Britain) lead to heterogenization of the media systems.&lt;ref&gt;Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004b), p. 284-285.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the divergence of media systems is confronted by a much more fundamental convergence between them.&lt;ref&gt;Boczkowski, Mitchelstein &amp; Walter (2011), p. 389.&lt;/ref&gt; Hallin &amp; Mancini also argue that the results of their analysis do not support the thesis of heterogenization of media systems.&lt;ref&gt;Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004b), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hybridization of media systems ===

Hybrid media systems are defined as a blend of already existing practices and new practices from a new or foreign media system. Foreign models are adapted to the particular [[history|historical]], geographical, [[social]], and [[culture|cultural]] characteristics of the domestic media system.&lt;ref name="Voltmer" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de Albuquerque (2012), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hadamik (2004), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coman (2000), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than a temporary state of transformation, hybrid media systems are considered an [[:wikt:equilibrium|equilibrium]] between two types of practices. Thus, hybrid media systems are mostly located between [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and [[democracy|democratic]] [[political system]]s. Although they may have introduced competitive elections, they may not strengthen further [[democracy|democratic]] [[institution]]s beyond the basic requirements. Therefore, the degree to which hybrid systems adopt [[democracy|democratic]] practices can vary from state to state. Hybrid systems build out distinct patterns of politic-media relations with significant differences to Western media systems,&lt;ref&gt;Voltmer (2012), p. 231-245.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roudakova (2012), p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; for instance the Brazilian media system, which was influenced by the American [[journalism]] model. However, the American [[journalism]] system was not adopted one-to-one, since there "was no solid [[market economy]], [[individualistic culture]], or [[political culture]] that valued the freedom of press".&lt;ref&gt;de Albuquerque (2012), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the media system of Poland, which detached itself from its [[communism|communist]] ties in the 1990s and converged towards Western media systems, but still has its Polish specifics, such as the use of [[Public broadcasting|public-service broadcasting]] as a political instrument.&lt;ref&gt;Hadamik (2004), p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the three phases from an [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] to a [[democracy|democratic]] media system, the old [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] system ends by the [[institutionalisation]] of [[democracy|democratic]] elements (phase 1 and 2). In the third phase, the new hybrid system consolidates [[democracy|democratic]] elements, but some elements of the [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] system still exist. Thus, it is difficult to state when the third phase is completed.

In Hallin &amp; Mancini's ''Comparing media systems beyond the western world'' (2012), which gives an overview of criticism about their [[Comparing Media Systems: Three Models of Media and Politics|framework of 2004]] and furthermore extends and revises it, Katrin Voltmer states that, instead of media system homogenization towards the [[Comparing Media Systems: Three Models of Media and Politics#The three models of media and politics|Liberal Model]] of Hallin &amp; Mancini's framework, transformation processes rather move towards hybrid media systems, since [[media (communication)|media]] markets become more international, but have to adapt to local situations. Thus, the theory of hybridization in media systems is rather an adaption than a counterpart to the theory of convergence.&lt;ref&gt;Voltmer (2012), p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outlook ==
A consistent transformation [[theory]] valid for all transformation processes and countries, does not yet exist, since it is difficult to cover the variety and complexity of all the processes. Some researchers are of the opinion that it is impossible to find a consistent theory of transformation processes, because of the historical, political and social particularities of each country and their different types of transformation processes.&lt;ref&gt;Hadamik (2004), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the debate about convergence, divergence, or hybridization of media systems is still ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;Boczkowski, Mitchelstein &amp; Walter (2011), p. 377, 385-391.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12684">The '''transpersonal''' is a term used by different schools of philosophy and psychology in order to describe experiences and worldviews that extend beyond the personal level of the psyche, and beyond mundane worldly events. 

==Definition and context==

The transpersonal has been defined as experiences ''in which the sense of identity or self extends beyond (trans) the individual or personal to encompass wider aspects of humankind, life, psyche or cosmos''. &lt;ref name="Walsh &amp; Vaughan 1993"&gt; Walsh, R. and F. Vaughan. "On transpersonal definitions". ''Journal of Transpersonal Psychology''. Vol. 25, No2, pp. 199-207, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; The field of Transpersonal Psychiatry has defined the term as "development beyond conventional, personal or individual levels." &lt;ref name="Scotton et.al 1996"&gt; Scotton, Bruce W. "Introduction and Definition of Transpersonal Psychiatry". In Scotton, Bruce W., Chinen, Allan B. and Battista, John R., Eds. (1996) Textbook of Transpersonal Psychiatry and Psychology. New York: Basic Books. &lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand; ''transpersonal practices are those structured activities that focus on inducing transpersonal experiences''.&lt;ref name="Walsh &amp; Vaughan 1993"/&gt;

One of the founders of the field of [[transpersonal psychology]], [[Stanislav Grof]], has defined transpersonal states of awareness as such: ''The common denominator of this otherwise rich and ramified group of phenomena is the feeling of the individual that his consciousness expanded beyond the usual ego boundaries and the limitations of time and space''.&lt;ref name="Grof 1993"&gt; Grof, Stanislav. (1975, 1993). Realms of the Human Unconscious: Observations from LSD Research. New York: Viking, London: Souvenir Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term is related to the terminology of peak experience, altered states of consciousness, and spiritual experiences. &lt;ref name="Miller 1998"&gt; Miller, John J. "Book Review: Textbook of Transpersonal Psychiatry and Psychology". ''Psychiatric Services'' 49:541-542, April 1998. American Psychiatric Association&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grabovac &amp; Ganesan 2003"&gt; Grabovac, Andrea D. &amp; Ganesan, Soma. "Spirituality and Religion in Canadian Psychiatric Residency Training". ''Canadian Journal of Psychiatry'', Vol 48, No 3, April 2003&lt;/ref&gt; {{ref|a|Note a}} The term is also associated with psychedelic work, and psychotechnologies, that includes research with psychedelic plants and chemicals such as LSD, ibogaine, ketamine, peyote, ayahuasca and the vast variety of substances available to all human cultures throughout history.{{ref|b|Note b}}

==Origin of the term==

The term has an early precedent in the writing of philosopher [[William James]], who used the term "Trans-personal" in one of his lectures from 1905. &lt;ref name="Vich 1988"&gt; Vich, M.A. (1988) "Some historical sources of the term 'Transpersonal' ". ''Journal of Transpersonal Psychology'', 20 (2) 107-110&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Freeman 2006"&gt;  Freeman, Anthony. "A Daniel Come To Judgement? Dennett and the Revisioning of Transpersonal Theory". ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'', 13, No. 3, 2006, pp. 95–109&lt;/ref&gt; However, this early terminology, introduced by James, had a different meaning than the current one &lt;ref name="Freeman 2006"/&gt; and its context was philosophy, not psychology, &lt;ref name="Vich 1988"/&gt; which is where the term is mostly used these days.

There has also been some speculation of an early precedent of the term in the writings of [[Carl Jung]], as a result of the work of Jung's translators. It regards the jungian term ''ueberpersonlich'', used by Jung in a paper from 1917, which in later english translations appeared as ''superpersonal'', and later, ''transpersonal''.&lt;ref name="Vich 1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scotton et.al 1996"/&gt; {{ref|c|Note c}} In a later, revised, version of the ''Psychology of the Unconscious'' (1942) there was even a chapter heading called ''The Personal and the Collective (or Transpersonal) Unconscious''. &lt;ref name="Vich 1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lukoff &amp; Lu 2005"&gt; Lukoff, David and Lu, Francis. ''A Transpersonal-Integrative Approach to Spiritually Oriented Psychotherapy'', in L. Sperry and E. P. Shafranske (2005) Spiritually Oriented Psychotherapy, American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, the origin of the term transpersonal, as it is currently used in academic writing, is mostly associated with the [[human potential movement]] of the 1960s and the founders of the field of [[Transpersonal psychology]]; Anthony Sutich, [[Abraham Maslow]] and [[Stanislav Grof]]. &lt;ref name="Valle &amp; Harari 1985"&gt; Valle, Ronald S. &amp; Harari, Carmi. Current developments in...Transpersonal Psychology. ''The Humanistic Psychologist'', 11, Vol. 13, NO. 1, Winter 1985&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Vich 1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Judy 1994"&gt; Judy, Dwight. Transpersonal psychology: Coming of age. ''ReVision'', 02756935, Winter94, Vol. 16, Issue 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferrer2002"&gt; Ferrer, J. N. (2002). "Revisioning transpersonal theory: A participatory vision of human spirituality". Albany,NY: State University of New York Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lukoff &amp; Lu 2005"/&gt; According to Vich &lt;ref name="Vich 1988"/&gt; all three had used the term as early as 1967, in order to describe new ideas in the field of Psychology. In 1968 the term was selected by the founding editors of the [[Journal of Transpersonal Psychology]], Abraham Maslow and Anthony Sutich, in order to represent a new area of psychological inquiry. &lt;ref name="Vich 1988"/&gt;{{ref|d|Note d}} According to Powers &lt;ref name="Powers 2005"&gt; Powers, Robin. "Counseling and Spirituality: A Historical Review". ''Counseling and Values'', Apr 2005, Vol.49(3), pp.217-225.&lt;/ref&gt; the term “transpersonal” starts to show up in academic journals from 1970 and onwards.

==The transpersonal movement==

The collective of people and organizations with an interest in the ''transpersonal'' is called the ''transpersonal movement''. Walsh and Vaughan&lt;ref name="Walsh &amp; Vaughan 1993"/&gt; defines the transpersonal movement as ''the interdisciplinary movement that includes various individual transpersonal disciplines''. 

The philosophy of [[William James]], the school of [[Psychosynthesis]] (founded by Roberto Assagioli), and the Analytical school of [[Carl Jung]] are often considered to be forerunners to the establishment of transpersonal theory.&lt;ref name="Miller 1998"/&gt; However, the start of the movement is associated with the emergence and growth of the related field of [[Humanistic Psychology]]. Several of the academic profiles of the early transpersonal movement, such as [[Abraham Maslow]] and Anthony Sutich, had their background in Humanistic Psychology. &lt;ref name="Keutzer 1984"&gt;Keutzer, C.S. Transpersonal Psychotherapy: Reflections on the Genre. ''Professional Psychology: Research and Practice'', 1984, Vol. 15, No. 6, 868-883&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Valle &amp; Harari 1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor 1992"&gt;Taylor, Eugene. Transpersonal Psychology: Its several Virtues. ''The Humanistic Psychologist'', Vol. 20, Nos. 2 and 3, pp. 285-300, 1992. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walsh 1993"&gt; Walsh, R. The Transpersonal Movement: A History and State of the Art. ''Journal of Transpersonal Psychology'', 1993, Vol. 25, No. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  

The formative years of the transpersonal movement can be characterized by the founding of a few key organizations and institutions, such as: the [[Institute of Noetic Sciences]] in 1973, ''The International Transpersonal Psychology Association'' in 1973, [[Naropa University|Naropa Institute]] in 1974, and the [[Sofia University (California)|California Institute of Transpersonal Psychology]] in 1975.&lt;ref name="Taylor 1992"/&gt; The ''California Institute of Transpersonal Psychology'' later emerged as the ''Institute of Transpersonal Psychology'' and is today known as [[Sofia University (California)|Sofia University]]. 

Contemporary [[transpersonal disciplines]] include [[Transpersonal psychology]], [[Transpersonal anthropology]], [[Transpersonal sociology]] and [[Transpersonal ecology]]. Other academic orientations, whose main focus lies elsewhere, but that are associated with a transpersonal perspective, include [[Humanistic psychology]] and [[Near-Death Studies]]. &lt;ref name="Scotton Chinen Battista"&gt; Scotton, B.W., Chinen, A.B. and Battista, J.R. (ed. 1996). ''Textbook of Transpersonal Psychiatry and Psychology''. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary institutions include: the [[Association for Transpersonal Psychology]] (ATP), the ''European Transpersonal Psychology Association'' (EPTA), the ''International Transpersonal Association'' (ITA), and the ''European Transpersonal Association'' (Eurotas). Leading publications within the movement include: the [[Journal of Transpersonal Psychology]], the [[International Journal of Transpersonal Studies]], and the ''Journal of Transpersonal Research''.

==Transpersonal studies==

Several commentators note how the transpersonal field, and its vision, moved beyond the perspective of psychology and into other transpersonal domains during the 1980's and 1990's.&lt;ref name="Grof Friedman Lukoff Hartelius"&gt;Grof, S., Friedman, H., Lukoff, D., &amp; Hartelius, G. (2008). The past and future of the International Transpersonal Association. ''International Journal of Transpersonal Studies'', 27(1), 55–62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Caplan Hartelius Rardin"&gt;Caplan, Hartelius &amp; Rardin. Contemporary viewpoints on Transpersonal Psychology. ''The Journal of Transpersonal Psychology'', 2003, Vol. 35, No. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; This expansion of the transpersonal concept resulted in an interdisciplinary situation, and a dialogue with such fields as [[social work]], [[ecology]], [[art]], [[literature]], [[acting]], [[law]], [[business]], [[entrepreneurship]], [[ecopsychology]], [[feminism]] and [[education]].&lt;ref name="Caplan Hartelius Rardin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grof Friedman Lukoff Hartelius"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Atlas"&gt;Atlas, N. (2016). (Book Review) The Wiley-Blackwell handbook of transpersonal psychology, by Harris L. Friedman &amp; Glenn Hartelius (Eds.) ''International Journal of Transpersonal Studies'', 35 (2).&lt;/ref&gt;

In this respect, commentators have suggested that there is a difference between the founding field of [[Transpersonal psychology]] and a broader field of Transpersonal inquiry, known as ''Transpersonal studies''.&lt;ref name="Chinen 1996"&gt;Chinen, Allan B. ''The emergence of Transpersonal psychiatry''. In Scotton, Bruce W., Chinen, Allan B. and Battista, John R., Eds. (1996) ''Textbook of Transpersonal Psychiatry and Psychology''. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Atlas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedman 2002"&gt; Friedman, H. (2002). Transpersonal psychology as a scientific field. ''International Journal of Transpersonal Studies'', 21(1), 175–187.&lt;/ref&gt; This differentiation of the Transpersonal field has to do with the scope of the subjects under study, and the interest of researchers and theorists. 

In their review of transpersonal definitions, published in 1993, Walsh and Vaughan&lt;ref name="Walsh &amp; Vaughan 1993"/&gt; noted that ''Transpersonal studies'' had grown beyond the founding field of [[Transpersonal psychology]]. Commenting on the criticisms of Transpersonal psychology in the 1980's, Chinen &lt;ref name="Chinen 1996"/&gt; noted how the criticism did not differentiate between Transpersonal psychology, on the one hand, and a broad range of popularized transpersonal orientations, on the other. The same line of reasoning was picked up by Friedman,&lt;ref name="Friedman 2002"/&gt; who differentiated between a broad domain of inquiry known as Transpersonal studies, and a more narrow field of Transpersonal psychology. Both authors argued that the confounding of the two domains resulted in confusion. In a ''summary of contemporary viewpoints on Transpersonal psychology'' [[Jorge Ferrer]]&lt;ref name="Caplan Hartelius Rardin"/&gt; placed Transpersonal psychology within the wider "umbrella" known as ''Transpersonal studies''.

The [[International Journal of Transpersonal Studies]] was established in 1981. It is sponsored by the [[California Institute of Integral Studies]], and serves as the official publication of the International Transpersonal Association.&lt;ref name="Atlas"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5747">'''Virtual microscopy''' is a method of posting [[microscope]] images on, and transmitting them over, computer networks. This allows independent viewing of images by large numbers of people in diverse locations.  It involves a synthesis of [[microscopy]] technologies and digital technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=9–15 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.11.053 |pmc=1890021 |title=Internet-enabled high-resolution brain mapping and virtual microscopy |year=2007 |last1=Mikula |first1=Shawn |last2=Trotts |first2=Issac |last3=Stone |first3=James M. |last4=Jones |first4=Edward G. |journal=NeuroImage |volume=35 |pmid=17229579 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of virtual microscopes can transform traditional teaching methods by removing the reliance on physical space, equipment, and specimens to a model that is solely dependent upon computer-internet access. This increases the convenience of accessing the slide sets and making the slides available to a broader audience. Digitized slides can have a high resolution and are resistant to being damaged or broken over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Digital Pathology Virtual Microscope Slides for Hematology with Online Database |url=http://www.license.umn.edu/Products/Digital-Pathology-Virtual-Microscope-Slides-for-Hematology-with-Online-Database__20110025.aspx |publisher=Regents of the University of Minnesota |date=June 25, 2010 |accessdate=September 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to recent advances in virtual microscopy, slides were commonly digitized by various forms of film scanner and image resolutions rarely exceeded 5000 dpi. Nowadays, it is possible to achieve more than 100,000 dpi and thus resolutions approaching that visible under the [[optical microscope]]. This increase in scanning resolution comes at a price; whereas a typical flatbed or film scanner ranges in cost from $200 to $600, a 100,000 dpi slide scanner will range from $80,000 to $200,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1890021 | pmid=17229579 | doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.11.053 | volume=35 | title=Internet-enabled high-resolution brain mapping and virtual microscopy | date=March 2007 | journal=NeuroImage | pages=9–15 | last1 = Mikula | first1 = S | last2 = Trotts | first2 = I | last3 = Stone | first3 = JM | last4 = Jones | first4 = EG}}&lt;/ref&gt;
