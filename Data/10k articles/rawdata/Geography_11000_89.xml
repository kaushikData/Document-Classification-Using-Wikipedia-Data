The '''5th parallel north''' is a [[circle of latitude]] that is 5 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] [[true north|north]] of the [[Earth|Earth's]] [[equator|equatorial plane]]. It crosses the [[Atlantic Ocean]], [[Africa]], the [[Indian Ocean]], [[Southeast Asia]], the [[Pacific Ocean]], and [[South America]].

The [[Pacific Ocean]] is at its widest (approximately 19,300&amp;nbsp;km) on this parallel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pacific Ocean|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/437703/Pacific-Ocean|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''A31''' is a major [[trunk road]] in southern [[England]] that runs from [[Guildford]] in [[Surrey]] to [[Bere Regis]] in [[Dorset]].

==Route of road==
The road begins in Guildford at the start of Farnham Road near Guildford Station, coming out of the town and passing over the [[A3 road|A3]] where shortly after it becomes a [[dual carriageway]] running in a westerly direction along the [[Hog's Back]] escarpment of the [[North Downs]]. At [[Tongham]] it leaves the older Hogs Back route to join with the A331 and follow a modern bypass round [[Farnham]], rejoining the older route at the roundabout junction with the A325 where it follows Alton Road toward [[Alton, Hampshire|Alton]] which it bypasses, rejoining the older route near Jane Austen's house, then continuing to [[New Alresford|Alresford]] before [[concurrency (road)|joining the route of]] the [[M3 motorway (Great Britain)|M3 motorway]] at its junction on the eastern boundary of [[Winchester, Hampshire|Winchester]].  

The old route to Winchester's centre then [[Romsey]] and the [[New Forest National Park|New Forest]] forms two roads: the B3404 and [[A3090 road]]s and is marked for [[cyclist]]s. The west branch of the [[M27 motorway]] - M3 interchange has a flyover junction with the winding westbound A3090 on the western boundary of [[Cadnam]], having passed through the [[conservation area]] village centre, from where the resumed A31 continues as a dualled trunk road through the rest of the [[New Forest]], past [[Ringwood]] and enters [[Dorset]] just before it passes [[Ferndown]] where it resumes single carriageway width.  It passes [[Wimborne Minster]] and by-passes [[Charborough House|Charborough Park]] before terminating at a [[roundabout]] junction with the [[A35 road]] at [[Bere Regis]]. The A35 is not a trunk road east of Bere Regis, but is a continuation of the A31 trunk road to the west, thus the [[Highways Agency]] maintain it.

The A31 is part of the ancient route from London to Winchester.

The A31 between Wimborne Minster and Bere Regis, most of its Dorset stretch is primarily a single-carriageway road, used by heavy goods vehicles, and as such is relatively slow for a trunk road during busy times of the day.  However the [[River Stour, Dorset|River Stour]] is one of the most flood-prone rivers alongside in the region and a widened road would accelerate drainage and disrupt views of the valley from [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty|Areas of Outstanding Beauty]] on the [[escarpments]] to the north.

===A31 New Forest Dual Carriageway===
Many sections of the A31 were upgraded to dual carriageway in the 1960s, except for the section of road running through the [[New Forest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1966/jul/05/road-a31-improvements#S5LV0275P0_19660705_LWA_3|title=ROAD A.31 IMPROVEMENTS|date=5 July 1966|accessdate=21 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The upgrade of the A31 through the New Forest started in the early 1960s, following two decades of debate. The Government's intention was to create at least one high-speed route to the south coast, while the guardians of the forest, the [[Verderer (New Forest)|Verderers]], resisted any further development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1960/jul/27/a31-road#S5CV0627P0_19600727_CWA_85|title=A.31 Road|date=27 July 1960|accessdate=21 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1964/mar/24/new-forest-bill-hl#S5LV0256P0_19640324_HOL_265|title=NEW FOREST BILL [H.L.]|date=24 March 1964|accessdate=21 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first section of the A31 to be dualled was the section that the M27 feeds into at Jct1; the westbound carriageway is the original two-way A-road while the eastbound side was laid down nearby. Further developments occurred from Ringwood to [[Picket Post]] near the turn-off for [[Burley, Hampshire|Burley]]. From 1966-1972, the remaining sections were completed rapidly due to the construction of the M27 motorway up to Jct 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1976/jul/12/roads-south-hampshire#S5CV0915P0_19760712_CWA_96|title=Roads (South Hampshire)|date=12 July 1976|accessdate=21 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Highways Agency declares the New Forest A31 section as being 'an abnormal and heavy load route'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/knowledge_compendium/assets/documents/Portfolio/Movement%20of%20Abnormal%20Loads%20at%20Night%20-%201143.pdf |title=Highways Agency - Movement of Abnormal Indivisible Roads at Night |publisher=Highways Agency |accessdate=21 December 2011 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The westbound route, particularly, suffers from poor horizontal and vertical alignment due to its original function as an old single carriageway. The Highways Agency's route management strategy (RMS) for the A31 has identified that the westbound carriageway needs realigning at [[Cadnam]] where it undulates rapidly before negotiating a sharp right turn and passes an at-grade U-turn box, though there is no timetable for this at present. There is also a pinch point at Ringwood where the A31 interplexes with the A338; the section of road was widened to four lanes each way for the duration of the A338 interplex (following the upgrade of the Ashley Heath Junction to Bournemouth in the early 1990s) but a short section where westbound A338 traffic joins westbound A31 was left with 2 lanes, and the lack of capacity at this section causes safety problems and queues at peak times. Dorset County Council cites relieving this junction as a high priority in the Bournemouth LTP 2006-2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bournemouth.gov.uk/Residents/roads/transport/LTP/default.asp |title=Bournemouth Council LTP 2006-2011 |publisher=Bournemouth Council |accessdate=21 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415045417/http://www.bournemouth.gov.uk/Residents/roads/transport/LTP/default.asp |archivedate=15 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2014 the Government announced a series of schemes as part of a £15bn investment in transport infrastructure that included widening the Westbound carriageway to 3 lanes. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Major roads investment in London and the south east|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/major-roads-investment-in-london-and-the-south-east|website=www.gov.uk|accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A Highways Agency review in 2010 records that the collision rate between the A338 Ringwood junction and the Poulner Hill Interchange was 4.5 Personal Injury Collisions (PICs) per 100million vehicle kilometers, whilst the rate for the stretch between Poulner Hill and Picket Post is 11.7 PICs per 100million vehicle kilometers.

===A31 Between Bere Regis and Wimborne===
This section of road is single carriageway for its entire length, a long section around Winterborne Zelston has a 40&amp;nbsp;mph speed limit, and occasionally has mobile speed cameras in place.

There are no good overtaking places on this stretch of road due to its narrow, twisty nature. There are three long straight sections of road along [[Charborough House|Charborough Park]], at the end of each straight there is blind bend. Due to the lack of alternative overtaking places traffic use this stretch of road to overtake, but due to the blind bends this sometimes results in head-on collisions between vehicles. The 6&amp;nbsp;ft wall that runs alongside the road has many holes, and repaired sections which have been hit by cars over the years.

The A31 crosses the A350 at a large roundabout. Due to the volume of traffic crossing this roundabout on both the A350 and A31, clear lane markings have been added to ease congestion.

Sections along the A31 have been widened or straightened and junctions enhanced, particularly as the population of the main towns in [[Dorset]] has expanded.

===A3090 road===

A section of the A31 between Winchester and Ower in Hampshire is now known as the '''A3090'''.

Prior to completion of the M3 past Winchester in the 1995, the A3090 ran south west from the [[A33 road|A33]] at [[Kings Worthy]] (where the A33 diverted around the Winchester Bypass) to the centre of Winchester, before continuing along the historic route of the A31 from Winchester to Hursley. Here it ended at a junction with the A31, which at this time, having merged with the by-pass east of Winchester, re-emerged from the A33 at [[Otterbourne]] and ran to Hursley and on along the current route of the A3090.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=1:50,000 Map Sheet 185 (Winchester)|publisher=[[Ordnance Survey]]|year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A short dual carriageway section starts from the A36 roundabout near [[Ower]] and terminates just before the A27 multiplex south west of [[Romsey]].

An '''aimag''' ({{Lang-mn|Аймаг}}, [[Image:Ayimagh.svg|14px]] {{IPA|[æːmɑ̆ɡ̊]}}), originally a [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] word meaning "tribe", is an [[country subdivision|administrative subdivision]] in [[Mongolia]] and in [[Inner Mongolia]] ([[China]]).

==Mongolia==
{{Main|Provinces of Mongolia}}
In Mongolia, an aimag is the first-level administrative subdivision. The country currently has 21 aimags. The capital [[Ulan Bator]] is administrated as an independent municipality.

During the [[Qing Dynasty]], [[Outer Mongolia|Khalkha]] was subdivided into four aimags ([[Setsen Khan Aimag]], [[Tüsheet Khan|Tüsheet Khan Aimag]], [[Sain Noyon Khan Aimag]] and [[Zasagt Khan Aimag]]). An aimag was further subdivided into "banners" (''khoshuu''). Each aimag had an assembly of the local nobility, commonly named "league" in English (''chuulga'' in Mongolian).
This administrative structure was kept until 1930, when the current structure with smaller aimags, subdivided into [[sums of Mongolia|sums]], was introduced.

== Inner Mongolia ==
{{Main|Leagues of China{{!}}Leagues of Inner Mongolia}}
In [[Inner Mongolia]], aimags (in the Inner Mongolian context, usually translated as "league", from {{zh|c=盟|p=méng}}) are a prefecture-level subdivision, first-level when seen from Inner Mongolia and second-level when seen from the whole of China. Currently, Inner Mongolia has three aimags:  [[Xilin Gol League|Xilin Gol]], [[Hinggan League|Hinggan]], and [[Alxa League|Alxa]]. Inner Mongolian aimags are subdivided into banners  (''khoshuu'' in Mongolian, 旗 in Chinese) and further into ''sum''s (苏木 in Chinese).

During the Qing Dynasty, Inner Mongolia was divided into six assemblies of the local nobility (''chuulga'' in Mongolian, 盟 in Chinese). After 1949, this structure was largely kept, except that in Mongolian, the term ''chuulga'' was replaced by ''aimag'', and that several aimags were added. Beginning in the 1980s, most aimags have been converted into prefecture level cities.

[[File:Barrandov Rocks1.JPG|thumb|150px|Plaque with Barrande's name in the Barrandov rock]]
'''Barrandov''' is a neighbourhood in south-west Prague, Czech Republic, located in the cadastral district of Hlubočepy, in [[Prague 5]]. It is situated on and around some rock formations above the [[Vltava|Vltava River]]. Barrandov is known for its film industry and the film studios located in the old part of the district. The Czech national television services Nova and Barrandov TV broadcast from here. Old Barrandov consists of the villa quarter, [[Barrandov Terraces]] and [[Barrandov Studios]], and New Barrandov is located to the west of the old part. Barrandov has a population of about 20,000. A new tram line into New Barrandov was built in 2003.

The name Barrandov is derived from the fossil-rich rocks which were studied by the French geologist [[Joachim Barrande]]. The district was named in honor of Barrande on 24 February 1928.

The '''Caribbean Lowlands''' are a plains region along eastern areas of [[Central American]] nations. The area is usually between [[mountain ranges]] and the coastlines of the [[Caribbean Sea]].

==Geography==
The [[lowland]]s are mainly between the major [[American Cordillera]] System ranges running down the center of the [[Central American Isthmus]] and the [[Caribbean]] [[coast]]s.

In some areas of Central America, such as northern Honduras and [[Panama]], the Caribbean Lowlands are narrow to non-existent. In other areas, such as [[Nicaragua]] and eastern [[Honduras]], the lowlands expand into the plains of the [[Mosquito Coast]]. Wide coastal plains are also found further north along the Caribbean in [[Belize]].

==Ecology==
{{Main|Category: Ecoregions of Central America}}

The lowlands [[habitat]]s and [[plant community|plant communities]] are in [[Neotropic]] [[ecoregion]]s

'''Guthlac Ceri Klaus Peach''' (26 October 1939 - 2 October 2018) was a [[geographer]] from [[Bridgend]], Wales. He was an undergraduate (BA 1961), [[Graduate school|graduate]] student ([[Doctor of Philosophy|DPhil]], 1964),&lt;ref name="MCreg"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Levens|editor1-first=R.G.C.|title=Merton College Register 1900-1964|date=1964|publisher=Basil Blackwell|location=Oxford|page=507}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lecturer at [[Merton College, Oxford]]&lt;ref name="ODP"&gt;http://diversity.psy.ox.ac.uk/research-team/ceri-peach/ Retrieved 1 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; before being appointed to a lectureship in geography at [[St Catherine's College, Oxford]] (known colloquially as St Catz) in 1965 at the age of 26.&lt;ref name="Ceri Peach Trust Fund"&gt;St. Catherine's College: The Ceri Peach Trust Fund, St Catherine’s College Development Office, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He held this post jointly with a lectureship at [[Keble College, Oxford]] and a Faculty Lectureship at the [[University of Oxford]].&lt;ref name="St Catherine’s College Year2007 "&gt;St Catherine's College Year, 2007; St Catherine's College Development Office, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

He was elected as a tutorial fellow ([[teaching fellow]]) in [[geography]] at St Catherine's in 1969&lt;ref name="ODP" /&gt; and also held various non-teaching posts, including several college offices: Domestic Bursar, Senior Tutor, Finance Bursar and Acting Master. During his tenure as Senior Tutor, women were first admitted to the college. As Domestic Bursar, he negotiated college charges with the then Junior Common Room President, [[Peter Mandelson]].&lt;ref name="St Catherine’s College Year2007 " /&gt;

He was Professor of [[Social geography]] at the [[School of Geography and the Environment, University of Oxford]] from 1992 to 2007 and on retirement from his Oxford chair he was appointed Professor of at the Institute for Social Change at the [[University of Manchester]].&lt;ref name="ODP" /&gt;

==Time at St Catherine's College==

Peach found the move from Merton, Oxford's oldest college, to St Catherine's (known as St Catz), Oxfords newest college, to be liberating:

{{Quote|text=“When I arrived, Catz was still being built, the [[Taxus baccata|yew]] hedges in the quad were only knee-high, the Fellows were newly appointed and the drive was underway to make the college great."&lt;ref name="St Catherine’s College Year2007 " /&gt;}}

During his time at St Catherine's the number of undergraduate geographers accepted by the college increased from 4 each year to between 10 and 12. The University Schools results also became some of the best in the arts subjects at the college.&lt;ref name="Ceri Peach Trust Fund" /&gt; Notable students taught by Ceri Peach include [[Denis Cosgrove]], who went on to become [[Alexander von Humboldt]] Professor of Geography at [[University of California, Los Angeles]]; Mike Walker and Geoff Duller, who went on to become professors of geography at the [[University of Wales]]; Mike Summerfield, Professor of Physical Geography at the [[University of Edinburgh]]; Vaughan Robinson, professor at [[King's College London]]; Michael Keith, professor of sociology at [[Goldsmiths, University of London]]; Gary Bridge, professor at [[Cardiff University]], Chris Keylock, professor of fluid mechanics at [[Loughborough University]], and Dr Margaret Byron, teaching fellow at the [[University of Leicester]].&lt;ref name="Ceri Peach Trust Fund" /&gt;

Other graduates in geography taught by Peach at St Catherine's have achieved success in other fields and include [[Matthew Pinsent]], who received four gold medals for [[rowing (sport)|rowing]] in successive [[Olympic Games]].&lt;ref name="Ceri Peach Trust Fund" /&gt;

==Field of research==

Peach's main field of research is [[human migration]] and the [[racial segregation]] of [[minority group]]s, [[ethnic group]]s and [[Religious denomination|religious groups]] in the United Kingdom, the United States and Western Europe.&lt;ref name="Ceri Peach Trust Fund" /&gt;

During his [[sabbatical]] at the Demography Department of [[Australian National University]], in 1973, his understanding of the relationship between spatial patterns of [[residential segregation]] was transformed. This led him to investigate ethnic [[Interracial marriage|intermarriage]] as an index of social interaction.&lt;ref name="St Catherine’s College Year2007 " /&gt;

During his next sabbatical at [[Yale University]], in 1977, he disproved the 'triple [[melting pot]] theory' of American [[cultural assimilation]] which, based on data collection in [[New Haven]], [[Connecticut]], argued that while national ethnic identity in the United States would dissolve, it would do so within maintained religious boundaries of [[Catholic]], [[Protestant]] and [[Jewish]]. His research proved that while the so-called 'Protestant pot' seemed plausible, a 'Catholic-pot' seemed unlikely:&lt;ref name="St Catherine’s College Year2007 " /&gt;

{{Quote|text="As the Irish were residentially mixed with the British, Scandinavians and Germans, and separated from the Poles and Italians, this suggested an ‘old European’ rather than a ‘Protestant’ melting pot. There was, in fact, a white melting pot which began with the ‘old’ Europeans and into which Poles, Italians and, to an extent, Jewish populations were added as time went on."}}

His research in the 1970s and 1980s focused on [[housing tenure]] and segregation in the United Kingdom and the United States and during this time he worked closely with Dr Samir Shah and later with Dr Margaret Byron.&lt;ref name="Ceri Peach Trust Fund" /&gt;

In the 1990s and 2000s Peach continued his research on issues of segregation with particular focus on the dynamics relating to, and the arguments surrounding, [[Ghetto]] formation and [[White flight]]. This included differences between British and American cities and whether British cities had become more segregated than Chicago. He also examined the growth of the [[Muslim]] population in Europe, and particularly in Britain, and this has developed into a large scale study of the [[cultural geography]] of Muslim mosques, [[Sikh]] [[Gurdwara]]s and [[Hindu]] [[Mandir]]s on the landscape of Britain.&lt;ref name="St Catherine’s College Year2007 " /&gt;

His [[Economic and Social Research Council]] funded project on ethno-religio-linguistic sub-communities links his database on Muslim, Hindu and Sikh places of worship in the United Kingdom, completed as a millennium project, and funded by the [[Leverhulme Trust]], with the [[United Kingdom Census 2001]] data on [[ethnicity]] and religion. The Leverhulme survey photographed and collected data on religion, tradition, movements, vernacular language, date of foundation and other variables on nearly 1,000 buildings. Peach is a member of the Advisory Board of the [[Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies]] and the [[Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies]].&lt;ref name="GeogOx"&gt;http://www.geog.ox.ac.uk/staff/cpeach.html  Retrieved 1 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement==

On 22 September 2007 Ceri Peach retired from St Catherine’s College and became an [[emeritus]] fellow at the College.&lt;ref name="Ceri Peach Trust Fund" /&gt; a series of talks were given by former pupils and colleagues at the Oxford University Centre for the Environment on 22 September followed by a reception and speeches by professors [[Ron J. Johnston]] and Gary Bridge. St Catherine's has created the Ceri Peach Trust Fund to honour the 40 years' contribution Peach has made to the study of geography, and to ensure that geography continues to flourish at the college.&lt;ref name="Ceri Peach Trust Fund" /&gt;

Recalling his time at the college Peach remarked:

{{Quote|text="My career has been an exciting and a full one. I am grateful for the opportunities it has offered me to teach – and be taught by – my students, and also for the fellowship of my colleagues." &lt;ref name="St Catherine’s College Year2007 " /&gt;}}

==Subsequent career==

In 2008, the [[BBC]] reported that, along with Ludi Simpson and [[Danny Dorling]], Peach is considered to be one of the top three British thinkers in the field of racial segregation.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/5304276.stm Retrieved 3 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, he was nominated as "Ethnic Geography Distinguished Scholar of 2008" by the [[Association of American Geographers]] at their April meeting in [[Boston]].&lt;ref name="GeogOx" /&gt;

In 2016, Peach was awarded a [[Doctorate of Letters]] by the University of Oxford, which is one of the highest academic honors that the University may confer. It was given in recognition of contribution he has made to academia throughout his career, particularly to his main field of research in human migration and the racial segregation of minority groups, ethnic groups and religious groups in the United Kingdom, United States and Western Europe.&lt;ref name="Catz Eye"&gt;Catz Eye, the St. Catherine's College newsletter, Michaelmas 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interest in rowing==

Outside his research interests, Peach has maintained a keen interest in [[rowing]]:

{{Quote|text="Catz has had a strong stream of oarsmen – many of whom I have had the privilege to teach. Sir Matthew Pinsent (1989, Geography) remains a golden star – he never missed a tutorial, never failed to produce an essay, took a good degree and demonstrated that athletes at a high level are more conscious of time planning, and more efficient at meeting commitments, than many others with far less pressure on them."&lt;ref name="St Catherine’s College Year2007 " /&gt;}}

Other notable rowers, who comprise part of the strong Olympic Games rowing tradition at St Catherine's, include [[Colin Smith (British rower)|Colin Smith]] (2003, Geography), [[Andrew Triggs Hodge]] (2004, Geography and the Environment) and [[Stephan Mølvig]] (2005, Geography and the Environment).&lt;ref name="Catz Eye" /&gt;

The '''Chamberlin trimetric projection''' is a [[map projection]] where three points are fixed on the [[globe]] and the points on the [[sphere]] are mapped onto a plane by [[triangulation]]. It was developed in 1946 by Wellman Chamberlin for the [[National Geographic Society]].&lt;ref name="WC"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;
The projection's principal feature is that it compromises between distortions of area, direction, and distance. A Chamberlin trimetric map therefore gives an excellent overall sense of the region being mapped.&lt;ref name="christensen"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;
Many [[National Geographic Magazine#Map supplements|National Geographic Society maps]] of single [[continents]] use this projection.&lt;ref name="JPS" /&gt;

As originally implemented, the projection [[algorithm]] begins with the selection of three points near the outer boundary of the area to be mapped. From these three base points, the true distances to a point on the mapping area are calculated. The distances from each of the three base points are then drawn on the plane by compass circles. Unlike triangulation on a plane where three such compass circles will intersect at a unique point, the compass circles from a sphere do not intersect precisely at a point. A small triangle is generated from the intersections, and the center of this triangle is calculated as the mapped point.&lt;ref name="WC" /&gt;

A Chamberlin trimetric projection map was originally obtained by graphically mapping points at regular intervals of [[latitude]] and [[longitude]], with shorelines and other features then mapped by interpolation. Based on the principles of the projection, precise, but lengthy, mathematical formulas were later developed for calculating this projection by [[computer]] for a [[Datum (geodesy)|spherical earth]].&lt;ref name="JPS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="christensen" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chamberlin trimetric projection is neither [[Map projection#Conformal|conformal]] nor [[Map projection#Equal-area|equal-area]]. Rather, the projection was conceived to minimize distortion of distances everywhere with the side-effect of balancing between areal equivalence and conformality.&lt;ref name="christensen" /&gt; This projection is not appropriate for mapping the entire sphere because the outer boundary would loop and overlap itself in most configurations.

'''Dammträsk''' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]] for "Pond Swamp") is a small man made [[lake]] within the [[Tyresån Lake System]], located in [[Haninge Municipality]], south of central [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]].

The lake receives water from [[Övre Rudasjön|Övre]] and [[Nedre Rudasjön]] south of the lake and empties into [[Drevviken]] north of it.  Located just south of the residential area Kvarntorp, and north of the densely populated central Haninge, the wetland lake receives considerable amount of nutritive salts.&lt;ref name="Tyreså"&gt;Tyreså Collaboration&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental impact ==
The lake and the surrounding wetlands, together with local forests, are regarded as a valuable local natural resource worth to protect.&lt;ref name="Haninge-Kvarntorp"&gt;Haninge Municipality, ''Kvarntorp''&lt;/ref&gt;  However, while the lake system as a whole is regarded as sensitive to further loads of [[surface runoff]], Dammträsk is one of the lakes in Haninge already to contaminated to be regarded as vulnerable.&lt;ref name="Haninge-Dagvatten"&gt;Haninge Municipality, ''Dagvattenstrategi''&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been a conscious decision to redirect water from Rudasjön to Dammträsk, and, as much of the waste the lake receives is sedimented into the lake, Drevviken, the lake downstream is saved from contamination.  The price to pay, has been the dense vegetation in the lake.  Two abandoned facilities by the lake, a [[dry cleaner]] and a [[gas station]], has contaminated the area surrounding the lake.  In 2005, the area was restored and some 276 tons of earth containing [[Organochloride|chlorinated hydrocarbons]] and 595 tons containing [[petroleum]] was removed.&lt;ref name="SLL-Tyresån"&gt;Stockholm County Council, ''Samarbete''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biodiversity ==
An inventory of the local vegetation concluded there are 27 species of [[vascular plant]]s around the lake, which makes it relatively [[biodiversity|biodiverse]] (3/5 on a scale where 1 means high biodiversity).  One of the interesting species of [[aquatic plant]]s in the lake is [[Common Mare's Tail]].&lt;ref name="SöEko" /&gt;  [[Grass carp|Grass Carp]] has been introduced in the lake.&lt;ref name="SLL-Tyresån" /&gt;

As each egg was laid, it would roll from the hen's cage and trigger a mercury switch, connected to a panel. The panel would relay a pulse to the Eggatron, prompting a converted P.M.G. teletyper to print and time-stamp on a roll of paper tape. The recorded data was duplicated on magnetic tape, and fed into a [[SILLIAC]] computer.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=December 1962|title=The Eggatron|url=|journal=Rural Research in CSIRO|location=East Melbourne, Victoria, Australia|publisher=CSIRO: Agricultural Research Liaison Section|volume=41|pages=36-[37].|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tape data assisted in identifying the birds with high egg production levels, who were then selected for breeding.

First mentioned in a 1962 Australian journal article,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; the development of the Eggatron was attributed to Dr. P.J. Claringbold of Sydney University's Veterinary Physiology Department, but the device was designed by Dr. Rathgeber of the Physics Department.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Eggatron is but one of many [[tron]]-like developments of Cold War science that sought to control nature through technology, primarily through large centralized computer systems. The development of the [[phytotron]], [[algatron]], ecotron and zootron represents the explosion of these technologies through the 1950s and 1960s.

'''Franciscus Haraeus''' (Latinised form of '''Franciscus Verhaer'''; also known as '''Frans Verhaer'''),&lt;ref&gt;B.A. Vermaseren. De katholieke nederlandsche geschiedschrijving. p 223&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Utrecht]] 1555? - [[Leuven]], 11 January 1631), was a "Netherlandish"&lt;ref&gt;He was born in the still undivided [[Habsburg Netherlands]] in a part that would become the Dutch Republic, but spent a large part of his life in the Spanish Netherlands that would later become Belgium; both The Netherlands and Belgium could therefore claim him.&lt;/ref&gt; [[theologian]], [[historian]], and [[cartographer]]. He is best known for his history (from a Catholic point of view) of the [[Dutch Revolt]]. He was one of the first cartographers who made [[thematic map]]s and globes.

==Life==
Haraeus first attended the [[Latin school]] of the [[Brethren of the Common Life]] in Utrecht and subsequently studied theology at the [[Old University of Leuven|University of Louvain]] under [[Thomas Stapleton (theologian)|Thomas Stapleton]] and [[Molanus|Johannes Molanus]].&lt;ref name=Repertorium&gt;{{cite web|last=Haitsma Mulier|first=E.O.G. and Anton van der Lem (eds.) (1990)|title=Repertorium van Geschiedschrijvers in Nederland 1500-1800|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/hait001repe01_01/hait001repe01_01_0309.php#a309|publisher=The Hague|accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|172}}  He was ordained a Roman Catholic priest at an early age, probably in 1578. He was appointed as a professor of [[rhetoric]] at the then-new [[University of Douai]] where he also obtained a [[Licentiate of Theology]]. In 1581 he accompanied the [[papal legate]] [[Antonio Possevino|Possevin]] on an embassy to [[John III of Sweden]] and [[Ivan the Terrible]].&lt;ref name="Van der Aa"&gt;{{cite web|last=Van der Aa|first=A.J. (1867)|title=Biographisch woordenboek der Nederlanden, deel 8-1|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/aa__001biog09_01/aa__001biog09_01_0343.php#h0343|accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|165}}&lt;ref name=NNBW&gt;{{cite web|last=Molhuysen|first=P.C and P.J.

Back in the [[Dutch Republic]] he became a [[Canon (priest)|canon]] at [[St. John's Cathedral ('s-Hertogenbosch)]], later [[Dean (Christianity)|dean]] in [[Duinkerken]] and professor of theology at [[Tongerlo Abbey]]. In 1604-1609 he worked as a priest in Utrecht where he was in contact with [[Aernout van Buchel|Buchelius]]. After 1609 he moved permanently to the [[Spanish Netherlands]] where he became the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of a [[nunnery]] in [[Antwerp]], before becoming a canon in [[Namur, Belgium|Namur]] in 1617, and after 1621 in Leuven.&lt;ref name ="Repertorium" /&gt;{{rp|172}} He died in the latter city on 11 January 1631,&lt;ref&gt;According to both Van der Aa and Molhuyzen/Blok he died in 1632 but more modern sources like Haitsma Mulier give 1631 as year of death.&lt;/ref&gt; and was buried in the St. Peter Church in Leuven, near the tomb of Thomas Stapleton.&lt;ref name="Van der Aa" /&gt;{{rp|165}}

==Historical works==
Haraeus wrote (or maybe better, compiled) a large number of [[Hagiography|hagiographies]]. However, his historical works of longer lasting import concerned the first part of the [[Eighty Years' War]] through which he had lived himself. He took clearly the side of king [[Philip II of Spain]] against [[William the Silent]] which gave his work a [[polemic]]al and sometimes biased character. His first publication in this field was ''Onpartijdighe Verklaringhe der oorsaken der Nederlantsche oorloghs sedert 't jaer 1566 tot 1608''&lt;ref&gt;Impartial explanation of the causes of the Dutch war since the year 1566 till 1608.&lt;/ref&gt; (Antwerp 1612). This provoked a critical reply by the Dutch-Supreme-Court Justice [[François Vranck]], entitled: ''Wederlegghinghe van een seker Boecxke uytghegheven bij Franchois Verhaer, ghenaemt onpartijdighe verclaringhe der oorsaken van de Nederlantsche Oorloghe, sedert den Jare 1566 tot ten Jare 1608 toe''&lt;ref&gt;Refutation of a certain booklet published by Franchois Verhaer, entitled ... etc.&lt;/ref&gt;(published posthumously, 1618). Meanwhile, Haraeus had already started on his major history: ''Annales ducum seu principum Brabantiae totiusque Belgii tomi tres: quorum primo solius Brabantiae, secundo Belgii uniti principum res gestae, tertio Belgici tumultus usque ad inductas anno MDCIX pactas, enarrantur''&lt;ref&gt;Annals of the dukes or princes of Brabant and the entire Netherlands in three volumes: which are firstly Brabant alone, secondly the acts of the Prince of the united Netherlands, thirdly the Dutch troubles all the way up to the adventitious 1609 treaty, which they explain in detail.&lt;/ref&gt; (Antwerp 1623). This work was well received in the Spanish Netherlands where it long was a "best seller," not so much because of its originality, but because of its tenor. The third volume was reworked by its author, but this version only exists in manuscript; it was never printed.&lt;ref name="NNBW" /&gt;{{rp|530}}

==Cartographic work&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Van der Krogt|first=Peter C.J. and Günter Schilder|title=Het kartografische Werk van de Theoloog-Historicus Franciscus Haraeus (ca. 1555-1631) Annalen van de Koninklijke Oudheidkundige Kring van het Land van Waas|year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==
Haraeus was one of several clergymen from the Netherlands who around the turn of the 17th century made important contributions to the young science of map-making (another one was [[Petrus Plancius]]). He was one of the three cartographers in the Spanish Netherlands who kept the craft of globe-making alive there after the exodus of many cartographers around the turn of the 17th century.&lt;ref name=Krogt&gt;{{cite web|last=Van der Krogt|first=P.C.J.|title=Globi Neerlandici: De globeproduktie in de Nederlanden|url=http://cartography.geog.uu.nl/research/phd/vanderkrogt.html|work=Utrecht Cartography Dissertations 1989|accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1614 he published a six-[[Gore (segment)|gore]] map entitled ''Novus typus orbis ipsus globus, ex Analemmate Ptolomaei diductus''&lt;ref&gt;New image of the world as a globe, derived from the ''Analemmata'' of [[Ptolemy]].&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of the first instances of a [[thematic map]] as it showed the dispersion of Christianity and Islam at the time, using [[Map symbolization|map symbols]] developed by [[Jodocus Hondius]] in his ''Designatio Orbis Christiani'' (1607)&lt;ref&gt;Outmapping of the Christian World.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Novus typus orbis ipsus globus, ex Analemmate Ptolomaei diductus 1614|url=http://www.shop.nsw.gov.au/agencypubdetail.jsp?agency=85&amp;publicationId=9202&amp;categoryid=15&amp;subcategoryid=67|accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1624 a map entitled ''Lumen Historiarum per Orientem''&lt;ref&gt;Light of histories over the East.&lt;/ref&gt; was published by [[Balthasar I Moretus|Balthasar Moretus]] as part of a new edition of [[Ortelius]]' ''Theatrum orbis terrarum Parergon''&lt;ref&gt;Appendix to ''Theatrum orbis terrarum'' or Theater of the Lands of the World.&lt;/ref&gt; which recognized Haraeus as its maker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lumen Historiarum per Orientem|url=http://hdl.huntington.org/cdm/singleitem/collection/p15150coll4/id/3319/rec/20|accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This map was part of a set of two made earlier by Haraeus and designed as a catchall guide to sacred geography.&lt;ref name=Shalev&gt;{{cite book|last=Shalev|first=Zur|title=Sacred Words and Worlds: Geography, Religion, and Scholarship, 1550-1700|year=2011|publisher=Brill|pages=233–234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a final example, Haraeus ''Geographica restituta per globi trientes ''&lt;ref&gt;Geography set up by thirds of a globe.&lt;/ref&gt; (1618; see the illustration above) shows the world in three globe-gores. Note the insets: there is a map representing the 2nd-century worldview of Ptolemy in the lower-Eastern section, and a legend for the map in the lower-center, explaining symbols which identify religious habitations (a cross for Christian regions, a crescent for Islam, and a slanted arrow for barbarians).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Norman B. Leventhal map center|title=Geographica restituta per globi trientes|url=http://maps.bpl.org/id/m8797|accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3240">The island of Bonaire began to form as part of the [[Lesser Antilles island arc]] in the past 145 million years, beginning in the [[Cretaceous]]. The island has been submerged or partially submerged for much of its existing, forming large limestone and sedimentary rock formations, atop a thick basement of volcanic rocks. 

==Stratigraphy &amp; Geologic History==
The [[Washikemba Formation]] and [[Rincon Formation]] are the two oldest rock formations on Bonaire, both dating to the [[Cretaceous]]. The Washikemba Formation is five kilometers thick and contains [[basalt]] [[pillow lava]] formed as lava rapidly cooled in seawater, as well as submarine [[pyroclastic flows]] and some [[ammonite]] fossils in sedimentary rocks formed in a deep water environment.  In addition to basalt, there is also [[rhyolite]] and  basaltic [[andesite]]. Together, the formation was affected by low-grade metamorphism and primary minerals such as [[pyroxene]], [[plagioclase]] and [[hornblende]] altered to [[prehnite]], [[pumpellyite]] and [[zeolite]]. The Rincon Formation is a 30 meter succession of [[marl]] and calcareous sandstone outcropping in the center of the island and is faulted from the Washikemba Formation, making their exact relationship difficult to determine. It contains [[Maastrichtian]] [[Late Cretaceous]] shallow water fossils such as [[foraminifera]], algae, [[gastropods]], [[bivalves]] and [[rudists]].
 
===Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present)=== 
The [[Paleocene]] [[Soebi Blanco Formation]] is a 400 meter thick sequence of conglomerates, sandstones and mudstones at Seroe Largo in central Bonaire. It is similar to the [[Midden Curacao Formation]] in that it contains fragments of exotic rock not found in the area, such as [[quartzite]], [[gneiss]] and [[schist]]. [[Uranium-lead dating]] gives an age of 1.15 billion years old on [[zircon]] fragments within a [[granulite]] pebble from the formation, suggesting that it is eroded material from much older rock in South America. In other cases, fragments of Cretaceous limestone are included as well. 

Outcropping southwest of Montagne is the [[Eocene]]  [[Montagne Formation]], made up of yellow, weathering limestones. A lower limestone unit contains molluscs while an upper unit includes [[echinoids]] and large foramins. The [[Seroe Domi Formation]] spans Bonaire and neighboring Curacao and Aruba. Its base is volcanic [[breccia]] but on Bonaire contains [[Miocene]] fossils not found on the other islands. The largely dolomite formation seems to have formed in a deep reef offshore environment. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |author=Jackson &amp; Robinson |year=1994|title=Caribbean Geology: An Introduction|publisher=University of West Indies|p=255-258}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five limestone terrace formed during the past 2.5 million years of the [[Quaternary]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |author=Alexander, C. |year=1961|title=THE MARINE TERRACES OF ARUBA, BONAIRE, AND CURAÇAO, NETHERLANDS ANTILLES|publisher=Annals of the Association of American Geographers|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-8306.1961.tb00370.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''geology of [[Tanzania]]''' began to form in the [[Precambrian]], in the [[Archean]] and [[Proterozoic]] eons, in some cases more than 2.5 billion years ago. Igneous and metamorphic crystalline basement rock forms the Archean Tanzania Craton, which is surrounded by the Proterozoic Ubendian belt, [[Mozambique Belt]] and Karagwe-Ankole Belt. The region experienced downwarping of the crust during the [[Paleozoic]] and [[Mesozoic]], as the massive [[Karoo Supergroup]] deposited. Within the past 100 million years, Tanzania has experienced marine sedimentary rock deposition along the coast and rift formation inland, which has produced large rift lakes. Tanzania has extensive, but poorly explored and exploited natural resources, including coal, gold, diamonds, graphite and clays. 

==Stratigraphy &amp; geologic history==
The oldest [[Precambrian]] rocks in Tanzania form the stable continental crust of the [[Tanzania Craton]] and date to the [[Archean]] more than 2.5 billion years ago. The craton includes the vestiges of two Archean orogenic belts, the Dodoman Belt in central Tanzania, and the Nyanzian-Kavirondian in the north. The remains of these two belts produce lenses of sedimentary and volcanic rocks within [[granites]] and [[migmatite]]. The Dodoman Belt stretches for 480 kilometers, broadening westward and is composed of banded [[quartzites]], [[aplite]], sericitic [[schist]], [[pegmatite]] and [[ironstone]]. 

The Nyanzian Belt, by contrast, is mainly acid and basic [[basalt]], [[dolerite]], [[trachyte]], [[rhyolite]] and [[tuff]] in separated zones south and east of [[Lake Victoria]]. The [[Kavirondian System]] is closely related to the Nyanzian, but separated by an unconformity and a zone of intense deformation. The Kavirondian is believed to be the remains of a [[molasse]] that formed by the Nyanzian as evidenced by sedimentary rocks such as [[mudstone]], [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] as well as volcanics and grit. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Schluter, Thomas |year=2006|title=Geological Atlas of Africa|publisher=Springer|p=246-247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proterozoic (2.5 billion-541 million years ago)===
The [[Ubendian Belt]] is a highly metamorphosed and folded metamorphic zone with intrusive granites southwest of the Tanzania Craton, paralleling [[Lake Tanganyika]] and [[Lake Rukwa]]. It likely formed in the [[Paleoproterozoic]]. Most rocks in the belt are [[pelite]] or various types of volcanic rock. [[Gneiss]], [[hornblende]], [[biotite]], [[garnet]] and [[kyanite]] are common in the belt. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=246}}

Northwestern Tanzania has the [[Mesoproterozoic]] [[Karagwe-Ankole Belt]], with [[argillite]], moderately metamorphosed [[phyllite]], quartzites and sericitic schists. For the most part, the belt is only moderately folded, although deformation increases near granite intrusions. The belt is associated with [[Bukoban Series]] conglomerates, bedded sandstones and basalt flows which extend from the Ugandan border and terminate at the [[Rukwa Rift]]. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=248}}

The [[Mozambique Belt]] is a structurally and metamorphically complex terrane that abuts the edge of the Tanzania Craton and formed during the [[Neoproterozoic]]. The formation of the belt is related to the widespread [[Pan-African orogeny]] and most rocks are highly metamorphosed [[pyroxene]]-[[gneiss]], [[charnockite]], [[biotite]], [[hornblende]]. It also contains smaller occurrences of graphitic [[schist]], [[quartzites]] and crystalline [[limestone]]. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=248}}

===Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago)===
During the [[Paleozoic]], after the Pan-African orogeny and the formation of the supercontinent [[Gondwana]] the Mozambique Belt experienced millions of years of erosion. This erosive period continued as Gondwana joined with [[Euramerica]] to become the supercontinent [[Pangaea]]. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=248}}

===Mesozoic-Cenozoic (251 million years ago-present)===
In the [[Mesozoic]], a major rift valley spanning what is today southern Africa and southern South America began to fill with sediments, depositing the first rock units of the [[Karoo Supergroup]]—the most extensive stratigraphic unit in southern Africa. In the Tanzania region, situated in the interior of Pangaea, the Karoo Supergroup deposited between the [[Late Carboniferous]] and the [[Early Jurassic]], with sequences of terrestrial sediments. These sediments formed diverse rock units including [[sandstones]], [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]], [[tillite]], [[shale]], red and gray mudstones and periodically, limestone deposits. Many of the Tanzanian Karoo rocks from this period contain plant and animal fossils. 

With the fragmentation of Pangaea, the modern coastal region of Tanzania experienced a long lasting [[marine transgression]], which deposited limestone, [[marl]], sandstone and [[shale]] throughout the [[Late Jurassic]], [[Cretaceous]] and almost all of the past 66 million years of the [[Cenozoic]], up until the last 2.5 million years of the [[Quaternary]]. In the interior, the beginning [[East Africa Rift]] created large rift troughs, which filled with terrestrial sediments. [[Carbonatite]] volcanoes began erupting in the Cretaceous, a process that continued into the Cenozoic. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=248}}

Alkaline volcanic rocks, including [[olivine]] [[basalt]], alkaline basalt, [[nephelinite]], [[phonolite]], [[trachyte]] and pyroclastic flows from the [[Neogene]] are common north of [[Lake Nyasa]] and [[Lake Natron]]. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=249}}

==Tectonics &amp; volcanism==
The [[East African Rift]] system plays a key role in Tanzania's current day structural geology. [[Graben]] rift valleys often have volcanism associated with them. The Western Rift is filled with [[Lake Tanganyika]] and [[Lake Nyasa]], while the section from [[Lake Natron]] to Lake Nyasa is part of the Eastern Rift (also known as the Gregory Rift). [[Lake Rukwa]] and the [[Selous Basin]] occupy small, subsidiary rift basins. Structural geologists infer that [[Lake Victoria]] is situated in a downwarp in the crust between the two major rifts. 

[[Ol Doinyo Lengai]] is the world's only active volcano with [[carbonatite]] lava and last had a large-scale eruption in 1966.{{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=251}}

==Hydrogeology==
Unconsolidated, near surface alluvial aquifers, recharged from rainwater are common in coastal deltas and river valleys, with an average depth of 10 to 20 meters, with some as much as 200 meters deep. The Sanya Plain and Kahe Basin around [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] have a mix of pyroclastic flow debris and alluvial sediments, creating some of the best aquifer potential. 

The Coastal Sedimentary Aquifer is typically five to 30 meters thick, with a water depth of 10 to 35 meters below ground. Water quality varies, with periodic nitrate and salinity issues and better productivity from limestone and sandstone, compared with shale and marl. The Karoo Sandstone Aquifer is unconfined with intergranular flow and is also comparatively near surface—boreholes are seldom drilled more than 80 meters deep. 

Although often exhibiting low-permeability, the crystalline basement rock that underlies much of the country does host groundwater in fractures and weathered layers. The Pangani Basin has high yield bands of [[gneiss]] and metasediments, along with weathered zones and bedrock fractures in the Makutopuri Basin. Basement aquifers are typically 50 meters thick. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |title=Hydrogeology of Tanzania|publisher=British Geological Survey|url=http://earthwise.bgs.ac.uk/index.php/Hydrogeology_of_Tanzania#Hydrogeology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural resource geology==
Tanzania has extensive natural resources, although many remain poorly explored and underdeveloped. The country has 300 [[kimberlite]] locations, centered within 200 kilometers of Shinyanga, in the north. Of these, about 20% contain diamonds. Approximately 70 tons of gold have been produced Archean rocks, near Geita on [[Lake Victoria]] as well as Proterozoic rocks in the Mpanda and Lupa districts. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=249}}

Tanzania has some of the largest coal deposits in East Africa. A coal mine at Kiwira, close to [[Lake Nyasa]] produces 35,000 tons of coal per year. The Mongoro region has limestone, dolomite and white marble deposits. Rift valley lakes and coastal areas host poorly exploited evaporites. Tanzania has significant clay resources, including [[kaolin]] and [[bentonite]]. The Pugu Hill kaolin deposit is only partially exploited. International companies have been attracted to Tanzania by large graphite reserves, formed in [[kyanite]] gneiss and altered ore deposits. The altered ore type contains coarse flakes of graphite, often associated with [[tsavorite]] and [[tanzanite]]. 

A phosphate mine, in the north, near Minjingu stopped production in the 1990s before rehabilitation got underway in the mid-2000s. Because of its high growth economy, cement for building construction is an important natural resource. [[Tanga Cement]] has a 40 percent market share, producing 500,000 tons of cement a year from Jurassic limestones. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=250}}

===Oil and natural gas===
A large natural gas deposit was discovered at Songo Songo Island, 300 kilometers southeast of Dar es Salaam. However, other offshore and onshore exploration did not yield any results. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=251}}

'''Gramvousa''' also '''Grampousa''' ({{lang-el|Γραμβούσα or Γραμπούσα}}, further names include ''Akra'', ''Cavo Buso'', ''Cavo Bouza'', ''Garabusa'' and ''Grabusa'') refers to two small uninhabited islands off the coast of a peninsula also known as '''Gramvousa Peninsula''' (Greek: ''Χερσόνησος Γραμβούσας'') in north-western [[Crete]] in the [[Chania (regional unit)|regional unit of Chania]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://elliniko-panorama.gr/issues.php?issueId=26 Γραμβούσα - Μπάλος] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721080512/http://elliniko-panorama.gr/issues.php?issueId=26 |date=2011-07-21 }} Greek Panorama, Issue 27, May/June 2002 (Greek)&lt;/ref&gt; The Gramvousa Peninsula forms the westernmost of the two pairs of peninsulae in north-western Crete (the other being Rodopos Peninsula) and is the western part of Kissamos Bay.

The Gramvousa islands are administered from the municipality of [[Kissamos]]. 

==Naming==

'''Imeri Gramvousa''' ({{lang-el|Ήμερη Γραμβούσα}}), which translates to ''Tame Gramvousa'', hosts the remains of a [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] [[fort]] and the remains of buildings left behind by Cretan insurgents, who were compelled to live as pirates during the [[Greek War of Independence]]. Today, Imeri Gramvousa is a popular tourist attraction.

'''Agria Gramvousa''' ({{lang-el|Άγρια Γραμβούσα}}), which translates to ''Wild Gramvousa'', is much less hospitable and is located due north of Imeri Gramvousa. It has also been named ''False Gramvousa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Severin|1987}} page 141&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient times the larger island was known as ''Korykos'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Severin|1987}} page 133&lt;/ref&gt; which means ''leather bag''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Severin|1987}} pages 139-140&lt;/ref&gt; The island was name "Gramvousa" in honour of Vousa, the wife of a pirate chief and the only inhabitant of the island to evade capture when the pirates were forcibly removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Severin|1987}} page 133&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ottoman–Venetian Wars==

[[File:Afbeelding 175.jpg|left|thumb|280px|The walls of the fort at Imeri Gramvousa]]
The fort at Imeri Gramvousa was built between 1579 and 1584 during Venetian rule over Crete to defend the island from the [[Ottoman Turks]]. The fort remained in Venetian hands throughout the prolonged [[Cretan War (1645–1669)|Cretan War]], and in the treaty of 16 September 1669, which surrendered Crete to the Ottomans, Gramvousa, along with the fortresses of [[Souda (island)|Souda]] and [[Spinalonga]], was retained by Venice.&lt;ref name="Maltezou159"&gt;Maltezou, ''Crete under Venetian rule'', p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; These three forts defended Venetian [[trade routes]] and were also strategic bases in the event of a new [[Ottoman–Venetian Wars|Ottoman–Venetian war]] for Crete.&lt;ref name="Detorakis343"&gt;Detorakis, ''Turkish rule in Crete'', p. 343&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 December 1691, during the [[Morean War]] (another Ottoman–Venetian war), the Neapolitan Captain de la Giocca{{verify source|date=March 2010}} betrayed the Venetians by surrendering Gramvousa to the Ottoman Turks for a generous bribe. He lived the rest of his life in [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] and was well known by the nickname "Captain Grambousas".&lt;ref name="Detorakis343"/&gt; Not long after the start of Turkish rule, Cretan insurgents used to gather at the three coastal forts which included Gramvousa.&lt;ref name="Detorakis355"&gt;Detorakis, ''Turkish rule in Crete'', p. 355&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greek War of Independence==

With the outbreak of the [[Greek War of Independence]], the fort fell to the insurgents' hands. In 1823, [[Emmanouil Tombazis]], the Greek provisional government's [[commissioner]] for Crete, failed to strengthen the defences at Gramvousa when he had the opportunity, soon after his arrival on the island.&lt;ref name="Detorakis378"&gt;Detorakis, ''Turkish rule in Crete'', p. 378&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the summer of 1825, a body of three to four hundred Cretans, who had fought with other Greeks in the [[Peloponnese]], journeyed to Crete. On 9 August 1825, led by Dimitrios Kallergis and Emmanouil Antoniadis, this group of Cretans, disguised as Turks, captured the fort at Gramvousa, which became their base. These and subsequent actions revitalized the Cretan insurgency, ushering the so-called "Gramvousa period".&lt;ref name="Detorakis381"&gt;Detorakis, ''Turkish rule in Crete'', p. 381&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Ottomans did not manage to retake the fort, they were successful in blocking the spread of the insurgency to the islands' western provinces. The insurgents were besieged in Gramvousa for more than two years and they had to resort to piracy to survive. Gramvousa became a hive of piratical activity that greatly affected Turkish-Egyptian and European shipping in the region. During that period the population of Gramvousa became organised and they built a school&lt;ref name="Detorakis422"&gt;Detorakis, ''Turkish rule in Crete'', p. 422&lt;/ref&gt; and a church. The church was called ''[[Panagia]] i Kleftrina'' and was dedicated to the wives of the [[klephts]], namely the pirates.&lt;ref name="Detorakis383"&gt;Detorakis, ''Turkish rule in Crete'', p. 383&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1828, the new Governor of [[Greece]], [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], sent [[Alexander Mavrocordatos]] with British and French ships to Crete to deal with the pirates. This expedition resulted in the destruction of all pirate ships at Gramvousa and the fort came under British control.&lt;ref name="Detorakis383"/&gt; On 5 January 1828, on Kapodistrias' orders [[Hatzimichalis Dalianis]] landed at Gramvousa with 700 men.&lt;ref name="Detorakis383"/&gt;

During the Cretan revolt of 1878, only the forts at Gramvousa, [[Ierapetra]], [[Spinalonga]], [[Heraklion]], [[Rethymnon]], Izeddin, [[Hania]], and [[Kissamos]] could not be captured by the insurgents because they did not have the necessary artillery.&lt;ref name="Detorakis408"&gt;Detorakis, ''Turkish rule in Crete'', p. 408&lt;/ref&gt;

==Balos Lagoon==

There is a lagoon, named the Balos lagoon, between the island and the coast of Crete. There is an islet which forms part of a cape, through the lagoon, called Cape Tigani (which means "frying pan" in Greek). North of Balos, at the Korykon cape, are the ruins of the small ancient Roman city of [[Agnion]], with a temple to the god [[Apollo]].

'''Harold Chillingworth Brookfield''' (born 1926 in England) is a British and Australian geographer specialising in the analysis of rural development, small-scale societies, family farming, and the relationship between land use and society in developing countries. He retired from the [[Australian National University]] in 1991.

==Background==
Harold Brookfield grew up in North London, England and attended [[Minchenden Grammar School]] from 1937–1943. Apparently remaining in London through the war, he took a BSc degree in geography, graduating in 1945 from the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]], University of London at age 19 or 20. His PhD followed in 1950, a study of post-eighteenth century urban development in coastal Sussex. However interests soon shifted to rural issues in developing nations.

His academic positions were:
* Assistant lecturer in Geography at Birkbeck College at the University of London, from 1948–1952.
* Lecturer and head, Department of Geography at the University of Natal in Durban, South Africa, 1952–1955. 
* [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]] Australia 1955–1957.
* Fellow, [[Australian National University]] (ANU), 1957–1969
* Professor at Pennsylvania State University 1969–1971 (he resigned.&lt;ref&gt;"The one that finally did tempt me to accept included a proposal that I play a leading role in a new African studies center at Pennsylvania State, but on arrival I quickly found this was at that time nothing but a front, and that it seemed to be assumed I would become a cultural ecologist of the United States. My actual teaching role seemed to me to resemble that of an assembly-line operative in a huge education factory. All this was discouraging, but the worst part of the experience was that Pennsylvania State University was located deep in 'middle America', and I had gone there in 1969 at the height of the Nixon period in American history. I quickly developed contacts in Canada, and on the day Nixon invaded Cambodia in 1970 I happily resigned my tenured post to go to what was initially a very temporary position at McGill." Brookfield, H.C. 2004: American Geography and one non-American geographer. ''Geojournal'' 59, 39–41.&lt;/ref&gt;)
* Professor at McGill University in Canada 1971–1976, including a Guggenheim Fellowship.
* Chair of Geography at the University of Melbourne 1976–1982, including extensive periods working for the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Programme. 
* Professor, Australian National University 1982–1991.
* Emeritus professor, ANU 1991–. Also project Director and researcher with [http://archive.unu.edu/env/plec/index.htm PLEC] until the early 2000s.

He was also an Honorary Fellow at the Institute of Development Studies, University of Sussex in the 1970s, and led the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Programme in Fiji.

==Contributions==
Brookfield's research was primarily dedicated to the study of rural societies and the environment in developing nations. He emphasises field studies at the microlevel, drawing on understandings from a range of disciplines. He developed close comparative research methods, identified with [[cultural ecology]] to understand rural societies and particularly food-getting activities and farming systems.&lt;ref name="IAG"&gt;http://www.iag.org.au/about/awards-of-the-iag/brookfield-citation/&lt;/ref&gt; Brookfield wrote that his abiding concern was the ‘… adaptation of the use and management of land to variability and change in society, economy and natural environment’; this he called the ‘soul’ of geography (Brookfield, 2004, 40).&lt;ref&gt;Brookfield, H.C. 2004: American Geography and one non-American geographer. ''Geojournal'' 59, 39–41.&lt;/ref&gt; He was always ‘… drawn back to the practice and often times humbling experience of fieldwork in distant farmlands, forests, islands and mountains of the developing world’ (Connell and Waddell, 2005, 130). Particularly while working at the ANU, beginning in Papua New Guinea, he worked on the 'how' and the 'why' of land use, agrarian systems, and rural development. This came to be known as the 'Brookfield school' of analysis.&lt;ref name="IAG" /&gt;

Brookfield’s book ‘Interdependent Development’, written in 1975 was lauded as a classic (Corbridge, 1996; O’Connor, 1996). It started a ‘… theoretical backlash against the irrelevance of several geographical traditions’, and argued for a more historical and green/environmental perspective, based on empirical research (Connell and Rugendyke, 2005, 58). His collaboration with [[Piers Blaikie]] produced one of the key political ecology texts, 'Land Degradation and Society' in 1987.

The [[United Nations University]]'s Project on People, Land, Management and Environmental Change ([http://archive.unu.edu/env/plec/index.htm PLEC]) was a major comparative initiative begun by Brookfield and others, looking at different land use trajectories and how farming actually creates positive biodiversity in the tropics. It promoted farmers as experts. It started in 1992 and was latterly funded by the [[Global Environmental Facility]] until 2002. It has resulted in many substantial works.

In geology and geomorphology, a '''hogback''' or '''hog's back''' is a long, narrow [[ridge]] or a series of hills with a narrow crest and steep slopes of nearly equal inclination on both flanks. Typically, the term is restricted to a ridge created by the differential [[erosion]] of [[outcrop]]ping, steeply dipping (greater than 30–40°), [[Homocline|homoclinal]], and typically [[sedimentary]] [[strata]]. One side of a hogback (its backslope) consists of the surface (bedding plane) of a steeply dipping rock stratum called a [[dip slope]]. The other side (its [[escarpment]], frontslope or "scarp slope") is an erosion face that cuts through the [[Strike and dip|dipping strata]] that comprises the hogback.&lt;ref name="Huggett2011a"&gt;Huggett, JR (2011) ''Fundamentals of Geomorphology,'' 3rd ed., Routledge, New York. 516 pp. {{ISBN|978-0415567756}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cotton1952a"&gt;Cotton, CA (1952) ''Geomorphology An Introduction to the Study of Landforms, 6th ed.'' John Wiley and Sons, New York. 505 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fairbridge1968a"&gt;Fairbridge, RW (1968) ''Hogback and Flatiron.'' In RW Fairbridge, ed., pp. 524-525, ''The Encyclopedia of Geomorphology'' (Encyclopedia of Earth Sciences, Volume III), Reinhold, New York, 1296 pp. {{ISBN|978-0879331795}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson2005a"&gt;Jackson, JA, J Mehl and K Neuendorf (2005) ''Glossary of Geology.'' American Geological Institute, Alexandria, Virginia. 800 pp. {{ISBN|0-922152-76-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "hogback" comes from the [[Hog's Back]] of the [[North Downs]] in [[Surrey]], [[England]], which refers to the landform's resemblance in outline to the back of a [[pig|hog]].&lt;ref name="Huggett2011a"/&gt; The term is also sometimes applied to [[drumlin]]s and, in [[Maine]], to both [[esker]]s and ridges known as "horsebacks".&lt;ref name="Jackson2005a"/&gt;

Hogbacks are a typical regional topographic expression of outcrops of steeply dipping strata, commonly sedimentary strata, that consist of alternating beds of hard, well-lithified strata, i.e. [[sandstone]] and [[limestone]], and either weak or loosely cemented strata, i.e. [[shale]], [[mudstone]], and [[marl]]. The surface of a hard, erosion-resistant layer forms the back slope (dip-slope) of the hogback where weaker strata have been preferentially stripped off of it by erosion. The opposite slope that forms the front of a hogback, which is its escarpment or scarp, consists of a slope that cuts across the [[Bed (geology)|bedding]] of the strata. Because of the steeply dipping nature of the strata that forms a hogback, a slight shift in location may take place as the landscape is lowered by erosion, but it will be a matter of feet rather than miles, as might happen with [[cuesta]]s.&lt;ref name="Fairbridge1968a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thornbury1954a"&gt;Thornbury, W. D., 1954, "Principles of Geomorphology'' New York, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 618 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

All gradations occur between hogbacks, [[homoclinal ridge]]s, and [[cuesta]]s. The differences between these landforms are related to the steepness in dip of the resistant beds from which they have been eroded and to their geographic extent. Where each type occurs depends upon whether the local rock attitudes are either nearly vertical, moderately dipping, or gently dipping. Because of their gradational nature, the exact angle of dip and slope that separates these landforms is arbitrary and some differences in the specific angles used to define these landforms can be found in the scientific literature. In addition, it also can be difficult to distinguish immediately adjacent members of this series of landforms.&lt;ref name="Fairbridge1968a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thornbury1954a"/&gt;

==Examples of hogbacks==

===Europe===

====United Kingdom====

*[[Hog's Back]], of the [[North Downs]] in [[Surrey]], [[England]]; the original hogback from which the landform derives its name. Formed from a [[Monocline|monoclinal]] fold, leading to steeply dipping chalk beds which are more resistant to erosion than the flanking clays.

====Belgium====

*The [[Richelsley]] in the western [[North Eifel]], [[Belgium]].

====Germany====

*The [[Teufelsmauer (Harz)|Teufelsmauer]] ("Devil's Wall") in the northern [[Harz Foreland]].
*The [[Externsteine]] in the [[Teutoburg Forest]].
*The [[Ith]], a knife-edge ridge in the [[Weser Uplands]].

===North America===

====Colorado====

[[File:Hogback DinoRidge.JPG|thumb|[[Dinosaur Ridge]], west of [[Denver, Colorado]]. It is formed by the more erosion-resistant sandstones of the Dakota Formation protecting the softer, less erosion-resistant strata of the Morrison Formation.]]
[[File:Hogsback up Bald Mountain, Fulton Chain , N. Y (NYPL b12647398-68524).tiff|thumb|Hogsback up Bald Mountain, in the [[Adirondacks]] of [[New York (state)|New York]]]]
[[Dinosaur Ridge]] is a well known hogback that is part of Morrison Fossil Area National Natural Landmark within [[Morrison, Colorado]]. It is a hogback formed by the differential erosion of well-cemented sandstones of the [[Cretaceous]] [[Dakota Formation]], which form the dip slope of this hogback, overlying the less erosion-resistant and interbedded mudstone, siltstone, and thinly-bedded sandstones of the [[Morrison Formation]] of [[Jurassic]] age. Dinosaur Ridge is only a short segment of the Dakota Hogback that extends the length of the Front Range from Wyoming to southern Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;Lockley, M, and L. Marquardt (1995) “A Field Guide to Dinosaur Ridge'' Friends of Dinosaur Ridge and the University of Colorado at Denver Trackers Research Group.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Grand Hogback]] is a 70-mile-long ridge located in western Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;New Castle, Colorado. [http://newcastlecolorado.org/our-community/living-in-new-castle Living in New Castle]. Retrieved: 2017-03-27.&lt;/ref&gt; It marks part of the boundary between the [[Colorado Plateau]] to the west and the [[Southern Rocky Mountains]] to the east.&lt;ref&gt;Colorado Mountain College.

====Black Hills====

While most hogbacks snake along a surface in a relatively sinuous line, a few, such as those in [[Sundance, Wyoming]], encircle a [[dome (geology)|dome]]. The [[Dakota Hogback|Dakota Sandstone Hogback]] encircles the [[Black Hills]], an [[elliptical]] dome spanning from [[Ordinal direction|northwestern]] [[South Dakota]] to [[Ordinal direction|northeastern]] [[Wyoming]]. The Black Hills are approximately 125 miles long and 65 miles wide. The Dakota Hogback [[ridge]] formed when the resistant sandstones of the Dakota [[Sandstone]] and underlying strata were [[tectonic uplift|uplifted]] near the center of the present-day Black Hills because of a [[granite]] [[intrusion]], approximately 60 million years ago. The Black Hills are the easternmost segment of the [[Laramide orogeny]]. The Dakota hogback rim separates the surrounding flat [[plain]]s from the two-mile-wide Red Valley trench of the Black Hills. The ridge "presents a steep face towards the valley and rises several hundred feet above it.&lt;ref name="Darton1909a"&gt;Darton, NH (1909) [https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/pp65 ''Geology and water resources of the northern portion of the Black Hills and adjoining regions in South Dakota and Wyoming.''] Professional Paper no 65.

Green Mountain ([https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;q=green%20mountain%2Bsundance%2C%20wy&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wl Google Maps]), also known as the Little Sundance Dome, is found just east of Sundance, Wyoming. It is a circular dome about 1800m across and 1400m wide surrounded by a rim of triangular hogbacks (similar in appearance to [[Flatiron (geomorphology)|flatirons]]). Green Mountain itself, much like the nearby Black Hills, is a [[laccolith]] formed by the [[intrusion (geology)|intrusion]] of [[magma]] into the [[Earth]]'s [[crust (geology)|crust]].&lt;ref name="Cleland1916a"&gt;Cleland, HF (1916) ''Geology, Physical and Historical.''

The '''Hook granite massif''' is a large formation in central [[Zambia]] formed around 550 million years ago during the [[Pan-African orogeny]].
It lies in the inner part of the [[Lufilian arc]].&lt;ref name=Hanson1999/&gt;
Today, the south-western extension of the massif lies under the [[Kafue National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2012-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==

Field studies and [[uranium-lead dating|U-Pb (uranium-lead) dating]] show that the massif is a large composite [[batholith]] that has intruded into the upper Katangan (Kundelungu) strata of sediments in the Lufilian arc during or after [[Tectonics|tectonic]] activity.
Sample U-Pb dates for syntectonic granite in the massif are 559±18 and 566±5 Ma, and for post-tectonic granite 533±3 Ma.
These show that the Kundelungu sediments date to before 570 Ma; the deformation of the inner Lufilian arc and voluminous syntectonic granite [[plutonism]] took place around 560–570 Ma; and the major tectonic activity had ended by around 530–540 Ma.&lt;ref name=Hanson1999/&gt;

The Hook massif is bounded to the south by the [[Mwembeshi dislocation]], a Pan-African transcurrent shear zone. 
Syntectonic rhyolite intruded in this shear zone dates to 551±19 Ma, so the transcurrent shearing happened about the same time as the batholith intrusion and was probably due to the same causes.
Syntectonic and post-tectonic granite plutonism also took place around the same time in the [[Damara belt]] in Namibia, indicating a link with the Lufilian arc and [[Zambezi belt]] during the Pan-African orogeny.&lt;ref name=Hanson1999/&gt;

'''ISO 3166-2:RW''' is the entry for [[Rwanda]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Rwanda, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[provinces of Rwanda|1 city and 4 provinces]]. The city [[Kigali]] is the capital of the country and has special status equal to the provinces.

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|RW}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Rwanda. The second part is two digits:
* 01: city
* 02&amp;ndash;05: provinces

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

The '''Kelvin Seamount''' is a [[guyot]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. It is part of the [[New England Seamounts]], which was active more than 100 million years ago. It was formed when the [[North American Plate]] moved over the [[New England hotspot]].&lt;ref name="NOAA2"&gt;{{cite web | title = Geological Origin of the New England Seamount Chain | work = National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration | publisher = U.S. Department of Commerce | year = 2005 | url = http://www.oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/explorations/03mountains/background/geology/geology.html | accessdate = 2007-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kelvin Seamount is also known as '''Kelvin Bank'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marineregions.org/gazetteer.php?p=details&amp;id=5149|title=Marine Gazetteer Placedetails|accessdate=2017-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Laser line level.jpg|thumb|150px|Typical consumer laser line level using [[spirit level]]s for three planes and including a digital stud sensor display.]]

A '''laser line level''' is a tool combining a [[spirit level]] and/or [[plumb bob]] with a [[laser]] to display an accurately horizontal or vertical illuminated line on a surface the laser line level is laid against.
Laser line levels are used wherever accurate verticals and horizontals are required, typically in the [[construction]] and [[Cabinet (furniture)|cabinetry]] industries. Some models are inexpensive enough for [[do-it-yourself]] applications.

The laser beam is fanned to produce a thin plane beam accurately horizontal or vertical, rather than a pinpoint beam. The axis of the laser is offset from the wall, so that a pinpoint beam would be parallel to and offset from the wall, and would not illuminate it; the fanned beam will intersect the wall, creating an accurately horizontal (or vertical) illuminated line along it.

The machine is set up using the built-in spirit level or plumb bob, and the line along the surface is then guaranteed to be accurately horizontal or vertical to within a certain tolerance, specified either in millimetres per metre or fractions of an inch over a specified distance in feet. A more advanced device may be accurate to within 0.3&amp;nbsp;mm/m; while lower-end models may be closer to 1.5&amp;nbsp;mm/m.

The illuminated line is necessarily absolutely straight, so that the line level can be used as a [[straightedge]]; for example, to see if a shelf is [[Wood warping|warp]]ed, even if not horizontal.

{{Americans}}
This is a list of '''notable [[Armenian Americans|Armenian-Americans]]''', including both original immigrants who obtained American citizenship and their American descendants.

'''American Armenians''' are people born, raised, or who reside in the United States, with origins in the country known as Armenia, which ranges from the Caucasian mountain range to the Armenian plateau. There has been sporadic emigration from Armenia to the U.S. since the late 19th century, with the biggest influx coming after the [[Armenian Genocide]] of the early 20th century. The largest community is based in [[Los Angeles]]; however, other sizeable communities exist in [[Boston]], [[Detroit]] and the [[New York metropolitan area]].

Statistics from the [[United States 2000 Census]], 385,488 Americans indicated either full or partial Armenian ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&amp;-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_QTP13&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-redoLog=false&amp;-_sse=on U.S census Bureau]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--'''To be included in this list, the person must have a Wikipedia article showing they are Armenian American or must have references showing they are Armenian American and are notable.'''
When adding names to the list, please include a reliable source that describes the person added as "Armenian" or "Armenian-American" (or a source where the person describes themselves as such), in accordance with Wikipedia's [[No Original Research]] policies.--&gt;
&lt;!--'''For inclusion to this list, each entry must be notable and have an article with references validating their Armenian-American ancestry. Keep blurbs short and do not include real name nor connection of Armenian ancestry as (1) anyone on this list should have valid link in their article showing how they are of Armenian ancestry; (2) their articles should discuss their body of work (films, television, literary works, etc.); and (3) their biographical information such as their real names.'''
In order to keep list concise, please list entry only '''ONCE''' in category where they have the most connection. --&gt;
&lt;!-- Please do not add yourself, non-notable people or fictional characters. Please add citations where appropriate ---&gt;

This is a '''list of windows on [[Main Street, U.S.A.]]''' at the [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts#Disney resorts|Disney resorts]]. The names painted in the windows serve as credits for some of the many people who contributed in some manner to the parks ([[Disneyland Paris]] being an exception, where some refer to characters or stories from Disney films and shows). Typically they appear as fictional businesses (realtors, dentists, etc.), and often refer to a hobby of or development made by the person honored. [[Bob Gurr|Bob Gurr's]] window, for example, refers to his development of most vehicles at the park.

According to [[Marty Sklar]], "to add a name [on a window] today, there are three requirements: (1) Only on retirement. (2) Only the highest level of service/respect/achievement. (3) Agreement between top individual park management and [[Walt Disney Imagineering]], which creates the design and copy concepts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=SAMLAND |first= |title= Where's The Window?

Windows are listed in alphabetical order by last name.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20697">This is a '''list of IATA-indexed railway stations''', which are assigned codes by the [[International Air Transport Association|IATA]], similar to [[International Air Transport Association airport code|IATA airport codes]]. Such [[railway stations]] are typically used in [[air-rail alliance]]s or code sharing agreements (commonly known as "Rail Fly") between [[airlines]] and rail lines, particularly in Europe. By assigning railway stations an IATA code, passengers on trips involving those stations can be ticketed all the way. Sometimes they can get checked straight through to their final destination, without the bother of having to claim their baggage and check-in again when changing between the rail and air portions of a trip. At other places passengers have to carry their baggage on the train, but anyway need no separate train booking process.

==Railway station codes==
The IATA codes for railway stations normally begin with '''Q''', '''X''' or '''Z''', except when the station shares the code with an airport. For some smaller cities the railway station in the city has the same code as the airport outside the city (several kilometers distance). A connection involving transfer between them can appear when searching travel possibilities. A taxi ride, a train, or a bus transfer is usually needed then.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10538">[[File:2 digit postcode iceland.png|thumb|2-digit postal code areas in [[Iceland]] (defined through the first two postal code digits)]]
[[Postal code]]s in [[Iceland]] are made up of three digits. The codes are followed by the name of the place where the post is being distributed, which is either a [[municipality]], the nearest [[city]], [[town]] or [[village]]. The total number of postal codes is 149; with 18 reserved for [[post-office box]]es, two for [[Public sector|public]] institutes and larger [[Private sector|private]] companies and one used for international sorting purposes only.

==Terminology==
The following terms have a special meaning in the list of postal codes:

*''Mail carrier'': An individual who delivers mail in a postal code area where there is no dedicated post office.
*''Post vehicle'': A vehicle that operates at specific hours in a postal code area where there is no dedicated post office. Residents seek their mail and deliver their mail to the post vehicle.
*''Surface mail'': Mail is delivered to residents' houses in a postal code area where there is no dedicated post office.
*''Surface mail by sea'': Same as ''surface mail'', with the addition that mail has to be transported by sea as well.

'''Magellan Navigation, Inc.''' is an American producer of consumer and professional grade global positioning system receivers, named after [[Ferdinand Magellan]], the first explorer to [[circumnavigate]] the globe. Headquartered in [[San Dimas, California]], with European sales and engineering centers in [[Nantes]], [[France]] and [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], Magellan also produces aftermarket automotive [[GPS]] units, including the [[The Hertz Corporation#Hertz Neverlost|Hertz Neverlost]] system found in [[Hertz]] rental cars. The Maestro, RoadMate, Triton, and eXplorist lines are Magellan's current consumer offerings. The company also produces proprietary road maps (DirectRoute), [[topographic maps]] (Topo), and marine charts (BlueNav) for use with its consumer [[GPS receiver]]s.

== History ==
Magellan started as an independent company. It was once owned by [[Orbital Sciences Corporation]], which purchased it in 1994. In 2001, [[Thales Group]] purchased the Magellan division of Orbital Sciences for about $70 million and the Company became known as Thales Navigation. Five years later, private equity firm Shah Capital Partners and other investors purchased Thales Navigation for $170 million and the company was officially renamed Magellan Navigation.

Magellan was the creator of the Magellan NAV 1000—the world’s first commercial handheld GPS receiver,{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} which debuted in 1989. In 1997, Magellan also introduced the first handheld global satellite communicator—the GSC 100. Later consumer handheld products included the Magellan GPS 2000, GPS 315, Meridian, SporTrak, and Magellan RoadMate models. The MobileMapper CE and ProMark3 have been marketed to professionals like surveyors and GIS ([[geographic information systems]]) users.

The consumer division of Magellan was purchased by [[Mio Technology]] subsidiary of [[MiTAC]] on December 15, 2008, who changed the name to "MiTAC Digital Corporation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magellangps.com/news/releases/viewRelease.asp?id=611 Mio completes purchase of Magellan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722004648/http://www.magellangps.com/news/releases/viewRelease.asp?id=611 |date=2010-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consumer products ==
[[File:Magellan explorist 100.jpg|thumb|Magellan eXplorist 100 GPS]]

Magellan develops and distributes vehicle navigation, crossover GPS, and outdoor handheld navigation products. The Company also produces customized mapping software for topographic, marine, and street navigation.

Current GPS products as of 2016 include:
*The Magellan RoadMate and Magellan Maestro series of portable car navigation systems
*The Magellan CrossoverGPS for automobile and handheld navigation
*The Magellan eXplorist and Magellan Triton series of outdoor handheld navigation devices
*The Hertz NeverLost car navigation system
*The Magellan TRX Off-Road navigation systems

Magellan GPS units include a variety of different viewing options, including a 3D [[bird's-eye view]], a night view, and pop-up visuals of upcoming turns. Some models use [[SiRFstarIII]] for position accuracy within three meters, and voice and onscreen prompts that provide directions on how to drive to a particular destination. Certain Magellan vehicle navigation systems are also Bluetooth-compatible for integration with mobile phones, and traffic upgradeable for real-time traffic information. The Maestro 4050 is the first portable vehicle navigation device to offer drivers the convenience of voice command capabilities. The Company has a partnership with [[American Automobile Association|AAA]] that provides drivers with AAA TourBook guide travel information, AAA Member Roadside Assistance details, and AAA Show Your Card &amp; Save Member Discount locations on specific models.

== Maps ==
Magellan products currently use [[Navteq]] based maps. Map errors are handled by the Navteq Map Reporter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nn4d.com/site/global/build/map_reporter_api/about/p_about.jsp |accessdate=2010-10-09 |title=About Navteq Map Reporter |publisher=Navteq}}&lt;/ref&gt; Errors can be reported using the Navteq Map Reporter map feedback page.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://mapreporter.navteq.com/ |accessdate=2010-10-09 |title=Navteq Map Reporter |publisher=Navteq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PAN is involved in fighting problems caused by [[pesticide]] use, and advocates ecologically sound alternatives.  Branches include PAN North America, U. K., Germany, Mexico, Asia and Pacific, and Africa.

In November 2010, PAN publicized a leaked [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) memo that showed that the EPA suspected the crop spray [[clothianidin]], manufactured by German agrochemical company [[Bayer]], as a possible cause of bee [[colony collapse disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;

In December 2010, PAN North America joined with other organizations in suing California, to challenge "the state's approval of the cancer-causing strawberry pesticide [[methyl iodide]]."&lt;ref&gt;

==PAN Europe==

{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2014}} 
'''PAN Europe''' is the regional centre in Europe. It was founded in 1987 and brings together consumer, public health, and environmental organisations, trades unions, women's groups and farmer associations from across Europe.

In 2008 PAN Europe reported that it had found [[pesticide residues]] in [[wine]] bottles. The [[Federal Institute for Risk Assessment]] assessed their study and concluded that the concentrations were so low that it could not constitute a risk for consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.bfr.bund.de/cm/343/analysenergebnisse_durch_pan_europe.pdf|title = Analytical results of PAN Europe: BfR does not see any health risks from the pesticide residues detected in wine.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2231">'''Planimetrics''' is the study of [[plane (geometry)|plane]] measurements, including angles, distances, and areas.

==History==
To measure planimetrics a [[planimeter]] is used. This rather advanced analog technology is being taken over by simple [[image measurement]] software tools like, [[ImageJ]], [[Adobe Acrobat]], [[Google Earth Pro]], [[GIMP|Gimp]], [[Photoshop]] and [[KLONK Image Measurement]] which can help do this kind of work from digitalized images.

==In geography==
Planimetric elements in geography are those features that are independent of elevation, such as roads, building footprints, and rivers and lakes. They are represented on two-dimensional maps as they are seen from the air, or in aerial photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://coastal.lic.wisc.edu/plan-rpt/plan-rpt.htm#Plan_Chapter_1 |title=Planimetric and Topographic Mapping Report |author-last=Hart |author-first=David A. |date=July 1, 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These features are often digitized from [[orthorectified]] [[aerial photography]] into data layers that can be used in analysis and cartographic outputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1-last=Montgomery |author1-first=Glenn E. |author2-last=Schuch |author2-first=Harold C. |title=GIS Data Conversion Handbook |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc. |year=2007 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tOX0J3QnhqgC&amp;pg=PA97&amp;lpg=PA97&amp;dq=planimetry+geography&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NS3n_8IpkQ&amp;sig=_YQpHn0kKNbscNvI1ncKI5LFFQM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=my8tSozNHNGptgfR2_W8CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6#PPA97,M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''planimetric map'' is one that does not include [[Cartographic relief depiction|relief]] data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Committee on Nomenclature of the American Society of Photogrammetry |title=Definitions of terms used in photogrammetric surveying and mapping: preliminary report |journal=Photogrammetric Engineering |volume=8 |pages=247–283 |year=1942 |quote=Topographic Map. A map that presents the horizontal and vertical positions of the features represented; distinguished from a planimetric map by the addition of relief in measurable form. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of the European Union mini}}
A '''European political foundation''', formally a '''political foundation at European level''', informally a '''Eurofoundation''', is a [[Think tank|research and advocacy organization]] close to, but independent from a [[Europarty]]. They are funded by the [[European Parliament]]. Their purpose is to act as platforms aiming at developing forward-looking ideas and concepts for their respective political family and providing a forum where those ideas can be widely debated. There are nine Eurofoundations as of 16 March 2009.

==Timeline==

===2003===
Regulation (EC) No 2004/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 November 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003R2004:EN:HTML|title=EUR-Lex - 32003R2004 - EN|publisher=|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; defined what a Europarty, or ''[[Europarty|political party at European level]]'', was and tightened up their regulation.

===2007===
That regulation was later heavily amended by Regulation (EC) No 1524/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2007:343:0005:01:EN:HTML Regulation (EC) No 1524/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2007].&lt;/ref&gt; That amendment provided for the earlier-floated&lt;ref&gt;[http://euobserver.com/9/24148 EU in drive to make Brussels more political] euobserver.com 29 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; concept of a [[Eurofoundation|political foundation at European level]], a legally separate affiliate to an [[Europarty]] created to help them disseminate their principles to a wider audience.

==Regulations==
As of 1 November 2008, the regulation governing Eurofoundations is Regulation (EC) No 2004/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 November 2003,&lt;ref name="SCADl33315"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/lvb/l33315.htm|title=EUROPA|publisher=|accessdate=26 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303200326/http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/lvb/l33315.htm|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; as later amended&lt;ref name="PreLex195908"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/prelex/detail_dossier_real.cfm?CL=en&amp;DosId=195908|title=EUR-Lex - 2007_130 - EN - EUR-Lex|publisher=|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; under codecision (see above).

==Funding==
Their total allocated funding for 2008 is €5,000,000.&lt;ref name="IP071953"&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/07/1953&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en Press Release IP/07/1953], Brussels, 18 December 2007 europa.eu&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Eurofoundations==
Ten pilot Eurofoundations were set up in 2007/8, nine of which are still in existence as of 16 March 2009. They are as follows:

==Proposed Eurofoundations==
It was reported on 1 November 2008 that [[Declan Ganley]] had registered a company in [[Dublin]] called the ''Libertas Foundation Ltd''&lt;ref name="IT1225321623322"&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2008/1101/1225321623322.html "Ganley registers Libertas as a European political party"] ''Irish Times'', 1 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and that it was intended "to act as a European Political Foundation for the Libertas Party".&lt;ref name="IT1225321623322"/&gt; Ganley attempted to get EU recognition and funding of €111,000 for the ''Libertas Foundation'' in February 2009,&lt;ref name="EV63837"&gt;[http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/imported/parliament-says-yes-then-no-to-funding-for-libertas/63837.aspx "Parliament says 'Yes' then 'No' to funding for Libertas"], European Voice, 5 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; but the attempt was rejected&lt;ref name="EV63837"/&gt; because its board members were all from one member state&lt;ref name="EV63837"/&gt; and the foundation name was the same as the aspirant Europarty&lt;ref name="EV63837"/&gt; also founded by Ganley. The same meeting of the [[Bureau (European Parliament)|Bureau of the European Parliament]] that rejected the Libertas foundation but (momentarily) recognised the Libertas party also defunded the ''Alliance of Independent Democrats in Europe'' (AIDE).&lt;ref name="EV63837"/&gt;

The foundation affiliated to the newly created [[Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists]] is [[New Direction (think tank)|New Direction]].

The '''race to the bottom''' is a [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]] phrase which is used to describe government [[deregulation]] of the business environment, or reduction in tax rates, in order to attract or retain economic activity in their jurisdictions. An outcome of [[globalization]] and [[free trade]], the phenomenon may occur when competition increases between geographic areas over a particular sector of trade and production.&lt;ref name="Economist 2013"&gt;{{cite news|author1=C.W.|title=Racing to the bottom |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/11/labour-standards |accessdate=15 March 2016|work=[[The Economist]] |date=27 November 2013 |quote=But the race to the bottom operates more subtly than most people suppose. The regressions suggest that while countries do compete with each other by instituting laws that are unfriendly to workers, such competition is not that pronounced. The real problem is that countries compete by enforcing labour laws less vigorously than they might—leading to increases in violations of labour rights prescribed in local laws. Competition between countries to attract investment is less in rules than in their practical application.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal effect and intent of these actions is to make labor rates "more competitive" (i.e. lower), the principal cost of business, together with other factors (pensions, environmental protection and other [[externalities]]),  and thus the metaphor where the bottom is the lowest wage that can be paid for that labor.

==History and usage==
The concept of a regulatory "race to the bottom" emerged in the United States during the late 19th and early 20th century, when there was charter competition among states to attract corporations to domicile in their jurisdiction. Some described the concept as the "race to efficiency", and others, such as Justice [[Louis Brandeis]], as the "race to the bottom".&lt;ref name = "coined" /&gt;

In the late 19th century, [[joint-stock company]] control was being liberalised in Europe, where countries were engaged in competitive liberal legislation to allow local companies to compete. This liberalization reached Spain in 1869, Germany in 1870, Belgium in 1873, and Italy in 1883. In 1890, [[New Jersey]] enacted a liberal corporation charter, which charged low fees for company registration and lower [[franchise tax]]es than other states.

In academic literature, the phenomenon of regulatory competition reducing standards overall was argued for by A.A. Berle and G.C. Means in ''[[The Modern Corporation and Private Property]]'' (1932), while the concept received formal recognition by the [[US Supreme Court]] in a decision of Justice [[Louis Brandeis]] in the 1933 case ''[[Ligget Co. v. Lee]]'' (288 U.S. 517, 558–559).&lt;ref name = "coined"&gt;{{cite book| last =Meisel| first =Nicolas| authorlink =| coauthors =| year =2004| title =Governance Culture and Development: A Different Perspective on Corporate Governance | publisher =Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development| location =| isbn = 92-64-01727-5 }} p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "ind"&gt;{{cite book| last =Kelly| first =John E.| authorlink =| coauthors =| year =2002| title =Industrial Relations: critical perspectives on business and management | publisher =Routledge| location =UK| isbn = 0-415-22986-3 }} p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "sch"&gt;{{cite book| last =Schram| first =Sanford F.| authorlink =| coauthors =| year =2000| title =After Welfare: The Culture of Postindustrial Social Policy | publisher =NYU Press| location =| isbn = 0-8147-9755-5 }} p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

Brandeis's "race to the bottom" metaphor was updated in 1974 by [[William L. Cary|William Cary]], in an article in the [[Yale Law Journal]], "Federalism and Corporate Law: Reflections Upon Delaware," in which Carey argued for the imposition of national standards for [[corporate governance]].

Sanford F. Schram explained in 2000 that the term "race to the bottom":

{{cquote|...has for some time served as an important metaphor to illustrate that the United States federal system—and every federal system for that matter—is vulnerable to interstate competition. The "race to the bottom" implies that the states compete with each other as each tries to underbid the others in lowering taxes, spending, regulation...so as to make itself more attractive to outside financial interests or unattractive to unwanted outsiders. It can be opposed to the alternative metaphor of "[[Laboratories of democracy|Laboratories of Democracy]]". The laboratory metaphor implies a more sanguine federalism in which [states] use their authority and discretion to develop innovative and creative solutions to common problems which can be then adopted by other states.&lt;ref name = "sch" /&gt;}}

The term has also been used to describe a similar type of competition between corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.popularresistance.org/walmart-creates-a-race-to-the-bottom-throughout-the-supplyline/ |work=Popular Resistance |author=Charles Fishman |date=November 27, 2013 |title=Walmart Creates A Race To The Bottom Throughout The Economy}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/24/taskrabbit-uber-economy_n_6538540.html |work=Huffington Post |author=Alexis Kleinman |date=Jan 24, 2015 |title=How The Uber Economy Can Become A Race To The Bottom}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, in response to reports that British supermarkets had cut the price of [[banana]]s, and by implication had squeezed revenues of banana-growing developing nations, Alistair Smith, international co-coordinator of Banana Link, said "The British supermarkets are leading a race to the bottom. Jobs are being lost and producers are having to pay less attention to social and environmental agreements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=N/A |newspaper=[[The Times]] |department=Business Section |date=7 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Another example is the cruise industry, which registers its ship with flags of convenience, circumventing wage requirements, and other expenses required by developed countries, thus providing the business model for the industry.&lt;ref name="Cruise Ships"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Elizabeth Becker|title=Destination Nowhere: The Dark Side of the Cruise Industry|url=http://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2014/04/17/health-and-family/travel/the-dark-side-of-the-cruise-ship-industry.html|accessdate=15 March 2016 |work=The Saturday Evening Post |date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has also been used in the context of a trend for some European states to seize refugees' assets.&lt;ref name="Newsweek Refugees"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Josh Lowe|title=U.N. Slams 'Race To The Bottom' On Refugee Cash |url=http://www.newsweek.com/un-slams-race-bottom-refugee-cash-denmark-germany-switzerland-418278 |accessdate=15 March 2016| work=Newsweek |date=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental policy ==
The race to the bottom has been a tactic widely used among states within the United States of America. The race to the bottom in environmental policy involves both scaling back policies already in place and passing new policies that encourage less environmentally friendly behavior. Some states use this as an economic development strategy, especially in times of financial hardship.  For example, in Wisconsin, Governor Scott Walker decreased state environmental staff’s capacity in order to accelerate the approval time for a proposed development.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Environmental policy : new directions for the twenty-first century |last1=Vig |first1=Norman J. |last2=Kraft |first2=Michael E. |isbn=9781506383460 |edition=10th |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |publisher=CQ Press, an imprint of SAGE Publications, Inc. |year=2019 |oclc=1005057455}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pursuing a race to the bottom philosophy in environmental politics allows states to foster economic growth, but has great consequences for the environment of that state. Conversely, some states have begun to pursue a race to the top strategy, which stresses innovative environmental policies at the state level, with the hopes that these policies will later be adopted by other states.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When a state pursues either a race to the bottom or a race to the top strategy, it speaks to its overall environmental agenda.

'''Research stations in Queen Maud Land''' are connected by the Dronning Maud Land Air Network Project ([[DROMLAN]]), which is a cooperative agreement for transportation between eleven nations with research stations in East Antarctica.

==SANAE IV==
{{main article|SANAE IV}}
[[File:SANAE IV from above the northern buttress.jpg|thumb|left|alt2=Photograph of a base near the edge of a barren cliff, surrounded by snow|The [[SANAE IV]] station]]

South Africa's SANAE IV station, the successor to three former stations, was completed in 1997. Research at SANAE IV include [[Invasion biology terminology|invasion biology]]/[[ecology]], geology, [[geomorphology]] and [[atmospheric sciences]]. Its facilities include a small hospital and a two-helicopter hangar.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, 2008, pp. 304–305.&lt;/ref&gt; SANAE IV consists of three linked modules, each double-story, {{convert|44|m|ft}} long and {{convert|14|m|ft}} wide.  Two smaller nearby structures contain the [[satellite dish]] used for communications and the diesel fuel bunkers.  Joined end-on-end in a north-south orientation, the base modules are complemented on the northern end by a large raised helicopter landing area with a lifting section allowing vehicles to be brought up into the hangar for maintenance. C-block, the northern-most module, contains the  [[neutron monitor]]s of the [[North-West University]].&lt;ref name="puk-neutron"&gt;{{cite web|title=Unit for Space Physics: Neutron Monitor Data|url=http://www.puk.ac.za/fakulteite/natuur/nm_data/|publisher=[[North-West University]]|accessdate=2 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modules are linked by single-story connections that also serve as entrances with stairways down to the surface 4m below the base.  Each link contains an entrance hall with two sets of doors (creating a rudimentary 'air-lock' to prevent excessive cooling when entering and exiting the base) as well as a change-room, ablution facility and electronic distribution boards. The base is staffed and maintained year-round by a team of scientists and support personnel.  Each overwintering team arrives during the summer expedition and take-over period aboard the research and logistics vessel ''[[S. A. Agulhas II]]'', stays at the base through the austral winter and returns to South Africa at the end of the next summer season - an expedition of approximately 16 months.

==Nordenskiöld Base==

{{main article|Wasa (research station)|Aboa (research station)}}

The Swedish [[Wasa (research station)|Wasa]] station and the Finnish [[Aboa (research station)|Aboa]] station together make up the [[Nordenskiöld Base]], and cooperate in research and logistics. Research carried out includes geodesy/mapping, glaciology, human biology, meteorological observations, geology and geophysics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.polarconservation.org/education/antarctic-bases/finland-and-antarctica/stations-bases-camps-and-refuges/aboa |publisher=[[Polar Conservation Organisation]] |title=Aboa |accessdate=21 August 2011 |first=Kris |last=Molle |date=2 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neumayer-Station III==
The German [[Neumayer-Station III]], finished in 2009, succeeded two former stations that were buried by snow and ice.&lt;ref name=r304&gt;Rubin, 2008, p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; It conducts geophysical, meteorological and seismological research, as well as air chemistry measurements and atmospheric ozone monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.polarconservation.org/education/antarctic-bases/germany-and-antarctica/stations-bases-camps-and-refuges/neumayer |publisher=[[Polar Conservation Organisation]] |title=Neumayer |accessdate=21 August 2011 |first=Kris |last=Molle |date=2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany's other station, [[Kohnen]], was opened as part of a major ice-drilling project.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, 2003, p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is named after geophysicist [[Georg von Neumayer]]. The station's assembly kit was transported to its current position early in November 2007. It is moving with the shelf ice at about 200 meters per year towards the open sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.badische-zeitung.de/bildung-wissen-1/auf-stelzen-im-eis--11481179.html |title=Auf Stelzen im Eis |date=February 14, 2009 |first=Michael |last=Heilemann |work=[[Badische Zeitung]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; After almost ten years of work on the project, beginning in October 1999, including conception, [[environmental impact assessment]], planning and construction phases, regular operation of the station began on 20 February 2009. The station replaces the [[Neumayer-Station II]] and the Georg-von-Neumayer-Station that preceded it. The expected lifespan of the station is 25 to 30 years and the entire project is estimated to cost [[Euro|€]]39 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=https://www.welt.de/wissenschaft/article3233166/Deutschlands-neuer-High-Tech-Bau-in-der-Antarktis.html |newspaper=[[Die Welt]] |title=Deutschlands neuer High-Tech-Bau in der Antarktis |date=February 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Princess Elisabeth Antarctica==
{{main article|Princess Elisabeth Antarctica}}
[[File:Antarctica.belgian station1010034.jpg|thumb|right|alt4=Photo of the inside of a research station|[[Princess Elisabeth Antarctica|Princess Elisabeth Base]].]]

Princess Elisabeth Antarctica was established by Belgium as a project to promote polar sciences, as well as to demonstrate the possibility of building a [[Zero emission]] station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.antarcticstation.org/station/ |publisher=Princess Elisabeth Antarctica |title=Princess Elisabeth Antarctica |accessdate=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research is conducted by an international team of scientists, studying climatology, glaciology and [[microbiology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.polarconservation.org/education/antarctic-bases/belgium-and-antarctica/stations-bases-camps-and-refuges/princess-elisabeth-base |publisher=[[Polar Conservation Organisation]] |title=Princess Elisabeth |accessdate=21 August 2011 |date=2 November 2010 |first=Kris |last=Molle}}&lt;/ref&gt; It went into service on February 15, 2009. The station, designed, built and operated by the [[International Polar Foundation]], is the first polar base that combines eco-friendly construction materials, clean and [[efficient energy use]], optimization of the station's energy consumption and clever waste management techniques through the use of a micro [[smart grid]]. The station is connected to nine [[wind turbine]]s that stretch out along the Utsteinen ridge. It houses up to 16 scientists at a time. 
 
The station is built against a ridge (The Utsteinen ridge) that is exposed to gales of up to {{Convert|300|km/h|mph}}. The station can withstand such strong winds through its aerodynamic shape and its foundation anchoring of several metres deep into the [[permafrost]]. [[Philippe Samyn]], a Belgian architect, was involved in designing the shell and underlying structure. The upper deck of the building is the actual station and looks over the ridge edge. The lower deck contains a garage for [[snowcat]] vehicles and other utilities. The station is named after [[Princess Elisabeth, Duchess of Brabant|Elisabeth, Duchess of Brabant]], Princess of [[Belgium]], the eldest daughter and heiress apparent of [[Philippe of Belgium|Philippe, King of the Belgians]].

==Kohnen Station==
{{main article|Kohnen Station}}
[[File:KohnenStation.JPG|thumb|alt1=Image of an outpost surrounded by snow|[[Kohnen Station|Kohnen]] station.]]

Kohnen-Station is a German summer-only station, able to accommodate up to 20 people. It is named after the geophysicist [[Heinz Kohnen]] (1938–1997), who was for a long time the head of logistics at the [[Alfred Wegener Institute]]. The station opened in 2001,  and is the logistic base for the ice coring project in [[Dronning Maud Land]], the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica ([[EPICA]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esf.org/activities/research-networking-programmes/life-earth-and-environmental-sciences-lesc/completed-esf-research-networking-programmes-in-life-earth-and-environmental-sciences/european-project-for-ice-coring-in-antarctica-epica-page-1/more-information.html|title=European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica (EPICA)|author=Thomas Stocker|publisher=[[European Science Foundation]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120612175043/http://www.esf.org/activities/research-networking-programmes/life-earth-and-environmental-sciences-lesc/completed-esf-research-networking-programmes-in-life-earth-and-environmental-sciences/european-project-for-ice-coring-in-antarctica-epica-page-1/more-information.html|archivedate=June 12, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The station is supplied by a convoy of 6 towing vehicles, which resupply it twice a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Drilling into the past - The Kohnen Station in the Antarctic|url=http://www.awi.de/en/infrastructure/stations/kohnen_station|publisher=Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research (AWI)|accessdate=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sombrero''', also known as '''Hat Island''', is part of the [[British overseas territory]] of [[Anguilla]] and is the northernmost island of the [[Lesser Antilles]]. It lies {{convert|54|km|mi|abbr=on}} north-west of Anguilla across the Dog and Prickly Pear Passage. The distance to [[Dog Island, Anguilla|Dog Island]], the next nearest island of Anguilla, is {{convert|38|km|mi|abbr=off}}.

Sombrero is {{convert|1.67|km|yd|2|abbr=off}} long north-south, and {{convert|0.38|km|yd|2|abbr=on}} wide. The land area is {{convert|0.38|km2|acre|2|abbr=on}}. Originally, when viewed from the sea, the island had the shape of a [[Sombrero|sombrero hat]] but [[guano]] mining operations have left the island with precipitous sides and a relatively flat top that is {{convert|12|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[above sea level]]. The surface of the island is rough, and vegetation is sparse.

The guano-mining operation yielded some 3000 [[ton]]s of phosphate a year by 1870. By 1890, the phosphate reserves had been exhausted.

The [[lighthouse]] marks the [[Anegada Passage]], which is the route from Europe into the Caribbean. The first lighthouse was erected in 1868. In 1960, [[Hurricane Donna]] damaged this lighthouse, with the result that a new lighthouse replaced it in 1962. The lighthouses were manned from 1868 to 2001. In that year, [[Trinity House]] donated and installed the current, automated tower, which is a {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} round tower, painted white. Anguilla's Department of Fisheries and Marine Resources is responsible for the maintenance of the navigational aids.

==History==
[[File:Sombrero map.jpg|thumb|left|Plan of Sombrero in about 1880 showing mining operations]]
As a result of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1714, Sombrero passed into the hands of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]]. Captain [[Viscount Lake|Warwick Lake]] of [[HMS Recruit (1806)|''Recruit'']] [[marooning|marooned]] an impressed seaman, Robert Jeffrey, there on 13 December 1807. As it turned out, Jeffrey survived. A passing American vessel, the schooner ''Adams'' from [[Marblehead, Massachusetts]], had rescued him. Still, a [[court martial]] dismissed Lake from the Royal Navy.

In 1814, and again in 1825, a British [[Geology|geologist]] surveyed the island and found that it abounded in [[guano]] and reported this to the British government.

In 1856 the Americans claimed the island, and in a very short period of time quarried 100,000 tons of [[phosphate]] that served as fertilizer for the exhausted lands of the [[Southern United States|Southern States]]. Uniquely, an important insurrection occurred when West Indian black workers revolted against the “slavery proclivities” of a white American superintendent vis-à-vis wage-earning free men. Four of the 200 workers "fatally injured" Superintendent Snow and commandeered the island and company money and stores.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', 13 August 1860: “Negro Insurrection on a Guano Island”.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British later intervened and demanded compensation from the United States for the occupation. The conflicting claims to the island were settled in Britain's favour in 1867.

Sombrero, lying in the route of shipping from England to [[South-America|South]] and [[Central America]], lay in an area with many hazards and in 1848 the [[Admiralty]] was asked to install a light on it. On 30 June 1859, the [[Royal Mail Steam Packet Company]]'s ship ''Paramatta'' was wrecked on her maiden voyage on [[Anegada Island#Horseshoe Reef|Horseshoe Reef]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Illustrated London News'', Vol. 47, no. 1323, p. 17-18.&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in another request to the Admiralty. The [[lighthouse]] was then built and first exhibited its light on the evening of 1 January 1868.

Ironically, ''Paramatta'' and the Lighthouse built following her demise were both constructed by the same shipyard, the [[Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company]], on the banks of the River Lea in Blackwall, London. ''Paramatta'' was the last ship launched from their Middlesex bank, while the lighthouse was built on the Essex side, the yard occupying premises on either side of the river.&lt;ref&gt;Thames Iron Works Historical Catalogue: Souvenir prepared for the Festival of Empire, Crystal Palace 1911, p.42 and p.111&lt;/ref&gt; In 1871, the lease of the island was sold for £55,000 and then sold again for £110,000 to the New Sombrero Phosphate Company, which led to litigation in ''[[Erlanger v. New Sombrero Phosphate Co]]'' (1878) 3 App Cas 1218.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Len Sealy  |author2=Sarah Worthington |lastauthoramp=yes | title = Cases and Materials in Company Law | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2008 | location = Oxford | pages = 81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sombrero light1.jpg|thumb|left|The superintendent of Sombrero's house in about 1880]]

From the early 1870s until 1885, a [[Cornwall|Cornish]] mining engineer, Thomas Corfield, was [[Management|Superintendent]] of Sombrero. His duties included organizing the conveying of the guano to a spot which was convenient for loading the [[lighter (barge)|lighters]] to take the guano to the ships lying off the island, overseeing the construction of [[derrick]]s and engine houses, and arranging for the laying of the [[tram]] lines for the wagons, which were loaded at the quarries. The guano was just piled in dumps near the engine houses and derricks. There was no semblance of a [[port]] and no beach.

The black workers were recruited from various islands and lived in wooden huts during their term of service. Stores and various supplies were obtained from a merchant at [[Philipsburg, Sint Maarten|Philipsburg]], [[Sint Maarten]], a Mr Nesbit. The company's [[schooner]] ''Logos'' brought supplies and also took the black labourers to and from their homes on the other islands.

The superintendent's house was a wooden [[bungalow]] near the middle of the island, and around it were grouped the quarters of the technicians, store keepers, and lighthouse keepers, and other wooden buildings. On the side opposite to the main buildings was a small building for the superintendent. There was a wide [[veranda]] round the house and he used to live there with his family, except near the [[Atlantic hurricane season|hurricane season]].&lt;ref&gt;Notes by Thomas Joseph Corfield - Made July 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1890, the phosphate works on the island were abandoned and by 1893 the lighthouse had come under the authority of the [[Board of trade|British Board of Trade]], later the [[Department for Transport|Department of Transport]]. Administration of the light was carried out by [[Trinity House]]. In 1931, the old light system was changed and improved to 200,000 candle power and the tower received its first major repair when the basement was encased in concrete.

On 20 July 1962, after the destruction caused by [[Hurricane Donna]] in 1960, the present lighthouse was put into operation and the old tower demolished on 28 July 1962.&lt;ref&gt;A Visit to Sombrero by P. Bannis, Government Information Service Bulletin Vol I, No 2, July 1978, which quoted from the writings of Mr. William Hodge in the Sombrero Visitors' Book&lt;/ref&gt;  The lighthouse is located near the centre of the island, and reaches a height of almost {{convert|166|ft|m}} above sea level. It protects ships passing from the Atlantic Ocean to the Caribbean Sea through the [[Anegada Passage]]. Full responsibility for the light passed from Trinity House to the Anguillan government on 1 December 2001.&lt;ref name="Lords 2005"&gt;Written Answers - House of Lords:Anguilla:Sombero Island Lighthouse (21 February 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population==
Until recently the only inhabitants were the staff of the [[lighthouse]] but the light was automated in 2002 and now the island is uninhabited. The only visitors are the occasional fishermen, biologists engaged in fieldwork, and the occasional scuba group visiting the island for its interesting dive sites and post-apocalyptic surface.

==Wildlife==
The island is noted for the endemic [[Sombrero ameiva]], a widespread and easily seen lizard species on the island. A recently discovered dwarf gecko, ''[[Sphaerodactylus]]'', may be endemic and has been tentatively named the Sombrero dwarf gecko. The [[Anguilla Bank anole]] also inhabits the island. This island also has a unique [[Lasioglossum]] bee.&lt;ref name="Engel 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Engel|first1=Engel|title=A New Species of Dialictus from Sombrero Island, Anguilla (Hymenoptera, Halictidae)|journal=Zookeys|date=2011|volume=86|page=61|doi=10.3897/zookeys.86.909|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.86.909|accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The surrounding waters are feeding areas for [[hawksbill turtle]]s. During the late [[Pleistocene]], the island was inhabited by a now-extinct giant tortoise, ''[[Chelonoidis]] sombrerensis''.&lt;ref name="Hansen"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Hansen | first = D.

{{Politics of Russia}}

[[Russia]] is divided into several '''types and levels of subdivisions'''.

==Federal subjects==
{{Main|Federal subjects of Russia}}

[[File:Russian Regions-EN.svg|thumb|300px|Federal subjects of Russia prior to the addition of the [[Republic of Crimea]] and the [[federal city]] of [[Sevastopol]] in 2014]]

Since March&amp;nbsp;18, 2014, the [[Russian Federation]] consisted of eighty-five federal subjects that are constituent members of the Federation.&lt;ref name="Constitution65"&gt;Constitution, Article&amp;nbsp;65&lt;/ref&gt; However, two of these federal subjects—the [[Republic of Crimea]] and the [[federal cities of Russia|federal city]] of [[Sevastopol]]—are internationally recognized as part of [[Ukraine]]. All federal subjects are of equal federal rights in the sense that they have equal representation—two delegates each—in the [[Federation Council of Russia|Federation Council]] ([[upper house]] of the [[Federal Assembly of Russia|Federal Assembly]]). They do, however, differ in the degree of [[autonomous area|autonomy]] they enjoy.

There are 6&amp;nbsp;types of federal subjects—22&amp;nbsp;[[republics of Russia|republics]], 9&amp;nbsp;[[krais of Russia|krais]], 46&amp;nbsp;[[oblasts of Russia|oblasts]], 3&amp;nbsp;[[federal cities of Russia|federal cities]], 1&amp;nbsp;[[autonomous oblasts of Russia|autonomous oblast]], and 4&amp;nbsp;[[autonomous okrugs of Russia|autonomous okrugs]].

Autonomous okrugs are the only ones that have a peculiar status of being federal subjects in their own right, yet at the same time they are considered to be administrative divisions of other federal subjects (with [[Chukotka Autonomous Okrug]] being the only exception).

===2014 Annexation of Crimea===
On March&amp;nbsp;18, 2014, as a part of the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation of Crimea]] and following the establishment of the [[Republic of Crimea (country)|Republic of Crimea]] (an independent entity recognized only by Russia), a treaty was signed between Russia and the Republic of Crimea incorporating the Republic of Crimea and the City of [[Sevastopol]] as the constituent members of the Russian Federation.&lt;ref name="Treaty"&gt;Kremlin.ru. [http://kremlin.ru/news/20605 "Договор между Российской Федерацией и Республикой Крым о принятии в Российскую Федерацию Республики Крым и образовании в составе Российской Федерации новых субъектов"] ("Treaty Between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Crimea on Ascension to the Russian Federation of the Republic of Crimea and on Establishment of New Subjects Within the Russian Federation") {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Treaty, the Republic of Crimea is accepted as a federal subject with the status of a [[republics of Russia|republic]] while the City of Sevastopol has received [[federal cities of Russia|federal city]] status.&lt;ref name="Treaty" /&gt; Neither the Republic of Crimea nor the city of Sevastopol are politically recognized as parts of Russia by most countries.&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/18/us-ukraine-crisis-idUSBREA1Q1E820140318 "Putin signs Crimea treaty, will not seize other Ukraine regions"], Reuters, 18 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administrative divisions==
Prior to the adoption of the 1993 [[Constitution of Russia]], the administrative-territorial structure of Russia was regulated by the Decree of the Presidium of the [[Supreme Soviet of Russia|Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR]] of August&amp;nbsp;17, 1982 "On the Procedures of Dealing with the Matters of the Administrative-Territorial Structure of the RSFSR".&lt;ref name="ConstLawDict"&gt;"Энциклопедический словарь конституционного права". Статья "Административно-территориальное устройство". Сост. А.&amp;nbsp;А.&amp;nbsp;Избранов. — Мн.: Изд. В.М. Суров, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1993 Constitution, however, did not identify the matters of the administrative-territorial divisions as the responsibility of the federal government nor as the joint responsibility of the federal government and the subjects. This was interpreted by the governments of the federal subjects as a sign that the matters of the administrative-territorial divisions became solely the responsibility of the federal subjects.&lt;ref name="ConstLawDict" /&gt; As a result, the modern administrative-territorial structures of the federal subjects vary significantly from one federal subject to another. While the implementation details may be considerably different, in general, however, the following types of high-level administrative divisions are recognized:
*administrative districts ([[raion]]s)
*[[city of federal subject significance|cities/towns]] and [[urban-type settlement#Administrative divisions|urban-type settlements]] of federal subject significance
*[[closed city#Russia|closed administrative-territorial formations]]

[[Autonomous okrugs of Russia|Autonomous okrugs]] and [[okrug#Russian Federation|okrugs]] are intermediary units of administrative divisions, which include some of the federal subject's districts and cities/towns/urban-type settlements of federal subject significance.
*Autonomous okrugs, while being under the jurisdiction of another federal subject, are still constitutionally recognized as federal subjects on their own right. [[Chukotka Autonomous Okrug]] is an exception in that it is not administratively subordinated to any other federal subject of Russia.
*Okrugs are usually former autonomous okrugs that lost their federal subject status due to a merger with another federal subject.

Typical lower-level administrative divisions include:
*[[selsoviet]]s (rural councils)
*[[town of district significance|towns and urban-type settlements of the administrative district significance]]
*city districts

{{Administrative divisions of the federal subjects of Russia|state=collapsed}}

==Municipal divisions==
{{Main|Municipal divisions of Russia}}

In the course of the Russian municipal reform of 2004–2005, all federal subjects of Russia were to streamline the structures of local self-government, which is guaranteed by the [[Constitution of Russia]]. The reform mandated that each federal subject was to have a unified structure of the municipal government bodies by January&amp;nbsp;1, 2005, and a law enforcing the reform provisions went in effect on January&amp;nbsp;1, 2006. According to the law, the units of the municipal division (called "'''municipal formations'''") are as follows:&lt;ref name="Mun"&gt;{{cite Russian law

The '''[[Venezuelan protests (2014–present)|2016 Venezuelan protests]]''' began in early January following controversy surrounding the [[Venezuelan parliamentary election, 2015|2015 Venezuelan parliamentary elections]] and the increasing hardships felt by Venezuelans.&lt;ref name="1000protests"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cawthorne|first1=Andrew|title=Small protests proliferate in simmering Venezuela|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-venezuela-politics-protests-idUKKCN0WJ1CG|accessdate=3 April 2016|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Timeline of the 2014 Venezuelan protests|The series of protests originally began in February 2014]] when hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans protested due to high levels of criminal violence, inflation, and chronic scarcity of basic goods because of policies created the [[Venezuelan government]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lopez|first=Linette|title=Why The United States Has Done Nothing About Venezuela|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/why-the-us-wont-touch-venezuela-2014-4|accessdate=12 April 2014|newspaper=Business Insider|date=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Protesters in Venezuela Press Government|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304834704579401612202743396|accessdate=12 April 2014|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=23 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Venezuelans protest en masse in rival rallies|url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2014/02/24/venezuelans-protest-en-masse-in-rival-rallies/|accessdate=12 April 2014|newspaper=Borneo Post|date=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= Venezuela's Maduro says 2013 annual inflation was 56.2 pct|url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/30/venezuela-inflation-annual-idUSL2N0K90V020131230 |accessdate= 19 January 2014|newspaper= Reuters|date= 30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Venezuela Inflation Hits 16-Year High as Shortages Rise|url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-07/venezuela-inflation-hits-16-year-high-as-shortages-rise.html |accessdate=16 February 2014|newspaper= Bloomberg|date= 7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the size of protests had decreased since 2014.

In the first two months of 2016, over 1,000 protests and dozens of [[looting]] incidents were recorded throughout Venezuela.&lt;ref name="1000protests"/&gt; Much of the looting occurred due to [[shortages in Venezuela]] with Venezuelans forced to stand in the sun for hours while waiting in line for scarce products.&lt;ref name="1000protests"/&gt; By September, Venezuela saw some of its largest protests in the country's history with over one million demonstrating on 1 September 2016 and 26 October 2016. Into November, protests ceased due to the Vatican-backed dialogue between the opposition and the Bolivarian government, though the talks began to fall apart by the end of December. The protests are listed below according to the month they had happened.

The '''Turpan Depression''', or '''Turfan Depression''', is a [[fault (geology)|fault]]-bounded trough located around and south of the city-[[oasis]] of [[Turpan]], in the [[Xinjiang]] Autonomous Region in far [[western China]], about {{convert|150|km}} southeast of the regional capital [[Ürümqi]]. It includes [[Lake Ayding]], {{convert|−154|m|0}}, the [[List of places on land with elevations below sea level|second or third lowest]] [[Depression (geology)|depression]] on [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;
After the [[Jordan valley]] (−430 m), and equal to the [[Afar Depression]] within the accuracy of reported measurements (−155 m to −153 m).

By some measures, it is also the hottest and driest area in China during the summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.shanghaidaily.com/sp/article/2010/201004/20100405/article_433203.htm|publisher=Shanghai Daily|title=If you can stand the heat, then the Turpan Basin is the place to be|date=4-5-2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407094332/http://www.shanghaidaily.com/sp/article/2010/201004/20100405/article_433203.htm|archivedate=April 7, 2010|df=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology and relief==
The Turpan Basin is a fault-bounded trough located in the eastern part of the [[Tian Shan]]. It covers an area of {{convert|50000|km2}}. The surrounding mountain ranges are: the central Tian Shan in the west, the [[Bogda Shan]] in the north-west, the [[Haerlike Shan]] in the north-west, and the [[Jueluotage Shan]] in the south. Beyond the surrounding mountain ranges lie the [[Dzungaria|Junggar Basin]] in the north and the [[Tarim Basin]] in the south.

Some geographers also use the term [[Turpan-Hami Basin]], which is understood as including the Turpan Depression along with the Hami Depression (located to the east of the Turpan Depression, and to the southwest of the city of [[Hami City|Hami]]) and the Liaodong Uplift separating the two depressions. A source using this terminology gave the area of the Turpan Depression proper as {{convert|28600|km2|abbr=on}}, that of the Hami Depression as {{convert|19300|km2|abbr=on}}, and for the entire Turpan-Hami Basin, as {{convert|48000|km2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=uranium&gt;{{citation
|first=Franz J.|last=Dahlkamp |isbn=978-3-540-78557-6 |title=Uranium Deposits of the World: Asia |publisher= Springer
|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ShzwRGs5mDYC&amp;pg=PA40 |pages=40–41 |date=2009-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Turpan-flaming-mountains-camellos-d01.jpg|thumb|250px|Basin scene near [[Flaming Mountains]]]]

The Turpan Basin formed in a [[shear zone]] during the [[Permian|Late Permian]] due to motion between the East European and the Angaran [[craton]]. It was subsequently deformed by the collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates in the [[Cenozoic]]. In the latter deformation, a thrust fault belt running from east to west, the [[Flaming Mountains]], was formed in the center of the basin. The Flaming Mountains are {{convert|98|km|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|9|km|abbr=on}} wide; the highest peak reaches an elevation of {{convert|831.7|m|abbr=on}} above sea level. The [[Turfan volcano]] is located near Turpan.

Also in the center of the basin lies the [[Ayding Lake]] (Moonlight Lake) which has an elevation of {{convert|154.5|m|abbr=on}} below sea level, the [[List of elevation extremes by country|sixth lowest exposed elevation on the Earth's land surface]]. It is the lowest surface point in China.

The Shihongtan [[uranium]] ore deposit is located at the southwestern margin of the Turpan Depression, some {{convert|35|km|abbr=on}} south-southwest from Turpan City.&lt;ref name=uranium/&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Turpan-gaochang-d12.jpg|thumb|250px|Ruins of Gaochang]]
The ancient city of [[Gaochang]] was a key point on the ancient [[Silk Road]] and dates back to the 1st century BC. It was burnt down in wars in the 14th century. The [[Bezeklik Thousand Buddha Caves]], which are located in the [[Flaming Mountains]]' [[Mutou Valley]], about {{convert|30|km|abbr=on}} east of the city of Turpan, have been hewn into the rock from the [[Tang dynasty]] era up to the time of the [[Yuan dynasty]] (13th century). The caves are famous for their murals, which can still be found in about 40 of the 77 known caves. The desert climate has favored preservation of the content of the [[Astana Cemetery|Astana-Karakhoja ancient tombs]], which are located about 6&amp;nbsp;km from the ancient city of Gaochang. The tombs are the burial place for nobles, officials, and others who were interred there from the times of the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Western Jin dynasty]] until the middle of the Tang dynasty era.

==Climate==
The Turpan Basin has a harsh, continental [[desert climate]] in which the precipitation is far less than the potential evaporation. At Turpan City, July is the hottest month with a 24-hour average temperature of {{convert|32.2|C|1}} and January the coldest with a 24-hour average temperature of {{convert|−7.6|C|1}}. Monthly rainfall is highest in June, at {{convert|2.9|mm}} and lowest in February and April, at {{convert|0.5|mm|abbr=on}}. The annual average precipitation is only {{convert|15.7|mm|abbr=on}}, falling on only 13 days per year. In contrast to this, the potential annual evaporation rate reaches {{convert|3000|mm|abbr=on}}.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Because of its climate, the area is sometimes counted as one of the ''Furnaces of China'', although the locations included under this heading vary.

==Vegetation and agriculture==
[[Image:Turpan-calles-d01.jpg|thumb|250px|Qingnian Lu, a [[Turpan]] city street shaded by grapevine [[Trellis (architecture)|trellises]] in China's [[Grape Valley]]]]
On the shores of [[Ayding Lake|Aydingkol Lake]], reeds, [[tamarix|tamarisks]], [[Haloxylon|saxauls]], as well as other shrubs and weeds can be found. Away from sources of water, the Turpan Basin is not covered by vegetation. Consequently, agriculture is limited to oasis and depends on a sophisticated irrigation system known as the ''[[Turpan water system|Karez System]]''. The irrigation water comes from the surrounding mountain ranges, in particular from the annual melting of the snow. The Karez System consists of wells, underground channels, ground canals, and small reservoirs, which use the natural slope of the terrain to sustain the water flow and guide the water right to the plants while minimizing evaporation all along the way. The historical record of the system extends back to the [[Han Dynasty]]. The number of Karez systems in the area is slightly below one thousand and the total length of the canals is about {{convert|5000|km|abbr=on}} in length. The Karez System is therefore considered as one of the three great ancient projects in China along with the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] and the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]]. Recently, development of groundwater through tubewells has led to a general fall in water tables, and many karez systems have failed. Farming in the Turpan Basin is particularly famous for its fruit. Because of the dry and hot conditions, the fruits grown in the depression have very high concentrations of sugar. They are traditionally processed by drying in open drying barns. The cultivated fruit include: [[Morus (plant)|mulberry]], [[peach]], [[apricot]], [[apple]], [[pomegranate]], [[pear]], [[ficus|fig]], [[walnut]], as well as [[grape]]s, [[watermelon]]s and [[muskmelon]]s. Among the fruit, the grapes stand out: more than 100 varieties of grape are cultivated in the area and it accounts for 90% of China's seedless grape crop. Other specialty agricultural products of the region are [[Donghu Hami melon]]s and [[Gossypium hirsutum|long-staple cotton]].

A '''woog''' (from ''wâc'', a [[Middle High German]] [[hydronym]])&lt;ref name="pwb"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=[[Pfälzisches Wörterbuch]]|Title=Woog – [http://www.woerterbuchnetz.de/PfWB?lemma=woog ‚größeres stehendes (meist künstlich aufgestautes) Gewässer, Teich, Weiher‘] |Volume=Band 6|At=col. &amp;nbsp;1456|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dwb"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=[[Deutsches Wörterbuch]]|Title=Wag – [http://www.woerterbuchnetz.de/DWB?bookref=27,331,21 ‚bewegtes wasser, teich, stauwasser‘] |Volume=Band 27|At=col. &amp;nbsp;331|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the local name for a body of still water in parts of southwest [[Germany]]. A ''woog'' may be of natural origin or manmade.

== Entstehung ==
=== Natürliche Entstehung ===
Der Untergrund in südwestdeutschen [[Mittelgebirge]]n besteht oft aus [[Buntsandstein]]. Dieser ist ein guter [[Permeabilität (Geowissenschaften)|Wasserleiter]], der [[Niederschlag|Niederschläge]] filtert. Das Wasser tritt dann über eingelagerte [[Sperrschicht (Hydrologie)|Sperrschichten]] aus [[Tonminerale|Ton]], welche die weitere [[Regenwasserversickerung|Versickerung]] verhindern, in [[Senke (Geomorphologie)|Senken]] wieder hervor. Dadurch haben sich eine Reihe von [[Moor]]en, Moorseen und [[See]]n gebildet.

=== Künstliche Entstehung ===
In erster Linie als Wasserspeicher für den Betrieb von [[Wasserrad|Mühlen]] oder von [[Klause (Wasserbau)|Klausen]], in denen Holz für die [[Flößerei#Trift|Trift]] gesammelt wurde, wurden durch [[Stausee|Aufstauung]] von Wasserläufen künstliche Wooge angelegt. Diese dienten auch, meist bei [[Kloster|Klöstern]], als [[Aquakultur|Fischzuchtteiche]] oder, aus verbreiterten [[Burggraben|Burggräben]] entstanden, als Teil der [[Befestigung|Stadt- oder Burgbefestigung]], beispielsweise in [[St. Wendel]] und bei der [[Kaiserpfalz (Kaiserslautern)|Kaiserpfalz]] in [[Kaiserslautern]].

Einen vorübergehenden Woog schuf im südpfälzischen [[Wasgau]] der Ritter von [[Burg Berwartstein]], [[Hans von Trotha]], als er nach langjähriger [[Fehde]] mit dem [[Kloster Weißenburg (Elsass)|Kloster Weißenburg]] im Jahre 1485 die [[Lauter (Rhein)|Wieslauter]] bei [[Bobenthal]] zunächst aufstauen und dann den Damm wieder einreißen ließ. So verursachte er in der acht Kilometer unterhalb gelegenen Kleinstadt [[Wissembourg|Weißenburg]] zuerst empfindlichen Wassermangel und dann eine gewaltige Überschwemmung, weshalb der Ritter zunächst mit der [[Reichsacht]] und später auch mit dem [[Kirchenbann]] belegt wurde.

Die [[Sage vom Hecht im Kaiserwoog]] berichtet über eine Begebenheit, die sich 1497 bei der damals von einem künstlichen Gewässer geschützten [[Kaiserpfalz (Kaiserslautern)|Kaiserpfalz von Kaiserslautern]] abgespielt haben soll und angeblich auf ein Ereignis von 1230 zurückgeht.
