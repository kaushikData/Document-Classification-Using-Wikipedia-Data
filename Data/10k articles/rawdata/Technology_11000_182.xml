'''3D optical data storage''' is any form of [[optical]] [[data storage device|data storage]] in which information can be recorded or read with [[three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] [[Optical resolution|resolution]] (as opposed to the [[two-dimensional]] resolution afforded, for example, by [[CD]]).&lt;ref&gt;"Three-Dimensional Optical Data Storage Using Photochromic Materials" S. Kawata and Y. Kawata, Chem. Rev. 2000, 100, 1777.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060911172545/http://sunoptics.caltech.edu/~goffbo/papers/SPIE2003_3Dstorage_proceedings.pdf "Three-Dimensional Optical Storage" G.W. Burr, SPIE Conference on Nano-and Micro-Optics for Information Systems (2003), paper 5225-16.] and also [http://optics.caltech.edu/~goffbo/papers/EOE_volu.pdf this extended version in Encyclopedia of Optical Engineering] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308232318/http://optics.caltech.edu/~goffbo/papers/EOE_volu.pdf |date=March 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This innovation has the potential to provide [[petabyte]]-level [[mass storage]] on [[DVD]]-sized discs (120{{nbsp}}mm). Data recording and readback are achieved by focusing [[lasers]] within the medium. However, because of the volumetric nature of the data structure, the laser light must travel through other data points before it reaches the point where reading or recording is desired. Therefore, some kind of [[nonlinear]]ity is required to ensure that these other data points do not interfere with the addressing of the desired point.

No commercial product based on 3D{{nbsp}}optical data storage has yet arrived on the mass market, although several companies are actively developing the technology and claim that it may become available 'soon'.

==Overview==
Current optical [[data storage device|data storage]] media, such as the [[CD]] and [[DVD]] store data as a series of reflective marks on an internal surface of a disc. In order to increase storage capacity, it is possible for discs to hold two or even more of these data layers, but their number is severely limited since the addressing laser interacts with every layer that it passes through on the way to and from the addressed layer. These interactions cause noise that limits the technology to approximately 10{{nbsp}}layers. [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] optical data storage methods circumvent this issue by using addressing methods where only the specifically addressed [[voxel]] (volumetric pixel) interacts substantially with the addressing light. This necessarily involves nonlinear data reading and writing methods, in particular [[nonlinear optics]].

3D optical data storage is related to (and competes with) [[holographic data storage]]. Traditional examples of holographic storage do not address in the third dimension, and are therefore not strictly "3D", but more recently 3D holographic storage has been realized by the use of microholograms. [[LS-R|Layer-selection]] multilayer technology (where a multilayer disc has layers that can be individually activated e.g. electrically) is also closely related.

[[File:3D optical storage cross-section.svg|right|frame|Schematic representation of a cross-section through a 3D{{nbsp}}optical storage disc (yellow) along a data track (orange marks). Four data layers are seen, with the laser currently addressing the third from the top. The laser passes through the first two layers and only interacts with the third, since here the light is at a high intensity.]]

As an example, a prototypical 3D optical data storage system may use a disc that looks much like a transparent DVD. The disc contains many layers of information, each at a different depth in the media and each consisting of a DVD-like spiral track. In order to record information on the disc a [[laser]] is brought to a [[focus (optics)|focus]] at a particular depth in the media that corresponds to a particular information layer. When the laser is turned on it causes a [[photochemical]] change in the media. As the disc spins and the read/write head moves along a radius, the layer is written just as a DVD-R is written. The depth of the focus may then be changed and another entirely different layer of information written. The distance between layers may be 5 to 100 [[micrometre|micrometer]]s, allowing &gt;100 layers of information to be stored on a single disc.

In order to read the data back (in this example), a similar procedure is used except this time instead of causing a photochemical change in the media the laser causes [[fluorescence]]. This is achieved e.g. by using a lower laser power or a different laser wavelength. The intensity or wavelength of the fluorescence is different depending on whether the media has been written at that point, and so by measuring the emitted light the data is read.

The size of individual chromophore [[molecules]] or photoactive color centers is much smaller than the size of the laser focus (which is determined by the [[diffraction limit]]). The light therefore addresses a large number (possibly even 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) of molecules at any one time, so the medium acts as a homogeneous mass rather than a matrix structured by the positions of chromophores.

==History==
The origins of the field date back to the 1950s, when Yehuda Hirshberg developed the [[photochromic]] [[photochromism#Spiropyrans and spirooxazines|spiropyrans]] and suggested their use in data storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1021/ja01591a075 |volume=78 |title=Reversible Formation and Eradication of Colors by Irradiation at Low Temperatures. A Photochemical Memory Model |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |pages=2304–2312}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, Valeri Barachevskii demonstrated&lt;ref&gt;Soviet Journal of [[Quantum Electronics (journal)|Quantum Electronics]] 1973, vol. 3, no. 2, 128&lt;/ref&gt; that this photochromism could be produced by two–photon excitation, and finally at the end of the 1980s Peter M. Rentzepis showed that this could lead to three-dimensional data storage.&lt;ref&gt;Science 1989, 245, 843&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the developed systems are based to some extent on the original ideas of Rentzepis. A wide range of physical phenomena for data reading and recording have been investigated, large numbers of [[chemical]] systems for the medium have been developed and evaluated, and extensive work has been carried out in solving the problems associated with the optical systems required for the reading and recording of data. Currently, several groups remain working on solutions with various levels of development and interest in commercialization.

==Processes for creating written data==
Data recording in a 3D optical storage medium requires that a change take place in the medium upon excitation. This change is generally a photochemical reaction of some sort, although other possibilities exist. [[Chemical reaction]]s that have been investigated include [[photoisomerization]]s, [[photodecomposition]]s and [[photobleaching]], and [[polymerization]] initiation. Most investigated have been photochromic compounds, which include [[azobenzene]]s, [[Photochromism#Spiropyrans and spirooxazines|spiropyran]]s, [[stilbene]]s, [[fulgide]]s, and [[diarylethene]]s. If the photochemical change is [[reversible reaction|reversible]], then rewritable data storage may be achieved, at least in principle. Also, [[MultiLevel Recording]], where data is written in "[[grayscale]]" rather than as "on" and "off" signals, is technically feasible.

===Writing by nonresonant multiphoton absorption===
Although there are many nonlinear optical phenomena, only multiphoton absorption is capable of injecting into the media the significant energy required to electronically excite molecular species and cause chemical reactions. [[Two-photon absorption]] is the strongest multiphoton absorbance by far, but still it is a very weak phenomenon, leading to low media sensitivity. Therefore, much research has been directed at providing chromophores with high [[two-photon absorption cross-section]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Science 1998, 281, 1653&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing by two-photon absorption can be achieved by focusing the writing laser on the point where the photochemical writing process is required. The wavelength of the writing laser is chosen such that it is not linearly absorbed by the medium, and therefore it does not interact with the medium except at the focal point. At the focal point two-photon absorption becomes significant, because it is a nonlinear process dependent on the square of the laser [[fluence]].

Writing by two-photon absorption can also be achieved by the action of two lasers in coincidence. This method is typically used to achieve the parallel writing of information at once. One laser passes through the media, defining a line or plane. The second laser is then directed at the points on that line or plane that writing is desired. The coincidence of the lasers at these points excited two-photon absorption, leading to writing photochemistry.

===Writing by sequential multiphoton absorption===
Another approach to improving media sensitivity has been to employ [[resonant]] two-photon absorption (also known as "1+1" or "sequential" two–photon absorbance). Nonresonant two-photon absorption (as is generally used) is weak since in order for excitation to take place, the two exciting [[photons]] must arrive at the chromophore at almost exactly the same time. This is because the chromophore is unable to interact with a single photon alone. However, if the chromophore has an energy level corresponding to the (weak) absorption of one photon then this may be used as a [[wikt:stepping stone|stepping stone]], allowing more freedom in the arrival time of photons and therefore a much higher sensitivity. However, this approach results in a loss of nonlinearity compared to nonresonant two–photon absorbance (since each two-photon absorption step is essentially linear), and therefore risks compromising the 3D resolution of the system.

===Microholography===
In micro[[holography]], focused beams of light are used to record submicrometre-sized [[hologram]]s in a photorefractive material, usually by the use of collinear beams. The writing process may use the same kinds of media that are used in other types of [[holographic data storage]], and may use two–photon processes to form the holograms.

===Data recording during manufacturing===
Data may also be created in the manufacturing of the media, as is the case with most optical disc formats for commercial data distribution. In this case, the user can not write to the disc{{snd}} it is a [[read-only memory|ROM]] format. Data may be written by a nonlinear optical method, but in this case the use of very high power lasers is acceptable so media sensitivity becomes less of an issue.

The fabrication of discs containing data molded or printed into their 3D structure has also been demonstrated. For example, a disc containing data in 3D may be constructed by sandwiching together a large number of wafer-thin discs, each of which is molded or printed with a single layer of information. The resulting ROM disc can then be read using a 3D reading method.

===Other approaches to writing===
Other techniques for writing data in three-dimensions have also been examined, including:

Persistent [[spectral hole burning]] (PSHB), which also allows the possibility of spectral [[multiplexing]] to increase data density. However, PSHB media currently requires extremely low temperatures to be maintained in order to avoid data loss.

Void formation, where microscopic bubbles are introduced into a media by high intensity laser irradiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1063/1.1467615 |volume=80 |title=Formation of voids in a doped polymethylmethacrylate polymer |journal=Applied Physics Letters |pages=2404}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chromophore poling, where the laser-induced reorientation of chromophores in the media structure leads to readable changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1364/OE.14.009896 |volume=14 |title=Rewritable optical data storage in azobenzene copolymers |journal=Optics Express |pages=9896}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Processes for reading data==
The reading of data from 3D optical memories has been carried out in many different ways. While some of these rely on the nonlinearity of the light-matter interaction to obtain 3D resolution, others use methods that spatially filter the media's linear response. Reading methods include:

Two photon absorption (resulting in either absorption or fluorescence). This method is essentially [[two-photon microscopy]].

Linear excitation of fluorescence with confocal detection. This method is essentially [[confocal laser scanning microscopy]]. It offers excitation with much lower laser powers than does two-photon absorbance, but has some potential problems because the addressing light interacts with many other data points in addition to the one being addressed.

Measurement of small differences in the refractive index between the two data states. This method usually employs a [[phase contrast microscope]] or confocal reflection [[microscope]]. No absorption of light is necessary, so there is no risk of damaging data while reading, but the required [[refractive index]] mismatch in the disc may limit the thickness (i.e. number of data layers) that the media can reach due to the accumulated random wavefront errors that destroy the focused spot quality.

[[Second harmonic generation]] has been demonstrated as a method to read data written into a poled polymer matrix.&lt;ref&gt;Paper 6653-10 presented at SPIE Optics and Photonics 2007, San Diego.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Optical coherence tomography]] has also been demonstrated as a parallel reading method.&lt;ref&gt;Optics Communications 2003, 220, 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media design==
The active part of 3D optical storage media is usually an [[organic chemistry|organic]] [[polymer]] either [[doped]] or [[graft copolymer|grafted]] with the photochemically active species. Alternatively, crystalline and [[sol-gel]] materials have been used.

===Media form factor===
Media for 3D optical data storage have been suggested in several form factors: disk, card and crystal.

A disc media offers a progression from CD/DVD, and allows reading and writing to be carried out by the familiar spinning disc method.

A [[credit card]] form factor media is attractive from the point of view of portability and convenience, but would be of a lower capacity than a disc.

Several [[science fiction]] writers have suggested small solids that store massive amounts of information, and at least in principle this could be achieved with [[5D optical data storage]].

===Media manufacturing===
The simplest method of [[manufacturing]]{{snd}} the [[molding (process)|molding]] of a disk in one piece{{snd}} is a possibility for some systems. A more complex method of media manufacturing is for the media to be constructed layer by layer. This is required if the data is to be physically created during manufacture. However, layer-by-layer construction need not mean the sandwiching of many layers together. Another alternative is to create the medium in a form analogous to a roll of adhesive tape.&lt;ref&gt;US Patent no. 6,386,458&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drive design==
A drive designed to read and write to 3D&amp;nbsp;optical data storage media may have a lot in common with CD/DVD drives, particularly if the form factor and data structure of the media is similar to that of CD or DVD. However, there are a number of notable differences that must be taken into account when designing such a drive.

===Laser===
Particularly when two-photon absorption is utilized, high-powered lasers may be required that can be bulky, difficult to cool, and pose safety concerns. Existing optical drives utilize [[continuous wave]] [[diode laser]]s operating at 780&amp;nbsp;nm, 658&amp;nbsp;nm, or 405&amp;nbsp;nm. 3D&amp;nbsp;optical storage drives may require [[solid-state laser]]s or pulsed lasers, and several examples use wavelengths easily available by these technologies, such as 532&amp;nbsp;nm (green). These larger lasers can be difficult to integrate into the read/write head of the optical drive.

===Variable spherical aberration correction===
Because the system must address different depths in the medium, and at different depths the [[spherical aberration]] induced in the [[wavefront]] is different, a method is required to dynamically account for these differences. Many possible methods exist that include optical elements that swap in and out of the optical path, moving elements, [[adaptive optics]], and immersion lenses.

===Optical system===
In many examples of 3D optical data storage systems, several wavelengths (colors) of light are used (e.g. reading laser, writing laser, signal; sometimes even two lasers are required just for writing). Therefore, as well as coping with the high laser power and variable spherical aberration, the optical system must combine and separate these different colors of light as required.

===Detection===
In DVD drives, the signal produced from the disc is a reflection of the addressing laser beam, and is therefore very intense. For 3D optical storage however, the signal must be generated within the tiny volume that is addressed, and therefore it is much weaker than the laser light. In addition, fluorescence is radiated in all directions from the addressed point, so special light collection optics must be used to maximize the signal.

===Data tracking===
Once they are identified along the z-axis, individual layers of DVD-like data may be accessed and tracked in similar ways to DVDs. The possibility of using parallel or page-based addressing has also been demonstrated. This allows much faster [[data transfer rate (disk drive)|data transfer rate]]s, but requires the additional complexity of [[spatial light modulator]]s, signal imaging, more powerful lasers, and more complex data handling.

==Development issues==
Despite the highly attractive nature of 3D optical data storage, the development of commercial products has taken a significant length of time. This results from limited financial backing in the field, as well as technical issues, including:

Destructive reading. Since both the reading and the writing of data are carried out with laser beams, there is a potential for the reading process to cause a small amount of writing. In this case, the repeated reading of data may eventually serve to erase it (this also happens in phase change materials used in some DVDs). This issue has been addressed by many approaches, such as the use of different absorption bands for each process (reading and writing), or the use of a reading method that does not involve the absorption of energy.

Thermodynamic stability. Many chemical reactions that appear not to take place in fact happen very slowly. In addition, many reactions that appear to have happened can slowly reverse themselves. Since most 3D media are based on chemical reactions, there is therefore a risk that either the unwritten points will slowly become written or that the written points will slowly revert to being unwritten. This issue is particularly serious for the spiropyrans, but extensive research was conducted to find more stable chromophores for 3D memories.

Media sensitivity. [[two-photon absorption]] is a weak phenomenon, and therefore high power lasers are usually required to produce it. Researchers typically use [[Ti-sapphire laser]]s or [[Nd:YAG laser]]s to achieve excitation, but these instruments are not suitable for use in consumer products.

==Academic development==
Much of the development of 3D optical data storage has been carried out in universities. The groups that have provided valuable input include:

==Commercial development==
In addition to the academic research, several companies have been set up to commercialize 3D optical data storage and some large corporations have also shown an interest in the technology. However, it is not yet clear whether the technology will succeed in the market in the presence of competition from other quarters such as [[hard drive]]s, [[flash storage]], and [[holographic storage]].

*Call/Recall was founded in 1987 on the basis of Peter Rentzepis' research. Using two–photon recording (at 25&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s with 6.5&amp;nbsp;ps, 7&amp;nbsp;nJ, 532&amp;nbsp;nm pulses), one–photon readout (with 635&amp;nbsp;nm), and a high NA (1.0) immersion lens, they have stored 1&amp;nbsp;[[terabyte|TB]] as 200&amp;nbsp;layers in a 1.2&amp;nbsp;mm thick disk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Walker |first1= E |last2= Rentzepis |first2= P |year= 2008 |title= Two Photon Technology: A New Dimension |url= |journal= Nature Photonics |volume= 2 |issue= 7 |pages= 406–408 |doi=10.1038/nphoton.2008.121}}&lt;/ref&gt; They aim to improve capacity to &gt;5&amp;nbsp;TB and data rates to up to 250&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s within a year, by developing new materials as well as high-powered pulsed blue laser diodes.
*Mempile are developing a commercial system with the name [[TeraDisc]].

*[[Constellation 3D]] developed the [[Fluorescent Multilayer Disc]] at the end of the 1990s, which was a ROM disk, manufactured layer by layer. The company failed in 2002, but the intellectual property ([[intellectual property|IP]]) was acquired by D-Data Inc.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ddatainc.com/ D-Data corporate website]&lt;/ref&gt; who are attempting to introduce it as the [[Digital Multilayer Disk]] (DMD).
*Storex Technologies has been set up to develop 3D media based on fluorescent photosensitive glasses and glass-ceramic materials. The technology derives from the patents of the [[Romania]]n scientist [[Eugen Pavel]], who is also the founder and CEO of the company. At ODS2010 conference were presented results regarding readout by two non-fluorescence methods of a Petabyte Optical Disc.
*Landauer Inc. are developing a media based on resonant two-photon absorption in a [[sapphire]] single crystal substrate. In May 2007, they showed the recording of 20 layers of data using 2 nJ of laser energy (405&amp;nbsp;nm) for each mark. The reading rate is limited to 10&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s because of the fluorescence lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;MS Akselrod, SS Orlov, GJ Sykora, KJ Dillin, TH Underwood "Progress in Bit-Wise Volumetric Optical Storage Using Alumina-Based Media" in Optical Data Storage on CD-ROM (The Optical Society of America), MA2.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Colossal Storage aim to develop a 3D holographic optical storage technology based on [[photon-induced electric field poling]] using a [[ultraviolet|far UV]] laser to obtain large improvements over current data capacity and transfer rates, but as yet they have not presented any experimental research or feasibility study.

The '''8-track tape''' (formally '''Stereo 8'''; commonly known as the '''eight-track cartridge''', '''eight-track tape''', or simply '''eight-track''') is a [[tape recorder|magnetic tape sound-recording]] technology that was popular in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|quote=While immensely popular in the United States for a period of time... |title=What Are 8-Track Tapes?|url= http://www.wisegeek.com/what-are-8-track-tapes.htm |publisher=wisegeek.com |accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 1964 to 1988, when the [[Compact Cassette]] format took over.&lt;ref name=goldmine&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldminemag.com/collector-resources/collectors-corner-the-history-of-the-eight-track-tape|quote=Just as the signs were all pointing to eight-track toppling vinyl as the format of choice for music lovers in the United States, Canada ''and '''to a lesser extent''', in Great Britain,'' along came the audio cassette|title=Collector’s Corner: The History Of The Eight-Track Tape|accessdate=2014-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=unknown&gt;{{cite web|quote=Outside of the United Kingdom, Canada, and a few other nations, the use of 8-track technology was virtually unknown.|title=What Are 8-Track Tapes?|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-are-8-track-tapes.htm|accessdate=2014-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The format is regarded as an obsolete technology, and was relatively unknown outside the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], [[Germany]] and [[Japan]].&lt;ref name=goldmine/&gt;&lt;ref name=unknown/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.8trackheaven.com/archive/world.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Stereo 8 was created in 1964 by a consortium led by [[Bill Lear]] of [[Lear Jet]] Corporation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/04/archives/bill-lear-thinks-hell-have-the-last-laugh.html|title=Bill Lear Thinks He'll Have the Last Laugh|last=Wilford|first=John Noble|date=1971-04-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-09-29|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[Ampex]], [[Ford Motor Company]], [[General Motors]], [[Motorola]], and [[RCA Victor Records]] ([[RCA]] - [[Radio Corporation of America]]). It was a further development of the similar [[Stereo-Pak]] four-track cartridge introduced by [[Madman Muntz|Earl "Madman" Muntz]] (marketing and television set dealer), which was adapted by Muntz from the [[Fidelipac]] cartridge developed by [[George Eash]]. A later [[quadraphonic sound|quadraphonic]] (four-channel sound as opposed to earlier more widely used stereo/two channel sound) version of the format was announced by RCA in April 1970 and first known as '''Quad-8''', then later changed to just '''Q8'''.

== History ==

The original format for [[magnetic tape]] sound reproduction was the [[reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel tape recorder]], first available in the United States in the late 1940s, but too expensive and bulky to be practical for amateur home use until well into the 1950s. Loading a reel of tape onto the machine and threading it through the various guides and rollers proved daunting to some casual users—certainly, it was more difficult than putting a vinyl record on a record player and flicking a switch. Because in early years each tape had to be dubbed from the master tape in real-time to maintain good sound quality, prerecorded tapes were more expensive to manufacture, and costlier to buy, than vinyl records which could be stamped much more quickly than their own playing time.

To eliminate the nuisance of tape-threading, various manufacturers introduced cartridges that held the tape inside a metal or plastic housing to eliminate handling. Most were intended only for low-fidelity voice recording in dictation machines. The first tape cartridge designed for general consumer use, including music reproduction, was the Sound Tape or Magazine Loading Cartridge ([[RCA tape cartridge]]), introduced in 1958 by RCA. Prerecorded [[stereophonic sound|stereophonic]] music cartridges were available, and blank cartridges could be used to make recordings at home, but the format failed to gain popularity.

=== Development of tape cartridges ===

[[File:Unitape-8-track-recordimg-cartridge.jpg|thumb|Blank cartridges could be used to make recordings at home]]

The [[Endless tape cartridge|endless loop tape cartridge]] was first designed in 1952 by Bernard Cousino around a single reel carrying a continuous loop of standard 1/4-inch, plastic, oxide-coated recording tape running at {{convert|3.75|in|cm|2|abbr=on}} per second. Program starts and stops were signaled by a one-inch-long metal foil that activates the track-change sensor. (Bill Lear had tried to create an endless-loop [[wire recorder]] in the 1940s, but gave up in 1946. He would be inspired by Earl Muntz's four-track design in 1963.)

Inventor George Eash invented a cartridge design in 1953, called the [[Fidelipac]] cartridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BikEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA19&amp;dq=George+Eash+CARtridge+inventor+tells+how+it+was+born |title=George Eash CARtridge inventor tells how it was born |journal=Billboard |date=3 March 1966 |volume=78 |issue=10 |accessdate=26 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Eash cartridge was later licensed by manufacturers, notably the Collins Radio Company, which first introduced a cartridge system for broadcasting at the National Association of Broadcasters 1959 annual show. Fidelipac cartridges (nicknamed "carts" by DJs and radio engineers) were used by many radio stations for commercials, jingles, and other short items. Eash later formed Fidelipac Corporation to manufacture and market tapes and recorders, as did several others, including Audio-Pak (Audio Devices Corp.).

There were several attempts to sell music systems for cars, beginning with the Chrysler [[Highway Hi-Fi]] of the late 1950s (which used discs). Entrepreneur, marketer and television set dealer [[Madman Muntz|Earl "Madman" Muntz]] of [[Los Angeles, California]], however, saw a potential in these "broadcast carts" for an automobile music system. In 1962, he introduced his [[Stereo-Pak]] four-track cartridge stereo system and tapes, mostly in [[California]] and [[Florida]]. The four tracks were divided into two "programs", typically corresponding to the two sides of an [[LP record]], with each program comprising two tracks read simultaneously for stereo (two channel) sound playback. He licensed popular music albums from the major record companies and duplicated them on these four-track cartridges, or "CARtridges", as they were first advertised.

=== Introduction of Stereo 8 ===
The Lear Jet Stereo 8 track cartridge was designed by Richard Kraus while working under Bill Lear and for his Lear Jet Corporation in 1963. The major change was to incorporate a neoprene rubber and nylon pinch roller into the cartridge itself, rather than to make the pinch roller a part of the tape player, reducing mechanical complexity. Lear also eliminated some of the internal parts of the Eash cartridge, such as the tape-tensioning mechanism and an interlock that prevented tape slippage. By doubling the number of tracks from 4 to 8,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ischool.utexas.edu/~cochinea/html-paper/a-crews-03-magnetic-media.html&lt;/ref&gt; the recording length doubled to 80 minutes.

In 1964, Lear's aircraft company constructed 100 demonstration Stereo 8 players for distribution to executives at RCA and the auto companies.

=== Commercial success ===

The popularity of both four-track and eight-track cartridges grew from the booming automobile industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videointerchange.com/audio_history.htm |title=Vintage Audio Recording History |publisher=Videointerchange.com |date=10 May 2012 |accessdate=27 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1965, the [[Ford Motor Company]] introduced factory-installed and dealer-installed eight-track tape players  as an option on three of its 1966 models (the sporty [[Ford Mustang|Mustang]], [[Ford Thunderbird|Thunderbird]], and the luxurious high-end [[Lincoln (automobile)|Lincoln]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/01/25/archives/some-help-from-debussy-for-the-hassled-driver.html|title=Some Help From Debussy For the Hassled Driver|last=Despagni|first=Anthony J.|date=1976|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-09-29|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; and RCA Victor introduced 175 Stereo-8 Cartridges from its RCA Victor and RCA Camden labels of recording artists catalogs.&lt;ref name="Billboard Sep 1965"&gt;{{cite journal |title=RCA Fires 175-Title Burst with Release of Stereo 8 Cartridges | journal=Billboard |volume=77 |issue=39 |page=3 |date=25 September 1965 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HCkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA3  |issn=0006-2510 |accessdate=27 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1967 model year, all of Ford's vehicles offered this tape player upgrade option. Most of the initial factory installations were separate players from the radio (such as shown in the image), but [[dashboard]] mounted 8-track units were offered in combination with an AM radio, as well as with AM/FM receivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=JHVaQFDrx_MC&amp;pg=RA1-PT16&amp;dq=AMC+AM/8-track+stereo+tape+player |page=73 |last=Mitchell |first=Larry G. |title=AMC Muscle Cars| year=2000 |publisher=MBI Publishing|isbn=978-0-7603-0761-8 |accessdate=26 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Muntz, and a few other manufacturers, also offered 4/8 or "12-track" players that were capable of playing cartridges of either format, 4-track or 8-track. With the backing of the U.S. automakers, the eight-track format quickly won out over the four-track format, with Muntz abandoning it completely by late 1970.

Despite its problems, the format gained steady popularity because of its convenience and portability. Home players were introduced in 1966 that allowed consumers to share tapes between their homes and portable systems. By the late 1960s, the 8-track segment was the largest in the consumer electronics market and the popularity of 8-track systems for cars helped generate demand for home units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=sgoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA32&amp;dq=8-track+segment+of+this+booming+market+is+by+far+the+largest |title=8-track market booms |first=Oscar P. |last=Kussisto |journal=Billboard |date=2 November 1968 |accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Boombox" type portable players were also popular but eight-track player/recorders failed to gain wide popularity and few manufacturers offered them except for manufacturer Tandy Corporation (for its [[Radio Shack]] electronics stores). With the availability of cartridge systems for the home, consumers started thinking of eight-tracks as a viable alternative to 33 rpm album style [[vinyl record]]s, not only as a convenience for the car. Within a year, prerecorded releases on the eight-track tape format began to arrive within a month of the vinyl release. The eight-track format became by far the most popular and offered the largest music library of all the tape systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5ikDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=Eight-track+by+far+the+most+popular+offers+the+largest+music+library|title=The best tape system for you |first=Sam |last=Shatavsky |journal=Popular Science |date=February 1969 |pages=126–129 |volume=194 |issue=2 |accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eight-track players were fitted as standard equipment in most [[Rolls-Royce]] and [[Bentley]] cars of the period for sale in [[Great Britain]] and worldwide. Optional 8-track players were available in many cars and trucks through the early 1980s.

Ampex, based in [[Elk Grove Village, Illinois]], set up a [[Europe]]an operation (Ampex Stereo Tapes) in [[London, England]], in 1970 under general manager Gerry Hall, with manufacturing in [[Nivelles, Belgium]], to promote 8-track product (as well as musicassettes) in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and in Europe, but it struggled and folded in 1974.{{Verify source|date=January 2014}}

[[Quadraphonic]] sound on eight-track cartridges (announced by RCA in April 1970) were also produced, Ford being particularly eager to promote in-car quadraphonic players as a pricey option. Neither [[Chrysler Corporation|Chrysler]], [[General Motors]], nor [[American Motors]] of the other three of the "Big Four" American automotive companies however offered a quadraphonic tape player. The format enjoyed a moderate amount of success for a time in the early 1970s but faded by mid-decade. These cartridges are sought by collectors since they provide four channels of discrete sound, unlike [[Matrix decoder|matrixed]] formats such as SQ, which [[Columbia Records|Columbia]]/[[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS Records]] used for their quadraphonic sound vinyl records.

=== Early karaoke machines ===
[[Daisuke Inoue]] invented the first karaoke machine in 1971 called the Juke-8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Raftery|first1=Brian|title=Don't Stop Believin': How Karaoke Conquered the World and Changed My Life|date=2008|publisher=Da Capo Press|location=Boston, Massachusetts|isbn=0306815834}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mitsui|first1=Tōru|last2=Hosokawa|first2=Shūhei|title=Karaoke around the world: global technology, local singing|date=1998|publisher=Routledge|location=London ; New York|isbn=9781280140877|pages=29–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other use ===
[[Milton Bradley]]'s (MB) [[OMNI Entertainment System]] was an electronic quiz machine game first released in 1980, similar to ''[[Jeopardy! (video game)|Jeopardy!]]'' or later [[You Don't Know Jack (franchise)|''You Don't Know Jack'' video game series]], using 8-track tapes for playback analog audio for questions, instructions and answers as well as digital signals in [[magnetic tape data storage]] on remaining tracks to load the right answer for counting the score. In 1978, the [[Mego Corporation]] launched the [[2-XL]] toy robot, which was similar.&lt;ref&gt;[[Techmoan]]: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyOKgLtUxto MB OMNI Entertainment System - The 1980s 8-Track games machine], YouTube 6 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decline and demise ===

Eight-track players became less common in homes and vehicles in the late 1970s. The [[compact cassette]] arrived in 1962, and by the 1970s the eight-track cartridges had greatly diminished in popularity.  In some [[Latin America]]n countries as well as European, the format was abandoned in the mid-1970s in favor of the smaller tape cassette which was one-third the size.

In the U.S.A., eight-track cartridges were phased out of retail stores by late 1982. Some titles were still available as eight-track tapes through [[Columbia House]] and [[RCA]] (BMG) Music Service ''Record Clubs'' until late 1988. Many of these late-period releases are highly collectible because of the low numbers that were produced and the few customers who ever purchased them. Among the most rare is [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]]'s ''[[Texas Flood]]''. Another is [[Bruce Springsteen]] and the E Street Band's ''[[Live/1975-85]]'', which was one of the very few boxed sets to be released on vinyl, cassette, compact disc, and eight-track tape.

There is a debate among collectors about the last commercial eight-track released by a major label, but the fan/enthusiast internet website "8 Track Heaven" cannot find a major label release past [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s ''[[Greatest Hits (1988 Fleetwood Mac album)|Greatest Hits]]'' in November 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.8trackheaven.com/80s.html |title=Record Club Only 8-tracks |publisher=8trackheaven.com |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111120200426/http://www.8trackheaven.com/80s.html |archivedate=20 November 2011 |accessdate=27 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Radio Shack]] (Tandy Corporation) continued to sell blank eight-track cartridges for home recording use under its [[Realistic (brand)|Realistic]] brand until 1990.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radioshackcatalogs.com/catalogs/1990/&lt;/ref&gt;

The professional broadcast cart format survived for more than another decade at most local radio stations. It was used to play and switch short brief jingles, advertisements, station identifications, and music content until it was replaced by various computer-based methods in the 1990s. This format survived longer because it was used for relatively short sound loops, where starting from the beginning was more important than other criteria. The endless loop tape concept continues to be used in modern [[movie projector]]s, although in that application the spool is actively rotated and not drawn by tension on the film. That too, however, is now being supplanted by [[digital cinema]] technologies.

Some independent artists still release eight-track tapes, such as the U.
S. band RTB2, who released ''We Are a Strange Man'' in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Floorwalker |first=Mike |title=10 Music Recordings for the Insanely Determined |url= http://listverse.com/2013/01/15/10-music-recordings-for-the-insanely-determined/ |date=15 January 2013 |work=listverse.com |accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, bands sometimes release eight-tracks as special releases; for example, [[The Melvins]] released a limited-time, live eight-track album,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.themelvins.net/discography/special/8track/index.html |title=Slim's 8-Track |publisher=Themelvins.net |date= |accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cheap Trick]] issued a limited edition version of their album ''[[The Latest]]'' on the format on June 23, 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carnoy |first=David |title=New Cheap Trick album available on 8-track tape|url= http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-10287864-1.html |publisher=CNET |date=15 July 2009 |accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and power electronics solo artist Waves Crashing Piano Chords has released multiple eight-track tapes since 2012, as well as starting an eight-track tape label, H8-Track Stereo. In the book [[Journals (Cobain)|Journals]], [[Kurt Cobain]] wrote about wanting to release [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s album ''[[In Utero (album)|In Utero]]'' as an 8-track tape, but this never happened. Apart from a select group of highly collectible artists, the record club issues, and the quadraphonic releases, many eight-track tapes seem to have limited value to most collectors, especially if the tapes have been misused or appear to be worn. They are however still to be found at some thrift second-hand stores, flea markets and internet auctions.

== Design ==
{{original research|section|date=February 2015}}

In the Cousino, Eash, Muntz, and Lear cartridges, tape was pulled from the center of the reel, passed across the opening at one end of the cartridge and wound back onto the outside of the same reel. The spool itself was freewheeling and the tape was driven only by tension from the capstan and pinch roller.

With a reel turning at a constant rate, the tape around the hub has a lower [[constant linear velocity|linear velocity]] than the tape at the outside of the reel, so the tape layers must slip past each other as they approach the center. The tape was coated with a slippery backing material, usually [[graphite]] and patented by Bernard Cousino, to ease the continuous slip between the tape layers. While the design allowed simple, cheap, and mobile players, unlike a two-reel system, it did not permit rewinding of the tape. Some players offered fast-forward by speeding up the motor while cutting off the audio.

Muntz's cartridge had used two pairs of stereo tracks in the same configuration as then-current "quarter track" reel-to-reel tapes. This format was intended to parallel his source material, which was usually a single LP (long playing) record with two sides. Program switching was achieved by physically moving the head up and down mechanically by a lever. The Stereo 8 version doubled the amount of programming on the tape by providing eight total tracks, usually comprising four programs of two tracks each. Lear touted this as a great improvement, because much more music could be held inside a standard cartridge housing, but in practice this resulted in a slight loss of sound quality and an increase in background noise from the narrower tape tracks. Unlike the Stereo-Pak, the Stereo 8 could switch between tracks automatically, with the use of a small length of conductive foil at the splice joint on the tape, which would cause the player to change tracks as it passed the head assembly.

The cartridges have an audible pause due to the presence of a length of metallic foil, which a sensor detects and signals the end of the tape and acts as a splice for the loop. The foil passes across a pair of electrical contacts which are in the tape path. Contact of the foil closes an electrical circuit that engages a solenoid which mechanically shifts the tape head to the level of the next track.

Most players produced a mechanical click when switching programs, although early Lear players switched silently. Because of the expense of producing tape heads capable of reading eight tracks, most eight-track players have heads that read just two tracks. Switching from program to program is accomplished by moving the head itself. Since the alignment of the head to the tape is crucial to any tape system, and because eight-track systems were generally designed to be cheap, this configuration further degraded the sound of the eight-track tape.

The Stereo 8 system was fairly simple, mechanically, but presented difficulties in various primary areas:

* Capstan wear and buildup. As tape residue, dirt and lubricant built up on the capstan, the tape speed would increase and, since the buildup was uneven, the tape speed would become correspondingly uneven. Similarly, some units were subject to the capstan wear, causing a decrease in tape speed.  Technicians routinely kept a supply of new capstans on hand ready to install into worn decks for this reason, during the heyday of the format. Once the capstan wears only .001" the tape speed slows.  Replacing or resurfacing the capstan would restore operation.  The old matchbook-under-the-tape fix was done primarily because the worn capstan would no longer grip the tape and play it at the correct speed. Replacing or resurfacing the capstan restores proper operation without using a wedge under the tape.
* Head alignment. This was an issue for two reasons: a) Azimuth misalignment results in reduced high frequencies, and b) Head height misalignment allows sounds from adjacent tracks to bleed over, an effect sometimes known as "double-tracking". This is due to the resultant time delay between the left and right channels resulting in a degradation of phase correlation. This effect is enhanced in an 8-track system, as compared to either reel-to-reel or cassette, due to the larger physical distance, on the tape, between the left and right channel tracks. Resetting head height and azimuth is a primary service procedure required, when refurbishing any vintage tape deck. Once set the player will perform accurately. This format, unlike other tape formats, features a movable head with four positions. Among audio service technicians, there used to be a joke that "the eight-track is the only audio device which knocks itself out of alignment four times during each album." When tracking/azimuth is set using a high quality (ex: Columbia) or alignment tape, correct operation will be restored. Some brands of 8-track decks had adjustable tape head thumbwheel knobs on the front panel, so the listener could adjust the tracking, much like the later Beta and VHS video tapes that were adjusted for picture quality.  The listener could then adjust the tape head individually for each tape, avoiding double tracking.
* The sensing foil that would allow the tape to switch programs, could dry up, fall off, and the tape would separate, and disappear inside the sealed cartridge.  This was especially prevalent on bootleg tapes, that used cheaper sensing foils.  Had the tape been reinforced on both sides at this point, the tapes would have been much more reliable. Many modern collectors replace the old sensing foil with a more robust, properly reinforced foil. {{As of|2014}}, rolls of new sensing foil and new pressure pads sell at a steady pace on [[eBay]] and other specialty online sites who cater to the format.
* The movement of the head at program switch point could sometimes pull the tape up or down, causing the tape to fold over and start playing the back side of the tape.  The tape would continue to play, albeit muffled and barely audible.  Continued playing would flip the entire tape over, so the tape would be wound on the reel inside with the backside showing.  Many vintage tapes can be found with the back side of the tape, facing forward.  The program switch point is often the place where the tapes would be ingested into the player i.e. "eaten", when the tape head moved from program 4, to program 1- its furthest track change movement.  While moving upward the head would grab the tape, fold it over, and when this fold hit the capstan, it would wrap around the capstan and ingest the tape into the player.
*The "melted" rubber pinch rollers that can be found in many ''early'' 8-Track cartridges were the result of the rubber not being fully [[vulcanization|''cured'']]. After discovering this cause, later cartridges used only ''fully cured'' (hard) rubber pinch rollers that did not deteriorate as much over time.
*Tape tension was another cause of unreliability. Prerecorded eight-track tapes tended to hold only a single album, about 46 minutes of content, or 11.5 minutes per track. Consumers wanted the ability to record more music on a single cartridge, so manufacturers came out with units of greater capacity, i.e. 60 and 90 minutes tapes.  A few 100 minutes tapes do exist. With the corresponding increase in tape length, there was a greater velocity differential between the tape being drawn from the center of the reel and the tape being fed back to the outer edge of the reel as it passed the capstan/pinch-roller assembly (''loop length''). A 90-minute tape also exerts more drag on the tape deck motor, making a large AC 120 volt motor imperative to play the longest tapes.  Over time, cheaper tapes may tighten, making it more difficult to feed, and to maintain a constant playback speed. Once a tape sheds most of its graphite backing, it will bind up and the tape won't play.

When the sliding tape pack would pull itself tight, for whatever reason, a jammed 8-track cartridge was the result. A quick solution was to hold the cartridge in one hand, facing down, while pulling out a section of, about 4-6' in length from the outer winding side. A quick tug on the tape would cause it to immediately wind in and the result was a loosened up tape pack that would play correctly.

Failing that, another solution was to open the cartridge, cut the tape at the splice, and relieve the excess tension by manually unwinding one or two sections from the outer edge of tape (''loop length'') while keeping the reel stationary, then re-splicing the tape, with a fresh piece of foil. Another, simpler fix was to shake the cassette in the plane of the tape reel with a rotary motion, sometimes this would cause the windings inside to rotate and loosen. If the cartridge has shed its graphite backing, it would have to be discarded. Small businesses that specialize in transferring audio tapes to digital format can remove the tape from the surrounding plastic cartridge box and play it on a small [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel]] player to extract maximum sound fidelity.

A decrease in the quality of the parts used in the eight-track cartridge, that is, ''plastic'' pinch rollers, lubricant quality and quantity, etc., was another blow to the faltering format. As these problems further reduced the reliability, sound quality, and consistent tape speed, the eight-track eventually developed a reputation for being unreliable.

== Composition ==

The Stereo 8 introduced the problem of dividing up the programming intended for a two-sided LP record into four programs. Often this resulted in songs being split into two parts (the split was often made during an instrumental break or a repeated chorus), song orders being reshuffled, shorter songs being repeated, and songs separated by long passages of silence. Some eight-tracks included extra musical content to fill in time such as a piano solo on Lou Reed's ''[[Berlin (Lou Reed album)|Berlin]]'', extra verses on The Rolling Stones' ''[[Some Girls]]'' and a guitar solo in [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''[[Animals (Pink Floyd album)|Animals]]''.

In rare instances, an eight-track was able to be arranged exactly like the record album version, without any song breaks. Examples of this are ''[[Quadrophenia]]'' by The Who, and some versions of ''[[Days of Future Passed]]'' by The Moody Blues. Other examples of this rarity are ''[[Freeways (album)|Freeways]]'' by Bachman-Turner Overdrive, ''[[Live - Bursting Out]]'' by Jethro Tull, ''[[Live Bullet]]'' and ''[[Nine Tonight]]'' by Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band, ''[[Caught Live + 5]]'' by The Moody Blues, ''[[The Concert in Central Park]]'' by Simon &amp; Garfunkel, ''[[Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs]]'' by Derek and The Dominoes, ''[[Octave (album)|Octave]]'' by The Moody Blues, the US version of ''[[Three Sides Live]]'' by [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], ''[[Pictures at Eleven]]'' by Robert Plant and ''[[Coda (album)|Coda]]'' by Led Zeppelin (a record club only release).

[[File:US Air Force - Sandia National Laboratory - TRESTLE Electromagnetic Pulse Test Apparatus.jpg|thumb|A Boeing [[B-52]] strategic bomber being prepared for EMP testing at Trestle in 1982.]] '''ATLAS-I''' (Air Force Weapons Lab Transmission-Line Aircraft Simulator), better known as '''Trestle''', was the [[codename]] for a unique [[electromagnetic pulse]] (EMP) generation and testing apparatus built between 1972 and 1980 during the [[Cold War]] at [[Sandia National Laboratories]] near [[Kirtland Air Force Base]] in [[Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;Giri, D.V.

ATLAS-I was the largest [[NNEMP#Non-nuclear electromagnetic pulse|NNEMP]] (Non-Nuclear Electromagnetic Pulse) generator in the world, designed to test the [[radiation hardening]] of strategic aircraft systems against EMP pulses from [[nuclear warfare]]. Built at a cost of $60 million, it was composed of two parts: a pair of powerful [[Marx generator]]s capable of simulating the [[Nuclear electromagnetic pulse|electromagnetic pulse]] effects of a [[high-altitude nuclear explosion]] (HANE) of the type expected during a nuclear war, and a giant wooden [[trestle]] built in a bowl-shaped [[Arroyo (creek)|arroyo]], designed to elevate the test aircraft above ground interference and orient it below the pulse in a similar manner to what would be seen in mid-air.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, F.C.

Trestle is the world's largest structure composed entirely of wood and glue laminate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brookings.edu/projects/archive/nucweapons/trestle.aspx "U.S. Nuclear Weapons Cost Study Project: The Trestle Electromagnetic Pulse Simulator"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910043708/http://www.brookings.edu/projects/archive/nucweapons/trestle.aspx |date=2011-09-10 }}.

==EMP generator==
[[File:TRESTLE EMP simulator - B1B Bomber - Kirtland Air Force Base - 1989.jpeg|thumb| A Rockwell [[B-1B]] strategic bomber is readied for testing at Trestle in 1989. Note the elevated Marx generator to the right, the aircraft platform in the center, the sensor towers to the sides of the platform and the resistive termination tower at the rear.]]
The electromagnetic pulse was produced by a pair of Marx generators built by Maxwell Laboratories of San Diego, California. The generators were mounted on pedestals constructed of wood in the same manner as the main test platform, one on each side of a large wedge shaped steel structure which acted as a ground plane for the horizontally polarized pulse. Each Marx generator consisted of a stack of 50 trays, each containing two large capacitors and a plasma switch.  A large peaking capacitor, used to adjust the shape of the resulting pulse, was also part of the design.  Each generator was enclosed in a large fiberglass structure which was filled with [[SF6|sulfur hexafluoride]] (SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) acting as an insulating gas. The tray capacitors were slowly charged such that each tray had up to 100kV of potential.  When discharged through the plasma switches, the 50 trays in series could (ideally) produce up to 5 megavolts of electrical potential in a pulse with a rise-time in the 100 nanosecond range.  The generators on either side of the wedge were charged to opposite polarities and fired into twin transmission lines (antennas) mounted on either side of the test platform. When triggered simultaneously the resulting EM waves from each generator combined at the sharp point of the wedge building, adding to a total [[electrical potential]] of 10 [[mega-|mega]][[volt]]s.&lt;ref name="reuben"/&gt;  The transmission lines were terminated into a 50 ohm low inductance resistive load mounted on a tall wooden tower at the far end of the platform. The result was a fast 200 [[gigawatt]] pulse of electromagnetic flux powerful enough to reliably reproduce (at short range) the deleterious effects of a [[thermonuclear explosion|thermonuclear detonation]] on electronic circuitry as created by such examples as the [[Hardtack I|HARDTACK I]], [[Operation Argus|ARGUS]] and [[Operation Dominic I and II|DOMINIC I]] ([[Operation Fishbowl]]) high altitude nuclear tests.
[[File:Trestle 0001 03.jpg|thumb|The platform was load tested by driving loaded TEREX mining dump trucks in an array across the deck.  Notice Air Force 1 being tested at the neighboring Vertically Polarized Dipole (VPD) EMP test site in this 1979 photograph.]]
Due to their higher flight altitude and nuclear [[payload]], [[Strategic Air Command]] bombers were the primary object of the tests, but fighters, transport aircraft and even missiles were also tested for EMP hardness on Trestle. In addition to electronics survivability tests, numerous sensors located inside, beneath and to the sides of the aircraft would gather additional data on the airframe's EMP permeability to be used in design considerations for future Cold War aircraft and to identify areas which needed additional EM hardening.

The advances made in EMP generation technology by Sandia during the operation of Trestle greatly assisted in the construction of the much more powerful 40 megavolt, 50 [[terawatt]] (50,000 gigawatt) [[Z Pulsed Power Facility|Z Machine]] at Sandia during the 1990s. Technological advances during the 2000s have since boosted this output to 290 terawatts (290,000 gigawatts), high enough to actually study [[nuclear fusion]] at the point of detonation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sandia.gov/media/z290.htm "Another dramatic climb toward fusion conditions for Sandia Z accelerator"]. [[Sandia National Laboratories]].  Press release. March 2, 1998. Retrieved August 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Trestle 0001 01.jpg|thumb|The Trestle facility under construction in 1975.  The height of the termination tower was driven by the need to clear the tail of a C5A Galaxy transport.]]

==Trestle structure==
The primary wooden structure of Trestle was 1,000 feet long, 125 feet (about 12 stories) tall, and constructed of 6.5 million board-feet of lumber,&lt;ref name="reuben"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reuben |first1=Charles |date=January 6, 2011 |url=http://alibi.com/news/35291/Empire-My-Prince.html |title=In Memoriam: Empire My Prince: Carl Baum, trestle-maker |journal=[[Weekly Alibi]] |volume=20 |issue=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; sufficient to support a fully loaded [[B-52]] (then the largest and heaviest [[strategic bomber]] in the US inventory) while also minimizing any chance of interference from the ground or the structure itself, creating a reasonable simulation of airborne conditions. A mix of [[Douglas Fir]] and [[Southern Yellow Pine]] were used for the timbers,&lt;ref name="reuben"/&gt; as both showed excellent EMP transparency with the former having the best tensile strength and the latter the best weather resistance. By using an all [[glued laminated timber]] structure and [[woodworking joints]] to mate the giant timbers, with the joints being held together with wooden bolts and nuts, measurements from the EMP tests would not be skewed by large amounts of [[ferrous]] material in the structure. Some metal was used in the construction as critically loaded joints incorporated a circular steel sheer ring that surrounded the wooden bolt clamping the joint.  Even the [[fire escape]] along one side of the trestle and the whole of the extensive fire suppression piping were constructed of [[fiberglass]].

== Wedge Building ==
The wedge shaped structure was of steel I-beam construction.  The entire structure was covered with a wire mesh similar to livestock fencing in order to create an enormous Faraday cage.  A multistory building was constructed inside the wedge which served as offices, laboratories and testing facilities.  The second floor of the building housed a large electromagnetically shielded room, supplied by Electromagnetic Filter Company of Palo Alto, California, which contained the data acquisition electronics, the Marx generator charging and firing control and field strength monitoring instrumentation.  The data acquisition system consisted of a large number of state-of-the-art Tektronix 7912AD digitizers along with a large array of DEC PDP-11 computers.  The pulse monitoring instrumentation consisted of a number of B dot and H field sensors mounted on the exterior of the wedge connected to oscilloscopes fitted with Polaroid o'scope cameras needed to capture the transient pulse data.  The open-air third floor held large inflatable gas bags which could store the [[SF6|sulfur hexafluoride]] (SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) gas from the Marx generator enclosures when they needed to be opened for maintenance.

==Current status==
The ATLAS-I program was shut down after the end of the [[Cold War]] in 1991, which brought an end to [[destructive testing|destructive]] EMP testing of aircraft, being replaced by far cheaper [[computer simulations]] as technology improved. Despite going without maintenance for over 20 years, the wooden trestle structures are all still standing and it remains the biggest metal-free wood laminate structure in the world.&lt;ref name="reuben"/&gt; The trestle has, however, become a significant fire hazard since the [pentachlorophenol-isobutane-ether treated] wood has dried considerably in the desert conditions and the automatic [[fire sprinkler system]] was deactivated in 1991. Efforts are underway to secure the funding necessary to have the structure protected as a [[national historic landmark]], although efforts are complicated by the [[top secret]] nature of the Sandia/Kirtland facility it is situated on.

The trestle structure is still easily visible from commercial aircraft landing and taking off from [[Albuquerque International Sunport]], lying about one mile to the southeast of the threshold of Runway 26.

'''Ammunition categories''' are used to define ammunition for weapons in terms of safety, for storage and transport. The Division system categorises any explosive material by the speed of burning and amount of explosive.The [[United Nations]] has also instituted a categorisation system specifically for handgun ammunition. Both these systems can be used together to define safe amounts of ammunition that can be carried on various modes of transport, including civilian scheduled flights.

==Ammunition categories==

[[File:vew-do balance-board.jpg|thumb|right|215 px|Vew-Do balance board]]

A '''balance board''' is a device used as a [[circus skill]], for [[recreation]], [[Balance (ability)|balance training]], [[General fitness training|athletic training]], [[brain development]], [[List of therapies|therapy]], [[music education|musical training]] and other kinds of [[personal development]].

It is a [[lever]] similar to a [[see-saw]] that the user usually stands on, usually with the left and right foot at opposite ends of the board. The user's body must stay balanced enough to keep the board's edges from touching the ground and to keep from falling off the board.

A different challenge is presented by each of the five basic types of balance boards and their subtypes. Some of them can be attempted successfully by three-year-olds and elderly people, and some, because of their [[slope|steepness]] and [[speed]], are difficult and dangerous for professional athletes.

In their design, what differentiates the five types (and their subtypes) is how [[Newton's laws of motion|unstable]] each of them is, i.e., in how many and in which of the three dimensions of space each board turns and/or sways and how freely its [[lever|fulcrum]] contacts the board and the ground.

==Uses and users==
[[File:wobble board stood on with shoes 09B.ogg|thumb|right|225 px|Video of a wobble board]]
In 1953, Stanley Washburn Jr. filed a patent for a balance board with the intention of its use for recreation. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Roller board device|date=Sep 25, 1956|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US2764411|inventor-last=Stanley|inventor-first=Washburn Jr|issue=US2764411 A|accessdate=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; These boards quickly become popular for [[skiers]] and [[surfers]] to practice their balancing skills in the off season or when natural conditions were poor. The balance board is a device that has come to be used for training in sports and martial arts, for physical [[Physical fitness|fitness]] and for non-athletic purposes that are listed here.

[[File:SmirkusRolaBolaHandBalance.jpg|225 px|thumb|left|Rola bola]]

Some people use a balance board for recreational purposes, enjoying the challenge that this equipment presents.

===Circus skill===

The balance board is used as a [[circus skill]] for recreation and performance. Many circus performers refer to the balance board as the rola bola. Skillful and dramatic balancing acts using the rola bola are performed by [[circus]] performers in traditional circus as well as by freelance circus skills artists. The performance can involve a single rola bola or a stack of multiple rola bolas on top of one another to increase the challenge and visual spectacle. Some circus performers also combine the use of the rola bola with other circus skills such as '''[[Juggling]]''' or '''[[Equilibristics]]''' to present a different visual spectacle.&lt;!--The list of circus arts that was contributed here previously has been moved to the article's new "Rola bola skills and tricks" section.  That list of circus arts is linked to from this paragraph (of the "Uses and users" section) by the phrase "other circus arts." Those details fit better in the rola bola section than in the article's first section, whose scope is too broad to specify them.  None of the other uses and users that are sketched here goes into specifics. As rola bola now redirects to balance board more detail is now included in this section--&gt;

==Structure==
The user stands on a board or other platform which is on top of an unstable ground-contacting member, the [[wikt:en:fulcrum|fulcrum]]. The height of the fulcrum of most models is between 3 and 6&amp;nbsp;inches (i.e., the top of the fulcrum is that distance above the ground). Due to the fulcrum's [[instability]], the user must remain balanced and coordinated in order to prevent the board from touching the ground.

[[File:underside and roller of Bongo Board.jpg|255 px|thumb|The roller and underside of a rocker-roller board]]

Thus, the rider stimulates, exercises and teaches the parts of the [[Human body|body]] that implement the act of balancing (toes, soles, ankles, knees, hips, shoulders, arms and neck) and the parts of the body and brain that create the sense of balance and that engineer the implementation of the act of balancing ([[inner ears]], [[cerebellum]], [[proprioceptors]] and [[Human eyes|eyes]]).

[[File:Wobble board after being flicked.ogv|left|thumb|Video of a wobble board's instability]]

The degrees of movement through which the board can move – [[sliding (dance)|sliding]], [[pivot turn|pivoting]], [[rotating]], [[wikt:tilt|tilting]], [[rolling]] or some combination of those – and the speed of the board differ in different types and subtypes of models, depending on the shape and size of the fulcrum, whether it is attached to the board and, if it isn't attached, the method(s) by which it is constrained by the board, if any. With an increase of speed and with each additional degree of movement through which one model or another can move, the need to avoid losing control of the board forces the rider to exercise considerably more skill in order to avoid falling.

[[File:Sphere-and-ring balance board underside.jpg|right|260px|thumb|The underside of a sphere-and-ring board]]

In rocker boards and wobble boards, the fulcrum is attached to the board. In rocker-roller boards and sphere-and-ring boards, the fulcrum is a separate piece from the board. In sphere-and-ring boards, the fulcrum (an inflatable or solid ball) is constrained by a ring on the board's underside. In some rocker-roller boards, the fulcrum (a cylinder or mainly a cylinder) isn't constrained by the board (except by their friction), and in most rocker-rollers the cylinder is constrained by the board in any of five ways (a different number and combination of those ways in each type of rocker-roller) that are described below, in this article's "Rocker-Roller Boards" section.

Positions other than standing are also used, in order to work on particular [[muscles]] and skills. See below, under the heading "Fitness Exercises."

For better foot traction, the stood-on surface of most boards is manufactured with an unsmooth texture: for plastic models, in the molding; for wooden models, with grip tape or rubber.  A smooth surface under the feet or shoes can cause a user to slip off a balance board and fall.

Wobble boards are the only type of balance board that is commonly made of plastic.  Being no longer than their width, they don't need to be as strong and warp-resistant as other balance boards.

==Types==
There are more than a hundred models of balance boards on the market in the United States. Each of them is a version of one of about fifteen types of balance board. Each of these models and types can be classified as one of five basic types of balance board according to two binary parameters: whether its fulcrum is attached to the board and whether the board tilts in only two opposite directions (left and right or forward and back) or in every direction (360 degrees).

More specifically:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! !! Bipolar !! 360 degrees !! The task
|-
! Attached
| {{color| brown| Rocker}} || {{color| brown| Wobble}}|| Static balance
|-
! Not attached
| {{color| brown| Rocker-roller}}
| {{color| brown| Sphere-and-ring}}
| Dynamic balance
|}
In other words:
* A rocker-roller board is a rocker board whose fulcrum is a separate piece.
* A sphere-and-ring board is a wobble board whose fulcrum is a separate piece.
* A wobble board is a rocker board that tilts toward 360 degrees.
* A sphere-and-ring board is a rocker-roller board that tilts toward 360 degrees.
* A spring board rests on compression springs that tilts towards 360 degrees

Those five analogies are not precise definitions. They ignore some details of models' structure.

===Rocker boards===
A rocker board is the most basic and least challenging type of balance board. It is a flat board with a [[wikt:en:fulcrum|fulcrum]] attached to the board's underside. In some models the fulcrum is perpendicular to the board's length and in the other models the fulcrum is two rockers that are parallel to each other and parallel to the board's length, one in front of the person who is standing on the board and one behind. The ground-contacting edge of the fulcrum is curved in most models and is flat in some models.

With one foot placed at each end of the board, the user can tilt it from side to side until the balance point is found and can then either try to keep the board stationary or continue rocking.

Rocker boards offer only one degree of movement: part rotation about the [[Ship motions#Rotation axes|longitudinal axis]], i.e., banking (left-right tilting).

Most rocker boards are made by manufacturers of toys or of gym equipment.

===Rocker-roller boards===
[[File:Bongo Board female models newsreel ca. 1955.ogv|thumbtime=14.9|thumb |280 px |The Bongo Board in a [[newsreel]] from the 1950s]]

Rocker-roller boards add a degree of [[instability]] to the rocker board that makes them much more challenging for the rider than a rocker board is. Rather than on a fixed pivot, a rocker-roller's board is placed on a cylindrical roller; this fulcrum is a wheel that moves in relation to the ground and in relation to the board. The board's pivot point shifts back and forth as the cylinder rolls beneath it. In almost all models the two flat ends of the wheel/roller are about as far from each other as the width of the board. In most models the axis of the roller is perpendicular to the board's length. Thus, as the rider's weight moves over the roller, the board both tilts from side to side and also slides sideways. In models whose roller can be placed with its axis parallel to the board's length, the board slides and tilts toward the front and back (if the rider's feet are oriented accordingly).

[[File:rollers of 7 balance boards.jpg|left|thumb|x260px|The rollers of seven rocker-roller boards]]

The roller has a different form in different models. Some are a cylinder and some are a cylinder in their midsection that [[Cone (geometry)|tapers]] toward the two ends. That tapering enables tricky moves by the rider. Four of the models produced by Vew-Do Balance Boards &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vewdo.com |title=Vew-Do Balance Boards |publisher=vewdo.com |date= |accessdate=May 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; each have a roller whose shape has a different taper, designed for doing different [[Skateboarding trick|tricks]] and simulating different boardsports. (One of those four is the roller at the top of the photograph to the side of this paragraph.) Vew-Do's patent gives information about the effect that its roller's shape has on the board's movement.&lt;ref&gt;http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=5,152,691.PN.&amp;OS=PN/5,152,691&amp;RS=PN/5,152,691{{full|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

How the roller and rocker interface can vary. Rollers may have grooves to fit a guide on the board to keep the roller aligned with the rocker and prevent the rocker from sliding along the roller. Rockers may have guard rails at the ends to prevent the rocker from rolling off the roller.

The [[diameter]] of the roller of almost all rocker-rollers is between 3.5 and 6&amp;nbsp;inches at its widest section. The rollers of the '''rola bolas''' that circus performers use are usually between 7 and 9&amp;nbsp;inches in diameter.

===Wobble boards===

[[File:wobble board anchored in a park.clip.ogv|thumbtime=46.2 |thumb |220 px |Video of an oversized wobble board whose fulcrum, unlike the fulcrum of a standard wobble board, is connected to a stationary base]]

The fulcrum of almost all wobble boards is a semi-sphere or smaller [[spherical cap]] (or a shape that is approximately such) whose flat side is attached to the center of the board's underside. This allows the board to pivot in all directions during the same ride: forward-backward, left-right and anywhere in between, i.e., toward 360 degrees. Standing on a wobble board exercises [[muscles]] that are not exercised by standing on boards that tilt in only two (opposite) directions. In almost all models, the board's length and width are about the same size; a circle is the usual shape.

Wobble boards are widely used in [[child development]], gymnasiums, sport training, [[#prevent &amp; treat joint injuries|prevention of injuries]] to the ankle and knee, [[#prevent &amp; treat joint injuries|rehabilitation]] after ankle, knee and hip injuries and [[#prevent &amp; treat joint injuries|physiotherapy]].

The basic exercise is standing on the wobble board with both feet and tilting in any direction without letting the board tilt so far that its edge touches the ground.  Some of the many other common exercises are [[Squat (exercise)|squats]]; standing on the board with one foot while keeping the other foot off the ground; [[push-up]]s (pressing down on the board with the hands while lying face-down with only the knees or toes contacting the ground); and [[Sit-up (exercise)|sit-ups]] (with the board under one's rear end). Any exercise is much more work when a person's weight is on a wobble board than when s/he is supported by a stable and level base such as a floor.

For additional muscle exercise while wobbling, some models can be attached to an elastic [[Stability training|stretch band]]. Each hand pulls up one of the band's two ends.  Each end of the band fits through one of two opposed holes near the rim of the board, for quick attachment and detachment.

A wobble board offers full rotation about the vertical axis (i.e., [[Yaw, pitch and roll (rotations)#Vertical axis (yaw)|yawing]], i.e., twisting), part rotation about the transverse/lateral axis (i.e., [[Yaw, pitch and roll (rotations)#Lateral axis (pitch)|pitching]], i.e., backward-forward tilting) and part rotation about the longitudinal axis (i.e., [[Yaw, pitch and roll (rotations)#Longitudinal axis (roll)|banking]], i.e., left-right tilting). A fourth and fifth degree of movement, [[Translation (geometry)|translation]] (i.e., sliding) in the dimensions of the two horizontal axes, are possible for almost all wobble boards, i.e., all models except ones that have a stationary base.  This sliding occurs much less often and usually across a shorter distance than in the case of a rocker-roller board and sphere-and-ring board.  It is usually unintended and unwanted by a wobble board user and, presumably, also by the manufacturer and might more accurately be called skidding than sliding.

Plastic is the material that most wobble boards are made of. Wooden models are better able than plastic ones to withstand long use, such as in a gym.  Among plastic models, how heavy-duty the plastic is varies.

Wobble boards are made by manufacturers of gym, sports and physical therapy equipment.

===Sphere-and-ring boards===

[[File:mikee on a CoolBoard.jpg|right|140 px|thumb|The fulcrum is an inflatable rubber ball.]]

A sphere, either an [[inflatable]] rubber ball (such as a basketball) or a solid [[polyurethane]] ball, is the fulcrum on which the board is balanced, and the fulcrum is kept contained under the board by a guard rail or ring on the underside. By redistributing his/her weight across the board, the rider can move the board in any direction– side to side, forward and backward, twisting, diagonal, and full rotations or any combination of these movements.  A rider can move the board vertically by doing an advanced maneuver called an [[ollie (skateboarding trick)|ollie]]. It can also be tilted in any direction and fully rotated. Sphere-and-ring boards provide the greatest [[freedom of movement]] of any type of balance board, allowing rotation about all axes (yawing, pitching and banking) and translation (i.e., sliding) in both transverse (i.e., lateral) and longitudinal directions. They, like wobble boards, simultaneously exercise [[muscles]] that are not exercised by use of boards that tilt about only one axis (in two opposite directions).

[[File:Sphere and ring board si-board with 10 inch ball.jpg|left|225px|thumb|The fulcrum is a solid urethane ball.]]

When balancing or riding on a sphere-and-ring board, the difficulty and ride speed, which is how fast the rider can move the board on the ball, are determined by the following:

; Ring shape and size
: Larger rings allow more movement of the fulcrum. Different shapes change how the fulcrum might move.
; Sphere's size, weight, and rigidity
: These affect how fast the fulcrum moves and how much strength is required to move it.
; Board's shape and size
: Changing these can affect the weight and weight distribution of the board, changing how much strength is required to move it.

===Spring boards===
Spring boards were added to the market in 2013 with the release of [[StrongBoard balance]], which holds a patent on the multi-spring design. The board’s [[wikt:fulcrum|fulcrum]] consists of four individual [[compression spring]]s situated between the base and the platform. Once a user stands on the board, the springs compress. The user’s body then searches for stabilization, but because of the force applied to the springs from the user’s body weight, the board will not stabilize. By redistributing weight across the board, the rider can move the board in any [[Relative direction|direction]] – engaging core stabilizing [[muscles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams |first=Laura |url=http://altfitness.about.com/od/Alternative-Fitness-Equipment/fl/StrongBoard-Balance-220-Fitness-Review.htm |title=Fitness Trends - Articles and Advice |publisher=Altfitness.about.com |date=2018-02-05 |accessdate=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four compression springs provide additional support for a variety of exercises, target the [[core (anatomy)|core]], and improve [[balance (ability)|balance]], [[Core stability|core strength]], [[agility]], and [[Human position|posture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Corbin |first=Lori |url=http://abc7.com/health/strongboard-challenges-your-balance-boosts-your-workout/338659/ |title=Strongboard challenges your balance, boosts your workout |publisher=abc7.com |date=2014-10-06 |accessdate=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aquatic types===
These are underwater balance boards.  They were developed for [[physical therapy]] and are used also for recreation.  Besides the general advantages of [[aquatic therapy]] over non-aquatic therapy (the use of the smooth resistance of water instead of the jerky resistance of weights and the avoidance of burdening an injured joint with excessive weight– in this case, the weight of the patient's own body), aquatic balance boards have the specific advantage over non-aquatic balance boards of saving a patient who slips off of a board from the impact of falling and crashing into a floor.  Slipping off of an aquatic balance board is safe as long as the user knows to avoid inhaling while underwater and knows how to tread water.

Three models are produced by Theraquatics Australia: The Theraquatics Balance Board is a V-shaped [[#Rocker boards|rocker board]] that a user stands, kneels or sits on.  The Wonder Board is a V-shaped [[#Rocker boards|rocker board]] that a user kneels or sits on.  The Aquatic Balance Board (a.k.a. the Aquafit Balance Board) is a [[#Wobble boards|wobble board]].  The holes in it allow water to fill it, making it neutrally buoyant (i.e., neither sinking on its own nor floating up to the water's surface) so that it is easier to control and safer than it would be if this wobble board were more buoyant.
Two products that Theraquatics Australia calls balance boards, its Star Balance Board and its Theraquatics Balance Board with Straps, are not balance boards in the familiar sense of the term, though they can be used for practicing balance skills.

==Psychological aspects==

Proper use of a balance board is a test of both physical skill and the user's [[sense of balance]].

Another sensation often experienced by a user of a balance board is the [[falling (sensation)|sensation of falling]]. Apart from actually falling, this often occurs during sharp accelerations caused by leaning too far or too quickly. Feeling like falling can raise fears and provoke reflexes that while useful on a stable surface can be counter-productive on a balance board, such as throwing the arms forward to catch the fall or over-correcting and sharply shifting weight onto the opposite leg, causing a fall in the opposite direction.

==Injury risk and prevention==
Falls from balance boards can break bones, sprain joints, and tear tendons, ligaments and cartilage. These risks can be diminished by preparing the space, wearing protective gear and following manufacturers' other safety recommendations.

Risk can be lowered by anticipating falls and clearing the surrounding area of objects that the rider might fall onto, and making sure that the surface is soft.

Important protective gear is gear that protects the joints, the head and face, and otherwise protects from bumps and scrapes during falls. Care should be taken in selecting a helmet, as the weight could make falls worse or the shape might be unsuited for protecting from falls and might be pressed into the neck during impact.

Standing on a balance board is extremely dangerous for a person who is prone to [[dizziness]] or whose balance is impaired, such as by being tired or [[wikt:under the influence|under the influence]] of alcohol or other drugs.

==History==
Cayman Chemical Company was incorporated on June 6, 1980 in Denver, Colorado. It was initially a marine [[natural product]]s company. Building on earlier environmental studies in the North Sound of Grand Cayman Island, Cayman initially sold [[prostaglandin]] standards as research chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Prostaglandins from Plexaura Homomalla: Ecology, utilization, and Conservation of a Major Medical Marine Resource|year=1974|publisher=University of Miami Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company operated in Denver for several years before relocating to Ann Arbor, Michigan.

Commercializing the patented work of Philippe Pradelles and others, Cayman exploited the acetylcholinesterase enzyme of [[electric eels]] to develop a range of sensitive enzyme immunoassays for prostaglandins in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pradelles|first=Phillippe|author2=Jaques Grassi |author3=Jaques Maclouf |title=Enzyme immunoassays of eicosanoids using acetylcholine esterase as label: an alternative to radioimmunoassay|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ac00284a003?journalCode=ancham|journal=Analytical Chemistry|year=1985|volume=57|issue=7|pages=1170–1173|accessdate=10 July 2013|doi=10.1021/ac00284a003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The availability of these assays enabled the development of Celebrex by [[G.D. Searle, LLC|Searle]]/[[Monsanto]], relying on measurements of Prostaglandin E2 and [[Thromboxane B2]], and of Singulaire by [[Merck &amp; Co]], relying on measurements of unstable Leukotrienes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brideau|first=Christine|author2=Carlo Van Staden |author3=Chi Chung Chan |title=In vitro effects of cyclooxygenase inhibitors in whole blood of horses, dogs, and cats|journal=American Journal of Veterinary Research|date=November 2001|volume=62(11|pages=1755–1760}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4455">The '''Center of Molecular Immunology''' ('''Centro de Inmunología Molecular''') or '''CIM''', is a [[cancer]] research institution located on the west side of [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]. {{Coord|23.0755|-82.4708}} Opened on December 5, 1994, it focuses on the research and production of new [[biopharmaceutical]] products for the treatment of cancer and other nontransmissible diseases.

==Facilities==
The design and construction of the Center of Molecular Immunology  was modeled on current [[Good Manufacturing Practice]] guidelines recommended by the [[World Health Organization]] and adopted by Cuba, particularly those also adopted by the member countries of the European Union, then known as the European Community.

Research labs, production areas and administrative offices share the 15,000 square meters of the two floor facility.

Approximately 800 employees work at the CIM, most of them scientists and engineers. These personnel are administratively organized in three main areas: Research and Development, Production, and Quality Assurance.

==Research==
Basic research projects are focused on [[cancer immunotherapy]], especially the development of molecular vaccines. These include [[antibody]] engineering, cellular engineering, [[bioinformatics]] and regulation of the [[immune response]].

CIM conducts clinical trials in diagnostic imaging and cancer therapy of varying origin, as well as other immune system diseases, in highly specialized hospitals.

In August 2011 it was announced that the Center of Molecular Immunology released [[CimaVax-EGF]], the first therapeutic [[cancer vaccine]] for [[lung cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2011-09/cuba-releases-worlds-first-lung-cancer-vaccine|title=Cuba Announces Release of the World's First Lung Cancer Vaccine|publisher=PopSci|date=2011-08-09|accessdate=2011-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, a new therapeutic cancer vaccine was approved by Cuban regulatory agency. CIMAbid (racotumomab or 1E10)obtained conditional approval for the treatment of lung cancer. This vaccine is an antiidiotypic vaccine targeting N-glicolil GM3, a tumor specific antigen. The project leader was Dr Ana María Vazquez. These vaccine has been associated with statistically significant extension of survival of lung cancer patients  with excellent safety profile and continues to be investigated in confirmatory clinical trials. {{cn|date=April 2018}}

==Products==

Today CIM produces biopharmaceutical products, such as anti-CD3 [[monoclonal antibody]] for the treatment of patients with organ [[transplant rejection]], human recombinant [[erythropoietin]] for the treatment of [[anemia]], [[granulocyte colony-stimulating factor]] for the treatment of [[neutropenia]], and a humanized monoclonal antibody that recognizes the epidermal growth factor receptor for cancer treatment, as well as other monoclonal antibodies for [[tumor]] imaging.

==Commercialization==

Since 1992 [https://web.archive.org/web/20120211235944/http://www.cimab-sa.com/ CIMAB S.A.] has been devoted to the commercialization of [[biopharmaceutical]] products for the [[Cuba]]n market and abroad, especially [[monoclonal antibodies]] and other recombinant proteins for the diagnosis and treatment of [[cancer]] and other diseases related to the [[immune system]].

[https://web.archive.org/web/20120211235944/http://www.cimab-sa.com/ CIMAB S.A.] is the exclusive representative for the commercialization of the products and services of the Center of Molecular Immunology.

It was announced in July 2008 that CIM had also received approval from the Cuban regulatory authorities for a lung cancer vaccine, targeting EGFR.  The vaccine has been in development since 1992 and the project led by Gisela Gonzalez.

In [[engineering]], '''compensation''' is planning for [[unintened consequence|side effect]]s or other unintended issues in a [[design]]. In a more simpler term, it's a "counter-procedure" plan on expected side effect performed to produce more efficient and useful results.  The design of an [[invention]] can itself also be to compensate for some other existing issue or [[Action (philosophy)|exception]].

One example is in a [[voltage-controlled oscillator|voltage-controlled crystal oscillator]] (VCXO), which is normally affected not only by [[voltage]], but to a lesser extent by [[temperature]].  A temperature-compensated version (a TCVCXO) is designed so that [[heat]] buildup within the [[enclosure (engineering)|enclosure]] of a [[transmitter]] or other such [[machine|device]] will not alter the [[piezoelectric effect]], thereby causing [[frequency drift]].

Another example is [[motion compensation]] on [[digital camera]]s and [[video camera]]s, which keep a picture steady and not blurry.

Other examples in [[electrical engineering]] include:
* A [[voltage source|constant voltage]] device compensates for low or high voltage in an [[electrical circuit]], keeping its output the same within a given [[interval (mathematics)|range]] of input.
* [[Error correction]] compensates for [[data corruption]].
* [[Gray coding]] compensates for errors on [[rotary encoder]]s and [[linear encoder]]s.
* Debouncing compensates for [[jitter]] in an [[electrical]] [[switch]] (see Contact Bounce section in Switch article).
* A [[resistor]] or [[inductor]] compensates for [[negative resistance]] in [[gas-discharge lamp|gas-discharge lighting]].
* [[Frequency compensation]] is used in [[feedback]] [[control systems]] to avert oscillations.

There are also examples in [[civil engineering]]:
* [[Expansion joint]]s in [[sidewalk]]s, [[building]]s, and [[bridge]]s compensate for [[Thermal expansion|expansion]] and [[Thermal expansion|contraction]].
* Various devices between a [[structure]] and its [[Foundation (architecture)|Foundation]] compensate for [[earthquake]] movements, either actively or passively.

== Railways ==

* On railways, steep gradients on sharp curves have an equivalent gradient slightly steeper than the stated value.  This is because of extra friction of the wheel on the rails, and because wagons stretch out on the chord rather than on the arc, and may thus cause trains to stall.  To '''compensate''', the gradient of [[ruling grade]]s is slightly reduced from say 1 in 50 to 1 in 53.

A '''credit card''' is a [[payment card]]  issued to users (cardholders) to enable the cardholder to pay a merchant for [[goods and services]] based on the cardholder's promise to the [[credit card issuer|card issuer]] to pay them for the amounts so paid plus the other agreed charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In other words, credit cards combine payment services with extensions of credit.&lt;ref name="BAP"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Effect of BAPCPA on Credit Card Industry Profits and Prices|journal=American Bankruptcy Law Journal|date=2009|volume=83|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1157158}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Complex fee structures in the credit card industry may limit customers' ability to comparison shop, helping to ensure that the industry is not price-competitive and helping to maximize industry profits.  Due to concerns about this, many legislatures have regulated credit card fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Credit Card Reform and Bankruptcy Reform|journal=Norton Bankruptcy Advisor|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1563456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A credit card is different from a [[charge card]], which requires the balance to be repaid in full each month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Schneider | first = Gary | title = Electronic Commerce | publisher = Course Technology | location = Cambridge | year = 2010 | isbn = 0-538-46924-2 | page=497}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, credit cards allow the consumers a continuing balance of debt, subject to [[credit card interest|interest]] being charged. A credit card also differs from a [[cash card]], which can be used like currency by the owner of the card. A credit card differs from a charge card also in that a credit card  typically involves a third-party entity that pays the seller and is reimbursed by the buyer, whereas a charge card simply defers payment by the buyer until a later date.
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Technical specifications==
The size of most credit cards is 85.60&amp;nbsp;mm × 53.98&amp;nbsp;mm ({{frac|3|3|8}}&amp;nbsp;× {{frac|2|1|8}}&amp;nbsp; inches) and rounded corners with a radius of 2.88–3.48&amp;nbsp;mm,&lt;ref&gt;ISO/IEC 7810:2003, clause 5, Dimensions of card&lt;/ref&gt; conforming to the [[ISO/IEC 7810#ID-1|ISO/IEC 7810 ID-1]] standard, the same size as [[ATM card]]s and other [[payment card]]s, such as [[debit card]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=31432 ISO/IEC 7810:2003 ''Identification cards — Physical characteristics'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Credit cards have a printed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mastercard.com/ca/merchant/en/solutions/unembossed.html|title=For Merchants - MasterCard Unembossed|work=MasterCard}}&lt;/ref&gt; or embossed [[bank card number]] complying with the [[ISO/IEC 7812]] numbering standard. The card number's ''prefix'', called the [[Bank Identification Number]], is the sequence of digits at the beginning of the number that determine the bank to which a credit card number belongs. This is the first six digits for MasterCard and Visa cards. The next nine digits are the individual account number, and the final digit is a validity check code.

Both of these standards are maintained and further developed by [[ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 17/WG 1]]. Credit cards have a [[Magnetic stripe card|magnetic stripe]] conforming to the [[ISO/IEC 7813]]. Many modern credit cards have a [[EMV|computer chip]] embedded in them as a security feature.

In addition to the main credit card number, credit cards also carry issue and expiration dates (given to the nearest month), as well as extra codes such as issue numbers and [[Card Security Code|security codes]]. Not all credit cards have the same sets of extra codes nor do they use the same number of digits.

Credit card numbers were originally embossed to allow easy transfer of the number to charge slips.  With the decline of paper slips, some credit cards are no longer embossed and in fact the card number is no longer in the front.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dunaway|first1=Jaime|title=Why Are Credit Card Numbers on the Back Now?|url=https://slate.com/business/2018/04/why-are-credit-card-numbers-on-the-back-of-the-card-now.html|accessdate=18 April 2018|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Edward Bellamy's ''Looking Backward''===
The concept of using a card for purchases was described in 1887 by [[Edward Bellamy]] in his utopian novel ''[[Looking Backward]]''. Bellamy used the term ''credit card'' eleven times in this novel, although this referred to a card for spending a [[citizen's dividend]] from the government, rather than borrowing,&lt;ref&gt;(Chapters 9, 10, 11, 13, 25 and 26) and three times (Chapters 4, 8 and 19) in its sequel, ''Equality''&lt;/ref&gt; making it more similar to a [[Debit card]].

===Charge coins, medals, and so on===
Charge coins and other similar items were used from the late 19th century to the 1930s. They came in various shapes and sizes; with materials made out of [[celluloid]] (an early type of plastic), copper, aluminum, steel, and other types of whitish metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/credit-collectible-coins-charge-plate-1264.php|title=Life before plastic: Historical look at credit card materials|work=creditcards.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each charge coin usually had a little hole, enabling it to be put in a key ring, like a key. These charge coins were usually given to customers who had charge accounts in department stores, hotels, and so on. A charge coin usually had the charge account number along with the merchant's name and logo.

The charge coin offered a simple and fast way to copy a charge account number to the sales slip, by imprinting the coin onto the sales slip. This sped the process of copying, previously done by [[handwriting]]. It also reduced the number of errors, by having a standardised form of numbers on the sales slip, instead of various kind of handwriting style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shoppingdaysinretroboston.blogspot.com/2013/03/charge-coins-come-to-retro-boston.html|title=Shopping Days In Retro Boston|author=Charles Boston|work=shoppingdaysinretroboston.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the customer's name was not on the charge coin, almost anyone could use it. This sometimes led to a case of mistaken identity, either accidentally or intentionally, by acting on behalf of the charge account owner or out of malice to defraud both the charge account owner and the merchant. Beginning in the 1930s, merchants started to move from charge coins to the newer Charga-Plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://departmentstoremuseum.blogspot.com/2010/11/charge-cards.html|title=The Department Store Museum: Charge Cards|work=departmentstoremuseum.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early charge cards===
====Charga-Plate====
The Charga-Plate, developed in 1928, was an early predecessor of the credit card and was used in the U.S. from the 1930s to the late 1950s. It was a 2½" × 1¼"  rectangle of sheet metal related to [[Addressograph]] and military [[Dog tag (identifier)|dog tag]] systems. It was embossed with the customer's name, city, and state&lt;!-- Yes, no street address --&gt;. It held a small paper card on its back for a signature. In recording a purchase, the plate was laid into a recess in the imprinter, with a paper "charge slip" positioned on top of it. The record of the transaction included an impression of the embossed information, made by the imprinter pressing an [[typewriter ribbon|inked ribbon]] against the charge slip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cultureandcommunication.org/deadmedia/index.php/Credit_Card_Imprinter |title=Credit card imprinter |publisher=Cultureandcommunication.org |accessdate=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charga-Plate was a trademark of Farrington Manufacturing Co.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hartford Charga-plate Associates, Incorporated, Plaintiff-appellant, v. Youth Centre-cinderella Stores, Inc., Defendant-respondent, 215 F.2d 668 (1954)|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/215/668/55263/|accessdate=11 November 2014|quote=The only approach to any of this was an original contention by plaintiff's manufacturer, the Farrington Manufacturing Company, that defendant was violating its registered trade-mark 'Charga-Plate.' But defendant thereafter instructed its clerks to use some other term, e.g., 'charge plate' or 'credit plate,' and no claim of trade-mark infringement is before us.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charga-Plates were issued by large-scale merchants to their regular customers, much like department store credit cards of today. In some cases, the plates were kept in the issuing store rather than held by customers. When an authorized user made a purchase, a clerk retrieved the plate from the store's files and then processed the purchase. Charga-Plates speeded back-office bookkeeping and reduced copying errors that were done manually in paper ledgers in each store.

===={{anchor|Air Travel Card}}Air Travel Card====
In 1934, [[American Airlines]] and the [[Air Transport Association]] simplified the process even more with the advent of the [[Universal Air Travel Plan|Air Travel Card]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=The Travel Card that gave "CREDIT" to the public |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aXIHl--RuqkC&amp;pg=PA11 |magazine=[[Flying (magazine)|Flying]] |date=June 1953 |volume=52 |issue=6 |page=11 |access-date=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They created a numbering scheme that identified the issuer of the card as well as the customer account. This is the reason the modern [[Universal Air Travel Plan|UATP]] cards still start with the number 1. With an Air Travel Card, passengers could "buy now, and pay later" for a ticket against their credit and receive a fifteen percent discount at any of the accepting airlines. By the 1940s, all of the major US airlines offered Air Travel Cards that could be used on 17 different airlines. By 1941, about half of the airlines' revenues came through the Air Travel Card agreement. The airlines had also started offering installment plans to lure new travelers into the air. In October 1948, the Air Travel Card became the first internationally valid charge card within all members of the [[International Air Transport Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creditcardprocessingspace.com/history-of-the-credit-card/ |title=History Of The Credit Card |publisher=www.creditcardprocessingspace.com |accessdate=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Early general purpose charge cards: Diners Club, Carte Blanche, and American Express====
The concept of customers paying different merchants using the same card was expanded in 1950 by Ralph Schneider and [[Frank X. McNamara|Frank McNamara]], founders of [[Diners Club]], to consolidate multiple cards. The Diners Club, which was created partially through a merger with Dine and Sign, produced the first "general purpose" [[charge card]] and required the entire bill to be paid with each statement. That was followed by [[Carte Blanche (credit card)#Carte Blanche|Carte Blanche]] and in 1958 by [[American Express]] which created a worldwide credit card network (although these were initially charge cards that later acquired credit card features).

===BankAmericard and Master Charge===
[[File:Mastercharge_and_Bankamericard.jpg|thumb|right|Metal signs at a plant nursery in Los Angeles County, California marketing Mastercharge and Bankamericard]]
Until 1958, no one had been able to successfully establish a ''revolving credit'' financial system in which a card issued by a third-party bank was being generally accepted by a large number of merchants, as opposed to merchant-issued revolving cards accepted by only a few merchants. There had been a dozen attempts by small American banks, but none of them were able to last very long. In September 1958, [[Bank of America]] launched the ''BankAmericard'' in [[Fresno, California]], which would become the first successful recognizably modern credit card. This card succeeded where others failed by breaking the chicken-and-egg cycle in which consumers did not want to use a card that few merchants would accept and merchants did not want to accept a card that few consumers used. Bank of America chose Fresno because 45% of its residents used the bank, and by sending a card to 60,000 Fresno residents at once, the bank was able to convince merchants to accept the card.&lt;ref name=pricenomics&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mayyasi|first1=Alex|title=How Credit Cards Tax America|url=http://priceonomics.com/how-credit-cards-tax-america/|website=Pricenomics}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was eventually licensed to other banks around the United States and then around the world, and in 1976, all BankAmericard licensees united themselves under the common brand [[Visa Inc.|Visa]]. In 1966, the ancestor of [[MasterCard]] was born when a group of banks established Master Charge to compete with BankAmericard; it received a significant boost when [[Citibank]] merged its own [[Everything Card]], launched in 1967, into Master Charge in 1969.

Early credit cards in the U.S., of which BankAmericard was the most prominent example, were mass-produced and mass mailed unsolicited to bank customers who were thought to be good credit risks. They have been mailed off to unemployables, drunks, narcotics addicts and to compulsive debtors, a process President Johnson's Special Assistant [[Betty Furness]] found very like "giving sugar to [[diabetics]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = O'Neill, Paul | title = A Little Gift from Your Friendly Banker | journal = [[Life (magazine)|LIFE]] | date = 27 April 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; These mass mailings were known as "drops" in banking terminology, and were outlawed in 1970 due to the financial chaos they caused. However, by the time the law came into effect, approximately 100 million credit cards had been dropped into the U.S. population. After 1970, only credit card applications could be sent unsolicited in mass mailings.

Before the computerization of credit card systems in America, using a credit card to pay at a merchant was significantly more complicated than it is today. Each time a consumer wanted to use a credit card, the merchant would have to call their bank, who in turn had to call the credit card company, which then had to have an employee manually look up the customer's name and credit balance. This system was computerized in 1973 under the leadership of [[Dee Hock]], the first CEO of Visa, allowing transaction time to decrease substantially to less than one minute.&lt;ref name="pricenomics" /&gt;  However, until always-connected [[payment terminal]]s became ubiquitous at the beginning of the 21st century, it was common for a merchant to accept a charge, especially below a threshold value or from a known and trusted customer, without verifying it by phone.  Books with lists of stolen card numbers were distributed to merchants who were supposed in any case to check cards against the list before accepting them, as well as verifying the signature on the charge slip against that on the card.   Merchants who failed to take the time to follow the proper verification procedures were liable for fraudulent charges, but because of the cumbersome nature of the procedures, merchants would often simply skip some or all of them and assume the risk for smaller transactions.

===Development outside North America===
The fractured nature of the U.S. banking system under the [[Glass–Steagall Act]] meant that credit cards became an effective way for those who were traveling around the country to move their credit to places where they could not directly use their banking facilities. There are now countless variations on the basic concept of revolving credit for individuals (as issued by banks and honored by a network of financial institutions), including organization-branded credit cards, corporate-user credit cards, store cards and so on.

In 1966, [[Barclaycard]] in the [[United Kingdom]] launched the first credit card outside the United States.

Although credit cards reached very high adoption levels in the US, Canada and the UK during the latter 20th century, many cultures were more cash-oriented or developed alternative forms of cashless payments, such as [[Carte Bleue|Carte bleue]] or the [[Eurocard (payment card)|Eurocard]] (Germany, France, Switzerland, and others). In these places, adoption of credit cards was initially much slower. Due to strict regulations regarding bank overdrafts, some countries, France in particular, were much quicker to develop and adopt chip-based credit cards which are seen as major anti-fraud credit devices. [[Debit card]]s and [[online banking]] (using either [[Automated teller machine|ATM]]s or PCs{{clarify|date=August 2015}}) are used more widely than credit cards in some countries. It took until the 1990s to reach anything like the percentage market penetration levels achieved in the US, Canada, and UK. In some countries, acceptance still remains low as the use of a credit card system depends on the banking system of each country; while in others, a country sometimes had to develop its own credit card network, e.g. UK's Barclaycard and [[Australia]]'s [[Bankcard]]. [[Japan]] remains a very cash-oriented society, with credit card adoption being limited mainly to the largest of merchants; although stored value cards (such as [[telephone cards]]) are used as [[Telephone token|alternative currencies]], the trend is toward [[RFID]]-based systems inside cards, cellphones, and other objects.

===Vintage, old, and unique credit cards as collectibles===
The design of the credit card itself has become a major selling point in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-latest-american-status-symbol-metal-credit-cards-2017-04-25|title=Metal credit cards: The latest American status symbol|last=LaMagna|first=Maria|work=MarketWatch|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The value of the card to the issuer is often related to the customer's usage of the card, or to the customer's financial worth. This has led to the rise of Co-Brand and [[Affinity credit card|Affinity]] cards, where the card design is related to the "affinity" (a university or professional society, for example) leading to higher card usage. In most cases a percentage of the value of the card is returned to the affinity group.

A growing field of [[numismatics]] (study of money), or more specifically [[exonumia]] (study of money-like objects), credit card collectors seek to collect various embodiments of credit from the now familiar plastic cards to older paper merchant cards, and even [[metal]] tokens that were accepted as merchant credit cards. Early credit cards were made of [[celluloid]] plastic, then metal and [[fiber]], then paper, and are now mostly [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC) plastic.
However the chip part of credit cards is not made from plastic but from metals.

==Usage==
A credit card issuing company, such as a bank or credit union, enters into agreements with merchants for them to accept their credit cards. Merchants often advertise which cards they accept by displaying [[acceptance mark]]s – generally derived from logos – or this may be communicated in signage in the establishment or in company material (e.g., a restaurant's menu may indicate which credit cards are accepted). Merchants may also communicate this orally, as in "We take (brands X, Y, and Z)" or "We don't take credit cards".
[[File:Credit card logos (2015-12-1816-27-350044).jpg|thumbnail|upright|right|[[Visa credit card|Visa]], [[MasterCard]], [[American Express]]]]
The credit card issuer issues a credit card to a customer at the time or after an account has been approved by the credit provider, which need not be the same entity as the card issuer. The cardholders can then use it to make purchases at merchants accepting that card. When a purchase is made, the cardholder agrees to pay the card issuer. The cardholder indicates consent to pay by signing a [[receipt]] with a record of the card details and indicating the amount to be paid or by entering a [[personal identification number]] (PIN). Also, many merchants now accept verbal authorizations via telephone and electronic authorization using the Internet, known as a [[card not present transaction]] (CNP).

[[Electronics|Electronic]] [[Credit card verification|verification]] systems allow merchants to verify in a few seconds that the card is valid and the cardholder has sufficient credit to cover the purchase, allowing the verification to happen at time of purchase. The verification is performed using a [[credit card terminal|credit card payment terminal]] or [[point of sale|point-of-sale]] (POS) system with a communications link to the merchant's acquiring bank. Data from the card is obtained from a [[Magnetic stripe card|magnetic stripe]] or [[Smart card|chip]] on the card; the latter system is called [[Chip and PIN]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]], and is implemented as an [[EMV]] card.

For [[card not present transaction]]s where the card is not shown (e.g., [[Electronic commerce|e-commerce]], [[mail order]], and telephone sales), merchants additionally verify that the customer is in physical possession of the card and is the authorized user by asking for additional information such as the [[Card Security Code|security code]] printed on the back of the card, date of expiry, and billing address.

Each month, the cardholder is sent a statement indicating the purchases made with the card, any outstanding fees, and the total amount owed. In the US, after receiving the statement, the cardholder may dispute any charges that he or she thinks are incorrect (see {{USC|15|1643}}, which limits cardholder liability for unauthorized use of a credit card to $50). The [[Fair Credit Billing Act]] gives details of the US regulations. The cardholder must pay a defined minimum portion of the amount owed by a due date, or may choose to pay a higher amount. The credit issuer charges [[interest]] on the unpaid balance if the billed amount is not paid in full (typically at a much higher rate than most other forms of debt). In addition, if the cardholder fails to make at least the minimum payment by the due date, the issuer may impose a [[late fee]] or other penalties. To help mitigate this, some financial institutions can arrange for automatic payments to be deducted from the cardholder's bank account, thus avoiding such penalties altogether, as long as the cardholder has sufficient funds.

Many banks now also offer the option of electronic statements, either in lieu of or in addition to physical statements, which can be viewed at any time by the cardholder via the issuer's [[online banking]] website. Notification of the availability of a new statement is generally sent to the cardholder's email address. If the card issuer has chosen to allow it, the cardholder may have other options for payment besides a physical check, such as an electronic transfer of funds from a checking account. Depending on the issuer, the cardholder may also be able to make multiple payments during a single statement period, possibly enabling him or her to utilize the credit limit on the card several times.

===Advertising, solicitation, application and approval===
Credit card advertising regulations in the US include the [[Schumer box]] disclosure requirements. A large fraction of junk mail consists of credit card offers created from lists provided by the major [[credit reporting agency|credit reporting agencies]]. In the United States, the three major US credit bureaus ([[Equifax]], [[TransUnion]] and [[Experian]]) allow consumers to opt out from related credit card solicitation offers via its [[Optoutprescreen.com|Opt Out Pre Screen]] program.

===Interest charges===
Credit card issuers usually waive interest charges if the balance is paid in full each month, but typically will charge full interest on the entire outstanding balance from the date of each purchase if the total balance is not paid.

For example, if a user had a $1,000 transaction and repaid it in full within this grace period, there would be no interest charged. If, however, even $1.00 of the total amount remained unpaid, interest would be charged on the $1,000 from the date of purchase until the payment is received. The precise manner in which interest is charged is usually detailed in a cardholder agreement which may be summarized on the back of the monthly statement. The general calculation formula most financial institutions use to determine the amount of interest to be charged is (APR/100 x ADB)/365 x number of days revolved. Take the [[annual percentage rate]] (APR) and divide by 100 then multiply to the amount of the average daily balance (ADB).  Divide the result by 365 and then take this total and multiply by the total number of days the amount revolved before payment was made on the account. Financial institutions refer to interest charged back to the original time of the transaction and up to the time a payment was made, if not in full, as a residual retail finance charge (RRFC). Thus after an amount has revolved and a payment has been made, the user of the card will still receive interest charges on their statement after paying the next statement in full (in fact the statement may only have a charge for interest that collected up until the date the full balance was paid, i.e. when the balance stopped revolving).

The credit card may simply serve as a form of [[revolving credit]], or it may become a complicated financial instrument with multiple balance segments each at a different interest rate, possibly with a single umbrella credit limit, or with separate credit limits applicable to the various balance segments. Usually this compartmentalization is the result of special incentive offers from the issuing bank, to encourage [[balance transfer]]s from cards of other issuers. In the event that several interest rates apply to various balance segments, payment allocation is generally at the discretion of the issuing bank, and payments will therefore usually be allocated towards the lowest rate balances until paid in full before any money is paid towards higher rate balances. [[Interest rate]]s can vary considerably from card to card, and the interest rate on a particular card may jump dramatically if the card user is late with a payment on that card ''or any other credit instrument'', or even if the issuing bank decides to raise its revenue.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Grace period===
A credit card's grace period is the time the cardholder has to pay the balance before interest is assessed on the outstanding balance. Grace periods may vary, but usually range from 20 to 55 days depending on the type of credit card and the issuing bank. Some policies allow for reinstatement after certain conditions are met.

Usually, if a cardholder is late paying the balance, finance charges will be calculated and the grace period does not apply. Finance charges incurred depend on the grace period and balance; with most credit cards there is no grace period if there is any outstanding balance from the previous billing cycle or statement (i.e. interest is applied on both the previous balance and new transactions). However, there are some credit cards that will only apply finance charge on the previous or old balance, excluding new transactions.

===Parties involved===
* Cardholder: The holder of the card used to make a purchase; the [[consumer]].
* Card-issuing bank: The financial institution or other organization that issued the credit card to the cardholder. This bank bills the consumer for repayment and bears the risk that the card is used fraudulently. American Express and Discover were previously the only card-issuing banks for their respective brands, but as of 2007, this is no longer the case. Cards issued by banks to cardholders in a different country are known as [[offshore credit card]]s.
* Merchant: The individual or business accepting credit card payments for products or services sold to the cardholder.
* [[Acquiring bank]]: The financial institution accepting payment for the products or services on behalf of the merchant.
* [[Independent sales organization]]: Resellers (to merchants) of the services of the acquiring bank.
* [[Merchant account]]: This could refer to the acquiring bank or the independent sales organization, but in general is the organization that the merchant deals with.
* Credit Card association: An association of card-issuing banks such as [[Discover Card|Discover]], [[Visa (company)|Visa]], [[MasterCard]], [[American Express]], etc. that set transaction terms for merchants, card-issuing banks, and acquiring banks.
* Transaction network: The system that implements the mechanics of the electronic transactions. May be operated by an independent company, and one company may operate multiple networks.
* Affinity partner: Some institutions lend their names to an issuer to attract customers that have a strong relationship with that institution, and get paid a fee or a percentage of the balance for each card issued using their name. Examples of typical affinity partners are sports teams, universities, charities, professional organizations, and major retailers.
* Insurance providers: Insurers underwriting various insurance protections offered as credit card perks, for example, Car Rental Insurance, Purchase Security, Hotel Burglary Insurance, Travel Medical Protection etc.

The flow of information and money between these parties — always through the card associations — is known as the interchange, and it consists of a few steps.

===Transaction steps===
* '''[[Authorization hold|Authorization]]''': The cardholder presents the card as payment to the merchant and the merchant submits the transaction to the acquirer (acquiring bank). The acquirer verifies the credit card number, the transaction type and the amount with the issuer (card-issuing bank) and reserves that amount of the cardholder's credit limit for the merchant. An authorization will generate an approval code, which the merchant stores with the transaction.
* '''Batching''': Authorized transactions are stored in "batches", which are sent to the acquirer. Batches are typically submitted once per day at the end of the business day. If a transaction is not submitted in the batch, the authorization will stay valid for a period determined by the issuer, after which the held amount will be returned to the cardholder's available credit (see [[authorization hold]]). Some transactions may be submitted in the batch without prior authorizations; these are either transactions falling under the merchant's [[floor limit]] or ones where the authorization was unsuccessful but the merchant still attempts to force the transaction through. (Such may be the case when the cardholder is not present but owes the merchant additional money, such as extending a hotel stay or car rental.)
* '''Clearing and Settlement''': The acquirer sends the batch transactions through the credit card association, which debits the issuers for payment and credits the acquirer. Essentially, the issuer pays the acquirer for the transaction.
* '''Funding''': Once the acquirer has been paid, the acquirer pays the merchant. The merchant receives the amount totaling the funds in the batch minus either the "discount rate", "mid-qualified rate", or "non-qualified rate" which are tiers of fees the merchant pays the acquirer for processing the transactions.
* '''Chargebacks''': A [[chargeback]] is an event in which money in a merchant account is held due to a dispute relating to the transaction. Chargebacks are typically initiated by the cardholder. In the event of a chargeback, the issuer returns the transaction to the acquirer for resolution. The acquirer then forwards the chargeback to the merchant, who must either accept the chargeback or contest it.

=== Credit card register ===
A credit card register is a transaction register used to ensure the increasing balance owed from using a credit card is enough below the credit limit to deal with authorization holds and payments not yet received by the bank and to easily look up past transactions for reconciliation and budgeting.

The register is a personal record of banking transactions used for credit card purchases as they affect funds in the bank account or the available credit. In addition to check number and so forth the code column indicates the credit card. The balance column shows available funds after purchases.  When the credit card payment is made the balance already reflects the funds were spent. In a credit card's entry, the deposit column shows the available credit and the payment column shows total owed, their sum being equal to the credit limit.

Each check written, debit card transaction, cash withdrawal, and credit card charge is entered manually into the paper register daily or several times per week.&lt;ref&gt;Little, Ken. 2007. ''Personal Finance At Your Fingertips'',
[https://books.google.com/books?id=uPmUliMCKQwC&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=personal%20credit%20card%20and%20debit%20card%20registers%20or%20transaction%20records&amp;pg=PA35#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true p. 35] Penguin. {{ISBN|144062562X}}, 9781440625626&lt;/ref&gt; Credit card register also refers to one transaction record for each credit card. In this case the booklets readily enable the location of a card’s current available credit when ten or more cards are in use.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Features==
As well as convenient credit, credit cards offer consumers an easy way to track [[expense]]s, which is necessary for both monitoring personal expenditures and the tracking of work-related expenses for [[tax]]ation and [[reimbursement]] purposes. Credit cards are accepted in larger establishments in almost all countries, and are available with a variety of credit limits, repayment arrangements. Some have added perks (such as insurance protection, [[Loyalty program|rewards schemes]] in which points earned by purchasing goods with the card can be redeemed for further [[Good (economics)|goods]] and [[Service (economics)|services]] or [[Cashback reward program|cashback]]).

===Consumers' limited liability===
Some countries, such as the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[France]], limit the amount for which a consumer can be held [[Legal liability|liable]] in the event of fraudulent transactions with a lost or stolen credit card.

==Types==

===Business credit cards===
{{See also|Stored-value card}}
Business credit cards are specialized credit cards issued in the name of a registered business, and typically they can only be used for business purposes. Their use has grown in recent decades. In 1998, for instance, 37% of small businesses reported using a business credit card; by 2009, this number had grown to 64%.&lt;ref name=FedReport&gt;{{cite web|title=Report to the Congress on the Use of Credit Cards by Small Businesses and the Credit Card Market for Small Businesses|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/conferences/sbc_smallbusinesscredit.pdf|website=Federal Reserve|publisher=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System|accessdate=4 May 2015|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Business credit cards offer a number of features specific to businesses. They frequently offer special rewards in areas such as shipping, office supplies, travel, and business technology. Most issuers use the applicant's personal [[credit score]] when evaluating these applications. In addition, income from a variety of sources may be used to qualify, which means these cards may be available to businesses that are newly established.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.allbusiness.com/5-business-credit-card-myths-can-cost-business-109526-1.html|title=5 Business Credit Card Myths That Can Cost Your Business {{!}} AllBusiness.com|date=2016-12-21|work=AllBusiness.com|access-date=2017-04-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, most major issuers of these cards do not report account activity to the owner's personal credit unless there is a default.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} This may have the effect of protecting the owner's personal credit from the activity of the business.

Business credit cards are offered by almost all major card issuers—like American Express, Visa, and MasterCard in addition to local banks and credit unions. Charge cards for businesses, however, are currently only offered by American Express.

===Secured credit cards===
A secured credit card is a type of credit card secured by a [[deposit account]] owned by the cardholder. Typically, the cardholder must deposit between 100% and 200% of the total amount of credit desired. Thus if the cardholder puts down $1,000, they will be given credit in the range of $500–1,000. In some cases, credit card issuers will offer incentives even on their secured card portfolios. In these cases, the deposit required may be significantly less than the required credit limit, and can be as low as 10% of the desired credit limit. This deposit is held in a special [[savings deposit|savings account]]. Credit card issuers offer this because they have noticed that delinquencies were notably reduced when the customer perceives something to lose if the balance is not repaid.

The cardholder of a secured credit card is still expected to make regular payments, as with a regular credit card, but should they default on a payment, the card issuer has the option of recovering the cost of the purchases paid to the merchants out of the deposit. The advantage of the secured card for an individual with negative or no credit history is that most companies report regularly to the major credit bureaus. This allows building a positive credit history.

Although the deposit is in the hands of the credit card issuer as security in the event of default by the consumer, the deposit will not be debited simply for missing one or two payments. Usually the deposit is only used as an offset when the account is closed, either at the request of the customer or due to severe delinquency (150 to 180 days). This means that an account which is less than 150 days delinquent will continue to accrue interest and fees, and could result in a balance which is much higher than the actual credit limit on the card. In these cases the total debt may far exceed the original deposit and the cardholder not only forfeits their deposit but is left with an additional debt.

Most of these conditions are usually described in a cardholder agreement which the cardholder signs when their account is opened.

Secured credit cards are an option to allow a person with a poor [[credit history]] or no credit history to have a credit card which might not otherwise be available. They are often offered as a means of rebuilding one's credit. Fees and service charges for secured credit cards often exceed those charged for ordinary non-secured credit cards. For people in certain situations, (for example, after charging off on other credit cards, or people with a long history of delinquency on various forms of debt), secured cards are almost always more expensive than unsecured credit cards.

Sometimes a credit card will be secured by [[home equity|the equity in the borrower's home]].

===Prepaid cards===
{{See also|Stored-value card}}
A "prepaid credit card" is not a true credit card,&lt;ref name="fcac"/&gt; since no credit is offered by the card issuer: the cardholder spends money which has been "stored" via a prior deposit by the cardholder or someone else, such as a parent or employer. However, it carries a credit-card brand (such as [[Discover Card|Discover]], [[Visa Inc.|Visa]], [[MasterCard]], [[American Express]], or [[Japan Credit Bureau|JCB]]) and can be used in similar ways just as though it were a credit card.&lt;ref name="fcac"/&gt; Unlike debit cards, prepaid credit cards generally do not require a PIN. An exception are prepaid credit cards with an [[EMV]] chip. These cards do require a PIN if the payment is processed via [[Chip and PIN]] technology.

After purchasing the card, the cardholder loads the account with any amount of money, up to the predetermined card limit and then uses the card to make purchases the same way as a typical credit card. Prepaid cards can be issued to minors (above 13) since there is no credit line involved. The main advantage over secured credit cards (see above section) is that the cardholder is not required to come up with $500 or more to open an account. With prepaid credit cards purchasers are not charged any interest but are often charged a purchasing fee plus monthly fees after an arbitrary time period. Many other fees also usually apply to a prepaid card.&lt;ref name="fcac"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/eng/publications/CreditCardsYou/PrepaidCards_e.asp| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307084013/http://www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/eng/publications/CreditCardsYou/PrepaidCards_e.asp| archivedate=7 March 2007| title=Credit Cards and You – About Pre-paid Cards| publisher=[[Financial Consumer Agency of Canada]]| accessdate=9 January 2008}} document: {{cite web| url=http://www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/eng/publications/CreditCardsYou/PDFs/Prepaid-e.pdf| title=Pre-paid Cards| publisher=[[Financial Consumer Agency of Canada]]| format=PDF| accessdate=9 January 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080229122947/http://www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/eng/publications/CreditCardsYou/PDFs/Prepaid-e.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 29 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prepaid credit cards are sometimes marketed to teenagers&lt;ref name="fcac"/&gt; for shopping online without having their parents complete the transaction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.networkworld.com/community/?q=node/11433 "Buy prepaid credit cards without an ID or age limits? … What could go wrong?"]. [[NetworkWorld.com]] Community&lt;/ref&gt; Teenagers can only use funds that are available on the card which helps promote [[financial management]] to reduce the risk of [[debt]] problems later in life.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Prepaid cards can be used globally. The prepaid card is convenient for payees in developing countries like Brazil, Russia, India, and China, where international wire transfers and bank checks are time consuming, complicated and costly.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Because of the many fees that apply to obtaining and using credit-card-branded prepaid cards, the [[Financial Consumer Agency of Canada]] describes them as "an expensive way to spend your own money".&lt;ref name=fcac2006&gt;{{Citation

===Digital cards===
A [[digital card]] is a digital cloud-hosted virtual representation of any kind of identification card or payment card, such as a credit card.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Benefits and drawbacks==

===Benefits to cardholder===
The main benefit to the cardholder is convenience. Compared to debit cards and checks, a credit card allows small short-term loans to be quickly made to a cardholder who need not calculate a balance remaining before every transaction, provided the total charges do not exceed the maximum credit line for the card.

Different countries offer different levels of protection. In the UK, for example, the bank is jointly liable with the merchant for purchases of defective products over £100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theukcardsassociation.org.uk/faqs/index.asp |title=FAQs |publisher=UK Cards Association |accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many credit cards offer rewards and benefits packages, such as enhanced product warranties at no cost, free loss/damage coverage on new purchases, various insurance protections, for example, rental car insurance, common carrier accident protection, and travel medical insurance.

Credit cards can also offer a [[loyalty program]], where each purchase is rewarded with points, which may be redeemed for cash or products. Research has examined whether competition among card networks may potentially make payment rewards too generous, causing higher prices among merchants, thus actually impacting social welfare and its distribution, a situation potentially warranting public policy interventions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kansascityfed.org/PUBLICAT/RESWKPAP/PDF/rwp08-07.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, ''The Economics of Payment Card Fee Structure: What Drives Payment Card Rewards?'', March 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Detriments to cardholders===

====High interest and bankruptcy====
Low introductory credit card rates are limited to a fixed term, usually between 6 and 12 months, after which a higher rate is charged. As all credit cards charge fees and interest, some customers become so indebted to their credit card provider that they are driven to [[bankruptcy]]. Some credit cards often levy a rate of 20 to 30 percent after a payment is missed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=CreditCards.com |url=http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/default-penalty-rates-what-they-are-how-to-avoid-1276.php |title=Credit card penalty rates can top 30 percent; how to avoid them |publisher=Creditcards.com |date=27 January 2010 |accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, a fixed charge is levied without change to the interest rate. In some cases [[universal default]] may apply: the high default rate is applied to a card in good standing by missing a payment on an unrelated account from the same provider. This can lead to a snowball effect in which the consumer is drowned by unexpectedly high interest rates. Further, most card holder agreements enable the issuer to arbitrarily raise the interest rate for any reason they see fit. [[First Premier Bank]] at one point offered a credit card with a 79.9% interest rate;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Prater |first=Connie |url=https://www.foxbusiness.com/features/issuer-of-79-9-interest-rate-credit-card-defends-its-product |title=Issuer of 79.9% interest rate credit card defends its product |publisher=FoxBusiness.com |date=7 April 2010 |accessdate=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, they discontinued this card in February 2011 because of persistent defaults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Ellis|first = Blake|url = http://money.cnn.com/2011/02/16/pf/first_premier_credit_card_removed/|title = First Premier Bank removes credit card with 59.9% APR|publisher = CNN|date = 17 February 2011|accessdate = 1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Complex fee structures in the credit card industry limit customers' ability to comparison shop, help ensure that the industry is not price-competitive and help maximize industry profits.&lt;ref name="Credit Card"&gt;Simkovic, Michael. [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1157158 "The Effect of BAPCPA on Credit Card Industry Profits and Prices"] ''Berkeley Business Law Journal'', Vol. 6, No. 1, Spring 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Research shows that a substantial fraction of consumers (about 40 percent) choose a sub-optimal credit card agreement, with some incurring hundreds of dollars of avoidable interest costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/working_papers/2006/wp2006_11.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, ''Do Consumers Choose the Right Credit Contracts?'', October 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Weakens self regulation====
Several studies have shown that consumers are likely to spend more money when they pay by credit card. Researchers suggest that when people pay using credit cards, they do not experience the abstract pain of payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Drazen Prelec  |author2=George Loewenstein  |lastauthoramp=yes |url=http://mktsci.journal.informs.org/content/17/1/4 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120710142442/http://mktsci.journal.informs.org/content/17/1/4 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 July 2012 |title=The Red and the Black: Mental Accounting of Savings and Debt |publisher=Mktsci.journal.informs.org |date=21 December 1998 |accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, researchers have found that using credit cards can increase consumption of unhealthy food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://moneyland.time.com/2011/07/07/finally-money-advice-that-will-make-you-skinnier/ | title=Finally, Money Advice That Will Make You Skinnier | work=Time | date=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Detriments to society===

====Inflated pricing for all consumers====
Merchants that accept credit cards must pay [[interchange fee]]s and discount fees on all credit-card transactions.&lt;ref name=how&gt;{{cite news |title=How Visa, Using Card Fees, Dominates a Market |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/05/your-money/credit-and-debit-cards/05visa.html?em=&amp;pagewanted=all |quote=The fees, roughly 1 to 3 percent of each purchase, are forwarded to the cardholder’s bank to cover costs and promote the issuance of more Visa cards. |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=4 January 2010 |accessdate=6 January 2010 | first=Andrew | last=Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="money.cnn.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/07/28/news/credit_card_interchange/ | work=CNN | title=Hidden credit card fees are costing you | date=31 July 2008 | accessdate=30 April 2010 | first=Jessica | last=Dickler}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases merchants are barred by their credit agreements from passing these fees directly to credit card customers, or from setting a minimum transaction amount (no longer prohibited in the United States, United Kingdom or Australia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carr |first=Ted |url=http://blog.visa.com/2010/09/02/minimizing-confusion-over-minimums/ |title=Minimizing Confusion Over Minimums |publisher=Blog.visa.com |date=2 September 2010 |accessdate=28 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723235456/http://blog.visa.com/2010/09/02/minimizing-confusion-over-minimums/ |archivedate=23 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is that merchants are induced to charge all customers (including those who do not use credit cards) higher prices to cover the fees on credit card transactions.&lt;ref name="money.cnn.com"/&gt; The inducement can be strong because the merchant's fee is a percentage of the sale price, which has a disproportionate effect on the profitability of businesses that have predominantly credit card transactions, unless compensated for by raising prices generally. In the United States in 2008 credit card companies collected a total of $48 billion in interchange fees, or an average of $427 per family, with an average fee rate of about 2% per transaction.&lt;ref name="money.cnn.com"/&gt;

Credit card rewards result in a total transfer of $1,282 from the average cash payer to the average card payer.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/public-policy-discussion-paper/2010/who-gains-and-who-loses-from-credit-card-payments-theory-and-calibrations.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits to merchants===
[[File:WeTakeCreditDebitCardsCrop.jpg|thumb|right|An example of street markets accepting credit cards. Most simply display the [[acceptance mark]]s (stylized logos, shown in the upper-left corner of the sign) of all the cards they accept.]]
For [[merchants]], a credit card transaction is often more secure than other forms of payment, such as [[cheque]]s, because the issuing bank commits to pay the merchant the moment the transaction is authorized, regardless of whether the consumer defaults on the credit card payment (except for legitimate disputes, which are discussed below, and can result in charges back to the merchant). In most cases, cards are even more secure than cash, because they discourage theft by the merchant's employees and reduce the amount of cash on the premises. Finally, credit cards reduce the back office expense of processing checks/cash and transporting them to the bank.

Prior to credit cards, each merchant had to evaluate each customer's [[credit history]] before extending credit. That task is now performed by the banks which assume the [[credit risk]]. Credit cards can also aid in securing a sale especially if the customer does not have enough cash on hand or in a checking account. Extra turnover is generated by the fact that the customer can purchase goods and services immediately and is less inhibited by the amount of cash in pocket and the immediate state of the customer's bank balance. Much of merchants' marketing is based on this immediacy.

For each purchase, the bank charges the merchant a commission (discount fee) for this service and there may be a certain delay before the agreed payment is received by the merchant. The commission is often a percentage of the transaction amount, plus a fixed fee (interchange rate).

===Costs to merchants===
Merchants are charged several fees for accepting credit cards. The merchant is usually charged a [[commission (remuneration)|commission]] of around 1 to 4 percent of the value of each transaction paid for by credit card.&lt;ref name=gensler2013&gt;{{Citation
 |last=Gensler |first=Lauren |date=April 2013 |title=You (Probably) Won't Pay More to Swipe |magazine=[[Money (magazine)|Money]] |publication-place=New York |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The merchant may also pay a variable charge, called a merchant discount rate, for each transaction.&lt;ref name=how/&gt; In some instances of very low-value transactions, use of credit cards will significantly reduce the [[profit margin]] or cause the merchant to lose money on the transaction. Merchants with very low average transaction prices or very high average transaction prices are more averse to accepting credit cards. In some cases merchants may charge users a "credit card supplement" (or surcharge), either a fixed amount or a percentage, for payment by credit card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmibaby.com/bmibaby/terms_and_conditions/our_top_booking_tips,_baby/fees_and_charges.aspx |title=Example of a supplement chargeable to the customer when paying by credit card |publisher=Bmibaby.com |date=5 January 2011 |accessdate=28 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708074413/http://www.bmibaby.com/bmibaby/terms_and_conditions/our_top_booking_tips%2C_baby/fees_and_charges.aspx |archivedate=8 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice was prohibited by most credit card contracts in the United States until 2013, when a major settlement between merchants and credit card companies allowed merchants to levy surcharges. Most retailers have not started using credit card surcharges, however, for fear of losing customers.&lt;ref name=washpost&gt;{{cite news|last1=Douglas|first1=Danielle|title=Judge approves Visa, MasterCard $5.7 billion settlement with retailers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/us-judge-approves-visa-mastercard-57-billion-credit-card-settlement-with-retailers/2013/12/13/bd42b88c-643a-11e3-aa81-e1dab1360323_story.html|publisher=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Merchants in the United States have been fighting what they consider to be unfairly high fees charged by credit card companies in a series of lawsuits that started in 2005. Merchants charged that the two main credit card processing companies, MasterCard and Visa, used their [[monopoly power]] to levy excessive fees in a class-action lawsuit involving the [[National Retail Federation]] and major retailers such as [[Wal-Mart]]. In December 2013, a federal judge approved a $5.7 billion [[Settlement (litigation)|settlement]] in the case that offered payouts to merchants who had paid credit card fees, the largest antitrust settlement in U.S. history. Some large retailers, such as Wal-Mart and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], chose to not participate in this settlement, however, and have continued their legal fight against the credit card companies.&lt;ref name=washpost /&gt;

Merchants are also required to lease or purchase processing equipment, in some cases this equipment is provided free of charge by the [[Payment processor|processor]]. Merchants must also satisfy data security compliance standards which are highly technical and complicated. In many cases, there is a delay of several days before funds are deposited into a merchant's bank account. Because credit card fee structures are very complicated, smaller merchants are at a disadvantage to analyze and predict fees.

Finally, merchants assume the risk of [[chargebacks]] by consumers.

==Security==
{{Main|Credit card fraud}}
{{See also|Wireless identity theft}}

Credit card security relies on the physical security of the plastic card as well as the privacy of the credit card number. Therefore, whenever a person other than the card owner has access to the card or its number, security is potentially compromised. Once, merchants would often accept credit card numbers without additional verification for mail order purchases. It's now common practice to only ship to confirmed addresses as a security measure to minimise fraudulent purchases. Some merchants will accept a credit card number for in-store purchases, whereupon access to the number allows easy fraud, but many require the card itself to be present, and require a signature (for magnetic stripe cards). A lost or stolen card can be cancelled, and if this is done quickly, will greatly limit the fraud that can take place in this way. European banks can require a cardholder's security PIN be entered for in-person purchases with the card.

The [[Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard]] (PCI DSS) is the security standard issued by the [[Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council]] (PCI SSC). This data security standard is used by acquiring banks to impose cardholder data security measures upon their merchants.

The goal of the credit card companies is not to eliminate fraud, but to "reduce it to manageable levels".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Thrive Business Solutions |url=http://www.thrivesolution.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=28&amp;Itemid=33 |title=PCI Compliance |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305093414/http://www.thrivesolution.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=28&amp;Itemid=33 |archivedate=5 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that fraud prevention measures will be used only if their cost are lower than the potential gains from fraud reduction, whereas high-cost low-return measures will not be used – as would be expected from organizations whose goal is profit maximisation.

[[Internet fraud]] may be by claiming a [[chargeback]] which is not justified ("[[friendly fraud]]"), or carried out by the use of credit card information which can be stolen in many ways, the simplest being copying information from retailers, either [[online]] or [[Off-line|offline]]. Despite efforts to improve security for remote purchases using credit cards, security breaches are usually the result of poor practice by merchants. For example, a website that safely uses [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]] to encrypt card data from a client may then email the data, unencrypted, from the webserver to the merchant; or the merchant may store unencrypted details in a way that allows them to be accessed over the Internet or by a rogue employee; unencrypted card details are always a security risk. Even encrypted data may be cracked.

[[Controlled payment number]]s (also known as virtual credit cards or disposable credit cards) are another option for protecting against credit card fraud where presentation of a physical card is not required, as in telephone and online purchasing. These are one-time use numbers that function as a payment card and are linked to the user's real account, but do not reveal details, and cannot be used for subsequent unauthorised transactions. They can be valid for a relatively short time, and limited to the actual amount of the purchase or a limit set by the user. Their use can be limited to one merchant. If the number given to the merchant is compromised, it will be rejected if an attempt is made to use it a second time.

A similar system of controls can be used on physical cards. Technology provides the option for banks to support many other controls too that can be turned on and off and varied by the credit card owner in real time as circumstances change (i.e., they can change temporal, numerical, geographical and many other parameters on their primary and subsidiary cards). Apart from the obvious benefits of such controls: from a security perspective this means that a customer can have a Chip and PIN card secured for the real world, and limited for use in the home country. In this eventuality a thief stealing the details will be prevented from using these overseas in non chip and pin [[EMV]] countries. Similarly the real card can be restricted from use on-line so that stolen details will be declined if this tried. Then when card users shop online they can use virtual account numbers. In both circumstances an alert system can be built in notifying a user that a fraudulent attempt has been made which breaches their parameters, and can provide data on this in real time.

Additionally, there are security features present on the physical card itself in order to prevent [[counterfeiting]]. For example, most modern credit cards have a [[watermark]] that will fluoresce under [[Wood's lamp|ultraviolet light]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Most major credit cards have a [[hologram]]. A Visa card has a letter V superimposed over the regular Visa logo and a MasterCard has the letters MC across the front of the card. Older Visa cards have a bald eagle or dove across the front. In the aforementioned cases, the security features are only visible under ultraviolet light and are invisible in normal light.

The [[United States Secret Service]], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]], and [[U.S. Postal Inspection Service]] are responsible for prosecuting criminals who engage in [[credit card fraud]] in the United States.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} However, they do not have the resources to pursue all criminals, and in general they only prosecute cases exceeding $5,000.

Three improvements to card security have been introduced to the more common credit card networks, but none has proven to help reduce credit card fraud so far. First, the cards themselves are being replaced with similar-looking tamper-resistant [[smart card]]s which are intended to make [[forgery]] more difficult. The majority of smart card (IC card) based credit cards comply with the [[EMV]] (Europay MasterCard Visa) standard. Second, an additional 3 or 4 digit [[card security code]] (CSC) is now present on the back of most cards, for use in [[card not present transaction]]s. Stakeholders at all levels in electronic payment have recognized the need to develop consistent global standards for security that account for and integrate both current and emerging security technologies. They have begun to address these needs through organisations such as PCI DSS and the [[Secure POS Vendor Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Secure POS Vendor Alliance is launched by Hypercom, Ingenico and VeriFone |url=http://www.ecommerce-journal.com/news/14854_secure_pos_vendor_alliance_is_launched_by_hypercom_ingenico_and_verifone |publisher=ECommerce Journal |year=2009 |postscript= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426033905/http://www.ecommerce-journal.com/news/14854_secure_pos_vendor_alliance_is_launched_by_hypercom_ingenico_and_verifone |archivedate=26 April 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Code 10===
Code 10 calls are made when merchants are suspicious about accepting a credit card.

The operator then asks the merchant a series of YES or NO questions to find out whether the merchant is suspicious of the card or the cardholder. The merchant may be asked to retain the card if it is safe to do so. The merchant may receive a reward for returning a confiscated card to the issuing bank, especially if an arrest is made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usa.visa.com/merchants/risk_management/code.html |title=Code 10 |accessdate=28 November 2012 |publisher=[[Visa Inc.]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115112909/http://usa.visa.com/merchants/risk_management/code.html |archivedate=15 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mastercard.com/uk/merchant/en/security/datasecurityrules/card_id_sec_features.html|title=MasterCard Card Identification Features|accessdate=28 November 2012|publisher=[[MasterCard]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discovernetwork.com/common/pdf/CARD_ID_FEATURES_MERCHANT.pdf|title=CARD_ID_FEATURES_MERCHANT.PDF|accessdate=28 November 2012|publisher=[[Discover Card]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://quiddicompare.co.uk/docs/AmericanExpress_AcceptanceProcedures.pdf|title=American Express Fraud Prevention Handbook|accessdate=11 November 2014|publisher=[[American Express]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Costs==
Credit card issuers (banks) have several types of costs:

===Interest expenses===
Banks generally borrow the money they then lend to their customers. As they receive very low-interest loans from other firms, they may borrow as much as their customers require, while lending their capital to other borrowers at higher rates. If the card issuer charges 15% on money lent to users, and it costs 5% to borrow the money to lend, and the balance sits with the cardholder for a year, the issuer earns 10% on the loan. This 10% difference is the "net interest spread" and the 5% is the "interest expense".

===Operating costs===
This is the [[operating cost|cost of running]] the credit card portfolio, including everything from paying the executives who run the company to printing the plastics, to mailing the statements, to running the computers that keep track of every cardholder's balance, to taking the many phone calls which cardholders place to their issuer, to protecting the customers from fraud rings. Depending on the issuer, marketing programs are also a significant portion of expenses.

===Charge offs===
When a cardholder becomes severely delinquent on a debt (often at the point of six months without payment), the creditor may declare the debt to be a [[charge-off]]. It will then be listed as such on the debtor's credit bureau reports. ([[Equifax]], for instance, lists "R9" in the "status" column to denote a charge-off.)

A charge-off is considered to be "written off as uncollectable". To banks, bad debts and fraud are part of the cost of doing business.

However, the debt is still legally valid, and the creditor can attempt to collect the full amount for the time periods permitted under state law, which is usually three to seven years. This includes contacts from internal collections staff, or more likely, an outside [[collection agency]]. If the amount is large (generally over $1,500–2,000), there is the possibility of a lawsuit or [[arbitration]].

===Rewards===
&lt;!--  Commented out: [[File:CreditCard-AU-Qantas-Cobrands.jpg|right|thumb|[[Qantas Frequent Flyer]] co-branded credit cards]] --&gt;
Many credit card customers receive rewards, such as [[frequent flyer]] points, gift certificates, or [[Cashback reward program|cash back]] as an incentive to use the card. Rewards are generally tied to purchasing an item or service on the card, which may or may not include [[balance transfer]]s, [[Payday loan|cash advances]], or other special uses. Depending on the type of card, rewards will generally cost the issuer between 0.25% and 2.0% of the spread. Networks such as Visa or MasterCard have increased their fees to allow issuers to fund their rewards system. Some issuers discourage redemption by forcing the cardholder to call customer service for rewards. On their servicing website, redeeming awards is usually a feature that is very well hidden by the issuers.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} With a fractured and competitive environment, rewards points cut dramatically into an issuer's bottom line, and rewards points and related incentives must be carefully managed to ensure a profitable [[portfolio (finance)|portfolio]]. Unlike unused gift cards, in whose case the [[breakage]] in certain US states goes to the state's treasury, unredeemed credit card points are retained by the issuer.

===Fraud===
{{Main|Credit card fraud}}
In relative numbers the values lost in bank card fraud are minor, calculated in 2006 at 7 cents per 100 dollars worth of transactions (7 [[basis point]]s).&lt;ref&gt;[http://issaasad.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/mercator-fraud-1208.pdf Credit Card Issuer Fraud Management, Report Highlights, December, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, in the UK, the cost of fraud was over £500 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cardwatch.org.uk/media.asp?sectionid=4&amp;pageid=109 Plastic fraud loss on UK-issued cards 2004/2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616211917/http://www.cardwatch.org.uk/media.asp?sectionid=4&amp;pageid=109 |date=16 June 2006 }}. [[Cardwatch.org.uk]]. site retrieved 7 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; When a card is stolen, or an unauthorized duplicate made, most card issuers will refund some or all of the charges that the customer has received for things they did not buy. These refunds will, in some cases, be at the expense of the merchant, especially in mail order cases where the merchant cannot claim sight of the card. In several countries, merchants will lose the money if no ID card was asked for, therefore merchants usually require ID card in these countries. Credit card companies generally guarantee the merchant will be paid on legitimate transactions regardless of whether the consumer pays their credit card bill.
Most banking services have their own credit card services that handle fraud cases and monitor for any possible attempt at fraud. Employees that are specialized in doing fraud monitoring and investigation are often placed in Risk Management, Fraud and Authorization, or [[Cards and Unsecured Business]]. Fraud monitoring emphasizes minimizing fraud losses while making an attempt to track down those responsible and contain the situation. [[Credit card fraud]] is a major white collar crime that has been around for many decades, even with the advent of the chip based card (EMV) that was put into practice in some countries to prevent cases such as these. Even with the implementation of such measures, credit card fraud continues to be a problem.

==Revenues==
Offsetting the costs are the following revenues:

===Interchange fee===
{{Main|Interchange fee}}

In addition to fees paid by the card holder, merchants must also pay [[interchange fee]]s to the card-issuing bank and the card association.&lt;ref name="S-1"&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000119312507242653/ds1.htm United States Securities and Exchange Commission FORM S-1], 9 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tampa Tribune"&gt;[http://www2.tbo.com/content/2008/feb/15/bz-debit-cards-cash-in-on-rewards-riches/ Debit Cards Cash In On Rewards Riches] ''Tampa Tribune'', 15 February 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228043408/http://www2.tbo.com/content/2008/feb/15/bz-debit-cards-cash-in-on-rewards-riches/ |date=28 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For a typical credit card issuer, interchange fee revenues may represent about a quarter of total revenues.&lt;ref name="FRB"/&gt;

These fees are typically from 1 to 6 percent of each sale, but will vary not only from merchant to merchant (large merchants can negotiate lower rates&lt;ref name="FRB"&gt;[https://www.minneapolisfed.org/pubs/region/06-06/interchange.cfm The Interchange Debate: Issues and Economics] James Lyon, 19 January 2006 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080322001627/https://www.minneapolisfed.org/pubs/region/06-06/interchange.cfm |date=22 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), but also from card to card, with business cards and rewards cards generally costing the merchants more to process. The interchange fee that applies to a particular transaction is also affected by many other variables including: the type of merchant, the merchant's total card sales volume, the merchant's average transaction amount, whether the cards were physically present, how the information required for the transaction was received, the specific type of card, when the transaction was settled, and the authorized and settled transaction amounts. In some cases, merchants add a surcharge to the credit cards to cover the interchange fee, encouraging their customers to instead use [[cash]], [[debit card]]s, or even [[cheque]]s.

===Interest on outstanding balances===
[[Credit card interest|Interest]] charges vary widely from card issuer to card issuer. Often, there are "teaser" rates in effect for initial periods of time (as low as zero percent for, say, six months), whereas regular rates can be as high as 40 percent. In the U.S. there is no federal limit on the interest or late fees credit card issuers can charge; the interest rates are set by the states, with some states such as South Dakota, having no ceiling on interest rates and fees, inviting some banks to establish their credit card operations there. Other states, for example Delaware, have very weak [[usury|usury laws]]. The [[teaser rate]] no longer applies if the customer does not pay their bills on time, and is replaced by a penalty interest rate (for example, 23.99%) that applies retroactively.

===Fees charged to customers===
The major fees are for:
* Late or overdue payments
* Charges that result in exceeding the credit limit on the card (whether deliberately or by mistake), called overlimit fees
* Returned cheque fees or payment processing fees (e.g. phone payment fee)
* Cash advances and convenience cheques (often 3% of the amount)
*Transactions in a foreign currency (as much as 3% of the amount). A few financial institutions do not charge a fee for this.
* Membership fees (annual or monthly), sometimes a percentage of the credit limit.
* Exchange rate loading fees (sometimes these might not be reported on the customer's statement, even when applied).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; The variation of exchange rates applied by different credit cards can be very substantial, as much as 10% according to a [[Lonely Planet]] report in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/tonywheeler/my_lists/why_we_cut_up_our_credit_cards/ |title=Comparison of exchange rates using Visa and Diners Club cards in Bali |publisher=Lonelyplanet.com |date=3 March 2010 |accessdate=28 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711041436/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/tonywheeler/my_lists/why_we_cut_up_our_credit_cards/ |archivedate=11 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., the [[Credit CARD Act of 2009]] specifies that credit card companies must send cardholders a notice 45 days before they can increase or change certain fees. This includes annual fees, cash advance fees, and late fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/consumerinfo/wyntk_creditcardrules.htm |title=Federal Reserve Board: Credit Card Rules |publisher=U.S. Federal Reserve Board |accessdate=27 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106014436/http://www.federalreserve.gov/consumerinfo/wyntk_creditcardrules.htm |archivedate=6 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Over limit charges==
Consumers who keep their account in good order by always staying within their credit limit, and always making at least the minimum monthly payment will see interest as the biggest expense from their card provider. Those who are not so careful and regularly surpass their credit limit or are late in making payments are exposed to multiple charges that were typically as high as £25–35&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/credit-and-loans/article.html?in_article_id=407583&amp;in_page_id=9 |title=This is Money Card charges to be slashed |publisher=Thisismoney.co.uk |date=13 March 2006 |accessdate=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; until a ruling from the [[Office of Fair Trading]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oft.gov.uk/news/press/2006/68-06 |title=Current credit card default charges unfair |publisher=Oft.gov.uk |accessdate=28 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327193555/http://www.oft.gov.uk/news/press/2006/68-06 |archivedate=27 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that they would presume charges over £12 to be unfair which led the majority of card providers to reduce their fees to £12.

===United States===
The [[Credit CARD Act of 2009]] requires that consumers opt into over-limit charges. Some card issuers have therefore commenced solicitations requesting customers to opt into overlimit fees, presenting this as a benefit as it may avoid the possibility of a future transaction being declined. Other issuers have simply discontinued the practice of charging overlimit fees. Whether a customer opts into the overlimit fee or not, banks will in practice have discretion as to whether they choose to authorize transactions above the credit limit or not. Of course, any approved over limit transactions will only result in an overlimit fee for those customers who have opted into the fee. This legislation took effect on 22 February 2010. Following this Act, the companies are now required by law to show on a customer's bills how long it would take them to pay off the balance.

===United Kingdom===
The higher fees originally charged were claimed to be designed to recoup the card operator's overall business costs and to try to ensure that the credit card business as a whole generated a profit, rather than simply recovering the cost to the provider of the limit breach, which has been estimated as typically between £3–£4. Profiting from a customer's mistakes is arguably not permitted under UK common law, if the charges constitute penalties for breach of contract, or under the [[Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999]].

Subsequent rulings in respect of personal current accounts suggest that the argument that these charges are penalties for breach of contract is weak, and given the [[Office of Fair Trading]]'s ruling it seems unlikely that any further test case will take place.

Whilst the law remains in the balance, many consumers have made claims against their credit card providers for the charges that they have incurred, plus interest that they would have earned had the money not been deducted from their account. It is likely that claims for amounts charged in excess of £12 will succeed, but claims for charges at the OFT's £12 threshold level are more contentious.

==Neutral consumer resources==

===Canada===
The Government of Canada maintains a database of the fees, features, interest rates and reward programs of nearly 200 credit cards available in Canada. This database is updated on a quarterly basis with information supplied by the credit card issuing companies. Information in the database is published every quarter on the website of the [[Financial Consumer Agency of Canada]] (FCAC).

Information in the database is published in two formats. It is available in [[PDF]] comparison tables that break down the information according to type of credit card, allowing the reader to compare the features of, for example, all the student credit cards in the database.

The database also feeds into an interactive tool on the FCAC website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itools-ioutils.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/CCS-SCC/CCSearchCriteria.aspx?lang=eng |title=FCAC - Interactive Tools - Credit Card Selector Tool |work=FCAC |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221014248/http://itools-ioutils.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/CCS-SCC/CCSearchCriteria.aspx?lang=eng |archivedate=21 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The interactive tool uses several interview-type questions to build a profile of the user's credit card usage habits and needs, eliminating unsuitable choices based on the profile, so that the user is presented with a small number of credit cards and the ability to carry out detailed comparisons of features, reward programs, interest rates, etc.

==Controversy==
Credit card debt has increased steadily. Since the late 1990s, [[legislator|lawmakers]], [[consumer advocacy group]]s, college officials and other higher education affiliates have become increasingly concerned about the rising use of credit cards among college students. The major credit card companies have been accused of targeting a younger audience, especially college students, many of whom are already in debt with college [[tuition]] fees and college [[loans]] and who typically are less experienced at managing their own finances. Credit card debt may also negatively affect their grades as they are likely to work more both part and full-time positions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Another controversial area is the [[universal default]] feature of many North American credit card contracts. When a cardholder is late paying a particular credit card issuer, that card's interest rate can be raised, often considerably. With universal default, a customer's other credit cards, for which the customer may be current on payments, may also have their rates and credit limit changed. The universal default feature allows creditors to periodically check cardholders' credit portfolios to view trade, allowing these other institutions to decrease the credit limit or increase rates on cardholders who may be late with another credit card issuer. Being late on one credit card will potentially affect all the cardholder's credit cards. [[Citibank]] voluntarily stopped this practice in March 2007 and [[JPMorgan Chase|Chase]] stopped the practice in November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/djf500/200712032215DOWJONESDJONLINE000777_FORTUNE5.htm|title=Senate Report Says Credit Scores Used To Justify Card Rate Hikes|date=3 December 2007| publisher=CNN |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209023905/http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/djf500/200712032215DOWJONESDJONLINE000777_FORTUNE5.htm|archivedate=9 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that credit card companies can change the interest rate on debts that were incurred when a different rate of interest was in place is similar to [[adjustable rate mortgage]]s where interest rates on current debt may rise. However, in both cases, this is agreed to in advance, and is a trade off that allows a lower initial rate as well as the possibility of an even lower rate (mortgages, if interest rates fall) or perpetually keeping a below-market rate (credit cards, if the user makes their debt payments on time). The universal default practice was encouraged by federal regulators, particularly those at the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] (OCC), as a means of managing the changing risk profiles of cardholders.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Another controversial area is the [[trailing interest]] issue. Trailing interest is the practice of charging interest on the entire bill no matter what percentage of it is paid. US Senator [[Carl Levin]] raised the issue of millions of Americans affected by hidden fees, compounding interest and cryptic terms. Their woes were heard in a Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations hearing which was chaired by Senator Levin, who said that he intends to keep the spotlight on credit card companies and that legislative action may be necessary to purge the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joseph S. Enoch |url=http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2007/03/senate_credit_cards02.html |title=Credit Card Executives Tough Out Senate Hearing |publisher=Consumeraffairs.com |accessdate=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the C.A.R.D. Act was signed into law, enacting protections for many of the issues Levin had raised.

In the United States, some have called for [[United States Congress|Congress]] to enact additional regulations on the industry to expand the disclosure box clearly disclosing rate hikes, use plain language, incorporate balance payoff disclosures, and also to outlaw universal default. At a congress hearing around 1 March 2007, [[Citibank]] announced it would no longer practice this, effective immediately. Opponents of such regulation argue that customers must become more proactive and self-responsible in evaluating and negotiating terms with credit providers. Some of the nation's influential top credit card issuers, which are among the top fifty corporate contributors to political campaigns, successfully opposed it.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Hidden costs===
In the United Kingdom, merchants won the right through The Credit Cards (Price Discrimination) Order 1990&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1990/Uksi_19902159_en_1.htm |title=Statutory Instrument 1990 No. 2159: The Credit Cards (Price Discrimination) Order 1990 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |accessdate=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to charge customers different prices according to the payment method. As of 2007, the United Kingdom was one of the world's most credit card-intensive countries, with 2.4 credit cards per consumer, according to the [[APACS|UK Payments Administration Ltd]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apacs.org.uk/resources_publications/card_facts_and_figures.html "Plastic cards in the UK and how we used them in 2007"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225210810/http://www.apacs.org.uk/resources_publications/card_facts_and_figures.html |date=25 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States until 1984, federal law prohibited surcharges on card transactions. Although the federal [[Truth in Lending Act]] provisions that prohibited surcharges expired that year, a number of states have since enacted laws that continue to outlaw the practice; California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Kansas, Massachusetts, Maine, New York, Oklahoma, and Texas have laws against surcharges. As of 2006, the United States probably had one of the world's highest if not the top ratio of credit cards per capita, with 984 million bank-issued Visa and MasterCard credit card and debit card accounts alone for an adult population of roughly 220 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=American FactFinder, United States Census Bureau |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/STTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2007_3YR_G00_S0101&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2007_3YR_G00_ |title=US Census: 2005–2007 American Community Survey 3-Year Estimates |publisher=Factfinder.census.gov |accessdate=28 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426125841/http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/STTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2007_3YR_G00_S0101&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2007_3YR_G00_ |archivedate=26 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The credit card per US capita ratio was nearly 4:1 as of 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalscoreindex.com/ViewAllGraphs.aspx |title=Experian's National Score Index |publisher=Nationalscoreindex.com |accessdate=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as high as 5:1 as of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=4207 |title=Prime Numbers: The Plastic Revolution |publisher=Foreign Policy |date=19 February 2008 |accessdate=28 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115110602/http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=4207 |archivedate=15 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Credit cards in ATMs==
Many credit cards can also be used in an [[Automatic teller machine|ATM]] to withdraw money against the credit limit extended to the card, but many card issuers charge interest on cash advances before they do so on purchases. The interest on cash advances is commonly charged from the date the withdrawal is made, rather than the monthly billing date. Many card issuers levy a commission for cash withdrawals, even if the ATM belongs to the same bank as the card issuer. Merchants do not offer [[debit card cashback|cashback]] on credit card transactions because they would pay a percentage commission of the additional cash amount to their bank or merchant services provider, thereby making it uneconomical. Discover is a notable exception to the above. A customer with a Discover card may get up to $120 cash back if the merchant allows it. This amount is simply added to the card holder's cost of the transaction and no extra fees are charged as the transaction is not considered a cash advance.

Many credit card companies will also, when applying payments to a card, do so, for the matter at hand, at the end of a billing cycle, and apply those payments to everything before cash advances. For this reason, many consumers have large cash balances, which have no grace period and incur interest at a rate that is (usually) higher than the purchase rate, and will carry those balances for years, even if they pay off their statement balance each month.

==Credit cards as funding for entrepreneurs==
Credit cards are a risky way for [[entrepreneur]]s to acquire capital for their start ups when more conventional financing is unavailable. [[Len Bosack]] and [[Sandy Lerner]] used personal credit cards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdp10.nocrew.org/docs/cisco.html |title=A start-up's true tale |publisher=Pdp10.nocrew.org |accessdate=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to start [[Cisco Systems]]. [[Larry Page]] and [[Sergey Brin]]'s start up of [[Google]] was financed by credit cards to buy the necessary computers and office equipment, more specifically "a terabyte of [[hard disks]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/intl/en/corporate/history.html Google About Page under 1998] page retrieved 30 May 2007.{{Failed verification|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, filmmaker [[Robert Townsend (actor)|Robert Townsend]] financed part of ''[[Hollywood Shuffle]]'' using credit cards.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093200/trivia Hollywood Shuffle trivia at IMDB] page retrieved 7 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Director [[Kevin Smith]] funded ''[[Clerks]]'' in part by maxing out several credit cards. Actor [[Richard Hatch (actor)|Richard Hatch]] also financed his production of ''[[Battlestar Galactica: The Second Coming]]'' partly through his credit cards. Famed hedge fund manager [[Bruce Kovner]] began his career (and, later on, his firm [[Caxton Associates]]) in financial markets by borrowing from his credit card. UK entrepreneur [[James Caan (entrepreneur)|James Caan]] (as seen on ''[[Dragons' Den]]'') financed his first business using several credit cards.

==Problems==
Travellers from the U.S. had encountered problems abroad because many countries have introduced [[smart card]]s, but the U.S. had not. {{As of|2010}}, the U.S. banking system had not updated the cards and associated readers in the U.S., stating that the costs were prohibitive. As of 2015, the smart cards had been introduced and put into use in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/travel/news/2010-06-01-1B_travelcreditcard1_ST_N.htm |title=Americans abroad run into trouble using credit cards |work=USA Today| first=Roger |last=Yu |date=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other problems with credit cards have involved mis-sold policies on top of the products, such as the additional mis-sold policies which is still causing problems for clients in the UK.

'''DIVX''' ('''Digital Video Express''') was an unsuccessful attempt by [[Circuit City Stores|Circuit City]] and the [[entertainment law]] firm Ziffren, Brittenham, Branca and Fischer to create an alternative to [[video rental]] in the United States.

==Format==
DIVX was a rental format variation on the [[DVD]] player in which a customer would buy a DIVX disc (similar to a DVD) for approximately US$4.50, which was watchable for up to 48&amp;nbsp;hours from its initial viewing. After this period, the disc could be viewed by paying a continuation fee to play it for two more days. Viewers who wanted to watch a disc an unlimited number of times could convert the disc to a "DIVX silver" disc for an additional fee.&lt;ref name="sfgate"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1999/06/18/BU89741.DTL|author=fost, Dan|date=18 June 1999|title=Divx's Death Pleases Opponents|work=The San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt; "DIVX gold" discs that could be played an unlimited number of times on any DIVX player were announced at the time of DIVX's introduction, but no DIVX gold titles were ever released.

Each DIVX disc was marked with a unique barcode in the [[burst cutting area]] that could be read by the player, and used to track the discs. The status of the discs was monitored through an account over a phone line. DIVX player owners had to set up an account with DIVX to which additional viewing fees could be charged. The player would call an account server over the phone line to charge for viewing fees similar to the way [[DirecTV]] and [[Dish Network]] [[satellite]] systems handle [[pay-per-view]].

In addition to the normal [[Content Scramble System]] (CSS) encryption, DIVX discs used [[Triple DES]] encryption and an alternative channel modulation coding scheme, which prevented them from being read in standard DVD players.&lt;ref name="DVDDM"&gt;{{cite book|title=DVD Demytstified|author1=Jim H. Taylor |author2=Mark R. Johnson |author3=Charles G. Crawford |isbn=0-07-142396-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DIVX players manufactured by [[Zenith Electronics]], Thomson Consumer Electronics ([[RCA]] and [[ProScan]]), and [[Panasonic|Matsushita Electric (Panasonic)]] started to become available in mid-1998. Because of widespread studio support, manufacturers anticipated that demand for the units would be high. Initially, the players were approximately twice as expensive as standard DVD players, but price reductions occurred within months of release, due to [[economies of scale]].

==History==

===Launch===
The initial trial of the DIVX format was run in the [[San Francisco]] and [[Richmond, California]], areas starting on June 8, 1998.&lt;ref name="DVDDM"/&gt; Initially only a single Zenith player was available, along with 19 titles. A nationwide rollout began three months later, on September 25, with players and 150 titles available in 190 stores. In total 87,000 players were sold during 1998, with 535,000 discs across 300 titles being sold.&lt;ref name="DVDDM"/&gt;

DIVX was sold primarily through the [[Circuit City Stores|Circuit City]], [[Good Guys (American electronics chain)|Good Guys]], [[Ultimate Electronics]], and [[Future Shop]] retailers. The format was promoted to consumers as an alternative to traditional video rental schemes with the promise of "No returns, no late fees." Though consumers could just discard a DIVX disc after the initial viewing period, several DIVX retailers maintained DIVX recycling bins on their premises.

By March 1999, around 419 titles were available in the DIVX format.

===Opposition===
A movement on the Internet was initiated against DIVX, particularly in home theater forums. The DIVX catalog of titles was released primarily in [[pan and scan]] format with limited special features, usually only a trailer. This caused many home theater enthusiasts to become concerned that the success of DIVX would significantly diminish the release of films on the DVD format in the films' original [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratios]] and with supplementary material. Many people in various technology and entertainment communities were afraid that there would be DIVX exclusive releases, and that the then-fledgling DVD format would suffer as a result. [[DreamWorks]], [[20th Century Fox]], and [[Paramount Pictures]], for instance, initially released their films exclusively on the DIVX format.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071007094046/http://www.digitalbits.com/articles/oldstudionews/paramount.html] [[The Digital Bits]]: Paramount jumps on DVD wagon; Fox, DreamWorks still out&lt;/ref&gt; DIVX featured stronger encryption technology than DVD ([[Triple DES]]), which many studios stated was a contributing factor in the decision to support DIVX first.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalbits.com/articles/oldstudionews/paramount.html Studio &amp; DVD News - Paramount (link broken as at 18 April 2013)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007094046/http://www.digitalbits.com/articles/oldstudionews/paramount.html |date=October 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the hostile Internet response, competitors such as [[Hollywood Video]] ran advertisements touting the benefits of "Open DVD" over DIVX, with one ad in the [[Los Angeles Times]] depicting a hand holding a telephone line with the caption, "Don't let anyone feed you the line." The terminology "Open DVD" had been used by DVD supporters in response to DIVX's labeling of DVD as "Basic DVD" and DIVX/DVD players as "DIVX-enhanced."

Informational freedom advocates were concerned that the players' "dial-home" ability could be used to spy on people's watching habits.&lt;ref name="sfgate" /&gt;

Allegations of anti-competitive [[vaporware]], as well as concerns within the software industry prompted David Dranove of [[Northwestern University]] and Neil Gandal of [[Tel Aviv University]] and [[University of California, Berkeley]], to conduct an empirical study designed to measure the effect of the DIVX announcement on the [[DVD]] market. This study suggests that the DIVX announcement slowed the adoption of DVD technology. According to Dranove and Gandal, the study suggests that the "general antitrust concern about vaporware seems justified."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://repositories.cdlib.org/iber/cpc/CPC01-016/| title=The DVD vs. DIVX Standard War: Empirical Evidence of Vaporware| first=David| last=Dranove|author2=Neil Gandal|date=1 November 2000| journal=Competition Policy Center| id= Paper CPC01-016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demise===
The format was discontinued on June 16, 1999, because of the costs of introducing the format, as well as its very limited acceptance by the general public. It was shot down by [[Blockbuster LLC|Blockbuster Video]] stores not wanting to carry it.  Also Circuit City announced a $114 million after-tax loss,&lt;ref name="Dan Tynan 2006"/&gt; and [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] estimated the total loss on the scheme was around $337 million.&lt;ref name="DVDDM"/&gt; Over the next two years the DIVX system was phased out. Customers could still view all their DIVX discs and were given a $100 refund for every player that was purchased before June 16, 1999. All discs that were unsold at the end of the summer of 1999 were destroyed. The program officially cut off access to accounts on July 7, 2001. The player's Security Module, which had an internal Real-Time Clock, ceased to allow DIVX functions after 30 days without a connection to the central system. Unsold players were liquidated in online auctions, but not before being modified to remove the DIVX Security Module. As a result, certain player models demonstrated lockups when DIVX menus were accessed.

On the company website to announce discontinuation of the product on June 16, 1999, it stated: "All DIVX-featured DVD players are fully functional DVD players and will continue to operate as such. All DIVX discs, including those previously purchased by consumers and those remaining in retailer inventories, can be viewed on registered players anytime between now and June 30, 2001. Subsequent viewings also will be available during that period. Discs can no longer be upgraded to unlimited viewing, known as DIVX Silver. Customers who have converted discs to DIVX Silver can continue viewing the discs until June 30, 2001, or can receive a full refund of the conversion price at their request".  This meant no DIVX discs could play any content after June 30, 2001, rendering the medium worthless.&lt;ref name="DIVX June 1999 website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://divx.com/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19991013054000/http://divx.com/|title=All About Divx, the latest in DVD technology - the Digital Video Express Official Website|archivedate=13 October 1999|work=divx.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DIVX appeared as a "dishonorable mention" alongside ''[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s list of "25 Worst Tech Products of All Time" in 2006.&lt;ref name="Dan Tynan 2006"&gt;Dan Tynan.

'''''Daktylios''''' ({{lang-el|Δακτύλιος}}, meaning ring) is the name given to the [[Road space rationing|road space rationing or alternate-day travel]] developed for [[Athens]] during the 1990s. Unlike [[congestion pricing]] systems, it does not operate on the basis of drivers paying fees for entering the city centre. Instead, it depends on the [[Parity (mathematics)|parity]] of the date and of the vehicle's registration plate, the vehicle type as well as the time of the week/month.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.odigostoupoliti.eu/daktilios/&lt;/ref&gt;
There are three ''Daktylios'' areas.

==Inner ''Daktylios''==
The Inner ''Daktylios'', which covers the area of the city center, allows vehicles into it depending primarily on the [[Parity (mathematics)|parity]] of the date and of the vehicle's registration plate, the vehicle type as well as the time of the week/month. On odd dates, only vehicles with an odd plate number are allowed to proceed into the ''Daktylios''. On even dates, only cars with even plate numbers are allowed. Lorries and other heavy vehicles are always banned and residents within the Inner ''Daktylios'' area are required to have a special pass that grants them access on all times of the year. The Inner ''Daktylios'' is not valid on weekends, bank holidays and during certain months (usually between July and October), with the dates changing every year depending on the expected levels of traffic.

==Outer ''Daktylios''==
The Outer ''Daktylios'' covers a much wider area and is implemented only during times of extreme congestion or high pollution. It affects only heavy vehicles and certain roads within the area covered are not subjected to the Outer ''Daktylios''{{'}} restrictions.

==Green ''Daktylios''==
The Green ''Daktylios'' is a scheme that allows [[electric cars]], [[hybrid cars]] and all vehicles produced after 2011 that produce less than 140g/km of CO2 access to the Inner ''Daktylios'' anytime.

==Criticism==
The ''Daktylios'' scheme has been criticised{{who|date=April 2016}} for being ineffective, with the primary reason being that many people own two cars, one with odd and one with even plate numbers, granting them daily access and the other one being that it is occasionally violated. However, there are no plans to phase it out or replace it with a congestion pricing system.

'''Data plan''' refers to data quotas from a [[telecommunication]]s or data hosting contract. Data plans are offered by [[internet service provider]]s. These include mobile data plans, offered on [[cellular network]]s, from cellular telephony companies, and those from conventional fixed [[land line]] links, amongst other forms of offered [[data communication]]s. Network data hosting servers also offer plans based on data served, such as for websites.

[[File:Railroad torpedo.jpg|thumb|upright|This illustration from an 1882 ''[[Frank Leslie's Popular Monthly|Leslie's Monthly]]'' portrays an engineer (fireman) finding a torpedo on the track.]]

A railway '''detonator''' ('''torpedo''' in North America) is a coin-sized device that is used as a loud warning signal to [[Railroad engineer|train drivers]]. It is placed on the top of the [[Rail tracks|rail]], usually secured with two lead straps, one on each side. When the wheel of the train passes over, it explodes emitting a loud bang. It was invented in 1841 by English inventor [[Edward Alfred Cowper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01087865|title=Hot-blast stoves — 120 years|first=A. G.|last=Romanenko|publisher=|journal=Metallurgist|volume=22|issue=2|pages=134–136|via=link.springer.com|doi=10.1007/BF01087865}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G2w1AAAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA116&amp;ots=T_zRlC7LMP&amp;dq=%22SOME%20EXPERIMENTS%20ON%20THE%20USE%20OF%20MAROONS%20AS%20SIGNALS%20ON%20RAILWAYS%22&amp;pg=PA116#v=onepage&amp;q=%22SOME%20EXPERIMENTS%20ON%20THE%20USE%20OF%20MAROONS%20AS%20SIGNALS%20ON%20RAILWAYS%22&amp;f=false|title=Minutes of Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers, Volume 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
[[File:Railroad torpedo with lead straps.jpg|thumb|A torpedo on a rail]]
[[File:Pétard sncb.jpg|thumb|A detonator on a railway line in Belgium]]
[[File:Track Detonator.JPG|thumb|South African example]]
Typical uses of detonators include:
* A warning, caution or stop signal in dense fog, when [[Railway signal|signals]] are difficult to see
* A warning of a train stopped on the line ahead by an incident or accident—the train crew are usually responsible for placing the detonators
* A warning of ongoing engineering works ahead
* When a signaller or other railway employee requires to stop approaching trains in an emergency
* To alert crews working on the rails if a silent runaway train or train carriage is approaching

On a high-speed line, detonators may need to be placed on both rails.

As with all [[Explosive material|explosives]], detonators can become unstable over time and must therefore be replaced regularly.

They are triggered by pressure rather than impact. This makes them safe during transport, as they normally cannot detonate in a bag or storage container. Detonating them by striking with a hammer does work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/boy-badly-injured-after-hitting-train-detonator-with-hammer-reports-20120702-21bj3.html|title=Boy badly injured after hitting train detonator with hammer: reports|date=July 2, 2012|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=May 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the United States ===
Upon hearing the noise of a torpedo exploding, the [[Railroad engineer|engineer]] reduces speed to 20&amp;nbsp;mph or less, not resuming its original speed until at least two miles beyond where it encountered the device. They were traditionally used in pairs to ensure that the sound registered with train crews. Torpedoes are essentially obsolete in the U.S. as soundproof construction of modern locomotive cabs renders them useless.

Quoting from the terminology book of the [[Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A torpedo is a device which is strapped to the top of a rail. When a train drives over the torpedo, it emits a very loud "bang" which can be heard over the noise of the engine, and signals the engineer to stop immediately. Torpedoes are generally placed by the flagman when protecting a train ahead.

Torpedoes are about 2" x 2", red in color, about 3/4" high, and have two lead straps attached, which hold it to the rail. The torpedo has discs inside and are filled with detonating powder. The torpedo was invented about 1874.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== In the United Kingdom ===
Defined by the Rule Book, when protecting a line for whatever reason (failed train, obstruction fouling the running lines), three detonators must be placed 20 yards apart. These signal an emergency stop to the driver. Detonators are also used to protect engineering works where the line remains open. The controller of the possession will communicate with the operative with the detonators as to when to place them on the track, or lift them to allow a train through.

=== In Germany ===
Detonators were used where hazards had to be secured and there was no time for other signaling or if there was a danger that another signal might not be recognizable in time, for example due to fog or snow. To give the emergency signal, three detonators were placed in short succession, with the explosion of a single detonator being a stop signal. Since 1986 detonators have no longer been used on German railways. Only the [[ICE 3]] trains that travel to France still have detonators on board because of French regulations.

=== In Taiwan ===
The use of detonators has been superseded by radio communications since the early 1950s. In November 2010, the [[Taiwan Railway Administration]] deployed 800 detonators for destruction on maintenance tracks. It received media attention, emitting sounds similar to the culturally significant [[firecracker]]s.

=== In Australia ===
Today known as audible track warning signals,&lt;ref name=artc&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.artc.com.au/library/TA20_Section_07.pdf |title=TA20 – ARTC Code of Practice for the Victorian Main Line Network |work=artc.com.au |date=August 2011 |accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or audible track warning devices, detonators are used to attract the attention of train crews when track repairs or an obstruction are ahead, or when a hand signaller is acting for a signal.&lt;ref name=artc /&gt;

===In Tanzania===
The Detonators used to attract the attention of train crews in case of;
* Visibility of fixed signal restricted by fog, mist or other circumstance
* obstruction of line, whether by train or otherwise
* protection of push trollies
* protection of shunting movement outside the station limits during total failure of communication

== Detonator placer ==
Many mechanical [[signal box]]es in the [[UK]] were equipped with detonator placers that placed detonators on a running line when a [[Lever frame|lever]] was operated. The levers were painted a striking white and black [[Chevron (insigne)|chevron]] pattern, pointing upwards for the "Up" line, downwards for the "Down" line. In some cases, the placers were fed from a cartridge holding a number of detonators.

== Composition ==
According to ''Military and Civilian Pyrotechnics'' by Ellern, page 376&lt;!--said 368, but strangely doesn't seem to exist, while later and former page numbers are--&gt;, FORMULA 155 – Railroad Torpedo, is by mass:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freeinfosociety.com/media/pdf/4651.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Potassium chlorate]] – 40%
* [[Sulfur]] – 16%
* Sand (—60 [[Mesh (scale)|mesh]]) – 37%
* Binder – 5%
* Neutralizer – 2%

== Garratt locomotives ==
The length of [[Garratt]] locomotives made the sound of a detonator hard to hear, so [[New South Wales 60 class locomotive]] had "sound pipes" to bring the noise of the explosion to the crew.

[[File:Azerat chapelle charpente.JPG|thumb|The diagonal beams are dragon beams. Chapel of Our Lady of Good Hope, Azerat, France]]
'''Dragon beam''' is a horizontal, diagonal [[Beam (structure)|beam]] in the corner(s) of some traditional [[Timber framing|timber framed]] buildings. The term is commonly used in both [[hip roof]] framing and [[jettying]]. Older publications may use the synonyms dragging beam, dragging piece, dragging tie, dragon piece or dragon tie. Inconsistencies in modern usage are discussed below. In French it is called a coyer or enrayure.

==Etymology==
The etymology of dragon is unclear. The term may be descended from German [[:de:Träger|träger]] (a carrier), Danish [[:da:Gitterbro|dragere]] (bearing beam, joist, girder) or Dutch [[:nl:Bint (bouwkunde)|draagbalk]] (beam). The origin has also been proposed as a corruption of diagonal or diagon.&lt;ref&gt;Miles Lewis, "Puncheons and Dragons:Renaissance carpentry and semantics" http://www.mileslewis.net/lectures/04-history-of-building/puncheons-and-dragons.pdf accessed 3/22/2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hip roofs==
The dragon beam lies parallel to and below a hip rafter and carries the rafter. The dragon beam is carried by the wall on the outer end and by a horizontal piece between the two walls on the inside end. There are conflicting usages for this term in the U.K. and U.S.A. (see below). The most common usage seems to be combination dragon beam/cross tie.

'''FoldiMate''' is a California-based company developing a robotic [[laundry]] folding machine.

==History==
Foldimate was founded by Gal Rozov, an [[Israel]]i software engineer who decided that folding laundry was a tedious chore that could be done effectively by a robot.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.co.il/search?q=The+Robot+That+Can+Fold+Your+Laundry+In+Less+Than+Three+Minutes&amp;hl=en-US&amp;sourceid=gd&amp;rlz=1D1GGLD_en-GBIL414IL419The Robot That Can Fold Your Laundry In Less Than Three Minutes]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Rozov quit his job as a software developer and product manager and spent two years developing his laundry-folding device. In 2012, he moved to the United States to work with a robotic team in Silicon Valley. By 2013, he had a patented technology. In 2016, after an initial round of investment, he produced the first  prototype.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fastcompany.com/3068599/the-robot-that-can-fold-your-laundry-in-less-than-three-minutes The robot that can fold your laundry in less than three minutes]&lt;/ref&gt; The  prototype presented at [[CES 2017]] generated much interest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.popsci.com/laundry-tech-robots#page-4 It's 2018 and robots still won't do our laundry, [[Popular Science]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The company exhibited an updated prototype of Foldimate at [[CES 2018]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://time.com/5102585/weirdest-gadgets-ces-2018/ The 9 weirdest gadgets [[Time.com]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, [[BSH Hausgeräte]] expressed an interest in partnering with Foldimate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/02/its-the-new-year-and-youre-getting-laundry-folding-robots-because-the-1960s-thought-of-everything Its the new year and you're getting laundry folding robots because the 1960s thought of everything]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:FoldiMate-with-clothes.png|150px|thumb|FoldiMate prototype]]
The FoldiMate is slightly larger than a standard washing machine. According to the developers, it can fold a full wash in less than 4 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.businessinsider.com/laundry-folding-machine-neatly-stacks-full-wash-in-4-minutes-tech-2018-1 Laundry folding machine neatly stacks full wash in 4 minutes, [[Business Insider]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The user clips the piece of clothing on two hooks and the item is pulled into the machine. Then a series of rollers and arms moves in all directions to straighten and fold it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.extremetech.com/electronics/242215-800-laundry-folding-robot-ces-2017 The $800 laundry-folding robot for those who don't have a housekeeper, [[ExtremeTech]]]&lt;/ref&gt; The machine can fold shirts, tops, trousers and dresses, but not small pieces of clothing like  underwear or large items like  sheets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/gadgets/2016/06/02/many-reasons-not-buy-laundry-folding-machine-need-one/|title=There are many reasons not to buy this laundry folding machine, but you only need one|first=Natt|last=Garun|publisher=The Next Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2016/06/03/this-600-laundry-robot-will-fold-your-clothes-in-seconds/|title=This £600 laundry robot will fold your clothes in seconds|first=James|last=Titcomb|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group|The Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The folded items are returned in a stack through a window at the bottom of the machine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://abc13.com/technology/sick-of-folding-clothes-this-machine-does-it-for-you/2934834/ Sick of folding clothes?

Previous versions included anti-wrinkling technology and fragrance features, but the product was redesigned and simplified with the aim of readying it for the market by the end of 2019.&lt;ref&gt;[https://abc13.com/technology/sick-of-folding-clothes-this-machine-does-it-for-you/2934834/ Sick of folding clothes?

[[File:FMtreew.gif|thumb|Function means tree]]

In [[engineering design]], a '''function–means tree''' (a.k.a. '''function/means tree''' or '''F/M tree''') is a method for [[functional decomposition]] and concept generation. At the top level, main functions are identified. Under each function, a [[instrumental value|means]] (or solution element) is attached. Alternative [[solution]] elements can also be attached. Each means is in turn decomposed into functions with means attached to each of them. A well-elaborated function means tree span, a design space where all [[concept]]s under consideration are represented. Requirements can be attached to functions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

In addition to product level requirements, there might be requirements on sub functions that may be a consequence of means at a higher level. The function means tree is a tool that can aid in the [[creativity|creative]] part of the design process. It can also be a tool for mapping requirements to parts in a design. This requires that there be also a mapping between means and parts in the product [[architecture]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

'''Hanwha Group''' ({{korean|hangul=한화그룹|rr=Hanhwa Geurup}})  is one of the largest business conglomerates (''[[chaebol]]'') in South Korea. Founded in 1952 as '''Korea Explosives Co.''' ({{korean|hangul='''한'''국'''화'''약주식회사|hanja='''韓'''國'''火'''藥株式會社 }}), the group has grown into a large multi-profile business conglomerate, with diversified holdings stretching from explosives, their original business, to retail to financial services. In 1992 the company adopted its abbreviation as the new name: "Hanwha".

The group owns [[Hanwha Eagles]], which is a professional baseball club in South Korea. The current Chairman of Hanwha is [[Kim Seung-yeon]].

Hanwha has 56 affiliates in South Korea alone and 226 networks (affiliates, branches and representative offices) around the world (as of June 2016).
However, on the other branches, other ceos have taken root. Some include Kim Ji-Dilleon and others.

== Branding and Localization ==

The Chinese branding for Hanwha is 韓華 (Simplified Chinese is 韩华). Chinese is the only foreign language in which Hanwha has a translated name. Officially, hanja(韓華) has not been used in South Korea.

[[File:Emblemata 1624.jpg|thumb|275px|Early depiction of a "Dutch telescope" from 1624.]]

The earliest known [[telescope]] appeared in 1608 in the [[Netherlands]] when an [[eyeglass]] maker named [[Hans Lippershey]] tried to obtain a patent on one. Although Lippershey did not receive his patent, news of the new invention soon spread across Europe. The design of these early [[refracting telescope]]s consisted of a convex [[Objective (optics)|objective]] lens and a concave [[eyepiece]]. [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] improved on this design the following year and applied it to astronomy. In 1611, [[Johannes Kepler]] described how a far more useful telescope could be made with a convex objective lens and a convex eyepiece lens and by 1655 astronomers such as [[Christiaan Huygens]] were building powerful but unwieldy Keplerian telescopes with compound eyepieces.&lt;ref&gt;''The history of the telescope'' Henry C. King, Harold Spencer Jones Publisher Courier Dover Publications {{ISBN|0-486-43265-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-486-43265-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isaac Newton]] is credited with building the first reflector in 1668 with a design that incorporated a small flat diagonal mirror to reflect the light to an eyepiece mounted on the side of the telescope. [[Laurent Cassegrain]] in 1672 described the design of a reflector with a small convex secondary mirror to reflect light through a central hole in the main mirror.

The [[achromatic lens]], which greatly reduced color aberrations in objective lenses and allowed for shorter and more functional telescopes, first appeared in a 1733 telescope made by [[Chester Moore Hall]], who did not publicize it. [[John Dollond]] learned of Hall's invention&lt;ref&gt;Lovell, D. J.; '[https://books.google.com/books?id=97m3IxXmT-oC&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;pg=PA40#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Optical anecdotes]', pp.40-41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Ray N.; '[https://books.google.com/books?id=PuN7l2A2uzQC&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Reflecting Telescope Optics: Basic design theory and its historical development]', p.14&lt;/ref&gt; and began producing telescopes using it in commercial quantities, starting in 1758.

Important developments in reflecting telescopes were [[John Hadley]]'s production of larger [[paraboloid]]al mirrors in 1721; the process of [[silvering]] glass mirrors introduced by [[Léon Foucault]] in 1857;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madehow.com/inventorbios/39/Jean-Bernard-L-on-Foucault.html |title=Inventor Biographies – Jean-Bernard-Léon Foucault Biography (1819–1868) |publisher=madehow.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the adoption of long-lasting aluminized coatings on reflector mirrors in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.org/uk/astronomy/features/amateur/files/p28-4.pdf |title=Bakich sample pages Chapter 2 |page=3 |quote=John Donavan Strong, a young physicist at the California Institute of Technology, was one of the first to coat a mirror with aluminum. He did it by thermal vacuum evaporation. The first mirror he aluminized, in 1932, is the earliest known example of a telescope mirror coated by this technique. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ritchey-Chretien]] variant of [[Cassegrain reflector]] was invented around 1910, but not widely adopted until after 1950; many modern telescopes including the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] use this design, which gives a wider field of view than a classic Cassegrain.

During the period 1850–1900, reflectors suffered from problems with speculum metal mirrors, and a considerable number of "Great Refractors" were built from 60&amp;nbsp;cm to 1 metre aperture, culminating in the [[Yerkes Observatory]] refractor in 1897; however, starting from the early 1900s a series of ever-larger reflectors with glass mirrors were built, including the Mount Wilson 60-inch (1.5 metre), the 100-inch (2.5 metre) [[Hooker Telescope]] (1917) and the 200-inch (5 metre) [[Hale telescope]] (1948); essentially all major research telescopes since 1900 have been reflectors. A number of 4-metre class (160 inch) telescopes were built on superior higher altitude sites including Hawaii and the Chilean desert in the 1975–1985 era. The development of the computer-controlled [[alt-azimuth mount]] in the 1970s and [[active optics]] in the 1980s enabled a new generation of even larger telescopes, starting with the 10-metre (400 inch) [[Keck telescopes]] in 1993/1996, and a number of 8-metre telescopes including the [[ESO]] [[Very Large Telescope]], [[Gemini Observatory]] and [[Subaru Telescope]].

The era of [[radio telescope]]s (along with [[radio astronomy]]) was born with [[Karl Guthe Jansky]]'s [[Serendipity|serendipitous]] discovery of an astronomical radio source in 1931. Many types of telescopes were developed in the 20th century for a wide range of wavelengths from radio to [[gamma-ray telescope|gamma-rays]].  The development of [[space observatories]] after 1960 allowed access
to several bands impossible to observe from the ground, including [[X-rays]] and longer wavelength [[infrared]] bands.

Objects resembling [[Lens (optics)|lenses]] date back 4000 years although it is unknown if they were used for their optical properties or just as decoration.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''The history of the telescope'' by Henry C.

Greek accounts of the optical properties of water filled spheres (5th century BC) followed by many centuries of writings on optics, including [[Ptolemy]] (2nd century) in his ''[[Optics (Ptolemy)|Optics]]'', who wrote about the properties of light including [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]], [[refraction]], and [[color]], followed by [[Ibn Sahl (mathematician)|Ibn Sahl]] (10th century) and [[Ibn Al-Haytham]] (11th century).&lt;ref name= PL&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001412/141236E.pdf |title=Perfecting the lens |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}{{unreliable source?|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actual use of lenses dates back to the widespread manufacture and use of [[eyeglasses]] in Northern Italy beginning in the late 13th century.&lt;ref name="Bardell2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bardell|first1=David|title=The Invention of the Microscope|journal=Bios|date=May 2004|volume=75|issue=2|pages=78–84|jstor=4608700}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Atti Della Fondazione Giorgio Ronchi E Contributi Dell'Istituto Nazionale Di Ottica, Volume 30, La Fondazione-1975, page 554&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/instruments/telescope.html galileo.rice.edu '''The Galileo Project &gt; Science &gt; The Telescope''' by Al Van Helden '']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=KAWwzHlDVksC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR1&amp;dq=alhazen+and+the+telescope&amp;ots=0GOT5dCTU8&amp;sig=U-uj1p9TvkAW12XFz8mkfI6TWMg#PPA27,M1 ''The History of the Telescope'' By Henry C.

===Invention===
[[File:Lipperhey.jpg|thumb|left|Notes on Hans Lipperhey's unsuccessfully requested a patent on the telescope in 1608]]

The first record of a telescope comes from the Netherlands in 1608. It is in a patent filed by [[Middelburg]] spectacle-maker [[Hans Lippershey]] with the [[States General of the Netherlands]] on 2 October 1608 for his instrument "''for seeing things far away as if they were nearby''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bo.astro.it/dip/Museum/english/can_int.html Osservatorio Astronomico di Bologna - TELESCOPES]&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks later another Dutch instrument-maker, [[Jacob Metius]] also applied for a patent. The States General did not award a patent since the knowledge of the device already seemed to be ubiquitous&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bo.astro.it/dip/Museum/english/can_int.html Osservatorio Astronomico di Bologna - TELESCOPES "''The request however was turned down, also because other spectacle-makers had made similar claims at the same time''."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''"The Hague discussed the patent applications first of Hans Lipperhey of Middelburg, and then of Jacob Metius of Alkmaar... another citizen of Middelburg'' [http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/instruments/telescope.html galileo.rice.edu '''The Galileo Project &gt; Science &gt; The Telescope''' by Al Van Helden]&lt;/ref&gt; but the Dutch [[government]] awarded Lippershey with a contract for copies of his [[design]].

The original Dutch telescopes were composed of a [[Biconcave|convex]] and a [[Biconcave lens|concave lens]]—telescopes that are constructed this way do not invert the image. Lippershey's original design had only 3x [[magnification]]. Telescopes seem to have been made in the Netherlands in considerable numbers soon after this date of "invention", and rapidly found their way all over Europe.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

==== Claims of prior invention ====
[[File:Jaansen Microscope.jpg|thumbnail|right|Reproduction of one of the four optical devices that Zacharias Snijder in 1841 claimed were early telescopes built by [[Zacharias Janssen]]. Its actual function and creator has been disputed over the years.&lt;ref&gt;Dutch biologist and naturalist [[Pieter Harting]] claimed in 1858 that this shorter tube was an early microscope which he also attributed to Janssen, perpetuating the ''Janssen'' claim to both devices.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Origins of the Telescope p.32-36"/&gt;]]

In 1655 Dutch diplomat [[Willem Boreel|William de Boreel]] tried to solve the mystery of who invented the telescope. He had a local magistrate in Middelburg follow up on Boreel's childhood and early adult recollections of a spectacle maker named "Hans" who he remembered as the inventor of the telescope. The magistrate was contacted by a then unknown claimant, Middelburg spectacle maker Johannes Zachariassen, who testified that his father, [[Zacharias Janssen]] invented the telescope and the microscope as early as 1590. This testimony seemed convincing to Boreel, who now recollected that Zacharias and his father, Hans Martens, must have been who he remembered.&lt;ref name="HeldenDupré2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Albert Van Helden|author2=Sven Dupré|author3=Rob van Gent|title=The Origins of the Telescope|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XguxYlYd-9EC&amp;pg=PA21|year=2010|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=978-90-6984-615-6|pages=21–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boreel's conclusion that Zacharias Janssen invented the telescope a little ahead of another spectacle maker, [[Hans Lippershey]], was adopted by [[Pierre Borel]] in his 1656 book ''De vero telescopii inventore''.&lt;ref&gt;King, Henry C.

In 1682,&lt;ref&gt;July 26, 1682&lt;/ref&gt; the minutes of the [[Royal Society]] in London [[Robert Hooke]] noted [[Thomas Digges]]' 1571 ''Pantometria'', (a book on measurement, partially based on his father [[Leonard Digges (scientist)|Leonard Digges]]' notes and observations) seemed to support an English claim to the invention of the telescope, describing Leonard as having a ''fare seeing glass'' in the mid 1500s based on an idea by [[Roger Bacon]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter D. Usher, Shakespeare and the Dawn of Modern Science, Cambria Press, 2010, page 28-29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Biographia Britannica: Or, The Lives of the Most Eminent Persons who Have Flourished in Great Britain and Ireland, from the Earliest Ages, Down to the Present Times, Volume 5, W. Innys - 1760, page 3130&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas described it as "''by proportional Glasses duly situate in convenient angles, not only discovered things far off, read letters, numbered pieces of money with the very coin and superscription thereof, cast by some of his friends of purpose upon downs in open fields, but also seven miles off declared what hath been done at that instant in private places''." Comments on the use of proportional or "perspective glass" are also made in the writings of [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] (1575) and  [[William Bourne (mathematician)|William Bourne]] (1585).&lt;ref&gt;Henry C. King, The History of the Telescope, Courier Corporation - 1955, page 28-29&lt;/ref&gt; Bourne was asked in 1580 to investigate the Diggs device by [[Queen Elizabeth I]]'s chief advisor [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Lord Burghley]]. Bourne's is the best description of it, and from his writing it seemed to consist of peering into a large curved mirror that reflected the image produced by a large lens.&lt;ref name="Patrick Moore 2012, page 9"&gt;Patrick Moore, Eyes on the Universe: The Story of the Telescope, Springer Science &amp; Business Media - 2012, page 9&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of an "Elizabethan Telescope" has been expanded over the years, including astronomer and historian [[Colin Ronan]] concluding in the 1990s that this reflecting/refracting [[telescope]] was built by Leonard Digges between 1540 and 1559.&lt;ref name="chocky.demon.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Satterthwaite |first=Gilbert |year=2002 |work=The Digges Telescope |url=http://www.chocky.demon.co.uk/oas/diggeshistory.html |title=Did the reflecting telescope have English origins? |accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ronan 1991"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ronan |first=Colin A. |year=1991 |title=Leonard and Thomas Digges |journal=[[Journal of the British Astronomical Association]] |volume=101 |issue=6 |url=http://www.chocky.demon.co.uk/oas/diggeshistory.html |accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=watson&gt;{{Cite book |last=Watson |first=Fred |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7dD2oE4pvukC&amp;pg=PA294&amp;dq=Leonard+Digges+stargazer&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=uuobTriVL6LZ0QGeud3KBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=digges&amp;f=false |title=Stargazer: The Life and Times of the Telescope |location=London |publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin |pages=38–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "backwards" [[reflecting telescope]] would have been unwieldy, it needed very large mirrors and lens to work, the observer had to stand backwards to look at an upside down view, and Bourne noted it had a very narrow field of view making it unsuitable for military purposes.&lt;ref name="Patrick Moore 2012, page 9"/&gt; The optical performance required to see the details of coins lying about in fields, or private activities seven miles away, seems to be far beyond the technology of the time&lt;ref name="watson40"&gt;Fred Watson, (2007), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=2LZZginzib4C&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=intitle:Stargazer+digges+coins&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=BIwrSc6pB4OClQT4zfyxBg Stargazer: The Life and Times of the Telescope]'', page 40. Allen &amp; Unwin&lt;/ref&gt; and it could be the "perspective glass" being described was a far simpler idea, originating with Bacon, of using a single lens held in front of the eye to magnify a distant view.&lt;ref&gt;Henry C. King, The History of the Telescope, Courier Corporation - 1955, page 28&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1959 research paper by Simon de Guilleuma claimed that evidence he had uncovered pointed to the French born spectacle maker [[Juan Roget]] (died before 1624) as another possible builder of an early telescope that predated Hans Lipperhey's patent application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7617426.stm|title=Controversy over telescope origin|publisher=BBC News|date=16 September 2008|accessdate=2009-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; inventing early telescope-like devices.

==== Spread through Europe ====
Lippershey's application for a patent was mentioned at the end of a diplomatic report on an embassy to Holland from the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Kingdom of Siam]] sent by the Siamese king [[Ekathotsarot]]: ''Ambassades du Roy de Siam envoyé à l'Excellence du Prince Maurice, arrivé à La Haye le 10 Septemb. 1608'' (''Embassy of the King of Siam sent to his Excellency Prince Maurice, arrived at The Hague on 10 September 1608''). This report was issued in October 1608 and distributed across Europe, leading to experiments by other scientists, such as the Italian [[Paolo Sarpi]], who received the report in November, and the English mathematician and astronomer [[Thomas Harriot]], who used a six-powered telescope by the summer of 1609 to observe features on the moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.aol.com/article/old-moon-map-corrects-history/307394 |title=Old Moon Map Corrects History |publisher=News.aol.com |date=2009-01-14 |accessdate=2013-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119004546/http://news.aol.com/article/old-moon-map-corrects-history/307394 |archivedate=January 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Galileo Donato.jpg|thumb|left|200px|19th-century painting depicting [[Galileo Galilei]] displaying his [[telescope]] to [[Leonardo Donato]] in 1609.]]

The Italian polymath [[Galileo Galilei]] was in [[Venice]] in June 1609&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OwOlRPbrZeQC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;lpg=PA137&amp;dq=Galileo++happened+to+be+in+Venice+Dutch+telescope |title=Galileo at Work |author=Stillman Drake |page=137 |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2003-02-20 |accessdate=2013-08-01|isbn=978-0-486-49542-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and there heard of the "Dutch perspective glass" by means of which distant objects appeared nearer and larger. Galileo states that he solved the problem of the construction of a telescope the first night after his return to [[Padua]] from Venice and made his first telescope the next day by fitting a convex lens in one extremity of a leaden tube and a concave lens in the other one. A few days afterwards, having succeeded in making a better telescope than the first, he took it to Venice where he communicated the details of his invention to the public and presented the instrument itself to the [[Doge of Venice|doge]] [[Leonardo Donato]], who was sitting in full council. The [[senate]] in return settled him for life in his lectureship at Padua and doubled his salary.

[[File:Galileo-picture.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Galileo Galilei]].]]

Galileo spent his time to improving the telescope, producing telescopes of increased power. His first telescope had a 3x magnification, but he soon made instruments which magnified 8x and finally, one nearly a meter long with a 37mm objective (which he would stop down to 16mm or 12mm) and a 23x magnification.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Quinn, Stargazing with Early Astronomer Galileo Galilei, Sky &amp; Telescope, July 31, 2008 [http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-resources/stargazing-with-galileo/]&lt;/ref&gt; With this last instrument he began a series of astronomical observations in October or November 1609, discovering the [[Galilean moon|satellites]] of [[Jupiter]], hills and valleys on the [[Moon]], the phases of [[Venus]]&lt;ref name=palmieri&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Palmieri |first1=Paolo |title=Galileo and the discovery of the phases of Venus |journal=[[Journal for the History of Astronomy]] |date=2001 |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=109–129 |bibcode=2001JHA....32..109P}}&lt;/ref&gt; and observed [[sunspot|spots on the sun]] (using the projection method rather than direct observation). Galileo noted that the revolution of the satellites of Jupiter, the phases of Venus, rotation of the [[Sun]] and the tilted path its spots followed for part of the year pointed to the validity of the sun-centered [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican system]] over other [[Geocentric model|Earth-centered systems]] such as the one proposed by [[Ptolemy]]. Galileo's instrument was the first to be given the name "telescope". The name was invented by the Greek poet/theologian [[Giovanni Demisiani]] at a banquet held on April 14, 1611 by Prince [[Federico Cesi]] to make [[Galileo Galilei]] a member of the [[Accademia dei Lincei]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Edward, ''The Naming of the Telescope'' (1947)&lt;/ref&gt; The word was created from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''tele'' = 'far' and ''skopein'' = 'to look or see'; ''teleskopos'' = 'far-seeing'.

These observations, together with Galileo's improvement of the instrument, led to the adoption of the name of the [[Galilean telescope]] for these early forms of telescope that employed a [[negative lens]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;This paragraph is adapted from the 1888 edition of the ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Further refinements ===
==== Refracting telescopes ====
[[Johannes Kepler]] first explained the theory and some of the practical advantages of a telescope constructed of two convex lenses in his ''Catoptrics'' (1611). The first person who actually constructed a telescope of this form was the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Christoph Scheiner]] who gives a description of it in his ''Rosa Ursina'' (1630).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

[[William Gascoigne (scientist)|William Gascoigne]] was the first who commanded a chief advantage of the form of telescope suggested by Kepler: that a small material object could be placed at the common [[focal plane]] of the objective and the eyepiece. This led to his invention of the [[micrometer]], and his application of telescopic sights to precision astronomical instruments. It was not till about the middle of the 17th century that Kepler's telescope came into general use: not so much because of the advantages pointed out by Gascoigne, but because its [[field of view]] was much larger than in the [[Galilean telescope]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

The first powerful telescopes of Keplerian construction were made by [[Christiaan Huygens]] after much labor—in which his brother assisted him. With one of these: an objective diameter of {{convert|2.24|in|mm}} and a {{convert|12|ft|m|abbr=on}} focal length,&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stjarnhimlen.se/bigtel/LargestTelescope.html |title=Largest optical telescopes of the world |author=Paul Schlyter |publisher=Stjarnhimlen.se |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; he discovered the brightest of Saturn's satellites ([[Titan (moon)|Titan]]) in 1655; in 1659, he published his "''Systema Saturnium''" which, for the first time, gave a true explanation of Saturn's [[planetary ring|ring]]—founded on observations made with the same instrument.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

===== Long focal length refractors =====
[[File:Houghton Typ 620.73.451 - Johannes Hevelius, Machinae coelestis, 1673.jpg|thumb|left|Woodcut illustration of a {{convert|45|m|ft|abbr=on}} focal length Keplerian astronomical refracting telescope built by [[Johannes Hevelius]]. From his book, "''Machina coelestis''" (first part), published in 1673.]]

The [[sharpness (visual)|sharpness]] of the image in Kepler's telescope was limited by the [[chromatic aberration]] introduced by the non-uniform refractive properties of the objective lens. The only way to overcome this limitation at high magnifying powers was to create objectives with very long focal lengths. [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini|Giovanni Cassini]] discovered [[Saturn's]] fifth satellite ([[Rhea (moon)|Rhea]]) in 1672 with a telescope {{convert|35|ft|m}} long. Astronomers such as [[Johannes Hevelius]] were constructing telescopes with focal lengths as long as {{convert|150|ft|m}}. Besides having really long tubes these telescopes needed scaffolding or long masts and cranes to hold them up. Their value as research tools was minimal since the telescope's frame "tube" flexed and vibrated in the slightest breeze and sometimes collapsed altogether.&lt;ref name="AIP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cartage"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/Sciences/Astronomy/Equipementdevices/Telescope/Historyoftelescope/howtelescopeimproved/howtelescopeimproved.htm |publisher=Cartage |work=History of Telescopes |title=How Telescopes Improved |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311032203/http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/Sciences/Astronomy/Equipementdevices/Telescope/Historyoftelescope/howtelescopeimproved/howtelescopeimproved.htm |archivedate=2009-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Aerial telescopes =====
{{Main|Aerial telescope}}
In some of the very long refracting telescopes constructed after 1675, no tube was employed at all. The objective was mounted on a swiveling ball-joint on top of a pole, tree, or any available tall structure and aimed by means of string or connecting rod. The eyepiece was handheld or mounted on a stand at the focus, and the image was found by trial and error. These were consequently termed [[aerial telescope]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/ga/astronomyclubaugusta/History/telescope.html |title=The Telescope |publisher=Angelfire.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have been attributed to [[Christiaan Huygens]] and his brother [[Constantijn Huygens, Jr.]]&lt;ref name="AIP"&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.aip.org/history/cosmology/tools/tools-first-telescopes.htm | work = Cosmic Journey: A History of Scientific Cosmology | title = The First Telescopes | publisher = Center for History of Physics, a Division of the American Institute of Physics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = https://books.google.com/?id=KAWwzHlDVksC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=Christiaan+Huygens+Aerial+telescope | title = The history of the telescope | first = Henry C. | last = King | year = 2003 | publisher = Courier Dover Publications | isbn = 978-0-486-43265-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is not clear that they invented it.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = https://archive.org/stream/christianhuygens029504mbp/christianhuygens029504mbp_djvu.txt | first = A.

==== Reflecting telescopes ====
{{See also|Reflecting telescope}}

The ability of a [[curved mirror]] to form an image may have been known since the time of [[Euclid]]&lt;ref&gt;''Reading Euclid'' by J. B. Calvert, 2000 [http://mysite.du.edu/~etuttle/classics/nugreek/contents.htm Duke U.] accessed 23 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and had been extensively studied by [[Alhazen]] in the 11th century. Galileo, [[Giovanni Francesco Sagredo]], and others, spurred on by their knowledge that curved mirrors had similar properties to lenses, discussed the idea of building a telescope using a mirror as the image forming objective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2LZZginzib4C&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=intitle:Stargazer+digges+coins#PPA108,M1 |title=Stargazer |author=Fred Watson |page=108 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01|isbn=978-1-74176-392-8 |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Niccolò Zucchi]], an Italian Jesuit astronomer and physicist, wrote in his book ''Optica philosophia'' of 1652 that he tried replacing the lens of a refracting telescope with a bronze concave mirror in 1616.

[[File:Lanature1873 telescope gregory.png|thumb|left|350px|Light path in a [[Gregorian telescope]].]]

In 1636 [[Marin Mersenne]] proposed a telescope consisting of a paraboloidal primary mirror and a paraboloidal secondary mirror bouncing the image through a hole in the primary, solving the problem of viewing the image.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=T4-GErgSbU0C&amp;pg=PA88&amp;lpg=PA88&amp;dq=Marin+Mersenne+reflecting+telescope&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GGocBEbf9P&amp;sig=Bmk8GLC46HdSoeYKq6wyz3jaoZc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result#PPA88,M1] ''[[Mirror Mirror: A History of the Human Love Affair With Reflection]]'' by [[Mark Pendergrast]] Page 88&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|James Gregory]] went into further detail in his book ''Optica Promota'' (1663), pointing out that a reflecting telescope with a mirror that was shaped like the part of a [[conic section]], would correct [[spherical aberration]] as well as the chromatic aberration seen in refractors. The design he came up with bears his name: the "[[Gregorian telescope]]"; but according to his own confession, Gregory had no practical skill and he could find no optician capable of realizing his ideas and after some fruitless attempts, was obliged to abandon all hope of bringing his telescope into practical use.

[[File:LaNature1873 coupe telescope foucault.png|thumb|right|350px|Light path in a [[Newtonian telescope]].]]

In 1666 [[Isaac Newton]], based on his theories of refraction and color, perceived that the faults of the refracting telescope were due more to a lens's varying refraction of light of different colors than to a lens's imperfect shape. He concluded that light could not be refracted through a lens without causing chromatic aberrations, although he incorrectly concluded from some rough experiments&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Newton, ''Optics'', bk. i. pt. ii. prop. 3&lt;/ref&gt; that ''all'' refracting substances would diverge the prismatic colors in a constant proportion to their mean refraction. From these experiments Newton concluded that no improvement could be made in the refracting telescope.&lt;ref&gt;''Treatise on Optics'', p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Newton's experiments with mirrors showed that they did not suffer from the chromatic errors of lenses, for all colors of light the [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]] reflected in a mirror was equal to the [[angle of reflection]], so as a proof to his theories Newton set out to build a reflecting telescope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=l2C3NV38tM0C&amp;pg=PA169&amp;lpg=PA169&amp;dq=Isaac+Newton+demonstration+reflecting+telescope+in#PPA168,M1 |title=Isaac Newton By Michael White |page=170 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01|isbn=978-0-7382-0143-6 |year=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton completed his [[Newton's Reflector|first telescope]] in 1668 and it is the earliest known functional reflecting telescope.&lt;ref name="mymathdone.com"&gt;[http://www.mymathdone.com/isaac-newton-adventurer-in-thought/ '''Isaac Newton: adventurer in thought''', by Alfred Rupert Hall, page 67]&lt;/ref&gt;  After much experiment, he chose an [[alloy]] ([[speculum metal]]) of [[tin]] and [[copper]] as the most suitable material for his [[Objective (optics)|objective]]  mirror. He later devised means for grinding and polishing them, but chose a spherical shape for his mirror instead of a parabola to simplify construction. He added to his reflector what is the hallmark of the design of a "''Newtonian telescope''", a secondary "diagonal" mirror near the primary mirror's focus to reflect the image at 90° angle to an [[eyepiece]] mounted on the side of the telescope. This unique addition allowed the image to be viewed with minimal obstruction of the objective mirror. He also made all the tube, [[Telescope mount|mount]], and fittings. Newton's first compact reflecting telescope had a mirror diameter of 1.3&amp;nbsp;inches and a [[F-number#Focal ratio in telescopes|focal ratio]] of f/5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telescope-optics.net/reflecting.htm |title=Reflecting telescopes: Newtonian, two- and three-mirror systems |publisher=Telescope-optics.net |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; With it he found that he could see the four [[Galilean moons]] of [[Jupiter]] and the [[Venus#Observation|crescent phase of the planet Venus]]. Encouraged by this success, he made a second telescope with a magnifying power of 38x which he presented to the [[Royal Society of London]] in December 1672. This type of telescope is still called a [[Newtonian telescope]].

[[File:Lanature1873 telescope cassegrain.png|thumb|left|350px|Light path in a [[Cassegrain telescope]].]]

A third form of reflecting telescope, the "[[Cassegrain reflector]]" was devised in 1672 by [[Laurent Cassegrain]]. The telescope had a small convex [[hyperboloid]]al secondary mirror placed near the prime focus to reflect light through a central hole in the main mirror.

No further practical advance appears to have been made in the design or construction of the reflecting telescopes for another 50 years until [[John Hadley]] (best known as the inventor of the [[octant (instrument)|octant]]) developed ways to make precision aspheric and [[Parabolic reflector|parabolic]] speculum metal mirrors. In 1721 he showed the first parabolic Newtonian reflector to the Royal Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amazing-space.stsci.edu/resources/explorations//groundup/lesson/scopes/hadley/index.php |title=Hadley’s Reflector |publisher=amazing-space.stsci.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had a {{convert|6|in|cm|adj=on}} diameter, {{convert|62+3/4|in|cm|adj=on}} focal length speculum metal objective mirror. The instrument was examined by [[James Pound]] and [[James Bradley]].&lt;ref&gt;Pound reported upon it in ''Phil. Trans.'', 1723, No. 378, p. 382.&lt;/ref&gt; After remarking that Newton's telescope had lain neglected for fifty years, they stated that Hadley had sufficiently shown that the invention did not consist in bare theory. They compared its performance with that of a {{convert|7.5|in|mm}} diameter aerial telescope originally presented to the Royal Society by Constantijn Huygens, Jr. and found that Hadley's reflector, "will bear such a charge as to make it magnify the object as many times as the latter with its due charge", and that it represents objects as distinct, though not altogether so clear and bright.

Bradley and [[Samuel Molyneux]], having been instructed by Hadley in his methods of polishing speculum metal, succeeded in producing large reflecting telescopes of their own, one of which had a focal length of {{convert|8|ft|m|abbr=on}}. These methods of fabricating mirrors were passed on by Molyneux to two London opticians —Scarlet and Hearn— who started a business manufacturing telescopes.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Robert, ''Compleat system of opticks in four books'', bk, iii. ch. I. (Cambridge, 1738)&lt;/ref&gt;

The British mathematician, optician [[James Short (mathematician)|James Short]] began experimenting with building telescopes based on Gregory's designs in the 1730s. He first tried making his mirrors out of glass as suggested by Gregory, but he later switched to speculum metal mirrors creating Gregorian telescopes with original designers [[Parabolic reflector|parabolic]] and [[elliptic]] figures. Short then adopted telescope-making as his profession which he practised first in Edinburgh, and afterward in London. All Short's telescopes were of the Gregorian form. Short died in London in 1768, having made a considerable fortune selling telescopes.

Since speculum metal mirror secondaries or diagonal mirrors greatly reduced the light that reached the eyepiece, several reflecting telescope designers tried to do away with them. In 1762 [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] presented a reflecting telescope before the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] forum. It had its primary mirror tilted at four degrees to telescope's axis so the image could be viewed via an eyepiece mounted at the front of the telescope tube without the observer's head blocking the incoming light. This innovation was not published until 1827, so this type came to be called the Herschelian telescope after a similar design by [[William Herschel]].&lt;ref&gt;"On an optic pipe improvement" — Lomonosov M.V.

About the year 1774 William Herschel (then a teacher of music in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[England]]) began to occupy his leisure hours with the construction of reflector telescope mirrors, finally devoted himself entirely to their construction and use in astronomical research. In 1778, he selected a {{convert|6+1/4|in|cm|adj=on}} reflector mirror (the best of some 400 telescope mirrors which he had made) and with it, built a {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=on}} focal length telescope. Using this telescope, he made his early brilliant astronomical discoveries. In 1783, Herschel completed a reflector of approximately {{convert|18|in|cm}} in diameter and {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} focal length. He observed the heavens with this telescope for some twenty years, replacing the mirror several times. In 1789 Herschel finished building his largest reflecting telescope with a mirror of {{convert|49|in|cm}} and a focal length of {{convert|40|ft|m|abbr=on}}, (commonly known as his [[40-foot telescope]]) at his new home, at [[Observatory House]] in [[Slough]], England. To cut down on the light loss from the poor reflectivity of the speculum mirrors of that day, Herschel eliminated the small diagonal mirror from his design and tilted his primary mirror so he could view the formed image directly. This design has come to be called the [[Reflecting telescope#Reflecting telescope designs|Herschelian telescope]]. He discovered Saturn's sixth known moon, [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]], the first night he used it (August 28, 1789), and on September 17, its seventh known moon, Mimas. This telescope was world's largest telescope for over 50 years. However, this large scope was difficult to handle and thus less used than his favorite 18.7-inch reflector.

In 1845 [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse]] built his {{convert|72|in|cm|adj=on}} Newtonian reflector called the "[[Leviathan of Parsonstown]]" with which he discovered the spiral form of [[galaxies]].

All of these larger reflectors suffered from the poor reflectivity and fast tarnishing nature of their speculum metal mirrors. This meant they need more than one mirror per telescope since mirrors had to be frequently removed and re-polished. This was time consuming since the polishing process could change the curve of the mirror so it usually had to be "[[Figuring|re-figured]]" to the correct shape.

==== Achromatic refracting telescopes ====
{{See also|Achromatic lens}}
[[File:Achromat doublet en.svg|thumb|Light path through an [[achromatic lens]].]]

From the time of the invention of the first refracting telescopes it was generally supposed that chromatic errors seen in lenses simply arose from errors in the spherical figure of their surfaces. Opticians tried to construct lenses of varying forms of curvature to correct these errors.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; Isaac Newton discovered in 1666 that chromatic colors actually arose from the un-even refraction of light as it passed through the glass medium. This led opticians to experiment with lenses constructed of more than one type of glass in an attempt to canceling the errors produced by each type of glass. It was hoped that this would create an "[[achromatic lens]]"; a lens that would focus all colors to a single point, and produce instruments of much shorter focal length.

The first person who succeeded in making a practical achromatic refracting telescope was [[Chester Moore Hall]] from [[Essex, England]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} He argued that the different humours of the human eye refract rays of light to produce an image on the [[retina]] which is free from color, and he reasonably argued that it might be possible to produce a like result by combining lenses composed of different refracting media. After devoting some time to the inquiry he found that by combining two lenses formed of different kinds of glass, he could make an achromatic lens where the effects of the unequal refractions of two colors of light (red and blue) was corrected. In 1733, he succeeded in constructing telescope lenses which exhibited much reduced [[chromatic aberration]]. One of his instruments had an objective measuring {{convert|2+1/2|in|cm}} with a relatively short focal length of {{convert|20|in|cm}}.

Hall was a man of independent means and seems to have been careless of fame; at least he took no trouble to communicate his invention to the world. At a trial in Westminster Hall about the patent rights granted to [[John Dollond]] (Watkin v. Dollond), Hall was admitted to be the first inventor of the achromatic telescope. However, it was ruled by [[Lord Mansfield]] that it was not the original inventor who ought to profit from such invention, but the one who brought it forth for the benefit of mankind.

In 1747, [[Leonhard Euler]] sent to the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] a paper in which he tried to prove the possibility of correcting both the chromatic and the spherical aberration of a lens. Like Gregory and Hall, he argued that since the various humours of the human eye were so combined as to produce a perfect image, it should be possible by suitable combinations of lenses of different refracting media to construct a perfect telescope [[Objective (optics)|objective]]. Adopting a hypothetical law of the dispersion of differently colored rays of light, he proved analytically the possibility of constructing an achromatic objective composed of lenses of glass and water.

All of Euler's efforts to produce an actual objective of this construction were fruitless—a failure which he attributed solely to the difficulty of procuring lenses that worked precisely to the requisite curves.&lt;ref&gt;''Mem. Acad. Berlin'', 1753.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Dollond]] agreed with the accuracy of Euler's analysis, but disputed his hypothesis on the grounds that it was purely a theoretical assumption: that the theory was opposed to the results of Newton's [[Scientific method|experiments]] on the refraction of light, and that it was impossible to determine a [[physical law]] from analytical reasoning alone.&lt;ref&gt;''Phil. Trans.'', 1753, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1754, Euler sent to the Berlin Academy a further paper in which starting from the hypothesis that light consists of vibrations excited in an elastic fluid by luminous bodies—and that the difference of color of light is due to the greater or lesser [[electromagnetic spectrum|frequency]] of these vibrations in a given time— he deduced his previous results. He did not doubt the accuracy of Newton's experiments quoted by Dollond.

Dollond did not reply to this, but soon afterwards he received an abstract of a paper by the [[Sweden|Swedish]] mathematician and astronomer, [[Samuel Klingenstierna]], which led him to doubt the accuracy of the results deduced by Newton on the dispersion of refracted light. Klingenstierna showed from purely geometrical considerations (fully appreciated by Dollond) that the results of Newton's experiments could not be brought into harmony with other universally accepted facts of refraction.

[[File:Göttingen-Dollond-Teleskop.JPG|thumb|right|Dollond telescope.]]

As a practical man, Dollond at once put his doubts to the test of experiment: he confirmed the conclusions of Klingenstierna, discovered a difference far beyond his hopes in the refractive qualities of different kinds of glass with respect to the [[refraction|divergence]] of colors, and was thus rapidly led to the construction of lenses in which first the chromatic aberration—and afterwards—the spherical aberration were corrected.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;''Phil. Trans.'', 1758, p. 733&lt;/ref&gt;

Dollond was aware of the conditions necessary for the attainment of achromatism in refracting telescopes, but relied on the accuracy of experiments made by Newton. His writings show that with the exception of his [[Courage|bravado]], he would have arrived sooner at a discovery for which his mind was fully prepared. Dollond's paper&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt; recounts the successive steps by which he arrived at his discovery independently of Hall's earlier invention—and the logical processes by which these steps were suggested to his mind.

In 1765 Peter Dollond (son of John Dollond) introduced the triple objective, which consisted of a combination of two convex lenses of crown glass with a concave [[Flint glass|flint]] lens between them. He made many telescopes of this kind.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

The difficulty of procuring disks of glass (especially of flint glass) of suitable purity and homogeneity limited the diameter and light gathering power of the lenses found in the achromatic telescope. It was in vain that the [[French Academy of Sciences]] offered prizes for large perfect disks of optical flint glass.

The difficulties with the impractical metal mirrors of reflecting telescopes led to the construction of large refracting telescopes. By 1866 refracting telescopes had reached {{convert|18|in|cm}} in aperture with many larger "''[[Great refractor]]s''" being built in the mid to late 19th century. In 1897, the refractor reached its maximum practical limit in a research telescope with the construction of the [[Yerkes Observatory]]s' {{convert|40|in|cm|adj=on}} refractor (although a larger refractor [[Great Paris Exhibition Telescope of 1900]] with an objective of {{convert|49.2|in|m}} diameter was temporarily exhibited at the [[Paris 1900 Exposition]]). No larger refractors could be built because of [[gravity]]'s effect on the lens. Since a lens can only be held in place by its edge, the center of a large lens will sag due to gravity, distorting the image it produces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OJclbOHqrD0C&amp;pg=PT532&amp;lpg=PT532&amp;dq=the+largest+telescope+lens+sag |title=Physics Demystified |author=Stan Gibilisco |isbn=0-07-138201-1 |page=515 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 2002-08-01|accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Large reflecting telescopes ===
{{See also|List of largest optical telescopes historically}}
[[File:Palomar arp 600pix.jpg|thumb|The {{convert|200|in|m|adj=on}} [[Hale telescope]] at [[Palomar Observatory|Mount Palomar]]]]

In 1856–57, [[Karl August von Steinheil]] and [[Léon Foucault]] introduced a process of depositing a layer of silver on glass telescope mirrors. The silver layer was not only much more reflective and longer lasting than the finish on speculum mirrors, it had the advantage of being able to be removed and re-deposited without changing the shape of the glass substrate. Towards the end of the 19th century very large silver on glass mirror reflecting telescopes were built.

The beginning of the 20th century saw construction of the first of the "modern" large research reflectors, designed for precision photographic imaging and located at remote high altitude clear sky locations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtwilson.edu/Simmons3.php |title=Building the 60-inch Telescope |author=Mike Simmons |origyear=Written in 1984 |date=2008&lt;!--Updated in--&gt; |publisher=Mtwilson.edu |accessdate=2013-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805001558/http://www.mtwilson.edu/Simmons3.php |archivedate=2013-08-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[60-inch Hale telescope]] of 1908, and the {{convert|100|in|m|adj=on}} [[Hooker telescope]] in 1917, both located at [[Mount Wilson Observatory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|bibcode=1956ASPL....7..249P |title=Pettit, E., Astronomical Society of the Pacific Leaflets, Vol. 7 |journal=Astronomical Society of the Pacific Leaflets |volume=7 |page=249 |publisher=Articles.adsabs.harvard.edu |date= |author1=Pettit |first1=Edison |year=1956 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These and other telescopes of this size had to have provisions to allow for the removal of their main mirrors for re-silvering every few months. John Donavan Strong, a young physicist at the [[California Institute of Technology]], developed a technique for coating a mirror with a much longer lasting aluminum coating using thermal [[vacuum evaporation]]. In 1932, he became the first person to "aluminize" a mirror; three years later the {{convert|60|in|mm|adj=on}} and {{convert|100|in|mm|adj=on}} telescopes became the first large astronomical telescopes to have their mirrors aluminized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmt.edu/mainpage/news/2001/10aug03.html |title=New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology - "Resurfacing the {{convert|100|in|mm|adj=on}} Telescope" by George Zamora |publisher=nmt.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013030537/http://www.nmt.edu/mainpage/news/2001/10aug03.html |archivedate=October 13, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 1948 saw the completion of the {{convert|200|in|cm|adj=on}} [[Hale telescope|Hale reflector]] at [[Palomar Observatory|Mount Palomar]] which was the largest telescope in the world up until the completion of the massive {{convert|605|cm|in|abbr=on}} [[BTA-6]] in Russia twenty-seven years later. The Hale reflector introduced several technical innovations used in future telescopes, including [[hydrostatic bearings]] for very low friction, the [[Serrurier truss]] for equal deflections of the two mirrors as the tube sags under gravity, and the use of [[Pyrex]] low-expansion glass for the mirrors. The arrival of substantially larger telescopes had to await the introduction of methods other than the rigidity of glass to maintain the proper shape of the mirror.

==== Active and adaptive optics ====
{{See also|Adaptive optics|List of largest optical reflecting telescopes}}

The 1980s saw the introduction of two new technologies for building larger telescopes and improving image quality,
known as [[active optics]] and [[adaptive optics]]. In active optics, an image analyser senses the aberrations of a star image
a few times per minute, and a computer adjusts many support forces on the primary mirror and the location of the secondary mirror
to maintain the optics in optimal shape and alignment. This is too slow to correct for atmospheric blurring effects, but enables the use of thin single mirrors up to 8&amp;nbsp;m diameter, or even larger segmented mirrors. This method was pioneered by the ESO [[New Technology Telescope]] in the late 1980s.

The 1990s saw a new generation of giant telescopes appear using active optics, beginning with the construction of the first of the two {{convert|10|m|in|abbr=on}} [[Keck telescope]]s in 1993. Other giant telescopes built since then include: the two [[Gemini telescope]]s, the four separate telescopes of the [[Very Large Telescope]], and the [[Large Binocular Telescope]].

[[File:ESO Very Large Telescope.jpg|thumb|[[ESO]]'s [[Very Large Telescope|VLT]] boasts advanced [[adaptive optics]] systems, which counteract the blurring effects of the Earth's atmosphere.]]

Adaptive optics uses a similar principle, but applying corrections several hundred times per second to
compensate the effects of rapidly changing optical distortion due to the motion of turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere. Adaptive optics works by measuring the distortions in a wavefront and then compensating for them by rapid changes of [[actuator]]s applied to a small deformable mirror or with a [[liquid crystal]] array filter. AO was first envisioned by [[Horace W. Babcock]] in 1953, but did not come into common usage in astronomical telescopes until advances in computer and detector technology during the 1990s made it possible to calculate the compensation needed in [[Real-time computing|real time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Telescopes Have Grown from Huge to Humongous [Slide Show]|url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/slideshow/telescopes-have-grown-from-huge-to-humongous-slide-show/|website = www.scientificamerican.com|accessdate = 2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In adaptive optics, the high-speed corrections needed mean that a fairly bright star is needed very close to the target of interest (or an artificial star is created by a laser). Also, with a single star or laser the corrections are only effective over a very narrow field (tens of arcsec), and current systems operating on several 8-10m telescopes work mainly in near-infrared wavelengths for single-object observations.

Developments of adaptive optics include systems with multiple lasers over a wider corrected field, and/or working above kiloHertz rates for good correction at visible wavelengths; these are currently in progress but not yet in routine operation as of 2015.

== Other wavelengths ==
The twentieth century saw the construction of telescopes which could produce images using wavelengths other than [[visible light]] starting in 1931 when [[Karl Jansky]] discovered astronomical objects gave off radio emissions; this prompted a new era of observational astronomy after World War II, with telescopes being developed for other parts of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] from radio to [[gamma-rays]].

=== Radio telescopes ===
{{See also|Radio telescope|Radio astronomy}}
[[File:Lovell Telescope 2.jpg|thumb|The {{convert|250|ft|m|adj=on}} Lovell radio telescope at [[Jodrell Bank]] Observatory.]]

Radio astronomy began in 1931 when [[Karl Jansky]] discovered that the [[Milky Way]] was a source of radio emission while doing research on terrestrial static with a direction antenna. Building on Jansky's work, [[Grote Reber]] built a more sophisticated purpose-built radio telescope in 1937, with a {{convert|31.4|ft|m|adj=on}} dish; using this, he discovered various unexplained radio sources in the sky. Interest in radio astronomy grew after the Second World War when much larger dishes were built including: the {{convert|250|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Jodrell bank]] telescope (1957), the {{convert|300|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Green Bank Telescope]] (1962), and the {{convert|100|m|ft|adj=on}} [[Effelsberg]] telescope (1971). The huge {{convert|1000|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Arecibo telescope]] (1963) is so large that it is fixed into a natural depression in the ground; the central antenna can be steered to allow the telescope to study objects up to twenty degrees from the [[zenith]]. However, not every radio telescope is of the dish type. For example, the [[Mills Cross Telescope]] (1954) was an early example of an array which used two perpendicular lines of antennae {{convert|1500|ft|m}} in length to survey the sky.

High-energy radio waves are known as [[microwaves]] and this has been an important area of astronomy ever since the discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] in 1964. Many ground-based [[radio telescopes]] can study microwaves. Short wavelength microwaves are best studied from space because water vapor (even at high altitudes) strongly weakens the signal. The [[Cosmic Background Explorer]] (1989) revolutionized the study of the microwave background radiation.

Because radio telescopes have low resolution, they were the first instruments to use [[interferometry]] allowing two or more widely separated instruments to simultaneously observe the same source. [[Very long baseline interferometry]] extended the technique over thousands of kilometers and allowed resolutions down to a few [[arcseconds|milli-arcseconds]].

A telescope like the [[Large Millimeter Telescope]] (active since 2006) observes from {{convert|0.85|to|4|mm|um|abbr=on}}, bridging between the far-infrared/[[submillimetre astronomy|submillimeter telescopes]] and longer wavelength radio telescopes including the microwave band from about {{convert|1|mm|um|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1000|mm|m|abbr=on}} in wavelength.

=== Infrared telescopes (700 nm/ 0.7 µm – 1000 µm/1 mm) ===
{{See also|Infrared telescope|Infrared astronomy|Far-infrared astronomy}}
Although most [[infrared]] radiation is absorbed by the atmosphere, infrared astronomy at certain wavelengths can be conducted on high mountains where there is little absorption by atmospheric [[water vapor]]. Ever since suitable detectors became available, most optical telescopes at high-altitudes have been able to image at infrared wavelengths. Some telescopes such as the {{convert|3.8|m|in|adj=on}} [[UKIRT]], and the {{convert|3|m|in|adj=on}} [[NASA Infrared Telescope Facility|IRTF]] — both on [[Mauna Kea]] — are dedicated infrared telescopes. The launch of the [[IRAS]] satellite in 1983 revolutionized infrared astronomy from space. This reflecting telescope which had a {{convert|60|cm|in|adj=on}} mirror, operated for nine months until its supply of coolant ([[liquid helium]]) ran out. It surveyed the entire sky detecting 245,000 infrared sources—more than 100 times the number previously known.

=== Ultra-violet telescopes (10 nm – 400 nm) ===
{{See also|Ultraviolet astronomy}}
Although optical telescopes can image the near ultraviolet, the [[ozone layer]] in the [[stratosphere]] absorbs [[ultraviolet]] radiation shorter than 300&amp;nbsp;nm so most ultra-violet astronomy is conducted with satellites. Ultraviolet telescopes resemble optical telescopes, but conventional [[aluminium]]-coated mirrors cannot be used and alternative coatings such as [[magnesium fluoride]] or [[lithium fluoride]] are used instead. The [[Orbiting Solar Observatory]] satellite carried out observations in the ultra-violet as early as 1962. The [[International Ultraviolet Explorer]] (1978) systematically surveyed the sky for eighteen years, using a {{convert|45|cm|in|adj=on}} aperture telescope with two [[spectroscope]]s. Extreme-ultraviolet astronomy (10–100&amp;nbsp;nm) is a discipline in its own right and involves many of the techniques of X-ray astronomy; the [[Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer]] (1992) was a satellite operating at these wavelengths.

=== X-ray telescopes (0.01 nm – 10 nm) ===
{{See also|X-ray telescope|X-ray astronomy}}
[[X-rays]] from space do not reach the Earth's surface so X-ray astronomy has to be conducted above the Earth's atmosphere. The first X-ray experiments were conducted on [[sub-orbital]] [[rocket]] flights which enabled the first detection of X-rays from the [[Sun]] (1948) and the first galactic X-ray sources: [[Scorpius X-1]] (June 1962) and the [[Crab Nebula]] (October 1962). Since then, X-ray telescopes ([[Wolter telescope]]s) have been built using nested grazing-incidence mirrors which deflect X-rays to a detector. Some of the [[Orbiting Astronomical Observatory|OAO satellites]] conducted X-ray astronomy in the late 1960s, but the first dedicated X-ray satellite was the [[Uhuru (satellite)|Uhuru]] (1970) which discovered 300 sources. More recent X-ray satellites include: the [[EXOSAT]] (1983), [[ROSAT]] (1990), [[Chandra X-ray Observatory|Chandra]] (1999), and [[XMM-Newton|Newton]] (1999).

=== Gamma-ray telescopes (less than 0.01 nm) ===
{{See also|Gamma-ray astronomy}}
[[Gamma rays]] are absorbed high in the [[Earth's atmosphere]] so most gamma-ray astronomy is conducted with [[satellites]]. Gamma-ray telescopes use [[scintillation counters]], [[spark chamber]]s and more recently, [[Solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] detectors. The angular resolution of these devices is typically very poor. There were [[balloon]]-borne experiments in the early 1960s, but gamma-ray astronomy really began with the launch of the [[OSO 3]] satellite in 1967; the first dedicated gamma-ray satellites were [[Second Small Astronomy Satellite|SAS B]] (1972) and [[Cos-B|Cos B]] (1975). The [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]] (1991) was a big improvement on previous surveys. Very high-energy gamma-rays (above 200&amp;nbsp;GeV) can be detected from the ground via the [[Cerenkov radiation]] produced by the passage of the gamma-rays in the Earth's atmosphere. Several Cerenkov imaging telescopes have been built around the world including: the [[HEGRA]] (1987), [[STACEE]] (2001), [[High Energy Stereoscopic System|HESS]] (2003), and [[MAGIC (telescope)|MAGIC]] (2004).

== Interferometric telescopes ==
{{See also|Astronomical interferometry}}

In 1868, [[Hippolyte Fizeau|Fizeau]] noted that the purpose of the arrangement of mirrors or glass lenses in a conventional telescope was simply to provide an approximation to a [[Fourier transform]] of the optical wave field entering the telescope. As this mathematical transformation was well understood and could be performed mathematically on paper, he noted that by using an array of small instruments it would be possible to measure the diameter of a star with the same precision as a single telescope which was as large as the whole array— a technique which later became known as [[astronomical interferometry]]. It was not until 1891 that [[Albert A. Michelson]] successfully used this technique for the measurement of astronomical angular diameters: the diameters of Jupiter's satellites (Michelson 1891). Thirty years later, a direct interferometric measurement of a stellar diameter was finally realized by Michelson &amp; [[Francis G. Pease]] (1921) which was applied by their 20&amp;nbsp;ft (6.1 m) interferometer mounted on the [[Hooker telescope|100 inch Hooker Telescope]] on Mount Wilson.

The next major development came in 1946 when [[Martin Ryle|Ryle]] and Vonberg (Ryle and Vonberg 1946) located a number of new cosmic radio sources by constructing a radio analogue of the [[Michelson interferometer]]. The signals from two radio antennas were added electronically to produce interference. Ryle and Vonberg's telescope used the rotation of the Earth to scan the sky in one dimension. With the development of larger arrays and of computers which could rapidly perform the necessary Fourier transforms, the first [[aperture synthesis]] imaging instruments were soon developed which could obtain high resolution images without the need of a giant parabolic reflector to perform the Fourier transform. This technique is now used in most radio astronomy observations. Radio astronomers soon developed the [[closure phase|mathematical methods]] to perform [[aperture synthesis]] Fourier imaging using much larger arrays of telescopes —often spread across more than one continent. In the 1980s, the [[aperture synthesis]] technique was extended to visible light as well as infrared astronomy, providing the first very high resolution optical and infrared images of nearby stars.

In 1995 this imaging technique was demonstrated on [[Cambridge Optical Aperture Synthesis Telescope (COAST)|an array of separate optical telescopes]] for the first time, allowing a further improvement in resolution, and also allowing even higher resolution [https://web.archive.org/web/19971021083400/http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/telescopes/coast/astronomy.html#supergiants02-04 imaging of stellar surfaces]. The same techniques have now been applied at a number of other astronomical telescope arrays including: the [[Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer]], the [[CHARA array]], and the [[Infrared Optical Telescope Array|IOTA]] array. A detailed description of the development of astronomical optical interferometry can be found here [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/2309/page1.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+06:32:14].

In 2008, [[Max Tegmark]] and [[Matias Zaldarriaga]] proposed a "[[Fast Fourier Transform Telescope]]" design in which the lenses and mirrors could be dispensed with altogether when computers become fast enough to perform all the necessary transforms.

'''husITa''' (Human Services Information Technology Applications) is an international virtual association{{spnd}}and a registered US non-profit organization{{spnd}}established with the mission of promoting the ethical and effective use of [[information technology]] in the [[human services]]. The main focus of husITa, and the claim to expertise of its associates, is situated at the intersection of three core domains: [[information technology]], [[human services]], and [[social development]]. husITa pursues its mission through international conferences, publications and research dissemination directed at technology applications and innovations that promote social well-being.

For much of its early history husITa operated as an informal international network of human service academics and practitioners. One of the outcomes of its first international conference{{spnd}}husITa1 held in 1987 in [[Birmingham]], England{{spnd}}was the establishment of a working group to determine the feasibility of an international body 'to highlight the importance of human service computing, to guide developments, and to foster international co-operation'.

The working group was composed of Hein de Graaf (Netherlands), Walter LaMendola (USA), Dick Schoech (USA), and Stuart Toole (UK). Initial projects identified by the working group included the development of research agendas, position papers, repositories of information, and promoting a second husITa conference in 1989.  Bryan Glastonbury was later added to the group as secretary. The working group met in Colorado, Denver for three days in May 1988 and published a report on the issues that a husITa international organization would need to address.&lt;ref&gt;See Report of the husITa working group, Computer Use in Social Services Network Newsletter, Fall, 1998, Vol 8/3, pp. 6-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the 1988 Denver meeting agreed its objectives, husITa wasn't formally established as an organization for another twelve years. The structure of the formal organization was later agreed to at Denver in 2000. The founding members at the Denver 2000 meeting were: Hein de Graaf, Walter LaMendola, Rob MacFadden, Jo Ann Regan, Jackie Rafferty, Jan Steyaert, Dick Schoech, Stuart Toole, and Victor Savtschenko.

== Objectives ==
husITa's objectives (agreed by the 1988 Denver working group) are to:
* Facilitate international cooperation in human service technology.
* Collect and disseminate information on human service technology, including tackling the problems of language translation.
* Provide technical assistance in human service technology and encourage the involvement of countries with a less developed human service IT infrastructure.
* Stimulate international discussion on key human service technology issues and encourage position papers in areas such as security/privacy/confidentiality, curriculum content and teaching methods, and ethical issues in systems/software development and use.
* Encourage publications about human service information technology.
* Encourage international research efforts.
* Encourage standards for making human service technology culturally independent.

== Journal of Technology in Human Services ==
The [http://www.tandfonline.com/action/aboutThisJournal?show=aimsScope&amp;journalCode=wths20 ''Journal of Technology in Human Services''] is the official journal of husITa. Formerly known as ''Computers in Human Services'' it was launched in 1985 as a [[Haworth Press]] publication.&lt;ref&gt;The journal [http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/wzch20/1/1 Computers in Human Services]&lt;/ref&gt; Dick Schoech, a professor of social work at the [[University of Texas at Arlington]], was its founding editor. The ''Journal of Technology in Human Services'' is a peer-reviewed, refereed journal now published by [[Taylor &amp; Francis]]. Its scope includes the potential of information and communication technologies in mental health, developmental disability, welfare, addictions, education, and other human services. The current Editor-in-Chief is [http://www.laurigoldkind.net/ Dr. Lauri Goldkind] (Associate Professor, Fordham University, USA), with [http://apss.polyu.edu.hk/staff/dr-chan-chitat-chen-zhi-da-bo-shi Dr. Chitat Chan] (Assistant Professor, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong) serves as the Associate Editor-in-Chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Journal of Technology in Human Services Turns a New Page|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15228835.2017.1356996|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related human service technology initiatives ==
husITa was built on the activity of an international  network of human service organizations, academics and practitioners in the USA, the UK and the Netherlands. The section below highlights some of the key organizations, people and events.

=== Early developments ===

In 1978, Gunther R. Geiss, aprofessor of social work at [[Adelphi University]], New York, conducted a survey of US schools of [[social work]]. The survey sought to identify faculty members who had used computers in their administrative, teaching or research activities, or who had consulted or participated in the design and development of computer-based information systems. There were over 80 positive responses indicating a wide range of activities and levels of involvement. The survey initiated the development of a system to track and communicate with individuals with expertise in computers and human services.

Walter LaMendola, professor of social work at the [[University of Denver]] in Colorado, described an incident during a social work conference in 1979 suggesting early indications of the resistance of some social work professionals to computer use in the human services.&lt;ref&gt;Walter LaMendola discusses '[http://wweb.uta.edu/faculty/schoech/cussn/stories.htm crowd resistance]' to a human services computer presentation in 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a theme which has continued throughout the history of technology use in the human services and continues to the present day. Some aspects of this resistance can be considered as a well-founded concern about the ethical issues surrounding human service technology applications. However, other aspects of technology resistance seem to be a less rational form of [[Neo-Luddism]].

=== Computer Use in Social Services Network (CUSSN) ===
Growing interest in the use of technology in the human services led a group of US human service technology specialists, meeting at a [http://www.cswe.org/ Council of Social Work Education] conference in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] Kentucky in 1981, to form the Computer Use In Social Services Network ([http://wweb.uta.edu/faculty/schoech/cussn/cussn/index.htm CUSSN]). By the end of 1981 the network had over 350 members. The CUSSN newsletter continued in print until 1992 when it was merged with the first academic journal on human service technology ''Computers in Human Services''.

In 1984 Gunther Geiss was sponsored by the [http://www.socialservicegrants.org/silbermanfund.html Silberman Fund] to organize the Wye Plantation Conference on Human Services Technology. Conference members developed pre-conference position papers via EYES: a centralized email system.&lt;ref&gt;Papers from the Wye Plantation Conference were published in [https://www.amazon.com/Human-Edge-Information-Technology-Helping/dp/0866564047/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1350877770&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=0866564047 Geiss &amp; Viswanathan (1995)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, CUSSN developed CUSSNet [http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1992-17472-001 CUSSNet], a PC and [[FidoNet]] based networking system that automatically exchanged emails between members each night during off-peak telephone hours. [[FidoNet]] was a PC distributed email, bulletin board, and file sharing system that preceded the Internet. CUSSNet quickly developed nodes in major cities in the US, the UK, and the Netherlands.

The name husITa (Human Service Information Technology Applications) was coined in 1983 by Walter LaMendola and Brian Klepinger at the [[University of Denver]].

The Human Service [[Microcomputer]] Conference was held in [[Seattle]].

=== Computer Applications in Social Work (CASW) ===
In 1984 Stuart Toole formed Computer Applications in Social Work (CASW) in the UK to set up and run national conferences and to publish the CASW journal.

Based on the success of the first UK technology conferences, Stuart Toole, Walter LaMendola, and Brian Klepinger agreed to pursue an international conference in 1987: this conference was to become HUSITA's first international conference HUSITA1.

The CASW  journal was later renamed [http://www.southampton.ac.uk/chst/projects/nths_archive/default.htm New Technology in the Human Services] in [when] and continued in publication under this title until it was closed in 2003.

In 1986 the second UK conference held on [[social welfare]] computing was held.

=== The Centre for Human Service Technology (CHST) ===
In 1985 Bryan Glastonbury, from the University of Southampton published ''Computers in Social Work'', the first major academic text on technology and human services.&lt;ref&gt;Glastonbury, B. (1985). Computers in Social Work. London, England: MacMillan.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year the [[University of Southampton]] began publishing the journal New Technology in the Human Services under the editorship of Bryan Glastonbury. In the same year the University of Southampton established the Centre for Human Service Technology (CHST) with Jackie Rafferty as Director. In 2007, Jan Steyaert joined as adjunct research professor and together they edited a special issue of the British Journal of Social Work on ''social work in the digital age''.
The [http://www.southampton.ac.uk/chst/ Centre for Human Service Technology] is based at the University of Southampton in England. CHST is an international, multi-disciplinary research center focused on influencing the appropriate use of technology in social work practice and education and researching its implementation and impact.

In July 1997 the CTI Centre for Human Services held a conference on ''Social Services and Learning Technology''  hosted by the Institute for Health and Community Services at the University of Bournemouth.

In 2003 the journal New Technology in Human Services ceased publication.

=== The European Network for Information Technology in Human Services (ENITH) ===
In 1986 Hein de Graaf, Director of the CREON foundation in the Netherlands, organised the first of a series of three-day gatherings. The CREON foundation was a Dutch foundation for computer research, expertise and support in field of the human services. The gatherings, called WELCOM, were designed to increase the knowledge and understanding of information technology in the Dutch human services. WELCOM1 was held in 1986 in [[Bussum]] with Walter LaMendola as the main international speaker. WELCOM2, a smaller Dutch-only conference, took place in 1987, again in [[Bussum]]. The next WELCOM event, WELCOM3: a combined conference and fair,  was held jointly with HUSITA3 in [[Maastricht]] in 1993.

Following the success of HUSITA's first international conference held in Birmingham in 1987 the Dutch Ministry of Social Welfare, Health and Cultural Affairs organized an informal meeting of European experts in the field of Information Technology and Human Services.  The meeting was one of the outcomes of a feasibility study carried out by the CREON foundation, concerning international cooperation in this field.  A main conclusion of this feasibility study was that an international (European) network should be established for the exchange of products, ideas, expertise, experiences and skills with respect to the introduction and use of IT in the human services.  As a first step in this approach the informal meeting of experts was organized.  The European network of organizations was called ENITH (European Network Information Technology and Human services).&lt;ref&gt;This [http://wweb.uta.edu/projects/sswtech/husita/history/ENITH_experts.htm report of an Expert Meeting] held by the Dutch Ministry of Social Welfare, Health and Cultural Affairs details the early work of ENITH.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 an ENITH3 Expert Meeting on “IT Applications and the Quality of Life and Services” was held in The Netherlands.

In 1994, from September 21 to September 23 an  ENITH4 conference was held in [[Berlin]], Germany. Bernd kolleck chaired this conference.

In September 1995 a CAUSA5/ENITH5 conference on “The Impact of Information Technology on Social Policy,” was held in Eindhoven, The Netherlands. Jan Steyaert chaired this conference.

ICB represents an ion-related counterpart of the better-known electronic '''[[Coulomb blockade]] (ECB)''' that is observed in [[Quantum dot|quantum dots]]'''.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Averin|first=D.

ICB provides some specific effects related to the existence of ions of different valence &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; (different in both sign and value), in contrast to the single-valence electrons of ECB (&lt;math&gt;z=-1&lt;/math&gt;). Coulomb blockade can also apear in superconductors; in such a case the free charge carriers are Cooper pairs (&lt;math&gt;z=-2&lt;/math&gt;) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amar|first=A.|last2=Song|first2=D.|last3=Lobb|first3=C.

ICB effects appear in tiny pores whose [[self-capacitance]] &lt;math&gt;C_{\rm s}&lt;/math&gt; is so small that the charging energy &lt;math&gt;\Delta E&lt;/math&gt; of a single ion becomes large compared to the [[thermal energy]] per particle &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm B}T&lt;/math&gt;. In such cases there is strong quantisation of the energy spectrum inside the pore, and the system may either be “blockaded” against the entry of any additional ions or, in the opposite extreme, it may show resonant barrier-less conduction,&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaufman:15" /&gt; depending on the free energy bias coming from '''&lt;math&gt;Q_{\rm f}&lt;/math&gt;''', &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\log{c_{\rm b}}&lt;/math&gt;.  

The ICB model claims that &lt;math&gt;Q_{\rm f}&lt;/math&gt; is a primary determinant of conduction and selectivity for particular ions, and the predicted oscillations in conductance and an associated Coulomb staircase of channel occupancy ''vs'' &lt;math&gt;Q_{\rm f}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaufman:15" /&gt; are expected to be strong effects in the cases of divalent ions or trivalent ions. 

Some effects, now recognised as belonging to ICB, were discovered and considered earlier in precursor papers on electrostatics-governed conduction mechanisms in channels and nanopores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=von Kitzing|first=Eberhard|date=1992|pages=297–314|publisher=Springer Netherlands|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-94-011-2718-9_25|isbn=9789401052054|chapter=A Novel Model for Saturation of Ion Conductivity in Transmembrane Channels|title=Membrane Proteins: Structures, Interactions and Models|volume=25|series=The Jerusalem Symposia on Quantum Chemistry and Biochemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=J.|last2=Kamenev|first2=A.|last3=Shklovskii|first3=B.

=== Generic electrostatic model of channel/nanopore ===
[[File:Jstat521809f01 hr.jpg|thumb|Fig. 1. Generic electrostatic and Brownian dynamics model of a channel or nanopore|330x330px|alt=]]ICB effects may be derived on the basis of a simplified electrostatics/Brownian dynamics model of a nanopore or of the selectivity filter of an ion channel.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The model represents the channel/pore as a charged hole through a water-filled protein hub embedded in the membrane. Its fixed charge &lt;math&gt;Q_{\rm f}&lt;/math&gt; is considered as a uniform, centrally placed, rigid ring (Fig.1). The channel is assumed to have geometrical parameters length &lt;math&gt;L\approx1&lt;/math&gt;nm and radius &lt;math&gt;R\approx 0.3-0.5&lt;/math&gt;nm, allowing for the single-file movement of partially hydrated ions.   

The model represents the water and protein as continuous media with dielectric constants &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{\rm w}=80&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{\rm p}=2-10&lt;/math&gt; respectively. The mobile ions are described as discrete entities with valence &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; and of radius &lt;math&gt;R_{\rm ion}&lt;/math&gt;, moving stochastically through the pore, governed by the self-consistently coupled [[Poisson's equation|Poisson's electrostatic equation]] and [[Langevin equation|Langevin stochastic equation.]]

The model is applicable to both cationic&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and anionic&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hartzell|first=Criss|last2=Putzier|first2=Ilva|last3=Arreola|first3=Jorge|date=2005-03-17|title=Calcium -activated chloride channels|journal=Annual Review of Physiology|language=en|volume=67|issue=1|pages=719–758|doi=10.1146/annurev.physiol.67.032003.154341|pmid=15709976|issn=0066-4278}}&lt;/ref&gt; biological ion channels and to artificial nanopores.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Feng:16" /&gt;

=== Basic electrostatics of ICB ===
The&amp;nbsp; mobile ion is assumed to be partially hydrated&amp;nbsp; (typically retaining its first [[hydration shell]] &lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;) and carrying charge &lt;math&gt;q=ze&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the elementary charge (e.g. the &lt;math&gt;\text{Ca}^{2+}&lt;/math&gt; ion with &lt;math&gt;z=2&lt;/math&gt;). The model allows one to derive the pore and ion parameters satisfying the barrier-less permeation conditions, and to do so from basic electrostatics taking account of [[Charge quantization|charge quantisation.]]

The potential energy &lt;math&gt;E_n&lt;/math&gt; of a channel/pore containing &lt;math&gt;n &lt;/math&gt; ions can be decomposed into electrostatic energy&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaufman:15" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;math&gt;E_{n}^{\rm ES}&lt;/math&gt; , dehydration energy,&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zwolak|first=Michael|last2=Wilson|first2=James|last3=Ventra|first3=Massimiliano Di|date=2010|title=Dehydration and ionic conductance quantization in nanopores|url=http://stacks.iop.org/0953-8984/22/i=45/a=454126|journal=Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter|language=en|volume=22|issue=45|pages=454126|doi=10.1088/0953-8984/22/45/454126|pmid=21152075|pmc=2997750|issn=0953-8984|bibcode=2010JPCM...22S4126Z|arxiv=1005.2550}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt;E_n^{\rm DH}&lt;/math&gt; and ion-ion local interaction energy &lt;math&gt;E_n^{\rm INT}&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;math display="block"&gt;E_n=E_n^{\rm ES}+E_n^{\rm DH}+E_n^{\rm INT}...(E_n \text{ Decomposition})&lt;/math&gt;
The basic ICB model makes the simplifying approximation that &lt;math&gt;E_n=E_n^{ES}&lt;/math&gt;, whence:&lt;math display="block"&gt;\begin{align} Q_n &amp; =  z n e+Q_{\rm f} &amp;\text{(Excess charge)}\\ E_n&amp;=\dfrac{Q_n^2}{2C_s} &amp;\text{(Electrostatic energy)} \\
C_s&amp; = 4\pi \epsilon_0 \epsilon_w \dfrac{R^2}{L} &amp;\text{(Self-capacitance)}
\end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;Q_{n}&lt;/math&gt; is the net charge of the pore when it contains &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; identical ions of valence &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, the sign of the moving ions being opposite to that of the &lt;math&gt;Q_{\rm f}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C_{\rm s}
 &lt;/math&gt; represents the electrostatic self-capacitance of the pore, and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_0&lt;/math&gt; is the electric permittivity of the vacuum.

=== Resonant barrier-less conduction ===
[[File:Resonant barrier-less conduction.svg|thumb|330x330px|Fig.2.

At the "resonant" value of &lt;math&gt;Q_{\rm f}/e=1&lt;/math&gt; the transition is almost barrier-less (red cross-section).

Thermodynamics and statistical mechanics describe systems that have variable numbers of particles via the [[chemical potential]] &lt;math&gt;\mu &lt;/math&gt;, defined as Gibbs free energy &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; per particle &lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; :&lt;math display="block"&gt;\begin{align}
G_n&amp;=E_n-TS_n &amp; \text{(Gibbs free energy)}\\
\mu_n&amp;=G_{n+1}-G_n &amp;\text{(Chemical potential)}
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;G_n &lt;/math&gt; is the Gibbs free energy for the system of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; particles. In thermal and particle equilibrium with bulk reservoirs, the entire system has a common value of chemical potential &lt;math&gt;\mu=\mu_F  &lt;/math&gt; (the [[Fermi level]] in other contexts).&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; The free energy needed for the entry of a new ion to the channel is defined by the [[excess chemical potential]] &lt;math&gt;\mu_{\rm ex}=\mu_n-\mu_F&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NaQ-AwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=landsberg%20statistical%20mechanics%202014&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=landsberg%20statistical%20mechanics%202014&amp;f=false|title=Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics|last=Landsberg|first=Peter T.|date=2014-03-05|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=9780486167589|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which (ignoring an entropy term ) can be written as &lt;math display="block"&gt;\begin{align}
\mu_{\rm ex}&amp;=E_{n+1}-E_n=\Delta E+E_{\rm AFF} &amp;\text{(Coulomb gap)}\\
\Delta E&amp;= \frac{ze}{2}\phi_{\rm s}; \quad \phi_s=\dfrac{ze}{C_{\rm s}} &amp;\text{(Charging energy)}\\
E_{\rm AFF}&amp;=\phi_s Q_n =\phi_{\rm s}(zen+Q_{\rm f}) &amp;\text{(Affinity energy)}
\end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\Delta E&lt;/math&gt; is the charging energy (self-energy barrier) of an incoming ion, &lt;math&gt;\phi_s
 &lt;/math&gt; is the self-potential of ion and &lt;math&gt; E_{\rm AFF} &lt;/math&gt;is its affinity (i.e. energy of attraction to the binding site &lt;math&gt;Q_{\rm f}&lt;/math&gt;). The difference in energy between &lt;math&gt;\Delta E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta E_{\rm AFF}&lt;/math&gt; (Fig.2.) defines the ionic energy level separation ([[Coulomb gap]]) and give rise to most of the observed ICB effects.  

In selective ion channels, the favoured ionic species passes through the channel almost at the rate of free [[diffusion]], despite the strong affinity to the binding site.

=== Oscillations of conductance ===
[[File:Ca Bands. v02.jpg|alt=|thumb|330x330px|Fig.3. Ionic Coulomb blockade illustrated by BD-simulations of Ca&lt;math&gt;^{2+}&lt;/math&gt; conduction, as the fixed charge &lt;math&gt;Q_{\rm f}&lt;/math&gt; is varied: (a) Ca&lt;math&gt;^{2+}&lt;/math&gt; conduction bands; (b) Ca&lt;math&gt;^{2+}&lt;/math&gt; occupancy, forming a Coulomb staircase; and (c) Ground state energy (red)]]The ICB model explicitly predicts an oscillatory dependence of conduction on &lt;math&gt;Q_{\rm f}&lt;/math&gt;, with two interlaced sets of singularities associated with a sequentially increasing number of ions &lt;math&gt;n=1,2,3,... &lt;/math&gt; in the channel (Fig.3A). '''Electrostatic blockade points &lt;math&gt;Q_{\rm f}=Z_n &lt;/math&gt;''' correspond to minima in the ground state energy of the pore (Fig.3C).&lt;math display="block"&gt;E_{\rm G}(Q_{\rm f}) =\min_n{E_n(Q_{\rm f})} \quad \quad \text{(Ground state})&lt;/math&gt; The &lt;math&gt;Z_n &lt;/math&gt; points (&lt;math&gt;\partial E_n/\partial Q_{\rm f}=0&lt;/math&gt;) are equivalent to neutralisation points&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; where &lt;math&gt;Q_{n}=0 &lt;/math&gt;.

'''Resonant conduction points &lt;math&gt;Q_{\rm f}=M_n &lt;/math&gt;''' correspond to the barrier-less condition: &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\mu_{\rm ex} =0 &lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\Delta E\approx-E_{\rm AFF}&lt;/math&gt;.

The values of &lt;math&gt;Z_n \text{ and } M_n&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaufman:15" /&gt; are given by the simple formulae&lt;math display="block"&gt;\begin{align}Z_n&amp;=-z e n &amp;\text{(Electrostatic blockade)} \\
M_n&amp;=-z e (n+1/2)  &amp;\text{(Resonant conduction)},
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;i.e. the period of conductance oscillations in &lt;math&gt;Q_{\rm f}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Delta=|M_{n+1}-M_n|=|Z_{n+1}-Z_n|=|ze| &lt;/math&gt;.

For &lt;math&gt;z=2&lt;/math&gt;, in a typical ion channel geometry, &lt;math&gt;\Delta E/(k_{\rm B}T) \approx 20 \gg 1&lt;/math&gt;, and ICB becomes strong. Consequently, plots of the BD-simulated &lt;chem&gt;Ca^2+&lt;/chem&gt;current &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; ''vs'' &lt;math&gt;Q_{\rm f}&lt;/math&gt; exhibit multi-ion conduction bands ''- strong Coulomb blockade oscillations'' between minima &lt;math&gt;Z_n&lt;/math&gt;and maxima &lt;math&gt;M_n&lt;/math&gt;(Fig.3A)) &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;. The point &lt;math&gt;Z_0 &lt;/math&gt; corresponds to an uncharged pore with &lt;math&gt;Q_{\rm f}=0 &lt;/math&gt;. Such pores are blockaded for ions of either sign.

=== Coulomb staircase  ===

The ICB oscillations in conductance correspond to a ''Coulomb staircase'' in the pore occupancy &lt;math&gt;P_{\rm c}&lt;/math&gt;, with transition regions corresponding to &lt;math&gt;M_n&lt;/math&gt; and saturation regions corresponding to &lt;math&gt;Z_n&lt;/math&gt; (Fig.3B) . The shape of the staircase is described by the [[Fermi–Dirac statistics|Fermi-Dirac]] (FD) distribution&lt;ref name="Kaufman:15" /&gt; , similarly to the Coulomb staircases of quantum dots &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. Thus, for the &lt;math&gt;0 \rightarrow 1&lt;/math&gt; transition, the FD function is: &lt;math display="block"&gt;\begin{align}
P_{\rm c}&amp;=\left[1+\dfrac{1}{P_{\rm b}}\exp\left(\dfrac{\mu_{\rm ex}}{k_{\rm B}T}\right)\right]^{-1};  &amp;\text{(Fermi-Dirac distribution)}\\
\mu_{\rm ex}&amp;=\phi_s\left( Q_{\rm f}-M_0\right).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;Here &lt;math&gt;\mu_{\rm ex}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[excess chemical potential]] for the particular ion and &lt;math&gt;P_{\rm b}&lt;/math&gt; is an equivalent bulk occupancy related to pore volume. The saturated FD statistics of occupancy is equivalent to the [[Langmuir isotherm]]&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fowler|first=R.

It is the factor &lt;math&gt;1/P_{\rm b} &lt;/math&gt; that gives rise to the concentration-related shift in the staircase seen in Fig.3B.

=== Shift of ICB singular points ===

Addition of the partial excess chemical potentials &lt;math&gt;\mu_{\rm ex}^Y&lt;/math&gt; coming from different sources &lt;math&gt;Y &lt;/math&gt;(including dehydration,&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; local binding,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; volume exclusion etc.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;) leads to the ICB barrier-less condition &lt;math&gt;\mu_{\rm ex}=0&lt;/math&gt; leads to a proper shift in the ICB resonant points &lt;math&gt;M_n&lt;/math&gt;, described by a "shift equation&lt;nowiki&gt;"&lt;/nowiki&gt; : &lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7985973/|title=Relation between selectivity and conductivity in narrow ion channels - IEEE Conference Publication|last=Luchinsky|first=D.G,|last2=Gibby W.A.T, Kaufman I.Kh., McClintock P.V.E., Timucin D.A.|date=2017|website=ieeexplore.ieee.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;math display="block"&gt;\Delta M_n= -\dfrac{1}{\phi_s} \sum_Y{\mu_{\rm ex}^{Y}} \quad \quad \text{(Shift equation)} &lt;/math&gt; i.e. the additional energy contributions &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\mu_{\rm ex}^Y&lt;/math&gt; lead to shifts in the resonant barrier-less point &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt;.

== ICB in artificial nanopores ==

=== Sub-nm &lt;chem&gt;MoS2&lt;/chem&gt;pores ===
Following its prediction based on analytic theory&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaufman:15" /&gt; and molecular dynamics simulations, experimental evidence for ICB emerged from experiments&lt;ref name="Feng:16" /&gt; on monolayer &lt;chem&gt;MoS2&lt;/chem&gt; pierced by a single &lt;math&gt;0.6&lt;/math&gt;nm nanopore. Highly non-Ohmic conduction was observed between aqueous ionic solutions on either side of the membrane. In particular, for low voltages across the membrane, the current remained close to zero, but it rose abruptly when a threshold of about &lt;math&gt;400&lt;/math&gt;mV was exceeded. This was interpreted as complete ionic Coulomb blockade of current in the (uncharged) nanopore due to the large potential barrier at low voltages. But the application of larger voltages pulled the barrier down, producing accessible states into which transitions could occur, thus leading to conduction.

== ICB in biological ion channels ==
The realisation that ICB could occur in biological ion channels&lt;ref name="Kaufman:15" /&gt; accounted for several experimentally observed features of selectivity, including:  

=== Valence selectivity ===
Valence selectivity is the channel's ability to discriminate between ions of different valence &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, wherein e.g. a [[calcium channel]] favours &lt;math&gt;\text{Ca}^{2+}&lt;/math&gt; ions over &lt;math&gt;\text{Na}^{+}&lt;/math&gt; ions by a factor of up to 1000×.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sather|first=William A.|last2=McCleskey|first2=Edwin W.|date=2003|title=Permeation and Selectivity in Calcium Channels|journal=Annual Review of Physiology|language=EN|volume=65|issue=1|pages=133–159|doi=10.1146/annurev.physiol.65.092101.142345|pmid=12471162|issn=0066-4278}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valence selectivity has been attributed variously to pure electrostatics,&lt;ref name="Corry:05" /&gt;
or to a charge space competition mechanism,&lt;ref name="Boda08"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boda |first1=Dezso |last2=Nonner |first2=Wolfgang |last3=Henderson |first3=Douglas |last4=Eisenberg |first4=Bob |last5=Gillespie |first5=Dirk |title=Volume exclusion in calcium selective channels |journal=Biophysical Journal |date=2008 |volume=94 |issue=9 |pages=3486–3496|bibcode=2008BpJ....94.3486B |doi=10.1529/biophysj.107.122796 |pmid=18199663 |pmc=2292364 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
or to a snug fit of the ion to ligands,&lt;ref name="dudev2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dudev |first1=Todor |last2=Lim |first2=Carmay |title=Evolution of eukaryotic ion Channels: principles underlying the conversion of Ca&lt;math&gt;^{2+}&lt;/math&gt;-selective to Na&lt;math&gt;^+&lt;/math&gt;‑selective channels |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |date=2014 |volume=136 |issue=9 |pages=3553–559 |doi=10.1021/ja4121132|pmid=24517213 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
or to quantised dehydration.&lt;ref name="Corry:13"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Corry |first1=Ben |title=Na&lt;math&gt;^+&lt;/math&gt;/Ca&lt;math&gt;^{2+}&lt;/math&gt; selectivity in the bacterial voltage-gated sodium channel NavAb |journal=Peer J |volume=1 |pages=e16 |date=2013 |doi=10.7717/peerj.16|pmid=23638350 |pmc=3629057 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the ICB model, valence selectivity arises from electrostatics, namely from &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-dependence of the value of &lt;math&gt;Q_{\rm f}=M_n=-ze(n+1/2)&lt;/math&gt; needed to provide for barrier-less conduction. 

Correspondingly, the ICB model provides explanations of why site-directed [[mutations]] that alter &lt;math&gt;Q_{\rm f}&lt;/math&gt; can destroy the channel by blockading it, or can alter its selectivity from favouring &lt;math&gt;\text{Ca}^{2+}&lt;/math&gt; ions to favouring &lt;math&gt;\text{Na}^{+}&lt;/math&gt; ions, or ''vice versa'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heinemann|first=Stefan H.|last2=Terlau|first2=Heinrich|last3=Stühmer|first3=Walter|last4=Imoto|first4=Keiji|last5=Numa|first5=Shosaku|date=1992|title=Calcium channel characteristics conferred on the sodium channel by single mutations|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/356441a0|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=356|issue=6368|pages=441–443|doi=10.1038/356441a0|pmid=1313551|issn=0028-0836|via=|bibcode=1992Natur.356..441H}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.''

=== Divalent blockade ===
Divalent (e.g. &lt;math&gt;\text{Ca}^{2+}&lt;/math&gt;) blockade of monovalent (e.g. &lt;math&gt;\text{Na}^{+}&lt;/math&gt;) currents is observed in some types of ion channel. Namely, &lt;math&gt;\text{Na}^{+}&lt;/math&gt; ions in a pure sodium solution pass unimpeded through a [[calcium channel]], but are blocked by tiny (nM) extracellular concentrations of &lt;math&gt;\text{Ca}^{2+}&lt;/math&gt; ions. ICB provides a transparent explanation of both the phenomenon itself and of the Langmuir-isotherm-shape of the current ''vs.'' &lt;math&gt;\log[\text{Ca}^{2+}]&lt;/math&gt; attenuation curve, deriving them from the strong affinity and an FD distribution of &lt;chem&gt;Ca^2+&lt;/chem&gt;ions.&lt;ref name="Kaufman:15" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaufman|first=Igor Kh.|last2=Fedorenko|first2=Olena A.|last3=Luchinsky|first3=Dmitri G.|last4=Gibby|first4=William A.T.|last5=Roberts|first5=Stephen K.|last6=McClintock|first6=Peter V.E.|last7=Eisenberg|first7=Robert S.|date=2017|title=Ionic Coulomb blockade and anomalous mole fraction effect in the NaChBac bacterial ion channel and its charge-varied mutants|journal=EPJ Nonlinear Biomedical Physics|language=en|volume=5|pages=4|doi=10.1051/epjnbp/2017003|issn=2195-0008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, ICB can account for the divalent (Iodide &lt;chem&gt;I^2-&lt;/chem&gt;) blockade that has been observed in biological chloride (&lt;chem&gt;Cl-&lt;/chem&gt;)-selective channels.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

== Special features ==

=== Comparisons between ICB and ECB ===
ICB and ECB should be considered as two versions of the same fundamental electrostatic phenomenon. Both ICB and ECB are based on charge quantisation and on the finite single-particle charging energy &lt;math&gt;\Delta E &lt;/math&gt;, resulting in close similarity of the governing equations and manifestations of these closely related phenomena. Nonetheless, there are important distinctions between ICB and ECB: their similarities and differences are summarised in Table 1.

=== Quantum analogies in ICB ===
Despite appearing in completely [[Classical mechanics|classical systems]], ICB exhibits some phenomena reminiscent of [[Quantum mechanics|quantum-mechanics]] (QM). They arise because the charge/entity discreteness of the ions leads to quantisation of the energy &lt;math&gt;\Delta E&lt;/math&gt; spectrum and hence to the QM-analogies:&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite arxiv|last=Meyertholen|first=Andrew|last2=Di Ventra|first2=Massimiliano|date=2013-05-31|title=Quantum Analogies in Ionic Transport Through Nanopores|eprint=1305.7450|class=cond-mat.mes-hall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Noise-driven diffusive motion provides for escape over barriers, comparable to QM-tunnelling in ECB.
* The particular FD shape&lt;ref name="Kaufman:15" /&gt; of the &lt;math&gt;\text {Ca}^{2+}&lt;/math&gt; occupancy ''vs'' &lt;math&gt;\log{[\text{Ca}^{2+}]}&lt;/math&gt; plays a significant role in the ICB explanation of the divalent blockade phenomenon. &lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The appearance of an FD distribution in the diffusion of classical particles obeying an [[Exclusion principle (philosophy)|exclusion principle]], has been demonstrated rigorously.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaniadakis|first=G.|last2=Quarati|first2=P.|date=1993-12-01|title=Kinetic equation for classical particles obeying an exclusion principle|journal=Physical Review E|volume=48|issue=6|pages=4263–4270|doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.48.4263|bibcode=1993PhRvE..48.4263K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also has a number of subsidiaries, included [[Isuzu (Anadolu)|Anadolu Isuzu]] (a Turkish joint venture with Anadolu Group), [[Sollers-Isuzu]] (a Russian joint venture with [[Sollers JSC]]), [[SML Isuzu]] (formerly [[Swaraj Mazda]]), [[Jianxi Isuzu Motors]] (a Chinese joint venture with [[Jiangling Motors|Jiangling Motors Company Group]]), [[Isuzu Astra Motor Indonesia]], [[Isuzu Malaysia]] ([[Isuzu HICOM Malaysia|Isuzu HICOM]]), [[Isuzu Truck (UK)|Isuzu UK]], [[Isuzu Truck South Africa|Isuzu South Africa]], [[Isuzu Philippines]], [[Taiwan Isuzu Motors]], [[Isuzu Vietnam]], and [[Isuzu Motors India]].

Isuzu has assembly and manufacturing plants in [[Fujisawa, Kanagawa|Fujisawa]], as well as in the [[Tochigi Prefecture|Tochigi]] and [[Hokkaidō]] prefectures&lt;!--according to corp website in Oct'05, "as of June 2005"--&gt;. Isuzu-branded vehicles are sold in most commercial markets worldwide. Isuzu's primary market focus is on commercial diesel-powered truck, buses and construction, while their Japanese competitor [[Yanmar]] focuses on commercial-level powerplants and generators.

By 2009, Isuzu had produced over 21 million diesel engines, which can be found in vehicles all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isuzu.co.jp/world/corporate/engine/worldclass.html |title=Isuzu.co.jp |publisher=Isuzu.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2010-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Isuzu diesel engines are used by dozens of vehicle manufacturers, including [[Ford Motor Company]]{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} and the [[Renault–Nissan–Mitsubishi Alliance]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==History==
Isuzu Motors' history began in 1916, when Tokyo [[IHI Corporation|Ishikawajima]] Shipbuilding and Engineering Co., Ltd. planned a cooperation with the Tokyo Gas and Electric Industrial Co. to build automobiles. The next step was taken in 1918, when a technical cooperation with [[Wolseley Motors|Wolseley Motors Limited]] was initiated, yielding exclusive rights to the production and sales of Wolseley vehicles in East Asia.&lt;ref name=Ruiz&gt;{{cite book | ref = Ruiz | last = Ruiz | first = Marco | title = 'The Complete History of the Japanese Car: 1907 to the Present | publisher = ERVIN srl | location = Rome | year = 1986 | page = 130 | isbn = 0-517-61777-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922 came the first ever Japan-produced passenger car, a Wolseley model, the A9.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isuzu.co.jp/world/corporate/truck/builders01.html Isuzu Website]&lt;/ref&gt; The CP [[truck]] followed two years later; 550 of these were built by 1927.&lt;ref name="Camion1"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = トラックメーカーアーカイブ: いすゞ自動車のすべて [Truck Manufacturer Archive: Everything Isuzu] | ref = Ishikawa | last = Ishikawa | first = Kenji | language = Japanese | work = Camion | publisher = Geibun Mooks | location = Tokyo, Japan | page = 98 | date = 2012-05-01 | isbn = 978-4-86396-183-8 | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

(a predecessor of [[Nissan]]) and changed its name to Automobile Industries Co., Ltd. The products of this company, marketed as "Sumiya" and "Chiyoda",&lt;ref name=Ruiz/&gt; were renamed '''Isuzu''' (after the [[Isuzu River]]) in 1934, following a meeting with the Japanese Government's [[Ministry of International Trade and Industry|Ministry of Trade and Industry (MITI)]]. The word Isuzu translated into English means "fifty bells"—hence the focus on "bell" in both the later [[Isuzu Bellel|Bellel]] and the [[Isuzu Bellett|Bellett]].
{{triple image|left|1st_ISUZU_LOGO,_1949-1974.jpg|110|OLD_ISUZU_LOGO,_1974-1991_(YABANE-MARK).jpg|121|ISUZU,_Existing_logo_from_1991.jpg|110|The first Isuzu emblem, 1949–1974|Second generation Isuzu emblem, 1974–1991|Current Isuzu emblem, 1991–}}
In 1937 Automobile Industries was reorganized and formed into a new company, Tokyo Automobile Industries Co., Ltd. It was founded with a capital of ¥1,000,000. Only in 1949 was Isuzu finally adopted as the company name. Meanwhile, in 1942, [[Hino Motors|Hino Heavy Industries]] was split off from Isuzu, becoming a separate corporation.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isuzu.co.jp/world/investor/fact/history.html | title = Investor Relations: Company History | publisher = Isuzu Motors | accessdate = 2012-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Truck production ([[:ja:いすゞ・TX|TX40 and TU60]]) began anew in 1945, with the permission of the [[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers|occupation authorities]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ishikawa|Ishikawa]], p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1953 the [[Hillman Minx]] passenger car is produced under license of [[Rootes Group]]. The Minx remained in production until 1962, after the 1961 introduction of Isuzu's first own car, the [[Isuzu Bellel|Bellel]].&lt;ref name=Ruiz/&gt; Being a small producer making cars which were somewhat too large and pricey for the Japanese market at the time, Isuzu spent some time looking for a commercial partner. Under pressure from MITI, who were attempting to limit the number of automobile manufacturers in Japan, a cooperation with [[Fuji Heavy Industries]] ([[Subaru]]) began in 1966. This joint sales-service collaboration was seen as the first step towards an eventual merger.&lt;ref name=RT268&gt;{{cite magazine | magazine = [[Road &amp; Track]] | first = Jack | last = Yamaguchi | page = 113 | date = February 1968 | title = 14th Tokyo Motor Show: &amp; Still Trying Harder }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Subaru 1000]] was even shown in Isuzu's 1967 annual vehicle brochure, as a suitable complement to the larger Isuzu lineup.&lt;ref name="42.10"&gt;{{Cite journal | title =Isuzu | publisher = Isuzu Motors | language = Japanese |date=October 1967 | pages = 8–9 | type = brochure | id = 42.10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This tie-up was over by 1968, when an agreement with [[Mitsubishi]] was formed. This ended even quicker, by 1969, and the next year an equally short-lived collaboration was entered with [[Nissan]].&lt;ref name="Ruiz2"&gt;[[#Ruiz|Ruiz]], p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later, in September 1971, what was to prove a more durable capital agreement was signed with [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]].

===Linking with General Motors===
The first result of GM taking a 34% stake in Isuzu is seen in 1972, only months later, when the [[Chevrolet LUV]] becomes the first Isuzu-built vehicle to be sold in the United States. To symbolize the new beginning, Isuzu also developed a new logo for 1974, with two vertical pillars which are stylized representations of the first syllable in いすゞ ("Isuzu").&lt;ref name="Camion1"/&gt; In 1974 Isuzu introduced the [[Isuzu Gemini|Gemini]], which was co-produced with General Motors as the [[GM T platform (1973)|T-car]]. It was sold in the United States as [[Buick]]'s Opel by Isuzu, and in Australia as the Holden Gemini. As a result of the collaboration, certain American GM products are sold to Japanese customers through Isuzu dealerships. Holden's [[Statesman (automobile)|Statesman]] was also briefly sold (246 examples) with Isuzu badging in Japan during the seventies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bedwell | first = Steve | year = 2009 | title = Holden vs Ford: the cars, the culture, the competition | location = [[Dulwich Hill, New South Wales]] | publisher = Rockpool | isbn = 978-1-921295-17-1 | page = 199 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Isuzu exports also increased considerably as a result of being able to use GM networks, from 0.7% of production in 1973 to 35.2% by 1976; this while overall production increased more than fourfold in the same period.&lt;ref name="Ruiz2"/&gt; As a result of the GM joint venture, Isuzu engines were also used by existing GM divisions (some USA-market Chevrolet automobiles had Isuzu powertrains e.g. the Chevette and early S10/S15 trucks manufactured prior to 1985).

[[File:1966 Isuzu Bellett 01.jpg|thumb|1966 Isuzu Bellett 1600 GT (PR90)]]
In 1981 Isuzu began selling consumer and commercial vehicles under their own brand in the United States. The [[Isuzu P'Up]] was the first model sold to consumers as an Isuzu, rather than as a [[Chevrolet]] or Buick. Isuzu's then president Toshio Okamoto then initiated a collaboration with small-car expert [[Suzuki]] to develop a global small car for GM, the [[GM S platform|S-car]].&lt;ref name=JEJ&gt;{{cite journal | title = GM ties with two Japanese car makers | location = Tokyo | date = 1981-08-18 | page = 1 | journal = [[Nihon Keizai Shimbun]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; A three-way agreement of co-ownership was signed in August 1981, with Isuzu and Suzuki exchanging shares and General Motors taking a 5% share of Suzuki.&lt;ref name=JEJ/&gt;  Following on from this, in 1985 Isuzu and GM established the [[IBC Vehicles]] venture in the United Kingdom, producing locally built versions of Isuzu and Suzuki light vans (the [[Isuzu Fargo]] and [[Suzuki Carry]]); to be sold in the European market under [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]]'s [[Bedford Vehicles|Bedford]] brand.  During this period Isuzu also developed a worldwide presence as an exporter of diesel engines, with their powerplants in use by [[Opel]]/Vauxhall, [[Land Rover]], [[Hindustan Motors|Hindustan]], and many others. Two Isuzu model lines (Gemini, Impulse) were marketed as part of the [[Geo (automobile)|Geo]] division (Spectrum, Storm) when it was initially launched as a Chevrolet subsidiary. In the domestic Japanese market, OEM deals with other manufacturers were entered to aid the poorly performing passenger car arm. It led to the badging of Suzukis, beginning in 1986,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Isuzu, Suzuki tie up in sales and production | location = Tokyo | date = 1986-01-18 | section = Machinery | page = 10 | journal = [[Nihon Keizai Shimbun]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Subaru small commercial vehicles as Isuzus ([[Suzuki Cultus|Geminett]], [[Subaru Leone#third|Geminett II]]). This OEM tie-up occurred alongside the establishment of SIA (Subaru-Isuzu Automotive), an American joint venture with Fuji Heavy Industries (the parent company of [[Subaru]]). Shortly afterwards, the [[Lafayette, Indiana]] plant became operational.

===Contraction begins===
[[File:Isuzu Unicab 2.jpg|thumb|1967 [[:ja:いすゞ・ユニキャブ|Isuzu Unicab]], a two-wheel-drive utility vehicle]]

Isuzu ended US sales of the [[Isuzu Impulse|Impulse]] ([[Geo Storm]]) in 1992, and the following year it stopped exporting the [[Isuzu Stylus|Stylus]] (the basis for the [[Geo Spectrum]]), the last Isuzu-built car sold in the US.

In 1993 Isuzu began a new vehicle exchange program with [[Honda]], whereby Honda sold the [[Isuzu Rodeo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cars.com/isuzu/rodeo/1993/expert-reviews|title=Expert Reviews: 1993 Isuzu Rodeo|author=Truett, Richard Truett|work=Orlando Sentinel|date=October 21, 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Isuzu Trooper]] as the [[Honda Passport]] and [[Acura SLX]], respectively. In return Isuzu began selling the [[Honda Odyssey (North America)|Honda Odyssey]] as the Isuzu Oasis. Thus, Honda's lineup gained two SUVs, and Isuzu's lineup gained a minivan. In the Japanese market, the Gemini (Stylus) was now a rebadged [[Honda Domani]] and the Aska (originally based on the GM [[GM J platform|J-car]]) was a [[Honda Accord]].

Isuzu's United States sales reached a peak in 1996 after the introduction of the [[Isuzu Hombre]] pickup, a badge-engineered GM truck (using the sheetmetal of the Brazil-market Chevrolet S10). Isuzu resurrected the beloved Amigo in 1998, before changing the name of the 2-door convertible to Rodeo Sport in 2001 in an attempt to associate it with the better selling 4-door Rodeo. The Rodeo Sport was discontinued in 2003, while production of the Rodeo and Axiom ceased a year later. By this point sales in North America had slowed to just 27,188, with the discontinued Rodeo and Axiom making up 71% of that total.  

In 1998 [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] and Isuzu formed [[DMAX (engines)|DMAX]], a joint venture to produce [[diesel engine]]s. GM raised its stake in Isuzu to 49% the following year, effectively gaining control of the company and quickly followed this up by appointing an American GM executive to head Isuzu's North American Operations. This marked the first time a non-Japanese executive had ever held such a high position at Isuzu. In 2001 G.M. and Isuzu announced plans to share distribution networks and for Chevrolet to market an Isuzu product.&lt;ref name=NYT2001/&gt;

The production version of the heralded [[Isuzu VehiCROSS|VehiCROSS]] was introduced to the US in 1999, but met with mixed reviews, as its high pricetag, unique styling and two-door configuration did not seem to meet with market demands. Production of the VehiCROSS and other sport utility vehicles, including the [[Isuzu Trooper|Trooper]], ended in 2001 as part of a major financial reorganization which eliminated almost 10,000 jobs.&lt;ref name=NYT2001&gt;{{cite news|last1=Krebs|first1=Michelle|title=Isuzu's U.S. Presence Leans on G.M.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/01/automobiles/isuzu-s-us-presence-leans-on-gm.html|accessdate=23 September 2017|work=The New York Times|date=1 Jul 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; GM had been pushing the company to focus exclusively on producing commercial vehicles and engines.&lt;ref name=NYT2001/&gt; 

{{prose|section|date=November 2010}}

* 2001 – [[Joe Isuzu]], the immensely popular pitchman with implausible claims, is hired once again to promote the new [[Isuzu Axiom|Axiom]]. Isuzu sales begin to slide due to the aging of the [[Isuzu Rodeo|Rodeo]] and [[Isuzu Trooper|Trooper]], and poor management &amp; lack of assistance from GM. Its Duramax engines in full-size pickup trucks have won rave reviews.&lt;ref name=NYT2001/&gt; 
* Early 2002 – Fuji Heavy Industries (Subaru's parent company) buys Isuzu's share of Lafayette, Indiana plant. Subaru Isuzu Automotive (SIA) becomes [[Subaru of Indiana Automotive]].  After 8 years of heavy Honda Passport sales and light Isuzu Oasis sales, Honda and Isuzu cooperatively end their vehicle exchange agreement.  The Oasis is dropped, and Honda replaces the Passport with the Pilot. Also, it was Isuzu's last year for passenger vehicles in Canada, as Isuzus in Canada were mostly sold at [[Saturn Corporation|Saturn]]-[[Saab Automobile|Saab]] dealerships.
* Late 2002 – Isuzu initiates a recapitalization and [[Debt restructuring#Debt-for-equity swap|debt-for-equity conversion]] plan to stave off a bankruptcy.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt; GM acquires 20% of [[DMAX (engines)|DMAX]], 60% of [[Isuzu Motors Polska]] and Isuzu Motors Germany, and the rights to three types of diesel engine technology from Isuzu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release: Isuzu Motors Limited Unveils the New Three-year Business Plan and Re-capitalization Plan,  involving Decrease of Capital and Debt-for-equity Conversion.|url=http://www.isuzu.co.jp/world/press/2002/p_1025.html|website=www.Isuzu.co.jp|publisher=Isuzu Motors|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; by paying 50 billion yen (about US$425 million).&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news|title=Isuzu falls back after GM rescue plan|url=http://www.cnn.com/2002/BUSINESS/asia/08/15/japan.isuzu.biz/index.html|accessdate=23 September 2017|publisher=CNN.com|date=15 Aug 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; GM also pays 10 billion yen (about US$85 million) for a 12% stake in the recapitalized company.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt; G.M. wrote off its investment in Isuzu in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Belson|first1=Ken|title=G.M.

* 2004 – The number of Isuzu dealerships in the U.S. begins a rapid decline.
* 2005 – Isuzu dealers in the United States have only 2 models: the Ascender and the i-series pickup truck.  The i-series is a rebadged Chevrolet Colorado, the Ascender is a re-badged GMC Envoy.  At this point, Isuzu in the United States is primarily a distributor of medium duty trucks such as the [[Isuzu Elf|N-series]]. These vehicles are sourced both from Japan and U.S. plants in Janesville, Wisconsin and Flint, Michigan. Isuzu has 290 light-vehicle dealers in the U.S. as of August 2006, and sells an average of just two Ascenders per dealer per month. Plans to introduce a new Thai-built [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]], expected to be added for 2007, are shelved; Isuzu Motors Limited believes that a new SUV would be too risky and proceeds with the launch of the i-series trucks. Rumors of Isuzu's withdrawal from the U.S. market are rampant. Despite extremely low sales figures of 12,177 passenger vehicles for 2005 (with leftover Axiom and Rodeos making up 30% of this), Isuzu Motors America announces its first profit in years, mainly due to restructuring cuts.
* 2006 – Production of the 7-passenger Ascender ends in February with the closure of GM's [[Oklahoma City Assembly]] plant, leaving Isuzu with the 5-passenger Ascender, built in [[Moraine, Ohio]] and the low-selling i-Series as its only retail products. The company sold just 1,504 vehicles in North America in the first two months of 2006. GM ends its equity investment in Isuzu and sells all its shares to [[Mitsubishi Corporation]], [[Itochu]] and [[Mizuho Corporate Bank]], both GM and Isuzu claims the companies will continue their current relationship. There is no word as of April 12, 2006 on the effect this will have on [[DMAX (engines)|DMAX]] operations.

* June 2006 – Isuzu and GM agree to establish a joint venture called "LCV Platform Engineering Corporation (LPEC)" to develop a new pickup.  Isuzu says it will use its engineering expertise to develop the pickup and GM will develop derivatives based on the integrated platform.
* October 2006 – Mitsubishi Corp. becomes Isuzu's largest shareholder, after it converts all the preferred share in Isuzu it has held since 2005 into common stock, increasing its shareholding from 3.5% to 15.65%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mitsubish becomes top shareholder of Isuzu|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/10/04/mitsubish-becomes-top-shareholder-of-isuzu/|website=Autoblog|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* November 2006 – Toyota purchases 5.9% of Isuzu, becoming the third largest shareholder behind [[Itochu]] and [[Mitsubishi Corporation]], and the two companies agree to study possible business collaboration focusing on the areas of R&amp;D and production of diesel engines, related emissions-control, and other environmental technologies.
* January 2007 – Isuzu and General Motors update the LCV range with a 3.0 litre common rail diesel engine that has far more torque and power than its predecessor.
* August 2007 – Isuzu and Toyota agree to develop a 1.6-liter diesel engine for use in Toyota vehicles sold in European markets. Details of development, production and supply of the diesel engine, are still under discussion, but in principle, Isuzu will play the leading role. Production is scheduled to begin around 2012.

In most of [[Asia]] and [[Africa]], Isuzu is mostly known for trucks of all sizes, after Isuzu small automobile sales drastically plummeted and Isuzu had to drop all sales of sedans and compact cars in the late 1990s. In the days when Isuzu sold passenger cars, they were known for focusing on the [[Diesel engine|diesel-engined]] niche. In 1983, for instance, long before the explosion in diesel sales, diesels represented 63.4% of their passenger car production.&lt;ref name="WC84"&gt;{{Cite book | first = Jack K. | last = Yamaguchi | editor-last = Lösch | editor-first = Annamaria | title = Technology On Full Boost | journal = World Cars 1984 | publisher = L'Editrice dell'Automobile LEA/Herald Books | location = Pelham, NY | page = 66 | year = 1984 | isbn = 0-910714-16-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Isuzu abandoned the United States consumer market due to lack of sales.  Isuzu as a corporation has always been primarily a manufacturer of small to medium compact automobiles and commercial trucks of sizes medium duty and larger, but markets around the world show different needs.

Isuzu Motors America discontinued the sale of passenger vehicles in the United States effective January 31, 2009. The company explained to its dealers that it had not been able to secure replacements for the [[Isuzu Ascender]] and [[Isuzu i-Series]] that would be commercially viable. Isuzu sold 7,098 cars in the year 2007. This action did not affect Isuzu's commercial vehicle or industrial diesel engine operations in the United States.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt; Isuzu has a contract with [[Budget Truck Rental]] to manufacture their rental trucks, shared with [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[GMC (General Motors division)|GMC]], and [[Navistar International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.budgettruck.com/Company-Info.aspx |title=Company Info - Budget Truck Rental |publisher=Budgettruck.com |date=2007-12-30 |accessdate=2010-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070722075532/http://www.budgettruck.com/Company-Info.aspx |archivedate=2007-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, Isuzu was for many years a major supplier of light commercial and domestic vehicles to [[Holden]] (General Motors). However, by 2008, Holden was sourcing few Isuzus. At this time Isuzu began to sell the D-Max under the Isuzu name.

Isuzu's entry in the Thai market proved to be one of its most successful.

===Japan===
The Fujisawa Plant was built and opened for production November 1961. It is located at  Tsuchidana, [[Fujisawa, Kanagawa]], and is still producing commercial vehicles for domestic Japanese use and international exports. The Toghichi Plant, located at  Hakuchu, [[Ōhira, Tochigi|Ohira-Machi]], [[Tochigi, Tochigi]], is where the engines are currently built.

===Mimamori-kun Online service===
Mimamori-kun, which means to watch, monitor, or observe in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], (literally "Mr. Watcher")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isuzu.co.jp/world//press/2007/p_0531.html Official press release from Isuzu concerning Mimamori-kun]&lt;/ref&gt; is a commercial vehicle telematics service developed by Isuzu Motors for monitoring and tracking commercial vehicle operations and movements in Japan. The service uses [[GPS]] satellite tracking services, and began February 2004. It is connected to the internet and provides government mandated [[Hours of service|driver activity logs]], and records how long the driver was on-duty and how much time was spent driving.

The service also records when the driver took lunch breaks, where the truck stopped and for how long, and when the driver logged off for his duty shift. The service has been modified for personal use in Japan to keep track of family members, to include elderly members of health status and location of children for safety purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mimamori-kun.com/ Mimamori-kun personal service (Japanese)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the main features include Internet [[Digital Tachograph]], the first of its kind wirelessly in Japan, combined with hands-free communication, voice guidance, and text messages displayed from the dispatch office. The system also has a password enabled vehicle theft prevention feature that will not let the vehicle start without the driver having entered a password.

'''Jane Morris''' (née '''Jane Burden'''; 19 October 1839&amp;nbsp;– 26 January 1914) was an embroiderer and English [[Model (art)|artists' model]] who embodied the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]] [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]] of beauty. She was a model and [[muse]] to [[William Morris]] (1834–1896), the English [[textile design]]er, [[poetry|poet]], [[novel]]ist, [[translation|translator]], and [[Socialism|socialist activist]], whom she later married, and to [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]].

==Life==

[[File:Jane Burden at 18 by William Morris.jpg|thumb|Jane sketched by Morris at age 18, while engaged to him]]

[[File:Jane and May Morris circa 1865.jpg|thumb|Jane and May Morris, circa 1865]]
Jane Burden was born in [[Oxford]], the daughter of a [[stable]]man, Robert Burden, and his wife Ann Maizey, who was a laundress. At the time of her birth, her parents were living at St Helen's Passage, in the parish of [[St Peter-in-the-East]], off [[Holywell Street]] in Oxford which has since been marked with a [[blue plaque]].&lt;ref&gt;Lisle, Nicola, Cinderella story and others''[[Oxfordshire Limited Edition]]'', no. 249, pages 23–25, October 2007; and [http://www.oxfordshireblueplaques.org.uk/plaques/burden.html picture of blue plaque]&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother Ann was [[wikt:illiterate|illiterate]] and probably came to Oxford as a [[Domestic service|domestic servant]]. Little is known of Jane Burden's childhood, but it was poor and deprived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jane &amp; May Morris: A Biographical Story|last=Marsh|first=Jan|publisher=Printed Word|year=2000|isbn=|location=Horsham, UK|pages=5-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1857, Burden and her sister Elizabeth, known as "Bessie," attended a performance of the [[Drury Lane]] Theatre Company in Oxford. Jane Burden was noticed by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[Edward Burne-Jones]] who were members of a group of artists painting the [[Oxford Union murals]], based on [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] tales. Struck by her beauty, they asked her to [[Model (art)|model]] for them. Burden sat mostly for Rossetti as a model for Queen [[Guinevere]] and afterwards for [[William Morris]], who was working on an easel painting, ''La Belle [[Iseult]]'', now in the [[Tate Gallery]]. During this period, Morris fell in love with Burden and they became engaged, though by her own admission she was not in love with Morris.{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}

Burden's education was limited and she was probably destined to go into [[domestic service]] like her mother. After her engagement, she was privately educated to become a gentleman's wife. Her keen intelligence allowed her to recreate herself. She was a voracious reader who became proficient in French and Italian, and she became an accomplished pianist with a strong background in [[European classical music|classical music]]. Her manners and speech became refined to an extent that contemporaries referred to her as "Queenly." Later in life, she had no trouble moving in upper-class circles. She was possibly the model for the heroine of the 1884 novel ''Miss Brown'' by [[Vernon Lee]] upon which [[George Bernard Shaw]] based the character of Eliza Doolittle in his play ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'' (1914) and the later film ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' (1964). She also became a skilled needlewoman who would be later renowned for her embroideries.{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}

Jane married William Morris at [[St Michael at the Northgate]] in Oxford on 26 April 1859. Her father was described as a [[Groom (horses)|groom]], in stables at 65 [[Holywell Street]]. After the marriage, the Morrises lived at [[Red House (London)|Red House]] in [[Bexleyheath]], Kent. While living there, they had two daughters, [[Jane Alice Morris|Jane Alice]] "Jenny," born in January 1861, and [[May Morris|Mary "May"]] (March 1862–1938), who later edited her father's works. They moved to 26 Queen Square in London, which they shared with the design firm of [[Morris &amp; Co.|Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Co]]., and later bought Kelmscott House in [[Hammersmith]] as their main residence.{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}

In 1871, Morris and Rossetti took out a joint tenancy on [[Kelmscott Manor]] on the Gloucestershire–[[Oxfordshire]]–[[Wiltshire]] borders. William Morris went to [[Iceland]], leaving his wife and Rossetti to furnish the house and spend the summer there. Jane Morris had become closely attached to Rossetti and became a favourite muse of his. Their relationship is reputed to have started in 1865 and lasted, on differing levels, until his death in 1882. They shared a deep emotional relationship, and she inspired Rossetti to write poetry and create some of his best paintings. Her discovery of his dependence on the drug, [[chloral hydrate]], which was taken for insomnia, eventually led her to distance herself from him, although they stayed in touch until he died in 1882.{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}

In 1884, Jane Morris met the poet and political activist [[Wilfrid Scawen Blunt]] at a house party given by her close friend, [[Rosalind Howard, Countess of Carlisle|Rosalind Howard]] (later Countess of Carlisle). There appears to have been an immediate attraction between them. By 1887 at the latest, they had become lovers.&lt;ref&gt;Mancoff, p.98&lt;/ref&gt; Their sexual relationship continued until 1894 and they remained close friends until his death.{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}

Jane Morris was an ardent supporter of [[Irish Home Rule]].{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}

A few months before her death, she bought Kelmscott Manor to secure it for her daughters' future. However, she did not return to the house after having purchased it. Jane Morris died on 26 January 1914, while staying at 5 Brock Street in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]. She is buried in the churchyard of St. George's Church in [[Kelmscott]].{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}

'''Josephine Webb''' (born June 21, 1918) is an American electrical engineer who obtained two patents for oil [[circuit breaker]] contact design, known colloquially as "[[switchgear]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://societyofwomenengineers.swe.org/images/PDFs/swe%20women_transcript%20webb.pdf|title=INTERVIEW WITH JOSEPHINE WEBB, BY LAUREN KATA, MARCH 2 &amp; 3, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; She designed an eighteen-inch, full newspaper size [[fax machine]] with superior resolution. She co-founded Webb Consulting Company with her husband, also an electrical engineer. She is one of the first female electrical engineers, and considered a pioneer by the [[Society of Women Engineers]]. At Purdue University, she was one out of a total of five women engineers. She [[centenarian|turned 100]] in June 2018.

==Early life==

Webb was born '''Josephine Rohas''' in [[Niagara Falls, New York]]. She grew up in a one-parent household in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]; her father served in [[World War I]] and never returned home. Her brother, Roderick, was two-and-a-half years older. Webb considered him a great influence in her early life, and by causality, her later life. When Roderick became interested in radio, they both became ham radio operators. He helped her get her license. She joined the ham radio club at Kenmore High School. At thirteen years old, Josephine was the youngest YL operator.

As a child, Webb loved aviation and often visited the local airport. She was good at math and joined her high school's science club. She had always been fascinated by technical subjects. She graduated Kenmore High School in 1934. She worked for two years before attending Purdue University.

==Education==

Webb's brother urged her to apply to an out-of-state scholarship. She majored in [[electrical engineering]] and graduated from [[Purdue University]] in 1940. She became a Buhl Research Fellow in the Electrical Engineering Department of the Carnegie Institute of Technology for two years. She was a member of [[Sigma Xi]].

==Personal life==

Webb has two daughters, one was born in 1948 and the other 1952. The family had a laboratory, which was also set up as a measurements laboratory, as an addition to their home.

==Career==
In 1942, she joined [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]] as a Design Engineer. where among other duties, she worked on the electrical grids for the [[Grand Coulee Dam|Coulee]], [[Hoover Dam|Hoover]], and Boulder Dams. It was during her tenure with the company that she obtained two patents for oil circuit breaker contact design.

In 1946, Webb became Director of Development for the Facsimile Development Laboratory at the Alden Products Company where she designed an eighteen-inch, full newspaper size fax machine with exceptional resolution for that time. Later, Webb co-founded the Webb Consulting Company with her husband, Herbert Webb. They specialized in electrical-electronic measurement instrumentation, communications applications, and photographic test devices. They worked for clients as diverse as Boeing and the U.S. Bureau of Mines.

In addition to the consulting business, Webb also took a position in 1977 with [[North Idaho College]] where she began development of a Computer Center and worked on several government grants for enhancing the campus and its educational programs.

Webb holds four patents for her innovative work and has been active in many professional organizations including IEEE, NSPE, and SWE where she holds Fellows status.

A '''letter-quality printer''' was a form of [[Computer printer#Impact printers|computer impact printer]] that was able to print with the quality typically expected from a business [[typewriter]] such as an [[IBM]] [[Selectric]].

A letter-quality printer operates in much the same fashion as a [[typewriter]]. A metal or plastic printwheel embossed with letters, numbers, or symbols strikes an inked ribbon, depositing the ink (or carbon, if an expensive single-strike ribbon was installed) on the page and thus printing a character.  

Over time, several different technologies were developed including automating ordinary typebar typewriter mechanisms (such as the [[Friden Flexowriter]]), [[daisy wheel printer]]s (dating from a 1939 patent, but brought to life in the 1970s by Diablo engineer [[David S. Lee]]) where the [[Typesetting|type]] is moulded around the edge of a wheel, and "golf ball" (the popular informal name for "typeball", as used in the [[IBM Selectric typewriter]]) printers where the type is distributed over the face of a globe-shaped printhead (including automating [[IBM Selectric typewriter|IBM Selectric mechanisms]] such as the [[IBM 2741]] terminal). The daisy wheel and Selectric-based printers offered the advantage that the [[typeface]] was readily changeable by the user to accommodate varying needs.  

These printers were referred to as "letter-quality printers" during their heyday, and could produce text which was as clear and crisp as a typewriter (though they were nowhere near the quality of [[printing press]]es). Most were available either as complete [[computer terminal]]s with keyboards (or with a keyboard add-on option) that could double as a typewriter in stand-alone ("off-line") mode, or as print-only devices. Because of its low cost at the time, the daisy wheel printer became the most successful, the method used by Diablo, Qume, Brother and Apple.

Letter-quality impact printers, however, were slow, noisy, incapable of printing graphics or images&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |newspaper=Chicago Tribune 
|title=Dot-matrix Printers Sharpen Their Image
|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1989-06-04/business/8902060605_1_dot-matrix-near-letter-quality-nlq 
|date=June 4, 1989 |author1=Brit Hume  |author2=T.R. Reid}}&lt;/ref&gt; (unless the programmable microspacing and over-use of the dot were employed), sometimes limited to monochrome, and limited to a fixed set (usually one) of typefaces without operator intervention, though certain font effects like underlining and boldface could be achieved by overstriking. Soon, dot-matrix printers (such as the Oki Microline 84) would offer "Near Letter Quality" (NLQ) modes which were much faster than daisy-wheel printers, could produce graphics well, but were still very noticeably lower than "letter quality".  Nowadays, printers using non-impact printing (for example [[laser printer]]s, [[inkjet printer]]s, and other similar means) have replaced traditional letter-quality printers in most applications. The quality of inkjet printers can approach the old letter-quality impact printers (but can be limited by factors such as paper type).

==Use in word processing==
Dedicated [[word processor]]s and [[Comparison of early word processors|WP software for general-purpose computers]] that rose in popularity in the late 1970s and 1980s would use features such as microspacing (usually by 1/120 of an inch horizontally and, possibly, 1/48 of an inch vertically) to implement subscripts, proportional spacing, underlining, and so on. The more rudimentary software packages would implement bold text by overtyping the character in exactly the same spot (for example, using the backspace control code), but better software would print the letter in 3 slightly different positions. Software did exist to (slowly) produce pie charts on such printers (and on some daisywheels the dot was reinforced with metal to cope with extra wear).

'''Lifewire''' is a technology information and advice website.&lt;ref name=jordan /&gt; It was a top 10 technology-information site in 2017, reaching 6 million monthly US unique users each month.&lt;ref name=rebrand&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedrum.com/news/2017/03/02/the-verge-rebrand-aboutcom-launches-fourth-vertical-site|title=On the verge of a rebrand, About.com launches fourth vertical site|publisher=''The Drum''|date=March 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website's owner is [[Dotdash]], originally About.com, which launched Lifewire in 2016 as one of its spin-off [[vertical market|vertical sites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedrum.com/news/2017/05/02/aboutcom-changing-its-name-dotdash-it-looks-compete-with-the-big-boys-publishing|title=About.com is changing its name to Dotdash as it looks to compete with the big boys of publishing|publisher=''The Drum''|date=May 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Lifewire was the third standalone brand of About.com, an [[IAC (company)|IAC]]-owned media company, which broke up its collections of [[do it yourself|DIY]] and how-to information into branded vertical websites.&lt;ref name=jordan&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/25/about-com-launches-lifewire-a-tech-information-website/|title=About.com launches Lifewire, a tech information website|publisher=''Tech Crunch''|date=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lifewire was preceded by Verywell, a health info website, and The Balance, a personal finance site. Since About.com was one of the top 50 biggest sites online, Lifewire became a top 15 technology website in the [[United States]] as soon as it was launched in October 2016.&lt;ref name=digital /&gt;&lt;ref name=usa&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2017/02/17/change-its-name/97696156/|title=About.com is about to change its name|publisher=''USA Today''|date=February 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traffic for Lifewire rose between 65% and 70% from its launch till February 2017.&lt;ref name=usa /&gt;

==Content==

The purpose of Lifewire is to offer advice and answers on common technology questions and problems in a clear and simplified format.&lt;ref name=digital&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/digital/why-aboutcom-blew-itself-and-put-it-all-back-together-series-specialized-sites-174233/|title=Why About.com Blew Itself Up and Put It All Back Together, as a Series of Specialized Sites|publisher=''Adweek''|date=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When it was launched, Lifewire featured 16,000 articles written by 40 experts, teaching readers what is new in the world of technology and explaining how to better use devices they already own. Lifewire CEO described the website style "as if your [[best friends forever|BFF]] happened to be an [[iPhone]] expert."&lt;ref name=digital /&gt;

This '''list of broadcast formats''' is a review of the most popular formats used to broadcast video information over [[Cable television|Cable Television]], [[Satellite television|Satellite,]] the [[Internet]], and other means. Video broadcasting was popularized by the advent of the television during the middle of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.nyu.edu/classes/stephens/History%20of%20Television%20page.htm|title=Grolier Encyclopedia|last=Stephens|first=Mitchell|publisher=Grolier|year=2000|edition=2000|location=New York City|chapter=History of Television}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, [[Streaming media|Internet streaming]] has almost surpassed television as the top video broadcast platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://observer.com/2017/12/netflix-subscribers-vs-cable-subscribers-streaming-bigger-than-tv-info-details/|title=Netflix May Be Poised to Surpass Cable in the Near Future|date=2017-12-20|work=Observer|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Below is a '''list of broadcast video formats'''.

* '''[[24p]]''' is a [[progressive scan]] format and is now widely adopted by those planning on transferring a video signal to film. Film and video makers use 24p even if they are not going to transfer their productions to film, simply because of the on-screen "look" of the (low) frame rate, which matches native film. When transferred to NTSC television, the rate is effectively slowed to 23.976&amp;nbsp;FPS (24×1000÷1001 to be exact), and when transferred to PAL or SECAM it is sped up to 25&amp;nbsp;FPS. 35&amp;nbsp;mm movie cameras use a standard exposure rate of 24&amp;nbsp;FPS, though many cameras offer rates of 23.976&amp;nbsp;FPS for NTSC television and 25&amp;nbsp;FPS for PAL/SECAM. The 24&amp;nbsp;FPS rate became the [[de facto]] standard for sound motion pictures in the mid-1920s.&lt;ref name=Brownlow&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brownlow |first=Kevin |date=Summer 1980 |title=Silent Films: What Was the Right Speed? |journal=[[Sight &amp; Sound]] |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=164–167 |url=http://www.cinemaweb.com/silentfilm/bookshelf/18_kb_2.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708155615/http://www.cinemaweb.com/silentfilm/bookshelf/18_kb_2.htm |archivedate=8 July 2011 |accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Practically all [[Traditional animation|hand-drawn animation]] is designed to be played at 24&amp;nbsp;FPS. Actually hand-drawing 24 unique frames per second ("1's") is costly. Even in big budget films, usually hand-drawn animation is done [[traditional animation#.22Shooting on twos.22|shooting on "2's"]] (one hand-drawn frame is shown twice, so only 12 unique frames per second)&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.cartoon-factory.com/faq.html "How many cels does a typical cartoon yield?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519194454/http://www.cartoon-factory.com/faq.html |date=2011-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some animation is even drawn on "4's" (one hand-drawn frame is shown four times, so only six unique frames per second).

* '''25p''' is a progressive format and runs 25 progressive frames per second. This frame rate derives from the [[PAL]] television standard of 50i (or 50 [[Interlaced video|interlace]]d fields per second). Film and television companies use this rate in 50&amp;nbsp;Hz regions for direct compatibility with television field and frame rates. Conversion for 60&amp;nbsp;Hz countries is enabled by doing 2:2:3:2:3 pulldown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |title=2:2:3:2:3 Pulldown  |url=https://www.afterdawn.com/glossary/term.cfm/2_2_3_2_3_pulldown}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is similar to [[Telecine#2:3 pulldown|2:3 pulldown]], and the result looks identical to a typical film transfer. While 25p captures half the temporal resolution or motion that normal 50i PAL registers, it yields a higher vertical spatial resolution per frame. Like 24p, 25p is often used to achieve "cine"-look, albeit with virtually the same motion artifacts. It is also better suited to progressive-scan output (e.g., on LCD displays, computer monitors and projectors) because the interlacing is absent.
* '''29.97''' was the stated frame rate that NTSC legacy American [[Broadcast television systems|television broadcasts]] traditionally used, as specified by [[SMPTE 292M|SMPTE 294M]].  However this is a misnomer; in NTSC 59.94 images per second were transmitted, the first image of each pair containing the "odd" scanlines, and the second of each pair containing the "even" scanlines.   Each scan did produce a complete image, yielding 59.94 images per second.  Because the unscanned/blank lines were not transmitted, the resulting images were 1/2 height.  The television stretched them back out vertically by "double spacing" the scanlines it effectively "typed" across the face of the picture tube.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017|reason=Analog American TV was interlaced, not progressive, so this whole bullet point's content is questionable.   All these statements need to be checked and cited. Also, SMPTE 294M is not a description of broadcast formats, but of professional video transport during production, prior to broadcast, and is thus an inappropriate reference and link here.}} This was the standard format of American TVs due to the displaying of [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] screens which were common place before the wide spread use of digital monitors. Alternating currents are used to time each scan, by which two scans are performed per frame due to interlacing of the display. The [[NTSC]] method implemented in the display of televisions bandwidth of the frequency requires an odd integer multiple of the horizontal frequency divided into two separate interlacing parallel line patterns. The Horizontal frequency was 15,750. This format was the solution caused by the problem of 30 Frames per second is not able to output to the even integer by the odd integer multiple. Each conducted scan equals 262.5 rows on the television set with interlacing totaling 525 rows. Before 1953 the entire frequency band of the TV was divided between black and white image and sound, but after the introduction of color broadcasting to widespread commercial use, more information was needed to provide for the color. The space between each frequency on the band was dedicated as to not cause electromagnetic interference between the picture and the sound. 6&amp;nbsp;MHz is dedicated to each analog broadcasting station. 1.5&amp;nbsp;MHz of which is unusable due to the electromagnetic interference gap between frequencies. This format fell out of use because of the introduction of [[digital broadcasting]] and [[Live streaming|online streaming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=105381722|title=Analog TV Is Dead. Is Broadcast TV Dying?|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-12-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''30p''' is a progressive format and produces video at 30 frames per second. Progressive (noninterlaced) scanning mimics a film camera's frame-by-frame image capture. The effects of inter-frame [[Telecine#Telecine judder|judder]] are less noticeable than 24p yet retains a cinematic-like appearance. Shooting video in 30p mode gives no interlace artifacts but can introduce judder on image movement and on some camera pans. The widescreen film process [[Todd-AO]] used this frame rate in 1954–1956.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/widescreen/todd-aospecifications.htm Todd-AO Specifications at a Glance], Widescreen Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[High frame rate|48p]]''' is a progressive format and that is being trialled in the film industry. At twice the traditional rate of 24p, this frame rate attempts to reduce motion blur and flicker found in films. Director [[James Cameron]] stated his intention to film the two sequels to his film ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' higher than 24 frames per second to add a heightened sense of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Carolyn |last=Giardina |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/james-cameron-fully-intends-make-172916 |title=James Cameron 'Fully Intends' to Make 'Avatar 2 and 3' at Higher Frame Rates |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=March 30, 2011|accessdate=April 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first film to be filmed at 48&amp;nbsp;FPS was ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'', a decision made by its director [[Peter Jackson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Jackson|first=Peter|title=48 Frames Per Second |url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/peter-jackson/48-frames-per-second/10150222861171558 |work=Peter Jackson's Facebook page |publisher=[[Facebook]] |accessdate=12 April 2011 |date=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a preview screening at CinemaCon, the audience's reaction was mixed after being shown some of the film's footage at 48p, with some arguing that the feel of the footage was too lifelike (thus breaking the [[suspension of disbelief]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Walters |first=Florence |title=The Hobbit previews to mixed reactions |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/9225905/The-Hobbit-previews-to-mixed-reactions.html |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |date=25 April 2012 |accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''50i''' is an interlaced format and is the standard video field rate per second for [[PAL]] and [[SECAM]] television.
* '''60i''' is an [[Interlaced video|interlaced]] format and is the standard video [[Field (video)|field]] rate per second for NTSC television (e.g., in the US), whether from a broadcast signal, DVD, or home camcorder. This [[Interlaced video|interlace]]d field rate was developed separately by [[Philo Farnsworth|Farnsworth]] and [[Vladimir K. Zworykin|Zworykin]] in 1934,&lt;ref&gt;Gary Edgerton, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=28cMReggGGEC&amp;pg=PA51 The Columbia History of American Television]'', Columbia University Press, 2009, p. 51–52. {{ISBN|978-0-231-12165-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and was part of the [[NTSC]] television standards mandated by the FCC in 1941. When NTSC color was introduced in 1953, the older rate of 60 fields per second was reduced by a factor of 1000/1001 to avoid interference between the chroma subcarrier and the broadcast sound carrier. (Hence the usual designation "29.97&amp;nbsp;FPS" = 30 frames&amp;nbsp;(60 fields)/1.001)
* '''59.94p''' is the frame rate used for 720p broadcast HDTV, as specified in SMPTE 296M. It is also, in reality, the frame rate of 1080i broadcasts, which, like NTSC, send the "odd" scanlines in the first of each pair of frames (1/60th) and the "even" scanlines in the second frame of each pair.  It is purely custom to state the frame rate of the pair of frames as the actual frame rate but this is incorrect and causes great confusion.  There are two frames in each pair; each frame is a photograph of the image and can be thought of as a complete frame.  Each represents 1/60th /sec.   Each frame is sent as 1920 (width) x 540 (height with unscanned lines eliminated) x 59.94fps. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtechnology.com/media-systems/0191/whats-the-difference-between-fps-and-fps/241737|title=What's the difference between 59.94fps and 60fps?|last1=Soseman|first1=Ned|accessdate=12 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''50p'''/'''60p''' is a progressive format and is used in high-end HDTV systems. While it is not technically part of the [[ATSC]] or [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] broadcast standards yet, reports suggest that higher progressive frame rates will be a feature of the next-generation high-definition television broadcast standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hoffmann, Hans |author2=Takebumi Itagaki |author3=David Wood |author4=Alois Bock |title=Studies on the Bit Rate Requirements for a HDTV Format With 1920 × 1080 pixel Resolution, Progressive Scanning at 50&amp;nbsp;Hz Frame Rate Targeting Large Flat Panel Displays |url=http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/bitstream/2438/1181/1/Fullext.pdf |journal=IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting |volume=52 |issue=4 |date=December 2006 |pages=420–434 |doi=10.1109/tbc.2006.884735}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, the [[EBU]] considers 1080p50 the next step [[future proof]] system for TV broadcasts and is encouraging broadcasters to upgrade their equipment for the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=10 Things You Need to Know about 1080p50 |url=http://tech.ebu.ch/docs/events/ibc11-ebutechnical/presentations/ibc11_10things_1080p50.pdf |publisher=EBU Technical}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many modern cameras can shoot video at 50p and 60p in various resolutions. [[YouTube]] allowed users to upload videos at 60 FPS in June 2014. YouTube also allowed full HFR videos previously uploaded before 2014.
* '''72p''' is a progressive format and is currently{{when|date=February 2017}} in experimental stages. Major institutions such as [[Snell Limited|Snell]] have demonstrated 720p72 pictures as a result of earlier [[Analog television|analogue]] experiments, where 768&amp;nbsp;line television at 75&amp;nbsp;FPS looked subjectively better than 1150&amp;nbsp;line 50&amp;nbsp;FPS progressive pictures with higher [[shutter (photography)|shutter]] speeds available (and a corresponding lower [[Bit rate|data rate]]). Modern cameras such as the [[Red Digital Cinema Camera Company#The Red One|Red One]] can use this frame rate to produce [[slow motion]] replays at 24&amp;nbsp;FPS. [[Douglas Trumbull]], who undertook experiments with different frame rates that led to the [[Showscan]] film format, found that emotional impact peaked at 72&amp;nbsp;FPS for viewers.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}
* '''100p''' / '''119.88p''' / '''120p''' are progressive-scan formats standardized for [[Ultra-high-definition television|UHDTV]] by the [[Rec. 2020|ITU-R BT.2020 recommendation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3746">The '''Ministry of Popular Culture''' ({{lang-it|Ministero della Cultura Popolare}}, commonly abbreviated to '''MinCulPop''') was a [[ministry (government department)|ministry]] of the [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] government from 1937 to 1944. It was established by the [[Kingdom_of_Italy_under_Fascism_(1922–1943)|Fascist government]] in 1922 as the ''Press Office of the Presidency of the Council'', before being renamed to ''Press Office of the Head of Government'' in 1925. In 1934 it became the ''Secretariat for Press and Propaganda''. It became a ministry in 1935 and was given its definitive designation in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9QVL9LcEfjUC&amp;pg=PA70 Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany: the 'fascist' style of rule  By Alexander J. De Grand]&lt;/ref&gt; During its existence, it controlled most of the literary and radio channels in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=s3mw-IZom4sC&amp;pg=PA170 Ezra Pound: the tragic years, 1925-1972  By James J. Wilhelm]&lt;/ref&gt; It was the Italian analogue of the German [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]].

The Ministry famously outlawed the importation and translation of all American [[comic book]]s, with the lone exception of [[Mickey Mouse (comics)|Mickey Mouse]], in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilfoglio.it/recensioni/515 "Eccetto topolino" di F.

The Ministry was officially suppressed by the Kingdom of Italy on July 3, 1944, having remained vacant ever since the overthrow of [[Benito Mussolini]] in the [[25 Luglio]] coup a year earlier. During the [[Italian Social Republic]], Mussolini revived the Ministry of Popular Culture and appointed Ferdinando Mezzasoma as its head.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8877">'''Mouse keys''' is a feature of some [[graphical user interface]]s that uses the keyboard (especially [[numeric keypad]])
as a [[pointing device]] (usually replacing a [[Computer mouse|mouse]]). Its roots lie in the earliest days of [[visual editor]]s when line and column navigation was controlled with [[arrow keys]]
Today, mouse keys usually refers to the [[numeric keypad]] layout standardized with the introduction of the [[X Window System]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xfree86.org/current/XKBproto.pdf The X Keyboard Extension: Protocol Specification]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xfree86.org/current/XKBlib.pdf The X Keyboard Extension: Library Specification]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Historically, MouseKeys supported GUI programs when many [[Computer terminal#Graphical terminals|terminal]]s had no dedicated [[pointing device]]. As pointing devices became ubiquitous, the use of mouse keys narrowed to situations where a pointing device was missing, unusable, or inconvenient. Such situations may arise from the following:
*precision requirements (e.g., [[technical drawing]])
*[[accessibility|disabled user]] or ergonomics issues
*environmental limits (e.g., vibration in car or plane)
*broken/missing/unavailable equipment

The [[X Window System]] MouseKeysAccel control applies action (usually cursor movement) repeatedly while a direction key
{1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9} remains depressed.&lt;ref&gt;The X Keyboard Extension: Library Specification, Library Version 1.0/Document Revision 1.1, X Consortium Standard, X Version 11 / Release 6.4, Keyboard Controls, 10.5.2, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110517131044/http://cvsweb.xfree86.org/cvsweb/xc/doc/specs/XKB/XKBlib/allchaps.ps?rev=1.1&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup The MouseKeysAccel Control]&lt;/ref&gt; When the key is depressed, an ''action_delta'' is immediately applied.  If the key remains depressed, longer than ''mk_delay'' milliseconds, some action is applied every ''mk_interval'' milliseconds until the key is released. If the key remains depressed, after more than ''mk_time_to_max'' actions have been applied, ''action_delta'' magnified ''mk_max_speed'' times, is applied every ''mk_interval'' milliseconds.

The first ''mk_time_to_max'' actions increase smoothly according to an exponential.

Under the [[X Window System]]s [[X.Org Server|Xorg]] and [[XFree86]] used on [[Unix-like]] systems such as [[Linux]], [[BSD]], and [[AIX]], MouseKeys (and MouseKeysAccel) is nominally (de)activated by {{key press|Alt}}+{{key press|Left Shift}}+{{key press|Num Lock}}.&lt;ref&gt;The X Keyboard Extension: Library Specification, Library Version 1.0/Document Revision 1.1, X Consortium Standard, X Version 11 / Release 6.4, Keyboard Controls, 10.5.1, [http://cvsweb.xfree86.org/cvsweb/xc/doc/specs/XKB/XKBlib/allchaps.ps?rev=1.1&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup The MouseKeys Control] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517131044/http://cvsweb.xfree86.org/cvsweb/xc/doc/specs/XKB/XKBlib/allchaps.ps?rev=1.1&amp;content-type=text%2Fvnd.viewcvs-markup |date=2011-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; MouseKeys without acceleration (also known as plot mode) is sometimes available with Shift+NumLock. This is independent of the [[Window Manager]] in use and may be overridden by a [[configuration file]]. The setxkbmap utility can be used to temporary enable mouse keys under Xorg:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man7/xkeyboard-config.7.html |title=xkeyboard-config manual page |date=2012 |access-date=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;code&gt;setxkbmap -option keypad:pointerkeys&lt;/code&gt;

There are also various utilities to allow more precise control via user-configurable key bindings, such as [http://beesbuzz.biz/code/xmousekeys.php xmousekeys] and [http://www.semicomplete.com/projects/xdotool/ xdotool].

MouseKeys for [[Apple Inc]]'s [[Mac OS X]] is enabled and configured via the [[Accessibility]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.apple.com/accessibility/macosx/physical.html Apple.com, Mac OS X, Accessibility]&lt;/ref&gt; ([apple] → System Preferences → Accessibility → Mouse &amp; Trackpad).

[[Microsoft]] changed the method of enabling between [[Windows 2000]],&lt;ref&gt;Microsoft.com, Accessibility Tutorials, Windows 2000, [http://www.microsoft.com/enable/training/windows2000/default.aspx Turning MouseKeys On and Off]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Windows XP]] (added diagonal cursor movement and MouseKeysAccel),&lt;ref&gt;Microsoft.com, Accessibility Tutorials, Windows XP, [http://www.microsoft.com/enable/training/windowsxp/mousekeys.aspx MouseKeys: Control the Mouse Pointer Using the Numeric Keypad]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Windows Vista]].&lt;ref&gt;Microsoft.com, Accessibility Tutorials, Windows Vista, [http://www.microsoft.com/enable/training/windowsvista/mousekeys.aspx Control the mouse pointer with the keyboard (Mouse Keys)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common usage==
===Replacing the mouse keys===
 
Replacing the mouse keys by the numeric keypad is as follows:
 
Typing {{key press|5}} (with the numeric keypad) is equivalent to clicking the selected button. By default, the selected button is the primary button (nominally under [[index finger]], left button for most right-handed people and right button for most left-handed people). Typing {{key press|-}} (with the numeric keypad) selects the alternate button (nominally under [[ring finger]], right button for most right-handed people and left button for most left-handed people). Typing {{key press|*}} (with the numeric keypad) selects the modifier button (nominally under the [[middle finger]], middle button of a 3-button mouse). Typing {{key press|/}} (with the numeric keypad) selects the primary button. The selection remains in effect until a different button is selected.

Assignment of left/middle/right button to primary/modifier/alternate, alternate/modifier/primary, or something else is settable by many means. Some mice have a switch, that swaps assignment of right and left keys. Many laptop bioses have a setting for mouse button assignment. Many window managers have a setting that permutes the assignment. Within the [[X Window System core protocol]], permutation can be applied by xmodmap(1).

===Moving the pointer by keys===

Other than {{key press|5}}, all other numeric keys from the numeric keypad are used to move the pointer on the screen. For example, {{key press|8}} will move the pointer upwards, while {{key press|1}} will move it diagonally downwards to the left.

'''Net2phone''' provides [[VoIP]] and [[cloud computing]]-based [[telephony]] products and services. The company is a subsidiary of [[IDT Corporation]].

==History==
The company was founded in 1990.

On July 30, 1999, during the [[dot-com bubble]], the company became a [[public company]] via an [[initial public offering]], raising $81 million. Shares rose 77% on the first day of trading to $26 per share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB933267659368889764 | title=Net2Phone Shares Gain 77% After $81 Million Offering | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=July 30, 1999}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completion of the IPO, IDT owned 57% of the company.&lt;ref name=hot/&gt; Within a few weeks, the shares increased another 100% in value, to $53 per share.&lt;ref name=hot&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ipo-report-net2phone-hot-as-post-ipo-quiet-period-ends | title=Net2Phone hot as post-IPO quiet period ends | first=STEVE | last=GELSI | work=[[Marketwatch]] | date=August 24, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2000, in a transaction facilitated by IDT CEO [[Howard Jonas]], a consortium of telecommunications companies led by [[AT&amp;T]] announced a $1.4 billion investment for a 32% stake in the company, buying shares for $75 each. The transaction was completed in August 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/2000/04/03/mu1.html | title=AT&amp;T, Yahoo! Invest In Net2Phone | first=Kathleen | last=Cholewka | work=[[Forbes]] | date=April 3, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AOL]] had expressed an interest in buying all or part of the company but was not agreeable to the price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/at-t-trumps-aol-buys-into-net2phone/ | title=AT&amp;T trumps AOL, buys into Net2Phone | first=Larry | last=Dignan | work=[[ZDNet]] | date=March 31, 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the company acquired [[Aplio]].

In August 2000, Jonathan Fram, president of the company, left to join [[eVoice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB967229330755943888 | title=Net2Phone President Departs To Run Closely Held eVoice | first=Sharon | last=Cleary | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=August 25, 2000}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/former-net2phone-president-joins-evoice-as-ceo | title=Net2Phone’s president leaving | first=DEBRA | last=MCGARRY | work=[[Marketwatch]] | date=August 25, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2000, the company formed Adir Technologies, a [[joint venture]] with [[Cisco Systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/net2phone-cisco-form-voip-network-management-venture | title=Net2Phone, Cisco form VoIP venture | first=CARL  | last=CORRY | work=[[Marketwatch]] | date=September 18, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://money.cnn.com/2000/09/18/technology/net2phone/index.htm | title=Cisco calls on Net2Phone | work=[[CNNMoney]] | date=September 18, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2002, the company sued Cisco for breach of contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.itworld.com/article/2793929/business/net2phone--adir-sue-cisco-over-voip-technology.html | title=Net2Phone, ADIR sue Cisco over VoIP technology | first=Amy | last=Bennett | work=[[International Data Group]] | date=March 20, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the company acquired iPing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.internetnews.com/asp-news/article.php/803871/Net2Phone+Acquires+iPing.htm | title=Net2Phone Acquires iPing | first=Ryan   | last=Naraine | work=[[QuinStreet]] | date=July 18, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2002, the company announced 110 layoffs, or 28% of its workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1014328601570859880 | title=Net2Phone Cuts More Jobs | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=February 21, 2002}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2004, Liore Alroy became chief executive officer of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB109594618962625996 | title=Net2Phone Names New CEO, Changes Board Structure | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=September 23, 2004}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 13, 2006, IDT acquired the shares of the company that it did not already own for $2.05 per share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20060313006110/en/IDT-Announces-Completion-Acquisition-Net2Phone | title=IDT Announces Completion of Acquisition of Net2Phone | publisher=[[Business Wire]] | date=March 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''PLECS''' ([[Piecewise linear function|Piecewise Linear]] [[Electronic circuit simulation|Electrical Circuit Simulation]]) is a software tool for system-level simulations of [[electrical circuit]]s developed by [[Plexim]].&lt;ref&gt;Allmeling 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is especially designed for [[power electronics]] but can be used for any [[electrical network]].

==Integration with MATLAB/Simulink or standalone==
The program [[Simulink]] is ideally suited for the simulation of controls. Therefore, [[Simulink]] is also a convenient tool for the design of [[Feedback|closed loop]] controlled electrical systems. PLECS enhances [[Simulink]] with the capability to simulate [[electrical circuit]]s directly. The user can simply enter a circuit as a [[Circuit diagram|schematic]] of electrical components. At [[Simulink]] block level the circuit is represented as a subsystem, so the user can build controls and other non-electrical elements around it and take full advantage of the [[Simulink]] environment and its toolboxes.

The concept of integration into [[Simulink]] has the advantage that only the part of the system in which electrical units are of interest needs to be modeled as an [[electrical circuit]]. The simulation of all non-electrical parts such as controls and mechanics should be done in [[Simulink]].&lt;ref&gt;Ciobotaru 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[MATLAB]] can be employed to compute circuit parameters and to post process and visualize the simulation results.

===Standalone version===
There is also a [[Computer process|standalone]] version of PLECS that allows simulation of [[electrical circuit]]s and  [[Control theory|control]] [[control system|system]]s directly within the PLECS package. The standalone version uses [[GNU Octave]] as its numerical engine in place of MATLAB.

==Semiconductors modeled as ideal switches==
Most [[Electronic circuit simulation|circuit simulation programs]] model switches as highly nonlinear elements. Due to steep voltage and current [[Transient (oscillation)|transient]]s, the simulation becomes slow when switches are toggled. In the most simple case a switch is modeled as a variable resistance that changes between a very small and a very large value. In other cases, it is represented by a sophisticated semiconductor model.

When simulating complex [[power electronics|power electronic systems]], however, the processes during switching are of little interest.  Here, it is more appropriate to use ideal switches that toggle instantaneously between a closed and an open circuit.  This approach, which is implemented in PLECS, has two major advantages: Firstly, it yields systems that are [[Piecewise linear function|piecewise-linear]] across switching instants, (thus resolving the otherwise difficult problem of simulating the non-linear discontinuity that occurs in the equivalent-circuit at the switching instant).  Secondly, to handle discontinuities at the switching instants, only two integration steps are required (one for before the instant, and one after).  Both of these advantages speed up the simulation considerably.

'''PROJ.4''' (or '''proj''') is a [[Library (computing)|library]] for performing conversions between [[cartographic projection]]s. The library is based on the work of Gerald Evenden at the [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]],&lt;ref name="ofr90284"&gt;{{cite book |first=Gerald I. |last=Evenden |title=Cartographic Projection Procedures for the UNIX Environment—A User's Manual |publisher=[[U.S. Geological Survey]] |series=Open-File Report 90-284 |orig-year=1990 |date=2003-01-01 |pages=64 |url=http://download.osgeo.org/proj/OF90-284.pdf |accessdate=2015-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but is now an [[OSGeo]] project maintained by Howard Butler. The library also ships with [[executable]]s for performing these transformations from the [[command line]].

==History==
The first release of proj was developed by Gerald Evenden in the early 1980s as a [[Ratfor]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gerald I. |last=Evenden |date=1983 |title=Forward and inverse cartographic projection procedures |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |series=Open-File Report 83-625 |pages=76 |url=https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr83625 |accessdate=2015-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was based on the General Cartographic Transformation Package or GCTP, which consisted of [[Fortran]] subroutines that could be used to project geographic data. The second release of proj from 1985 was rewritten in [[C (programming language)|C]] to run on [[UNIX]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gerald I. |last=Evenden |first2=J.M. |last2=Botbol |date=1985 |title=User's manual for MAPGEN (UNIX version); a method of transforming digital cartographic data to a map |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |series=Open-File Report 85-706 |pages=140 |url=https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr85706 |accessdate=2015-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The third release of proj from 1990, named PROJ.3, was expanded to support approximately 70 cartographic projections.&lt;ref name="ofr90284" /&gt; Evenden further developed a fourth release in 1994, named PROJ.4, which is the current name of the software. The last version maintained by Evenden was 4.3, released on September 24, 1995.

After over four years of inactivity, Frank Warmerdam became the new maintainer and released version 4.4 on March 21, 2000. As of May 2008, PROJ.4 become part of the [[Open_Source_Geospatial_Foundation#Geospatial_Libraries |MetaCRS]] project, a confederation of coordinate systems related projects under incubation with [[OSGeo]].

In February 2018, the PROJ.4 product became PROJ, as it reaches the major version 5. As Kristian Evers says on proj@lists.maptools.org :
 - The PROJ.4 project provides the product PROJ, which is now at version 5.0.0.
 - The foundational component of PROJ is the library libproj.
 - Other PROJ components include the application proj, which provides a command line interface to libproj.
 - The PROJ.4 project also distributes the datum-grid package, which at the time of writing is at version 1.6.0.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5458">In [[computing]], a '''polyglot''' is a [[computer program]] or [[script (computer programming)|script]] written in a valid form of multiple [[programming language]]s, which performs the same operations or output independent of the programming language used to compile or interpret it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Fjeldberg |first=Hans- |date=2008 |title=Polyglot Programming - A Business Perspective |type=M.Sc |publisher=Norwegian University of Science and Technology |url=http://theuntitledblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/polyglot_programming-a_business_perspective.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally polyglots are written in a combination of [[C (programming language)|C]] (which allows redefinition of tokens with a [[preprocessor]]) and a [[scripting language]] such as [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], [[Perl]] or [[Unix shell|sh]].

[[Polyglot markup|'''Polyglot''' markup]] is similar, but about [[markup language]] context.

[[Polyglot Persistence|'''Polyglot''' persistence]] is similar, but about [[database|databases]].

== Methods ==
The two most commonly used techniques for constructing a polyglot program are to make liberal use of languages that use different characters for comments and to redefine various tokens as others in different languages. Often good use is made of [[syntax]] quirks. These are demonstrated in this [[public domain]] polyglot written in [[ANSI C]], [[PHP]] and [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]]:

 #define a /*
 #&lt;?php
 echo "\010Hello, world!\n";// 2&gt; /dev/null &gt; /dev/null \ ;
 // 2&gt; /dev/null; x=a;
 $x=5; // 2&gt; /dev/null \ ;
 if (($x))
 // 2&gt; /dev/null; then
 return 0;
 // 2&gt; /dev/null; fi
 #define e ?&gt;
 #define b */
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 #define main() int main(void)
 #define printf printf(
 #define true )
 #define function
 function main()
 {
 printf "Hello, world!\n"true/* 2&gt; /dev/null | grep -v true*/;
 return 0;
 }
 #define c /*
 main
 #*/

Note the following:
*A hash sign marks a [[preprocessor]] statement in C, but is a comment in both bash and PHP.
*"//" is a comment in both PHP and C and the [[root directory]] in bash.
*Shell redirection is used to eliminate undesirable outputs.
*Even on commented out lines, the "&lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/tt&gt;" and "&lt;tt&gt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;" PHP indicators still have effect.
*The statement "&lt;tt&gt;function main()&lt;/tt&gt;" is valid in both PHP and bash; C #defines are used to convert it into "&lt;tt&gt;int main(void)&lt;/tt&gt;" at compile time.
*Comment indicators can be combined to perform various operations.
*"&lt;tt&gt;if (($x))&lt;/tt&gt;" is a valid statement in both bash and PHP.
*&lt;tt&gt;printf&lt;/tt&gt; is a bash [[shell builtin]] which is identical to the C printf except for its omission of brackets (which the C preprocessor adds if this is compiled with a C compiler).
*The final three lines are only used by bash, to call the &lt;tt&gt;main&lt;/tt&gt; function. In PHP the &lt;tt&gt;main&lt;/tt&gt; function is defined but not called and in C there is no need to explicitly call the &lt;tt&gt;main&lt;/tt&gt; function.

Some less-common languages also offer possibilities to create Polyglot code. Here is a small sample, written simultaneously in [[SNOBOL]]4, [[Forth (programming language)|Win32Forth]], [[PureBasic]]v4.x, and [[REBOL]]:
 *BUFFER : A.A ; .( Hello, world !) @ To Including?
 Macro SkipThis; OUTPUT = Char(10) "Hello, World !"
 ;OneKeyInput  Input('Char', 1, '[-f2-q1]')  ; Char
 End; SNOBOL4 + PureBASIC + Win32Forth + REBOL = &lt;3
 EndMacro: OpenConsole() : PrintN("Hello, world !")
 Repeat : Until Inkey() :  Macro SomeDummyMacroHere
 REBOL  [ Title:  "'Hello, World !' in 4 languages"
 CopyLeft:  "Developed in 2010 by Society" ]  Print
 "Hello, world !"  EndMacro:  func  [][]  set-modes
 system/ports/input [binary: true] Input  set-modes
 system/ports/input  [binary: false] NOP:: EndMacro
 ; Wishing to refine it with new language ? Go on !

The term is sometimes applied to programs that are valid in more than one language, but do not strictly perform the same function in each. One use for this form is a file that runs as a [[DOS]] batch file, then re-runs itself in [[Perl]]:

 @rem = ' --PERL--
 @echo off
 perl "%~dpnx0" %*
 goto endofperl
 @rem ';
 #!perl
 print "Hello, world!\n";
 __END__
 :endofperl

This allows creating Perl scripts that can be run on DOS systems with minimal effort.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8632">'''The Real Time Information Group''' (also '''RTI''') is  an organisation in the [[United Kingdom]] supporting the development of bus [[passenger information system]]s; its 85 members include [[local authorities]], [[bus]] operators and system suppliers together with representatives from the [[UK government]] and other key industry groups such as ITS(UK), Travel Information Highway, and the UTMC Development Group (UDG).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtig.org.uk/links.htm |title=Links |publisher=RTIG |accessdate=2010-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912082943/http://www.rtig.org.uk/links.htm |archivedate=September 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main output of the group is guidelines, standards, case studies and best practice documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtig.org.uk/downloads.htm |title=downloads |publisher=RTIG |accessdate=2010-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912122721/http://www.rtig.org.uk/downloads.htm |archivedate=September 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These documents are produced by RTIG on behalf of its members, usually with the assistance of specialist working groups.

== History ==
In 2000, when real-time information (RTI) systems were beginning to be considered by UK local authorities to provide travellers with up-to-the-minute bus arrival and departure passenger information, it was realised that cross-boundary bus services made it imperative to coordinate projects around the UK. Technical and operational standards would therefore be required. A group of local authorities and bus operators began to meet regularly to discuss how to achieve this; and so RTIG was born.

Substantial government funding for projects around the UK, in particular from 2002 to 2004, provided an enormous boost to the development of RTI systems. The expanding and maturing market caused RTIG to reflect on its role, and in 2003 it determined to recreate itself as a subscription group - with the important step that the systems industry was to be a full and equal partner in its work. Equally importantly, it has maintained excellent links with central UK Government, from whom the Group continues to receive project funding for work of national scope and importance.

The National RTI Strategy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtig.org.uk/RTIG_Web_Docs/Public/Strategic/RTIGS006-1.0%20National%20Strategy.pdf|title=National RTI Strategy|publisher=RTIG|accessdate=2010-02-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118201508/http://www.rtig.org.uk/RTIG_Web_Docs/Public/Strategic/RTIGS006-1.0%20National%20Strategy.pdf|archive-date=2008-11-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ratified in March 2007, establishes a framework for how industry stakeholders and government need to work together to deliver benefit to passengers. RTIG's role has, as a consequence, been expanded to cover all aspects of technology in public transport, from systems to support disabled travellers through to [[safety]] and [[security]] systems.

== Annual survey ==
In 2002 the group produced the first UK Annual RTI Survey, which surveyed the use of RTI technology by local authorities and [[passenger transport executive]]s across [[England]], as well as plans for the following two years. In 2004 the survey was extended to include [[Wales]] and in 2005 [[Scotland]].

In order to reflect the widening deployment of bus-related technologies, the 2006 annual survey was re-branded as the ‘RTIG Passenger Transport Technology Survey’[http://www.rtig.org.uk/RTIG_Web_Docs/Public/Project/RTIG-PR007-D002-1.0%20Transport%20Technology%20Survey.pdf]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} and included questions on services for disabled travellers – partly in response to new obligations on bus operators under the [[Disability Discrimination Act 2005]]. The 2007 survey continues to focus broadly on public transport and traffic management technology and has been expanded to include questions on bus [[CCTV]] and other security technologies. The 2007 report is expected to be publicly available in the first quarter of 2008.

The annual survey provides details on:

*Number of RTI equipped buses in [[Great Britain]]
*Number of RTI signs in GB
*Use of [[sound|audio]] equipment on and off buses in GB
*Costs of implementing and maintaining RTI in GB
*Trends in integration of RTI with [[UTMC]] technology
*The provision of information for disabled travellers in GB
*Passenger and driver security systems (on and off bus)

== Working Groups ==
The majority of the documents, standards and guidelines produced by RTIG is done with the assistance of voluntary working groups. These working groups are made up of industry experts who lend their knowledge to particular projects. Examples of RTIG working groups include:

*Data Suppliers Working Group
*Shelter Implementation Working Group
*Disability Working Group
*On-bus architecture Working Group
*GPRS Interface Working Group

Working groups involve non-members where relevant; so, the Disability WG includes representatives from charities such a [[RNIB]] and [[The Guide Dogs for the Blind Association|Guide Dogs]].

== The RTIG library ==
The RTIG library houses all of the documents produced by the group to date. These documents are held by RTIG electronically and distributed to members on request, or via the ‘members area’ of the RTIG website. The library catalogue is publicly available from the RTIG website [https://web.archive.org/web/20080827180958/http://www.rtig.org.uk/RTIG_Web_Docs/Public/Library%20Catalogues/RTIGP003%20-%20RTIG%20Library%20Catalogue%20May%202007%20cut.pdf].

Members have access to a wider range of standards and guidelines, and to the outputs of RTIG workshops (see below).

The group also publishes a quarterly newsletter which provides both members and non-members with news on RTIG projects and events.

== RTIG workshops ==
RTIG runs quarterly [[workshops]], which are held at a different UK venue each time. Each workshop has a central theme and attract [[presentations]] from a wide variety of stakeholders. Workshops will include an update on ITS news, an update on RTIG projects and working group activities, and a set of presentations based around the workshop theme.

Previous workshop venues (and their respective themes) include [https://web.archive.org/web/20070918052248/http://www.rtig.org.uk/events.htm]:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5095">[[File:Reformed methanol fuel cell (block diagram).jpg|thumb|block diagram of a Reformed Methanol Fuel Cell]]

'''Reformed Methanol Fuel Cell''' ('''RMFC''') or '''Indirect Methanol Fuel Cell''' (IMFC) systems are a subcategory of [[proton exchange membrane fuel cell|proton-exchange fuel cells]] where, the fuel, [[methanol]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH), is reformed, before being fed into the [[fuel cell]]. RMFC systems offer advantages over [[direct methanol fuel cell]] (DMFC) systems including higher efficiency, smaller cell stacks, no water management, better operation at low temperatures, and storage at sub-zero temperatures because methanol is a liquid from -97.0&amp;nbsp;°C to 64.7&amp;nbsp;°C (-142.6&amp;nbsp;°F to 148.5&amp;nbsp;°F). The tradeoff is that RMFC systems operate at hotter temperatures and therefore need more advanced heat management and insulation. The waste products with these types of fuel cells are [[carbon dioxide]] and water.

[[Methanol]] is used as a fuel because it is naturally hydrogen dense (a hydrogen carrier) and can be [[steam reforming|steam reformed]] into hydrogen at low temperatures compared to other [[hydrocarbon]] fuels. Additionally, methanol is naturally occurring, [[biodegradable]], and energy dense.

RMFC systems consist of a [[fuel processing system]] (FPS),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.istanbul.edu.tr/eng/ee/jeee/main/pages/issues/is51/51005.pdf fuel processing system]&lt;/ref&gt; a [[fuel cell]], a fuel cartridge, and the BOP (the [[balance of plant]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fuelcellseminar.com/pdf/2005/Thursday-Nov17/Fisher_Allison_275.PDF Balance of plant] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070411183650/http://www.fuelcellseminar.com/pdf/2005/Thursday-Nov17/Fisher_Allison_275.PDF |date=2007-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storage==
The fuel cartridge stores the [[methanol]] fuel, which is often diluted with up to 40% (by volume) water.

==Fuel processing system (FPS) in==
[[Methanol]]→[[Partial oxidation]](POX)/[[Autothermal reforming]] (ATR)→[[Water gas shift]] reaction (WGS)→[[preferential oxidation]] (PROX)
The reformer converts methanol to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a reaction that occurs at temperatures of 250&amp;nbsp;°C to 300&amp;nbsp;°C.

==Fuel cell==
→The [[membrane electrode assembly]] (MEA) fuel cell stack produces electricity in a reaction that combines H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (reformed from methanol in the fuel processor) and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and produces water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) as a byproduct.

==Fuel processing system (FPS) out==

==Balance of plant==
The balance of plant (BOP) consists of any [[fuel pump]]s, [[Gas compressor|air compressors]], and [[fan (implement)|fans]] required to circulate the gas and liquid in the system.  A control system is also often needed to operate and monitor the RMFC.

==State of development==
RMFC systems have reached an advanced stage of development.  For instance, a small system developed by Ultracell for the United States military, [http://www.ultracell-llc.com/assets/XX55_Data_Sheet_26-Jun-2013.pdf], has met [http://mae.pennnet.com/articles/article_display.cfm?Section=ARTCL&amp;C=News&amp;ARTICLE_ID=298419&amp;KEYWORDS=%22ultracell%22&amp;p=32 environmental tolerance], [http://rfdesign.com/military_defense_electronics/CERDEC-methanol-fuel-cell-system-0607/index.html safety], and performance goals set by the [[United States Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center]], and is commercially available.

Larger systems [http://www.serenergy.com/H3_350_Battery_Charger.htm 350W] to 8 MW are also available for multiple applications, such as power plant generation, backup power generation and battery range extension. One application in the field is improving performance of a heavy duty smaller electric vehicle [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKLaP5ytwxw Video of solution]

The [[Research Triangle]] region of [[North Carolina]] received its name as an extension of the name of the park.  Besides the three anchor cities, the park is also bounded by the communities of [[Morrisville, North Carolina|Morrisville]] and [[Cary, North Carolina|Cary]]. Approximately one fourth of the park's territory lies in [[Wake County, North Carolina|Wake County]], but the majority of its land is in [[Durham County, North Carolina|Durham County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waywelivednc.com/maps/historical/rtp.pdf|title=Research Triangle Park}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, Scott Levitan was named the organization's new President and CEO, making him the 9th leader since the foundation was established.

== History ==
Following World War II, North Carolina's economy could no longer depend upon their traditional industries of agriculture, textiles, and furniture; their market share was in decline and jobs were leaving. Academics at N.C. State and Duke came up with the idea of creating the park so that the universities could do research together, leverage the area's strengths, and keep graduates in state.&lt;ref name="Our State Magazine"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ourstate.com/research-triangle-park/|title=The Man and Plan Behind Research Triangle Park – Our State Magazine|date=2014-08-25|work=Our State Magazine|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Established in 1951 and located in North Carolina, Research Triangle Park was created to increase innovation in the area. It is bordered by Duke University, North Carolina State University, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. At first, the park struggled to recruit innovators, but in 1965, Research Triangle Park saw its largest surge of growth, thanks to heavy recruiting by the state's government and Archibald (Archie) Davis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Link|first=Albert N.|last2=Scott|first2=John T.|date=2003|title=The Growth of Research Triangle Park|jstor=40229257|journal=Small Business Economics|volume=20|issue=2|pages=167–175|doi=10.2307/40229257}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their article "The Growth of Research Triangle Park," Link and Scott posit that entrepreneurial culture and, especially, leadership contributed the most to its success as a cluster. Archie Davis promoted a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship by locating the park near universities, actively recruiting organizations (like the American Academy of Arts and Sciences), and used his vision to raise funding for the park.

Davis strongly believed that profits could not be the only driver for creating the park - the betterment of the community should be the key goal. "The love of this state … was the motivation for the Research Triangle idea," he said. "Research Triangle is a manifestation of what North Carolina is all about." Research Triangle Park remains a nonprofit.&lt;ref name="Our State Magazine"/&gt;

==Local government==
The park is an [[unincorporated area]], and state law prohibits municipalities from annexing areas within the park.&lt;ref&gt;"Could RDU do more for Durham?", Raleigh News &amp; Observer, 13-Sept-2009, p.13A&lt;/ref&gt; Some local government functions are served by the Durham-Wake Counties Research and Production Service District, a special tax district created in 1986&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.durham-nc.com/resources/pdf/tourmap_drive.pdf|title=Self-Driving Tour of Research Triangle Park|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401085734/http://www.durham-nc.com/resources/pdf/tourmap_drive.pdf|archivedate=2012-04-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://godoggo.org/files/maps/rtp.pdf|title=The Research Triangle Park Jogging &amp; Pedestrian Trails}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is conterminous with the park, wherein the property tax rate is limited to 10 cents per $100 valuation.&lt;ref name="thertpblog.org"&gt;{{cite web |author=Choose RTP Park Life About RTP Contact Us Blog |url=http://thertpblog.org/2012/07/31/master-plan-update-legislative-changes-approved/ |title=Master Plan Update: Legislative Changes Approved |publisher=The RTP Blog |date=2012-07-31 |accessdate=2013-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819041459/http://thertpblog.org/2012/07/31/master-plan-update-legislative-changes-approved/ |archivedate=2012-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The park has special zoning as a Research Applications District in the Wake County portion, and a Scientific Research Park in the Durham County portion.

==Master Plan, Redevelopment, and Park Center==
On October 1, 2015, former President and CEO of the Research Triangle Foundation, Bob Geolas, announced RTP's plans for a $50 million redevelopment involving the formation of "Park Center." $20 million will be allocated from Durham County, $10 million from the Durham-Wake Counties Research and Production Service District, and $20 million as a result of land purchases and site work provided by the Research Triangle Foundation of North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = RTP Reveals Park Center Plan - The Research Triangle Park|url = https://www.rtp.org/rtp-reveals-park-center-plan/|website = The Research Triangle Park|access-date = 2016-01-29|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Park Center is to be over 300,000 square feet of public space at the heart of the Research Triangle Park. This public area will include retail outlets, food and beverage venues, and entertainment space. Geolas states that "We want to make all of this as local as possible. I would like to have as few chains, no chains if we could. I'd love for it all to be local. Local coffee, local food, local produce, local products."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Park Center Redevelopment|url = https://www.rtp.org/about-us/park-center/|website = The Research Triangle Park|access-date = 2016-01-29|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The redevelopment plans also include exploring partnerships with regional transit groups. The hope of the Research Triangle Foundation is to broaden public transportation to and from the area. According to Geolas, "We are currently having discussions about bringing the Regional Transit Center over to Park Center so that we can connect with all of our transit links." A public commuter rail is also in talks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = RTP Announces $50M for Park Center Development|url = https://vimeo.com/141200953|website = Vimeo|access-date = 2016-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subsidiaries of The Research Triangle Park Foundation ==
The Research Triangle Park Foundation operates three buildings within RTP. These three buildings are The Frontier, The Lab, and The Archie K. Davis Conference Center. The Frontier is a collaboration space that was first opened in January 2015. Since its inception, over 20,000 visitors have come through The Frontier's doors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rtp.org/about-us/the-frontier/|title=The Frontier|website=The Research Triangle Park|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lab is a full-service lab and office space that houses multiple [[Research and development|Research and Development]] companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rtp.org/about-us/thelab/|title=The Lab - The Research Triangle Park|website=The Research Triangle Park|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Archie K. Davis Conference Center is a 6,800-square-foot event space. The AKD Conference Center is also home to the Research Triangle Park Foundation main offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rtp.org/events/reserve-conference-room/|title=About The AKD Conference Center - The Research Triangle Park|website=The Research Triangle Park|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Shukhov cracking process''' is a [[Cracking (chemistry)|thermal cracking]] process invented by [[Vladimir Shukhov]] and Sergei Gavrilov.  Shukhov designed and built the first thermal [[Cracking (chemistry)|cracking]] techniques important to the [[petrochemical industry]]. His patent (Shukhov cracking process – patent of [[Russian empire]] No. 12926 from November 27, 1891) on cracking was used to invalidate [[Standard Oil]]'s patents ([[Burton process]] – Patent of United States  No. 1,049,667 on January 7, 1913) on [[Oil refinery|oil refineries]]. In 1937 the Shukhov cracking process  was superseded by [[catalytic cracking]]. It is still in use today to produce [[Diesel fuel|diesel]].

'''Soho Foundry''' is a [[factory]] created in 1795 by [[Matthew Boulton]] and [[James Watt]] and their sons [[Matthew Robinson Boulton]] and [[James Watt Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|1995|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Smethwick]], [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]], [[England]] ({{gbmapping|SP037885}}), for the manufacture of [[steam engine]]s. Now owned by [[Avery Weigh-Tronix]], it is used for the manufacture of [[Weighing scale|weighing machines]].

The early history of the Soho Foundry is of pivotal importance both to the history of the [[industrial revolution]] and to the study of the development of [[management theory]]. The Soho Foundry stood out from other factories of the day in the sophistication of its planning, its production processes and its management techniques; practising concepts that wouldn't become commonplace until a century later.&lt;ref name="USArmy"&gt;{{Citation|year=1988|title=Analysis of the effect of historical cultural changes relative to the development of affordability excursions to existing parametric cost models.|publication-place=Huntsville,  AL|publisher=Cost Analysis Office, U.S.  Army Strategic Defense Command|pages=46-47|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA200744|accessdate=2012-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparing its workings  to the techniques of [[mass production]] and [[scientific management]] made famous by [[Henry Ford]] and [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] in the United States in the early 20th century, the economist [[Eric Roll]] wrote "Neither Taylor, Ford nor any other modern experts devised anything in the way of plan that cannot be discovered at Soho before 1805".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Agarwal|first=R.D.|year=1983|title=Organization and Management|publication-place=New York|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|page=22|isbn=0074515063|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kwKzRGO3fCsC&amp;pg=PA22|accessdate=2012-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The factory was built on the edge of the [[BCN Main Line|Birmingham Canal]] on land bought in 1795. The following year the foundry was open.

The Soho Foundry was planned with a degree of sophistication unprecedented for a factory of its time.&lt;ref name="USArmy" /&gt; Its products were produced out of standardised [[interchangeable parts]], reducing the need to supervise work as it was executed, simplifying stock control and enabling more efficient repair of faults for customers.&lt;ref name="Wren"&gt;{{citation|last=Wren|first=Daniel A.|author-link=Daniel A. Wren|year=1994|title=The Evolution of Management Thought|edition=4th|series=Wiley Series in Management|publication-place=|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|pages=47-48|isbn=047159752X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production processes were broken down into small tasks, enabling an extremely high degree of [[division of labour|specialisation among workers]]&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{citation|last=Martin|first=John|year=2005|title=Organizational Behaviour And Management|publication-place=|publisher=Cengage Learning EMEA|page=52|isbn=1861529481|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BUDMDCAuRIoC&amp;pg=PA52|accessdate=2012-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; – one document from 1801, for example, describes how a team of four specific workers was "to be constantly employed in fitting nozzles".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Roll|first=Eric|year=1968|title=An Early Experiment in Industrial Organization: History of the Firm of Boulton and Watt 1775-1805|publication-place=London|publisher=Routledge|page=181|isbn=0714613576|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DDU_t8gRKR0C&amp;pg=PA181|accessdate=2012-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tasks took place in a series of workshops spatially located along the [[assembly line|flow of production]], minimising the expense and time-wastage of the movement of materials through the works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Porter|first=Roy|year=2001|title=English Society in the Eighteenth Century|edition=|series=The Penguin Social History of Britain|publication-place=Harmondsworth|publisher=Penguin|page=475|isbn=0140138196|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sJ0QXIEwSVEC&amp;pg=PT475|accessdate=2012-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The accounting procedures of the foundry bore a striking similarity to modern processes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|1995|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; with each of the three main operating departments - the [[foundry|Foundry Department]] which made [[cast iron]] parts, the [[Forge|Smithy Department]] which made [[wrought iron]] parts, and the [[Machinist|Fitting Department]] which machined the parts and assembled them together - being operated as separate [[profit centre]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|1995|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soho Foundry was also innovative in the field of [[personnel management]], setting up [[executive development]] programmes, [[Sick leave|sickness benefit]] schemes and [[welfare]] programmes.&lt;ref name="Nanda"&gt;{{Citation|last=Nanda|first=Jayanta K.|year=2006|title=Management Thought|publication-place=New Delhi|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|pages=40-41|isbn=8176256234|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VtjTyhi7g4QC&amp;pg=PA40|accessdate=2012-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1912, the manager of the company William Edward Hipkins, died at the sinking of Titanic while he was travelling as a first class passenger. He was 55 and his body was not recovered. 
===Later development===

[[File:Thinktank Birmingham - James Watt &amp; Co.jpg|thumb| Trade advertisement from the 'James Watt &amp; Co.' era]]

By 1840 [[James Watt Jr.]] owned the factory after the death of the founding Boulton and Watt. He died in 1848 and his place was taken by H. W. Blake and the name changed from ''Soho Foundry'' to ''James Watt &amp; Co.''. 

In 1857 the [[Propeller#Ship and submarine screw propellers|screw]] engines for the steamship ''[[SS Great Eastern]]'' were built at the foundry. In 1860 a new mint was started at the Foundry, the Manufactory having closed in April 1850 by Matthew's grandson, [[Matthew Piers Watt Boulton]].

In 1861 tests were performed at the Soho Foundry for the [[London Pneumatic Despatch Company]].

In 1895 [[W &amp; T Avery Ltd.]] acquired the Foundry as a going concern.

==Today==
It is now the home of [[Avery Weigh-Tronix]] and [[Avery Berkel]], who make [[weighing scale]]s. The site includes [[William Murdoch]]'s cottage and overlooks [[Black Patch Park]].

There was a small [[museum]] there, open only by appointment, but is now closed.

The [[grade II listed]] ''Pooley'' gates, of cast iron, are marked with "a Liver bird above ropework draped with cloth, flanked by nautical symbols including oars, flags and bugles, ships' wheels and intersecting dolphins". A plaque reads: "These gates were cast by [[Henry Pooley &amp; Son Ltd|Henry Pooley and Son]] about 1840 for the Sailors' Home, Liverpool. The Avery and Pooley Foundries were amalgamated in 1931". There was an active campaign to return these gates to Liverpool,&lt;ref name="SLHS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dumbleton-williams.fsnet.co.uk/NEWSPAGE.html|title=Smethwick Local History Society website}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in the approval by Sandwell Council in March 2011 of an application to return them. After restoration the gates were returned to Liverpool on 8 August 2011 and were re-erected under the name "The Sailors Home Gateway" in the pedestrian section of Paradise Street in Liverpool One, close to the original site of the Sailors' Home.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-14576433 BBC News - return of gates]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liverpoolconfidential.co.uk/Culture/Architecture/Pooley-gates-return-to-Pool LiverpoolConfidential.com - return of gates] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222225917/http://www.liverpoolconfidential.co.uk/Culture/Architecture/Pooley-gates-return-to-Pool |date=2012-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building is a Grade II* [[listed building]]. The gates and adjacent canal bridge are Grade II listed.

The oldest working steam engine, built here, is the [[Smethwick Engine]] built to recover water used in the nearby [[lock (water transport)|canal locks]] at Smethwick Summit, and now in [[Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5020">The [[Texas Instruments]] '''TMS6100''' is a 1 or 4-bit [[Serial communications|serial]] mask(factory)-programmed [[read-only memory]] [[integrated circuit|IC]].&lt;ref name=datasheet&gt;http://www.ti99.com/exelvision/website/telechargement/tms6100-80-data-manual.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It is a companion chip to the [[TMS5100]], [[CD2802]], [[TMS5110]], (rarely) [[TMS5200]], and (rarely) [[TMS5220]] [[speech synthesizer]] ICs, and was mask-programmed with [[Linear predictive coding|LPC]] data required for a specific product. It holds 128Kib (16KiB) of data, and is mask-programmed with a start address for said data on a 16KiB boundary. It is also mask-programmable whether the /CE line needs to be high or low to activate, and also what the two (or four) 'internal' CE bits need to be set to activate, effectively making the total addressable area 18 bits. Finally, it is mask-programmable whether the bits are read out 1-bit serially or 4 at a time.

==TMS6125==
The ''TMS6125'' is a smaller, 32Kib (4KiB) version of effectively the same chip, with some minor changes to the 'address load' command format to reflect its smaller size.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

[[Texas Instruments]] calls both of these serial roms (TMS6100 and TMS6125) "VSM"s (Voice Synthesis Memory) on their datasheets and literature, and they will be referred to as such for the rest of this article.&lt;ref name=datasheet /&gt;

Both VSMs use 'local addressing', meaning the chip keeps track of its own address pointer once loaded. Hence every bit in the chip can be sequentially read out, even though internally the chip stores data in 8-bit bytes.

(For the following section, CE stands for "Chip Enable" and is used as a way to enable one specific VSM)

==Commands==
The VSM has supports 4 basic commands, based on two input pins called 'M0' and 'M1':&lt;ref name=datasheet /&gt;
* no operation/idle: this command tells the chip to 'do nothing' or 'continue doing what was being done before'.
* load address: this command parallel-loads 4 bits from the data bus. to fully load an address, this command must be executed 5 times in sequence, for a load of a 20 bit block (LSB-first 14 bit address, 4 CE bits, and two unused bits, effectively 18 address bits) into the internal address pointer. On the TMS6125 the command must be executed 4 times instead, and only a 16 bit block is loaded (12 address bits, two unused bits, and two CE bits).
* read bit: this reads a single bit at the loaded address, and advances the 3 bit 'bit pointer' to point to the next bit within the address; if the bit pointer overflows, the address pointer is incremented. If the address pointed to on a specific chip is outside of the mask-programmed range of said VSM, the VSM will leave the data bus 'open' in a high impedance state, so another chip wired in parallel (which has the address within its mask-programmed range) can supply the data instead. A rarely used mask option made the read bit command read 4 bits at once; this was used on a few non-speech products, and could not be used with the TI-manufactured LPC speech ICs.
* read and branch: this reads 16 bits of data from the current address(and bit?) pointed to, and loads the value read into the address pointer, leaving the high bits of the address pointer alone. (This was intended for making VSMs with multiple languages available, where the initial load addresses could remain static, so for example they would not require changes to code in a microcontroller, and only the values pointed to in the VSM needed changing. In practice it doesn't seem to have ever been used, as it doesn't work when more than one VSM chip shares a bus, which is what was done in most cases.)

==Part Numbering==
When used on [[Texas Instruments]]' Consumer Division products, the VSMs are always marked CDxxxxx where xxxxx is a 4 or 5 digit mask rom ID code, typically 23xx or 62xxx. The chips are SOMETIMES (typically after 1981) also marked TMC0350, as this seems to be the 'internal use class' of the chip. The very first VSMs (used in the [[Speak &amp; Spell (toy)|Speak and Spell]], 1978 version) were marked TMC0351 and TMC0352 and did not have a CD number. These two SEEM to have been 'grandfathered in' as CD2300 and CD2301, as all later VSMs start at CD2302 (used in the 'Vowel Power' [[Speak &amp; Spell (toy)|Speak and Spell]] expansion cartridge). It should also be noted that CD22xx, CD25xx and CD28xx numbers are used for chips that are NOT VSMs.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

When used on [[Texas Instruments]]' non-consumer division products (such as generic voice chips for other computers/measurement devices which were still TI-branded) the chips are labeled VMxxxxx.

When used on 3rd party products, the chips are marked CMxxxxx instead. The numbering scheme for the xxxxx part seems to be common between both CDxxxxx and CMxxxxx chips (but NOT VMxxxxx chips), so no chip of either series will have a common xxxxx number.

The '''Taurus World Stunt Awards''' is a yearly [[award]] ceremony held midyear that honors [[stunt performer]]s in movies. It is held each year in [[Los Angeles]]. The first awards were given out in 2001. However the deciding committee has been around since the year 2000. The awards were created by [[Dietrich Mateschitz]], the founder of Red Bull.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16585">'''Terahertz spectroscopy''' detects and controls properties of matter with [[electromagnetic fields]] that are in the frequency range between a few hundred [[gigahertz]] and several [[Terahertz (unit)|terahertz]] (abbreviated as THz). In [[many-body]] systems, several of the relevant states have an energy difference that matches with the energy of a THz [[photon]]. Therefore, THz spectroscopy provides a particularly powerful method in resolving and controlling individual transitions between different many-body states. By doing this, one gains new insights about many-body [[quantum kinetics]] and how that can be utilized in developing new technologies that are optimized up to the elementary quantum level.

Different electronic excitations within semiconductors are already widely used in [[lasers]], electronic components, [[computer]]s, to mention a few. At the same time, they constitute an interesting many-body system whose quantum properties can be modified, e.g., via a [[nanostructure]] design. Consequently, THz spectroscopy on semiconductors is relevant in revealing both new technological potentials of nanostructures as well as in exploring the fundamental properties of many-body systems in a controlled fashion.

==Background==

There are a great variety of techniques to generate [[THz radiation]] and to detect THz fields. One can, e.g., use an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]], a [[quantum cascade laser|quantum-cascade laser]], a [[free-electron laser]], or [[optical rectification]] to produce well-defined THz sources. The resulting THz field can be characterized via its electric field ''E''&lt;sub&gt;THz&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''). Present-day experiments can already output ''E''&lt;sub&gt;THz&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') that has a peak value in the range of MV/cm (megavolts per centimeter).&lt;ref name="JungingerSell2010"&gt;Junginger, F.; Sell, A.; Schubert, O.; Mayer, B.; Brida, D.; Marangoni, M.; Cerullo, G.; Leitenstorfer, A. et al. (2010). "Single-cycle multiterahertz transients with peak fields above 10 MV/cm". ''Optics Letters'' '''35''' (15): 2645. doi:[https://dx.doi.org/10.1364/OL.35.002645 10.1364/OL.35.002645]&lt;/ref&gt; To estimate how strong such fields are, one can compute the level of energy change such fields induce to an [[electron]] over microscopic distance of one nanometer (nm), i.e., ''L'' = 1&amp;nbsp;nm. One simply multiplies the peak ''E''&lt;sub&gt;THz&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') with [[elementary charge]] ''e'' and ''L'' to obtain ''e'' ''E''&lt;sub&gt;THz&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') ''L'' = 100 meV. In other words, such fields have a major effect on electronic systems because the mere field strength of ''E''&lt;sub&gt;THz&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') can induce electronic transitions over [[microscopic scale]]s. One possibility is to use such THz fields to study [[Bloch oscillations]]&lt;ref name="FeldmannLeo1992"&gt;Feldmann, J.; Leo, K.; Shah, J.; Miller, D.; Cunningham, J.; Meier, T.; von Plessen, G.; Schulze, A.; Thomas, P.; Schmitt-Rink, S. (1992). "Optical investigation of Bloch oscillations in a semiconductor superlattice". ''Physical Review B'' '''46''' (11): 7252–7255. doi:[https://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.46.7252 10.1103/PhysRevB.46.7252]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ben DahanPeik1996"&gt;Ben Dahan, Maxime; Peik, Ekkehard; Reichel, Jakob; Castin, Yvan; Salomon, Christophe (1996).

The THz sources can be also extremely short,&lt;ref name="JepsenCooke2011"&gt;Jepsen, P.U.; Cooke, D.G.; Koch, M. (2011). "Terahertz spectroscopy and imaging - Modern techniques and applications". ''Laser &amp; Photonics Reviews'' '''5''' (1): 124–166. doi:[https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lpor.201000011 10.1002/lpor.201000011]&lt;/ref&gt; down to single cycle of THz field's oscillation. For one THz, that means duration in the range of one picosecond (ps). Consequently, one can use THz fields to monitor and control ultrafast processes in semiconductors or to produce ultrafast switching in semiconductor components. Obviously, the combination of ultrafast duration and strong peak ''E''&lt;sub&gt;THz&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') provides vast new possibilities to systematic studies in semiconductors.

Besides the strength and duration of ''E''&lt;sub&gt;THz&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''), the THz field's photon energy plays a vital role in semiconductor investigations because it can be made resonant with several intriguing many-body transitions. For example, electrons in [[conduction band]] and [[electron hole|holes]], i.e., electronic vacancies, in [[valence band]] attract each other via the [[Coulomb interaction]]. Under suitable conditions, electrons and holes can be bound to [[exciton]]s that are hydrogen-like states of matter. At the same time, the exciton [[binding energy]] is few to hundreds of meV that can be matched energetically with a THz photon. Therefore, the presence of excitons can be uniquely detected&lt;ref name="TimuskNavarro1978"&gt;Timusk, T.; Navarro, H.; Lipari, N.O.; Altarelli, M. (1978).

==Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy==

{{Main|Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy}}

In optical spectroscopy, the detectors typically measure the intensity of the light field rather than the electric field because there are no detectors that can directly measure electromagnetic fields in the optical range. However, there are multiple techniques, such as antennas and  [[Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy#Electro-optical sampling|electro-optical sampling]], that can be applied to measure the time evolution of ''E''&lt;sub&gt;THz&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') directly. For example, one can propagate a THz pulse through a semiconductor sample and measure the transmitted and reflected fields as function of time. Therefore, one collects information of semiconductor excitation dynamics completely in time domain, which is the general principle of the [[terahertz time-domain spectroscopy]].

By using short THz pulses,&lt;ref name="JepsenCooke2011" /&gt;  a great variety of physical phenomena have already been studied. For unexcited, [[intrinsic semiconductor]]s one can determine the [[Permittivity#Complex permittivity|complex permittivity]] or THz-absorption coefficient and refractive index, respectively.&lt;ref name="GrischkowskyKeiding1990"&gt;Grischkowsky, D.; Keiding, Søren; Exter, Martin van; Fattinger, Ch. (1990). "Far-infrared time-domain spectroscopy with terahertz beams of dielectrics and semiconductors". ''Journal of the Optical Society of America B'' '''7''' (10): 2006. doi:[https://dx.doi.org/10.1364/JOSAB.7.002006 10.1364/JOSAB.7.002006]&lt;/ref&gt; The frequency of transversal-optical [[phonon]]s, to which THz photons can couple, lies for most semiconductors at several THz.&lt;ref name="HanZhang1998"&gt;Han, P. Y.; Zhang, X.-C. (1998). "Coherent, broadband midinfrared terahertz beam sensors". ''Applied Physics Letters'' '''73''' (21): 3049. doi:[https://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.122668 10.1063/1.122668]&lt;/ref&gt; Free carriers in [[Doping (semiconductor)|doped semiconductors]] or optically excited semiconductors lead to a considerable absorption of THz photons.&lt;ref name="ZhangAzad2003"&gt;Zhang, W.; Azad, Abul K.; Grischkowsky, D. (2003). "Terahertz studies of carrier dynamics and dielectric response of n-type, freestanding epitaxial GaN". ''Applied Physics Letters'' '''82''' (17): 2841. doi:[https://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.1569988 10.1063/1.1569988]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terahertz-induced plasma and exciton transitions==

The THz fields can be applied to accelerate electrons out of their equilibrium. If this is done fast enough, one can measure the elementary processes, such as how fast the [[Electric-field screening|screening]] of the Coulomb interaction is built up. This was experimentally explored in Ref.&lt;ref name="HuberTauser2001"&gt;Huber, R.; Tauser, F.; Brodschelm, A.; Bichler, M.; Abstreiter, G.; Leitenstorfer, A. (2001). ''Nature'' '''414''' (6861): 286–289. doi:[https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/35104522 10.1038/35104522]&lt;/ref&gt; where it was shown that screening is complete within tens of femtoseconds in semiconductors. These insights are very important to understand how electronic plasma behaves in [[solid]]s.

The Coulomb interaction can also pair electrons and holes into excitons, as discussed above. Due to their analog to the [[hydrogen atom]], excitons have  [[bound state]]s that can be uniquely identified by the usual [[quantum number]]s 1''s'', 2''s'', 2''p'', and so on. In particular, 1''s''-to-2''p'' transition is dipole allowed and can be directly generated by ''E''&lt;sub&gt;THz&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') if the photon energy matches the transition energy. In [[gallium arsenide]]-type systems, this transition energy is roughly 4 meV that corresponds to 1 THz photons. At resonance, the dipole ''d''&lt;sub&gt;1''s'',2''p''&lt;/sub&gt; defines the Rabi energy Ω&lt;sub&gt;Rabi&lt;/sub&gt; = ''d''&lt;sub&gt;1''s'',2''p''&lt;/sub&gt; ''E''&lt;sub&gt;THz&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') that determines the time scale at which the 1''s''-to-2''p'' transition proceeds.

For example, one can excite the excitonic transition with an additional optical pulse which is synchronized with the THz pulse. This technique is called transient THz spectroscopy.&lt;ref name="JepsenCooke2011" /&gt; Using this technique one can follow the formation dynamics of excitons&lt;ref name="KaindlCarnahan2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KiraHoyer2004" /&gt; or observe THz gain arising from intraexcitonic transitions.&lt;ref name="KiraKoch2004"&gt;Kira, M.; Koch, S. (2004). "Exciton-Population Inversion and Terahertz Gain in Semiconductors Excited to Resonance". ''Physical Review Letters'' '''93''' (7). doi:[https://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.93.076402 10.1103/PhysRevLett.93.076402]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HuberSchmid2006"&gt;Huber, Rupert; Schmid, Ben; Shen, Y.; Chemla, Daniel; Kaindl, Robert (2006). "Stimulated Terahertz Emission from Intraexcitonic Transitions in Cu2O". ''Physical Review Letters'' '''96''' (1). doi:[https://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.96.017402 10.1103/PhysRevLett.96.017402]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since a THz pulse can be intense and short, e.g., single-cycle, it is experimentally possible to realize situations where duration of the pulse, time scale related to Rabi- as well as the THz photon energy ħω are degenerate. In this situation, one enters the realm of [[extreme nonlinear optics]]&lt;ref name="Wegener2005"&gt;Wegener, M. (2005). M. ''Extreme Nonlinear Optics: An Introduction''. Springer. {{ISBN|978-3642060908}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the usual approximations, such as the [[Rotating wave approximation|rotating-wave approximation]] (abbreviated as RWA) or the conditions for complete state transfer, break down. As a result, the [[Rabi oscillation]]s become strongly distorted by the non-RWA contributions, the [[multiphoton absorption]] or emission processes, and the dynamic [[Franz–Keldysh effect]], as measured in Refs.&lt;ref name="DanielsonLee2007"&gt;Danielson, J.; Lee, Yun-Shik; Prineas, J.; Steiner, J.; Kira, M.; Koch, S. (2007). "Interaction of Strong Single-Cycle Terahertz Pulses with Semiconductor Quantum Wells". ''Physical Review Letters'' '''99''' (23). doi:[https://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.99.237401 10.1103/PhysRevLett.99.237401]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LeinßKampfrath2008"&gt;Leinß, S.; Kampfrath, T.; v.Volkmann, K.; Wolf, M.; Steiner, J.; Kira, M.; Koch, S.; Leitenstorfer, A. et al. (2008). "Terahertz Coherent Control of Optically Dark Paraexcitons in Cu2O". ''Physical Review Letters'' '''101''' (24). doi:[https://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.246401 10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.246401]&lt;/ref&gt;

By using a free-electron laser, one can generate longer THz pulses that are more suitable for detecting the Rabi oscillations directly.  This technique could indeed demonstrate the Rabi oscillations, or actually the related [[Autler–Townes splitting]], in experiments.&lt;ref name="WagnerSchneider2010"&gt;Wagner, Martin; Schneider, Harald; Stehr, Dominik; Winnerl, Stephan; Andrews, Aaron M.; Schartner, Stephan; Strasser, Gottfried; Helm, Manfred (2010). "Observation of the Intra-exciton Autler-Townes Effect in GaAs/AlGaAs Semiconductor Quantum Wells". ''Physical Review Letters'' '''105''' (16). doi:[https://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.105.167401 10.1103/PhysRevLett.105.167401]&lt;/ref&gt; The Rabi splitting has also been measured with a short THz pulse&lt;ref name="SteinerKira2008"&gt;Steiner, J.; Kira, M.; Koch, S. (2008). "Optical nonlinearities and Rabi flopping of an exciton population in a semiconductor interacting with strong terahertz fields". ''Physical Review B'' '''77''' (16). doi:[https://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.77.165308 10.1103/PhysRevB.77.165308]&lt;/ref&gt; and also the onset to multi-THz-photon ionization has been detected,&lt;ref name="EwersKöster2012"&gt;Ewers, B.; Köster, N. S.; Woscholski, R.; Koch, M.; Chatterjee, S.; Khitrova, G.; Gibbs, H. M.; Klettke, A. C.; Kira, M.; Koch, S. W. (2012). "Ionization of coherent excitons by strong terahertz fields".

Recently, it has also been shown that the Coulomb interaction causes nominally dipole-forbidden intra-excitonic transitions to become partially allowed.&lt;ref name="RiceKono2013"&gt;Rice, W. D.; Kono, J.; Zybell, S.; Winnerl, S.; Bhattacharyya, J.; Schneider, H.; Helm, M.; Ewers, B.; Chernikov, A.; Koch, M.; Chatterjee, S.; Khitrova, G.; Gibbs, H. M.; Schneebeli, L.; Breddermann, B.; Kira, M.; Koch, S. W. (2013). "Observation of Forbidden Exciton Transitions Mediated by Coulomb Interactions in Photoexcited Semiconductor Quantum Wells".

==Theory of terahertz transitions==

Terahertz transitions in solids can be systematically approached by generalizing the [[semiconductor Bloch equations]]&lt;ref name="KiraKoch2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kira|first1=M.|last2=Koch|first2=S.W.|title=Many-body correlations and excitonic effects in semiconductor spectroscopy|journal=Progress in Quantum Electronics|volume=30|issue=5|date=2006|pages=155–296|issn=0079-6727|doi=10.1016/j.pquantelec.2006.12.002|bibcode = 2006PQE....30..155K }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the related many-body correlation dynamics. At this level, one realizes the THz field are directly absorbed by [[cluster-expansion approach|two-particle correlations]] that modify the quantum kinetics of electron and hole distributions. Therefore, a systematic THz analysis must include the quantum kinetics of many-body correlations, that can be treated systematically, e.g., with the [[cluster-expansion approach]]. At this level, one can explain and predict a wide range of effects with the same theory, ranging from [[Drude model|Drude]]-like response&lt;ref name="ZhangAzad2003" /&gt; of plasma to extreme nonlinear effects of excitons.

A '''test light''', '''test lamp''', '''voltage tester''', or '''mains tester''' is a piece of [[electronic test equipment]] used to determine the presence of electricity in a piece of equipment under test. A test light is simpler and less costly than a measuring instrument such as a [[multimeter]], and often suffices for checking for the presence of voltage on a conductor. Properly designed test lights include features to protect the user from accidental electric shock. Non-contact test lights can detect voltage on insulated conductors. 

==Two-contact test lights ==
[[File:Spanningszoeker.jpg|thumb|right| A voltage tester with three lamps to give an approximate indication of voltage magnitude]]
The test light is an electric lamp connected with one or two [[Electrical insulation|insulated]] [[wire]] leads.&lt;ref name=Suummers87&gt;Terrel Croft, Wilford Summers ''American Electricians' Handbook, Eleventh Edition'', McGraw Hill, 1987 {{ISBN|0-07-013932-6}} pages 1-56 through 1-57&lt;/ref&gt; Often, it takes the form of a [[screwdriver]] with the lamp connected between the tip of the screwdriver and a single lead that projects out the back of the screwdriver. By connecting the flying lead to an earth (ground) reference and touching the screwdriver tip to various points in the circuit, the presence or absence of voltage at each point can be determined, allowing simple faults to be detected and traced to their root cause. For higher voltages, a '''statiscope''' consisting of a neon [[Gas-filled tube|glow tube]] mounted on a long insulating handle can be used to detect AC voltages of 2000 volts or more.

For low voltage work (for example, in [[automobile]]s), the lamp used is usually a small, low-voltage [[incandescent light bulb]]. These lamps usually are designed to operate on approximately 12 V; application of an automotive test lamp on mains voltage will destroy the lamp and may cause a short-circuit fault in the tester.

For [[Mains electricity|line voltage]] (mains) work, the lamp is usually a small [[neon lamp]] connected in series with an appropriate [[Ballast (electrical)|ballast]] resistor. These lamps often can operate across a wide range of voltages from 90V up to several hundred volts. In some cases, several separate lamps are used with resistive [[voltage divider]]s arranged to allow additional lamps to strike as the applied voltage rises higher.  The lamps are  mounted in order from lowest voltage to highest, this minimal [[bar graph]] providing a crude indication of voltage.

Incandescent bulbs may also be used in some electronic equipment repair, and a trained technician can usually tell the approximate voltage by using the brightness as a crude indicator.

==Safety==
&lt;!-- Does anyone have a free photo of a GS 38 compliant test light, possibly with proving unit? --&gt;

A hand-held test lamp necessarily puts the user in proximity to live circuits. Accidental contact with live wiring can result in a [[short circuit]] or [[electric shock]].  Inexpensive or home-made test lamps may not include sufficient protection against high-energy faults.  It is customary to connect a test lamp to a known live circuit both before and after testing an unknown circuit, to check for failure of the test lamp itself.

In the [[UK]], guidelines established by the [[Health and Safety Executive]] (HSE) provide recommendations for the construction and use of test lamps.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/priced/gs38.pdf Guide GS 38  - PDF edition&lt;/ref&gt; Probes must be well-insulated, with minimal exposure of live terminals, with finger guards to prevent accidental contact, and must not expose live wires if the test lamp glass bulb is broken. To limit the energy delivered in case of a short-circuit, test lights must have a current-limiting [[Fuse (electrical)|fuse]] or current-limiting resistor and fuse.  The HSE guidelines also recommend procedures to validate operation of the test light.  When a known live circuit is not available, a separate proving unit that provides a known test voltage and sufficient power to illuminate the lamp is used to confirm operation of the lamp before and after testing a circuit.

Since energy to operate the test lamp is drawn from the circuit under test, some high-impedance leakage voltages may not be detectable using this type of non-amplified test equipment.

==One-contact neon test lights ==
[[File:Voltage test light active.jpg|thumb|right|Neon-lamp type tester, which has no amplifier; this type requires a direct metallic contact to the circuit to be tested.]]
[[File:LUX-Neon test light.JPG|thumb|left|upright|alt=Screwdriver tester inserted in one pin of a European style electrical outlet, with an orange glow visible in the lamp.|Neon screwdriver test light in use. Current flows through a high ohm resistor and the lamp and the distributed capacitance and resistance of the user's body.]]

A low-cost type of test lamp only contacts one side of the circuit under test, and relies on stray capacitance and current passing through the user's body to complete the circuit.  The device may have the form of a screwdriver. The tip of the tester is touched to the conductor being tested (for instance, it can be used on a wire in a switch, or inserted into a hole of an [[electric socket]]).  A [[neon lamp]] takes very little current to light, and thus can use the user's [[body capacitance]] to earth ground to complete the circuit.

Screwdriver-type test lamps are very inexpensive, but cannot meet the construction requirements of UK GS 38. If the shaft is exposed, a shock hazard to the user exists, and the internal construction of the tester provides no protection against short-circuit faults.  Failure of the resistor and lamp series network can put the user in direct metallic contact with the circuit under test. For example, water trapped inside the screwdriver may allow enough leakage current to shock the user.  Even if an internal short circuit does not electrocute the user, the resulting electric shock may result in a fall or other injury. The lamp provides no indication below the strike voltage of the neon lamp, and so cannot detect certain hazardous leakage conditions. Since it relies on capacitance to complete the circuit, direct-current potential cannot be reliably indicated.  If the user of the screwdriver is isolated from ground and [[Capacitive coupling|capacitively coupled]] to other nearby live wires, a false negative may occur when testing a live circuit, and a false positive when testing a dead circuit. False negatives may also occur in brightly lit areas which make the neon glow hard to see.

==Non-contact voltage detectors==
[[File:Benning_Tritest.webm|thumb|alt=The tip of this non-contact pen-shaped tester lights up near live wires|Non-contact voltage tester detects the changing electric field around live wires]]

Amplified electronic testers (informally called '''electrical tester pens''', '''test pens''', or '''voltage detectors''') rely on capacitive current only, and essentially detect the changing electric field around AC energized objects.  This means that no direct metallic contact with the circuit is required.  The user must touch the top of the handle to provide a [[ground (electricity)|ground]] reference (through [[Parasitic capacitance|stray capacitance]] to ground), at which point the indicator [[light emitting diode|LED]] will light up or a speaker will buzz, if the conductor being tested is live. Additional energy to light the lamp and power the amplifier is supplied by a small internal battery, and does not flow through the user's body.

When the device is placed near a live conductor, a [[voltage divider#Capacitive divider|capacitive voltage divider]] is established, comprising the parasitic capacitance between the conductor and the sensor, and between the sensor to ground (through the user's body).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecmweb.com/content/what-do-you-know-about-capacitive-voltage-sensors "What Do You Know About Capacitive Voltage Sensors?"], Fluke Corp, Retrieved 6 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt; When the tester detects current flowing through this divider, it indicates the presence of voltage.

Some amplified testers will give a stronger indication (brighter light or louder buzz) to gauge relative strength of the detected field, thus giving some clues about the location of an energized object.  Other testers give only a simple on/off indication of a detected electric field.  Professional-grade testers will also have a feature to reassure the user that the battery and lamp are working.

Voltage detector pens are made for either line-voltage or lower-voltage (around 50 volt) ranges. A tester intended for mains-voltage detection may not provide any indication on lower-voltage control circuits such as those used for doorbells or [[HVAC]] control.

Unlike [[Current clamp|tong ammeters]] which sense changing magnetic fields, these detectors can be used even if no current is flowing through the wire in question, because they sense the alternating electric field radiating from the AC voltage on the conductor.

A non-contact tester which senses electric fields cannot detect voltage inside shielded or armored cables (a fundamental limitation due to the [[Faraday cage]] effect).  Another limitation is that DC voltage cannot be detected by this method, since DC current does not pass through capacitors (in the [[steady state (electronics)|steady state]]), so the tester is not activated.

These types of testers can be used on [[series and parallel circuits|series-connected]] strings of mini [[Christmas lights]] to detect which bulb has failed and broken the circuit, causing the set (or a section of it) not to light.  By pointing the end of the detector at the tip of each bulb, it can be determined whether it is still connected at least on one side.  The first bulb which does not register is likely the one just past the problem bulb.  (Burnt-out bulbs will still show as good, if there is a bypass [[shunt (electrical)|shunt]] which completes the circuit.)  Flipping the set's plug over and reinserting it in the outlet will cause the opposite end of the set or circuit to register instead.

==Receptacle tester==
{{main|Receptacle tester}}
[[File:USA_receptacle_tester.jpg|thumb|North American grounded receptacle tester]]
A [[receptacle tester]] (outlet tester or socket tester) plugs into an outlet, and can detect some types of wiring errors. The particular error in wiring is shown by various combinations of three lights.  Detectable errors include reversed hot/neutral, missing [[electrical ground]] or neutral, and others. However, leakage current through surge protective [[metal oxide varistor]]s connected between neutral and ground of a [[power strip]] can give a false indication that a ground connection exists.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Cook ''Standard Check for Ungrounded Outlets Using Neon Tester Can Yield False Results'', ''Electrical Line'',(Pacific Media Publishing 2012), {{ISSN|1204-8011}} Vol. 18 No. 2 March/April 2012 page 89&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continuity tester lights==
A lamp and battery can be used to test for contact closure or wire continuity. Care must be taken to ensure that all circuits are completely de-energized before use of a [[continuity tester]] lamp, or the lamp will be destroyed. Sometimes a [[flashlight]] (torch) is field-modified or factory-manufactured with test leads, to allow the flashlight to be used as a continuity tester.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11941">[[File:Petit train la rhune.jpg|thumb|Train using a multiphase electrification system on the [[Petit train de la Rhune]], France]]
'''Three-phase AC railway electrification''' was used in Italy, Switzerland and the United States in the early twentieth century. Italy was the major user, from 1901 until 1976, although lines through two tunnels also used the system; the [[Simplon Tunnel]] between Switzerland and Italy from 1906 to 1930 (but not connected to the Italian system), and the [[Cascade Tunnel]] of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]] in the United States from 1909 to 1939. The first standard gauge line was in Switzerland, from Burgdorf to Thun ({{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=or}}), since 1899.{{sfnp|Middleton|1974|p=156}} {{sfnp|Meares|Neale|1933|p=630-631|ps=, para 919}} 

==Advantages==
The system provides regenerative braking with the power fed back to the system, so is particularly suitable for mountain railways (provided the grid or another locomotive on the line can accept the power). The locomotives use three-phase induction motors. Lacking brushes and commutators, they require less maintenance. The early Italian and Swiss systems used a low frequency (16⅔&amp;nbsp;Hz), and a relatively low voltage (3,000 or 3,600 volts) compared with later AC systems.

==Disadvantages==
The overhead wiring, generally having two separate overhead lines and the rail for the third phase, was more complicated, and the low-frequency used required a separate generation or conversion and distribution system. Train speed was restricted to one to four speeds, with two or four speeds obtained by pole-changing or cascade operation or both. 

== Historical systems ==
The following is a list of the railways that have used this method of electrification in the past:{{sfnp|Burch|1923|p=133}}

* The [[Cascade Tunnel]] of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]].{{sfnp|Burch|1923|p=349}}
* The [[Turin–Genoa railway#Electrification|Giovi Railway]] between [[Genoa]] and [[Pontedecimo]] in Italy.{{sfnp|Burch|1923|p=342}}
* The Santa Fe - Gergal line in Spain.{{sfnp|Burch|1923|p=133}}
* The [[Simplon Tunnel]] between Switzerland and Italy.{{sfnp|Burch|1923|p=346}}
* The [[Ferrovia della Valtellina]] in Italy.{{sfnp|Burch|1923|p=339}}

==Current systems==
The system is only used today{{When|date=November 2018}} for four rack (mountain) railways, where the overhead wiring is less complicated and restrictions on the speeds available less important. New motive power avoids speed restrictions, as it is built with solid-state converters. The four systems are as follows:

* The [[Corcovado Rack Railway]] in [[Rio de Janeiro, Brazil|Rio de Janeiro]] Brazil.
* The [[Gornergratbahn]] in Switzerland. 
* The [[Jungfraubahn]] in Switzerland.
* The [[Petit train de la Rhune]] in France, still using the original locomotives of 1912

They are nowadays industrial rather than low frequency (50&amp;nbsp;Hz, or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz (Brazil)), using between 725 and 3,000 volts.

==Converter systems==
This category does not cover railways with a single-phase (or DC) supply which is converted to three-phase on the locomotive or power car, ''e.g.'', most railway equipment from the 1990s and earlier using solid-state converters. The Kando system of the 1930s developed by [[Kálmán Kandó]] at the [[Ganz Works]], and used in Hungary and Italy, used [[rotary phase converter]]s on the locomotive to convert the single-phase supply to three phases, as did the Phase-splitting system on the [[Norfolk and Western Railroad]] in the United States.

== Locomotives ==
[[File:E551-001pietrarsa1999-04-08.jpg|thumb|right|[[FS Class E.550]] (Italy 1906-65)]]
[[File:Mus Scienza Tecnica loco E.330.JPG|thumb|right|[[FS Class E330]] (Italy 1914-63). Note the long bow collectors, with their pickup points at the far ends of the locomotive.]]
Usually, the locomotives had one, two, or four motors on the body chassis (not on the bogies), and did not require gearing. The [[induction motor]]s are designed to run at a particular synchronous speed, and when they run above the synchronous speed downhill, power is fed back to the system. Pole changing and cascade (concatenation) working was used to allow two or four different speeds, and resistances (often [[liquid rheostat]]s) were required for starting. In Italy freight locomotives used plain cascade with two speeds, {{convert|25|and|50|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}; while express locomotives used cascade combined with pole-changing, giving four speeds, 37, 50, 75 and 100&amp;nbsp;km/h (23, 31, 46 and 62&amp;nbsp;mph).{{sfnp|Meares|Neale|1933|p=630-631|ps=, para 919}}  With the use of 3,000 or 3,600 volts at 16⅔ (16.7) Hz, the supply could be fed directly to the motor without an onboard transformer.

Generally, the motor(s) fed a single axle, with other wheels linked by connecting rods, as the induction motor is sensitive to speed variations and with non-linked motors on several axles the motors on worn wheels would do little or even no work as they would rotate faster.{{sfnp|Starr|1953|p=347}} This motor characteristic led to a mishap in the Cascade Tunnel to a GN east-bound freight train with four electric locomotives, two on the head and two pushing. The two pushers suddenly lost power and the train gradually slowed to a stop, but the lead unit engineer was unaware that his train had stopped, and held the controller on the power position until the usual time to transit the tunnel had elapsed. Not seeing daylight, he finally shut down the locomotive, and found that the wheels of his stationary locomotive had ground through two-thirds of the rail web.{{sfnp|Middleton|1974|p=161}}

== Overhead wiring ==
Generally two separate overhead wires are used, with the rail for the third phase, though occasionally three overhead wires are used. At junctions, crossovers and crossings the two lines must be kept apart, with a continuous supply to the locomotive, which must have two live conductors wherever it stops. Hence two collectors per overhead phase are used, but the possibility of bridging a dead section and causing a short circuit from the front collector of one phase to the back collector of the other phase must be avoided.{{sfnp|Maccall|1930|p=412}} The resistance of the rails used for the third phase or return is higher for AC than for DC due to "[[skin effect]]", but lower for the low frequency used than for industrial frequency. Losses are also increased, though not in the same proportion, as the impedance is largely reactive.{{sfnp|Maccall|1930|p=423-424}}

[[File:Corcovado Bergbahn 2005-03-15.jpg|thumb|right|3-phase [[Pantograph (rail)|pantograph]] on a [[Corcovado Rack Railway]] train in [[Brazil]]]]
The locomotive needs to pick up power from two (or three) overhead conductors. Early locomotives on the Italian State Railways used a wide [[bow collector]] which covered both wires but later locomotives used a wide pantograph with two collector bars, side by side. A three-phase system is also prone to larger lengthwise gaps between sections, owing to the complexity of two-wire overhead, and so a long pickup base is needed. In Italy this was achieved with the long bow collectors reaching right to the ends of the locomotive, or with a pair of pantographs, also mounted as far apart as possible.{{sfnp|Hollingsworth|Cook|2000|pages=56–57}}

In the United States, a pair of [[trolley pole]]s were used. They worked well with a maximum speed of {{convert|15|mph}}. The dual conductor [[Pantograph (rail)|pantograph]] system is used on four mountain railways that continue to use three-phase power ([[Corcovado Rack Railway]] in [[Rio de Janeiro|Rio de Janeiro, Brazil]], [[Jungfraubahn]] and [[Gornergratbahn]] in Switzerland and the [[Petit train de la Rhune]] in France).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2043">In [[technical communication]], '''topic-based authoring''' is a [[Modularity|modular]] approach to [[Digital content creation|content creation]] where content is structured around [[Discourse topic|topic]]s that can be mixed and reused in different contexts. It is defined in contrast with ''book-oriented'' or ''narrative'' content, written in the linear structure of written books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://norman.walsh.name/2007/02/05/painting|title=Topic-oriented authoring|author=Norman Walsh|website=norman.walsh.name|date=5 February 2007|accessdate=21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This authoring approach is popular in the technical publications and documentation arenas, as it is adequate for technical documentation. Tools supporting this approach typically store content in [[XML]] document format in a way that facilitates content [[reuse]], [[content management]], and makes the dynamic assembly of personalized information possible.

A topic is a discrete piece of content that is about a specific subject, has an identifiable purpose, and can stand alone (does not need to be presented in context for the end-user to make sense of the content). Topics are also [[Reuse|reusable]]. They can, when constructed properly (without reliance on other content for its meaning), be reused in any context anywhere needed.

The [[Darwin Information Typing Architecture]] (DITA) is a standard designed to help authors create topic-based content. The standard is managed by the [[Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards]] (OASIS) DITA Technical Committee.

'''UWARS''' - Universal Water Activated Release System- is a [[Personal flotation device|life-preserving system]] made by [[Conax Florida Corporation]].  The UWARS is attached to a buckle or [[safety harness|harness]] that, when submerged in water, releases a harness and thus prevents [[drowning]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3526">'''Windshield sun shades''' (also known as sun screen shades, sunscreens, car shades, sun shields, heat shields, or UV shields) are protective shields attached to a car's windshield to keep the sun from reaching the interior and help reduce the temperature inside it.

==Use==

[[File:1980 Toyota Corona (6007632485).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Windshield Sun Shades]] 
The interior of a closed car parked in a non-shaded spot exposed to extensive sunlight can sustain sun and heat damage. Sunlight passing through the car's [[windshield]] produces the [[greenhouse effect]], heating the interior to a temperature much higher than the outside air. Excessive heat and prolonged exposure to direct sunlight can make the dashboard fade and eventually crack, cause seat upholstery discoloration and aging, etc.

The windshield glass itself blocks most of the UV light and some of the infrared [[radiation]]. But it can't protect from the visible light that mostly penetrates through it and gets absorbed by the objects inside the car. The visible light that passes into the interior through the windshield is converted into the infrared light which, in its turn, is blocked by the glass and gets trapped inside, heating up the interior. Windshield sun shades&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greenhouse Physics and Car Shades|url=http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2011/09/19/greenhouse-physics-and-car-sha/}}&lt;/ref&gt; have a reflective surface to bounce the light back, reducing the interior temperature

==Types==

Typically, sun shields look like [[aluminum]] foil that covers the inside of a windshield to reflect the sun's rays. But today the automotive aftermarket offers various options, from simple car shades manufactured from high-density foam with a reflective metalized polyester film to automatic sun shades operated using a [[remote control]].

Removable windshield sun shades are popular thanks to ease of installation and storage as well as an affordable price.

They are available in many designs, including accordion fold, roll up, etc. There are also permanently installed sun shades built directly into the window frame. Some vehicles can be equipped with power sun shades that move up and down with a touch of a button. Some retractable sun shades are attached with an adhesive, suction cups, etc. and roll up on the top or fold at the sides of the windshield. Some car shades&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Windshield Shades Are For Summer And Winter Use|url=http://www.carid.com/articles/windshield-shades-are-for-summer-and-winter-use.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; are designed for winter use and attach to the outside of the windshield (typically with straps) to keep it snow- and ice-free.

==Manufacturers==

A number of companies manufacture car shades, either universal or custom patterned for a precise fit. Covercraft&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Covercraft™|url=http://www.covercraft.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers easy to use sunscreens in a number of colors and patterns. WeatherTech&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WeatherTech™|url=http://www.weathertech.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides vehicle-specific windshield sun shades that protect both from [[UV rays]] in the summer and snow and frost buildup in the winter thanks to reflective surface on the front side and the reverse black side that absorbs the heat in the winter. Coverking&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coverking™|url=http://www.coverking.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; manufactures both sun shields and frost shields for summer and winter use respectively.
