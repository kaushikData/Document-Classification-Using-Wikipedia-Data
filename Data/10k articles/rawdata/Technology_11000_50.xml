'''Addressing modes''' are an aspect of the [[instruction set architecture]] in most [[central processing unit]] (CPU) designs. The various addressing modes that are defined in a given instruction set architecture define how [[machine code|machine language]] [[instruction (computer science)|instructions]] in that architecture identify the [[operand]](s) of each instruction. An addressing mode specifies how to calculate the effective [[memory address]] of an operand by using information held in [[processor register|register]]s and/or constants contained within a machine instruction or elsewhere.

In [[computer programming]], addressing modes are primarily of interest to [[compiler]] writers and to those who write in [[assembly language]]s.

==Caveats==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}
Note that there is no generally accepted way of naming the various addressing modes. In particular, different authors and computer manufacturers may give different names to the same addressing mode, or the same names to different addressing modes. Furthermore, an addressing mode which, in one given architecture, is treated as a single addressing mode may represent functionality that, in another architecture, is covered by two or more addressing modes. For example, some [[complex instruction set computer]] (CISC) architectures, such as the [[Digital Equipment Corporation|Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC)]] [[VAX]], treat registers and [[value (computer science)|literal or immediate constants]] as just another addressing mode. Others, such as the [[IBM System/360]] and its successors, and most [[reduced instruction set computing|reduced instruction set computer]] (RISC) designs, encode this information within the instruction. Thus, the latter machines have three distinct instruction codes for copying one register to another, copying a literal constant into a register, and copying the contents of a memory location into a register, while the VAX has only a single "MOV" instruction.

The term "addressing mode" is itself subject to different interpretations: either "memory address calculation mode" or "operand accessing mode". Under the first interpretation, instructions that do not read from memory or write to memory (such as "add literal to register") are considered not to have an "addressing mode". The second interpretation allows for machines such as VAX which use operand mode bits to allow for a register or for a literal operand. Only the first interpretation applies to instructions such as "load effective address".

The addressing modes listed below are divided into code addressing and data addressing. Most computer architectures maintain this distinction, but there are, or have been, some architectures which allow (almost) all addressing modes to be used in any context.

The instructions shown below are purely representative in order to illustrate the addressing modes, and do not necessarily reflect the mnemonics used by any particular computer.

==Number of addressing modes==
Different computer architectures vary greatly as to the number of addressing modes they provide in hardware. There are some benefits to eliminating complex addressing modes and using only one or a few simpler addressing modes, even though it requires a few extra instructions, and perhaps an extra register.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=36204.36193|title=How many addressing modes are enough?|author1=F.

Lipasti |year=2004 |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill Professional]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; much easier to design [[instruction pipeline|pipelined]] CPUs if the only addressing modes available are simple ones.

Most RISC architectures have only about five simple addressing modes, while CISC architectures such as the DEC VAX have over a dozen addressing modes, some of which are quite complicated. The IBM [[System/360]] architecture had only three addressing modes; a few more have been added for the [[System/390]].

When there are only a few addressing modes, the particular addressing mode required is usually encoded within the instruction code
(e.g. IBM System/360 and successors, most RISC). But when there are lots of addressing modes, a specific field is often set aside in the instruction to specify the addressing mode. The DEC VAX allowed multiple memory operands for almost all instructions, and so reserved the first few [[bit]]s of each operand specifier to indicate the addressing mode for that particular operand.
Keeping the addressing mode specifier bits separate from the opcode operation bits produces an [[orthogonal instruction set]].

Even on a computer with many addressing modes, measurements of actual programs&lt;ref name="hennessy-patterson-c54x"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XX69oNsazH4C&amp;pg=PA104#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach|author1=John L.

==Useful side effect==
Some instruction set architectures, such as [[Intel x86]] and IBM/360 and its successors, have a '''load effective address''' instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This performs a calculation of the effective operand address, but instead of acting on that memory location, it loads the address that would have been accessed into a register. This can be useful when passing the address of an array element to a subroutine. It may also be a slightly sneaky way of doing more calculations than normal in one instruction; for example, using such an instruction with the addressing mode "base+index+offset" (detailed below) allows one to add two registers and a constant together in one instruction.

==Simple addressing modes for code==

===Absolute or direct===
    +----+------------------------------+
    |jump|           address            |
    +----+------------------------------+
 
    (Effective PC address = address)

The effective address for an absolute instruction address is the address parameter itself with no modifications.

===PC-relative===
    +----+------------------------------+
    |jump|           offset             |    jump relative
    +----+------------------------------+
 
    (Effective PC address = next instruction address + offset, offset may be negative)

The effective address for a [[program counter|PC]]-relative instruction address is the offset parameter added to the address of the next instruction. This offset is usually signed to allow reference to code both before and after the instruction.

This is particularly useful in connection with jumps, because typical jumps are to nearby instructions (in a high-level language most '''if''' or '''while''' statements are reasonably short). Measurements of actual programs suggest that an 8 or 10 bit offset is large enough for some 90% of conditional jumps (roughly &amp;plusmn;128 or &amp;plusmn;512 bytes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authors=Kong and Patterson|title=Instruction set design|year=1995|at=Slide 27|url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~pattrsn/152/lec3.ps}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another advantage of PC-relative addressing is that the code may be [[position independent code|position-independent]], i.e. it can be loaded anywhere in memory without the need to adjust any addresses.

Some versions of this addressing mode may be conditional referring to two registers ("jump if reg1=reg2"),
one register ("jump unless reg1=0") or no registers, implicitly referring to some previously-set bit in the [[status register]]. See also [[#conditional execution|conditional execution]] below.

===Register indirect===
    +-------+-----+
    |jumpVia| reg |
    +-------+-----+
 
    (Effective PC address = contents of register 'reg')

The effective address for a Register indirect instruction is the address in the specified register. For example, (A7) to access the content of address register A7.

The effect is to transfer control to the instruction whose address is in the specified register.

Many RISC machines, as well as the CISC [[IBM System/360]] and successors, have subroutine call instructions that place the [[return statement|return address]] in an address register—the register-indirect addressing mode is used to return from that subroutine call.

==Sequential addressing modes==

===Sequential execution===
    +------+
    | nop  |              execute the following instruction
    +------+
 
    (Effective PC address = next instruction address)

The CPU, after executing a sequential instruction, immediately executes the following instruction.

Sequential execution is not considered to be an addressing mode on some computers.

Most instructions on most CPU architectures are sequential instructions.
Because most instructions are sequential instructions, CPU designers often add features that deliberately sacrifice performance on the other instructions—branch instructions—in order to make these sequential instructions run faster.

Conditional branches load the PC with one of 2 possible results, depending on the condition—most CPU architectures use some other addressing mode for the "taken" branch, and sequential execution for the "not taken" branch.

Many features in modern CPUs -- [[instruction prefetch]] and more complex [[pipeline (computing)|pipeline]]ing, [[out-of-order execution]], etc. -- maintain the illusion that each instruction finishes before the next one begins, giving the same final results, even though that's not exactly what happens internally.

Each "[[basic block]]" of such sequential instructions exhibits both temporal and spatial [[locality of reference]].

====CPUs that do not use sequential execution====
CPUs that do not use sequential execution with a program counter are extremely rare. In some CPUs, each instruction always specifies the address of next instruction. Such CPUs have an instruction pointer that holds that specified address; it is not a program counter because there is no provision for incrementing it. Such CPUs include some [[drum memory]] computers such as the [[IBM 650]], the [[SECD machine]], and the RTX 32P.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/stack_computers/sec5_3.html "Architecture of the RTX 32P"]
by Philip Koopman 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

Other computing architectures go much further, attempting to bypass the [[von Neumann architecture#Von Neumann bottleneck|von Neumann bottleneck]] using a variety of [[program counter#Consequences in machine architecture|alternatives to the program counter]].

===Conditional execution===
Some computer architectures have conditional instructions (such as [[ARM architecture|ARM]], but no longer for all instructions in 64-bit mode) or conditional load instructions (such as x86) which can in some cases make conditional branches unnecessary and avoid flushing the [[instruction pipeline]].  An instruction such as a 'compare' is used to set a [[status register|condition code]], and subsequent instructions include a test on that condition code to see whether they are obeyed or ignored.

===Skip===
    +------+-----+-----+
    |skipEQ| reg1| reg2|      skip the next instruction if reg1=reg2
    +------+-----+-----+
 
    (Effective PC address = next instruction address + 1)

Skip addressing may be considered a special kind of PC-relative addressing mode with a fixed "+1" offset. Like PC-relative addressing, some CPUs have versions of this addressing mode that only refer to one register ("skip if reg1=0") or no registers, implicitly referring to some previously-set bit in the [[status register]]. Other CPUs have a version that selects a specific bit in a specific byte to test ("skip if bit 7 of reg12 is 0").

Unlike all other conditional branches, a "skip" instruction never needs to flush the [[instruction pipeline]], though it may need to cause the next instruction to be ignored.

==Simple addressing modes for data==

==={{anchor|REGISTER PLUS REGISTER}}Register (or Register Direct)===
    +------+-----+-----+-----+
    | mul  | reg1| reg2| reg3|      reg1 := reg2 * reg3;
    +------+-----+-----+-----+

This "addressing mode" does not have an effective address and is not considered to be an addressing mode on some computers.

In this example, all the operands are in registers, and the result is placed in a register.

==={{anchor|REGISTER PLUS IMMIEDIATE CONSTANT}}Base plus offset, and variations===
This is sometimes referred to as 'base plus displacement'
    +------+-----+-----+----------------+
    | load | reg | base|     offset     |  reg := RAM[base + offset]
    +------+-----+-----+----------------+
 
    (Effective address = offset + contents of specified base register)

The [[offset (computer science)|offset]] is usually a signed 16-bit value (though the [[80386]] expanded it to 32 bits).

If the offset is zero, this becomes an example of ''register indirect'' addressing; the effective address is just the value in the base register.

On many RISC machines, register&amp;nbsp;0 is fixed at the value zero. If register&amp;nbsp;0 is used as the base register, this becomes an example of ''absolute addressing''. However, only a small portion of memory can be accessed (64 [[kilobyte]]s, if the offset is 16 bits).

The 16-bit offset may seem very small in relation to the size of current computer memories (which is why the [[80386]] expanded it to 32-bit). It could be worse: IBM System/360 mainframes only have an unsigned 12-bit offset. However, the principle of [[locality of reference]] applies: over a short time span, most of the data items a program wants to access are fairly close to each other.

This addressing mode is closely related to the indexed absolute addressing mode.

''Example 1'':
Within a subroutine a programmer will mainly be interested in the parameters and the local variables, which will rarely exceed 64 [[kilobyte|KB]], for which one base register (the [[frame pointer]]) suffices. If this routine is a class method in an object-oriented language, then a second base register is needed which points at the attributes for the current object ('''this''' or '''self''' in some high level languages).

''Example 2'':
If the base register contains the address of a [[composite type]] (a record or structure), the offset can be used to select a field from that record (most records/structures are less than 32 kB in size).

===Immediate/literal===
    +------+-----+-----+----------------+
    | add  | reg1| reg2|    constant    |    reg1 := reg2 + constant;
    +------+-----+-----+----------------+

This "addressing mode" does not have an effective address, and is not considered to be an addressing mode on some computers.

The constant might be signed or unsigned. For example, &lt;code&gt;move.l #$FEEDABBA, D0&lt;/code&gt; to move the immediate hex value of "FEEDABBA" into register D0.

Instead of using an operand from memory, the value of the operand is held within the instruction itself. On the DEC VAX machine, the literal operand sizes could be 6, 8, 16, or 32 bits long.

[[Andrew S. Tanenbaum|Andrew Tanenbaum]] showed that 98% of all the constants in a program would fit in 13 bits (see [[Reduced instruction set computer#RISC design philosophy|RISC design philosophy]]).

===Implicit===
    +-----------------+
    | clear carry bit |
    +-----------------+
 
    +-------------------+
    | clear Accumulator |
    +-------------------+
The implied addressing mode, also called the implicit addressing mode ([[X86 assembly language]]), does not explicitly specify an effective address for either the source or the destination (or sometimes both).

Either the source (if any) or destination effective address (or sometimes both) is implied by the opcode.

Implied addressing was quite common on older computers (up to mid-1970s). Such computers typically had only a single register in which arithmetic could be performed—the accumulator. Such [[accumulator machine]]s implicitly reference that accumulator in almost every instruction. For example, the operation &lt; a := b + c; &gt; can be done using the sequence &lt; load b; add c; store a; &gt; -- the destination (the accumulator) is implied in every "load" and "add" instruction; the source (the accumulator) is implied in every "store" instruction.

Later computers generally had more than one [[general purpose register]] or RAM location which could be the source or destination or both for arithmetic—and so later computers need some other addressing mode to specify the source and destination of arithmetic.

Among the x86 instructions, some use implicit registers for one of the operands or results (multiplication, division, counting conditional jump).

Many computers (such as x86 and AVR) have one special-purpose register called the [[stack pointer]] which is implicitly incremented or decremented when pushing or popping data from the stack, and the source or destination effective address is (implicitly) the address stored in that stack pointer.

Many 32-bit computers (such as 68000, ARM, or PowerPC) have more than one register which could be used as a stack pointer—and so use the "register autoincrement indirect" addressing mode to specify which of those registers should be used when pushing or popping data from a stack.

Some current computer architectures (e.g. IBM/390 and Intel Pentium) contain some instructions with implicit operands in order to maintain backwards compatibility with earlier designs.

On many computers, instructions that flip the user/system mode bit, the interrupt-enable bit, etc. implicitly specify the special register that holds those bits. This simplifies the hardware necessary to trap those instructions in order to meet the [[Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements]]—on such a system, the trap logic does not need to look at any operand (or at the final effective address), but only at the opcode.

A few CPUs have been designed where every operand is always implicitly specified in every instruction -- [[Instruction set#Number of operands|zero-operand]] CPUs.

==Other addressing modes for code or data==

===Absolute/direct===
    +------+-----+--------------------------------------+
    | load | reg |         address                      |
    +------+-----+--------------------------------------+
 
    (Effective address = address as given in instruction)

This requires space in an instruction for quite a large address. It is often available on CISC machines which have variable-length instructions, such as [[x86]].

Some RISC machines have a special ''Load Upper Literal'' instruction which places a 16- or 20-bit constant in the top half of a register.  That can then be used as the base register in a base-plus-offset addressing mode which supplies the low-order 16 or 12 bits.  The combination allows a full 32-bit address.

===Indexed absolute===
    +------+-----+-----+--------------------------------+
    | load | reg |index|         address                |
    +------+-----+-----+--------------------------------+
 
    (Effective address = address + contents of specified index register)

This also requires space in an instruction for quite a large address. The address could be the start of an array or vector, and the index could select the particular array element required. The processor may scale the index register to allow for the [[stride of an array|size of each array element]].

Note that this is more or less the same as base-plus-offset addressing mode, except that the offset in this case is large enough to address any memory location.

''Example 1'':
Within a subroutine, a programmer may define a string as a local constant or a [[static variable]].
The address of the string is stored in the literal address in the instruction.
The offset—which character of the string to use on this iteration of a loop—is stored in the index register.

''Example 2'':
A programmer may define several large arrays as globals or as [[field (computer science)|class variables]].
The start of the array is stored in the literal address (perhaps modified at program-load time by a [[relocating loader]]) of the instruction that references it.
The offset—which item from the array to use on this iteration of a loop—is stored in the index register.
Often the instructions in a loop re-use the same register for the loop counter and the offsets of several arrays.

===Base plus index===
    +------+-----+-----+-----+
    | load | reg | base|index|
    +------+-----+-----+-----+
 
    (Effective address = contents of specified base register + contents of specified index register)

The base register could contain the start address of an array or vector, and the index could select the particular array element required. The processor may scale the [[index register]] to allow for the [[stride of an array|size of each array element]]. This could be used for accessing elements of an array passed as a parameter.

===Base plus index plus offset===
    +------+-----+-----+-----+----------------+
    | load | reg | base|index|         offset |
    +------+-----+-----+-----+----------------+
 
    (Effective address = offset + contents of specified base register + contents of specified index register)

The base register could contain the start address of an array or vector of records, the index could select the particular record required, and the offset could select a field within that record. The processor may scale the index register to allow for the [[stride of an array|size of each array element]].

===Scaled===
    +------+-----+-----+-----+
    | load | reg | base|index|
    +------+-----+-----+-----+
 
    (Effective address = contents of specified base register + scaled contents of specified index register)

The base register could contain the start address of an array or [[vector data structure]], and the index could contain the offset of the one particular array element required.

This addressing mode dynamically scales the value in the index register to allow for the size of each array element, e.g. if the array elements are double precision floating-point numbers occupying 8 bytes each then the value in the index register is multiplied by 8 before being used in the effective address calculation. The scale factor is normally restricted to being a [[power of two]], so that [[bit shift|shifting]] rather than multiplication can be used.

===Register indirect===
    +------+------+-----+
    | load | reg1 | base|
    +------+------+-----+
  
    (Effective address = contents of base register)

A few computers have this as a distinct addressing mode. Many computers just use ''base plus offset'' with an offset value of 0. For example, (A7)

===Register autoincrement indirect===
    +------+-----+-------+
    | load | reg | base  |
    +------+-----+-------+
 
    (Effective address = contents of base register)

After determining the effective address, the value in the base register is incremented by the size of the data item that is to be accessed. For example, (A7)+ would access the content of the address register A7, then increase the address pointer of A7 by 1 (usually 1 word). Within a loop, this addressing mode can be used to step through all the elements of an array or vector.

In high-level languages it is often thought to be a good idea that functions which return a result should not have [[side effect (computer science)|side effects]] (lack of side effects makes program understanding and validation much easier). This addressing mode has a side effect in that the base register is altered. If the subsequent memory access causes an error (e.g. page fault, bus error, address error) leading to an interrupt, then restarting the instruction becomes much more problematic since one or more registers may need to be set back to the state they were in before the instruction originally started.

There have been at least two computer architectures which have had implementation problems with regard to recovery from interrupts when this addressing mode is used:
*Motorola 68000 (address is represented in 24 bits). Could have one or two autoincrement register operands. The [[68010]]+ resolved the problem by saving the processor's internal state on [[bus error|bus]] or address errors.
*DEC VAX. Could have up to 6 autoincrement register operands. Each operand access could cause two [[page fault]]s (if operands happened to straddle a page boundary). Of course the instruction itself could be over 50 bytes long and might straddle a page boundary as well!

===Register autodecrement indirect===
    +------+-----+-----+
    | load | reg | base|
    +------+-----+-----+
 
    (Effective address = new contents of base register)

Before determining the effective address, the value in the base register is decremented by the size of the data item which is to be accessed.

Within a loop, this addressing mode can be used to step backwards through all the elements of an array or vector. A stack can be implemented by using this mode in conjunction with the previous addressing mode (autoincrement).

See the discussion of side-effects under the [[#Register autoincrement indirect|autoincrement addressing mode]].

===Memory indirect===
Any of the addressing modes mentioned in this article could have an extra bit to indicate indirect addressing, i.e. the address calculated using some mode is in fact the address of a location (typically a complete [[word (data type)|word]]) which contains the actual effective address.

Indirect addressing may be used for code or data. It can make implementation of ''pointers'', ''references'', or ''[[handle (computing)|handle]]s'' much easier, and can also make it easier to call subroutines which are not otherwise addressable. Indirect addressing does carry a performance penalty due to the extra memory access involved.

Some early minicomputers (e.g. DEC [[PDP-8]], [[Data General Nova]]) had only a few registers and only a limited addressing range (8 bits). Hence the use of memory indirect addressing was almost the only way of referring to any significant amount of memory.

===PC-relative===
    +------+------+---------+----------------+
    | load | reg1 | base=PC |     offset     |
    +------+------+---------+----------------+
 
    reg1 := RAM[PC + offset]
    (Effective address = PC + offset)

The PC-relative addressing mode can be used to load a register with a value stored in program memory a short distance away from the current instruction. It can be seen as a special case of the "base plus offset" addressing mode, one that selects the program counter (PC) as the "base register".

There are a few CPUs that support PC-relative data references. Such CPUs include:

The [[x86-64]] architecture and the 64-bit [[ARMv8-A]] architecture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://quequero.org/2014/04/introduction-to-arm-architecture/|title=Introduction to ARMv8 64-bit Architecture}}&lt;/ref&gt; have PC-relative addressing modes, called "RIP-relative" in x86-64 and "literal" in ARMv8-A.  The [[Motorola 6809]] also supports a PC-relative addressing mode.

The [[PDP-11]] architecture, the [[VAX]] architecture, and the 32-bit [[ARM architecture]]s support PC-relative addressing by having the PC in the register file.

When this addressing mode is used, the compiler typically places the constants in a [[literal pool]] immediately before or immediately after the subroutine that uses them, to prevent accidentally executing those constants as instructions.

This addressing mode, which always fetches data from memory or stores data to memory and then sequentially falls through to execute the next instruction (the effective address points to data), should not be confused with "PC-relative branch" which does not fetch data from or store data to memory, but instead branches to some other instruction at the given offset (the effective address points to an executable instruction).

==Obsolete addressing modes==
The addressing modes listed here were used in the 1950–1980 period, but are no longer available on most current computers.
This list is by no means complete; there have been many other interesting and peculiar addressing modes used from time to time, e.g.  absolute-minus-logical-OR of two or three index registers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/704/24-6661-2_704_Manual_1955.pdf|title=704 Electronic Data-Processing Machine Manual of Operation|pages=10–11|publisher=[[IBM]]|year=1955}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/7090/22-6528-4_7090Manual.pdf|title=Reference Manual IBM 7090 Data Processing System|pages=9–10|publisher=IBM|year=1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multi-level memory indirect===
If the word size is larger than the address, then the word referenced for memory-indirect addressing could itself have an indirect flag set to indicate another memory indirect cycle. This flag is referred to as an '''indirection bit''', and the resulting pointer is a [[tagged pointer]], the indirection bit tagging whether it is a direct pointer or an indirect pointer. Care is needed to ensure that a chain of indirect addresses does not refer to itself; if it does, one can get an [[infinite loop]] while trying to resolve an address.

The [[IBM 1620]], the [[Data General Nova]], the [[HP 2100]] series, and the [[NAR 2]] each have such a multi-level memory indirect, and could enter such an infinite address calculation loop.
The memory indirect addressing mode on the Nova influenced the invention of [[threaded code#Development of Threaded Code|indirect threaded code]].

The DEC [[PDP-10]] computer with [[18-bit]] addresses and 36-bit words allowed multi-level indirect addressing with the possibility of using an index register at each stage as well.

===Memory-mapped registers===
On some computers, the registers were regarded as occupying the first 8 or 16 words of memory (e.g. [[ICT 1900 series|ICL 1900]], DEC PDP-10). This meant that there was no need for a separate "add register to register" instruction – one could just use the "add memory to register" instruction.

In the case of early models of the PDP-10, which did not have any cache memory, a tight inner loop loaded into the first few words of memory (where the fast registers were addressable if installed) ran much faster than it would have in magnetic core memory.

Later models of the DEC [[PDP-11]] series mapped the registers onto addresses in the input/output area, but this was primarily intended to allow remote diagnostics. Confusingly, the 16-bit registers were mapped onto consecutive 8-bit byte addresses.

===Memory indirect and autoincrement===
The DEC [[PDP-8]] minicomputer had eight special locations (at addresses 8 through 15). When accessed via memory indirect addressing, these locations would automatically increment after use.&lt;ref&gt;{{

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made it easy to step through memory in a loop without needing to use any registers to handle the steps.

The [[Data General Nova]] minicomputer had 16 special memory locations at addresses 16 through 31.&lt;ref&gt;{{

}}&lt;/ref&gt; When accessed via memory indirect addressing, 16 through 23 would automatically increment before use, and 24 through 31 would automatically decrement before use.

===Zero page===
The [[Data General Nova]], [[Motorola 6800]] family, and [[MOS Technology 6502]] family of processors had very few internal registers. Arithmetic and logical instructions were mostly performed against values in memory as opposed to internal registers. As a result, many instructions required a two-byte (16-bit) location to memory. Given that opcodes on these processors were only one byte (8 bits) in length, memory addresses could make up a significant part of code size.

Designers of these processors included a partial remedy known as "zero page" addressing. The initial 256 bytes of memory ($0000 – $00FF; a.k.a., page "0") could be accessed using a one-byte absolute or indexed memory address. This reduced instruction execution time by one clock cycle and instruction length by one byte. By storing often-used data in this region, programs could be made smaller and faster.

As a result, the zero page was used similarly to a register file. On many systems, however, this resulted in high utilization of the zero page memory area by the operating system and user programs, which limited its use since free space was limited.

===Direct page===
The zero page address mode was enhanced in several late model 8-bit processors, including the [[WDC 65816]], the [[CSG 65CE02]], and the [[Motorola 6809]]. The new mode, known as "direct page" addressing, added the ability to move the 256-byte zero page memory window from the start of memory (offset address $0000) to a new location within the first 64&amp;nbsp;KB of memory.

The CSG 65CE02 allowed the direct page to be moved to any 256-byte boundary within the first 64&amp;nbsp;KB of memory by storing an 8-bit offset value in the new base page (B) register. The Motorola 6809 could do the same with its direct page (DP) register. The WDC 65816 went a step further and allowed the direct page to be moved to any location within the first 64&amp;nbsp;KB of memory by storing a 16-bit offset value in the new direct (D) register.

As a result, a greater number of programs were able to utilize the enhanced direct page addressing mode versus legacy processors that only included the zero page addressing mode.

===Scaled index with bounds checking===
This is similar to scaled index addressing, except that the instruction has two extra operands (typically constants), and the hardware checks that the index value is between these bounds.

Another variation uses vector descriptors to hold the bounds; this makes it easy to implement dynamically allocated arrays and still have full bounds checking.

===Register indirect to byte within word===
The DEC [[PDP-10]] computer used [[36-bit]] words. It had special instructions which allowed memory to be treated as a sequence of bytes (bytes could be any size from 1 bit to 36 bits). A one-word sequence descriptor in memory, called a "byte pointer", held the current word address within the sequence, a bit position within a word, and the size of each byte.

Instructions existed to load and store bytes via this descriptor, and to increment the descriptor to point at the next byte (bytes were not split across word boundaries). Much DEC software used five 7-bit bytes per word (plain ASCII characters), with one bit per word unused. Implementations of [[C (programming language)|C]] had to use four 9-bit bytes per word, since the 'malloc' function in C assumes that the size of an ''int'' is some multiple of the size of a ''char'';&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.codingunit.com/c-reference-stdlib-h-function-malloc "C Reference: function malloc()"]&lt;/ref&gt; the actual multiple is determined by the system-dependent compile-time operator [[sizeof]].

===Index next instruction===
The [[Elliott 503]],&lt;ref name="brooks"&gt;Dave Brooks. [https://web.archive.org/web/20141101211113/http://members.iinet.com.au/~daveb/history.html#puzzle "Some Old Computers"].&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Elliott 803]],&lt;ref name="brooks"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bill Purvis. [https://web.archive.org/web/20080616173228/http://bil.members.beeb.net/inst803.html "Some details of the Elliott 803B hardware"]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Apollo Guidance Computer]] only used absolute addressing, and did not have any index registers.
Thus, indirect jumps, or jumps through registers, were not supported in the instruction set. Instead, it could be instructed to ''add the contents of the current memory word to the next instruction''. Adding a small value to the next instruction to be executed could, for example, change a &lt;code&gt;JUMP 0&lt;/code&gt; into a &lt;code&gt;JUMP 20&lt;/code&gt;, thus creating the effect of an indexed jump. Note that the instruction is modified on-the-fly and remains unchanged in memory, i.e. it is not [[self-modifying code]]. If the value being added to the next instruction was large enough, it could modify the opcode of that instruction as well as or instead of the address.

[[File:Avhrr-sea.gif|thumb|500px|An image of global [[sea surface temperature]]s acquired from the NOAA/ AVHRR satellite]]

'''Advanced very-high-resolution radiometer''' (AVHRR) instruments are a type of space-borne sensor that measure the reflectance of the Earth in five spectral bands that are relatively wide by today's standards. Most AVHRR instruments are or have been carried by the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) family of polar orbiting platforms ([[Polar Operational Environmental Satellites|POES]]). The first two are centered on the red (0.6&amp;nbsp;micrometres, 500&amp;nbsp;THz) and near-[[infrared]] (0.9&amp;nbsp;micrometres, 300&amp;nbsp;THz) regions, the third one is located around 3.5&amp;nbsp;micrometres, and the last two sample the thermal radiation emitted by the planet, around 11 and 12&amp;nbsp;micrometres, respectively.  The NOAA satellite has equator crossing times of 0730 and 1930 local [[solar time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Baum, Bryan A. |author2=Wielicki, Bruce A. |title=On the Retrieval and Analysis of Multilevel Clouds|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2060/19980008781|work=NASA|publisher=NASA Technical Reports Server|accessdate=1 October 2011|pages=12|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first AVHRR instrument was a four-channel [[radiometer]], while the latest version (known as AVHRR/3, first carried on the NOAA-15 platform launched in May 1998) acquires data in a 6th channel located at 1.6&amp;nbsp;micrometres.

==Operational procedures==
NOAA has at least two [[polar orbit|polar-orbiting]] meteorological satellites in orbit at all times, with one satellite crossing the equator in the early morning and early evening and the other crossing the equator in the afternoon and late evening. The primary sensor on board both satellites is the AVHRR instrument. Morning-satellite data are most commonly used for land studies, while data from both satellites are used for atmosphere and ocean studies. Together they provide twice-daily global coverage, and ensure that data for any region of the earth are no more than six hours old. The swath width, the width of the area on the Earth's surface that the satellite can "see", is approximately 2,500 kilometers (~1,540 mi). The satellites orbit between 833 or 870 kilometers (+/− 19 kilometers, 516–541 miles) above the surface of the Earth.&lt;ref name=Users&gt;[http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/pod-guide/ncdc/docs/klm/html/c1/sec1-2.htm NOAA KLM User's Guide] Official NOAA POES satellite users guide&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest ground resolution that can be obtained from the current AVHRR instruments is {{convert|1.1|km|mi|adj=on|sp=us}}, which means that the satellite records discrete information for areas on the ground that are 1.1 × 1.1 kilometers. This smallest recorded unit is called a [[pixel]]. AVHRR data have been collected continuously since 1981.&lt;ref name=Users/&gt;

==Applications==
The primary purpose of these instruments is to monitor clouds and to measure the [[blackbody radiation|thermal emission]] of the Earth. These sensors have proven useful for a number of other applications, however, including the surveillance of land surfaces, ocean state, aerosols, etc. AVHRR data are particularly relevant to study [[climate change]] and environmental degradation because of the comparatively long records of data already accumulated (over 20 years). The main difficulty associated with these investigations is to properly deal with the many limitations of these instruments, especially in the early period (sensor calibration, orbital drift, limited spectral and directional sampling, etc.).

The AVHRR instrument also flies on the [[MetOp]] series of satellites. The three planned MetOp satellites are part of the EUMETSAT Polar System (EPS) run by [[EUMETSAT]].

==Calibration and validation==
Remote sensing applications of the AVHRR sensor are based on validation (matchup) techniques of co-located ground observations and satellite observations. Alternatively, radiative transfer calculations are performed. There are specialized codes which allow simulation of the AVHRR observable [[brightness temperature]]s and radiances in near infrared and infrared channels.&lt;ref&gt;[[RTTOV (radiative transfer code)|RTTOV]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Community radiative transfer model]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pre-launch calibration of visible channels (Ch. 1 and 2) ===

Prior to launch, the visible channels (Ch. 1 and 2) of AVHRR sensors are calibrated by the instrument manufacturer, ITT, Aerospace/Communications Division, and are traceable to [[NIST]] standards.  The calibration relationship between electronic digital count response (C) of the sensor and the albedo (A) of the calibration target are linearly regressed:&lt;ref name=Users/&gt;

:A = S * C + I

where S and I are the slope and intercept (respectively) of the calibration regression [NOAA KLM].  However, the highly accurate prelaunch calibration will degrade during launch and transit to orbit as well as during the operational life of the instrument [Molling et al., 2010]. Halthore et al. [2008] note that sensor degradation is mainly caused by thermal cycling, outgassing in the filters, damage from higher energy radiation (such as ultraviolet (UV)), and condensation of outgassed gases onto sensitive surfaces.

One major design fault of AVHRR instruments is that they lack the capability to perform accurate, onboard calibrations once on orbit [NOAA KLM].  Thus, post-launch on-orbit calibration activities (known as vicarious calibration methods) must be performed to update and ensure the accuracy of retrieved radiances and the subsequent products derived from these values [Xiong et al., 2010].  Numerous studies have been performed to update the calibration coefficients and provide more accurate retrievals versus using the pre-launch calibration.

=== On-orbit individual/few sensor absolute calibration ===

==== Rao and Chen ====
Rao and Chen [1995] use the Libyan Desert as a radiometrically stable calibration target to derive relative annual degradation rates for Channels 1 and 2 for AVHRR sensors on board the NOAA -7, -9, and -11 satellites.  Additionally, with an aircraft field campaign over the White Sands desert site in New Mexico, USA [See Smith et al., 1988], an absolute calibration for NOAA-9 was transferred from a well calibrated spectrometer on board a U-2 aircraft flying at an altitude of ~18&amp;nbsp;km in a congruent path with the NOAA-9 satellite above.  After being corrected for the relative degradation, the absolute calibration of NOAA-9 is then passed onto NOAA −7 and −11 via a linear relationship using Libyan Desert observations that are restricted to similar viewing geometries as well as dates in the same calendar month [Rao and Chen, 1995], and any sensor degradation is corrected for by adjusting the slope (as a function of days after launch) between the albedo and digital count signal recorded [Rao and Chen, 1999].

==== Loeb ==== 
In another similar method using surface targets, Loeb [1997] uses spatiotemporal uniform ice surfaces in Greenland and Antarctica to produce second-order polynomial reflectance calibration curves as a function of solar zenith angle; calibrated NOAA-9 near-nadir reflectances are used to generate the curves that can then derive the calibrations for other AHVRRs in orbit (e.g. NOAA-11, -12, and -14).

It was found that the ratio of calibration coefficients derived by Loeb [1997] and Rao and Chen [1995] are independent of solar zenith angle, thus implying that the NOAA-9-derived calibration curves provide an accurate relation between the solar zenith angle and observed reflectance over Greenland and Antarctica.

==== Iwabuchi ==== 
Iwabuchi [2003] employed a method to calibrate NOAA-11 and -14 that uses clear-sky ocean and stratus cloud reflectance observations in a region of the NW Pacific Ocean and radiative transfer calculations of a theoretical molecular atmosphere to calibrate AVHRR Ch. 1.  Using a month of clear-sky observations over the ocean, an initial minimum guess to the calibration slope is made.  An iterative method is then used to achieve the optimal slope values for Ch. 1 with slope corrections adjusting for uncertainties in ocean reflectance, water vapor, ozone, and noise.  Ch. 2 is then subsequently calibrated under the condition that the stratus cloud optical thickness in both channels must be the same (spectrally uniform in the visible) if their calibrations are correct [Iwabuchi, 2003].

==== Vermote and Saleous ====
A more contemporary calibration method for AVHRR uses the on-orbit calibration capabilities of the VIS/IR channels of [[moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer|MODIS]].  Vermote and Saleous [2006] present a methodology that uses MODIS to characterize the BRDF of an invariant desert site.  Due to differences in the spectral bands used for the instruments' channels, spectral translation equations were derived to accurately transfer the calibration accounting for these differences.  Finally, the ratio of AVHRR observed to that modeled from the MODIS observation is used to determine the sensor degradation and adjust the calibration accordingly.

==== Others ====
Methods for extending the calibration and record continuity also make use of similar calibration activities [Heidinger et al., 2010].

=== Long-term calibration and record continuity ===

In the discussion thus far, methods have been posed that can calibrate individual or are limited to a few AVHRR sensors.  However, one major challenge from a climate point of view is the need for record continuity spanning 30+ years of three generations of AVHRR instruments as well as more contemporary sensors such as MODIS and [[Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite|VIIRS]].  Several artifacts may exist in the nominal AVHRR calibration, and even in updated calibrations, that cause a discontinuity in the long-term radiance record constructed from multiple satellites [Cao et al., 2008].

==== International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) method ====
Brest and Rossow [1992], and the updated methodology [Brest et al., 1997], put forth a robust method for calibration monitoring of individual sensors and normalization of all sensors to a common standard.  The [[International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project|International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP)]] method begins with the detection of clouds and corrections for ozone, Rayleigh scatter, and seasonal variations in irradiance to produce surface reflectances.  Monthly histograms of surface reflectance are then produced for various surface types, and various histogram limits are then applied as a filter to the original sensor observations and ultimately aggregated to produce a global, cloud free surface reflectance.

After filtering, the global maps are segregated into monthly mean SURFACE, two bi-weekly SURFACE, and a mean TOTAL reflectance maps.  The monthly mean SURFACE reflectance maps are used to detect long-term trends in calibration.  The bi-weekly SURFACE maps are compared to each other and are used to detect short-term changes in calibration.

Finally, the TOTAL maps are used to detect and assess bias in the processing methodology.  The target histograms are also examined, as changes in mode reflectances and in population are likely the result of changes in calibration.

==== Long-term record continuity ====
Long-term record continuity is achieved by the normalization between two sensors.  First, observations from the operational time period overlap of two sensors are processed.  Next, the two global SURFACE maps are compared via a scatter plot.  Additionally, observations are corrected for changes in solar zenith angle caused by orbital drift.  Ultimately, a line is fit to determine the overall long-term drift in calibration, and, after a sensor is corrected for drift, normalization is performed on observations that occur during the same operational period [Brest et al., 1997].

==== Calibration using the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer ====
Another recent method for the absolute calibration of the AHVRR record makes use of the contemporary [[Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer|MODIS]] sensor onboard NASA's TERRA and AQUA satellites.  The MODIS instrument has high calibration accuracy and can track its own radiometric changes due to the inclusion of an onboard calibration system for the VIS/NIR spectral region [MCST].  The following method utilizes the high accuracy of MODIS to absolutely calibrate AVHRRs via simultaneous nadir overpasses (SNOs) of both MODIS/AVHRR and AVHRR/AVHRR satellite pairs as well as MODIS-characterized surface reflectances for a Libyan Desert target and Dome-C in Antarctica [Heidinger et al., 2010].  Ultimately, each individual calibration event available (MODIS/AVHRR SNO, Dome C, Libyan Desert, or AVHRR/AVHRR SNO) is used to provide a calibration slope time series for a given AVHRR sensor.  Heidinger et al. [2010] use a second-order polynomial from a least-squares fit to determine the time series.

The first step involves using a [[radiative transfer model]] that will convert observed MODIS scenes into those that a perfectly calibrated AVHRR would see.  For MODIS/AVHRR SNO occurrences, it was determined that the ratio of AVHRR to MODIS radiances in both Ch1 and Ch2 are modeled well by a second-order polynomial of the radio of MODIS reflectances in channels 17 and 18.  Channels 17 and 18 are located in a spectral region (0.94mm) sensitive to atmospheric water vapor, a quantity that affects the accurate calibration of AVHRR Ch. 2.  Using the Ch17 to Ch 18 ratio, an accurate guess at the total precipitable water (TPW) is obtained to further increase the accuracy of MODIS to AVHRR SNO calibrations.  The Libyan Desert and Dome-C calibration sites are used when MODIS/AVHRR SNOs do not occur.  Here, the AVHRR to MODIS ratio of reflectances is modeled as a third-order polynomial using the natural logarithm of TWP from the NCEP reanalysis.  Using these two methods, monthly calibration slopes are generated with a linear fit forced through the origin of the adjusted MODIS reflectances versus AVHRR counts.

To extend the MODIS reference back for AVHRRs prior to the MODIS era (pre-2000), Heidinger et al. [2010] use the stable Earth targets of Dome C in Antarctica and the Libyan Desert.  MODIS mean nadir reflectances over the target are determined and are plotted versus the solar zenith angle.  The counts for AVHRR observations at a given solar zenith angle and corresponding MODIS reflectance, corrected for TWP, are then used to determine what AVHRR value would be provided it had the MODIS calibration.  The calibration slope is now calculated.

==== Calibration using direct AVHRR/AVHRR SNOs ====
One final method used by Heidinger et al. [2010] for extending the MODIS calibration back to AVHRRs that operated outside of the MODIS era is through direct AVHRR/AVHRR SNOs.  Here, the counts from AVHRRs are plotted and a regression forced through the origin calculated.  This regression is used to transfer the accurate calibration of one AVHRRs reflectances to the counts of an un-calibrated AVHRR and produce appropriate calibration slopes.  These AVHRR/AVHRR SNOs do not provide an absolute calibration point themselves; rather they act as anchors for the relative calibration between AVHRRs that can be used to transfer the ultimate MODIS calibration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1873">The '''Alberger process''' is a method of producing [[salt]].

It involves mechanical evaporation and uses an open evaporating pan and steam energy. This results in a three-dimensional "cup-shaped" flake salt, which has low [[bulk density]], high solubility and good adhesiveness. The extremely low bulk density makes the salt highly prized in the fast-food industry due to its lower sodium content and stronger flavor for a given volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cargill.com/salt/brands/alberger/index.jsp |title=Alberger® Brand Flake Salts: It's the Shape that Makes it Great |publisher=Cargill |accessdate=November 7, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107142948/http://www.cargill.com/salt/brands/alberger/index.jsp |archive-date=2014-11-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|According to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', "it is a mixture of the grainer-type flake and the flake grown on seed crystals. About 3,000 pounds of steam are required to produce one ton of salt"&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130119140628/http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-12642/Alberger-process Encyclopædia Britannica's entry for Alberger process]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Cargill]] operates a plant in [[St. Clair, Michigan]] that is the only plant in the United States that makes such salt.

The method was patented by [[Charles L. Weil]] on June 8, 1915.&lt;ref&gt;[[European Patent Office]]: {{patent|US|1141999}}. For original patent drawings and description of the process see: [http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument;jsessionid=9E494D3C426CCC5A5A146BDC2E564F1F.espacenet_levelx_prod_6?CC=US&amp;NR=1141999A&amp;KC=A&amp;FT=D&amp;DB=&amp;locale=en_EP Original document].

'''Auto-text''' is a portion of a text preexisting in the [[computer memory]], available as a supplement to newly composed [[document]]s, and suggested to the document author by [[software]]. A block of Auto-text can contain a few [[letter (alphabet)|letter]]s, [[word]]s, [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s or [[paragraph]]s. It can be chosen by the document author via menu or be offered automatically after [[typing]] specific words or letters ([[word prediction]] or text prediction), or be added to the document automatically after typing specific words or letters (word / text completion).

Auto-text saves the time of typists who type many similar documents, or serves as an [[assistive technology]] for aiding persons with [[disability|disabilities]]. These disabilities may be [[hand|upper-limb]] disabilities that slow down movement, or produce [[pain]] or [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], as well as [[spelling]] disorders (e.g. [[dysgraphia]]). Persons with [[speech]] disabilities who type on [[augmentative and alternative communication]] devices may also benefit from Auto-text, since it can speed up their [[communication]].

Examples of software that offer Auto-text:
* [[Microsoft Word]]
* [[SoothSayer 4]]
* [[Kurzweil 3000]]

'''Auzentech''' was a [[Korea]]n [[computer hardware]] manufacturer that specialized in high-definition audio equipment and in particular PC [[sound card]]s.

Auzentech has its origins in March 2005, when under the company name '''HDA''' (HiTeC Digital Audio),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hidiaudio.com/ |title=HiTeC Digital Audio|date=2005-05-14 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050514015702/http://www.hidiaudio.com/ |archivedate = 2005-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; the company launched the X-Mystique 7.1, the first consumer add-in sound card to feature [[Dolby Digital Live]].
Initially only a manufacturer, HDA's products were commercialized worldwide by a network of local distributors, including '''BlueGears''' as their vendor in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.importgenius.com/shipments/hitec-digital-audio.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130126003511/http://www.importgenius.com/shipments/hitec-digital-audio.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-26 |title=HITEC DIGITAL AUDIO INC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rage3dqa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rage3d.com/reviews/sound/auzentechxplosion/index.php?p=2|title=HDA X-Plosion 7.1 DTS Connect, Page 2|work=Rage3D|date=March 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penstarsys.com/reviews/sound/bluegears/xmystique/index.html |title=BlueGears X-Mystique 7.1 Review |accessdate=March 7, 2010 |work=PentarSys |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206143242/http://www.penstarsys.com/reviews/sound/bluegears/xmystique/index.html |archivedate=December 6, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the company took distribution into their own hands, ceasing relations with BlueGears, and subsequently changing their brand name to '''Auzen''' (a name which originates from "Audio" and "Zen")&lt;ref name=rage3dqa/&gt; and their company name to '''Auzentech'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auzentech.com/site/support/FAQ.php|title=Sound Card FAQ|accessdate=March 7, 2010|work=Auzentech| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100328100718/http://www.auzentech.com/site/support/FAQ.php| archivedate= 28 March 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since that time the company continued to incorporate new sound cards into their lineup in an effort to compete in a market dominated by [[Creative Labs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auzentech.com/site/company/pressrelease_02142006_auzentech_.php|title=AUZENTECH challenges Creative Labs with the release of HDA XPLOSION 7.1 DTS Connect|work=Auzentech|date=2006-02-14|accessdate=March 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auzentech sought to provide customers with features not present in Creative's sound cards at that time, such as real time multi-channel audio encoding and built-in [[TOSLINK]] connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.rage3d.com/reviews/sound/auzentechxplosion/|title=HDA X-Plosion 7.1 DTS Connect, Page 2|work=Rage3D|date=March 11, 2006|accessdate=March 8, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100414033518/http://www.rage3d.com/reviews/sound/auzentechxplosion/| archivedate= 14 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; These features enable users to have multichannel realtime audio (like that originating in PC games) over a single digital line, instead of the previously unavoidable three analog lines running from the PC to the speakers. Also present in all Auzentech sound cards are user-replaceable [[OPAMP]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techgage.com/article/auzentech_x-meridian_71/|title=Auzentech X-Meridian 7.1|work=TechGage|date=2007-02-28|accessdate=March 8, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100131091433/http://techgage.com/article/auzentech_x-meridian_71/| archivedate= 31 January 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; which offer the possibility to further improve the out-of-the-box quality of [[analog audio|analog]] outputs.

Eventually expansion led Auzentech to broaden their range of products to include items such as [[Loudspeaker|speaker]]s, [[microphone]]s and [[PC case]]s among others.

Auzentech has recently switched from the [[C-Media]] audio processors used in their earlier cards to the [[X-Fi (audio chip)|X-Fi]] audio [[Digital signal processor|DSP]], licensed from their competitor, Creative Labs.

Since late 2013, Auzentech's official web site has been directing to a park page, and their technical support department ceased to provide any service.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1939">Based in [[Brazil]], '''''Clube do Hardware''''' (meaning "Hardware Club" in Brazilian Portuguese) is one of the largest websites about computers in [[South America]] and also one of the biggest in the world. According to [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]], as of 2018, Clube do Hardware is the 185th most accessed website in Brazil&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/clubedohardware.com.br|title=clubedohardware.com.br Traffic Statistics|website=Alexa|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Clube do Hardware publishes tutorials, articles, reviews, and news about computer hardware and has a very active forum where users can discuss technology topics.

It has a very engaged community, with the largest Brazilian team at the [[Folding@Home]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fah-web.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/main.py?qtype=teamstats|title=Folding@Home Team Statistics|access-date=2018-06-29|publisher=[[Stanford University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

It was created in 1996 by the Brazilian PC hardware expert Gabriel Torres, initially as a personal webpage on [[Geocities]] with the title "Hardware by Gabriel Torres" as a portfolio of his work. In 1997 the author registered the domain gabrieltorres.com with the website, changing its name to "Hardware Site." The final name, Clube do Hardware, was adopted in 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.clubedohardware.com.br/artigos/outros/clube-do-hardware-5-anos-conhe%C3%A7a-nossa-hist%C3%B3ria-r33778/|title=Clube do Hardware: 5 anos!

'''Dühring's plot''' is a [[Cartesian coordinate system|graphical]] representation of such a relationship, typically with the pure liquid's [[boiling point]] along the x-axis and the mixture's boiling point along the y-axis; each line of the graph represents a constant concentration.

'''Felix Meyer''' came from a [[liberal Jewish]] family with roots traceable to sixteenth-century [[Westphalia]].  The brothers Elias and Moses (later  Moritz) Meyer established themselves at [[Aachen]], founding a successful textile factory.  Moritz Meyer’s son, Eduard, joined the firm, married Esther Pauline Salomon in 1874 and  a daughter, Else, was born the same year, followed by five other children, of whom Felix, born in 1875, was the eldest, the others being Georg, Dora, Meta and Erna.

==Early years==
Eduard Meyer’s family lived well, in a sixteen-room  house, with servants, a large garden and stables. While they were not religiously fervent, they did not convert to Christianity.  In later reminiscences, Felix spoke of a happy, even boisterous, childhood, though the upbringing for the boys in the family was severe, involving regular [[corporal punishment]], though he himself proved to be an indulgent father. In particular, he left his daughters free to choose their husbands. A rebel at school, he followed his own father to the extent of undertaking several technical apprenticeships as a dyer, spinner and weaver. He also took jobs in several different companies in Germany, but also in England, before joining his father’s then flagging business at the age of 22.

==New Energies==
The once flourishing firm had not found in Felix’s father an entrepreneural talent to equal the firm’s founder, and as Felix put it, ‘...the money disappeared rapidly since nobody  knew how to earn it, but only how to spend it’.  Felix Meyer rose to the occasion with innovation. For one thing he invented a twin loom, but the sale of the patent was insufficient to relaunch the factory’s fortunes and in 1905 he convinced his father to sell the mill, taking on the remaining debts himself.  In 1906, Felix married Marguerite Darmstaedter, a [[Belgian people|Belgian]] national, and they set up home in the Kurbrunnenstrasse, in [[Aachen]]. Though the dwelling was modest, it was near the [[Cologne-Liège railway]] and there was a shed that Felix used for developing his inventions, which were many and varied, including forays into mechanics, chemical processes and even medical appliances. While the definitive number of patents registered under various names is uncertain, it probably reached several hundred, including new designs of loom, processes for manufacturing multi-coloured  yarns or fabrics. Meyer worked quite a lot exploiting the possibilities of cellulose, with applications in the form of  artificial limbs, for which he also constructed new joints. In the 1920s and 1930s, Meyer was occupied with the enhanced manufacture of glass  tubes, ampoules, etc. and for filling and sealing these.   Already in 1906, the newlyweds could evidently make  a living from the success of the inventions. The firm  Rotawerke was founded in 1909 and thereafter Meyer heeded the earlier business decline of his family in that he did not draw a salary, but simply fed his own pension fund. A daughter, Kläre (later known as Claire), was born in 1907 and another, Margot, in 1909.

The [[united German Empire]] proclaimed in the [[Hall of Mirrors]] at [[Versailles]] in the aftermath of the [[Franco-Prussian War]], followed its destiny, especially during the reign of [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|William II]], towards becoming a vast militaristic-industrial complex and simultaneously largely losing control of its own foreign policy. When the summer of 1914 saw the outbreak of the [[Great War]], this was hailed with enthusiasm by the patriotic German public, and there was no doubt that the course of events would echo those of the rapid victory of 1870. Felix Meyer was a fervent patriot whose spirit was undaunted by defeat or postwar conditions. The debts from his father’s time were finally paid off, and the family and its business prospered. Rotawerke had branches in Belgium and France and business ties to Britain. Meyer was wealthy enough to support young artists.

==The Rude Awakening==
Meyer remained a German patriot, and refused like other assimilated Jews to believe that the rise to power of the [[Nazi party]] constituted a danger. In Meyer’s case, he even returned to Germany in 1938 from a journey to the United States with his wife. That same year, however, events caught up with him, especially after the so-called [[Kristallnacht]] of 9–10 November,  during which he spent some hours under arrest. This must certainly have been a great shock for Meyer and his wife. He had taken the precaution of carrying a capsule with poison on him and in a letter to his daughters he asked them to show understanding if he or his wife should decide to commit suicide. By the end of the year Meyer had been forced out of the firm under the so-called '[[Aryanization (Nazism)|Arianization]]' process,  and its management had been reluctantly taken over for the greater part by his son-in-law [[John Hennig]], husband since 1933 of Meyer’s daughter Kläre, and with her a convert to Catholicism, in Hennig’s case from [[Lutheranism]].

==Emigration of the Meyers and the Hennigs==
In February 1939 Meyer was allowed to emigrate legally to Belgium, being married to a Belgian woman, and with the complicity of officials  he knew. However, already in May Germany invaded  the Netherlands and Belgium and the couple  failed in an attempt to escape to France.  They were now stranded as German Jews in  German-occupied Belgium, a situation which lasted till the liberation by the Allies in 1944.

Later that same year, in October 1939,  Meyer's son-in-law Hennig emigrated legally to the [[Irish Free State]] to prepare a home there for his wife and family, who joined him a month later. Despite the separation and the many difficulties of these years, Felix Meyer and his wife Marguerite maintained a strongly affectionate relationship with their daughter and her family.

==Wartime Belgium==
Meyer showed remarkable strength of character and a courage that almost defies belief. His exploits included complaining in person to the Gestapo about illegal detention of Jews. In that strange mental world of ice-cold cruelty and pseudo-bureaucratic meticulousness, Meyer succeeded in having well over a hundred Belgian and foreign Jews released one by one, arguing in detail their cases. He also alleviated the conditions of others, sometimes adducing the rights implied by military decorations awarded prior to the advent of Nazism. A man of the world, Meyer exploited the rivalry between committed Nazis and other military and civilian personnel and perhaps, too, the fear that some of his interlocutors had of facing legal retribution after the war. Meyer’s initiatives solely of benefit to small numbers of people, since he arranged shelter and medical care for hundreds.

As to Felix Meyer’s humanitarian activities in wartime Belgium, many testimonies are conserved at    Jerusalem’s [[Yad Vashem]] memorial site.

The end of hostilities in Europe brought little immediate alleviation in general conditions, though Meyer fought for his humanitarian projects and to retrieve possession of his family firm and eventually met with success, though the struggle contributed to his early death in Brussels on 14 April 1950. He is buried in the Alter Jüdischer Friedhof (Old Jewish Cemetery) [[Aachen]]. With him is buried his wife, Esther, who died in 1966.

==The Firm Survives==
Some years passed before in  1956 the Hennigs made the decision to return  to the Continent, largely for the sake of their daughters’ future, but also to allow Hennig to take control of the Meyer business, now restored to family ownership. A plant of the firm, known as Rota, had been established at Säckingen in Germany,    on the southern edge of the Black Forest area. [[John Hennig]] took on its management, but the events of the Nazi period were such that the family could not bring itself to refound their family life on German soil. Instead, they took up residence in nearby [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]], Hennig commuting from there over the border daily to manage the firm. The work was not of the kind that Hennig relished, but it  ensured the family’s financial stability and was in any case seen by him as a duty to the memory of his revered father-in-law. The firm later became a subsidiary of the Japanese [[Yokogawa Electric|Yokogawa]] group.

'''Financial innovation''' is the act of creating new financial instruments as well as new [[Financial technology|financial technologies]], [[Financial institution|institution]]s, and [[Financial market|markets]]. Recent financial innovations include [[hedge fund]]s, [[private equity]], [[weather derivative]]s, [[Structured product|retail-structured products]], [[exchange-traded fund]]s, [[multi-family offices]], and Islamic bonds ([[Sukuk]]). The shadow banking system has spawned an array of financial innovations including [[mortgage-backed securities]] products and [[collateralized debt obligations]] (CDOs).&lt;ref name="ftdef"/&gt;

There are three categories of innovation—institutional, product, and process. Institutional innovations relate to the creation of new types of financial firms such as specialist credit card firms like [[MBNA]], [[Discount brokerage|discount broking firms]] such as [[Charles Schwab Corporation|Charles Schwab]], and internet banks. Product innovation relates to new products such as [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]], [[Securitization|securitized assets]], and [[foreign currency mortgage]]s. Process innovations relate to new ways of doing financial business, including [[online banking]] and [[telephone banking]].&lt;ref name="ftdef"&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Financial Innovation| url= http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=financial-innovation|website=Financial Times|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Economic theory has much to say about what types of [[Security (finance)|securities]] should exist, and why some may not exist (why some markets should be "[[Incomplete markets|incomplete]]") but little to say about why new types of securities should come into existence.

One interpretation of the [[Modigliani-Miller theorem]] is that taxes and regulation are the only reasons for investors to care what kinds of securities firms issue, whether debt, equity, or something else. The theorem states that the structure of a firm's liabilities should have no bearing on its net worth (absent taxes). The securities may trade at different prices depending on their composition, but they must ultimately add up to the same value.

Furthermore, there should be little demand for specific types of securities. The [[capital asset pricing model]], first developed by [[Jack L. Treynor]] and [[William F. Sharpe]], suggests that investors should fully [[Diversification (finance)|diversify]] and their portfolios should be a mixture of the "market" and a risk-free investment. Investors with different risk/return goals can use leverage to increase the ratio of the market return to the risk-free return in their portfolios. However, [[Richard Roll]] argued that this model was incorrect, because [[Roll's critique|investors cannot invest in the entire market]]. This implies there should be demand for instruments that open up new types of investment opportunities (since this gets investors closer to being able to buy the entire market), but not for instruments that merely repackage existing risks (since investors already have as much exposure to those risks in their portfolio).

If the world existed as the [[Arrow-Debreu model]] posits, then there would be no need for financial innovation. The model assumes that investors are able to purchase securities that pay off if and only if a certain state of the world occurs. Investors can then combine these securities to create portfolios that have whatever payoff they desire. The [[Fundamental theorem of arbitrage-free pricing|fundamental theorem of finance]] states that the price of assembling such a portfolio will be equal to its [[expected value]] under the appropriate [[risk-neutral measure]].

== Academic literature ==
Tufano (2003) and Duffie and Rahi (1995) provide useful reviews of the literature.

The extensive literature on [[principal–agent problem]]s, [[adverse selection]], and [[information asymmetry]] points to why investors might prefer some types of securities, such as debt, over others like equity. Myers and Majluf (1984) develop an adverse selection model of equity issuance, in which firms (which are trying to maximize profits for existing shareholders) issue equity only if they are desperate. This was an early article in the [[Pecking Order Theory|pecking order]] literature, which states that firms prefer to finance investments out of retained earnings first, then debt, and finally equity, because investors are reluctant to trust any firm that needs to issue equity.

Duffie and Rahi also devote a considerable section to examining the utility and efficiency implications of financial innovation. This is also the topic of many of the papers in the special edition of the ''[[Journal of Economic Theory]]'' in which theirs is the lead article. The usefulness of spanning the market appears to be limited (or, equivalently, the disutility of incomplete markets is not great).

Allen and Gale (1988) is one of the first papers to endogenize security issuance contingent on [[financial regulation]]—specifically, bans on short sales. In these circumstances, they find that the traditional split of cash flows between debt and equity is not optimal, and that state-contingent securities are preferred. Ross (1989) develops a model in which new financial products must overcome marketing and distribution costs. Persons and Warther (1997) studied booms and busts associated with financial innovation.

The fixed costs of creating liquid markets for new financial instruments appears to be considerable. Black and Scholes (1974) describe some of the difficulties they encountered when trying to market the forerunners to modern [[index fund]]s. These included regulatory problems, marketing costs, taxes, and fixed costs of management, personnel, and trading. Shiller (2008) describes some of the frustrations involved with creating a market for house price futures.

== Examples ==

=== Spanning the market ===
Some types of financial instrument became prominent after macroeconomic conditions forced investors to be more aware of the need to hedge certain types of risk.
* [[Interest rate swap]]s were developed in the early 1980s after interest rates skyrocketed
* [[Credit default swap]]s were develeoped in the early 2000s after the [[Early 2000s recession|recession]] beginning in 2001 led to the highest corporate-bond default rate in 2002 since the [[Great Depression]]

=== Mathematical innovation ===
* [[Option (finance)|Options]] markets experienced explosive growth after the [[Black–Scholes]] model was developed in 1973
* [[Collateralized debt obligation]]s (CDOs) were heavily influenced by the popularization of the [[Copula (statistics)|copula]] technique&lt;ref name="davidx"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=David X. Li|authorlink1=David X. Li|title=On Default Correlation: A Copula Function Approach|journal=[[Journal of Fixed Income]] |date=2000|volume=9|issue=4|pages=43–54|doi=10.2139/ssrn.187289|url=http://www.ressources-actuarielles.net/EXT/ISFA/1226.nsf/9c8e3fd4d8874d60c1257052003eced6/34e84cb615c8b4eac12575fe006a9759/$FILE/li.defaultcorrelation.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Flash trading]] came into existence in 2000 at the [[Chicago Board Options Exchange]] and 2006 in the [[stock market]]. In July 2010, [[Direct Edge]] became a [[U.S. Futures Exchange]]. [[Nasdaq]] and [[Bats Exchange, Inc]] created their own flash markets in early 2009.

Futures, options, and many other types of [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]] have been around for centuries: the [[Japanese rice#Trading|Japanese rice futures market]] started trading around 1730. However, recent decades have seen an explosion use of derivatives and mathematically complicated [[securitization]] techniques. From a sociological point of view, some economists argue that mathematical formulas actually change the way that economic agents use and price assets. Economists, rather than acting as a camera taking an objective picture of the way the world works, actively change behavior by providing formulas that let dispersed agents agree on prices for new assets.&lt;ref name="mac"&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacKenzie|first1=Donald|title=An Engine, Not a Camera: How Financial Models Shape Markets|date=2008|publisher=MIT Press|location=Boston|isbn=9780262250047|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M3x5tvAwzrQC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Avoiding taxes and regulation ===
Miller (1986) placed great emphasis on the role of taxes and government regulation in stimulating financial innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
| doi = 10.2307/2330693| volume = 21| issue = 4| pages = 459–471 | last = Miller| first = Merton H.| title = Financial Innovation: The Last Twenty Years and the Next| journal = The Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis| year = 1986| jstor = 2330693}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Modigliani-Miller theorem]] explicitly considered taxes as a reason to prefer one type of security over another, despite that corporations and investors should be indifferent to capital structure in a fractionless world.

The development of [[checking account]]s at U.S. banks was in order to avoid punitive taxes on state bank notes that were part of the [[National Banking Act]].

Some investors use [[total return swap]]s to convert dividends into capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.internationaltaxreview.com/?Page=10&amp;PUBID=35&amp;ISS=24454&amp;SID=700023&amp;SM=&amp;SearchStr=passive%20investment%20income&lt;/ref&gt;

Many times, regulators have explicitly discouraged or outlawed trading in certain types of financial securities. In the United States, [[Gambling in the United States|gambling]] is mostly illegal, and it can be difficult to tell whether financial contracts are illegal gambling instruments or legitimate tools for investment and risk-sharing. The [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]] (CFTC) is in charge of making this determination. The difficulty that the [[Chicago Board of Trade]] faced in attempting to trade [[futures contracts|futures]] on stocks and stock indexes is described in Melamed (1996).

In the United States, [[Regulation Q]] drove several types of financial innovation to get around its interest rate ceilings, including [[eurodollar]]s and [[Negotiable Order of Withdrawal account|NOW accounts]].

== Role of technology ==
Some types of financial innovation are driven by improvements in computer and telecommunication technology. For example, [[Paul Volcker]] suggested that for most people, the creation of the [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] was a greater financial innovation than [[Asset-backed security|asset-backed securitization]].&lt;ref name="volker1"&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/marketsNewsUS/idUKN2029103720090220 "Crisis may be worse than Depression, Volcker says"], ''Reuters'', February 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Other types of financial innovation affecting the payments system include [[credit card|credit]] and [[debit card]]s and online payment systems like [[PayPal]].

These types of innovations are notable because they reduce [[transaction cost]]s. Households need to keep lower cash balances—if the economy exhibits [[cash-in-advance constraint]]s then these kinds of financial innovations can contribute to greater efficiency. One study of Italian households' use of debit cards found that ownership of an ATM card resulted in benefits worth €17 annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These types of innovations may also affect [[monetary policy]] by reducing real household balances. Especially with the increased popularity of [[online banking]], households are able to keep greater percentages of their wealth in non-cash instruments. In a special edition of ''International Finance'' devoted to the interaction of [[e-commerce]] and central banking, Goodhart (2000) and [[Michael Woodford (economist)|Woodford]] (2000) express confidence in the ability of a central bank to maintain its policy goals by affecting the short-term interest rate even if electronic money has eliminated the demand for central bank liabilities,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

A 2016 [[PwC]] report pointed to the "accelerating pace of technological change" as the "most creative force—and also the most destructive—in the financial services ecosystem".&lt;ref name="pwc2016"&gt;{{cite book|title=Financial Services Technology 2020 and Beyond: Embracing Disruption|date=2016|publisher=PwC|url=https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/financial-services/assets/pdf/technology2020-and-beyond.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Some economists argue that financial innovation has little to no [[productivity]] benefit: [[Paul Volcker]] stated that "there is little correlation between sophistication of a banking system and productivity growth",&lt;ref name="volker1"/&gt; that there is no "neutral evidence that financial innovation has led to economic growth",&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Hosking and Suzy Jagger,[http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/banking_and_finance/article6949387.ece "'Wake up, gentlemen', world's top bankers warned by former Fed chairman Volcker"], ''The Times of London'', December 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and that financial innovation was a cause of the [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]],&lt;ref&gt;Tim Iacono, [http://seekingalpha.com/article/177300-paul-volcker-atm-was-the-peak-of-financial-innovation "Paul Volcker: ATM Was the Peak of Financial Innovation"], ''Seeking Alpha'' December 9, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Paul Krugman]] states that "the rapid growth in finance since 1980 has largely been a matter of [[rent-seeking]], rather than true productivity".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Krugman, [https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/09/darling-i-love-you/ Darling, "I love you"], The Conscience of a Liberal, ''[[New York Times]],'' December 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2012}}
A '''fuel tank''' (or '''petrol tank''') is a safe container for [[Flammability|flammable]] fluids.  Though any [[storage tank]] for fuel may be so called, the term is typically applied to part of an engine system in which the [[fuel]] is stored and propelled ([[fuel pump]]) or released (pressurized gas) into an [[engine]]. Fuel tanks range in size and complexity from the small plastic tank of a [[butane]] [[lighter (fire starter)|lighter]] to the multi-chambered [[Cryogenics|cryogenic]] [[Space Shuttle external tank]].

[[File:B-25 bomb bay gas tanks.jpg|thumb|The fuel tanks for [[B-25]] bombers]]
[[File:Wasserstoffeinfüllstutzen eines BMW.jpg|thumb|Fill caps on a [[BMW]] automobile for [[hydrogen]] (left) and for gasoline (right) fuel tanks]]

== Uses ==
Typically, a fuel tank must allow or provide the following:

* Storage of fuel: the system must contain a given quantity of fuel and must avoid leakage and limit evaporative emissions.
* Filling: the fuel tank must be filled in a secure way, without sparks.
* Provide a method for determining level of fuel in tank, [[fuel gauge|gauging]] (the remaining quantity of fuel in the tank must be measured or evaluated).
* Venting (if over-pressure is not allowed, the fuel vapors must be managed through valves).
* Feeding of the [[engine]] (through a pump).
* Anticipate potentials for damage and provide safe survival potential.

Plastic ([[high-density polyethylene]] HDPE) as a fuel tank material of construction, while functionally viable in the short term, has a long term potential to become saturated as fuels such as diesel and gasoline permeate the HDPE material.

Considering the inertia and kinetic energy of fuel in a plastic tank being transported by a vehicle, [[environmental stress cracking]] is a definite potential. The flammability of fuel makes stress cracking a possible cause of catastrophic failure. Emergencies aside, HDPE plastic is suitable for short term storage of diesel and gasoline. In the U.S., [[Underwriters Laboratories]] approved (UL 142) tanks would be a minimum design consideration.

== Fuel tank construction ==
[[File:Apollo Lunar Module Fuel Tank.jpg|thumb|Fuel tank for the [[Apollo Lunar Module]], 1960s]]
While most tanks are manufactured, some fuel tanks are still fabricated by metal craftsmen or hand-made in the case of bladder-style tanks. These include custom and restoration tanks for automotive, aircraft, motorcycles, boats and even tractors. Construction of fuel tanks follows a series of specific steps. The craftsman generally creates a mockup to determine the accurate size and shape of the tank, usually out of foam board. Next, design issues that affect the structure of the tank are
addressed - such as where the outlet, drain, fluid level indicator, seams, and baffles go. Then the craftsmen must determine the thickness, temper and alloy of the sheet he will use to make the tank. After the sheet is cut to the shapes needed, various pieces are bent to create the basic shell and/or ends and baffles for the tank. Many fuel tanks' baffles (particularly in aircraft and racecars) contain [[lightening holes]]. These flanged holes serve two purposes, they reduce the weight of the tank while adding strength to the baffles. Toward the end of construction, openings are added for the filler neck, fuel pickup, drain, and fuel-level sending unit. Sometimes these holes are created on the flat shell, other times they are added at the end of the fabrication process. Baffles and ends can be riveted into place. The heads of the rivets are frequently brazed or soldered to prevent tank leaks. Ends can then be hemmed in and soldered, or flanged and brazed (and/or sealed with an epoxy-type sealant) or the ends can be flanged and then welded. Once the soldering, brazing or welding is complete, the fuel tank is leak-tested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=White |first=Kent |title=Tanks A Lot - Methods for Metal Fuel Tank Development and Fabrication |journal=Home Shop Machinist |date=November–December 2010 |volume=29 |issue=6  |pages=12–23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Automotive fuel tanks ==
The maximum distance a combustion-engine powered car with a full tank can cover is the product of the tank capacity and its [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel efficiency]] (as in miles per gallon). While larger tanks increase the maximum distance, they also take up more space and (especially when full) add to the total weight, requiring higher fuel consumption for the same performance. Fuel-tank capacity is therefore the result of a trade-off in design considerations. For most [[compact car]]s, the capacity is in the range {{convert|45|-|65|L|USgal}}; the original model [[Tata Nano]] is exceptional with its {{convert|15|L|USgal|0}} fuel tank. [[SUV]]s and [[truck]]s tend to have considerably larger fuel tanks.

For each new vehicle a specific fuel system is developed, to optimize the use of available space.  Moreover, for one car model, different fuel system architectures are developed, depending on the type of the car, the type of fuel (gasoline or diesel), nozzle models, and region.

Two technologies are used to make fuel tanks for automobiles:

* Metal ([[steel]] or [[aluminium|aluminum]]) fuel tanks welded from stamped sheets.  Although this technology is very good in limiting fuel emissions, it tends to be less competitive and thus less on the market, although until recent times automotive fuel tanks were almost exclusively made from sheet metal.
* Plastic [[high-density polyethylene]] (HDPE) fuel tanks made by [[blow molding]]. Blow molded HDPE can take complex shapes, for instance allowing the tank to be mounted directly over the rear axle, saving space and improving crash safety. Initially there were concerns over the low [[fracture toughness]] of HDPE, when compared to steel or aluminum. Concern for safety and long term ability to function should be considered and monitored.

Modern cars often feature remote opening of the fuel tank fuel filler flap using an [[electric motor]] or cable release.  For both convenience and security, many modern fuel tanks cannot be opened by hand or otherwise from the outside of the car.

=== Reserve tank ===
Sometimes called the [[Fuel reserve|reserve tank]] is a secondary fuel tank (in many cars/bikes it contains around 15% of the capacity of the primary tank) these are more commonly found on bikes, older cars (some without a fuel gauge) and vehicles designed for long distance or special use. A light on the instrument panel indicates when the fuel level dips below a certain point in the tank. There is no current standard, although some efforts are made to collect this data for all automobiles.

In vehicles modified for endurance the primary tank (the one that comes with the car) is made into a reserve tank and a larger one installed. Some 4x4 vehicles can be fitted with a secondary (or sub-tank) by the dealership.

=== Ship in a bottle ===
The ''ship in a bottle'' fuel tank is a manufacturing design developed by TI Automotive in [[Rastatt|Rastatt, Germany]] wherein all fuel delivery components including the pump, control electronics and most hosing are encased within a blow-molded plastic fuel tank,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20050627/SUB/506270710/ti-introduces-fuel-tank-technology|title=TI introduces fuel tank technology|publisher=Automotive News|date=2005-06-27 |accessdate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and named after the traditional [[Impossible bottle|ship-in-a-bottle]] mechanical puzzle. The technique was developed to reduce fuel vapor emissions in response to [[Partial zero-emissions vehicle|Partial Zero-Emission Vehicle]] (PZEV) requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=High Tech Fuel Tanks|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/features/high-tech-fuel-tanks|website=Car and Driver|accessdate=6 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161106191229/http://www.caranddriver.com/features/high-tech-fuel-tanks|archivedate=6 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first application was for the 2005 [[Ford GT]].
=== Racing fuel cell ===&lt;!--linked from [[Formula One regulations]] and others--&gt;
[[File:Porsche GT3 trunk (front) (6293634244).jpg|thumb|FIA FT3 safety fuel bladder in the [[Porsche 911 GT3|Porsche GT3 Cup]] racing car]]
A ''racing fuel cell'' has a rigid outer shell and flexible inner lining to minimize the potential for punctures in the event of a collision or other mishap resulting in serious damage to the vehicle.  It is filled with an open-cell foam core to prevent explosion of vapor in the empty portion of the tank and to minimize sloshing of fuel during competition that may unbalance the vehicle or cause inadequate fuel delivery to the motor ([[fuel starvation]]).  The designation "racing" is often omitted due to familiarity and because this type of gas tank is also used on street vehicles.  The omission can lead to confusion with other types of fuel cells.  See [[Fuel cell (disambiguation)]].

=== Placement and safety ===
For safety considerations, in modern cars the fuel tank is usually located ahead of the rear axle, out of the [[crumple zone]]s of the car.

Automobiles such as the [[Ford Pinto memo|Ford Pinto]] or the models that still use the [[Ford Panther platform]] ([[Ford Crown Victoria#Fuel tank safety concerns|Ford Crown Victoria]], [[Lincoln Town Car#Fuel tank safety concerns|Lincoln Town Car]], and [[Mercury Grand Marquis#Fuel tank safety concerns|Mercury Grand Marquis]]) are notorious for having the fuel tank behind the rear axle. Since 1980 new Ford models corrected this problem and had the fuel tank in front of the rear axle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,924408-5,00.html |journal=Time |title=Detroit's Uphill Battle |date=8 September 1980 |first1=Alexander |last1=Taylor |first2=Christopher |last2=Redman |first3=Barrett |last3=Seaman |format=fee required |accessdate=24 December 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107130925/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,924408-5,00.html |archivedate=7 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[General Motors]] [[Chevrolet C/K#Sidesaddle Fuel Tanks|1973-1987 C/K pickup trucks have the fuel tank located outside the frame]]. According to the [[Center for Auto Safety]] this creates a fire hazard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autosafety.org/tort-liability-dealers-selling-1973-1987-gm-pickups |title=Tort Liability of Dealers Selling 1973-1987 GM Pickups |publisher=The Center for Auto Safety |date=1993-10-18 |accessdate=24 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In automotive applications, improper placement of the fuel tank has led to increased probability of fire in collisions. Circa 1990, [[General Motors]] faced over a hundred [[product liability]] lawsuits related to fires allegedly caused by GM's decision to place the fuel tanks in its [[pickup truck]]s outside the protection of the vehicle's frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rolanddarby.com/br_sidesaddle.html |title=The Mosely vs GM "Side-Saddle Fuel Tank" Case |publisher=Law Office of Roland B.

Ford's [[Ford Pinto|Pinto]] also sparked controversy for putting the fuel tank in a poorly reinforced area which can cause deadly fires and explosions if the car got into a rear-end collision, costing Ford [[United States dollar|US$]]125 million.

Likewise for safety reasons, the filler could no longer be in the middle back of the car in the crumple zone and thus had to be on the side of the car.  Which side is a series of trade-offs:  driver's side is easier to access, and mechanically simpler for gas cap locks; passenger side is safer (away from passing traffic in roadside fill-ups).  Asymmetric sliding doors may also dictate placement and some minivan doors will collide with a fillup in progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Torchinsky|first1=Jason|title=Why Some Cars Have Gas Tank Fillers On The Left Or The Right|url=http://jalopnik.com/why-some-cars-have-gas-tank-fillers-on-the-left-or-the-1792790492|accessdate=28 February 2017|work=Jalopnik|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]|date=27 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227221655/http://jalopnik.com/why-some-cars-have-gas-tank-fillers-on-the-left-or-the-1792790492|archivedate=27 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aircraft==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner]] --&gt;
{{see also|Aircraft fuel tanks|Drop tank}}

[[File:Jet-liner's main fuel tanks.PNG|thumb|Layout of a modern airliner's main fuel tanks]]

Aircraft typically use three types of fuel tanks: integral, rigid removable, and bladder.

* Integral tanks are areas inside the aircraft structure that have been sealed to allow fuel storage. An example of this type is the "[[wet wing]]" commonly used in larger aircraft. Since these tanks are part of the aircraft structure, they cannot be removed for service or inspection. Inspection panels must be provided to allow internal inspection, repair, and overall servicing of the tank. Most large transport aircraft use this system, storing fuel in the wings, belly, and sometimes tail of the airplane.
* Rigid removable tanks are installed in a compartment designed to accommodate the tank. They are typically of metal construction, and may be removed for inspection, replacement, or repair. The aircraft does not rely on the tank for structural integrity. These tanks are commonly found in smaller general aviation aircraft, such as the [[Cessna 172]].
* Bladder tanks, or fuel cells,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ffcfuelcells.com/aircraftfuelcells1.asp |title= Aircraft Fuel Cells |accessdate= 2014-11-05 |publisher= Floats and Fuel Cells, Inc. (FFC) |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141108080706/http://ffcfuelcells.com/aircraftfuelcells1.asp |archivedate= 8 November 2014 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; are reinforced rubberized bags installed in a section of aircraft structure designed to accommodate the weight of the fuel. The bladder is rolled up and installed into the compartment through the fuel filler neck or access panel, and is secured by means of metal buttons or snaps inside the compartment. Many high-performance light aircraft, [[helicopter]]s and some smaller turboprops use bladder tanks. One major down-side to this type of tank is the tendency for materials to [[Work hardening|work harden]] through extensive use making them [[brittleness|brittle]] causing cracks.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} One major plus side is the ability to use as much of the aircraft as possible to store fuel.
* Combat aircraft and helicopters generally use [[self-sealing fuel tank]]s.

Fuel tanks have been implicated in [[Aviation accidents and incidents|aviation disasters]], being the cause of the accident or worsening it (fuel tank [[explosion]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trantololaw.com/airplane_accidents.html |title=Connecticut Personal Injury Attorney |publisher=Trantolo Law |date= |accessdate=24 December 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509064857/http://www.trantololaw.com/airplane_accidents.html |archivedate=9 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2012}} For example:

* The official "probable cause" for the explosion and subsequent crash of [[TWA Flight 800]] is that an explosive fuel/air mixture existed in one of the aircraft's fuel tanks. Faulty wiring then provided an ignition source within the tank, destroying the airliner. While the accuracy of the official findings is still questioned in this case, similar explosions have occurred in other aircraft. It is possible to reduce the chance of fuel tank explosions by a [[Inerting system|fuel tank inerting system]] or [[fire-fighting foam]] in the tanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fire.tc.faa.gov/pdf/EXECSUM.pdf |title=Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee - Fuel tank harmonization working group final report |publisher=AIA, AECMA, ATA, ALPA, IATA, FAA, JAA, GAMA, API |date=July 1998 |accessdate=24 December 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130220220834/http://www.fire.tc.faa.gov/pdf/EXECSUM.pdf |archivedate=20 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Burning fuel can explode or set fire to the same airplane or adjacent objects and people.  In the [[1960 Munich Convair 340 crash]], a transport crashed into a major street.  Burning fuel set fire to a tramcar. All 20 people aboard the plane and 32 passengers of the tram died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emergency-management.net/airpl_acc60-89.htm |title=The Leading Emergency Management Site on the Net |publisher=emergency-management.net |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610114412/http://www.emergency-management.net/airpl_acc60-89.htm |archivedate=10 June 2010 |accessdate=24 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some areas, an aircraft's fuel tank is also referred to as an ''aircraft fuel cell''.

== Water supply ==
Water supply systems can have primary or backup power supplied by diesel-fueled generators fed by a small "day tank" and a much larger bulk storage fuel tank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Maciag |first=Mike |title=Backup Facility to Power Water Works During Outages |newspaper=Erie Times-News |date=7 June 2007 |page=5B |quote=the Erie Water Works is due to have a 20,000-gallon bulk storage tank and a 5,000-gallon day tank installed to support two diesel-fueled generators serving as backups to the Sommerheim Water Treatment Plant in Erie, Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan, Section 8, pp 8-3, 8-4, says that small- and medium-sized pumping stations are to be equipped with fuel storage tanks capable of storing seven days capacity, plus "floor-mounted packaged system day tanks"{{cite web |url=http://www.sfwmd.gov/ce/CERP-Design-Manuals/SE544A~1.PDF |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927201407/http://www.sfwmd.gov/ce/CERP-Design-Manuals/SE544A~1.PDF |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety ==
Proper design and construction of a fuel tank play a major role in the safety of the system of which the tank is a part.  In most cases intact fuel tanks are very safe, as the tank is full of fuel vapour/air mixture that is well above the [[flammability limit]]s, and thus cannot burn even if an ignition source were present (which is rare).

Bunded oil tanks are used for safely storing domestic heating oil and other hazardous materials.  [[Bunding]] is often required by insurance companies, rather than single skinned oil storage tanks.

Several systems, such as [[BattleJacket]] and rubber bladders, have been developed and deployed for use in protecting (from explosion caused by enemy fire) the fuel tanks of military vehicles in conflict zones.&lt;ref&gt;http://ww3.economist.com/news/technology-quarterly/21584446-fire-suppression-engineers-are-finding-ways-reduce-risk-fuel-tanks-will Monitor: Bang but no boom&lt;/ref&gt;

The characterization  '''gas collecting tube''' describes  an [[rectangle|oblong]] gas-tight container with one [[valve]] at either end. Usually such a container has a [[gauge (engineering)|gauge]]d [[volume]], has a cylindrical [[shape]] and is made of [[glass]]. Gas collecting tubes are used for science-related purposes; for taking samples of gases.

'''Versions'''
* Gas collecting tubes, made of glass, with 2 olives
* as above, but with 2 [[stopcock]]s with glass plugs, without septum

''Capacity'' of gas collecting tubes 150, 250, 350, 500 and 1.000 ml

==Measurement of the Mass Density of a Gas - Aspirator Method &lt;ref&gt;Physikalische Chemie, Kaiser, Hennig, Verlag Dr. Max Gehlen, Bad Homburg, 1983, Seite 140 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;==
The [[mass density]] of a [[gas]] can be measured by using a gas collecting tube, an [[analytical balance]]  and an [[Aspirator (pump)|aspirator]].  The mass and volume of a displaced amount of gas are determined: At atmospheric pressure &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, the gas collecting tube is filled with the gas to be investigated and the overall mass  &lt;math&gt;m_{full}&lt;/math&gt; is measured. Then the aspirator sucks out much of  the gas yielding a second overall mass &lt;math&gt;m_{sucked}&lt;/math&gt; measurement. (The difference of masses represents the mass (&lt;math&gt;m=m_{full}-m_{sucked}&lt;/math&gt;) of the extracted amount of gas.) Finally, the nearly evacuated gas collecting tube is allowed to suck in an outgassed liquid, usually previously heated water, which is offered under atmospheric pressure &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. The gas collecting tube is weighed for a third and last time containing the liquid yielding the value &lt;math&gt;m_{containing liquid}&lt;/math&gt;. (The difference of masses of the nearly evacuated tube and the liquid-containing tube gives the mass (&lt;math&gt;m_{liquid}=m_{containing liquid}-m_{sucked}&lt;/math&gt;) of the sucked-in  liquid, that took the place of the extracted amount of gas.) The given mass-density &lt;math&gt;\rho_{liquid}&lt;/math&gt; of the liquid permits to calculate the displaced volume (&lt;math&gt;V=m_{liquid}/\rho_{liquid}&lt;/math&gt;). Thus giving mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and volume &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; of the extracted amount of gas, consequently accessing its [[mass density]] (&lt;math&gt;\rho=\frac{m}{V}&lt;/math&gt;) under atmospheric pressure

== Measurement of the Mass Density of a Gas - Two Fluid Method ==
The [[mass density]] of a [[fluid]] can be measured by using a gas collecting tube, an [[analytical balance]] and two other fluids of known mass densities, preferably a gas and a liquid (with mass densities &lt;math&gt;\rho_{gas}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\rho_{liquid}&lt;/math&gt;). Overview: First, mass measurements get the volume &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and the evacuated mass &lt;math&gt;m_{evactube}&lt;/math&gt; of  the gas collecting tube; secondly, these two are used to measure and calculate the mass-density &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; of the investigated fluid.

Fill the gas collecting tube with one of those fluids of given mass density and measure the overall mass, do the same with the second one giving the two mass values &lt;math&gt;m_{fullgas}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;m_{fullliquid}&lt;/math&gt;. Consequently for those two fluids, the definition of [[mass density]] can be rewritten:
:&lt;math&gt;\rho_{gas}=\frac{m_{fullgas}-m_{evactube}}{V}\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\rho_{liquid}=\frac{m_{fullliquid}-m_{evactube}}{V}&lt;/math&gt;
These two equations with two unknowns &lt;math&gt;m_{evactube}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; can be solved by using elementary algebra:
:&lt;math&gt;V=\frac{m_{fullliquid}-m_{fullgas}}{\rho_{liquid}-\rho_{gas}}\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;m_{evactube}=\frac{\rho_{gas}\cdot m_{fullliquid}-\rho_{liquid} \cdot m_{fullgas}}{\rho_{liquid}-\rho_{gas}}&lt;/math&gt;
(The relative error of the result significantly depends on the relative proportions of the given mass densities and the measured masses.)

Now fill the gas collecting tube with the fluid to be investigated. Measure the overall mass &lt;math&gt;m_{full}&lt;/math&gt; to calculate the mass of the fluid inside the tube &lt;math&gt;m=m_{full}-m_{evactube}&lt;/math&gt; yielding the desired mass density &lt;math&gt;\rho=\frac{m}{V}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Molar Mass from the Mass Density of a Gas==
If the gas is a pure gaseous [[chemical substance]] (and not a mixture), with the mass density &lt;math&gt;\rho=\frac{m}{V}&lt;/math&gt;,  then using the [[ideal gas law]] permits to calculate the [[molar mass]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; of the gaseous chemical substance: &lt;math&gt;M = \frac{ m \cdot R \cdot T }{ p \cdot V}\,&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; represents the [[universal gas constant]], &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; the [[absolute temperature]] at which the measurements took place)

[[File:123Net Data Center (DC2).jpg|325px|thumb|right|A picture of a 123Net Datacenter walkway in Southfield, MI]]
A '''green data center''', or [[sustainability|sustainable]] [[data center]], is a type of server facility that utilizes [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] technologies. These data centers do not contain obsolete systems such as inactive or underused servers, and instead take advantage of newer and more efficient technologies.

With the exponential growth and usage of the [[internet]], power consummation in data centers has increased significantly. Due to the resulting environmental impact, rise in public awareness, higher cost of energy and legislative action, an increasing pressure has been placed on companies to follow a [[Environmental law|green policy]]. For these reasons, the creation of sustainable data centers has become essential in both an environmental and business sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.datacenterdynamics.com/content-tracks/design-build/sustainable-data-centers-5-key-questions/97339.fullarticle|title=Sustainable data centers: 5 key questions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Energy use in Green Data Centers ==
In recent years, the use of [[supercomputer|high-performance computing]] techniques has increased, trading off energy consumption for obtaining increased performances. Industry estimates suggest that the data center sector is consuming around 3-5% of the world’s global energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.media.bitpipe.com/io_10x/io_102267/item_1306461/Focus_Green_datacentre.pdf |title=Focus Green datacenter |website=docs.media.bitpipe.com |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the latest AFCOM State of the Data Center survey, 70% of data center providers indicated that the power density (per rack) has significantly increased over 2013. That means that managers have been forced to find new ways to power their data centers, using [[renewable energy]] sources such as solar, geo-thermal, and wind. More efficient technologies were developed in order to decrease the power consumption in data centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.afcom.com/|title=AFCOM Home|first=Advanced Solutions International,|last=Inc.|website=www.afcom.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Metrics ==
There are several metrics invented to measure power efficiency of data centers. The [[power usage effectiveness]] (PUE) and Carbon Usage Effectiveness (CUE) are two highly used metrics created by [[The Green Grid]] (TGG), a global consortium to advancing energy efficiency in data centers.

=== Power Usage Effectivness (PUE) ===
PUE was invented in 2007 and proposed new guidelines to measure energy usage in data centers.

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{PUE}  =  {\mbox{Total Facility Power} \over \mbox{IT Equipment Power}} &lt;/math&gt;

This ratio tells us basically how much extra energy a data center needs to maintain the IT equipment for every watt delivered to IT equipment. The best PUE a data center can have is 1 which is the ideal situation with zero extra energy usage.
After the introduction of PUE it is found in various studies that average PUE for the industry was between 2.5 and 3. In more recent studies it is observed that average PUE values fell to around 1.7 by using this framework. As a result, PUE started the shift of the data center industry towards energy efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rehva.eu/publications-and-resources/rehva-journal/2017/012017/analysis-of-performance-metrics-for-data-center-efficiency-should-the-power-utilization-effectiveness-pue-still-be-used-as-the-main-indicator-part-1.html|title=Analysis of performance metrics for data center efficiency – should the Power Utilization Effectiveness PUE still be used as the main indicator? (Part 1): REHVA|website=www.rehva.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| Very Efficient || Efficient || Average || Inefficient || Very Inefficient
|}

Until now, the PUE is the most used metric for data centers to measure the energy efficiency. However, the reliability of PUE is still discussed by some sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.greenqloud.com/greenpowerusageeffectiveness-gpue/|title=Green Power Usage Effectiveness - GPUE|date=7 March 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anaeko.com/content/are-you-measuring-your-green-kpis-like-power-usage-effectiveness-pue-cooling-power-lighting-it-it/|title=Are you Measuring your Green KPI’s like Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) = Cooling + Power + Lighting + IT/ IT - Anaeko|date=13 May 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The main reason of this discussion is that the PUE can change significantly depending on the measurement time and time period.

=== Carbon Usage Effectiveness (CUE) ===
Carbon usage effectiveness (CUE) is another metric in order to measure the energy usage and sustainability. It is calculated by the following formula&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tmp2014.airatwork.com/wp-content/uploads/The-Green-Grid-White-Paper-32-CUE-Usage-Guidelines.pdf |title=White paper guidelines |website=tmp2014.airatwork.com |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{CUE}  =  \frac{Total \rm{CO_2} Emissions Caused}{IT Equipment Power} &lt;/math&gt;

Another way to express this formula is the product of the Carbon Dioxide Emission Factor (CEF) with the PUE, where CEF is the kg of &lt;chem&gt;CO2&lt;/chem&gt; produced for each kilowatt-hour of electricity:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{CUE}  =  \frac{\rm{CO_2} emitted (kg\rm{CO_2}eq)}{unit of energy (kWh)}&lt;/math&gt; × &lt;math&gt; \frac{Total Facility Power}{IT Equipment Power}&lt;/math&gt;

CUE takes into account the carbon emission, so in some ways it may be a more accurate representation of the sustainability of a data center compared to PUE since some data centers can have low PUE scores but still have high carbon emission. Used with PUE, these metrics allow us to examine the energy efficiency in more detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.netmagicsolutions.com/blog/carbon-usage-effectiveness-cue-a-new-sustainability-metric|title=Carbon Usage Effectiveness (CUE) ? a new sustainability metric - Netmagic|website=www.netmagicsolutions.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Certification ==
[[File:LEED platinum grey.jpg|100px|thumb|right|LEED Platinum Certification]] Data centers can be certified as green data centers. One of the popular certificats is the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED), which is a green rating system for buildings. It is developed by US Green Building Council and has a set of rating systems for different categories. Depending on ratings data centers can get a Silver, Gold or Platinum certification. The Platinum certification is given to data centers with the highest level of environmentally responsible construction with efficient use of resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lifelinedatacenters.com/colocation/leed-certification-data-centers/|title=What is LEED Certification for Data Centers? - Lifeline Data Centers|date=23 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Energy Star logo.svg|70px|thumb|left|Energy Star]]
Data centers can be also certified by [[Energy Star]] which is a part of an initiative by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy called the National Data Center Energy Efficiency Information Program. This program certifies buildings and consumer products for their energy efficiency. Only data centers that are in the top 25% energy performance range can receive an Energy Star certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2012/08/27/what-is-energy-star-for-data-centers|title=Energy star certification|publisher=datacenterknowledge.com|accessdate=September 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Green Data Center Technologies ==
There are several technologies to increase the efficiency and decrease the energy consumption in data centers.

=== Low power servers ===
[[File:IBMPortableModularDataCenter.jpg|300px|thumb|right|IBM Modular Data Center]]
Low power servers are servers which are more energy efficient than current servers used in data centers. These servers use the technology of smartphone computing which tries to balance performance with energy consumption. The first low power servers were launched in 2012 by big IT providers like [[Dell]] and [[hewlett-packard|HP]]. When they are used correct, they can be much more efficient than current servers. The low power servers can have a big impact on the data centers because they can decrease the power consumption and capital and operating costs of cooling facilities.&lt;ref name="computerweekly.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Top-technologies-that-can-make-your-datacentre-green#Low-powerservers|title=Top technologies that can make your datacentre green|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modular data centers ===
A [[modular data center]] is a portable data center which can be placed anywhere where data capacity is needed. In comparison to traditional data centers they are designed for rapid deployment, energy efficiency and high density. Due to the fact that these data centers are ready-made data center-in-a-box, this technology became very popular. For example, the modular data center “HP EcoPod” supports more than 4.000 data centers with a PUE rating of 1.05 in combination with free air cooling.&lt;ref name="computerweekly.com"/&gt;

=== Free air cooling ===
[[File:Cold Aisle Containment.svg|300px|thumb|right|Schematic drawing of some server racks with and without cold aisle containment
(1) circulating air cooling device
(2) cold aisle
(3) server racks
(4) warm aisle
(5) barrier between cold and warm aisle
blue lines: flow of cold air
red lines: flow of warm air]]
Free air cooling systems uses outdoor air instead of using traditional data center [[hvac|Computer Room Air Conditioner]] (CRAC) units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.computerweekly.com/tip/Free-air-cooling-using-natural-cooling-in-the-data-centre|title=Free-air cooling – using natural cooling in the data centre|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outdoor air still needs to be filtered and moisturized, however, with this method much less energy is required to cool the data center. Outdoor air temperature is an important issue here and the location of the data center plays a critical role to implement this [[technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stulz.de/en/company/media/whitepapers/|title=Whitepapers|website=www.stulz.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hot and cold aisle containment ===
In this method, the rows of the racks are aligned in a way that the back of the [[server (computing)|server]]s are facing each other. The created aisles are enclosed in order to capture the air. In hot aisle containment, the heat produced by the servers is trapped inside and pumped to the cooling units. In contrary in cold aisle containment, cold air is pumped to the enclosed aisles whereas the rest of the data center has higher degrees of heat. Both of these containment methods are more effective compared to traditional cooling technologies and can help to reduce the energy consumption and its impact. It is also shown that although it may be harder to implement, hot aisle containments are more effective compared to cold aisle containments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facilitiesnet.com/whitepapers/pdfs/APC_011112.pdf |title=Impact of Hot and Cold Aisle Containment on Data Center Temperature and Efficiency |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.greenhousedata.com/blog/think-inside-the-box-implement-containment-for-energy-savings|title=Think Inside the Box &amp; Implement Containment for Energy Savings|website=www.greenhousedata.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reusing waste heat ===
Data centers use electric power and in return the release more than 98% of this electricity as [[heat]] energy. The main idea in this case is that produced waste heat can be actively reused. Thus, a data center becomes a [[district heating|district energy system]], creating a closed-loop system that has no waste.
There are already some examples of data centers around the world which are turning waste heat into heat energy that can be used, such as:
* [[IBM]] Reusing Data Center in Switzerland, in which the heat is used to warm a local swimming pool
* In Finland, [[Yandex]] and Academica data centers that, instead of vented heat to the atmosphere, are replacing the heat energy used by 500-1000 homes with data center energy.
* [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] reused the heat of a nearby data center for the biosphere project_t in Seattle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2016/05/10/how-to-reuse-waste-heat-from-data-centers-intelligently|title=How to Reuse Waste Heat from Data Centers Intelligently|date=10 May 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ultrasonic humidification ===
[[File:Facebook Data Center.jpg|300px|thumb|right|FaceBook's new custom-built Data Center based in Prineville, Oregon]]
A certain level of [[humidity]] is necessary for data centers to work efficiently and prevent damages to devices and servers. There are several ways to produce vapor and ensure humidity. Ultrasonic humidification uses [[ultrasound]] frequency to create vapor. This system uses %90 less energy compared to conventional methods (such as resistance steam humidifiers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.energystar.gov/sites/default/files/asset/document/Energy_Star_fact_sheet.pdf |title=Fact sheet |website=www.energystar.gov |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evaporative cooling ===
This method uses the idea of heat decreasing by [[evaporation]] of water. Two main methods are used in order to realize this idea; usage of evaporation pads and high pressure spray systems. In evaporation pads, air is drawn through pads, which makes water evaporate and air cool. The second most used technique, High pressure spray systems, needs larger areas and consumes more energy because of the usage of pumps. Evaporative cooling is dependent on the geographical location and the season because they affect the moisture level in the air. In general, compared to traditional mechanical cooling systems, evaporative cooling uses significantly less electric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.greenhousedata.com/blog/how-free-is-free-evaporative-cooling-in-the-data-center|title=How Free is Evaporative Cooling in the Data Center|website=www.greenhousedata.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''i-net Clear Reports''' (formerly known as i-net Crystal-Clear) is a Java-based cross-platform reporting application providing a [[report]] designer and a server component to create reports in numerous output formats like PDF, HTML, PS, RTF, XLS, TXT, CSV, SVG, XML, as well as being viewable in a Java applet or Swing component.&lt;ref name="Freshmeat"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://freshmeat.net/projects/crystalclear |title = i-net Clear Reports / freshmeat.net |date = May 15, 2009 |accessdate = 2009-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Application programmers can integrate i-net Clear Reports using the public [[API]] which spans over 200 classes.&lt;ref name="API"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inetsoftware.de/documentation/clear-reports/online-help/programming/apispec/index.html |title = i-net Clear Reports API |date = May 17, 2011 |accessdate = 2011-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with release 11.0 i-net Clear Reports also supports the [[.NET Framework|.NET]] programming language and offers a public API for further integration in other products.

==History==
in Version 11.0 i-net Crystal-Clear was renamed to i-net Clear Reports. At this time it also gained .NET integration as a major feature.

i-net Crystal-Clear was primarily designed to read [[Crystal Reports]] templates. It had to be capable of reading the RPT report format and producing a reasonable output. For exporting and saving reasons a new file format had to be created later on, enabling Crystal-Clear to save the API results back and make them editable by a designer.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inetsoftware.de/products/clear-reports/developement-timeline |title = Development Timeline |date = March 17, 2011 |accessdate = 2011-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 the first version of i-net DesignerXML, the report designer, was written using Java Swing. The editing concept is slightly different from some other designers, using a band-oriented report template format, meaning that reports are designed based on rows of data.

The development efforts has changed in more recent years to a full reporting platform approach, rather than the developer-only, framework-based one.

True to its roots, i-net Crystal-Clear still has the ability to read and execute Crystal Reports report templates up until the latest versions of Crystal Reports.

Unlike Crystal Reports, however, the i-net Crystal-Clear report file format has always been an open format. Until version 9.0 it was an XML format. Since version 9, the report file format is in a [[ZIP (file format)|zip]]-based format similar to [[OpenDocument]].

==Flexibility==

Being a Java application, i-net Clear Reports has the ability to run on a variety of platforms and environments. There is virtually no restriction concerning data sources that can be used, as long as there is a [[JDBC]] driver available for accessing the data. For non-JDBC data sources, there are how-to's to write simple mini-drivers. With the new .NET API it got even more flexible and allows integration into .NET based applications.

i-net Clear Reports comes as a standalone server as well as a [[servlet]] which can be run on any [[Java EE]] application server such as [[Apache Tomcat|Tomcat]], [[Jetty]], [[Internet Information Services|IIS]], or [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] (via [[PHP]]).

Features can be added using the public [[API]], or by adding custom [[JavaBeans]] which can be added to reports. User defined functions (UDF) extend the formula features of the embedded formula calculation routines.

'''Ikranite''' is a member of the [[eudialyte group]], named after the Shubinov Institute of Crystallography of the Russian Academy of Sciences. It is a [[cyclosilicate]] mineral that shows trigonal symmetry with the space group ''R''3''m'', and is often seen with a pseudo-hexagonal habit.&lt;ref name=Mindat&gt;[http://www.mindat.org/min-25686.html Ikranite on Mindat.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Ikranite appears as translucent and ranges in color from yellow to a brownish yellow. This mineral ranks a 5 on [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs Scale of Hardness]], though it is considered brittle, exhibiting conchoidal fracture when broken.&lt;ref name=Webmin&gt;[http://webmineral.com/data/Ikranite.shtml#.VluajHarTIU Ikranite on Webmineral]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The eudialyte group ==
The [[eudialyte group]] currently consists of 27 known minerals (see below), all considered rare, with the exception of eudialyte. The list below also includes one of around six unnamed ("UM") species listed by Mindat.&lt;ref&gt;Mindat, http://www.mindat.org&lt;/ref&gt; This group is growing exponentially, with 17 members having been written about since 2000, and the chemical possibility of several thousand species that have yet to be discovered. Eudialyte group members are typically found as small crystals which have a complex crystal structure that is unique in that it consists of both 3- and 9-member SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedra rings.&lt;ref name="Eudialytes"&gt;{{cite journal|title = Collector's Guide to the Eudialyte Group|journal = Rocks and Minerals Magazine|date = 2014|volume = 89|issue = May/June|pages = 250–257|last = Lauf|first = Robert J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ikranite separates itself from the other members of this group through both its physical and compositional properties. The most prominent of these characteristics is the absence of sodium in its structure, along with the replacement of divalent iron with the trivalent form. This replacement also causes the characteristic color change from the reddish color seen in eudialyte to the yellow brown of ikranite, which can be further examined in its IR spectrum.&lt;ref name=Rast/&gt;

== Occurrence ==
Ikranite was first discovered on Mount Karnasurt (Kola Peninsula) in an agpaitic [[pegmatite]], in the form of 1–2&amp;nbsp;cm grains. It is commonly associated with [[microcline]], [[nepheline]], [[lorenzenite]], [[murmanite]], [[lamprophyllite]], and [[arfvedsonite]]. [[Tetranatrolite]], and [[halloysite]] can also be found with it, though they occur at a later stage.&lt;ref name=Rast&gt;{{cite journal|author1=R.K. Rastsvetaeva|author2=N.V.

== Crystal Structure ==
[[File:Ikranite Structure.png|thumbnail|General Ikranite unit cell projected onto the (001) plane.]]
The crystal structure of ikranite can be described as a framework of three- and nine- member SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedra rings, connected by Ca six-membered rings and Zn (Ti, or Nb) octahedra. Layers are constructed along the c axis as Si-Zr-Si-Ca. This repetition generates 12 layers, equal to ~30Å in size.&lt;ref name=Rast/&gt;

Differing types cations, anions, anionic groups, and water molecules fill any pockets within the framework. A defining feature is the location of the M(3) and M(4) vacancies in the nine-membered rings. These cavities may be occupied with Si in the M(3b) location, Zr in the M(4a), and Zr, Nb, or Ti in the (M4b), though the probability of occupancy is low. The M(2a) and M(2b) locations are also uniquely occupied in ikranite. The M(2a) vacancy is seen occupied by Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; octahedra. Typically holding a five-membered polyhedra with Fe, the M(2b) position is occupied by Na cations. Ikranite also holds a significant amount of water in the space between the rings where an Na molecule is usually found. A distinctive feature is the oxonium groups that can also be found occupying Na sites.&lt;ref name=Rast/&gt;

Ikranite's general formula thus becomes: (Na,H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;(Ca,Mn,REE)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;Zr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;([ ],Zr)([ ],Si)Si&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;66&lt;/sub&gt;(O,OH)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2-3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;ref name=Rast/&gt;

'''Image Share''' is a service for sharing images between users during a [[mobile phone]] call. It has been specified for use in a [[3GPP]]-compliant [[Mobile network|cellular network]] by the [[GSM Association]] in the PRD IR.79 Image Share Interoperability Specification.[http://www.gsmworld.com/documents/index.shtml]

According to the specification, "The terminal interoperable Image Share service allows users to share Images between them over PS connection with ongoing CS call, thus enhancing and enriching end-users voice communication." 

An Image Share session begins by end-users setting up a normal [[Circuit switching|circuit switched]] (CS) voice call. After the voice call is set up, terminals perform a registration to an [[IP Multimedia Subsystem|IMS core system]] with a [[Packet switching|packet switched]] (PS) connection. Then based on successful capability negotiation between the terminals, the end-user will be presented with an option in terminal [[User interface|UI]] offering the possibility of sharing one or several images. If this is selected, then these images are transferred between the Image Share software clients located in the mobile phones using the PS connection and the recipient is able to see the images. During this process the normal CS voice session has been ongoing continuously.   

Image Share can be seen as a kind of spin-off from the [[Video share|Video Share]] mobile phone service. Video Share is commercially launched for example by [[AT&amp;T]] in USA, but Image Share is not yet available from any mobile operator/service provider.

* [[Interoperability|Interoperable]] multi-vendor compliant service, i.e. Image Share works across different mobile phones from various vendors (as long as they have the necessary software client installed) 
* [[IP Multimedia Subsystem|IMS service]], i.e. 3GPP compliant IMS core system required for the service provider/operator offering Image Share  
* CSI (CS and IMS combinational) service compliant to 3GPP specifications TS 22.279, TS 23.279 and TS 24.279, i.e. CS voice call set up required prior to sharing the images 
* [[Session Initiation Protocol|SIP]] used for signaling via IMS, i.e. registration for the service is performed using the capabilities offered by IMS platform with SIP protocol
* MSRP (Message Session Relay Protocol, RFC 4975) used for transporting media between the mobile phones
* IETF File transfer mechanisms [http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-mmusic-file-transfer-mech-06.txt] utilized for negotiating shared images between offerer and answerer via SIP/SDP offer/answer model
* Capability query performed using SIP OPTIONS method between the mobile phoness to find out whether the recipient is Image Share capable 
* [[Peer-to-peer]] service, i.e. no server required in the network for sharing the images
* Both live and pre-stored images can be shared between the participating mobile phones
* Requires [[3G]] or [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution|EDGE]] DTM (Dual Transfer Mode) mobile network

==Usage==
According to GSMA press release [http://www.gsmworld.com/news/press_2007/press07_39.shtml] interoperability between different Image Share clients was successfully tested in a multi-vendor trial in May 2007, including interworking between multiple networks.  

No mobile operator has launched Image Share so far (as of March 2008).

The '''Joint Tactical Ground Station''' ('''JTAGS''') is the United States Army's element to [[United States Strategic Command]]'s Theater Event System (TES). TES provides an integrated, in-theater, 24-hour overhead non-imaging infrared detection capability for processing and disseminating missile early warning, alerting, and cueing information data to combatant commanders and missile defense assets through the use of stereo processing of the Defense Support Program (DSP) satellite data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afspc.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-071119-017.pdf High Frontier Journal, Vol 4, No. 1: "The Army's Space Cadre"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930070404/http://www.afspc.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-071119-017.pdf |date=30 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Joint Tactical Ground Station (JTAGS) is the Army’s primary system that provides space based integrated, in-theater missile warning. It provides continuous
processing of overhead non-imaging infrared (ONIR) data that is directly down linked from the Defense Support Program (DSP) satellite constellation. This data is
used to provide near real-time dissemination of warning, alerting and cueing information, to combatant commanders (CCDRs) and ballistic missile defense
systems (BMDS), on ballistic missile threats for the protection of military assets, civilian populations, and geopolitical centers. This dissemination is accomplished by
using existing communication networks such as the Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS) and Link 16.&lt;ref&gt;FM 3-14.5 Joint Tactical Ground Station (JTAGS) Operations&lt;/ref&gt;

== JTAGS Mission ==

"(U) Receive and process '''in-theater, direct down-linked''' data from OPIR (Overhead Persistent Infrared) Sensors in order to disseminate warning, alerting and cueing information on tactical ballistic missiles and other events of interest throughout the theater using existing communication networks."&lt;ref&gt;1st Space Company (JTAGS) approved mission statement&lt;/ref&gt;

== JTAGS Organization ==
The Joint Tactical Ground Station Theater Missile Warning system is organized under the 1st Space Company (JTAGS), with 4 forward-stationed Detachments in Europe, CENTCOM, Korea, and Japan.  The 1st Space Company falls under the 1st Space Battalion, under the 1st Space Brigade, part of the US Army Space and Missile Defense Command&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Army Space and Missile Defense Command]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=September 2015}}

'''Kepone''', also known as '''chlordecone''', is an [[organochlorine compound]] and a colourless solid. This compound is an obsolete [[insecticide]] related to [[Mirex]] and [[DDT]]. Its use was so disastrous that it is now prohibited in the western world, but only after many millions of kilograms had been produced.&lt;ref name=Ullmann2&gt;Robert L. Metcalf "Insect Control" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'' Wiley-VCH, Wienheim, 2002. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a14_263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kepone is a known [[persistent organic pollutant]] (POP), classified among the "dirty dozen" and banned globally by the [[Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants]] as of 2011.

Workers with repeated exposure suffer severe convulsions resulting from degradation of the synaptic junctions.&lt;ref name=Ullmann2/&gt;

Kepone has been found to act as an [[agonist]] of the [[GPER]] (GPR30).&lt;ref name="ProssnitzBarton2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prossnitz|first1=Eric R.|last2=Barton|first2=Matthias|title=Estrogen biology: New insights into GPER function and clinical opportunities|journal=Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology|volume=389|issue=1–2|year=2014|pages=71–83|issn=0303-7207|doi=10.1016/j.mce.2014.02.002|pmid=24530924|pmc=4040308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In the US, kepone was produced by [[Allied Signal Company]] and LifeSciences Product Company in [[Hopewell, Virginia]]. The improper handling and dumping of the substance into the nearby [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] (U.S.) in the 1960s and 1970s drew national attention to its toxic effects on humans and wildlife. The product is similar to DDT and is a degradation product of [[Mirex]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann2/&gt; The history of Kepone incidents are reviewed in ''Who's Poisoning America?: Corporate Polluters and Their Victims in the Chemical Age'' (1982). In 2009, Kepone was included in the [[Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants|Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants]], which bans its production and use worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Stockholm Convention. Listing of POPs in the Stockholm Convention: Annex A (Elimination). 2011; Available from: http://chm.pops.int/Convention/The%20POPs/tabid/673/language/fr-CH/Default.aspx.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Case studies===

====James River estuary====
Due to the pollution risks, many businesses and restaurants along the river suffered economic losses. In 1975 Governor [[Mills Godwin Jr.]] shut down the James River to fishing for 100 miles, from [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] to the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. This ban remained in effect for 13 years, until efforts to clean up the river began to show results.&lt;ref name="Cooksey"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140520042033/http://www.richmondmagazine.com/articles/whats-in-the-water-11-09-2008.html Jack Cooksey, "What's in the Water?"], ''Richmond Magazine'', June 2007, accessed 13 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

====French Antilles====
The French island of [[Martinique]] is heavily contaminated with kepone,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Durimel A.

They had argued that no alternative pesticide was available, which has since been disputed. Similarly, the nearby island of [[Guadeloupe]] is also contaminated, but to a lesser extent. Since 2003, local authorities have restricted cultivation of crops because the [[soil contamination|soil has been seriously contaminated]] by kepone. Guadeloupe has one of the highest [[prostate cancer]] diagnosis rates in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=France: Island Paradise With Contaminated Drinking Water |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/episode/0,,5542822,00.html |work=European Journal |publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]] |date=26 May 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527120102/http://www.dw-world.de/dw/episode/0,,5542822,00.html |archivedate=2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
* [[Kepone (band)|Kepone]] was the name of an American indie rock band from [[Richmond, Virginia]] formed in 1991.
* The [[Dead Kennedys]] recorded a song named "Kepone Factory", a satire of the controversy surrounding Allied Signal and their negligence regarding employee safety, for their 1981 album ''[[In God We Trust, Inc.]]''. Written in 1978, the song was originally titled "Kepone Kids".

==Synthesis==
Kepone is made by dimerizing [[hexachlorocyclopentadiene]] and hydrolyzing to a ketone.&lt;ref&gt;Survey of Industrial Chemistry by

'''Knowland''' is a web-based [[software company]] that provides [[business development]] products and services to the [[hospitality industry]].

==History==
Knowland traces its roots back to a small [[software engineering]] firm. This firm spent months developing an entirely new kind of hotel readerboard service, heavily reliant on web technology, for a client in the industry. When the client backed out, Knowland’s founders recognized the hospitality industry’s need for a higher standard of market intelligence. They decided to start their own hospitality [[field research]] service, and by the fall of 2004 an online readerboard service was launched.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Knowland signed its first client, the [[Holiday Inn]] in [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington, Va.]], in September 2004.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/29/AR2010082902450_2.html?nav=rss_opinion/columns "Knowland Group became one of the fastest-growing companies by taking photos of signs."] ''[[The Washington Post]]''. Retrieved 2011-05-11.&lt;/ref&gt; During 2005, the company expanded to over 20 markets, serving a diverse clientele of single and multi-property clients. By the end of 2006, Knowland had over 400 clients in 60 markets and had tracked more than 200,000 events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotel-online.com/News/PR2007_1st/Jan07_Knowland.html|title=Market Intelligence Firm Celebrates Tremendous Growth; Knowland Tracks Details on over 247,000 Events in 2006, Revenue Grows 548% in Second Full Year of Operations, Now in Over 60 Metropolitan Areas / January 2007|first=Richard L.|last=Johnson|website=Hotel-online.com|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Knowland introduced Insight, a tool that generates targeted [[sales lead]]s with details on each prospect’s event booking history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotel-online.com/News/PR2007_3rd/Sept07_KnowlandInsight.html|title=Knowland Unleashes INSIGHT on the World of Hospitality and Asks Hoteliers to Imagine... Imagine a breakthrough tool that provides access to over $3 billon In group bookings|date=September 2007|first=Richard L.|last=Johnson|website=Hotel-online.com|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also activated a 7,000 square foot [[call center]] to expand its infrastructure for customer support, in-depth contact and event research, and sales activities on behalf of customers. The Event Booking Center employs research and sales support professionals who specialize in [[cold calling]] and can become an extension of hotel clients’ sales staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotel-online.com/News/PR2007_3rd/July07_KnowlandCenter.html|title=The Knowland Group Opens 100 Seat Call Center in Salisbury MD; Market Intelligence Firm Continues Expansion, Opens Combined Call, Operations Center on Maryland's Eastern Shore / July 2007|first=Richard L.|last=Johnson|website=Hotel-online.com|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowland launched Target Net, a meetings management and sales force [[automation]] platform, in 2010. In addition to managing events from start to finish, Target Net also generated sales leads and opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.knowland.com/data/PDFBase/and%20Group%20Launches%20TargetNet129089905378038750.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009001811/http://www.knowland.com/data/PDFBase/and%20Group%20Launches%20TargetNet129089905378038750.pdf |archivedate=2014-10-09 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; This product was discontinued in 2015.

Today Knowland is a provider of intuitive business intelligence products for the hospitality industry and has more than 3,000 client [[hotel]]s and 50,000 users globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cms.knowland.com/data/PDFBase/Group_Announces_New_President_and_CEO_Tim_Hart.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Knowland Group Announces New President and Chief Executive Officer, Tim Hart|website=Cms.knowland.com|accessdate=2014-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Target Net is a salesforce automation and meetings management tool that allows [[hotel manager|hoteliers]] to manage their [[sales funnel]] from start to finish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dc.citybizlist.com/5/2011/2/3/Target-Net-Goes-Mobile-On-the-iPad.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814093030/http://dc.citybizlist.com/5/2011/2/3/Target-Net-Goes-Mobile-On-the-iPad.aspx |archivedate=2011-08-14 |df= }} Retrieved 2011-05-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowland no longer sells Target Net product, but continues to offer support for clients already using it.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Insight===
Insight is a [[search engine]] and sales lead-generation tool that gives hotel sales teams access to a database of groups that have held millions of meetings at hotels and [[conference center]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotelnewsresource.com/article51480Knowland_Gives_Hoteliers_New_Insight_into_Business_Development.html|title=Knowland Gives Hoteliers New Insight into Business Development|first=Hotel News|last=Resource|website=Hotelnewsresource.com|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Knowland released Insight 3.0, an effort to enhance the Insight platform, which transformed the traditional search engine leads database into a customizable meeting intelligence tool for event professionals. Insight 3.0 included new features such as anonymous reviews of groups and their events, the ability to follow groups, properties, and people, and more detailed group profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.knowland.com/content/insight|title=Insight|date=11 December 2015|website=Knowland.com|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After receiving many unfavorable reviews from clients regarding the changes to Insight for the 3.0 release, Knowland launched Insight 3.1 the following year (2015). Insight 3.1 was designed almost entirely around user feedback. This release leveraged the powerful, and once again enhanced, search capabilities of the tool, putting popular search features in the spotlight. Insight 3.1 made the focus of Knowland technology less about social media-influenced networking and more about the power of its raw, historical data on groups, planners, meetings, and contact information to help clients optimize their sales tactics.

===Readers===
Readers is an online readerboard service that offers daily reporting and data on groups that hold meetings and events at hotels' competitor properties. Readers combines an online tool with Knowland’s version of a traditional readerboard report, in addition to telephone-verified contact information. Each week, approximately 400 field researchers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-hospitality.com/article.mvc/Knowland-Group-Introduces-Its-Business-0001|title=Knowland Group Introduces Its Business Development Suite For The Hospitality Industry|website=E-hospitality.com|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; take [[Digital photography|digital photos]] of hotel readerboards. Those photos are uploaded each night to the Knowland database and the data made available online to clients the next morning. New groups are constantly being added to the [[database]] and detailed profiles are created and updated for each group.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In April 2014, Knowland released a new data management process to help maintain the accuracy and freshness of the information provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.knowland.com/data/PDFBase/That_Helps_Keep_Information_Fresh_and_Accurate.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008215318/http://www.knowland.com/data/PDFBase/That_Helps_Keep_Information_Fresh_and_Accurate.pdf |archivedate=2014-10-08 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transport]] today is mostly powered by fossil fuel.  The reason for this is the ease of use and the existence of mature technologies harnessing this fuel source.  Fossil fuels represent a concentrated, relatively compact [[Energy development|source of energy]].  The drawbacks are that they are heavily polluting and rely on limited natural resources.  There are many proposals to harness renewable forms of energy, to use fossil fuel more efficiently, or to use human power, or some hybrid of these, to move people and things.

The '''list below contains some [[Mode of transport|forms of transport]] not in general use, but considered as possibilities in the future.'''

A '''magnetic core''' is a piece of [[magnetism|magnetic material]] with a high [[magnetic permeability]] used to confine and guide [[magnetic field]]s in electrical, [[electromechanical]] and magnetic devices such as [[electromagnet]]s, [[transformer]]s, [[electric motor]]s, [[electric generator|generators]], [[inductor]]s, magnetic [[recording head]]s, and magnetic assemblies.  It is made of [[ferromagnetic]] metal such as iron, or [[ferrimagnetic]] compounds such as [[Ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]]s.  The high permeability, relative to the surrounding air, causes the [[magnetic field line]]s to be concentrated in the core material. The magnetic field is often created by a current-carrying coil of wire around the core.

The use of a magnetic core can increase the strength of [[magnetic field]] in an [[electromagnetic coil]] by a factor of several hundred times what it would be without the core.  However, magnetic cores have side effects which must be taken into account.  In [[alternating current]] (AC) devices they cause energy losses, called [[core losses]], due to [[hysteresis loss|hysteresis]] and [[eddy current]]s in applications such as transformers and inductors.  "Soft" magnetic materials with low [[magnetic coercivity|coercivity]] and hysteresis, such as [[silicon steel]], or [[Ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]], are usually used in cores.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:CoreSymbols.png|350px|thumb|[[Electronic symbol]] for various types of magnetic cores]] --&gt;

== Core materials ==
An electric current through a wire wound into a [[electromagnetic coil|coil]] creates a [[magnetic field]] through the center of the coil, due to [[Ampere's circuital law]].  Coils are widely used in electronic components such as [[electromagnet]]s, [[inductor]]s, [[transformer]]s, [[electric motor]]s and [[Electric generator|generator]]s.  A coil without a magnetic core is called an "air core" coil.  Adding a piece of [[ferromagnetic]] or [[ferrimagnetic]] material in the center of the coil can increase the magnetic field by hundreds or thousands of times; this is called a magnetic core.  The field of the wire penetrates the core material, [[magnetization|magnetizing]] it, so that the strong magnetic field of the core adds to the field created by the wire.  The amount that the magnetic field is increased by the core depends on the [[magnetic permeability]] of the core material. Because side effects such as [[eddy current]]s and [[hysteresis]] can cause frequency-dependent energy losses, different core materials are used for coils used at different [[frequency|frequencies]].   

In some cases the losses are undesirable and with very strong fields saturation can be a problem, and an 'air core' is used. A former may still be used; a piece of material, such as plastic or a composite, that may not have any significant magnetic permeability but which simply holds the coils of wires in place.

===Solid metals===

==== Soft iron ====

"Soft" ([[annealing (metallurgy)|annealed]]) [[iron]] is used in magnetic assemblies, [[direct current]] (DC) electromagnets and in some electric motors; and it can create a concentrated field that is as much as 50,000 times more intense than an air core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physicsforums.com/archive/index.php/t-164613.html|title=Soft iron core|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iron is desirable to make magnetic cores, as it can withstand high levels of [[magnetic field]] without [[Saturation (magnetic)|saturating]] (up to 2.16 [[Tesla (unit)|tesla]]s at ambient temperature.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Sadarnac, ''Les composants magnétiques de l'électronique de puissance'', cours de Supélec, mars 2001 [in french]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Danan|first=H.|last2=Herr|first2=A.|last3=Meyer|first3=A.J.P.|date=1968-02-01|title=New Determinations of the Saturation Magnetization of Nickel and Iron|url=http://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.2163571|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|volume=39|issue=2|pages=669–70|doi=10.1063/1.2163571|issn=0021-8979|bibcode=1968JAP....39..669D}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  Annealed iron is used because, unlike "hard" iron, it has low [[coercivity]] and so does not remain magnetised when the field is removed, which is often important in applications where the magnetic field is required to be repeatedly switched.

Due to the electrical conductivity of the metal, when a solid one-piece metal core is used in [[alternating current]] (AC) applications such as transformers and inductors, the changing magnetic field induces large [[eddy current]]s circulating within it, closed loops of electric current in planes perpendicular to the field.  The current flowing through the resistance of the metal heats it by [[Joule heating]], causing significant power losses.  Therefore, solid iron cores are not used in transformers or inductors, they are replaced by [[lamination|laminated]] or powdered iron cores, or nonconductive cores like [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]].

==== Laminated silicon steel ====
{{main article|Silicon steel}}
[[File:Laminated core eddy currents 2.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|''(left)'' Eddy currents ''(&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;I, red&lt;/span&gt;)'' within a solid iron transformer core. ''(right)'' Making the core out of thin [[laminations]] parallel to the field ''(&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;B, green&lt;/span&gt;)'' with insulation between them reduces the eddy currents.  In this diagram the field and currents are shown in one direction, but they actually reverse direction with the alternating current in the transformer winding.]]

In order to reduce the eddy current losses mentioned above, most low frequency power transformers and inductors use [[laminations|laminated]] cores, made of stacks of thin sheets of [[silicon steel]]:

===== Lamination =====
[[Image:EI Lam.jpg|thumb|right|Typical EI Lamination.]]

[[Lamination|Laminated]] magnetic cores are made of stacks of thin iron sheets coated with an insulating layer, lying as much as possible parallel with the lines of flux.  The layers of insulation serve as a barrier to eddy currents, so eddy currents can only flow in narrow loops within the thickness of each single lamination.  Since the current in an eddy current loop is proportional to the area of the loop, this prevents most of the current from flowing, reducing eddy currents to a very small level.   Since power dissipated is proportional to the square of the current, breaking a large core into narrow laminations reduces the power losses drastically.  From this, it can be seen that the thinner the laminations, the lower the eddy current losses.

===== Silicon alloying =====
A small addition of [[silicon]] to iron (around 3%) results in a dramatic increase of the [[resistivity]] of the metal, up to four times higher.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}  The higher resistivity reduces the eddy currents, so silicon steel is used in transformer cores. Further increase in silicon concentration impairs the steel's mechanical properties, causing difficulties for rolling due to brittleness.

Among the two types of [[silicon steel]], grain-oriented (GO) and grain non-oriented (GNO), GO is most desirable for magnetic cores. It is [[anisotropic]], offering better magnetic properties than GNO in one direction. As the magnetic field in inductor and transformer cores is always along the same direction, it is an advantage to use grain oriented steel in the preferred orientation. Rotating machines, where the direction of the magnetic field can change, gain no benefit from grain-oriented steel.

==== Special alloys ====
A family of specialized alloys exists for magnetic core applications. Examples are [[mu-metal]], [[permalloy]], and [[supermalloy]]. They can be manufactured as stampings or as long ribbons for tape wound cores. Some alloys, e.g. [[Sendust]], are manufactured as powder and [[sintering|sintered]] to shape.

Many materials require careful [[heat treatment]] to reach their magnetic properties, and lose them when subjected to mechanical or thermal abuse. For example, the permeability of mu-metal increases about 40 times after [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] in hydrogen atmosphere in a magnetic field; subsequent sharper bends disrupt its grain alignment, leading to localized loss of permeability; this can be regained by repeating the annealing step.

==== Vitreous metal ====
[[Amorphous metal]] is a variety of alloys (e.g. [[Metglas]]) that are non-crystalline or glassy. These are being used to create high-efficiency transformers.  The materials can be highly responsive to magnetic fields for low hysteresis losses, and they can also have lower conductivity to reduce eddy current losses. China is currently making widespread industrial and power grid usage of these transformers for new installations.

===Powdered metals===
Powder cores consist of metal grains mixed with a suitable organic or inorganic binder, and pressed to desired density. Higher density is achieved with higher pressure and lower amount of binder. Higher density cores have higher permeability, but lower resistance and therefore higher losses due to eddy currents. Finer particles allow operation at higher frequencies, as the eddy currents are mostly restricted to within the individual grains. Coating of the particles with an insulating layer, or their separation with a thin layer of a binder, lowers the eddy current losses. Presence of larger particles can degrade high-frequency performance. Permeability is influenced by the spacing between the grains, which form distributed air gap; the less gap, the higher permeability and the less-soft saturation. Due to large difference of densities, even a small amount of binder, weight-wise, can significantly increase the volume and therefore intergrain spacing.

Lower permeability materials are better suited for higher frequencies, due to balancing of core and winding losses.

The surface of the particles is often oxidized and coated with a phosphate layer, to provide them with mutual electrical insulation.

==== Iron ====
Powdered iron is the cheapest material. It has higher core loss than the more advanced alloys, but this can be compensated for by making the core bigger; it is advantageous where cost is more important than mass and size. Saturation flux of about 1 to 1.5 tesla. Relatively high hysteresis and eddy current loss, operation limited to lower frequencies (approx. below 100&amp;nbsp;kHz). Used in energy storage inductors, DC output chokes, differential mode chokes, triac regulator chokes, chokes for [[power factor]] correction, resonant inductors, and pulse and flyback transformers.&lt;ref name="coilws"/&gt;

The binder used is usually epoxy or other organic resin, susceptible to thermal aging. At higher temperatures, typically above 125&amp;nbsp;°C, the binder degrades and the core magnetic properties may change. With more heat-resistant binders the cores can be used up to 200&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="chalmers"&gt;{{cite web|author=Johan Kindmark, Fredrik Rosén |url=http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/183920/183920.pdf |title=Powder Material for Inductor Cores, Evaluation of MPP, Sendust and High flux core characteristics |publisher=Department of Energy and Environment, Division of Electric Power Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology |location=Göteborg, Sweden |date=2013 |accessdate=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iron powder cores are most commonly available as toroids. Sometimes as E, EI, and rods or blocks, used primarily in high-power and high-current parts.

Carbonyl iron is significantly more expensive than hydrogen-reduced iron.

===== Carbonyl iron =====
{{main article|carbonyl iron}}

Powdered cores made of [[carbonyl iron]], a highly pure iron, have high stability of parameters across a wide range of [[temperature]]s and [[magnetic flux]] levels, with excellent [[Q factor]]s between 50&amp;nbsp;kHz and 200&amp;nbsp;MHz. Carbonyl iron powders are basically constituted of micrometer-size [[sphere]]s of iron coated in a thin layer of [[electrical insulation]]. This is equivalent to a microscopic laminated magnetic circuit (see silicon steel, above), hence reducing the [[eddy currents]], particularly at very high frequencies. Carbonyl iron has lower losses than hydrogen-reduced iron, but also lower permeability.

A popular application of carbonyl iron-based magnetic cores is in high-frequency and broadband [[inductor]]s and [[transformer]]s, especially higher power ones.

Carbonyl iron cores are often called "RF cores".

The as-prepared particles, "E-type"and have onion-like skin, with concentric shells separated with a gap. They contain significant amount of carbon. They behave as much smaller than what their outer size would suggest. The "C-type" particles can be prepared by heating the E-type ones in hydrogen atmosphere at 400&amp;nbsp;°C for prolonged time, resulting in carbon-free powders.&lt;ref name="handbkferr"/&gt;

===== Hydrogen-reduced iron =====
Powdered cores made of [[hydrogen reduced iron]] have higher permeability but lower Q than carbonyl iron. They are used mostly for [[electromagnetic interference]] [[electronic filter|filters]] and low-frequency chokes, mainly in [[switched-mode power supply|switched-mode power supplies]].

Hydrogen-reduced iron cores are often called "power cores".

==== MPP (molypermalloy) ====
An alloy of about 2% [[molybdenum]], 81% [[nickel]], and 17% iron. Very low core loss, low hysteresis and therefore low signal distortion. Very good temperature stability. High cost. Maximum saturation flux of about 0.8 tesla. Used in high-Q filters, resonant circuits, loading coils, transformers, chokes, etc.&lt;ref name="coilws"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coilws.com/index.php?main_page=page&amp;id=41|title=How to choose Iron Powder, Sendust, Koolmu, High Flux and MPP Cores as output inductor and chokes : CWS Coil Winding Specialist, manufacturer of transformers, inductors, coils and chokes|first=The Zen Cart™ Team and|last=others|website=www.coilws.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The material was first introduced in 1940, used in [[loading coil]]s to compensate capacitance in long telephone lines. It is usable up to about 200&amp;nbsp;kHz to 1&amp;nbsp;MHz, depending on vendor.&lt;ref name="chalmers"/&gt; It is still used in above-ground telephone lines, due to its temperature stability. Underground lines, where temperature is more stable, tend to use ferrite cores due to their lower cost.&lt;ref name="handbkferr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.cz/books?id=StbgBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA185&amp;lpg=PA185&amp;dq=powder+core+%22carbonyl+iron%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jLGXykwVQp&amp;sig=ZnXgILZ3fZR9e6Obb7PaBkhcif4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=powder+core+%22carbonyl+iron%22&amp;f=false|title=Handbook of Modern Ferromagnetic Materials|first=Alex|last=Goldman|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== High-flux (Ni-Fe) ====
An alloy of about 50–50% of nickel and iron. High energy storage, saturation flux density of about 1.5 tesla. Residual flux density near zero. Used in applications with high DC current bias (line noise filters, or inductors in switching regulators) or where low residual flux density is needed (e.g. pulse and flyback transformers, the high saturation is suitable for unipolar drive), especially where space is constrained. The material is usable up to about 200&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name="coilws"/&gt;

==== Sendust, KoolMU ====
An alloy of 6% aluminium, 9% silicon, and 85% iron. Core losses higher than MPP. Very low [[magnetostriction]], makes low audio noise. Loses inductance with increasing temperature, unlike the other materials; can be exploited by combining with other materials as a composite core, for temperature compensation. Saturation flux of about 1 tesla. Good temperature stability. Used in switching power supplies, pulse and flyback transformers, in-line noise filters, swing chokes, and in filters in [[phase-fired controller]]s (e.g. dimmers) where low acoustic noise is important.&lt;ref name="coilws"/&gt;

Absence of nickel results in easier processing of the material and its lower cost than both high-flux and MPP.

The material was invented in Japan in 1936. It is usable up to about 500&amp;nbsp;kHz to 1&amp;nbsp;MHz, depending on vendor.&lt;ref name="chalmers"/&gt;

==== Nanocrystalline ====

A [[nanocrystalline]] alloy of a standard iron-boron-silicon alloy, with addition of smaller amounts of [[copper]] and [[niobium]]. The grain size of the powder reaches down to 10-100 nanometers. The material has very good performance at lower frequencies. It is used in chokes for inverters and in high power applications. It is available under names like e.g. Nanoperm, Vitroperm, Hitperm and Finemet.&lt;ref name="chalmers"/&gt;

===Ceramics===

==== Ferrite ====
{{main article|Ferrite core}}

[[Ferrite (magnet)|Ferrite ceramics]] are used for high-frequency applications. The ferrite materials can be engineered with a wide range of parameters. As ceramics, they are essentially insulators, which prevents eddy currents, although losses such as hysteresis losses can still occur.

=== Air ===
&lt;!-- arguably this is not a magnetic core, but the articles need a section to explain the downsides of magnetic cores, and why high permeable cores are not always used, and 'air core' is a well recognized term of art. ---&gt;
A coil not containing a magnetic core is called an ''air core''.  This includes coils wound on a plastic or ceramic form in addition to those made of stiff wire that are self-supporting and have air inside them. Air core coils generally have a much lower [[inductance]] than similarly sized ferromagnetic core coils, but are used in [[radio frequency]] circuits to prevent energy losses called [[core loss]]es that occur in magnetic cores.  The absence of normal core losses permits a higher [[Q factor]], so air core coils are used in high frequency [[resonant circuit]]s, such as up to a few megahertz. However, losses such as [[proximity effect (electromagnetism)|proximity effect]] and [[dielectric losses]] are still present. Air cores are also used when field strengths above around 2 Tesla are required as they are not subject to saturation.

== Commonly used structures ==
=== Straight cylindrical rod ===
[[File:Ferrite-R-Core_(7).jpg|thumb|Ferrite rods are simple cylinders of ferrite that can be wound around.]]
Most commonly made of [[Allotropes of iron|ferrite]] or powdered iron, and used in [[radio]]s especially for tuning an [[inductor]]. The coil is wound around the rod, or a coil form with the rod inside.  Moving the rod in or out of the coil changes the flux through the coil, and can be used to adjust the [[inductance]]. Often the rod is [[screw thread|thread]]ed to allow adjustment with a screwdriver. In radio circuits, a blob of [[wax]] or [[resin]] is used once the inductor has been tuned to prevent the core from moving.

The presence of the high permeability core increases the [[inductance]], but the magnetic field lines must still pass through the [[air]] from one end of the rod to the other. The air path ensures that the inductor remains [[linear]]. In this type of inductor [[radiation]] occurs at the end of the rod and [[electromagnetic interference]] may be a problem in some circumstances.

=== Single "I" core ===

Like a cylindrical rod but square, rarely used on its own.
This type of core is most likely to be found in car ignition coils.

=== "C" or "U" core ===
''U'' and ''C''-shaped cores are used with ''I'' or another ''C'' or ''U'' core to make a square closed core, the simplest closed core shape.  Windings may be put on one or both legs of the core.

| caption2  = The C-shaped core, with rounded corners
}}

=== "E" core ===
E-shaped core are more symmetric solutions to form a closed magnetic system. Most of the time, the electric circuit is wound around the center leg, whose section area is twice that of each individual outer leg. In 3-phase transformer cores, the legs are of equal size, and all three legs are wound.

}}

==== "E" and "I" core ====

Sheets of suitable iron stamped out in shapes like the ([[sans-serif]]) [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]] "E" and "I", are stacked with the "I" against the open end of the "E" to form a 3-legged structure. Coils can be wound around any leg, but usually the center leg is used. This type of core is frequently used for power transformers, autotransformers, and inductors.

}}

==== Pair of "E" cores ====

Again used for iron cores. Similar to using an "E" and "I" together, a pair of "E" cores will accommodate a larger coil former and can produce a larger [[inductor]] or [[transformer]]. If an air gap is required, the centre leg of the "E" is shortened so that the air gap sits in the middle of the coil to minimize [[magnetic fringing|fringing]] and reduce [[electromagnetic interference]].

=== Planar core ===

A planar core consists of two flat pieces of magnetic material, one above and one below the coil. It is typically used with a flat coil that is part of a [[printed circuit board]]. This design is excellent for [[mass production]] and allows a high [[power (physics)|power]], small [[volume]] [[transformer]] to be constructed for low cost. It is not as ideal as either a '''pot core''' or '''toroidal core'''{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} but costs less to produce.

}}

{{clear}}

=== Pot core ===

Usually ferrite or similar. This is used for [[inductor]]s and [[transformer]]s. The shape of a pot core is round with an internal hollow that almost completely encloses the coil. Usually a pot core is made in two halves which fit together around a coil former ([[bobbin]]). This design of core has a [[Electromagnetic shielding|shield]]ing effect, preventing [[radiation]] and reducing [[electromagnetic interference]].{{multiple image

}}

=== Toroidal core ===
{{Main article|Toroidal inductors and transformers}}

This design is based on a [[toroid]] (the same shape as a [[doughnut]]).  The coil is wound through the hole in the torus and around the outside.  An ideal coil is distributed evenly all around the circumference of the torus.  The [[symmetry]] of this geometry creates a [[magnetic field]] of circular loops inside the core, and the lack of sharp bends will constrain virtually all of the field to the core material.  This not only makes a highly [[Energy conversion efficiency|efficient]] [[transformer]], but also reduces the [[electromagnetic interference]] radiated by the coil.

[[Image:Toroid core.png|thumb|150px|A toroidal core]]

It is popular for applications where the desirable features are: high [[Power-to-weight ratio|specific power]] per mass and [[volume]], low [[mains hum]], and minimal [[electromagnetic interference]].  One such application is the [[power supply]] for a hi-fi [[audio amplifier]].  The main drawback that limits their use for general purpose applications is the inherent difficulty of winding wire through the center of a torus.

Unlike a split core (a core made of two elements, like a pair of ''E'' cores), specialized machinery is required for automated winding of a toroidal core.  Toroids have less audible noise, such as mains hum, because the magnetic forces do not exert bending moment on the core.  The core is only in compression or tension, and the circular shape is more stable mechanically.

=== Ring or bead ===
[[File:Two ferrite beads.jpg|thumb|On the left, a non-adjustable [[ferrite (magnetic core)|ferrite]] rod with connection wires glued to the ends. On the right, a molded ferrite rod with holes, with a single wire threaded through the holes.]]
[[Image:Ferrite bead no shell.jpg|thumb|right|A ferrite ring on a computer data cable.]]
The ring is essentially identical in shape and performance to the toroid, except that inductors commonly pass only through the center of the core, without wrapping around the core multiple times.

The ring core may also be composed of two separate C-shaped hemispheres secured together within a plastic shell, permitting it to be placed on finished cables with large connectors already installed, that would prevent threading the cable through the small inner diameter of a solid ring.

== A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; value ==
The A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; value of a core configuration is frequently specified by manufacturers. The relationship between inductance and A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; number in the linear portion of the magnetisation curve is defined to be:

:&lt;math&gt;L = n^2 A_L&lt;/math&gt;

where n is the number of turns, L is the inductance (e.g. in nH) and A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is expressed in inductance per turn squared (e.g. in nH/n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="AL Value"&gt;http://www.jmag-international.com/catalog/101_ChokeCoil_CurrentCharacteristic.html, A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; Value&lt;/ref&gt;

== Core loss ==
When the core is subjected to a ''changing'' magnetic field, as it is in devices that use AC current such as [[transformer]]s, [[inductor]]s, and [[AC motor]]s and [[alternator]]s, some of the power that would ideally be transferred through the device is lost in the core, dissipated as [[heat]] and sometimes [[noise]].  The losses are often described as being in three categories:

===Hysteresis losses===
{{main|Magnetic hysteresis}}
When the magnetic field through the core changes, the [[magnetization]] of the core material changes by expansion and contraction of the tiny [[magnetic domain]]s it is composed of, due to movement of the [[Domain wall (magnetism)|domain wall]]s.  This process causes losses, because the domain walls get "snagged" on defects in the crystal structure and then "snap" past them, dissipating energy as heat.  This is called [[hysteresis loss]].  It can be seen in the graph of the ''B'' field versus the ''H'' field for the material, which has the form of a closed loop. 
The net energy that flows into the inductor expressed in relationship to the B-H characteristic of the core is shown by the equation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erickson|first1=Robert|last2=Maksimović|first2=Dragan|title=Fundamentals of Power Electronics, Second Edition|date=2001|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|isbn=9780792372707|page=506}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;W=\int{(nA_c\frac{dB(t)}{t})(\frac{H(t)l_m}{n})dt}=(A_cl_m)\int{HdB}&lt;/math&gt;
This equation shows that the amount of energy lost in the material in one cycle of the applied field is proportional to the area inside the [[hysteresis loop]].  Since the energy lost in each cycle is constant, hysteresis power losses increase proportionally with [[frequency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dhogal|first1=P.S.|title=Basic Electrical Engineering, Volume 1|date=1986|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=9780074515860|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final equation for the hysteresis power loss is&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erickson|first1=Robert|last2=Maksimović|first2=Dragan|title=Fundamentals of Power Electronics, Second Edition|date=2001|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|isbn=9780792372707|page=506}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P_H=(f)(A_cl_m)\int{HdB}&lt;/math&gt;

===Eddy-current losses===

If the core is electrically [[electrical conductivity|conductive]], the changing magnetic field induces circulating loops of current in it, called [[eddy current]]s, due to [[electromagnetic induction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kazimierczuk|first1=Marian K.|title=High-frequency magnetic components|date=2014|publisher=Wiley|location=Chichester|isbn=978-1-118-71779-0|page=113|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The loops flow perpendicular to the magnetic field axis.  The energy of the currents is dissipated as heat in the resistance of the core material.  The power loss is proportional to the area of the loops and inversely proportional to the resistivity of the core material. Eddy current losses can be reduced by making the core out of thin [[lamination]]s which have an insulating coating, or alternatively, making the core of a magnetic material with high electrical resistance, like [[ferrite (magnetic core)|ferrite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erickson|first1=Robert|last2=Maksimović|first2=Dragan|title=Fundamentals of Power Electronics, Second Edition|date=2001|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|isbn=9780792372707|page=507}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Most magnetic cores intended for power converter application use ferrite cores for this reason.

===Anomalous losses===
By definition, this category includes any losses in addition to eddy-current and hysteresis losses.  This can also be described as broadening of the hysteresis loop with frequency.  Physical mechanisms for anomalous loss include localized eddy-current effects near moving domain walls.

=== Legg's equation ===
An equation known as Legg's equation models the [[magnetism|magnetic material]] core loss at low [[flux]] densities. The equation has three loss components: hysteresis, residual, and eddy current,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold Engineering Company|n.d.|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Legg|first=Victor E.|title=Magnetic Measurements at Low Flux Densities Using the Alternating Current Bridge|date=January 1936|url=http://www3.alcatel-lucent.com/bstj/vol15-1936/articles/bstj15-1-39.pdf|journal=[[Bell System Technical Journal]]|volume=15|issue=1|pages=39&amp;ndash;63|publisher=Bell Telephone Laboratories}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/17875867|title=Soft ferrites : properties and applications|last=Snelling|first=E.C.|date=1988|publisher=Butterworths|year=|isbn=0408027606|edition=2nd|location=London|pages=|oclc=17875867}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is given by

Born on December 1911 in Cook County, Illinois. Started as an engineer with the US Army Signal Corp, he used his experience and abilities to form two career paths. He became a teacher in the Chicago public schools high school system as a radio instructor. Soon after got into technical publishing as Supreme Publications. As publisher his goal was to support the radio and television servicing industry with easy to understand reference materials. He was married to Rose Rissman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beitman|first=Morris N.|title=Family History|url=http://sortedbyname.com/pages/b105500.html|publisher=sortedbyname.com|accessdate=2013-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Morris Beitman received his BS in Mathematics at [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] and later served in the military as an engineer with the [[US Army Signal Corps]]. He later became an associate member with the Institute of Radio Engineers (now called [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] or IEEE). His known pre and post military career was a teacher in the Chicago public high schools as radio instructor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beitman|first=M. N.|title=Most Often Needed 1926-1938 Radio Diagrams|year=1941|publisher=Supreme Publications|location=Chicago, IL|isbn=0-914126-08-3|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The founding of Supreme Publications==
By the mid-1930s the growth in ownership of radio receivers in the United States spun off other business opportunities. One of them was the repair of radio and radio-phonograph sets and eventually, television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McMahon|first=Morgan E.|title=Flick of the Switch 1930-1950|year=1987|publisher=Vintage Radio|location=North Highlands, CA|isbn=0-914126-10-5|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hugo Gernsback]] was an early publisher of repair manuals. Soon others were publishing. [[John F. Rider]] in the early 1930s began to compile complete volumes of radio servicing diagrams of many radio manufacturers called the Perpetual Troubleshooter's Manual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rider|first=John|title=John F Rider 1900-1985 W2RID|url=http://oldqslcards.com/w2rid.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In time these servicing manuals became quite large and contained information on radios that were not common or were produced in small quantities. Although Rider's Perpetual Troubleshooter's Manual became a standard reference during the 1930s, the size and bulk of these yearly volumes could become a hindrance. Rider manuals contained information on common and rare models. Service businesses were paying extra for brands they rarely or never encounter. This "opened the door" for an alternative path and Morris Beitman was able to exploit this business opportunity.

In 1940-41 Morris N. Beitman under the name Supreme Publications (located at 328 S. Jefferson St in Chicago) produced a series of books called, "Most-Often-Needed Radio Diagrams and Servicing Information" and later "Most-Often-Needed Television Servicing Information" for successive years. These books offered radio and television repair businesses a condensed version of the Rider's, "Perpetual Troubleshooter's Manual", by only providing models that were common or made in large quantities. The radio series started with 1926-38 models in one volume. Each year after that represented a new volume until 1969 when the last volume was published.  The television series started in 1946 and continued into the early 1970s. Their last known location was 1760 Balsam Road, Highland Park, Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beitman|first=Hartford|title=Most Often Needed 1967-1969 Radio Diagrams and Servicing Information|year=1969|publisher=Supreme Publications|location=Chicago|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1940-1960 Supreme published other volume sets for record players, tape recorders, wire recorders and other specialized consumer electronics using the "most often needed" title. These references like radios and televisions were in yearly bound sets but were not consistent year-to-year sets. These volumes never reached the quantity, consistency or longevity of the radio or television titles.

==Other publications==
Beitman under the Supreme Publication name was author to a number of other publications devoted to radio and television. Dates given are the earliest known date of first publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beitman|first=M. N.|title=Catalog Search|url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/002019363|work=Digital Library Search|publisher=Hathi Trust|accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years and the end of Supreme Publications==
Little can be found on Morris N. Beitman's career activities and Supreme Publications.  It is also possible that Supreme Publications was a side business for Morris Beitman since he was also a radio instructor in the Chicago high schools. In the 1950s, like [[John F. Rider]], Beitman had to revise many of his publications due to rapid changes in technology used in consumer electronics. In the 1960s his son Hartford assisted him in Supreme Publications by continuing the yearly service volumes for radio and television. Many of Morris Beitman's publications either had no copyright or they had expired. Hartford spent time to straighten these matters and compiled the "1967-69 Most Often Needed Radio Diagram and Servicing Information" book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beitman|first=Hartford|title=Most Often Needed 1967-1969 Radio Diagrams and Servicing Information|year=1969|publisher=Supreme Publications|location=Chicago|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Supreme would stop publishing by the early 1970s. One reason was the declining need for repairing consumer electronics due to the increased reliability and the low cost of electronics (cost less to buy one than repair it). He died on February 1980, in Highland Park, Illinois.

==The rise in interest of Supreme's "Most Often Needed Series"==
Radio and television servicing is no longer a significant business segment in small or independent business. The rise in interest is in preserving old consumer technology. Interest in Morris Beitman's, "Most Often Needed Radio Diagrams" resurfaced in the early 1980s with the rise of restoring antique and collectible radios made before the 1940s. Vintage Radio, founded by Morgan E. McMahon was a publishing company specializing in preserving early radio and television technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McMahon|first=Morgan E.|title=Vintage Radio|year=1981|publisher=Vintage Radio|location=Palos Verdes Peninsula|isbn=0-914126-02-4|page=Inside Back Cover}}&lt;/ref&gt; They reprinted "Most Often Needed 1926-1938 Radio Diagrams and Servicing Information" and sold it to radio collectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beitman|first=Morris N.|title=Most Often Needed 1926-1938 Radio Diagrams and Servicing Information|year=1941|publisher=Vintage Radio|location=Palos Verdes Peninsula|isbn=0-914126-08-3|page=Front and Back Cover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1986-1989, Hartford Beitman and Kristina Hund Beitman made an effort to resurrect the "Most Often Needed" series by compiling past servicing information from 1926 to 1950 based on brand name. This series of books was published by A R S Enterprises. No more new copies are available and A R S Enterprises publishing current status has not been found.

'''Nanofountain probe (NFP)''' is a cantilevered micro-fluidic device terminated in a nanofountain.  The embedded [[microfluidics]] facilitates rapid and continuous delivery of molecules from the on-chip reservoirs to the fountain tip. When the tip is brought into contact with the substrate, a liquid [[Meniscus (liquid)|meniscus]] forms, providing a path for molecular transport to the [[Enzyme substrate (biology)|substrate]].  By controlling the geometry of the meniscus through hold time and deposition speed, various inks and biomolecules could be patterned on a surface, with sub 100&amp;nbsp;nm resolution.

[[File:Nanofountain probe-SEM and Oprtical Image.tif|thumb|right|Optical image of an array (left) and SEM image of the tip (right)]]

== Historical background ==

The advent of [[Dip-Pen Nanolithography|dip-pen nanolithography (DPN)]] in recent years represented a revolution in [[Nanoscopic scale|nanoscale]] patterning technology. With sub-100-nanometer resolution and an architecture conducive to massive parallelization, DPN is capable of producing large arrays of nanoscale features. As such, conventional DPN and other probe-based techniques are generally limited in their rate of deposition and by the need for repeated re-inking during extended patterning.

To address these challenges, nanofountain probe was developed by Espinosa et al. where [[Microchannel (microtechnology)|microchannels]] were embedded in AFM probes to transport ink or bio-molecules from reservoirs to substrates, realizing continuous writing at the nanoscale.&lt;ref&gt;1.	Kim, K.-H., et al. Massively parallel multi-tip nanoscale write with fluidic capabilities-fountain pen nanolithography (FPN). in ''Proceedings of the 4th International Symposium on MEMS and Nanotechnology''. 2003. Charlotte, North Carolina.&lt;/ref&gt; Integration of continuous liquid ink feeding within the NFP facilitates more rapid deposition and eliminates the need for repeated dipping, all while preserving the sub-100-nanometer resolution of DPN.

== Microfabrication ==

Nano fountain probes (NFPs) are fabricated on the wafer-scale using [[microfabrication]] techniques allowing for batch fabrication of numerous chips.&lt;ref&gt;Moldovan, N., K.-H. Kim, and H.D. Espinosa, Design and fabrication of a novel microfluidic nanoprobe. Journal of Micromechanical Systems, 2006. 15: p. 204-213.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the different generations of devices, design and experimentation improved the device yielding to a robust fabrication process. The highly enhanced feature dimension and shapes is expected to improve the performance in writing and imaging.

== Applications ==

=== Direct-write nanopatterning ===

NFP is used in the development of a to scale, direct-write nanomanufacturing platform. The platform is capable of constructing complex, highly-functional nanoscale devices from a diverse suite of materials (e.g., nanoparticles, catalysts (increase rate of reaction), biomolecules, and chemical solutions).&lt;ref&gt;Loh, O.Y., et al., Electric field-induced direct delivery of proteins by a nanofountain probe. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 2008. 105: p. 16438–43.&lt;/ref&gt;
Demonstrated nanopatterning capabilities include:

• Biomolecules (proteins, [[DNA]]) for biodetection assays or [[cell adhesion]] studies

• Functional nanoparticles for [[drug delivery]] studies and nanosystems making (fabrication)

• Catalysts for carbon nanotube growth in nanodevice fabrication

• Thiols for directed self-assembly of nanostructures.



=== Direct in-vitro single-cell injection ===

Taking advantage of the unique tip geometry of the NFP nanomaterials are directly injected into live cells with minimal invasiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Loh, O., et al., Nanofountain-probe-based high-resolution patterning and single-cell injection of functionalized nanodiamonds. Small, 2009. 5: p. 1667-1674.&lt;/ref&gt; This enables unique studies of [[Nanomedicine|nanoparticle]]-mediated delivery, as well as cellular pathways and toxicity. Whereas typical in [[In vitro|vitro]] studies are limited to cell populations, these broadly-applicable tools enable multifaceted interrogation at a truly single cell level.

The '''odor detection threshold''' is the lowest concentration of a certain [[odor]] compound that is perceivable by the human [[olfaction|sense of smell]]. The threshold of a chemical compound is determined in part by its [[Molecular geometry|shape]], [[Chemical polarity|polarity]], [[partial charge]]s, and [[molecular mass]]. The olfactory mechanisms responsible for a compound's different detection threshold is not well understood. As such, odor thresholds cannot be accurately predicted. Rather, they must be measured through extensive tests using human subjects in laboratory settings.

[[Optical isomer]]s can have different detection thresholds because their conformations may cause them to be less perceivable for the human nose. It is only in recent years that such compounds were separated on [[gas chromatograph]]s.

==Values==
* The [[odor threshold value|threshold value]] is the concentration an aroma or taste can be detected (air, water and fat).
* The [[odor recognition threshold|recognition threshold]] or [[arousal threshold]] of [[olfactory neurons]]  is the concentration at which you can identify an odor (air, water and fat).
* The [[odour activity value]] is the concentration divided by the threshold.
* The [[flavor impact]] is the value the rate of change in perception with concentration.
* The [[flavor contribution]] of an [[aroma component]] in a mixture to the total profile can be calculated from the total odor units and the number contributed by that aroma chemical.

===Odor detection value===
''Odor threshold value (OTV)'' (also ''aroma threshold value (ATV)'', ''Flavor threshold'') is defined as the most minimal [[concentration]] of a substance that can be detected by a [[human nose]]. Some substances can be detected when their concentration is only few [[milligram]]s per 1000 [[tonnes]], which is less than a [[Drop (unit)|drop]] in an [[Olympic swimming pool]]. Odor threshold value can be expressed as a concentration in water or concentration in air.

Two major types of flavor thresholds can be distinguished: the absolute and the difference threshold. The odor detection threshold and the odor recognition threshold are absolute thresholds; the first is the minimum concentration at which an odor can be detected without any requirements to identify or recognize the stimulus, while the second is the minimum concentration at which a stimulus can be identified or recognized.&lt;ref&gt;L.J. van Gemert (2003) Flavour thresholds&lt;/ref&gt;

The odor threshold value of an odorant is influenced by the medium.

Examples of substances with strong odors:

* (Z)-8-[[tetradecenal]] (OTV = 0.009 ppb in water)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sabine|first=Widder|title=8-tetradecenal as fragrance and flavoring substance|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US7332468|work=Google Patents|accessdate=20 July 2017|author2=Symrise GmbH &amp; Co. KG}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* p-[[vinylguaiacol]] (OTV = 10 [[Parts per billion|ppb]])&lt;ref&gt;H.H. Baek, K.R. Cadwallader (1999) Contribution of Free and Glycosidically Bound Volatile Compounds to the Aroma of Muscadine Grape Juice
Journal of Food Science 64 (3), 441–444 {{doi|10.1111/j.1365-2621.1999.tb15059.x}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variables==
Threshold in a food is dependent upon:
* The threshold of the aroma in air.
* Concentration in the food.
* Solubility in oil and water.
* Partition coefficient between the air and the food.
* The [[pH]] of the food. Some aroma compounds are affected by the pH: weak organic acids are protonated at low pH making them less soluble and hence more volatile.
* Number and functionality of odorant receptors in the observer's nose.

The concentration of an odor above a food is dependent on its solubility in that food and its [[vapor pressure]] and concentration in that food.

The '''penalty flag''' (or just "flag") is a yellow cloth used in several field sports including [[American football]] and [[lacrosse]] by [[Official (American football)|game officials]] to identify and sometimes mark the location of penalties or infractions that occur during regular play. It is usually wrapped around a weight, such as sand or beans so it can be thrown accurately over greater distances. Many officials previously weighted flags with [[Ball (bearing)|ball bearings]], but the practice was largely discontinued after a flag thrown by [[National Football League|NFL]] referee [[Jeff Triplette]] struck [[Cleveland Browns]] offensive tackle [[Orlando Brown Sr. (American football)|Orlando Brown Sr.]] in the eye during a [[1999 NFL season|1999]] game vs. the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]], causing a serious injury to Brown, who later attacked Triplette and threw him to the ground. Brown was forced to sit out three seasons because of the eye injury and settled with the NFL for a reported amount of $25 million.

The flag is colored orange in [[Canadian football]]. NFL penalty flags were colored white until 1965, when the color was changed to yellow. Penalty flags in college football were red until the 1970s.

The idea for the penalty flag came from [[Youngstown State University|Youngstown State]] coach [[Dwight "Dike" Beede|Dwight Beede]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azfootballhoff.org/hawks.htm NATIONAL FOOTBALL FOUNDATION / COLLEGE HALL OF FAME] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010410173412/http://www.azfootballhoff.org/hawks.htm |date=2001-04-10 }} "Hawk's Huddle"&lt;/ref&gt; and first used in a [[1941 Oklahoma City vs. Youngstown football game|game]] against [[Oklahoma City University]] on October 17, 1941.  Prior to the use of flags, officials used horns and whistles to signal a penalty.  Official adoption of the use of the flag occurred at the 1948 American Football Coaches rules session.  The [[National Football League]] first used flags on September 17, 1948 when the [[Green Bay Packers]] played the [[Boston Yanks]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.cox.net/bngolden1/footballstories1.htm Golden Rankings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907024027/http://members.cox.net/bngolden1/footballstories1.htm |date=2008-09-07 }} "Interesting football stories"&lt;/ref&gt;

In some football leagues, coaches are given a challenge flag of similar construction as a penalty flag. The flag is red in American football and yellow in Canadian football, so it contrasts with the officials' penalty flags. This is thrown by a coach when he wishes to contest (challenge) a referee's decision.

'''Polymerase chain reaction''' ('''PCR''') is a method widely used in [[molecular biology]] to make many copies of a specific [[DNA]] segment. Using PCR, a single copy (or more) of a [[DNA sequence]] is exponentially [[Amplification (molecular biology)|amplified]] to generate thousands to millions of more copies of that particular DNA segment. PCR is now a common and often indispensable technique used in [[medical laboratory]] and clinical laboratory research for a broad variety of applications including biomedical research and criminal forensics .&lt;ref name="Saiki1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Saiki|first1=R.|last2=Scharf|first2=S.|last3=Faloona|first3=F.|last4=Mullis|first4=K.|last5=Horn|first5=G.|last6=Erlich|first6=H.|last7=Arnheim|first7=N.|year=1985|title=Enzymatic amplification of beta-globin genomic sequences and restriction site analysis for diagnosis of sickle cell anemia|journal=Science|volume=230|issue=4732|pages=1350–1354|doi=10.1126/science.2999980|pmid=2999980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Saiki2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Saiki|first1=R.|last2=Gelfand|first2=D.|last3=Stoffel|first3=S.|last4=Scharf|first4=S.|last5=Higuchi|first5=R.|last6=Horn|first6=G.|last7=Mullis|first7=K.|last8=Erlich|first8=H.|year=1988|title=Primer-directed enzymatic amplification of DNA with a thermostable DNA polymerase|journal=Science|volume=239|issue=4839|pages=487–491|doi=10.1126/science.2448875|pmid=2448875}}&lt;/ref&gt;  PCR was developed by [[Kary Mullis]]&lt;ref name="Bartlett &amp; Stirling"&gt;{{Cite book|title=PCR Protocols|journal=Methods in Molecular Biology|last1=Bartlett|first1=J.

Mullis – Nobel Lecture: The Polymerase Chain Reaction|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1993 (along with [[Michael Smith (chemist)|Michael Smith]]) for his work in developing the method.

The vast majority of PCR methods rely on [[Thermal cycler|thermal cycling]]. Thermal cycling exposes reactants to repeated cycles of heating and cooling to permit different temperature-dependent reactions—specifically, [[DNA melting]] and [[enzyme]]-driven DNA replication. PCR employs two main reagents - [[Primer (molecular biology)|primers]] (which are short single strand DNA fragments known as [[oligonucleotide]]s that are a [[Complementary DNA|complementary]] sequence to the target DNA region) and a [[DNA polymerase]]. In the first step of PCR, the two strands of the DNA double helix are physically separated at a high temperature in a process called [[DNA melting]]. In the second step, the temperature is lowered and the primers bind to the complementary sequences of DNA. The two DNA strands then become [[DNA#Polymerases|templates]] for DNA polymerase to [[enzyme|enzymatically]] assemble a new DNA strand from free [[nucleotide]]s, the building blocks of DNA. As PCR progresses, the DNA generated is itself used as a template for replication, setting in motion a [[chain reaction]] in which the original DNA template is [[Exponential growth|exponentially]] amplified.

Almost all PCR applications employ a heat-stable DNA polymerase, such as [[Taq polymerase]], an enzyme originally isolated from the [[thermophile|thermophilic]] bacterium ''[[Thermus aquaticus]]''. If the polymerase used was heat-susceptible, it would denature under the high temperatures of the denaturation step. Before the use of Taq polymerase, DNA polymerase had to be manually added every cycle, which was a tedious and costly process. &lt;ref&gt;Angela R. Porta, &amp; Edward Enners. (2012). Determining Annealing Temperatures for Polymerase Chain Reaction. The American Biology Teacher, 74(4), 256-260. doi:10.1525/abt.2012.74.4.9&lt;/ref&gt;

Applications of the technique include [[DNA cloning]] for [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]], gene cloning and manipulation, gene mutagenesis; construction of DNA-based [[phylogeny|phylogenies]], or functional analysis of [[gene]]s; [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] and [[monitoring (medicine)|monitoring]] of [[hereditary disease]]s; amplification of ancient DNA;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/633862582|title=Fundamental laboratory approaches for biochemistry and biotechnology|last=J.|first=Ninfa, Alexander|last2=P.|first2=Ballou, David|date=2004|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1891786006|oclc=633862582}}&lt;/ref&gt; analysis of genetic fingerprints for [[DNA profiling]] (for example, in [[forensic science]] and [[parentage testing]]); and detection of [[pathogen]]s in [[nucleic acid test]]s for the diagnosis of [[infectious disease]]s.

The reaction is commonly carried out in a volume of 10–200&amp;nbsp;[[microliter|μL]] in small reaction tubes (0.2–0.5&amp;nbsp;mL volumes) in a [[thermal cycler|thermal cycler.]] The thermal cycler heats and cools the reaction tubes to achieve the temperatures required at each step of the reaction (see below). Many modern thermal cyclers make use of the [[Thermoelectric cooling|Peltier effect]], which permits both heating and cooling of the block holding the PCR tubes simply by reversing the electric current. Thin-walled reaction tubes permit favorable thermal conductivity to allow for rapid thermal equilibration. Most thermal cyclers have heated lids to prevent condensation at the top of the reaction tube. Older thermal cyclers lacking a heated lid require a layer of oil on top of the reaction mixture or a ball of wax inside the tube.

===Procedure===
Typically, PCR consists of a series of 20–40 repeated temperature changes, called thermal cycles, with each cycle commonly consisting of two or three discrete temperature steps (see figure below). The cycling is often preceded by a single temperature step at a very high temperature (&gt;{{convert|90|°C|°F}}), and followed by one hold at the end for final product extension or brief storage. The temperatures used and the length of time they are applied in each cycle depend on a variety of parameters, including the enzyme used for DNA synthesis, the concentration of bivalent ions and dNTPs in the reaction, and the [[DNA melting|melting temperature]] (''Tm'') of the primers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rychlik W, Spencer WJ, Rhoads RE | title=Optimization of the annealing temperature for DNA amplification in vitro| journal=Nucleic Acids Res| year=1990 | pages=6409–6412|volume=18|pmid=2243783 | doi = 10.1093/nar/18.21.6409 | issue=21 | pmc=332522}}&lt;/ref&gt; The individual steps common to most PCR methods are as follows:

* ''Initialization'': This step is only required for DNA polymerases that require heat activation by [[Polymerase chain reaction#Variations|hot-start PCR]].&lt;ref name=antibody_hot_start&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sharkey | first1 = D.

* ''[[Denaturation (biochemistry)#Nucleic acid denaturation|Denaturation]]'': This step is the first regular cycling event and consists of heating the reaction chamber to {{convert|94|–|98|°C|°F}} for 20–30 seconds. This causes [[DNA melting]], or denaturation, of the double-stranded DNA template by breaking the hydrogen bonds between complementary bases, yielding two single-stranded DNA molecules. 
* ''[[Annealing (biology)|Annealing]]'': In the next step, the reaction temperature is lowered to {{convert|50|–|65|°C|°F}} for 20–40 seconds, allowing annealing of the primers to each of the single-stranded DNA templates. Two different primers are typically included in the reaction mixture: one for each of the two single-stranded complements containing the target region. The primers are single-stranded sequences themselves, but are much shorter than the length of the target region, complementing only very short sequences at the 3' end of each strand.

: It is critical to determine a proper temperature for the annealing step because efficiency and specificity are strongly affected by the annealing temperature. This temperature must be low enough to allow for [[DNA–DNA hybridization|hybridization]] of the primer to the strand, but high enough for the hybridization to be specific, i.e., the primer should bind ''only'' to a perfectly complementary part of the strand, and nowhere else. If the temperature is too low, the primer may bind imperfectly. If it is too high, the primer may not bind at all. A typical annealing temperature is about 3–5&amp;nbsp;°C below the ''Tm'' of the primers used. Stable hydrogen bonds between complementary bases are formed only when the primer sequence very closely matches the template sequence. During this step, the polymerase binds to the primer-template hybrid and begins DNA formation.

:''Extension/elongation'': The temperature at this step depends on the DNA polymerase used; the optimum [[Enzyme|activity]] temperature for the thermostable DNA polymerase of  [[Taq polymerase|Taq (Thermus aquaticus) polymerase]] is approximately {{convert|75|–|80|°C|°F}},&lt;ref name="Chien et al."&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Chien A, Edgar DB, Trela JM |year= 1976|title=Deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase from the extreme thermophile Thermus aquaticus|journal=J.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; though a temperature of {{convert|72|°C|°F}} is commonly used with this enzyme. In this step, the DNA polymerase synthesizes a new DNA strand complementary to the DNA template strand by adding free dNTPs from the reaction mixture that are complementary to the template in the 5'-to-3' direction, [[condensation reaction|condensing]] the 5'-[[phosphate group]] of the dNTPs with the 3'-[[hydroxy group]] at the end of the nascent (elongating) DNA strand. The precise time required for elongation depends both on the DNA polymerase used and on the length of the DNA target region to amplify. As a rule of thumb, at their optimal temperature, most DNA polymerases polymerize a thousand bases per minute. Under optimal conditions (i.e., if there are no limitations due to limiting substrates or reagents), at each extension/elongation step, the number of DNA target sequences is doubled. With each successive cycle, the original template strands plus all newly generated strands become template strands for the next round of elongation, leading to exponential (geometric) amplification of the specific DNA target region.

: The processes of denaturation, annealing and elongation constitute a single cycle. Multiple cycles are required to amplify the DNA target to millions of copies. The formula used to calculate the number of DNA copies formed after a given number of cycles is 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''n'' is the number of cycles. Thus, a reaction set for 30 cycles results in 2&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;, or {{#expr:2^30}}, copies of the original double-stranded DNA target region.

* ''Final elongation'': This single step is optional, but is performed at a temperature of {{convert|70|–|74|°C|°F}} (the temperature range required for optimal activity of most polymerases used in PCR) for 5–15 minutes after the last PCR cycle to ensure that any remaining single-stranded DNA is fully elongated.
* ''Final hold'': The final step cools the reaction chamber to {{convert|4|–|15|°C|°F}} for an indefinite time, and may be employed for short-term storage of the PCR products.

To check whether the PCR successfully generated the anticipated DNA target region (also sometimes referred to as the amplimer or [[amplicon]]), [[agarose gel electrophoresis]] may be employed for size separation of the PCR products. The size(s) of PCR products is determined by comparison with a [[DNA ladder]], a molecular weight marker which contains DNA fragments of known size run on the gel alongside the PCR products.

===Stages===
As with other chemical reactions, the reaction rate and efficiency of PCR are affected by limiting factors. Thus, the entire PCR process can further be divided into three stages based on reaction progress:
* ''Exponential amplification'': At every cycle, the amount of product is doubled (assuming 100% reaction efficiency). After 30 cycles, a single copy of DNA can be increased up to 1 000 000 000 (one billion) copies. In a sense, then, the replication of a discrete strand of DNA is being manipulated in a tube under controlled conditions.&lt;ref name="Schochetman 1988 1154–1157"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schochetman|first=Gerald|last2=Ou|first2=Chin-Yih|last3=Jones|first3=Wanda K.|date=1988|title=Polymerase Chain Reaction|journal=The Journal of Infectious Diseases|volume=158|issue=6|pages=1154–1157|doi=10.1093/infdis/158.6.1154|jstor=30137034}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction is very sensitive: only minute quantities of DNA must be present.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell Biology,7th edition&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Leveling off stage'': The reaction slows as the DNA polymerase loses activity and as consumption of reagents such as dNTPs and primers causes them to become limiting.
* ''Plateau'': No more product accumulates due to exhaustion of reagents and enzyme.

==Optimization==
{{Main|PCR optimization}}
In practice, PCR can fail for various reasons, in part due to its sensitivity to contamination causing amplification of spurious DNA products. Because of this, a number of techniques and procedures have been developed for optimizing PCR conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://tools.thermofisher.com/Content/Focus/Focus%20Volume%2022%20Issue%201.pdf|title=PCR from problematic templates|journal= Focus |volume=22|issue=1|pages=10 |year=2000|author=Borman, Jon; Schuster, David; Li, Wu-bo; Jessee, Joel and Rashtchian, Ayoub }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://tools.thermofisher.com/Content/Focus/Focus%20Volume%2022%20Issue%201.pdf|title=Helpful tips for PCR|journal= Focus |volume=22|issue=1|pages=12 |year=2000|author=Bogetto, Prachi and Waidne, Lisa }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contamination with extraneous DNA is addressed with lab protocols and procedures that separate pre-PCR mixtures from potential DNA contaminants.&lt;ref name=molecular_cloning /&gt; This usually involves spatial separation of PCR-setup areas from areas for analysis or purification of PCR products, use of disposable plasticware, and thoroughly cleaning the work surface between reaction setups. Primer-design techniques are important in improving PCR product yield and in avoiding the formation of spurious products, and the usage of alternate buffer components or polymerase enzymes can help with amplification of long or otherwise problematic regions of DNA. Addition of reagents, such as [[formamide]], in buffer systems may increase the specificity and yield of PCR.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Applications==
===Selective DNA isolation===
PCR allows isolation of DNA fragments from genomic DNA by selective amplification of a specific region of DNA. This use of PCR augments many ways, such as generating [[hybridization probe]]s for [[Southern blot|Southern]] or [[Northern blot|northern]] hybridization and [[DNA cloning]], which require larger amounts of DNA, representing a specific DNA region. PCR supplies these techniques with high amounts of pure DNA, enabling analysis of DNA samples even from very small amounts of starting material.

Other applications of PCR include [[DNA sequencing]] to determine unknown PCR-amplified sequences in which one of the amplification primers may be used in [[Sanger sequencing]], isolation of a DNA sequence to expedite recombinant DNA technologies involving the insertion of a DNA sequence into a [[plasmid]], [[phage]], or [[cosmid]] (depending on size) or the genetic material of another organism. Bacterial colonies ''(such as [[Escherichia coli|E. coli]])'' can be rapidly screened by PCR for correct DNA [[plasmid|vector]] constructs.&lt;ref name=Hybrid&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Pavlov AR, Pavlova NV, Kozyavkin SA, Slesarev AI |year= 2006|chapter=Thermostable DNA Polymerases for a Wide Spectrum of Applications: Comparison of a Robust Hybrid TopoTaq to other enzymes|title=DNA Sequencing II: Optimizing Preparation and Cleanup|editor=Kieleczawa J|publisher=Jones and Bartlett|pages=241–257|isbn=978-0-7637-3383-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; PCR may also be used for [[genetic fingerprinting]]; a forensic technique used to identify a person or organism by comparing experimental DNAs through different PCR-based methods.

Some PCR 'fingerprints' methods have high discriminative power and can be used to identify genetic relationships between individuals, such as parent-child or between siblings, and are used in paternity testing (Fig. 4). This technique may also be used to determine evolutionary relationships among organisms when certain molecular clocks are used (i.e., the [[16S rRNA]] and recA genes of microorganisms).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pombert JF, Sistek V, Boissinot M, Frenette M |title=Evolutionary relationships among salivarius streptococci as inferred from multilocus phylogenies based on 16S rRNA-encoding, recA, secA, and secY gene sequences |journal=BMC Microbiol. |volume=9 |issue= |page=232 |year=2009 |pmid=19878555 |pmc=2777182 |doi=10.1186/1471-2180-9-232 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amplification and quantification of DNA===
{{See also|Use of DNA in forensic entomology}}
Because PCR amplifies the regions of DNA that it targets, PCR can be used to analyze extremely small amounts of sample. This is often critical for [[forensic analysis]], when only a trace amount of DNA is available as evidence. PCR may also be used in the analysis of [[ancient DNA]] that is tens of thousands of years old. These PCR-based techniques have been successfully used on animals, such as a forty-thousand-year-old [[mammoth]], and also on human DNA, in applications ranging from the analysis of Egyptian [[mummy|mummies]] to the identification of a [[Russia]]n [[tsar]] and the body of English king [[Richard III]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://photoscience.la.asu.edu/photosyn/courses/BIO_343/lecture/DNAtech.html| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19971009144333/http://photoscience.la.asu.edu/photosyn/courses/BIO_343/lecture/DNAtech.html| dead-url=yes| archive-date=9 October 1997| title=Chemical Synthesis, Sequencing, and Amplification of DNA (class notes on MBB/BIO 343)| publisher=Arizona State University| access-date=2007-10-29| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quantitative PCR]] or Real Time Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR&lt;ref&gt;"The MIQE guidelines: minimum information for publication of quantitative real-time PCR experiments." Clin Chem. 2009 Apr;55(4):611-22. {{PMID|19246619}} DOI: 10.1373/clinchem.2008.112797 http://clinchem.aaccjnls.org/content/55/4/611.long&lt;/ref&gt;) methods allow the estimation of the amount of a given sequence present in a sample—a technique often applied to quantitatively determine levels of [[gene expression]]. Quantitative PCR is an established tool for DNA quantification that measures the accumulation of DNA product after each round of PCR amplification.

RT-qPCR allows the quantification and detection of a specific DNA sequence in real time since it measures concentration while the synthesis process is taking place. There are two methods for simultaneous detection and quantification. The first method consists of using [[fluorophore|fluorescent]] dyes that are retained nonspecifically in between the double strands. The second method involves probes that code for specific sequences and are fluorescently labeled. Detection of DNA using these methods can only be seen after the hybridization of probes with its complementary DNA takes place. An interesting technique combination is real-time PCR and reverse transcription. This sophisticated technique allows for the quantification of a small quantity of RNA. Through this combined technique, mRNA is converted to cDNA, which is further quantified using qPCR. This technique lowers the possibility of error at the end point of PCR,&lt;ref name="Garibyan, Avashia 1–4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garibyan, Avashia|first=|date=March 2013|title=Polymerase Chain Reaction|journal=Journal of Investigative Dermatology|volume=133|issue=3|pages=1–4|doi=10.1038/jid.2013.1|pmid=23399825|pmc=4102308}}&lt;/ref&gt; increasing chances for detection of genes associated with genetic diseases such as cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/420027217|title=Fundamental laboratory approaches for biochemistry and biotechnology|last=P.|first=Ballou, David|last2=Marilee.|first2=Benore,|date=2010|publisher=John Wiley|isbn=9780470087664|oclc=420027217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laboratories use RT-qPCR for the purpose of sensitively measuring gene regulation.

===Medical applications===
Prospective parents can be tested for being [[genetic carrier]]s, or their children might be tested for actually being affected by a [[Cystic Fibrosis|disease]].&lt;ref name="Saiki1"/&gt; DNA samples for [[Prenatal diagnosis|prenatal testing]] can be obtained by [[amniocentesis]], [[chorionic villus sampling]], or even by the analysis of rare fetal cells circulating in the mother's bloodstream. PCR analysis is also essential to [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]], where individual cells of a developing embryo are tested for mutations.
* PCR can also be used as part of a sensitive test for ''[[tissue typing]]'', vital to [[organ transplantation]].  As of 2008, there is even a proposal to replace the traditional antibody-based tests for [[blood type]] with PCR-based tests.&lt;ref&gt;Quill E "Blood-Matching Goes Genetic" [[Science (journal)|Science Magazine]] (14 March 2008) pp. 1478–1479.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many forms of cancer involve alterations to ''[[oncogene]]s''.  By using PCR-based tests to study these mutations, therapy regimens can sometimes be individually customized to a patient. PCR permits early diagnosis of [[malignant]] diseases such as [[leukemia]] and [[lymphoma]]s, which is currently the highest-developed in cancer research and is already being used routinely. PCR assays can be performed directly on genomic DNA samples to detect translocation-specific malignant cells at a sensitivity that is at least 10,000 fold higher than that of other methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tomar|first1=Rukam|title=Molecular Markers and Plant Biotechnology|date=2010|publisher=New India Publishing Agency|location=Pitman Pura, New Delhi|isbn=978-93-80235-25-7|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; PCR is very useful in the medical field since it allows for the isolation and amplification of tumor suppressors. Quantitative PCR for example, can be used to quantify and analyze single cells, as well as recognize DNA, mRNA and protein confirmations and combinations.&lt;ref name="Garibyan, Avashia 1–4"/&gt;

===Infectious disease applications===
PCR allows for rapid and highly specific diagnosis of infectious diseases, including those caused by bacteria or viruses.&lt;ref name=Cai2014&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cai|first=H|author2=Caswell JL |author3=Prescott JF |title=Nonculture Molecular Techniques for Diagnosis of Bacterial Disease in Animals: A Diagnostic Laboratory Perspective|journal=Veterinary Pathology|date=March 2014|volume=51|issue=2|pages=341–350|doi=10.1177/0300985813511132|pmid=24569613|url=http://vet.sagepub.com/content/51/2/341.full}}&lt;/ref&gt; PCR also permits identification of non-cultivatable or slow-growing microorganisms such as [[mycobacterium|mycobacteria]], [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic bacteria]], or [[virus]]es from [[tissue culture]] assays and [[animal model]]s. The basis for PCR diagnostic applications in microbiology is the detection of infectious agents and the discrimination of non-pathogenic from pathogenic strains by virtue of specific genes.&lt;ref name="Cai2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Salis AD|year=2009|chapter=Applications in Clinical Microbiology|title=Real-Time PCR: Current Technology and Applications|publisher=Caister Academic Press|isbn=978-1-904455-39-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Characterization and detection of infectious disease organisms have been revolutionized by PCR in the following ways:

* The ''human immunodeficiency virus'' (or ''[[HIV]]''), is a difficult target to find and eradicate. The earliest tests for infection relied on the presence of antibodies to the virus circulating in the bloodstream.  However, antibodies don't appear until many weeks after infection, maternal antibodies mask the infection of a newborn, and therapeutic agents to fight the infection don't affect the antibodies.  PCR [[HIV test|tests]] have been developed that can detect as little as one viral genome among the DNA of over 50,000 host cells.&lt;ref&gt;Kwok S et al. "Identification of HIV sequences by using in vitro enzymatic amplification and oligomer cleavage detection." J. Virol. vol. 61(5) pp. 1690–4 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;  Infections can be detected earlier, donated blood can be screened directly for the virus, newborns can be immediately tested for infection, and the effects of antiviral treatments can be [[Viral load|quantified]].
* Some disease organisms, such as that for ''[[tuberculosis]]'', are difficult to sample from patients and slow to be [[Tuberculosis diagnosis|grown]] in the laboratory.  PCR-based tests have allowed detection of small numbers of disease organisms (both live or dead), in convenient [[Sputum|samples]].  Detailed genetic analysis can also be used to detect antibiotic resistance, allowing immediate and effective therapy.  The effects of therapy can also be immediately evaluated.
* The spread of a ''[[Influenza|disease]] organism'' through populations of [[Chicken|domestic]] or [[Goose|wild]] animals can be monitored by PCR testing.  In many cases, the appearance of new virulent [[H5N1|sub-types]] can be detected and monitored.  The sub-types of an organism that were responsible for [[Influenza pandemic|earlier epidemics]] can also be determined by PCR analysis.
*Viral DNA can be detected by PCR. The primers used must be specific to the targeted sequences in the DNA of a virus, and PCR can be used for diagnostic analyses or DNA sequencing of the viral genome. The high sensitivity of PCR permits virus detection soon after infection and even before the onset of disease.&lt;ref name="Cai2014"/&gt; Such early detection may give physicians a significant lead time in treatment. The amount of virus ("[[viral load]]") in a patient can also be quantified by PCR-based DNA quantitation techniques (see below).
*Diseases such as pertussis (or whooping cough) are cause by the bacteria Bordetella pertussis. This bacteria is marked by a serious acute respiratory infection that affects various animals and humans and has led to the deaths of many young children. The pertussis toxin is a protein exotoxin that binds to cell receptors by two dimers and reacts with different cell types such as T lymphocytes which plays a role in cell immunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7813/|title=Medical Microbiology|last=Finger|first=Horst|last2=von Koenig|first2=Carl Heinz Wirsing|date=1996|publisher=University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston|isbn=978-0963117212|editor-last=Baron|editor-first=Samuel|edition=4th|location=Galveston (TX)|pmid=21413270}}&lt;/ref&gt; PCR is an important testing tool that can detect the sequences that are within the pertussis toxin gene. This is because PCR has a high sensitivity for the toxin and has demonstrated a rapid turnaround time. PCR is very efficient for diagnosing pertussis when compared to culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781437701265000033|title=Netter's Infectious Diseases|last=Yeh|first=Sylvia H.|last2=Mink|first2=ChrisAnna M.|date=|publisher=|year=2012|isbn=|editor-last=|editor-first=|edition=|location=|pages=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forensic applications===
The development of PCR-based [[Genetic fingerprinting|genetic]] (or [[DNA fingerprinting|DNA]]) fingerprinting protocols has seen widespread application in [[forensics]]:

* In its most discriminating form, ''[[genetic fingerprinting]]'' can uniquely discriminate any one person from the entire population of the [[Earth|world]].  Minute samples of DNA can be isolated from a [[O. J. Simpson murder case|crime scene]], and [[Combined DNA Index System|compared]] to that from suspects, or from a [[National DNA database|DNA database]] of earlier evidence or convicts.  Simpler versions of these tests are often used to rapidly rule out suspects during a criminal investigation.  Evidence from decades-old crimes can be tested, confirming or [[Innocence Project|exonerating]] the people originally convicted.
* Forensic DNA typing has been an effective way of identifying or exonerating criminal suspects due to analysis of evidence discovered at a crime scene. The human genome has many repetitive regions that can be found within gene sequences or in non-coding regions of the genome. Specifically, up to 40% of human DNA is repetitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fundamental Laboratory Approaches for Biochemistry and Biotechnology|last=Ninfa|first=Alexander|last2=Ballou|first2=David P.|last3=Benore|first3=Marilee|publisher=Wiley|year=2009|isbn=9780470087664|location=United States|pages=408–410}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two distinct categories for these repetitive, non-coding regions in the genome. The first category is called variable number tandem repeats (VNTR), which are 10-100 base pairs long and the second category is called short tandem repeats (STR) and these consist of repeated 2-10 base pair sections.  PCR is used to amplify several well-known VNTRs and STRs using primers that flank each of the repetitive regions. The sizes of the fragments obtained from any individual for each of the STRs will indicate which alleles are present. By analyzing several STRs for an individual, a set of alleles for each person will be found that statistically is likely to be unique.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fundamental Laboratory Approaches for Biochemistry and Biotechnology|last=Ninfa|first=Alexander|last2=Ballou|first2=David|last3=Benore|first3=Marilee|publisher=Wiley|year=2009|isbn=978-0470087664|location=United States|pages=408–410}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers have identified the complete sequence of the human genome. This sequence can be easily accessed through the NCBI website and is used in many real-life applications. For example, the FBI has compiled a set of DNA marker sites used for identification, and these are called the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) DNA database.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Using this database enables statistical analysis to be used to determine the probability that a DNA sample will match.  PCR is a very powerful and significant analytical tool to use for forensic DNA typing because researchers only need a very small amount of the target DNA to be used for analysis. For example, a single human hair with attached hair follicle has enough DNA to conduct the analysis. Similarly, a few sperm, skin samples from under the fingernails, or a small amount of blood can provide enough DNA for conclusive analysis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Less discriminating forms of [[DNA fingerprinting]] can help in ''[[DNA paternity testing]]'', where an individual is matched with their close relatives.  DNA from unidentified human remains can be tested, and compared with that from possible parents, siblings, or children.  Similar testing can be used to confirm the biological parents of an adopted (or kidnapped) child.  The actual biological father of a [[Anna Nicole Smith|newborn]] can also be [[DNA paternity testing|confirmed]] (or ruled out).
* The PCR AMGX/AMGY design has been shown to not only facilitating in amplifying DNA sequences from a very minuscule amount of genome. However it can also be used for real time sex determination from forensic bone samples. This provides us with a powerful and effective way to determine the sex of not only ancient specimens but also current suspects in crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2004-01-28|title=Real-time PCR designs to estimate nuclear and mitochondrial DNA copy number in forensic and ancient DNA studies|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0379073803004237|journal=Forensic Science International|volume=139|issue=2–3|pages=141–149|doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2003.10.008|pmid=15040907|issn=0379-0738 | last1 = Alonso | first1 = A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research applications===
PCR has been applied to many areas of research in molecular genetics:

* PCR allows rapid production of short pieces of DNA, even when not more than the sequence of the two primers is known.  This ability of PCR augments many methods, such as generating ''[[Nucleic acid hybridization|hybridization]] [[Hybridization probe|probes]]'' for [[Southern blot|Southern]] or [[northern blot]] hybridization.  PCR supplies these techniques with large amounts of pure DNA, sometimes as a single strand, enabling analysis even from very small amounts of starting material.
* The task of ''[[DNA sequencing]]'' can also be assisted by PCR.  Known segments of DNA can easily be produced from a patient with a genetic disease mutation.  Modifications to the amplification technique can extract segments from a completely unknown genome, or can generate just a single strand of an area of interest.
* PCR has numerous applications to the more traditional process of ''[[DNA cloning]]''.  It can extract segments for insertion into a vector from a larger genome, which may be only available in small quantities.  Using a single set of 'vector primers', it can also analyze or extract fragments that have already been inserted into vectors.  Some alterations to the PCR protocol can ''generate mutations'' (general or site-directed) of an inserted fragment.
* ''[[Sequence-tagged site]]s'' is a process where PCR is used as an indicator that a particular segment of a genome is present in a particular clone.  The [[Human Genome Project]] found this application vital to mapping the cosmid clones they were sequencing, and to coordinating the results from different laboratories.
* An exciting application of PCR is the [[Phylogeny|phylogenic]] analysis of DNA from ''[[Ancient DNA|ancient sources]]'', such as that found in the recovered bones of [[Neanderthal]]s, from frozen tissues of [[mammoth]]s, or from the brain of Egyptian mummies. Have been amplified and sequenced.&lt;ref name="Schochetman 1988 1154–1157"/&gt; In some cases the highly degraded DNA from these sources might be reassembled during the early stages of amplification.
* A common application of PCR is the study of patterns of ''[[gene expression]]''.  Tissues (or even individual cells) can be analyzed at different stages to see which genes have become active, or which have been switched off.  This application can also use [[quantitative PCR]] to quantitate the actual levels of expression
* The ability of PCR to simultaneously amplify several loci from individual sperm&lt;ref&gt;Boehnke M et al. "Fine-structure genetic mapping of human chromosomes using the polymerase chain reaction on single sperm." Am J Hum Genet vol. 45(1) pp. 21–32 (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; has greatly enhanced the more traditional task of ''[[Genetic linkage|genetic mapping]]'' by studying [[chromosomal crossover]]s after [[meiosis]].  Rare crossover events between very close loci have been directly observed by analyzing thousands of individual sperms.  Similarly, unusual deletions, insertions, translocations, or inversions can be analyzed, all without having to wait (or pay) for the long and laborious processes of fertilization, embryogenesis, etc.

==Advantages ==
PCR has a number of advantages. It is fairly simple to understand and to use, and produces results rapidly. The technique is highly sensitive with the potential to produce millions to billions of copies of a specific product for sequencing, cloning, and analysis. qRT-PCR shares the same advantages as the PCR, with an added advantage of quantification of the synthesized product. Therefore, it has its uses to analyze alterations of gene expression levels in tumors, microbes, or other disease states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garibyan|first=Lilit|last2=Avashia|first2=Nidhi|date=2013-03-01|title=Polymerase Chain Reaction|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022202X1536139X|journal=Journal of Investigative Dermatology|language=English|volume=133|issue=3|pages=1–4|doi=10.1038/jid.2013.1|issn=0022-202X|pmc=4102308|pmid=23399825}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PCR is a very powerful and practical research tool. The sequencing of unknown etiologies of many diseases are being figured out by the PCR. The technique can help identify the sequence of previously unknown viruses related to those already known and thus give us a better understanding of the disease itself. If the procedure can be further simplified and sensitive non radiometric detection systems can be developed, the PCR will assume a prominent place in the clinical laboratory for years to come.&lt;ref name="Schochetman 1988 1154–1157"/&gt;

==Limitations==
One major limitation of PCR is that prior information about the target sequence is necessary in order to generate the primers that will allow its selective amplification.&lt;ref name="10.1038/jid.2013.1"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Garibyan L, Avashia N | title = Polymerase Chain Reaction | journal = Journal of Investigative Dermatology | volume = 133 | issue = 3 | date = 2013 | doi = 10.1038/jid.2013.1 | pages=1–4 | pmid=23399825 | pmc=4102308}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that, typically, PCR users must know the precise sequence(s) upstream of the target region on each of the two single-stranded templates in order to ensure that the DNA polymerase properly binds to the primer-template hybrids and subsequently generates the entire target region during DNA synthesis.

Like all enzymes, DNA polymerases are also prone to error, which in turn causes mutations in the PCR fragments that are generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhou|first=Y H|last2=Zhang|first2=X P|last3=Ebright|first3=R H|date=1991-11-11|title=Random mutagenesis of gene-sized DNA molecules by use of PCR with Taq DNA polymerase|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=19|issue=21|pages=6052|issn=0305-1048|pmc=329070|pmid=1658751|doi=10.1093/nar/19.21.6052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another limitation of PCR is that even the smallest amount of contaminating DNA can be amplified, resulting in misleading or ambiguous results. To minimize the chance of contamination, investigators should reserve separate rooms for reagent preparation, the PCR, and analysis of product. Reagents should be dispensed into single-use aliquots. Pipetters with disposable plungers and extra-long pipette tips should be routinely used.&lt;ref name="Schochetman 1988 1154–1157"/&gt;

==Variations==
{{Main|Variants of PCR}}
* ''Allele-specific PCR'': a diagnostic or cloning technique based on single-nucleotide variations (SNVs not to be confused with [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNPs]]) (single-base differences in a patient). It requires prior knowledge of a DNA sequence, including differences between [[allele]]s, and uses primers whose 3' ends encompass the SNV (base pair buffer around SNV usually incorporated). PCR amplification under stringent conditions is much less efficient in the presence of a mismatch between template and primer, so successful amplification with an SNP-specific primer signals presence of the specific SNP in a sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Newton CR, Graham A, Heptinstall LE, Powell SJ, Summers C, Kalsheker N, Smith JC, Markham AF | title=Analysis of any point mutation in DNA.

* ''[[Polymerase cycling assembly|Assembly PCR]]'' or ''Polymerase Cycling Assembly (PCA)'': artificial synthesis of long DNA sequences by performing PCR on a pool of long oligonucleotides with short overlapping segments. The oligonucleotides alternate between sense and antisense directions, and the overlapping segments determine the order of the PCR fragments, thereby selectively producing the final long DNA product.&lt;ref name="Stemmer et al."&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Stemmer WP, Crameri A, Ha KD, Brennan TM, Heyneker HL |year= 1995|title=Single-step assembly of a gene and entire plasmid from large numbers of oligodeoxyribonucleotides|journal=Gene|volume=164|pages=49–53|pmid=7590320 | doi = 10.1016/0378-1119(95)00511-4|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Asymmetric PCR]]'': preferentially amplifies one DNA strand in a double-stranded DNA template. It is used in [[sequencing]] and hybridization probing where amplification of only one of the two complementary strands is required. PCR is carried out as usual, but with a great excess of the primer for the strand targeted for amplification. Because of the slow ([[arithmetic]]) amplification later in the reaction after the limiting primer has been used up, extra cycles of PCR are required.&lt;ref name="Innis et al."&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Innis MA, Myambo KB, Gelfand DH, Brow MA |year= 1988|title=DNA sequencing with Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase and direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA|volume=85|pages=9436–9440|pmid=3200828 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.85.24.9436|issue=24|pmc=282767}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent modification on this process, known as ''L''inear-''A''fter-''T''he-''E''xponential-PCR (LATE-PCR), uses a limiting primer with a higher melting temperature ([[DNA melting|Tm]]) than the excess primer to maintain reaction efficiency as the limiting primer concentration decreases mid-reaction.&lt;ref name="Pierce and Wangh"&gt;{{Cite book|vauthors=Pierce KE, Wangh LJ|lastauthoramp=yes |year= 2007|title=Linear-after-the-exponential polymerase chain reaction and allied technologies Real-time detection strategies for rapid, reliable diagnosis from single cells |journal=Methods Mol Med. |volume=132 |pages=65–85 |pmid=17876077 |doi=10.1007/978-1-59745-298-4_7 |series=Methods in Molecular Medicine™ |isbn=978-1-58829-578-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Convective PCR'': a pseudo-isothermal way of performing PCR. Instead of repeatedly heating and cooling the PCR mixture, the solution is subjected to a thermal gradient. The resulting thermal instability driven convective flow automatically shuffles the PCR reagents from the hot and cold regions repeatedly enabling PCR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krishnan|first1=Madhavi|last2=Ugaz|first2=Victor|last3=Burns|first3=Mark|title=PCR in a Rayleigh-Benard convection cell|journal=Science|date=2002|issue=298.5594|pages=793}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parameters such as thermal boundary conditions and  geometry of the PCR enclosure can be optimized to yield robust and rapid PCR by harnessing the emergence of chaotic flow fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Priye|first1=Aashish|last2=Hassan|first2=Yassin|last3=Ugaz|first3=Victor|title=Microscale chaotic advection enables robust convective DNA replication|journal=Analytical Chemistry|date=2013|issue=21|pages=10536–10541|doi=10.1021/ac402611s|pmid=24083802|volume=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such convective flow PCR setup significantly reduces device power requirement and operation time.
* ''Dial-out PCR'': a highly parallel method for retrieving accurate DNA molecules for gene synthesis. A complex library of DNA molecules is modified with unique flanking tags before massively parallel sequencing. Tag-directed primers then enable the retrieval of molecules with desired sequences by PCR.&lt;ref name="Schwartz et al."&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Schwartz JJ, Lee C, Shendure J |title=Accurate gene synthesis with tag-directed retrieval of sequence-verified DNA molecules |journal=Nature Methods |volume=9|pages=913–915 |year=2012|doi = 10.1038/nmeth.2137|pmid=22886093|issue=9|pmc=3433648}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Digital PCR]] (dPCR)'': used to measure the quantity of a target DNA sequence in a DNA sample. The DNA sample is highly diluted so that after running many PCRs in parallel, some of them do not receive a single molecule of the target DNA. The target DNA concentration is calculated using the proportion of negative outcomes. Hence the name 'digital PCR'.
* ''[[Helicase-dependent amplification]]'': similar to traditional PCR, but uses a constant temperature rather than cycling through denaturation and annealing/extension cycles. [[DNA helicase]], an enzyme that unwinds DNA, is used in place of thermal denaturation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Helicase-dependent isothermal DNA amplification|vauthors = Vincent M, Xu Y, Kong H | journal=EMBO Reports| year=2004| volume=5| issue=8| pages=795–800| doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400200| pmid=15247927| pmc=1249482}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Hot start PCR]]'': a technique that reduces non-specific amplification during the initial set up stages of the PCR. It may be performed manually by heating the reaction components to the denaturation temperature (e.g., 95&amp;nbsp;°C) before adding the polymerase.&lt;ref name=general_hot_start&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Nucleic Acids Research| title=Prevention of pre-PCR mis-priming and primer dimerization improves low-copy-number amplifications| year=1992| volume=20| pages=1717–1723| vauthors = Chou Q, Russell M, Birch DE, Raymond J, Bloch W | doi = 10.1093/nar/20.7.1717| pmid=1579465| issue=7| pmc=312262}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specialized enzyme systems have been developed that inhibit the polymerase's activity at ambient temperature, either by the binding of an [[antibody]]&lt;ref name=antibody_hot_start /&gt;&lt;ref name="antibody_hot_start_2 "&gt;{{cite journal| pmid=8074881| year=1994| last1=Kellogg| first1=DE| last2=Rybalkin| first2=I| last3=Chen| first3=S| last4=Mukhamedova| first4=N| last5=Vlasik| first5=T| last6=Siebert| first6=PD| last7=Chenchik| first7=A| title=TaqStart Antibody: "hot start" PCR facilitated by a neutralizing monoclonal antibody directed against Taq DNA polymerase| volume=16| issue=6| pages=1134–7| journal=BioTechniques}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by the presence of covalently bound inhibitors that dissociate only after a high-temperature activation step. Hot-start/cold-finish PCR is achieved with new hybrid polymerases that are inactive at ambient temperature and are instantly activated at elongation temperature.
* ''[[In silico PCR]]'' (digital PCR, virtual PCR, electronic PCR, e-PCR) refers to computational tools used to calculate theoretical polymerase chain reaction results using a given set of [[Primer (molecular biology)|primers]] ([[Hybridization probe|probes]]) to amplify [[DNA]] sequences from a sequenced [[genome]] or [[transcriptome]]. In silico PCR was proposed as an educational tool for molecular biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=San Millan RM, Martinez-Ballesteros I, Rementeria A, Garaizar J, Bikandi J |year=2013|title=Online exercise for the design and simulation of PCR and PCR-RFLP experiments|journal=BMC Research Notes|volume=6|page=513|pmid=24314313| doi = 10.1186/1756-0500-6-513|pmc=4029544}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Intersequence-specific PCR'' (ISSR): a PCR method for DNA fingerprinting that amplifies regions between simple sequence repeats to produce a unique fingerprint of amplified fragment lengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Genome fingerprinting by simple sequence repeat (SSR)-anchored polymerase chain reaction amplification|author1=Zietkiewicz, E. |author2=Rafalski, A. |author3=Labuda, D. | journal=Genomics| year=1994| volume=20| issue=2| pages=176–83 | doi = 10.1006/geno.1994.1151|pmid=8020964}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Inverse polymerase chain reaction|Inverse PCR]]'': is commonly used to identify the flanking sequences around [[genomic]] inserts. It involves a series of [[Restriction digest|DNA digestions]] and [[self ligation]], resulting in known sequences at either end of the unknown sequence.&lt;ref name="Ochman et al."&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Ochman H, Gerber AS, Hartl DL |year= 1988|title=Genetic Applications of an Inverse Polymerase Chain Reaction|journal=Genetics|volume=120|pages=621–623|pmid=2852134|issue=3|pmc=1203539}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Ligation-mediated PCR'': uses small DNA linkers ligated to the DNA of interest and multiple primers annealing to the DNA linkers; it has been used for [[DNA sequencing]], [[genome walking]], and [[DNA footprinting]].&lt;ref name="Mueller and Wold "&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Mueller PR, Wold B |year= 1988|title=''In vivo'' footprinting of a muscle specific enhancer by ligation mediated PCR|journal=Science|volume=246|pages=780–786|pmid=2814500|doi=10.1126/science.2814500|issue=4931}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Methylation-specific PCR]]'' (MSP): developed by [[Stephen Baylin]] and [[Jim Herman]] at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Methylation-specific PCR: a novel PCR assay for methylation status of CpG islands|vauthors=Herman JG, Graff JR, Myöhänen S, Nelkin BD, Baylin SB | journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA| year=1996| volume=93| issue=13| pages=9821–9826|pmid=8790415 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.93.18.9821|pmc=38513}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is used to detect methylation of CpG islands in genomic DNA. DNA is first treated with sodium bisulfite, which converts unmethylated cytosine bases to uracil, which is recognized by PCR primers as thymine. Two PCRs are then carried out on the modified DNA, using primer sets identical except at any CpG islands within the primer sequences. At these points, one primer set recognizes DNA with cytosines to amplify methylated DNA, and one set recognizes DNA with uracil or thymine to amplify unmethylated DNA. MSP using qPCR can also be performed to obtain quantitative rather than qualitative information about methylation.
* ''Miniprimer PCR'': uses a thermostable polymerase (S-Tbr) that can extend from short primers ("smalligos") as short as 9 or 10 nucleotides. This method permits PCR targeting to smaller primer binding regions, and is used to amplify conserved DNA sequences, such as the 16S (or eukaryotic 18S) rRNA gene.&lt;ref name="Isenbarger ''et al.''."&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Isenbarger TA, Finney M, Ríos-Velázquez C, Handelsman J, Ruvkun G |year= 2008|title= Miniprimer PCR, a New Lens for Viewing the Microbial World|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|volume=74|pages=840–9|pmid=18083877|doi= 10.1128/AEM.01933-07|issue=3|pmc=2227730}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification]]'' (''MLPA''): permits amplifying multiple targets with a single primer pair, thus avoiding the resolution limitations of multiplex PCR (see below).
* ''[[Multiplex-PCR]]'': consists of multiple primer sets within a single PCR mixture to produce [[amplicon]]s of varying sizes that are specific to different DNA sequences. By targeting multiple genes at once, additional information may be gained from a single test-run that otherwise would require several times the reagents and more time to perform. Annealing temperatures for each of the primer sets must be optimized to work correctly within a single reaction, and amplicon sizes. That is, their base pair length should be different enough to form distinct bands when visualized by [[gel electrophoresis]].
* ''Nanoparticle-Assisted PCR (nanoPCR)'': In recent years, it has been reported that some nanoparticles (NPs) can enhance the efficiency of PCR (thus being called nanoPCR), and some even perform better than the original PCR enhancers. It was also found that quantum dots (QDs) can improve PCR specificity and efficiency. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are efficient in enhancing the amplification of long PCR. Carbon nanopowder (CNP) was reported be able to improve the efficiency of repeated PCR and long PCR. ZnO, TiO&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt;, and Ag NPs were also found to increase PCR yield. Importantly, already known data has indicated that non-metallic NPs retained acceptable amplification fidelity. Given that many NPs are capable of enhancing PCR efficiency, it is clear that there is likely to be great potential for nanoPCR technology improvements and product development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=NanoPCR observation: different levels of DNA replication fidelity in nanoparticle-enhanced polymerase chain reactions|journal=Nanotechnology|year=2009|author1=Cenchao Shen |author2=Wenjuan Yang |author3=Qiaoli Ji |author4=Hisaji Maki |author5=Anjie Dong |author6=Zhizhou Zhang |volume=20|issue=45|page=455103|doi=10.1088/0957-4484/20/45/455103|pmid=19822925}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shen|first=Cenchao|title=An Overview of Nanoparticle‐Assisted Polymerase Chain Reaction Technology|year=2013|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell Publishing Ltd.|location=US|pages=97–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Nested PCR]]'': increases the specificity of DNA amplification, by reducing background due to non-specific amplification of DNA. Two sets of primers are used in two successive PCRs. In the first reaction, one pair of primers is used to generate DNA products, which besides the intended target, may still consist of non-specifically amplified DNA fragments. The product(s) are then used in a second PCR with a set of primers whose binding sites are completely or partially different from and located 3' of each of the primers used in the first reaction. Nested PCR is often more successful in specifically amplifying long DNA fragments than conventional PCR, but it requires more detailed knowledge of the target sequences.
* ''[[Overlap-extension PCR]]'' or ''Splicing by overlap extension (SOEing) '': a [[genetic engineering]] technique that is used to splice together two or more DNA fragments that contain complementary sequences. It is used to join DNA pieces containing genes, regulatory sequences, or mutations; the technique enables creation of specific and long DNA constructs. It can also introduce deletions, insertions or point mutations into a DNA sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Engineering hybrid genes without the use of restriction enzymes: gene splicing by overlap exten-sion|journal=Gene|year=1989|vauthors=Horton RM, Hunt HD, Ho SN, Pullen JK, Pease LR |volume=77|pages=61–68|doi=10.1016/0378-1119(89)90359-4|pmid=2744488|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moller|first=Simon|title=PCR (THE BASICS)|year=2006|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Group|location=US|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''[[quantitative PCR]]'' (qPCR): used to measure the quantity of a target sequence (commonly in real-time). It quantitatively measures starting amounts of DNA, cDNA, or RNA. [[quantitative PCR]] is commonly used to determine whether a DNA sequence is present in a sample and the number of its copies in the sample. ''Quantitative PCR'' has a very high degree of precision. Quantitative PCR methods use fluorescent dyes, such as Sybr Green, EvaGreen or [[fluorophore]]-containing DNA probes, such as [[TaqMan]], to measure the amount of amplified product in real time. It is also sometimes abbreviated to [[Quantitative PCR|RT-PCR]] (''real-time'' PCR) but this abbreviation should be used only for [[Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction|reverse transcription PCR]]. qPCR is the appropriate contractions for [[quantitative PCR]] (real-time PCR).
* ''Reverse Transcription PCR ([[RT-PCR]])'': for amplifying DNA from RNA. [[Reverse transcriptase]] reverse transcribes [[RNA]] into [[cDNA]], which is then amplified by PCR. RT-PCR is widely used in [[expression profiling]], to determine the expression of a gene or to identify the sequence of an RNA transcript, including transcription start and termination sites. If the genomic DNA sequence of a gene is known, RT-PCR can be used to map the location of [[exons]] and [[introns]] in the gene. The 5' end of a gene (corresponding to the transcription start site) is typically identified by [[RACE (biology)|RACE-PCR]] (''Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends'').
* ''[[RNase H-dependent PCR]]'' (rhPCR): a modification of PCR that utilizes primers with a 3’ extension block that can be removed by a thermostable RNase HII enzyme.  This system reduces primer-dimers and allows for multiplexed reactions to be performed with higher numbers of primers.&lt;ref name="dobosy_2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dobosy JR, Rose SD, Beltz KR, Rupp SM, Powers KM, Behlke MA, Walder JA | title = RNase H-dependent PCR (rhPCR): improved specificity and single nucleotide polymorphism detection using blocked cleavable primers | journal = BMC Biotechnology | volume = 11 | pages = 80 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21831278 | doi = 10.1186/1472-6750-11-80 | pmc=3224242}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Single Specific Primer-PCR]]'' (SSP-PCR): allows the amplification of double-stranded DNA even when the sequence information is available at one end only. This method permits amplification of genes for which only a partial sequence information is available, and allows unidirectional genome walking from known into unknown regions of the chromosome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Shyamala|first1=V.|last2=Ferro-Luzzi|first2=Ames G.|title=Single Specific Primer-Polymerase Chain Reaction (SSP-PCR) and Genome Walking|journal=Methods in Molecular Biology|date=1993|volume=15|pages=339–48|doi=10.1385/0-89603-244-2:339|pmid=21400290|isbn=978-0-89603-244-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Suicide PCR'': typically used in [[paleogenetics]] or other studies where avoiding false positives and ensuring the specificity of the amplified fragment is the highest priority. It was originally described in a study to verify the presence of the microbe [[Yersinia pestis]] in dental samples obtained from 14th Century graves of people supposedly killed by plague during the medieval [[Black Death]] epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method prescribes the use of any primer combination only once in a PCR (hence the term "suicide"), which should never have been used in any positive control PCR reaction, and the primers should always target a genomic region never amplified before in the lab using this or any other set of primers. This ensures that no contaminating DNA from previous PCR reactions is present in the lab, which could otherwise generate false positives.

* ''Thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR (TAIL-PCR)'': for isolation of an unknown sequence flanking a known sequence. Within the known sequence, TAIL-PCR uses a nested pair of primers with differing annealing temperatures; a degenerate primer is used to amplify in the other direction from the unknown sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR: automatable amplification and sequencing of insert end fragments from P1 and YAC clones for chromosome walking|author1=Y.G.

[[File:Primers RevComp.svg|thumb|Diagrammatic representation of an example primer pair. The use of primers in an in vitro assay to allow DNA synthesis was a major innovation that allowed the development of PCR.]]
{{Main|History of polymerase chain reaction}}
A 1971 paper in the ''[[Journal of Molecular Biology]]'' by {{Interlanguage link multi|Kjell Kleppe|no}} and co-workers in the laboratory of [[Har Gobind Khorana|H. Gobind Khorana]] first described a method of using an enzymatic assay to replicate a short DNA template with primers ''in vitro''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kleppe K, Ohtsuka E, Kleppe R, Molineux I, Khorana HG |year=1971|title=Studies on polynucleotides.

&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Baby Blue - a prototype polymerase chain reaction (PCR), c 1986. (9663810586).jpg|thumb|right|"Baby Blue", a 1986 prototype machine for doing PCR]]
When Mullis developed the PCR in 1983, he was working in [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]], California for [[Cetus Corporation]], one of the first [[biotechnology]] companies, where he was responsible for synthesizing short chains of DNA. Mullis has written that he first conceived the idea for PCR while cruising along the [[California State Route 1|Pacific Coast Highway]] one night in his car.&lt;ref name=Mullis&gt;{{cite book |last=Mullis|first=Kary|authorlink=Kary Mullis|year=1998|title=Dancing Naked in the Mind Field|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-679-44255-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was playing in his mind with a new way of analyzing changes (mutations) in DNA when he realized that he had instead invented a method of amplifying any DNA region through repeated cycles of duplication driven by DNA polymerase. In ''[[Scientific American]]'', Mullis summarized the procedure: "Beginning with a single molecule of the genetic material DNA, the PCR can generate 100 billion similar molecules in an afternoon. The reaction is easy to execute. It requires no more than a test tube, a few simple reagents, and a source of heat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mullis|first=Kary|year=1990|title=The unusual origin of the polymerase chain reaction|url=|journal=Scientific American|volume=262|issue=4|pages=56–61, 64–5|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0490-56|pmid=2315679}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA fingerprinting first become used for [[paternity testing]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Patidar|first1=Madhvika|last2=Agrawal|first2=Suraksha|last3=Parveen|first3=Farah|last4=Khare|first4=Parul|title=Molecular insights of saliva in solving paternity dispute|journal=Journal of Forensic Dental Sciences|date=2015|volume=7|issue=1|pages=76–79|doi=10.4103/0975-1475.150325|issn=0975-1475|pmc=4330625|pmid=25709326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mullis was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1993 for his invention, seven years after he and his colleagues at Cetus first put his proposal to practice.&lt;ref name="Kary Mullis Nobel Lecture"/&gt; Mullis’s 1985 paper with R. K. Saiki and H. A. Erlich, “Enzymatic Amplification of β-globin Genomic Sequences and Restriction Site Analysis for Diagnosis of Sickle Cell Anemia”—the polymerase chain reaction invention (PCR) -- was honored by a Citation for Chemical Breakthrough Award from the Division of History of Chemistry of the American Chemical Society in 2017.&lt;ref name="breakthrough"&gt;{{cite web|title=Citations for Chemical Breakthrough Awards  2017 Awardees|url=http://www.scs.illinois.edu/~mainzv/HIST/awards/CCB-2017_Awardees.php|website=Division of the History of Chemistry|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saiki|first1=R.|last2=Scharf|first2=S|last3=Faloona|first3=F|last4=Mullis|first4=K.|last5=Horn|first5=G.|last6=Erlich|first6=H.|last7=Arnheim|first7=N|title=Enzymatic amplification of beta-globin genomic sequences and restriction site analysis for diagnosis of sickle cell anemia|journal=Science|date=20 December 1985|volume=230|issue=4732|pages=1350–1354|doi=10.1126/science.2999980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some controversies have remained about the intellectual and practical contributions of other scientists to Mullis' work, and whether he had been the sole inventor of the PCR principle (see below).

At the core of the PCR method is the use of a suitable [[DNA polymerase]] able to withstand the high temperatures of &gt;{{convert|90|°C|°F|abbr=on}} required for separation of the two DNA strands in the [[DNA double helix]] after each [[DNA replication|replication]] cycle. The DNA polymerases initially employed for [[in vitro]] experiments presaging PCR were unable to withstand these high temperatures.&lt;ref name="Saiki1"/&gt; So the early procedures for DNA replication were very inefficient and time-consuming, and required large amounts of DNA polymerase and continuous handling throughout the process.

The discovery in 1976 of [[Taq polymerase]]—a DNA polymerase purified from the [[Thermophile|thermophilic bacterium]], ''[[Thermus aquaticus]]'', which naturally lives in hot ({{convert|50|to|80|C|F}}) environments&lt;ref name="Chien et al."/&gt; such as hot springs—paved the way for dramatic improvements of the PCR method. The DNA polymerase isolated from ''T. aquaticus'' is stable at high temperatures remaining active even after DNA denaturation,&lt;ref name="Lawyer et al."/&gt; thus obviating the need to add new DNA polymerase after each cycle.&lt;ref name="Saiki2"/&gt; This allowed an automated thermocycler-based process for DNA amplification.

===Patent disputes===
The PCR technique was patented by [[Kary Mullis]] and assigned to [[Cetus Corporation]], where Mullis worked when he invented the technique in 1983. The ''Taq'' polymerase enzyme was also covered by patents. There have been several high-profile lawsuits related to the technique, including an unsuccessful lawsuit brought by [[DuPont]]. The pharmaceutical company [[Hoffmann-La Roche]] purchased the rights to the patents in 1992 and currently holds those that are still protected.

A related patent battle over the Taq polymerase enzyme is still ongoing in several jurisdictions around the world between Roche and [[Promega]]. The legal arguments have extended beyond the lives of the original PCR and Taq polymerase patents, which expired on March 28, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genengnews.com/articles/chitem.aspx?aid=1656&amp;chid=0 Advice on How to Survive the Taq Wars ¶2]: GEN Genetic Engineering News – Biobusiness Channel: Article.

'''Preference elicitation''' refers to the problem of developing a [[decision support system]] capable of generating [[recommender system|recommendations]] to a user, thus assisting in decision making. It is important for such a system to model user's preferences accurately, find hidden preferences and avoid redundancy. This problem is sometimes studied as a computational learning theory problem. Another approach for formulating this problem is a [[partially observable Markov decision process]]. The formulation of this problem is also dependent upon the context of the area in which it is studied.

==Overview==
With the explosion of on-line information new opportunities for finding and using electronic data have been generated, these changes have also brought the task of eliciting useful information to the forefront. Researchers as well as major online catalog companies have come up with algorithms and [[prototype]]s of systems that can aid a user to be able to navigate through a complex and huge information space using some information from the user in the form of answers to certain queries or ratings to certain items etc. depending upon the domain of the information space.

'''Promega Corporation'''  is a manufacturer of  enzymes and other products for biotechnology and molecular biology with a portfolio covering the fields of genomics, protein analysis and expression, cellular analysis, drug discovery and genetic identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.promega.com/aboutus/company-information/ |title=Company Information|work= |accessdate=January 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History ==
Promega Corporation was founded by  Bill Linton in 1978 to provide  restriction enzymes for biotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.promega.com/enotes/features/fe0016_tabs.htm |title=Promega eNotes - Feature |work= |accessdate=November 11, 2008 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704152116/http://www.promega.com/enotes/features/fe0016_tabs.htm |archivedate=July 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company now offers more than 3,000 life science products used by scientists, researchers and life science and pharmaceutical companies. Promega has 1,200 employees, including nearly 700 at the headquarters location in Fitchburg, WI. In 2011, sales were approximately $300 million.&lt;ref name=wiscstatejournal&gt;{{cite web |url=http://host.madison.com/wsj/business/building-on-success-promega-corp-has-blossomed-and-it-s/article_43e85c46-913a-11e1-b7af-001a4bcf887a.html |title=Building on success: Promega corp. has blossomed, and it's not done growing yet |work= |accessdate=January 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The privately held company  has branch offices in 15 countries and more than 50 global distributors serving 100 countries.&lt;ref name=promega&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.promega.com/aboutus/company-information/ |title=Company Information |format= |work= |accessdate=January 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promega Corporation also established the first biotechnology joint venture in China (Sino-American Biotechnology Co. in 1985).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.madison.com/archives/read.php?ref=/wsj/2008/05/25/0805250226.php |title=madison.com |format= |work= |accessdate=November 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company has developed an on-site stocking system, which uses radio frequency identification (RFID) linked to the internet to track and manage remote inventory. This resulted in the spin-off company [[Terso Solutions]] that specializes in the design and manufacture of small RFID storage units.&lt;ref&gt;2005 [http://www.madison.com/archives/read.php?ref=/tct/2005/11/15/0511150112.php Report: Promega spins off RFID unit.] ''The Capital Times''. November 15. Business, 8B. Retrieved on July 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Product Areas and Technologies==

===Genomics===

The company's portfolio began with products for genomics researchers and now includes cloning systems, luciferase reporters, and amplification products as well as the original restriction and modifying enzymes. The  portfolio of amplification products includes the GoTaq family of polymerases and buffers and the Plexor quantitative PCR system.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Genetic Identity and Forensics===

The company is one of two main suppliers of systems for genetic identification based on DNA analysis using short tandem repeats (STRs).&lt;ref name=dnaone&gt;[http://dna.gov/ Amplification on-line training course at DNA.gov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830205453/http://www.dna.gov/ |date=2008-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Promega was the first company to provide kits for [[STR analysis]] of single loci.&lt;ref name=dnaone/&gt; Along with Applied Biosystems, Promega participated with the FBI and other crime labs in validating STR loci that would eventually be selected as the core loci for the COmbined DNA Index System (CODIS), used for forensic DNA testing in North America.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

The Promega PowerPlex STR systems were the first commercially available systems for STR analysis that contained all of the CODIS loci.&lt;ref name=dnaone/&gt;

===Proteomics===
The company was an early supplier in the cell-free protein synthesis field and is continuing to develop its portfolio in this area.&lt;ref name=zhao&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhao KQ, Hurst R, Slater MR, Bulleit RF |title=Functional protein expression from a DNA based wheat germ cell-free system |journal=J. Struct. Funct. Genomics |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=199–208 |date=December 2007 |pmid=18034374 |doi=10.1007/s10969-007-9035-2 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cellular Analysis and Drug Discovery===

Promega offers a range of products for cell biology and drug discovery, many of which are built upon bioluminescence technology. Assays for drug discovery are used globally and include biochemical and cell-based assays. In 2010, Promega launched a custom assay services business for biologics and small molecule drug development.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Integrated Platforms===

The company's    bioluminescence assays, DNA and RNA purification chemistries, and HaloTag technologies integrate with the high-throughput automated systems found in many laboratories. Some of this integration has occurred through collaboration with instrument manufacturers.

The company also sells their own Maxwell RSC and Maxwell RSC 48 Systems, bench-top automated purification systems for low and middle throughput research and diagnostic laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;(2008) [http://www.genomeweb.com/issues/news/147222-1.html Promega gets CE Mark for DNA purification system. ''GenomeWeb Daily'' May 29.] (accessed July 18, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Promega GloMax Luminometers are supplied with preinstalled protocols that allow researchers to perform multiplex bioluminescent assays. The luminometers with injection systems are available for use with dual-reporter assays like the Dual-Luciferase systems.
 
The Y-Chromosome Deletion Detection System from Promega also carries the CE Mark for use as an in vitro diagnostic device in the European Union.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

'''Proton-exchange membrane fuel cells''', also known as [[proton-exchange membrane|polymer electrolyte membrane]] (PEM) fuel cells ('''PEMFC'''), are a type of [[fuel cell]] being developed mainly for transport applications, as well as for [[stationary fuel-cell applications]] and [[Fuel cell#Portable power systems|portable fuel-cell applications]]. Their distinguishing features include lower temperature/pressure ranges (50 to 100&amp;nbsp;°C) and a special proton-conducting polymer electrolyte membrane. PEMFCs generate electricity and operate on the opposite principle to [[PEM electrolysis]], which consumes electricity. They are a leading candidate to replace the aging [[Alkaline fuel cell|alkaline fuel-cell]] technology, which was used in the [[Space Shuttle]].&lt;ref name=NTRS&gt;{{cite web|author1=Loyselle, Patricia |author2=Prokopius, Kevin |title=Teledyne Energy Systems, Inc., Proton Exchange Member (PEM) Fuel Cell Engineering Model Powerplant.

==Science==

PEMFCs are built out of [[Membrane electrode assembly|membrane electrode assemblies]] (MEA) which include the electrodes, electrolyte, catalyst, and gas diffusion layers. An ink of catalyst, carbon, and electrode are sprayed or painted onto the solid electrolyte and carbon paper is hot pressed on either side to protect the inside of the cell and also act as electrodes. The pivotal part of the cell is the triple phase boundary (TPB) where the electrolyte, catalyst, and reactants mix and thus where the cell reactions actually occur.&lt;ref name="Millington"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Millington | first1 = Ben | last2 = Du | first2 = Shangfeng | last3 = Pollet | first3 = Bruno G. | year = 2011 | title = The Effect of Materials on Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell Electrode Performance | url = | journal = Journal of Power Sources | volume = 196 | issue = 21| pages = 9013–017 | doi=10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.12.043}}&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, the membrane must not be electrically conductive so the half reactions do not mix. Operating temperatures above 100&amp;nbsp;°C are desired {{citation needed|date=April 2015}} so the water byproduct becomes steam and water management becomes less critical in cell design.

===Reactions===
{{Details|Fuel cell}}
A proton exchange membrane fuel cell transforms the [[chemical energy]] liberated during the [[electrochemical]] reaction of hydrogen and oxygen to [[electrical energy]], as opposed to the direct [[combustion]] of hydrogen and oxygen gases to produce [[thermal energy]].

A stream of hydrogen is delivered to the [[anode]] side of the MEA. At the anode side it is [[catalysis|catalytically]] split into [[proton]]s and [[electron]]s. This [[Redox|oxidation half-cell reaction]] or hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is represented by:&lt;br&gt;
'''At the anode:''' 
{| style="border:1px solid #ccc; width:60%;"
|-
|| &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{H}_2 \rightarrow \mathrm{2H}^+ + \mathrm{2e}^-&lt;/math&gt;
| style="text-align: right;" | &lt;math&gt;E^{\circ} = 0\,\mathrm{V}\,\,\,\frac{\mathrm{d}E^{\circ}}{\mathrm{d}T} = 0\,\mathrm{mV\,K^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt;
|  style="text-align:right; vertical-align:top;"| &lt;math&gt;\left ( 1 \right )&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The newly formed protons permeate through the polymer electrolyte membrane to the cathode side. The electrons travel along an external [[electrical network|load circuit]] to the [[cathode]] side of the MEA, thus creating the [[Current (electricity)|current]] output of the fuel cell.
Meanwhile, a stream of oxygen is delivered to the cathode side of the MEA. At the cathode side oxygen molecules react with the protons permeating through the polymer electrolyte membrane and the electrons arriving through the external circuit to form water molecules. This [[Redox|reduction]] half-cell reaction or [[oxygen reduction reaction]] (ORR) is represented by:

'''At the cathode:''' 
{| style="border:1px solid #ccc; width:60%;"
|-

To function, the membrane must conduct hydrogen ions (protons) but not electrons as this would in effect "[[short circuit]]" the fuel cell. The membrane must also not allow either gas to pass to the other side of the cell, a problem known as '''gas crossover'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Gas Permeation through Nafion.

Splitting of the hydrogen [[molecule]] is relatively easy by using a [[platinum]] catalyst. Unfortunately however, splitting the oxygen molecule is more difficult, and this causes significant electric losses. An appropriate catalyst material for this process has not been discovered, and platinum is the best option.

A cheaper alternative to platinum is [[Cerium(IV) oxide]] catalyst used by the [http://physics.mff.cuni.cz/kfpp/nano/ research group of professor Vladimír Matolín] in the development of PEMFC.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isvav.cz/projectDetail.do;jsessionid=CE66F4A7484F5D40CBD6FDEC51358F2C?rowId=GAP204%2F10%2F1169&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/fuce.200900036 | title=Pt and Sn Doped Sputtered CeO2Electrodes for Fuel Cell Applications | journal=Fuel Cells | last1 = Matolín | first1 = V. | year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://aktualne.centrum.cz/ekonomika/doprava/clanek.phtml?id=801592&lt;/ref&gt;

The PEMFC is a prime candidate for vehicle and other mobile applications of all sizes down to [[mobile phones]], because of its compactness. However, the water management is crucial to performance: too much water will flood the membrane, too little will dry it; in both cases, power output will drop. Water management is a very difficult subject in PEM systems, primarily because water in the membrane is attracted toward the cathode of the cell through polarization. A wide variety of solutions for managing the water exist including integration of [[electroosmotic pump]]s. Furthermore, the platinum catalyst on the membrane is easily [[catalyst poisoning|poisoned]] by [[carbon monoxide]] (no more than one [[part per million]] is usually acceptable) and the membrane is sensitive to things like metal ions, which can be introduced by corrosion of metallic [[bipolar plate]]s, metallic components in the fuel cell system or from contaminants in the fuel/oxidant.

PEM systems that use reformed [[methanol]] were proposed, as in Daimler Chrysler Necar 5; reforming methanol, i.e. making it react to obtain hydrogen, is however a very complicated process, that requires also purification from the carbon monoxide the reaction produces. A platinum-[[ruthenium]] catalyst is necessary as some carbon monoxide will unavoidably reach the membrane. The level should not exceed 10 [[parts per million]]. Furthermore, the start-up times of such a reformer reactor are of about half an hour. Alternatively, methanol, and some other [[biofuels]] can be fed to a PEM fuel cell directly without being reformed, thus making a direct methanol fuel cell ([[DMFC]]). These devices operate with limited success.

The most commonly used membrane is [[Nafion]] by [[Chemours]], which relies on liquid water humidification of the membrane to transport protons. This implies that it is not feasible to use temperatures above 80 to 90&amp;nbsp;°C, since the membrane would dry. Other, more recent membrane types, based on [[Polybenzimidazole fiber|polybenzimidazole (PBI)]] or [[phosphoric-acid fuel cell|phosphoric acid]], can reach up to 220&amp;nbsp;°C without using any water management: higher temperature allow for better efficiencies, power densities, ease of cooling (because of larger allowable temperature differences), reduced sensitivity to carbon monoxide poisoning and better controllability (because of absence of water management issues in the membrane); however, these recent types are not as common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lee, J.

It also exhibits better mechanical properties, higher strength, than Nafion and is cheaper. However, acid leaching is a considerable issue and processing, mixing with catalyst to form ink, has proved tricky. Aromatic polymers, such as PEEK, are far cheaper than Teflon ([[Polytetrafluoroethylene|PTFE]] and backbone of Nafion) and their polar character leads to hydration that is less temperature dependent than Nafion. However, PEEK is far less ionically conductive than Nafion and thus is a less favorable electrolyte choice.&lt;ref name="Fuel Cell Fundamentals"&gt;[O'Hayre, Ryan P. Fuel Cell Fundamentals.

==== Electrodes ====
An electrode typically consists of carbon support, Pt particles, Nafion ionomer, and/or Teflon binder. The carbon support functions as an electrical conductor; the Pt particles are reaction sites; the ionomer provides paths for proton conduction, and the Teflon binder increases the hydrophobicity of the electrode to minimize potential flooding. In order to enable the electrochemical reactions at the electrodes, protons, electrons and the reactant gases (hydrogen or oxygen) must gain access to the surface of the catalyst in the electrodes, while the product water, which can be in either liquid or gaseous phase, or both phases, must be able to permeate from the catalyst to the gas outlet. These properties are typically realized by porous composites of polymer electrolyte binder (ionomer) and catalyst nanoparticles supported on carbon particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = PEM fuel cell electrodes|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378775304000631|journal = Journal of Power Sources|date = 2004-05-03|pages = 61–76|volume = 130|issue = 1–2|doi = 10.1016/j.jpowsour.2003.12.055|first = S.|last = Litster|first2 = G.|last2 = McLean}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically platinum is used as the catalyst for the electrochemical reactions at the anode and cathode, while nanoparticles realize high surface to weight ratios (as further described below) reducing the amount of the costly platinum. The polymer electrolyte binder provides the ionic conductivity, while the carbon support of the catalyst improves the electric conductivity and enables low platinum metal loading.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Dependence of PEM fuel cell performance on catalyst loading|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378775303009480|journal = Journal of Power Sources|date = 2004-03-10|pages = 162–171|volume = 127|series = Eighth Ulmer Electrochemische Tage|issue = 1–2|doi = 10.1016/j.jpowsour.2003.09.013|first = H. A.|last = Gasteiger|first2 = J. E.|last2 = Panels|first3 = S. G.|last3 = Yan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The electric conductivity in the composite electrodes is typically more than 40 times higher as the proton conductivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Parasitic Currents Caused by Different Ionic and Electronic Conductivities in Fuel Cell Anodes|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.5b02182|journal = ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces|date = 2015-07-29|issn = 1944-8244|pages = 15746–15751|volume = 7|issue = 29|doi = 10.1021/acsami.5b02182|first = Maximilian|last = Schalenbach|first2 = Marcel|last2 = Zillgitt|first3 = Wiebke|last3 = Maier|first4 = Detlef|last4 = Stolten}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gas diffusion layer====

The GDL electrically connects the catalyst and current collector. It must be porous, electrically conductive, and thin. The reactants must be able to reach the catalyst, but conductivity and porosity can act as opposing forces. Optimally, the GDL should be composed of about one third Nafion or 15% PTFE. The carbon particles used in the GDL can be larger than those employed in the catalyst because surface area is not the most important variable in this layer. GDL should be around 15-35&amp;nbsp;µm thick to balance needed porosity with mechanical strength.&lt;ref name = "Summary Paper"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Litster | first1 = S. | last2 = Mclean | first2 = G. | year = 2004 | title = PEM Fuel Cell Electrodes | url = | journal = Journal of Power Sources | volume = 130 | issue = 1–2| pages = 61–76 | doi=10.1016/j.jpowsour.2003.12.055}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, an intermediate porous layer is added between the GDL and catalyst layer to ease the transitions between the large pores in the GDL and small porosity in the catalyst layer. Since a primary function of the GDL is to help remove water, a product, flooding can occur when water effectively blocks the GDL. This limits the reactants ability to access the catalyst and significantly decreases performance. Teflon can be coated onto the GDL to limit the possibility of flooding.&lt;ref name="Fuel Cell Fundamentals" /&gt; Several microscopic variables are analyzed in the GDLS such as: porosity, tortuosity and permeability. These variables have incidence over the behavior of the fuel cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/er.3348 | volume=39 | title=Compress effects on porosity, gas-phase tortuosity, and gas permeability in a simulated PEM gas diffusion layer | year=2015 | journal=[[International Journal of Energy Research]] | pages=1528–1536 | last1 = Espinoza | first1 = Mayken}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two major GDL substrates, carbon cloth and paper, were compared, indicative of different cell performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013468606011960 | doi=10.1016/j.electacta.2006.11.012 | volume=52 | title=Elucidating differences between carbon paper and carbon cloth in polymer electrolyte fuel cells | year=2007 | journal=Electrochimica Acta | pages=3965–3975 | last1 = Wang | first1 = Yun | last2 = Wang | first2 = Chao-Yang | last3 = Chen | first3 = K.S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Efficiency====
The maximal theoretical efficiency applying the [[Gibbs free energy]] equation ΔG=-237.13 kJ/mol and using the [[heating value]] of Hydrogen (ΔH=-285.84 kJ/mol) is 83% at 298 K.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}
&lt;math&gt;\eta=\frac{\Delta G}{ \Delta H}=1-\frac{T\Delta S}{\Delta H}&lt;/math&gt;

The practical efficiency of a PEM's is in the range of 50–60% .{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}
Main factors that create losses are:
* Activation losses
* Ohmic losses
* Mass transport losses

=== Metal-organic frameworks ===
Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a relatively new class of porous, highly crystalline materials that consist of metal nodes connected by organic linkers. Due to the simplicity of manipulating or substituting the metal centers and ligands, there are a virtually limitless number of possible combinations, which is attractive from a design standpoint. MOFs exhibit many unique properties due to their tunable pore sizes, thermal stability, high volume capacities, large surface areas, and desirable electrochemical characteristics. Among their many diverse uses, MOFs are promising candidates for clean energy applications such as hydrogen storage, gas separations, supercapacitors, Li-ion batteries, solar cells, and fuel cells. Within the field of fuel cell research, MOFs are being studied as potential electrolyte materials and electrode catalysts that could someday replace traditional polymer membranes and Pt catalysts, respectively.

As electrolyte materials, the inclusion of MOFs seems at first counter-intuitive. Fuel cell membranes generally have low porosity to prevent fuel crossover and loss of voltage between the anode and cathode. Additionally, membranes tend to have low crystallinity because the transport of ions is more favorable in disordered materials. On the other hand, pores can be filled with additional ion carriers that ultimately enhance the ionic conductivity of the system and high crystallinity makes the design process less complex.

The general requirements of a good electrolyte for PEMFCs are: high proton conductivity (&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; S/cm for practical applications) to enable proton transport between electrodes, good chemical and thermal stability under fuel cell operating conditions (environmental humidity, variable temperatures, resistance to poisonous species, etc.), low cost, ability to be processed into thin-films, and overall compatibility with other cell components.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = MOFs as proton conductors – challenges and opportunities|url = http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=C4CS00093E|journal = Chem. Soc. Rev.|pages = 5913–5932|volume = 43|issue = 16|doi = 10.1039/c4cs00093e|first = Padmini|last = Ramaswamy|first2 = Norman E.|last2 = Wong|first3 = George K. H.|last3 = Shimizu|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While polymeric materials are currently the preferred choice of proton-conducting membrane, they require humidification for adequate performance and can sometimes physically degrade due to hydrations effects, thereby causing losses of efficiency. As mentioned, Nafion is also limited by a dehydration temperature of &lt; 100&amp;nbsp;°C, which can lead to slower reaction kinetics, poor cost efficiency, and CO poisoning of Pt electrode catalysts. Conversely, MOFs have shown encouraging proton conductivities in both low and high temperature regimes as well as over a wide range of humidity conditions. Below 100&amp;nbsp;°C and under hydration, the presence of hydrogen bonding and solvent water molecules aid in proton transport, whereas anhydrous conditions are suitable for temperatures above 100&amp;nbsp;°C. MOFs also have the distinct advantage of exhibiting proton conductivity by the framework itself in addition to the inclusion of charge carries (i.e., water, acids, etc.) into their pores.

A low temperature example is work by Kitagawa, et al. who used a two-dimensional oxalate-bridged anionic layer framework as the host and introduced ammonium cations and adipic acid molecules into the pores to increase proton concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Metal–organic frameworks as platforms for clean energy|url = http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=c3ee40507a|journal = Energy &amp; Environmental Science|volume = 6|issue = 6|doi = 10.1039/c3ee40507a|first = Shun-Li|last = Li|first2 = Qiang|last2 = Xu|pages=1656|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was one of the first instances of a MOF showing “superprotonic” conductivity (8 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; S/cm) at 25&amp;nbsp;°C and 98% relative humidity (RH). They later found that increasing the hydrophilic nature of the cations introduced into the pores could enhance proton conductivity even more. In this low temperature regime that is dependent on degree of hydration, it has also been shown that proton conductivity is heavily dependent on humidity levels.

A high temperature anhydrous example is PCMOF2, which consists of sodium ions coordinated to a trisulfonated benzene derivative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Metal–organic frameworks: Transported into fuel cells|url = http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nchem.454|journal = Nature Chemistry|pages = 689–690|volume = 1|issue = 9|doi = 10.1038/nchem.454|first = Hiroshi|last = Kitagawa|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; To improve performance and allow for higher operating temperatures, water can be replaced as the proton carrier by less volatile imidazole or triazole molecules within the pores. The maximum temperature achieved was 150&amp;nbsp;°C with an optimum conductivity of 5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; S/cm, which is lower than other current electrolyte membranes. However, this model holds promise for its temperature regime, anhydrous conditions, and ability to control the quantity of guest molecules within the pores, all of which allowed for the tunability of proton conductivity. Additionally, the triazole-loaded PCMOF2 was incorporated into a H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/air membrane-electrode assembly and achieved an open circuit voltage of 1.18 V at 100&amp;nbsp;°C that was stable for 72 hours and managed to remain gas tight throughout testing. This was the first instance that proved MOFs could actually be implemented into functioning fuel cells, and the moderate potential difference showed that fuel crossover due to porosity was not an issue.

To date, the highest proton conductivity achieved for a MOF electrolyte is 4.2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; S/cm at 25&amp;nbsp;°C under humid conditions (98% RH), which is competitive with Nafion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some recent experiments have even successfully produced thin-film MOF membranes instead of the traditional bulk samples or single crystals, which is crucial for their industrial applicability. Once MOFs are able to consistently achieve sufficient conductivity levels, mechanical strength, water stability, and simple processing, they have the potential to play an important role in PEMFCs in the near future.

MOFs have also been targeted as potential replacements of platinum group metal (PGM) materials for electrode catalysts, although this research is still in the early stages of development. In PEMFCs, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the Pt cathode is significantly slower than the fuel oxidation reaction at the anode, and thus non-PGM and metal-free catalysts are being investigated as alternatives. The high volumetric density, large pore surface areas, and openness of metal-ion sites in MOFs make them ideal candidates for catalyst precursors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Heat-treatment of metal–organic frameworks for green energy applications|url = http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=C4CE01499E|journal = CrystEngComm|pages = 10–22|volume = 17|issue = 1|doi = 10.1039/c4ce01499e|first = Lacey|last = Lux|first2 = Kia|last2 = Williams|first3 = Shengqian|last3 = Ma|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite promising catalytic abilities, the durability of these proposed MOF-based catalysts is currently less than desirable and the ORR mechanism in this context is still not completely understood.

===Catalyst research===
Much of the current research on catalysts for PEM fuel cells can be classified as having one of following main objectives:

#to obtain higher catalytic activity than the standard carbon-supported platinum particle catalysts used in current PEM fuel cells 
#to reduce the poisoning of PEM fuel cell catalysts by impurity gases
#to reduce the cost of the fuel due to use of platinum-based catalysts
#to enhance the ORR activity of platinum group metal-free electrocatalysts &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Department of Energy Announces $39 million for Innovative Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies Research and Development|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Proton-exchange_membrane_fuel_cell&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of these approaches are given in the following sections.

====Increasing catalytic activity====

As mentioned above, platinum is by far the most effective element used for PEM fuel cell catalysts, and nearly all current PEM fuel cells use platinum particles on porous carbon supports to catalyze both hydrogen oxidation and oxygen reduction. However, due to their high cost, current Pt/C catalysts are not feasible for commercialization. The [[U.S. Department of Energy]] estimates that platinum-based catalysts will need to use roughly four times less platinum than is used in current PEM fuel cell designs in order to represent a realistic alternative to [[internal combustion engines]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/program_plans.html Hydrogen, Fuel Cells &amp; Infrastructure Technologies Program Multi-Year Research, Development and Demonstration Plan], U.S. Department of Energy, October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, one main goal of catalyst design for PEM fuel cells is to increase the catalytic activity of platinum by a factor of four so that only one-fourth as much of the precious metal is necessary to achieve similar performance.

One method of increasing the performance of platinum catalysts is to optimize the size and shape of the platinum particles. Decreasing the particles’ size alone increases the total surface area of catalyst available to participate in reactions per volume of platinum used, but recent studies have demonstrated additional ways to make further improvements to catalytic performance. For example, one study reports that high-index facets of platinum [[nanoparticles]] (that is [[Miller index]]es with large integers, such as Pt (730)) provide a greater density of reactive sites for oxygen reduction than typical platinum nanoparticles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=N. Tian |author2=Z.-Y. Zhou |author3=S.-G. Sun |author4=Y. Ding |author5=Z. L. Wang |title=Synthesis of tetrahexahedral platinum nanocrystals with high-index facets and high electro-oxidation activity|journal=Science|volume=316|year=2007|pages=732–735|doi=10.1126/science.1140484|pmid=17478717|issue=5825}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the most common and effective catalyst, platinum, is extremely expensive, alternative processing is necessary to maximize surface area and minimize loading. Deposition of nanosized Pt particles onto carbon powder (Pt/C) provides a large Pt surface area while the carbon allows for electrical connection between the catalyst and the rest of the cell. Platinum is so effective because it has high activity and bonds to the hydrogen just strongly enough to facilitate electron transfer but not inhibit the hydrogen from continuing to move around the cell. However, platinum is less active in the cathode oxygen reduction reaction. This necessitates the use of more platinum, increasing the cell’s expense and thus feasibility. Many potential catalyst choices are ruled out because of the extreme acidity of the cell.&lt;ref name="Fuel Cell Fundamentals" /&gt;

The most effective ways of achieving the nanoscale Pt on carbon powder, which is currently the best option, are through vacuum deposition, sputtering, and electrodeposition. The platinum particles are deposited onto carbon paper that is permeated with PTFE. However, there is an optimal thinness to this catalyst layer, which limits the lower cost limit. Below 4&amp;nbsp;nm, Pt will form islands on the paper, limiting its activity. Above this thickness, the Pt will coat the carbon and be an effective catalyst. To further complicate things, Nafion cannot be infiltrated beyond 10&amp;nbsp;um, so using more Pt than this is an unnecessary expense. Thus the amount and shape of the catalyst is limited by the constraints of other materials.&lt;ref name="Summary Paper" /&gt;

A second method of increasing the catalytic activity of platinum is to [[alloy]] it with other metals. For example, it was recently shown that the Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ni(111) surface has a higher oxygen reduction activity than pure Pt(111) by a factor of ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=V. R. Stamenkovic, B. Fowler, B. S. Mun, G. Wang, P. N. Ross, C. A. Lucas, N. M. Marković. Activity on Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ni(111) via increased surface site availability|journal=Science|volume=315|year=2007|pages=493–497|doi=10.1126/science.1135941|title=Improved Oxygen Reduction Activity on Pt3Ni(111) via Increased Surface Site Availability|pmid=17218494|issue=5811}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors attribute this dramatic performance increase to modifications to the [[electronic structure]] of the surface, reducing its tendency to bond to oxygen-containing ionic species present in PEM fuel cells and hence increasing the number of available sites for oxygen [[adsorption]] and reduction.

Further efficiencies can be realized using an [[Ultrasonic nozzle]] to apply the platinum catalyst to the electrolyte layer or to [[carbon paper]] under atmospheric conditions resulting in high efficiency spray.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Koraishy|first=Babar|title=Manufacturing of membrane electrode assemblies for fuel cells|url=http://www.sutd.edu.sg/cmsresource/idc/papers/2009-_Manufacturing_of_membrane_electrode_assemblies_for_fuel_cells.pdf|publisher=Singapore University of Technology and Design|location=6.2.1|page=9|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that due to the uniform size of the droplets created by this type of spray, due to the high transfer efficiency of the technology, due to the non-clogging nature of the nozzle and finally due to the fact that the ultrasonic energy de-agglomerates the suspension just before atomization, fuel cells MEA's manufactured this way have a greater homogeneity in the final MEA, and the gas flow through the cell is more uniform, maximizing the efficiency of the platinum in the MEA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Engle|first=Robb|title=MAXIMIZING THE USE OF PLATINUM CATALYST  BY ULTRASONIC SPRAY APPLICATION|journal=PROCEEDINGS OF ASME 2011 5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY &amp; 9TH FUEL CELL SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE|date=2011-08-08|volume=ESFUELCELL2011-54369|url=http://www.sono-tek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/ASME_Journal_of_Fuel-Cell_Science.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Recent studies using [[inkjet printing]] to deposit the catalyst over the membrane have also shown high catalyst utilization due to the reduced thickness of the deposited catalyst layers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shukla, S|title=Analysis of Low Platinum Loading Thin Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell Electrodes Prepared by Inkjet Printing|date=2015|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013468615000481|doi=10.1016/j.electacta.2015.01.028|volume=156|journal=Electrochimica Acta|pages=289–300}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shukla, S|title=Analysis of Inkjet Printed PEFC Electrodes with Varying Platinum Loading|date=2016|url=http://jes.ecsdl.org/content/163/7/F677.short|volume=163|journal=Journal of the Electrochemical Society|pages=F677-F687|doi=10.1149/2.1111607jes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Very recently, a new class of ORR electrocatalysts have been introduced in the case of Pt-M (M-Fe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sagar Prabhudev |author2=Matthieu Bugnet |author3=Christina Bock |author4=Gianluigi Botton |journal=ACS Nano|volume=7|year=2013|pages=6103–6110|doi=10.1021/nn4019009|title=Strained Lattice with Persistent Atomic Order in Pt3Fe2 Intermetallic Core–Shell Nanocatalysts|pmid=23773037|issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Co) systems with an ordered intermetallic core encapsulated within a Pt-rich shell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Minna Cao, Dongshuang Wu  |author2=Rong Cao |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=ChemCatChem|volume=6|year=2014|pages=26–45|doi=10.1002/cctc.201300647|title=Recent Advances in the Stabilization of Platinum Electrocatalysts for Fuel-Cell Reactions|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These '''intermetallic core-shell (IMCS) nanocatalysts''' were found to exhibit an enhanced activity and most importantly, an extended durability compared to many previous designs. While the observed enhancement in the activities is ascribed to a strained lattice, the authors report that their findings on the degradation kinetics establish that the extended catalytic durability is attributable to a sustained atomic order.

Another practical approach is through multi-layer configuration catalyst layer,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feng | first1 = X. | last2 = Wang | first2 = Y. | year = 2010 | title = Multi-Layer Configuration for the Cathode Electrode of Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell | url = | journal = Electrochimica Acta | volume = 55 | issue = | pages = 4579–4586 | doi=10.1016/j.electacta.2010.03.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Y. Wang and X. Feng, "Analysis of Reaction Rates in the Cathode Electrode of Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells Part II: Dual-Layer Electrodes", J. Electrochem. Soc., 156(3) (2009) B403-B409.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was promoted by the highly spatial variation of reaction rate through the catalyst layer, which is measured by a new dimensionless parameter, h.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Wang and Xuhui Feng, Analysis of Reaction Rates in the Cathode Electrode of Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells Part I: Single-Layer Electrodes, J. Electrochem. Soc., 155(12) (2008) B1289-B1295.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reducing poisoning====

The other popular approach to improving catalyst performance is to reduce its sensitivity to impurities in the fuel source, especially carbon monoxide (CO). Presently, pure hydrogen gas is becoming economical to mass-produce by [[electrolysis]]. However, at the moment hydrogen gas is produced by [[steam reforming]] light [[hydrocarbons]], a process which produces a mixture of gases that also contains CO (1–3%), CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (19–25%), and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (25%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=G. Hoogers|title=Fuel Cell Technology Handbook|publisher=Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press|year=2003|pages=6–3|isbn=0-8493-0877-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even tens of parts per million of CO can poison a pure platinum catalyst, so increasing platinum’s resistance to CO is an active area of research.

For example, one study reported that cube-shaped platinum nanoparticles with [[Miller index|(100) facets]] displayed a fourfold increase in oxygen reduction activity compared to randomly faceted platinum nanoparticles of similar size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=C. Wang, H. Daimon, T. Onodera, T. Koda, S. Sun. A general approach to the size- and shape-controlled synthesis of platinum nanoparticles and their catalytic reduction of oxygen|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|volume=47|year=2008|pages=3588–3591|doi=10.1002/anie.200800073|title=A General Approach to the Size- and Shape-Controlled Synthesis of Platinum Nanoparticles and Their Catalytic Reduction of Oxygen|pmid=18399516|issue=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors concluded that the (111) facets of the randomly shaped nanoparticles bonded more strongly to [[sulfate]] ions than the (100) facets, reducing the number of catalytic sites open to oxygen molecules. The nanocubes they synthesized, in contrast, had almost exclusively (100) facets, which are known to interact with sulfate more weakly. As a result, a greater fraction of the surface area of those particles was available for the reduction of oxygen, boosting the catalyst’s oxygen reduction activity.

In addition, researchers have been investigating ways of reducing the CO content of hydrogen fuel before it enters a fuel cell as a possible way to avoid poisoning the catalysts. One recent study revealed that ruthenium-platinum core–shell nanoparticles are particularly effective at oxidizing CO to form CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a much less harmful fuel contaminant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=S. Alayoglu, A. U. Nilekar, M. Mavrikakis, B. Eichhorn. Ru–Pt core–shell nanoparticles for preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in hydrogen|journal=Nature Materials|volume=7|year=2008|pages=333–338|doi=10.1038/nmat2156|title=Ru–Pt core–shell nanoparticles for preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in hydrogen|pmid=18345004|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism that produces this effect is conceptually similar to that described for Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ni above: the ruthenium core of the particle alters the electronic structure of the platinum surface, rendering it better able to catalyze the oxidation of CO.

====Lowering cost====

The challenge for the viability of PEM fuel cells today still remains in their cost and stability. The high cost can in large part be attributed to the use of the precious metal of platinum in the catalyst layer of PEM cells. The electrocatalyst currently accounts for nearly half of the fuel cell stack cost.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;E. Proietti, F. Jaouen, M. Lefevre, N. Larouche, J. Tian, J. Herranz, and J.-P. Dodelet. 2011 Iron-based cathode catalyst with enhanced power density in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells" ''Nature Communications'' 2(1),&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Pt loading of PEM fuel cells has been reduced by two orders of magnitude over the past decade,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Litster | first1 = S. | last2 = McLean | first2 = G. | year = 2004 | title = PEM fuel cell electrodes | url = | journal = Journal of Power Sources | volume = 130 | issue = 1–2| pages = 61–76 | doi=10.1016/j.jpowsour.2003.12.055}}&lt;/ref&gt; further reduction is necessary to make the technology economically viable for commercialization. Whereas some research efforts aim to address this issue by improving the electrocatalytic activity of Pt-based catalysts, an alternative is to eliminate the use of Pt altogether by developing a non-platinum-group-metal (non-PGM) cathode catalyst whose performance rivals that of Pt-based technologies. The U.S. Department of Energy has been setting milestones for the development of fuel cells, targeting a durability of 5000 hours and a non-PGM catalyst ORR volumetric activity of 300 A cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = Yun | last2 = Chen | first2 = Ken S | last3 = Jeffrey | first3 = Mishler | last4 = Chan Cho | first4 = Sung | last5 = Adroher Xavier | first5 = Cordobes | year = 2011 | title = A review of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells: Technology, applications, and needs on fundamental research | url = | journal = Applied Energy | volume = 88 | issue = 4| pages = 981–1007 | doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2010.09.030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Promising alternatives to Pt-based catalysts are Metal/Nitrogen/ Carbon-catalysts (M/N/C-catalysts). To achieve high power density, or output of power over surface area of the cell, a volumetric activity of at least 1/10 that of Pt-based catalysts must be met,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; along with good mass transport properties. While M/N/C-catalysts still demonstrate poorer volumetric activities than Pt-based catalysts, the reduced costs of such catalysts allows for greater loading to compensate. However, increasing the loading of M/N/C-catalysts also renders the catalytic layer thicker, impairing its mass transport properties. In other words, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, protons, and electrons have greater difficulty in migrating through the catalytic layer, decreasing the voltage output of the cell. While high microporosity of the M/N/C catalytic network results in high volumetric activity, improved mass transport properties are instead associated to macroporosity of the network. These M/N/C materials are synthesized using high temperature pyrolysis and other high temperature treatments of precursors containing the metal, nitrogen, and carbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Serov | first1 = A. | last2 = Artyushkova | first2 = K. | last3 = Atanassov | first3 = P. | year = 2014 | title = Fe-N-C Oxygen Reduction Fuel Cell Catalyst Derived from Carbendazim: Synthesis, Structure, and Reactivity | url = | journal = Adv. Energy Mater. | volume = 4 | issue = | page = 1301735 | doi=10.1002/aenm.201301735}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, researchers have developed a Fe/N/C catalyst derived from iron (II) acetate (FeAc), phenanthroline (Phen), and a metal-organic-framework (MOF) host. The MOF is a Zn(II) zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) called ZIF-8, which demonstrates a high microporous surface area and high nitrogen content conducive to ORR activity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The power density of the FeAc/Phen/ZIF-8-catalyst was found to be 0.75 W cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.6 V. This value is a significant improvement over the maximal 0.37 W cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; power density of previous M/N/C-catalysts and is much closer to matching the typical value of 1-1.2 W cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; for Pt-based catalysts with a Pt loading of 0.3&amp;nbsp;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. The catalyst also demonstrated a volumetric activity of 230 A cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, the highest value for non-PGM catalysts to date,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; approaching the U.S. Department of Energy milestone.

While the power density achieved by the novel FeAc/Phen/ZIF-8-catalyst is promising, its durability remains inadequate for commercial application. It is reported that the best durability exhibited by this catalyst still had a 15% drop in current density over 100 hours in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/air.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Hence while the Fe-based non-PGM catalysts rival Pt-based catalysts in their electrocatalytic activity, there is still much work to be done in understanding their degradation mechanisms and improving their durability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yin |first1=Xi |last2=Zelenay |first2=Piotr |title=Kinetic Models for the Degradation Mechanisms of PGM-Free ORR Catalysts |journal=ECS Transactions |date=13 July 2018 |volume=85 |issue=13 |pages=1239–1250 |doi=10.1149/08513.1239ecst}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Martinez |first1=Ulises |last2=Babu |first2=Siddharth Komini |last3=Holby |first3=Edward F. |last4=Zelenay |first4=Piotr |title=Durability challenges and perspective in the development of PGM-free electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction |journal=Current Opinion in Electrochemistry |date=April 2018 |doi=10.1016/j.coelec.2018.04.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
The major application of PEM fuel cells focuses on transportation primarily because of their potential impact on the environment, e.g. the control of emission of the green house gases (GHG). Other applications include distributed/stationary and portable power generation. Most major motor companies work solely on PEM fuel cells due to their high power density and excellent dynamic characteristics as compared with other types of fuel cells.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ywang.eng.uci.edu/Publications_files/A%20review%20of%20polymer%20electrolyte%20membrane%20fuel%20cells%20Technology,%20applications,%20and%20needs%20on%20fundamental%20research.pdf]  Y. Wang, Ken S. Chen, Jeffrey Mishler, Sung Chan Cho, Xavier Cordobes Adroher, A Review of Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells: Technology, Applications, and Needs on Fundamental Research, Applied Energy 88 (2011) 981-1007.&lt;/ref&gt;
Due to their light weight, PEMFCs are most suited for transportation applications. PEMFCs for buses, which use compressed hydrogen for fuel, can operate at up to 40% efficiency. Generally PEMFCs are implemented on buses over smaller cars because of the available volume to house the system and store the fuel. Technical issues for transportation involve incorporation of PEMs into current vehicle technology and updating energy systems. Full fuel cell vehicles are not advantageous if hydrogen is sourced from fossil fuels; however, they become beneficial when implemented as hybrids. There is potential for PEMFCs to be used for stationary power generation, where they provide 5&amp;nbsp;kW at 30% efficiency; however, they run into competition with other types of fuel cells, mainly SOFCs and MCFCs. Whereas PEMFCs generally require high purity hydrogen for operation, other fuel cell types can run on methane and are thus more flexible systems. Therefore, PEMFCs are best for small scale systems until economically scalable pure hydrogen is available. Furthermore, PEMFCs have the possibility of replacing batteries for portable electronics, though integration of the hydrogen supply is a technical challenge particularly without a convenient location to store it within the device.&lt;ref name = "Applications"&gt;[ Wee, Jung-Ho. "Applications of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell Systems." Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 11.8 (2007): 1720-738. Web.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Before the invention of PEM fuel cells, existing fuel cell types such as [[solid-oxide fuel cells]] were only applied in extreme conditions. Such fuel cells also required very expensive materials and could only be used for stationary applications due to their size. These issues were addressed by the PEM fuel cell. The PEM fuel cell was invented in the early 1960s by Willard Thomas Grubb and Leonard Niedrach of [[General Electric]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanhistory.si.edu/fuelcells/pem/pemmain.htm PEM Fuel Cells]. Americanhistory.si.edu. Retrieved on 2013-04-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, sulfonated polystyrene membranes were used for electrolytes, but they were replaced in 1966 by [[Nafion]] [[ionomer]], which proved to be superior in performance and durability to sulfonated polystyrene.

PEM fuel cells were used in the [[NASA]] [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] series of spacecraft, but they were replaced by [[Alkaline fuel cell]]s in the [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] program and in the [[Space shuttle]].

Parallel with [[Pratt and Whitney]] Aircraft, General Electric developed the first proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) for the [[Gemini program|Gemini space missions]] in the early 1960s. The first mission to use PEMFCs was [[Gemini 5|Gemini V]]. However, the [[Apollo program|Apollo space missions]] and subsequent [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project|Apollo-Soyuz]], [[Skylab]] and Space Shuttle missions used fuel cells based on Bacon's design, developed by Pratt and Whitney Aircraft.

Extremely expensive materials were used and the fuel cells required very pure hydrogen and oxygen. Early fuel cells tended to require inconveniently high operating temperatures that were a problem in many applications. However, fuel cells were seen to be desirable due to the large amounts of fuel available (hydrogen and oxygen).{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Despite their success in space programs, fuel cell systems were limited to space missions and other special applications, where high cost could be tolerated. It was not until the late 1980s and early 1990s that fuel cells became a real option for wider application base. Several pivotal innovations, such as low platinum [[catalyst]] loading and thin film electrodes, drove the cost of fuel cells down, making development of PEMFC systems more realistic.&lt;ref name=RSC2&gt;{{cite web|title=Fuel cell electric vehicles and hydrogen infrastructure: status 2012|url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233987484_Fuel_cell_electric_vehicles_and_hydrogen_infrastructure_status_2012?ev=prf_pub |last1=Eberle|first1=Ulrich |first2=Bernd|last2=Mueller |first3=Rittmar|last3=von Helmolt|publisher=[[Royal Society of Chemistry]] |date=2012-07-15| accessdate=2013-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is significant debate as to whether hydrogen fuel cells will be a realistic technology for use in [[automobile]]s or other [[vehicle]]s. (See [[hydrogen economy]].) A large part of PEMFC production is for the [[Toyota Mirai]]. The US Department of Energy estimates a 2016 price at $53/kW if 500,000 units per year were made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1109836_is-toyotas-hydrogen-fuel-cell-fervor-foolish-or-foresighted-with-charts/page-2 |title=Is Toyota's hydrogen fuel-cell fervor foolish, or foresighted?

==Major PEM Fuel Cell Companies==
In the U.S, the major companies are Plug Power located in upstate New York and Nuvera Fuel Cells in Massachusetts. Ford Motor and General Motor also have significant amount of fuel cell activities.

In Canada, Ballard is the largest followed by Hydrogenics.

In Europe, there are ElringKlinger in Germany and PowerCell in Sweden.

In China, companies include Re-fire, SinoHytec, Horizon, Bing Energy, and Zehe Energy.

'''Radio receiver design''' includes the [[electronic design]] of different components of a [[radio receiver]] which processes the [[radio frequency signal]] from an [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] in order to produce usable information such as audio. The complexity of a modern receiver and the possible range of circuitry and methods employed are more generally covered in [[electronics engineering|electronics]] and [[communications engineering]]. The term ''radio receiver'' is understood in this article to mean any device which is intended to receive a radio signal in order to generate useful information from the signal, most notably a recreation of the so-called [[baseband]] signal (such as audio) which modulated the radio signal at the time of transmission in a communications or broadcast system.

==Fundamental considerations==
Design of a radio receiver must consider several fundamental criteria to produce a practical result. The main criteria are [[Gain (electronics)|gain]], [[Selectivity (electronic)| selectivity]], [[Sensitivity (electronics)|sensitivity]], and stability. The receiver must contain a [[Detector (radio)|detector]] to recover the information initially impressed on the radio [[carrier signal]], a process called [[modulation]].&lt;ref name=DESIGN77&gt; Wes Hayward, Doug De Maw (ed),''Solid State Design for the Radio Amateur'', Chapter 5 "Receiver Design Basics", American Radio Relay League 1977, no ISBN &lt;/ref&gt;   

Gain is required because the signal intercepted by an [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] will have a very low power level, on the order of [[femtowatt]]s. To produce an audible signal in a pair of headphones requires this signal to be amplified a trillion-fold or more. The magnitudes of the required gain are so great that the logarithmic unit [[decibel]] is preferred - a gain of 1 trillion times the power is 120 decibels, which is a value achieved by many common receivers. Gain is provided by one or more [[amplifier stage]]s in a receiver design; some of the gain is applied at the radio-frequency part of the system, and the rest at the frequencies used by the recovered information (audio, video, or data signals). 

Selectivity is the ability to "tune in" to just one station of the many that may be transmitting at any given time. An adjustable [[bandpass filter]] is a typical stage of a receiver.  A receiver may include several stages of bandpass filters to provide sufficient selectivity. Additionally, the receiver design must provide immunity from [[spurious signal]]s that may be [[intermodulation|generated within the receiver]] that would interfere with the desired signal.  Broadcasting transmitters in any given area are assigned frequencies so that receivers can properly select the desired transmission; this is a key factor limiting the number of transmitting stations that can operate in a given area. 

Sensitivity is the ability to recover the signal from the background noise.  Noise is generated in the path between transmitter and receiver, but is also significantly generated in the receiver's own circuits. Inherently, any circuit above [[absolute zero]] generates some random noise that adds to the desired signals. In some cases, atmospheric noise is far greater than that produced in the receiver's own circuits, but in some designs, measures such as [[cryogenic]] cooling are applied to some stages of the receiver, to prevent signals from being obscured by thermal noise. A very good receiver design may have a [[noise figure]] of only a few times the theoretical minimum for the operating temperature and desired signal bandwidth. The objective is to produce a [[signal-to-noise ratio]] of the recovered signal sufficient for the intended purpose. This ratio is also often expressed in decibels.  A signal-to-noise ratio of 10 dB (signal 10 times as powerful as noise) might be usable for voice communications by experienced operators, but a receiver intended for high-fidelity music reproduction might require 50 dB or higher signal-to-noise ratio. 

Stability is required in at least two senses. [[Frequency stability]]; the receiver must stay "tuned" to the incoming radio signal and must not "drift" with time or temperature.  Additionally, the great magnitude of gain generated must be carefully controlled so that [[spurious emission]]s  are not produced within the receiver.  These would lead to distortion of the recovered information, or, at worst, may radiate signals that interfere with other receivers. 

The [[Detector (radio)|detector]] stage recovers the information from the radio-frequency signal, and produces the sound, video, or data that was impressed on the carrier wave initially. Detectors may be as simple as an "envelope" detector for [[amplitude modulation]], or may be more complex circuits for more recently developed techniques such as [[frequency-hopping spread spectrum]]. 

While not fundamental to a receiver, [[automatic gain control]] is a great convenience to the user, since it automatically compensates for changing received [[signal level]]s or different levels produced by different transmitters.  

Many different approaches and fundamental receiver "block diagrams" have developed to address these several, sometimes contradictory, factors.  Once these technical objectives have been achieved, the remaining design process is still complicated by considerations of economics, patent rights, and even fashion. 

==Crystal radio==
{{Main|Crystal radio receiver}}
A crystal radio uses no active parts: it is powered only by the radio signal itself, whose detected power feeds headphones in order to be audible at all. In order to achieve even a minimal sensitivity, a crystal radio is limited to low frequencies using a large antenna (usually a long wire). It relies on detection using some sort of semiconductor [[diode]] such as the original [[Cat's-whisker detector|cat's-whisker diode]] discovered long before the development of modern semiconductors.
[[Image:Crystal radio receiver.PNG|thumb|300px|A ''crystal set receiver'' consisting of an antenna, a variable inductor, a [[cat's whisker]], and a filter capacitor.]]

A crystal receiver is very simple and can be easy to make or even improvise, for example, the [[foxhole radio]]. However, the crystal radio needs a strong RF signal and a long antenna to operate. It displays poor [[selectivity (electronic)|selectivity]] since it only has one tuned circuit.

==Tuned radio frequency==
{{Main|Tuned radio frequency receiver}}
The [[tuned radio frequency receiver]] (TRF) consists of a radio frequency amplifier having one or more stages all tuned to the desired reception frequency. This is followed by a detector, typically an [[envelope detector]] using a diode, followed by audio amplification. This was developed after the invention of the [[triode]] vacuum tube, greatly improving the reception of radio signals using electronic amplification which had not previously been available. The greatly improved selectivity of the superheterodyne receiver overtook the TRF design in almost all applications, however the TRF design was still used as late as the 1960s among the cheaper "transistor radios" of that era.

==Reflex==
{{Main|Reflex receiver}}
The [[reflex receiver]] was a design from the early 20th century which consists of a single-stage TRF receiver but which used the same amplifying tube to also amplify the audio signal after it had been detected. This was in an era where each tube was a major cost (and consumer of electrical power) so that a substantial increase in the number of passive elements would be seen as preferable to including an additional tube. The design tends to be rather unstable, and is obsolete.

==Regenerative==
{{Main|Regenerative circuit}}
[[Image:Regenerative Receiver.png|300px|thumb|right|Classical regenerative receiver using a single [[triode]] vacuum tube. The orientation of the "tickler" coil was carefully adjusted by the operator in order to vary the amount of [[positive feedback]].]]
The [[regenerative receiver]] also had its heyday at the time where adding an active element (vacuum tube) was considered costly. In order to increase the gain of the receiver, positive feedback was used in its single RF amplifier stage; this also increased the selectivity of the receiver well beyond what would be expected from a single tuned circuit. The amount of feedback was quite critical in determining the resulting gain and had to be carefully adjusted by the radio operator. Increasing the feedback beyond a point caused the stage to oscillate at the frequency it was tuned to.

Self-oscillation reduced the quality of its reception of an AM (voice) radio signal but made it useful as a CW (Morse code) receiver. The beat signal between the oscillation and the radio signal would produce an audio "beeping" sound. The oscillation of the regenerative receiver could also be a source of local interference. An improved design known as the super-regenerative receiver improved the performance by allowing an oscillation to build up which was then "quenched", with that cycle repeating at a rapid (ultrasonic) rate. From the accompanying schematic for a practical regenerative receiver, one can appreciate its simplicity in relation to a multi-stage TRF receiver, while able to achieve the same level of amplification through the use of positive feedback.

==Direct conversion==
{{Main|Direct-conversion receiver}}
In the [[Direct conversion receiver]], the signals from the antenna are only tuned by a single tuned circuit before entering a [[Frequency mixer|mixer]] where they are mixed with a signal from a [[local oscillator]] which is tuned to the [[carrier wave]] [[frequency]] of the transmitted signal. This is unlike the superheterodyne design, where the local oscillator is at an offset frequency. The output of this mixer is thus audio frequency, which is passed through a [[low pass filter]] into an [[sound reproduction|audio]] amplifier which may drive a speaker.

For receiving [[continuous wave|CW]] ([[morse code]]) the local oscillator is tuned to a frequency slightly different from that of the transmitter in order to turn the received signal into an audible "beep."

*Advantages
**Simpler than a superheterodyne receiver
*Disadvantages
**Poor rejection of strong signals at adjacent frequencies compared to a superheterodyne receiver.
**Increased noise or interference when receiving a [[Single-sideband modulation|SSB]] signal since there is no selectivity against the undesired sideband.

==Superheterodyne==

{{Main|Superheterodyne receiver}}
Practically all modern receivers are of the superheterodyne design. The RF signal from the antenna may have one stage of amplification to improve the receiver's [[noise figure]], although at lower frequencies this is typically omitted. The RF signal enters a  [[Frequency mixer|mixer]], along with the output of the [[local oscillator]], in order to produce a so-called [[intermediate frequency]] (IF) signal. An early optimization of the superheterodyne was to combine the local oscillator and mixer into a single stage called "converter".  The local oscillator is tuned to a frequency somewhat higher (or lower) than the intended reception frequency so that the IF signal will be at a particular frequency where it is further amplified in a narrow-band multistage amplifier. Tuning the receiver involves changing the frequency of the local oscillator, with further processing of the signal (especially in relation to increasing the receiver) conveniently done at a single frequency (the IF frequency) thus requiring no further tuning for different stations.
[[Image:Amplitudemodulationrxwithagc.png|500px|centre|thumb|A [[schematic]] of a [[superhet]] AM receiver. Note that the radio includes an AGC loop in order to maintain the RF and IF stages in their linear region, and to produce an audio output not dependent on the signal power received.]]
Here we show block diagrams for typical superheterodyne receivers for AM and FM broadcast respectively. This particular FM design uses a modern [[phase locked loop]] detector, unlike the frequency ''discriminator'' or [[Detector (radio)#Ratio detector|ratio detector]] used in earlier FM receivers.
[[Image:Fmodulationrxwithoutagc.png|500px|centre|thumb|A [[schematic]] of a simple  [[superhet]] broadcast FM receiver. Note that there is no AGC loop, but simply uses a high-gain IF [[amplifier]] which is intentionally driven into saturation (or ''limiting'').]]

For single conversion superheterodyne AM receivers designed for medium wave (AM broadcast) the IF is commonly 455&amp;nbsp;kHz. Most superheterodyne receivers designed for broadcast FM (88 - 108&amp;nbsp;MHz) use an IF of 10.7&amp;nbsp;MHz. TV receivers often use intermediate frequencies of about 40&amp;nbsp;MHz. Some modern multiband receivers actually convert lower frequency bands first to a much higher frequency (VHF) after which a second mixer with a tunable local oscillator and a second IF stage process the signal as above.

==Software-defined radio==
[[File:SoftRock RXTX Ensemble SDR Transceiver.jpg|thumb|SoftRock RXTX Ensemble SDR Transceiver is a software-defined radio frontend that need a PC with software to demodulate and modulate the [[I-Q signal]]s.]]
{{Main|Software-defined radio}}
Software-defined radio (SDR) is a [[radio]] [[telecommunications|communication]] system where components, that have been traditionally implemented in hardware (e.g. [[frequency mixer|mixer]]s, [[Filter (signal processing)|filter]]s, [[amplifier]]s, [[modulator]]s/[[demodulator]]s, [[detector (radio)|detector]]s, etc.) are instead implemented by means of software on a personal computer or [[embedded system]].&lt;ref&gt;Software Defined Radio: Architectures, Systems and Functions (Markus Dillinger, Kambiz Madani, Nancy Alonistioti) Page xxxiii (Wiley &amp; Sons, 2003, {{ISBN|0-470-85164-3}})&lt;/ref&gt; While the concept of SDR is not new, the rapidly evolving capabilities of digital electronics render practical many processes which used to be only theoretically possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2198">'''Seed counting machines''' (Seed counters) count seeds for research and packaging purposes. The machines typically provide total counts of seeds, or batch sizes for packaging.

==The need for seed counting==
Traditionally, the seed [[packaging industry]] packed seeds by weight using [[weighing scales]].
[[Seeds]] were packed by weight while sold as units.In order to assure the correct quantity of seeds, seed distributors added a safety margin to the packed weight.This safety margin results in loss of revenue.
The seed counter is a uniquely appropriate solution for items that are sold by units as opposed to weight.

'''Single colour reflectometry''' ('''SCORE'''), formerly known as '''imaging Reflectometric Interferometry''' ('''iRIf''') and '''1-lambda Reflectometry''', is a physical method based on interference of monochromatic light at thin films, which is used to investigate (bio-)molecular interactions. The obtained binding curves using SCORE provide detailed information on [[Receptor–ligand kinetics|kinetics]] and [[Equilibrium constant|thermodynamics]] of the observed interaction(s) as well as on concentrations of the used analytes. These data can be relevant for pharmaceutical screening and [[drug design]], [[biosensor]]s and other biomedical applications, diagnostics, and cell-based assays.

[[File:SCORE Principle.png|thumb|Principle of spectral reflectometry|Reflectometry can be either realised by '''1:''' monitoring the shift of an extremum in x-direction via a spectrometer ([[Bio-layer interferometry|BLI]], [[Reflectometric interference spectroscopy|RIfS]]), or '''2:''' monitoring the change in intensity of one wavelength in y-direction via a photodiode or camera (SCORE)]]

== Principle ==
The underlying principle corresponds to that of the [[Fabry–Pérot interferometer|Fabry-Pérot interferometer]], which is also the underlying principle for the [[Reflectometric interference spectroscopy|white-light interferometry]].

== Realisation / setup ==
Monochromatic light is illuminated vertically on the rear side of a transparent multi-layer substrate. The partial beams of the monochromatic light are [[Transmittance|transmitted]] and [[Reflection (physics)|reflected]] at each interphase of the multi-layer system. Superimposition of the reflected beams result in destructive or constructive [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] (depending on wavelength of the used light and the used substrate/multi-layer system materials) that can be detected in an intensity change of the reflected light using a [[photodiode]], [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]], or [[Active pixel sensor|CMOS]] element.

The sensitive layer on top of the multi-layer system can be (bio-)chemically modified with receptor molecules, e.g. antibodies. Binding of specific ligands to the immobilised receptor molecules results in a change [[refractive index]] n and physical thickness d of the sensitive layer. The product of n and d results in the optical thickness (n*d) of the sensitive layer.

[[File:SCORE Binding.png|thumb|Change of reflectance upon analyte binding.|'''1:''' Monochromatic light is reflected at a biolayer interface, '''2:''' upon binding the reflection conditions change, resulting in  '''3:''' a higher reflected intensity due to positive interference]]
[[File:SCORE Binding Curve.png|thumb|Example binding curve in an intensity vs time diagram]]

Monitoring the change of the reflected intensity of the used light over time results in binding curves that provide information on:
* concentration of used ligand
* binding kinetics (association and dissociation rate constants) between receptor and ligand
* binding strength (affinity) between receptor and ligand
* specificity of the interaction between receptor and ligand

Compared to [[bio-layer interferometry]], which monitors the change of the interference pattern of reflected white light, SCORE only monitors the intensity change of the reflected light using a photodiode, CCD, or CMOS element. Thus, it is possible to analyse not only a single interaction but [[Microarray|high-density arrays]] with up to 10,000 interactions per cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;http://biametrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/20170617_APS-Mueller-et-al.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
Compared to [[Surface plasmon resonance|surface plasmon resonance (SPR)]], which penetration depth is limited by the [[evanescent field]], SCORE is limited by the [[coherence length]] of the light source, which is typically a few micrometers. This is especially relevant when investigating whole cell assays. Also, SCORE (as well as BLI) is not influenced by temperature fluctuations during the measurement, while SPR needs thermostabilisation.

== Application ==
SCORE is especially used as detection method in bio- and chemosensors. It is a label-free technique like Reflectometric interference spectroscopy (RIfS), Bio-layer Interferometry (BLI) and Surface plasmon resonance (SPR), which allows time-resolved observation of binding events on the sensor surface without the use of [[fluorescence]] or [[Radioactivity|radioactive]] labels.

The SCORE technology is commercialised by Biametrics GmbH, a service provider and instrument manufacturer with headquarters in [[Tübingen]], Germany.

'''SportVU''' is a camera system hung from the rafters that collects data at a rate of 25 times per second and follows the ball and every player on the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Competitive fire helps Kirk Lacob make his own name with Warriors|url = http://www.sfgate.com/warriors/article/Competitive-fire-helps-Kirk-Lacob-make-his-own-6339796.php|accessdate = June 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; SportVU provides in-depth statistics, including real-time player and ball positioning through sophisticated software and statistical algorithms. SportVU's speed, distance, and possession data provide key insights and analysis points.

SportVU player tracking delivers statistical information via real-time X, Y positioning of players and X, Y, Z positioning of the ball. By leveraging this data, STATS is able to present [[performance metrics]] for players and teams to leverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Moneyball 2.0: How Missile Tracking Cameras Are Remaking The NBA|url = http://www.fastcodesign.com/1670059/moneyball-20-how-missile-tracking-cameras-are-remaking-the-nba|accessdate = June 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a foundation in soccer, STATS expanded the core SportVU technology into basketball beginning with the 2010-2011 NBA season. Today, STATS is the Official Tracking partner of the NBA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SportVU Tracking System Could Find Reach Beyond Court For NBA, Teams             - SportsBusiness Daily {{!}} SportsBusiness Journal {{!}} SportsBusiness Daily Global|url = http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/2013/10/29/NBA-Season-Preview/Tech.aspx|website = www.sportsbusinessdaily.com|accessdate = June 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NBA is using these statistics captured by SportVU on [[NBA|NBA.com]] and [[NBA TV|NBATV]] as well as in arenas across the country to provide fans with insight. SportVU statistics are also being utilized by every&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Stats|url = http://www.fastcompany.com/most-innovative-companies/2014/stats|accessdate = June 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; team in the league to support their pro analytics and aid in player development.

== History ==

=== 2005-2010 ===
SportVU was created in 2005 by Israeli scientists, Gal Oz and Miky Tamir,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sportvu#/entity|title=SportVU {{!}} crunchbase|website=www.crunchbase.com|access-date=2017-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had a background in [[missile tracking]] and [[advanced optical recognition]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wsbc.uoregon.edu/2014/05/24/industry-insights-the-evolution-of-basketball-through-technology/|title=Industry Insights: The Evolution of Basketball through Technology  {{!}} Warsaw Sports Business Club|website=wsbc.uoregon.edu|accessdate=June 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/playbook/tech/post/_/id/492/492|title=Player tracking transforming NBA analytics|last=McCann|first=Zach|date=May 19, 2012|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=March 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They had previously used some of that same science to track soccer matches in Israel.

SportVU was featured at national trade shows [[NAB Show|NAB]] 2007, in Las Vegas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=News: SportVU at NAB 2007|url=https://news.creativecow.net/story/857453|website=news.creativecow.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[International Broadcasting Convention]] 2007, in Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.creativecow.net/story/857868|title=News: SportVU at IBC 2007|website=news.creativecow.net|access-date=2017-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly after, in 2008, SportVU was acquired by [[STATS LLC]], one of the largest sports statistics companies in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|first1=Edit|title=Sports Data Firm Stats Acquires SportVU, Provider of CNN’s Hologram Technology|url=https://gigaom.com/2008/12/02/419-sports-data-firm-stats-acquires-sportvu-provider-of-cnns-hologram-techn/|website=gigaom.com|accessdate=30 March 2017|date=2 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  STATS would go on to center SportVU efforts on basketball.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_25785249/big-data-meets-big-time-basketball|title=Big Data meets big-time basketball|accessdate=June 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 2009 NBA Finals in Orlando, STATS successfully demoed their SportVU technology for NBA executives.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wsbc.uoregon.edu/2014/05/24/industry-insights-the-evolution-of-basketball-through-technology/|title=Industry Insights: The Evolution of Basketball through Technology {{!}} Warsaw Sports Business Club|website=wsbc.uoregon.edu|accessdate=June 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the start of the 2010-2011 NBA season, four teams were contracted to use SportVU, the Dallas Mavericks, Houston Rockets, Oklahoma City Thunder and San Antonio Spurs.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/blog/playbook/tech/post/_/id/492/492|title=Player tracking transforming NBA analytics|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2011-2015 ===
SportVU converted their tracking system from delayed processing to real-time data delivery during the 2011-2012 NBA season.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2014/03/29/new-age-nba-analytics-advantage-overload/1gAim4yKYXGUQ2CTAe7iCO/story.html|title=New age of NBA analytics: Advantage or overload? - The Boston Globe|accessdate=June 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; NBA analytics teams would now be able to utilize tracking data during games.  At the start of the 2012-2013 season, 10 teams were using SportVU.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Since the 2013-2014 NBA season, the SportVU camera system has been installed and in operation in all NBA arenas.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theairspace.net/technology-2/bigger-than-lebron-how-sportvu-will-change-basketball/|title=Bigger than LeBron: How SportVU Will Change Basketball - The Airspace|accessdate=June 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that same year, STATS added the ICE analytics platform to organize, display and analyze SportVU data, used by every team in the NBA.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sportstechie.net/nba-motion-tracking-powered-by-intel-improves-team-performance-and-fan-experience/|title=NBA motion tracking powered by Intel improves team performance and fan experience {{!}} Sports  Techie|website=sportstechie.net|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; NBA team, Toronto Raptors, shared with sports blog, [[Grantland]], their progress with the use of SportVU's new algorithms, which identify new events (touches, dribbles, and passes) and play types (drives, isolations, post ups, and ball screens).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://grantland.com/features/the-toronto-raptors-sportvu-cameras-nba-analytical-revolution/|title=Lights, Cameras, Revolution|last=Lowe|first=Zach|accessdate=June 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Raptors Analytics Team was able to create a graphical user interface to play video footage of the play from the X-Y coordinates retrieved from SportVU.

=== 2016-2017 ===
In 2016, STATS and the NBA met an agreement to extend SportVU tracking data to many more media outlets around the world including [[ESPN]], [[NBA on TNT]], and [[Bleacher Report]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://pr.nba.com/stats-llc-nba-sportvu-player-tracking-data/|title=Stats LLC and NBA to make STATS SportVU Player Tracking data available to more fans than ever before - NBA.com: NBA Communications|date=2016-01-19|work=NBA.com: NBA Communications|access-date=2017-04-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 2016-2017 season, STATS would serve as France's [[Ligue de Football Professionnel]]'s official data and tracking provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.stats.com/press-releases/ligue-de-football-professionnel-selects-stats-official-data-tracking-provider/|title=Ligue de Football Professionnel Selects STATS as Official Data and Tracking Provider - STATS|work=STATS|access-date=2017-04-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; STATS would use SportVU to provide various football data and statistics.

After the NBA's full adoption of SportVU tracking technology in 2013, many statisticians and data scientists have utilized tools such as [[machine learning]] to provide more complex statistics from the tracking data.  At the 10th annual [[MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference]] in 2016, STATS's own Director of Data Science and his team was awarded the grand prize for their contributions to a research paper concerning the prediction of shot outcomes in tennis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.stats.com/press-releases/stats-data-science-team-wins-at-2016-mit-sloan-sports-analytics-conference-research-track-final/|title=STATS’ Data Science Team Wins at 2016 MIT Sloan Sports|work=STATS|access-date=2017-04-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was one of the many research papers completed for the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference that used SportVU data, including [[Kirk Goldsberry]]'s paper in 2014 concerning the prediction of points and evaluation of decision-making in basketball.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://grantland.com/features/expected-value-possession-nba-analytics/|title=DataBall|last=Goldsberry|first=Kirk|date=2014-02-06|work=Grantland|access-date=2017-04-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Littoral explosion at Waikupanaha 2.jpg|Littoral explosion at Waikupanaha ocean entry at the big island of Hawaii was caused by the [[lava]] entering the [[ocean]]|thumb|300px]]
A '''steam explosion''' is an [[explosion]] caused by violent boiling or flashing of water into [[steam]], occurring when water is either [[superheating|superheated]], rapidly heated by fine hot debris produced within it, or heated by the interaction of molten metals  (as in a fuel–coolant interaction, or FCI, of molten nuclear-reactor [[fuel rod]]s with water in a [[nuclear reactor core]] following a [[nuclear meltdown|core-meltdown]]). Pressure vessels, such as [[Pressurized water reactor|pressurized water (nuclear) reactors]], that operate above [[atmospheric pressure]] can also provide the conditions for a steam explosion. The water changes from a liquid to a gas with extreme speed, increasing dramatically in volume. A steam explosion sprays steam and boiling-hot water and the hot medium that heated it in all directions (if not otherwise confined, e.g. by the walls of a container), creating a danger of [[scalding]] and burning.

Steam explosions are not normally [[chemical explosive|chemical explosions]], although a number of substances react chemically with steam (for example, [[zirconium]] and superheated [[graphite]] react with steam and air respectively to give off [[hydrogen]], which burns violently in air) so that chemical explosions and fires may follow. Some steam explosions appear to be special kinds of [[boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion]] (BLEVE), and rely on the release of stored superheat. But many large-scale events, including foundry accidents, show evidence of an energy-release front propagating through the material (see description of FCI below), where the forces create fragments and mix the hot phase into the cold volatile one; and the rapid heat transfer at the front sustains the propagation.

If a steam explosion occurs in a confined tank of water due to rapid heating of the water, the pressure wave and rapidly expanding steam can cause severe [[water hammer]]. This was the mechanism that, in Idaho, USA, in 1961, caused the [[SL-1]] nuclear reactor vessel to jump over {{convert|9|ft}} in the air when it was destroyed by a [[criticality accident]]. In the case of SL-1, the fuel and fuel elements vaporized from instantaneous overheating.

Events of this general type are also possible if the fuel and fuel elements of a liquid-cooled nuclear reactor gradually melt. Such explosions are known as '''fuel–coolant interactions''' (FCI).{{Citation needed|reason=Water is used to cool any water-moderated nuclear reactor (PWR, BWR, etc.), and thus fuel-coolant interactions are required.|date=August 2010}} In these events the passage of the pressure wave through the predispersed material creates flow forces which further fragment the melt, resulting in rapid heat transfer, and thus sustaining the wave. Much of the physical destruction in the [[Chernobyl disaster]], a graphite-moderated, light-water-cooled [[RBMK|RBMK-1000 reactor]], is thought to have been due to such a steam explosion.

In a [[nuclear meltdown]], the most severe outcome of a steam explosion is early containment failure. Two possibilities are the ejection at high pressure of molten fuel into the containment, causing rapid heating; or an in-vessel steam explosion causing ejection of a missile  (such as the upper head) into, and through, the containment. Less dramatic but still significant is that the molten mass of fuel and reactor core melts through the floor of the reactor building and reaches [[ground water]]; a steam explosion might occur, but the debris would probably be contained, and would in fact, being dispersed, probably be more easily cooled. See [[WASH-1400]] for details.

Steam explosions are often encountered where hot [[lava]] meets sea water. Such an occurrence is also called a '''''[[littoral zone|littoral]] explosion'''''. A dangerous steam explosion can also be created when liquid water encounters hot, molten metal. As the water explodes into steam, it splashes the burning hot liquid metal along with it, causing an extreme risk of severe burns to anyone located nearby and creating a fire hazard.

==Practical uses==
===Steam turbines===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2012}}
A water vapor explosion creates a high volume of gas without producing environmentally harmful leftovers. The controlled explosion of water has been used for generating steam in power stations and in modern types of [[steam turbine]]s. Newer steam engines use heated oil to force drops of water to explode and create high pressure in a controlled chamber. The pressure is then used to run a turbine or a converted combustion engine. Hot oil and water explosions are becoming particularly popular in concentrated solar generators, because the water can be separated from the oil in a closed loop without any external energy. Water explosion is considered to be [[environmentally friendly]] if the heat is generated by a renewable resource.

===Flash boiling in cooking===
A cooking technique called flash boiling uses a small amount of water to quicken the process of boiling.  For example, this technique can be used to melt a slice of cheese onto a hamburger patty. The cheese slice is placed on top of the meat on a hot surface such as a frying pan, and a small quantity of cold water is thrown onto the surface near the patty. A vessel (such as a pot or frying-pan cover) is then used to quickly seal the steam-flash reaction, dispersing much of the steamed water on the cheese and patty. This results in a large release of heat, transferred via vaporized water condensing back into a liquid (a principle also utilized in [[refrigerator]] and [[freezer]] production).

==Other rapid boiling phenomena==
High steam generation rates are possible under other circumstances, such as boiler-drum failure, or at a quench front (for example when water re-enters a hot dry boiler). Though potentially damaging, they are usually less energetic than events in which the hot ("fuel") phase is molten and so can be finely fragmented within the volatile ("coolant") phase. Some examples follow:

Steam explosions are naturally produced by certain [[volcano]]es, especially [[stratovolcano]]es, and are a major cause of human fatalities in volcanic eruptions.

The [[Chernobyl nuclear disaster|1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Soviet Union]] was feared to cause major steam explosion (and resulting [[Europe]]-wide [[nuclear fallout|fallout]]) upon melting the [[lava]]-like [[nuclear fuel]] through the [[nuclear reactor|reactor]]'s basement towards contact with residue fire-fighting water and [[groundwater]]. The threat was averted by frantic [[tunnel]]ing underneath the reactor in order to pump out water and reinforce underlying soil with [[concrete]].

When a pressurized container such as the waterside of a steam [[boiler]] ruptures, it is always followed by some degree of steam explosion.  A common [[operating temperature]] and pressure for a marine boiler is around 950 P.S.I. (6.55 MPa) and 850&amp;nbsp;°F (454&amp;nbsp;°C) at the outlet of the superheater.  A steam boiler has an interface of steam and water in the steam drum, which is where the water is finally evaporating due to the heat input, usually oil-fired burners.  When a water tube fails due to any of a variety of reasons, it causes the water in the boiler to expand out of the opening into the furnace area that is only a few P.S.I. above atmospheric pressure.  This will likely extinguish all fires and expands over the large surface area on the sides of the boiler.  To decrease the likelihood of a devastating explosion, boilers have gone from the "[[Fire-tube boiler|fire-tube]]" designs, where the heat was added by passing hot gases through tubes in a body of water, to "[[Water-tube boiler|water-tube]]" boilers that have the water inside of the tubes and the furnace area is around the tubes.  Old "fire-tube" boilers often failed due to poor build quality or lack of maintenance (such as corrosion of the fire tubes, or [[Metal fatigue|fatigue]] of the boiler shell due to constant expansion and contraction).  A failure of fire tubes forces large volumes of high pressure, high temperature steam back down the fire tubes in a fraction of a second and often blows the burners off the front of the boiler, whereas a failure of the pressure vessel surrounding the water would lead to a full and entire evacuation of the boiler's contents in a large steam explosion.  On a marine boiler, this would certainly destroy the ship's propulsion plant and possibly the corresponding end of the ship.

In a more domestic setting, steam explosions can be a result of [[boilover|trying to extinguish burning oil with water]]. When oil in a pan is on fire, the natural impulse may be to extinguish it with water. However, doing so will cause the water to become superheated by the hot oil. Upon turning to steam, it will disperse upwards and outwards rapidly and violently in a spray also containing the ignited oil. It is for this reason that the correct course of action for dealing with such fires is to either use a damp cloth or a tight lid on the pan; both help deprive the fire of [[oxygen]], and the cloth also serves to cool it down. Alternatively, a non-volatile purpose designed [[fire retardant]] agent or simply a [[fire blanket]] can be used instead.

[[File:Stockpot.jpeg|thumb|A [[stainless steel]] stock pot.]]

'''Stock pot''' is a generic name for one of the most common types of cooking pot used worldwide. A stock pot is traditionally used to make [[stock (food)|stock]] or [[broth]], which can be the basis for cooking more complex recipes. It is a wide pot with a flat bottom, straight sides, a wide opening to the full diameter of the pot, two handles on the sides, and a lid with a handle on top.  

French Chef [[Auguste Escoffier]] (1846-1935) published "A Guide to Modern Cookery" in 1907. On the first page, Escoffier writes, "stocks are the keynote of culinary structure" in French cuisine. A stock or broth is made by simmering water for several hours, to continuously cook added foods such as pieces of meat, meat bones, fish or vegetables. The slow simmering process transfers flavours, colours and nutrients to the water, where they blend, and a new ingredient is thus created, the broth or stock.

A broth made with meat or meat bones creates a base with concentrated flavours and aromas, even without the addition of salt or herbs or spices. This is what is referred to as [[soup base]]. Stock pots are also used for cooking stews, porridge, boiled foods, steamed shellfish, and a vast variety of recipes.

Stock pots have great versatility, and so they are used for many cooking purposes, and occasionally non-cooking purposes. Large stock pots may be used at home to boil clothing, wool or yarn for colour dying, for example. They do not come in standard sizes. The size of the pot is normally given on the manufacturer's label by volume, for example 12 litres.

The most common materials for manufacturing stock pots are [[stainless steel]], [[aluminium]], [[copper]] and enamel ([[Vitreous enamel]]) on metal. More expensive types of stock pots have bottoms that are made of layers of different metals, to enhance [[Thermal conductivity|heat conductivity]].

A recent innovation sculpts the pot sides to harness the boiling liquid into a self-stirring pot.&lt;ref&gt;http://translate.google.ca/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ja&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kurukurunabe.jp%2F&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SunGard''' was an American multinational company based in [[Wayne, Pennsylvania]], which provided software and services to education, [[financial services]], and public sector organizations.  It was formed in 1983, as a spin-off of the computer services division of [[Sunoco|Sun Oil Company]].  The name of the company originally was an [[acronym]] which stood for Sun Guaranteed Access to Recovered Data, a reference to the [[disaster recovery]] business it helped pioneer. SunGard was ranked at 480th in the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Fortune 500]] list in the year 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2012/full_list/401_500.html| work=CNN | title=Fortune 500 2012: Fortune 1000 Companies 401-500}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2005 the company was acquired by seven private equity firms and de-listed from the NYSE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/18/us-sungard-sale-idUSBRE95H1CQ20130618|title= Exclusive: SunGard explores $2 billion data unit sale - sources|author= GREG ROUMELIOTIS AND SOYOUNG KIM|date= Jun 18, 2013 |accessdate= 25 Jan 2015|website=www.reuters.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
SunGard was one of the title sponsors of the {{ct|SAX}} pro cycling team until the end of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://borsen.dk/nyheder/finans/artikel/1/219657/bjarne_riis_og_saxo_bank_mister_sungard.html |title=Nyheder fra |publisher=Borsen.dk |date= |accessdate=2012-03-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219201227/http://borsen.dk/nyheder/finans/artikel/1/219657/bjarne_riis_og_saxo_bank_mister_sungard.html |archive-date=2011-12-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, [[FIS (company)|FIS]] announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire SunGard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = FIS to Acquire SunGard, Deepens Enterprise Banking and Capital Markets Solutions|url = http://www.investor.fisglobal.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=180304&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=2079005|website = FIS Global|accessdate = 2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/fis-to-buy-financial-tech-firm-sungard-for-9-1-billion-including-debt-1439378354|title=FIS to Buy SunGard for $5.1 Billion|last=Dezember|first=Ryan|date=2015-08-12|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2018-06-04|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==
SunGard provided software and processing for financial services, [[K-12 education|K-12]] and [[Higher Education]], and the public sector.  It also provided continuity-assurance and production data center hosting services, now part of [[Sungard Availability Services|SunGard AS]].&lt;ref name="spin"/&gt; SunGard had offices in many parts of the world outside of the United States including Paris, South Africa, Tunis, Stockholm, and the United Kingdom.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Acquisitions==
SunGard has historically grown by acquisition.  Past mergers include Performance Pathways, Vericenter, InFlow, Strohl Systems, Comdisco Continuity Services, and Guardian iT PLC on the availability side, Systems &amp; Computer Technology Corp. (SCT) on the higher education side, and Kiodex. Inc.,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bobsguide.com/guide/news/2004/Sep/7/sungard-trading-and-risk-systems-acquires-kiodex-for-asp-based-commodity-risk-management-and-data-services.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[GL Trade]], Oshap (Mint, Decalog), TRAX, Carnot AG, Front Capital Systems (Front Arena), Martini, Monis, [http://www.sungard.com/apt/learnmore APT], Dyatron, Reech, VPM, Phase 3 Systems, Infinity, Microhedge, Reconciliation, Automated Securities Clearance India, Opus Renaissance Software Inc., and National Computer Systems Financial Systems Division on the (primarily financial) software and processing side. SunGard has completed more than 150 acquisitions over the past 20 years.

Among the largest acquisitions were:

* In 1997, SunGard Data Systems acquired '''Infinity Financial Technology''', a designer of trading and risk-management software, for about US$390 million, where $313 million were paid in stock and $77 million went in cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/18/business/company-news-sungard-data-to-acquire-infinity-financial.html | title = SunGard Data to acquire Infinity Financial | publisher = The New York Times | date = 1997-10-18 | accessdate = 2008-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infinity Financial Technology reported revenues of about $60 million in the fiscal year 1996.
* in 1999, SunGard acquired Israel's '''Oshap Technologies''' (Nasdaq:OSHSF) for $210M in stock, giving SunGard a foothold in both the [[middleware]] (via Oshap's subsidiary  Mint Communications) and front-office portfolio management systems markets (via Oshap's subsidiary Decalog).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SunGard buys Israel’s Oshap|url=http://www.efinancialnews.com/story/1999-03-15/sungard-buys-oshap|newspaper=Financial News|date=15 Mar 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2001, SunGard acquired '''Comdisco Inc.’s''' computer disaster-recovery business  after a U.S. appeals court rebuffed a request by the Justice Department to halt the $825 million transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-31/at-t-suit-follows-government-tactics-in-oracle-h-r-block-antitrust-cases.html | work=Bloomberg | first=Tom | last=Schoenberg | title=AT&amp;T Suit Follows Antitrust Tactics With Oracle, H&amp;R Block | date=2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2004, SunGard acquired  Systems &amp; Computer Technology Corp. (SCT) for $590 million in cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/stories/2004/02/09/daily34.html | title = SunGard completes SCT acquisition | publisher = bizjournals.com | date = 2004-02-12 | accessdate = 2012-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2008, SunGard acquired '''[[GL Trade]]''', a Paris-based financial services firm for nearly US$1 billion; in a first tranche a 65% stake in GL Trade was acquired for $625 million, including effect of outstanding stock options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.sungard.com/pressreleases/2008/gltradeacquired100108.aspx | title = SunGard Completes Acquisition of Majority Interest in GL Trade | publisher = www.sungard.com | date = 2008-10-01 | accessdate = 2011-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal encompasses the [[NYSE Euronext]]'s 40% stake in GL Trade, however 25,4% were in the hand of the founders and 36,6% of the shares were free float. The deal was considered to be financially hazardous, given the mere fact that GL Trade reported revenues of €203 million and an EBITDA of €26 million (fiscal year 2007).
* In 2008, SunGard acquired '''[[Strohl Systems]]''', an IT company, direct competitor of SunGard in availability and recovery planning. Strohl Systems became software division of [[Sungard Availability Services|SunGard Availability Services]], located in [[King of Prussia, Pennsylvania|King of Prussia, PA]]
*In 2010 Sungard acquired 365 Hosting Limited cloud computing and data centre services company &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100311006761/en/SunGard-Acquires-Hosting-365|title=SunGard Acquires Hosting 365|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2015, SunGard was acquired by [[FIS (company)]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fisglobal.com/C040107{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}, FIS to Acquire SunGard&lt;/ref&gt;
* In February 2017, [[Vista Equity Partners]] acquired SunGard's Public Sector and Education businesses from FIS, and renamed and rebranded SunGard Public Sector as Superion by April 2017, while adding SunGard Education to its own PowerSchool holdings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sungard-public-sector-is-now-superion-300442567.html | title = SunGard Public Sector is Now Superion | publisher = prnewswire.com | date = 2017-04-20 | accessdate = 2017-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==De-merger activities==
In March 2014 SunGard completed the split-off of its Availability Services business, forming the independent company Sungard AS.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sungard.com/about-us/news/corporate04012014&lt;/ref&gt; Andy Stern continues to lead the Sungard AS business.&lt;ref name="spin"&gt;http://www.sungardas.com/Company/ExecutiveTeam/Pages/AndrewAStern.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011 [[Datatel]] and SunGard's Higher Education group announced the definitive agreement to combine businesses and operate as one company. Datatel’s current chief executive officer, John Speer, will be the chief executive officer of the combined business. Ron Lang, the CEO of SunGard Higher Education, will continue to play an active role in the combined business as vice chairman of the board of directors.

Affiliates of private equity firm [[Hellman &amp; Friedman]] LLC will acquire the SunGard Higher Education businesses from SunGard Data Systems Inc. for an aggregate cash purchase price of US$1.775 billion and combine the acquired businesses. The combined company will operate under a new name, Ellucian, as announced at the 2012 annual users' conference.

On 7 December [[Hellman &amp; Friedman]], [[Datatel]] and SunGard announced that the proposed combination of Datatel and SunGard Higher Education had cleared Department of Justice review and the companies are preparing to close the transaction in the first quarter of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.sungard.com/pressreleases/2011/highered120711.aspx | title = Datatel and SunGard Higher Education Combination Clears Regulatory Review | publisher = www.sungard.com | date = 2011-12-07 | accessdate = 2011-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2012, the combination was announced, with the new company being called Ellucian.&lt;ref name=ellucianannounced&gt;{{cite web|title=Ellucian: New Company Name Announced for Datatel and SunGard Higher Education Combination|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20120326006368/en/Ellucian-Company-Announced-Datatel|publisher=Business Wire|accessdate=20 April 2012|date=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SunGard's total debt of US$8.08 billion will be alleviated by selling the Higher Education business line, however a projected annual revenue shortage of $580 million can be assumed, resulting in a total revenue projection for the fiscal 2011 of $4.7 billion, suggesting a negative revenue trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.sungard.com/pressreleases/2011/corporate07282011.aspx | title = SunGard Announces Second Quarter 2011 Results | publisher = www.sungard.com | date = 2011-07-28 | accessdate = 2011-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, The Capita Group plc acquired SunGard Public Sector Holdings Ltd (part of the business servicing the UK public sector) for £86 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.capita.co.uk/investors/Pages/rns-investor-news.aspx?id=1780 | title = Capita acquires SunGard Public Sector Ltd | publisher = www.capita.co.uk | date = 2010-12-23 | accessdate = 2012-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new business was known as Capita Secure Information Systems; it has now been renamed Capita Secure Managed Services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capitasecureinformationsolutions.co.uk/Pages/home.aspx Capita Secure Information Solutions Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leveraged buyout 2005==
Formerly listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange|NYSE]] ([[ticker symbol]] SDS) on August 11, 2005 the company was acquired by a consortium of seven [[private equity]] investment firms in a transaction valued at $11.3 billion.  The partners in the acquisition were [[Silver Lake Partners]], [[Bain Capital]], [[Blackstone Group]], [[Goldman Sachs Capital Partners]], [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts]], [[Providence Equity Partners]], and [[TPG Capital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/28/business/worldbusiness/28iht-sungard.html?scp=4&amp;sq=sungard%20buyout&amp;st=cse | title = SunGard bought by group for $11.3 billion | publisher = www.nytimes.com | date = 2005-03-29 | accessdate = 2012-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Technoromanticism: Digital Narrative, Holism, and the Romance of the Real''''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] book written by [[Richard Coyne]], published in 1999.

In ''Technoromanticism,'' Coyne shows how narratives about the [[computer]], and [[high technology]] in general, are grounded in [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and romantic traditions. Because of these narratives grounding, discourse about technology is subject to very similar critiques of the Enlightenment and [[romanticism]].

==Plan==

The plan of the book is divided into three parts: unity, multiplicity, and ineffability. In the introduction, the reader is given a summary glimpse of [[technoromanticism]] as an attempt to establish political unity through information, as an attempt to achieve techno-idealism through [[empiricism|empirical realism]], and as an attempt to achieve a digital utopia. Throughout the work he points out the shortcomings of such endeavors.

==Unity==

In the first part of the book, Coyne shows how IT narratives attempt to transcend the material realm. He discusses how romanticism in a [[Neoplatonism|neoplatonic]] guise provides the allure and seduction of [[cyberspace]] and technologies devoted to creating it. (p.&amp;nbsp;63)

==Multiplicity==

In the second part of the book, Coyne discusses how the philosophy of [[empiricism]] is foundational to the [[3d modeling|modeling]] of space and time for computers.

==Ineffability==

What a computer represents is done through [[Computer programming|coding]] and code consists of a symbolic language that can be used to model the world around us. However, for [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]], what is real is what cannot be symbolized or represented. Thus, for Coyne, the computer strongly suggests the idea that there is a fundamental disconnection from reality through the lens of high technology.

'''Television standards conversion''' is the process of changing one type of [[television]] system to another. The most common is from [[NTSC]] to [[PAL]] or the other way around. This is done so television programs in one nation may be viewed in a nation with a different standard. The video is fed through a [[video standards converter]] that changes the video to a different video system.

Converting between different numbers of lines and different frame rates in video pictures is a complex technical problem. However, the international exchange of television programming makes standards conversion necessary and in many cases mandatory.

==History==
The first known case of television systems conversion was in Europe a few years after [[World War II]], mainly with the [[Radiodiffusion-Télévision Française|RTF]] (France) and the [[BBC]] (UK) trying to exchange their [[441 lines|441 line]] and [[405 line]] programming.

The problem got worse with the introduction of [[PAL]], [[SECAM]] (both 625 lines), and the French [[819 line]] service.

Until the 1980s, standards conversion was so difficult that 24 frame/s [[16 mm]] or [[35 mm film]] was the preferred medium of programming interchange.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:BBC optical converter 1960s.png|center]] --&gt;

==Overview==
Perhaps the most technically challenging conversion to make is the PAL to NTSC.
* PAL is 625 lines at 50 fields/s
* NTSC is 525 lines at 59.94 fields/s (60,000/1,001 fields/s)

The two TV standards are for all practical purposes, temporally and spatially incompatible with each other. Aside from the line count being different, converting to a format that requires 60 fields every second from a format that has only 50 fields poses difficulty. Every second, an additional 10 fields must be generated—the converter has to create new frames (from the existing input) in real time.

==Hidden signals: not always transferred==
TV contains many hidden signals. One signal type that is not transferred, except on some very expensive converters, is the [[closed captioning]] signal. [[Teletext]] signals do not need to be transferred, but the captioning data stream should be if it is technologically possible to do so.

With HDTV broadcasting, this is less of an issue, for the most part meaning only passing the captioning datastream on to the new source material. However, [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] and [[ATSC (standards)|ATSC]] have significantly different captioning datastream types.

==Role of information theory==

===Theory behind systems conversion===
[[Information theory]] and the [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem]] imply that conversion from one television standard to another will be easier providing:
* one is going from a higher framerate to a lower framerate ([[NTSC]] to [[PAL]] or [[SECAM]], for example)
* one is going from a higher resolution to a lower resolution ([[High-definition television|HDTV]] to [[NTSC]])
* one is converting from one progressive source to another progressive source (interlaced [[PAL]] and [[NTSC]] are temporally and spatially incompatible with each other)
* interframe motion is limited, so as to reduce temporal or spatial [[judder]]
* signal to noise ratios in the source material are not detrimentally high
* the source material does not possess any continuous (or periodic) signal defect that inhibits translation

===Sampling systems and ratios===
The [[Chroma subsampling#Sampling systems and ratios|subsampling]] in a video system is usually expressed as a three part ratio. The three terms of the ratio are: the number of brightness ("luminance" "luma" or [[YUV|Y]]) [[sampling (signal processing)|samples]], followed by the number of samples of the two color ("chroma") components: [[YUV|U/Cb]] then [[YUV|V/Cr]], for each complete sample area.

For quality comparison, only the ratio between those values is important, so 4:4:4 could easily be called 1:1:1; however, traditionally the value for brightness is always 4, with the rest of the values scaled accordingly.

[[File:Chroma subsampling ratios.png]]

The sampling principles above apply to both digital and analog television.

===Telecine judder===
The "3:2 pulldown" conversion process for 24 frame/s film to television (telecine) creates a slight error in the video signal compared to the original film frames. This is one reason why NTSC films viewed on typical home equipment may not appear as smooth as when viewed in a cinema. The phenomenon is particularly apparent during slow, steady camera movements which appear slightly jerky when telecined. This process is commonly referred to as '''''telecine judder'''''.

PAL material in which 2:2:2:2:2:2:2:2:2:2:2:3 pulldown has been applied, suffers from a similar lack of smoothness, though this effect is not usually called telecine judder.

In effect, every 12th film frame is displayed for the duration of 3 PAL fields (60 milliseconds) whereas the other 11 frames are all displayed for the duration of 2 PAL fields (40 milliseconds). This causes a slight "hiccup" in the video about twice a second.

Television systems converters must avoid creating telecine judder effects during the conversion process. Avoiding this judder is of economic importance as a substantial amount of NTSC (60&amp;nbsp;Hz, technically 29.97 frame/s) resolution material that originates from film &amp;ndash; will have this problem when converted to PAL or SECAM (both 50&amp;nbsp;Hz, 25 frame/s).

==Historical standards conversion techniques==

===Orthicon to orthicon===
This method was used by Ireland to convert 625 line service to 405 line service. It is perhaps the most basic television standard conversion technique. RTÉ used this method during the latter years of its use of the 405 line system.

A standards converter was used to provide the 405 line service, but according to more than one former RTÉ engineering source the converter blew up and afterwards the 405 line service was provided by a 405 line camera pointing at a monitor. This is not the best conversion technique but it can work if one is going from a higher resolution to a lower one &amp;ndash; at the same frame rate. Slow [[phosphor]]s are required on both [[orthicon]]s.

[[File:RTE standards conversion.png|center]]
The first video standards converters were [[Analog television|analog]]. That is, a special [[professional video camera]] that used a [[video camera tube]] would be pointed at a [[Cathode ray tube]] [[video monitor]]. Both the camera and the monitor could be switched to either NTSC or PAL, to convert both ways. [[Robert Bosch GmbH]]'s [[Fernseh]] Division made a large three [[19-inch rack|rack]] analog video standards converter. These were the high end converters of the 1960s and 1970s. Image Transform in Universal City, California, used the Fernseh converter and in the 1980s made their own custom digital converter. This was also a larger three-rack device. As digital [[Computer data storage|memory]] size became larger in smaller packages, converters became the size of a [[microwave oven]]. Today one can buy a very small consumer converter for home use.

===SSTV to PAL and NTSC===
The Apollo moon missions (late 1960s, early 1970s) used [[SSTV]] as opposed to normal bandwidth television; this was mostly done to save battery power (and transmission bandwidth, since the SSTV video from the Apollo missions was [[multiplexing|multiplexed]] with all other voice and telemetry communications from the spacecraft). The camera used only 7 watts of power.

SSTV was used to transmit images from inside [[Apollo 7]], [[Apollo 8]], and [[Apollo 9]], as well as the [[Apollo 11]] [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] television from the [[Moon]]; see [[Apollo TV camera]].
* The SSTV system used in [[NASA]]'s early Apollo missions transferred ten frames per second with a resolution of 320 frame lines using less bandwidth than a normal TV transmission.
* The early SSTV systems used by NASA differ significantly from the SSTV systems currently in use by amateur radio enthusiasts today.
* Standards conversion was necessary so that the missions could be seen by a worldwide audience in both PAL/SECAM (625 lines, 50&amp;nbsp;Hz) and NTSC (525 lines, 60&amp;nbsp;Hz) resolutions.

Later Apollo missions featured color [[field sequential]] cameras that output 60-frame/s video. Each frame corresponded to one of the RGB primary colors. This method is compatible with black and white NTSC, but incompatible with color NTSC. In fact, even NTSC monochrome TV compatibility is marginal. A monochrome set could have reproduced the pictures, but the pictures would have flickered terribly. The camera color video ran at only 10&amp;nbsp; frame/s. Also, Doppler shift in the lunar signal would have caused pictures to tear and flip. For these reasons, the Apollo moon pictures required special conversion techniques.

The conversion steps were completely electromechanical, and they took place in nearly real time. First, the downlink station corrected the pictures for Doppler shift. Next, in an analog disc recorder, the downlink station recorded and replayed every video field six times. On the six-track recorder, recording and playback took place simultaneously. After the recorder, analog video processors added the missing components of the NTSC color signal: These components included:
* The 3.58-MHz color burst
* The high-resolution monochrome signal
* The sound
* The I and Q color signals

The conversion delay lasted only some 10 seconds. Then color moon pictures left the downlink station for world distribution.

==Standards conversion methods in common use==

===Nyquist subsampling===
This conversion technique may become popular with manufacturers of HDTV --&gt; NTSC and HDTV --&gt; PAL converter boxes for the ongoing global conversion to HDTV.
* Multiple Nyquist subsampling was used by the defunct MUSE HDTV system that was used in Japan.
* MUSE chipsets that can be used for systems conversion do exist, or can be revised for the needs of HDTV --&gt; Analog TV converter boxes.

====How it works====
In a typical image transmission setup, all stationary images are transmitted at full resolution. Moving pictures possess a lower resolution visually, based on complexity of interframe image content.

When one uses [[Downsampling|Nyquist subsampling]] as a standards conversion technique, the horizontal and vertical resolution of the material are reduced &amp;ndash; this is an excellent method for converting HDTV to standard definition television, but it works very poorly in reverse.
* As the horizontal and vertical content change from frame to frame, moving images will be blurred (in a manner similar to using 16&amp;nbsp;mm movie film for HDTV projection).
* In fact, whole-camera pans would result in a loss of 50% of the horizontal resolution.

The Nyquist subsampling method of systems conversion only works for HDTV to [[Standard-definition television|Standard Definition Television]], so as a standards conversion technology it has a very limited use. Phase Correlation is usually preferred for HDTV to standard definition conversion.

===Framerate conversion===
There is a large difference in [[frame rate]] between film (24.0 frames per second) and NTSC (approximately 29.97 frames per second). Unlike the two other most common [[video formats]], [[PAL]] and [[SECAM]], this difference cannot be overcome by a simple [[PAL#PAL speed-up|speed-up]], because the required 25% speed-up would be clearly noticeable.

To convert 24 frame/s film to 29.97 frame/s (presented as 59.94 interlaced fields per second) NTSC, a complex process called "[[Telecine#3:2 pulldown|3:2 pulldown]]" is used, in which every other film frame is duplicated across an additional interlaced field to achieve a framerate of 23.976 (the audio is slowed imperceptibly from the 24 frame/s source to match). This produces irregularities in the sequence of images which some people can perceive as a stutter during slow and steady pans of the camera in the source material. See [[telecine]] for more details.

For viewing native PAL or SECAM material (such as European [[television series]] and some European movies) on NTSC equipment, a standards conversion has to take place. There are basically two ways to accomplish this.
*The framerate can be slowed from 25 to 23.976 frames per second (a slowdown of about 4%) to subsequently apply [[Telecine#3:2 pulldown|3:2 pulldown]].
*[[Interpolation]] of the contents of adjacent [[film frame|frames]] in order to produce new intermediate frames; this introduces [[artifact (error)|artifacts]], and even the most modestly trained of eyes can quickly spot video that has been converted between formats.

===Linear interpolation===
When converting [[PAL]] (625 lines @ 25 frame/s) to [[NTSC]] (525 lines @ 30 frame/s), the converter must eliminate 100 lines per frame. The converter must also create five frames per second.

To reduce the 625-line signal to 525, less expensive converters drop 100 lines. These converters maintain picture fidelity by evenly spacing removed lines. (For example, the system might discard every sixth line from each PAL field. After the 50th discard, this process would stop. By then the system would have passed the viewable area of the field. In the following field, the process would repeat, completing one frame.) To create the five additional frames, the converter repeats every fifth frame.

If there is little inter-frame motion, this conversion algorithm is fast, inexpensive and effective. Many inexpensive consumer television system converters have employed this technique. Yet in practise, most video features significant inter-frame motion. To reduce conversion artefacts, more modern or expensive equipment may use sophisticated techniques.

==== Doubler ====
The most basic and literal way to double lines is to repeat each scanline, though the results of this are generally very crude. Linear interpolation use digital interpolation to recreate the missing lines in an interlaced signal, and the resulting quality depends on the technique used. Generally the bob version of linear deinterlacer will only interpolate within a single field, rather than merging information from adjacent fields, to preserve the smoothness of motion, resulting in a frame rate equal to the field rate (i.e. a 60i signal would be converted to 60p.) The former technique in moving areas and the latter in static areas, which improves overall sharpness.

===Interfield interpolation===

Interfield Interpolation is a technique in which new frames are created by blending adjacent frames, rather than repeating a single frame. This is more complex and computationally expensive than linear interpolation, because it requires the interpolator to have knowledge of the preceding and the following frames to produce an intermediate blended frame.  [[Deinterlacing]] may also be required in order to produce images which can be interpolated smoothly. Interpolation can also be used to reduce the number of scanlines in the image by averaging the colour and intensity of pixels on neighbouring lines, a technique similar to [[Bilinear filtering]], but applied to only one axis.

There are simple 2-line and 4 line converters. The 2-line converter creates a new line by comparing two adjacent lines, whereas a 4-line model compares 4 lines to average the 5th. Interfield interpolation ''reduces'' judder, but at the expense of picture smearing. The greater the blending applied to smooth out the judder, the greater the smear caused by blending.

===Adaptive motion interpolation===
Some more advanced techniques measure the nature and degree of inter-frame motion in the source, and use adaptive algorithms to blend the image based on the results. Some such techniques are known as [[motion compensation]] algorithms, and are computationally much more expensive than the simpler techniques, thus requiring more powerful hardware to be effective in real-time conversion.

Adaptive Motion algorithms capitalize on the way the human eye and brain process moving images - in particular, detail is perceived less clearly on moving objects.

Adaptive interpolation requires that the converter analyzes multiple successive fields and to detect the amount and type of motion of different areas of the picture.
* Where little motion is detected, the converter can use linear interpolation.
* When greater motion is detected, the converter can switch to an inter-field technique which sacrifices detail for smoother motion.

''Adaptive Motion Interpolation has many variations and is commonly found in midrange converters''. The quality and cost is dependent upon the accuracy in analyzing the type and amount of motion, and the selection of the most appropriate algorithm for processing the type of motion.

===Adaptive motion interpolation + block matching===
Block matching involves dividing the image into mosaic blocks - say perhaps for the sake of explanation, 8x8 pixels. The blocks are then stored in memory. The next field read out is also divided up into the same number and size of mosaic blocks. The converter's computer then goes to work and starts matching up blocks. The blocks that stayed in the same relative position (read: there was no motion in this part of the image) receive relatively little processing.
* For each block that changed, the converter searches in every direction through its memory, looking for a match to find out where the "block" went (if there's motion, the block obviously had to have gone somewhere..).
* The search starts at the immediate surrounding blocks (assuming little motion).
* If a match isn't found, then it searches further and further out until it finds a match.
* When the matching block is found, the converter then knows how far the block moved and in which direction.
* This data is then stored as a motion vector for this block.
* Since interframe motion is often predictable owing to Newton's laws of motion in the real world, the motion vector can then be used to calculate where the block will probably be in the next field.
* The Newtonian method saves a lot of search and processing time.

When panning from left to right is taking place (over say 10 fields) it is safe to assume that the 11th field will be similar or very close.
* Block matching can be seen as the "cutting and pasting" of image blocks.

The technique is highly effective but it does require a tremendous amount of computing power. Consider a block of only 8x8 pixels. For each block, the computer has 64 possible directions and 64 pixels to be matched to the block in the next field. Also consider that the greater the motion, the further out the search must be conducted. Just to find an adjacent block in the next field would entail making a search of 9 blocks. 2 blocks out would require a search and match of 25 blocks - 3 blocks further distant and it grows to 49 etc.

The type of motion can exponentially compound the compute power required. Consider a rotating object, where a simple straight line motion vector is of little help in predicting where the next block should match. It can quickly be seen that the more inter frame motion introduced, the much greater the processing power required. This is the general concept of block matching. Block match converters can vary widely in price and performance depending on the attention to detail and complexity.

A weird artifact of block matching owes to the size of the block itself. If a moving object is smaller than the mosaic block, consider that it's the entire block that gets moved. In most cases, it's not an issue, but consider a thrown baseball. The ball itself has a high motion vector, but its background that makes up the rest of the block might not have any motion. The background gets transported in the moved block as well, based on the motion vector of the baseball, What you might see is the ball with a small amount of outfield or whatever, tagging along. As it's in motion, the block may be "soft" depending upon what additional techniques were used and barely noticeable unless you're looking for it.

Block matching requires a staggering amount of processing horsepower, but today's microprocessors are making it a viable solution.

===Phase correlation===
Phase correlation is perhaps the most computationally complex of the general algorithms.

Phase correlation's success lies in the fact that it is effective with coping with rapid motion and random motion. Phase correlation does not easily get confused by rotating or twirling objects that confuse most other kinds of systems converters. Phase correlation is elegant as well as technically and conceptually complex. Its successful operation is derived by performing a Fourier transform to each field of video.

A [[Fast Fourier Transform]] (FFT) is an algorithm which deals with the transformation of discrete values (in this case image pixels). When applied to a sample of finite values, a Fast Fourier Transform expresses any changes (motion) in terms of frequency components.

Since the result of the FFT represents only the inter-frame changes in terms of frequency distribution, there is far less data that has to be processed in order to calculate the motion vectors.

==DTV to analog converters for consumers==
A '''digital television adapter''', ([[Coupon-eligible converter box|CECB]]), or digital-to-analog converter (box), is a device that receives, by means of an [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]], a [[digital television]] (DTV) [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]], and converts that signal into an [[analog television]] signal that can be received and displayed on an analog television.

These boxes cheaply convert HDTV (16:9 at 720 or 1080) to (NTSC or PAL at 4:3). Very little is known about the specific conversion technologies used by these converter boxes in the PAL and NTSC zones.

Downconversion is usually required, hence very little image quality loss is perceived by viewers at the recommended viewing distance with most TV sets.

==Offline conversion==
A lot of cross format television conversion is done offline. There are several DVD packages that offer offline [[PAL]] &lt;--&gt; [[NTSC]] conversion &amp;ndash; including cross conversion (technically [[MPEG]] &lt;--&gt; [[Digital television|DTV]]) from the myriad of [[MPEG]] based web video formats.

Cross conversion can use any method commonly in use for TV system format conversion, but typically (in order to reduce complexity and memory use) it is left up to the codec to do the conversion. Most modern DVDs are converted from 525 &lt;--&gt; 625 lines in this way, as it is very economical for most programming that originates at [[Enhanced-definition television|EDTV]] resolution.

'''''The Internship''''' is a 2013 American [[comedy film]] directed by [[Shawn Levy]], written by [[Vince Vaughn]] and Jared Stern, and produced by Vaughn and Levy. The film stars Vince Vaughn and [[Owen Wilson]] as recently laid-off salesmen who attempt to compete with much younger and more technically skilled applicants for a job at [[Google]]. [[Rose Byrne]], [[Max Minghella]], [[Aasif Mandvi]], [[Josh Brener]], [[Dylan O'Brien]], Tobit Raphael, [[Tiya Sircar]], [[Josh Gad]], and [[Jessica Szohr]] also star.

''The Internship'' is the second film with Vaughn and Wilson in the lead roles, after the 2005 film ''[[Wedding Crashers]]''; the two had also both appeared in the 2004 film ''[[Starsky &amp; Hutch (film)|Starsky &amp; Hutch]]''. This is also the second collaboration of Levy, Vaughn, and Stern after the 2012 film ''[[The Watch (2012 film)|The Watch]]'', and the third of Levy and Wilson after the first two ''[[Night at the Museum]]'' films.

Released on June 7, 2013, the film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $93 million worldwide.

==Plot==
Salesmen Billy McMahon and Nick Campbell's employer goes out of business, and Billy applies for [[Google]] internships on their behalf. They are accepted due to their unorthodox interview answers, despite a lack of relevant experience. They are the only interns not of traditional collegiate age. They will spend the summer competing in teams against other interns in a variety of tasks, and only the members of the winning team will be guaranteed jobs with Google. Billy and Nick are teamed with other interns seen as rejects: Stuart, who is usually engrossed in his smart phone; Yo-Yo, a [[Filipino Americans|Filipino-American]] who was homeschooled by his [[Tiger parenting|tiger mother]]; and Neha, an [[Indian Americans|Indian-American]] who is an enthusiast of nerd-related [[Kink (sexuality)|kink]]. The team is led by Lyle, who constantly tries to act hip in order to hide his insecurities. Another intern, Graham, bullies Billy and Nick's team. Mr. Chetty, the head of the internship program, also expresses his doubts about the older men's abilities. Stuart, Yo-Yo, and Neha see Billy and Nick as useless during a task focused on debugging and send them on a [[Snipe hunt|wild-goose chase]] for the fictional [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] at [[Stanford University]]. But later, during a game of [[Quidditch (sport)|Quidditch]] against Graham's team, Billy rallies his team to a comeback that unifies them as a team, despite ultimately losing after Graham cheats.

When the teams are tasked with developing an app, Billy and Nick convince the team to indulge in a wild night out. At a strip club, Neha admits to Billy that, despite her rich fantasy life, she has no real world experience and is nervous. With his support, she decides to stay. Nick gets Yo-Yo to break out of his shell by drinking and receiving [[lap dance]]s. Encouraged by Billy, Lyle approaches one of the dancers, Marielena, who is also a dance instructor at Google on whom he had developed a crush. She is charmed by him, but another customer challenges Lyle for her attention and they fight, getting the team kicked out. Before sunrise, Stuart learns to appreciate his surroundings while overlooking the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], and Lyle's drunken antics inspire the team to create an app that guards against reckless phone usage while drunk. They win the task by earning the most downloads.

Meanwhile, Nick has been flirting with an executive, Dana, with little success. When he begins attending technical presentations to impress her, he develops an interest in the material. While the teams prepare to staff the technical support hotline, only Billy feels at a loss. A Google employee, "Headphones," who always wears headphones and never socializes, approaches Billy and tells him that the way he interacts with people is special. He tutors Billy on the technical information. Dana agrees to go on a date with Nick, and she invites him in at the end of the evening. During the task, Billy is comfortable with the material, but his team receives no score because he failed to properly log his calls for review. Dejected, Billy leaves Google to pursue a new sales opportunity with his former boss. The final task is announced as a sales challenge. Teams must sign the largest possible company to begin advertising with Google. The team is stunned when Nick tells them that Billy has left, and they declare that they do not want to do the task without him. Nick convinces Billy to return, and Billy leads the team to show a local pizzeria owner how Google can help him interact with potential customers and thereby expand his business, while remaining true to his professional values.

Chetty is about to announce that Graham's team have won, when Billy, Nick, and their team arrive to give a dynamic presentation about their new client. Chetty recognizes that although the pizzeria is not a large business, its potential is limitless because it is expanding via technology. Graham protests and is [[Dressing down|dressed down]] by Headphones, who turns out to be the head of [[Google Search]]. Nick and Billy's team win the challenge and the guaranteed jobs. Graham berates his team, who finally reject him. As the students depart, Nick and Dana are still seeing each other, as are Lyle and Marielena. Stuart and Neha have formed a romantic connection as well with Stuart promising to see her in person rather than texting her, and Yo-Yo asserts himself to his mother. Billy and Nick toast their success.

==Production==

Most of the scenes were filmed in [[Atlanta]], Georgia, and at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]], which posed as a double for [[Googleplex]]. Vaughn came up with the idea after watching a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' segment on Google's work culture, and subsequently brought the idea to director Shawn Levy. &lt;ref name="60 minutes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ronald|first1=Grover|last2=ALEXI|first2=ORESKOVIC|title=Google goes Hollywood with 'The Internship'|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/google-movie-idINDEE94R0FP20130528|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google agreed to work with the film producers, with founder Larry Page noting that "computer science has a marketing problem." &lt;ref name="GoogleCNN"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kelly|first1=Heather|title=Why Google loves 'The Internship'|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/05/tech/innovation/internship-movie-google/|website=CNN|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google also felt it would help further explain their "[[Don't be evil|Don't be evil]]" mantra.&lt;ref name="GoogleCNN"/&gt; Although Reuters reported that as part of the deal Google asked for "Creative control", Levy denied the company was involved with the script, insisting that Google only assisted from a "technical" perspective. &lt;ref name="60 minutes"/&gt; CNN reported that the studio did give "some control" to Google over the depiction of its products. &lt;ref name="GoogleCNN"/&gt;

==Reception==
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 35% based on 164 reviews and an average rating of 4.8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "''The Internship'' weighs down Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson's comic charisma with a formulaic script and padded running time that leans far too heavily on its stars' easygoing interplay."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Internship|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_internship_2013/|work=Rotten Tomatoes by [[Flixster]]|accessdate=October 1, 2016|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6IeZjWiFj|archivedate=August 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 42 out of 100 based on 36 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-internship |title=''The Internship'' |publisher=[[Metacritic]]/[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=August 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade "B+" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt; {{cite web |url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A majority of the reviewers have derided it for being a feature-length Google commercial. In his review, Ty Burr of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' commented: "Here’s why Google is so successful: It's figured out a way for Twentieth Century Fox to make a two-hour Google commercial disguised as a summer comedy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/2013/06/05/vaughn-and-wilson-are-silicon-valley-crashers/WJoZVKxj4DKnkiuaokh68N/story.html |title=Vaughn and Wilson Are Silicon Valley Crashers |author= Burr, Ty |publisher=''[[The Boston Globe]]'' |date=2013-06-05 |accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Rea of ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' wrote on his review, "''The Internship'' itself would be kind of charming, too, if this Google-recruitment film, this 119-minute commercial for Googliness, weren't so downright creepy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philly.com/philly/entertainment/movies/20130607_Buddy_film_wrapped_up_in_a_Google_ad.html |title=Buddy Film Wrapped in a Google Ad |author=Rea, Stephen |publisher=''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' |date=2013-06-07 |accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s David Cox described the movie as a "two-hour corporate video,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/jul/01/internship-google-cinema-sells-its-soul | title=The Internship: how cinema sold its soul – but didn't get paid | publisher=The Guardian (UK)| date=1 July 2013 | accessdate=2 August 2013 | author=Cox, David | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6IZSVb3g6 | archivedate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while British film critic [[Mark Kermode]] called the film "the longest advert I've seen in the cinema". He dismissed it as "one of the most witless, humourless, vomit-inducing horribly self-satisfied, smug, unfunny comedies I have ever seen".&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|rGNPWblGTsQ|"Mark Kermode reviews The Internship"}}, ''The Guardian (UK)'', 1 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another critique was that combining Vaughn and Wilson with Google was poorly timed, and that the film would have been much more successful, had it been released on the heels of Vaughn and Wilson's success in 2005's ''[[Wedding Crashers]]''. This fact of timing was satirized by a video news story run by ''[[The Onion]]'', a satirical newspaper, titled "The Internship Poised to be Biggest Comedy of 2005".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theonion.com/video/the-internship-poised-to-be-biggest-comedy-of-2005,32682/ "'The Internship' Poised To Be Biggest Comedy Of 2005"], ''The Onion'', 6 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many former Google interns and Google employees noted the accuracy of the company environment depicted in the movie, but also pointed out that the internship process is nothing like that shown in the movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anthony |first=Brian |url=http://mashable.com/2013/06/09/google-the-internship/ |title=Real Google Interns: 'The Internship' Movie Kind of Nails It |publisher=Mashable.com |date=2013-06-09 |accessdate=2014-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tunnel|Tunnels]] are dug in types of materials varying from soft clay to hard rock. The method of '''tunnel construction''' depends on such factors as the ground conditions, the ground water conditions, the length and diameter of the tunnel drive, the depth of the tunnel, the logistics of supporting the tunnel excavation, the final use and shape of the tunnel and appropriate risk management.

There are three basic types of tunnel construction in common use:
* Cut-and-cover tunnel, constructed in a shallow trench and then covered over.
* Bored tunnel, constructed in situ, without removing the ground above. They are usually of circular or horseshoe cross-section. Some concepts of [[underground mining]] apply. Modern techniques include [[Shotcrete]] used in the [[New Austrian tunnelling method]], use of a [[tunnel boring machine]] or [[tunnelling shield]]. But still tunnes are constructed which are secured with [[pit prop]]s and [[shoring]] and then are steined or timer supports are set. Techniques known from [[barrel vault]]s are helpful. 
* Immersed tube tunnel, sunk into a body of water and laid on or buried just under its bed.

== Cost ==

In 2017 experiences show that city subway underground tunnels cost approximately 500 Mio EUR per kilometer. In Switzerland a kilometer of motorway tunnel was roughly calculated at 300 Mio CHF, at the time 200 Mio Eur. The [[Fehmarn Belt Fixed Link|undersea tunnel between Denmark and Germany]] is planned for 425 Mio per km, in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://youtube.com/hpDHwfXbpfg?t=187 Elon Musk on LA subway extension], TED interview, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nzz.ch/articleDEMU1-1.190572 Warum 1 Meter Autobahn 300 000 Franken kosten kann], NZZ, 2005-12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/fehmarnbelt-querung-daenisches-parlament-beschliesst-ostsee-tunnel-a-1031146.html Dänisches Parlament beschließt Bau des Ostsee-Tunnels], Der Spiegel, 2015-04-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cut-and-cover ==

[[File:Paris Metro construction 03300288-3.jpg|thumb|Cut-and-cover construction of the [[Paris Métro]] in [[France]]]]

'''Cut-and-cover''' is a simple method of construction for shallow tunnels where a [[trench]] is excavated and [[roof]]ed over with an overhead support system strong enough to carry the load of what is to be built above the tunnel.
Two basic forms of cut-and-cover tunnelling are available:
* ''Bottom-up method'': A trench is excavated, with ground support as necessary, and the tunnel is constructed in it. The tunnel may be of in situ concrete, precast concrete, precast arches, or corrugated steel arches; in early days brickwork was used. The trench is then carefully back-filled and the surface is reinstated.
* ''Top-down method'': Side support walls and capping beams are constructed from ground level by such methods as [[slurry wall]]ing or contiguous bored piling. Then a shallow excavation allows making the tunnel roof of precast beams or in situ concrete. The surface is then reinstated except for access openings. This allows early reinstatement of roadways, services and other surface features. Excavation then takes place under the permanent tunnel roof, and the base slab is constructed.

Shallow tunnels are often of the cut-and-cover type (if under water, of the immersed-tube type), while deep tunnels are excavated, often using a [[tunnelling shield]]. For intermediate levels, both methods are possible.

Large cut-and-cover boxes are often used for underground [[Rapid transit|metro]] stations, such as [[Canary Wharf tube station]] in London. This construction form generally has two levels, which allows economical arrangements for ticket hall, station platforms, passenger access and emergency egress, ventilation and smoke control, staff rooms, and equipment rooms. The interior of Canary Wharf station has been likened to an underground cathedral, owing to the sheer size of the excavation. This contrasts with many traditional stations on [[London Underground]], where bored tunnels were used for stations and passenger access. Nevertheless, the original parts of the London Underground network, the Metropolitan and District Railways, were constructed using cut-and-cover. These lines pre-dated electric traction and the proximity to the surface was useful to ventilate the inevitable smoke and steam.

A major disadvantage of cut-and-cover is the widespread disruption generated at the surface level during construction. This, and the availability of electric traction, brought about London Underground's switch to bored tunnels at a deeper level towards the end of the 19th century.

== Boring machines ==

{{Main article|Tunnel boring machine}}
[[File:TBM S-210 Alptransit Faido East.jpg|thumb|A workman is dwarfed by the [[tunnel boring machine]] used to excavate the [[Gotthard Base Tunnel]] ([[Switzerland]]), the world's longest.]]

Tunnel boring machines (TBMs) and associated back-up systems are used to highly automate the entire tunnelling process, reducing tunnelling costs. In certain predominantly urban applications, tunnel boring is viewed as quick and cost effective alternative to laying surface rails and roads. Expensive [[eminent domain|compulsory purchase]] of buildings and land, with potentially lengthy planning inquiries, is eliminated. Disadvantages of TBMs arise from their usually large size – the difficulty of transporting the large TBM to the site of tunnel construction, or (alternatively) the high cost of assembling the TBM on-site, often within the confines of the tunnel being constructed.

There are a variety of TBM designs that can operate in a variety of conditions, from hard rock to soft water-bearing ground. Some types of TBMs, the bentonite slurry and earth-pressure balance machines, have pressurised compartments at the front end, allowing them to be used in difficult conditions below the [[water table]]. This pressurizes the ground ahead of the TBM cutter head to balance the water pressure. The operators work in normal air pressure behind the pressurised compartment, but may occasionally have to enter that compartment to renew or repair the cutters. This requires special precautions, such as local ground treatment or halting the TBM at a position free from water. Despite these difficulties, TBMs are now preferred over the older method of tunnelling in compressed air, with an air lock/decompression chamber some way back from the TBM, which required operators to work in high pressure and go through decompression procedures at the end of their shifts, much like [[underwater diving|deep-sea divers]].

In February 2010, Aker Wirth delivered a TBM to Switzerland, for the expansion of the [[Linth–Limmern Power Stations]] located south of [[Linthal, Glarus|Linthal]] in the [[canton of Glarus]]. The borehole has a diameter of {{convert|8.03|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tunnelsonline.info/story.asp?sectioncode=1&amp;storycode=61846 |title=Tunnels &amp; Tunnelling International |publisher=Tunnelsonline.info |accessdate=2013-04-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316162001/http://www.tunnelsonline.info/story.asp?sectioncode=1&amp;storycode=61846 |archivedate=2012-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The four TBMs used for excavating the {{convert|57|km|mi|adj=on}} [[Gotthard Base Tunnel]], in [[Switzerland]], had a diameter of about {{convert|9|m|ft}}. A larger TBM was built to bore the Green Heart Tunnel (Dutch: Tunnel Groene Hart) as part of the [[HSL-Zuid]] in the Netherlands, with a diameter of {{convert|14.87|m|ft|1}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hslzuid.nl/hsl/uk/bouw/ment/Bored_Tunnel_Groene_Hart/index.jsp |title=The Groene Hart Tunnel |publisher=Hslzuid.nl |accessdate=2013-04-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925160241/http://www.hslzuid.nl/hsl/uk/bouw/ment/Bored_Tunnel_Groene_Hart/index.jsp |archivedate=September 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn was superseded by the [[Autopista de Circunvalación M-30|Madrid M30 ringroad]], [[Spain]], and the [[Shanghai Yangtze River Tunnel and Bridge|Chong Ming]] tunnels in [[Shanghai]], [[China]]. All of these machines were built at least partly by [[Herrenknecht]]. {{As of|2013|August|}}, the world's largest TBM is "[[Bertha (tunnel boring machine)|Big Bertha]]", a {{convert|57.5|ft|adj = on}} diameter machine built by [[Hitachi Zosen Corporation]], which is digging the [[Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement tunnel]] in [[Seattle, Washington]] (US).&lt;ref name="NYT Dec 2012"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/05/us/projects-to-transform-seattle-all-along-the-waterfront.html |title=Engineering Projects Will Transform Seattle, All Along the Waterfront |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 4, 2012 |first=Kirk |last=Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clay-kicking ==

Clay-kicking is a specialised method developed in the [[United Kingdom]] of digging tunnels in strong clay-based soil structures. Unlike previous manual methods of using [[mattock]]s which relied on the soil structure to be hard, clay-kicking was relatively silent and hence did not harm soft clay-based structures. The clay-kicker lies on a plank at a 45-degree angle away from the working face and inserts a tool with a cup-like rounded end with the feet. Turning the tool manually, the kicker extracts a section of soil, which is then placed on the waste extract.

Used in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] civil engineering, the method found favour in the renewal of Britain's ancient [[sewerage]] systems, by not having to remove all property or infrastructure to create a small tunnel system. During the [[First World War]], the system was used by [[Royal Engineer tunnelling companies]] to put mines beneath the [[German Empire]] lines. The method was virtually silent and so not susceptible to listening methods of detection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tunnellersmemorial.com/Tunnelling.htm |title=Tunnelling |publisher=tunnellersmemorial.com |accessdate=2010-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823081917/http://tunnellersmemorial.com/Tunnelling.htm |archivedate=August 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shafts ==

[[File:Mersey Railway Tunnel - ventilation and drainage machinery.png|right|thumb|1886 illustration showing the ventilation and drainage system of the Mersey railway tunnel]]
A temporary access [[Shaft (civil engineering)|shaft]] is sometimes necessary during the excavation of a tunnel. They are usually circular and go straight down until they reach the level at which the tunnel is going to be built. A shaft normally has concrete walls and is usually built to be permanent. Once the access shafts are complete, TBMs are lowered to the bottom and excavation can start. Shafts are the main entrance in and out of the tunnel until the project is completed. If a tunnel is going to be long, multiple shafts at various locations may be bored so that entrance to the tunnel is closer to the unexcavated area.&lt;ref name="Engineers. 1978"&gt;United States Army Corps of Engineers. (1978). Tunnels and shafts in rock. Washington, DC: Department of the Army.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once construction is complete, construction access shafts are often used as [[ventilation shaft]]s, and may also be used as emergency exits.

== Sprayed concrete techniques ==

The [[New Austrian Tunnelling method|New Austrian Tunneling Method]] (NATM) was developed in the 1960s and is the best known of a number of engineering practices that use calculated and empirical measurements to provide safe support to the tunnel lining. The main idea of this method is to use the geological [[stress (physics)|stress]] of the surrounding [[Rock (geology)|rock]] [[mass]] to stabilize the tunnel, by allowing a measured relaxation and stress reassignment into the surrounding rock to prevent full loads becoming imposed on the supports. Based on [[geotechnical]] measurements, an optimal [[cross section (geometry)|cross section]] is computed. The excavation is protected by a layer of sprayed concrete, commonly referred to as [[shotcrete]]. Other support measures can include steel arches, rockbolts and mesh. Technological developments in sprayed concrete technology have resulted in steel and polypropylene fibres being added to the concrete mix to improve lining strength. This creates a natural load-bearing ring, which minimizes the rock's [[Deformation (mechanics)|deformation]].

[[File:Hill 60 illowra battery port kembla.jpg|thumb|[[Illowra Battery]] utility tunnel, Port Kembla. One of many [[Template:Barracks Batteries Bunkers and Forts in Sydney|bunkers south of Sydney]].]]

By special [[Condition monitoring|monitoring]] the NATM method is flexible, even at surprising changes of the [[geomechanics|geomechanical]] rock consistency during the tunneling work. The measured rock properties lead to appropriate [[tool]]s for tunnel [[Strength of materials|strengthening]]. In the last decades also soft ground excavations up to {{convert|10|km|mi}} became usual.

== Pipe jacking ==

{{Main article|Pipe jacking}}

In '''[[pipe jacking]]''', [[hydraulic jack]]s are used to push specially made pipes through the ground behind a TBM or shield. This method is commonly used to create tunnels under existing structures, such as roads or railways. Tunnels constructed by pipe jacking are normally small diameter bores with a maximum size of around {{convert|3.2|m}}.

== Box jacking ==

Box jacking is similar to pipe jacking, but instead of jacking tubes, a box-shaped tunnel is used. Jacked boxes can be a much larger span than a pipe jack, with the span of some box jacks in excess of {{convert|20|m}}. A cutting head is normally used at the front of the box being jacked, and spoil removal is normally by excavator from within the box.Recent developments of the Jacked Arch and Jacked deck have enabled longer and larger structures to be installed to close accuracy. The 126m long 20m clear span underpass below the high speed rail lines at Cliffsend in Kent, UK.

== Underwater tunnels ==

[[File:Georgiaaquariumtunnel.jpg|thumb|[[Shark tunnel]] at the [[Georgia Aquarium]]]]
{{Main article|Undersea tunnel}}

There are also several approaches to underwater tunnels, the two most common being bored tunnels or [[immersed tube]]s, examples are [[Bjørvika Tunnel]] and [[Marmaray]]. [[Submerged floating tunnel]]s are a novel approach under consideration; however, no such tunnels have been constructed to date.

== Landtunnels ==

A new kind of tunnels is used to reduce the environmental impact of motorways or railways: landtunnels. These are not underground tunnels, but built at ground level. The urban area next to the tunnel can be raised with ground or buildings (for instance parking facilities) to improve the integration of the tunnel in the immediate area. A good early example of such a landtunnel is the A2 motorway tunnel at Leidsche Rijn, near the Dutch city of Utrecht&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van der Hoeven|first=Frank|title=Landtunnel Utrecht at Leidsche Rijn: The conceptualisation of the Dutch multifunctional tunnel|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tust.2010.03.005|journal=Tunnelling and Underground Space Technology|volume=25|issue=5|pages=508–517|doi=10.1016/j.tust.2010.03.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Temporary way ==

During construction of a tunnel it is often convenient to install a temporary railway, particularly to remove [[spoil tip|excavated spoil]], often [[narrow gauge]] so that it can be [[double track]] to allow the operation of empty and loaded trains at the same time. The temporary way is replaced by the [[permanent way]] at completion, thus explaining the term "Perway".

== Enlargement ==

[[File:Kolektory Praha, 15.jpg|thumb|A utility tunnel in [[Prague]]]]

The vehicles or traffic using a tunnel can outgrow it, requiring replacement or enlargement:
* The 1832 double-track mile-long tunnel from Edge Hill to Lime Street in Liverpool was near totally removed, apart from a 50-metre section at Edge Hill and a section nearer to Lime Street, as four tracks were required. The tunnel was dug out into a very deep four-track cutting, with short tunnels in places along the cutting. Train services were not interrupted as the work progressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i34.tinypic.com/23ixthy.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304114308/http://i34.tinypic.com/23ixthy.jpg |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i36.tinypic.com/16k1ahx.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304185533/http://i36.tinypic.com/16k1ahx.jpg |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are other occurrences of tunnels being replaced by open cuts, for example, the [[Auburn Tunnel]].
* The [[Farnworth Tunnel]] in England was enlarged using a [[tunnel boring machine]] (TBM) in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Railway Magazine]] August 2015, p12.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rhyndaston Tunnel]] was enlarged using a borrowed TBM so as to be able to take [[ISO container]]s.

== Open building pit ==

An open building pit consists of a horizontal and a vertical boundary that keeps groundwater and soil out of the pit. There are several potential alternatives and combinations for (horizontal and vertical) building pit boundaries. The most important difference with cut-and-cover is that the open building pit is muted after tunnel construction; no roof is placed.

== Other construction methods ==


* [[Drilling and blasting]]
* [[Hydraulic splitter]]
* Drum Cutters
* Slurry-shield machine
* Wall-cover construction method.

'''Wallwashing''' is a popular name for a [[lighting design|lighting design technique]] for illumination of large surfaces. It is mainly used with [[contemporary architecture]]; in public cultural buildings, museums and galleries; and in [[landscape lighting]]. 

Most of what one actually sees, entering a room, are the vertical surfaces. The illumination requires [[asymmetry|asymmetric]] lighting fixtures, which, in a number of 3 or more in a line, can produce evenly illuminated walls. It is a tool mainly used by [[lighting designer]]s, to create lighter spaces or making the rooms seem brighter or higher. The technique is similar to the "horizon" technique used in [[theatre lighting]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.alconlighting.com/blog/lighting-design/what-are-architectural-lighting-fixtures/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5485">'''Web-guiding systems''' are used in the [[Converters (industry)|converting industry]] to position flat materials, known as webs, before processing.  They are typically positioned just before a critical stage on a [[converting machine]].  Each type of web guiding system uses a sensor to monitor the [[web position]] for [[lateral tracking]], and each has an [[actuator]] to shift the running web mechanically back on course whenever the sensor detects movement away from the set path.  Actuators may be [[pneumatic]] or [[hydraulic]] cylinders, or some kind of [[electromechanical device]]. Because the web may be fragile — particularly at its edge — non-contact sensors are used.  These sensors may be pneumatic, [[photoelectric]], [[Ultrasonic sensor|ultrasonic]], or [[infrared]].  The system’s controls must put the output signals from the sensors in to a form that can drive the actuator.

Web guiding systems work at high speed, constantly making small adjustments to maintain the position of the material. The latest systems use digital technology and touch screen operator interfaces to simplify set up. Web guiding systems are used on [[Slitter|slitting machines]], slitter rewinders, [[Print press|printing]] presses, coating and laminating machines.

In 1939, Irwin Fife invented the first web guide in his Garage in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, solving a newspaper owner’s challenge of keeping paper aligned in his high-speed newspaper press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Fife | first = Irwin | title = Who We Are | url = http://www.maxcessintl.com/who-we-are }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Active Guiding Systems==
Active guiding systems are composed of a sensor, an actuator connected to a guide mechanism, and a controller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Web Guiding Systems: Why, What, Where and How? | url = https://www.r2r-tech.com/articles/web-guiding-systems-why-what-where-and-how}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sensor can be any detector, which can reliably pick up the edges of a web. The most common types of sensors are [[pneumatic]] (only works with nonporous webs), optical (works well with opaque webs), ultrasonic (works with most material), or paddies (thick webs). Recent developments have introduced to the industry a new sensor technology based on light scattering and spatial filtering that allows the use of an optical sensor to detect the edge of any material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.r2r-tech.com/articles/material-agnostic-fiber-optic-web-edge-sensor|title=Material Agnostic Fiber Optic Web Edge Sensor|date=2015-11-23|work=Roll-2-Roll Technologies LLC: Web Guides, Web Position Sensors and Web Guiding Systems|access-date=2017-07-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The web must be flat (free of curl) and stable (free of flutter) through the edge sensor. For this and other reasons, the sensor is often placed near a roller. If two sensors are used, the web could be guided to the front edge, back edge, or center. Common active guide systems include steering guide (remotely pivoted guide), displacement guide (offset-pivot guide), unwind guide, and rewind guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Roisum, Ph.D. | first = David | title = Web Guiding Systems | url = http://www.faustel.com/technical-library/web-guiding }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tension Adjustment Challenge==
Tension adjustment is necessary due to several mechanical factors: oscillations caused by mechanical misalignments, differing inertial response (lag) of mechanical elements during web acceleration, out-of-round unwind and tension rolls, slipping through nip rolls, and over-aggressive web-guide correction. Several technical process and control issues also affect tension: tension setpoint changes, phase offset on driven rolls, tension bleed from one zone to another, and thermal effect (contraction/expansion) as the substrate passes through various processes. It is impossible to eliminate all factors requiring tension adjustment. Variance in any one factor in a zone necessitates changes in tension control and web speed. Consequently, with coupled tension zone control, jitter is inevitable in a continuous web where the controllers cause a feedback loop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Rexroth | first = Bosch | title = Digital roll-to-roll web processing revolutionizes printed electronic production | url = http://www.controleng.com/single-article/digital-roll-to-roll-web-processing-revolutionizes-printed-electronic-production/02a51ad04ea2b0ee59db7dd2491d4c2f.html | date = 12 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Precise control of the system is essential. If the line speed of web is reduced, the amount of lateral displacement error that can be controlled by the steering guide system also decreases. If the input error decreases, the lateral displacement error also becomes smaller. Lateral displacement occurs on the transport web by the air blow from the dryer and the increase of blowing frequency can reduce the lateral displacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Shin | first = Hyeunhun | author-link = Hyeunhun Shin | last2 =  Ho | first2 =  Thanhtam | author2-link =  Thanhtam Ho | last3 =  Lee | first3 =  Sangyoon | author3-link =  Sangyoon Lee | title =  Steering guide-based lateral control for roll-to-roll printed electronics| url = http://www.j-mst.org/On_line/admin/files/69-P1-C-02-186_319-322_.pdf | journal =  Journal of Mechanical Science and Technology | volume = 24| issue =  1| pages =  319| year =  2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
