On course bookmakers and totalisators were also restricted to betting on a maximum of 104 days per annum.\n\nPower was given to local councils to issue (and revoke or refuse) the betting licences required and the 104 appointed days of trading must be published in advance. The racecourse and tracks were to charge on course bookmakers a specified admission price and it was illegal for under 18 to be involved in any betting organisation.\n\nThe issue of street bookmaking was not addressed which the press felt should have been. The restriction to 104 days was primarily brought in due to rapid growth of greyhound tracks after 1927 and the associated gambling implications that had followed.\n\nAll lotteries were made unlawful with the exemption of small lotteries incidental to certain entertainment and private lotteries. Restrictions were made on certain prize competitions (i.e. in newspapers) and warrant rights were given to any constable to investigate premises that are suspected of breaking the restrictions.\n\nThis was primarily directed to combat the Irish Free State Hospitals' Sweepstake.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "51041141", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51041141", "title": "All Lives Matter", "text": "All Lives Matter\n\n\"All Lives Matter\" (#AllLivesMatter) is a slogan that has come to be associated with criticism of the Black Lives Matter movement. The slogan became a larger talking point in the 2016 United States presidential election. \n\nSeveral notable individuals have supported All Lives Matter. Its proponents include Senator Tim Scott. American football player Richard Sherman supported the All Lives Matter message, saying \"I stand by what I said that All Lives Matter and that we are human beings.\" In June 2015, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton faced backlash after using the phrase \"all lives matter\" at an African-American church in Missouri during her presidential campaign.\n\nRepublicans have been stronger proponents in general of All Lives Matter and harsher critics of the Black Lives Matter movement in general. Senator Rand Paul has argued that Black Lives Matter has focused on the wrong targets and has stated, \"I think they should change their name maybe—if they were All Lives Matter, or Innocent Lives Matter.\" President Donald Trump has stated that \"Black Lives Matter\" is a divisive term and that the term is inherently racist.\n\nAccording to an August 2015 poll, 78% of likely American voters said that the statement All Lives Matter was \"close[r] to [their] own\" point of view than Black Lives Matter was. Only 11% said that the statement Black Lives Matter was closer. Nine percent said that neither statement reflected their own point of view.\n\nThe internet facilitates the spread of the message \"All Lives Matter\" as a response to the Black Lives Matter hashtag as well as the \"Blue Lives Matter\" hashtag as a response to Beyonce's halftime performance speaking out against police brutality.\n\nAt a performance during the 2016 MLB All-Star Game, Remigio Pereira, a member of The Tenors, held up an \"All Lives Matter\" sign and altered some lyrics to the anthem \"O Canada\". Pereira sang, \"We're all brothers and sisters. All lives matter to the great,\" instead of the lines, \"With glowing hearts we see thee rise, The True North strong and free.\" Even after criticism, he defended his statement, tweeting \"I speak for the human race and the lives of all sentient beings. Love, peace, and harmony for ALL has always been my life's purpose.\"\n\nSome supporters have used the phrase as a way to bring communities together, feeling that the phrase \"black lives matter\" is too narrow. Max Muncy, a professional baseball infielder for the Los Angeles Dodgers, tweeted the phrase in response to the 2016 shooting of Dallas police officers.  \n\nActivists from Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter made news when they embraced during a \"run-in\" in Dallas. \"We're all brothers and sisters,\" one of the protesters can be heard saying on CNN. \"This is how you kick down a wall.\"\n\nOn October 2, 2016, a fan at a Chicago Bears NFL game ran onto the field during a television timeout during the 4th quarter dressed in a gorilla costume, wearing a shirt that read \"All Lives Matter\" on the front.\n\nAccording to professor David Theo Goldberg, \"All Lives Matter\" reflects a view of \"racial dismissal, ignoring, and denial\". On \"Real Time with Bill Maher\", Bill Maher expressed support for use of the \"Black Lives Matter\" phrase, stating that \"'All Lives Matter' implies that all lives are equally at risk, and they're not\". Founders of the Black Lives Matter movement have responded to criticism of the movement's exclusivity, saying, \"#BlackLivesMatter doesn't mean your life isn't important – it means that Black lives, which are seen without value within White supremacy, are important to your liberation.\"\n\nIn a video interview with Laura Flanders, Black Lives Matter movement co-founder Alicia Garza said that \"changing Black Lives Matter to All Lives Matter is a demonstration of how we don't actually understand structural racism in this country\". She went on to say that other lives are valued more than black lives, and that to take blackness out of this equation is inappropriate.\n\nPresident Barack Obama spoke to the debate between Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter. Obama said, \"I think that the reason that the organizers used the phrase Black Lives Matter was not because they were suggesting that no one else's lives matter ... rather what they were suggesting was there is a specific problem that is happening in the African-American community that's not happening in other communities.\" He also said \"that is a legitimate issue that we've got to address.\"\nIn July 2016, \"USA Today\" concluded from the thoughts of Columbia University sociology professor Carla Shedd, that the phrase \"'All Lives Matter' can actually be interpreted as racist\". It also cited professor Joe Feagin, who said that white people use the phrase \"All Lives Matter\" to ignore the Black Lives Matter movement, which he described as \"already about liberty and justice for all.\" \"USA Today\" reported that some celebrities who had tweeted using the hashtag #AllLivesMatter, including Jennifer Lopez and Fetty Wap, had deleted the tweets and apologized. It also mentioned cartoonist Kris Straub, who tweeted a cartoon titled \"All Houses Matter\", showing a house fire, to illustrate what he saw as the problem with the term.\n\nRapper Fetty Wap apologized for using #AllLivesMatter, stating that he didn't fully understand the hashtag.\n\nOn February 24, 2016, Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, sent out a company-wide internal memo to employees formally rebuking employees who had crossed out handwritten \"Black Lives Matter\" phrases on the company walls and had written \"All Lives Matter\" in their place. Facebook allows employees to free-write thoughts and phrases on company walls. The memo was then leaked by several employees. As Zuckerberg had previously condemned this practice at previous company meetings, and other similar requests had been issued by other leaders at Facebook, Zuckerberg wrote in the memo that he would now consider this overwriting practice not only disrespectful, but \"malicious as well\". According to Zuckerberg's memo, \"\"Black Lives Matter\" doesn't mean other lives don't – it's simply asking that the black community also achieves the justice they deserve\". The memo also said that the act of crossing something out in itself, \"means silencing speech, or that one person's speech is more important than another's\".\n\n"}

Afterwards, the franchise became so popular that new animals such as cats, pigs, rabbits, ducks, hamsters, and birds were added to the collection. In 2003, 4Kids Entertainment bought the rights for this franchise outside of Asia.

Its subsidiaries include Atari Interactive and Atari, Inc. Because of continuing pressures upon the company, and difficulty finding investors, it sought bankruptcy protection under French law in January 2013; its subsidiaries in the United States have sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as well. All three subsidiaries have since exited bankruptcy, and are all going through a vigorous turnaround campaign.\n\nThe founders wanted to christen the company \"Zboub Système\" (which can be approximately translated to \"Dick System\" in English), but were dissuaded by their legal counsel. According to Bonnell in a TV interview, they then used a mix-and-match computer program to suggest other names, one of which was \"Infogramme\": a portmanteau of the French words \"informatique\" (information technology) and \"programme\" (a computer program). The final choice, \"Infogrames\", was a slightly modified version of that suggestion.\n\nThe company logo and mascot is an armadillo (\"tatou\" in French), chosen when the company was moved to Villeurbanne. Bonnell commented: \"This dinosaur is our symbol. The armadillo has always survived changes to its environment, from the melting of glaciers to the worst of heat waves.\"\n\nIn the late 1980s, Infogrames was noted for its French computer games that often featured original game ideas and occasionally humorous content. They had acquired several licences for popular Franco-Belgian comics\n\nIn 1992, they released \"Alone in the Dark\", a 3D horror adventure game to international attention.\n\nIn 1996, Bruno Bonnell's Infogrames embarked on an acquisition campaign that would last seven years and cost more than $500 million; the objective was to become the world's leading interactive entertainment publisher. While the company's debt increased from $55 million in 1999 to $493 million in 2002, the company's revenue also increased from $246 million to $650 million during the same period.\n\nIn April 1996, Infogrames announced they would buy and merge with British company Ocean International Ltd., the owners of Ocean Software and fellow-subsidiary Ocean America, for $100 million. After the merger, Ocean International Ltd. was renamed to Infogrames United Kingdom, Ltd., with Infogrames retaining the Ocean Software brand until 1998. With this merger, Infogrames Entertainment S.A. classified themselves as a \"Super Publisher\", referring to them being the largest in Europe. In 1997 Infogrames acquired Philips Multimedia BV, and transferred the multimedia software publishing and distribution activities from the company to them. The company also perchased game rights from German publisher Laguna Video Games in the same year.\n\nIn 1998, IESA acquired a majority share of 62.5% in the game distributor \"OziSoft\", and in 2002 IESA bought the remaining shares of \"OziSoft\" from Sega and other share holders, and renamed them to Infogrames Australia and Infogrames New Zealand. for $3.7 million. Also in 1998 the distributors ABS Multimedia, Arcadia and the Swiss Gamecity GmbH were acquired.\n\nIn 1999, IESA bought Gremlin Interactive, alongside DMA Design for $40 million, and renamed the developer to \"Infogrames Sheffield House\". Infogrames though would later sell off DMA Design to Take-Two Interactive in the same year. In the same year, IESA also bought Accolade for $60 million which was renamed as \"Infogrames North America, Inc.\" and Beam Software, which was renamed to \"Infogrames Melbourne House Pty Ltd\".\n\nThen in December 1999, IESA made one of the most expensive acquisitions in the company's history. Infogrames bought 70% of GT Interactive for $135 million, and assumed the new subsidiary's $75 million bank debt. By June 2000 Infogrames had invested another $30 million in GT Interactive. IESA justified the purchase by stating that GT Interactive provided Infogrames with a \"distribution network for all of its products in the United States, as well as a catalog of products that includes Driver, Duke Nukem, Oddworld, Unreal Tournament and Deer Hunter\".\n\nIncluded in the GT Interactive purchase were the game development studios SingleTrac, Humongous Entertainment, Legend Entertainment and Reflections Interactive.\n\nGT Interactive became Infogrames, Inc.\n\nIn 2000, the developer Paradigm Entertainment was bought for $19.5 million and in-flight games developer Den-o-Tech Int. (DTI) , later renamed to \"Infogrames DTI\", was also acquired for $5.6 million.\n\nIn the same year, Infogrames, Inc. acquired Infogrames North America, Inc. and both companies were merged into the former.\n\nIn January 2001, IESA purchased Hasbro Interactive and the handheld game console \"Game.com\" from Hasbro for $100 million; with $95 million as 4.5 million common shares of Infogrames and $5 million in cash.\n\nWith the acquisition of Hasbro Interactive, which was renamed as Infogrames Interactive, Inc, IESA became the owner of:\n\nAlso under the terms of the sale agreement, Infogrames gained the exclusive rights to develop and publish games based on Hasbro properties, which included \"Dungeons & Dragons\", \"Mr. Potato Head\", \"My Little Pony\" and others, for a period of 15 years plus an option for an additional 5 years based on performance.\n\nIn October 2001, Infogrames announced that it was \"reinventing\" the Atari brand (Which they acquired from Hasbro Interactive which they used as a brand for arcade game remakes) with the launch of three new games featuring prominent Atari branding on their boxarts: \"Splashdown\", \"MX Rider\" and \"TransWorld Surf\". The brand was a success for Infogrames, and they continued to use Atari as a brand name for console games aimed at 18-34 year olds. PC, educational and casual games retained the Infogrames banner.\n\nMicroProse's UK studio in Chipping Sodbury was closed on 20 September 2002. after the release of the last game under the MicroProse name, Grand Prix 4.\n\nIn the same year, IESA acquired the remaining 80% of game development studio Eden Games for $4.1 million. In May, Shiny Entertainment was bought from Interplay Entertainment for $47 million. With Eden Games, IESA would publish all of Eden Games' titles, such as \"V-Rally 3\" and later \"Test Drive Unlimited\", and with the Shiny Entertainment acquisition, IESA obtained the rights to develop and publish \"Enter the Matrix\" which was the first game based on \"The Matrix\" films and sold more than 5 million copies.\n\nIn the fiscal year of 2002, IESA had a net loss of $67 million on revenues of $650 million, and in 2003 the net losses increased to $89 million.\nIn 2006, IESA reported a net loss of $201 million on revenues of $525 million, and debts of around $290 million. From 1999 to 2006 IESA accumulated losses totaling €500 million.\n\nIn 2003, Infogrames closed down the Sheffield House development studio.\n\nOn 7 May 2003, IESA officially reorganized its Infogrames Inc. US subsidiary as a separate Nasdaq listed company known as Atari Inc., named its European operations as Atari Europe, renamed Infogrames Interactive, Inc. to Atari Interactive, Inc., (a wholly owned subsidiary of IESA), rebranded Infogrames Australia Pty Ltd as Atari Australia Pty Ltd, renamed Infogrames Melbourne House Pty Ltd to Atari Melbourne House Pty Ltd, Infogrames UK became Atari UK, while IESA became a holding company.\n\nAtari, Inc. is a public company that, as of 2007, had, as a majority stockholder, the company California U.S. Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of IESA. Atari Inc. licences the \"Atari\" trademark from Atari Interactive, a license which will expire in 2013. Atari, Inc. has the rights to publish and sublicense in North America certain intellectual properties either owned or licensed by IESA or its subsidiaries, including Atari Interactive.\n\nAtari's Australian subsidiary also distributes games for Konami of Europe, Codemasters UK, Eidos Interactive and SCi. Konami has an Australian headquarters but this is for Konami's Gaming Machines.\n\nIn 2003, Infogrames closed down the \"Atari Hunt Valley\" studio (The last MicroProse studio) and in January 2004, they closed down Legend Entertainment.\nIn 2004, Infogrames sold the \"Civilization\" franchise to Take-Two Interactive for $22.3 million Also that year Infogrames lost the rights to the Unreal franchise when the game's developer Epic Games signed a deal with Midway Games. In June 2005, Infogrames sold back to Hasbro the digital rights to most Hasbro properties including \"Transformers\" (except in Japan), \"My Little Pony\" and \"Connect Four\", but not \"Dungeons & Dragons\", for $65 million.\n\nIn May 2006, IESA sold the Games.com site to AOL. They also sold the Stuntman franchise to THQ and the publishing rights to Timeshift to Vivendi Games. The sales generated $13 million in revenue. THQ also bought the developer Paradigm Entertainment from IESA. In July 2006 IESA sold the game developer Reflections Interactive and the Driver franchise for $21.6 million to Ubisoft. In October, Shiny Entertainment was acquired by Foundation 9 Entertainment for $1.6 million. In November of the same year, Atari Melbourne House was sold to Krome Studios and renamed to Krome Studios Melbourne. After this the only developers still owned by Atari were Eden Games and Humongous, Inc.\n\nIn April 2007, Infogrames' founding chairman Bruno Bonnell left the company after 24 years; on the day of the announcement of his departure IESA's shares jumped 24%. After his resignation, Infogrames through the remainder of 2006 sold intellectual properties and some studios in order to raise cash and stave off the threat of bankruptcy.\n\nIn the same year, Infogrames fired the majority of Atari's directors and laid off 20% of its workforce. For the 2006–2007 fiscal year, Atari posted a net loss of $70 million.\n\nOn 6 March 2008, Infogrames made an offer to Atari Inc. to buy out all remaining public shares for a value of US$1.68 per share or US$11 million total. The offer would make Infogrames sole owner of Atari Inc., making it a privately held company.\n\nOn 30 April 2008, Atari Inc. announced its intentions to accept Infogrames' buyout offer and merge with Infogrames.\n\nOn 9 October 2008, Infogrames completed its takeover of Atari Inc. With that acquisition the Atari brand was re-united under Infogrames. Infogrames said that it planned to reduce administrative costs and to focus on online gaming.\n\nIn December 2008, Infogrames bought Cryptic Studios for $26.7 million in cash plus performance bonuses. Cryptic Studios is a massively multiplayer online game developer and its acquisition is in line with the company's new business strategy which focuses on online games.\n\nNamco Bandai and Infogrames formed a joint venture called Distribution Partners in September 2008. Distribution Partners was defined by Infogrames as a regrouping of \"Infogrames' distribution operations in Europe, Asia, Africa and South America.\" This new entity consisted mainly of Infograme's distribution network in the PAL region. Distribution Partners was 34% owned by Namco Bandai and 66% owned by Atari.\n\nIn May 2009, Namco Bandai acquired Atari Europe from Infogrames. Its sale and marketing personnel were transferred to Distribution Partners. In March 2009, Infogrames, announced that it was getting out of the distribution business in the PAL region with its decision to sell its 66% stake at Distribution Partners. According to an Infogrames press-release, this sale allowed \"Atari to focus its financial resources and creative energy exclusively on developing and publishing online-enabled games\".\n\nIn July, the deal valued at €37 million was completed; Distribution Partners was renamed to Namco Bandai Partners. At that time the company had operations in 50 countries and 17 dedicated offices.\n\nDespite restructuring, Infogrames continued to struggle to become profitable. For the 2008 fiscal year the company posted €51.1 million ($72.17 million) in net losses and for the 2009 fiscal year, which ended in March, Infogrames posted losses of €226.1 million ($319.33 million).\n\nDuring their fiscal year meeting (May 2009), IESA announced that it would be changing its corporate name to an Atari branded name, in line with the use of the name for its subsidiaries. In reference to this, Atari, Inc's CEO Jim Wilson said: \"We've gotten rid of the Infogrames and Atari duality, the confusion around that. We are one simplified company, under one management team, under one brand.\"\n\nInfogrames' 29 May earnings report stated:\n\nAn earnings press release on 24 July 2009 also provided clarification regarding the ensuing name change that was initially announced some two months prior, rebranding themselves as Atari, SA from Infogrames Entertainment, SA. Furthermore, this release also stated their intentions of henceforth utilizing the much more recognizable 'Atari Group' moniker with all Atari-related brands and similar such subsidiaries already under their control.\n\nOn 21 October 2010, Atari announced Atari's reference shareholders BlueBay Value Recovery (Master) Fund Limited and BlueBay Multi-Strategy (Master) Fund Limited are exploring a disposal of the shares and equity-linked instruments held by them. However, BlueBay shareholders later interrupted the sale process of its holding in Atari. BlueBay later converted the conversion of a portion of the ORANEs held by them.\n\nIn 2012, Atari, SA, BlueBay Value Recovery (Master) Fund Limited, and The BlueBay Multi-Strategy (Master)\nFund Limited reached an agreement following their negotiations regarding the restructuring of the debt and capital structure of the Atari group. As part of the agreement, the €20.9 million Credit Facility Agreement was extinguished via €10.9 million loan forgiveness from BlueBay Value Recovery (Master) Fund Limited and Atari's payment of €10 million; the cancellation of the dilutive effect of the ORANEs held by BlueBay; €20 million capital increases to be submitted to the vote of Atari shareholders (of which €10 million with preferential subscription right).\n\nOn 21 January 2013, Atari, Inc., Atari Interactive, Inc., Humongous, Inc. and California US Holdings, Inc. (collectively, the \"Companies\") filed petitions for relief under chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.\n\nIn July 2013, Atari began to sell its game assets, developers and the famous tripod logo and the Atari name in auction. The \"Battlezone\" and \"MoonBase Commander\" games were bought by Rebellion Developments. The \"Backyard Sports\" franchise was sold to Epic Gear LLC and later to Day 6 Sports Group LLC. Tommo bought Humongous Inc. and over 100 different games (Including games from the companies Accolade and MicroProse, and \"Math Grand Prix\"). \"Total Annihilation\" was sold to Wargaming and lastly, \"Star Control\" was bought by Stardock. Atari also had plans to sell off the \"Test Drive\" and \"RollerCoaster Tycoon\" franchises. Eden Games also closed down during the bankruptcy, but reopened up a year later as an independent developer by its founder, David Nadal.\n\nIn 2014, All 3 Ataris emerged from bankruptcy and entered the social casino gaming industry with Atari Casino. Frédéric Chesnais, who now heads all three companies, stated their entire operations consist of a staff of 10 people.\n\nIn December 2016, 3 years after the bankruptcy sale, Atari sold the \"Test Drive\" franchise to Bigben Interactive. The \"V-Rally\" series was also sold to Bigben Interactive around this time without a formal announcement.\n\nIn 2017, Piko Interactive acquired \"40 Winks\", \"Bubble Ghost\", \"\", \"Death Gate\", \"Drakkhen\", \"Eternam\", \"Glover\", \"Hostage: Rescue Mission\", \"Marco Polo\" and \"\" from Atari, SA.\n\nOn 19 September 2018, THQ Nordic announced they had acquired the \"Alone in the Dark\" franchise and \"\" from Atari, SA.\n\nIn 2015, Atari announced a turnaround strategy that would focus on re-releasing the catalog of Atari games. The strategy is focused on \"download games, MMO games, mobile games and licensing activities, based in priority around traditional franchises.\"\n\nProjects currently in production or included in the turnaround strategy include:\n\nOn 8 June 2017 a short teaser video was released, promoting a new product; and the following week CEO Fred Chesnais confirmed the company was developing a new games console - the hardware was stated to be based on PC technology, and be still under development. In mid July 2017 an Atari press release confirmed the existence of new hardware, referred to as the \"Ataribox\". The box design was derived from early Atari designs (e.g. 2600) with a ribbed top surface, and a rise at the back of the console; two versions were announced one with a traditional wood veneer front, and another with a glass front. Connectivity options were give as including hdmi, USB (x4), and SD card - the console was said to support both classic and current games. According to an official company statement of 22 June 2017 the product was to initially launched via a crowdfunding campaign in order to minimise financial risk to the parent company. In March 2018 the Ataribox was renamed the Atari VCS.\n\n\nAs of 2018, Atari, SA own the rights to the following games and game franchises. The majority of these are original works by Atari, Hasbro Interactive or Infogrames, however the most notable outside of these are a large number of intellectual properties formerly belonging to Ocean Software, which Atari never lost the rights.\n"}

On processing a successful complaint from \"government officials, companies or another outside party\" about an illegal \"tweet\", the social networking site will notify users from that country that they may not see it. In other cases the authorities may take unilateral action to block the site.\n\nAccess to Twitter is currently blocked in North Korea, China, Iran and Turkmenistan.\n\nAccording to the Terms of Service agreed upon by users of Twitter, the web site may suspend accounts, temporarily or permanently, from their social networking service. One such example is on 18 December 2017 where it banned the accounts belonging to Paul Golding, Jayda Fransen, Britain First, Traditionalist Worker Party.\n\nIn 2018, Twitter rolled out a Quality Filter, nicknamed QFD. It hides content and users deemed \"low quality\" from search results, and limits their visibility, leading to accusations of \"shadow banning\". After conservatives claimed it censors users from the political right, Alex Thomson, a VICE writer, confirmed that many prominent Republican politicians had been \"shadow banned\" by the Quality Filter. He later reported that Twitter announced that they would issue a \"fix\" in the near future.\n\nTwitter is blocked in China; however, many Chinese people use it anyway. In 2010 Cheng Jianping was sentenced to 1 year in a labor camp for \"retweeting\" a comment that suggested boycotters of Japanese products should instead attack the Japanese pavilion at the 2010 Shanghai Expo. Her fiancé, who posted the initial comment, claims it was actually a satire of anti-Japanese sentiment in China.\n\nTwitter was inaccessible in Egypt on 25 January 2011 during the 2011 Egyptian protests. Some news reports blamed the government of Egypt for blocking it, and Vodafone Egypt, Egypt's largest mobile network operator, said it wasn't their action; however, Twitter's news releases did not state who the company believes instituted the block. As of January 26, Twitter was still confirming that the service was blocked in Egypt. On January 27, various reports claimed that access to the entire Internet from within Egypt had been shut down.\n\nShortly after the Internet shutdown, engineers at Google, Twitter, and SayNow, a voice-messaging startup company acquired by Google in January, announced the Speak To Tweet service. Google stated in its official blog that the goal of the service was to assist Egyptian protesters in staying connected during the Internet shutdown. Users could phone in a \"tweet\" by leaving a voicemail and use the Twitter hashtag #Egypt. These comments could be accessed without an Internet connection by dialing the same designated phone numbers. Those with Internet access could listen to the comments by visiting twitter.com/speak2tweet.\n\nOn February 2 connectivity was re-established by the four main Egyptian service providers. A week later, the heavy filtering that occurred at the height of the revolution had ended.\n\nFollowing the posting of an antisemitic and racists posts by anonymous users, Twitter removed those posts from its service. Lawsuits were filed by the Union of Jewish Students (UEJF), a French advocacy group and, on 24 January 2013, Judge Anne-Marie Sauteraud ordered Twitter to divulge the personally identifiable information about the user who posted the antisemitic post, charging that the posts violated French laws against hate speech. Twitter responded by saying that it was \"reviewing its options\" regarding the French charges. Twitter was given two weeks to comply with the court order before daily fines of €1,000 (about US$1,300) would be assessed. Issues over jurisdiction arise, because Twitter has no offices nor employees within France, so it is unclear how a French court could sanction Twitter.\n\nTwitter accounts spoofing the Prime Minister of India such as PM0India, Indian-pm and PMOIndiaa were blocked in India in August 2012 following violence in Assam.\n\nIn 2009, during 2009 Iranian presidential election, the Iranian government blocked Twitter due to fear of protests being organised. In September 2013, the blocking of both Twitter and Facebook was briefly lifted without notice due to a technical error, however, within a day the sites were blocked again.\n\nIn 2016, access to comments by the American blogger Richard Silverstein about a criminal investigation, which involved a minor and therefore was under a gag order according to Israeli law, was blocked to Israeli IP addresses, following a request by Israel's Ministry of Justice.\n\nFrom April 2016, North Korea started to block Twitter, \"in a move underscoring its concern with the spread of online information\". Anyone trying to access it, such as foreign visitors, even with special permission from the North Korean government, will be subject to punishment.\n\nAs of May 2014, Twitter regularly disables the ability to view specific \"tweets\" inside Pakistan, at the request of the government of Pakistan on the grounds that they are blasphemous, having done so five times in that month.\n\nOn 25 November 2017, the NetBlocks internet shutdown observatory and Digital Rights Foundation collected evidence of nation-wide blocking of Twitter alongside other social media services, imposed by the government in response to the violent Tehreek-e-Labaik protests. The technical investigation found that all major Pakistani fixed-line and mobile service providers were affected by the restrictions, which were lifted by the PTA the next day when protests abated following the resignation of Minister for Law and Justice Zahid Hamid.\n\nOn 19 May 2014, Twitter blocked a pro-Ukrainian political account for Russian users. It happened soon after, a Russian official had threatened to ban Twitter entirely if it refused to delete \"tweets\" that violated Russian law, according to the Russian news site Izvestia.\n\nOn 27 July 2014, Twitter blocked an account belonging to a hacker collective that has leaked several internal Kremlin documents to the Internet.\n\nIn August 2010, the Government of South Korea tried to block certain content on Twitter due to the North Korean government opening a Twitter account. The North Korean Twitter account created on August 12, uriminzok, loosely translated to mean \"our people\" in Korean, acquired over 4,500 followers in less than one week. On August 19, 2010, South Korea's state-run Communications Standards Commission banned the Twitter account for broadcasting \"illegal information.\" According to BBC US and Canada, experts claim that North Korea has invested in \"information technology for more than 20 years\" with knowledge of how to use social networking sites. This appears to be \"nothing new\" for North Korea as the reclusive country has always published propaganda in its press, usually against South Korea, calling them \"warmongers.\" With only 36 \"tweets\", the Twitter account was able to accumulate almost 9,000 followers. To date, the South Korean Commission has banned 65 sites, including this Twitter account.\n\nOn 21 March 2014, access to Twitter was blocked when a court ordered that \"protection measures\" be applied to the service. This followed earlier remarks by Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan who vowed to \"wipe out Twitter\" following damaging allegations of corruption in his inner circle. However, on 27 March 2014, Istanbul Anatolia 18th Criminal Court of Peace suspended the above-mentioned court order. Turkey's constitutional court later ruled that the ban is illegal. Two weeks after the Turkish government blocked the site, the Twitter ban was lifted. \nOn Sunday April 20, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, FAZ, reported Twitter had blocked two regime hostile accounts in Turkey, @Bascalan and @Haramzadeler333, both known for pointing out corruption. In fact, on 26 March 2014, Twitter announced that it started to use its Country Withheld Content tool for the first time in Turkey. As of June 2014, Twitter was withholding 14 accounts and \"hundreds of tweets\" in Turkey. \nBetween 2014 and 2017, the social networking site reported that Turkey requested more than 52 percent of removal requests worldwide. Also, Turkey has submitted the highest volume of removal requests to Twitter on 2014, 2015 and 2016.\n\nIn February 2015 three sisters from Abu Dhabi disappeared after being arrested by the Emirati authorities for tweeting \"I miss my brother\". The three sisters are thought to have had no access to legal representation or their family.\n\nThen-Prime Minister David Cameron threatened to shut down Twitter among other social networking sites for the duration of the 2011 England riots, but no action was taken.\n\nTwitter images were temporarily blocked in Venezuela in February 2014 along with other sites used to shares images including Pastebin.com as well as Zello, a walkie-talkie app. In response to the block, Twitter offered Venezuelan users a workaround to use their accounts via text message on their mobile phones.\n\n"}

However, there are two factors which result in color display even during monochrome transmission:\n\nWhen the frequencies of these signals equals the frequency of the color subcarrier wave, they may create an irritating color dot pattern like \"confetti\", which interferes with the monochrome picture.\n\nIn a color TV waveform, a reference pulse, called the burst, is transmitted along the back porch portion of the video signal. If the transmitted signal is monochromatic, then the burst is not transmitted. The color killer is actually a muting circuit in the chroma section which supervises the burst and turns off the color amplifiers if no burst is received (i.e. when the received signal is monochromatic.)\n\nIn NTSC and PAL transmissions, the color TV signal can be represented as:\n\nIn this equation formula_2 and formula_3 are attenuation factors, formula_4 is the luminance signal, formula_5 and formula_6 are the so-called color difference signals and formula_7 is the angular frequency of the color carrier. formula_7 is within the luminance bandwidth.\n\nIn the '70s, the Israeli government considered the import of color televisions as frivolous and a luxury that would increase social gaps. Therefore, the government ordered the Israel Broadcasting Authority to cease broadcasting in color. As it was impractical to strip out the chrominance signal from material recorded in color, this was accomplished by simply omitting the burst phase signal from the broadcast. The \"damaged\" signal triggered the \"color killer\" mechanism, installed in color TV sets to prevent the appearance of color. This method was named \"Mehikon\" ( \"eraser\").\n\nSoon after its introduction of the \"Color eraser\", special TV sets with an \"Anti-Mehikon\" ( \"anti-eraser\") device were offered. This device re-constructed the burst phase signal according to several known standards. The client had to turn a knob until the pictures on the screen appeared in natural colors. According to a report in \"Yediot Aharonoth\" from January 1979, clients had to adjust the knob every 15 minutes on average in normal conditions, or up to 10 times an hour when special problems occurred, in order to restore natural colors or if the picture suddenly turned black and white.\n\nBased on information from owners of electricity appliance stores, the report estimated that 90% of those who bought color TV sets also bought the \"Anti-Mehikon\" device, which added about 5–10% to the price of the television.\n\nEventually, the Mehikon idea was proven to be futile, and the Israeli television stopped using it in 1980, allowing color transmissions to be received freely.\n"}

With the Red Falcon alien threat defeated and Alien Wars finished, the Earth is peaceful once again. However, a similar alien entity calling itself Black Viper begins launching attacks against the human race, causing mass destruction over the planet. After strange readings are detected at the Galuga archipelago (the setting of the original \"Contra\"), the Earth Federation sends their four strongest Contra Force commandos on a final strike mission to destroy the Black Viper and its army of aliens, robots, and mutants.\n\nThe continuity of \"Contra 4\" is based on the Japanese canon that was adapted into the English localization of series with the release of \"Contra: Shattered Soldier\". However, the game's producers took a number of liberties with the established canon by integrating elements of the American localizations of the older games, thus fusing the two versions together. The alien Black Viper was originally mentioned only in the North American manual of \"Operation C\", whereas the original plot of that game (released as simply \"Contra\" in Japan) was about an unnamed superpower creating new weapons using an alien cell. In the timeline presented in the manual and official website, the events of \"Operation C\" are interpreted as a previous mission of \"Mad Dog\" and \"Scorpion\" - two new characters created specifically for \"Contra 4\", against the Black Viper. In actuality, \"Mad Dog\" and \"Scorpion\" were the names used for Bill and Lance for the North American NES games (see playable characters section for details). Additionally, \"Operation C\" was originally a solo mission of Lance Bean, aka Scorpion (as the game was one-player only).\n\n\"Contra 4\" is based on the same 2D gameplay system featured in the series through \"\", ignoring many of the game mechanics introduced in later games such as the fixed weapon configurations in \"\" and \"Neo Contra\", returning to the old method of picking up power-up icons to obtain new weapons. The play controls are similar to \"Contra III: The Alien Wars\", including the ability to hold two weapons in inventory. The action spans both screens of the Nintendo DS system and a grappling hook can be used by the player's character to latch onto railings, allowing the player's character to move from one screen to the other. Similarly to the arcade version of \"Super Contra\", the player can pick up the same power-up twice, giving them an improved version of the same weapon. The player can also discard a power-up, allowing them to try out a new weapon without losing a previous one.\n\nIn addition to the standard side view stages, there are also tunnel stages similar to the two \"3D view\" stages from the original \"Contra\", in which the perspective shifts behind the character's back. The action in these stages is displayed solely on the upper screen, while the bottom screen is used to display the stage's map and the locations of power-ups. Other than using both screens, \"Contra 4\" makes no usage of the DS' special features such as touch screen (besides navigating the main menu), microphone, or multiplayer modes.\n\nArcade Mode is the main portion of the game, which is composed of six standard stages and three tunnel stages, for a total of nine stages. The stages pay frequent homage to \"Contra\", \"Super Contra\" (\"Super C\" on the NES), \"Operation C\" and \"Contra III: The Alien Wars\". Three difficulty settings are available: easy, normal, and hard. Easy is intended to be accessible to novices by providing the player with plenty of lives and credits, as well as making all power-ups upgraded by default, but does not give the player access to the final two stages nor the ending. Normal is a moderate setting described to be \"as difficult as the original \"Contra\"\", whereas Hard features faster moving enemies and enemy fire, with fewer lives. Hard mode also features a different ending from Normal.\n\nAfter completing the main game (Arcade Mode) once on any difficulty setting, a Challenge Mode will be made available in the main menu. This game mode is composed of forty different challenges in which the player must complete various tasks within the side-scrolling stages of Arcade Mode.\n\nThe music and sound effects were handled by famed videogame music remixer Jake Kaufman, who also composed for \"Shantae\" and founded the game music remix site VGMix. The soundtrack consists of a few arrangements of music from previous \"Contra\" games as well as new material. When Arcade Mode is played on the Hard setting, an arranged version of the Jungle theme from the original \"Contra\" is played instead of the standard stage music. The standard Jungle theme is actually an enhanced version of a \"Contra style\" chiptune song previously posted on Kaufman's website, called \"Vile Red Falcon.\"\n\nA soundtrack CD has been announced by Konami to be bundled in the first print of the Japanese release of Contra: Dual Spirits, as a gift for preorders through the KonamiStyle shop. This deal is only available for Japanese residents. In addition to the music found in the game, a 4-minute live performance of the \"Harbor\" song is included as a bonus track. The song is performed by The Smash Bros, Jake Kaufman's video game tribute band.\n\n\"Contra 4\" received positive reviews from critics, scoring an 83 out of 100 on Metacritic. \"Contra 4\" has been hailed as a rebirth of the \"Contra\" franchise, returning the gameplay to the classic roots of the series. It has garnered multiple awards including IGN's \"Best Action Game\" and \"Best Revival\" of 2007, and GameSpy's 7th best DS game of 2007. \"GamesRadar+\" named \"Contra 4\" the 22nd best DS game of all time out of a list of 25.\n\n"}

He notes with pride that his patrons will not find such gimmicks in his plays.\nThe dance can be compared with the modern \"Tsifteteli\".\n\nPetronius Arbiter in his Roman novel the \"Satyricon\" has Trimalchio boast to his dinner guests that no one dances the cordax better than his wife, Fortunata. The nature of this dance is described in the satires of Juvenal, who says \"the girls encouraged by applause sink to the ground with tremulous buttocks.\" The poet Horace and playwright Plautus refer to the same dance as \"iconici motus\".\n\nJuvenal makes specific mention of the \"testarum crepitus\" (clicking of castanets).

For example, a dramatic convention in Shakespeare is that a character can move downstage to deliver a soliloquy which cannot be heard by the other characters on stage nor are characters in a musical surprised by another character bursting into song. One more example would be how the audience accepts the passage of time during a play or how music will play during a romantic scene.\n\nDramatic conventions may be categorized into groups, such as rehearsal, technical or theatrical.\nRehearsal conventions can include hot seating, role on the wall and still images. Technical conventions can include lighting, dialogue, monologue, set, costuming and entrances/exits.

El Mokhtar was of Egyptian Arabian bloodlines, rarely shown, and originally not even broke to ride because he was considered so valuable. The American Arabian enthusiast knew him from a few ads in magazines, but no super-hype promotion surrounded his breeding career.\n\nShortly after his arrival in America, El Mokhtar was seen by \"The Black Stallion\" author Walter Farley. An offer was made for El Mokhtar's services for the role of 'The Black' for the first \"Black Stallion\" film, but it was firmly declined by his syndicate. \"Black Stallion\" trainer Corky Randall also liked El Mokhtar, and, at Randall's urging, the movie studio bought out the entire 40-member syndicate in order to secure El Mokhtar for the second \"Black Stallion\" film. \n\nEl Mokhtar was one of three black Arabian stallions used to portray the Black in the second film. The director loved his huge, expressive eyes, so he appears in several close-up shots. More important to the film was how El Mokhtar could run; he is the Black in the cross-country race. The native extras riding the other horses were urged to make a real race of it. The 'come from behind' win of 'The Black' is the product of a real race. \n\nEl Mokhtar was also trained to do the 'courting' scenes with the gray gelding Talishma, who played the mare Johar in the film. Those scenes were scheduled as the last to be shot. Just prior to the filming date, El Mokhtar developed a severe case of horse colic. No modern veterinary facility was available in Morocco, making surgery impossible, and as a result, El Mokhtar was humanely destroyed on the set December 31, 1983. An autopsy revealed a severe twist, and a rupture; even if surgery had been possible, it is very unlikely he would have survived. \n\nEl Mokhtar was unusually tall for a purebred Arabian, and very 'Egyptian' in type with a long, clean-cut neck, small head, and fine boned for his size. El Mokhtar was not only a good athlete - the work in the Black Stallion film was strenuous and demanding - but he also had a very good nature and was a willing performer. Corky Randall said, \"He just never did anything wrong.\"\n"}

It was created and hosted by Víctor Saume.\n\n\"El Show de las Doce\" was the first daytime television show in the history of Venezuelan television. For many years, channels 5 (Televisora Nacional) and channel 4 (Televisa) only began in the evenings. Produced by Corpa Publicidad, sponsored by Lucky Strike Cigarettes (later by Añejo Santa Teresa, a brand of rum), and hosted exclusively by Víctor Saume, this program began in mid-1954 and was shown between 12:00 noon and 1:30pm, Mondays and Saturdays. It was live, with an audience in the studio. The show was usually made in studio 9, which was used for shows with big audiences, though occasionally it would be produced in studio 15, located in the current Miniteatro del Este de Plaza Venezuela. It was one of the few shows in Venezuela that managed to maintain its original set design throughout its run.\n\nAlthough Saume was the central figure of this show, other hosts assiste on occasions. It was even hosted by José Luis Sarzalejo for a period of five years. The show was also hosted by Héctor Monteverde, Félix Cardona Moreno, Charles Barry, and Luis Brito Arocha. When it came time to announce the commercial break, Saume came up with the catch phrase \"Vamos arriba\" (\"going up\"). Renny Ottolina, considered Saume's successor by some people, perfected the catch phrase by including the word \"master\" (\"Vamos a master\" or \"lets go to the master\"). \"El Show de las Doce\" brought to its audience international superstars such as Pedro Infante, Libertad Lamarque, Olga Guillot, Celia Cruz and La Sonora Matancera, La Tongolele, Miguel Aceves Mejía and Lola Flores. Venezuelan artists who appeared on the show included Alfredo Sadel, Héctor Cabrera, Los Torrealberos, Magdalena Sánchez, Rosa Virginia Chacín, Cherry Navarro, and Chelique Sarabia. One of the show's segments, \"La gran cruzada del buen humor\", later gave birth to \"Radio Rochela Televisión\" (the original name of this comedy show). This segment could be seen on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, for 15 minutes.\n\n\"In little time, it was converted in the most popular program in television. Those who came from other places in the country went directly to Uncle Saume, because somebody recommended to go to him. It was frequent the visits from those who wanted to know something publicly.\" (Edith Guzmán, \"El Nacional\", September 29, 1974, ten years after the death of Saume).\n\nIn 1960, the program became known simply as \"El Show de Saume\". At the beginning of 1964, it was dfound that Saume had some respiratory problems, and the show ended on March 15, 1964, eight months before his death.\n\n\n"}

A total of 22 unions belonging to different trades in the film and television industry are affiliated to the FEFSI that has around 25,000 members.\n\nIn June 1997, some members of the FEFSI resorted to a flash strike during the shooting of the film \"Raman Abdullah\", directed by Balu Mahendra, protesting against the director engaging \"outsiders\". This led into a major crisis when FEFSI launched an indefinite strike, affecting other film units as well. The state government's intervened and FEFSI called off the strike after a week. However, the producers hardened their stand and insisted that they would not engage any technician or worker associated with FEFSI. They complained that the rising wages of technical staff and artistes were contributing towards the box office run of Tamil films in 1997. They demanded that workers and technicians form new organisations exclusively for the production of Tamil films, on the lines of organisations in Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. The issue escalated when the organisation's leader Vijayan declined to budge from his demands and was able failed to gather support from a series of prominent actors and film director Bharathiraja. vijayan also became the key person for the strike which led to suicide of some members and some lost their asserts due to this strike.\n\nFilms delayed included \"Marudhanayagam\", \"Jeans\", \"Sethu\" and \"Kadhal Rojave\". Producer K. T. Kunjumon said his losses amounted to 3 lakhs after a large set he had erected for his film \"Ratchagan\" (a replica of the massive Rajaji Hall) was destroyed in the rain. Several new Cielo cars parked near the set were also damaged, resulting in a loss of another 7 lakhs, he claimed. The strike lasted for over six months, delaying the production of several films before easing. In June 1998, FEFSI and the Tamil Film Producers Association (TFPA) merged and formed a new organisation called the Tamil Nadu Film Producers and Employees Federation. An agreement to this effect was signed by the representatives of the two organisations in the presence of then Chief Minister Muthuvel Karunanidhi.\n\nTalks between FEFSI and the Tamil Film Producers Council (TFPC) over wages and working hours became a heated matter in early 2011 and FEFSI members wanted the issue regarding increase in salary to be sorted out immediately, calling for a strike in June 2011.\n\nAn unofficial two-week strike was held in early February 2012, with nearly 5000 members of FEFSI engaging on a day-long hunger strike at Isai Kalaignargal Sangam in Vadapalani, demanding that the Tamil Film Producers Council (TFPC) implement the revised wages for its members. The strike was made official briefly in April 2012 but did not disrupt any big-budget film productions, and soon the problems were eased out after the intervention of the State's Labour Minister S. T. Chellapandian.\n\nA clash broke out when the drivers' union learnt that one of the camera crews supposedly hired a private agency for their logistics, instead of approaching the assigned drivers and this was contrary to union expectations. After brief disturbances in May 2013, FEFSI announced a decision to boycott all vehicles of the drivers’ union. In June 2013, FEFSI announced that they would go an indefinite strike after it was alleged that members of the drivers union had assaulted members of the technicians union at Nerkundram Paadhai on Monday, when they were loading food into an autorickshaw for a film shoot. Two days later the strike was cancelled and film shootings resumed.\n\nAs a fallout of the strike, the Tamil Nadu Chinna Thirai Producers Council president Raadhika announced that the council had decided to break away from FEFSI.\n\nleaders\n\n"}

She is best known as Clark Gable's patron, acting coach and first wife.\n\nBorn in Denver, Colorado, Dillon was one of six children of Judge Henry Clay Dillon. She was the younger sister of opera singer Enrica Clay Dillon. Dillon's father became a district attorney in Los Angeles while her mother was a prominent socialite. Dillon was educated in the California public school system and in Europe. She later studied acting at Stanford University.\n\nAfter graduating from Stanford in 1908, Dillon studied acting in Italy for one year before returning to the United States to act on Broadway for actor Edward Everett Horton's stock company in New York City. Dillon eventually decided to give up her career to teach acting. She relocated to Portland, Oregon where she opened \"the Little Theatre\", an acting school attended by wealthy area students.\n\nIt was at the Little Theatre that Dillon met a then unknown aspiring actor 17-years her junior named W. C. Gable, while she was working as a stage director for the Red Lantern Players. Initially, she was Gable's acting coach but the two began a romantic relationship after Dillon took a special interest in Gable. Dillon became his patron, paying to have his teeth fixed and hair styled. She guided him in building up his chronically undernourished body, and taught him better body control and posture. She spent considerable time training his naturally high-pitched voice, which Gable slowly managed to lower, and to gain better resonance and tone. As his speech habits improved, Gable's facial expressions became more natural and convincing. After the long period of rigorous training, Dillon eventually considered him ready to attempt a film career in Los Angeles.\n\nDillon moved to Los Angeles in the summer of 1924 where she opened The Dillon Stock Company. Five months later, Gable joined her. They were married shortly thereafter on December 18, 1924. On the marriage license, Gable claimed he was 24 years old while Dillon claimed she was 34. Dillon continued to work with Gable on his acting and voice while he went to auditions. During this time, Gable followed Dillon's advice to use his middle name, \"Clark\", as his professional name. Over the next few years, Clark Gable's career gained momentum with stage and minor film roles. After appearing in the play \"Machinal\" in 1929 and shortly before he was signed with M-G-M, Gable asked Dillon for a divorce. Dillon later recalled that he had asked for a divorce several times before but she refused as she did not believe he meant it. She filed for legal separation on March 28, 1929. Their divorce became final on April 1, 1930. Two days later, Gable married wealthy socialite Maria Franklin Prentiss Lucas Langham, nicknamed \"Rhea\".\n\nIn 1940, Dillon began teaching acting at Christian College (now known as Columbia College) in Columbia, Missouri. That same year, she wrote \"Modern Acting\". The book describes in detail the training that she put Gable through over a six and a half year period. Upon returning to California, Dillon continued teaching acting. Her students included Bruce Cabot, Gary Cooper, Donna Reed, Rita Hayworth and Linda Darnell. In 1944, she made her only two film appearances in bit roles in \"The Lady and the Monster\" and \"Men on Her Mind\".\n\nIn the years following their divorce, Clark Gable became one of the most popular leading men of the era and would win an Academy Award in 1934. He also went on to marry four more times. Gable rarely spoke publicly about his marriage to Dillon. In a statement issued by M-G-M in 1932, Gable denied rumors that he had married Dillon solely to further his career. He claimed he was motivated only by love and added that he \"owed [Dillon] a debt of gratitude\" for guiding his early career. Dillon, who never remarried, refused to speak disparagingly about her famous ex-husband. She would only say the two were married \"in name only\", implying the marriage was not consummated. Dillon's cousin later said that Dillon \"carried a torch up to her dying day for [Gable]. That was her one and only real love.\"\n\nThroughout the 1950s and early 60s, Dillon continued to teach acting and lived in a small home in the San Fernando Valley. In July 1956, \"Confidential\" magazine published a story claiming that Dillon was \"down and out\" and that Clark Gable refused to help her. Dillon denied the story was true and later testified against the editors of the magazine in a libel trial in August 1957. After the trial, Dillon lost many of her acting students due to the publicity. She nearly lost her home and later revealed that Gable had sent her money to avoid foreclosure. After Gable's death in November 1960, the press reported that his will stipulated that the remainder of Dillon's mortgage be paid in full by his estate.\n\nDillon continued working as an acting teacher until poor health forced her to retire in the mid-1960s. In the years following Gable's death, several biographies of the actor were published that mentioned his marriage to Dillon. She later reported that she regularly received abusive and insulting letters and telephone calls from Gable fans despite the fact that she never publicly disparaged him.\n\nOn November 11, 1971, she died after a \"lengthy illness\" at a sanatorium in Glendale, California. She is interred at Calvary Cemetery in East Los Angeles.\n\n\n\n"}

The phrase comes from the French for \"Red Lantern\" and refers to the red lantern hung on the rear vehicle of a passenger railway train or the brake van of a freight train, which signalmen would look for in order to make sure none of the couplings had become disconnected.\n\nIn the Tour de France the rider who finishes last, rather than dropping out along the way, is accorded the distinction of lanterne rouge. Because of the popularity it affords, riders may compete for the last position rather than settling for a place near the back. Often the rider who comes last is remembered while those a few places ahead are forgotten. The revenue the last rider will generate from later appearance fees can be greater than if he had finished second to last, although this was more true when riders still made much of their income from post-Tour criteriums.\n\nIn the 1979 Tour de France, Gerhard Schönbacher and Philippe Tesnière were on the last two spots in the general classification, less than one minute apart. Tesnière had already finished last in the 1978 Tour, so he was aware of the publicity associated with being the lanterne rouge.\nIn the 21st stage, a time trial, Tesnière therefore rode slowly. The winner of the time trial, Bernard Hinault, took 1 hour, 8 minutes and 53 seconds to cover the 48.8 km, Schönbacher used 1 hour, 21 minutes and 52 seconds, while Tesniere rode it in 1 hour, 23 minutes and 32 seconds; both were slower than all other cyclists. Tesnière's time was more than 20% slower than Hinault's, which meant that he had missed the time cut, and was taken out of the race.\n\nThe Tour organisation did not like the attention that the lanterne rouge received, and for the 1980 Tour devised a rule to make it more difficult to finish last: between the 14th and the 20th stage, the rider last in the general classification was removed from the race. Still, Schönbacher managed to finish last in that race. Before the Tour, Schönbacher was promised by his sponsor that he would receive extra money if he finished in last place. After the last stage of the Tour, his team leader Patrick Lefevre told Schönbacher that he would not get the money, and after a heated discussion, Schönbacher was fired.\n\n"}

She is a professor at the St Petersburg State Conservatoire named after N. Rimsky-Korsakov (1987), and the Chief Researcher at the Russian Institute of Fine Arts History in St Petersburg. She is considered an Honoured Art Worker of Russian Federation.\n\nShe graduated in 1965 from two departments at the Leningrad State Conservatoire named after N. Rimsky-Korsakov: the department of History of Music and Piano Performing Faculty, and the department of Organ Playing, having studied under Prof Isai Braudo. It was at the Conservatoire that she finished a postgraduate course in the department of History of Western Music, under the supervision of Prof Dr Mikhail Druskin. In 1970 Liudmila Kovnatskaya presented a candidate dissertation on Benjamin Britten’s oeuvre. In 1987 she completed a doctoral dissertation on English music of 20th century, at the Moscow research institute of Arts of Academy of Science, USSR.\n\nSince 1987 Prof Kovnatskaya is a member of Russian Composers’ Union, and she was a member of the General Council for Cultural Affairs of St Petersburg from 1987 until 1993. In 2002 she became a member of the Council (Directorium) of the IMS. In the same year, she became a member of the editorial board of the journal “Tempo” (Cambridge).\n\nIn 2001 Prof Kovnatskaya became a materials consultant on Russian music for \"The Grove’s Dictionary of Music and Musicians\" (London: McMillan, 2001). She was also a guest lecturer at the University of Manchester (1991), the Aldeburgh Festival (UK), and the Ural Conservatoire in Yekaterinburg.\n\nLiudmila Kovnatskaya is the author of a monograph about Benjamin Britten (Moscow, 1974), in the book “English Music in the 20th Century: Sources and periods of development” (Moscow, 1986). Thanks to her research and organization activity in Russia, various festivals and concerts were organized, which were dedicated to English classic music, including Britten. Among them were “Ars Britannica” (1988–1990), the festival in honour of “The 80th anniversary of B. Britten” (1993), “The World of Ralph Vaughan Williams” (1996), the festival of Britten’s music on his 85th anniversary (1998), the jubilee concert in honour of Britten and Saint Cecilia, patron saint of musicians (2003), the concert “World of Opera: Benjamin Britten”, and others.\n\nProf Kovnatskaya’s research fields include History of Russian Music; she has written, edited and compiled books and articles on D. Shostakovich. Among her non-published manuscripts one can find a monumental work entitled “Ideological control of Musical avant-garde of 1920s: Leningrad Association of Contemporary Music in reports and other materials” (Soros Foundation Funding).\n\nShostakovich, Schoenberg, Britten, Purcell, Tippet, Arensky, Balakirev, English music, Russian-English connections, M. S. Druskin, A. Schweitzer and the Soviet musical epoch – all these subjects were established by Prof Kovnatskaya due to her intensive and rigorous nature as a researcher, editor and author of books, proceedings, collections and many-volume editions.\n\nA separate field of her research and publishing activity is the ‘offering to the Teacher’, who was a famous musicologist and Professor of Leningrad Conservatoire Mikhail Druskin. In 2009, thanks to Prof Kovnatskaya, a two-volume collection was published, entitled “Memory to Mikhail Semenovich Druskin”, which united articles, recollections, biographical materials and correspondence. All who knew M. Druskin as a musician, musicologist and teacher took part in the creation of this 1000 page book. Furthermore, in addition to this, Liudmila Kovnatskaya led the task of re-publishing works by Druskin and, as a result, realized an extensive project: a 7-volume Collected Works. At present, the first volume, “Clavir music”, and the fourth volume, “Igor Stravinsky”, are published.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In France he was known as Louis Riccoboni and his stage name was Lélio.\n\nBorn Luigi Andrea Riccoboni in Modena, he was the son of Antonio Riccoboni, who played Pantalone in London in 1678–1679. In 1699 Luigi Riccoboni established a \"commedia dell'arte\" troupe in the French style in northern Italy, since in his view the Italian tradition had become overly decadent. He also translated some of the plays of Molière and Racine into Italian.\n\nIn the spring of 1716 the French Regent, Philippe d'Orléans, asked his cousin, the Duke of Parma, to send him a troupe of Italian actors to revive the Comédie-Italienne in Paris, which had been disbanded nearly twenty years previous. To avoid some of the difficulties of the earlier troupe, he specified that its leader should be a man of good character and manners. Riccoboni was chosen, and in a few weeks he assembled a group of ten actors, all of whom were devout Christians. The troupe was meant to perform in the Hôtel de Bourgogne, which had been vacant since 1697, but that theatre needed renovation, so they initially played at the Théâtre du Palais-Royal on days when the Opéra was not performing. Even after moving to the Bourgogne, the troupe continued to perform at the Palais-Royal on Mondays and Saturdays until the death of the Regent in 1723.\n\nAs a director, Riccoboni initially had difficulty retaining audiences with improvised plays in Italian. More and more he turned to written texts and a style of presentation that was tailored to local tastes, along with an ever increasing use of the French language. In February 1718 he successfully revived some of the old plays of Évariste Gherardi, the director of the Comédie-Italienne in the years prior to 1697. He himself wrote several plays, including \"L'Italien à Paris\" and \"L'Italien francisé\" in which Italian and French manners were juxtaposed. He also began to produce plays by French playwrights, such as Pierre Rémond de Sainte-Albine, whose scenario \"L'Amante difficile\" was performed in Italian. The first play entirely in French was \"Le Naufrage au Port à l'Anglais\" by Jacques Autreau. Riccoboni achieved his greatest acclaim for his expressive acting, particularly in the plays of Marivaux.\n\nRiccoboni appeared in London in 1728–1729. He wrote several books on theatre in Italian and French. One was translated into English in 1741.\n\nRiccoboni married twice, first to actress Gabriella Gardellini (stage name Argentina), and second to Elena Balletti (1686–1771; stage name Flaminia). His son Antoine-François Riccoboni (1707–1772) was an actor who used the stage name Lélio \"fils\" and in 1734 married Marie-Jeanne de La Boras.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4925070", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4925070", "title": "Minsky's Burlesque", "text": "Minsky's Burlesque\n\nMinsky's Burlesque refers to the brand of American burlesque presented by four sons of Louis and Ethel Minsky: Abraham 'Abe' Bennett Minsky (1880–1949), Michael William 'Billy' Minsky (1887–1932), Herbert Kay Minsky (1891-1959), and Morton Minsky (1902–1987). They started in 1912 and ended in 1937 in New York City. Although the shows were declared obscene and outlawed, they were rather tame by modern standards.\n\nThe eldest brother, Abe, launched the business in 1908 with a Lower East Side nickelodeon showing racy films. His own father shut him down and bought the National Winter Garden on Houston Street, which had a theater inconveniently located on the sixth floor. He gave the theater to Abe and his brothers Billy and Herbert. At first they tried showing respectable films but could not compete with the large theater chains. The Minskys tried to bolster their shows by bringing in vaudeville performers but could not afford good acts.\n\nThen they considered burlesque. Burlesque acts were cheaper, and circuits (called \"wheels\") supplied a new show every week, complete with cast, costumes, and scenery. There was the Columbia Wheel, the American Wheel, and the Mutual Wheel. Burlesque during this period was \"clean\"; a fourth wheel, the Independent, actually went bankrupt in 1916 after refusing to clean up its act. The Minskys briefly considered signing with a wheel but decided to stage their own shows because it was cheaper and Billy longed to be the next Florenz Ziegfeld.\n\nBut Minsky's clientele of poor immigrants had not been taught to appreciate clean burlesque, and the Minskys were not about to teach them. Plus, their audience needed a compelling reason to trek up to a sixth-floor theater. Billy realized that success in burlesque depended on how the women were featured. Abe, who had been to Paris and the Folies Bergère and Moulin Rouge, suggested importing one of their trademarks: a runway to bring the women out into the audience. The theater was reconfigured, and the Minskys were the first to feature a runway in the United States. Billy had the sign out front changed to \"Burlesque As You Like It – Not a Family Show,\" and the Minskys were on their way.\n\nThe Minskys were raided for the first time in 1917 when Mae Dix absent-mindedly began removing her costume before she reached the wings. When the crowd cheered, Dix returned to the stage to continue removing her clothing to wild applause. Billy ordered the \"accident\" repeated every night. This began an endless cycle: to keep their license, the Minskys had to keep their shows clean, but to keep drawing customers they had to be risqué. Whenever they went too far, they were raided.\n\nMorton joined the company in 1924, after graduating from New York University, and worked at the Little Apollo Theater on 125th Street. There was a raid during the very first show. For the next four years, the theater showed a weekly profit of $20,000 after payola.\n\nBilly's attempt, however, to present classy burlesque at the Park Theater on Columbus Circle failed miserably.\n\nAnother famous raid occurred in April, 1925, and inspired the book and film \"The Night They Raided Minsky's\". By this time it was permissible for women in shows staged by Ziegfeld, George White, and Earl Carroll – as well as burlesque – to appear topless as long as they did not move (a similar rule in London burlesque was famously demonstrated in the film Mrs. Henderson Presents). In a show at the National Winter Garden, Mademoiselle Fifi (née Mary Dawson from Pennsylvania) stripped to the waist and then moved. Occasionally a raid was triggered by the comedy material, but filthy comics did not last long, because they were a liability to the management.\n\nBusiness boomed during Prohibition and the National Winter Garden's notoriety grew. Regular patrons included John Dos Passos, Robert Benchley, George Jean Nathan, Condé Nast, and Hart Crane (see Crane's poem \"National Winter Garden\" in \"The Bridge)\".\n\nBilly realized that while burlesque could not be classy it could be presented in classy surroundings. In 1931 he proposed bringing the Minsky brand to Broadway, amid the respectable shows. The brothers leased the Republic Theater on 42nd Street and staged their first show on February 12. The Republic became Minsky's flagship theater and the capital of burlesque in the United States. (The theater is now called the New Victory and, ironically, specializes in children's entertainment.) Other burlesque shows were inspired to open on 42nd Street at the nearby Eltinge and Apollo Theaters.\n\nThe Great Depression ushered in the greatest era for burlesque, and Minsky burlesque in particular. Few could afford to attend expensive Broadway shows, yet people craved entertainment. Furthermore, there now seemed to be an unlimited supply of unemployed pretty women who considered the steady work offered by burlesque. By the time they finished expanding, the various Minskys controlled over a dozen theaters – six in New York and others in Baltimore, Philadelphia, Albany, and Pittsburgh. They even formed their own \"wheel.\"\n\nMinsky's featured comics Phil Silvers, Joey Faye, Rags Ragland, Zero Mostel, Jules Munshin, Jimmy Savo, Eddie Collins, Pinky Lee, Morey Amsterdam, Red Buttons, Benny Rubin, Irving Benson, Red Skelton, and Abbott and Costello, as well as headlining stripper Gypsy Rose Lee. Others included Danny Kaye, Jack Albertson and Robert Alda, as well as strippers Lili St. Cyr, Georgia Sothern, Ann Corio, Margie Hart, Mara Gaye and Sherry Britton. These women, who began stripping in their teens, made between $700 and $2,000 a week.\n\nWith burlesque thriving in New York (there were now 14 burlesque theaters, including Minsky's rivals), competition was fierce. Each year, various license commissioners issued restrictions to keep burlesque from pushing the limits. But convictions were rare, so theater managers saw no need to tone down their shows.The Minskys emphasized that a good strip-tease dance must know exactly the right psychological moment to remove each garment. 'It is not just a matter of going on the stage and taking off clothes - it needs finesse.'\n\nIn 1935, irate citizens' groups began calling for action against burlesque. Fiorello H. LaGuardia deemed them a \"corrupting moral influence.\" The city's license commissioner, Paul Moss, tried to revoke Minsky's license but the State Court of Appeals ruled that he did not have grounds without a criminal conviction. Finally, in April, 1937, a stripper at Abe Minsky's New Gotham Theater in Harlem was spotted working without a G-string. The ensuing raid led to the demise not only of Minsky burlesque but of all burlesque in New York. The conviction allowed Moss to revoke Abe's license and refuse to renew all of the other burlesque licenses in New York.\n\nAfter several appeals, the Minskys and their rivals were allowed to reopen only if they adhered to new rules that forbade strippers. The owners went along, hoping to stay in business until the November election when reformist mayor Fiorello La Guardia might be voted out. But business under the new code was so bad that many New York burlesque theaters closed their doors for good. By the time La Guardia was re-elected, the word \"burlesque\" had been banned and, soon after, the Minsky name itself, since the two were synonymous. With that final blow, burlesque and the Minskys were finished in New York.\n\nOf all the Minskys, only Harold, Abe's adopted son, remained active in burlesque. Harold started at age nineteen at the height of the Great Depression, learning the business by working in all facets from the box office to theater management. \"At nineteen, Harold took over the business from his father. Every summer, his parents went to Europe for vacation and the theatres would close due to the heat in New York City. Theatres\nweren’t air-conditioned. The performers begged Harold to keep his doors open; the girls were broke, and they desperately needed the money from the performances. So Harold stayed open and, though a ticket cost a dime, 'He made over\na million dollars,' claimed his wife Dardy Minsky.” By his early twenties, Harold had already produced shows. Harold was the first one to do nudity in a nice way.\n\nHarold would become responsible for discovering and grooming dozens of the most famous names throughout the 1930s into the '50s. Harold claimed to have targeted future headliner fourteen-year-old Sherry Britton from an audition. Harold also employed and nurtured first-rate comic talents such as Phil Silvers.\n\nIn 1956, Harold brought the Minsky name to a Las Vegas revue at the Dunes, where it could exist without apology. Harold, Dardy and their two children moved there while he put on a show at the Dunes. He kept a chorus line, top-rate comedians, a snazzy band, and, of course, the star strippers. He did smashing business; for the first time making burlesque accessible to an upper-middle-class crowd. That revue ran for six years; subsequently, he moved Minsky productions into other landmark casinos such as the Silver Slipper, the Thunderbird, and The Aladdin. \n\nHarold resided in Las Vegas until his death in 1977.\n\nNotes\n"}

The play also deals with the irascibility of Nero and his inability to take heed of the philosopher Seneca's advice to rein in his passions.\n\nThe play was attributed to Seneca, but modern scholarship generally discredits this. It is presumed to have been written later in the Flavian period during the 1st century, after the deaths of both Nero and Seneca.\n\n\nOctavia, weary of her existence, bewails her misery. Her nurse curses the drawbacks which beset life in a Palace. The Nurse consoles Octavia and dissuades her from executing any revenge which she might be contemplating. The Chorus being in favor of Octavia, looks with detestation upon the marriage of Poppaea, and condemns the degenerate patience of the Romans, as being unworthy, too indifferent and servile, and complains about the crimes of Nero. \n\nSeneca deplores the vices of his times, praises the simplicity of his former life, and offers his opinion that all things are tending to the worse. The philosopher warns his patron Nero but to no purpose. Nero stubbornly insists on carrying out his tyrannical plans, and appoints the next day for his marriage with Poppaea. \n\nAgrippina appears from the underworld as a cruel soothsayer. She brings torches from the underworld to grace the wedding, and predicts the death of Nero. Octavia urges the populace, who are espousing her cause, not to grieve about her divorce.

{"id": "1187268", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1187268", "title": "Rational agent", "text": "Rational agent\n\nIn economics, game theory, decision theory, and artificial intelligence, a rational agent is an agent that has clear preferences, models uncertainty via expected values of variables or functions of variables, and always chooses to perform the action with the optimal expected outcome for itself from among all feasible actions. A rational agent can be anything that makes decisions, typically a person, firm, machine, or software.\n\nRational agents are also studied in the fields of cognitive science, ethics, and philosophy, including the philosophy of practical reason.\n\nIn reference to economics, rational agent refers to hypothetical consumers and how they make decisions in a free market. This concept is one of the assumptions made in neoclassical economic theory. The concept of economic rationality arises from a tradition of marginal analysis used in neoclassical economics. The idea of a rational agent is important to the philosophy of utilitarianism, as detailed by philosopher Jeremy Bentham's theory of the felicific calculus, also known as the hedonistic calculus.\n\nThe action a rational agent takes depends on:\n\nIn game theory and classical economics, it is often assumed that the actors, people, and firms are rational. However, the extent to which people and firms behave rationally is subject to debate. Economists often assume the models of rational choice theory and bounded rationality to formalize and predict the behavior of individuals and firms. Rational agents sometimes behave in manners that are counter-intuitive to many people, as in the traveler's dilemma.\n\nMany economic theories reject utilitarianism and rational agency, especially those that might be considered heterodox.\n\nFor example, Thorstein Veblen, known as the father of institutional economics, rejects the notion of hedonistic calculus and pure rationality saying: \"The hedonistic conception of man is that of a lightning calculator of pleasures and pains who oscillates like a homogeneous globule of desire of happiness under the impulse of stimuli that shift him about the area, but leave him intact.\"\n\nVeblen instead perceives human economic decisions as the result of multiple complex cumulative factors: \"It is the characteristic of man to do something, not simply to suffer pleasures and pains through the impact of suitable forces. He is ... a coherent structure of propensities and habits which seeks realization and expression in an unfolding activity. ... They are the products of his hereditary traits and his past experience, cumulatively wrought out under a given body of traditions conventionalities, and material circumstances; and they afford the point of departure for the next step in the process. The economic life history of the individual is a cumulative process of adaptation of means to ends that cumulatively change as the process goes on, both the agent and his environment being at any point the outcome of the last process.\"\nEvolutionary economics also provides criticisms of the Rational Agent, citing the \"parental bent\" (the idea that biological impulses can and do frequently override rational decision making based on utility). Arguments against rational agency have also cited the enormous influence of marketing as proof that humans can be persuaded to make economic decisions that are \"non-rational\" in nature.\n\nNeuroeconomics is a concept that uses neuroscience, social psychology and other fields of science to better understand how people make decisions. Unlike rational agent theory, neuroeconomics does not attempt to predict large-scale human behavior but rather how individuals make decisions in case-by-case scenarios.\n\nArtificial intelligence has borrowed the term \"rational agents\" from economics to describe autonomous programs that are capable of goal directed behavior. Today there is a considerable overlap between AI research, game theory and decision theory. Rational agents in AI are closely related to \"intelligent agents\", autonomous software programs that display intelligence.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "76560", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=76560", "title": "Roscoe Arbuckle", "text": "Roscoe Arbuckle\n\nRoscoe Conkling \"Fatty\" Arbuckle (; March 24, 1887 – June 29, 1933) was an American silent film actor, comedian, director, and screenwriter. Starting at the Selig Polyscope Company he eventually moved to Keystone Studios, where he worked with Mabel Normand and Harold Lloyd. He mentored Charlie Chaplin and discovered Buster Keaton and Bob Hope. Arbuckle was one of the most popular silent stars of the 1910s, and soon became one of the highest paid actors in Hollywood, signing a contract in 1920 with Paramount Pictures for US$1 million (equivalent to approximately $ in dollars).\n\nBetween November 1921 and April 1922, Arbuckle was the defendant in three widely publicized trials for the rape and manslaughter of young film actress Virginia Rappe. Rappe had suddenly fallen ill at a party hosted by Arbuckle at the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco on September 5, 1921; she died four days later. Arbuckle was accused by Rappe's dubious acquaintance of raping and accidentally killing Rappe. After the first two trials, which resulted in hung juries, Arbuckle was acquitted in the third trial and received a formal written statement of apology from the jury.\n\nDespite Arbuckle's acquittal, the scandal ruined his career and even today, has mostly overshadowed his legacy as a pioneering comedian. Following the trials, his films were banned and he was publicly ostracized. Although the ban on his films was lifted within a year, Arbuckle only worked sparingly through the 1920s. He later worked as a film director under the pseudonym William Goodrich. He was finally able to return to acting in 1932, making short two-reel comedies for Warner Bros.\n\nArbuckle died in his sleep of a heart attack in 1933 at the age of 46, reportedly on the same day he signed a contract with Warner Bros. to make a feature film.\n\nRoscoe Conkling Arbuckle was born on March 24, 1887, in Smith Center, Kansas, one of nine children of Mary E. \"Mollie\" Gordon (d. February 19, 1898) and William Goodrich Arbuckle. He weighed in excess of at birth and, as both parents had slim builds, his father believed the child was not his. Consequently, he named the baby after a politician (and notorious philanderer) whom he despised, Republican senator Roscoe Conkling of New York. The birth was traumatic for Mollie and resulted in chronic health problems that contributed to her death 12 years later. \n\nWhen Arbuckle was nearly two his family moved to Santa Ana, California. Roscoe had a \"wonderful\" singing voice and was extremely agile. At the age of eight, with his mother's encouragement, he first performed on stage with Frank Bacon's company during their stopover in Santa Ana. Arbuckle enjoyed performing and continued on until his mother's death in 1899 when he was 12. His father, who had always treated him harshly, now refused to support him and Arbuckle got work doing odd jobs in a hotel. Arbuckle was in the habit of singing while he worked and was overheard by a customer who was a professional singer. The customer invited him to perform in an amateur talent show. The show consisted of the audience judging acts by clapping or jeering with bad acts pulled off the stage by a shepherd's crook. Arbuckle sang, danced, and did some clowning around, but did not impress the audience. He saw the crook emerge from the wings and to avoid it somersaulted into the orchestra pit in obvious panic. The audience went wild, and he not only won the competition but began a career in vaudeville.\n\nIn 1904, Sid Grauman invited Arbuckle to sing in his new Unique Theater in San Francisco, beginning a long friendship between the two. He then joined the Pantages Theatre Group touring the West Coast of the United States and in 1906 played the Orpheum Theater in Portland, Oregon, in a vaudeville troupe organized by Leon Errol. Arbuckle became the main act and the group took their show on tour.\n\nOn August 6, 1908, Arbuckle married Minta Durfee (1889–1975), the daughter of Charles Warren Durfee and Flora Adkins. Durfee starred in many early comedy films, often with Arbuckle. They made a strange couple, as Minta was short and petite while Arbuckle tipped the scales at 300 lbs. Arbuckle then joined the Morosco Burbank Stock vaudeville company and went on a tour of China and Japan returning in early 1909.\n\nArbuckle began his film career with the Selig Polyscope Company in July 1909 when he appeared in \"Ben's Kid\". Arbuckle appeared sporadically in Selig one-reelers until 1913, moved briefly to Universal Pictures and became a star in producer-director Mack Sennett's \"Keystone Cops\" comedies (However, according to the Motion Picture Studio Directory for 1919 and 1921, Arbuckle began his screen career with Keystone in 1913 as an extra for $3 a day (equivalent to approximately $ in dollars), working his way up through the acting ranks to become a lead player and director.) Although his large size was undoubtedly part of his comedic appeal Arbuckle was self-conscious about his weight and refused to use it to get \"cheap\" laughs. For example, he would not allow himself to be stuck in a doorway or chair.\n\nArbuckle was a talented singer. After famed operatic tenor Enrico Caruso heard him sing, he urged the comedian to \"...give up this nonsense you do for a living, with training you could become the second greatest singer in the world.\"\n\nDespite his physical size, Arbuckle was remarkably agile and acrobatic. Director Mack Sennett, when recounting his first meeting with Arbuckle, noted that he \"skipped up the stairs as lightly as Fred Astaire\"; and, \"without warning went into a feather light step, clapped his hands and did a backward somersault as graceful as a girl tumbler\". His comedies are noted as rollicking and fast-paced, have many chase scenes, and feature sight gags. Arbuckle was fond of the \"pie in the face\", a comedy cliché that has come to symbolize silent-film-era comedy itself. The earliest known pie thrown in film was in the June 1913 Keystone one-reeler \"A Noise from the Deep\", starring Arbuckle and frequent screen partner Mabel Normand.\n\nIn 1914, Paramount Pictures made the then-unheard-of offer of US$1,000-a-day plus 25% of all profits and complete artistic control to make movies with Arbuckle and Normand. The movies were so lucrative and popular that in 1918 they offered Arbuckle a three-year, $3 million contract (equivalent to about $ in dollars).\n\nBy 1916, Arbuckle was experiencing serious health problems. An infection that developed on his leg became a carbuncle so severe that doctors considered amputation. Although Arbuckle was able to keep his leg, he became addicted to the pain killer morphine.\n\nFollowing his recovery, Arbuckle started his own film company, Comique, in partnership with Joseph Schenck. Although Comique produced some of the best short pictures of the silent era, in 1918 Arbuckle transferred his controlling interest in the company to Buster Keaton and accepted Paramount's $3 million offer to make up to 18 feature films over three years.\n\nArbuckle disliked his screen nickname. \"Fatty\" had also been Arbuckle's nickname since school; \"It was inevitable\", he said. He weighed 185lb (13st 3lb, 84kg) when he was 12. Fans also called Roscoe \"The Prince of Whales\" and \"The Balloonatic\". However, the name \"Fatty\" identifies the character that Arbuckle portrayed on-screen (usually a naive hayseed)—not Arbuckle himself. When Arbuckle portrayed a female, the character was named \"Miss Fatty\", as in the film \"Miss Fatty's Seaside Lovers\". Arbuckle discouraged anyone from addressing him as \"Fatty\" off-screen, and when they did so his usual response was, \"I've got a name, you know.\"\n\nOn September 5, 1921, Arbuckle took a break from his hectic film schedule and, despite suffering from second-degree burns to both buttocks from an accident on set, drove to San Francisco with two friends, Lowell Sherman and Fred Fishback. The three checked into three rooms at the St. Francis Hotel: 1219 for Arbuckle and Fishback to share, 1221 for Sherman, and 1220 designated as a party room.\n\nSeveral women, including prostitutes, were invited to the suite. During the carousing, a 26-year-old aspiring actress named Virginia Rappe was found seriously ill in room 1219 and was examined by the hotel doctor, who concluded her symptoms were mostly caused by intoxication, and gave her morphine to calm her. Rappe was not hospitalized until two days after the incident.\nVirginia Rappe suffered from chronic cystitis, a condition that liquor irritated dramatically. Her heavy drinking habits and the poor quality of the era's bootleg alcohol could leave her in severe physical distress. She developed a reputation for over-imbibing at parties, then drunkenly tearing at her clothes from the resulting physical pain. But by the time of the St. Francis Hotel party, her reproductive health was a greater concern. Despite reports trying to paint her in a bad light, the autopsy revealed she never had any abortion nor was pregnant. \n\nAt the hospital, Rappe's companion at the party, Bambina Maude Delmont, who had met Rappe only a few days previously, told Rappe's doctor that Arbuckle had raped her \"friend\". Delmont was a woman of highly questionable character and had a lengthy police record for extortion, blackmail and prostitution. The doctor examined Rappe but found no evidence of rape. Rappe died one day after her hospitalization from peritonitis caused by a ruptured bladder. Delmont then told police that Arbuckle had raped Rappe; the police concluded that the impact of Arbuckle's overweight body lying on top of Rappe had eventually caused her bladder to rupture. At a later press conference, Rappe's manager, Al Semnacker, accused Arbuckle of using a jagged piece of ice to simulate sex with Rappe, thus leading to her injuries. By the time the story was reported in newspapers, the object had evolved into either a Coca-Cola or champagne bottle, rather than a piece of ice. In fact, witnesses testified that Arbuckle rubbed the ice on Rappe's stomach to ease her abdominal pain. Arbuckle denied any wrongdoing. Delmont later made a statement incriminating Arbuckle to the police in an attempt to extort money from Arbuckle's attorneys.\nArbuckle's trial was a major media event. William Randolph Hearst's nationwide newspaper chain exploited the situation with exaggerated and sensationalized stories. The story was fueled by yellow journalism, with the newspapers portraying Arbuckle as a gross lecher who used his weight to overpower innocent girls. Hearst was gratified by the profits he accrued during the Arbuckle scandal, and later said that it had \"sold more newspapers than any event since the sinking of the \"Lusitania.\"\" Morality groups called for Arbuckle to be sentenced to death. The resulting scandal destroyed Arbuckle's career along with his personal life. \n\nArbuckle was regarded by those who knew him closely as an amiable, good-natured and generous man who was shy around women; he had been described at the time as \"the most chaste man in pictures\". However, studio executives, fearing negative publicity by association, ordered Arbuckle's industry friends and fellow actors (whose careers they controlled) not to publicly speak up for him. Charlie Chaplin, who was in Britain at the time, told reporters that he could not (and would not) believe Roscoe Arbuckle had anything to do with Virginia Rappe's death; having known Arbuckle since they both worked at Keystone in 1914, Chaplin \"knew Roscoe to be a genial, easy-going type who would not harm a fly.\" Buster Keaton reportedly did make one public statement in support of Arbuckle's innocence, a decision which earned him a mild reprimand from the studio where he worked. Film actor William S. Hart, who had never met or worked with Arbuckle, made a number of damaging public statements in which he presumed that Arbuckle was guilty. Arbuckle later wrote a premise for a film parodying Hart as a thief, bully, and wife beater, which Keaton purchased from him. The resulting film, \"The Frozen North\", was released in 1922, almost a year after the scandal first emerged. Keaton co-wrote, directed and starred in the picture; consequently, Hart refused to speak to Keaton for many years.\n\nThe prosecutor, San Francisco District Attorney Matthew Brady, an intensely ambitious man who planned to run for governor, made public pronouncements of Arbuckle's guilt and pressured witnesses to make false statements. Brady at first used Delmont as his star witness during the indictment hearing. The defense had also obtained a letter from Delmont admitting to a plan to extort payment from Arbuckle. In view of Delmont's constantly changing story, her testimony would have ended any chance of going to trial. Ultimately, the judge found no evidence of rape. After hearing testimony from one of the party guests, Zey Prevon, that Rappe told her \"Roscoe hurt me\" on her deathbed, the judge decided that Arbuckle could be charged with first-degree murder. Brady had originally planned to seek the death penalty. The charge was later reduced to manslaughter.\n\nOn September 17, 1921, Arbuckle was arrested and arraigned on the charges of manslaughter, but arranged bail after nearly three weeks in jail. The trial began November 14, 1921, in the city courthouse in San Francisco. Arbuckle's defense lawyer was Gavin McNab, a professional and competent local attorney that Arbuckle hired as his lead defense counsel. The principal witness was Ms. Zey Prevon, a guest at the party. At the beginning of the trial Arbuckle told his already-estranged wife, Minta Durfee, that he did not harm Rappe; she believed him and appeared regularly in the courtroom to support him. Public feeling was so negative that she was later shot at while entering the courthouse.\n\nBrady's first witnesses during the trial included Betty Campbell, a model, who attended the September 5 party and testified that she saw Arbuckle with a smile on his face hours after the alleged rape occurred; Grace Hultson, a local hospital nurse who testified it was very likely that Arbuckle raped Rappe and bruised her body in the process; and Dr. Edward Heinrich, a local criminologist who claimed that the fingerprints on the door to the hallway proved that Rappe had tried to flee, but that Arbuckle had stopped her by putting his hand over hers. Dr. Arthur Beardslee, the hotel doctor who had examined Rappe, testified that an external force seemed to have damaged the bladder. During cross-examination, however, Betty Campbell revealed that Brady had threatened to charge her with perjury if she did not testify against Arbuckle. Dr. Heinrich's claim to have found fingerprints was cast into doubt after McNab produced the St. Francis hotel maid, who testified that she had thoroughly cleaned the room before the investigation took place. Dr. Beardslee admitted that Rappe had never mentioned being assaulted while he was treating her. McNab was furthermore able to get Nurse Hultson to admit that the rupture of Rappe's bladder could very well have been a result of cancer, and that the bruises on her body could also have been a result of the heavy jewelry she was wearing that evening. During the defense stage of the trial, McNab called various pathology experts who testified that although Rappe's bladder had ruptured, there was evidence of chronic inflammation, and no evidence of any pathological changes preceding the rupture; in other words, there was no external cause for the rupture.\n\nOn November 28, Arbuckle testified as the defense's final witness. Arbuckle was simple, direct, and unflustered in both direct and cross examination. In his testimony, Arbuckle claimed that Rappe (whom he testified that he had known for five or six years) came into the party room (1220) around noon that day, and that some time afterward Mae Taub (daughter-in-law of Billy Sunday) asked him for a ride into town, so he went to his room (1219) to change his clothes and discovered Rappe in the bathroom vomiting in the toilet. Arbuckle then claimed Rappe told him she felt ill and asked to lie down, and that he carried her into the bedroom and asked a few of the party guests to help treat her. When Arbuckle and a few of the guests re-entered the room, they found Rappe on the floor near the bed tearing at her clothing and going into violent convulsions. To calm Rappe down, they placed her in a bathtub of cool water. Arbuckle and Fischbach then took her to room 1227 and called the hotel manager and doctor. At this point all those present thought Rappe was just very drunk, including the hotel doctors. Probably assuming Rappe would simply sleep it off, Arbuckle drove Taub into town.\n\nDuring the whole trial, the prosecution presented medical descriptions of Rappe's bladder as evidence that she had an illness. In his testimony, Arbuckle denied he had any knowledge of Rappe's illness. During cross-examination, Assistant District Attorney Leo Friedman aggressively grilled Arbuckle over the fact that he refused to call a doctor when he found Rappe sick, and argued that he refused to do so because he knew of Rappe's illness and saw a perfect opportunity to rape and kill her. Arbuckle calmly maintained that he never physically hurt or sexually assaulted Rappe in any way during the September 5 party, and he also claimed that he never made any inappropriate sexual advances against any woman in his life. After over two weeks of testimony with 60 prosecution and defense witnesses, including 18 doctors who testified about Rappe's illness, the defense rested. On December 4, 1921, the jury returned five days later deadlocked after nearly 44 hours of deliberation with a 10–2 not guilty verdict, and a mistrial was declared.\n\nArbuckle's attorneys later concentrated their attention on one woman named Helen Hubbard who had told jurors that she would vote guilty \"until hell freezes over\". She refused to look at the exhibits or read the trial transcripts, having made up her mind in the courtroom. Hubbard's husband was a lawyer who did business with the D.A.'s office, and expressed surprise that she was not challenged when selected for the jury pool. While much attention was paid to Hubbard after the trial, some former jury members told reporters that they believed that Arbuckle was indeed guilty, but not beyond a reasonable doubt. During the deliberations, some jurors joined Hubbard in voting to convict but nearly all of them recanted, except for – repeatedly at the end – Thomas Kilkenny (the only other juror who stuck to his 'guilty' vote). Arbuckle researcher Joan Myers describes the political climate and the media attention to the presence of women on juries (which had only been legal for four years at the time), and how Arbuckle's defense immediately singled out Hubbard as a villain; Myers also records Hubbard's account of the jury foreman August Fritze's attempts to bully her into changing her vote to 'not guilty'. While Hubbard offered explanations on her vote whenever challenged, Kilkenny remained silent and quickly faded from the media spotlight after the trial ended.\n\nThe second trial began on January 11, 1922, with a new jury, but with the same legal defense and prosecution team as well as the same presiding judge. The same evidence was presented, but this time one of the witnesses, Zey Prevon, testified that Brady had forced her to lie. Another witness who testified during the first trial, a former security guard named Jesse Norgard, who worked at Culver Studios where Arbuckle worked, testified that Arbuckle had once shown up at the studio and offered him cash in exchange for the key to Rappe's dressing room. The comedian supposedly said he wanted it to play a joke on the actress. Norgard said he refused to give him the key. During cross-examination, Norgard's testimony was called into question when he was revealed to be an ex-convict who was currently charged with sexually assaulting an eight-year-old girl, and who was also looking for a sentence reduction from Brady in exchange for his testimony. Further, in contrast to the first trial, Rappe's history of promiscuity and heavy drinking was detailed. The second trial also discredited some major evidence such as the identification of Arbuckle's fingerprints on the hotel bedroom door: Heinrich retracted his testimony from the first trial and now testified that the fingerprint evidence was likely fabricated. The defense was so confident of an acquittal, that Arbuckle was not called upon to testify. Arbuckle's lawyer, McNab, made no closing argument to the jury. However, some of the jurors interpreted the refusal of Arbuckle testimony as a sign of guilt. After five days and over 40 hours of deliberation, the jury returned on February 3, deadlocked with a 9–3 guilty verdict, resulting in a second mistrial.\n\nBy the time of the third trial, Arbuckle's films had been banned, and the newspapers had been filled for the past seven months with stories of alleged Hollywood orgies, murder, and sexual perversion. Bambina Maud Delmont was touring the country giving one-woman shows as \"The woman who signed the murder charge against Arbuckle\", and lecturing on the evils of Hollywood.\n\nThe third trial began on March 13, 1922, and this time the defense took no chances. McNab took an aggressive defense, completely tearing apart the prosecution's case with long, careful and aggressive examination and cross-examination of each witness. McNab also managed to get in still more evidence about Virginia Rappe's lurid past and medical history. Another hole in the prosecution's case was opened because Zey Prevon, a key witness, fled the country after escaping from police custody and was unavailable to testify. As in the first trial, Arbuckle testified as the final witness and again maintained his innocence in his heartfelt testimony about his version of the events at the party. During closing statements, McNab reviewed how flawed the prosecution's case was against Arbuckle, and how from the very start, District Attorney Brady fell for the outlandish charges of Bambina Maude Delmont, whom McNab described as \"the complaining witness who never witnessed\". On April 12, 1922, The jury began deliberations and took just six minutes to return with a unanimous verdict of not guilty—five of those minutes were spent writing a formal statement of apology to Arbuckle for putting him through the ordeal; an unusual and dramatic move in American justice. The jury statement as read by the foreman stated:\n\nAfter the reading of the apology statement, the jury foreman personally handed the statement to Arbuckle who kept it as a treasured memento for the rest of his life. Then, one by one, the entire 12-person jury plus the two jury alternates walked up to Arbuckle's defense table where they shook his hand and/or embraced and personally apologized to him. The entire jury even proudly posed in a photo op with Arbuckle for photographers after the verdict and apology.\n\nSome experts later concluded that Rappe's bladder might also have ruptured as a result of an abortion she might have had a short time before the September 5th party. Rappe's organs had been destroyed after the autopsy, and it was now impossible to test for pregnancy. Because alcohol was consumed at the party, Arbuckle was forced to plead guilty to one count of violating the Volstead Act, and was fined $500. At the time of his acquittal, Arbuckle owed over $700,000 (equivalent to approximately $ in dollars) in legal fees to his attorneys for the three criminal trials, and he was forced to sell his house and all of his cars to pay some of the debt.\n\nThe scandal and trials had destroyed Arbuckle's popularity among the general public, and in spite of the acquittal and the apology, his reputation was not restored, and the effects of the scandal continued. Will H. Hays, who served as the head of the newly formed Motion Pictures Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA) Hollywood censor board, cited Arbuckle as an example of the poor morals prevalent in Hollywood. On April 18, 1922, six days after Arbuckle's acquittal, Hays banned him from ever working in movies again. He had also requested that all future showings and bookings of Arbuckle films be canceled, and the exhibitors complied.\n\nIn December of the same year, under public pressure, Hays elected to lift the ban. However, Arbuckle was still unable to secure work as an actor. Most exhibitors still declined to show Arbuckle's films, several of which now have no copies known to have survived intact. One of Arbuckle's feature-length films known to survive is \"Leap Year\" (1924), which Paramount declined to release in the United States due to the scandal. The movie was eventually released in Europe. In March 1922, With Arbuckle's films now banned, Buster Keaton signed an agreement to give Arbuckle 35 percent of all future profits from his company, Buster Keaton Productions, to help ease his financial situation.\n\nAlthough it was regarded as Hollywood's first major scandal, the Arbuckle case was one of five major scandals of the period, all coincidentally connected to Paramount Pictures. In 1920, silent film actress Olive Thomas died after accidentally drinking mercury bichloride, which her husband, matinee idol Jack Pickford, had been using as a topical treatment for syphilis; there were rumors that it had been a suicide. In February 1922, the murder of director William Desmond Taylor severely damaged the careers of actresses Mary Miles Minter and former Arbuckle screen partner Mabel Normand. In 1923, actor/director Wallace Reid's dependency on morphine resulted in his death. In 1924, actor/writer/director Thomas H. Ince died mysteriously, aboard William Randolph Hearst's yacht.\n\nIn spite of his acquittal, Hollywood continued to shun Arbuckle, and he could no longer find work. A secondary effect, for archive history, was the determined destruction of copies of films starring Arbuckle. In November 1923, Minta Durfee filed for divorce, charging grounds of desertion. The divorce was granted the following January. They had been separated since 1921, though Durfee always claimed he was the nicest man in the world and they were still friends. After a brief reconciliation, Durfee again filed for divorce, this time while in Paris, in December 1924. Arbuckle married Doris Deane on May 16, 1925.\n\nArbuckle again tried returning to filmmaking, but industry resistance to distributing his pictures continued to linger long after his acquittal. Frustrated, despondent and depressed, he retreated into alcoholism. In the words of his first wife, \"Roscoe only seemed to find solace and comfort in a bottle\". Buster Keaton attempted to help Arbuckle by giving him work on his films. Arbuckle wrote the story for a Keaton short called \"Daydreams\" (1922). Arbuckle allegedly co-directed scenes in Keaton's \"Sherlock, Jr.\" (1924), but it is unclear how much of this footage remained in the film's final cut. In 1925, Carter Dehaven made the short \"Character Studies\". Arbuckle appeared alongside Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, Rudolph Valentino, Douglas Fairbanks, and Jackie Coogan. The same year, in \"Photoplay\"s August issue, James R. Quirk wrote \"I would like to see Roscoe Arbuckle make a comeback to the screen.\" He also said \"The American nation prides itself upon its spirit of fair play. We like the whole world to look upon America as the place where every man gets a square deal. Are you sure Roscoe Arbuckle is getting one today? I'm not.\"\n\nUnable to work in films under his own name, Arbuckle eventually became a director using the alias William Goodrich. According to author David Yallop in \"The Day the Laughter Stopped\" (a biography of Arbuckle with special attention to the scandal and its aftermath), Arbuckle's father's full name was William Goodrich Arbuckle. Another tale credited friend Buster Keaton, an inveterate punster, with suggesting that Arbuckle become a director under the pseudonym \"Will B. Good\". The pun being a bit too obvious, Arbuckle adopted the more formal alias \"William Goodrich\". Keaton himself told this story during a recorded interview with film historian Kevin Brownlow in the 1960s.\n\nBetween 1924 and 1932, Arbuckle directed a number of comedy shorts under the Goodrich pseudonym for Educational Pictures, which featured lesser-known comics of the day. Louise Brooks, who played the ingenue in \"Windy Riley Goes Hollywood\" (1931), also told Brownlow of her experiences in working with Arbuckle:\n\nHe made no attempt to direct this picture. He just sat in his director's chair like a dead man. He had been very nice and sweetly dead ever since the scandal that ruined his career. But it was such an amazing thing for me to come in to make this broken-down picture, and to find my director was the great Roscoe Arbuckle. Oh, I thought he was magnificent in films. He was a wonderful dancer—a wonderful ballroom dancer, in his heyday. It was like floating in the arms of a huge doughnut—really delightful.\n\nAmong the more visible directorial projects under the Goodrich pseudonym was the Eddie Cantor feature \"Special Delivery\" (1927), which was released by Paramount and co-starred William Powell and Jobyna Ralston. His highest-profile project was arguably \"The Red Mill\", also released in 1927, starring Marion Davies.\n\nIn 1929, Doris Deane sued for divorce in Los Angeles, charging desertion and cruelty. On June 21, 1932, Roscoe married Addie Oakley Dukes McPhail (later Addie Oakley Sheldon, 1905–2003) in Erie, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 1932, Arbuckle signed a contract with Warner Bros. to star under his own name in a series of six two-reel comedies, to be filmed at the Vitagraph studios in Brooklyn. These six short films constitute the only known recordings of his voice. Silent film comedian Al St. John (Arbuckle's nephew) and actors Shemp Howard and Lionel Stander appeared with Arbuckle. The films were very successful in America, although when Warner Bros. attempted to release the first one (\"Hey, Pop!\") in the United Kingdom, the British Board of Film Censors cited the 10-year-old scandal and refused to grant an exhibition certificate.\n\nOn June 28, 1933, Arbuckle had finished filming the last of the two-reelers (four of which had already been released). The next day he signed a contract with Warners to star in a feature-length film. That night he went out with friends to celebrate his first wedding anniversary and the new Warner contract when he reportedly said: \"This is the best day of my life.\" He suffered a heart attack later that night and died in his sleep. He was just 46 years old. His widow Addie requested that his body be cremated as that was Arbuckle's wish.\n\nMany of Arbuckle's films, including the feature \"Life of the Party\" (1920), survive only as worn prints with foreign-language inter-titles. Little or no effort was made to preserve original negatives and prints during Hollywood's first two decades. By the early 21st century, some of Arbuckle's short subjects (particularly those co-starring Chaplin or Keaton) had been restored, released on DVD, and even screened theatrically. Arbuckle's early influence on American slapstick comedy is widely recognised.\n\nFor his contributions to the film industry, Arbuckle has a motion pictures star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 6701 Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nThe James Ivory film \"The Wild Party\" (1975) has been repeatedly but incorrectly cited as a film dramatization of the Arbuckle–Rappe scandal. In fact it is loosely based on the 1926 poem by Joseph Moncure March. In this film, James Coco portrays a heavy-set silent-film comedian named Jolly Grimm whose career is on the skids, but who is desperately planning a comeback. Raquel Welch portrays his mistress, who ultimately goads him into shooting her. This film bears some similarities to the misconceptions surrounding the Arbuckle scandal, yet it contains nothing resembling the documented facts of the case.\n\nIn Ken Russell's 1977 biopic \"Valentino\", Rudolph Nureyev as a pre-movie star Rudolph Valentino dances in a nightclub before a grossly overweight, obnoxious, and hedonistic celebrity called \"Mr. Fatty\" (played by William Hootkins), a caricature of Arbuckle rooted in the public view of him created in popular press coverage of the Rappe rape trial. In the scene, Valentino picks up starlet Jean Acker (played by Carol Kane) off a table in which she is sitting in front of Fatty and dances with her, enraging the spoiled star, who becomes apoplectic. The caricature of Arbuckle as a lecherous boor continued to be promulgated in the 1970s by some film writers such as Kenneth Anger in his controversial book \"Hollywood Babylon\".\n\nIn an episode of the \"Mathnet\" segment of the children's public-television television series \"Square One Television\" (Season 2, Episode 1, \"The Case of the Willing Parrot,\" presented in five sections over the course of a week of the overall show), fictitious deceased celebrity Roscoe \"Fatty\" Tissue was written as a parody of Arbuckle.\n\nBefore his untimely death in 1997, popular comedian Chris Farley expressed interest in starring as Arbuckle in a film biography. According to the 2008 biography \"The Chris Farley Show: A Biography in Three Acts\", Farley and screenwriter David Mamet agreed to work together on what would have been Farley's first dramatic role. In 2007, director Kevin Connor planned a film, \"The Life of the Party\", based on Arbuckle's life. It was to star Chris Kattan and Preston Lacy. However the project was shelved. Like Farley, comedians John Belushi and John Candy had also earlier considered playing Arbuckle, but both died before a biopic could be made. Farley's film was signed with Vince Vaughn as his co-star.\n\nIn 2005, jazz trumpet player Dave Douglas released the album \"Keystone\", dedicated to the work of Roscoe Arbuckle. It contains a DVD which features the movie \"Fatty and Mabel Adrift\" (1916/ Keystone – Triangle), starring Roscoe Arbuckle, Mabel Normand, Al St. John, and Luke the Dog.\n\nIn April and May 2006, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City mounted a 56-film, month-long retrospective of all of Arbuckle's known surviving work, running the entire series twice.\n\nArbuckle is the subject of a 2004 novel titled \"I, Fatty\" by author Jerry Stahl. \"The Day the Laughter Stopped\" by David Yallop and \"Frame-Up! The Untold Story of Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle\" by Andy Edmonds are other books on Arbuckle's life. The 1963 novel, \"Scandal in Eden\" by Garet Rogers, is a fictionalized version of the Arbuckle scandal.\n\nFatty Arbuckle's was an American-themed restaurant chain in the UK prominent during the 1980s and named after Arbuckle.\n\n\"Stoneface\", a 2012 play by Vanessa Claire Stewart about Buster Keaton, depicts Keaton's and Arbuckle's friendship and professional relationship.\n\nArbuckle is played by actor Brett Ashy in the motion picture \"Return to Babylon\" (2013).\n\nThe scandal is described during the climax of the film \"Middle Man\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3552803", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3552803", "title": "Show, don't tell", "text": "Show, don't tell\n\nShow, don't tell is a technique used in various kinds of texts to allow the reader to experience the story through action, words, thoughts, senses, and feelings rather than through the author's exposition, summarization, and description. It avoids adjectives describing the author's analysis, but instead describes the scene in such a way that the reader can draw his or her own conclusions. The technique applies equally to nonfiction and all forms of fiction, literature including Haiku and Imagism poetry in particular, speech, movie making, and playwriting.\n\nThe concept is often attributed to Russian playwright Anton Chekhov, reputed to have said \"Don't tell me the moon is shining; show me the glint of light on broken glass.\" What Chekhov actually said, in a letter to his brother, was \"In descriptions of Nature one must seize on small details, grouping them so that when the reader closes his eyes he gets a picture. For instance, you’ll have a moonlit night if you write that on the mill dam a piece of glass from a broken bottle glittered like a bright little star, and that the black shadow of a dog or a wolf rolled past like a ball.\" \n\nThe distinction between telling and showing was popularized in Percy Lubbock's book \"The Craft of Fiction\" (1921), and has been an important element in Anglo-Saxon narratological theory ever since.\n\nNobel Prize–winning novelist Ernest Hemingway was a notable proponent of the \"show, don't tell\" style. His Iceberg Theory, also known as the \"theory of omission\", developed from his background as a newspaper reporter. The term itself originates from his bullfighting treatise, \"Death in the Afternoon\":\n\nIf a writer of prose knows enough of what he is writing about he may omit things that he knows and the reader, if the writer is writing truly enough, will have a feeling of those things as strongly as though the writer had stated them. The dignity of movement of an iceberg is due to only one-eighth of it being above water. \n\nCreative literature (as opposed to technical writing or objective journalism) in general hinges on the artful use of a wide range of devices (such as inference, metaphor, understatement, the unreliable narrator, and ambiguity) that reward the careful reader's appreciation of subtext and extrapolation of what the author chooses to leave unsaid, untold, and/or unshown. This suggests a form of respect for the reader, who should be trusted to develop a feeling for the meaning behind the action, without having the point painfully laid out for them.\n\nIn a 2013 article, Chuck Palahniuk (author of the novel \"Fight Club\") goes as far as recommending a ban of what he calls \"thought verbs\" (\"Thinks, Knows, Understands, Realizes, Believes, Wants, Remembers, Imagines, Desires […]\") favoring instead the use of \"specific sensory detail: action, smell, taste, sound, and feeling.\"\n\n\"Show, don't tell\" should not be applied to all incidents in a story. According to James Scott Bell, \"Sometimes a writer tells as a shortcut, to move quickly to the meaty part of the story or scene. Showing is essentially about making scenes vivid. If you try to do it constantly, the parts that are supposed to stand out won't, and your readers will get exhausted.\" Showing requires more words; telling may cover a greater span of time more concisely. A novel that contains only showing would be incredibly long; therefore, a narrative can contain some legitimate telling.\n\nScenes that are important to the story should be dramatized with showing, but sometimes what happens between scenes can be told so the story can make progress. According to Orson Scott Card and others, \"showing\" is so terribly time consuming that it is to be used only for dramatic scenes. The objective is to find the right balance of telling versus showing, summarization versus action. Factors like rhythm, pace, and tone come into play.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "187557", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=187557", "title": "Smile", "text": "Smile\n\nA smile is a facial expression formed primarily by flexing the muscles at the sides of the mouth. It is believed it takes about 42 muscles to smile. Some smiles include a contraction of the muscles at the corner of the eyes, an action known as a \"Duchenne smile\". Smiles performed without the eye contraction may be perceived as insincere.\n\nAmong humans, smiling is an expression denoting pleasure, sociability, happiness, joy or amusement. It is distinct from a similar but usually involuntary expression of anxiety known as a grimace. Although cross-cultural studies have shown that smiling is a means of communication throughout the world, there are large differences among different cultures, with some using smiles to convey confusion or embarrassment.\n\nPrimatologist Signe Preuschoft traces the smile back over 30 million years of evolution to a \"fear grin\" stemming from monkeys and apes who often used barely clenched teeth to portray to predators that they were harmless, or to signal submission to more dominant group members. The smile may have evolved differently among species and especially among humans. Apart from Biology as an academic discipline that interprets the smile, those who study kinesics and psychology such as Freitas-Magalhaes view the smile as an affect display that can communicate feelings such as love, happiness, glee, pride, contempt, and embarrassment. Also, other types of primates can express this gesture as a symbol of happiness and fun.\n\nA smile seems to have a favorable influence upon others and makes one likable and more approachable. In the social context, smiling and laughter have different functions in the order of sequence in social situations:\n\nSmiling is a signaling system that evolved from a need to communicate information of many different forms. One of these is advertisement of sexual interest. Female smiles are appealing to heterosexual males, increasing physical attractiveness and enhancing sex appeal. However, recent research indicates a man's smile may or may not be most effective in attracting heterosexual women, and that facial expressions such as pride or even shame might be more effective. The researchers ignored the role of smiles in other sexual preferences.\n\nThe influence of smiling on others is not necessarily benign. It may take the form of positive reinforcement, possibly for an underhand manipulative and abusive purpose. See also superficial smile.\n\nWhile smiling is perceived as a positive emotion most of the time, there are many cultures that perceive smiling as a negative expression and consider it unwelcoming. Too much smiling can be viewed as a sign of shallowness or dishonesty. In some parts of Asia, people may smile when they are embarrassed or in emotional pain. Some people may smile at others to indicate a friendly greeting. A smile may be reserved for close friends and family members. Many people in the former Soviet Union area consider smiling at strangers in public to be unusual and even suspicious behavior. \n\nCheek dimples are visible indentations of the epidermis, caused by underlying flesh, which form on some people's cheeks, especially when they smile. Dimples are genetically inherited and are a dominant trait. A rarer form is the single dimple, which occurs on one side of the face only. Anatomically, dimples may be caused by variations in the structure of the facial muscle known as zygomaticus major. Specifically, the presence of a double or bifid zygomaticus major muscle may explain the formation of cheek dimples. \n\nThis bifid variation of the muscle originates as a single structure from the zygomatic bone. As it travels anteriorly, it then divides with a superior bundle that inserts in the typical position above the corner of the mouth. An inferior bundle inserts below the corner of the mouth.\n\nWhile conducting research on the physiology of facial expressions in the mid-19th century, French neurologist Guillaume Duchenne identified two distinct types of smiles. A Duchenne smile involves contraction of both the zygomatic major muscle (which raises the corners of the mouth) and the orbicularis oculi muscle (which raises the cheeks and forms crow's feet around the eyes). The Duchenne smile has been described as \"smizing\", as in \"smiling with the eyes\". An exaggerated Duchenne smile is associated with lying.\n\nA non-Duchenne smile involves only the zygomatic major muscle. \"Research with adults initially indicated that joy was indexed by generic smiling, any smiling involving the raising of the lip corners by the zygomatic major [...]. More recent research suggests that smiling in which the muscle around the eye contracts, raising the cheeks high (Duchenne smiling), is uniquely associated with positive emotion.\"\n\nThe Pan Am smile, also known as the \"Botox smile\", is the name given to a fake smile, in which only the zygomatic major muscle is voluntarily contracted to show politeness. It is named after the now defunct airline Pan American World Airways, whose flight attendants would always flash every passenger the same perfunctory smile. Botox was introduced for cosmetic use in 2002. Chronic use of Botox injections to deal with eye wrinkle can result in the paralysis of the small muscles around the eyes, preventing the appearance of a Duchenne smile.\n\nIn animals, the baring of teeth is often used as a threat or warning display—known as a snarl—or a sign of submission. For chimpanzees, it can also be a sign of fear. However, not all animal displays of teeth convey negative acts or emotions. For example, Barbary macaques demonstrate an open mouth display as a sign of playfulness, which likely has similar roots and purposes as the human smile.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27938628", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27938628", "title": "The Mongoliad", "text": "The Mongoliad\n\nThe Mongoliad is a fictional narrative set in the \"Foreworld Saga\", a secret history transmedia franchise developed by the Subutai Corporation. \"The Mongoliad\" was originally released in a serialized format online, and via a series of iOS and Android apps, but was restructured and re-edited for a definitive edition released via the Amazon Publishing imprint 47North, both in print and in Kindle format. Fan-submitted Foreworld stories are published via Amazon's Kindle Worlds imprint.\n\nThe serialized edition was intended to be distributed primarily as a series of applications (\"apps\") for smartphones, which the Subutai Corporation viewed as a new model for publishing storytelling. At the project's core is a narrative of adventure fiction following the exploits of a small group of fighters and mystics in medieval Europe around the time of the Mongol conquests. As well as speculative fiction authors Neal Stephenson (chairman of Subutai), Greg Bear, Nicole Galland, Mark Teppo and others, collaborators include filmmakers, computer programmers, graphic artists, martial artists and combat choreographers, video game designers, and a professional editor. In a departure from conventional fiction, much of the content of \"The Mongoliad\" was in forms other than text, not bound to any single medium and not in the service of the central narrative. Once the project developed momentum, the Subutai Corporation envisioned fans of the work contributing, expanding and enriching the narrative, and the fictional universe in which it takes place.\n\nAccording to Jeremy Bornstein, president of the Subutai Corporation, the genesis of the project was in Stephenson's dissatisfaction with the authenticity of the early modern swordfighting scenes he had written into his series \"The Baroque Cycle\". Stephenson gathered a group of martial arts enthusiasts interested in studying historical European swordfighting, and this eventually resulted in some of the members of this group collaborating on a set of stories that would make use of accurate representations of these martial arts.\nThe collaborators decided that the project need not limit itself to the traditional novel form and began developing ideas on how to produce it in different media while retaining the caliber that would be expected of a new work by authors such as Stephenson or Bear.\n\nAn \"alpha version\" was demonstrated at the periodic application showcase SF App Show in San Francisco, California on May 25, 2010.\n\nThe serialized project ran from September 1, 2010 until January 25, 2012. New chapters, as well as supplemental materials, were released on a semi-regular schedule. The iOS apps were available in the Apple App Store, and the Android app was available in the Android Store. The print edition was published on April 24, 2012. The mongoliad.com website was subsequently closed.\n\nThe serial novels and their related, shorter \"SideQuests\" are set in the authors' \"Foreworld\" universe, which they describe as \"almost like the world we live in,\" during the mid-thirteenth century Mongol invasion of Europe, under leadership of Genghis Khan and his successor Ögedei Khan. The story includes descriptions of Ögedei Khan's court (notably, his rolling \"ordo\" tent); the geography, flora and fauna of the great Eurasian Steppe; and especially medieval European and Asian martial arts. A parallel plot line takes place in Rome, and includes highly detailed depictions of a papal conclave.\n\nThe novels incorporate historical events in Poland, Rome, Russia and central Asia that ran concurrently with the last major events of the Mongol invasion. The authors construct a fictional narrative that connects all these events of the year 1241, describing some earlier historical events and adding other entirely fictional events and characters. Some medieval mythology is also included in the later books, especially the Holy Grail and elements of Norse mythology. \n\nMongol events and persons described in the books include Ögedei's recollection of the 1201 battle of Khalakhaljid Sands, which cemented Ghengis' leadership of the clans, and the 1229 death of his brother Tolui, described in The Secret History of the Mongols as a heroic sacrifice to save Ögedei's life. Later, the 1241 death of Ögedei Khan (cause unknown) and the resulting recall of all the Khans to select a new \"Khan of Khans\" is woven into the fictional narrative.\n\nThe Siege of Kiev (1240) and other events in the Mongol invasion of Rus and Europe are described in 1241 by a survivor, as a group of the novel's fictional characters pass through the ruined city. The Battle of Mohi (Hungary) and the Battle of Legnica (Poland) are also described by fictional \"survivors\". Several religious orders of knights formed during the Crusades (and their leaders), including the Teutonic Order, Knights Hospitaller and Livonian Brothers of the Sword are involved in the narrative. \n\nHistorical events and persons in 1241 Rome include the papal conclave that selected Cardinal Castiglione to become Pope Celestine IV. Cardinal Fieschi (later Pope Innocent IV), and other future Popes are also members of the conclave. Senator Matteo Rosso Orsini and Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II also appear as fictionalized characters.\n\nAlexander Nevsky's 1242 campaign against German and Estonian invaders is a major subject of Book 4, including the climactic Battle on the Ice. The mythical Baba Yaga helps the protagonists defend Kievan Rus'. In Book 5, the action shifts to the Albigensian Crusade against Catharism, and the 1244 siege of Château de Montségur.\n\nThe series is identified interchangeably by the publisher as \"The Foreworld Saga\" and \"Mongoliad Cycle.\"\n\nThe approximate page-count of each story places their literary format somewhere between a long short story and a short novella, with the exception of the \"Foreworld SideQuest Comics\" which are in comics format. All were initially published in e-book and/or audio formats only. \n\nIn keeping with Subutai's original intent to augment the Foreworld Saga with fan or community content, fan fiction publisher Kindle Worlds published ten new stories \"inspired by\" the \"Foreworld Saga\" in June, 2013. \"Foreworld Saga\" co-author and showrunner Mark Teppo explains, \"As you can see from the Kindle Worlds storefront, there is a distinction between Canon and Kindle Worlds material. We’d like to see some of the Kindle Worlds material elevate itself up to Canon by its quality.\" \n\n\n"}

It was intended to produce a trustworthy throw of one or more dice. It was discovered in 1985 in Germany. It is preserved in the Rheinisches Landesmuseum of Bonn.\n\nThe tower dates to the fourth century AD and was apparently presented as a gift. It bears two Latin texts. The longer text commemorates a military defeat of the Picts. The shorter text wishes good luck to the unnamed recipients of the item.\n\nThe dice tower was discovered in 1985 near the modern villages of Vettweiss and Froitzheim. During the Roman era this location was in the province of Germania Inferior on the Imperial frontier with Germania. This was the site of a villa in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The major military centre of Cologne was located nearby.\n\nIt is an upright, hollow cuboid of copper-alloy plate designed to sit level on a flat surface. The top of the dice tower is open, allowing for the introduction of dice, and it contains three levels of projecting baffles which would produce random motion in the dice as they fell through the tower.\nThe dice would then emerge at the base of the tower via a miniature flight of steps. The dice, while emerging, would ring three bells which formerly hung above the exit. One of these bells survives intact.\n\nThe tower is decorated on all faces with pierced patterns and two short Latin texts are displayed prominently.\n\nThe front face of the tower bears the words,\n\nWhich may be translated as,\n\nAround the top of the three remaining faces is the phrase,\n\nWhich may be translated as,\n"}
