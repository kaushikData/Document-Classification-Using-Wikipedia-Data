{"id": "51113403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51113403", "title": "13th (film)", "text": "13th (film)\n\n13th is a 2016 American documentary by director Ava DuVernay. The film explores the \"intersection of race, justice, and mass incarceration in the United States;\" it is titled after the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which freed the slaves and prohibited slavery, with the exception of slavery as punishment for a crime.\n\nDuVernay contends that slavery has been perpetuated in practices since the end of the American Civil War through such actions as criminalizing behavior and enabling police to arrest poor freedmen and force them to work for the state under convict leasing; suppression of African Americans by disenfranchisement, lynchings and Jim Crow; politicians declaring a war on drugs that weigh more heavily on minority communities and, by the late 20th century, mass incarceration of people of color in the United States. She examines the prison-industrial complex and the emerging detention-industrial complex, demonstrating how much money is being made by corporations from such incarcerations.\n\n\"13th\" has garnered acclaim from film critics. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature at the 89th Academy Awards, and won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Special at the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards.\n\nThe film begins with an audio clip of former President Barack Obama stating that the US has 5 percent of the world's population but 25 percent of the world's prisoners. This film features several prominent activists, academics, politicians from \"both sides of the aisle,\" and public figures, such as Angela Davis, Bryan Stevenson, Van Jones, Newt Gingrich, Cory Booker, Henry Louis Gates Jr., and others.\n\nIt deeply explores the economic history of slavery and post-Civil War racist legislation and practices that replaced it as \"systems of racial control\" and forced labor from the years after the abolition of slavery to the present. Southern states criminalized minor offenses, arresting freedmen and forcing them to work when they could not pay fines; institutionalizing this approach as convict leasing (which created an incentive to criminalize more behavior). They disenfranchised most blacks across the South at the turn of the 20th century, excluding them from the political system (including juries), at the same time that lynching of blacks by white mobs reached a peak in these decades. In addition to such violence, Jim Crow legislation was passed by Democrats to legalize segregation and suppress minorities, forcing them into second-class status. Following the passage of civil rights legislation in the 1960s that restored civil rights, the film notes the Republican Party's appeal to southern white conservatives, including the claim to be the party to fight the war on crime and war on drugs, which began to include mandatory, lengthy sentencing. A new wave of minority suppression began, reaching African Americans and others in the northern, mid-western and western cities where many had migrated in earlier decades. After their presidential candidates lost to Republicans, Democratic politicians such as Bill Clinton joined the war on drugs.\n\nAs a result, from the early 1970s to the present, the rate of incarceration and the number of people in prisons has climbed dramatically in the United States, although the rate of crime has continued to decline since the late 20th century. As late as the 2016 presidential election, certain politicians worked to generate fear of crime, claiming high rates in New York City, for instance, which was not true. The documentary says crime lower overall than it has been in decades, but Republican candidates are said to have raised it to create fear. Private prison contractors had entered the market to satisfy demand as arrests and sentences increased, forming an independent group with its own economic incentives to criminalize minor activities and lengthen sentences in order to keep prisons full. Politicians and businessmen in rural areas encouraged construction of prisons to supply local jobs, and they also have had incentives to keep prisons full.\n\nDecades later, studies have shown that private prisons are no more efficient and are often more abusive than those run by the federal or state governments. The federal Bureau of Prisons announced in 2016 its intention to stop contracting with private providers for prison services. The over-incarceration of adults has severely damaged generations of black and minority families and their children.\n\nThe film explores the role of the American Legislative Exchange Council, backed by corporations, that has provided Republican state and federal legislators with draft legislation to support the prison-industrial complex. Only after some of the relationships were revealed did corporations like Wal-Mart and others receive criticism and drop out of the organization. Many businesses continue to make huge profits from prisons, including Securus, which provides telephone services at high rates and Aramark which provides food services that are substandard. \n\nThe film explores the demonization of minority poor through these decades to serve political ends, contributing to unrealistic fears of minorities by whites and to persistent problems of police brutality against minority communities. In the 21st century, the regularity of fatal police shootings of unarmed minorities in apparently minor confrontations has been demonstrated by videos taken by bystanders and by the increasing use of cams in police cars or worn by officers; DuVernay ends the film with a graphic procession of recent videos of fatal shootings of blacks by police, what Manohla Dargis describes as, after the previous discussion, having the effect of \"a piercing, keening cry.\"\n\nThe film was written by Ava DuVernay, who wrote and directed \"Selma\" (2015), and Spencer Averick. Averick also edited the film. Produced and filmed in secrecy, \"13th\" was revealed only after it was announced as the opening film for the 2016 New York Film Festival, the first documentary ever to open the festival.\n\nThe film was released on October 7, 2016 on Netflix. The companion piece \"13th: A Conversation with Oprah Winfrey & Ava DuVernay\" was released on January 26, 2017 in the United States and on January 31, 2017 worldwide on the service.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 96% based on 79 reviews, with an average rating of 8.8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"\"13th\" strikes at the heart of America's tangled racial history, offering observations as incendiary as they are calmly controlled.\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 90 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\n\nManohla Dargis of \"The New York Times\" praised what she called the power of DuVernay's film and its meticulous marshaling of facts. She says, summarizing the film: \"The United States did not just criminalize a select group of black people. It criminalized black people as a whole, a process that, in addition to destroying untold lives, effectively transferred the guilt for slavery from the people who perpetuated it to the very people who suffered through it.\"\n\nPeter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" awarded the film four stars and named it one of the best films of 2016.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "34226818", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34226818", "title": "Aquarion Evol", "text": "Aquarion Evol\n\nThe story is set in the same universe as the original \"Genesis of Aquarion\", and takes place twelve thousand years after. The protagonists live on a planet called Vega, while most of the antagonists originate from its \"sister planet\", Altair. The main character, Amata Sora, a young man that has kept his ability to fly a secret since youth, meets a girl named Mikono Suzushiro, and they become fast friends. However, invaders from Altair begin large-scale attacks against Vega, forcing Amata and Mikono into a long battle for the planet as members of an organization called Neo-DEAVA. There they, along with other young men and women called Elements who also possess special powers, are recruited to pilot giant robots called Aquaria in the defense of Vega.\n\nLike the original, the themes of love, mutual understanding, and individual growth play an important role in the story, albeit in different ways. For example, a prohibition on romance is enacted on the members of Neo-DEAVA for the duration of the series. The main characters are again reincarnations of the legendary beings described in \"Aquarion\", and much of the latter half of the series works to establish connections with the series' predecessor.\n\nTwelve thousand years after the events of \"Genesis of Aquarion\", mankind living on the planet is threatened by a new enemy from the planet whose female population was wiped out by a mysterious disease called the . The Alteans using their \"Abductors\", just like the Shadow Angels, invade the cities in Vega to kidnap its female inhabitants, looking for a way to ensure the preservation of their race.\n\nTo defend against the invasion, the organization establishes two teams, one composed of only males and other of only females, each one piloting their own giant machines called \"Aquaria\". To protect their new friend Mikono, teenager Amata Sora makes use of the power he has kept in secret his entire life and by combining Vectors with male and female pilots into one single robot, the legendary giant Aquarion is reborn.\n\nAquarion EVOL, while a giant robot show at heart, focuses mostly on the characters and character development. Of its many themes, that of love is the most prominent. The restriction placed on the members of Neo-DEAVA that forbids love at the same time permits a real development in the characters' relationships from infatuation and teen romance to love. It also presents a different view of love held by characters of Altair, whose perceptions of it are warped by the current state of their planet - that of the complete extinction of women. The theme of love is explored further in a few other examples, such as a character from Neo-DEAVA and an Altair spy growing very attached to each other, and another character being forced to examine his own feelings after his love interest is transformed into a man. Overall, love and relationships between characters lead to them being able to at least partially understand each other.\n\nWhile not as big a theme as romantic love in the series, family relationships are also explored. Three of the main characters - Amata, Mikono, and MIX - all have strained relationships with parents for various reasons, and each is forced to come to terms with what those relationships have produced. Amata's feeling of abandonment, Mikono's feelings of shyness, and MIX's moral opposition to her father's behavior are all explored through the relationships they have with each other.\n\nAs in the original \"Aquarion\", reincarnation of people of myth and legend is a major theme. However, the series repeatedly undermines assumptions made by the viewers, especially those that have watched the original series. The many plot twists regarding the identity of the characters' reincarnations are brought to a head during their final battle.\n\nMany staff members from the original \"Aquarion\" were brought back to work on this series; however, as the director Kawamori wished to create a series that didn't require viewers to have seen the original, many themes were reworked.\n\nThe main character designs were split between two designers: Chinatsu Kurahana, who worked on the male characters, and Ishida Kana, who was in charge of the female ones.\n\nAquarion Evol first premiered on TV Tokyo on January 8, 2012 in a one-hour special featuring its two first episodes. Just like the original series, it is produced by studio Satelight and directed by Shoji Kawamori. It was announced at Supanova Melbourne 2012 that Madman Entertainment had acquired the series for English release. At Otakon 2012, Satelight had announced that Funimation (whom later confirmed) has licensed the series.\n\nOn January 14, 2012 the manga began publishing by Media Factory, an adaptation of the anime written by Aogiri.\n\nSōsei no Aquarion Love is an OVA featuring a crossover between characters from both \"Aquarion EVOL\" and its prequel \"Genesis of Aquarion\". It aired in Japan on July 2, 2015, just before the premiere of the newest Aquarion series \"Aquarion Logos\".\n\nOn April 25, 2012, a light novel adaptation of the anime, written by Yasujiro Uchiyama, began serialization by MF Bunko J, with illustrations by Kana Ishida, one of the anime's character designers.\n\nOpening theme\n\nEnding themes\n\nInsert songs\n\nSeveral pieces of music from \"Genesis of Aquarion's\" original soundtrack are featured as insert songs, among brand new compositions.\n\n\nAs with the original series, Yoko Kanno composed the theme music and soundtracks. Gabriela Robin wrote the lyrics to both of the theme songs. The original soundtrack, , was released on May 23, 2012. An original album titled \"Love @ New Dimension\", featuring all of the vocal tracks featured in \"Aquarion Evol\" with some new instrumentals by Kanno and new songs were released on July 25, 2012.\n\n"}

The phrase \"takes aim at how economists use assumptions to simplify—and sometimes oversimplify—the problems they face\". It may be used to express the writer's disdain for \"the propensity of modern economic theory for unjustified and oversimplified assumptions.\"\n\nIt derives from a joke which dates to at least 1970 and possibly originated with British economists. The first book mentioning it is likely \"Economics as a Science\" (1970) by Kenneth E. Boulding:\n\nThere is a story that has been going around about a physicist, a chemist, and an economist who were stranded on a desert island with no implements and a can of food. The physicist and the chemist each devised an ingenious mechanism for getting the can open; the economist merely said, \"Assume we have a can opener\"!\n\nThe phrase was popularized in a 1981 book and has become sufficiently well known that many writers on economic topics use it as a catchphrase without further explanation.\n\nThe joke and its application to economists were taken up in the 1981 book \"Paper Money\" by \"Adam Smith\" (pseudonym of George Goodman), wherein he applied the story to the then-tendency of economists to assume that inflation would go away, and mocked the notion that economists are \"the high priests of this esoteric mystery.\" In contrast, he asks \"why the economists are always wrong.\" The phrase \"assume a can opener\" became \"his nagging accusation against the deductive logic and analytical models of economists.\"\n\nThe Italian finance minister Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa used the phrase in 2006 to illustrate that \"Very often, when economists comment, they assume politics away.\" It has been used in Australia to describe \"a treasurer who has lost all touch with reality\" and politicians \"assuming away\" the problem of getting a global greenhouse gas deal. It was used in India to describe American economic policy toward China.\n\nIt has been extended beyond economics to describe diplomats and negotiators working toward peace in the Middle East, who have \"attempted to build confidence among the warring parties as if the conflict were just a big misunderstanding\" and who \"assumed leaders who did not exist, as a way to conjure a preferable reality.\"\n\nIt is also sometimes applied to models in other fields as well such as the social sciences where certain problems are solved based on unrealistic assumptions.\n\n"}

{"id": "345780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=345780", "title": "Backhaul (broadcasting)", "text": "Backhaul (broadcasting)\n\nIn the context of broadcasting, backhaul refers to uncut program content that is transmitted point-to-point to an individual television station or radio station, broadcast network or other receiving entity where it will be integrated into a finished TV show or radio show. The term is independent of the medium being used to send the backhaul, but communications satellite transmission is very common. When the medium is satellite, it is called a wildfeed.\n\nBackhauls are also referred to sometimes as \"clean feeds\", being \"clean\" in the sense that they lack any of the post-production elements that are added later to the feed's content (i.e. on-screen graphics, voice-overs, bumpers, etc.) during the integration of the backhaul feed into a finished show. In live sports production, a backhaul is used to obtain live game footage (usually for later repackaging in highlights shows) when an off-air source is not readily available. In this instance the feed that is being obtained contains all elements except for TV commercials or radio ads run by the host network's master control. This is particularly useful for obtaining live coverage of post-game press conferences or extended game highlights (\"melts\"), since the backhaul may stay up to feed these events after the network has concluded their broadcast.\n\nElectronic news gathering, including \"live via satellite\" interviews, reporters' live shots, and sporting events are all examples of radio or television content that is backhauled to a station or network before being made available to the public through that station or network. Cable TV channels, particularly public, educational, and government access (PEG) along with (local origination) channels, may also backhauled to cable headends before making their way to the subscriber. Finished network feeds are not considered backhauls, even if local insertion is used to modify the content prior to final transmission.\n\nThere exists a dedicated group of enthusiasts who use TVRO (TV receive-only) gear such as big ugly dishes or \"BUDs\" to peek in on backhaul signals that are available on any of the dozens of broadcast satellites that are visible from almost any point on Earth. In its early days, their hobby was strengthened by the fact that most backhaul was analog and \"in the clear\" (unscrambled or unencrypted) which made for a vast smorgasbord of free television available for the technically inclined amateur. In recent years, full-time content and cable channels have added encryption and conditional access, and occasional signals are steadily becoming digital, which has had a deleterious effect on the hobby.\n\nSome digital signals remain freely accessible (sometimes using K band dishes as small as one meter) under the international DVB-S standard or the US Motorola-proprietary Digicipher system. The small dishes may either be fixed (much like DBS antennas), positioned using a rotor (usually DiSEqC-standard) or may be toroidal in design (twin toroidal reflectors focus the incoming signal as a line, not a point, so that multiple LNBs may receive signal from multiple satellites). A \"blind-search\" receiver is often used to try every possible combination of frequency and bitrate to search for backhaul signals on individual communication satellites.\n\nThe 1992 documentary \"Feed\" was compiled almost entirely using unedited backhaul from political campaign coverage by local and network television. A similar documentary about the 1992 U.S. presidential election named \"Spin\" was made in the same way in 1995.\n\n"}

It is danced to the music of the same name introduced by Cuban composer and violinist Enrique Jorrin in the early 1950s. This rhythm was developed from the danzón-mambo. The name of the dance is an onomatopoeia derived from the shuffling sound of the dancers' feet.\n\nIn the early 1950s, Enrique Jorrín worked as a violinist and composer with the charanga group Orquesta América. The group performed at dance halls in Havana where they played danzón, danzonete, and danzon-mambo for dance-orientated crowds. Jorrín noticed that many of the dancers at these gigs had difficulty with the syncopated rhythms of the danzón-mambo. To make his music more appealing to dancers, Jorrín began composing songs where the melody was marked strongly on the first downbeat and the rhythm was less syncopated. When Orquesta América performed these new compositions at the Silver Star Club in Havana, it was noticed that the dancers had improvised a triple step in their footwork producing the sound \"cha-cha-cha\". Thus, the new style came to be known as \"cha-cha-chá\" and became associated with a dance where dancers perform a triple step.\n\nThe basic footwork pattern of cha-cha-chá (two, three, cha-cha-cha) is also found in several Afro-Cuban dances from the Santería religion. For example, one of the steps used in the dance for the orisha Ogun uses an identical footwork pattern. These Afro-Cuban dances predate the development of cha-cha-chá and were known by many Cubans in the 1950s, especially those of African origin. Thus, the footwork of the cha-cha-chá was likely inspired by these Afro-Cuban dances.\n\nIn 1953, Orquesta América released two of Jorrin’s compositions, \"La Engañadora\" and \"Silver Star\", on the Cuban record label Panart. These were the first cha-cha-chá compositions ever recorded. They immediately became hits in Havana, and other Cuban charanga orchestras quickly imitated this new style. Soon, there was a cha-cha-chá craze in Havana’s dance halls, popularizing both the music and the associated dance. This craze soon spread to Mexico City, and by 1955 the music and dance of the cha cha cha had become popular in Latin America, the United States, and Western Europe, following in the footsteps of the mambo, which had been a worldwide craze a few years earlier.\n\nCha-cha-chá is danced to authentic Cuban music, although in ballroom competitions it is often danced to Latin Pop or Latin Rock. The music for the international ballroom cha-cha-chá is energetic and with a steady beat. The music may involve complex polyrhythms.\n\nStyles of cha-cha-chá dance may differ in the place of the chasse in the rhythmical structure. The original Cuban and the ballroom cha-cha count is \"two, three, chachacha\", \"four-and-one, two, three\" or \"one, two, three, chacha\". The dance does not start on the first beat of a bar, though it can start with a transfer of weight to the lead's right.\n\nNevertheless, many social dancers count \"one, two, cha-cha-cha\" and may find it difficult to make the adjustment to the correct timing of the dance, \"two, three, cha-cha, one\".\n\nThe basic pattern involves the lead (usually the man) taking a checked forward step with the left foot, retaining some weight on the right foot. The knee of the right leg must stay bent and close to the back of the left knee, the left leg having straightened just prior to receiving part weight. This step is taken on the second beat of the bar. Full weight is returned to the right leg on the second step (beat three).\n\nThe fourth beat is split in two so the count of the next three steps is 4-and-1. These three steps constitute the \"cha-cha chasse\". A step to the side is taken with the left foot, the right foot is half closed towards the left foot (typically leaving both feet under the hips or perhaps closed together), and finally there is a last step to the left with the left foot. The length of the steps in the chasse depends very much on the effect the dancer is attempting to make.\n\nThe partner takes a step back on the right foot, the knee being straightened as full weight is taken. The other leg is allowed to remain straight. It is possible it will shoot slightly but no deliberate flexing of the free leg is attempted. This is quite different from technique associated with salsa, for instance. On the next beat (beat three) weight is returned to the left leg. Then a chasse is danced RLR.\n\nEach partner is now in a position to dance the bar their partner just danced. Hence the fundamental construction of Cha-cha extends over two bars.\n\nThe checked first step is a later development in the \"international cha-cha\" style. Because of the action used during the forward step (the one taking only part weight) the basic pattern turns left, whereas in earlier times Cha-cha was danced without rotation of the alignment. Hip actions are allowed to occur at the end of every step. For steps taking a single beat the first half of the beat constitutes the foot movement and the second half is taken up by the hip movement. The hip sway eliminates any increase in height as the feet are brought towards each other.\nIn general, steps in all directions should be taken first with the ball of the foot in contact with the floor, and then with the heel lowering when the weight is fully transferred; however, some steps require that the heel remain lifted from the floor. When weight is released from a foot, the heel should release from the floor first, allowing the toe to maintain contact with the floor.\n\nIn traditional American Rhythm style, Latin hip movement is achieved through the alternate bending and straightening action of the knees, though in modern competitive dancing, the technique is virtually identical to the \"international Latin\" style.\n\nIn the international Latin style, the weighted leg is almost always straight. The free leg will bend, allowing the hips to naturally settle into the direction of the weighted leg. As a step is taken, a free leg will straighten the instant before it receives weight. It should then remain straight until it is completely free of weight again.\n\nCha-cha is one of the five dances of the \"Latin American\" program of international ballroom competitions.\n\nAs described above, the basis of the modern dance was laid down in the 1950s by Pierre & Lavelle and developed in the 1960s by Walter Laird and other top competitors of the time. The basic steps taught to learners today are based on these accounts.\n\nIn general, steps are kept compact and the dance is danced generally without any rise and fall; this is the modern ballroom technique of Cha-cha (and other ballroom dances). \n\n\n"}

While Monck went to the South Kent School on Ice Hockey and Crew scholarships, he became more interested in welding and machinery, designing a potato harvester that he sold to McCormick. He began volunteering with a summer theater group at Wellesley College, learning the basics of theatrical lighting from Greg Harney. He began auditing classes at Harvard while working with the university's theater company.\n\nMonck began working at the Greenwich Village nightclub The Village Gate in 1959, lighting comedians and Jazz and Folk artists, and living in the basement apartment under the club (Bob Dylan wrote \"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall\" on Monck's IBM Selectric typewriter). He began an eight-year-long relationship with the Newport Folk Festival, and a nine-year one with the Newport Jazz Festival, while continuing to work at the Gate. He became friends with Charles Altman of the Altman Lighting Co., repairing equipment and borrowing lighting instruments to improve the stage lighting of the Gate. He began lighting the stage of the Apollo Theater in Harlem.\n\nIn 1967, he lit the Monterey Pop Festival, which featured the first major American appearances by Jimi Hendrix and The Who, as well as the first major public performances of Janis Joplin. Monck's work can be seen in the D. A. Pennebaker film \"Monterey Pop\". That year, he also lit The Byrds at the Hollywood Bowl and his first Rolling Stones concert. The following year, he worked with Crosby, Stills and Nash in Europe, and began working with concert impresario Bill Graham, renovating the Fillmore theaters. He also designed the distinctive half-shell stage at the Miami Pop Festival (December 1968), which was called the Flying Stage, and was one of the festival's two, simultaneously operating main stages.\n\nIn 1969 he lit the concert that would define his career and make him a public figure.\n\nMonck was hired to plan and build the staging and lighting, ten weeks of work for which he was paid $7,000. Much of his plan had to be scrapped when the promoters were not allowed to use the original location in Wallkill, New York. The stage roof that was constructed in the shorter time available was not able to support the lighting that had been rented, which wound up sitting unused underneath the stage. The only light on the stage was from spotlights.\n\nHe was drafted just before the concert started as the master of ceremonies when Michael Lang noticed that they had forgotten to hire one. He can be heard (and seen) in recordings of Woodstock making the stage announcements, including requests to \"stay off the towers\" and the warning about the \"brown acid\".\n\nFour months after Woodstock, Monck and Lang planned the Altamont Free Concert for the Rolling Stones, which also had to move from the original planned location, but this time with unfortunate results. Members of the Hells Angels motorcycle club were hired to provide security for the concert with terrible results. Monck confronted a member of the Angels stealing a large custom carpet that was part of the Rolling Stones stage set and lost teeth being hit in the mouth with a pool cue. He later tracked down the person and managed to trade the carpet for a case of brandy.\n\nMonck invented an innovative method of stage lighting for the 1972 tour. Instead of raising 3,000 pounds of lamps to the trusses, Monck installed a 40' x 8' array of Mylar mirrors. A row of spotlights sitting on the floor behind the stage bounced light off the mirrors onto the stage.\n\nIn 1974, Monck was the host of \"Speakeasy\", a short-lived rock and roll talk show that featured mostly chat and some live performances by such acts as Tom Waits, Frank Zappa and Emerson, Lake and Palmer. Monck's persona was well-known enough to be parodied as \"Chick Monk\" on SCTV by Tony Rosato as a marriage councilor employing strobe lights and a fog machine.\n\nAlso in 1974, he provided production services for the Muhammad Ali/George Foreman boxing match The Rumble in the Jungle, and the associated three-day music festival Zaire 74, which featured performances by James Brown, Celia Cruz and the Fania All-Stars, B.B. King, Miriam Makeba, The Spinners, Bill Withers, and Manu Dibango. Monck's work can be seen in the films \"Soul Power\" and \"When We Were Kings\".\n\nHe was the lighting designer for the Opening and Closing Ceremonies of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, as well as consulting on the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney.\n\nIn 2003, Monck received the Parnelli Award for Lifetime Achievement in the concert touring industry. \n\nAs of 2011, Monck resides in the Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy, Australia concentrating on corporate and retail lighting.\n\nIn 2011, he served as the Director of Production of the One Great Night On Earth Festival, planned for December 1, 2012. This event was intended to raise funds to help Australians in regions devastated by natural disasters like the Black Saturday bushfires, flooding and drought.\n\n"}

She began her career in farce comedy in the early 1890s and was such a hit singing the songs interpolated into plot that she quickly won fame, singing ragtime and dialect songs as a single. When she performed with the James and Bonnie Thornton troop, he coined her, \"The Southern Singer\".\n\nShe married \"Mose\" Gumble, head of Remick Music Publishing in New York, in 1904, but divorced him in 1914. Gumble was a well known songwriter along with his brother, Albert, but is remembered today as the man who gave George Gershwin his first job plugging songs at Remick. According to the 1900 census, this well known marriage was preceded by a marriage to William A. Sims who served briefly as her manager. According to the \"New York Clipper\" she was granted a divorce from John Blanchard in early 1904. This was followed by her marriage to Gumble.\n\nRecent research into Pike County, Ohio census records indicate that Clarice's mother's name was Mary Vance, solving the riddle of her stage name. Her middle name was actually \"Etta\" not Ella. This was confirmed by Sterling Morris after obtaining a copy of the original notice in \"Variety\" of her marriage to Gumble in 1904. \"The New York Times\" archives reveal that Vance later married Phelps Decker, a screen scenario writer and for a short time, manager in the New York offices of Universal Pictures. His services were terminated in early 1928 and discovered by his wife, \"former vaudeville actress Clarice Vance\" to have asphyxiated himself on February 5, 1928 in their apartment at 35 East 15th St. Manhattan, New York. He was 16 years her junior.\n\nVance was known as a \"coon singer\", singing popular Negro dialect songs of the day. She was a handsome woman, slightly over 6' tall and could project over a 26-piece orchestra when she sang on the stage. She shared the bill with the leading headliners of the day and her impish face appears on dozens of sheet music covers from 1897 to 1914. Her picture appeared in \"Vanity Fair\" at one point. In 1910 she starred in a short-lived but lavish Broadway musical, \"A Skylark\". She played at least three extended engagements in London, the most successful being a 26-week appearance at the London Palace in 1909.\n\nHer records exhibit a rare, radiant and very droll wit. She recorded for Edison Records in 1905 (two selections) and from 1906 to 1909 for Victor. Her most popular song was \"Mariar\", co-written by her husband; she recorded three versions of it.\n\nVance's life after 1923 is shrouded in mystery. In the early 1920s she appeared briefly in movies in character parts and slid into total oblivion, but according to the 1935 California voters registration she was living in San Francisco, listing her profession as 'dramatic coach' and residing at 1045 Bush Street.\n\nFrom 1944 to 1951, the comedian lived in a rooming house at 1535 Pine Street in San Francisco. From 1951 until her death in 1961 she was a patient at Napa State Mental Hospital in Napa, California. She died there, aged 91, knowing only her name and that she was \"an actress\".\n\n"}

As with the original \"Dead Trigger\", \"Dead Trigger 2\" is a single-player zombie-themed shooter. Nvidia showcased \"Dead Trigger 2\" as the first tech demo for their upcoming Tegra 4 mobile system-on-a-chip; Slide to Play and Android Police compared the graphical quality to the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.\n\n\"Dead Trigger 2\" utilizes the Unity game engine. It was released as a free-to-play game; microtransactions are included in the final product, but the developers had tested the game without in-app purchases to make sure the core gameplay works without them.\n\n\"Dead Trigger 2\" is a zombie-apocalypse-themed first-person shooter with survival horror and action role-playing elements, currently available on iOS, Android and recently on Windows Phone 8.1 mobile devices. Running on the Unity game engine, the game features a progression system, numerous environments, unlockable and upgradable weapons, and various story-based and quick-play mission types.\n\n\"Dead Trigger 2\" is a free-movement shooter; rather than the on-rails gameplay typical of mobile zombie shooters, the player controls the character's movement like a typical console or PC FPS. The game features two dramatically different control paradigms; with the default controls, the player merely aims at zombies - his or her weapons will attack automatically when a zombie is underneath the crosshair. The advanced control scheme functions like the first game - the player presses a button to fire the weapon, and an additional button lets the player aim down the weapon's sights for increased accuracy.\n\nGameplay typically revolves around completing objectives while killing zombies (occasionally killing zombies is the only objective). The player has a limited amount of health that is refreshed at the start of each mission. The player loses health when hit by zombies or by certain environmental hazards (i.e. radiation). The player can regain health by taking healing pills or getting a health power up from a special zombie.\n\nEnemies come in two flavors, standard zombies and special zombies. Standard zombies often plod along at a slow pace and attack with their arms, but some may sprint or carry melee weapons for increased damage. Special zombies have distinct appearances and unique traits; they are deadlier and tougher to kill, but drop blueprints or large amounts of cash (and sometimes health) when killed.\n\nIn addition to carrying two primary weapons, the player also carries a melee weapon and up to three types of consumable items. Consumables include health pills, grenades, exploding chickens and others.\n\n\"Dead Trigger 2\" received positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator website Metacritic provides a score of 77 out of 100 based on 12 critics.\n\nThere has been controversy of what players are calling \"pay to win\" with regards to game difficulty scaling steeply and slowing progress to a crawl unless the player pays real money for in game perks and items.\n"}

His godfather was Diether Posser, a lawyer, SPD politician and erstwhile Minister for Justice and Finance for North Rhine-Westphalia. Krebs gained his first experience in the theatre at school at the Humboldt \"Gymnasium\" in Essen. He took acting lessons at the renowned \"Folkwangschule\" school of performing arts in the Ruhrgebiet and took on his first role at the theatre in Oberhausen, followed by some small film roles. Of these, his most noteworthy appearance was in the film \"Zoff\" (1971) in which he played alongside well-known actors such as Jürgen Prochnow and Claus Theo Gärtner.\n\nFrom 1973, Krebs became famous for his role as \"Michael Graf\" in the legendary comedy series \"Ein Herz und eine Seele\", the German version of \"Till Death Us Do Part\". Krebs played the same role as Tony Booth's Mike, the left-wing son-in-law of Alfred Tetzlaff (Alf Garnett), played by Heinz Schubert. In 1974, however, he left the series due to differences with the producers WDR.\n\nIn the time that followed, Krebs made many television appearances, both in light entertainment and in more sophisticated series. In 1975, Peter Zadek chose him to play in \"Eiszeit\" with Heinz Bennent; in 1980 he played a main role in \"Die Judenbuche\" based on the story by Annette von Droste-Hülshoff.\n\nIn 1978, Krebs turned to crime series: for eight years, from 1978 to 1986, he played \"Dieter Herrle\", the miserable chief detective in the series \"SOKO 5113\". He made several guest appearances in the classic detective series \"Tatort\", as well as in the famous \"Polizeiruf 110\" and \"Der Alte\".\n\nKrebs achieved more success as a cabaret artist and comedian: in 1981, he made regular appearances on \"\" with Rudi Carrell, alongside Beatrice Richter and Klaus Havenstein. This poked fun at the main news programme, the \"Tagesschau\", and caused a good deal of uproar. Krebs left his series, again because of disagreements with the producer (ARD).\n\nFrom 1985 to 1987 Krebs achieved cult status with his comedy series \"\" in which he took on a wide range of different roles, accompanied at first by Beatrice Richter and then by Iris Berben. The series also became popular in other countries, such as Belgium. This series, followed by \"Knastmusik\" (1990) and \"Lauter nette Nachbarn\" (also 1990) built up Krebs's reputation as a comedian.\n\nIn the years that followed, Diether Krebs acted in roles of varying quality. In 1986 he played the hairdresser \"Hupsi\" in Helmut Dietl's successful series \"Kir Royal – Aus dem Leben eines Klatschreporters\"; in 1993 he took on a role in the catastrophe film \"Möbius\" by Matti Geschonneck. In 1991 he acted as a long-distance driver in the comedy \"Go Trabi Go\" by Peter Timm. That same year, he entered the German music charts: for a while he became famous as \"Martin\", a naive tree-hugger in a hand-knitted Fair Isle jumper with straggly hair and prominent teeth. He also played this character on stage.\n\nKrebs also worked as a television presenter, for example hosting the New Year Gala on MDR from 1996 and the \"Goldene Henne\" media award ceremony in 1999, also on MDR.\n\nThe last years of Diether Krebs's life were marked by his dwindling success and serious illness. In 1993, the RTL show \"R.O.S.T. - Die Diether Krebs-Show\", which also starred Hugo Egon Balder, was cancelled after thirteen episodes. The Sat.1 comedy series \"Der Dicke und der Belgier\" with the Flemish comedian Carry Goossens was also cancelled in 1998 due to low viewing figures.\n\nKrebs was a strong smoker and by then he was suffering from lung cancer. Nonetheless, at this time, he developed a new character which he played on stage: \"Herr Krups\", a funny sales rep with horn-rimmed glasses and wonky teeth. In 1998 he set off on a tour, starting in Berlin, with a routine including his own version of the Ruhrgebiet's ode to Currywurst. The text of this song which Herbert Grönemeyer made famous was written by Krebs.\n\nIn 1999, Diether Krebs played his last role in the Ruhrgebiet-based action comedy film \"Bang Boom Bang\". Playing slimeball shipping agent Werner Kampmann he appeared alongside Ralf Richter and others in this film directed by . Some film critics acclaimed this as Krebs's best ever part.

{"id": "24197817", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24197817", "title": "Gelotophobia", "text": "Gelotophobia\n\nGelotophobia is a fear of being laughed at, a type of social phobia. While most people do not like being laughed at, there is a sub-group of people that exceedingly fear it, and without obvious reasons, they relate laughter they hear to be directed at themselves. Since 2008, this phenomenon has attracted attention from scholars in psychology, sociology, and psychiatry, and has been studied intensively.\n\nIn his clinical observations, found that some of his patients seemed to be primarily worried about being laughed at. They tended to scan their environment for signs of laughter and ridicule. Furthermore, they reported that they had the impression of being ridiculous themselves. Additionally, Titze observed a specific movement pattern among them when they thought they were being laughed at—awkward, wooden movements that resembled those of wooden puppets. He described this state as \"Pinocchio-syndrome\". \n\nTwo other behaviours related to laughter are gelotophilia, the joy of being laughed at, and katagelasticism, the joy of laughing at others.\n\nFrom the clinical observations a model of the causes and consequences of gelotophobia was drawn up so that the condition could be studied scientifically. The model claims that gelotophobia can be caused by any one of three things at different stages of development: \n\nThe putative causes of gelotophobia:\n\nThe consequences of gelotophobia:\nLater this model was revised and expanded.\n\nHere is a quick checklist of gelotophobic behaviours which suggest that people are gelotophobic:\n\nAnyone who displays or experiences at least half of these characteristics may be gelotophobic. Since laughter is used as an integral part of communication and how people form and maintain relationships, it is natural to see how those who tend to be gelotophobic will find that their social interactions are seriously affected.\n\nUsually laughter is contagious and leads to positive emotions such as exhilaration and joy, yet no one likes to be laughed at or made fun of. Most people dislike being laughed at to some degree and gelotophobia can range from having no fear at all, to borderline, to pronounced or extreme gelotophobia.\n\nThere is a fifteen-item questionnaire for the subjective assessment of gelotophobia, e.g. the GELOPH<15>. This questionnaire has been used to show that gelotophobia exists, to varying degrees, in a normal population. It has been found on every continent and has, so far, had samples taken from 72 countries and the GELOPH<15> has been translated into over 42 different languages. \n\nDifferent countries vary in the number of people within the population, who are gelotophobes. The sociologist Christie Davies predicts a higher prevalence of gelotophobia in hierarchically organized societies where the main means of social control is shame.\n\nResearch into gelotophobia using the GELOPH scales shows that empirically, the condition exists outside of people who seek therapy due to experiencing a problematic fear of being laughed at. In the first studies, gelotophobes were distinguished from other people with shame-based problems and non-shame based neurotics and samples of a normal population. Basically, this means that even though gelotophobia shares similar problems, high scores were also found for these criteria in individuals with Asperger's syndrome and Cluster A personality disorders.\n\nThe fear of being laughed at has also been studied among children and adolescents using modifications of these diagnostic instruments\n\nAlthough at face value the emotions relating to gelotophobia would be predominantly fear, there is a distinct interplay with three dominant emotions: low levels of joy, high levels of fear, and high levels of shame. More importantly, where shame in a typical week exceeds joy, gelotophobia is more likely to develop. Gelotophobes say that they are bad at regulating their emotions, and they more easily pick up the negative moods of other people. They also suppress expression of their emotions and do not share their feelings readily with others.\n\nGelotophobes do not have the ability to understand the difference between playful forms of humorous interactions such as teasing, and crueller forms such as ridicule. This means that even if someone is trying to be friendly and playful, a gelotophobe will feel apprehensive and mistake the interaction for ridicule. It can also mean that people may feel they are being bullied when in fact they are not. \n\nGelotophobes are often located in both the Eysenck PEN and the Big Five models of personality. Gelotophobia correlates highly with introversion and neuroticism, and on older P-scales, gelotophobes score higher in psychoticism. The dimensional assessment of personality pathology, a DSM personality disorder instrument, showed that those with a fear of being laughed at tend to be socially avoidant and submissive, as well as having identity problems. Social withdrawal and suspiciousness most frequently predicted gelotophobia.\n\nPaul Lewis (Boston College, US) speculated whether political gelotophobia might affect elections in the US (\"The twin fears of being effectively mocked or ineffective in mocking others [too harsh, blunt, tasteless] led candidates to aggressive and proactive strategies [going on TV to show they can take a joke, be funny—anything to avoid being rendered pathetically ridiculous or inappropriately derisive]\") [p. 42, conference abstract from the 2009 conference of the International Society for Humor Studies ISHS in Long Beach, California]; Sociologist Christie Davies, who is also president of the ISHS, comments satirically on the results of recent elections in the UK. He noticed that losers in those elections were frequently bald—\"To be bald is to suffer from gelotophobia, to fear being laughed at; to fear being laughed at is to fear disorder; to fear disorder is to embrace absolutism\".\n\nA number of tests show that gelotophobes often underestimate their own potential and achievements. Gelotophobes tend to see themselves as less virtuous than people who know them. Similarly, in an intelligence study, gelotophobes consistently underestimated their intellectual performance by as much as 6 IQ points. Gelotophobes have a different experience of laughter: it does not lift their mood or make them more cheerful. They personally characterise their own humour as being inept, yet once again, tests show that they are no different from other people at making witty remarks and humour.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "54285124", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54285124", "title": "Grapevine radio", "text": "Grapevine radio\n\nGrapevine radio refers to the transmission infrastructures, used for distributing audio programs, which were built to serve a small number of rural upstate South Carolina communities from the early 1930s to the middle 1940s. Despite their name, these systems did not employ radio transmitters, but were actually a type of \"telephone newspaper\", because the programs were sent telephonically over wires strung to subscribing homes.\n\nThe equipment used to distribute programming over a facility's wire network was located at a central site, for example a general store's back room. Programs normally consisted of retransmissions of radio stations, however, some programming was locally produced, originating from a studio at the distribution site or relayed from a local church or other gathering place. The locally produced programs included announcements and emergency messages, commercials and live performances. The transmissions were made daily, generally starting around 6 a.m. and running until 10:00 p.m. or midnight.\n\nThe grapevine systems soon became unneeded, because they primarily served homes that did not have electricity. Once a community received electric service the local grapevine system would soon close down, as the subscribers switched to radio receivers that could receive a wide selection of programs at no cost, instead of the single program and monthly fees characteristic of the grapevine systems.\nInformation about the grapevine installations (also called \"speakerline\") is limited, because of their brief history and the fact that they do not appear to have been established outside a small region of South Carolina. Unlike radio stations, they did not require government approval to operate. Their existence was also dependent on an unusual and short-lived economic and technical environment, as they required a central distribution site that had access to electricity, plus a surrounding community of prospective subscribers that did not have electric service.\n\nThroughout the 1930s large parts of the United States, including most farms, did not have electricity. Although organized radio broadcasting had begun in the early 1920s, in rural upstate South Carolina there were no nearby radio stations strong enough to be picked up by battery-less crystal radio receivers, and although battery-powered sets existed, without electrical service there was no convenient way to recharge the batteries. The economic struggles caused by the Great Depression meant that many people could not even afford a newspaper subscription. Thus, there was a lack of entertainment and a strong sense of isolation in the region. As one person remembered, connecting to the grapevine service meant that \"we had 'arrived' and were at last in touch with the outside world\".\n\nThe rural electrification projects of the 1930s and 1940s eventually eliminated potential customers, making the grapevine systems no longer needed as their former customers switched to listening to radio stations.\n\nThe first grapevine system was begun in the winter of 1930-1931 by a high school student, Gordon F. Rogers, who lived on farm in central Greenville county near Mauldin, South Carolina. The Rogers farm, unlike most of its neighbors, had electrical service. Gordon Rogers had shown an early aptitude for engineering, developing a clock that automatically turned on the farm's chicken coup lights at 3:00 a.m., as well as an automated system for watering the chickens. Rogers also had an early interest in radio. Dissatisfied with a battery operated set, he successfully reconditioned a vacuum tube receiver that ran on AC electrical power. At this point he decided to also run a single-wire connection with a ground return from his receiver to a loudspeaker at the home of a neighbor who didn't have electricity. With this setup, whenever Rogers' radio was on the neighbor also heard what was being received. Word of this innovation quickly spread, and within a month lines had been run to seven nearby homes.\n\nRogers' system was essentially sending one-way telephone signals over his own wires, but he had to use voltages far higher than that used by standard telephone lines, because he was sending not only audio but also the power needed to operate what would become hundreds of loudspeakers. His initial setup output was 2.5 watts, but as the system expanded this was increased in steps over time to 350-400 watts. This occasionally led to issues when his wires ran too close to standard telephone lines, which sometimes picked up the strong grapevine transmissions. Special steps had to be taken to eliminate interference with the telephone company's service.\n\nSubscribers had to provide the wire, poles (often actually fence posts) and speakers needed to connect to the main system lines. Unskilled attempts by individuals to tap into the lines without paying generally caused service disruptions for nearby customers, which made it possible to locate and remove the improper connections. Although at first the service was provided for free, as the number of participants grew Rogers began charging a monthly 10 cent fee. This charge was later raised to 25 cents, and at times a $1 surcharge was applied to finance replacement of sections of the transmission lines that needed to be upgraded from the original iron wire to higher quality materials. The system became profitable enough to finance Rogers' attendance at Clemson College. In 1933, at the time of his college enrollment, the system had 5 miles (8 kilometers) of lines and 15 subscribers. Increasing demand, spurred by finding a source of affordable speakers ($2.85 each), expanded the number of connections to more than 200 within the next four months, and by June 1934 the transmission lines spanned 15 miles (24 kilometers). By around 1935, there were 600 homes connected to the grapevine service, including sites in Spartanburg and Laurens counties, located up to 24 miles (38 kilometers) distant from the Rogers farm distribution site. The infrastructure had also grown to 400 miles (645 kilometers) of transmission lines.\n\nProgramming was provided for about 12 hours each day. Rogers introduced a \"local talent\" program that featured live performances. A record player provided music for times when static made it difficult to receive the radio rebroadcasts that provided most of the schedule. Provisions were also made to make local announcements. In addition, a carrier current link from the system based at Ware Place allowed programming originating at that location to be picked up and concurrently transmitted by the Mauldin system. \n\nIn the spring of 1936, Rogers, now a junior at Clemson, presented a paper, \"Bringing Radio to the Rural Home\", at a regional conference of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, which provided technical information about his innovation. His review won first place in its category. The Mauldin-based system remained in operation until the area received electrical service, shutting down around 1939.\n\nGordon Rogers' original system served northern Greenville county. A second wire network, originating from a small store in Ware Place, South Carolina, was later established which provided an extensive program service for the southern part of the county. The store's owners, J. R. Chandler, Jr. and his cousin J. E. Chandler, became familiar with the Mauldin facility, and around 1934 arranged for Gordon Rogers and Sherman Fox to install similar distribution equipment at their store. The Chandlers became active participants operating the system and supplying local programming. A studio, which included a piano and a pulpit, was built in the rear of the store. There was also a connection to the local school.\n\nSubscribers were initially charged 25 cents a month, which was later increased to 35 cents. Individual homes had to maintain their local wire connections, and purchase their own speakers: $3 to $5 for a small one, and $7 to $8 for a large one. An unusual additional benefit resulted from the discovery that, after the grapevine programming ended for the night, individual subscribers could hear each other if they spoke loudly into their speakers, resulting in a form of party-line communication. At its peak over 500 homes were connected. The system continued to run during World War II in order to supply war news, after which it was shut down.\n\nThis installation helped launch the political career of Robert C. Wasson, who went on to become the state's Tax Chairman. The Wasson family ran a small store in Hickory Tavern, South Carolina, located in southwest Laurens county. The needed equipment was purchased in March 1936 and the service was immediately popular. Later that year, when Robert Wasson announced what would be a successful candidacy for the state House of Representatives, a newspaper report noted that the store he ran \"is known as Wasson Brothers store, mill, and grapevine radio system serving 200 rural homes\".\n\nCustomers were charged 25 cents per month, and paid $6.50 for a small speaker or $10.50 for a large one — this fee included installation. Robert Wasson's mother, Effie Owens Wasson, handled most of the operational duties, and at its peak about 500 houses within a 12 mile (19 kilometer) radius were connected. Regular news reports and live entertainment made up an important part of the daily schedule. Advertising over the facility was credited with helping to establish the Eaddy-Blakes corner drug store in Laurens, and a former pharmacy employee later wrote that \"were Dr. Eaddy still living I'm sure he would attribute the biggest thing to his success in the drug business was this advertising... It cost him about a dollar a week and he had every person from the area as a regular customer in a short time\". \n\nRobert Wasson served seven terms in the South Carolina legislature. One of his political objectives was getting electrical service for his community, and after the rural electrification program reached his district the grapevine service ceased operations in 1939.\n\nSaylors Crossroads, South Carolina is a small community located in southeastern Anderson county. This system was inspired by the existence of the Ware Place operations, and was established by Charles Murdock in 1937. The Murdock family operated a general store, and a small studio was constructed in a building behind the store. The grapevine service was run by Selma Saylors, who was the twin sister of Charles Murdock's wife. Programming primarily consisted of relaying the transmissions of a local radio station, WAIM in Anderson. WAIM signed off at 9 p.m. each evening, and at that point the program source was switched to picking up \"a station in Cincinnati\" (presumably WLW). Local programming included the Sunday morning church services from Mount Bethel Baptist Church, carried from 1938 to 1940. \n\nSubscribers paid 45 cents a month, and chose between three speaker sizes: a smaller square-shaped speaker for $7.50, a larger square-shaped speaker for $9.50, and a heart-shaped speaker for $12.50. The speaker purchases financed the installation of the wire connection to the main transmission lines. At its peak, the service had 500 subscribers. This system ended operations in 1941, after the community received electric service.\nThis system was operated by Carl Ellison, who owned a general store located at Williamston, South Carolina in east central Anderson county. It remained in operation for \"seven or eight years\", starting sometime in the 1930s and continuing through at least 1940. It had also been initially inspired by the Ware Place operations.\n\nThe Ellisons lived in a house behind the general store, and they converted their living room to serve as a studio for locally produced programming. The service cost 50 cents a month, and reached 700 subscribers. Like the Ware Place system, after the grapevine programming ended for the night individuals could be heard by other subscribers by speaking loudly into their speakers. The system featured ministers from Greenville who preached over the system on Friday nights. It also carried the Sunday services from the First Baptist Church in Williamston.\n\nGordon Rogers estimated that a total of ten to twelve grapevine operations were eventually installed, all located in South Carolina. Additional locations reportedly included Walhalla (located in the center of South Carolina's easternmost county, Oconee), another \"near Mauldin\", and one \"across the Savannah river from Augusta, Georgia\".\n\n"}

In August 2012 JK & Joel confirmed they had split after years of limited success.\n\nThe two first worked together at Viking FM in Kingston upon Hull from 1996 when Ross joined the station from Yorkshire Coast Radio to present the overnight programme. King was hosting the afternoon show at the time. In 1998 King took over the breakfast show and Ross, who was on the afternoon programme, later began reading the travel bulletins on the show, as a punishment for turning up late. Despite not getting along at first (King heatbutted Ross, breaking his nose), eventually the two were paired up as co-hosts and together they won two Gold Sony Radio Academy Awards for 'Breakfast Show Of The Year' and a Silver for 'Entertainment Show'.\n\nThey left Viking FM to join Key 103 in Manchester in 2000, taking over from Mike Toolan as hosts of the breakfast show where they won a further 3 Sony radio awards, Gold for UK best breakfast show, Silver for UK's best presenters and Bronze for the competition award. Joel was sacked from Key 103 after turning up three hours late for work, agreeing to join BBC Radio 1 towards the end of 2003. JK saw out the remainder of his contract with Key 103, presenting the breakfast show alone before joining Radio 1 in 2004. However, Joel came back to present their final breakfast show together.\n\nThey went on to join BBC Radio 1 in Spring of 2004. They initially hosted a weekend afternoon programme before moving to the Radio 1 Chart show in March 2005. They also presented the early breakfast show every Monday - Thursday from 4am to 7am replacing Nemone Metaxas who left to join BBC Radio 6 Music. They did not host the early breakfast show on a Friday, to compensate for their Sunday chart show and TV commitments, being replaced by Fearne Cotton and Reggie Yates of \"Top of the Pops\" fame. They were let go from Radio One in late 2007, during a large presenter shake-up at the station.\n\nThey quickly joined the national radio station Virgin Radio to present their 10am1pm slot at weekends, but left the station in the later part of 2008 following the radio stations take over and subsequent rebranding as Absolute Radio.\n\nJK and Joel made a return to radio in early 2009, covering shows on Manchester's Key 103 and Leeds' Radio Aire. In July 2009, it was announced that the duo would permanently take over the breakfast show from Simon Logan on Radio Aire. The pair signed a contract for two years. They made their debut on 20 July 2009 and left the station on 20 July 2011.\n\nThey also presented \"JK and Joel's Saturday Night Thing\" on some Bauer Place stations until July 2011.\n\nIn August 2011, JK and Joel signed to the Global Group, working on separate stations including Heart and Capital.\n\nIn February 2007 the two men became presenters of the award-winning CBBC show \"Hider in the House\", where a celebrity has to be hidden in a house, without one parent finding out. The show ran for 4 series and was the channel's most watched show.\n\nAlso in February 2007, JK and Joel appeared on Virgin Media TV channel 999, 'Virgin iD' introducing the new features of the cable service.\n\nOn 7 July 2007, JK and Joel launched on ITV with their new show music quiz show \"Sing It Back\".\n\nBetween 2008 and 2009, the pair presented series 2 and 3 of \"Escape from Scorpion Island\" on ABC in Australia and the BBC in the United Kingdom.\n\nThey hosted the first series of \"My Camp Rock\" on the Disney Channel in the UK and Ireland in 2009.\n\nTheir TV show \"Remote Control Star\" launched on BBC in early 2011.\n\nFrom November 2011, the duo started presenting for Flirt!TV on Tour - a weekly mini series following different nights out at Universities around the country.\n\nThey have also hosted programmes for BBC Three, Pure Soap, and Men & Motors. JK and Joel have presented: \"\"Playboyz\", a fast-moving gadget series for Granada Men and Motors and \"Motor Maniacs\", a series dedicated to men obsessed with bikes and cars.\n\nThey have been the hosts of \"Pure Soap\"\" on BBC Three, a daily 30-minute live show looking at all things to do with soap operas.\n\nRoss distinguished himself by winning Channel 5's 2005 \"Britain's Worst Celebrity Driver\" competition on 25 September 2005, despite the best efforts of JK, his co-driver.\n\nIn January 2006, the duo won a \"celebrity pairings\" edition of \"The Weakest Link\", raising £12,900 for the Five Stars Scanner Appeal, a children's charity they had supported while working in Manchester.\n\nIn March 2006 JK took part in Channel 4's final series of The Games coming in third place for the men.\n\nOn 12 June 2012, the double act appeared on CBBC's 'Hacker Time', as guests.\n\nIn 2010 JK and Joel presented Party in the Park Leeds in front of 70,000 people and live on Radio Aire.\n"}

The sea snake) is a traditional singing game originating in Mexico. It is a popular children's game in Mexico and Latin America, and also in Spain where it is known as \"pasemisí\".\n\nChildren form a line holding each other's waist or clothing, and two other children raise their arms together to form an arch. Of the two children forming the arch, one of them is \"Melón\" (Honeydew or Cantaloupe) the other is \"Sandía.\" (Watermelon)\n\nThe children begin to sing the song, as the \"snake\" begins to run (without separating) passing repeatedly under the arch. The lyrics of the song are such that the last of the word of each stanza can be repeated at will, and the children might decide to bring the arch down to \"capture\" someone. The fun in the game is not knowing when the arch will fall, \"capturing\" one of the children.\n\nThe children who form the arch then ask: \"With whom will you stay? Melón or Sandía?\" The captured child must then queue up next to the \"fruit\" of his choice, thereby forming another arch through which the line must pass.\n\nOnce all children that formed the original line are divided between \"melón\" and \"sandía\", the resulting queues must compete in a game of tug of war.\n\nThe words to the song are:\nSpanish:<br>\n\"A la víbora, víbora\nde la mar, de la mar\npor aquí pueden pasar.\nLos de adelante corren mucho\ny los de atrás se quedarán\ntras, tras, tras, tras.\n\nUna mexicana que fruta vendía\nciruela, chabacano, melón o sandía.\nVerbena, verbena, jardín de matatena.\nVerbena, verbena, la virgen de la cueva.\nCampanita de oro déjame pasar,\nCon todos mis hijos menos el de atrás\nTras, tras, tras, tras.\nSerá melón, será sandía\nserá la vieja del otro día\ndía, día, día, día.\n\nEl puente está quebrado,\nque lo manden componer\nCon cáscaras de huevo\ny pedazos de oropel\npel, pel, pel, pel.\"\nEnglish Translation:<br>\n\" \"To the snake, the snake\"<br>\n\" Of the sea, of the sea\"<br>\n\" All of you can pass through here,\"<br>\n\" Those up front run quickly\"<br>\n\" Those at back are left behind\"<br>\n\" 'hind, 'hind, 'hind, 'hind.\"\n\n\" One Mexican (woman), who sold fruits\"<br>\n\" Plums, apricots, cantaloupes or watermelons\"<br>\n\" Verbena, verbena, garden of jacks\"<br>\n\" Verbena, verbena, the virgin of the cave\"<br>\n\" Little golden bell, let me pass\"<br>\n\" With all my children, except the one that's last\"<br>\n\" Last, last, last, last.\"<br>\n\" Will it be cantaloupe? Will it be watermelon?\"<br>\n\" Will it be the old lady we saw the other day?\"<br>\n\" Day, day, day, day.\"\n\n\" The bridge is broken\"<br>\n\" Send someone to have it fixed\"<br>\n\" With broken bits of eggshells\"<br>\n\" And pieces of aluminum foil\"<br>\n\" Foil, foil, foil, foil\".\"\n\nIn Mexico, it has become quite popular to play this game at weddings. In this variation, single men and women are often divided, the groom and bride standing on chairs to form the arch under which everyone passes. (The groom often uses the veil or train of the bride's dress). In this case, the song is not sung, and the rhythm of music is followed, which gets faster and faster, the participants struggling to keep the \"snake\" together, while running through tables, chairs and the couple. At the end of the game, depending on the sex of the participants, the bride throws from her chair the wedding bouquet, and the groom the garter. The bouquet used to be a symbol of happiness, but in today's practice the single woman who catches the bouquet is believed to be the next to marry. Same goes to the single man who catches the garter. In some instances, it is said that they will marry each other.\n\nIn Spain the game is known as \"pasemisí\". \n\nSimilar games such as these exist in other traditions as well. This game can be likened to \"London Bridge is Falling Down\" in English-speaking countries, and a similar game in Japan exists, played to a song called Toryanse.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "254364", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=254364", "title": "Mathematical fallacy", "text": "Mathematical fallacy\n\nIn mathematics, certain kinds of mistaken proof are often exhibited, and sometimes collected, as illustrations of a concept of mathematical fallacy. There is a distinction between a simple \"mistake\" and a \"mathematical fallacy\" in a proof: a mistake in a proof leads to an invalid proof just in the same way, but in the best-known examples of mathematical fallacies, there is some concealment in the presentation of the proof. For example, the reason validity fails may be a division by zero that is hidden by algebraic notation. There is a certain quality of the mathematical fallacy: as typically presented, it leads not only to an absurd result, but does so in a crafty or clever way. Therefore, these fallacies, for pedagogic reasons, usually take the form of spurious proofs of obvious contradictions. Although the proofs are flawed, the errors, usually by design, are comparatively subtle, or designed to show that certain steps are conditional, and are not applicable in the cases that are the exceptions to the rules.\n\nThe traditional way of presenting a mathematical fallacy is to give an invalid step of deduction mixed in with valid steps, so that the meaning of fallacy is here slightly different from the logical fallacy. The latter applies normally to a form of argument that is not a genuine rule of logic, where the problematic mathematical step is typically a correct rule applied with a tacit wrong assumption. Beyond pedagogy, the resolution of a fallacy can lead to deeper insights into a subject (such as the introduction of Pasch's axiom of Euclidean geometry and the five colour theorem of graph theory). \"Pseudaria\", an ancient lost book of false proofs, is attributed to Euclid.\n\nMathematical fallacies exist in many branches of mathematics. In elementary algebra, typical examples may involve a step where division by zero is performed, where a root is incorrectly extracted or, more generally, where different values of a multiple valued function are equated. Well-known fallacies also exist in elementary Euclidean geometry and calculus.\n\nExamples exist of mathematically correct results derived by incorrect lines of reasoning. Such an argument, however true the conclusion, is mathematically invalid and is commonly known as a \"howler\". For example, the calculation (anomalous cancellation):\nAlthough the conclusion formula_2 is correct, there is a fallacious, invalid cancellation in the middle step. Another classical example of a howler is by simply substituting the scalar variables of the characteristic polynomial by the matrix.\n\nBogus proofs, calculations, or derivations constructed to produce a correct result in spite of incorrect logic or operations were termed \"howlers\" by Maxwell. Outside the field of mathematics the term \"howler\" has various meanings, generally less specific.\n\nThe division-by-zero fallacy has many variants. The following example uses division by zero to \"prove\" that formula_3, but can be modified to prove that any number equals any other number.\n\n\n\"Q.E.D.\"\n\nThe fallacy is in line 5: the progression from line 4 to line 5 involves division by \"a\" − \"b\", which is zero since \"a\" equals \"b\". Since division by zero is undefined, the argument is invalid.\n\nMany functions do not have a unique inverse. For instance, while squaring a number gives a unique value, there are two possible square roots of a positive number. The square root is multivalued. One value can be chosen by convention as the principal value; in the case of the square root the non-negative value is the principal value, but there is no guarantee that the square root given as the principal value of the square of a number will be equal to the original number; e.g. the principal square root of the square of −2 is 2.\n\nCalculus as the mathematical study of infinitesimal change and limits can lead to mathematical fallacies if the properties of integrals and differentials are ignored. For instance, a naive use of integration by parts can be used to give a false proof that 0 = 1. Letting formula_20 and formula_21, we may write:\n\nafter which the antiderivatives may be cancelled yielding 0 = 1. The problem is that antiderivatives are only defined up to a constant and shifting them by 1 or indeed any number is allowed. The error really comes to light when we introduce arbitrary integration limits \"a\" and \"b\".\n\nSince the difference between two values of a constant function vanishes, the same definite integral appears on both sides of the equation.\n\nFallacies involving disregarding the rules of elementary arithmetic through an incorrect manipulation of the radical.\n\nCare must be taken when taking the square root of both sides of an equality. Failing to do so results in a proof of\nProof:\n\nThe fallacy is in the second to last line, where the square root of both sides is taken: \"a\" = \"b\" only implies \"a\" = \"b\" if \"a\" and \"b\" have the same sign, which is not the case here. In this case it implies \"a\" = –\"b\" and should read 5-9/2 = -(4-9/2), which, by adding 9/2 on both sides, correctly reduces to 5 = 5.\n\nAs another example of the danger of taking the square root of both sides of an equation, consider the fundamental identity\nwhich holds as a consequence of the Pythagorean theorem. Then, by taking a square root,\nso that\nBut evaluating this when \"x\" = π implies\nor\nwhich is incorrect.\n\nThe error in each of these examples fundamentally lies in the fact that any equation of the form\nhas two solutions, provided \"a\" ≠ 0,\nand it is essential to check which of these solutions is relevant to the problem at hand. In the above fallacy, the square root that allowed the second equation to be deduced from the first is valid only when cos \"x\" is positive. In particular, when \"x\" is set to π, the second equation is rendered invalid.\n\nWhen both sides of an equation are squared, sometimes solutions are induced that were not present in the original equation.\n\nAn example of this kind of fallacy, is the following invalid proof that formula_41:\nWhen the square root was extracted, it was the \"negative\" root −2, rather than the \"positive\" root, that was relevant for the particular solution in the problem.\n\nInvalid proofs utilizing powers and roots are often of the following kind:\n\nThe fallacy is that the rule formula_47 is generally valid only if both \"x\" and \"y\" are positive (when dealing with real numbers), which is not the case here.\n\nAlternatively, imaginary roots are obfuscated in the following:\n\nThe error here lies in the last equality, where we are ignoring the other fourth roots of 1, which are −1, \"i\" and −\"i\" (where \"i\" is the imaginary unit). Since we have squared our figure and then taken roots, we cannot always assume that all the roots will be correct. So the correct fourth roots are \"i\" and −\"i\", which are the imaginary numbers defined to square to −1.\n\nWhen a number is raised to a complex power, the result is not uniquely defined (see Failure of power and logarithm identities). If this property is not recognized, then errors such as the following can result:\n\nThe error here is that the rule of multiplying exponents as when going to the third line does not apply unmodified with complex exponents, even if when putting both sides to the power only the principal value is chosen. When treated as multivalued functions, both sides produce the same set of values, being .\n\nMany mathematical fallacies in geometry arise from using in an additive equality involving oriented quantities (such adding vectors along a given line or adding oriented angles in the plane) a valid identity, but which fixes only the absolute value of (one of) these quantities. This quantity is then incorporated into the equation with the wrong orientation, so as to produce an absurd conclusion. This wrong orientation is usually suggested implicitly by supplying an imprecise diagram of the situation, where relative positions of points or lines are chosen in a way that is actually impossible under the hypotheses of the argument, but non-obviously so. Such a fallacy is easy to expose by drawing a precise picture of the situation, in which some relative positions will be different from those in the provided diagram. In order to avoid such fallacies, a correct geometric argument using addition or subtraction of distances or angles should always prove that quantities are being incorporated with their correct orientation.\n\nThe fallacy of the isosceles triangle, from , purports to show that every triangle is isosceles, meaning that two sides of the triangle are congruent. This fallacy has been attributed to Lewis Carroll.\n\nGiven a triangle △ABC, prove that AB = AC:\n\"Q.E.D.\"\n\nAs a corollary, one can show that all triangles are equilateral, by showing that AB = BC and AC = BC in the same way.\n\nThe error in the proof is the assumption in the diagram that the point O is \"inside\" the triangle. In fact, O always lies at the circumcircle of the △ABC (except for isosceles and equilateral triangles where AO and OD coincide). Furthermore, it can be shown that, if AB is longer than AC, then R will lie \"within\" AB, while Q will lie \"outside\" of AC (and vice versa). (Any diagram drawn with sufficiently accurate instruments will verify the above two facts.) Because of this, AB is still AR + RB, but AC is actually AQ − QC; and thus the lengths are not necessarily the same.\n\nThere exist several fallacious proofs by induction in which one of the components, basis case or inductive step, is incorrect. Intuitively, proofs by induction work by arguing that, if a statement is true in one case, it is true in the next case, and hence by repeatedly applying this it can be shown to be true for all cases. This \"proof\" shows that all horses are the same colour.\n\n\nThe fallacy in this proof arises in line 3. For N = 1, the two groups of horses have N − 1 = 0 horses in common, and thus are not necessarily the same colour as each other, so the group of N + 1 = 2 horses is not necessarily all of the same colour. The implication \"Every N horses are of the same colour, then N+1 horses are of the same colour\" works for any N greater than one, but fails to be true when N = 1. The basis case is correct, but the induction step has a fundamental flaw. If we were additionally given the fact that any two horses shared the same colour, we could correctly induct from the base case of N = 2.\n\n\n"}

His enormous repertoire, and his ability to come up with a joke on any subject, earned him the nickname The Human Joke Machine. He sometimes performed with a mock machine on his chest, hanging by a strap. He turned a hand crank and paper rolled out; he would then pretend to read the machine's joke, although actually the paper was blank.\n\nAmsterdam's reputation for humor preceded him. Hal Block tells of Amsterdam walking up Sixth Avenue in New York City and meeting an old friend. \"Where have you been?\" the friend asked. \"Sick,\" Amsterdam replied, \"I've been in bed with a cold.\" His friend looked at him and asked, \"What's so funny about that?\"\n\nDuring the 1930s, Amsterdam was a regular on \"The Al Pearce Show\" radio program, and by 1937 was the master of ceremonies on \"The Night Club of the Air\". Amsterdam also had a notable career as a songwriter, with his first popular success being \"Why Oh Why Did I Ever Leave Wyoming\".\n\nAmsterdam was credited as the lyricist on the 1945 Andrews Sisters hit \"Rum and Coca-Cola\". However, the original song was written and performed by Trinidadian calypso singer Lord Invader, and composed by Lionel Belasco. Amsterdam had altered some lyrics for the Andrews Sisters record, and was subsequently involved in a copyright suit over the song, which dragged on until 1948. In the end, Lord Invader was given a substantial royalty payment for having written the lyrics of original piece, while Amsterdam retained the credit (and the publishing rights) for his revised version of the lyric.\n\nIn the early 1940s, Amsterdam was a screenwriter, contributing dialogue for two East Side Kids films. He is listed as screenwriter for the 1943 film \"The Ghost and the Guest\" and 1944's \"Bowery Champs\".\n\nBy 1947, he was performing on three daily radio shows. Beginning in 1948, he appeared on the radio show \"Stop Me If You've Heard This One\". \"The Morey Amsterdam Show\" aired on CBS radio from July 10, 1948, to February 15, 1949. For three months, it was on both radio and television with different scripts for the same premise and cast. He also did a radio show called the \"Laugh and Swing Club\", broadcasting from the Filmart Theater on Vine Street in Hollywood, in the late 1940s and early 1950s.\n\n\"The Morey Amsterdam Show\" ran on CBS TV from December 1948 to March 1949 and on DuMont from April 1949 to October 1950. Among Morey's regular guests was song-and-dance man Art Carney. The cigarette girl was future author Jacqueline Susann, wife of the producer of the show, Irving Mansfield. Jazz musician Johnny Guarneri led the band.\n\nIn 1950, he briefly hosted the comedy-variety show \"Broadway Open House\", TV's first late-night entertainment show, on NBC. One of the pioneering TV creations of NBC president Pat Weaver, it demonstrated the potential for late-night programming and led to the later development of \"The Tonight Show\". The show was originally to be hosted by comic Don \"Creesh\" Hornsby (so nicknamed because he yelled \"Creesh\" often), but he died of polio two weeks before the premiere broadcast. Hornsby's replacements, hosting different nights each week, were Amsterdam (Monday and Wednesday) and the raucous Jerry Lester (Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays), the brother of character actor Buddy Lester. Amsterdam soon exited the show, leaving Lester the sole host.\n\nIn February 1952, Amsterdam made his dramatic TV debut on an episode of the DuMont Television Network series \"Not for Publication\".\n\nIn 1957, he appeared as \"Jack Connors\" in the third episode (\"The Three Pretenders\") of the syndicated television sitcom \"How to Marry a Millionaire\", with Barbara Eden and Merry Anders.\n\nIn 1958, he appeared as saloon manager Lucien Bellingham in an episode of the CBS western series \"Have Gun, Will Travel\" entitled \"The Moor's Revenge\". He later guest-starred on the CBS sitcom \"Pete and Gladys\", with Harry Morgan and Cara Williams.\n\nHis best-known role was as comedy writer Buddy Sorrell on \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\", a role suggested for him by his friend Rose Marie, who also appeared on the show.\n\nThe show's creator, Carl Reiner, based the character on his old friend Mel Brooks, with whom he worked on the writing staff of \"Your Show of Shows\". Like Amsterdam himself, Buddy had a ready quip for any situation, and one of the show's most popular running gags was his insult-laden feud with producer Mel Cooley (Richard Deacon). Buddy was also one of the rare overtly Jewish characters on TV in that era, with one episode revolving around his belated decision to have a Bar Mitzvah. Amsterdam also wrote lyrics for the show's theme song, which were never heard on the air, but have been performed by Dick Van Dyke in concert. Van Dyke sang those lyrics on the October 23, 2010 edition of the NPR show \"Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!\".\n\nAmsterdam was an occasional panelist on \"Match Game\" and the short-lived \"Can You Top This?\" (which he also executive produced) during the 1970s. He appeared as a small-time criminal in several episodes of the soap opera \"The Young and the Restless\" in the 1990s. Amsterdam and Rose Marie later appeared as panelists on \"The Hollywood Squares\" and guest-starred together in a February 1996 episode of the NBC sitcom \"Caroline in the City\" (his final TV appearance).\n\nIn 1958, Amsterdam appeared in the low-budget film \"Machine-Gun Kelly\" with Charles Bronson, and he did a notable dramatic turn in the 1960 noir classic \"Murder, Inc.\" as Catskill nightclub owner Walter Sage, the first victim (according to the film) of the newly minted Murder, Incorporated.\n\nAmsterdam played Cappy, owner of the local nightclub, in the \"Beach Party\" movies of the 1960s, which were produced by American International Pictures, of which he was vice president. He and Rose Marie also co-starred in the 1966 film, \"Don't Worry, We'll Think of a Title\", a comedy co-written and co-produced by Amsterdam. The film features Richard Deacon, their co-star on \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\", with cameos by the show's co-producer Danny Thomas and co-star Carl Reiner. His later roles included appearances in \"The Horse in the Gray Flannel Suit\" (1968), \"Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood\" (1976), \"When Nature Calls\" (1985) and \"Side by Side\" (1988).\n\nAmsterdam died of a heart attack at Cedars Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, California, on October 27, 1996, at the age of 87. He was survived by his wife Kay Patrick and their children, Gregory and Catherine. He was entombed at Forest Lawn - Hollywood Hills Cemetery in Los Angeles.\n\n\n"}

It is the Indian equivalent to the original American network and is owned by Viacom 18, a joint venture between Viacom and TV18. Nick India is available in four languages: Hindi, Tamil, Telugu and Kannada.\n\nNickelodeon India was launched on 16 October 1999 and was initially picked up by Zee TV. \n\nZee TV launched a Nickelodeon-branded programming block as part of a distribution deal between Viacom International and Zee Entertainment Enterprises. It was replaced by the Cartoon Network block in 2002.\n\nIn 2004 Viacom revamped Nickelodeon in India to increase its viewership, including branding it as Nick, local productions and starting Hindi feed.\n\nViacom signed a programming deal with Sun Network in 2007 according to which Nickelodeon shows will air on Chutti TV dubbed in Tamil and Telugu. This deal was later cancelled when Nickelodeon decided to add Tamil and Telugu language tracks to their own channel.\n\nOn June 25, 2010 Nick India rebranded using the current logo. It was the last major market to undergo this makeover.\n\nIn 2011, Viacom 18 launched a new channel called Sonic. Initially the channel was focused on action and adventure, before switching their focus to comedy in 2016. \n\nViacom 18 Motion Pictures distributed \"Keymon & Nani in Space Adventure\", a film based on the Nickelodeon India series \"Keymon Ache\" in 2012. Another theatrical film, \"\" from the \"Motu Patlu\" franchise was released in Hindi and Tamil on 14 October 2016.\n\nNick Jr. India was launched in late 2012 after being spun off from the main channel. TeenNick aired in the evenings before 1 February 2017, when it was discontinued.\n\nIn 2013 the first ever Kids Choice Awards was hosted in India.\n\nOn 5 December 2015, Viacom 18 launched Nickelodeon HD+, the first children's channel in high definition in India. It originates a different schedule than the main network, including previously unaired international programming such as \"The Legend of Korra\".\n\nIn 2016 Viacom 18 launched a Nick programming block named \"Nick Hour\" on their free-to-air channel Rishtey. The programming consists of shows like \"Motu Patlu\", \"Pakdam Pakdai\", \"The Jungle Book\", \"Go, Diego, Go!\", \"Keymon Ache\" and \"Chhoti Anandi\" (Colors series).\n\nNick India launched Kannada feed on 1 September 2018.\n\nIn the channel's first years of broadcasting it aired mostly original programmes from the US, like \"Rugrats\", \"Aaahh! Real Monsters\", \"As Told by Ginger\", \"Rocket Power\", \"The Wild Thornberrys\" and other animated shows such as \"\", \"Rocko's Modern Life\", \"The Angry Beavers\", \"CatDog\", \"Hey Arnold!\", \"The Fairly OddParents\" and \"Danny Phantom\". The network also aired live action shows, such as \"Kenan & Kel\", \"Drake & Josh\", \"Clarissa Explains It All\", \"Legends of the Hidden Temple\", Nick Bites and many more.\n\nAfter the success of international game shows Nick India produced two local game shows, \"Dum Dama Dum\" and \"Gilli Gilli Gappa\". They launched \"J Bole Toh Jadoo\", a spin-off series of 2003's \"Koi... Mil Gaya\". The series premiered on 14 November 2005 on Children's Day.\n\nIn 2006 Nick India started acquiring Japanese series such as \"Ninja Hattori\", \"Perman\" and \"Mighty Cat Masked Niyander\".\n\nNick started airing Colors's Mythological show \"Jai Shri Krishna\" in 2009. The show was re-edited and customised for children. They also acquired \"Little Krishna\", an animated series produced by BIG Animation India and The Indian Heritage Foundation in May 2009.\n\nNickelodeon India from 2011 started producing local animated programming and launched \"Keymon Ache\" and a theatrical movie based on the series. The local strategy became successful with \"Motu Patlu\" in 2012 and they later launched more local animated series like \"Pakdam Pakdai\" in 2013, \"Shiva\" in 2015, \"Gattu Battu\" in 2017 and \"\" in 2018. \n\nNickelodeon India for a long time has been giving less importance on American original series. Many of the animated shows have been neglected by the channel and even internationally popular shows like \"The Fairly OddParents\" haven't had a proper run on the channel. The probable cause of this is due to the channel's low ratings and failure to gain relevance with the children in its first years of broadcasting. Nick Jr. also wasn't in a good condition until 2012 when the dedicated channel launched and the new shows from Nick Jr. started airing. Nick India did not even broadcast live action series such as \"iCarly\" until several years later with the launch of the now-discontinued TeenNick block on Nick Jr. India. Nina Elavia Jaipuria, the head of Nickelodeon India says live action shows do not connect with the viewers as much as animated shows do, even with dubbing.\n\nIn August 2018, Nick HD+ changed its schedule with a larger focus on original Nickelodeon shows from the US, while the standard-definition Nick channel continues to only show locally made series for the masses.\n"}

It premiered on February 2, 2017 on Viceland.\n\nThe show has been renewed for a third season and there are plans for a fourth.\n\nThe show stars the duo as \"Nirvanna the Band,\" two hapless lifelong best friends and roommates, who engage in a series of complex publicity stunts around their home city of Toronto in the hopes of landing a gig at The Rivoli, despite the fact that they have never actually written or recorded a single song, nor taken any other steps to get their band ready.\n\nThe show is a combination of scripted scenes, candid camera footage of people unaware the show is being filmed, and improvisation. Often times the show is influenced by events that happen in reality. For example, in the fifth episode, \"The Big Time\", creators Johnson and McCarrol used the premiere of Johnson's real life movie \"Operation Avalanche\" at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival to film an episode around the concept of the character Matt sneaking a fictional movie of the same name into the festival. In the same episode, a woman unaware of the show being filmed intrudes on a scripted conversation between Johnson and Kevin Smith (appearing as himself), offering Johnson alcohol, which inspired Johnson and McCarrol to include the concept of the character of Matt discovering a love of alcohol in the episode. The show frequently blends the line between fiction and reality in ways like these, with actors breaking character and characters breaking the fourth wall.\n\nOriginally created as web series between 2007 and 2009, it was later expanded into a full television series which premiered on Viceland on February 2, 2017. Three episodes were also screened at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival as part of its \"Primetime\" program of television projects. The series was originally announced in 2016 as slated to air on City, but was later shifted to Viceland with City airing only the first episode as a preview special. The second season has not been picked up for broadcast outside of Canada, however is available for streaming in Australia via SBS On Demand and in Britain via Channel 4 On Demand.\n\nThe characters, Matt and Jay, are based on characters McCarrol and Johnson started developing in high school in Mississauga.\n\nThe show has received mostly positive reviews.\n\nJake Howell of The Globe and Mail praised the show, commenting \"Bickering like a married couple, Matt and Jay's constant back-and-forth enabling, backstabbing and belittling of each other has thus far made for great television.\" Calum Marsh of National Post gave the series a positive review, stating \"The intricate arrangement of jokes, careful plotting of action and meticulous orchestration of references demand considerably more from an audience than one tends to expect of a mainstream sitcom.\"\n\nWhile Kate Robertson of NOW Toronto was critical of the show's racist jokes saying \"The pop culture references are always 90s, and the show aims to preserve a certain part of Toronto that many of us associate with those years. There’s also an uneasy, dated quality to it. Things have changed: ironic racist jokes of the past were never funny after all. They were just excuses to be shocking and racist. Maybe gags like this are an effort to highlight the persistent prejudices from the beginning of political correctness in the 90s, but it’s still a show programmed for a 2017 audience.\"\n\n"}

It is a sequel to \"The Student Nurses\" (1970) for New World Pictures. Roger Corman says they got the idea for the title after being sent a letter of complaint about the first film from the Private Duty Nurses Association.\n\nThe film was followed by \"Night Call Nurses\" (1972).\n\n\nGeorge Armitage had made a few films for Roger Corman, acting in \"Von Richtofen and Brown\" and writing and acting in \"Gas-s-s-s\". He wanted to direct. Armitage:\nPeter Bogdanovich and Francis [Ford Coppola] had left working with Roger, so there was an opening there for directors, I asked him if I could direct, and he said sure. He said: “Would you like to do a nurse movie or a stewardess move?” I said I’d like to do a stewardess movie, and he said: “Okay, well then you can do the nurse movie.” Okay! Anyways, I got into it, and I wrote the script, and I got Everett Chambers, from \"Peyton Place\", a crew of some TV guys that I’d worked with, and some young commercial crew. This fellow called Fouad Said had invented this thing called Cinemobile... and I used it to film on location. I did everything on location... I shot the whole movie in the South Bay, Manhattan Beach—it’s exactly the same place and time period that Paul Thomas Anderson used in \"Inherent Vice\".\nArmitage was familiar with the Manhattan beach area having surfed there when he was younger.\n\nArmitage said the film had to feature sex but he put in a let-down sex scene at the beginning.\nI was talking to the girls and they said: “Hey, why don’t you do a guy who’s just a lousy lay. Sometimes you run into that.” And I thought that’d be perfect for the South Bay, because it was a pretty crazy culture going on down there at the time, so that’s what we did.\nArmitage heard about the band Sky, went to see them perform at a high school, and cast them in the film.\n\nArmitage says Corman left him alone for most of the film.\nHe wanted us to do whatever we felt, what we were thinking of poetically, socially, culturally at the time. So I tried to look at it from a woman’s point-of-view, adding my own feelings about what was going on. Corman and I got along very well. I didn’t like the way Hollywood treated him—he was kind of an underdog and I loved the fact that he would just say, “Here, go make the movie.” He never came to the set, he totally allowed us to do what we were doing... And \"Private Duty Nurses\" was done in 15 days.\n\n"}

{"id": "538365", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=538365", "title": "Señor Wences", "text": "Señor Wences\n\nWenceslao Moreno (April 17, 1896 – April 20, 1999), better known as Señor Wences, was a Spanish ventriloquist. His popularity grew with his frequent appearances on CBS-TV's \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nWenceslao Moreno was born in Peñaranda de Bracamonte, Salamanca, Spain. His father was Antonio Moreno Ros, and his mother was Josefa Centeno Lavera. Both parents were born in the province of Salamanca, his father in Peñaranda de Bracamonte and his mother in Cordovilla. Señor Wences's family on both sides were Roman Catholic. Señor Wences was one of the benefactors of the Convent of Saint Teresa of Avila (1515-1582) in Alba de Tormes, Salamanca, where he had a house. He attended Mass there every Sunday when vacationing during the summer. The street that leads to the convent received the name of Señor Wences while he was alive. Several other places in Salamanca and in Castille have streets named for him.\n\nAt age 15, he became a bullfighter, however had to give-up the sport after a serious injury. Doctors advised him to exercise his injured arm so he learned to juggle and joined friends' circus act.\n\nPerforming under the stage name \"Señor Wences\", Moreno was known for his speed, skill, and grace as a ventriloquist. His stable of characters included Johnny, a childlike face drawn on his hand, placed atop an otherwise headless doll, with whom the ventrilloquist conversed while switching voices between Johnny's falsetto and his own voice with great speed. He opened his act by drawing Johnny's face on his hand, on stage. He would first place his thumb next to, and in front of, his bent first finger; the first finger would be the upper lip, and the thumb the lower lip. He used lipstick to draw the lips onto the respective fingers and then drew eyes onto the upper part of the first finger, finishing the effect with a tiny long-haired wig on top of his hand. Flexing the thumb would move the \"lips.\" The inspiration for Johnny came from his school days when the teacher punished him for imitating classmates and answering \"present\" when they were absent. His punishment was to clean the inkwells and he smeared some of the ink on his hand, then clenched his fist to create the face.\n\nAnother popular Señor Wences character was the gruff-voiced Pedro, a disembodied head in a box. Wences was forced to suddenly invent the character when his regular, full-sized dummy was destroyed during a 1936 train accident en route to Chicago. Pedro would either \"speak\" from within the closed box, or speak with moving lipssimply growling, \"s'awright\" (\"it's all right\")when the performer opened the box's front panel with his free hand. A large part of the entertainer's comedy lay in the well-timed, high-speed exchange of words between himself and his creations, and in the difference in their voice pitches.\n\nPart of his act involved throwing his voice while his mouth was otherwise engaged (i.e. smoking or drinking.) Another favorite prop was a telephone, with the ventriloquist playing both sides of a telephone conversation. For the \"caller\" he simulated a \"filtered\" voice, as it would sound over a telephone wire. This voice always began a conversation with a shouted \"Moreno?\"using Señor Wences' true surname. He would respond \"No, Moreno is not here.\"\n\nHe usually built to a big finish that combined ventriloquism with juggling and plate-spinning. As he performed his routines, Pedro and Johnny heckled him.\n\nAlthough he was an international favorite for decades, his main career was made in the United States, where he arrived in 1934 or 1935. In addition to live performances at nightclubs, he appeared regularly on TV variety shows, including frequent appearances on CBS's \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", where he was a guest 48 times, on Broadway, in Las Vegas casino theaters and in feature films. Much later in his career he was introduced to a new generation of fans on \"The Muppet Show\". His last TV appearance was on \"The Very Best of the Ed Sullivan Show #2\", a retrospective in which the nonagenarian talked about \"Suliban\" and performed a brief spot of ventriloquism.\n\nHe pronounced his name the traditional Castilian way, which in English sounds like \"WEN-thess\". After Sullivan would announce him saying his name as \"Señor Wen-sess\", the ventriloquist would subtly correct Sullivan's pronunciation by announcing himself to the audience: \"Hello, I am Señor Wen-thess\".\n\nIn the early 1980s, a Tri-State Honda dealer's commercial featured Señor Wences with Johnny. Pedro's \"s'awright\" was a voice from the elaborate glovebox. Señor Wences would point out all of the car's features to which Johnny would reply, \"Nice!\" This may have been Wences final commercial appearance. It was shot in Puerto Rico because its star declined to travel to New York. In 1986, he made a guest appearance on \"The Garry Shandling Show\".\n\nIn 2009 Señor Wences was featured in the ventriloquist comedy documentary \"I'm No Dummy\", directed by Bryan W. Simon.\n\nOne of Wences's trademark bits of shtick (referenced several times below) involves his dialogue with a low voice emanating from inside a box. At the opening of the dialogue he would shout, \"Hello in the box!\" At the conclusion of the dialogue, he would open the lid of the box and ask \"S'aright?\" (\"It's all right?\") and the box voice would answer \"S'ariiight!\"\n\nAnother involved explaining to his hand puppet Johnny that something was easy (or difficult) to do, to which the puppet would reply the contrary, such as, \"Easy for you, for me ees very deefeecult!\" in his Spanish accent.\n\nThese catchphrases were incorporated into a record Wences released in 1959 by Joy Records (New York), featuring the songs \"S-All Right? S-All Right\" and \"Deefeecult For YouEasy For Me\".\n\nWences received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the US National Comedy Hall of Fame in 1996.\n\nDespite his retirement by age 100, Wences' famous puppets Johnny and Pedro \"continued working\". Ventriloquists Jay Johnson, Rickie Layne and Michele LaFong performed at Wences' 100th birthday celebration at the New York Friars' Club (where he was made a lifetime member), and he was so impressed with LaFong that he befriended her. Not only did he give her his puppets, but also taught her how to perform his classic routines. Las Vegas headliner LaFong is the only ventriloquist authorized by the Wences Estate to perform Johnny and Pedro, plus Wences' routines. Another famous ventriloquist who was present at Wences' birthday party, and who met him there for the first time was Paul Winchell. \n\nWences died just after his 103rd birthday. He had been residing in New York City's Upper West Side on 54th Street, just around the corner from the Ed Sullivan Theater. That section of 54th Street has been named Señor Wences Way. His portrait can be seen at the Players Club in New York.\n\n"}

It is no longer used in Australian culture. The actual quote spoken by Hogan is \"I'll slip an extra shrimp on the barbie for you\", and the actual slogan of the ad was \"Come and say G'day\". It has since been used, along with some variations, to make reference to Australia in popular culture.\n\nThe advertisement pre-dated Hogan's popularity in the 1986 film \"Crocodile Dundee\" and thus were not initially seen as celebrity advertisements in the US, as he was relatively unknown in the United States (though well known in the UK through his long-running television comedy show), although the film somewhat increased the commercial's popularity.\n\nThe advertisements were developed by the Australian agency Mojo in conjunction with American agency N.W. Ayer. The campaign was launched during the National Football Conference Championship Game in January 1984. Before the campaign, Australia was approximately number 78 on the \"most desired\" vacation destination list for Americans, but became number 7 three months after the launch, and soon became number 1 or 2 on Americans' \"dream vacation\" list, remaining in that position for most of the next two decades.\n\n\"Barbie\" is Australian slang for \"barbecue\" and the phrase \"slip a shrimp on the barbie\", for Americans, often evokes images of a fun social gathering under the sun. Australians, however, invariably use the word \"prawn\" rather than \"shrimp\". Because the commercial was commissioned for broadcast in the United States, the change was made to limit audience confusion. The commercial was so influential that three decades later, USC Trojans football player Chris Tilbey, an Australian, reported that he was quoted the \"shrimp on the barbie\" line \"Every day. Every day\".\n\nThe term was used in the opening sequence of the 1994 cult comedy \"Dumb and Dumber\", when protagonist Lloyd Christmas (portrayed by Jim Carrey) tries to hit on an Austrian woman, mistaking her for an Australian: \"Let's put another shrimp on the barbie\". She then turns him down, saying \"Let's not\".\n\nPrawns are a popular traditional Christmas seafood in Australia. However, crustaceans such as shrimp and prawns are less common, on average, in the Australian cuisine than in the United States. In the late 1980s, annual per capita consumption of shrimp stood at 1.3 kg in the United States, second only to Japan.\n\n"}
{"id": "1865916", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1865916", "title": "Signalling (economics)", "text": "Signalling (economics)\n\nIn contract theory, signalling (or signaling; see spelling differences) is the idea that one party (termed the agent) credibly conveys some information about itself to another party (the principal). For example, in Michael Spence's job-market signalling model, (potential) employees send a signal about their ability level to the employer by acquiring education credentials. The informational value of the credential comes from the fact that the employer believes the credential is positively correlated with having greater ability and difficult for low ability employees to obtain. Thus the credential enables the employer to reliably distinguish low ability workers from high ability workers.\n\nSignalling took root in the idea of asymmetric information (a deviation from perfect information), which says that in some economic transactions, inequalities in access to information upset the normal market for the exchange of goods and services. In his seminal 1973 article, Michael Spence proposed that two parties could get around the problem of asymmetric information by having one party send a signal that would reveal some piece of relevant information to the other party. That party would then interpret the signal and adjust her purchasing behaviour accordingly—usually by offering a higher price than if she had not received the signal.\nThere are, of course, many problems that these parties would immediately run into.\n\nIn the job market, potential employees seek to sell their services to employers for some wage, or price. Generally, employers are willing to pay higher wages to employ better workers. While the individual may know his or her own level of ability, the hiring firm is not (usually) able to observe such an intangible trait—thus there is an asymmetry of information between the two parties. Education credentials can be used as a signal to the firm, indicating a certain level of ability that the individual may possess; thereby narrowing the informational gap. This is beneficial to both parties as long as the signal indicates a desirable attribute—a signal such as a criminal record may not be so desirable.\n\nMichael Spence considers hiring as a type of investment under uncertainty, analogous to buying a lottery ticket, and refers to the attributes of an applicant which are observable to the employer as indices. Of these, attributes which the applicant can manipulate are termed signals. Applicant age is thus an index, but is not a signal since it does not change at the discretion of the applicant.\n\nThe employer is supposed to have conditional probability assessments of productive capacity, based on previous experience of the market, for each combination of indices and signals. The employer updates those assessments upon observing each employee’s characteristics.\n\nThe paper is concerned with a risk-neutral employer. The offered wage is the expected marginal product. Signals may be acquired by sustaining signalling costs (monetary and not). If everyone invests in the signal in the exactly the same way, then the signal can't be used as discriminatory, therefore a critical assumption is made: the costs of signalling are negatively correlated with productivity. This situation as described is a feedback loop: the employer updates his beliefs upon new market information and updates the wage schedule, applicants react by signalling, and recruitment takes place.\n\nMichael Spence studies the signalling equilibrium that may result from such a situation. He began his 1973 model with an hypothetical example: suppose that there are two types of employees—good and bad—and that employers are willing to pay a higher wage to the good type than the bad type. Spence assumes that for employers, there's no real way to tell in advance which employees will be of the good or bad type.\n\nBad employees aren't upset about this, because they get a free ride from the hard work of the good employees. But good employees know that they deserve to be paid more for their higher productivity, so they desire to invest in the signal—in this case, some amount of education. But he does make one key assumption: \"good-type employees pay less for one unit of education than bad-type employees\". The cost he refers to is not necessarily the cost of tuition and living expenses, sometimes called out of pocket expenses, as one could make the argument that higher ability persons tend to enroll in \"better\" (i.e. more expensive) institutions. Rather, the cost Spence is referring to is the opportunity cost. This is a combination of 'costs', monetary and otherwise, including psychological, time, effort and so on. Of key importance to the value of the signal is the differing cost structure between \"good\" and \"bad\" workers. The cost of obtaining identical credentials is strictly lower for the \"good\" employee than it is for the \"bad\" employee.\n\nThe differing cost structure need not preclude \"bad\" workers from obtaining the credential. All that is necessary for the signal to have value (informational or otherwise) is that the group with the signal is positively correlated with the previously unobservable group of \"good\" workers. In general, the degree to which a signal is thought to be correlated to unknown or unobservable attributes is directly related to its value.\n\nSpence discovered that even if education did not contribute anything to an employee's productivity, it could still have value to both the employer and employee. If the appropriate cost/benefit structure exists (or is created), \"good\" employees will buy more education in order to signal their higher productivity.\n\nThe increase in wages associated with obtaining a higher credential is sometimes referred to as the “sheepskin effect”, since “sheepskin” informally denotes a diploma. It is important to note that this is not the same as the returns from an additional year of education. The \"sheepskin\" effect is actually the wage increase above what would normally be attributed to the extra year of education. This can be observed empirically in the wage differences between 'drop-outs' vs. 'completers' with an equal number of years of education. It is also important that one does not equate the fact that higher wages are paid to more educated individuals entirely to signalling or the 'sheepskin' effects. In reality education serves many different purposes to individuals and society as a whole. Only when all of these aspects, as well as all the many factors affecting wages, are controlled for, does the effect of the \"sheepskin\" approach its true value. Empirical studies of signalling indicate it as a statistically significant determinant of wages, however it is one of a host of other attributes—age, sex, and geography are examples of other important factors.\n\nTo illustrate his argument, Spence imagines, for simplicity, two productively distinct groups in a population facing one employer. The signal under consideration is education, measured by an index y and is subject to individual choice. Education costs are both monetary and psychic. The data can be summarized as:\n\nSuppose that the employer believes that there is a level of education y* below which productivity is 1 and above which productivity is 2. His offered wage schedule W(y) will be:\n\nWorking with these hypotheses Spence shows that:\n\n\nIn conclusion, even if education has no real contribution to the marginal product of the worker, the combination of the beliefs of the employer and the presence of signalling transforms the education level y* in a prerequisite for the higher paying job. It may appear to an external observer that education has raised the marginal product of labor, without this necessarily being true.\n\nFor a signal to be effective, certain conditions must be true. In equilibrium the cost of obtaining the credential must be lower for high productivity workers and act as a signal to the employer such that they will pay a higher wage.\n\nIn this model it is optimal for the higher ability person to obtain the credential (the observable signal) but not for the lower ability individual. The table shows the outcome of low ability person l and high ability person h with and without signal S:\n\nThe structure is as follows:\nThere are two individuals with differing ability (productivity) levels.\n\n\nThe premise for the model is that a person of high ability (h) has a lower cost for obtaining a given level of education than does a person of lower ability (l). Cost can be in terms of monetary, such as tuition, or psychological, stress incurred to obtain the credential.\n\n\nFor the individual:\n\nThus, if both individuals act rationally it is optimal for person h to obtain S but not for person l so long as the following conditions are satisfied.\n\nEdit: note that this is incorrect with the example as graphed. Both 'l' and 'h' have lower costs than W* at the education level. Also, Person and Person are not clear.\n\nEdit: note that this is ok as for low type \"l\": formula_3 , and thus low type will choose Do not obtain credential.\n\nEdit: For there to be a separating equilibrium the high type 'h' must also check their outside option; do they want to choose the net pay in the separating equilibrium (calculated above) over the net pay in the pooling equilibrium. Thus we also need to test that: formula_4 Otherwise high type 'h' will choose Do not obtain credential of the pooling equilibrium.\nFor the employers:\n\nIn equilibrium, in order for the signalling model to hold, the employer must recognize the signal and pay the corresponding wage and this will result in the workers self-sorting into the two groups. One can see that the cost/benefit structure for a signal to be effective must fall within certain bounds or else the system will fail.\n\nLeland and Pyle (1977) analyse the role of signals within the process of IPO. The authors show how companies with good future perspectives and higher possibilities of success (\"good companies\") should always send clear signals to the market when going public (e.g. the owner should keep control of a significant percentage of the company). To be reliable, the signal must be too costly to be imitated by \"bad companies\". If no signal is sent to the market, asymmetric information will result in adverse selection in the IPO market.\n\nWaldfogel and Chen (2006) demonstrate the importance of brands in signalling quality in online marketplaces.\n\nSignalling has been studied and proposed as a means to address asymmetric information in markets for Lemons. Recently, signalling theory has been applied in used cars market such as eBay Motors. For example, Lewis (2011) examines the role of information access and shows that the voluntary disclosure of private information increases the prices of used cars on eBay. Further, Dimoka et al. (2012) analyzed data from eBay Motors on the role of signals to mitigate product uncertainty. Extending the information asymmetry literature in consumer behavior literature from the agent (seller) to the product, authors theorized and validated the nature and dimensions of product uncertainty, which is distinct from, yet shaped by, seller uncertainty. Authors also found information signals (diagnostic product descriptions and third-party product assurances) to reduce product uncertainty, which negatively affect price premiums (relative to the book values) of the used cars in online used cars markets.\n\nMost signalling models are plagued by a multiplicity of possible equilibrium outcomes. In a study published in the \"Journal of Economic Theory\", a signalling model has been proposed that has a unique equilibrium outcome. In the principal-agent model it is argued that an agent will choose a large (observable) investment level when he has a strong outside option. Yet, an agent with a weak outside option might try to bluff by also choosing a large investment, in order to make the principal believe that the agent has a strong outside option (so that the principal will make a better contract offer to the agent). Hence, when an agent has private information about his outside option, signalling may mitigate the hold-up problem.\n\nSignalling influences bettors in domains that are relevant to their identity or commitments. When betting on or against a group, belief, or ideal, such as a favorite sports team or politician, the choice of bet (i.e., for or against) sends a signal to the bettor about his or her identity. Betting on the outcome seems to send a reaffirming signal to the bettor about her identity, whereas betting against the outcome seems to send a signal to the bettor that the outcome is less important than before. As a result, bettors are reluctant to bet against such identity-relevant outcomes, even when bets against identity-relevant outcomes are more favorable than bets on identity relevant outcomes. When presented real gambles of equal expected value (ev = $7.50) on the 2000 US Presidential election, for example, both supporters of George W. Bush and Al Gore were more likely to bet their candidate to win (74%) the election than to lose the election (26%). As further evidence, more than 45% of N.C.A.A. basketball and hockey fans turned down a free chance to earn $5 if their team lost its upcoming game.\n\n"}

Although Ireland is located at a high latitude, the warm ocean currents of the North Atlantic drift ensures mild water temperatures throughout the year, with a minimum of 10 °C (50 °F) in winter and a maximum of 21 °C (70 °F) in summer.\n\nThe numerous beaches, reefs, headlands and coves along the west coast of Ireland serve as popular surf spots. Ireland has played host to international events since the 1960s, and is home to many surf shops, schools and clubs.\n\nSurfing has been documented in Ireland as early as 1949, however it wasn't until 1964 that the \"Bray Island Surf Club\" was founded. Ireland was first represented at the World Surfing Championship in 1966 by Kevin Cavey, which in turn inspired the first Irish National Surfing Championships, held in Tramore, Co. Waterford in 1967. The first Irish Inter County Surfing Championships was held in 1968, followed by a full Irish team entry in the inaugural European Surfing Championships of 1969.\n\nThe growing interest in competition surfing mirrored a general interest in surfing across the island, with the number of participants and clubs growing rapidly throughout the late 60s; by 1970, there were an estimated 400 surfers in the country. This led to the foundation of the Irish Surfing Association in that year.\n\n\"Irish Surfing\", also known as the \"Irish Surfing Association\", is a voluntary organisation that governs the sport of surfing on the island of Ireland. It participates in club development, instructor training and surf school regulation, and promoting surfing safety and the protection of the environment, as well as overseeing competitive surfing in Ireland.\n\nThere are 16 surf clubs accredited by the Irish Surfing Association.\nThere are also many unaccredited surf clubs throughout the country.\n\nThe two most important annual events in the Irish surfing calendar are the Irish National Surfing Championships, held in Bundoran, Co. Donegal, and the Irish Inter County Surfing Championships, held in Rossnowlagh, Co. Donegal.\n\nIreland has frequently hosted international competitions, including the Smirnoff International (Easky, 1979), the European Surfing Championships (Lahinch, 1972; Rossnowlagh, 1985; Bundoran, 1997 & 2011) and the Billabong Monster Tow In Surf Session (Mullaghmore 2011, 2012/13).\n\nAlthough surfing is not universally associated with Ireland, there is a growing surfing subculture to accommodate the increased interest in the sport. There have been a number of surfing documentaries filmed on the island (including the acclaimed 2008 documentary, Waveriders), as well as annual surf music festivals and a surf film festival.\n\nIreland has an estimated 20,000 resident surfers. In addition, the country is an increasingly popular destination for surfing tourists.\n\nIreland's location on the edge of the North Atlantic makes it a good location for accessing large waves. The record for the largest measured wave, at 19 m (62 ft) tall, is held by a buoy off the north-west coast of the country, and satellite imagery has shown a tendency for the generation of waves in excess of 9 m (30 ft) tall in the area.\n\nIreland's most iconic big wave, known as \"Ailleens\" after the nearby \"Aill na Searrach\" cliffs, is located off the Cliffs of Moher, Co. Clare, and is a popular location for tow-in surfing. Although championed by many as a \"perfect wave\", with a potential height of 12 m (39 ft), Ailleens is not an everyday occurrence, as it requires stormy conditions and strong east winds offshore.\n\nMullaghmore Head's 9 m (30 ft) waves, in Co. Sligo, have served as the platform for the \"Billabong Monster Tow In Surf Session\" since 2011\".\" A nearby wave, known as \"Prowlers\", has been surfed at an estimated height of 15 m (50 ft).\n\n\n"}

The idea for the park can be traced to a proposal to build a second theme park in Southern California called \"Port Disney\" in Long Beach, California, with the RMS \"Queen Mary\" as the main attraction. The idea was scrapped after the company endured financial trouble with the Euro Disney project. Later the idea was passed on to the Oriental Land Company to expand their resort.\n\nThere are seven themed areas or \"ports of call\". The entrance to the park is Mediterranean Harbor, which opens up to six more nautically themed ports: American Waterfront, Lost River Delta, Port Discovery, Mermaid Lagoon, Arabian Coast, and Mysterious Island.\n\nMediterranean Harbor is the entrance \"port-of-call\" and themed as an Italian port city, with Venetian Gondolas that guests can board and ride. Littered throughout the port are various shops and restaurants. Mediterranean Harbor's layout differs from the entry \"lands\" of other Disney parks as it is a large \"V\" shape rather than a main street that leads to a hub (as found in Disneyland's Main Street, U.S.A. or Disney's Hollywood Studios' Hollywood Boulevard\"). To the right, the path leads to Mysterious Island, and to the left, the path leads to the American Waterfront. Built into the architecture of the port is Tokyo DisneySea Hotel MiraCosta; the hotel serves as a full-scale reproduction of the various buildings of Portofino and Venice's ports, and serves as the southern berm (or border) of the park. Mediterranean Harbor also features \"Fortress Explorations\", a large-scale interactive play area for guests that features exploration-themed activities and attractions. The nighttime show \"Fantasmic!\" premiered on 28 April 2011 as part of the park's 10th anniversary celebration.\n\nMysterious Island is a \"port-of-call\" within Mount Prometheus, the giant volcano that is the park's centerpiece and most prominent feature. It relies heavily on the storytelling of Jules Verne and, specifically, the mythology of the volcano fortress mentioned several times in the books called \"Vulcania\". The Mount Prometheus ride employs technology similar to Epcot's Test Track. The smallest \"port of call\", it nevertheless holds two of the more popular attractions: \"Journey to the Center of the Earth\", a thrill ride, and \"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\", a dark ride. While appearing to be a volcano on the water, Mysterious Island is not an island; it is built into the side of Mount Prometheus, which is part of the show building for the two attractions. The architecture in this port is of Victorian style.\n\nMermaid Lagoon is home to the characters of \"The Little Mermaid\". The facade is made to resemble King Triton's palace and features seashell-inspired architecture. This \"port of call\" is mostly indoors and recreates the feeling of being underwater. Attractions include Flounder's Flying Fish Coaster; Scuttle's Scooters; Jumpin' Jellyfish; Blowfish Balloon Race; The Whirlpool; all of which are children's rides. Also in this area are Ariel's Playground, which is a children's playground and extensive walk-through attraction that recreates the various settings in the movie; and the Mermaid Lagoon Theater, which houses 'King Triton's Concert', a musical show featuring live actors, large-scale puppetry and Audio-Animatronics that recreate the story of The Little Mermaid.\n\nThis is themed after \"Aladdin\". It recreates an Arabian harbor combined with an \"enchanted world from 1001 Arabian Nights\". There are four attractions in the land: Sindbad's Storybook Voyage, an indoor dark ride boat ride whose art direction seems to be (at first glance) a variation on \"It's a Small World\" (with its own theme song, \"Compass of your Heart\", composed by Alan Menken); Caravan Carousel, a double-decker carousel that holds over 190 passengers; Jasmine's Flying Carpets; and the Magic Lamp Theater, which houses a combined live-action/animatronic based magic show with a 3D movie featuring the Genie.\n\nLocated at the back of the park, the dominant structure in this \"port of call\" is the ruins of an ancient Aztec pyramid which houses the dark thrill ride, . Also in the Lost River Delta is the DisneySea Steamer Line which transports guests back to Mediterranean Harbor, 'Out of Shadowland', a live theatrical show that follows Mei, a young girl lost in a world of shadows who finds confidence and strength through her sojourn there. Furthermore, the Lost River Delta contains an Intamin roller coaster named Raging Spirits, which opened in 2005 and is similar to Indiana Jones et le Temple du Péril at Disneyland Park in Paris.\n\nThis \"port of call\" is home to the fictional 'Marine Life Institute'; Port Discovery houses two attractions: Aquatopia, a boat ride that uses LPS tracking (the 'trackless' technology also used in Tokyo Disneyland's Pooh's Hunny Hunt) to move and spin through a lagoon amid waterfalls and whirlpools, and the narrow gauge DisneySea Electric Railway, an overhead electric trolley that transports riders to and from the American Waterfront. On 12 May 2017, the land became home to Nemo & Friends SeaRider based on Finding Nemo/Finding Dory which replaced the former StormRider simulator.\n\nThis \"port of call\" represents the northeastern seaboard of the United States in the early 20th century. It features two themed areas, an \"Old Cape Cod\" section, and a \"New York Harbor\" section. The land is dominated by a large passenger ship, SS \"Columbia\", which is usually the site for various shows and events. Guests have the option of riding the area's \"Big City Vehicles\" which roam the streets of the area. It also features the gauge DisneySea Electric Railway, which takes passengers from The American Waterfront to nearby Port Discovery. The port has a Broadway-themed theater which plays the show \"Big Band Beat\", which features 1940's-style swing jazz performed by a 12-piece band, as well as 20 singers/dancers. The port's most popular attraction is the Tower of Terror, an elaborately themed free-fall E-ticket ride.\n\nToy Story Mania is an interactive 4-D theme park attraction located at the American Waterfront in a new area called Toyville Trolley Park. It is inspired by Disney Pixar's Toy Story. The attraction opened on 9 July 2012. Guests wear 3-D glasses while riding spinning vehicles that travel through virtual environments based on classic carnival games. There are shooters on the vehicles to let guests to shoot targets in those 3-D games like \"egg toss\" and \"balloon pop\".\n\nIn 2002 Tokyo DisneySea won a Thea Award from the Themed Entertainment Association for the concept, design, and construction of the theme park. The award was presented at El Capitan Theater in Hollywood, California.\n\nThe park's two symbols are the DisneySea AquaSphere - a water fountain with a large model of the earth - in the entrance plaza, and the volcano, Mount Prometheus, in the center of the park.\n\n\n"}

In 2015, Traxxas released its largest monster truck to date, the X-Maxx, and also debuted their Self-Righting technology.\n\n\nTraxxas radio-controlled vehicles come fully assembled and \"Ready-to-Run\". However, Traxxas refers to their vehicles as \"Ready-to-Race\". Electric models feature sealed electronics allowing them to be run in wet conditions. Electric models are offered in either brushed or brushless versions and most include Traxxas Power Cell batteries and Peak Detecting Fast Chargers. Nitro models also include a battery and charger to support the EZ-Start starting system. Nitro models are powered by the Pro.15, TRX 2.5 Racing Engine, or TRX 3.3 Racing Engine.\n\nDepending on the model, it will come with a TQ 2.4 GHz radio system or a TQi 2.4 GHz radio system. Some models also feature the Traxxas Link Wireless Module and Telemetry sensors for tuning and keeping track of the vehicle's performance. Some of the Slash short course truck models feature the Traxxas exclusive On-Board radio system. Several brushless powered models and higher-end nitro models feature Traxxas Stability Management. The Self-Righting feature works with the X-Maxx, E-Maxx, and Stampede 4X4 VXL models.\n\nTraxxas currently sponsors the Speed Energy Formula Off-Road series. Currently, Traxxas fields trucks in the series for Matt Brabham and Sheldon Creed.\n\nTraxxas also sponsors athletes who compete in motocross. This includes Ryder DiFrancesco, Carson Mumford, Gage Schehr, Axell Hodges, and Justin Mulford.\n\nTraxxas was the lead sponsor for John Force Racing team member, Courtney Force, who is the daughter of John Force. Courtney Force drives the Traxxas Chevrolet Camaro SS Funny Car in the NHRA.\n\nTraxxas was a sponsor in the Championship Off-Road Racing (CORR) series until its demise in 2008. It took over as the title sponsor in an off-road racing series called the Traxxas TORC Series. Traxxas demonstrated its products at events and had a Traxxas Mobile Support Center on site. The Mobile Support Center carried Traxxas parts, cars, trucks, and boats. Traxxas' lead sponsorship of the TORC Series ended in 2014.\n\nTraxxas-sponsored drivers in short course racing are Mike Jenkins, Keegan Kincaid, RJ Anderson, and Jeremy McGrath.\n\nIn 2010, Traxxas sponsored the No. 18 Toyota Tundra of Kyle Busch in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series.\n\nThe largest segment in the Traxxas lineup is all-terrain/off-road bashing vehicles.\n\nThe Maxx family consists of several models originally based around the T-Maxx that was released in 1999.\n\nIn 2008, Traxxas introduced a further revised version of the, then, T-Maxx 2.5. It is now called the T-Maxx Classic. Changes were limited to a new paint scheme, subtly revised graphics and new wheels and tires (the same ones used on the T-Maxx 2.5R).\nThe T-Maxx now comes standard with a 2.4 GHz radio system.\n\n\nThe T-Maxx 3.3 was very similar to the T-Maxx 2.5R, however there were some differences. The biggest one was Traxxas' larger, more powerful TRX 3.3 nitro engine. Other differences were mirror chrome versions of the 2.5R's 3.8 inch wheels, \"Talon\" all-terrain style tires (first used on Revo), a wheelie bar, and a different body paint scheme. It has a claimed top speed of 45+MPH.\n\nIn 2008, Traxxas introduced a revised T-Maxx 3.3. The new model featured a new body, with new paint and graphics. It also features a new chassis with the wheelbase extended by 30 mm which features a new skid plate. Other features include, new \"Hurricane\" wheels, new 6.3 inch \"Giant Maxx\" all-terrain style tires (.55 inches taller than the previous 5.75 inch \"Talon\" tires), new dual stage air filter, newly standard \"resonator\" tuned exhaust pipe, and a new digital high torque steering servo.\n\n\nThe E-Maxx is the electric counterpart to the T-Maxx. It shares the same suspension and differential parts as the T-Maxx, but trades the central metal chassis for a molded composite tub chassis housing a remote shifted two-speed transmission (now discontinued, the emaxx currently has a 1-speed transmission), two 550 sized electric motors, related electronics and batteries. The original (model 3906) E-Maxx ran on two 7.2 volt battery packs, using a total of 14.4 volts to run the system through its Novak designed EVX ESC. The Novak was also capable of running two 8.4 volt batteries, totaling to 16.8 volts. Traxxas later equipped the model 3906 E-Maxx with a waterproof EVX-2 ESC which runs two 8.4 volt batteries, and can also run LiPo batteries.\n\nIn 2007, Traxxas introduced an updated version of the E-Maxx (model 3905). This model featured a new extended wheelbase chassis, a new transmission skid plate, new waterproof EVX-2 16.8 volt speed control, new sealed differentials, drive shafts, pivot balls, and ball bearings, new dual waterproof steering servos, water tight receiver box, new steering linkage, redesigned bulkheads, new hex hardware, new single speed strengthened, brushless ready transmission (a two-speed transmission is available as an accessory), Revo spec slipper clutch, new battery holders, 3.8 inch mirror chrome wheels and \"Chevron\" tires, and a new body with new paint and revised graphics. Both models have a claimed top speed of 30+ MPH.\n\nIn late 2009, Traxxas released the E-Maxx Brushless Edition (model 3908). It features the same Castle Creations \"NEU\" brushless motor and \"Mamba Monster\" brushless ESC as the E-Revo Brushless Edition. Other features included 17 mm splined hubs, a wheelie bar, Traxxas' 2.4GHz radio system, dual waterproof digital high-torque steering servos, heavy duty slipper clutch, 6.3 inch \"Giant Maxx\" tires, white progressive rate springs, black-chrome wheels and bumpers, and new paint and graphics.\n\nAs of January 2014 the E-Maxx Brushless Edition comes with the waterproof MXL-6s brushless power system.\n\n\nIn late 2015, Traxxas introduced their largest monster truck to date. The X-Maxx hit the scales at almost 20 pounds. It is almost 30 inches long and almost 14 inches tall. It was given a new waterproof motor/speed control combo known as the VXL-6S brushless power system. Traxxas debuted the Self-Righting feature in the X-Maxx. This feature allows the user to press a button on the transmitter that engages the truck. The truck then rocks itself until it is back on all four tires. \nThe X-Maxx also featured an entirely new chassis and suspension setup. Another notable feature that debuted on the X-Maxx is the clipless body mounting system that uses a latch system and not the standard body post and clip design. The X-Maxx was also equipped with Traxxas Stability Management to help users maintain control of the truck in conditions where traction is low.\n\n\nIn July 2009, Traxxas introduced a further revised Revo 3.3. Changes included a new body with new paint and graphics, new dual waterproof digital high torque steering servos, Traxxas' new 2.4 GHz radio system, an improved \"Optidrive\" two-speed reversing transmission, and new progressive 2 suspension rocker arms. Also, new deeper offset 3.8 inch \"Geode\" wheels increase overall width by 1 inch and new 6.3 inch \"Monster Maxx\" tires (lifted from the current T-Maxx) increase ground clearance by .25 inches to 4.25 inches and overall height by .9 inches to 11.02 inches.\n\nThe Slayer is a four-wheel drive short-course nitro race truck. This vehicle shares many parts with the two nitro Revos including the suspension (excepting the suspension arms, which are shorter and only have one push-rod mounting hole), chassis from the 2.5, and engine of the 3.3. The body of the Slayer is larger than normal 1/10 scale vehicles; this moves the tires inboard the body rather than outboard like other stadium trucks on the market today. Slayer comes stock RTR with the TRX 3.3 racing engine and has a claimed top speed of 50+ mph.\nA newer version of the Slayer was released in 2010 to update the race replica style, Slayer Pro 4x4 has BFGoodrich Mud Terrain tires or Kumho Road Venture tires. Along with the new tires new shells were released to capture the latest TORC looks.\nAn extended wheelbase and longer A-Arms were added to make the ultimate nitro short course R/C race truck.\n\nIn May 2008 Traxxas launched an electric powered version of the Revo, called the E-Revo. The electronics are identical to the E-Maxx 16.8, consisting of dual \"Titan\" 550 motors, EVX-2 Waterproof ESC, and waterproof high torque servos. The front and rear assemblies do not differ from the original Revo, but the chassis is injection molded plastic instead of an aluminum semi-monocoque chassis. Notable features include enclosed battery compartments with air intakes for cooling and a full length skid plate that completely encloses the transmission and central drive shafts. It also features a stadium truck style low-profile body instead of a pickup truck style body like the nitro Revo. Like the E-Maxx 16.8, the E-Revo is claimed by Traxxas to be waterproof and safe to use in wet environments. It has a claimed top speed of 30+MPH.\n\n\nIn late fall 2008 Traxxas introduced the E-Revo Brushless Edition. It uses a single Castle Creations \"NEU\" brushless motor and \"Mamba Monster\" brushless ESC in place of the dual \"titan\" brushed motors and EVX-2 waterproof ESC on the standard E-Revo. Other new features include Traxxas high current battery connectors and Traxxas' new 2.4GHz radio system (the old system was 27MHz). The claimed top speed varies from 25+mph on 14.4 volts from twin 6 cell NiMH battery packs (7.2 volts each, not recommended by Castle Creations) and the stock gear ratio to 65+MPH on 22.2 volts from twin 3S LiPo batteries (11.1 volts each) and an optional taller gear ratio.\nAs of January 2014, the E-Revo Brushless Edition comes with the waterproof MXL-6s brushless power system.\n\n\nIn early 2018 Traxxas introduced the E-Revo VXL Brushless Edition (model 86086-4). It uses a single brushless, non-sensored, 2200kV motor with a Velineon VXL-6s brushless ESC and is largely a revamp of the E-Revo Brushless Edition and is considered a 'Maxx-Spec' truck borrowing much of its upgrades from the X-Maxx. The claimed top speed is 70+ mph (when fitted with the upgraded optional gearing), and runs on twin 2S or 3S LiPo batteries. This model uses the TQi™ 2-channel transmitter with 6533 TSM receiver.\n\n\nThe Summit was introduced in early 2009 and is one of Traxxas' newest models. It is intended to be Traxxas' extreme terrain monster truck but is not a true rock crawler and does not fit into current Rock crawler classes. Many components are carried over from the E-Revo, including the chassis and major suspension and steering components, major transmission and drive line components, and the EVX-2 waterproof ESC with Low Voltage Detection. New components on the Summit included new 7 inch diameter \"Canyon AT\" soft all terrain style tires with soft foam inserts mounted on new 3.8 inch \"Geode\" beadlock style wheels, new front and rear remote locking differentials, new high articulation CV joints, Traxxas' new \"TQ4\" 4-channel transmitter, and a new 10 LED lighting system integrated into the bumpers with 4 white LEDs (for headlights) and 6 red LEDs (for tail lights). The Summit is powered by one of Traxxas' new \"Titan 775\" brushed 775 sized high torque fan-cooled motor. The transmission is a two-speed remote shifted unit with an ultra low ratio 70:1 first gear (for low speed climbing) and a 25:1 second gear (for higher speed off roading) Another feature is an integrated \"Exo-Cage\" external roll cage. Updates for 2010 included the TQ2.4 4-channel 2.4 GHz radio system. Updates for 2011 included Prographix-painted body, a 4-channel TQi 2.4 GHz radio system with available iPhone / iPod dock, and the addition of a version of the EVX-2 electronic speed control compatible with lithium-polymer batteries. A further revision in 2014 updated the radio to be compatible Traxxas Link Wireless Module which can be used with Android, iPhone, or iPod devices.\n\nThe brushed version of the 1/16 E-Revo features the Titan 12-Turn motor and XL 2.5 Electronic Speed Control as its power system. The chassis, drivetrain, suspension, wheels, tires, and body are shared between both models of the 1/16 E-Revo.\n\nReleased in late spring 2009, the E-Revo VXL 1/16 is essentially a scaled down version of the larger 1/10 scale E-Revo. The body, wheels, tires, suspension and drive components are all nearly identical in design to the 1/10 scale E-Revo, just scaled down. It is powered by a Velineon 380 4000kv brushless motor and a VXL-3m brushless ESC, both scaled down versions of the Velineon 3500kv brushless motor and VXL-3s brushless ESC used in Traxxas' 1/10 scale brushless vehicles. Some of the inevitable sacrifices inherent with the smaller scale include the lack of the optional two-speed transmission, many rubber sealed components, and dual steering servos offered on the 1/10 scale version. Claimed top speeds depend on which battery packs are used. One 7.2 v NiMH pack will reach 30 mph. Two 7.2 v NiMH packs will reach 50 mph. One 3s 11.1v lipo pack will reach 50 mph.\n\nThe Summit VXL 1/16 was released on November 1, 2010. It is a smaller version of the 1/10 scale Summit without locking diffs, LED lights and dual steering servos. It is powered by a Velineon 380 4000kv brushless motor and a VXL-3m brushless ESC. Almost all of the major components are shared with the E-Revo VXL 1/16 with the exception of a few suspension parts, wheels, tires, body and bumpers.The claimed top speed is 25–40 mph depending on whether one or two battery packs are used. Optional front and rear LED lights are available, pre-drilled holes are located in the front and rear bumpers.\n\nReleased in late spring 2009, The Slash VXL 1/16 is Traxxas' 1/16 scale short-course electric race truck. Although it bears the same name as 1/10 scale Slash, the designs are completely different. The 1/10 scale Slash is based on the two-wheel drive stadium truck family chassis while the Slash VXL 1/16 is actually based on a scaled down version of the four-wheel drive Revo family chassis, similar to the one used on the E-Revo VXL 1/16, and it is really more like a scaled down, electric version of the Slayer. Almost all of the major components are shared with the E-Revo VXL 1/16 with the exception of a few suspension parts, wheels, tires, body and bumpers. The claimed top speed is 30–50 mph depending on whether one or two battery packs are used.\n\nThe Slash lineup of short course trucks are offered in two-wheel drive and 4X4 variations with brushed or brushless motors and a standard or Low-CG (low center of gravity) chassis.\n\n\nThe Traxxas Slash was introduced in 2008 and is a two-wheel drive 1/10 scale short course electric race truck. This Traxxas model comes Ready-To-Run (RTR). The Slash shares many of its parts with the Rustler, Stampede and Bandit. Differences include a raised chassis (though not as high as the Stampede's) that is also much longer, wider and rectangular, 4.3 inch (diameter) x 1.7 inch (width) all-terrain style tires mounted on 2.2/3.0 inch wheels (now a point in short course rc trucks), though first production runs did sell with the non-sc style wheel (2.2) traxxas believed it would save on production to use the 2.2/3.0 design from the slayer, with a 12mm hex. Out-of-the-box this car features a TITAN 12 turn motor. The 2.2/3.0 design was to clear the slayers revo-spec pillow ball suspension components, Traxxas high current battery connectors, metal transmission gears, new waterproof XL-5 ESC, Waterproof 2075 steering servo, 4 channel micro receiver, sealed water tight receiver box, adjustable camber links, rubber sealed ball bearings, nerf bars, hex hardware, light duty drive shaft yokes, new battery hold-downs, short-course truck style bumpers, progressive rate springs, and a wide short course truck style body that encompasses the tires are some of its features. The claimed top speed is about 20+MPH.\n\nA step up from the original Slash, this Slash model features Race Replica bodies. It features the Titan 12-Turn motor and XL-5 Electronic Speed Control as its power system. It also shares the same wheel/tire combo as the other Slash models.\n\nIn late 2014, Traxxas introduced its exclusive On-Board Audio system in the Slash OBA. Samples were taken from the full-size Traxxas short course race truck and used to create the intuitive sound that responds to your throttle inputs.\n\nThe Traxxas Slash VXL proved to be a very popular choice for beginner and advanced drivers alike. \nThe Slash VXL received a factory-installed Low-CG chassis and the Traxxas Stability Management (TSM) which dramatically improved the overall handling and performance across varying terrains and conditions. The TSM is especially noticeable in low-traction situations such as wet or slick concrete, loose dirt and gravel, and ice and snow.\n\nThe Slash VXL with On-Board Audio, Traxxas Stability Management, and factory-installed Low-CG chassis brought realistic sound and advanced handling to the Slash 2WD platform.\n\nFamed racer, Robby Gordon, who has raced behind the wheel in NASCAR, desert races such as the Baja 1000, and Dakar Rally had his Dakar racing rig turned into 1/10-scale by Traxxas in the form of the Robby Gordon Gordini Slash. The Gordini Slash is based on the Slash 2WD platform.\n\nIn the fall of 2011 Traxxas released a replica of the, then, Ford F-150 SVT Raptor. The Raptor is based on the award-winning Slash 2WD platform and features a realistic Ford Raptor body. In the fall of 2016, Traxxas released an updated version. Like the full-size Ford Raptor, the model dropped the SVT naming and was simply the 2017 Ford F-150 Raptor.\n\nThe Traxxas Nitro Slash made its debut in December 2013. It is a two-wheel drive platform using an aluminum chassis and the TRX 3.3 Racing Engine. Though it shares a few parts with existing two-wheel drive models, for the most part, it is an entirely different truck. It uses a single-speed transmission and features a larger fuel tank for extended run times.\n\n\nReleased in late 2009 the Traxxas Slash 4x4, a four-wheel drive one tenth scale short-course electric race truck and it features Traxxas' first all new one tenth scale platform since the Jato was introduced in 2005. Contrary to its name, the Slash 4x4 has almost no parts commonality with the two-wheel drive Slash, and the Slash VXL 1/16. The parts carried over from the two-wheel drive Slash to the Slash 4x4 are limited to the shocks, springs, and the rear drive shafts and axle carriers, otherwise, the Slash 4x4 is a completely new design from the ground up. Its central chassis is a semi rectangular unit molded from gray plastic featuring triangular reinforcements throughout. It also features a four-wheel independent unequal length double wishbone suspension with four oil filled coilover shocks and progressive rate springs in staggered lengths (\"long\" up front; \"XXlong\" in back). The new suspension will also be capable of mounting front and rear sway bars (available as a Traxxas accessory). It is powered by the same \"Velineon 3500\" 10 turn 3500kV brushless motor and \"Velineon VXL-3S\" non-waterproof 320 (rated burst) amp brushless ESC as the two-wheel drive family VXL models. In February 2010 all versions of VXL systems were sold as waterproof, however the Slash 4x4 does not bear the VXL moniker like Traxxas' other Velineon powered models. The driveline design is very different than that featured on any other Traxxas model. The motor is mounted longitudinally in the M4 layout driving a spur gear that directly turns (no transmission), via a Revo spec slipper clutch, the main one piece hollow aluminum drive shaft. The drive shaft sends power to the front and rear viscous limited slip differentials, which send power to the wheels through plastic telescoping half shafts. The Slash 4x4 features a similar exterior appearance to the two-wheel drive Slash, including a similar short course style body, bumpers, nerf bars, and wheels. Other notable features include scale replica BFGoodrich Mud-Terrain T/A tires with white lettering, 2.2 inch satin chrome beadlock style \"SCT\" wheels, a new heavy duty ball bearing steering system, digital waterproof high torque steering servo, Traxxas high current connectors, 2.4Ghz radio system, and hex hardware used throughout. With the stock motor/ESC combo the claimed top speed is 35 to 65+MPH depending on the battery and gearing used. Traxxas also advertises the Castle Creations Mamba Monster Brushless system (featured on the E-Revo/E-Maxx Brushless Edition and available as a Traxxas accessory) as a direct \"drop in\" replacement for the stock Velineon system, and it is claimed to be capable of powering the Slash 4x4 to speeds in excess of 80MPH.\n\nThe usual complement of genuine Traxxas accessories will be offered with the Slash 4x4 including a variety of aluminum upgrade parts, a center differential, CV joint half shafts, sway bars, a stronger clutch, the Mamba Monster Brushless system, and more.\n\nThe Slash 4X4 with Traxxas' exclusive On-Board Audio system and Traxxas Stability Management is the most recent rendition of the 4X4 model. It also comes stock with the Low-CG chassis that is seen in the Ultimate and Platinum and has been available in the Rally.\n\nThe Slash 4X4 Ultimate is a step up from the original Slash 4X4. The Ultimate utilizes the Low-CG chassis that was designed for the 4X4 platform. It also features a host of factory-installed accessories such as aluminum axle carriers and steering blocks, telemetry sensors, sway bars, and GTR shocks. The Slash 4X4 Ultimate was built to be the balance between race track competition and backyard fun.\n\nThis version of the Slash 4X4 Ultimate boasts the same features as the standard Ultimate, with the exception of the included LiPo battery.\nNot long after the standard Slash 4x4 was announced, a race-ready \"Platinum Edition\" was also announced. Much like the Revo Platinum Edition, it lacks a pre-painted body, but includes most of Traxxas' available accessories as stock equipment. New features include big-bore aluminum shocks, a center differential, aluminum hubs and axle carriers, blue anodized aluminum wheel nuts, front and rear sway bars, and racing compound tires.\n\nThe 1/10-scale Rally made its debut in late 2012. Though the Rally is not a truck, at all, its entire DNA is shared with the Slash 4X4 family. Chassis, suspension, power system, and drivetrain are all shared features making the Rally easy to work on and fun to drive.\n\nThe Rustler was first introduced in 1994 and is Traxxas' two-wheel drive 1/10 scale electric Stadium truck. Its design is very similar to earlier Traxxas stadium trucks. It featured a 4-wheel independent suspension with 4 coilover shocks and 2.2 inch wheels. It was powered by a \"Stinger\" 540 20 turn brushed motor and a 3-speed rotary mechanical speed control or a fully proportional XL-1 ESC. It had a claimed top speed of 24+MPH.\nIn 2006 Traxxas released the Rustler XL-5. It featured major changes including the new \"Titan 12T\" 550 12 turn brushed motor, the new XL-5 ESC, redesigned transmission, new tires mounted on larger 2.8 inch wheels, high torque steering servo, new ESC mount, Revo spec slipper clutch, select new gray colored parts, white springs, and a new paint scheme and graphics. It has a claimed top speed of 35+MPH.\n\nIn 2008 the Rustler XL-5 received the Rustler VXL body with a different paint scheme.\n\nIn 2007 Traxxas introduced the Rustler VXL. The new model had several improvements over the standard Rustler XL-5. The biggest one is its \"Velineon Brushless system\" which consists of a 10 turn 3500kV brushless motor and a 320 (rated burst) amp brushless ESC. Other features included Traxxas high current connectors with 12 gauge wire, hex hardware, rubber sealed ball bearings, adjustable camber links, black chrome wheels, steel transmission gears, strengthened differential yokes, digital high torque steering servo, fiberglass front suspension tie bar, and a new low profile body, paint scheme and graphics. The claimed top speed is 35 to 70+ mph depending on the battery and gearing setup.\n\nAs of 2009 both the Rustler XL-5 and Rustler VXL are now waterproof, featuring Traxxas' waterproof XL-5 ESC (waterproof VXL3s brushless ESC on the Rustler VXL), 4 channel micro receiver, watertight receiver box, and waterproof high torque steering servo (waterproof digital high torque steering servo on the Rustler VXL).\n\nThe Nitro Sport was introduced in 1998. It is powered by the Traxxas .15 engine and later the pro .15 engine It shared many parts with the Nitro Rustler. Differences included a unique body and a few simplified parts, used mostly in the interest of making the model more affordable. It is marketed as a beginner's nitro model.\n\nIn 2009, Traxxas introduced a further revised Nitro Sport which features the same 2.8 inch wheels and tires as the Nitro Rustler and a new body similar to the Nitro Rustler's with new paint and graphics.\n\nIn 2007, Traxxas released a revised Nitro Rustler 2.5 (model 4407). The new model featured bigger wheels (mounted on 2.8-inch rims), a 2.4 GHz radio system and new low profile Prographix painted bodies, and claimed a 50 mph top speed (using optional gears). The engine was the same EZ-Start 2 equipped TRX2.5 and but was eventually replaced with the better tuned 2.5R piston sleeve design.\n\nThe 4407 model has been replaced with the 4409 variant which sports all the same features except the 2.4 GHz radio which has been replaced with a Traxxas Top Qualifier two-channel FM unit, accompanied by a price drop. Body colors currently indicate the radio frequency channel of the Nitro Rustler as follows: Silver/Red is A2, Red/Silver is A4, Blue/Silver is A5 and Silver/Blue is A6.\nThis model has proved to be a very reliable and tough option when it comes to bashing and has a wide selection of aftermarket manufacturers offering stronger aluminum and composite chassis and suspension components, performance exhausts and more. On the other hand, some people argue that its handling is sub-par for circuit racing, although after-market can address this issue.\n\n\nThe Traxxas Bandit was first introduced in 1995 and is Traxxas' 1/10 scale two-wheel drive buggy. It shares most of its parts with the Rustler, including the central chassis, motor, speed controls, transmission (albeit with a different gear ratio), rear shocks and shock tower, and radio system. The differences include shorter front and rear suspension arms, camber and steering links, buggy style smaller diameter and narrower wheels and tires, and a buggy style body with rear wing.\n\nIn 2007, Traxxas released the Bandit XL-5. The new model featured all the same upgrades as the Rustler XL-5 except the wheels. The Bandit XL-5 featured larger diameter 2.2 inch wheels that were also wider and new tires to fit.\n\nLater in 2007 Traxxas released the Bandit VXL. It received all the same upgrades as the Rustler VXL except a new body. The Bandit VXL body is the same as the Bandit XL-5's, but with a new paint scheme and revised graphics. The claimed top speed is 35+ to 70+MPH depending on battery and gearing setup.\n\nAs of 2009, both the Bandit XL-5 and Bandit VXL are now waterproof, featuring Traxxas' waterproof XL-5 ESC (waterproof VXL3s brushless ESC on the Bandit VXL), 4 channel micro receiver, watertight receiver box, and waterproof high torque steering servo (waterproof digital high torque steering servo on the Bandit VXL).\n\nTraxxas added Traxxas Stability Management as a standard feature for the Bandit VXL in 2015. This feature helps to keep the Bandit VXL more stable and under control during low traction situations. It also allows the driver to push the Bandit harder while driving.\n\nIn 2006 Traxxas released the Jato (short for Jet Assisted Take Off and pronounced Jay-toe) 3.3. Changes include the use of Traxxas' larger and more powerful TRX 3.3 nitro engine, new wheels with street oriented \"Anaconda\" tires, standard front and rear sway bars, standard wheelie bar, new \"resonator\" tuned aluminum exhaust pipe and a new body paint scheme. The body was also slightly modified to accommodate the TRX 3.3's larger cooling head. It has a claimed top speed of 65+MPH.\n\n\nThe STAMPEDE was first introduced in 1994 and is Traxxas' two-wheel-drive 1/10-scale monster truck. It shares many components with the Rustler, including the front and rear suspension, wheels, motor, radio system, speed controls and transmission (albeit with a different gear ratio). The Stampede has several differences including a rectangular chassis that is raised above the front and rear suspension assemblies to increase center ground clearance, larger diameter \"Terra\" monster truck style tires, raised body mounts and a unique body and paint scheme. It had a claimed top speed of 23+MPH.\n\nIn 2006, Traxxas released the Stampede XL-5. It featured all the same upgrades as the Rustler XL-5 and a new paint scheme and graphics. It has a claimed top speed of 30+ MPH.\nIn 2008, the Stampede XL-5 received a new body similar to the Nitro Stampede (model 4109) body but with a different paint scheme.\n\nIn 2007, Traxxas released the Stampede VXL. It featured all the same upgrades as the rustler VXL except a new body. The Stampede VXL featured the same body as the Stampede XL-5 but with a new paint scheme and revised graphics. It has a claimed top speed between 30+ MPH and 65+MPH depending on battery and gear setups.\n\nAs of 2009, both the Stampede XL-5 and Stampede VXL are now waterproof, featuring Traxxas' waterproof XL-5 ESC (waterproof VXL3s brushless ESC on the Stampede VXL), four-channel micro receiver, watertight receiver box, and waterproof high torque steering servo (waterproof digital high torque steering servo on the Stampede VXL).\n\nIn 2015, Traxxas increased the performance capability of the Stampede VXL by adding Traxxas Stability Management as a standard feature.\n\nIn 2015, Traxxas released the Skully and Craniac models. Based on the durable and popular Stampede 2WD platform, Skully and Craniac literally brought character to the tried and true platform.\n\nThe Nitro Stampede was first introduced in 1996 and it is Traxxas' small 1/10-scale two-wheel -rive monster truck. The Nitro Stampede shares many parts with the Nitro Rustler, including the TRX Pro.15 nitro engine (initially), wheels and many suspension components. Differences include a unique raised central chassis for increased center ground clearance, raised body mounts larger diameter \"Terra\" monster truck style tires, a unique body, paint and graphics, and rear exit dual outlet exhaust (unique among Traxxas models).\n\nIn 2007, Traxxas released a revised Nitro Stampede. It featured new tires mounted on larger 2.8-inch wheels, select gray parts, white springs, rubber sealed ball bearings, and a new body with new paint and graphics. It has a claimed top speed of 33+MPH, making it Traxxas' slowest nitro vehicle.\n\nIn December 2013, Traxxas released a model of the Stampede that was four-wheel-drive brushed version. It has a top speed of about 30 mph.This model was released after the VXL version.\n\nThe Stampede 4X4 VXL was released in late December 2009. It featured a similar modular-simplistic design that was being used in the Slash 4X4. It also came with the Velineon Brushless Power system.\nIn 2015, Traxxas released the next installment in the Stampede 4X4 family. This model featured the same setup as the Stampede 4X4 VXL, but was given the new Traxxas Stability Management.\n\nThe Telluride 4X4 was released in mid-2013 as an adventure-trail rig. It was based on the Stampede 4X4 platform. However, the Telluride features shorter suspension arms, short course-style wheels and tires, and a new Jeep-like body. It uses the Titan 12-turn brushed motor and XL-5 electronic speed control.\n\nCurrently, the TRX-4 is the only scale crawler.\n\nThe first TRX-4 model has a very detailed licensed Land Rover Defender 110 body. It comes with mounts for headlights, tail lights, in-fender rock lights, a scale bumper with winch mount, and scale accessories (including a spare tire, a jack, and a gas can) .\n\nTactical\n\nThe second TRX-4 model uses the Tactical body (that Traxxas designed) and tactical wheels (also comes with a spare tire and jack).\n\nWhile not nearly as vast a selection as the all-terrain offerings, Traxxas does offer choices tailored for on-road use. Each of the on-road offerings boasts speeds that approach or exceed highway speeds.\n\nThe Traxxas Nitro 4-tec was first introduced in 1998 and is Traxxas' four-wheel drive nitro touring car. It was powered by Traxxas' Pro.15 nitro engine and featured a two-speed automatic transmission and a belt driven four-wheel drive system. Other notable features were a 4-wheel independent suspension and aluminum chassis.\n\nIn 2006 Traxxas released the Nitro 4-tec 3.3. The new model featured Traxxas' new, larger and more powerful TRX 3.3 nitro engine. It also featured select gray parts, white springs, a new \"resonator\" tuned pipe, hex hardware, new receiver box, and a new paint scheme and revised graphics. The claimed top speed is 70+ MPH, making it Traxxas' fastest nitro vehicle, but Traxxas offers several weight saving aluminum and carbon fiber accessory parts that could make it even faster.discontinued.\n\nReleased in 2012, the Funny Car is a straight-line R/C dragster. It is powered by the ET-3s brushless power system developed by Castle Creations. On a 3S LiPo battery, it is quoted to reach 70 mph. It comes with a Traxxas TQi 2.4 GHz radio system. Scale design features include a tube-frame chassis, lift-up body, and burnout, stage, and launch modes.\n\n\nThe XO-1 is an on-road RTR 1/7 scale electric \"supercar\" that is designed to exceed 100 mph out of the box. To achieve this, Traxxas developed aerodynamic components to improve stability and reduce drag, and also worked with Castle Creations to create a more powerful custom ESC and motor. Also, Traxxas developed a new transmitter for it, the TQi 2.4 GHz, which is built with a dock for an iPhone or iPod touch to enable in-depth, real-time monitoring of driving conditions. An iPhone or iPod touch with the Traxxas Link application is required to unlock the 100 mph top speed. Without being unlocked with an Apple device, the car will not go 100 mph. The name \"XO\" is taken from the slogan for the car, \"Experts only\". The XO-1 was released in late January, 2012 and has a suggested retail price of $699. In 2014, Traxxas updated the XO-1 with bolder graphics. At 27\" long and 12\" wide, it is the largest Traxxas electric vehicle.\n\n4-tec 2.0 vxl\nThe all-new 4-Tec 2.0 VXL chassis provides the ultimate high speed driving experience. The high-tech chassis keeps weight positioned as low as possible for a crisp, responsive feel. The modular interlocking design allows easy maintenance while providing unprecedented rigidity and tight tolerances. The waterproof VXL-3s electronic speed control channels massive power to the Velineon® brushless motor for four wheel tire-spinning acceleration and incredible 70+mph* top speed. A finely tuned suspension keeps the wheels glued to the pavement and Traxxas Stability Management® (TSM) provides lightning-quick corrections to keep you in control. Grab the transmitter, rip full throttle, and hold on! The Traxxas 4-Tec 2.0 VXL delivers a high speed thrill ride like you’ve never experienced.\n\nThere are currently only two marine radio-controlled models being offered from Traxxas.\n\nTraxxas first introduced the Blast in 1995 and it is a single-drive radio-controlled boat. It is a race boat configuration with a long, very sleek, high performance \"modified V\" hull. It is powered by one water-cooled \"Stinger\" 20 turn 540 sized brushed motor and an air-cooled (with heat sink) Nautica 8.4 volt ESC. Power is sent directly (no reduction gears) to a single surface piercing prop. It is steered via a servo controlling the rudder/prop.\n\nIn 2008, Traxxas released a revised Blast. New features included a new waterproof version of the Nautica ESC, a waterproof high torque steering servo, a new water sealed receiver box, a new upper hull (with a sleek enclosed cockpit replacing the old open one), Traxxas high current battery connectors, new motor labeling, and new graphics.\n\n\nReleased in December 2010, the Traxxas Spartan is a new single drive Radio-controlled boat. The Spartan represents Traxxas' first all-new boat design in several years. Like the Villain series, it is a sport/power boat configuration with a long, sleek \"deep V\" style hull. Unlike the Villain series, the Spartan is significantly longer (by 9.8 inches) and has a slightly wider beam (by 1.25 inches), which combine to give the Spartan a much sleeker overall profile. The Spartan also has an abundance of modern features which set it apart from earlier Traxxas boats. The most noticeable is Traxxas' new marine version of its Castle Powered Velineon brushless system, consisting of the new VXL-6s brushless ESC, and Velineon 540XL (1410 castle motor)brushless motor. Both the ESC and the motor are water-cooled, with the motor featuring a unique sealed composite water jacket that allows cooling water to directly contact the motor case, rather than the simple coiled metal tubing water jackets used on other Traxxas boats. The drive system is also a departure from the steerable outdrive system (the prop and rudder are one unit and are steered together) traditionally used on Traxxas boats. Instead, power on the Spartan is routed via direct drive (no reduction gears) to a single fixed surface piercing prop and steering is controlled by an aluminum rudder operated by a high torque waterproof servo. The Spartan is also uses Traxxas' 2.4GHz radio system (a first on Traxxas boats) with a 5-channel receiver located inside a watertight box. Other notable features include stainless steel trim tabs and turn fins (which help improve stability and turning performance), Traxxas high current battery connectors, 12 gauge power wire, and stainless steel hex hardware. The claimed topspeed is with the included dual 8.4 volt NiMH batteries. However, the top speed rises to with optional double 3S LiPo battery packs, which Traxxas claims as the fastest top speed for any RTR (ready to race) radio controlled boat.\n\nA mid-Spring release in 2016, the Traxxas M41 Widebody is a catamaran-style boat that was based on the full-size M41 that was designed and built by Dave's Custom Boats. The electronics on the Traxxas M41 were the same that can be found in the Spartan. The M41 did come with Traxxas Stability Management, and was only available with a paint scheme that was inspired by the Traxxas Funny Car that Courtney Force drove in 2015.\n\nThe Traxxas Aton (pronounced ay-tawn) was released in late 2015. Billed first as an \"easy to use aerial photo and video assistant\" the Aton became known more as a sport quad for its power and ability to perform tricks. The Aton did come with a fixed mount that enabled the use of a GoPro or other similar action sports camera. Later, the Aton+ was released. This version of the quad featured a 2-axis gimbal for smoother, clearer images and video. Both quads featured three user modes, six-axis stabilization, Return-to-Home, Air Brakes, and the ability to record flight data. \nAlso released with the Aton was the Traxxas Flight Link app. This app worked with the quad giving the user the ability to make adjustments to the quad, change settings, and view telemetry data.\n\nLaTrax was founded in 1974 by Jim Jenkins, the father of Traxxas owner and CEO Mike Jenkins. Today, the LaTrax brand is backed by Traxxas and currently produces conveniently sized 1/18-scale R/C models that are priced under $200.\"LaTrax delivers the perfect combination of great value, leading performance, ease of use, and award-winning support that make radio control fun for everybody.\" LaTrax models come fully assembled from the factory with batteries and charger included.\n\nIn mid-2013, the LaTrax Rally made its debut. It was also the first new product to come from the LaTrax reboot. At just over 10-inches long and 6-inches wide, the Rally can fit easily into a backpack. It features waterproof electronics, a 2.4 GHz radio system, and an all-wheel drive drivetrain. The rally is waterproof and is claimed to be a type of drifting R/C.\n\nThe 1/18-scale LaTrax Teton monster truck was released in early 2014. Though very similar to the previously released Rally, featuring a similar drivetrain, waterproof electronics, and radio system, the Teton does have longer suspension arms and shocks.\n\nBased on the full-size trucks in the Speed Energy Formula Off-Road racing series, the LaTrax SST debuted in late 2014. Initially featuring paint schemes for Traxxas athletes Sheldon Creed and Keegan Kincaid, the orange Speed Energy paint scheme of Robby Gordon's truck was later added. The SST shares the same DNA as the Rally and Teton with its chassis, drivetrain, electronics, and radio system.\n\nLaTrax made its first venture into R/C aircraft with the LaTrax Alias. Released in late 2013, the Alias is more of a sport-quad that's designed for aerobatics right out of the box. Like other LaTrax vehicles, and models from parent company Traxxas, the Alias is ready to fly and comes with everything you would need all in one box.\nThree different flight modes allow the Alias to be used by first-time pilots as well as veterans. Available in four colors, LaTrax also offers a host of accessories to customize. It's also easy to work on.\n\nThe following is a list of vehicles, some with details on past versions, that have either been discontinued or superseded by improved models.\n\nT-Maxx uses a single plate aluminum chassis, braced underneath by beam supports. The suspension used a fully independent double A-arm design, supported by eight coil over shocks, two on each corner. The drive system consisted of a mid-mounted Pro .15 nitro engine and a mid-mounted two-speed transmission driving a permanent four-wheel drive system with no center differential. The tires were massive 5.75 x 3.5 inch \"chevron\" style tires mounted on 3.2 inch wheels.\n\nThe T-Maxx made its debut in 1999, taking the R/C hobby and industry by storm.\n\nIn 2002, the T-Maxx 2.5 was introduced. Revisions included lengthened suspension arms and Traxxas' new, more powerful, TRX 2.5 nitro engine.\n\nIn 2006, Traxxas introduced a revised T-Maxx 2.5, in an addition to the new T-Maxx 2.5R and T-Maxx 3.3. The revised T-Maxx 2.5 featured minor changes that included new gray colored parts and redesigned bulkheads and differential housings. It has a claimed top speed of 40+MPH.\n\nThe T-Maxx 2.5R featured Traxxas' TRX 2.5R nitro engine, a new driveline similar to the Revo's, with the Torque-Control slipper clutch on the spur gear. It also included new gray colored parts and redesigned bulkheads and differential housings. The T-Maxx 2.5R included the Optidrive reverse system (originally only on the Revo) instead of the purely mechanical reverse on the original. The 3.2 mm thick aluminum chassis on the T-Maxx 2.5 was replaced with a stronger 4 mm chassis. The driveshafts, pivot balls, and ball bearings were all sealed with blue rubber. The old 3.2 inch wheels were replaced with new, larger 3.8 inch satin finish wheels with lower profile \"chevron\" tires. A new body paint scheme was also included. It has a claimed top speed of 40+MPH.\n\nThe SportMaxx model was introduced in 2003 and was based on the original T-Maxx 2.5. A two-wheel drive set up (which simply omitted the differential and drivetrain to the front wheels) was used in the interest of saving weight. A forward only, single speed transmission was used for the same purpose. Other differences included a different body with unique paint and graphics and different wheels. It has since been discontinued, although any T-Maxx can essentially be converted to a SportMaxx by installing Traxxas' single speed transmission accessory and removing the drivetrain to the front wheels.\n\nThe S-Maxx (or Stadium Maxx) was introduced in 2004 and is essentially the same as the Sport Maxx, but it featured a unique racing body, paint and graphics, pre-glued dirt track oriented tires and a two-speed transmission. It has a claimed top speed of 40+MPH.\n\nThis special edition Maxx Truck is only available at Hobbytown USA outlets.\n\nThe S-maxx is now available with the TRX 3.3 engine and has a top speed of 45+ mph.\n\nThe Revo family consists of several models originally based around the Revo.\n\nThe Revo was introduced in 2004 as a complete redesign of a one tenth scale monster truck chassis with a more advanced and reliable design than the T-Maxx. The Revo has become popular in racing, and is also well suited to \"bashing\" environments such as a backyard or a construction site. Notable characteristics include the inboard push-rod suspension system with new \"GTR\" shocks and springs, a complex \"monocoque\"-type aluminum chassis which lowers the vehicle's center of gravity, a stronger transmission that features electronically controlled reverse, sealed limited slip differentials, rubber sealed pivot balls, drive shafts and ball bearings, 3.8 inch wheels and all-terrain style \"Talon\" tires, and an updated version of Traxxas' TRX 2.5 engine, the TRX 2.5R. It has a claimed top speed of 40+MPH.\n\nA new Revo version was launched alongside the T-Maxx 3.3 in 2006, with Traxxas' new, more powerful TRX 3.3 engine. Because of the demands of Revo owners, the chassis was lengthened 30 mm for more stability, and the motor mount area was braced to prevent it from bending. Other minor changes included a longer version of the body with a new paint scheme to accompany the wheelbase stretch, and new wheels. New add-on upgrades were released, including a center differential, that helps transfer power between the front and rear differentials to increase handling, and a rear-braking module that must be used with the center-differential. It has claimed top speed of 45+MPH.\n\nIn April 2008, Traxxas released the limited edition Revo Platinum. It came stock with most of Traxxas upgrades and tuning parts normally available as accessories for the standard Revo 3.3. It was intended as a factory racing version of the standard Revo 3.3.\n\nLater in 2008, Traxxas released a revised version of the Revo 3.3. It incorporated some of the features seen on the Revo platinum, including a polished \"Resonator\" dual chamber exhaust pipe, dual stage air filter, larger 150 cc fuel tank, teflon coated aluminum \"GTR\" shocks with titanium nitride shafts, 17 mm splined wheel hubs. As is typical of a new Traxxas model, the revised Revo 3.3 received a new paint scheme.\n\n\nE-Revo has been tested with a 6S (6 Cell) lipo battery which in return produces amazingly fast speeds up to 65+mph. E-Revo is without a doubt one of the best traxxas remote control cars.\n\n\nThe two-wheel drive family consists of a series of nitro and electric models that use a two-wheel drive platform.\n\nRustler\n\nTraxxas first introduced the Nitro Rustler in 1997. It is a 1/10 scale two-wheel drive stadium truck. Although they shared the same name, the Rustler and Nitro Rustler shared few parts (many parts were similar though). It was powered by Traxxas' Pro.15 nitro engine.\n\nIn 2003, Traxxas released the Nitro Rustler 2.5. The main change was Traxxas' new TRX 2.5 nitro engine. Other changes included new 2.2-inch chrome wheels and paint scheme.\n\n\nIn 2006, Traxxas introduced a revised Nitro Sport. It featured new wheels, select gray colored parts, white springs, rubber sealed ball bearings, and a new paint scheme and graphics. It has a claimed top speed of 38+MPH.\n\nIn 2005 Traxxas released the Jato (pronounced Jay-toe) 2.5 (usually referred to as simply \"Jato\"), which was a completely new design that was based on the 1/10 scale rear wheel drive stadium truck format popular in the industry, and it replaced the Nitro Rustler as Traxxas' high end stadium truck. It was powered by the same TRX 2.5 nitro engine as the Nitro Rustler but had many new high tech features, some borrowed from the Revo, that set it apart. One of the new features was a sophisticated 2-speed automatic transmission, that improved acceleration and top speed over the single speed Nitro Rustler. A new suspension design was another new feature. It included new \"GTR\" shocks and springs, which were borrowed from the Revo, but used in a traditional configuration instead of the Revo's push-rod configuration. The suspension also included front and rear mounting points for optional sway bars, which were offered as Traxxas accessories in three different thicknesses. The suspension was also fully adjustable for camber, caster, toe, anti-squat, and ride height. Other notable features included 2.8 inch wheels and tires, a sealed limited slip differential, rubber sealed drive shafts and ball bearings, steering assembly, Revo spec slipper clutch, and hex hardware. It has a claimed top speed of 55+MPH.\n\n\nNeither Jato, as it comes out of the box, is legal to race alongside more traditional stadium trucks in industry sanctioned events due to its stock two-speed transmission, but many local clubs allow it to race. The Jato can be made race legal by replacing the 2-speed, wheels, and the engine with appropriate replacements offered by Traxxas or 3rd party manufacturers.\n\nIn 2005, Traxxas offered the Bandit with the XL-1 ESC in addition to the existing 3-speed rotary mechanical speed control.\n\nLater in 1998 Traxxas released the limited edition Nitro 4-tec pro. This was a stripped down race version. It did not include a radio system, servos, or even an engine (owners could install the Traxxas or aftermarket components of their choosing) and the body came unpainted. The model did however come with most of the then available Traxxas accessories, including many carbon fiber pieces, and aftermarket Pro-Line \"V-Rage\" performance tires.\n\nIn 2003 Traxxas released the Nitro 4-tec 2.5. The new model featured Traxxas' new TRX 2.5 nitro engine and a new paint scheme and revised graphics. The claimed top speed is 60+MPH.\n\nTraxxas first introduced the 4-tec in 1998 and it is Traxxas' 1/10 four-wheel drive scale electric touring car. The 4-tec shares a few parts with the Nitro 4-tec, like the shocks, springs, wheels and the belt drive four-wheel drive system is similar. The chassis however is all nylon composite instead of aluminum and the transmission is a single speed unit. The 4-tec is powered by a \"Stinger\" 540 20 turn motor and uses either a 3-speed rotary mechanical speed control or a fully proportional XL-1 ESC (first offered in 2005). The claimed top speed is 24+MPH. It has since been discontinued.\n\n\nThe XO-1 is the worlds fastest ready to run (RTR) R/C car. The motor in the XO-1 is built by Traxxas and Castle Creations. This car has a claimed top speed of 100+ MPH.\n\n\nCheaper, brushed motor, versions of the 1/16 E-Revo, 1/16 Summit and 1/16 Slash, utilizing \"Titan 380\" motors and XL-2.5 ESCs, were added later in 2009 & 2010.\n\nThe Grave Digger 1/16, released in January 2012, is a scaled down version of the Monster Jam replicas Grave Digger 1/10 scale monster truck. Unlike the earlier Traxxas 1/16 models there is only a brushed version of this model; This is also the only 1/16 model that is not 4 wheel drive. This Traxxas model comes with Monster Jam tires, Monster Jam wheels, a 6 cell NIMH battery, a Titan 12T 550 brushed motor, an XL-2.5 electronic speed control, and a small backpack for traveling (as well as a way of selling the vehicle to a younger collector, who could use the backpack for school). A velineon brushless system can be installed to make the model travel at about 40 mph with two batteries, but with a brushed motor the claimed top speed is about 20 mph.\n\nReleased in mid – October 2010, based on the 1/16 Revo VXL. Claimed top speed of 50+ mph. It is powered by a Velineon 380 brushless motor and a VXL-3m brushless ESC.\nA version of the rally was a Ken Block Gymkhana Fiesta, featuring green wheels, green push-rods and turnbuckles, and the classy look of Ken Block's Fiesta.\n\nThe QR-1 and DR-1 launched together at the end of 2012, Traxxas's first flying models take advantage of recent improvements in battery and motion-sensing technology which now allow useful amounts of time in the air and the automation of basic flight stability. They use\nlithium-ion polymer (LiPo) batteries, and micro-sized gyroscopes and accelerometers similar to those developed for mobile phones and game controllers to help the pilot fly.\n\nThe quadcopter is mechanically simpler than the helicopter, but has some sophisticated electronics on board to provide stability in flight. The QR-1 has four constant-pitch propellers, which rotate at different speeds to control the movements of the aircraft. The propellors' speed is decided in detail by firmware on a circuit board in the aircraft, which compares the control inputs from the pilot with measurement of what the aircraft is actually doing in the air provided by the tiny gyroscopes and accelerometers also on the board. This arrangement allows automatic response to sudden gusts, and helps the pilot when in \"expert mode\" to do flips and barrel rolls.\n\nThe Traxxas DR-1 has a dual-rotor coaxial design, with a flybar above, which together with the automatic gyro stabilisation make for a helicopter in the easy-to-fly beginner's category. It comes with a 2.4Ghz spread-spectrum radio transmitter, so you don't have to worry about interference from anyone else flying nearby.\n\nThe following is a list of previous-generation boats.\n\nThe Traxxas Nitro Vee was first introduced in 1995 and it is Traxxas' only nitro-powered Radio-controlled boat. It is a sport/power boat configuration with a long, sleek \"deep V\" style hull. It is powered by the marine version of Traxxas' Pro.15 nitro engine, which features a water-cooled head instead of the land version's air-cooled head. Power is sent directly (no reduction gears) to a single surface piercing prop. It is steered via a servo controlling the rudder/prop. Like all Traxxas nitro RTRs, the Nitro Vee features Traxxas' EZ Start electric starter/glow plug warmer. Other notable features include an inline clutch, to aid in low speed maneuvering and stop the prop from spinning while the engine is idling (useful for safety if the boat is out of water), and Traxxas' patented \"Return to shore\" system. It has since been discontinued.\n\nTraxxas first introduced the Villain IV in 1989 and it was Traxxas's first RTR Radio-controlled boat. It is a sport/power boat configuration with a long, sleek \"deep V\" style hull. It was powered by two air-cooled (a water cooling kit utilizing water jackets that circulated water around the motors was available as a Traxxas accessory) \"Stinger\" 20 turn 540 size brushed motors and an air-cooled (with heat sink) BXL-1 ESC. Power was sent down twin shafts (one for each motor) through a 2:1 gear reduction drive to twin counter rotating surface piercing props. It was steered via a servo controlling both props/rudders. One feature unique among Traxxas boats was the Villain IV's realistic scale details, including realistic graphics, chrome trim and steering wheel (non functional of course). The Villain IV has since been discontinued.\n\nTraxxas first introduced the Villain EX in 2003 and it is a twin drive electric Radio-controlled boat. It features many of the same parts as the Villan IV including the hull, twin drive system, radio system (except the transmitter) and steering. Differences include larger fan cooled (the water cooling accessory is still available) \"Titan\" 21 turn 550 sized brushed motors, a new water-cooled 14.4 volt EVX Marine (instead of the land EVX's air cooling) ESC, Traxxas' \"TQ\" pistol grip transmitter, and a new sealed, watertight electronics box. The Villain EX also features new graphics (which are flashy and colorful rather than realistic as on the Villain IV) and lacks the scale details found on the Villain IV.\n\nIn 2007 the Villain EX received a new water-cooled 14.4 volt EVX-2 Marine ESC (not to be confused with the air-cooled 16.8 volt EVX-2 Waterproof ESC used on Traxxas land vehicles) featuring Traxxas high current battery connectors. It has since been discontinued.\n\nTraxxas first introduced the Villain in 2001 and it is a twin drive electric Radio-controlled boat. It is almost identical to the Villain EX, with the only major differences being the motors and ESC, and it is essentially an updated Villain IV. The Villain is powered by the same air-cooled (with the Villain IV/Villain EX water cooling accessory kit still available) \"Stinger\" 20 turn 540 sized brushed motors as the Villain IV. Instead of the Villain IV's air-cooled BXL-1 ESC, the Villain features the new water-cooled XL-10M (marine) 8.4 volt ESC. The Villain features slightly different graphics than the Villain EX. It has since been discontinued.\n\nTraxxas was once a professional line of racing vehicles, but now has retired all of the \"TRX Pro Series\" line of vehicles.\n\nA entry-level one-tenth scale, electric, rear-wheel-drive monster truck. It had four-wheel independent suspension and eight oil filled shocks. It came with an early 90s regular cab Chevrolet truck body. The three versions produced include the original with white tub, white shocks, and gold aluminum plates; the second version (circa 1994) with white tub, black shocks, and black aluminum plates, and the third and final version which was all black plastic and blue aluminum plates.\n\nA entry level touring chassis, featuring a truck body. This model had very few adjustment options, and was meant for hobbyists not likely to customize or tune the vehicle. This vehicle was available as an electric model only. The Spirit utilizes the same chassis as The Cat, except The Cat was an off-road buggy which also had the same intention. The chassis design was a modified version of a toy-grade Nikko chassis.\n\nTraxxas's first RTR Nitro truck. The Traxxas' Nitro Hawk, though already a legacy model, is highly collectible and are still being sold at toy auctions till this time. The highest recorded bid, in 2011, sold for $360.00, much more than the price of a new one.\nThe Traxxas Nitro Hawk was a two-wheel drive stadium truck with an all-aluminum chassis that came with four different engines, the Image .12, the TRX12, TRX15 and Pro15 in a special long crankshaft configuration. The engine assembly was different from other traxxas models, having the clutch bell with the pinion facing against the engine, and the flywheel secured with a nut at the end of the crank with the clutch shoes facing inward. Another particularity was its shoe brake system that applied braking force on the clutch bell itself instead of having a brake disc mounted on the transmission. This truck also featured all-aluminum shocks with collars to adjust spring load and 2.2-inch lite dish wheels with pro trax ribbed tires at the front and spiked ones at the back. Common upgrades were the 360 Stinger exhaust and sturdier shock towers, since the stock fiber ones were soft.\nFirst editions had white plastic parts, body and a clear/transparent hard plastic top, purposely to be painted with the hobbyist-preferred color and are the most collectable ones.\n\nThe Traxxas SRT had a zero-flex fiberglass chassis reinforced by a battery box and a fiberglass front deck. It had a metal gear transmission, and an aluminum motor plate. It came as an unassembled kit and was discontinued in 1998.\n\nThe TRX-1 was a single decked, graphite chassis professional racing buggy.\n\nCurrently, as with all of recent Traxxas products, all Traxxas engines are now designed in house at their Plano, Texas headquarters and manufactured in their own manufacturing facility located in Taiwan.\n\nTraxxas has equipped most of its newer models with engines derived from the TRX 2.5. The current engine lineup consists of the older TRX Pro .15, the TRX 2.5, 2.5R, and the newest TRX 3.3 racing engine. The 2.5 represents the displacement in cubic centimeters, equivalent to .15 cubic inches. Although the displacement is roughly the same, Traxxas designed the 2.5 from the ground up with a refined crankcase, cooling head, port timing, and other components to produce more power, in line with expensive aftermarket offerings. The engine is physically taller, and the exhaust manifold is a circular port on the rear of the engine. In Spring 2006, Traxxas introduced the TRX 3.3 small block. The 3.3 cc displacement is about equal to 0.201 in³. The Traxxas 3.3 still maintains the same engine mounting dimensions as the 2.5, allowing the 3.3 to serve as a drop in replacement for 2.5 equipped Traxxas vehicles.\n\nTraxxas' first engines were released in 1992. The Image 12 was a standard rebranded engine of average performance. The advent of the later TRX .12 engines were a dramatic improvement over the Image .12 and subsequently the vehicles Traxxas made increased in performance, quality and popularity.\n\nThe TRX .12's were entry level engines, and put out mediocre performance by today's standards. Later, Traxxas introduced the TRX .15 and Pro .15 engines. These produced slightly more power and accepted the EZ-Start system. Traxxas named their early engines with the size in cubic inches, which is relatively common for US-made model engines. They were still considered entry level, and were often replaced with more powerful after market engines when they wore out. Traxxas' boats used a version of the TRX Pro .15 which had a water cooling cylinder head. The Nitro Stampede two-wheel drive monster truck, Nitro Sport two-wheel drive truck, and Nitro Vee boat model still use the Pro .15.\n\nTraxxas brought on-board electric starting systems into widespread use for nitro fuel powered models. Most of their nitro-powered models carry this \"EZ Start\" system. It consists of a small electric motor geared to a rear engine shaft and a wiring harness to start the nitro engine in a way similar to full size automobiles. The wiring has leads to the electric motor and the electrically heated glow plug. The starter battery is kept separate from the model in a wand-like device. The end of the wand is inserted into the vehicle's receiver, and then the user presses the button on the wand. The electric motor turns the rear shaft until ignition, or until the wand's battery drains. Traxxas has also released pull start systems for their engines, so that the EZ Start system can be replaced if the owner so chooses. Some models may be started with starter or \"bump\" boxes, allowing the installation of engines with no on-car starting method, no rear shaft (and no leaking shaft seal)\n\nA patented system employed on Traxxas's boats, the return to shore system provides similar user security to that of a fail safe on a nitro car or truck. The return to shore system is an electric motor that drives the propeller so that a nitro boat can be driven to shore, in the event that the engine cuts out during use. This operates by applying the brake which activates gearing that couples an electric motor to the propeller shaft of a nitro-powered boat. This enables the boat to be returned to shore.\n\nTraxxas is a top retailer in the hobby level radio control market. Their designs make many customizations and modifications possible. The E-Maxx has been used as a base chassis by the US Troops in post-invasion Iraq as a bomb scout According to the US Military the troops built this from the ground up; however, American troops clearly used the chassis and other inexpensive off-the-shelf E/T-Maxx parts. It is used to scout for roadside bombs, which were never spotted, several trucks where destroyed before the army quit the project.\n"}

The radio station began services in the early 1960s. The Abroad Organization Committee appointed Aziz al-Haj to run the radio broadcasts. Since the party was underground and persecuted in Iraq, this radio station was virtually the only organ with which the party could reach out to people inside Iraq. However, the political movements of the Abroad Organization Committee was severely restricted by the conditions of their exile in the Socialist Bloc. While the Iraqi Communist Party developed a more critical approach to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Voice of the Iraqi People broadcast were fully in line with the Soviet positions.\n"}

Typical competitions included PC and Amiga demos and intros, handmade and ray traced graphics, music and surprise competitions (where theme and rules are announced around two hours prior the deadline).\n\nThe first edition took place at the Université de Mons-Hainaut in Mons from 29 to 31 October 1994. It was organized by \"Antares\" and \"Babylon 5\". Ten demos entered the PC competition but only two Amiga productions were presented. \"Necronomicon\" by \"Imagine\" won the PC competition. Unusually for a demoparty, a \"Doom\" tournament was held at \"Wired '94\".\n\nOne year later, \"Wired '95\" was held from 3–5 November 1995 at the same place and organized by \"Antares\", Imphobia and TFL-TDV. This time, no more Amiga competitions were held, \"Wired\" became a PC only party, but additional categories were introduced: 4k intro (which previously occurred as a surprise competition only) and ANSI. The PC demo section saw 17 entries and the victory of \"Valhalla\" with \"Soltice\". Another remarkable production was the 64k intro winner: \"Magic Carpet\" by Keen Like Frogs. This group managed to code an engine similar to the one used \"Magic Carpet\" in 64 kilobytes only, complete with textures and music. A French TV channel also chose this event to record a report on demoscene.\n\nFor its '96 edition, which took place from 1–3 November 1996, the place changed to a sport-hall in Wasmes, a little town near Mons. Organizers were Imphobia and Antares.\nIn this new location, the event gathered about 600 demosceners from all over Europe. Again, the 64k intro competition revealed a ground breaking production: \"Paper\" by Psychic Link & \"ACME\"; this prefigured an effect that would become known as cellshading. This edition introduced the Coca-Cola drinking contest, where each contestant would have to drink a 1.5 L bottle as fast as possible. \n\nIn 1997, the place stayed the same but the party date moved from winter to summer (being held on 18–20 July). Imphobia was joined by Bomb, Pulpe, Smash Designs and \"W.O.W.\" in its organizing efforts. This edition marked the return of Amiga and even C-64 competitions. The winning PC 64k intro stand out again. This time, it was \"Jizz\" by The Black Lotus introducing the generated objects and textures system to the PC world. The Magic Carpet engine was coded in 4k this time by Dawn of a New Age. For the first time, a 100kb PC game competition was held.\n\n\"Wired '98\" took place on 17–19 July 1998 and attracted 800 attenders. Organizing team was composed of Imphobia, Melting Pot, Pulpe, W.O.W. and Role. Since it was announced as the final edition, a very strange atmosphere overwhelmed the party mood. Only a few Amiga productions showed up. The PC demo competition was won by \"Cocoon\" with the heavy \"Syndrome\" demo, and the PC 64K intro competition was won by \"Quad\" with \"Theta\".\n\nA \"Wired\" was to be held in Brussels in 2000, but the idea was eventually dropped.\n\nA demoparty called \"Rewired\" was planned for 2008 in Belgium, but there is no link with the original \"Wired\" (a different place, different organizers and a much smaller capacity of 250 people).\n\n"}
