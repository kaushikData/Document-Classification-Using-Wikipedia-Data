{"id": "21504235", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21504235", "title": "Actor", "text": "Actor\n\nAn actor is a person who portrays a character in a performance (also actress; see below). The actor performs \"in the flesh\" in the traditional medium of the theatre or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is (), literally \"one who answers\". The actor's interpretation of their role—the art of acting—pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \"playing themselves\", as in some forms of experimental performance art.\n\nFormerly, in ancient Greece and Rome, the medieval world, and the time of William Shakespeare, only men could become actors, and women's roles were generally played by men or boys. After the English Restoration of 1660, women began to appear on stage in England. In modern times, particularly in pantomime and some operas, women occasionally play the roles of boys or young men.\n\nAfter 1660 in England, when women first started to appear on stage, the terms \"actor\" or \"actress\" were initially used interchangeably for female performers, but later, influenced by the French , \"actress\" became the commonly used term for women in theater and film. The etymology is a simple derivation from \"actor\" with added. When referring to groups of performers of both sexes, \"actors\" is preferred. \"Actor\" is also used before the full name of a performer as a gender-specific term.\n\nWithin the profession, the re-adoption of the neutral term dates to the post-war period of the 1950 and '60s, when the contributions of women to cultural life in general were being reviewed. When \"The Observer\" and \"The Guardian\" published their new joint style guide in 2010, it stated \"Use ['actor'] for both male and female actors; do not use actress except when in name of award, e.g. Oscar for best actress.\" The guide's authors stated that \"actress comes into the same category as authoress, comedienne, manageress, 'lady doctor', 'male nurse' and similar obsolete terms that date from a time when professions were largely the preserve of one sex (usually men).\" (See \"male as norm\"). \"As Whoopi Goldberg put it in an interview with the paper: 'An actress can only play a woman. I'm an actor – I can play anything. The UK performers' union Equity has no policy on the use of \"actor\" or \"actress\". An Equity spokesperson said that the union does not believe that there is a consensus on the matter and stated that the \"...subject divides the profession\". In 2009, the \"Los Angeles Times\" stated that \"Actress\" remains the common term used in major acting awards given to female recipients (e.g., Academy Award for Best Actress).\n\nWith regard to the cinema of the United States, the gender-neutral term \"player\" was common in film in the silent film era and the early days of the Motion Picture Production Code, but in the 2000s in a film context, it is generally deemed archaic. However, \"player\" remains in use in the theatre, often incorporated into the name of a theatre group or company, such as the American Players, the East West Players, etc. Also, actors in improvisational theatre may be referred to as \"players\".\n\nIn 2015, \"Forbes\" reported that \"...just 21 of the 100 top-grossing films of 2014 featured a female lead or co-lead, while only 28.1% of characters in 100 top-grossing films were female...\". \"In the U.S., there is an \"industry-wide [gap] in salaries of all scales. On average, white women get paid 78 cents to every dollar a white man makes, while Hispanic women earn 56 cents to a white male’s dollar, Black women 64 cents and Native American women just 59 cents to that.\" \"Forbes\"' analysis of US acting salaries in 2013 determined that the \"...men on Forbes’ list of top-paid actors for that year made 2 times as much money as the top-paid actresses. That means that Hollywood's best-compensated actresses made just 40 cents for every dollar that the best-compensated men made.\"\n\nThe first recorded case of a performing actor occurred in 534 BC (though the changes in calendar over the years make it hard to determine exactly) when the Greek performer Thespis stepped onto the stage at the \"Theatre Dionysus\" to become the first known person to speak words as a character in a play or story. Prior to Thespis' act, Grecian stories were only expressed in song, dance, and in third person narrative. In honor of Thespis, actors are commonly called \"Thespians\". The exclusively male actors in the theatre of ancient Greece performed in three types of drama: tragedy, comedy, and the satyr play. Western theatre developed and expanded considerably under the Romans. The theatre of ancient Rome was a thriving and diverse art form, ranging from festival performances of street theatre, nude dancing, and acrobatics, to the staging of situation comedies, to high-style, verbally elaborate tragedies.\n\nAs the Western Roman Empire fell into decay through the 4th and 5th centuries, the seat of Roman power shifted to Constantinople and the Byzantine Empire. Records show that mime, pantomime, scenes or recitations from tragedies and comedies, dances, and other entertainments were very popular. From the 5th century, Western Europe was plunged into a period of general disorder. Small nomadic bands of actors traveled around Europe throughout the period, performing wherever they could find an audience; there is no evidence that they produced anything but crude scenes. Traditionally, actors were not of high status; therefore, in the Early Middle Ages, traveling acting troupes were often viewed with distrust. Early Middle Ages actors were denounced by the Church during the Dark Ages, as they were viewed as dangerous, immoral, and pagan. In many parts of Europe, traditional beliefs of the region and time period meant actors could not receive a Christian burial.\n\nIn the Early Middle Ages, churches in Europe began staging dramatized versions of biblical events. By the middle of the 11th century, liturgical drama had spread from Russia to Scandinavia to Italy. The Feast of Fools encouraged the development of comedy. In the Late Middle Ages, plays were produced in 127 towns. These vernacular Mystery plays often contained comedy, with actors playing devils, villains, and clowns. The majority of actors in these plays were drawn from the local population. Amateur performers in England were exclusively male, but other countries had female performers.\n\nThere were a number of secular plays staged in the Middle Ages, the earliest of which is \"The Play of the Greenwood\" by Adam de la Halle in 1276. It contains satirical scenes and folk material such as faeries and other supernatural occurrences. Farces also rose dramatically in popularity after the 13th century. At the end of the Late Middle Ages, professional actors began to appear in England and Europe. Richard III and Henry VII both maintained small companies of professional actors. Beginning in the mid-16th century, Commedia dell'arte troupes performed lively improvisational playlets across Europe for centuries. Commedia dell'arte was an actor-centred theatre, requiring little scenery and very few props. Plays were loose frameworks that provided situations, complications, and outcome of the action, around which the actors improvised. The plays utilised stock characters. A troupe typically consisted of 13 to 14 members. Most actors were paid a share of the play's profits roughly equivalent to the sizes of their roles.\n\nRenaissance theatre derived from several medieval theatre traditions, such as the mystery plays, \"morality plays\", and the \"university drama\" that attempted to recreate Athenian tragedy. The Italian tradition of Commedia dell'arte, as well as the elaborate masques frequently presented at court, also contributed to the shaping of public theatre. Since before the reign of Elizabeth I, companies of players were attached to households of leading aristocrats and performed seasonally in various locations. These became the foundation for the professional players that performed on the Elizabethan stage.\n\nThe development of the theatre and opportunities for acting ceased when Puritan opposition to the stage banned the performance of all plays within London. Puritans viewed the theatre as immoral. The re-opening of the theatres in 1660 signaled a renaissance of English drama. English comedies written and performed in the Restoration period from 1660 to 1710 are collectively called \"Restoration comedy\". Restoration comedy is notorious for its sexual explicitness. At this point, women were allowed for the first time to appear on the English stage, exclusively in female roles. This period saw the introduction of the first professional actresses and the rise of the first celebrity actors.\n\nIn the 19th century, the negative reputation of actors was largely reversed, and acting became an honored, popular profession and art. The rise of the actor as celebrity provided the transition, as audiences flocked to their favorite \"stars\". A new role emerged for the actor-managers, who formed their own companies and controlled the actors, the productions, and the financing. When successful, they built up a permanent clientele that flocked to their productions. They could enlarge their audience by going on tour across the country, performing a repertoire of well-known plays, such as those by Shakespeare. The newspapers, private clubs, pubs, and coffee shops rang with lively debates evaluating the relative merits of the stars and the productions. Henry Irving (1838-1905) was the most successful of the British actor-managers. Irving was renowned for his Shakespearean roles, and for such innovations as turning out the house lights so that attention could focus more on the stage and less on the audience. His company toured across Britain, as well as Europe and the United States, demonstrating the power of star actors and celebrated roles to attract enthusiastic audiences. His knighthood in 1895 indicated full acceptance into the higher circles of British society.\n\nBy the early 20th century, the economics of large-scale productions displaced the actor-manager model. It was too hard to find people who combined a genius at acting as well as management, so specialization divided the roles as stage managers and later theatre directors emerged. Financially, much larger capital was required to operate out of a major city. The solution was corporate ownership of chains of theatres, such as by the Theatrical Syndicate, Edward Laurillard, and especially The Shubert Organization. By catering to tourists, theaters in large cities increasingly favored long runs of highly popular plays, especially musicals. Big name stars became even more essential.\n\n\nFormerly, in some societies, only men could become actors. In ancient Greece and ancient Rome and the medieval world, it was considered disgraceful for a woman to go on stage; this belief persisted until the 17th century in Venice. In the time of William Shakespeare, women's roles were generally played by men or boys.\n\nWhen an eighteen-year Puritan prohibition of drama was lifted after the English Restoration of 1660, women began to appear on stage in England. Margaret Hughes is oft credited as the first professional actress on the English stage. This prohibition ended during the reign of Charles II in part because he enjoyed watching actresses on stage. Specifically, Charles II issued letters patent to Thomas Killigrew and William Davenant, granting them the monopoly right to form two London theatre companies to perform \"serious\" drama, and the letters patent were reissued in 1662 with revisions allowing actresses to perform for the first time.\n\nThe first occurrence of the term \"actress\" was in 1608 according to the OED and is ascribed to Middleton. In the 19th century many viewed women in acting negatively, as actresses were often courtesans and associated with promiscuity. Despite these prejudices, the 19th century also saw the first female acting \"stars\", most notably Sarah Bernhardt.\n\nIn Japan, \"onnagata\", men taking on female roles, were used in \"kabuki\" theatre when women were banned from performing on stage during the Edo period. This convention continues. By contrast, some forms of Chinese drama involve women playing all roles.\n\nIn modern times, women occasionally played the roles of boys or young men. For example, the stage role of Peter Pan is traditionally played by a woman, as are most principal boys in British pantomime. Opera has several \"breeches roles\" traditionally sung by women, usually mezzo-sopranos. Examples are Hansel in \"Hänsel und Gretel\", Cherubino in \"The Marriage of Figaro\" and Octavian in \"Der Rosenkavalier\".\n\nWomen playing male roles are uncommon in film, with notable exceptions. In 1982, Stina Ekblad played the mysterious Ismael Retzinsky in \"Fanny and Alexander\", and Linda Hunt received the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for playing Billy Kwan in \"The Year of Living Dangerously\". In 2007, Cate Blanchett was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for playing Jude Quinn, a fictionalized representation of Bob Dylan in the 1960s, in \"I'm Not There\".\n\nIn the 2000s, women playing men in live theatre is particularly common in presentations of older plays, such as Shakespearean works with large numbers of male characters in roles where gender is inconsequential.\n\nHaving an actor dress as the opposite sex for comic effect is also a long-standing tradition in comic theatre and film. Most of Shakespeare's comedies include instances of overt cross-dressing, such as Francis Flute in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\". The movie \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\" stars Jack Gilford dressing as a young bride. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon famously posed as women to escape gangsters in the Billy Wilder film \"Some Like It Hot\". Cross-dressing for comic effect was a frequently used device in most of the Carry On films. Dustin Hoffman and Robin Williams have each appeared in a hit comedy film (\"Tootsie\" and \"Mrs. Doubtfire\", respectively) in which they played most scenes dressed as a woman.\n\nOccasionally, the issue is further complicated, for example, by a woman playing a woman acting as a man—who then pretends to be a woman, such as Julie Andrews in \"Victor/Victoria\", or Gwyneth Paltrow in \"Shakespeare in Love\". In \"\", filmwatchers never learn the gender of the androgynous main characters Pat and Chris (played by Julia Sweeney and Dave Foley). Similarly, in the aforementioned example of The Marriage of Figaro, there is a scene in which Cherubino (a male character portrayed by a woman) dresses up and acts as a woman; the other characters in the scene are aware of a single level of gender role obfuscation, while the audience is aware of two levels.\n\nA few modern roles are played by a member of the opposite sex in order to emphasize the gender fluidity of the role. Edna Turnblad in \"Hairspray\" was played by Divine in the 1988 original film, Harvey Fierstein in the Broadway musical, and John Travolta in the 2007 movie musical. Felicity Huffman was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for playing Bree Osbourne (a male-to-female transsexual) in 2005's \"Transamerica\".\n\nActors working in theatre, film, television and radio have to learn specific skills. Techniques that work well in one type of acting may not work well in another type of acting.\n\nTo act on stage, actors need to learn the stage directions that appear in the script, such as \"Stage Left\" and \"Stage Right\". These directions are based on the actor's point of view as he or she stands on the stage facing the audience. Actors also have to learn the meaning of the stage directions \"Upstage\" (away from the audience) and \"Downstage\" (towards the audience) Theatre actors need to learn blocking, which is \"...where and how an actor moves on the stage during a play\". Most scripts specify some blocking. The Director also gives instructions on blocking, such as crossing the stage or picking up and using a prop.\n\nSome theater actors need to learn stage combat, which is simulated fighting on stage. Actors may have to simulate hand-to-hand [fighting] or sword[-fighting]. Actors are coached by fight directors, who help them learn the choreographed sequence of fight actions.\nFrom 1894 to the late 1920s, movies were silent films. Silent film actors emphasized body language and facial expression, so that the audience could better understand what an actor was feeling and portraying on screen. Much silent film acting is apt to strike modern-day audiences as simplistic or campy. The melodramatic acting style was in some cases a habit actors transferred from their former stage experience. Vaudeville theatre was an especially popular origin for many American silent film actors. The pervading presence of stage actors in film was the cause of this outburst from director Marshall Neilan in 1917: \"The sooner the stage people who have come into pictures get out, the better for the pictures.\" In other cases, directors such as John Griffith Wray required their actors to deliver larger-than-life expressions for emphasis. As early as 1914, American viewers had begun to make known their preference for greater naturalness on screen.\n\nPioneering film directors in Europe and the United States recognized the different limitations and freedoms of the mediums of stage and screen by the early 1910s. Silent films became less vaudevillian in the mid 1910s, as the differences between stage and screen became apparent. Due to the work of directors such as D W Griffith, cinematography became less stage-like, and the then-revolutionary close up shot allowed subtle and naturalistic acting. In America, D.W. Griffith's company Biograph Studios, became known for its innovative direction and acting, conducted suit the cinema rather than the stage. Griffith realized that theatrical acting did not look good on film and required his actors and actresses to go through weeks of film acting training.\n\nLillian Gish has been called film's \"first true actress\" for her work in the period, as she pioneered new film performing techniques, recognizing the crucial differences between stage and screen acting. Directors such as Albert Capellani and Maurice Tourneur began to insist on naturalism in their films. By the mid-1920s many American silent films had adopted a more naturalistic acting style, though not all actors and directors accepted naturalistic, low-key acting straight away; as late as 1927, films featuring expressionistic acting styles, such as \"Metropolis\", were still being released. \n\nAccording to Anton Kaes, a silent film scholar from the University of Wisconsin, American silent cinema began to see a shift in acting techniques between 1913 and 1921, influenced by techniques found in German silent film. This is mainly attributed to the influx of emigrants from the Weimar Republic, \"including film directors, producers, cameramen, lighting and stage technicians, as well as actors and actresses\".\n\nFilm actors have to learn to get used to and be comfortable with a camera being in front of them.\nFilm actors need to learn to find and stay on their \"mark.\" This is a position on the floor marked with tape. This position is where the lights and camera focus are optimized. Film actors also need to learn how to prepare well and perform well on screen tests. Screen tests are a filmed audition of part of the script.\n\nUnlike theater actors, who develop characters for repeat performances, film actors lack continuity, forcing them to come to all scenes (sometimes shot in reverse of the order in which they ultimately appear) with a fully developed character already.\n\n\"Since film captures even the smallest gesture and magnifies it..., cinema demands a less flamboyant and stylized bodily performance from the actor than does the theater.\" \"The performance of emotion is the most difficult aspect of film acting to master: ...the film actor must rely on subtle facial ticks, quivers, and tiny lifts of the eyebrow to create a believable character.\" Some theatre stars \"...have made the theater-to-cinema transition quite successfully (Laurence Olivier, Glenn Close, and Julie Andrews, for instance), others have not...\"\n\n\"On a television set, there are typically several cameras angled at the set. Actors who are new to on-screen acting can get confused about which camera to look into.\" TV actors need to learn to use lav mics (Lavaliere microphones). TV actors need to understand the concept of \"frame\". \"The term frame refers to the area that the camera's lens is capturing.\"\nWithin the acting industry, there are four types of television roles one could land on a show. Each type varies in prominence, frequency of appearance, and pay. The first is known as a \"series regular\"—the main actors on the show as part of the permanent cast. Actors in \"recurring\" roles are under contract to appear in multiple episodes of a series. A \"co-star\" role is a small speaking role that usually only appears in one episode. A \"guest star\" is a larger role than a \"co-star\" role, and the character is often the central focus of the episode or integral to the plot.\n\nRadio drama is a dramatized, purely acoustic performance, broadcast on radio or published on audio media, such as tape or CD. With no visual component, radio drama depends on dialogue, music and sound effects to help the listener imagine the characters and story: \"It is auditory in the physical dimension but equally powerful as a visual force in the psychological dimension.\"\n\nRadio drama achieved widespread popularity within a decade of its initial development in the 1920s. By the 1940s, it was a leading international popular entertainment. With the advent of television in the 1950s, however, radio drama lost some of its popularity, and in some countries has never regained large audiences. However, recordings of OTR (old-time radio) survive today in the audio archives of collectors and museums, as well as several online sites such as Internet Archive.\n\n, radio drama has a minimal presence on terrestrial radio in the United States. Much of American radio drama is restricted to rebroadcasts or podcasts of programs from previous decades. However, other nations still have thriving traditions of radio drama. In the United Kingdom, for example, the BBC produces and broadcasts hundreds of new radio plays each year on Radio 3, Radio 4, and Radio 4 Extra. Podcasting has also offered the means of creating new radio dramas, in addition to the distribution of vintage programs.\n\nThe terms \"audio drama\" or \"audio theatre\" are sometimes used synonymously with \"radio drama\" with one possible distinction: audio drama or audio theatre may not necessarily be intended specifically for broadcast on radio. Audio drama, whether newly produced or OTR classics, can be found on CDs, cassette tapes, podcasts, webcasts and conventional broadcast radio.\n\nThanks to advances in digital recording and Internet distribution, radio drama is experiencing a revival.\n\n\n\n"}

The character first appeared in the Philadelphia-based underground newspaper \"Yarrowstalks\" #2 in July 1967, making her comics debut in the second issue of \"Zap Comix\" (June 1968).\n\nAngelfood McSpade is a satirical portrayal of a stereotypical black African woman. She is depicted as a large, bare-breasted tribeswoman, dressed in nothing but a skirt made out of palm tree leaves. She is drawn with big lips, golden rings around her neck and in her ears, huge breasts, large round buttocks and speaks jive. Her name references angelfood cake and the racial slur \"spade\".\n\nAccording to the second issue of \"Zap Comix\", she has been confined to \"the wilds of darkest Africa\", because \"civilization would be threatened if she were allowed to do whatever she pleased!\" It is not clear whether she was born in Africa or born in the U.S.A. and then sent to Africa. Her type of clothing suggests she is African, but her jive talk suggests she's from the U.S.A.\n\nAngelfood is depicted as a nymphomaniac and open to sexual intercourse. In many of her stories she is accompanied by Snoid, another of Crumb's characters who is portrayed as \"a short-statured asshole\" known for \"his fetishes, sex cravings, and disdain for materialism.\" Policemen prevent other sexually aroused men from meeting Angelfood. In a later story three men bring her to the United States and promise to \"civilize\" her. There she is told to lick toilets clean in order to gain success. While she does this, the men push her head inside the toilet and violate her.\n\nShe is very naïve and easily abused or even raped by the horny men who surround her, though, being a nymphomaniac, she is not bothered by this. Often, she is vulnerable to assault while being asleep or unconscious. Angelfood has a tendency to walk barebreasted, even in cities. However, no one seems to stop her from walking around half-naked. In another story she saves two boys, Chuck and Bob, from being eaten by members of her own tribe. They flee from the tribe to the U.S., where she spends a night with the boys and afterwards goes to the hairdresser. When she returns, she has bleached her skin, changed her hair and clothing and learned fluent English, much to the disappointment of the two boys. In another story she asked Hugh Hefner if she could become a Playboy Bunny, but when Hefner saw her in the outfit he couldn't resist laughing. This made her so angry that she attacked him. In the last panel she and Mr. Natural (who accompanied her) are kicked out of Hefner's office.\n\nThe character was featured regularly during Crumb's late 1960s and early 1970s output. In later comics her appearances became less frequent, and finally after 1971 Crumb stopped using the character in his comics altogether.\n\nAngelfood McSpade is one of Crumb's most notorious targets for accusations of sexism and racism. Crumb has responded that he did not invent racist caricatures like Angelfood, but that they used to be part of the American culture in which he was raised. He saw the character as a criticism of the racist stereotype itself and assumed that the young liberal hippie/intellectual audience who read his work were not racists and would understand his intentions for the character.\n\n\n\n"}

Artificial seawater is primarily used in marine biology and in marine and reef aquaria, and allows the easy preparation of media appropriate for marine organisms (including algae, bacteria, plants and animals). From a scientific perspective, artificial seawater has the advantage of reproducibility over natural seawater since it is a standardized formula. Synthetic seawater is also known as artificial seawater and substitute ocean water. \n\nThe tables below present an example of an artificial seawater (35.00‰ of salinity) preparation devised by Kester, Duedall, Connors and Pytkowicz (1967).

{"id": "5217888", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5217888", "title": "Bayko", "text": "Bayko\n\nBayko was an English building model construction toy invented by Charles Plimpton, an early plastics engineer and entrepreneur in Liverpool. First marketed in Britain it was soon exported throughout the British Commonwealth and became a world wide brand between 1934 and 1967. The name derived from Bakelite, one of the world's first commercial plastics that was originally used to manufacture many of the parts. Bayko was one of the world's earliest plastic toys to be marketed.\n\nBayko was primarily intended for the construction of model buildings. The rectangular Bakelite bases had a square grid of holes, spaced at 3/8 inch centres, into which thin metal rods, 75 thou [1.905 mm] in diameter, of various lengths, could be placed vertically. In order to make larger models, two or more bases could be joined together by means of metal links secured by screws through holes in the bases. Bakelite bricks, windows and other parts could then be slotted between pairs of rods in order to create the walls of the building. Other commonly used parts included floors (thin sheets of resin bonded paper with the same square pattern grid of holes as bases), and roofs of various types. There were also a large number of other more specialised parts. In the original sets bases were large, and coloured brown; walls were brown/maroon and cream; roofs were deep maroon; and windows were a very dark green, but by 1937 the 'true' colours of red or white walls, green windows and red roofs were established, though bases were still large and brown.\n\nA period of radical change was heralded in 1938 with the introduction of the [now] much sought after 20s series, through which a number of new parts were introduced. Then, in 1939, the 'New Series' retooling programme added to the range of new parts and changed the bases to the more familiar, smaller version, initially in a mottled green. Post war the standard colours were red and white walls, red roofs, green widows and green bases, and, despite some experiments with 'rogue' colours in the years immediately after the war, these remained in play until 1959 when Meccano took over, changing the colours to orange red and cream bricks with yellow windows and grey bases.\n\nPlimpton began the move to polystyrene parts, gradually, from the mid 1950s onwards, a change which Meccano subsequently took up with enthusiasm, it being so much cheaper to produce. Ironically perhaps, in the last days of Bayko, they began to reverse this change, of both materials and colour scheme, with the introduction of the so-called 'Flanged' or 'Minimalist' parts.\n\nThe main advantage of Bayko over its rivals is generally regarded as the high standard of realism of the models constructed with it. The main disadvantage often quoted is the fragility of Bakelite which frequently led to bases and window parts breaking. Some safety concerns can also be recognised regarding the dangers of using thin metal rods in a toy for children; however, had the product survived into the health and safety years, an alternative plastic version, probably 'crimped' every 3/8 inch to make a 'mechanical fuse', would have allayed these fears.\n\nThe Bayko system was invented and patented by Charles Plimpton in 1933, following a long period of convalescence in Ruthin in North Wales. Plimpton set up Plimpton Engineering in Liverpool, England, to manufacture the components, the majority of which were made from Bakelite, a new synthetic plastic developed in the early 1900s. The sets were called \"Bayko Light Construction Sets\" (the term \"Bayko Light\" coming from the name \"Bakelite\") and went on sale nationally towards the end of 1934. There had been, however, limited production, with sets literally packed on the kitchen table, 12 months earlier, presumably for a restricted, local market. The Bakelite material was sourced from Bakelite Limited, a Birmingham supplier, and for the first few years of its life, Bayko was marketed by both Plimpton Engineering and Bakelite Limited.\n\nInitially five sets were produced, \"Set 1\" (the smallest, entry level) through to \"Set 5\" (the largest). The bricks were brown and cream, the bases brown, the windows dark green, and the roofs dark maroon. Plimpton began advertising Bayko in Meccano Ltd's \"Meccano Magazine\" in September 1935, unaware that 25 years later, Meccano itself would own and manufacture Bayko. Regular advertisements appeared in the magazine over those next 25 years.\n\nIn 1935 three Ornamental Sets A, B and C were introduced that contained decorative parts to supplement the existing sets, including pillars, arches and mottled green roofs. In 1936 a \"Set 6\" was introduced, a much larger set than \"Set 5\" that included all the new ornamental parts. All the bricks in this set, initially, were 'Oak', a mottled brown colour made by the addition of sawdust to the resin, and sets like this were, and indeed remain, much cherished. In 1937 the familiar, long-lived colour scheme of red and white bricks with green windows was implemented for the standard sets. In late 1937, or early 1938, \"Set 6\" was also changed to the new standard colours and a conversion set, \"set 5A\", was introduced. However, until wartime austerity interrupted, any set could still be ordered in 'Oak'.\n\nBy 1938, the Bayko sets were described as \"Bayko Building Sets\", as a period of change began. The 20s series, updated Ornamental sets, were introduced, in which curved bricks and windows and orange turrets were perhaps the most noteworthy introductions. In 1939 all the existing sets were relaunched and replaced by a 'New Series' of six sets that incorporated new parts, still in the red, white and green colour scheme.\n\nProduction was interrupted in 1942 by World War II when the company switched to manufacturing for the war effort. When production resumed in 1946, the set range was reduced to three, \"Set 0\" to \"Set 2\", set \"0\" being a new, much smaller, entry level set, appropriate to these austere times. A \"Set 3\" was introduced in 1947.\n\nCharles Plimpton died of tuberculosis in December 1948 and his wife, Audrey Plimpton took over the running of Plimpton Engineering.\n\nFurther new parts were added to the sets in 1949 and 1950, probably from Charles Plimpton's innovation stream, were introduced to increase the realism and flexibility of the system. Although the initial plans had been for a further two sets, the range was completed in 1952 when \"set 4\" was introduced, which included all the parts except turrets.\n\nBy the late 1950s, suffering from a chronic lack of investment in new parts, Bayko came under great pressure from other construction toys that appeared on the market, and Audrey Plimpton retired in 1959. She sold the company to Meccano Ltd in 1959, though Brittains had also been in the frame.\n\nHaving acquired the rights to manufacture Bayko in 1959, Meccano Ltd moved production to its Meccano factory in Speke, Liverpool. To rationalise and simplify the system, all the Bayko sets were redesigned. Most of the decorative parts were dropped and the cumbersome one-piece roofs were replaced by flat-roof pieces. The colour scheme was changed to grey bases, light green roofs, yellow windows and doors, and orange-red and beige bricks. In order to reduce production costs, polystyrene was used for all the plastic parts instead of Bakelite.\n\nAfter an unfortunately long gestation period, four Meccano Bayko sets went on sale from the end of 1960 into 1961, numbered 11 to 14 to avoid being confused with the Plimpton sets. The Bayko adverts continued in \"Meccano Magazine\", and — due to the success of the cost-cutting measures — the new sets were sold at a significantly lower price than the Plimpton sets. In 1962 Meccano introduced its own decorative pieces, including opening French windows, large shop windows and pantile roofs, together with a new \"Set 15\" which included them all.\n\nBy 1963 Meccano Ltd also began feeling the pressure of competing toys, even though the models Bayko produced were more realistic architectural constructions, and advertising was increasingly scarce, even in Meccano Magazine, their own publication. By 1964, now under the Tri-ang ownership, all advertising for Bayko was stopped, although Meccano continued manufacturing Bayko sets and spares until 1967.\n\nStrangely, as Bayko was being 'milked' as it struggled, unsupported in the market place, another re-tooling programme was begun. This comprised the introduction of the 'Flanged' or 'Minimalist' bricks and related parts, reverting to red and white bricks, but this programme of change was stopped halfway through. Eventually the 'milking' led to a deterioration of standards as mixed colour sets were churned out.\n\nOver its lifespan, both Plimpton and Meccano Bayko was exported across the world, and, besides being a toy, it attracted a modest adult following that still exists today. A healthy trade in original Bayko sets and parts also exists today, with some enthusiasts even casting their own Bayko pieces.\n\n\n"}

It was produced by Mitchell Maxwell, Alan J. Schuster, Fred H. Krones and M Squared Entertainment, Inc., and Joshua Silver (Associate Producer).\n\nSet in a rundown Chicago hotel in 1938, the dialogue-free show focuses on three women's relationships with the same snake of a man, their interweaving stories told through the torch songs and blues of Duke Ellington, Bessie Smith, Johnny Mercer, Harold Arlen, Vernon Duke, Gordon Jenkins, and Alberta Hunter, among others.\n\nThe revue originally was staged by Epps and Gregory Hines under the supervision of Norman René at the off-Broadway Playhouse 46, where it ran for 51 performances between March 26 and May 11, 1980. The original cast consisted of David Brunetti, Rise Collins, Suzanne M. Henry, and Gwen Shepherd.\n\nAfter thirteen previews, the Broadway production, directed by Epps, opened on June 2, 1982 at the Rialto Theatre, where it ran for 53 performances. Jean Du Shon, Debbie Shapiro, Leslie Uggams, and Charles Coleman comprised the cast. The show was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Musical.\n\nThe West End production, staged by Steve Whately, opened on June 9, 1987 at the Donmar Warehouse, where it ran through July 19, 1987. Maria Friedman, Debby Bishop, Carol Woods, and Clarke Peters comprised the cast. With Peter Straker replacing Peters, it transferred to the Piccadilly Theatre, opening on September 23 and running through July 28, 1988.\n\nThe show was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Musical and Woods received a nomination for Best Actress in a Musical. The London cast album was recorded live during the August 25–26 performances at the Donmar.\n\nA production ran at the Minetta Lane Theatre, New York City, from September 14, 1988 through October 23, 1988 for 45 performances. The cast featured Carol Woods, Brenda Pressley, Kathleen Rowe McAllen and Lawrence Hamilton. In the early 1990s, Clarke Peters directed a touring production, starting at the Churchill Theatre in Bromley, South London, England. It featured Ricco Ross and Claire Martin.\n\nThe revue was presented at the Post Street Theatre, San Francisco, for eight weeks in July through September 2007. Maurice Hines played the role of \"The Man in the Saloon\", with Carol Woods, Freda Payne and Paulette Ivory as the three women.\n\nThe most recent production celebrated the show's 30th anniversary at The Hippodrome Casino, London. The cast included; Ian Carlyle as The Man, Enyonam Gbesemete as The Lady, Cleo Higgins as The Woman and Bleu Woodward as The Girl.\n\n\"Note: composers in parentheses\"\n\nFrank Rich in his \"New York Times\" review of the 1982 revival, wrote: \"The sad truth is that not even the plainest theatrical formulas are as easy as they look - and \"Blues in the Night,\" the new revue at the Rialto, is the not-so-living proof. The 25 blues numbers in this show...are often first-rate. The stars - Leslie Uggams, Jean Du Shon and Debbie Shapiro - are talented. The format - no dialogue, a minimum of dancing - is a model of economy. Yet \"Blues in the Night\" proves a bland evening that mainly serves to remind us just how much imagination went into its seemingly similar, far more fiery predecessors. Sheldon Epps, who \"conceived\" the revue and directed it, may well be responsible for what's gone wrong, but his basic notion isn't bad: \"Blues\" is set in a cheap hotel in 1938 Chicago (modestly designed by John Falabella) where the three stars occupy separate, shabby rooms. Yet the women remain anonymous throughout - they are called simply Woman No. 1 and so on in the Playbill - and, even when they sing together, they don't interact.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "873642", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=873642", "title": "Bread and Puppet Theater", "text": "Bread and Puppet Theater\n\nThe Bread and Puppet Theater (often known simply as Bread & Puppet) is a politically radical puppet theater, active since the 1960s, currently based in Glover, Vermont. Its founder and director is Peter Schumann.\n\nThe name Bread & Puppet is derived from the theater's practice of sharing its own fresh bread, served for free with aïoli, with the audience of each performance to create community, and from its central principle art should be as basic as bread to life. Some have heard echoes of the Roman phrase \"bread and circuses\" or the labor slogan \"Bread and Roses\" in the theater's name as well, though these are not often mentioned in Bread & Puppet's own explanations of its name.\n\nThe Bread and Puppet Theater participates in parades including Independence Day celebrations, notably in Cabot, Vermont, with many effigies including a satirical Uncle Sam on stilts.\n\nPeter Schumann began The Bread & Puppet Theater in 1962–1963 in New York City. It was active during the Vietnam War in anti-war protests, primarily in New York City, prompting \"Time\" reviewer T.E. Kalem to remark in 1971, \"This virtual dumb show is as contemporary as tomorrow's bombing raid.\" Many people remember it as central to the political spectacle of the time, as its enormous puppets (often ten to fifteen feet tall) were a fixture of many demonstrations. A Sicilian puppet show had inspired Schumann, and TB&PT inspired other groups across the continent, including Gary Botting's Edmonton-based People & Puppets Incorporated, which in the early 1970s also used effigies yards-high to depict political themes and social commentary in radical street theatre. In 1970 the Theater moved to Vermont, first to Goddard College in Plainfield, and then to a farm in Glover where it remains. The farm is home to a cow, several pigs, chickens, and puppeteers, as well as indoor and outdoor performance spaces, a printshop, store, and large museum showcasing over four decades of the company's work. TB&PT has received National Endowment for the Arts grants, awards from the Puppeteers of America, and other organizations.\n\nIn 1984 and 1985 they toured colleges with an indoor play, \"The Door\", which told the story of \"the massacre of Guatemalan and El Salvadorian Indians and the plight of refugees trying to escape through a diabolically opening and closing door to the North.\" With \"only minimal use of the spoken word\", the play made its points \"with great simplicity and beauty.\"\nUntil 1998, Bread & Puppet hosted its annual Pageant and Circus (in full, \"Our Domestic Resurrection Circus\"), in and around a natural amphitheater on its Glover grounds. In the 1990s, the festival began drawing crowds of tens of thousands, who camped on nearby farmers' land over the summer week long of the pageant. The event became unmanageable, and concerned itself less with the theater's performance. In 1998, a man was killed by accident in a fight while camping overnight for the festival, forcing director Peter Schumann to cancel the festival. Since then, the theater offers smaller weekend performances all summer, and traveled around New York and New England, with occasional tours around the U.S. and abroad. The theater runs a program where apprentices help produce and act in performances. In New York City, Bread & Puppet performs at Theater for the New City during the holiday season each year.\n\nSpecific causes over the years have been:\n\nBread & Puppet volunteers were among the seventy-nine people arrested at a warehouse in Philadelphia during the 2000 Republican National Convention. The Associated Press reported the scene of the \"SWAT-style\" raid was broadcast live by news helicopters. Years later, the AP explained there \"was tense talk (later proved unfounded) of terrorist plots being hatched in the 'puppetista' headquarters, of bomb building and anarchist-fueled mayhem.\" Its report did not include the police's side of the story.\n\n\"A couple of our folks were down there, helping to build puppets\", said Linda Elbow, company manager for Bread & Puppet. \"The cops went into the studio...arrested people, and took the puppets. So, now, puppets are criminals.\"\n\nThe Bread & Puppet Theater is a regular participant in New York's Village Halloween Parade, noted for its use of giant puppets. In 2001, Bread & Puppet did not march in the parade. The Theater's plans that year included a presentation protesting the War in Afghanistan. The Halloween parade was to occur fifty days after and 1.5 miles away from the September 11, 2001 attack on the World Trade Center. It was this attack which was the pretext for starting the war which Bread & Puppet Theater was protesting, and the company's \"anti-war stance\" reportedly \"...already placed it at odds with some New Yorkers\", according to Dan Bacalzo of TheaterMania.com. Many of the parade's macabre elements were suspended that year by its director Jeanne Fleming. It was not known until October 25 whether it would even take place.\n\nLinda Elbow commented, \"We certainly weren't saying 'Hooray for the terrorists.' We were saying, 'Look what you're doing to the people of Afghanistan.'\" An unattributed quote in Bacalzo's report — \"What you're bringing, we don't want\" — suggests it was the group's selection of material that was unwelcome, not the group itself. The report did not make it clear how the decision was made, or who made it; the incident was included as secondary background material in a piece publicizing an upcoming Bread and Puppet show. Fleming, who was not interviewed by Bacalzo (but is quoted as if she was), says that Bread and Puppet was not \"disinvited\", adding that it was she who first invited the company to march in the parade when she took over as organizer.\n\nIn December 2001 the Theater returned to New York with \"The Insurrection Mass with Funeral March for a Rotten Idea: A Special Mass for the Aftermath of the Events of September 11th\". It was presented at Theater for the New City, and billed as \"a nonreligious service in the presence of several papier-mâché gods.\" The \"Insurrection Masses\" are a common format for the Bread & Puppet Theater, as are such \"Funerals\", though the \"rotten\" ideas change.\n\nIn addition to the theater, some of the Bread & Puppet puppeteers operate the Bread & Puppet Press, directed by Elka Schumann, who is Peter Schumann's wife (and granddaughter of Scott Nearing). The press produces posters, cards and books on the Theater's themes as well as other forms of \"cheap art.\" The broadsheet \"Why Cheap Art? Manifesto\" is among the press's best-known products.\n\nNotable writers and performers have participated in the theater, including children's theater performer Paul Zaloom and writer Grace Paley.\n\nOther writers to have praised Bread & Puppet include historian Howard Zinn, who cited its \"magic, beauty, and power\", and poet and NPR commentator Andrei Codrescu, who wrote: \"The Bread & Puppet Theater has been so long a part of America's conscious struggle for our better selves, that it has become, paradoxically, a fixture of our subconscious.\"\n\nThe Bread & Puppet Theater has a visual reference in the 2007 Julie Taymor film \"Across the Universe\". The movie replicated characters such as Uncle Fatso, Washer Women, White Ladies, and the many armed Mother head. The Bread & Puppet Circus Band also has a reference in the costumes of the circus band during \"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\". The difference between the real life costumes and the ones made for the movie is the real life ones are red and black, whereas in the movie they are white and black. The Bread & Puppet Theater is in the film's credits.\n\nIn her 2008 memoir \"A Freewheelin' Time: A Memoir of Greenwich Village In The Sixties\", New York painter and illustrator, Suze Rotolo, notes she worked a fabrication job with TB&PT early in 1963 near Delancy Street on the lower east side of Manhattan. Rotolo, at the time, was the girlfriend and muse of Bob Dylan and was the inspiration for the songs \"Suze (The Cough Song)\", \"Don't Think Twice, It's Alright\", \"Tomorrow Is a Long Time\", \"One Too Many Mornings\", and \"Boots of Spanish Leather\".\n\n\n\n"}

To this, he replied to the bank manager \"One day sir, I will be able to buy and sell you.\" Success followed this Mother Goose themed park and in 1959 he opened a second amusement park in the village of Lake George, New York, this one named Gaslight Village, which closed in 1989.

Favor\n\nEdward Addison Favor (August 29, 1856 – January 10, 1936), who was billed as Edward M. Favor or Ed. M. Favor, was an American vaudeville comedian, singer, musical theatre performer and pioneer recording artist, who was one of the most popular stars of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.\n\nHe was born in New York City, the son of Franklin Cushman Favor and his wife Lydia, née Lowe. Suggestions that the family name was originally LeFevre have been proved to be incorrect, as the family bible states his last name as Favor.\n\nHe began working in vaudeville as a light comedian in about 1876, and in or before 1877 married Edith Sinclair (1857-1942), who had been a successful child actress. Billed as Favor and Sinclair, the couple worked together as a duo and in musical comedies. In 1887 they appeared together as members of the Edith Sinclair Comedy Company in \"A Box of Cash\", in which he played an Irish-American character. Despite the popularity of his Irish character roles, there is no evidence that he had any Irish ancestry. In 1893 he and his wife appeared on Broadway in Edward E. Rice's long-running burlesque \"1492 Up To Date\".\n\nHe made one of his first recordings in 1893, of \"The Commodore Song\", taken from his previous show, \"Ship Ahoy\". Among his other early successes were \"Say Au Revoir, But Not Goodbye\" (North American, 1894), \"Daisy Bell (Bicycle Built for Two)\" (Edison, 1894), and \"My Best Girl's A New Yorker\" (Columbia, 1895). By the late 1890s, Favor had recorded for most of the major recording companies, in between his vaudeville commitments. In 1899, he was one of the first to record on the Zonophone label, and in 1900 recorded for the first time for Eldridge R. Johnson's \"Improved\" record label, later to become Victor Records the next year. He continued to appear on stage and, in 1900, was described in \"Broadway\" magazine as \"one of the best light comedians on the stage\" and, with his wife, as \"one of the big attractions in vaudeville.\"\n\nHe continued to make successful recordings for the next decade, sung in his \"Irish-American piping tenor\". These included comic numbers for Edison, Columbia and other companies, such as \"Hamlet Was A Melancholy Dane\", \"Who Threw the Overalls in Mrs. Murphy's Chowder?\" (1901), \"On a Sunday Afternoon\" (1902), \"Bedelia (The Irish Coon Song Serenade)\" (1903), \"I Think I Hear A Woodpecker Knocking At My Family Tree\", and \"Pocahontas\" (1906). He also made recordings with his wife, Steve Porter, and the American Quartet.\n\nHe and his wife toured in South Africa and Australia in 1906. He continued to appear in shows thereafter; the \"Boston Globe\" stated that \"While [Favor and Sinclair] were rehearsing with \"The Blue Moon\" in New York City they were appearing in one of the vaudeville houses in a sketch called 'The Maguires', which they have played at least 10,000 times.\" However, his career as a recording artist was in decline by 1908. He made his final recordings for Victor in 1911, and for Edison in 1914 when he recorded \"On The 7:28\" and \"Indoor Sports\".\nFavor continued to appear in theatrical shows through the 1920s and into the early 1930s. In 1933, he appeared in the Broadway productions of \"John Ferguson\" and \"Merton of the Movies\", and in 1934 in \"America - Very Early\".\n\nHe died at the age of 79 in Brooklyn in 1936, of peritonitis.\n\n"}
{"id": "369910", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=369910", "title": "Erotic art", "text": "Erotic art\n\nErotic art covers any artistic work that is intended to evoke erotic arousal or that depicts scenes of sexual activity. It is a type of erotica and includes drawings, engravings, films, paintings, photographs, and sculptures, and writing.\n\nThe definition of erotic art is somewhat subjective, and dependent on context, since perceptions of both what is \"erotic\" and what is \"art\" vary. For example, a sculpture of a phallus in some cultures may be considered a traditional symbol of potency rather than overtly erotic. Material that is produced to illustrate sex education may be perceived by others as inappropriately erotic.\n\nA distinction is often made between erotic art and pornography, which also depicts scenes of sexual activity and is intended to evoke erotic arousal, but is not usually considered fine art. Some draw a distinction based on the work's intent and message: erotic art would be works intended for purposes in addition to arousal, which could be appreciated as art by someone uninterested in their erotic content. US Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart famously wrote that the distinction was intuitive, saying about hard-core pornography which would not be legally protected as erotic art, \"I know it when I see it\"\n\nAmong the oldest surviving examples of erotic depictions are Paleolithic cave paintings and carvings, but many cultures have created erotic art. Artifacts have been discovered from ancient Mesopotamia depicting explicit heterosexual sex. Glyptic art from the Sumerian Early Dynastic Period frequently shows scenes of frontal sex in the missionary position. In Mesopotamian votive plaques from the early second millennium BC, the man is usually shown entering the woman from behind while she bends over, drinking beer through a straw. Middle Assyrian lead votive figurines often represent the man standing and penetrating the woman as she rests on top of an altar. Scholars have traditionally interpreted all these depictions as scenes of ritual sex, but they are more likely to be associated with the cult of Inanna, the goddess of sex and prostitution. Many sexually explicit images were found in the temple of Inanna at Assur, which also contained models of male and female sexual organs, including stone phalli, which may have been worn around the neck as an amulet or used to decorate cult statues, and clay models of the female vulva.\n\nDepictions of sexual intercourse were not part of the general repertory of ancient Egyptian formal art, but rudimentary sketches of heterosexual intercourse have been found on pottery fragments and in graffiti. The Turin Erotic Papyrus (Papyrus 55001) is a by Egyptian papyrus scroll discovered at Deir el-Medina, the last two-thirds of which consist of a series of twelve vignettes showing men and women in various sexual positions. The men in the illustrations are \"scruffy, balding, short, and paunchy\" with exaggeratedly large genitalia and do not conform to Egyptian standards of physical attractiveness, but the women are nubile and they are shown with objects from traditional erotic iconography, such as convolvulus leaves and, in some scenes, they are even holding items traditionally associated with Hathor, the goddess of love, such as lotus flowers, monkeys, and sistra. The scroll was probably painted in the Ramesside period (1292-1075 BC) and its high artistic quality indicates that was produced for a wealthy audience. No other similar scrolls have yet been discovered.\n\nThe ancient Greeks painted sexual scenes on their ceramics, many of them famous for being some of the earliest depictions of same-sex relations and pederasty, and there are numerous sexually explicit paintings on the walls of ruined Roman buildings in Pompeii. The Moche of Peru in South America are another ancient people that sculpted explicit scenes of sex into their pottery. There is an entire gallery devoted to pre-Columbian erotic ceramics (Moche culture) in Lima at the Larco Museum.\n\nAdditionally, there has been a long tradition of erotic painting in Eastern cultures. In Japan, for example, shunga appeared in the 13th century and continued to grow in popularity until the late 19th century when photography was invented. Similarly, the erotic art of China reached its popular peak during the latter part of the Ming Dynasty. In India, the famous Kama Sutra is an ancient sex manual that is still popularly read throughout the world.\n\nIn Europe, starting with the Renaissance, there was a tradition of producing erotica for the amusement of the aristocracy. In the early 16th century, the text \"I Modi\" was a woodcut album created by the designer Giulio Romano, the engraver Marcantonio Raimondi and the poet Pietro Aretino. In 1601 Caravaggio painted the \"Amor Vincit Omnia,\" for the collection of the Marquis Vincenzo Giustiniani.\n\nAn erotic cabinet, ordered by Catherine the Great, seems to have been adjacent to her suite of rooms in the Gatchina Palace. The furniture was highly eccentric with tables that had large penises for legs. Penises and vaginas were carved on the furniture. The walls were covered in erotic art. The rooms and the furniture were seen in 1941 by two Wehrmacht-officers but they seem to have vanished since then. A documentary by Peter Woditsch suggests that the cabinet was in the Peterhof Palace and not in Gatchina.\n\nThe tradition was continued by other, more modern painters, such as Fragonard, Courbet, Millet, Balthus, Picasso, Edgar Degas, Toulouse-Lautrec and Egon Schiele. Schiele served time in jail and had several works destroyed by the authorities for offending contemporary mores with his depictions of nude girls.\n\nBy the 20th century, photography became the most common medium for erotic art. Publishers like Taschen mass-produced erotic illustrations and erotic photography.\n\nToday, erotic artists thrive, although in some circles, much of the genre is still not as well accepted as the more standard genres of art such as portraiture and landscape. During the last few centuries, society has broadened its view of what can be considered as art and several new styles developed during the 19th century such as Impressionism and Realism. This has given today's artists a broad variety of genres from which to choose, including; fantasy, pinup, horror, fetish, comics, anime, hentai, and many other niche genres all with erotic elements.\n\nClassic \"war-era\" pin-ups like the works of Alberto Vargas, Gil Elvgren and Baron Von Lind, are still as popular as their contemporaries: Bunny Yeager, Greg Hildebrandt, Olivia De Berardinis, Hajime Sorayama, Alain Aslan, and others.\n\nThe acceptance and popularity of erotic art has pushed the genre into mainstream pop-culture and has created many famous icons. Frank Frazetta, Luis Royo, Boris Vallejo, Chris Achilleos, and Clyde Caldwell are among the artists whose work has been widely distributed. The Guild of Erotic Artists were formed in 2002 to bring together a body of like minded individuals whose sole purpose was to express themselves and promote the sensual art of erotica for the modern age.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2015 sexologist and gallerist Laura Henkel, curator of the Erotic Heritage Museum and the Sin City Gallery, organised 12 Inches of Sin, an exhibition focussing on art that expresses a diverse view of sexuality and challenging ideas of high and low art. In 2015 Henkel collaborated with former MoMA curator and art historian Rosa JH Berland to create the Modern Provocateur Manifesto, that describes artwork that is about human sexuality.\n\nWhether or not an instance of erotic art is obscene depends on the standards of the jurisdisction and community in which it is displayed.\n\nIn the United States, the 1973 ruling of the Supreme Court of the United States in \"Miller v. California\" established a three-tiered test to determine what was obscene—and thus not protected, versus what was merely erotic and thus protected by the First Amendment.\n\nDelivering the opinion of the court, Chief Justice Warren Burger wrote, \nThe basic guidelines for the trier of fact must be: (a) whether 'the average person, applying contemporary community standards' would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\nAs this is still much more vague than other judicial tests within U.S. jurisprudence, it has not reduced the conflicts that often result, especially from the ambiguities concerning what the \"contemporary community standards\" are. Similar difficulties in distinguishing between erotica and obscenity have been found in other legal systems.\n\n"}

She cites the goals of feminist criticism as (1) developing and uncovering a female tradition of writing, (2) interpreting symbolism of women's writing so that it will not be lost or ignored by the male point of view, (3) rediscovering old texts, (4) analyzing women writers and their writings from a female perspective, (5) resisting sexism in literature, and (6) increasing awareness of the sexual politics of language and style. Feminist revisionist mythology tends to fulfill at least one of these goals. Instead of just studying prior works though, it is the revision of old texts to create new ones.\n\nRevision Mythmaking is a strategic revisionist use of gender imagery and is a means of exploring and attempting to transform the self and the culture or, in other words, to \"subvert and transform the life and literature women poets inherit\".\n\nAlicia Ostriker states in her essay \"Stealing the Language\" that \"we cannot measure the work of women poets, past or present, without a thorough--and if possible demystified-- awareness of the critical context in which they have composed and continued to compose their work. We need to recognize that our customary literary language is systematically gendered in ways that influence what we approve and disapprove of, making it extremely difficult for us to acknowledge certain kinds of originality--of difference--in women poets\". \"The belief that true poetry is genderless—which is a disguised form of believing that true poetry is masculine—means that we have not learned to see women poets generically, to recognize the tradition they belong to, or discuss either the limitation or the strengths of that tradition\".\n\nAuthors have used multiple methods of revising myths, including retelling them entirely from the point of view of the main female character, recreating the story in a way that attempts to break down the treatment of women as inactive objects, and telling the story with a feminist narrator who satirically pokes fun at the flawed view of women in the original text.\n\n\"Fables are centuries old and were devised to carry a moral lesson, such as Aesop's Fables. Suniti Namjoshi's eloquent and knowledgeable 'Blue Donkey' stories draw on this classic tradition of having beasts or mythical birds able to speak and act like humans but the 'Blue Donkey' provides ironic comment rather than a moral lesson. Angela Carter has rewritten fairy tales from the point of view of the heroine. In her collection, \"The Bloody Chamber\", she examines the messages about adolescent sexuality in stories like 'Beauty and the Beast' and 'Snow White' overturning the sexual mythology of simple fairy stories.\"\n\nSince the core of revisionist mythmaking for feminist poets lies in the challenging of gender stereotypes embodied in myth, revisionism in its most obvious form consists of hit-and-run attacks on familiar images and the social and literary conventions supporting them. The poems dismantle the literary convention to reveal the social ones and invert both, usually by the simple device of making \"the Other\" into the primary subject.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5642853", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5642853", "title": "Gambling and information theory", "text": "Gambling and information theory\n\nStatistical inference might be thought of as gambling theory applied to the world around us. The myriad applications for logarithmic information measures tell us precisely how to take the best guess in the face of partial information. In that sense, information theory might be considered a formal expression of the theory of gambling. It is no surprise, therefore, that information theory has applications to games of chance.\n\nKelly betting or proportional betting is an application of information theory to investing and gambling. Its discoverer was John Larry Kelly, Jr.\n\nPart of Kelly's insight was to have the gambler maximize the expectation of the \"logarithm\" of his capital, rather than the expected profit from each bet. This is important, since in the latter case, one would be led to gamble all he had when presented with a favorable bet, and if he lost, would have no capital with which to place subsequent bets. Kelly realized that it was the logarithm of the gambler's capital which is additive in sequential bets, and \"to which the law of large numbers applies.\"\n\nA bit is the amount of entropy in a bettable event with two possible outcomes and even odds. Obviously we could double our money if we knew beforehand for certain what the outcome of that event would be. Kelly's insight was that no matter how complicated the betting scenario is, we can use an optimum betting strategy, called the Kelly criterion, to make our money grow exponentially with whatever side information we are able to obtain. The value of this \"illicit\" side information is measured as mutual information relative to the outcome of the betable event:\n\nwhere \"Y\" is the side information, \"X\" is the outcome of the betable event, and \"I\" is the state of the bookmaker's knowledge. This is the average Kullback–Leibler divergence, or information gain, of the \"a posteriori\" probability distribution of \"X\" given the value of \"Y\" relative to the \"a priori\" distribution, or stated odds, on \"X\". Notice that the expectation is taken over \"Y\" rather than \"X\": we need to evaluate how accurate, in the long term, our side information \"Y\" is before we start betting real money on \"X\". This is a straightforward application of Bayesian inference. Note that the side information \"Y\" might affect not just our knowledge of the event \"X\" but also the event itself. For example, \"Y\" might be a horse that had too many oats or not enough water. The same mathematics applies in this case, because from the bookmaker's point of view, the occasional race fixing is already taken into account when he makes his odds.\n\nThe nature of side information is extremely finicky. We have already seen that it can affect the actual event as well as our knowledge of the outcome. Suppose we have an informer, who tells us that a certain horse is going to win. We certainly do not want to bet all our money on that horse just upon a rumor: that informer may be betting on another horse, and may be spreading rumors just so he can get better odds himself. Instead, as we have indicated, we need to evaluate our side information in the long term to see how it correlates with the outcomes of the races. This way we can determine exactly how reliable our informer is, and place our bets precisely to maximize the expected logarithm of our capital according to the Kelly criterion. Even if our informer is lying to us, we can still profit from his lies if we can find some reverse correlation between his tips and the actual race results.\n\nDoubling rate in gambling on a horse race is \n\nwhere there are formula_3 horses, the probability of the formula_4th horse winning being formula_5, the proportion of wealth bet on the horse being formula_6, and the odds (payoff) being formula_7 (e.g., formula_8 if the formula_4th horse winning pays double the amount bet). This quantity is maximized by proportional (Kelly) gambling:\n\nfor which\n\nwhere formula_12 is information entropy.\n\nAn important but simple relation exists between the amount of side information a gambler obtains and the expected exponential growth of his capital (Kelly):\n\nfor an optimal betting strategy, where formula_14 is the initial capital, formula_15 is the capital after the \"t\"th bet, and formula_16 is the amount of side information obtained concerning the \"i\"th bet (in particular, the mutual information relative to the outcome of each betable event). This equation applies in the absence of any transaction costs or minimum bets. When these constraints apply (as they invariably do in real life), another important gambling concept comes into play: the gambler (or unscrupulous investor) must face a certain probability of ultimate ruin, which is known as the gambler's ruin scenario. Note that even food, clothing, and shelter can be considered fixed transaction costs and thus contribute to the gambler's probability of ultimate ruin.\n\nThis equation was the first application of Shannon's theory of information outside its prevailing paradigm of data communications (Pierce).\n\nThe logarithmic probability measure self-information or surprisal, whose average is information entropy/uncertainty and whose average difference is KL-divergence, has applications to odds-analysis all by itself. Its two primary strengths are that surprisals: (i) reduce minuscule probabilities to numbers of manageable size, and (ii) add whenever probabilities multiply.\n\nFor example, one might say that \"the number of states equals two to the number of bits\" i.e. #states = 2. Here the quantity that's measured in bits is the logarithmic information measure mentioned above. Hence there are N bits of surprisal in landing all heads on one's first toss of N coins.\n\nThe additive nature of surprisals, and one's ability to get a feel for their meaning with a handful of coins, can help one put improbable events (like winning the lottery, or having an accident) into context. For example if one out of 17 million tickets is a winner, then the surprisal of winning from a single random selection is about 24 bits. Tossing 24 coins a few times might give you a feel for the surprisal of getting all heads on the first try.\n\nThe additive nature of this measure also comes in handy when weighing alternatives. For example, imagine that the surprisal of harm from a vaccination is 20 bits. If the surprisal of catching a disease without it is 16 bits, but the surprisal of harm from the disease if you catch it is 2 bits, then the surprisal of harm from NOT getting the vaccination is only 16+2=18 bits. Whether or not you decide to get the vaccination (e.g. the monetary cost of paying for it is not included in this discussion), you can in that way at least take responsibility for a decision informed to the fact that not getting the vaccination involves more than one bit of additional risk.\n\nMore generally, one can relate probability p to bits of surprisal \"sbits\" as probability = 1/2. As suggested above, this is mainly useful with small probabilities. However, Jaynes pointed out that with true-false assertions one can also define bits of evidence \"ebits\" as the surprisal against minus the surprisal for. This evidence in bits relates simply to the odds ratio = p/(1-p) = 2, and has advantages similar to those of self-information itself.\n\nInformation theory can be thought of as a way of quantifying information so as to make the best decision in the face of imperfect information. That is, how to make the best decision using only the information you have available. The point of betting is to rationally assess all relevant variables of an uncertain game/race/match, then compare them to the bookmaker's assessments, which usually comes in the form of odds or spreads and \nplace the proper bet if the assessments differ sufficiently. The area of gambling where this has the most use is sports betting. Sports handicapping lends itself to information theory extremely well because of the availability of statistics. For many years noted economists have tested different mathematical theories using sports as their laboratory, with vastly differing results.\n\nOne theory regarding sports betting is that it is a random walk. Random walk is a scenario where new information, prices and returns will fluctuate by chance, this is part of the efficient market hypothesis. The underlying belief of the efficient market hypothesis is that the market will always make adjustments for any new information. Therefore no one can beat the market because they are trading on the same information from which the market adjusted. However, according to Fama, to have an efficient market three qualities need to be met:\n\n\nStatisticians have shown that it's the third condition which allows for information theory to be useful in sports handicapping. When everyone doesn't agree on how information will affect the outcome of the event, we get differing opinions.\n\n\n"}

There are also hybrid pocket/carom games such as English billiards.\nThe term \"\" is sometimes used to refer to all of the cue sports, to a specific class of them, or to specific ones such as English billiards; this article uses the term in its most generic sense unless otherwise noted.\n\nThe labels \"British\" and \"UK\" as applied to entries in this glossary refer to terms originating in the UK and also used in countries that were fairly recently part of the British Empire and/or are part of the Commonwealth of Nations, as opposed to US (and, often, Canadian) terminology. The terms \"American\" or \"US\" as applied here refer generally to North American usage. However, due to the predominance of US-originating terminology in most internationally competitive pool (as opposed to snooker), US terms are also common in the pool context in other countries in which English is at least a minority language, and US (and borrowed French) terms predominate in carom billiards. Similarly, British terms predominate in the world of snooker, English billiards and blackball, regardless of the players' nationalities.\n\nThe term \"blackball\" is used in this glossary to refer to both blackball and eight-ball pool as played in the Commonwealth, as a shorthand. Blackball was chosen because it is less ambiguous (\"eight-ball pool\" is too easily confused with the related \"eight-ball\"), and blackball is globally standardized by an International Olympic Committee-recognized governing body, the World Pool-Billiard Association (WPA); meanwhile, its ancestor, eight-ball pool, is largely a folk game, like North American , and to the extent that its rules have been codified, they have been done so by competing authorities with different rulesets. (For the same reason, the glossary's information on eight-ball and nine-ball draws principally on the stable WPA rules, because there are many competing amateur leagues and even professional tours with divergent rules for these games.)\n\nForeign-language terms are generally not within the scope of this list, unless they have become an integral part of billiards terminology in English (e.g. ), or they are crucial to meaningful discussion of a game not widely known in the English-speaking world.\n\n In Russian pyramid, the cue ball is usually red, but any ball can be used as a cue ball, with the exception of \"dynamic pyramid\" variant.\n"}

It is the tenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by James Gunn, who wrote the screenplay with Nicole Perlman, and features an ensemble cast including Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel, and Bradley Cooper as the titular Guardians, along with Lee Pace, Michael Rooker, Karen Gillan, Djimon Hounsou, John C. Reilly, Glenn Close, and Benicio del Toro. In \"Guardians of the Galaxy\", Peter Quill forms an uneasy alliance with a group of extraterrestrial criminals who are fleeing after stealing a powerful artifact.\n\nPerlman began working on the screenplay in 2009. Producer Kevin Feige first publicly mentioned \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" as a potential film in 2010 and Marvel Studios announced it was in active development at the San Diego Comic-Con International in July 2012. Gunn was hired to write and direct the film that September. In February 2013, Pratt was hired to play Peter Quill / Star-Lord, and the supporting cast members were subsequently confirmed. Principal photography began in July 2013 at Shepperton Studios in England, with filming continuing in London before wrapping up in October 2013. Post-production was finished on July 7, 2014.\n\nThe film premiered in Hollywood on July 21, 2014, and was released in theaters on August 1, 2014 in the United States in the 3D and IMAX 3D formats. The film became a critical and commercial success, grossing $773.3 million worldwide and becoming the highest-grossing superhero film of 2014, as well as the third-highest-grossing film of 2014. The film was praised for its humor, acting, direction, soundtrack, visual effects, and action sequences. At the 87th Academy Awards, the film received nominations for Best Visual Effects and Best Makeup and Hairstyling. A sequel, \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\", was released on May 5, 2017. A third film, \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\", which was initially being developed for a 2020 release, has been put on hold after the firing of director James Gunn.\n\nIn 1988, following his mother's death, a young Peter Quill is abducted from Earth by the Ravagers, a group of space pirates led by Yondu Udonta. Twenty-six years later on the planet Morag, Quill steals a mysterious orb but is attacked by Korath, a subordinate to the fanatical Kree, Ronan. Although Quill escapes with the orb, Yondu discovers his theft and issues a bounty for his capture, while Ronan sends the assassin Gamora after the orb.\n\nWhen Quill attempts to sell the orb on Xandar, capital of the Nova Empire, Gamora ambushes him and steals it. A fight ensues, drawing in a pair of bounty hunters: the genetically and cybernetically modified raccoon Rocket, and the tree-like humanoid Groot. Nova Corps officers capture the four, detaining them in the Kyln prison. A powerful inmate there, Drax, attempts to kill Gamora due to her association with Ronan and Thanos, who killed his family. Quill convinces Drax that Gamora can bring Ronan to him, though Gamora reveals that she has betrayed Ronan, unwilling to let him use the orb's power. Learning that Gamora has a buyer for the orb, Quill, Rocket, Groot, and Drax work with her to escape the Kyln in Quill's ship, the \"Milano\".\n\nRonan meets with Gamora's adoptive father, Thanos, to discuss her betrayal. Quill's group flee to Knowhere, a remote criminal outpost in space built in the giant severed head of a Celestial. A drunken Drax summons Ronan while the rest of the group meet Gamora's contact, the collector Taneleer Tivan. Tivan opens the orb, revealing an Infinity Stone, an item of immeasurable power that destroys all but the most powerful beings who wield it. Tivan's slave Carina grabs the Stone, triggering an explosion that engulfs Tivan's archive.\n\nRonan arrives and easily defeats Drax, while the others flee by ship, pursued by Ronan's followers and Gamora's adoptive sister Nebula. Nebula destroys Gamora's ship, leaving her floating in space, and Ronan's fighters capture the orb. Quill contacts Yondu before following Gamora into space, giving her his helmet to survive; Yondu arrives and retrieves the pair. Rocket, Drax, and Groot threaten to attack Yondu's ship to rescue them, but Quill negotiates a truce, promising the orb to Yondu. Quill's group agrees that facing Ronan means certain death, but that they cannot let him use the Infinity Stone to destroy the galaxy. On Ronan's flagship, the \"Dark Aster\", Ronan embeds the Stone in his warhammer, taking its power for himself. He contacts Thanos, threatening to kill him after first destroying Xandar; hateful of her adoptive father, Nebula allies with Ronan.\n\nThe Ravagers and Quill's group join with the Nova Corps to confront the \"Dark Aster\" at Xandar, with Quill's group breaching the \"Dark Aster\" with the \"Milano\". Ronan uses his empowered warhammer to destroy the Nova Corps fleet. Drax and Gamora defeat Korath and Nebula, the latter escaping, but the group find themselves outmatched by Ronan's power until Rocket crashes a Ravager ship through the \"Dark Aster\". The damaged \"Dark Aster\" crash-lands on Xandar, with Groot sacrificing himself to shield the group. Ronan emerges from the wreck and prepares to destroy Xandar, but Quill distracts him, allowing Drax and Rocket to destroy Ronan's warhammer. Quill grabs the freed Stone, and with Gamora, Drax, and Rocket sharing its burden, they use it to destroy Ronan.\n\nIn the aftermath, Quill tricks Yondu into taking a container supposedly containing the Stone, and gives the real Stone to the Nova Corps. As the Ravagers leave Xandar, Yondu remarks that it turned out well that they did not deliver Quill to his father per their contract. Quill's group, now known as the Guardians of the Galaxy, have their criminal records expunged, and Quill learns that he is only half-human, his father being part of an ancient, unknown species. Quill finally opens the last present he received from his mother: a cassette tape filled with her favorite songs. The Guardians leave in the rebuilt \"Milano\" along with a sapling cut from Groot.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, Tivan sits in his destroyed archive with two of his living exhibits: a canine cosmonaut and an anthropomorphic duck.\n\n\nAdditionally, Josh Brolin appears, uncredited, as Thanos through voice acting and performance capture. Sean Gunn stood in for Thanos during filming and portrays Kraglin, Yondu's first mate in the Ravagers. Alexis Denisof reprises his role as Thanos's vizier, \"The Other\", from \"The Avengers\". Ophelia Lovibond plays Carina, the Collector's slave; Peter Serafinowicz plays Denarian Garthan Saal, a Nova Corps officer; Gregg Henry plays Quill's grandfather; Laura Haddock plays Quill's mother, Meredith; Melia Kreiling plays Bereet; Christopher Fairbank plays The Broker; Mikaela Hoover plays Nova Prime's assistant; Marama Corlett plays a pit boss at the bar, The Boot; Emmett J. Scanlan plays a Nova riot guard; Alexis Rodney plays Moloka Dar; Tom Proctor plays Horuz, a Ravager; and Spencer Wilding plays a prison guard who confiscates Quill's Walkman. Canine actor Fred appears as Cosmo. Stephen Blackehart had a supporting role. Naomi Ryan also had a supporting role in the film, though it was cut in the final version. Cameos in the film include: James Gunn as a Sakaaran; Stan Lee as a Xandarian Ladies' Man; Lloyd Kaufman as an inmate; Nathan Fillion as the voice of an inmate; Rob Zombie as the voice of the Ravager Navigator; composer Tyler Bates as a Ravager pilot; and Seth Green as the voice of Howard the Duck.\n\nMarvel Studios President Kevin Feige first mentioned \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" as a potential film at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International, stating, \"There are some obscure titles, too, like \"Guardians of the Galaxy\". I think they've been revamped recently in a fun way in the [comic] book.\" Feige reiterated that sentiment in a September 2011 issue of \"Entertainment Weekly\", saying, \"There's an opportunity to do a big space epic, which \"Thor\" sort of hints at, in the cosmic side\" of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Feige added, should the film be made, it would feature an ensemble of characters, similar to \"X-Men\" and \"The Avengers\".\n\nFeige announced that the film was in active development at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International during the Marvel Studios panel, with an intended release date of August 1, 2014. He stated that the film's titular team would consist of the characters Star-Lord, Drax the Destroyer, Gamora, Groot, and Rocket Raccoon. Two pieces of concept art were also displayed, one of Rocket Raccoon, and one featuring the entire team. In August 2012, James Gunn entered talks to direct the film, beating out other contenders, including Peyton Reed and the duo Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck. \"The Avengers\" director Joss Whedon, who signed a deal to creatively consult on all of the films leading up to , was enthusiastic about the selection of Gunn to direct, saying \"James [Gunn] is what makes me think it will work ... He is so off the wall, and so crazy, but so smart, such a craftsman and he builds from his heart. He loves the raccoon. Needs the raccoon ... He has a very twisted take on it, but it all comes from a real love for the material. It's going to be hard for [the human characters] to keep up.\"\n\nNicole Perlman, who was enrolled in Marvel's screenwriting program in 2009, was offered several of their lesser known properties to base a screenplay on. Out of those, Perlman chose Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning's \"Guardians of the Galaxy\", due to her interest in space and science fiction, adding, \"I think [Marvel] were a little taken aback when I chose \"Guardians\", because there were ones that would make a lot more sense if you were a romantic-comedy writer or something like that.\" Perlman spent two years writing a draft, immersing herself in the \"Guardians\" universe, and was asked in late 2011 to create another draft, before Gunn was brought in in early 2012 to contribute to the script. Gunn eventually rewrote the script entirely because \"it didn't work\" for him; he would use the film \"The Dirty Dozen\" as a reference to convey his ideas of the film to Marvel. Gunn later explained that Perlman's draft was very different from the script he used during filming, including a different story, character arcs and no Walkman; he stated, \"In Nicole's script everything is pretty different ... it's not about the same stuff. But that's how the WGA works. They like first writers an awful lot.\" In August 2012, Marvel Studios hired writer Chris McCoy to rewrite Perlman's script, however, it is unclear what contribution he had to the final script, since he did not receive production credit.\n\nGunn revealed that character introductions were the \"hardest scenes to crack\", with Thanos' introduction being the most difficult. He felt that \"having Thanos be in that scene was more helpful to the [MCU] than it was to \"Guardians of the Galaxy\",\" yet he still wanted Thanos in the film, without \"[belittling] the actual antagonist of the film, which is Ronan.\" To solve his dilemma, Gunn chose to have Ronan kill \"The Other\", Thanos' vizier, saying, \"I thought that was interesting, because we've had the Other, who's obviously very powerful even in comparison to Loki, and then we see Ronan wipe his ass with him. So that I liked, but even that was sort of difficult, because it played as funnier when I first wrote it, and the humor didn't work so much.\"\n\nIn September 2012, Gunn confirmed that he had signed on to direct the film and rewrite the script. By the end of November, Joel Edgerton, Jack Huston, Jim Sturgess, and Eddie Redmayne signed deals to test for the role of Peter Quill, as did Lee Pace, which he confirmed a week later in early December. Other actors who were considered for the role included \"\"s Zachary Levi, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Michael Rosenbaum, and John Gallagher Jr. Chris Pratt was cast in the role in February 2013, as part of a multi-film deal that he signed with Marvel.\nIn January 2013, filming was scheduled to take place at Shepperton Studios in London, United Kingdom, and Marvel Studios announced that the film would be released in 3D. Victoria Alonso, an executive producer on the film, said that filming would begin in June. She also said that both Rocket Raccoon and Groot would be created through a combination of CGI and motion capture, going on to say that \"You can't do any motion capture with a raccoon—they won't let you put the suit on. But we will do rotomation, probably, for some of the behavior ... we definitely will have performers to emulate what James Gunn will lead to be, the behavior and the performance. He's very clear on where he wants to take the characters.\" In March 2013, Feige discussed \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" in relation to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, saying, \"It's much more of a standalone film. It takes place in the same universe. And when we've been on the other side of that universe in other movies, you might see those characteristics in Guardians, but the Avengers are not involved with what's happening out there at this time.\" Feige also stated that 95% of the film would take place in space. In mid-March, Dave Bautista was signed to play Drax the Destroyer. Other actors who had been considered for the role included Isaiah Mustafa, Brian Patrick Wade, and Jason Momoa. By the following week, sculptor Brian Muir, who sculpted Darth Vader's mask for the \"Star Wars\" films, was revealed to be working on the film.\n\nIn early April 2013, Zoe Saldana entered into negotiations to star as Gamora in the film, and it was confirmed she had been cast later that month. Also in April, Michael Rooker joined the film's cast as Yondu, and it was announced that Ophelia Lovibond had been cast in a supporting role. By this point in time, Lee Pace was in final negotiations to play the villain of the film. In May, Marvel offered John C. Reilly the role of Rhomann Dey. At the same time, it was disclosed that filmmakers were looking at actors including Hugh Laurie, Alan Rickman, and Ken Watanabe, for another role, and that Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely were providing finishing touches to the script. A few days later, Glenn Close was cast as the head of the Nova Corps in the film, followed shortly by the casting of Karen Gillan as the film's lead female villain. By June 2013, Benicio del Toro was cast in the film, as part of a multi-film deal with Marvel Studios. Later in the month, it was confirmed that Reilly had been cast as Rhomann Dey.\n\nSpecial effects makeup designer David White took head and body casts of actors, such as Bautista, to experiment with materials used to create the characters. White said, \"James always pushed for practical and makeup effects. He wanted, like me, to see the real deal there on set.\" White was careful not to use \"modern\" creature designs to ensure they did not fall short in Gunn's uniquely envisioned world. White and his team created upwards of 1,000 prosthetic makeup applications and 2,000 molds of different-colored aliens. For the specific aesthetic look to the film, Gunn wanted to create \"a colorful science-fiction world\", and include elements of 1950s and '60s pulp movies, citing the Ravagers' spaceships, which he compared to muscle cars, as an example of the latter. Science fiction artist Chris Foss inspired and helped design the final look of some of the spacecrafts that appear in the film. The \"Mass Effect\" video game series, Flash Gordon, \"Farscape\", and \"Star Wars\" were primary inspirations for Gunn on the film.\n\nPrincipal photography began around July 6, 2013 in London, United Kingdom, under the working title of \"Full Tilt\". Filming took place at Shepperton Studios and Longcross Studios. Later in July, Gunn and the film's cast flew from London to attend San Diego Comic-Con International, where it was revealed that Pace would play Ronan the Accuser, Gillan would be Nebula, del Toro as The Collector, and that Djimon Hounsou had been cast as Korath. Close was later revealed to play Nova Prime Irani Rael. Also at San Diego Comic-Con, Feige stated that Thanos would be a part of the film as the \"mastermind\". On August 11, 2013, filming began at London's Millennium Bridge, which was selected as a double for Xandar. In August 2013, Marvel announced that Bradley Cooper would voice Rocket. On September 3, 2013, Gunn said that filming was \"a little over half[way]\" complete. Also in September, Vin Diesel stated that he was voicing Groot. However, Marvel did not confirm Diesel's involvement in the film at the time. On October 12, 2013, Gunn announced on social media that filming had completed.\n\nDirector of photography Ben Davis used Arri Alexa XT cameras for the film, saying, \"I'm traditionally a photochemical fan, but going with the digital format was the right way for this movie ... the Alexa [provided] the right look for this particular film.\" During the opening scenes in the 1980s, Davis chose JDC Cooke Xtal (Crystal) Express anamorphic prime lenses because they \"had more anamorphic artifacts and aberrations, which [he] felt added something.\" Davis used spherical Panavision Primos for the rest of the film. Additionally, Davis worked closely with production designer Charles Wood in order to achieve the correct lighting looks for each scene. Dealing with two fully CGI characters forced Davis to shoot scenes multiple times, usually once with the references for the characters and once without them in the shot.\n\nGunn revealed that his brother, Sean Gunn, took on multiple roles during the filming process, such as standing in for Rocket, which he noted was beneficial for the other actors, including Saldana, Pratt, and Bautista, who responded positively to Sean and his on-set performances. Special effects makeup designer David White made two life-size versions of Rocket and a bust of Groot as aids for visual effects, with White saying, \"it gives [the filmmakers] a good indication of where visual effects needs to pick up and whether Rocket can actually reach certain things or use certain devices.\" These busts were also used to see how the on-set lighting would affect the characters, to assist with the visual effects lighting process.\n\nIn January 2015, Disney revealed that the film came in \"slightly over the agreed budget\" at $232.3 million, with Disney receiving a rebate of $36.4 million from the British government. It was previously estimated to have had a $170 million budget.\n\nIn November 2013, Gunn stated that he attempted to use as many practical effects as possible while filming to aid the use of CGI and motion capture during post-production, saying, \"Our sets are enormous. We have a prison that is 350,000 pounds of steel. Anybody who knows me knows I love the mix of practical and CGI effects ... I can't wait for people to see it, because it's astonishingly beautiful.\" After the release of \"\", Feige stated that the Infinity Stones would be a focus in the film, as well as going forward into the Phase Three slate of films within the MCU. In a separate interview for \"The Dark World\" in November, Feige added that a third, unknown Infinity Stone would be seen in the film, referred to as the \"Power Stone\" by the Collector. The mid-credits scene in \"The Dark World\" revealed Lovibond's role as the Collector's slave, later named Carina. In December 2013, Marvel confirmed that Diesel would voice Groot.\n\nA few weeks of additional filming, involving the film's main cast and crew, occurred in March 2014 at Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California. In April 2014, Gunn described Thanos as the \"head of the snake\" in the film, and confirmed he would appear via performance capture. In May 2014, Gunn stated that the film features an \"enormous\" amount of smaller and minor characters from the Marvel Universe, adding that he felt the film had the most characters overall of any Marvel Studios film to date. Costume supervisor Dan Grace added to this by saying, \"We really, really get the feeling of the scale and scope of the galaxy. We visit five planets, we see a hundred different races.\" The film introduces the alien race Sakaaran, who act as Ronan's mercenaries, as a replacement to the Badoon, as the Badoon film rights belonged to 20th Century Fox.\n\nBy the end of May, Josh Brolin was revealed as the voice of Thanos, with Feige confirming in July that Brolin also provided the performance capture for the character. Thanos communicates via hologram for much of the film, though he does appear in a scene with Ronan and Nebula. In June 2014, Feige added that Thanos and his followers are \"the biggest piece of connective tissue that will eventually lead us back into \"Avengers\" films in the future.\" On casting Brolin, Feige said,\n\nWe reached out to him and it was one of those things that does not happen all the time but when it does it's very nice, where he was totally intrigued. He was a fan of what we did, he met with Jeremy Latcham in a hotel in London and learned about the characters a little bit. I spoke to him on the phone a few times. We ran it by James who loved it, ran it by Joss [Whedon] who loved it because Thanos is in this universe because of \"Avengers\". Then we shot him and recorded for it.\n\nOn July 7, 2014, Gunn announced on social media that he had completed work on the film. In August, regarding the post-credit scene, Gunn revealed that the scene did not involve Howard the Duck when it was originally filmed, rather he was added during post-production, a decision made by \"some combination of [Gunn] and the editor Fred Raskin\". As the decision to add the character was made late in the post-production process, he had to be designed that day, before being handed off to Sony Pictures Imageworks to animate. Also in August, regarding the pre-credit scene of Groot dancing, Gunn stated that he himself danced to provide motion reference for the animators, and that the decision was made to place the scene before the credits, rather than during or after them, because of positive responses from a test audience, which made Marvel and Gunn feel that they did not want \"people walking out and missing this thing\". Marvel used design firm Sarofsky once again for the film's title sequences, after liking their work for \"\". Sarofsky developed a custom typeface based on the font used in the teaser posters for the opening credits, which was tinted orange to offer a better contrast to the film's blue and grey imagery. One of the typography solutions offered before the final product wound up being repurposed as the locator cards seen throughout the film.\n\nThe film featured 2,750 visual effects shots, which make up approximately 90% of the film. The visual effects were created by: Moving Picture Company (MPC), who worked on creating Groot, as well as Morag, Xandar, the \"Dark Aster\" and the final battle on Xandar; Framestore, who worked on creating Rocket, extending the Kyln prison set and constructing Knowhere; Luma Pictures, who worked on Thanos; Method Studios, who worked on creating the Orb opening and revealing its powers, as well as the holographic displays at the Nova Corps command center; Lola VFX; Cantina Creative; Sony Pictures Imageworks, who worked on Howard the Duck and creating the \"Dark Aster\" shots with MPC; CoSA VFX; Secret Lab; Rise Visual Effects Studios; and Technicolor VFX. Pre- and post-visualizations were done by Proof and The Third Floor, with Proof also contributing to the creation of Rocket and Groot.\n\nProducer Nik Korda noted how helpful it was to have Sean Gunn and Krystian Godlewski portray Rocket and Groot on set, as it provided references for lighting and on-set performances to the animators. When creating Groot, MPC realized early on that his eyes would be essential in maintaining the character's human qualities, as his face couldn't move in the way that humans' do. MPC visual effects supervisor Nicolas Aithadi explained that, \"When you look at humans what makes the eyes interesting is the imperfections—trying to make these two irises not aimed at the same place—trying to make them strange and look more human.\" Textures for Groot came from a number of sources, including inspiration from a botanical garden in London, and the character was modeled as individual branches, rigged individually, to simulate a muscle system for the character.\n\nOne of the major challenges for Framestore in creating Rocket was his fur. Framestore's Rachel Williams explained that, since \"raccoon fur is made up from a layer of short fine hair and a layer of longer thicker hairs\", these layers were separated and animated individually, removing the need to use \"guide hairs\" to control the movements of thick sections of fur. Framestore and MPC worked closely sharing assets, to ensure shots of Rocket at MPC would match the Rocket created by Framestore, and vice versa for when Groot was needed by the other studio.\n\nIn order to give Thanos \"the performance and the weight that he deserved\", Luma Pictures created a new facial animation system to re-create Josh Brolin as a fully CG character, using his \"eyes, some of his cheek, how his muscles move when he talks\". The character's large jaw, and the deep groves that run down his face, had \"to be carefully planned out with the movement of his face.\"\n\nIn August 2013, Gunn revealed that Tyler Bates would be composing the film's score. Gunn stated that Bates would write some of the score first so that he can film to the music, as opposed to scoring to the film. In February 2014, Gunn revealed that the film would incorporate songs from the 1960s and 1970s, such as \"Hooked on a Feeling\", on a mixtape in Quill's Walkman, which acts as a way for him to stay connected to the Earth, home, and family he lost. In May 2014, Gunn added that using the songs from the '60s and '70s were \"cultural reference points\", saying, \"It's striking the balance throughout the whole movie, through something that is very unique, but also something that is easily accessible to people at the same time. The music and the Earth stuff is one of those touchstones that we have to remind us that, yeah, [Quill] is a real person from planet Earth who's just like you and me. Except that he's in this big outer space adventure.\"\n\nWhen choosing the songs, Gunn revealed he \"started the process by reading the \"Billboard\" charts for all of the top hits of the '70s\", downloading \"a few hundred\" songs that were \"semi-familiar—ones you recognize but might not be able to name off the top of your head\" and creating a playlist for all the songs that would fit the film tonally. He added that he \"would listen to the playlist on my speakers around the house—sometimes I would be inspired to create a scene around a song, and other times I had a scene that needed music and I would listen through the playlist, visualizing various songs, figuring out which would work the best.\" Most of the songs were played on set to help \"the actors and the camera operators find the perfect groove for the shot\", with David Bowie's \"Moonage Daydream\" the only song chosen and added during post-production. Gunn also said that the opening scenes were designed with \"Hooked on a Feeling\" in mind; however, once Gunn discovered \"Come and Get Your Love\", the song used in the sequence, Gunn felt it was a \"better fit.\"\n\nThree albums were released by Hollywood Records on July 29, 2014: The film's score, \"Guardians of the Galaxy (Original Score)\", which features the music composed by Bates for the film; \"Guardians of the Galaxy: Awesome Mix Vol. 1 (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\", which comprises the twelve songs from Quill's mixtape; and a deluxe edition featuring both albums. By August 2014, the album which mirrored Quill's mixtape had reached the top of the \"Billboard\" 200 chart, becoming the first soundtrack album in history consisting entirely of previously released songs to top the chart. Hollywood Records also released a cassette version of the \"Awesome Mix Vol. 1\" soundtrack on November 28, 2014, as an exclusive to Record Store Day participants. The cassette, which is the first cassette Disney Music Group has released since 2003, comes with a digital download version of the album.\n\nAt Disney's D23 Expo in August 2013, Feige presented footage first revealed at the San Diego Comic-Con in July 2013. The first trailer for the film debuted on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" on February 18, 2014, with a special introduction by Chris Pratt. The \"Los Angeles Times\" said the trailer delivered \"some spirited alien action, with exploding spaceships and muscled bad guys, not to mention a few purely comedic moments,\" while spotlighting \"a number of the offbeat characters.\" \"Total Film\" noted the similarity of the trailer's opening clip to the 1981 film, \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", which Gunn stated was a big influence for \"Guardians\", and made note of the \"edgy\" humor used throughout. \"Total Film\" also noted the similarity of the trailer to the one debuted at Comic-Con and D23, with a few new shots featuring Nebula and the Collector. Social media response to the trailer was strong, with 88,000 mentions across Twitter, Facebook and various blogs in a 12-hour period. Those numbers were comparable to trailers for other superhero films like \"Man of Steel\" and \"The Amazing Spider-Man 2\", and noteworthy for the late night-time period in which it premiered. The trailer received 22.8 million views in the 24 hours after it debuted. After the debut of the trailer, Blue Swede's version of \"Hooked on a Feeling\", which was prominently used throughout the trailer, went up 700% in sales the following day. The line from Serafinowicz's character, \"What a bunch of a-holes\", was only intended to be featured in the trailers, but due to its positive reception, was included in the final cut of the film. Gunn noted that a different teaser was almost released \"that was very cheesy [and] sold the movie as something different than what it was\", as it tested better than the version that was ultimately released. Gunn credited the marketing teams at Marvel and Disney for having faith in the latter version, despite how it tested, over choosing the version that would have mis-marketed the film.\n\nIn March 2014, the \"Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\" episode \"T.A.H.I.T.I.\" introduced the Kree race to the MCU, which began a storyline that recurs throughout the series and involves finding a hidden Kree city. Also in March, ABC aired a one-hour television special titled, \"\", which included a sneak peek of \"Guardians of the Galaxy\". Starting in April 2014, a two-part comic was released, titled \"Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy Prelude\". Written by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning, with art by Wellington Alves, the first issue focused on the background of Nebula and her bond with Thanos; the second issue featured the adventures of Rocket and Groot before they join forces with the other Guardians. In June 2014, Mike Pasciullo, senior VP of Marvel Studios, described the marketing approach for \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" by saying that Marvel had \"built a robust marketing program for the theatrical release that carefully integrates traditional advertising, social media, digital marketing, strategic promotional partnerships, organic entertainment integrations [and] publicity.\"\n\nIn July 2014, Marvel launched a viral marketing campaign for the film called \"Galaxy Getaways\", a fictional travel website that allows users to book passage to some of the planets depicted in the film, including Xandar, Morag, and Knowhere. Beginning July 4, 2014, a sneak peek of the film was presented at Disneyland and Disney's Hollywood Studios in the Magic Eye and ABC Sound Studio theaters, respectively. Approximately 14 minutes of the film was screened on July 7, 2014, in IMAX 3D in the United States, and 3D theaters and IMAX 3D in Canada, along with two trailers. The screening was met with positive reviews, praising the humor, the 3D and IMAX conversion, and Cooper's portrayal of Rocket. However, it was criticized for beginning partway through the film, not allowing viewers to easily acclimate to the film's tone, and for how the general audience might respond to a film within the MCU without established characters making appearances.\n\nOn July 12, 2014, Gunn and the actors from the film promoted \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" at the Lido 8 Cineplex in Singapore. On July 17, 2014, Disney Interactive released an action RPG video game titled \"Guardians of the Galaxy: The Universal Weapon\" for iOS, Android and Windows devices. The game's original story was written by Dan Abnett, and was meant to complement the film. On July 21, Pratt, Saldana, Bautista, Diesel and Cooper appeared on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" to promote the film and debut some additional exclusive content. On July 29, Pratt and Saldana rang the opening bell of the New York Stock Exchange as part of the film's marketing strategy.\n\nOn August 14, Marvel released the scene of Groot dancing, which was shortly followed by an announcement from Funko that they were releasing a toy \"Dancing Groot\". \"The Hollywood Reporter\" noted that the quick release of the scene from Marvel two weeks after the film's theatrical release, along with the rush announcement from Funko, indicated the popularity of both the character and the scene. The scene also produced the word \"grooting\", coined by Michael Rooker, in which a person dances similar to Groot, with the word entering the social media lexicon. Also in August, Marvel held a special screening of the film at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, where Pratt dressed as Star-Lord to entertain the patients.\n\nIn June 2012, Marvel filed eleven trademark applications for \"Guardians of the Galaxy\", covering a variety of consumer products, from video games to cosmetics. Disney Consumer Products partnered with Mad Engine, C-Life, New Era, Hasbro, Disguise, Rubies, Sideshow Collectibles, Lego, KIDdesigns, iHome, Funko, Freeze, Fast Forward, and Innovative Designs to produce merchandise for the film, with releases starting in June 2014. Mad Engine and C-Life were partnered as the core apparel outfitters, producing a line of T-shirts and fleece jackets, while New Era produced headwear and hats. Hasbro produced toys for the film; Disguise and Rubies produced the costumes; and Sideshow Collectibles was given charge of the collectibles. Lego announced three toy sets based on scenes from the film, while iHome created character speakers, Funko made vinyl bobbleheads, Freeze crafted 1980s-inspired apparel, and backpacks and stationery were made by Fast Forward and Innovative Designs. Despite first films in a potential new franchise usually being off-limits to licensees, Marvel used \"Iron Man\"s success as evidence of unknown characters becoming hits with audiences to attract partnerships. Licensees embraced Rocket as the film's potential breakout character, with Drax and Gamora being used for older demographics; Star-Lord's obsession with 1980s nostalgia, including his \"Awesome Mix Vo. 1\" cassette, has also served as a basis for tie-in products. In August 2014, Funko announced a toy based on \"Dancing Groot\", while in October 2014, Marvel and KID designs announced a replica of dancing Groot, for release in December 2014.\n\nIn December 2014, Disney made a second marketing push, to coincide with the film's home media release with additional merchandise. Merchandise partners included: KID designs with its replica dancing Groot; Funko's Fabrikations line with a plush Rocket; Mattel's Hot Wheels character cars; C-Life, Hybrid-Jem Sportswear, Freeze, MZ Berger, Accutime, AME and Her Universe with apparel; ThinkGeek with jewelry and watches; American Greetings with cards; Jay Franco with homegoods; and Vandor with drinkware. Additional partners included Mad Engine, Just Play, and Dragon Models. Paul Gitter, senior vice-president of Marvel licensing at Disney Consumer Products said, \"The demand for \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" merchandise has been truly out of this world. Our merchandising and retail partners are doing a tremendous job of providing creative and innovative ways for fans to continue interacting with these popular characters and showcase their fandom year round.\"\n\nThe world premiere of \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" was held on July 21, 2014, at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood. The film was released theatrically in the United Kingdom on July 31, 2014, and in the United States on August 1, in 3D and IMAX 3D. The film was released in 4,080 theaters in the United States, making it the widest August release, breaking the five-year record held by \"\" (4,007 theatres). The breakdown of venues was: 354 IMAX screens, 3,200 3D screens, 350 large format screens and 240 D-Box screens. In its sixth weekend, \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" was playing in 69 territories, its most.\n\nIn June 2014, Gunn stated that the film had always been planned as a 3D film, and \"Unlike many directors, I've been actively involved with converting every shot to 3D, making sure it works perfectly for the story and the film, making sure it's spectacular and immersive without being silly, distracting, or overly showy.\" Gunn also revealed that the IMAX 3D version would include shifting aspect ratios, to make the viewing experience \"even fuller and more encompassing. I've personally chosen all the places where the changes occur ... The changing aspect ratios in this case are actually a part of the storytelling.\" In July 2014, Gunn revealed that there were multiple scenes he had cut from the film, and he was investigating how to release them, either in an extended cut of the film, or as bonus features on the film's home media release.\n\n\"Guardians of the Galaxy\" was released for digital download by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on November 18, 2014 and on Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D, and DVD on November 24, 2014, in the United Kingdom and on December 9 in the United States. The digital and Blu-ray releases include behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, a blooper reel, and an exclusive preview of \"\". , the film has earned over $118 million in sales in the US.\n\nThe film was also included in the 13-disc box set, titled \"Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Two Collection\", which includes all of the Phase Two films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It was released on December 8, 2015.\n\n\"Guardians of the Galaxy\" earned $333.2 million in North America and an estimated $440.2 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $773.3 million. The film became the third-highest-grossing film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, behind \"The Avengers\" and \"Iron Man 3\". It was the third-highest-grossing 2014 film (behind \"\" and \"\") and the highest-grossing superhero film of 2014. It had a worldwide opening weekend of $160.7 million. \"Deadline Hollywood\" calculated the net profit for the film to be $204.2 million, when factoring together \"production budgets, P&A, talent participations and other costs, with box office grosses, and ancillary revenues from VOD to DVD and TV,\" placing it fifth on their list of 2014's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".\n\n\"Guardians of the Galaxy\" earned $11.2 million on its Thursday night pre-opening, surpassing \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\"s gross ($10.2 million) for the biggest Thursday evening start for a movie in 2014. IMAX accounted for 17% of the total gross ($1.9 million), which was the biggest August pre-release in IMAX format. On its opening day, the film earned $37.8 million, including the Thursday night earnings. \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" was the number one movie during its opening weekend and grossed $94.3 million, setting an August weekend record. During the opening weekend, IMAX earnings amounted to $11.7 million and 3-D showings accounted for 45% of ticket sales. The film's success was partially attributed to its appeal to both genders: the opening-weekend audience was 44% female, which is the biggest proportion ever for a MCU film; 55% of the opening-weekend audience was over the age of 25.\n\nAlthough the film fell to second place in its second and third weekends, behind \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\", the film was number one in its fourth, fifth, and sixth weekend. By doing so, it became the first film in 2014 to top the domestic box office in non-consecutive weeks, the first film of the summer (May–August) to be the number one film in three weekends and the first MCU film to be the top film for four weeks, surpassing \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\" and \"The Avengers\", both of which were number one for three weeks, and tied \"The Dark Knight\" for the most weeks at number one among comic book-based films. Phil Contrino, vice president and chief analyst of \"BoxOffice.com\" felt \"Guardians\" success was \"unconventional\" and was \"shattering expectations\". The film remained in the top 10 for ten weekends.\n\nThe film was the top-grossing film of summer 2014 (ahead of \"\"), first of 2014 to pass $300 million for its domestic gross, and was the third-highest-grossing domestic film of 2014 (behind \"American Sniper\" and \"\"). The film was said to have \"injected life\" into an otherwise lower-than-normal summer box office.\n\n\"Guardians of the Galaxy\" was released in 42 international markets and grossed $66.4 million on its opening weekend. The biggest debuts came from Russia ($13 million), the United Kingdom ($10.8 million), Mexico ($6.5 million), Brazil ($6.5 million), and South Korea ($4.7 million). The film topped the weekend box office two times, in its first and second weekends. In its eleventh weekend, the film opened in China, earning $29.8 million, its largest, and became the third-highest opening in the country for any Disney release, behind \"Iron Man 3\" and \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\", and was an all-time industry record opening in October. The following weekend saw an additional $21.3 million from China, making China the highest-grossing market with $69 million. The film's three biggest markets in total earnings were: China ($96.5 million), the UK ($47.4 million), and Russia ($37.5 million).\n\nThe review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 91% approval rating with an average rating of 7.7/10 based on 305 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"\"Guardians of the Galaxy\" is just as irreverent as fans of the frequently zany Marvel comic would expect—as well as funny, thrilling, full of heart, and packed with visual splendor.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 76 out of 100, based on 52 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". CinemaScore audiences gave \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" an \"A\" grade rating on an A+ to F scale, while earning an \"A+\" among under-18 and 25- to 34-year-old viewers.\n\nScott Foundas of \"Variety\" said \"James Gunn's presumptive franchise-starter is overlong, overstuffed and sometimes too eager to please, but the cheeky comic tone keeps things buoyant—as does Chris Pratt's winning performance\", and praised the film's look created by cinematographer Ben Davis, production designer Charles Wood, and special effects makeup designer David White. Justin Lowe of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" also praised the film's look, and felt \"A well-matched ensemble rises to the challenge of launching a heroic origin film with distinctive style, abundant thrills and no shortage of humor.\" \"The Daily Telegraph\"s Robbie Collin said, \"A brand new summer family blockbuster this may be, but it plays by old, half-forgotten rules; trimming out the clutter and cross-referencing for snappy, streamlined, Saturday-cartoon fun\". Kenneth Turan of the \"Los Angeles Times\" said, \"Blessed with a loose, anarchic B-picture soul that encourages you to enjoy yourself even when you're not quite sure what's going on, the scruffy \"Guardians\" is irreverent in a way that can bring the first \"Star Wars\" to mind, in part because it has some of the most unconventional heroes this side of the Mos Eisley cantina.\" Manohla Dargis of \"The New York Times\" said, \"While \"Guardians\" takes you down one after another crazy narrative turn, it also pulls you into—and, for the most part, keeps you in—a fully realized other world.\" Richard Roeper of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" said, \"\"Guardians of the Galaxy\" is a late summer treat—a mostly lighthearted and self-referential comic-book movie with loads of whiz-bang action, some laugh-out-loud moments and a couple of surprisingly beautiful and touching scenes as well,\" calling it \"a refreshing confection of entertainment.\" Jim Starlin, creator of Drax the Destroyer, Gamora, and Thanos, said it \"might be Marvel's best movie yet\".\n\nJake Coyle of the Associated Press was more critical of the film, calling it \"terribly overstuffed and many of the jokes get drowned out by the special effects ... The pervasive movie references detract from the stab at freshness, and \"Guardians\" depends all too much on the whimsy of '70s anthems for an original beat.\" He also felt that Close, Reilly and del Toro were underused in the film. Mick LaSalle of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" said, \"In place of wit, \"Guardians\" offers a sort of generalized willingness to be amusing, an atmosphere of high spirits that feels like lots of people pumping air into a tire that has a hole in it. Everyone is clearly working, but nothing is really happening–and yet the effort is so evident that there's an impulse to reward it.\" Kyle Smith of the \"New York Post\" also had a negative response to the film, comparing it to \"Howard the Duck\" and \"Green Lantern\", and criticizing the dialogue, villains, soundtrack, lack of suspense, and the characters of Quill, Rocket, and Drax. The film received mixed reviews in China, where viewers complained that the film's \"poor subtitle translation not only spoiled the fun of watching it, but also made it difficult to understand its humor.\"\n\n\"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\" was released on May 5, 2017, again written and directed by James Gunn. Pratt, Saldana, Bautista, Diesel, Cooper, Rooker, Gillan, and Sean Gunn all reprise their roles in the film, and are joined by Pom Klementieff as Mantis, Elizabeth Debicki as Ayesha, Chris Sullivan as Taserface, and Kurt Russell as Quill's father Ego.\n\nIn April 2017, Gunn announced he would return to write and direct \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\". However, in July 2018, Disney and Marvel severed ties with Gunn following the resurfacing of old controversial tweets surrounding topics such as rape and pedophilia.

It is the third installment in the \"Ice Age\" series and the sequel to \"\" (2006). It was directed by Carlos Saldanha and co-directed by Mike Thurmeier. Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, Denis Leary reprise their roles from the first two films and Queen Latifah, Seann William Scott, and Josh Peck reprise their roles from \"The Meltdown\", with Simon Pegg joining them in the role of a weasel named Buck. The story has Sid the Sloth being taken by a female \"Tyrannosaurus\" after stealing her eggs, leading the rest of the herd to rescue him in a tropical lost world inhabited by dinosaurs beneath the ice.\n\nThe film was released on July 1, 2009, becoming the first \"Ice Age\" film and the first 20th Century Fox film to be released in 3D. Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, it ranked at the time as the second-highest-grossing animated film of all time, and the highest-grossing \"Ice Age\" film earning $886.7 million worldwide. A sequel, titled \"\", was released in 2012, and another film, titled \"\", was released in 2016.\n\nEllie and Manny, the two woolly mammoths, are expecting their first child, and Manny struggles to make life perfect and safe for the family. At the same time, Diego the saber-toothed cat finds himself unable to catch a cocky gazelle he has been stalking and decides to leave The Herd, believing that he is losing his predatory nature as a tiger. Sid the ground sloth begins to wish for a family of his own and takes three apparently abandoned eggs that he finds in an icy underground cavern and calls them Egbert, Shelly, and Yoko. Manny tells him to put them back, but Sid ignores Manny and looks after the eggs, which hatch into baby \"Tyrannosaurus Rex\" the next morning.\n\nAlthough Sid tries his best to raise the three dinosaurs, their rambunctious behavior scares away all the younger animals and ruins a playground Manny built for his child. Not long after, a female \"Tyrannosaurus Rex\", whose eggs Sid stole, soon returns and carries both Sid and her young underground, with Diego in pursuit. Manny, Ellie, Crash and Eddie the opossums follow as well and discover that the icy cavern leads to a vast subterranean jungle populated by dinosaurs thought to be extinct. Here, an angry \"Ankylosaurus\" threatens The Herd despite Diego's efforts to fend it off; they are saved from a further crowd of angry reptiles by a deranged one-eyed weasel named Buck.\n\nBuck has been living in this jungle for quite some time and is fighting Rudy, a huge albino \"Baryonyx\", intending to avenge the eye he lost to it when he was young with a knife he carved from one of Rudy's teeth. He agrees to lead The Herd through the jungle's perils to Lava Falls, where the dinosaur has taken Sid and her babies. In the meantime, Sid and the mother dinosaur try to outdo each other in feeding the offspring; he loses this contest, but is reluctantly welcomed into the family regardless. The next day, however, Sid is separated from the family and attacked by Rudy. Sid is knocked onto a loose rock slab that is floating on a river of lava and about to plummet over the falls.\n\nAs The Herd moves toward Lava Falls, Ellie goes into labor and a \"Guanlong\" pack strikes, causing a rock slide that separates her from Manny and Diego. Manny doubles back to protect her and Diego fends off further attacks, while Buck takes Crash and Eddie ahead to rescue Sid. Just as he goes over the falls, the trio swoops in on a commandeered \"Harpactognathus\" only to be chased by a flock of \"Pterodactylus\" on the way and saves his life. Manny reaches Ellie just in time to hear the cry of a newborn baby girl. Ellie names her Peaches after the fruit. Sid is saddened at the fact that he never had a chance to say goodbye to \"his\" children as he returns to The Herd and learns of Peaches' birth.\n\nBefore they can leave the jungle, they are ambushed by Rudy, who begins to attack them at full force; working together Manny, Sid, Diego, and Buck manage to trap Rudy by ensnaring him in vines. However, he quickly breaks free and resumes his onslaught. The Herd is saved by the timely arrival of the mother dinosaur, who charges at Rudy and knocks him off a cliff. As she and her children wish Sid well, Buck, now without a purpose in life since Rudy is gone, decides to join The Herd and live on the surface. However, a distant roar tells him that Rudy is still alive; he changes his mind and sends The Herd home, blocking off the path to the underground jungle at the same time. Manny and Ellie welcome Peaches into their frozen world and admit that Sid did a good job looking after Momma's children. Diego decides to remain with The Herd, while Buck stays underground, happily battling it out with Rudy.\n\n\nBlue Sky decided to do \"more of a what-if adventure\" in the third \"Ice Age\" installment, titled \"Ice Age: A New Beginning\", \"like finding the giant ape in \"King Kong\" or a Shangri-la in the middle of snow,\" and added the dinosaurs to the story. Character designer Peter de Sève welcomed the new plot addition, since he could not think of any other giant mammal to put into the story. The \"lost world\" approach led to colorful dinosaurs, because \"the dinosaurs didn't have to be just brown, and you can take liberties because no one knows what color they were\", according to de Sève. Rudy's design was inspired by the \"Baryonyx\" because of his crocodile-like look, which de Sève considered even more menacing than the \"T. rex\".\n\nThe film was released in RealD Cinema where available. The release sparked some controversy when Fox announced that it would no longer pay to supply 3D glasses to theaters, which led to a number of exhibitors threatening to only show the film in standard 2D projection.\n\nThe film's original trailer debuted with the film \"Horton Hears a Who!\" on March 14, 2008, then online on April 7, 2008. There are three others that have been released, with the third and fourth (which shows Buck) being the most closely resembling each other. Queen Latifah recorded a cover of the song \"Walk the Dinosaur\".\n\nThe film earned $196,573,705 in North America and $690,113,112 in other territories, which gives it a worldwide gross of $886,686,817 against a budget of $90 million. Worldwide, it is the third-highest-grossing film of 2009, the highest-grossing animated film of 2009, the 53rd-highest-grossing film of all time, the highest-grossing \"Ice Age\" film, the 12th-highest-grossing animated film of all time. It is also the highest-grossing animated film of 2009 worldwide. It set a worldwide opening-weekend record for an animated feature ($218.4 million), previously held by \"The Simpsons Movie\" ($170.9 million). However, it was later surpassed by \"Incredibles 2\" ($235.1 million) in 2018. It marks the highest-grossing film of the \"Ice Age\" series, the second-highest-grossing film of 20th Century Fox for 2009 (after \"Avatar\") and stands as the studio's third-largest film of all time behind the latter and \"\".\n\nThe film made $13,791,157 on its opening day in 4,099 theaters. It reached $41,690,382 on its first weekend, putting it at number 2 behind \"\", marking the lowest-grossing first weekend for the franchise, although it had a Wednesday release and therefore burned off attendance until the weekend. The film became 20th Century Fox's third-largest 2009 release in North America behind \"Avatar\" and \"\". It is the third-highest-grossing animated feature of 2009. It heavily out-grossed its predecessor, \"\" which earned $195,330,621 three years before, to become the highest-grossing movie in the franchise, but it was way behind the two first \"Ice Age\" movies in estimated attendance.\n\nOn its opening weekend it earned $151.7 million, which is the biggest opening for an animated feature and the 13th-largest of all time. Outside North America, it is the fifteenth-highest-grossing film of all time and the second-highest-grossing animated movie of all time (out-grossing \"Finding Nemo\", later out-grossed by \"Frozen\").

The site's critical consensus reads \"\"Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs\" boasts some excellent animation—in particular, the dinosaurs are wonderfully realized—but its story is tired and monotonous.\" Another review aggregator, Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, gives the film an average score of 50 based on 25 reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A-\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nHowever, Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half stars out of four claiming that \"\"Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs\" is the best of the three films about our friends in the inter-species herd of plucky prehistoric heroes. And it involves some of the best use of 3-D I've seen in an animated feature.\" Lou Lumenik of the \"New York Post\" awarded the film 3 stars stating that the film is \"much more of an emphasis on action in this nicely crafted, fast-paced sequel.\" Keith Phipps of \"The A.V. Club\" graded the film a C+ claiming the sequel \"throws its commitment to the era away with movie number three, a ploy sure to anger \"Ice Age\" purists everywhere.\" Carrie Rickey of \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" enjoyed the \"film's animation art is Seuss-imaginative\", but panned \"the flatness of the story and indifferent voicework all the more obvious.\"\n\nThe film was nominated in two categories at the 8th Visual Effects Society Awards, for \"Outstanding Animation in an Animated Feature Motion Picture\" and \"Outstanding Animated Character in an Animated Feature Motion Picture.\"\n\n\"Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs\" was released on high-definition Blu-ray Disc and standard DVD in North America on October 27, 2009, and in the United Kingdom on November 23, 2009.

The institute is attached to the Interdiscliplinary College of Research at the University of Paris-Sud. IDEST is made up of a number of lecturers, professors, PhD students, and researchers under the control of a scientific counsel composed of renowned professors and key figures in the sectors involved.\n\nIDEST addresses all legal aspects linked to the use of outer space and space applications. The Institute also focuses on industrial cooperation, project finance, and the analysis of national space politics on the civil, commercial and military levels. IDEST also exercises its competences in the law of electronic communications domain, notably in terms of market regulation, the use of limited resources, the normalization of equipment and applications. Furthermore, the Institute also addresses issues related to the aforementioned key sectors: information law, media law, defense and security.\n\nThe institute regroups researchers from more than ten countries, and has the capacity to produce research in several languages, including: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, Iranian, Japanese, Russian, and Spanish. The Institute has overseas representatives who travel in relation with the Parisian unit. Since its creation, IDEST has concluded numerous research contracts with the main spatial and telecommunication institutions. Its members publish in referenced journals and participate in all the major scientific events worldwide. The institute supervises Ph D, much of which is undertaken in co-direction with foreign establishments.\n\nIDEST is involved in the management of the master's degree in Space Activities and Telecommunications Law at the University of Paris-Sud. Its members partake as speakers at numerous other universities and grandes écoles in France and overseas, notably at the Institut Supérieur de l'Aéronautique et de l'Espace (ISAE), Supélec, ENSTA ParisTech, the International Space University, the University of Strasbourg, the Paris Institute of Political Studies. IDEST has also trained professors in the space and telecommunication law lecturing both in France and overseas.\n\nIn 2011, a convention was signed between the Institut Supérieur de l'Aéronautique et de l'Espace and the University of Paris-Sud for the development and cooperation between the two establishments in space law.\n\nWith its international network of researchers and former students, IDEST regularly organizes European days within the European Union. These European days reunite universities and local French practitioners in the same town over two years in order to reinforce academic and professional cooperation by a combination of national legal experiences and the cultural approaches in law.\n\nIDEST's first European days took place at Sibiu in Romania concerning Europe in the information society (2007) and the Regulation of the telecommunication market (2009). The second IDEST European days took place at Budapest, Hungary on Competition and the regulation of the telecommunication market (2010) and Competition in the network industries (2011).\n\nWorld Telecommunication and Information Society Day was created by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) with the goal of increasing public awareness about the use of information technology in the economic and social domains, as ways to reduce the digital divide.\n\n17 May marks the anniversary of the signing of the first International Telegraph Convention and the creation of the International Telecommunication Union, the reason for this date being chosen as World Telecommunication and Information Society Day. In this framework, IDEST organizes every year legal conferences reuniting the most renowned specialists in telecommunication law with lawyers and other legal practitioners to confront often highly complex questions in relation to the development of electronic communications networks and services.\n\nIn 2010, the conference’s chosen theme was \"The New Regulatory Framework of Telecommunications\" after the 2009 Review in regards to the European Regulation’s transposition into French law. The 2011 conference was on \"High Speed Broadband for All\".\n\nSince its creation, IDEST has obtained several national research contracts, notably from the National Center for Space Studies (CNES) in the framework of the elaboration of a Bill on space operations, in which IDEST was strongly involved. IDEST equally signed a major contract with the Ile de France region to develop the mobility of students and researchers in the telecommunications law between the University of Paris-Sud and universities in the town of Budapest. In 2011, following the signing of two contracts, one for the French National Frequencies Agency (ANFR), the other for the National Center for Space Studies, IDEST is currently working on a fact-finding mission based on the law of frequencies. IDEST is also currently working on an assessment of spatial governance in Europe for the French strategic analysis center, linked to the French Prime Minister.\n\nFollowing two research contracts with the European Space Agency (ESA) in the domain of planetary protection and space-based solar power stations, IDEST won two major projects for the European Union: The European Twinning Project UA/06/PCA/OT/05 Boosting Ukrainian Space Cooperation with the European Union, resulting in a series of meetings organized in Kiev between June 2008 and February 2010; and the Collaborative Project Consent (the 7th Framework Programme) relating to the protection of personal data in social networks. IDEST has also worked in close collaboration with the Romanian authorities in the transposition of the European law of telecommunications into Romanian national law.\n\nAmongst its international research contracts, IDEST has carried out research for Lockheed Martin (USA) on the protection of spatial assets, and for the State of Singapore on space tourism.\n\nIDEST has developed strategic partnerships with several universities in France and overseas: Institut Supérieur de l'Aéronautique et de l'Espace (Toulouse, France), Space Policy Institute (Washington, USA), the International Centre of Space Law (Kiev, Ukraine), Pázmány Péter Catholic University (Budapest, Hungary), University of Jaén (Jaén, Spain), Harbin Institute of Technology (Harbin, China) and University La Sapienza (Rome, Italy).\n\nSince its creation, IDEST has formed solid relations in the space and telecommunication professional milieus. The Institute was created under the impetus of the National Center for Space Studies and the European Space Agency, and its activities are supported by many prestigious operators, including Eutelsat, EADS, Marsh and Thales. In the domain of telecommunications, the French Regulator of the Electronic Communications and Postal Sectors (ARCEP) and the French Regulatory Authority for Frequencies (ANFr) also participated in defining the research activities of the Institute which today benefits from privileged links with the France Télécom Group. Finally, several law firms work in collaboration with IDEST, including Bird & Bird, Ernst & Young, Gide Loyrette Nouel, Iteanu & Associés, and YGMA.\n\nBeing the first qualification in the world to link the study of the space activities law with the telecommunications law, this degree was set up with the support of professional bodies to meet the needs of rapidly expanding industries looking for highly qualified graduates. The content of the Master was developed in partnership with the major companies and institutions in the space/aeronautical and telecommunication sectors.\n\nEvery year a steering committee agrees on the curriculum to be covered in order to respond to the evolving needs of the space and telecommunications markets. Core subjects are complemented by practical seminars and a long-term work placement (in France or overseas). Regular and lasting contact with the labor market is gained through an educational team consisting mainly of practitioners (70% of the teaching body), lectures run by future potential employers, lectures given on the premises of companies (50%) and prestigious institutions, visits and professional voyages both in France and overseas, and through an international network of alumni and the course’s partners.\n\nThe course encompasses Europe and the wider world through teaching which combines both national and transnational approaches to issues. Lessons are held in French and English by a multicultural team of lecturers (9 nationalities). Classes consist of 50% overseas students (since 2002, the Master has welcomed 264 students coming from 61 different nationalities) all of whom participate in a large number of international events.\n\nThe course has been designed for future career prospects in mind, by linking law to other disciplines – the sciences, economics, management, and political sciences. The interdisciplinary character of the Master’s teaching staff and students facilitates the graduates’ integration within businesses and public institutions through their complete and in-depth understanding of the issues to be tackled and their real ability to communicate with all departments and parties concerned, and notably with the technical departments.\n\nEvery class has a sponsor who assists the students all year round. The class is named after the sponsor.\n\nThe French Agency for Academic Evaluation (AERES) has given the Master its best mark (A+), considering this program to be amongst the best in France in all disciplines.\n\n"}

{"id": "340930", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=340930", "title": "Joropo", "text": "Joropo\n\nThe Joropo or Música llanera is a musical style resembling the fandango, and an accompanying dance. It has African, Native South American and European influences and originated in the orinoco plains called \"Los Llanos\" of what is now Colombia and Venezuela. It is a fundamental genre of \"música criolla\" (creole music). It is also the most popular \"folk rhythm\": the well-known song \"Alma Llanera\" is a joropo, considered the unofficial national anthem of Venezuela.\n\nIn 1882 it became Venezuela's national dance. Formerly, the Spanish word joropo meant \"a party\", but now it has come to mean a type of music and dance that identifies Venezuelans. In the 18th century the llaneros started using the word “joropo” instead of the word \"fandango\", which was the word used at the time for party and dance.\n\nPropio of the central states of Venezuelay, like Aragua and Miranda, Carabobo eastern and northern Guarico. The central joropo or tuyero (by practiced on the banks of the Tuy River) is sung accompanied by harp (sometimes replaced by guitar) and maracas. Unlike strings náilon the llanera harp, harp central joropo also uses metal strings, which gived her uniquena sound. The singer central joropo is the same as playing the maracas, dancing so they put just two performers: the harpist (or rather \"arpisto\", as they like to call themselves), and the maw (singer-maraquero). The central joropo him the same considerations are applied around the passage and hit burrowing joropo, except speed, which is slightly lower. Another important caveat is that the central joropo revolt, kind of colonial origin is present, basically consists of a chain of musical sections of fixed forms, in the same tone, as a Baroque suite, without interruption, but with twists surprising. The movements of revolt are called passage; input or call Yaguazo, Yaguazo, and Marisela Guabina input. Sometimes they can call Marisela added to them, and even a small coda. The revolt is thus equivalent to the batch or shift dance, and its extension is probably the reason for his gradual disuse, being replaced by the execution of the parts in isolation. The arrangement of these sections is of sequential nature, unlike blows Llanero Joropo, having a cyclic condition. The most characteristic part of tuyero joropo, the Tuyera Revuelta consists of four sections: the exhibition (passage), development (yaguazo and guabina), the instrumental coda named Marisela, and an end known as \"monkey call.\" They are central joropo own beats flowers and quitapesares.Los most famous passages tuyeros are The Hermit Mario Diaz, Dawn tuyero of Cipriano Moreno and Pablo Hidalgo, and The Cat enmochilado Fulgencio Aquino. Caraquenos and central musicians adopted the central joropo as inspiration for his works, as in the case of Marisela Sebastián Díaz Peña, the Alma Llanera, Pedro Elias Gutierrez, valse Quitapesares Carlos Bonet and even Creole Sonatina Juan Bautista Square. The central joropo lyrics are sly, sardonic nature, in contrast to the forceful and violent own burrowing joropo, whose contrapunteos end up not infrequently in sets and fights.\n\nCharacteristic of the northeastern region of Venezuela, specifically of Sucre, Nueva Esparta and Anzoategui and Monagas Northern states. In this particular type of joropo melodic instrument par excellence is the mandolin. However, the eastern mandolin (eight nylon strings), violin, harmonica and a small accordion called \"cuereta\" also have a major role in the oriental musical folklore. The so-called \"joropo with refrain\" consists of two sections: the first section or \"hit\" is traditionally a fixed melody in rhythm that is repeated two or more times; the second section or \"chorus\" is an improvised melody over a fixed harmonic rhythm cycle is . Note that in the eastern joropo, cuatro and maracas are executed in a much freer and more complex than in the rest of Venezuelans joropos way. Likewise, it is important to mention that the musical tradition of the eastern region of Venezuela has many other forms besides the eastern joropo.\n\nProduct of the interaction of llaneros and eastern Bolivar state in Venezuela , specifically in Ciudad Bolivar. It is executed with the Guayanese mandolin (eight metal strings) , cuatro and maracas. Six Guayanés , the Josa and Rompeluto highlight among the most famous Guyanese joropos.\n\nCharacteristic from Aragua and Miranda , and Carabobo eastern and northern Guárico (Venezuela) . While burrowing joropo is intoned with llanera harp or mandolin, cuatro and maracas , the tuyero is sung with harp, maracas and crop. At the same time , while the harp tuyera uses metal and nylon strings, the harp burrowing joropo all strings are nylon . Another distinguishing point between the tuyero and burrowing joropo is the fact that in the first, singing is the same as running the maracas. The most characteristic of tuyero folklore piece, \"The tuyera revolt\", it consists of four sections : the exhibition (passage) , development (yaguaso and guabina) , the instrumental coda (called \"Marisela\") and an end known as \"the call monkey\". The most famous passages are tuyeros \"El ermitaño\" of Mario Diaz, \"Amanecer tuyero\" of Cipriano Moreno and Pablo Hidalgo and \"El gato enmochilado\" of Fulgencio Aquino.\n\nHailing from the West Central region of Venezuela , mainly states Lara, Portuguesa (Portuguese saw) and Yaracuy . Played by a variety of stringed instruments (Four , Middle Five , Five and Six) together with Tambora and Maracas produce a very particular and unique sound among other Venezuelans joropos . Celebrity tocuyanos hits are \"Amalia Rosa\" , \"Montilla\" , \"Gavilan Tocuyano\" and \"Ah mundo! Barquisimeto\" , \"Los Dos Gavilanes\" , \"The Fright\" , \"Pajarillo Tocuyano\" , \"Garrote Encabullao\" , \"Fire Fire\", among many others. Dancing in the number of members is six couples.\n\nLegend says that this type of joropo is named after Jose Antonio Oquendo , who was nicknamed \"Quirpa\" . Burrowing harpist of the late nineteenth century who died of a stab wound . The quirpa uses ternary and tertiary bars and sometimes combined, with shifts of rhythm and musical accents .\n\nUntil the mid-twentieth century, and with regard to the region of the plains of Venezuela, the joropo word referring to a social event almost a fair- for a period that could vary from a few hours and even a full week. There participating local people or coming from various places, generally attracted by trade, where the central event it was the music, dance and contrapunteos. Burrowing joropo music was provided by a basic set consisting of harp, cuatro, maracas and singing. If there was no harp, it was replaced by a mandolin or violin The genera of burrowing joropo are two: Passage: the more sedate, and generally known author. Its speed is approximately 152 bpm, and harmonic structure free, usually in two parts; Y Hit:. Anonymous author, although many of these strokes are attributed to composers of the early twentieth century The coup complies with certain recognizable melodic turns on fixed characteristic harmonic patterns that define its type. Singing is syllabic, that is, to each note of the melody corresponds to a syllable. The verses are octosyllabic and sometimes five syllables, all under contrafactum, ie the replacement of new texts in existing melodies. The stroke speed is greater than the passage (176–192 bpm). When the song is a story of an event or fantasy called the RAN, equivalent to the old Spanish romance. The blows are the basis for the buzzes or hums contrapunteo that between two or more opponents. The most common are the six law (major key), the bird (in a minor key), six numbering or six numerao (with transport augmentations in fourth grade), the Kirpa or quirpa, Gavan (in modes major and minor), the San Rafael, carnival, Chipola, the catira, the buzz buzzing, among the best known. The entreverao is the aggregation of two strokes, with a modulation of each other, usually to sing two people with different tessitura voice (baritone and tenor). As for the steps of the most frequent dance are valsiao, escobillao and footwork, in which, unlike the central joropo, feet off the floor rise. Family tree of performers llanera harp in Venezuela since the late nineteenth century to the present\n\nThe Joropo is played with the \"arpa llanera\" (harp), \"bandola\", \"cuatro\", and \"maracas\" (ibid), making use of polyrhythmic patterns, especially of hemiola, and alternation of and meters. It was originally played, most often also sung, by the \"llaneros\", the Venezuelan \"Llanos\", (plains), and thus also called música llanera (ibid).\n\nThe singer and the harp or bandola may perform the main melody while a cuatro performs the accompaniment, adding its characteristic rhythmic, sharp percussive effect. The cuatro and the bandola are four-stringed instruments which are descendants of the Spanish guitar. The only real percussion instruments used are the maracas. Besides the genre and dance, the name \"joropo\" also means the performance, the event or occasion of performance.\n\nThe Joropo is the most famous dance in Venezuela and is also the national dance. It is adopted and still uses the hand turn, the movement of the feet, and waltz turns. First, the partners dance a type of waltz holding each other tightly. Then they stand facing each other and make small steps forward and backward as if sweeping the floor. Lastly they hold each other's arms, and the woman does sweeping steps while the man stomps his feet along with the music’s rhythm.\n\nIn modern times, several other instruments have been added to playing various parts in Joropo performances, for instance, guitar, flute, clarinet, piano, and up to a complete symphony orchestra playing Joropo arrangements.\n\n\n\n"}

Its running time was 172 minutes and it featured six episodes of the programme, together with specially shot sequences featuring Annie Walker, Elsie Tanner and Len Fairclough. Later, \"The Magic of Coronation Street\" was released as two separate packages, each containing three episodes, by Vestron Video.\n\nEpisodes featured:\n\n\"Part one:\" Episode 1 (9 December 1960); Gas Main Leak (9 February 1961); Christmas Day 1961\n\n\"Part two:\" Elsie discovers that Bill Gregory is married (11 July 1962); \"This is Your Life\" (12 December 1962); Cinderella (23 December 1964)\n\nIn 1985, to celebrate the serial's 25th anniversary, two video tapes were released (again on Vestron Video), entitled \"The Jubilee Years – Part One\" and \"The Jubilee Years – Part Two\". These featured a previously unseen character Alice Hughes revisiting the Street to recall characters like Ena and Elsie and catch up on 'current happenings' with Ken and Deirdre Barlow, Betty Turpin and Hilda Ogden.\n\nIn 1987, \"The Life and Loves of Elsie Tanner\" was released, with the characters of Mike Baldwin, Emily Bishop and Elsie's daughter, Linda, recalling Elsie's time on the Street. In this production it is hinted that Elsie has died, an event not referred to in the series proper until 2011, when her son Dennis Tanner said she and her husband Bill Gregory died in 2004 after a car crash in Portugal (Emily tells Linda that she was \"sorry to hear about her mother\"). Pat Phoenix, who played Elsie, had died the previous year. So many may infer that this one off special is not at all a part of the series canon.\n\nIn 1990, as a celebration for the serial's 30th anniversary, 10 video tapes were released by Windsong Video Productions, each featuring four episodes from a specific year and introduced by someone who was close to the stories that year (for example, Betty Turpin's husband Cyril died in 1974, therefore Betty Driver hosted the 1974 tape). These tapes were initially distributed by Granada Video for viewing in the UK only, but were reissued on NTSC tape (a year later) for viewing in the US and Canada.\n\nIn 1995, \"Coronation Street – The Cruise\" was released on VHS to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the show. \"The Cruise\" was the first straight-to-video tape, released in 1995 and featured a storyline aboard the QE2. The spin-off proved controversial as although the cover claimed that the special was exclusive-to-video, only a few months after it was released it was shown on ITV on 24 March 1996. This provoked many complaints which resulted in Granada (who had not sanctioned the airing of the special but were over-ruled by ITV) being ordered by the Independent Television Commission to make a public apology as well as sending a letter of apology along with a free paperback book as a gesture of goodwill to each complainant. Subsequent releases have included carefully worded statements concerning future television broadcasting.\n\nA United States-set special, \"\" follows Jack and Vera and other characters to America. It was released on VHS in 1999 and screened on ITV the following year. Written by Russell T Davies, the special featured a guest cameo by actor Neville Buswell, who was then living in America, who briefly reprised his role as Ray Langton.\n\nMany VHS tapes were made in the 1990s for the British market, from mail-order company Time-Life Distribution, with each tape consisting of a compilation of footage featuring a particular character (for example, Gail, Rita, the Duckworths). They were made only in PAL format and not distributed in the United States or Canada.\n\nThere were 20 videos in total and they each came with a printed signed postcard with the characters featured.\n1.

In 2004, a \"Coronation Street: Secrets\" DVD box set of televised specials was released in Canada, but not in the United States, despite both being in region 1.\n\nOn 10 November 2008, a DVD titled \"Coronation Street: Out of Africa\" was released. The spin-off follows the Battersby-Brown family to Sun City, South Africa and features the return of Cilla Battersby-Brown. The DVD featured its own soundtrack including an ending theme; \"Playboy Money\" sung by Andy Chandler.\n\n\"Coronation Street: Romanian Holiday\" was released on 26 October 2009.

The cast also includes Beverly Archer, Matt Mulhern, Jon Cypher, Marisa Ryan, Nicole Dubuc, and Chelsea Hertford.\n\nThe first season is set at the fictional Camp Singleton (meant to represent Camp Pendleton), where hard-charging United States Marine Corps Major John D. \"Mac\" MacGillis is commander of the infantry training school's acquisition division. MacGillis's life is changed when he falls in love with a liberal journalist, Polly Cooper. The show follows Mac in his work life, where he deals with Lt. Eugene Holowachuk (Matt Mulhern), Sgt. Byron James (Marlon Archey), and Merilee Gunderson (Whitney Kershaw), as well as his home life, as he learns to live with Polly's three daughters, Elizabeth, Robin, and Casey.\n\nAt the beginning of the second season, the MacGillis family moves to Camp Hollister (based on Marine Corps Base Quantico), where Mac must adapt to the role of staff secretary (or, \"staff weenie\") and the crazy antics of Commanding General Marcus C. Craig, Aide-de-Camp 1st Lt. Eugene Holowachuk (who transferred with Major MacGillis from Camp Singleton), and Gunnery Sgt. Alva \"Gunny\" Bricker, the General's secretary, a no-nonsense woman, who despite her brusque nature and unprepossessing physical appearance, is the target of many enthusiastic (and unseen) suitors.\n\nCharacter development increased during the second season, such as the revelation that MacGillis is a former member of the United States Marine Corps Silent Drill Platoon.\n\n"}
{"id": "1299072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1299072", "title": "Meta-reference", "text": "Meta-reference\n\nMeta-reference is a special type of self-reference that can occur in all media or medial artefacts, for instance literature, film, painting, TV series, comic strips, or video games. It includes all references to, or comments on, a specific medium, medial artefact, or the media in general. These references and comments originate from a logically higher level (a 'meta-level') within any given artefact, and draw attention to -- or invite reflection about -- media-related issues (e.g. the production, performance, or reception) of said artefact, specific other artefacts (as in parody), or to parts, or the entirety, of the medial system. It is, therefore, the recipient's awareness of an artefact's medial quality that distinguishes meta-reference from more general forms of self-reference. Thus, meta-reference triggers media-awareness within the recipient, who, in turn \"becomes conscious of both the medial (or 'fictional' in the sense of artificial and, sometimes in addition, 'invented') status of the work\" as well as \"the fact that media-related phenomena are at issue, rather than (hetero-)references to the world outside the media.\" Although certain devices, such as mise en abyme, may be conducive to meta-reference, they are not necessarily metareferential themselves. Similarly, innately metareferential devices, such as metalepsis, are to be seen as special cases of meta-reference. The terms meta-reference and metalepsis can, therefore, not be used synonymously.\n\nWhile meta-reference as a concept is not a new phenomenon and can be observed in very early works of art and media not tied to specific purposes (e.g. Homer's invocation of the muses at the beginning of the \"Odyssey\" in order to deliver the epic better), the term itself is relatively new. Earlier discussions of metareferential issues often opt for more specific terminology tied to the respective discipline. Notable discussions of meta-reference include, but are not limited to, William H. Gass's and Robert Scholes's exploration of metafiction, Victor Stoichita's examination of early modern meta-painting, and Lionel Abel's investigation of metatheatre. In the context of drama, meta-reference has also become colloquially known as the breaking of the fourth wall. The first study to underscore the problem resulting from the lack of cohesive terminology, as well as the necessity to acknowledge metareference as transmedial and trans-generic phenomenon, was published in 2007 by Hauthal et al. Publications by Nöth and Bishara as well as Wolf followed suit, raised similar concerns, included case studies from various media, coined and helped establish the more uniform umbrella term meta-reference as define above.\n\nWhile every medium has the potential for meta-reference, some media can transport meta-reference more easily than others. Media that can easily realise its meta-referential potential includes, for instance, literature, painting, and film. Although music can be meta-referential even outside the confines of lyrics, meta-reference in music is much harder to create or detect. Music, therefore, would be a less typical medium for the occurrence of meta-reference. Nöth argues in this context that although non-verbal media can be the home of meta-reference, the contained meta-reference can only be implicit because non-verbal media can only show similarites, but never point directly (or explicitly) to meta-referential elements. Others, however, argue that meta-reference is explicit as long as it is clear.\n\nJohn Fowles begins chapter 13 of his novel \"The French Lieutenant's Woman\" with the wordsThis \"story\" I am \"telling\" is all \"imagination\". These \"characters\" I create never existed outside my own mind. If I have pretended until now to know my \"characters\"' mind and innermost thoughts, it is because I am \"writing\" in [...] a \"convention\" universally accepted at the time of my \"story\": that the \"novelist\" stands next to God. [emphases added]This is an example of explicit meta-reference because the text draws attention to the fact that the novel the recipient is reading is merely a fiction created by the author. It also foregrounds the convention that readers of realist fiction accept the presence of an all-knowing narrator, and breaks it by allowing the narrator to take centre stage which invites meta-reflections by the recipient.\n\n\"The Truman Show\" is a movie that contains a high degree of meta-reference. Truman, the protagonist, is unaware that he is part of a reality TV show, but the audience knows about the artificiality of both Truman's life and, by extension, the movie that is being watched. This is underscored by putting emphasis on the production process of the fictional reality TV show, which makes the audience aware of the same features being used in the movie at the time of watching. Further examples of meta-reference in the movie include spotlights falling from the sky seemingly out of the blue, or a raincloud which is curiously only raining on Truman following him around on Seahaven Beach. Both instances point to the artificiality of Truman's life as well as the film itself.\n\nAn example of meta-reference in painting is \"Manet's Balcony\" by René Magritte. It comments on another painting, \"The Balcony\" by Édouard Manet, by mimicking both the setting of the balcony as well as the poses of the depicted people, but places them in coffins. Thus, the recipient's attention is drawn to the fact that not only are the people in the painting long dead and only still 'alive' in the representation, but arguably also that the artist (Manet) and the impressionist painting style are just as dead as the portrayed individuals. Furthermore, it is foregrounded that the impressionist painting style is just a style that may be copied, which further emphasises the fact that both works are only paintings created in a specific way. \n\n\n\n"}

Tricks are performed by swinging, wrapping and throwing the meteor about the body.\n\nThe meteor is based on the Chinese meteor hammer, a bolo-like weapon made from stones and rope. Approximately 1500 years ago, this hunting weapon began its transition into a performing art. The Chinese circus tradition has featured meteors with brightly colored balls, glass bowls filled with colored water, or pans of flaming oil in place of the stone weights.\n\nIn Shaolin schools, the water meteor made a useful training aid once a student had gained a certain level of skill. These water meteors consisted of a length of chain with two inward facing bowls for heads. These bowls were then filled with water (or occasionally, sand), in order to train a smooth technique and gain control over the weapon. When the meteor was spinning fast enough, the water would be held in the bowls, with the intention being not to spill any. In China where this technique was originally developed, once a student had practiced for several years and gained mastery of the meteor, then they could progress to fire meteors. Cirque du Soleil's Varekai features water meteors as an act.\n\nThe traditional fire meteors were essentially the same as the water meteors, except that instead of containing water, the bowls were instead filled with fuel. This fuel was then lit, and the meteor spun exactly as before, looking like a pair of real harnessed meteors. It is also a dangerous weapon to behold, because one slight mistake could send flaming fuel around in a radius in excess of 20 feet.\n\nModern fire meteors are commonly made similar to the monkey fist meteors, which is made of kevlar, cotton or other natural fiber rope, then connected by chains or rope; also made of kevlar, cotton or natural fiber. The natural fiber or kevlar rope is necessary as synthetic ropes will melt rapidly, and the natural fiber ropes will also need to be replaced often as well. The kevlar rope works much better as it is designed to take stress and resist high temperatures.\n\nFreestyle Meteor refers to the use of the meteor weapon (used in martial arts) in a more visually stunning manner, rather than a combative way. This makes freestyle meteor one of the flow arts.\n\n\n"}

The track was sent to mainstream radio on October 23, 2012 as the second single taken from the band's fourth studio album, \"Battle Born\". It topped the \"Rolling Stone\" Readers' Poll for The Best Song of 2012. It has been remixed by The Chainsmokers.\n\nThe band released two music videos for \"Miss Atomic Bomb\", with a tour video directed by Giorgio Testi released on November 2, which captures footage of the band performing in the UK while on their Battle Born World Tour. The second, and official video was released over one month later, on December 11. The video was directed by Warren Fu, who had directed \"Battle Born\"'s first single, \"Runaways\". \n\nPart live action and part animation, \"Miss Atomic Bomb\" has been dubbed \"the epic companion to Mr. Brightside\", and the video continues the love triangle depicted in the 2004 hit \"Mr. Brightside\" music video. \"Miss Atomic Bomb\" sees actress Izabella Miko and actor Eric Roberts reprise their roles from the \"Mr. Brightside\" video. As \"Miss Atomic Bomb\" is considered to be a companion to \"Mr. Brightside\", the premise of the music video is similar but broader.\n\nThe music video begins with an elderly man sitting alone in his trailer home, reflecting on his past when he notices a letter on his doormat. The memories take form in animation, featuring the man in his youth, depicted as an animated Brandon Flowers, in the company of his band (animated versions of Keuning, Stoermer, and Vannucci). He is watching a young girl's (Izabella Miko) dance recital from his garage when she notices him observing her, before they are interrupted by her teacher who draws the curtains. However, he later seeks her out at her home, and it is presumed that they fall in love with each other.\n\nOne night, the young woman has finished a performance but grows tired of her teacher and runs off from the stage to seek out Flowers. He is happy to see her when she finds him; and, he takes her through a motorbike ride through the desert. However, the paranoid jealousy that Flowers bears begins to surface as he catches sight of a faceless stranger in the desert, which is likely to be a figment of his imagination. Later, when the woman is shown to have won the Miss Atomic Bomb pageant alongside her dance partner (Eric Roberts), a surly Flowers who is performing at the pageant with his band, becomes more resentful and believes that the man is in love with his girlfriend. Akin to the events in \"Mr Brightside\", the imaginary stranger in the desert forms its identity as the dance partner and Flowers makes his way towards the young woman's house in a troubled state. He arrives there on New Year's Eve in Las Vegas to propose to her, but he catches sight of the car that her dance partner owns and becomes certain that she is having an affair with him. He leaves the engagement ring on the ground and walks away. As he walks through Las Vegas, he has hallucinations of women who are kissing other men as his girlfriend kissing her dance partner. Flowers then ages visibly and heads for his trailer home in the desert as he is plagued by visions of what would have been his future with the young woman.\n\nThe video then transitions to real-life acting, showing the elderly man in the present opening a letter from his then-girlfriend. Glimpses of the writing reveal that she was uncertain about what had happened the night that he had walked away from her on New Year's Eve. The memories then repeat in live acting, with the young woman tearfully holding up the engagement ring that he had left behind and recalling the night that she had found him in the desert. The young woman is shown to be dancing with her partner in her apartment, although Flowers imagines him kissing her behind the curtains. It is revealed that all the events which occurred from Flowers' point of view were fictional and that it was indeed his paranoid jealousy which overcame him. As the New Year's countdown ends, the young woman rushes out onto her balcony in excitement, only to see Flowers on the floor and the man walking away bitterly, leaving her in confusion. The last shots of the music video show the letter disintegrating and the elderly man looking at a faded photo of the young woman on his shelf.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3126857", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3126857", "title": "Nazi exploitation", "text": "Nazi exploitation\n\nNazi exploitation (also Nazisploitation) is a subgenre of exploitation film and sexploitation film that involves Nazis committing sex crimes, often as camp or prison overseers during World War II. Most follow the women in prison formula, only relocated to a concentration camp, extermination camp, or Nazi brothel, and with an added emphasis on sadism, gore, and degradation. The most infamous and influential title (which set the standards of the genre) is a Canadian production, \"Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS\" (1974). Its surprise success and sequels led European filmmakers, mostly in Italy, to produce dozens of similar films. While the \"Ilsa\" series were profitable, the other films were mostly box-office flops, and the genre all but vanished by the mid-1980s.\n\nIn Italy, these films are known as part of the \"il sadiconazista\" cycle, which were inspired by such art-house films as Liliana Cavani's \"The Night Porter\" (1974), Pier Paolo Pasolini's \"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom\" (1975), and Tinto Brass's \"Salon Kitty\" (1976). Prominent directors of the genre include Paolo Solvay (\"La Bestia in Calore\", also known as \"The Beast in Heat\" and \"SS Hell Camp\"), Cesare Canevari (\"Last Orgy of the Third Reich\", also known as \"L'ultima orgia del III Reich\", \"Gestapo's Last Orgy\" and \"Caligula Reincarnated as Hitler\"), and Alain Payet (\"Train spécial pour SS\", also known as \"Special Train for Hitler\" and \"Helltrain\"), all from 1977.\n\nItalian directors pioneered a blend of sexual imagery and Nazi themes. This can be found as early as 1945 in \"Rome, Open City\" by Roberto Rossellini. Another Rossellini film, \"Germany, Year Zero\" (1948), connects Nazism with homosexuality and pedophilia. The controversial art-house production \"The Damned\" (1969), directed by Luchino Visconti, about the rise and fall of a German industrialist family in the Third Reich, is also a major influence on the genre. The film features an orgy of homosexual SA-Men and depicts one of the main characters as a troubled multiple pervert posing in a transvestite outfit, molesting little girls, and committing incest with his own mother. \n\nOther early examples that combine sexual themes and Nazism include the West German productions \"Des Teufels General\" (\"The Devil's General\") (1955) by Helmut Käutner and \"Lebensborn\" (\"Ordered to Love\") (1961). The French art-house film \"Vice and Virtue\" (1963), directed by Roger Vadim, is a stylized retelling of the Marquis de Sade's \"Justine\" set during the Nazi occupation of France. This is a subtle and satirical rendering that only hints at the sexual depravity explicit in the original novel.\n\nThe critically acclaimed 1964 film \"The Pawnbroker\" includes a flashback\nscene showing nude women kept in a concentration camp brothel. The Italian Giallo thriller \"In the Folds of the Flesh\" (also known as \"Nelle pieghe della carne\", 1970) has a similar flashback sequence with unrealistically attractive nude women being herded into a Nazi gas chamber. However, the earliest full-blown sexploitation film set in a Nazi camp was \"Love Camp 7\" (1969). The film can also be viewed as a precursor to the similarly themed women in prison genre which was initially popularized by Roger Corman's \"The Big Doll House\" (1971).\n\n\"Love Camp 7\" established the pattern for the many films that followed. The story resembles a \"true adventure\" pulp yarn from a men's adventure magazine of the period (\"Man's Story, Men Today, World of Men\", \"Man's Epic\", et al.). In order to rescue a Jewish scientist, two female agents infiltrate a Nazi Joy Division camp, where prisoners are kept as sex slaves for German officers. There are scenes of boot-licking humiliation, whipping, torture, lesbianism, and near-rape, culminating in a violent and bloody escape. The stock characters include a cruel and perverse commandant, a lesbian doctor, sadistic guards who freely abuse the prisoners, and a sympathetic German who tries to help the captive women. \n\nThe theme of Nazi sexual abuse continued in the sleazy, violent drive-in programmer \"The Cut-Throats\" (1969) and \"Torture Me, Kiss Me\" (1970), a low-budget, black-and-white B-movie about sadistic Nazi officers tormenting female civilians (including fetishistic flogging scenes) in occupied France. \n\nProducer David F. Friedman had a small acting role in \"Love Camp 7\". He went on to produce \"Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS\" in 1974. \"Ilsa\" was unique in that the camp commandant was a sexy, sex-crazed woman played by the busty and frequently nude Dyanne Thorne. Between sex scenes, Ilsa subjects her male and female inmates to horrific scientific tests, much like Josef Mengele's notorious Nazi human experimentation at Auschwitz. Some of the tests on hypothermia and pressure-chamber endurance were factual. Others were pure fantasy. For example, to prove her theory that women can endure more pain than men, Ilsa has a male and female prisoner flogged to death.\n\nThe character is also loosely based on \"The Witch of Buchenwald\", Ilse Koch, the wife of the commandant of the Buchenwald concentration camp. Koch was known for having perverse sexual dalliances with the prisoners and was rumored to have had lampshades made from human skin.\n\n\"Ilsa\" includes the standard elements of sadism, degradation, whipping, sexual slavery, graphic torture, and a bloody finale with Ilsa shot dead and the camp set ablaze. The film was a surprise hit on the drive-in theater and grindhouse circuit. Ilsa was resurrected for three profitable sequels that ignored her Nazi origins and are closer to the women-in-prison genre. As a freelance mistress-for-hire, she became \"Ilsa, Harem Keeper of the Oil Sheiks\" (1976), commander of a 1953 gulag in \"Ilsa, the Tigress of Siberia\" (1977), and the warden of a corrupt Latin-American prison in \"Ilsa, the Wicked Warden\" (1977).\n\nMeanwhile, European filmmakers were creating their own lurid Nazi movies with Ilsa-type villains. In 1977, Malisa Longo starred in \"Helga, She Wolf of Stilberg\" as a black-booted, leather-clad, sexually sadistic commander of a prison camp for women. That year, Longo also starred in the \"Salon Kitty\"-inspired \"Fräulein Devil\" (also known as \"Elsa: Fraulein SS\") as Elsa, a former hooker with a penchant for S&M, who manages a Nazi brothel train. This was filmed back-to-back with \"Hitler's Last Train\" (also known as \"Special Train for the SS\", \"Helltrain\" and \"Love Train for the SS\", 1977). These films, plus \"Nathalie: Escape from Hell\" (1978), were produced by the French studio Eurociné.\n\nOne of the most notorious films in this genre is \"La Bestia in Calore\" (also known as \"SS Hell Camp\" and \"The Beast In Heat\"), produced in Italy in 1977. German actress Macha Magall played Dr. Ellen Kratsch, another icy blond Nazi who is sexy, yet thoroughly evil. This film, with its extensive and graphic scenes of torture, brutality and rape, was initially banned in England. A milder, edited version was released in the U.S. as \"SS Experiment Camp 2\". Magall was also in \"SS Girls\" (1977), another story set in a Nazi brothel.\n\nThe Nazi exploitation subgenre presented an opportunity for Italian studios to make very low-cost horror pictures whilst tapping a previously ignored market; the exploitation war film. The Italian films are different from \"Ilsa\" in many ways, for instance, they focus on far more extreme aspects of human abuse.\n\nThe films of 1976 include: Sergio Garrone's \"SS Experiment Camp\" (also known as \"SS Experiment Love Camp\"), depicting soft-core sex scenes and the castration of an SS officer. \"SS Hell Camp\", Luigi Batzella's second Nazi film, featured a sexually-crazed mutant created by an Ilsa-like Nazi scientist. \"SS Girls\", directed by Bruno Mattei, is a blatant copy of \"Salon Kitty\". Mattei also made \"Women's Camp 119\" starring Lorraine De Selle. This film depicts horrific scientific experiments performed on prisoners based on actual documents. \"SS Special Section Women\" stars John Steiner as a sex-crazed SS Commandant whose love for a Jewish girl costs him his manhood. \"Achtung! The Desert Tigers\", from Luigi Batzella, is interwoven with stock footage and scenes at a Nazi camp in the desert where tortures abound.\n\n1977 saw the release of \"Gestapo's Last Orgy\" (also known as \"Last Orgy of the Third Reich\" and \"Caligula Reincarnated as Hitler\"), which depicts a love affair between a camp Commandant and a prisoner. \"SS Camp 5: Women’s Hell\" is \"SS Experiment Camp\"'s sister film featuring the same cast and crew. \"Red Nights of the Gestapo\" is a soft-core sex film with SS soldiers abusing women in a castle. \"Nazi Love Camp 27\", starring Sirpa Lane as a Jewish girl forced into a brothel, is notable for its hardcore sex scenes and for being written by famed scripter Gianfanco Clerici.\n\nBy the end of the decade the genre had run its course.\n\nAdult films also exploited Nazi scenarios in a string of sadomasochistic \"roughie\" pornographic films in the 1970s and early 1980s. Examples include the Mitchell brothers' \"Hot Nazis\", \"Hitler's Harlot\" (1973), and 1980's \"Nazi Love Island\" (a.k.a. \"Prisoner of Paradise\") with John Holmes and Seka. One of the last entries, \"Stalag 69\" (1982), starred Angelique Pettyjohn as an Ilsa-type SS officer. The story was largely a remake of \"Love Camp 7\", bringing the cycle back to its origins. The genre remained mostly dormant for the next two decades. In 2006, Mood Pictures, a Hungarian producer of S&M films, released \"Gestapo\", \"Gestapo 2\", and \"Dr. Mengele\" in 2008, all of which are set in a Nazi prison camp and pay homage to \"Ilsa\" and the Italian exploitation films.\n\nIn 2007, as part of Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino's tribute to exploitation cinema, \"Grindhouse\", director Rob Zombie created a trailer for a fake film called \"Werewolf Women of the SS\", starring Nicolas Cage and Udo Kier. According to Zombie, \"Basically, I had two ideas. It was either going to be a Nazi movie or a women-in-prison film, and I went with the Nazis. There's all those movies like \"Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS\"; \"Fräulein Devil\"; and \"Love Camp 7\"—I've always found that to be the most bizarre genre.\" On December 18, 2007, Zombie posted an entry on his MySpace page, asking if people would want to see a feature-length version of \"Werewolf Women of the SS\". \"Iron Sky\" and \"Nazis at the Center of the Earth\" (both released in 2012) are in a similar vein.\n\nMost of the Nazi exploitation films have stalag settings with young female inmates like \"Women's Camp 119\". Their tormentors are female or male Nazi officers in SS uniforms, usually speaking with a fake German accent and irrelevant or mispronounced German words, who often use \"experiments\" as excuses to implement sadistic physical violence (perhaps inspired by the work of people like Josef Mengele, who performed medical experiments that often killed people). There are scenes of sexual conduct or, more routinely, exposed nude bodies of the victimised inmates. The level of violence depicted in these films may often reach the gore level.\n\nThis genre mainly focused on female SS officers. It presented them as lusty as well as buxom women, such as Dyanne Thorne's Ilsa, who also sexually abused their male prisoners (mainly in non-statutory female-on-male rape fashion). As the setting is a Stalag (prisoner-of-war camp), not a concentration camp, the prisoners are mainly Allied soldiers, not Jewish civilians.\n\nThere are also many films that do not follow the conventions of Nazi exploitation, such as \"Bordel SS\" (1978) of José Bénazéraf (one of the very few Nazi exploitation films to hold the dubious honor of having actual hardcore sex) and \"Salon Kitty\" (1976) of Tinto Brass. These films are not usually considered as \"prototypical\" Nazi exploitation films and qualify more for the \"art house\" subgenre. However, because of the vague term, even the film \"Il portiere di notte\" (\"The Night Porter\") (1974) by Liliana Cavani that (in the opinion of many) lacks the exploitation motive, may be deemed one such film.\n\nLaura Frost's book \"Sex Drives: Fantasies of Fascism in Literary Modernism\" (2002) () says that the genre is part of a problematic attempt to link political deviance (i.e. fascism, militarism, genocide) with sexual deviance (i.e. sadomasochism, homosexuality, transvestism, pedophilia).\n\nSometime in the early 1980s, Nazi exploitation films made their way onto the British market, made popular by the growing VHS home video technology. With major Hollywood studios steering clear of the new format, it was left to small, domestic companies to populate the shelves with tapes. A small company from England, GO Video, purchased the rights to an Italian film named \"SS Experiment Camp\". The company ran a marketing campaign with full-page ads showing a naked woman hanging from her feet, a swastika dangling from her wrist and an SS commander looming in the background. Advertisements for the film in video rental stores became a target for protestors, who picketed such stores and petitioned for the film to be banned. After the Video Recordings Act, most of the Nazi exploitation films (labelled 'Nazi Nasties') were denied BBFC classifications. The following Nazi exploitation films were taken off the shelves:\n\n\nOf the above films, only \"SS Experiment Camp\" is now available in the U.K..\n\nIn Israel specifically, during the 1960s, \"Stalag fiction\" was pocket books whose stories focused on the unique features of this genre. The phenomena took ground in parallel to the 1961 Eichmann trial. Sales of this pornographic literature broke all records in Israel as hundreds of thousands of copies were sold at kiosks.\nThey were inspired by Ka-tzetnik 135633's \"House of Dolls\", the experiences of a Jewish girl prostituted in the \"Joy Division\" (Block 24) of the Auschwitz camp, the factuality of which is disputed.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "41934853", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41934853", "title": "Pan (2015 film)", "text": "Pan (2015 film)\n\nPan is a 2015 American fantasy film directed by Joe Wright and written by Jason Fuchs. The film serves as a prequel to \"Peter and Wendy\" from Scottish author J. M. Barrie, which was first staged in 1904, and focuses on an alternative origin story for Peter Pan and Captain Hook. It stars Levi Miller as the title character, along with Hugh Jackman, Garrett Hedlund, Rooney Mara, and Amanda Seyfried.\n\n\"Pan\"'s world premiere was held in London on September 20, 2015, and it was theatrically released in the United States on October 9, 2015, by Warner Bros. Pictures. \"Pan\" grossed $128.4 million against a production budget of $150 million and was widely considered a box office bomb, resulting in significant loss for the studio. The film received generally negative reviews, with criticism calling the plot formulaic and the action heavily-reliant on CGI.\n\nNewborn Peter (Levi Miller), who has a mysterious pan flute pendant, is left by his mother Mary (Amanda Seyfried) on the steps of an orphanage in London, an establishment under the care of the abusive Mother Barnabas (Kathy Burke). Several years later, during World War II, upon learning that Mother Barnabas is hoarding food for herself, Peter and his best friend Nibs (Lewis MacDougall) try to steal it to distribute among themselves and the other orphans but they are caught. In the process, Peter finds a letter written by his mother, declaring her love and assuring Peter they will meet again \"in this world or another\".\n\nIn retaliation for the boys' mischief, Mother Barnabas summons pirates who kidnap Peter, Nibs and several others. Nibs manages to escape but Peter does not. He is captured and taken aboard a flying pirate ship. Following an aerial battle with several Spitfires the ship takes Peter to Neverland, a magical realm beyond space and time, where he is forced to become a slave laborer and mine for Pixum (crystallized Fairy Dust) on behalf of the terrible pirate Blackbeard (Hugh Jackman) who uses it to prevent himself from aging. Peter befriends another miner, named James Hook (Garrett Hedlund). After insulting Blackbeard's men, Peter is forced to walk the plank over the deep mine, but survives by flying. Blackbeard then tells Peter about an old prophecy involving a boy who could fly who would one day kill him, but Peter refuses to believe he is that boy.\n\nPeter joins Hook and his accomplice, Sam \"Smee\" Smiegel (Adeel Akhtar), stealing one of Blackbeard's flying ships and escapes into the forest. There they are found by the native chief's daughter Tiger Lily (Rooney Mara) and nearly executed but then Chief Great Little Panther (Jack Charles) notices Peter's pan flute pendant, left to him by Mary, which is said to belong to their people's greatest hero, the legendary Pan. Using the Memory Tree, Tiger Lily tells Peter that many years ago when the natives and the fairies united to fight together against the pirates under Blackbeard, the Fairy Prince and the love of Blackbeard's life, Mary, fell in love, but when Blackbeard discovered them, the Prince took human form to rescue Mary. But as fairies could live in human form for only one day, the Prince sacrificed his life for Mary. Mary was then forced to hide their newborn son Peter in the other world on Earth and seek shelter in the Fairy Kingdom when she and the fairies had to retreat. As part of his half-fairy heritage, Peter has the ability to fly, but is unable to do so because of his lack of faith.\n\nFearful of Blackbeard's punishment, Smee betrays the natives' location to him, and in the ensuing battle, Chief Great Little Panther is murdered by Blackbeard, who also reveals that he killed Peter's mother. Peter is hurt to learn that Tiger Lily had lied to Peter, telling him his mother is still alive, but she explains that he would have walked away from his destiny if he knew the truth.\n\nPeter, Hook, and Tiger Lily escape in a raft and head to the Fairy Kingdom to enlist their help in defeating the pirates. Along the way, Peter falls into the river and is nearly eaten by giant crocodiles before being rescued by the mermaids, after which he has a vision of Blackbeard accidentally killing Mary as she defended the Fairy Kingdom from his offensive. Despondent over their chances, Hook leaves while Peter and Tiger Lily arrive at the Fairy Kingdom alone, only to be ambushed by Blackbeard who plans to use the fairies' vast amount of Pixum to live forever. Blackbeard takes Peter's pan flute pendant, which is the key to the fairy kingdom, opens their gates and launches an attack.\n\nPeter escapes and befriends one of the fairies, named Tinker Bell. Together, they rally the rest of the Neverland fairies to fight the pirates while Tiger Lily duels Blackbeard. Hook returns on the stolen ship and fights Blackbeard's right-hand man Bishop (Nonso Anozie) until the ship tips over, sending both falling to their deaths. Peter conquers his fears and flies to save Hook, while Blackbeard and his men are overpowered by the fairies. Forced into an abyss, they subsequently fall to their deaths. Smee is the sole survivor having fled during the battle. Peter then sees a vision of Mary, who reaffirms him to be Neverland's savior: Peter Pan.\n\nShortly afterwards, Peter and Hook, now the captain of the \"Jolly Roger\", return to London to rescue Nibs and the other orphans, who become part of Peter's crew, the Lost Boys. Peter and Hook reaffirm their friendship, certain that nothing will ever go wrong between them.\n\nThe script for the film was listed on Hollywood's 2013 Black List. In January 2014, Garrett Hedlund was cast as a younger version of Captain Hook. On January 24, 2014, Jackman was officially cast as the pirate Blackbeard. In February, a casting call was issued for the role of Peter Pan, which went to newcomer Levi Miller in March. In April 2014, Amanda Seyfried was cast. In August 2014, British model Cara Delevingne was chosen to play a mermaid. Rooney Mara was cast as Tiger Lily, causing controversy due to her being of European ancestry, while Tiger Lily is traditionally portrayed as a Native American. Also considered for the role of Tiger Lily were actresses Lupita Nyong'o and Adèle Exarchopoulos.\n\nAccording to critics of the casting there are very few main roles for Native American women in Hollywood, and that the choice not only took one away from a Native American actress, but also perpetuated the invisibility of Native Americans in film. According to TheWrap, director Joe Wright was trying to create a \"very international and multi-racial\" world, although the majority of main characters (including the four lead actors) are white. A petition was created in response to the casting to urge Warner Bros. studios to stop casting white actors in roles for people of color. Previous portrayals of the Piccaninny tribe in \"Peter Pan\" have been criticized as racist.\n\nCritics of the casting in \"Pan\" suggested that Warner Bros. may have wanted to avoid repeating the alleged racism of previous \"Peter Pan\" stories, by altering the ethnicity of the Piccaninnies, rather than using a stereotypical portrayal of the source material. Many also felt that native actresses and actors were never given an opportunity to make it to mainstream films, with native roles being traditionally given to non-natives.\nOn April 28, 2014, the film's principal photography began. Many natural scenes in the film were from Son Doong Cave, Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park and Ninh Bình Province in Vietnam. The captured scenes were then graphically edited into the film.\n\nThe film's soundtrack was released in 2015. It was composed by John Powell, and additional music by Anthony Willis, Batu Sener, Paul Mounsey. Dario Marianelli, a frequent collaborator with Wright, had composed a score for the film, but Warner Bros. later replaced him with Powell after test screenings.\n\n\nOn December 12, 2013, Warner Bros. set for a June 26, 2015 release, with Joe Wright as director. The release was pushed back several times, and the studio eventually decided on October 9, 2015, in part to avoid box office competition from summer blockbusters such as \"Ant-Man\" and \"\".\n\nThe new release date also gave the producers more time to work on editing and visual effects during post-production. The film was first released in Australia, on September 25, 2015. It was then released in key markets two weeks later, including Germany, Russia, Korea, and Brazil, on October 8. That was followed by Mexico and Spain the next day.\n\nThe film opened in the United Kingdom on October 16, 2015, and France on October 21, 2015, followed by China on October 22, 2015, Japan on October 31, 2015, and Italy on November 12, 2015.\n\n\"Pan\" was originally planned for an IMAX release, as evident in early posters, trailers, and press, but was cancelled and only received non-IMAX presentations.\n\n\"Pan\" was released on DVD and Blu-ray on December 22, 2015, by Warner Home Video, two-and-a-half months after the film's release. \"Pan\" was one of the first Ultra HD Blu-ray released on March 1, 2016.\n\n\"Pan\" was financially unsuccessful. It grossed $35.1 million in North America and $93.2 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $128.3 million. In comparison, its production budget was reported to be $150 million, and the total spent on marketing was estimated at $100–125 million.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the film grossed $5.2 million on its opening day. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $15.3 million, below the studio's $20 million projection, and finished third at the box office. Several factors have been attributed to the financial failure of \"Pan\". \"Forbes\" blogger Scott Mendelson attributed this to the absence of notable movie stars. Despite the presence of Jackman, \"like any number of would-be big stars who are best known for a certain franchise, his opening weekend strength dips when he's not playing his trademark character.\" Outside of the \"X-Men\" franchise, his biggest openings are \"Van Helsing\" ($51 million) and the $27 million debuts of \"Real Steel\" and \"Les Misérables\". \"Variety\" described the departure of the film in tone and writings that made earlier Peter Pan stories and films a success; from Jackman's role as Blackbeard to the inclusion of contemporary pop songs from Nirvana and the Ramones which is peculiar for a children's film adaptation. \"Without the Disney seal of approval, audiences are a bit wary of these fairy tale adaptations,\" said Jeff Bock, a box office analyst with Exhibitor Relations. He added, \"It veered off the Peter Pan path quite extensively and it was just too far left of center for a generation that grew up with \"Hook\" and sees that as the definitive account.\" Warner Bros. declined to discuss \"Pan\"s box office results.\n\n\"Pan\" also struggled internationally, grossing $20.4 million on its opening weekend from 54 markets from over 11,000 screens. 3D comprised 85% of the opening gross. The film was released in Australia on September 24, 2015, to take advantage of the prime September school holidays, where it grossed $1.5 million in its opening weekend. Elsewhere, it opened in the U.K. with $4.1 million, and No. 1 in Mexico ($2.9 million), Brazil ($1.8 million), Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand and No. 2 in Russia and the CIS with $2 million (behind \"The Martian\"), Spain with $1.7 million (behind \"Regression\"), Hong Kong, Singapore and the Philippines.\n\n\"The Hollywood Reporter\" estimated that the film cost $275 million to produce and market worldwide—while \"The New York Times\" reported at least $250 million—and noted that the financial losses by Warner Bros. could finish anywhere between $130 to $150 million. The site suggested that if the film overperformed in China—the world's second largest movie market—the losses could have been lower. Opening in China on October 22, 2015, it failed to meet expectations. Based on its production cost and factoring in the percentage of ticket sales kept by theater owners, analysts estimated that \"Pan\" needed to take in at least $400–500 million worldwide to break even. The financial loss incurred by \"Pan\" puts it alongside \"Tomorrowland\" and \"Jupiter Ascending\" as one of the biggest box office failures of 2015.\n\nOn review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 27%, based on 184 reviews, and an average rating of 4.6/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"Pan\" finds a few bursts of magic in its prequel treatment of classic characters, though not enough to offset the rushed plot and shrill, CGI-fueled action.\" On Metacritic, the film a score of 36 out of 100 based on reviews from 35 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".\n\nA.O. Scott of \"The New York Times\" called the action scenes \"murky and chaotic\" and stated, \"The dominant emotion in \"Pan\" is the desperation of the filmmakers, who frantically try to pander to a young audience they don’t seem to respect, understand or trust.\" The main characters lacked chemistry and depth according to Todd McCarthy of \"The Hollywood Reporter\", who added that with the exception of Levi Miller's Pan, \"the characters don't reasonably comport with one's pre-existing images of them\". He also called a good portion of the film \"a seriously extended chase that possesses hefty CGI-propelled dynamics but absolutely no suspense and a very limited sense of fun\". Andrew Barker of \"Variety\" praised the film's technical achievements and action sequences but found it depressing overall: \"\"Pan\" swaps puckish mischief and innocence for doses of Steampunk design, anachronistic music, a stock “chosen one” narrative and themes of child labor, warfare and unsustainable mineral mining exchanges\".\n\nIn a more positive review, Bill Zwecker of \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, calling Levi Miller \"a truly wonderful cinematic discovery\" and adding that the film is \"chock-full with thrilling action sequences, vivid costumes and well-executed special effects\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it a 78% overall positive score.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "937711", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=937711", "title": "Puttin' On the Ritz", "text": "Puttin' On the Ritz\n\n\"Puttin' On the Ritz\" is a song written by Irving Berlin. He wrote it in May 1927 and first published it on December 2, 1929. It was registered as an unpublished song August 24, 1927 and again on July 27, 1928. It was introduced by Harry Richman and chorus in the musical film \"Puttin' On the Ritz\" (1930). According to \"The Complete Lyrics of Irving Berlin\", this was the first song in film to be sung by an interracial ensemble. The title derives from the slang expression \"to put on the Ritz\", meaning to dress very fashionably. The expression was inspired by the opulent Ritz Hotel.\n\nHit phonograph records of the tune in its original period of popularity of 1929–1930 were recorded by Harry Richman and by Fred Astaire, with whom the song is particularly associated. Every other record label had their own version of this popular song (Columbia, Brunswick, Victor, and all of the dime store labels). Richman's Brunswick version of the song became the number-one selling record in America.\n\nThe song received renewed popularity and became known to a new generation of fans in 1983 when Taco, a Dutch musician, recorded and released a new version of the song. Taco's version was accompanied by a music video, which aired on MTV and other music video networks and programs.\n\nThe song is in AABA form, with a verse. According to John Mueller, the central device in the A section is the \"use of delayed rhythmic resolution: a staggering, off-balance passage, emphasized by the unorthodox stresses in the lyric, suddenly resolves satisfyingly on a held note, followed by the forceful assertion of the title phrase.\" The marchlike B section, which is only barely syncopated, acts as a contrast to the previous rhythmic complexities. According to Alec Wilder, in his study of American popular song, for him, the rhythmic pattern in \"Puttin' On the Ritz\" is \"the most complex and provocative I have ever come upon.\"\n\nThe original version of Berlin's song included references to the then-popular fad of flashily-dressed but poor black Harlemites parading up and down Lenox Avenue, \"Spending ev'ry dime / For a wonderful time\". In the United Kingdom, the song was popularized through the BBC's radio broadcasts of Joe Kaye's Band performing it at The Ritz Hotel, London restaurant in the 1930s. The song was featured with the original lyrics in the 1939 film \"Idiot's Delight\", where it was performed by Clark Gable and chorus, and this routine was selected for inclusion in \"That's Entertainment\" (1974). Columbia released a 78 recording of Fred Astaire singing the original lyrics in May 1930 (B-side – \"Crazy Feet\", both recorded on March 26, 1930). For the film \"Blue Skies\" (1946), where it was performed by Fred Astaire, Berlin revised the lyrics to apply to affluent whites strutting \"up and down Park Avenue\". This second version was published after being registered for copyright on August 28, 1946.\n\nIn 1982, singer Taco released a synth-pop cover version of \"Puttin' On the Ritz\" as a single from his album \"After Eight\", released on Polydor of Germany. The single was accompanied by a music video, the original version of which contains characters in blackface and has since been banned from many networks. An alternative version eliminates many shots of the blackface characters, though some remain.\n\nThe single was a global hit, reaching No. 1 in \"Cashbox\" as well as No. 4 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart, making Irving Berlin, then 95, the oldest ever living songwriter to have one of his compositions enter the top ten. It was certified Gold by the RIAA for selling over one million copies. It was Taco's only hit in the United States. This version of the song was ranked No. 53 in VH1's \"100 Greatest One Hit Wonders of the 80s\" special.\n\nThe song topped the charts in Sweden and New Zealand, and it entered the Top 5 in numerous countries including Australia, Norway, Austria and Canada.\n\nThe Taco cover of the song was used in \"Baby Geniuses\" (1999) and \"The Call\" (2013). Alvin and the Chipmunks covered Taco's version of the song for \"Don't Be a Vidiot\", a 1984 episode of \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\".\n\n"}

Quantic Dream is known for promoting interactive storytelling, with founder David Cage as the primary creative force.\n\nDavid Cage, after fifteen years as a composer, started writing the concept and story of \"The Nomad Soul\" in 1994. He ended up with a 200-page document and sent it to contacts he had acquired during his time making music, who noted that its execution would not be technically feasible. To prove them wrong, Cage hired a team of friends and made an office out of a sound booth, with a financial deadline of six months to come up with a game engine and prototype. In the final week, Cage travelled to London and met with publisher Eidos Interactive. With the project funded and a publisher secured, \"The Nomad Soul\" was in full development; musician David Bowie played two characters and created ten original songs. On 3 June 1997, Cage founded the company as Quantic Dream SA; the name draws influence from the term \"quantum physics\". The game released in November 1999, selling more than 600,000 copies.\nIn 2004, Quantic Dream provided motion capture for the film \"Immortal\". They followed \"The Nomad Soul\" with \"Fahrenheit\", published by Atari, Inc. in September 2005, introducing elements that would endure in their later games—ethical ambiguity, romance, the inability to perish, and interactive storytelling. It received multiple awards and sold over one million copies. The same year, Quantic Dream revealed \"The Casting\", a technology demonstration of what could be accomplished on PlayStation 3. This preceded the partnership with Sony Computer Entertainment to bring \"Heavy Rain\" into existence, marking \"something more personal\" for Cage. \"Heavy Rain\" launched in 2010 to critical acclaim, winning three awards at the 7th British Academy Games Awards and selling a total of 5.3 million copies. By late 2011, another deal had been established with Sony. The following year, Quantic Dream showed another PlayStation 3 tech demo, \"Kara\", taking advantage of new investments in motion capture facilities. The second title with Sony was 2013's \"\", starring actress Ellen Page and actor Willem Dafoe, which received mixed reviews from critics and managed to sell 2.8 million copies. It was the second video game to be shown at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2013, the same year that \"The Dark Sorcerer\", a tech demo running on PlayStation 4, was unveiled at E3.\n\nIn 2014, Quantic Dream doubled their investment in Vicon, whose motion capture technology was previously used in \"Heavy Rain\" and \"Beyond: Two Souls\". The company's fifth video game and third published by Sony, \"\", was announced the year after. Based on the \"Kara\" tech demo, it spent four years in development before releasing in May 2018. Quantic Dream's most successful launch to date, it has sold 1.5 million copies. Around that time, Quantic Dream employed 180 staff members, five fewer than were reported in 2016.\n\nIn January 2018, three French news outlets—\"Le Monde\", \"Mediapart\", and \"Canard PC\"—published the results of a joint investigation into the company's business practices, alleging a harmful studio culture, overwork, and sexist or racist behaviour by employees. The reports named Cage and chief operating officer Guillaume de Fondaumière as perpetrators of inappropriate behaviour and overworking the staff. Controversial images exchanged by email and posted around the office included photos of studio collaborators and employees digitally edited to appear as Nazis and porn stars. Cage said the allegations were \"ridiculous, absurd and grotesque\"; de Fondaumière stated, \"I will be extremely clear: it's absolutely false\". As a result, Quantic Dream levied a lawsuit against \"Le Monde\" and \"Mediapart\", while \"Canard PC\" received two \"threatening letters\". That July, Quantic Dream lost one court case against an employee who left due to the scandal.\n\nQuantic Dream's video games are written and directed by Cage and branded accordingly, with the purpose of making new intellectual properties. Cage has declared that his mission is to evoke emotion through interactive storytelling, highlighting empathy, sadness, and guilt in opposition to frustration, competition, and anger. As such, he described purchasing \"Heavy Rain\" as a \"political act\" that others like it could be made. The developer strives to appeal to gamers and non-gamers alike, considering video games to be the same as any artform. It is customary at Quantic Dream to develop an engine for each new game, hardware, or platform; Cage believes that, while an engine's methodology can be ported, its code cannot. Tech demos have likewise become tradition. In France, Quantic Dream is afforded a 20% tax break on production costs, without which Cage would move the company to Canada to keep up with the competition.\n"}
{"id": "61061", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61061", "title": "Shanghai Express (film)", "text": "Shanghai Express (film)\n\nShanghai Express is a 1932 American pre-Code film directed by Josef von Sternberg and starring Marlene Dietrich, Clive Brook, Anna May Wong, and Warner Oland. It was written by Jules Furthman, based on a 1931 story by Harry Hervey. \"Shanghai Express\" was the fourth of seven films von Sternberg and Dietrich made together.\n\n\"Shanghai Express\" was released during the midst of the Great Depression. The film was a huge hit with the public, grossing $3.7 million in its initial screenings in the United States alone, becoming the biggest financial success of the Dietrich-von Sternberg collaborations, and was the highest-grossing movie of 1932, surpassing the all-star \"Grand Hotel\".\n\n\"Shanghai Express\" was remade as \"Night Plane from Chungking\" (1942) and \"Peking Express\" (1951).\n\nIn 1931, China is embroiled in a civil war. Friends of British Captain Donald \"Doc\" Harvey (Clive Brook) envy him because the fabulously notorious Shanghai Lily (Marlene Dietrich) is a fellow passenger on the express train from Peking to Shanghai. Because the name means nothing to him, they inform him that she is a \"coaster\" or \"woman who lives by her wits along the China coast\" – in other words, a courtesan. On the journey, Harvey encounters Lily, who turns out to be his former lover, Madeline. Five years earlier, she had played a trick on Harvey to gauge his love for her, but it backfired and he left her. She frankly informs him that, in the interim, \"It took more than one man to change my name to Shanghai Lily.\" When Lily makes it clear that she still cares deeply for him, it becomes apparent that his feelings also have not changed when she inadvertently sees the watch she gave him with her photograph still in it.\n\nAmong the other passengers are fellow coaster Hui Fei (Anna May Wong), Lily's companion; Christian missionary Mr. Carmichael (Lawrence Grant), who at first condemns the two \"fallen women\"; inveterate gambler Sam Salt (Eugene Pallette); opium dealer Eric Baum (Gustav von Seyffertitz); boarding house keeper Mrs. Haggerty (Louise Closser Hale); French officer Major Lenard (Emile Chautard) and a mysterious Eurasian, Henry Chang (Warner Oland).\n\nChinese government soldiers board and search the train and apprehend a high-ranking rebel agent. Chang then makes his way to a telegraph office and sends a coded message. Later, the train is stopped and taken over by the rebel army and its powerful warlord, who turns out to be Chang. Chang begins to question the passengers, looking for someone important enough to exchange for his valued aide. He finds what he wants in Harvey, who is on his way to perform brain surgery on the Governor-General of Shanghai. Chang offers to take Shanghai Lily to his palace, but she claims she has reformed. When Chang refuses to accept her answer, Harvey breaks in and knocks him down. Because Chang needs Harvey alive, he swallows (but does not forget) the insult. Chang then has Hui Fei brought to him in his quarters, where he forces himself on her.\n\nThe government releases Chang's man, but Chang decides to blind Harvey for his insolence. Out of love, Lily offers herself in return for Harvey's safe release. Harvey remains unaware of the danger that he is in and of Lily's reason for going with Chang. Chang is stabbed to death by Hui Fei who tells Harvey what has transpired. Finding Lily, the trio boards the train and departs before the body is discovered. The missionary Carmichael, trusting his instincts, gets Lily to reveal the truth about saving Harvey. She insists that he not enlighten Harvey because love must go hand in hand with faith. When the train finally reaches Shanghai safely, Lily offers Harvey her love unconditionally but demands the same in return. Harvey finally breaks down and embraces her.\n\n\n Although set in China, there were few Chinese actors in the production. In production from August to November 1931, \"Shanghai Express\" was released in 1932. \n\nBased on Henry Hervey's story (\"Sky Over China,\" also known as \"China Pass\"), \"Shanghai Express\" was, in turn, loosely based on the May 6, 1923, incident in which a Shandong warlord captured the Shanghai to Beijing express train, where 25 westerners and 300 Chinese were taken hostage. All of the hostages captured in the Lincheng Outrage were successfully ransomed, including Lucy Aldrich. Paramount studio heads were concerned that the Hays Office kept a close watch on the film due to the portrayal of the Reverend Carmichael and the depiction of the Chinese revolution.\n\nThe story also echoes elements of Guy de Maupassant's short story \"Boule de Suif\" in the setting of travellers stopped in a country at war and a woman called upon to sleep with the commander in charge. However the denouement is altered, and while the travellers are released, the woman murders the commander and her fellow travelling companions change their attitude towards her.\n\n\"Shanghai Express\" was dubbed \"\"Grand Hotel\" on wheels\". Critically reviewed, the film was praised by Mordaunt Hall of \"The New York Times\" as a star vehicle for Marlene Dietrich. \"Miss Dietrich gives an impressive performance. She is langourous but fearless as Lily.\" Other characters are also singled out, \"Clive Brooks's performance is also noteworthy ...\" \"... Warner Oland is excellent as Mr. Chang and Anna May Wong makes the most of the rôle of the brave Chinese girl. Eugene Pallette serves splendidly as Sam Salt.\"\n\nJonathan Spence, writing about the film's usefulness as a piece of history says that the real events of 1923 Lincheng Incident were far more dramatic but says that nonetheless it is \"a wonderful film, with great performances by Dietrich – 'it took more than one man to change my name to Shanghai Lily' – and Anna May Wong.\" \n\nThe critic for \"Senses of Cinema\" called \"Shanghai Express\", (a) \"riotous exercise in excess in every area; the visuals are overpowering and sumptuous; the costumes ornate and extravagant; the sets a riot of fabrics, light and space; and all of it captured in the most delectable black-and-white cinematography that one can find anywhere.\" He discusses the film's interest in the questions of race and colonialism and notes the \"peculiar bifurcation\" of the film's view of race; most of the respectable \"white\" characters in the film are seen as both flawed and racist. Only Dietrich, Wong, and to some extent \"Doc\" Harvey, have any \"real moral agency.\" He calls the film \"surprisingly feminist,\" with Dietrich being a \"strong, dominating presence\" and Wong's character her equal. \n\n\"Shanghai Express\" is memorable for its stylistic black-and-white chiaroscuro cinematography. Even though Lee Garmes was awarded the Academy Award for Best Cinematography, according to Dietrich, it was von Sternberg who was responsible for most of it.\n\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\n\n\n"}

The benefits attributed to not using a computer for 24 hours range from electricity savings to getting back in touch with friends and nature.\n\nDenis Bystrov and Nikolay Kudrevatykh were the co-founders of Shutdown Day; Bystrov originally conceived the idea of Shutdown Day, and the co-founders developed the concept in 2007, while living in Canada. Michael Taylor, an original partner in the idea of shutting down one's computer down for a day, said:\n\nMany thanks to our friend Andrei Dryzgalovich who designed, developed and technically supported our project.\n\nShutdown Day is a global Internet experiment whose purpose is to get people to think about how their lives have changed with the increasing use of the home computer, and whether or not any good things are being lost because of this. The concept of the \"Shutdown Day\" project is to simply shutdown one's computer for one whole day each year, and become involved in other activities: outdoors, nature, sports, fun stuff with friends and family, just to remind yourself that there is a real world beyond the computer screen.\n\nShutdown Day started in early 2007, when Denis Bystrov realized that he spent too much time with his computer and wanted to spend more time with his family. Bystrov teamed up with his friends Nikolay Kudrevatykh, Michael Taylor (former trade floor occupant in stock markets in London, England) and David Bridle (part-time film maker from Cardiff, Wales), to present a challenge on the Internet, through the website shutdownday.org, challenging people to avoid their computers for 24 hours. The idea was simple:\n\nWhat began as an innocent question, gathered an Internet chain reaction following, which drew millions of viewers from across the world. Here is a summary of the results from the Shutdown Day 2007 campaign:\n\n\nLater in 2007, as Bystrov was discussing the future of Shutdown Day with another friend, Ashutosh Rajekar, also a victim of excessive technology use, he realized that both had some interesting ideas to share regarding the future direction of Shutdown Day. Eventually, Denis, Nikolay and Ashutosh decided to team up to register as a non-profit organization in the province of Quebec.\n\nIn 2008, \"Shutdown Day\" was held on May 3. The message to turn off computers and engage in a day without technology was carried by Reuters wire services two days prior to the second annual event. Rajekar's message was now indicating that computers, televisions, and technology in general was having a negative effect on society. Shortly prior to the event, Reuters carried a story encouraging users to step away from their technology for 24 hours. The estimated that the inaugural 2007 event had garnered over 50,000 participants. Many of the group had plans to visit parks, engage in cleaning up public areas, enjoy hiking, camping, and outdoor photography.\n\nShutdown day 2009 was held on May 2. The campaign started on March 1 and lasted through May 2, 2009. IT Wire reported that media organizations such as Fox News, CNN, The Toronto Sun, The Washington Post were now carrying stories about Shutdown Day. C|Net reported that by April 23, almost 55,000 people had agreed to turn off their computers for 24 hours by going to shutdownday.org and clicking on the \"yes, I can do it\" link.\n\n"}

SOD was founded in December 1995 by Ganari Takahashi, who retired from the company in March 2005 and is currently working in agriculture. The company is one of the largest adult video companies in Japan and is notable for its creative approach to adult videos.\n\nIn 2009, the company, under president Chie Sugawara (菅原 千恵), had 128 employees (27 male and 101 female) and a capital of 100 million yen (about US$1.1 million). For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2009, SOD had total sales of 14.9 billion yen (about US$165 million) and a profit of 670 million yen (about US$7.4 million). For 2007 the figures were sales of 13.5 billion yen (about US$120 million) and profit of 900 million yen (about US$8 million). SOD has been a fast-growing company since its foundation, going from sales of 300 million yen in 1996 to 1.5 billion in 1998 to 4.1 billion in 2000, 7.8 billion in 2003, and 9 billion in 2005. In spite of its rapid growth, it was overtaken in sales volume in the early 2000s by rival AV producer Hokuto, which also absorbed some of SOD's former companies. After peaking in 2008, Hokuto sales have plunged while annual income at SOD has stayed level at about 15 billion yen (about US$150 million) for the 2008-2010 period allowing it to become once again the largest adult video group in Japan.\n\nOne director has described their product this way: \"SOD's porno is ridiculous. There's nothing really sordid about it\" and \"different to anything else in the porno world\". Some of its most notable approaches have been quiz shows that tested the knowledge of AV (adult video) actresses with challenging questions, CFNM (clothed female, naked male) videos that have women studying a man's penis (the \"Uniforms, Undies and All Naked School Multi-Story\" series), and plots where women are put under hypnosis. There have also been nude sports series, the senior citizen epic \"All Naked Nursing Home for the Elderly\", Company Sex Parties, Summer Festivals (a festival focused on penises and not to be confused with the actual Shinto festival dealing with fertility) and Sex Camps.\n\nOne of their releases from May 2006, \"500 Person Sex\" (\"500人SEX\"), features 250 couples having sex (apart from each other but in the same room) in an impressive synchronized way, and thus got some raised eyebrows from occidental adult sites. The video received a special jury award at the 2006 AV Open.\n\nBy 2003, SOD was releasing more than 1,000 adult video titles per year. SOD also works with a number of companies in other areas and has thus become a group (zaibatsu) of companies mainly in the area of producing adult videos. Besides producing videos the company also produces condoms and lubricant lotions, PC games (aka hentai games), and adult anime.\n\nOutside of the adult area, SOD is also involved in producing softcore and genre movies, idol videos and TV programs. Among their mainstream movies, some have featured SOD AV actresses including the 2008 horror film \"Yoroi Samurai Zombie\" with Nana Natsume and the 2006 comedy-drama \"Tokyo Daigaku Monogatari\", directed by Tatsuya Egawa and featuring Sasa Handa. A third entry was the 2014 science fiction film \"Danger Dolls\", with SOD star Mana Sakura making an appearance.\n\nIn 2004, the company announced plans to produce an adaptation of the Shougakukan \"Big Comic Original\" manga series \"Ajisai no Uta\" (\"Song of Hydrangea\") as an original video animation (OAV) for a general audience. Volume 1 of the series was released in August 2004 and the fourth and final volume came out in December of that year.\n\nInternally, SOD outsources work to its individual units, original video production being done by SOD Create Inc. () headed by Daisuke Kasai (). This affiliate, founded in March 1999, was originally called and changed its name to SOD Create in 2001.\n\nPackage design for SOD is the realm of another division, SOD Artworks (SODアートワークス), founded in 2004, and under the leadership of Yoshino Toshimitsu ().\n\nIn addition to the SOD label, SOD Create has produced videos under the following labels:\n\nDirectors who have worked at SOD include:\n\nMany well-known AV Idols have performed for SOD:\n\nImportant thematic series at SOD include:\n\nFor the past several years, SOD has run a campaign to bring attention to the rise of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) in Japan and to increase the use of condoms. The program, called STOP! STD, has used former SOD star Nana Natsume as a spokeswoman.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2006, the company held the SOD AV Awards, an annual ceremony to present a series of awards to honor actresses, directors, and staff of companies in the SOD group. In 2006, the company also sponsored, along with Tokyo Sports, a wider award contest called the AV Open. Sixteen companies competed for a total prize pool of 25 Million yen with the winner being decided by sales of the videos entered in the contest.\n\nIn the second year of the AV Open competition, 19 companies participated and the SOD entry won by a large margin. But it was subsequently discovered that SOD had used company funds to buy thousands of their own videos. SOD was disqualified and the discredited AV Open was replaced the next year by the Hokuto Corporation sponsored AV Grand Prix.\n\nThe Japanese AV industry has several different \"ethics groups\", which are voluntary organizations to assure adherence with Japanese pornography laws and to regulate content and copyrights. The earliest of these organizations was founded by the major AV companies in 1972 and is known in English as the Nihon Ethics of Video Association (NEVA) or in Japanese, Nippon Video Rinri Kyōkai (日本ビデオ倫理協会 \"Japan Video Morality Association\"), usually abbreviated as \"Biderin\" or \"Viderin\" (ビデ倫). In response, SOD in 1996 began its own regulatory group known as the Media Ethics Association (Media Rinri Kyōkai or メディア倫理協会), usually abbreviated as Medirin(メディ倫). Medirin was composed of \"indie\" companies, independent AV studios which explored porn themes forbidden by NEVA rules and which used a smaller-pixeled censorship mosaic for their videos. Medirin was re-organized in 2005 to form the Content Soft Association (CSA), called in Japanese Content Soft Kyōdō Kumiai (コンテンツ・ソフト協同組合 \"Software Content Association\"), to review and regulate adult videos and adult game software. The CSA has more than 65 members among AV producers comprising most of the SOD group and some other major companies. Members include:\n\nThis is a list of the companies that were part of the SOD group as of June 2010.\n\n\n"}

He appeared regularly on television with his puppet, Lenny the Lion, whose catchphrase was \"Aw, don't embawass me!\" Hall is credited with having been one of the first ventriloquists to use a non-human puppet.\n\nHall was born in Chadderton, Lancashire, where his parents ran a working men's club. He was educated at St Patrick's School in Oldham and at De La Salle College in Pendleton, Salford. Hall initially worked as a ventriloquist with a boy dummy, named Mickey Finn, and won a talent show aged 15.\n\nHall created Lenny the Lion in 1954 after he visited the zoo while working at the summer season in Blackpool. Lenny was made from an old fox fur and papier-mâché, with a golf ball for the nose. He originally had a mouthful of fearsome teeth, but they were removed at the suggestion of singer Anne Shelton to avoid scaring children in the audience.\n\nHall and Lenny first appeared on BBC Television in 1956, in a variety show entitled \"Dress Rehearsal\" that also signalled Eric Sykes's television debut. The \"Lenny the Lion Show\" ran on from 1957 to 1960, followed by \"Lenny's Den\" in 1959 to 1961, and the pop music show \"Pops and Lenny\" in 1962 to 1963. In 1958 Bill Mevin created a comic strip based on \"Lenny the Lion\". Hall visited the United States in 1958, making his debut on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" with Lenny that year. Throughout the 1960s, Hall and Lenny appeared on stage in Blackpool and on television. The Beatles made one of their early TV appearances in a 1963 episode of \"Pops and Lenny\", singing \"From Me to You\" and \"Please, Please Me.\" David Bowie's father, Hayward Jones, worked on the show, and launched the Lenny the Lion Fan Club. Lenny advertised Trebor mints for three years. Hall released a single, \"Lenny's Bath Time\", in 1963.\n\nIn spite of the fact that Hall was a staunch Oldham Athletic fan, during the 1957–58 English football season, Hall took Lenny to the Den (old) which was then the home of Millwall F.C. and allowed Lenny to pose with his \"fellow Lions\" for publicity shots, much to the delight of all present in the ground.\n\nHall and Lenny continued to work in variety through the 1970s, appearing on television in programmes such as \"Crackerjack\" and \"3-2-1\". From 1977 to 1980, Hall regularly appeared in the educational television programme \"Reading With Lenny\". He wrote the \"Kevin the Kitten\" series of children's reading books which accompanied the series.\n\nHall married twice. He had two daughters from his first marriage. He married a second time in 1980, to dance teacher Denise Francis. He suffered from Alzheimer's disease in later life, and died in 2007 in Coventry aged 80. Dr Harry Brünjes, a long-standing family friend, gave the eulogy at the service.\n\n"}

Two days later, Cashis premiered the track \"Hi\" from the album. Later that day, it was released to iTunes as the album's fifth single.\n\n\"The County Hound 2\" was met with generally positive reviews from music critics. Omar Burgess of HipHopDX gave it a positive review saying, \"Ultimately, \"The County Hound 2\" serves as a welcome return for loyal Ca$his fans. Name recognition from his Shady days, production from Eminem and some of the lighter singles will likely draw in newcomers. Repeated listens offer a bottom-heavy album; the first half of which both informs and sometimes detracts from the latter portion with trite subject matter. But there’s enough raw talent here to impress a diverse cross section of fans, and when Ca$his chooses depth over accessibility he’s still scary good in the booth.\"\n"}

Musician Abraham Laboriel states, “…more than just practical music theory, this book is an outpouring of the heart and spirit…”. Rick Muchow, Music Director of Saddleback Church says, “…this is a guidebook to modern music theory that every musician needs”.\n\n"}

The title character was a barber surgeon played by comedian Steve Martin, a frequent host of the show. The central gag revolved around Theodoric's insistence on using bloodletting as a solution to any complaint or illness by his customers. \n\nIn one memorable episode, Theodoric said:\nAlso, during the sketch he would propose profound, innovative ideas that had the potential to change the course of history, but he would ultimately dismiss them, as in:\n\nMartin also appeared as Theodoric of York, Medieval Judge, in skits that lampooned both the medieval and modern judicial systems. In these skits, Martin's character Theodoric would summarily pass judgment based on the outcomes of trials by ordeal, such as throwing the accused, weighted, into a river to see if she would drown, in cases of suspected witchcraft. If the accused floated, she was determined to be guilty (because only by using her occult powers could she have risen to the surface), and if she sank and drowned, she was innocent. Upon deciding the accused was guilty, Theodoric would refer to the \"Book of Common Wisdom\" (a huge, dusty tome) to decide appropriate punishment. In the case of a man found guilty of adultery, Theodoric could not seem to find an appropriate punishment specified in the Book, so he pondered aloud, putting his hand on his chin and gazing up at the ceiling: \n\nAs with Theodoric of York, Medieval Barber, Martin would end his Medieval Judge skits by proposing modern legal concepts such as trial by a jury of one's peers, provision of defense counsel, innocence until proven guilty, prohibition of cruel and unusual punishments, etc., but end by saying... \"Naaaaaaaahhh!\"\n\nA similar skit (appearing only once) was aired on \"SCTV\" around the same time, focusing on a medieval couple living in England in the same era, and was called Master Ralph Roister Doister.\n\n"}

He ran three different establishments under that name, but his first – and most renowned – was located at 51 West 51st Street. He was known as a saloonkeeper, friend, and confidant to some of New York's biggest celebrities during that era.\n\nShor was born in Philadelphia to Orthodox Jewish parents – his father of Austrian descent from Germany and his mother from Russia. He and his two older sisters were raised in a home above the family candy store in South Philadelphia. When Shor was 15 years old, his mother was killed by an automobile while she sat on the stoop outside their home. His father committed suicide five years later. Shor attended the Drexel Institute of Technology and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania before working as a traveling shirt-and-underwear salesman.\n\nShor went to New York City in 1930 and found employment as a bouncer at the Five O'Clock Club, which served as his introduction to celebrities. He later worked at several other nightspots: The Napoleon Club, Lahiff's Tavern, the Ball & Chain, the Madison Royale, and Leon & Eddie's. He became a man about town in Manhattan after opening his own restaurant, Toots Shor's, at 51 West 51st Street. While the food there was known to be \"nuttin' fancy\" – standard American, sports-bar fare such as shrimp cocktail, steak, baked potato – the establishment became well known for who frequented there and the manner in which Shor interacted with them.\n\nShor was a raconteur and a master of the \"needle,\" jibes or quips directed at the famous. Celebrity alone was not enough to receive first-class service in Shor's restaurant. According to David Halberstam in his book \"The Summer of '49\", guests had to observe the unwritten \"code\" which prevailed in Shor's establishment. Charlie Chaplin, who was not privy to that code, was made to wait in line. When Chaplin complained, Shor told him to entertain the others who were waiting in line. One day, Hollywood boss Louis B. Mayer complained about waiting twenty minutes for a table and said, \"I trust the food will be worth all that waiting.\" Shor replied: \"It'll be better'n some of your crummy pictures I stood in line for.\" Once while standing outside his restaurant with Frank Sinatra and a crowd of screaming fans being held back by police, Toots pulled out a dollar bill out of his pocket and said to Frank, \"Here, kid, go across the street and buy me a paper.\" At the Opera with friends during the intermission Toots declared, \"I bet I'm the only bum in this joint that doesn't know how this thing ends.\"\n\nIn one incident, Shor outdrank comedian Jackie Gleason, famously leaving Gleason on the floor to prove the point. (At Toots' funeral, the coffin had a spray of red roses with a card which read, \"Save a Table for 2,\" signed: Jackie Gleason.)\n\nShor cultivated his celebrity following by giving them unqualified admiration, loyal friendship, and a kind of happy, boozy, old-fashioned male privacy. Those whom Shor really liked were called \"crum-bums\". Shor reputedly said that he didn’t care if he was a millionaire – so long as he could live like one.\n\nIn 1959, Shor sold the lease for his 51st Street restaurant for $1.5 million to William Zeckendorf. The following year, he opened at a new location at 33 West 52nd Street and tried to emulate the decor and atmosphere of the original. The then–Chief Justice, Earl Warren, considered Toots one of his closest friends. \"The Chief\" showed up to be photographed with a shovel full of dirt when Toots broke ground on Toots' 52nd street \"joint\".\n\nIn 1971, authorities padlocked the doors of the 52nd Street restaurant for nonpayment of federal, state, and local taxes totaling $269,516. He vowed to open again in three weeks, but 18 months passed before his restaurant at 5 East 54th Street opened. For a variety of reasons, however, his famous clientele never returned with their former regularity.\n\nShor and his wife Marion (\"Baby\") lived for many years in a 12-room double apartment at 480 Park Avenue where they raised their four children named Bari Ellen, Kerry, Rory and Tracey. Tracey, who was Toots' youngest daughter and a late arrival, was taken in and raised by his friends, comedian Bob Hope and his wife Dolores, who was her Godmother at birth and eventually her legal guardian.\n\nDuring his final years, they lived at the Drake Hotel. He died at age 73, ending a six-week stay in New York University Hospital.\n\nShor's financial affairs were usually shaky at best thanks to a cavalier attitude toward the IRS, coupled with a generous nature; debts were frequently forgiven for friends who had fallen on hard times, and drinks and meals were comped on a regular basis. Although indigent at the time of death, Shor expressed no regrets, stating that he started out broke and figured it was OK to go out that way as well.\n\nIn 1950, Shor was the subject of a three-part biography published in \"The New Yorker\" entitled \"Toots's World\" and written by John Bainbridge, who later combined them into a book. Twenty years later another biography, \"Toots\", was written by Hearst columnist Bob Considine. In 2006, the biographical documentary \"Toots\", in which his granddaughter Kristi Jacobson profiled his life, premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival. It took \"Best Film\" at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum's first annual film festival on November 12, 2006. \"Toots\" was released to theaters in the fall of 2007.\n\nBob Broderick, long time friend and Manager of Toots Shor's, was quoted in The Record, NY. 4/20/1968 saying,\"Having Toots Shor for a friend and Margaret for a wife is about all a man can ask for out of this life.\"\n\nFrom the 1950s-1960s, Shor was an occasional guest on television programs, including twice appearing on the CBS panel show \"What's My Line?\" as well as on programs such as \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\" and \"The Red Skelton Show\".\n\nShor was portrayed by Vlasta Vrána in \"Gleason\", a 2002 television biopic about the life of Jackie Gleason.\n\n"}

It is an aerial apparatus commonly found in circus performances. Trapeze acts may be static, spinning (rigged from a single point), swinging or flying, and may be performed solo, double, triple or as a group act. \n\nThe art of trapeze performance was developed by Jules Léotard, a young French acrobat and aerialist, in Toulouse in the mid-1800s. He invented the flying trapeze, practising over his father's swimming pool.\n\nIn the UK, many outdoor education centres offer an activity known as 'leap of faith'. This activity invites participants to climb to the top of a narrow pole and jump, arms outstretched, to grab a trapeze bar. Similar to the flying trapeze, gravity creates the swing. In this type of activity, participants are attached via rope and harness and an added challenge to get your legs over the trapeze can be included.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "55109765", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55109765", "title": "Veyshnoria", "text": "Veyshnoria\n\nVeyshnoria (, ) is a fictional state created for Zapad 2017, a joint Russo-Belarusian military training exercise. It neighbors Belarus and is an enemy of the Union State. Veyshnoria occupies most of the Grodno Region and the northwestern parts of the Minsk and Vitebsk regions. \n\nThere are two other fictional enemies of the Zapad 2017 participants: Vesbaria and Lubenia.\nLubenia straddles the Suwalki gap and covers parts of northeastern Poland and southwestern Lithuania, while Vesbaria covers the rest of Lithuania and central Latvia.\n\nThe \"proclamation\" of the state caused a response on the Internet, often humorous. Since September 2017, a web-based Veyshnoria have been proclaimed, which started acquiring the signs of an internet-based micronation with more than 10 thousand people signing for \"citizenship\" \n\nThe name \"Veyshnoria\" comes from the Baltic name of Veisnor (Lithuanian \"Vaišnoras\", Old Prussian \"Waisnor\") – \"one who willingly treats\" (hospitable). There are several places in Lithuania called Vaišnoriai (plural for \"Vaišnoras\").\n\nZapad 2017 was a joint strategic military exercise of the armed forces of the Russian Federation and Belarus (the Union State of Russia and Belarus) held 14–20 September 2017, in Belarus as well as in Russia′s Kaliningrad Oblast and other north-western areas.\n\nAccording to the scenario a conflict between \"The North\" (the Union State) and \"The West\" (a coalition of three aggressor states: Veyshnoria, Vesbaria and Lubenia) developed. \"The West\" tries to split the union of Belarus and Russia, worsen the socio-economic situation in the Union State, and force a change of leadership, and Veyshnoria is trying to annex parts of Belarus. After that, \"the West\" sends its troops enter the rest of the territory of Belarus. The Union State resists these actions.\nIn a post on Facebook, Belarusian economic analyst Sergey Chaly noticed a similarity between Veyshnoria and the region of Belarus where a large percentage of voters supported Zianon Pazniak in the first round of the 1994 presidential election. Journalist Leonid Bershidsky further pointed out that this territory has a high proportion of Catholic population and a high share of Belarusian-language speakers in the bilingual Russian-Belarusian state with dominant Russian Orthodox church. In Bershidsky's view these observations may be how the Zapad 2017 scenario was intended to be seen: Veyshnoria seeks destabilizaton of Belarus the same way, in the eyes of the Russian establishment, it happened in Ukraine (by pro-Western national forces, allegedly fomented by \"the West\").\n\nThe creation quickly found a humorous response in social media. On 30 August 2017, a satirical Twitter account of the Foreign Ministry of Veyshnoria appeared, which published political statements on behalf of the state. According to the account, the anthem of the state is the song \"Niamon\" (meaning \"Neman\") by the Belarusian band Stary Olsa. The same account says that the official residences of the state are in Grodno, the parliament and the government (in addition to the Ministry of Culture) in Lida, and the cultural capital of Veyshnoria is Smarhon. Veyshnoria is also present on Facebook, and its Russian Wikipedia article had been noted as \"a dry rundown of how Veyshnoria emerged\" before the article was deleted and redirected to the article on Zapad 2017.\n\nSome Belarusian businessmen were quick to monetize Veyshnoria by launching a Veyshnoria website and legally registering it as a gaming service. After Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko issued the decree which made cryptocurrencies a legal method of payment and the Taler cryptocurrency was launched in Belarus, Taler was made the official currency of Veyshnoria. .\n\nOnline \"Veyshnorians\" were quick to notice that the following famous persons have Veyshnorian descent:\n\n\n"}
