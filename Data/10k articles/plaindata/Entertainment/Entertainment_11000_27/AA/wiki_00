{"id": "9436505", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9436505", "title": "Anarky (comic book)", "text": "Anarky (comic book)\n\nAnarky was a short-lived American comic book series published by DC Comics, as a limited series between May and August of 1997, and as an ongoing series between May and December of 1999. It was written by Alan Grant, with pencils by Norm Breyfogle, and inks by Josef Rubinstein. The comic was a spin-off title derived from the \"Batman\" franchise, and followed the adventures of Anarky, an antagonist of the Batman character.\n\nAlthough Anarky had originally been created to reflect the philosophy of anarchism, the primary influence on both volumes was Neo-Tech, a philosophy developed by Frank R. Wallace. The comic was overtly political in nature, exploring a number of themes including antimilitarism, homelessness, and political corruption.\n\nFollowing the comic book industry crash of 1996, Norm Breyfogle was unemployed and looking for work. As a result of a request Breyfogle made to DC for employment, Darren Vincenzo, then an editorial assistant at DC Comics, suggested multiple projects which Breyfogle could take part in. Among his suggestions was an Anarky limited series, written by Grant, which was eventually the project decided upon.\n\nThe four-issue limited series, \"Anarky\", was published in May 1997. Entitled \"Metamorphosis\", the story maintained the character's anti-authoritarian sentiments, but was instead based on the philosophy of Neo-Tech, an offshoot of Objectivism.\n\nDuring the climax of the \"Anarky\" storyline of \"Batman: Shadow of the Bat\" #41-42, it is implied that Anarky dies in a large explosion. In turn, the \"Anarky\" limited series resolved this event by revealing that Anarky survives, but chooses to shed the encumbrance of his double life by faking his death. Anarky works in seclusion to further his goal of achieving a utopian society, briefly hiring Legs and other homeless men to monitor Batman's movements. He has several further brushes with Batman, as well as the likes of Etrigan and Darkseid.\n\nGrant has referred to the limited series as one of his favorite projects, and ranked it among his \"career highlights\".\n\nWith the success of the first \"Anarky\" series, Darren Vincenzo suggested continuing the book as an ongoing series to Breyfogle and Grant. Although Grant was concerned that such a series would not be viable, he agreed to write it at Breyfogle's insistence, as the illustrator was still struggling for employment. Grant's primary concerns centered on his belief that Anarky's role as a non-superpowered teenager was not capable of competing for reader attention when DC Comics already had a similar series in \"Robin\". Further, while potential disagreements with editors over story elements were not among his initial concerns, he eventually found himself constantly at odds with editors and editorial assistants throughout the creation of the series.\n\nDuring the \"Anarky\" series, much of the character's development was influenced by the nature of Grant and Breyfogle's association. As part of the story writing process, the duo would engage in philosophical discussion carried out entirely over fax-transmissions. These long, in-depth, and occasionally heated debates influenced plot points, as well as the general direction of Anarky's character development.\n\nScheduled for a release date of November 1998, the premiere issue was rescheduled for March 1999, to coincide with the creation of a trade paperback, \"\", to help promote the new series. Collecting several of the character's printed appearances, \"Batman: Anarky\" was released in February 1999. However, the release date for the second volume was then pushed back again to May. An unintended result of this constant rescheduling was the effect it had on Grant's efforts to plot early story lines for the series. Due to increasing time constraints for the approaching millennium, it prevented Grant from exploring potential plots involving the Y2K bug he discussed with Breyfogle. Grant also reported that the series was dogged by editorial restrictions, including demands that he include cameos for particular characters, or \"tone down\" the degree of philosophy of the series. One of the earliest of these editorial mandates was that Grant was ordered to completely rewrite the first three-issue story line, and remove Anarky from Gotham City in the first issue. This was achieved by explaining that following an Lonnie's parents disappear, their house is destroyed, and he is threatened by Batman to leave the city. As one of many refugees who escapes from No Man's Land, he relocates to a new base of operations beneath the Washington Monument. Extremely displeased with the forced approach in creating this justification, Grant later said, \"Reading over that I was not so happy with the way I’d written that because it didn’t make sense to me at the time and it doesn’t make sense now.\" These constant impositions on the part of editors nearly drove Grant to quit the series, but he continued the project for Breyfogle's benefit. \"I was all for walking away, but artist Norm had a mortgage and family, and basically needed the work.\"\n\nGrant's doubts concerning the comic's prospects eventually proved correct. The series was panned by critics, failed to catch on among readers, and was canceled after eight issues, however Grant has noted in an interview that it was popular in Spanish speaking countries, perhaps owing to a history of political repression in the region. \"It didn’t sit too well with American readers, who prefer the soap opera and cool costume aspects of superhero comics. But I became a minor hero in many Latin countries, like Argentina and Mexico, where readers had been subjected to tyranny and fascism and knew precisely what I was writing about.\"\n\nDespite numerous editorial impositions, the most controversial plot point was not a mandate, but was instead a suggestion by Breyfogle, intended as a means to expand Anarky's characterization: that Anarky's biological father be revealed to be the Joker. Breyfogle expressed an interest using the relationship as a source for internal conflict in the character. \"...I figured that because Anarky represents the epitome of reason, one of the biggest crises he could face would be to discover that his father was the exact opposite: a raving lunatic!\" Alternatively, Grant saw it as an opportunity to solidify Anarky's role in the Batman franchise. Grant's decision to pursue the suggestion ran into conflict with Dennis O'Neil, who protested against it.\n\nPressing forward, Grant wrote the Anarky series with the intention of allowing the storyline to play out over time. As the first issue narrates, Anarky begins a search for his missing parents in \"Anarky\" vol.2 #1, and comes upon evidence that the Machins are not his biological parents, that his mother is insane and that his father is a \"madman\". As revealed in \"Anarky\" vol.2 #8, his leads point to the possibility that his biological father is the Joker. He first meets his supposed biological mother, but finds that she is clinically unstable and unable to answer his questions. He then breaks into Arkham Asylum to confront the Joker himself, but is betrayed, as the Joker opportunistically attempts to escape from the Asylum without providing any firm answers.\n\nAs the last issue of the \"Anarky\" series, this unresolved ending left open the possibility that the Joker might be Anarky's actual father, and the planned \"rebuttal\" was never published. Further, Grant and Breyfogle later speculated that as Dennis O'Neil has retired from DC Comics, and the final editorial decision currently belongs to Dan DiDio, it is no longer possible to be sure whether a rebuttal will ever be published. As of 2010, there is yet no record of Didio ever commenting on the subject, though the DC Universe timeline chronologically prevents the Joker from being Anarky's biological father, as the character is (currently) approximately sixteen years old, while both Batman and the Joker have only existed for approximately thirteen years.\n\nAs Anarky was created while Grant and Breyfogle were operating under \"work-for-hire\" rules, DC Comics owns all rights to the Anarky character. Following the cancellation of the \"Anarky\" series, both men attempted to buy the rights to Anarky from the company, but their offer was declined.\n\nWhile Grant has commented that the first volume stands among his favorite works, he did not wish to create the ongoing series. Convinced by Norm Breyfogle to continue the series, he chafed under what he felt were excessive demands made by editors for specific plot changes, such as \"toning down\" Anarky's philosophy and including cameos for Superman, the Haunted Tank, and the Justice League.\n\nOne of the earliest of these was that Grant was \"made to\" remove Anarky from Gotham City. This was achieved by explaining that following an Lonnie's parents disappeared, their house was destroyed, and he was threatened by Batman to leave the city. As one of many refugees who escaped from No Man's Land, he relocated to a new base of operations beneath the Washington Monument.\n\nGrant considered abandoning the project, but continued it for Breyfogle's sake, as the illustrator was still struggling for employment.\n\nThe second volume was heavily criticized by reviewers and failed to catch on among readers, until it was announced in the seventh issue that it would be canceled due to poor sales following the eighth issue. At the time of cancellation, two issues had been fully written and illustrated, but remained unpublished. These were intended to include an encounter with Superman, a story arch set in East Timor, and a confrontation with Capital Eagle, a new antagonist for Anarky that had been created by Grant and introduced earlier that year. Despite poor sales in the US, Grant noted that it was popular among philosophy students and sold well in Latin American countries, particularly Mexico and Argentina, perhaps owing to a history of political repression in the region.\n\nThe story describes that Lonnie Machin narrowly survived an explosion which faked his death in \"\" #40 and 41 (July - August 1995). Several months later, he has begun a new plan to liberate the world of government. As Anarky, he attempts to create a device which will emit beams of light on frequencies which will trigger the human brain of all who see it. The people will then be \"de-brainwashed\" of all the social constraints which society has placed on the individual. Utilizing a makeshift teleportation device capable of summoning a boom tube, he begins a quest to capture the power sources the device will need: the madness of Etrigan, the evil of Darkseid, and the goodness of Batman. During the confrontation between Anarky and Batman, the device is damaged. Thus, when Machin activates it, it only affects himself. The vision that follows reveals what may have happened if he had succeeded, with nightmarish consequences. The conclusion of the story is that if society is to change, individuals must accept that change voluntarily. When Batman turns off the machine, Anarky awakens and promptly escapes, vowing to continue his mission, \"until they all learn to choose for themselves.\"\n\nTaking place during the \"No Man's Land\" story arc, sixteen-year-old Lonnie Machin, aka Anarky, is chased from the ruins of Gotham City by Batman, who refuses to face Anarky in a turf war over the city. With financial independence and technical genius, Anarky invents his new ally, MAX, an artificially intelligent computer, and uses his teleportation device and wealth to reestablish a secret base below the Washington Monument. He then begins a war against supervillains and the United States Government, while simultaneously searching for his parents, who disappeared in the aftermath of the \"\" story arc. During research, Anarky mathematically predicts the eventual appearance of an \"Aberration,\" an anomaly of physics that will destroy the planet, and steals a Green Lantern power ring to combat it. This draws the attention of Kyle Rayner, who attempts to regain the ring before teaming up with Anarky against the Aberration. Near the end, Anarky is nearly seduced by the power of the ring and tempted to keep it, but comes to the conclusion that \"power corrupts\" and opts to return it, only for the ring to be destroyed during the battle. As an epiloque, MAX uncovers evidence that the Machins adopted Lonnie as an infant, and that his real father is \"a madman.\" The mystery of the alleged father's identity becomes a recurring subplot of the series until the final issue.\n\nAnarky stumbles upon a black market transaction between a US senator and anonymous henchmen, and disrupts their meeting. He discovers that the senator was selling codes that revealed coordinates of bio-warfare factories in Iraq, and later that Ra's al Ghul was the buyer. The international terrorist's goal is to launch missiles against the factories from Israel, releasing clouds of deadly bacteria and sparking a war in the Middle East, the result of which would be a death toll in the millions. Ra's al Ghul eventually obtains the codes and launches his missiles. However, Anarky supplies him with the incorrect codes and the missiles land harmlessly over the desert. He then uses the Internet to alert the world to the plot, which results in the missile sites being discovered and destroyed by US warplanes. As an epilogue to the story, a secret meeting is held by key members of the federal government in the White House. The threat Anarky represents to the men attending is discussed, and it is decided that Mr. Staines, a mysterious figure employed by the federal government, would be charged with the task of neutralizing him. Mr. Staines suggests the use of Capital Eagle, a government employed superhuman, to defeat Anarky.\n\nA tie-in to the \"Day of Judgment\" crossover event, Anarky encounters The Haunted Tank and teams up with its crew to defeat an army of zombies rising from Arlington National Cemetery. Anarky also encounters various Founding Fathers in the process. The story carries a strong anti-war message, and ends when Anarky, demoralized by the sight of pointless fighting among men from every war in US history, refuses to fight and abandons the battlefield.\n\nTaking place after the \"No Man's Land\" story arc, Lonnie Machin decides to finally confront his supposed biological parents to uncover the truth of his lineage. He first meets with his alleged biological mother, Greta Mitchell, but finds that she is mentally unbalanced, due to the side effects of Joker venom she was exposed to years earlier. In a flashback, she tells the story of how she became pregnant by the Joker, and that due to her condition she was deemed unfit for parental responsibility and that her child was taken away from her. However, Lonnie is unable to get any more information from her. As a final recourse, Anarky breaks into Arkham Asylum using his teleporter and confronts his alleged father, now revealed to be the Joker. Meanwhile, the Joker is in the midst of a prison break with other inmates, and takes advantage of the situation to steal the teleporter, and then forces Anarky to participate. Unarmed, Anarky plays along until he manages to regain the teleporter to escape, without the Joker having given him any clear answers either. Although the story presents no evidence, Anarky asserts that he personally believes the Joker is his father, and fears that someday he may become insane as well.\n\n\nOriginally produced as a limited series, the first volume of \"Anarky\" utilized previously established characters to guest star in each issue.\n\nNew characters were introduced in the second volume with the intention that they would become regular cast members and receive more character development in future issues. However, due to the short run of the series, most of the original characters appeared in a limited number of scenes, with MAX being the only character to appear in every issue. Three characters – Roach, Mr. Stains, and Capital Eagle – were intended to appear in two unpublished issues.\n\nWhile previously the character Anarky had been described as an anarchist, both volumes were instead based on the philosophy of Neo-Tech, an offshoot of Objectivism. It is unique as the only mainstream comic book ever influenced by this philosophy.\n\nA recurring theme in the first volume included four scenes, at one page per issue, in which Anarky expounded philosophy to his pet dog, and indirectly for the reader, including explaining a bicameralism, the difference between Plato and Aristotle, the concept of economic \"parasites,\" and how the elimination of irrationality would allow society to advance. In an interview, Alan Grant explained that in the original script, these monologues were titled \"The History of Consciousness part 1 through 4\", and that Norm Breyfogle designed the illustrations so that a single quarter of a Circle-A would act as a backdrop to each, which when placed together created a complete poster image. This theme was not utilized in the second volume, but story narration continued to allude to these concepts. Bicameralism and philosophy of the mind remained a topic of concern to Grant while writing the series, which Grant hoped could act as a vehicle for his thoughts on the origin of consciousness. The comparison between Plato and Aristotle had been used in two earlier stories which featured Anarky, although at the time the character was described as an anarchist.\n\nSeveral of the issues contained strong anti-war messages, including issue #6. Near the conclusion of the \"War and Peace\" storyline, a brief scene is shown in which Lonnie Machin uses the internet to hold an instant messaging session with the public in which he debates the need for war, arguing that money and time used on military research would be better spent on agriculture to solve the global overpopulation crisis.\n\nThe series also introduced atheist leanings into the character's portrayal, coinciding with Grant's Neo-Tech philosophy.\n\nPolitical messages were also occasionally displayed in the backgrounds of scenes, as graffiti or fluttering newspapers displaying politically charged headlines which alluded to social problems, such as white collar crime, and homelessness. For his part, Norm Breyfogle believed that his role in producing the comic was merely that of artist, and so felt that his contribution to the comic's themes were minimal. Of them he expressed, \"(The series) was quite obviously subversive. But as an artist I was just drawing Alan’s stories. I wouldn’t say that I was being particularly subversive, although I was a bit when I put graffiti on the walls in the backgrounds.\n\nThe first volume of \"Anarky\", being a limited series, lacked a \"letters to the editor\" section for the comic. Instead, the end of each issue included a short list of books titled \"Alan Grant's Recommended Reading\". Each list included three books, for a total of 12 entries. The final list in issue #4 included a fourth entry for Neo-tech.com.\n\nThe twelve book entries are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4436145", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4436145", "title": "Apex (radio band)", "text": "Apex (radio band)\n\nApex radio stations (also known as skyscraper and pinnacle) was the name commonly given to a short-lived group of United States broadcasting stations, which were used to evaluate transmitting on frequencies that were much higher than the ones used by standard amplitude modulation (AM) and shortwave stations. Their name came from the tall height of their transmitter antennas, which were needed because coverage was primarily limited to local line-of-sight distances. These stations were assigned to what at the time were described as \"ultra-high\" frequencies, between roughly 25 and 44 MHz. They employed AM transmissions, although in most cases using a wider bandwidth than standard broadcast band AM stations, in order to provide high fidelity sound with less static and distortion.\n\nIn 1937 the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) formally allocated an Apex station band, consisting of 75 transmitting frequencies running from 41.02 to 43.98 MHz. These stations were never given permission to operate commercially, although they were allowed to retransmit the programming from standard AM stations. Most operated under experimental licenses, however this band was the first to include a formal \"non-commercial educational\" station classification. The FCC eventually decided there was no need for a second AM broadcast band, so the Apex station assignments were eliminated effective January 1, 1941. With this change, a few of the original Apex stations were converted into some of the earliest FM stations. \n\nThrough the 1920s and 1930s, radio engineers and government regulators were slowly determining the transmission characteristics of various frequencies being evaluated for use by radio stations. In the United States, by 1930 the original AM broadcasting band consisted of 96 frequencies from 550 to 1500 kHz, with a 10 kHz spacing between adjacent assignments. On this band, a station's coverage during the daytime consisted exclusively of its groundwave signal, which for the most powerful stations might exceed 200 miles (320 kilometers), although it was significantly less for the average station. However, during the nighttime, changes in the ionosphere resulted in additional long distance skywave signals, that were commonly reflected for up to hundreds of kilometers. \n\nOver time, the technology was developed to transmit on progressively higher frequencies. (Although initially these were in general called \"ultra-high\" frequencies, radio spectrum nomenclature was later standardized, with 3 to 30 MHz transmissions becoming known as \"High Frequency\" (HF), 30 to 300 MHz called \"Very High Frequency\" (VHF), and 300 to 3,000 MHz called \"Ultra High Frequency\" (UHF)). It soon became apparent that there were significant differences in the propagation characteristics of various frequency ranges. Signals from shortwave stations, operating roughly in the range from 5 MHz to 20 MHz, were found to be readily reflected by the ionosphere during both the day and at night, resulting in stations that sometimes could transmit halfway around the world. \n\nInvestigation of ever higher frequencies found that, above around 20 MHz, signal propagation by both groundwave and skywave generally became minimal, which meant that station coverage now began to be limited to just line-of-sight distances from the transmitting antenna. This was considered to be a valuable characteristic by the FCC, because it would allow the establishment of broadcasting stations with limited but consistent day and night coverage, that could only be received by their local communities. It also meant that multiple stations could operate on the same frequency throughout the country without interfering with each other.\n\nBecause the standard AM broadcast band was considered to be too full to allow any meaningful increase in the number of stations, the FCC began to issue licenses to parties interested in testing the suitability of higher frequencies. Most Apex stations operated under experimental licenses, and were commonly affiliated with and subsidized by a commercially licensed AM station. Until the late 1930s, commercially made radio receivers did not cover these high frequencies, so early Apex station listeners constructed their own receivers, or built converters for existing models.\n\nOn March 18, 1934, W8XH in Buffalo, New York, a companion station to AM station WBEN, became the first Apex station to air a regular schedule. Although most of these stations merely retransmitted the programs of their AM station partners, in a few cases efforts were made to provide original programming. In 1936, The Milwaukee Journal's W9XAZ, which initially had relayed the programming of WTMJ, became the first Apex station to originate its own programming on a regular basis. \n\nWhile monitoring the first group of stations, it was soon realized that, due to the strengthening of the ionosphere during periods of high solar activity, at times the lower end of the VHF frequencies would produce strong, and undesirable, skywave signals. (The December 1937 issue of \"All-Wave Radio\" reported that W6XKG in Los Angeles, transmitting on 25.95 MHz, had been heard in both Asia and Europe, while W9XAZ, 26.4 MHz in Milwaukee, Wisconsin had \"a strong signal in Australia\", and W8XAI, 31.6 MHz in Rochester, New York, \"is another station that is often heard in Australia.\") This most commonly occurred during the summer months, and during peaks in the 11-year sunspot cycle. This determination led to the FCC moving the developing broadcasting service stations, which by now began to include experimental FM and TV stations, to higher frequencies that were less affected by solar influences.\n\nIn October 1937, the FCC announced a sweeping allocation of frequency assignments for the various competing services, including television, relay, and public service, which covered 10 kHz to 300 MHz. Included was a band of Apex stations, consisting of 75 channels with 40 kHz separations, and spanning from 41.02 to 43.98 MHz. The 40 kHz spacing between adjacent frequencies was four times as much as the 10 kHz spacing on the standard AM broadcast band, which reduced adjacent-frequency interference, and provided more bandwidth for high-fidelity programming.\n\nAt the time it was estimated that there were about 50 Apex-style stations currently in operation, although transmitting on a variety of frequencies. In January 1938 the band's first 25 channels, from 41.02 to 41.98 MHz, were reserved for non-commercial educational stations, with the Cleveland City Board of Education's WBOE in Cleveland, Ohio the first station to begin operation within this group.\n\nAt the time the Apex band was established, the FCC noted that \"The Commission at an early date will consider carefully the needs and requirements for high-frequency broadcast stations using both conventional [AM] modulation and frequency modulation\". As of January 15, 1940, only 2 non-commercial and 14 experimental stations held Apex band licenses, all of which were assigned operating frequencies in the bottom half of the band. (A similar number of experimental stations held grants for frequencies in the 25-26 MHz region.) In addition, at this same time 20 experimental FM stations had been assigned slots within the top half of the Apex band frequencies.\n\nThe commission's studies soon found significant advantages to FM transmissions over the Apex AM signals. Sound quality, and especially resistance to interference from static, including from lightning, was found to be far superior for FM. Although FM assignments required five times the bandwidth of Apex stations (200 kHz vs. 40 kHz), the \"capture effect\" allowed FM stations operating on the same frequency to be spaced closer together than Apex stations. By 1939 the FCC began encouraging Apex stations to consider changing to the technically superior FM transmissions. In 1940, the FCC decided to authorize a commercial FM band effective January 1, 1941, operating on 40 channels spanning 42–50 MHz (this was later changed to 88–106 MHz, and still later to 88–108 MHz.)\n\nThis new assignment also resulted in the elimination of the Apex band, and the Apex stations were informed that they needed to either go silent or convert to FM. The last of the Apex stations to leave the air were WBOE, which shut down its Apex operation in February 1941 and converted to FM that month, and WBKY, which suspended operations after June 27, 1941 due to financial reasons. Currently, the frequencies that had been used by the Apex band are allocated for land mobile communication.\n\nThere would be at least one attempt to revive the Apex band concept. Beginning in May 1946, consulting radio engineer Sarkes Tarzian operated a 200-watt experimental AM station, W9XHZ, on 87.75 MHz in Bloomington, Indiana. After two years of successful operation of what he referred to as his \"HIFAM\" station, in 1948 he proposed that the FCC allocate a small high-frequency broadcast band, 400 kHz wide with 10 kHz spacing between frequency assignments. Tarzian promoted this as a low-cost alternative to expensive FM transmitters and receivers, saying that a $5.95 converter could be added to existing AM radios that would allow them to pick up the HIFAM stations. He continued to operate his experimental station, which eventually became KS2XAP, until 1950, although by then its transmitting hours were greatly restricted, as the FCC required the station to remain off the air whenever nearby WFBM-TV in Indianapolis was broadcasting. This was due to the fact that the TV station's audio transmitter used the same frequency as Tarzian's station. Moreover, after his station's final license expired on June 1, 1950 the FCC denied Tarzian any further renewals, concluding it would not reverse its earlier determination that there was no need for a second AM broadcast band.\n\n"}

Hattie decides to get out of the car and walk, but changes (she says \"shanged\") her mind.\n\nWhile driving, Madea accidentally hits one of Derrick's daughters with her car when she mysteriously appears on the road; the gang argue over who will get out of the car and check on the little girl. Madea goes, and Bam and Hattie reluctantly follow. The little girl is crying. Madea says that they must go check on her, but Bam and Hattie are afraid to go check, but do so anyway. She pulls her hair and shows her face, which has scars, cuts, to everybody. The ladies run back to the car and Joe decides to drive. The little girl appears on top of the car, scaring everyone again, and Joe immediately drives away.\n\nBack at Lake Derrick, Tiffany, Gabriella, Leah, and the remaining frat boys are at the campfire discussing the murders that happened in the area but Gabriella doesn't want to hear this and insist on leaving. They soon realize that some people from the party are missing, so Horse and Leah agree to look for them, but they actually want to get away to have sex. \"Derrick\" and his family chase them into the woods; running for their lives they trip and fall, giving \"Derrick\" a chance to grab Horse and drag him away from Leah. Leah says she'll get help but Horse is presumably \"killed.\" Leah runs out of the forest and sees Madea and the gang waiting for the Cadillac to stop smoking so she waits with them until Bam sees a \"grim reaper\" standing in the middle of the road. Everyone except Madea is afraid; Madea thinks the frat boys are pranking them so she confronts him. She touches his scythe and gets a cut on her hand. She tries to touch his face, but when she just feels air she goes back to the car. The Grim Reaper follows and slashes one of the Cadillac's tires, but Joe continues to drive it anyway.\n\nGabriella reluctantly seeks safety in a tent with Dino, a frat brother who had been flirting with her all night, but they discover \"Derrick\" and his daughters outside the tent. In another tent Tiffany hooks up with Jonathan until \"Derrick\" tears down the tent. Tiffany, Gabriella, Jonathan, and Dino escape from the camp after Tiffany tries unsuccessfully to call her mom. Madea's group finally arrive at Lake Derrick, but the camp is empty. In the car Joe flirts with Leah until she run away after seeing Derrick's daughter at the car, and Joe makes rude comments to the little girl. While they are looking for Tiffany, Madea and Hattie go to an outhouse where Hattie relieves herself. Madea waits, but Derrick appears out of the river and she runs away. Hattie also runs away when the little girl appears and tries to grab her.\n\nAt the police station Debrah and Calvin desperately ask the sheriff to check for Tiffany at Lake Derrick but Brian shows up and tells Debrah that he will go look for her with his friend Victor, Gabriella's dad. Madea's car stops in front of a old broken-down house. Madea, Bam, and Hattie run into the house when they see the little girl who tells Joe that \"Derrick\" wants to talk him about the rude comments he made earlier. Joe goes to the chainsaw killer, but Joe runs away from him. Madea, Bam, and Hattie discover that Tiffany, Jonathan, Gabriella, Leah, and Dino are hiding in the house from Derrick too and think the adults are pranking them. At the window Madea, Bam, and Hattie think Joe is dead when they see \"Derrick\" and his brother drag him away so they try to come up with a plan to save everyone but the ladies argue until the little girl reappears, scaring everyone out of the house. Brian and Victor are waiting for them - they had been pranking them for lying and sneaking out, and for Debrah to learn to co-parent. Debrah agrees, and the people who were \"killed\" are found at the police station. However, the masked chainsaw killer at the outhouse wasn't part of the prank; he is the actual Derrick. When Brian and Victor realize this, they drive away from the camp. Joe then appears and it appears that he befriended the chainsaw killer. He then asks if he can help him kill Madea and he responds yes. After the screen cuts to black, a blooper reel appears.\n\n\nPrincipal photography on \"Boo 2! A Madea Halloween\" began in March 2017 in Atlanta, Georgia. The movie apparently cost 25 million dollars to make. Lionsgate released a teaser trailer for the film on July 18, 2017, and a full trailer on August 18.\n\nIn May 2017, Lionsgate announced the film would be released on October 20, 2017. It was released on DVD and Blu-ray on January 30, 2018.\n\n\"Boo 2! A Madea Halloween\" grossed $47.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $1 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $48.3 million, against a production budget of $25 million.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, \"Boo 2! A Madea Halloween\" was released alongside \"Geostorm\", \"The Snowman\" and \"Only The Brave\", and was expected to gross $20–25 million from 2,388 theaters in its opening weekend. The film made $760,000 from Thursday night previews and $7.5 million on its first day. It went on to open to $21.7 million (down 24% from the first film's $27.6 million debut), becoming the 10th Tyler Perry film to finish first at the box office. Like typical Perry films, the opening weekend audience demographics were diverse: 38% African American, 31% Caucasians and 21% Hispanics. In its second week the film dropped 52% to $10.1 million (more than the 39.6% of the first film), finishing second behind newcomer \"Jigsaw\" ($16.6 million) and in its third week the film made $4.7 million (dropping another 53%), finishing 4th at the box office.\n\nOn review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 6% based on 16 reviews, with an average rating of 2.9/10. On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 17 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating \"overwhelming dislike\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A–\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it a 73% overall positive score.\n\n"}
{"id": "1384988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1384988", "title": "Coopetition", "text": "Coopetition\n\nCoopetition or co-opetition (sometimes spelled \"coopertition\" or \"co-opertition\") is a neologism coined to describe cooperative competition. Coopetition is a portmanteau of cooperation and competition. Basic principles of co-opetitive structures have been described in game theory, a scientific field that received more attention with the book \"Theory of Games and Economic Behavior\" in 1944 and the works of John Forbes Nash on non-cooperative games. Coopetition occurs both at inter-organizational or intra-organizational levels.\n\nGiovanni Battista Dagnino and Giovanna Padula's conference paper (2002) is considered a pioneering contribution. They conceptualized that, at inter-organisational level, coopetition occurs when companies interact with partial congruence of interests. They cooperate with each other to reach a higher value creation if compared to the value created without interaction and struggle to achieve competitive advantage. Often coopetition takes place when companies that are in the same market work together in the exploration of knowledge and research of new products, at the same time that they compete for market-share of their products and in the exploitation of the knowledge created. In this case, the interactions occur simultaneously and in different levels in the value chain. This is the case in the arrangement between PSA Peugeot Citroën and Toyota to share components for a new city car—simultaneously sold as the Peugeot 107, the Toyota Aygo, and the Citroën C1, where companies save money on shared costs while remaining fiercely competitive in other areas. Several advantages can be foreseen, as cost reductions, resources complementarity and technological transfer. Some difficulties also exist, as distribution of control, equity in risk, complementary needs and trust. It is possible for more than two companies to be involved in coopetition with one another. Another possible case for coopetition is joint resource management in construction. Sadegh Asgari and his colleagues (2013) present a short-term partnering case in which construction contractors form an alliance, agreeing to put all or some of their resources in a joint pool for a fixed duration of time and to allocate the group resources using a more cost-effective plan. Sadegh Asgari, Abbas Afshar and Kaveh Madani (2013) suggested cooperative game theory as the basis for fair and efficient allocation of the incremental benefits of cooperation among the cooperating contractors. Their study introduced a new paradigm in construction resource planning and allocation. Contractors no longer see each other as just competitors; They look for cooperation beyond their competition in order to reduce their costs. \n\nAt the intra-organizational level, coopetition occurs between individuals or functional units within the same organization. Based on game theory and social interdependence theories, some studies investigate the presence of simultaneous cooperation and competition among functional units, the antecedents of coopetition, and its impact on knowledge sharing behaviors. For example, the concept of coopetitive knowledge sharing is developed to explain mechanisms through which coopetition influences effective knowledge sharing practices in cross-functional teams. The underlying argument is that while organizational teams need to cooperate, they are likely to experience tension caused by diverse professional philosophies and competing goals from different cross-functional representatives.\n\nThe word \"coopetition\" and its variants have been re-coined several times:\n\n\n\n\n"}

The word in this sense comes from the term ' (descant \"above the book\"), and is a form of Gregorian chant in which only the melody is notated but an improvised polyphony is understood. The ' had specific rules governing the improvisation of the additional voices.\n\nLater on, the term came to mean the treble or soprano singer in any group of voices, or the higher pitched line in a song. Eventually, by the Renaissance, descant referred generally to counterpoint. Nowadays the counterpoint meaning is the most common.\n\nDescant can also refer to the highest pitched of a group of instruments, particularly the descant viol or recorder. Similarly, it can also be applied to the soprano clef. Descant can also refer to a high, florid melody sung by a few sopranos as a decoration for a hymn.\n\nHymn tune descants are counter-melodies, generally at a higher pitch than the main melody.\n\nAlthough the English Hymnal of 1906 did not include descants, this influential hymnal, whose music editor was Ralph Vaughan Williams, served as a source of tunes for which the earliest known hymn tune descants were published. These were in collections compiled by Athelstan Riley, who wrote \"The effect is thrilling; it gives the curious impression of an ethereal choir joining in the worship below; and those who hear it for the first time often turn and look up at the roof!\"\n\nAmong composers of descants during 1915 to 1934 were Alan Gray, Geoffrey Shaw, and Ralph Vaughan Williams. Several of their descants appear in what is possibly the earliest hymnal to include descants, \"Songs of Praise\" (London: Oxford University Press, 1925, enlarged, 1931, reprinted 1971).\n\nDuring the last quarter of the twentieth century, new editions of hymnals increased the number of included descants. For example, the influential \"Hymnal 1940\" (Episcopal) contains no descants, whereas its successor, \"The Hymnal 1982\", contains 32. Among other currently used hymnals, \"The Worshiping Church\" contains 29 descants; \"The Presbyterian Hymnal\", 19; \"The New Century Hymnal\", 10; \"Chalice Hymnal\", 21. The Vocal Descant Edition for \"Worship, Third Edition\" (GIA Publications, 1994) offers 254 descants by such composers as Donald Busarow, John Ferguson, Richard Hillert, Robert Hobby, Hal Hopson, David Hurd, Austin Lovelace, Ronald Nelson, Sam Batt Owens, Robert Powell, Richard Proulx, William P. Rowan, Carl Schalk, Randall Sensmeier, Scott Withrow, and Michael Young.\n\n\n"}

He is the fifth of eight children in an Iraqi-Jewish family. His father, Huji, was a tailor and his mother, Ungel, was a nanny.\n\nWhile he attended the vocational school, Kadoorie Agricultural High School in the Lower Galilee in the early 1980s, he became known for his impressions and high jinks especially for coming into school dressed as Antiochus on random occasions. His schoolmates nicknamed him, \"juha\". After graduating, he was drafted into the Israel Defense Forces first into a course for quartermasters because they didn't believe him when he said that he could sing. Luckily for him he was moved to the \"mafhash\" (Hebrew: מפח\"ש) entertainment troop (along with later to be Israeli celebrities such as Hanan Goldblatt and Orna Datz, then known as Orna Cohen).\n\nHis first television appearance was in the Israeli children's science fiction mini-series \"Hatsatskanim\" (1989) which was broadcast on the Israeli educational channel. he played the role of the alien \"Shemesh\", the technician of the rocketship.\n\nIn 1990 he appeared in the entertainment show \"Motzash\" (Saturday night) in Channel 1 helped earn Yatzpan a little bit of name recognition but when in 1992 he joined Yigal Shilon's hidden camera show, \"Fisfusim\" () on Reshet Channel 2 (Israel) he exploded on screen playing many different characters, tricked many people in Israel and abroad and gained celebrity status in Israel.\n\nBetween the years 1996 and 1997 Yatzpan hosted his own entertainment night show on Friday nights on Channel 2 in which he interviewed celebrity guests. Between the years 1998 and 1999 Yatzpan's night show moved to Saturday nights and was remade to include more skits (which most of them he performed without any help from other actors). Between the years 2001 until 2006 he hosted his own night show on Channel 3 for which he received many awards.\n\nIn 2007 he started hosting his own night show on Channel 2 called \"Shalom and Good Evening\".\n\nIn 1988, Yatzpan landed a role in the movie \"Fictional Marriage\" (), where he played Bashir, an Arab waiter. After that Yatzpan played in several films such as \"Ehad MiShelanu\" (One of Us) (1989), \"Max VeMorris\" (Max and Morris) (1994) and (1994)\n\nAfter discharge, he joined a Jewish performance tour of the United States. When he arrived back, he joined an acting group and auditioned for various acting roles at Tel-Aviv's famous Habima theatre.\n\nIn 1990, he appeared with Sefi Rivlin in the theatre show \"My wife, a choice of fine\" (אשתי, ברירת קנס). By the mid-1990s he raised an entertainment with Meir Suisa called \"Suisa VeYatspan first\" (סוויסה ויצפאן תחילה). In 1999 they performed in a new show called \"Suisa VeYatspan, second pulsation\" (סוויסה ויצפאן, פעימה שנייה).

{"id": "56453934", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56453934", "title": "Ernst Ruhmer", "text": "Ernst Ruhmer\n\nErnst Walter Ruhmer (April 15, 1878—April 8, 1913) was a German physicist. He was best known for investigating practical applications making use of the light-sensitivity properties of selenium, which he employed in developing wireless telephony using line-of-sight optical transmissions, sound-on-film audio recording, and television transmissions over wires.\n\nRuhmer's father was an inventor and manufacturer. From 1897 to 1900 he studied mathematics and natural sciences in Berlin, and the next year continued his studies in Giessen. His early work included extensive research in developing selenium cells that were more sensitive, and faster reacting, to the effects of light illumination. In December 1902 he and Salomon Kalischer were issued German patent 151,971 for their method of producing photographic images by exposing electrically conductive selenium-coated plates. Ruhmer also designed a light-sensitive control switch, using a selenium cell, which was successfully used to automatically turn off the flow of a buoy's illuminating gas during daylight hours. In 1904 he established a private physics laboratory, located in southwest Berlin.\n\nRuhmer first gained widespread recognition for his work on improvements to Alexander Graham Bell's optical wireless telephone, the photophone. Bell introduced this device in 1880, which used selenium cells in the receiver to convert the fluctuating light produced by the transmitting unit into sounds. But Bell's invention only had a range of a few hundred meters, and he soon ended his research into this device. Ruhmer believed that the increased sensitivity of his selenium cells, combined with the superior receiving capabilities of professor H. T. Simon's \"speaking arc\", would make the photophone practical over longer signalling distances.\n\nRuhmer carried out a series of experimental transmissions along the Havel river and on Lake Wannsee from 1901 to 1902. He reported achieving sending distances under good conditions of 15 kilometers (9 miles), with equal success during the day and at night, although the longest transmissions were dependent on having clear weather. He continued his experiments around Berlin through 1904, in conjunction with the German Navy, which supplied high-powered searchlights for use in the transmissions. \n\nRuhmer also carried out research in making audio transmissions using radio signals. In 1904, he was granted, along with Adolf Pieper, German patent 173,396, \"A Process for Generating Permanently Undamped Electrical Oscillations\", which described a method for creating \"continuous wave\" transmissions using a mercury-vapor vacuum-tube.\n\nIn 1904 he developed a high-speed alternator which produced transmitting frequencies of up to 120,000 cycles-per-second. However, this effort never got beyond a basic prototype that generated less than .001 watt.\nRuhmer also investigated radiotelephone transmissions using a high-frequency spark transmitter. This work took place during winter 1904-5, however, this approach had limited results, as he later noted that \"the transmitted speech received on microphonic contact and telephone was rough and broken like that of a stammerer\".\n\nIn 1906, employing a design largely based on the hydrogen arc transmitter developed by Denmark's Valdemar Poulsen, he reported that he had constructed a transmitter capable of producing frequencies up to 300,000 cycles-per-second. Although the quality of the resulting audio transmissions were \"strikingly good\", and he felt that transmission range could be extended to several kilometers, these tests were only conducted over a distance of 500 meters.\n\nRuhmer also investigated carrier current transmissions (then commonly known as \"wired wireless\"), where multiple radio signals are transmitted along an electrical conductor, which acts as a wave guide carrying the signals to designated locations. In 1911, it was reported that during a recent demonstration, \"four transmissions—German, French, song and gramophone music respectively—were effected simultaneously, but the number can obviously be increased considerably without any disturbance\".\n\nIn 1907 Ruhmer wrote \"Drahtlose Telephonie\", which was translated by James Erskine-Murray and published in 1908 as \"Wireless Telephony In Theory and Practice\". This book reviewed the various technologies being investigated for wireless telephony, including both optical telephone research and the newer radiotelephone developments. Radio transmissions were soon recognized to be superior for most applications, as they were unaffected by weather, and were not limited to line-of-sight transmissions.\n\nIn 1900, as part of his optical wireless telephone research, Ruhmer recorded the fluctuations of the transmitting arc-light as varying shades of light and dark bands onto a continuous roll of photographic film. He then determined that he could reverse the process and reproduce the recorded sound from this photographic strip, by shining a bright light through the running filmstrip, with the resulting varying light illuminating a selenium cell. The changes in brightness caused a corresponding change in the selenium's resistance to electrical currents, which was used to modulate the sound produced in a telephone receiver. He summarized the results as: \"It is truly a wonderful process: sound becomes electricity, becomes light, causes chemical actions, becomes light and electricity again, and finally sound.\" He called this invention the photographophone. The general concept would eventually be adopted for producing sound movies.\n\nRuhmer also researched using selenium cells as the picture elements for a television receiver. In late 1909 he successfully demonstrated in Belgium the transmission of simple images over a telephone wire from the Palace of Justice at Brussels to the city of Liege, a distance of 115 kilometers (72 miles). This demonstration was described at the time as \"the world's first working model of television apparatus\". However, his device consisted of only 25 cells, thus was only capable of representing simple geometric shapes. Ruhmer was confident that producing a system capable of higher definition images \"was only a matter of money\". However, at the cost of £15 (US$45) per selenium cell, he estimated that a 4,000 cell system would cost £60,000 (US$180,000), and a 10,000 cell mechanism capable of reproducing \"a scene or event requiring the background of a landscape\" would cost £150,000 (US$450,000). Because of the high cost, he didn't foresee his device as suitable for private home use, instead envisioning that central offices in major cities could be established, and customers would make arrangements to make use of the service.\n\nRuhmer expressed the hope that the 1910 Brussels \"Exposition Universelle et Internationale\" would sponsor the construction of an advanced device with significantly more cells, as a showcase for the exposition. However, the estimated expense of £250,000 (US$750,000) proved to be too high. Also, television research turned to using cathode ray tubes in receivers as a superior approach.\n\nRuhmer's promising career was eventually cut short. He fell ill in 1912, and died the next year at the age of 34.\n\n"}

In 2013, with the collapse of Blockbuster, it became the only remaining video rental chain in the United States.\n\nIn 1946, Clarence Hoogland founded Midstates Appliance and Supply Company. His son Charles Hoogland inherited the business in 1953. The company later became a distributor for Magnetic Video. After getting stuck with a large inventory of excess video movies in the late 1970s, Charles had the idea to start the Video Movie Club in Springfield, Illinois in 1978. The club originally charged a $25 membership fee and $5 per rental and later evolved into Family Video.\n\nBecause Blockbuster's main focus was larger cities, Family Video decided to establish themselves mostly in rural areas, suburbs, and small and midsize cities instead.\n\nIn 2003, Family Video relocated its headquarters from Springfield to Glenview, Illinois.

Depending on the type and size of band, the guitar tech may be responsible for stringing, tuning, and adjusting electric guitars and acoustic guitars, and maintaining and setting up guitar amplifiers and other related electronic equipment such as effect pedals.\n\nOnce the guitar equipment has been set up onstage, the guitar tech does a soundcheck to ensure that the equipment is working well. If there are any problems, the guitar tech replaces or repairs the faulty components or equipment. Since guitar techs need to soundcheck the instruments and amplifiers, they must have basic guitar-playing skills, a musical \"ear\" for tuning, and a familiarity with the way guitars, amplifiers, and effect pedals are supposed to sound in the style of music of their band. \n\nGuitar techs learn their craft either \"on the job\", by working in a range of music, sound engineering, and instrument repair jobs; by completing a guitar repair program at a college or lutherie school; or from a combination of these two routes. The salaries and conditions of work for guitar techs vary widely, depending on whether a guitar tech is working for a minor or regional touring bar band or a major international touring act.\n\nThe duties of a guitar technician depend on the type of band they are working for, and on a range of other factors such as the size and nature of the stage show and the length of the show. Guitar technicians who work for an acoustic band, such as a folk group or bluegrass ensemble may be responsible for setting up and stringing, and tuning a range of stringed, fretted instruments including acoustic guitars, dobros, and mandolins. A guitar tech for a heavy metal band, on the other hand, may focus mainly on electric guitars, guitar amplifiers, and effects pedals. A guitar tech may change the sequence of effects pedals or alter the settings on effects pedals during the show, to assist the guitarist in creating different tone colours or sounds. For example, a guitarist may ask the guitar tech to connect a chorus effect and reverb before a guitar solo. In an indie rock band, a guitar technician would likely configure the equipment to evoke through tone a modern yet historically evocative sound. In an acid rock band, a guitar tech might have to manipulate the controls on a ring modulator or a rotating Leslie speaker cabinet to create unusual sounds while the guitarist is performing.\nOnce the guitars have been tuned with an electronic tuner and strummed to ensure that they are in tune, the guitar tech usually sets up the different guitars on guitar racks, ensures that the leather or nylon straps are properly connected, and that the patch cords are plugged in properly. During the show, the guitar tech hands instruments to the guitarist or guitarists according to the types of guitar that are required in the songs that they are playing. For example, a hard rock guitarist may use a \"flying-V\" guitar for a fast song, and then switch to an acoustic 12-string guitar for a soft ballad. The guitar tech retunes all of the instruments before they are used, because even if an instrument was perfectly in tune during the soundcheck, the heat from stage lights and the humidity from the stage conditions may render the instrument slightly out of tune. \n\nAfter each guitar is used, the guitar tech cleans the strings with a cloth and replaces the instrument on a rack. During the show, the tech stands ready to replace any guitars in case a string breaks or if there is an equipment malfunction. The guitar tech may hand fresh towels to the guitarist so that the guitarist can remove sweat from the hands and ensure that the guitarist has ready access to bottles of cool water or other wet beverages. If a guitar technician is working for a guitarist who uses picks, the guitar tech may lay out a variety of picks on a guitar amplifier or tape the picks to the mic stands with double-sided tape, so that they are within easy reach. At the end of the show, the guitar tech disconnects all of the patch cords, cleans the instruments and puts them back into their cases.\n\nThe guitar tech also might perform any of a variety of maintenance tasks, such as checking that the string height of the guitars is set properly, modifying (\"dressing\") the height and arc of the frets, adjusting the intonation of the instruments, checking that tubes (valves) on tube amplifiers are working properly, and that cables are in good condition and free from crackles and hum caused by nicks and abrasions in the shielding or cable insulation. Techs also check the batteries on \"outboard\" devices — effects boxes, tuners, and pre-amps — and wireless transmitters, and change them as necessary. Depending on the size of a band's road crew, the guitar tech may either do this maintenance him- or herself, or, in a large touring act, delegate tasks to more-junior personnel.\n\nThe guitar tech does a basic soundcheck with the different guitars, amplifiers, and effects, to ensure that the equipment is functioning properly and that all of the connections between the equipment (which are made with patch cords) are plugged in correctly. This may be as simple as plugging an electric guitar into an amplifier or plugging an acoustic guitar into a DI box and preamp/equalizer. On the other hand, a tech may have to set up ten or more electric guitars, a variety of amplifiers, and connect them to an intricate sequence of effects pedals. \n\nWhen all of the instruments and equipment are set up and soundchecked, if there are problems — crackles, hum, no signal from the guitar, no sound from an amplifier — the tech may have responsibility for troubleshooting to determine the cause or causes. Common problems include damaged patch cords, ground loops in connection between instruments and amplifiers, weak batteries in effects boxes or on-board preamps, bad vacuum tubes in tube amplifiers or overdrive effects, broken electrical connectors or solder joints, speaker voice coils damaged from the previous concert, or equipment damaged during transport. Tuning problems may come from old or dirty strings, damaged or worn machine heads or frets, or mis-adjusted bridges.\n\nA guitar tech is often a \"jack of all trades,\" expected to make simple repairs: resolder a loose wiring connection inside a guitar, replace an amplifier tube, swap out a damaged speaker for a new one, reglue a loose part on an acoustic guitar, or adjust a truss rod. In cases where there is either not enough time to make the repair, or if the equipment is damaged beyond repair, the guitar tech is may be responsible for finding a replacement instrument or part, either by purchasing or renting it from a local music store or by borrowing it from another band. While another member of the road crew may be dispatched to pick up an item, the tech usually writes down which models or brands are acceptable replacements.\n\nOn rare occasions, guitar technicians may be asked to fill in for the guitarist they are teching for.\n\nThe conditions of work for guitar techs vary widely. Some guitar techs for small touring acts may set up guitars for all of the stringed-instrument performers—rhythm guitar, lead guitar, bass, and so on; they may even take on a large variety of tasks beyond guitar tech work, such as helping to set up sound equipment or soundcheck the microphones. On the other hand, guitar techs for major touring bands may be part of a large road crew team that includes amplifier technicians, guitar technicians for each guitarist (rhythm guitarist and lead guitarist), and a variety of people who set up the stage equipment. In a major touring band, a guitar tech's duties might be more narrowly circumscribed. They might only have to set up the guitars for a single performer, and there might be other staff who set up and maintain the amplifiers, effects, and guitar stands, and electronics technicians who solder and repair connections and wiring.\n\nThe salary, benefits, and accommodations of guitar techs vary widely. The first jobs that a guitar tech does may be on a volunteer basis in a garage band or amateur group, to gain experience, or alternatively the guitar tech might work in return for a small cash payment that is more of a symbolic honorarium than a real salary. In regional-level bar bands or minor touring acts, the guitar techs may be paid on a contractual basis during the weeks or months that the group is on tour, and there may not be health or dental benefits. A guitar tech working for this type of band must find other work to fill in months when the band is not on tour. On the other hand, a major touring act may hire a guitar technician as a permanent employee and provide them with a range of benefits. \n\nAccommodations depend on conditions set out in the contract, and the level and status of the group. A guitar tech traveling with a regional-level band may stay in inexpensive motels and receive a modest per diem for restaurant meals. A guitar tech traveling with a major touring band, however, may stay at the same first-class hotels as the star performers and eat catered buffet or restaurant meals. Some bands with substantial road crews may have their own catering crew. Guitar techs for the most famous international guitarists such as Jimmy Page or Tony Iommi can become minor celebrities within the guitar fan community because of their proximity to famous musicians and insider knowledge of how a certain guitarist's unique tone is created.\n\nGuitar technicians must have a broad knowledge of the musical equipment used in the types of bands they work with. At a minimum, this must consist of familiarity with setting up and tuning guitars and making simple adjustments and repairs. As well, guitar techs are often expected to set up, repair, and adjust electronic effects, tuners, pre-amplifiers, amplifiers, and pedalboards. To do these tasks, guitar techs must know about a range of audio engineering and electronics concepts—such as impedance, signal phase (for speakers and microphone wiring), and input voltage for pre-amps and effects. To do simple repairs on electronic gear, a guitar tech may have to know how to use a soldering iron and a multitester, and how to do basic electronics troubleshooting.\n\nAs well, since guitar techs need to soundcheck the instruments and amplifiers, they must have a knowledge of the way guitars and amplifiers are supposed to sound in the style of music of the band. This means that the guitar tech must have an ear for music, and for musical tones and sounds. A guitar tech for a heavy metal band must be able to tell whether distortion from a heavily over-driven tube amp is desirable tube clipping or distortion from a blown speaker or damaged power amp. The distinctions a guitar tech must make can be subtle. For example, a guitar tech replacing a blown tube with a new one may have to ensure that the tube amplifier still has the same \"color\" or \"warmth\" when chords are played through it.\n\nTo check guitar tuning, a guitar tech must be able to play major, minor, and other chords in a variety of keys. Even if the guitar has been tuned with an electronic tuner, the tuning still must be checked by ear, because the equal tempered tuning of a guitar can involve compromise. Guitar tuning can be affected by fret placement and wear, the angle of bridge angle, string age, and other factors. Thus, even if an electronic tuner indicates that a guitar is 100% \"in tune,\" it may still need minor adjustments which are made by ear. \n\nThe training of guitar technicians varies widely. Some guitar technicians have studied music, guitar repair, amplifier maintenance, or electronics repair in college or university. On the other hand, some techs learned these skills informally on the job, or by working their way up through the ranks in a range of musical jobs, from a roadie and sound engineer to a sideman in a bar band. Guitar techs trained on the job may learn their skills by playing in amateur or semi-professional bands as a guitarist or bassist, working for music stores as a guitar repairperson, for clubs or bars as a sound engineer, or by maintaining equipment for PA system rental companies. \n\nA typical career path for becoming a guitar technician via on the job training is to begin by volunteering in a bar band and then working for low wages in a regional touring act or a minor touring act. As they gain experience and add skills, they may seek out better-paying jobs with higher-status touring bands. Once a guitar technician has joined the road crew of a major touring act, they may seek out promotions within this organization, to jobs with greater responsibilities and higher pay. For example, a guitar tech who works as an assistant technician could try to get promoted to a guitar technician for the lead guitarist. A guitar tech who completes a guitar repair program at a college or lutherie school may be able to enter midway up the guitar tech career ladder.\n\nIn the early part of a guitar tech's career, there might be a great deal of mobility between different types of bands and technician roles. While working for minor or regional acts, a guitar tech may be able to work for a country rock bar band and then immediately switch to being the bass tech for a hard rock tribute band, because the tasks are fairly uniform. Career mobility of guitar technicians tends to become more constrained, though, when guitar techs begin to get jobs with high-status professional touring acts from specific genres. When a regional bar band looks for a guitar tech for a summer nightclub tour, there may many guitar techs who could meet the skill requirements. However, if an internationally-known 1960s-style acid rock touring act with a celebrity lead guitarist goes on a major tour, there may be only a handful of guitar techs who have the unique combination of skills for this position.\n\nBass guitar technicians (or \"bass techs\") perform the same functions for a bass guitar player. The bass guitar is a variety of electric guitar pitched below a regular electric guitar, typically by one octave. Many basic elements of the two types of instruments are similar enough—magnetic pickups routed to an electronic amplifier—that a guitar technician is usually able to work as a bass guitar technician if they become familiar with the unique aspects of the electric bass. The electric bass differs from the electric guitar in several respects. To become a bass tech, a person must learn how to set up the string action (height) and adjust the height of the pickups so that the bassist is able to create the tones associated with different bass styles. Depending on the band, these styles might include such as slap and pop, tapping, or upright bass-style playing with the thumb. \n\nAs with guitar techs, a bass tech also sets up the amplification equipment and effects pedals. Due to the lower pitch of the bass guitar, this instrument is amplified with specialized bass instrument amplifiers. While bass guitarists do not usually use as many effects pedals as most guitarists (e.g., reverb, chorus, flanger, etc.), most professional bassists may use a few \"sound conditioner\" effects such as a compressor, limiter, or equalizer. Some bassists also use octave pedals to generate extremely low pitches or bass overdrive pedals that produce a fuzzy, distorted sound. Although these effects function in the same way as regular electric guitar effects, a bass tech must be familiar with the settings and the resulting sounds and tones that are most often used by bass guitarists. A guitar tech who is in the first stages of learning to become a bass tech may know how to set up the bass effects from a technical point of view, but it may take a little longer for them to learn which compressor settings, for example, are associated with different funk or metal styles.\n\nIn some country, rockabilly, or jazz bands, the bass tech might also be responsible for setting up, tuning, and maintaining an upright bass or electric upright bass. In some folk or acoustic bands, the bass technician may also be responsible for maintaining an acoustic bass guitar, which is a larger, bass version of a standard acoustic guitar. More rarely, some bass techs might have to set up a bass synth (e.g., as used by the bassists in some alternative bands) or bass pedal keyboard such as a Moog Taurus pedal, as used by Sting or Led Zeppelin. Both upright basses and acoustic bass guitars usually use piezoelectric pickups rather than magnetic pickups, and in some cases, the instruments may use condenser mics to pick up the higher range sounds. To amplify instruments with piezo transducers and condenser mics, specialized impedance-matching preamplifiers are often required. Also, since both piezoelectric transducers and microphones are more prone to unwanted feedback than magnetic pickups, the bass tech may have to set up a notch filter with a parametric equalizer to reduce the frequency that is feeding back.\n"}
{"id": "35568995", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35568995", "title": "Hannibal (TV series)", "text": "Hannibal (TV series)\n\nHannibal is an American psychological horror–thriller television series developed by Bryan Fuller for NBC. The series is based on characters and elements appearing in Thomas Harris' novels \"Red Dragon\" and \"Hannibal\", with focus on the relationship between FBI special investigator Will Graham (Hugh Dancy) and Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Mads Mikkelsen), a forensic psychiatrist destined to become Graham's most cunning enemy and at the same time, the only person who can understand him.\n\nThe series received a 13-episode order for its first season and, unlike most U.S. network shows, all future seasons would feature 13 episodes. David Slade executive produced and directed the first episode. The series premiered on NBC on April 4, 2013. On May 9, 2014, NBC renewed \"Hannibal\" for a third season, which premiered on June 4, 2015. On June 22, 2015, NBC canceled \"Hannibal\" after three seasons because of low ratings. The series finale aired in Canada on City, on August 27, 2015, and aired two days later in the U.S. on NBC.\n\nThe series received critical acclaim, with the performances of the lead actors and the visual style of the show being singled out for praise. The first two seasons won the Saturn Awards for Best Network Television Series and Best Actor for Mikkelsen and Dancy respectively, with Laurence Fishburne winning Best Supporting Actor for season two. The third and final season won the inaugural Best Action-Thriller Television Series, while guest star Richard Armitage won Best Supporting Actor. The show has garnered a cult following and is considered by critics and audiences as one of the best series of the horror genre, and one of the best TV series of all time.\n\nFBI profiler Will Graham is recruited by Jack Crawford, the head of Behavioral Sciences, to help investigate a serial killer in Minnesota. With the investigation weighing heavily on Graham, Crawford decides to have him supervised by forensic psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Initially, Lecter – who is secretly a cannibalistic serial killer – works to manipulate the FBI from within, but the bond he builds with Graham begin to threaten his longevity. Lecter is fascinated by Graham's ability to empathize with psychopathic murderers, and tries to push the boundaries of Graham's fragile sanity in order to turn him into a killer himself.\n\n\n\nNBC began developing a \"Hannibal\" series in 2011 and former head of drama Katie O'Connell brought in her long-time friend Bryan Fuller (who had previously served as a writer-producer on NBC's \"Heroes\") to write a pilot script in November. NBC gave the series a financial commitment before Fuller had completed his script. On February 14, 2012, NBC bypassed the pilot stage of development by giving the series a 13-episode first season based solely on the strength of Fuller's script. The series went into production quickly thereafter.\n\nDavid Slade, who had previously directed the pilot for NBC's \"Awake\", directed the first episode and serves as an executive producer. José Andrés is the series' \"culinary cannibal consultant\" and advises the crew on proper procedure for preparing human flesh for consumption.\n\nFuller discussed the limited episode order and the continuing story arc he envisions for the series. \"Doing a cable model on network television gives us the opportunity not to dally in our storytelling because we have a lot of real estate to cover\". Speaking specifically about the Lecter character, Fuller said, \"There is a cheery disposition to our Hannibal. He's not being telegraphed as a villain. If the audience didn't know who he was, they wouldn't see him coming. What we have is Alfred Hitchcock's principle of suspense—show the audience the bomb under the table and let them sweat when it's going to go boom\". He went on to call the relationship between Graham and Lecter as \"really a love story\", saying \"As Hannibal has said [to Graham] in a couple of the movies, 'You're a lot more like me than you realize'. We'll get to the bottom of exactly what that means over the course of the first two seasons\".\n\nFuller originally planned for the show to run for seven seasons: the first three consisting of original material, the fourth covering \"Red Dragon\", the fifth \"The Silence of the Lambs\", the sixth \"Hannibal\", and the seventh an original storyline resolving \"Hannibal\"s ending. However, after the conclusion of the second season, Fuller stated he later envisioned the show to run six seasons, incorporating the books into the show in a different way than he originally planned. Season 3 would use material from \"Hannibal Rising\" as well as \"Red Dragon\" and include a different origin story for Dr. Lecter; the season ultimately also adapted \"Hannibal\" as well. Fuller had intended to include other characters from the book series (such as Jame Gumb and Clarice Starling) provided he could get the rights from MGM. Franklin Froideveaux and Tobias Budge were created because Fuller could not secure the rights to \"The Silence of the Lambs\" characters Benjamin Raspail and Jame Gumb. Fuller added they also tried to get the rights to Barney Matthews, an orderly at the Baltimore State Hospital, but were denied, thus a character based on Barney appeared in the second season, named Matthew Brown, but the character ended up being an antithesis to the original series' Barney. Dr. Bedelia Du Maurier is named after the character in \"Creepshow\" and author Daphne du Maurier.\n\nRegarding the series' influences, Fuller stated: \"When I sat down to the script, I was very consciously saying, 'What would David Lynch do with a Hannibal Lecter character? What sort of strange, unexpected places would he take this world?' I'm a great admirer of his work and his aesthetic and his meticulous sound design. Those were all components that I felt very strongly needed to be part of our Hannibal Lecter story. Between Lynch and Kubrick, there's a lot of inspiration.\" Fuller also cited David Cronenberg and Dario Argento as influences on the series. Fuller cited Tony Scott as an influence for the third season.\n\nEnglish actor Hugh Dancy was the first actor to be cast, taking on the lead role of FBI criminal profiler Will Graham, who seeks help from Lecter in profiling and capturing serial killers. In June 2012, Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen was cast as Lecter. Soon after this, actor Laurence Fishburne was cast as FBI Behavioral Sciences Unit commander Jack Crawford. Caroline Dhavernas was later cast as Dr. Alana Bloom, a former student of Hannibal Lecter, and Hettienne Park was cast as CSI Beverly Katz. Lara Jean Chorostecki, Kacey Rohl, Scott Thompson and Aaron Abrams were cast in recurring roles.\n\nGina Torres, Laurence Fishburne's then real-life wife, had a recurring role as Phyllis \"Bella\" Crawford, Jack Crawford's terminally ill wife. Ellen Greene, Raúl Esparza and Gillian Anderson were later cast in recurring roles and appeared later in season one, though Greene actually appeared in only one episode. Molly Shannon, Eddie Izzard and Lance Henriksen guest-starred during the first season.\n\nSeveral of the actors on the series have worked with creator Bryan Fuller previously, including Dhavernas, who played the lead role in \"Wonderfalls\", and Torres, Greene, Esparza and Shannon, who all appeared in the television series \"Pushing Daisies\". Chelan Simmons reprised her role as Gretchen Speck-Horowitz from \"Wonderfalls\" in an episode of \"Hannibal\". Ellen Muth, who starred in Fuller's \"Dead Like Me\", guest-starred as a character named Georgia Madchen, a nod to her original character and a \"reinterpretation of that character\".\n\nDavid Bowie was approached for the role of Hannibal's uncle, Robert Lecter, for the second season, but was unavailable for the role. Gillian Anderson returned as Lecter's psychiatrist, Dr. Bedelia Du Maurier, in multiple episodes for the second season. Eddie Izzard reprised his role as Dr. Abel Gideon for the second season. Cynthia Nixon joined the recurring cast as Kade Prurnell, an employee of the Office of the Inspector General, who is investigating Jack Crawford's role in the events of the first season. Katharine Isabelle joined the recurring cast as Margot Verger, who was originally described as a potential love interest for Graham, but Fuller later clarified that, as in the novel \"Hannibal\", Margot \"... is a member of the LGBT community!\" Michael Pitt joined the recurring cast in the role of Mason Verger, Margot's abusive twin brother. Amanda Plummer guest-starred in the second season, playing Katherine Pimms, an acupuncturist. Jeremy Davies and Chris Diamantopoulos appear in two episodes.\n\nFuller stated in June 2014 after winning the Saturn Award for Best Network Television Series that they were told by Bowie's management to ask again for his availability for the third season. He also went on to list David Thewlis, Brad Dourif, Kristin Chenoweth, Lee Pace, and Anna Friel as actors he would like to appear on the series. For the third season, Anderson was promoted to series regular after recurring throughout the first two seasons. Tao Okamoto was announced to play Lady Murasaki, Hannibal's enigmatic aunt, in season three, however, Fuller later confirmed at a PaleyFest panel in New York that Okamoto would in fact be playing the role of Chiyoh, Lady Murasaki's handmaid. For the third season, Joe Anderson replaced Michael Pitt as Mason Verger, as Pitt decided not to return to the role. In December 2014, Fortunato Cerlino was announced as portraying Rinaldo Pazzi. In January 2015, several recurring roles were cast, including Richard Armitage as Francis Dolarhyde; Nina Arianda as Molly Graham, Will's wife; Rutina Wesley as Reba McClane; and Glenn Fleshler as Dr. Cordell Doemling. In March 2015, Zachary Quinto was cast in a guest-starring role as one of Dr. Du Maurier's patients. Izzard reprised the role of Gideon for the season three premiere, although he was initially hesitant about returning.\n\nFuller stated that should the series continue, whether for a fourth season or feature film, and should they obtain rights to adapt \"The Silence of the Lambs\", Ellen Page would be his ideal casting for Clarice Starling.\n\nFilming of \"Hannibal\" took place in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The first season began shooting on August 27, 2012. The series began production on the second season in Toronto in August 2013. Filming for season 3 began on October 20, 2014, in Toronto, and some filming of exterior and interior scenes were shot in Florence, Italy and Palermo.\n\nOn June 22, 2015, NBC cancelled the series. Fuller initiated talks with Amazon Video and Netflix for a renewal. In July 2015, the cast were released after their contracts expired, but Mikkelsen and Dancy have expressed interest in reprising their respective roles if the series is acquired by a streaming service. However, the series has an exclusive streaming deal with Amazon, making finding a new distributor for the series difficult. On July 6, 2015, it was revealed that discussions with Amazon came to an end as a result of deadlines set by the service as a part of the deal, which Fuller felt would not allow for enough time to conceptualize and produce a new season. Meetings with Netflix were held, but largely due to the prior deal with Amazon, they also decided to pass on the series, and Fuller confirmed the series was still being shopped. On July 11, when asked to elaborate, Fuller commented that Netflix could not renew the series due to Amazon having the exclusive streaming rights, and that Amazon wanted to renew the series, but wanted an immediate debut, while Fuller wanted more time to work on the scripts in advance before shooting. Fuller also stated that he and the producers are exploring the possibility of a feature film. Fuller stated after the finale aired that financing for a film is being looked into, as well as divulging his planned \"Silence of the Lambs\" storyline and that Starz could serve as a potential renewal due to their relationship on \"American Gods\". Fuller reunited with Anderson to direct a \"Hannibal\"-themed ad for PETA, which debuted on November 20, 2015. In December 2015, Mikkelsen stated his willingness to return for a potential fourth season, while also stating that everyone involved would be pleased with the run and success of the series if it does not come together.\n\nIn March 2016, De Laurentiis blamed online piracy of the series as part of the reason for cancellation. In May 2016, Mikkelsen commented on a possible revival, stating, \"It all depends on Bryan. He is the key, the base, the heart. We will wait and see what happens next in his career. But we all know that we can easily pick this up in two or three years, there are breaks in the stories. We could pick it up, say, four years later. If Bryan is up for it, we will all go for it.\" In June 2016, Fuller stated, \"The cast is game, I'm game, it's just a matter of finding the right time where everybody's schedules sync up, but I would love to continue to tell the story with Hugh Dancy and Mads Mikkelsen. They're such fantastic collaborators, and one of the most satisfying actor-showrunner relationships I've ever had in this industry. So I would love to continue this story.\" He also revealed other information dealing with rights: \"Two years after the last airing of the show, we can investigate our options [...] August 2017 is when we can actually start talking about it. That's when we would have to see what the rights are for the character and for the story, and see who's interested and how we get it done. I have the story, and the cast is excited for the story, so we're ready to go if somebody wants to go.\" In December 2016, Fuller confirmed his plans for a \"Silence of the Lambs\" miniseries in an interview on the Blumhouse Productions podcast, stating, \"I think the film adaptation is a perfect film, but there are a lot of interesting nooks and crannies in that book to explore in a television series.\" In August 2017, formal conversations on the revival had begun.\n\nThe series' fourth episode, \"Oeuf\", which revolves around kidnapped children who have been brainwashed into murdering their own former families, was pulled from the United States broadcast schedule at the request of creator Bryan Fuller. The episode was still shown in other countries. This was not a result of the Boston Marathon bombings as some reports have indicated, but was actually decided just hours beforehand, and was more likely due to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. Fuller said of the decision, \"With this episode, it wasn't about the graphic imagery or violence. It was the associations that came with the subject matter that I felt would inhibit the enjoyment of the overall episode. It was my own sensitivity... We want to be respectful of the social climate we're in right now\". In lieu of a traditional broadcast, a portion of the episode was broken into a series of webisodes, which was made available through various online media outlets. The complete episode was later made available via iTunes and Amazon Video on April 29, 2013, and the episode appears in the order intended on the DVD and Blu-ray release.\n\nThe series was axed by Salt Lake City's KSL-TV (Channel 5) as of April 29, 2013, after four episodes were aired, and started airing in that market on KUCW, Utah's CW affiliate.\n\nCity picked up broadcasting rights in Canada, where the show is filmed, as a mid-season debut. When \"Hannibal\" was moved to Saturdays on NBC in the middle of the third season, City continued to air the series in its regular Thursday time slot in Canada.\n\nIn Europe, one year before originally airing, in April 10, 2012, the ProSiebenSat.1 Media Group acquired the rights to broadcast the series in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark beginning in 2013. Sky Living started broadcasting the show in the UK and Republic of Ireland from May 7, 2013.\n\nIn the South Pacific, the series is also broadcast on the Seven Network in Australia, from mid-April 2013 and in New Zealand, the show premiered on TV3 on January 25, 2014. The series airs in Latin America through AXN. In Middle East and North Africa region, the series is broadcast on OSN.\n\nReviews for the first season were positive. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the first season received an approval rating of 71% based on 41 reviews, with an average rating of 7.55/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"\"Hannibal\" caters to an intellectual audience that prefers plenty of gore in its psychological thrillers, with a polished presentation of madness.\" On Metacritic, the first season scored 70 out of 100 based on 32 reviews, which constitutes \"generally favorable reviews\". Joanne Ostrow of \"The Denver Post\" praised the series as a \"... well constructed, masterfully written piece,\" but stated \"... this level of violent imagery is not my cup of tea...\" She also had high praise for the characters, stating that they are \"... so compelling, however, that you may give in to the gore-fest.\" Paul Doro of \"Shock Till You Drop\" gave \"Hannibal\" an 8/10 and said of the series, \"The stab at classy horror mostly succeeds due to excellent performances from the leads, genuine suspense and surprises, well-constructed short and long-term mysteries, and an appropriately disconcerting mood that permeates the action right from the start...\" and praised Hugh Dancy in particular, saying he \"... does an outstanding job of subtlety conveying how painful human interaction is for him, and despite being abrasive and unpleasant, you are always in his corner and really feel for the guy.\" Jeff Jensen of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the show an A- and called it \"... finely acted, visually scrumptious, and deliciously subversive.\"\n\nBrian Lowry of \"Variety\" said \"Hannibal\" is \"... the tastiest drama the network has introduced in awhile,\" and had particular praise for the central trio of Dancy, Mikkelsen and Fishburne. Eric Goldman of IGN gave the series a 9/10, which constitutes a score of \"Amazing\". He said, \"A prequel TV series about Hannibal Lecter has to overcome a lot of preconceptions ... But guess what? None of that matters when you actually watch the show, because \"Hannibal\" is terrific.\" Linda Stasi of \"The New York Post\" gave the series two and a half stars out of four, praising the performances and called it \"... The most beautifully shot and produced show on network TV, with many scenes simply and literally breathtaking...\" Jeff Simon from \"The Buffalo News\" called \"Hannibal\" \"deeply sinister\" and \"brilliant.\" The \"Chicago Sun Times\" TV critic Lori Rackl said, \"\"Hannibal\" is a haunting, riveting... drama that has the look and feel of a show audiences have become more accustomed to seeing on cable than broadcast,\" and concluded that \"It's also extremely well executed... bound to leave viewers hungry for more.\" Alan Sepinwall of HitFix called \"Hannibal\" \"creepy, haunting, smart, utterly gorgeous...\" and the best of this season's serial killer shows. Sepinwall also praised the character of Hannibal, writing he has been made into a believable supervillain without making the police force and others look incompetent. Reflecting on the completed first season, \"The A.V. Club\"s Todd VanDerWerff wrote that the series acts as a corrective to the \"empty\" violence on much of television and \"restores the seriousness of purpose to a genre long in need of it... \"Hannibal\" is interested in death and murder as a means to glance sidelong at some of life’s largest questions. When not functioning as a cop drama, it’s an intricately twisted serial-killer thriller, but it’s also a surprisingly deep series about psychiatry and the state of the human mind.\" VanDerWerff concluded that Fuller had taken a series \"that had every reason to be a cheap cash-in and has, instead, turned into one of TV’s best shows.\"\n\nOther reviews were less favorable. Glenn Garvin from \"The Miami Herald\" called it \"a fast-food hash of poor planning and worse execution...\", referring to the writing as \"a mess of unmemorable dialogue and unworkable characterizations.\" Matthew Gilbert of \"The Boston Globe\" was similarly critical, calling the series \"rank and depressing,\" and concluded that it is \"shocking, gruesome, and, ultimately, hollow.\"\n\nOn Metacritic, the second season scored 88 out of 100 based on 14 reviews, which constitutes \"universal acclaim\".

The game was released on January 20, 2016, and is a prequel to the 1999 space-based real-time strategy video game \"Homeworld\".\n\nGearbox Software bought the intellectual property rights to the \"Homeworld\" franchise during THQ's bankruptcy auction in 2013. Following this, they announced that they were remaking both \"Homeworld\" and \"Homeworld 2\" in high definition, released on Steam in February 2015 as \"Homeworld Remastered Collection\".\n\nAfter obtaining the IP rights, Gearbox granted permission for use of the \"Homeworld\" IP to Blackbird Interactive, a company formed by members of the original \"Homeworld\" development team in 2007. At the time, Blackbird was developing a ground-based RTS game entitled \"Hardware: Shipbreakers\", which was subsequently renamed \"Homeworld: Shipbreakers\" and announced as a prequel to \"Homeworld\". On December 16, 2015, the game was officially announced as \"Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak\". The game also became available for pre-order on Steam on that date. Pre-orders of \"Deserts of Kharak\" also included the \"Homeworld Remastered Collection\" for free, while those who already owned the \"Homeworld Remastered Collection\" received a 20% discount for their pre-order of \"Deserts of Kharak\". The pre-order also came with a free copy of the interactive Expedition Guide, a DLC companion application to the game, which details the history of Kharak and its society, the expedition and its purpose, technical data on the vehicles used by the Coalition and the Gaalsien, and a behind-the-scenes look at Blackbird's founding and the eventual progression from \"Hardware: Shipbreakers\" to \"Deserts of Kharak\". It became available for purchase on Steam, along with the game's soundtrack by Paul Ruskay (who also composed the soundtracks for all of the previous \"Homeworld\" games), on the day the game launched.\n\nOn 15 March 2016, the Soban Fleet Pack was announced as \"Deserts of Kharak\"s first in-game DLC pack, adding Kiith Soban as a playable faction in Skirmish and Multiplayer modes. Kiith Soban is a subfaction of the Northern Coalition, but with a number of unique differences, including their own version of the Carrier, Battlecruiser, Baserunner, and Railgun vehicles. The pack is available as of 22 March 2016. A second DLC pack introduced the Khaaneph faction, clanless scavengers from Kharak's southern deserts who use salvaged Gaalsien technology. The Khaaneph fleet pack was released on 26 April 2016.\n\nThe game is set on the desert planet of Kharak, the home-in-exile of the Kushan (Hiigaran) people, 106 years prior to the events of \"Homeworld\". Kharak is a dying world, the desert growing larger with each passing year, and the Kushan clans regularly wage war amongst one another. Then a satellite detects an object in the Great Banded Desert, known as the Jaraci Object, or the \"primary anomaly\". An expedition had been sent by the Coalition of the Northern Kiithid, a group of Kushan clans from the northern polar region of Kharak, but had disappeared in the desert four years earlier; the in-game campaign centers around a second expedition, and its chief science officer, Rachel S'jet.\n\nRachel's expedition, centered around the Kiith S'jet land carrier \"Kapisi\", departs from Epsilon Base in the Kharakian desert. Shortly after the expedition departs, however, Kiith Gaalsien (a group of religious zealots exiled from mainstream Kharakian society) attack and destroy a number of Coalition bases, including Epsilon, and lay siege to the city of Tiir, the planetary capital. The Gaalsien then attack the \"Kapisi\" at a S'jet base known as the Boneyard, while the \"Kapisi\" is undergoing final outfitting for desert operations. A masked Gaalsien commander named Khagaan declares that the Coalition's use of satellites and other space-based technology violates the law of the Great Maker, Sajuuk, and the Gaalsien declare war on the Coalition. Escaping from the Boneyard under cover of a sandstorm, the \"Kapisi\" searches for their sister ship, the Kiith Siidim carrier \"Sakala\", which also escaped its base after a Gaalsien attack.\n\nIn a region called Hell's Gate, the expedition stumbles upon the wreck of a previously launched S'jet carrier, the \"Ifriit Naabal\", the flagship of the first expedition four years earlier; Rachel's elder brother Jacob had been first officer of the carrier, which recovered an artifact from the wreckage of a space-going vessel called the \"Kalash\". The expedition moves in to salvage more artifacts from the \"Kalash\", but come under attack from superior Gaalsien forces, led by Khagaan from the carrier \"Ashoka\". Just as the expedition is about to be overrun, the \"Sakala\" and its escorts arrive with reinforcements, driving the Gaalsien forces off. The \"Sakala\" draws off the \"Ashoka\" while the \"Kapisi\" attacks the Gaalsien resource operations, but the Gaalsien carrier changes course to attack the \"Kapisi\" and its escorts. Despite the Gaalsien carrier's defenses and EMP weaponry, the Coalition forces engage and destroy the \"Ashoka\".\n\nApproaching the edge of Gaalsien territory, the two carriers assault a Gaalsien fortress, again using the \"Sakala\" to draw off the base's defenders while the \"Kapisi\" attacks the resource operations. Accessing the Gaalsien database, Rachel discovers that her brother had survived for years in Gaalsien custody, and that the Gaalsien believe the Jaraci Object to be the mythical Khar-Toba, the \"First City\" and origin of Kushan civilization. The Gaalsien leader, the K'Had Sajuuk, believes he will become ruler of all Kharak if he enters the temple of Khar-Toba. Along the way, the expedition also discovers a number of shipwrecks that are largely intact in spite of their age and conditions in the desert, and Rachel theorizes that they in fact materialized inside solid rock (referencing the hyperspace abilities of vessels by the time of \"Homeworld\"), having been forcibly intercepted by the power contained within the Jaraci Object site. Making their way through a narrow canyon into a region the Gaalsien call the \"Dreamlands\", the \"Kapisi\" and the \"Sakala\" engage and destroy two Gaalsien carriers, and fight their way to a high plateau in order to obtain critical supplies via airborne cargo landers from their leaders in Tiir.\n\nAs the K'Had Sajuuk's forces approach the primary anomaly, a weapons satellite opens fire on them from orbit; Rachel leaves to investigate the source of the signal that triggered the satellite, as the \"Kapisi\" holds its ground against enemy forces on the plateau in order to secure a runway for the landers. Just as the Coalition forces gain the upper hand, however, the Siidim forces betray them, opening fire on the S'jet cargo landers; the Siidim, long-time enemies of the Gaalsien, declare that they alone were of divine origin and would \"purify\" the desert, and that Khar-Toba and its secrets were theirs to claim. Rachel discovers that the signal that triggered the orbital satellite was from a Taiidan carrier, which crashed on the surface after deploying the weapon; Jacob used the transponder to trigger the satellite himself before dying of starvation and exposure. Rachel escapes the wreck with the transponder and makes a rendezvous with the \"Kapisi\", which engages and destroys the \"Sakala\" and its escort forces.\n\nWith the Siidim defeated, Rachel travels ahead of the expedition, discovering that Khar-Toba is in fact an ancient starship, surrounded by an ancient city buried in the sand. The expedition sets up a scanner network around the wreck to better direct the Taiidan weapon satellite in orbit, and face the K'Had Sajuuk, commanding a unique flagship-style carrier. The Coalition forces destroy the Gaalsien flagship in a heated battle; as his ship is consumed in the explosion, the K'Had Sajuuk warns that Kharak would be destroyed by fire from the sky (prophetically referencing the events of \"Homeworld\") as a result of the Coalition's actions. At the end, Rachel reflects that her brother had believed the salvation of their people to be found in the desert as the scene pans out from Khar-Toba towards the night sky, and the future that would await the Kushan in the century to come.\n\nUnlike the previous games, which had two separate races, all of the factions in \"Deserts of Kharak\" are Kushan, but have distinct looks from one another, and also work differently. The campaign centers around the Coalition (the player's faction) and Kiith Gaalsien; two other groups, Kiith Soban and the Khaaneph, were added in DLC packs as playable factions (in addition to the originals) for Skirmish and Multiplayer modes.\n\n\n\"Deserts of Kharak\" is a spin-off, in that it deviates from the backstory included with the original \"Homeworld\" in the form of the \"Homeworld Manual: Historical + Technical Briefing\" booklet. The latter maintains that Kiith Gaalsien self-destructed and was reduced to the status of myth centuries before the discovery of Khar-Toba and clans had long ceased any serious military conflict.\n\n\"Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak\" has received \"generally favorable\" reviews from critics, scoring 79/100 on Metacritic, and 79.39% on GameRankings.\n\nMark Steighner of Hardcore Gamer gave the game a 4 out of 5 saying, \"\"Homeworld: Desert of Kharak\" is an accessible and well-made strategy game with outstanding production values and a legitimate claim to being part of the legendary franchise.\" Patrick Hancock from Destructoid rated the game a 7.5/10 saying, \"the campaign is well executed for veterans and newbies alike, proving that over a decade without Homeworld is far too long.\" IGN awarded it a score of 8.8 out of 10, calling it a \"deep, exciting, varied RTS with all the right tools.\" Zach Turnbull from GoneWithTheWin rated the game a 8/10 saying, \"A good, if not ground-breaking, tactical RTS accompanied by excellent story elements. Don't expect to recreate the magic of the original Homeworld 16 years ago and you won't be disappointed.\".\n"}

He is best remembered for his BBC Radio programme, \"The Clitheroe Kid\" (1958–72), a version of which was produced for television on the ITV network under the title \"Just Jimmy\" (1964–68).\n\nHe was born in Clitheroe, Lancashire, England on Christmas Eve 1921 at 58 Wilkin Street, (now called Highfield Road), to weavers Emma Pye and James Robert Clitheroe, who had married in 1918. He was born at his maternal grandparents' house. Within days the family moved to Blacko, near Nelson, living at 14 Spout Houses, a row of terrace houses below Blacko Tower. He attended the Council School up to the age of 12, when he transferred to Barrowford Board School for his final two years.\n\nAn only child, he was named after his mother's brother, James Robinson Pye, who had been born in Clitheroe in 1894 and was killed in action in the First World War. \n\nAccording to newspapers in 1937 and 1938, at the age of 16 Clitheroe was 3ft 6in and a half. His father was over 6ft tall but Jimmy never grew any taller than 4ft 2in — about average for an 8 or 9 year old boy. Clitheroe's small size was caused by his thyroid gland being damaged at birth during a forceps delivery and, until later life, he could easily pass for an 11-year-old, which was the character he played on stage, in his early films and on radio in \"The Clitheroe Kid\".\n\nJimmy Clitheroe was too small to work in the weaving sheds with his parents as he couldn't reach the looms so at first he worked in a bakery in Nelson on leaving school, but before long started out on the stage, touring the variety theatres in Yorkshire and Lancashire from 1937. He was a boy accordionist and also played the xylophone and saxophone. His parents bought a\ncaravan so they could take him round the various towns in whose theatres he appeared. He made his first pantomime appearance in 1938, alongside the bumptious \"Two Ton\" Tessie O'Shea. In pantomime Jimmy was usually cast as Buttons, Tom Thumb or Wishee Washee. but moved into films from 1940 (thanks to a chance meeting with top of the bill stars Arthur Lucan & Kitty McShane), into radio from 1954 (initially on the BBC's regional Home Service North, and subsequently on the nationwide Light Programme), and finally onto television (with ITV, produced by ABC Television in their Manchester studios) from 1963. \n\nHe also appeared in pantomime and summer season dates and bit-part film appearances with Old Mother Riley, George Formby, Vera Lynn, and Frank Randle.\n\nHis long-running radio programme on the BBC, \"The Clitheroe Kid\", which aired from May 1958 to August 1972, is still occasionally repeated on BBC Radio 4 Extra. His catchphrase was \"Don't some mothers 'ave 'em!\"\n\nIn 1959 Jimmy Clitheroe took part in the royal command variety show and he also starred in the television series Holiday Hotel.\nMollie Sugden (who played Mrs Slocombe in the BBC TV series \"Are You Being Served?\") played Clitheroe's mother on stage in the 1960s and in his ITV television series \"Just Jimmy\" from 1964 to 1968 (which also featured Jimmy's co-star from \"The Clitheroe Kid\", Danny Ross).\n\nClitheroe owned a bookmaker's shop on Springfield Road and the Fernhill Hotel at Preesall, and appeared on Blackpool stages for many decades. For many years he drove a Mercedes with blocks on the pedals so his feet could reach them. Appearing to be an underage driver, he could seldom complete a journey without coming to the attention of the police.\n\nIn September 1972 the Clitheroe Kid was axed by the BBC after a 14 year run.\n\nOn 30 March 1973 Clitheroe collapsed in his hotel room in Plymouth and spent four days in hospital. \n\nJimmy Clitheroe died on 6 June 1973 from an accidental overdose of sleeping pills and after having seven brandies, on the day of his mother's funeral. He was found unconscious in bed by relatives and died later that same day in hospital in Blackpool. His mother had died five days before aged 84. His funeral was held at Carleton Crematorium, Blackpool, where for many years he was commemorated by a plaque attached to memorial tree Number 3.\n\nHe never married. He lived with his mother, to whom he was very close, in a bungalow at Bispham Road, Blackpool. His father died in January 1951.\n\n\n"}

It is an adaptation of the 1981 children's book of the same name by Chris Van Allsburg. The film was written by Van Allsburg, Greg Taylor, Jonathan Hensleigh, and Jim Strain and stars Robin Williams, Bonnie Hunt, Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce, Jonathan Hyde, Bebe Neuwirth, and David Alan Grier.\n\nThe story centers on 12-year-old Alan Parrish, who becomes trapped in a supernatural board game while playing with his best friend Sarah Whittle in 1969. Twenty-six years later, in 1995, siblings Judy and Peter Shepherd find the game, begin playing and then unwittingly release the now-adult Alan. After tracking down Sarah, the quartet resolve to finish the game in order to reverse all of the destruction it has caused.\n\nThe film was released on December 15, 1995. Despite the film receiving generally unfavorable reviews from critics, it was a box office success, earning $263 million worldwide on a budget of approximately $65 million and it became the 10th highest-grossing film of 1995.\n\nA similar film, marketed as a spiritual successor to \"Jumanji\", titled \"\", was released in 2005 and was also adapted from a Van Allsburg book that was more directly connected to the \"Jumanji\" book.\n\nIt is part of the \"Jumanji\" franchise and spawned a direct sequel, \"\" (2017), as well as an animated television series, which aired from 1996 to 1999.\n\nIn 1869, near Brantford, New Hampshire, two brothers bury a chest, hoping that no one will ever find it.\n\nIn 1969, Alan Parrish flees a gang of bullies and retreats to a shoe factory owned by his father, Sam. An employee, Carl Bentley, shows Alan a new shoe prototype he made by himself. Alan misplaces the shoe and damages a machine, but Carl takes responsibility and loses his job. After the bullies attack Alan and steal his bicycle, he follows the sound of tribal drumbeats to a construction site. There, he finds the chest, which contains a board game called \"Jumanji\", and brings it home. Sam and Alan argue about Alan attending boarding school, causing Alan to plan to run away. His friend Sarah Whittle arrives to return his bicycle, and Alan shows her Jumanji and invites her to play. With each roll of the dice, the game piece moves by itself and a cryptic message describing the roll's outcome appears in the crystal ball at the center of the board. Sarah reads the first message on the board and hears an eerie sound. Alan then unintentionally rolls the dice after being startled by the chiming clock; a message tells him to wait in a jungle until someone rolls a 5 or 8. Alan is sucked into the game, and a swarm of bats chase Sarah out of the mansion.\n\nIn 1995, Judy and Peter Shepherd move into the vacant Parrish mansion with their aunt Nora, after their parents having recently died in a car accident in Canada. Soon after, Judy and Peter find Jumanji in the attic and begin playing it. Their rolls release a swarm of giant mosquitoes and a troop of monkeys. The game rules state that everything will be restored when the game ends, so they continue playing. Peter's next roll releases a lion and an adult Alan. Alan leaves the house, where he meets Carl, who is now working as a police officer. Alan, Judy, and Peter go to the now-abandoned shoe factory, where a hermit tells Alan that after his disappearance, Sam and his wife abandoned the business and searched for Alan, until their deaths just four years ago.\n\nRealizing they need Sarah to finish the game, the three locate her, now suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder due to Alan's disappearance, and persuade her to join them. Sarah's roll releases fast-growing carnivorous plants, and Alan's next roll releases a big-game hunter, Van Pelt. Judy's next roll releases a stampede of various animals, and a pelican steals the game. Peter retrieves it, but Alan is arrested by Carl, and Peter transforms into a monkey after attempting to cheat. Later, Van Pelt catches up to the others and steals the game. Peter, Sarah, and Judy follow Van Pelt to a department store, where they create booby traps to subdue Van Pelt, retrieve the game, and reunite with Alan. When the four return to the mansion, it is now completely overrun by jungle wildlife. As the game releases further calamities and Van Pelt returns, Alan finally rolls a winning turn, causing everything that had happened as a result of the game to be reversed.\n\nAlan and Sarah return to 1969 as children, but have full memories of the future events. Alan reconciles with his father and admits that he was responsible for the shoe that damaged the factory's machine to prevent Carl from getting fired, and Sam tells his son that he does not have to attend boarding school. Alan and Sarah toss the board game into a river and then share a kiss.\n\nIn an alternate 1995, Alan and Sarah are married and expecting their first child. Alan runs the factory, Carl still works in the factory and Alan's parents are retired, but still alive. He and Sarah legitimately meet with Judy and Peter, and meet their parents Jim and Martha during a Christmas party. The Parrishes offer Jim a job and convince the Shepherds to cancel their ski trip in which they agree, and begin a friendship with them.\n\nOn a beach, two French-speaking girls hear drumbeats as Jumanji lies partially buried in the sand.\n\n\nWhile Peter Guber was visiting Boston, he invited author Chris Van Allsburg, who lives in Providence, Rhode Island, to option his book. Van Allsburg wrote one of the screenplay's drafts, which he described as \"sort of trying to imbue the story with a quality of mystery and surrealism\".\n\nTristar Pictures agreed to finance the film on the condition that Robin Williams play the starring role. However, Williams turned down the role based on the first script he was given. Only after director Joe Johnston and screenwriters Jonathan Hensleigh, Greg Taylor and Jim Strain undertook extensive rewrites did Williams accept. Johnston had reservations over casting Williams because of the actor's reputation for improvisation, fearing that he wouldn't adhere to the script. However, Williams understood that it was \"a tightly structured story\" and filmed the scenes as outlined in the script, often filming duplicate scenes afterwards where he was allowed to improvise with Bonnie Hunt.\n\nShooting took place in various New England locales, mainly Keene, New Hampshire, which represented the story's fictional town of Brantford, New Hampshire, and North Berwick, Maine, where the Olde Woolen Mill stood in for the Parrish Shoe Factory. Additional filming took place in Vancouver, British Columbia, where a mock-up of the Parrish house was built.\n\nSpecial effects were a combination of more traditional techniques like puppetry and animatronics (provided by Amalgamated Dynamics) with state-of-the-art digital effects overseen by Industrial Light & Magic. ILM developed two new software programs specially for \"Jumanji\", one called iSculpt, which allowed the illustrators to create realistic facial expressions on the computer-generated animals in the film, and another that for the first time created realistic digital hair, used on the monkeys and the lion. Actor Bradley Pierce (Peter) underwent three and a half hours of prosthetic makeup application daily for a period of two and a half months to film the scenes where he transformed into a monkey.\n\nThe film was dedicated to visual effects supervisor Stephen L. Price, who died before the film's release.\n\n\"Jumanji\" was released in theatres on December 15, 1995.\n\n\"Jumanji\" was first released on VHS on May 14, 1996, and re-released as a Collector's Series DVD on January 25, 2000. This was followed by an initial Blu-ray release on June 28, 2011. The Blu-ray was re-released as a 20th Anniversary Edition on September 14, 2015 (with the same transfer found on the 2011 release). A restored version was released on December 5, 2017 on Blu-ray and 4K UHD to coincide with the premiere of the .\n\nCommercial songs from film, but not on soundtrack\n\n\"Jumanji\" did well at the box office, earning $100.5 million in the United States and Canada and an additional $162.3 million overseas, bringing the worldwide gross to $262.8 million.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 53% from 36 reviews, with an average rating of 5.7/10. On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 39 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nVan Allsburg approved of the film despite the changes from the book and its not being as \"idiosyncratic and peculiar\", declaring that \"[t]he film is faithful in reproducing the chaos level that comes with having a jungle animal in the house. It's a good movie.\"\n\n\"\", the spiritual successor that was marketed as being from the same continuity with varied uses of the tagline, \"From the world of \"Jumanji\"\" was released as a feature film in 2005. Unlike the book \"Zathura\", the film makes no references to the previous film outside of the marketing statement. Both films are based on books written by Chris Van Allsburg. With the films being based on books that take place in the same series, the films vaguely make reference to that concept from the novels by having a similar concept and themes.\n\nIn July 2012, rumors emerged that a remake of the film was already in development. In a conversation with \"The Hollywood Reporter\", Columbia Pictures president Doug Belgrad said: \"We're going to try and reimagine \"Jumanji\" and update it for the present.\" On August 1, 2012, it was confirmed that Matthew Tolmach would be producing the new version alongside William Teitler, who produced the original film.\n\nOn August 5, 2015, Sony Pictures Entertainment announced their plans to film a remake and set the release date as December 25, 2016. Internet reception to this announcement was negative, with some posters remarking that this announcement came too soon after the death of Williams. The news was also heavily criticized by Bradley Pierce and \"E! News\", the latter of which stated that they felt that the remake was \"unnecessary and kind of insulting\". On January 14, 2016, it was announced that Jake Kasdan will direct the remake. On January 20, 2016, it was announced that the remake would be pushed back to July 28, 2017. In April 2016, Dwayne Johnson signed on to produce and star in the remake, while \"Variety\", \"TheWrap\" and Deadline.com reported that Kevin Hart, Jack Black, and Nick Jonas were in early talks to co-star. In August 2016, Dwayne Johnson confirmed that the film would not be a remake, rather a continuation of the 1995 film and that it would be filmed in Hawaii. In August, Johnson announced on Instagram that Karen Gillan has been cast in the film. In September 2016, Johnson released a concept art of his character \"The Smoldering\" Dr. Bravestone.\n\nThe film, officially titled \"\", was released on December 20, 2017.\n\nJack Black, Dwayne Johnson, and Nick Jonas have discussed in interviews what a third installment would be about. Karen Gillan has also said that an alternate ending for \"Welcome to the Jungle\" would have left the door open for another film.\n\nAn animated television series was produced between 1996 and 1999. While it borrowed heavily from the film – incorporating various characters, locations and props, and modeling Alan's house and the board game on the way they appeared in the film – the series retcons rather than using the film's storyline. In the series version, on each turn the players are given a \"game clue\" and then sucked into the jungle until they solve it. Alan is stuck in \"Jumanji\" because he has not seen his clue. Judy and Peter try to help him leave the game, providing their motivation during the series. Sarah is absent from the series.\n\n\"Jumanji\" is a board game originally published by Milton Bradley in the US and MB Spiele in Germany in 1995.\n\n\"Jumanji\" is a North American-exclusive game for Microsoft Windows that was released on 1996 and based on the film. It was developed by Studio Interactive and published by Philips Media. It contains five different action-arcade-based mini-games that are based on popular scenes from the film. Clips of cutscenes from the film can also be viewed. There are five different mini-games that the player can choose from, with different rules and objectives. Animals from the film provide instructions to the player for each mini-game, except for the Treasure Maze mini-game, where the Jumanji board game spirit provides instructions instead. Notably, players cannot play the actual Jumanji board game from the film. All of these mini-games contain rounds (or levels) and when players reach a goal, that level is cleared and the player advances to a more difficult version of the mini-game. The player must try to score as many points as possible, and set the best high score.\n\nA video game based on the film was released in Europe for the PlayStation 2 in 2006.\n\nIn 2007, released a Pachinko game, using clips from the film and also used 3D rendered CGI anime character designs for the game as part of the screen interaction.\n\nIn 2005 \"Jumanji\" was listed 48 in Channel 4's 100 Greatest Family Films documentary just behind \"Dumbo\", \"The Lion King\" and \"Spider-Man\".\n\nIn 2011, Robin Williams recorded an audiobook for Van Allsburg's book's 30th edition to coincide its release.\n\nIn 2014, a game board prop from the movie was auctioned on eBay and sold for US$60,800.\n\n\n"}

It combines speaking, acting, and singing to present a story. There are no costumes, make-up, or settings. The main artist, \"Kaadhikan\" tells the story, act, and sings before the audience with two or three accompanying artists in the background playing the orchestra. It typically is one-and-a-half to two hours long. It originated from an earlier art form \"Harikadhakalakshepam\" which used similar techniques but differed in theme and style. While Harikadhakalakshepam was based on themes from puranas and epics, Kadhaprasangam received themes from sources largely classical and popular literature. The scripts can be original works written for the performance or adaptations of stories from epics, classical, or modern literature. William Shakespeare's Othello, Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, Kumaran Asan's Karuna, Vallathol Narayana Menon’s Magdalana Mariyam, Changampuzha Krishna Pillai's Ramanan, Thirunalloor Karunakaran's Rani and Vayalar Ramavarma's Aaayisha were some of the literary classics thus successfully adapted for Kadhaprasangam.\n\nKadhaprasangam's heyday was in the second half of 20th century, attracting crowds on temple grounds in the festival season. This was brought out of the temple grounds and founded as a popular presentation viz. 'KADHAPRASANGAM' by Swami Sathyadevan. The Govt of India honoured Swami Sathyadevan with pension awarded to founders of art forms while the Swami was in Banaras in the year 1961. Its chief and later exponents were Swami Brahmavruthan, M. P. Manmadhan, K. K. Vadhyar, P. C. Abraham, Kedamangalam Sadanandan, Joseph Kaimaparamban, V. Sambasivan, Kollam Babu, V. Harsha Kumar, Kallada V. V. Kutty,Paravur Sukumaran, V. D. Rajappan, Vatakara V Asokan, Nadakkal AshokKumar and others. They contributed to the development of social and educational renaissance in Kerala history. Nadakkal Ashokkumr performed kadhaprasangam in Temples, Cultural organisations, All India radio,Dooradarsan etc.. He performed Shakesper's Hamlet and Mahabharatha stories.Some time he performed magica with kadhaprasangam in gulf countries also,\n"}

She is the character Ullman has portrayed for the longest time, spanning over four decades and three television series. The character was born out of a sketch for a guest appearance on the British television comedy and music show \"Saturday Live\" in 1986.\n\nUllman says that Kay is based on a woman who worked at her bank in The Midlands. \"Basically, she's forty-three, has never been touched by a man and never will be. There's always one like her in every office who sells sanitary napkins and stamps, with her nice polyester ass waddling across the room. Once, at an office party, someone got her behind the filing cabinets, and he's never lived it down. People go, 'Oh, you and Kayyy - 1982...' 'Shut up! I never did nothing with her!' I love people like that.\"\n\nFor the Fox show series, Kay works for a paper-products distribution company, a job Ullman once held. In her HBO series, Kay was employed as a bank teller.\n\nKay is described an eternal optimist. \"Musn't crumble, Kay.\" She has devoted herself to caring for her invalid mother. While she loves her mother, Kay has outbursts of hatred for her from time to time, though she's quick to scold herself for such behavior. \n\nKay wears clothing made from polyester, along with a pen on a string which hangs around her neck. She cuts her own hair using a ceramic kitchen bowl and scissors. Kay's mode of transportation is a moped; she is sometimes shown wearing a helmet.\n\nKay, a Rhode Island paper distribution company office worker, is the constant victim of her coworkers', and even boss', taunts and pranks. Kay takes it all in stride, though. She frequently checks in on her mother on the phone. \"Hello, Mummy, it's (draws out) Kaaaay.\" We never see her mother on screen or hear her on the phone. We do know that she is an invalid. The cause of Mummy's injuries are revealed in the sketch \"Kay Babysits\":\n\nKay doesn't have any friends. It's revealed that she did have a boyfriend, Derrick in her youth.\n\nKay is presented as a 42-year-old Californian bank teller (and sometimes branch manager) at Van Nuys Savings and Loan. She took a work transfer from the bank she worked at in England to its American branch to take advantage of the American health care system for her mother. She lives in Panorama City. Unlike her portrayal in \"The Tracey Ullman Show\", Kay does not face the wrath of her nasty coworkers. While her Mother is not seen on screen, she is heard through a series of beeps from her bedroom. Kay's mother became an invalid after having been involved in an accident where the sidecar in which she was traveling broke free from the motorbike Kay's father was driving. \"'I didn't know the damn motorbike would part company with the sidecar, Mildred,' he shouted over his shoulder, as he sped off up Shaftesbury Avenue.\" Later, Kay's mother warned her: \"I remember the cold, steely glint in Mother's eye as she stared up at me from her iron lung.

She seeks medical marijuana for Mother in the episode \"Tracey Takes On... Smoking\" and inadvertently becomes a recreational user herself. Work and acting as a caregiver have given Kay very little time for a social life. She has never lost her virginity. After she takes part in a prison pen-pal program, attorney Sydney Kross (Ullman) convinces her to marry an inmate in hopes of sparing him the death penalty. Kay follows through with the quickie wedding, but her marriage does not result in a stay of execution from the governor. Kay's husband is placed in a gas chamber, leaving her, as Ullman refers to her, as \"the virgin widow.\" In the series finale, \"Tracey Takes On... The End of the World,\" Kay's mother finally dies. Kay now has her freedom - \"Three hours and fourteen minutes of it!\" she exclaims.\n\nKay is presented as a pensioner living in England with her mother who is 103. Unlike in previous shows, Mother is not an invalid. She has had many medical procedures performed, though. For the first time in the character's television history, Mother appears on-screen (played by actress Joan Linder). Kay was shown to be a year old at the time of King George VI's coronation in her first appearance in series one, making her nearly 80 years old.

Mother has been keeping a variety of correspondents from her for decades: a marriage proposal, acceptance of her application to a university, a job offer, and an invitation from a group of people to join them on holiday. In episode six, Kay tracks down her cousin Debbie from Australia who is doing their family tree. Kay learns that she has a large extended family. Kay has been under the impression that her only family is Mother (and Mother is keen on keeping it that way). Kay, overjoyed at the news that she has a family and the invitation from Debbie to come to Australia and meet them all, Mother (worried, and obviously lying) blurts out that Kay's father was not really her father.

{"id": "9067462", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9067462", "title": "Kouji", "text": "Kouji\n\nKouji (), which can be translated literally as \"mouth skill\" or \"skill of mouth\" is a Chinese vocal mimicry performance art which utilizes the human speech organs to mimic the sounds of everyday life. When this vocal mimicry is combined with varying degrees of story telling, acting, and singing, it results in the basic structure for a Kouji performance. The sounds most commonly used in Kouji tend to be those of animals, such as birds or dogs, but with the advancement of technology, Kouji has also come to incorporate imitations of busses, planes, and modern weapons. It is also now common to use a microphone in the performance of Kouji. Often the Kouji of a highly skilled performer so accurately mimics real life sounds that if the audience were to close their eyes, they might not be able to tell that the sounds were being produced by a human. Although it is an art form in and of itself, it may often be performed in combination with other traditional Chinese art forms such as Cross-talk. The primary objective of a Kouji performance is to bring joy to the audience through the sounds of their everyday lives, in a celebration of the harmony which exists between human beings and nature.\n\nMimicry – The principle and most difficult element of a Kouji performance is of course the vocal mimicry. It has neither a theoretical basis nor a concrete standard framework, and instead relies on the performer’s own talent and hard work in attempting to imitate the sounds of their environment.\n\nDialogue – It is often necessary to use an appropriate amount of dialogue to accompany vocal mimicry in a Kouji performance. The main aim of using dialogue is to strengthen the connection between the performer and the audience. Dialogue is used as an introduction and a guide throughout the performance. It may be carried out in the form of narration, poetry recitation, or Shuo-chang (Talk-sing) monologues which may be used to introduce a performance.\n\nHumor – Use of comedy serves to enrich a Kouji performance by providing an entertaining context in which to use vocal mimicry. Through humor the audience is invited to follow their innate instinct and laugh at the comical noises coming from the mouth of the performer. Humor fills out and gives character to a performance.\n\nSinging – Often singing is also used in Kouji in order to reference well known songs. In addition, some Kouji performers may also choose to imitate the singing voice of a particular recording artist to display the extent of their vocal mimicry skills.\n\nAlthough Kouji is believed by many to have origins in the animal calls used by hunters in tribal society, there are unfortunately no historical accounts of its transition from such a context into a performance art. The first historical account of Kouji ever recorded was over 2,300 years ago in Shandong province during the Warring States period. In the year 298 BC there was a Qin prime minister named Mengchang who was a student of Confucius, and accumulated over 3,000 followers. Mengchang found himself in a difficult situation when the Qin ruler began to believe that Mengchang could be spying on him for the neighboring state in which he was raised, and Mengchang was jailed. Mengchang tried to win his freedom by sending away for some very special garments to give the Qin ruler’s wife in an attempt to win her over, and thus gain his freedom. Complications arose however when the garments were seized by the guards and locked away. It was at this point that Mengchang used his followers' Kouji skills to steal back the clothes by luring the guards away by mimicking the barking of dogs. When the clothes were retrieved, they were successfully passed on to the ruler’s wife who was deeply touched and sent immediately for the release of Mengchang. By the time that the Qin ruler discovered what had happened, Mengchang and his followers had already begun to flee. When they had reached a nearby mountain pass which was their gateway to freedom, the Qin guards were hot on their trail. They needed to get through the mountains immediately, but it was still night time and the gatekeepers were not permitted to open the pass until the roosters' crows signaled that the morning had come. Yet again, one of Mengchang’s followers used his Kouji skills to mimic a rooster and trigger all of the local roosters to crow. This signaled that morning had come and allowed the gatekeepers to open the pass for Mengchang’s successful escape.\n\nAlthough this historical record of Kouji from the Warring States period was the first ever to be documented, more documentation followed as time passed. In fact, another student of Confucius named Gongchang Zhi who actually married one of the great thinker’s daughters, was himself known to be a performer of Kouji noted for his bird call mimicry during the same period.\n\nIt was during the Tang and Song dynasties that Kouji's development as an art form began to experience slightly more attention from the Chinese state. During these dynasties Kouji was one of the most popular forms of entertainment amongst the common people. As is Chinese political tradition to offer support and resources as a method of incorporation into the state, the government realized the power and importance of Kouji for the Chinese people and began to aid the development of the art form. In order to promote Kouji and train those who practiced it, a society of vocal mimicry was set up by the government.\n\nDuring this period of Kouji's history in the Song dynasty, truly legendary Kouji masters began to gain fame which has survived up until today. During the rule of Emperor Huizong there was a Kouji master who was nicknamed Liu Baiqin (Baiqin meaning hundreds of species of birds) because he was phenomenal at mimicking bird songs. His level of mastery was so high that his abilities were not limited only to performance; Liu was also able to communicate with birds in trees. The most famous female Kouji Master of all time Wen Banian, also made a name for herself during this same time period by performing her renowned mimicry of fruit peddlers’ cries. With government support and popular demand combined, Kouji found itself in a favorable position as far as nurturing new talents.\n\nThe following years were marked by the arrival of celebrated masters of Kouji who advanced the art form by building off of the work of their predecessors. During the Ming dynasty, the most famous Kouji Master was Fang Zhailang who is best known for his ability to imitate the dialects of different regions. Gou Maoer, who lived and performed during the early period of the Qing dynasty, made his name by creating and performing such pieces as \"slaughtering pigs\" and \"pigs fighting for food\". These are amongst the performances that have been passed down through the generations and can still be seen today. Later on in the Qing dynasty during the reign of the Guangxu Emperor there was a very eminent Kouji master who was famous for his mimicry of a song bird called the hwamei (melodious laughingthrush), and therefore was nicknamed Hwamei Yang. Amongst his great performances was “two birds fighting over food”, which is now on the verge of extinction.\n\nIt can be said that Kouji entered into a new phase of its history beginning in the 1930s when a Shanghai Kouji Master by the name of Yin Shilin implemented radical alterations in the way that Kouji was performed. Traditionally the Kouji master would sit at a big square table surrounded with a screen called an \"Eight Immortals\" table, which had a fan and a piece of wood on it. With the assistance of these tools, the performer would execute various vocal mimicry acts to entertain the audience who could only hear but not see their performance. The tools were important because they could make up for certain sounds that human speech organs are incapable of producing. Also, the screen allowed the performer to not think about facial expressions and gestures, and concentrate strictly on the sounds that they were making. After the 1930s when the screen and tools were taken away from the stage however, the audience could not only hear the vocal mimicry, but see the artists’ facial expressions and gestures as well. It was at this point in history that Kouji went from being called \"drama behind a screen\" to Kouji, meaning \"vocal skill\" or \"skill of mouth\" . Thus through a combination of imitation of sounds and stage performance, Kouji came to be what some might call a more engaging entertainment experience for the audience.\n\nAfter the formation of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, Kouji began to reach new audiences around the globe. Kouji masters such as the above-mentioned Yin Shilin and his disciple Zhou Zhicheng (the creators of such performances as \"the powerful army of one million crossing the Yangtze River\" and \"Coastal Front\"), traveled abroad extensively to perform Kouji. Largely by touring with acrobat troupes, performers began to gain Kouji an international reputation as \"an amazing oriental art\". Kouji Master Sun Tai, while in Poland even won a gold medal at the Warsaw International Acrobatics Competition for his performances. Since the Internationalization of Kouji, its relationship with the global community has expanded beyond entertainment for common people into use for Chinese diplomacy. Kouji master Niu Yuliang who currently resides in Beijing, has traveled to over 30 countries and performed for the likes of the King of Cambodia and the former US President George Bush Sr.\n\nKouji has been in constant development throughout the generations and ups and downs of history ever since the Tang dynasty. Today, Kouji finds itself facing a new set of generational challenges which threaten to change it forever. A lack of dedicated young disciples not only threatens to minimize Kouji’s presence in the fabric of Chinese culture, but it is also the cause for concern that many traditional performances might be lost forever. An increasing interest amongst the younger generation of China in new and foreign art forms suggests that to a great extent, traditional performance arts such as Kouji might lose some of their attractiveness to the future generations of Chinese. As an art form with a history of over 2,300 years that has traveled the world showcasing the artistic creativity and intelligence of the Chinese people, it has surprisingly still not received any direct support for preservation from the government. As the Chinese government becomes increasingly enthusiastic about preservation of their vast intangible cultural heritage, many hope that Kouji will come under the grace of their assistance as well.\n\nTo become a master of Chinese Kouji requires much more than may meet the eye. First and foremost a Kouji master must achieve an advanced level of excellence in vocal mimicry. This level of excellence however means little without the possession of natural stage presence and a passion for performance. In addition to being able to perform high level vocal mimicry skills with a contagious stage presence, a master of Kouji must also hold a profound dedication to their art. This means that when they perform they are fully aware that they are not only performing for themselves and their current audience, but for all past and future Kouji masters and audiences as well. Responsibilities intimately connected with this dedication are the learning of classic performances, and the commitment to passing them on to the coming generations. \nBeyond all aspects of Kouji mastery directly related to the performance and preservation of the art form, there is one additional characteristic that any true Kouji master must possess. This final characteristic is a profound understanding that everything which a Kouji master has, was given to him by the people and therefore truly belongs to them and not the master himself. Thus an intense commitment to the well being of all people is also a precursor to achieving mastery in the Chinese art form of Kouji.\n\nA key element of Chinese Kouji is the manner in which it is passed on to successive generations. This may take the form of either family inheritance, or a combination of family and master-disciple inheritance. Perhaps partially as a result of its involvement in Chinese military code talking, Kouji disciples have been limited to citizens of the Chinese state. In fact, in 1956 Zhou En Lai refused an offer by the Soviet government to exchange their two best acrobat training programs for one Kouji training program. Although the two countries were on good terms at the time, Zhou stated that Kouji was a special cultural heritage that belonged to the Chinese, and should thus be protected.\n\nA clip of two performers\n\n\n"}

It is a government sponsored national ballet of the finest percussionists, musicians, and dancers from Guinea, West Africa.\n\nThey present a performance inspired by traditional music set in a modern scenic presentation. The group is naturally oriented toward the music of the Guinean highland and the coastal region known for the djembe drum, but their influences are also drawn from the Guinea midland and the forest regions as well. In the tradition of the griots, the history of many of the ethnic groups is told through the medium of drum and dance performance. African-styled performing arts has transmitted traditional values, actual histories, and the spiritual energy of the African people for centuries.\n\nThe fifteen-member ensemble includes seven master drummers, chosen among the best soloists of Guinea's national companies, as well as members playing flute, balafon, kora, and traditional dancers.\n\nIn 1952, a world-renowned dance company called \"Les Ballets Africans\" was established by artist Keita Fodeba, who had a rich legacy of connecting the cultures of Africa with the cultures of the world. Now, some 45 years later, this important work has been taken up by Mamoudou Conde, the charismatic relative of Fodeba.\n\nBetween 1987 and 1995, the company realized many tours around the world. In 1995, following political problems, François Kokelaere left the artistic direction(management) of the group which was confided to the national ballets.\n\nSince 1994, Mamoudou has managed and directed performances in the Guinean Dance Company. In 1994, they received an award from the Rochester, New York Chamber of Commerce for their contribution to the development and promotion of the arts. This was the catalyst for the creation of World Music Production Inc. to preserve, spread, and promote the culture of Africa around the world.\n\nIn 1998, the Department of Arts and Culture of the Republic of Guinea appointed Mamoudou as the Managing Director and Producer of \"Les Percussions de Guinée\", and to represent the Ministry of Youth and Culture of the Republic of Guinea worldwide. In 2000, he also began managing \"The Djoliba National Ballet\" of the Republic of Guinea (formerly managed by Harry Belafonte). In 2001, Mamoudou signed a contract with the Guinean government to manage \"Les Ballets Africans\". In 2002, World Music Productions Inc. arranged for \"Les Percussions de Guinée\" to appear in the IMAX film, \"\". The first all-female Guinean percussion group, \"Amazones — Women Master Drummers of Guinea\", was also officially created that year. In Mamoudou Conde's words, \"it is very important that we teach our culture to everyone, especially the younger generation, so that the wisdom and value of our civilization is spread and honored throughout the world.\"\n\nThe mission of \"Les Percussions de Guinée\" is to educate the people of the world about Guinean traditional values through music, drums, Dance, and the storytelling of Africa's rich cultural legacy.\n"}

A dedicated person focusing on external influences was first seen in the 1950s on large studio features, and became common in the industry by the late 1970s.\n\nThe first job of a location manager is managing the location scouting of a project, usually supervising several scouts and assistant managers during the course of a show. A location manager will work closely with the director and the production designer during preproduction to find and secure their creative vision, and oversee additional scouts to insure that all scripted locations are accounted for. The manager is also responsible for public relations at the locations used, and the safety of the crew during filming.\n\nA \"location scout\" is responsible for the initial scouting of all the locations used in a film, and translates the writer and director’s vision for the feel of the scene into a viable and appropriate location. An experienced location scout will take into account all the logistics necessary for the production to function.\n\nSome items that a location scout must be aware of before submitting a location for approval are the budgetary restrictions of the production, local permitting fees and regulations, camera and lighting requirements, convenience to other locations, production services, crew and unit parking, and possibly incidental issues such as direction of the sun, traffic in and around the location, aircraft flight paths, weather patterns, road work, demonstrations, and even interest by local organized crime families.\n\nOnce a location has been determined to have the appropriate appearance, the location manager must schedule dates for preparation, wrap and strike, and negotiate with the property owner an appropriate fee as well as fees to neighbors and tenants that may be impacted by production. The location manager will also apply for the necessary permits through the local municipality and/or community and housing associations, arrange parking for trucks, equipment and crew, prepare temporary facilities for holding production, talent, crew and meals, and ensuring the security of the location, the safety of the crew while minimizing the impact to the surrounding community.\n\nGood location managers are well-poised and able to think on their feet as they are constantly moving, usually preceding production at a location, and overseeing final strike and wrap. They are the first and last people the public sees that represent the production, and are responsible for ensuring that the location is returned to the condition in which it was received. The location manager is also to be aware of the possible copyright issues which may be an issue if the show is filmed in a public place where there is art work or such, and where the artist has to give consent to the creation being depicted or covered or replaced by other artwork.\n\nThey need to be aware of the production's needs and know how to best accommodate them while diplomatically ensuring that the requirements of all parties, from the property owners, line producer, director and production designer, to the grip and electric teams lighting and rigging the set, and their teamster brothers with their trucks, trailers and vans.\n\nIn Hollywood, they are represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 399, and in New York and Chicago they are represented by the Directors Guild of America (DGA) for features and television work. In New York Commercials, they are represented by Teamsters Local 817. In Georgia, location managers are represented by the Teamsters Local 728. Additionally, there is the Location Managers Guild International, a non-profit organization dedicated to the promotion and interests of their members and their relations with the general public, communities and industry partners.\n\nLocation Managers are commonly associated with production as being part of the management of a show and as such, are generally paid a weekly salary as opposed to an hourly wage. The average salary can vary depending on the experience of the individual and can range from a couple hundred dollars a day on low-budget films to almost a thousand dollars a day on commercials.\n\nThe California Film Commission has recognized the work of Location Managers with the California On Location Awards (COLA) since 1995, producing an annual awards show celebrating the best Location Professional, Team, and Public Servant in Film, Television, and Commercials.\n\nThe Location Managers Guild held their inaugural awards show in 2014 to honor the outstanding creative contributions of location professionals around the world, currently held in conjunction with the AFCI Location Show in Los Angeles, CA.\n\n\n"}

Germanic \"*Þunraz\" (Þórr) is from a stem \"*\" \"thunder\", but the name \"*\" is continued in Fjörgyn, mother of Þórr.\n\n\"*\" is reconstructed on the basis of \"Perkūnas\". \"Parjanya\" is no exact cognate, see below.\n\nThe labiovelar is reconstructed due to a Centum word for \"oak\", \"coniferous tree\", or \"mountain\", \"coniferous mountain forest\", \"*\". Here also, the labiovelar is non-trivial, and indeed singular in the sequence \"*\", its justification being in Latin \"quercus\" \"oak\", the result of an assimilatory Italo-Celtic sound law changing \"*\" to \"*\" (compare \"quinque\", Irish \"cóic\" vs. Sanskrit \"\" \"five\"; \"coquo\" vs. Sanskrit \"pacati\" \"to cook\"). Celtic \"*Ercunia\", if cognate, did not partake in the assimilation, advising towards a cautious reconstruction of \"*\".\n\n\"*\", then, is the god of the \"*\", comparable to Germanic \"*Wodanaz\" being the god of the \"*wōþuz\", by virtue of the same suffix \"*\".\n\nThe original meaning of this u-stem \"\" appears to be concept of an oak, a coniferous forest, a mountain forest, or a wooded mountain:\n\nThe association with oaks can be explained by the frequency with which tall trees are struck by lightning. This is reflected in two beliefs, one being that the Norse god Thor could strike enemies hiding under an oak tree, but not under the smaller beech; the other that oak trees contained a fire within them that lightning could release (or vice versa, that the lightning transferred fire into the tree that explained why wood was effective fuel).\n\nFittingly, there was a sanctuary to Perun (now a monastery) located on a height called \"Perynь\" near Novgorod, on the northern shore of Lake Ilmen, the source of the Volkhov River. There is a Pirin mountain range is in south-western Bulgaria.\n\nAs seen from the cognates above, the name of the thunder god is only attested in Baltic, Slavic, and Germanic languages, but mythological connections of the thunderer with oaks or wooded mountains may link to the Proto-Indo-European word.\n\nFurther etymological connections were hypothesized with a verbal root \"\" \"to strike\", in reference to the thunderbolt and the violent nature of a thunder god. The name Parjanya itself could also be derived from \"*per-\", though it cannot be strictly cognate with \"*\", since Old Indic \"j\" does not reflect PIE *kʷ. A closer relationship of the verbal root to the theonym is not demonstrable, because the \"*\" extension is not otherwise attested as an Indo-European suffix, and because of the semantic distance between \"slaying\" and \"tree\" or \"mountain\".\n\nAccording to Julius Pokorny (\"IEW\"), Russian \"Perunъ\" \"thunder god\" and \"perun\" \"thunderbolt\" which likewise lack the velar element are indeed influenced by the root discussed, the activity of \"striking down\" being associated with the Balto-Slavic theonym by popular etymology.\n\n"}

In 1955, the country's first radio broadcasting service, in Arabic, first started. By 1980, the radio service broadcast up to 14 hours a day. The country's first English language radio station was later established in 1977, as a result of an increase in English speakers in Bahrain and the Persian Gulf region. The radio's programmes were primarily religious and educational, with occasional news announcements.\n\nAlmost all radio stations in Bahrain are state-owned, by the Bahrain Radio and Television Corporation though privately owned radio stations like the Hindi / Malayalam language Radio Mrichi 104.2FM, which serves the country's Indian community, operate in the country.\n\nThe British established the Bahrain Broadcasting Station in November 1940 in response to the initiation of pro-Nazi programmes being broadcast in Arabic in the Persian Gulf from 1934 to 1945. One of the earliest studies done on radio use in Bahrain assert that in 1940, there were 511 radio receivers in operation. However, radio ownership was not common among the residents, and most people went to cafés to listen to broadcasts. The station was staffed mostly with Bahrainis and its broadcasts included Quranic recitations, the national anthems of Kuwait and Bahrain, and poetry recitations, which may have been in the form of music. The station was closed down in 1945.\n\n\n"}

Samaritans suspended the Radar service following widespread criticism and a petition asking the charity to discontinue the service.\n\nSamaritans noted as justification for building the app that there is a link between posting suicidal messages on social media services and committing suicide, and that social media services are used predominantly by younger people.\n\nMany Twitter users expressed concerns about Radar, arguing that it infringed privacy, that tweets were scanned and collected without consent, and the app allowed bullies, stalkers and internet trolls to target their victims when they were at their most vulnerable.

{"id": "3675899", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3675899", "title": "School story", "text": "School story\n\nThe school story is a fiction genre centering on older pre-adolescent and adolescent school life, at its most popular in the first half of the twentieth century. While examples do exist in other countries, it is most commonly set in English boarding schools and mostly written in girls' and boys' subgenres, reflecting the single-sex education typical until the 1950s. It focuses largely on friendship, honor and loyalty between pupils. Plots involving sports events, bullies, secrets, rivalry and bravery are often used to shape the school story.\n\nThe popularity of the traditional school story declined after the Second World War, but school stories have remained popular in other forms, with a focus on state run coeducational schools, and themes involving more modern concerns such as racial issues, family life, sexuality and drugs (see Grange Hill). More recently it has seen a revival with the success of the \"Harry Potter\" series, which uses many plot motifs commonly found in the traditional school story.\n\n\"The Governess, or The Little Female Academy\" by Sarah Fielding, published in 1749, is generally seen as the first boarding school story. Fielding's novel was a moralistic tale with tangents offering instruction on behavior, and each of the nine girls in the novel relates her story individually. However, it did establish aspects of the boarding school story which were repeated in later works. The school is self-contained with little connection to local life, the girls are encouraged to live together with a sense of community and collective responsibility. Fielding's approach was imitated and used as a formula by both her contemporaries and other writers into the 19th century.\n\nSchool stories were a somewhat late arrival as a popular literature. Children as a market were generally not targeted until well into the nineteenth century. There was concern about the moral effect of novels on young minds, and those that were published tended to lean towards giving moral instruction.\n\n\"Jane Eyre\" (1847) by Charlotte Brontë, and \"Dombey and Son\" (1848) and \"David Copperfield\" (1850) by Charles Dickens had school story elements, which generated considerable public interest and close to 100 school stories had been published between 1749 and 1857, the year that \"Tom Brown's School Days\" by Thomas Hughes appeared. It is perhaps the most famous of all such tales, and its popularity helped firmly establish the genre, which rapidly expanded in the decades to follow across thousands of novels.\n\nHughes never wrote another school story: the sequel \"Tom Brown at Oxford\" focused on university life. However, more school stories followed such as F.W. Farrar's \"Eric, or, Little by Little: A Tale of Roslyn School\" (1858), Revd H.C. Adams' \"Schoolboy Honour; A Tale of Halminster College\" (1861) and A.R. Hope's \"Stories of Whitminster\" (1873). In 1870 the Education Act paved the way for universal education for children, and so gave the market for school stories a considerable boost, which led to some publishers advertising novels specifically as school stories.\n\nBoys' magazines also began to be published which featured school stories, the best known being \"Boy's Own Paper\", with its first issues appearing 1879.\n\nTalbot Baines Reed wrote a number of school stories in the 1880s, and contributed considerably to shaping the genre, taking inspiration from Thomas Hughes. His most famous work was \"The Fifth Form at St. Dominic's\" (1887) (serialised 1881–82). It was reprinted on a number of occasions, selling 750,000 copies in a 1907 edition. While seated in Baines Reed's Christian values, \"The Fifth Form at St Dominic's\" showed a definite leaning from the school story as instructional moral literature for children and with greater focus on the pupils and a defined plot.\n\nAs schools were segregated by gender in the nineteenth century, school stories naturally formed two separate but related genres of girls' school stories and boys' school stories.\n\nThere had been an increase in female schooling from the 1850s, augmented by the 1870 Education Act. L. T. Meade, who also wrote historical novels and was a magazine editor, become the most popular writer of girls' school stories in the final decade of the nineteenth century. Her stories focused on upper class pupils at boarding schools who learned to earn trust by making mistakes, they had little focus on sports and were primarily interested in friendships and loyalty. They remained largely rooted in Victorian values and preparing girls to be proper wives and mothers.\n\nMost literature for girls at the turn of the twentieth century focused on the value of self-sacrifice, moral virtues, dignity and aspiring to finding a proper position in societal order. This was to a large extent changed by the publication of Angela Brazil's girls school stories in the early twentieth century, which featured energetic characters who challenged authority, played pranks, and lived in their own youthful world in which adult concerns were sidelined.\n\nTwentieth-century boys' school stories were often comical in nature – examples being the Billy Bunter stories and the Jennings series.\n\nCoeducation remained rare in boarding school stories. Enid Blyton's Naughtiest Girl series was unusually set in a progressive coeducational school. J. K. Rowlings' Harry Potter series represents a more recent example of a mixed-sex boarding school.\n\nThe peak period for school stories was between the 1880s and the end of the Second World War. Comics featuring school stories also became popular in the 1930s.\n\nAfter World War II boarding school stories waned in popularity. Coeducational schools for all British schoolchildren were being funded by the public purse; critics, librarians and educational specialists became interested in creating a more modern curriculum and tended to see stories of this type as outdated and irrelevant. School stories have remained popular, however, with a focus shifting towards state-funded day schools with both girls and boys, and dealing with more contemporary issues such as sexuality, racism, drugs and family difficulties. The \"Bannerdale\" series of five novels (1949–56) by Geoffrey Trease, starting with \"No Boats on Bannermere\", involved two male and two female pupils of day schools in the Lake District, and a widowed mother. Trease was inspired to set the series in a day school following a letter from a young reader complaining that, despite being the setting for many school stories, boarding schools were in fact no more exciting environments than day schools. This is something remarked upon by the narrator. \n\nThe \"Harry Potter\" series of novels has in some respects revived the genre, despite having a strong leaning towards fantasy conventions. Elements of the school story prominent in \"Harry Potter\" including the action being described almost exclusively from the point of view of pupils.\n\nWhile school stories originated in Britain with \"Tom Brown's Schooldays\", school stories were also published in other countries. 'Schulromane' were popular in Germany in both the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and school stories were also published in Soviet Russia. Some American classic children's novels also relate to the genre, including \"What Katy Did at School\" (1873) by Susan Coolidge, \"Little Men\" (1871) by Louisa May Alcott and \"Little Town on the Prairie\" (1941) by Laura Ingalls Wilder. The 1980s and 1990s Sweet Valley High series by Francine Pascal and others are set in California.\n\nHowever, the core school story theme of the school as a sort of character in itself, actively formed by the pupils and their enjoyment of being there, is primarily a British and American phenomenon. In France, \"Mémoires d'Un Collégien\" (1907) by André Laurie (Jean-François Paschal Grousset), set in a boarding-school context similar to Talbot Baines Reed's St. Dominic's in England and Arthur Stanwood Pier's St. Timothy's in America, would have a considerable influence on French stories in the genre. German school stories tended to be written for adults, in the tradition of the earlier \"Bildungsroman\", and explored the disruption the school environment made to a character's sense of individuality. Soviet stories tended to focus on how individualistic behaviour could be corrected and brought into line with collective goals by the school environment. See also manga such as \"School Rumble\" and US dramas \"Beverly Hills 90210\", \"Glee\" and \"Pretty Little Liars.\n\nThe vast majority of school stories involve the culture of boarding schools in general. Common themes include honour, decency, sportsmanship and loyalty. Competitive team sports often feature and an annual sports event between rival school houses is frequently a part of the plot. Friendships between pupils are a common focus and also relationships with particular teachers, and the difficulty of new pupils fitting into the school culture is a central theme.\n\nBullies often feature in school stories, particularly boys' school stories. Identical twins appear with some frequency and are often the subject of comedy. School principals are usually even handed and wise and provide guidance to characters and will often bend the rules to get them out of trouble.\n\nEarlier in the development of the genre, school stories avoided dealing with adolescence or puberty directly. \"Eric, or, Little by Little\" by Dean Farrar was a classic moral tract set in a boarding school. Its Victorian tone was never adopted as generic convention.\n\nCommercially successful authors of school novels include writers for boys, such as P. G. Wodehouse, Anthony Buckeridge, and prolific writer Charles Hamilton, better known as Frank Richards, who wrote the Greyfriars School series, St. Jim's and Rookwood, and others for the Amalgamated Press between 1906 and 1940, his most famous character being Billy Bunter. Writers for girls include Angela Brazil, Enid Blyton, Elinor Brent-Dyer, Dorita Fairlie Bruce, Mary Gervaise and Elsie Oxenham.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He appeared with his comedy partner Oliver Hardy in 107 short films, feature films, and cameo roles.\n\nLaurel began his career in music hall, where he developed a number of his standard comic devices: the bowler hat, the deep comic gravity and the nonsensical understatement. His performances polished his skills at pantomime and music hall sketches. Laurel was a member of \"Fred Karno's Army\", where he was Charlie Chaplin's understudy. With Chaplin, the two arrived in the United States on the same ship from the United Kingdom with the Karno troupe. Laurel began his film career in 1917 and made his final appearance in 1951. From 1928 onwards, he appeared exclusively with Hardy. Laurel officially retired from the screen following his comedy partner's death in 1957.\n\nIn 1961, Laurel was given a Lifetime Achievement Academy Award for his pioneering work in comedy. He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7021 Hollywood Blvd. Laurel and Hardy ranked top among best double acts and seventh overall in a 2005 UK poll to find the \"Comedians' Comedian\". In 2009, a bronze statue of the duo was unveiled in Laurel's home town of Ulverston.\n\nArthur Stanley Jefferson was born in his grandparents' house on 16 June 1890 in Argyll Street, Ulverston, Lancashire, to Arthur Jefferson, a theatre manager from Bishop Auckland, and Margaret (née Metcalfe), an actress from Ulverston. He was one of five children.\n\nHis parents were both active in the theatre and always very busy. In his early years, the boy spent much time living with his maternal grandmother, Sarah Metcalfe. He attended school at King James I Grammar School in Bishop Auckland, County Durham, and the King's School in Tynemouth, Northumberland.\nHe moved with his parents to Glasgow, Scotland, where he completed his education at Rutherglen Academy. His father managed Glasgow's Metropole Theatre, where Laurel began work. His boyhood hero was Dan Leno, one of the greatest English music hall comedians. With a natural affinity for the theatre, Laurel gave his first professional performance on stage at the Panopticon in Glasgow at the age of sixteen, where he polished his skills at pantomime and music hall sketches. It was the music hall from where he drew his standard comic devices, including his bowler hat and nonsensical understatement.\n\nHe joined Fred Karno's troupe of actors in 1910 with the stage name of \"Stan Jefferson\"; the troupe also included a young Charlie Chaplin. The music hall nurtured him, and he acted as Chaplin's understudy for some time. Karno was a pioneer of slapstick, and in his biography Laurel stated, \"Fred Karno didn't teach Charlie [Chaplin] and me all we know about comedy. He just taught us most of it\". Chaplin and Laurel arrived in the United States on the same ship from Britain with the Karno troupe and toured the country.\nDuring the First World War, Laurel registered for military service in America on 5 June 1917, as required under the Selective Service Act. He was not called up; his registration card states resident alien and deafness as exemptions.\n\nBetween 1916 and 1918, he teamed up with Alice Cooke and Baldwin Cooke, who became his lifelong friends. Amongst other performers, Laurel worked briefly alongside Oliver Hardy before the two were a team in the silent film short \"The Lucky Dog\" (1921). It was around this time that Laurel met Mae Dahlberg. Around the same time, he adopted the stage name of Laurel at Dahlberg's suggestion that his stage name Stan Jefferson was unlucky, due to it having thirteen letters. The pair were performing together when Laurel was offered $75 a week to star in two-reel comedies. After making his first film \"Nuts in May\", Universal offered him a contract. The contract was soon cancelled during a reorganisation at the studio. Among the films in which Dahlberg and Laurel appeared together was the 1922 parody \"Mud and Sand\".\n\nBy 1924, Laurel had given up the stage for full-time film work, under contract with Joe Rock for 12 two-reel comedies. The contract had one unusual stipulation: that Dahlberg was not to appear in any of the films. Rock thought that her temperament was hindering Laurel's career. In 1925, she started interfering with Laurel's work, so Rock offered her a cash settlement and a one-way ticket back to her native Australia, which she accepted. The 12 two-reel comedies were \"Mandarin Mix-Up\" (1924), \"Detained\" (1924), \"Monsieur Don't Care\" (1924), \"West of Hot Dog\" (1924), \"Somewhere in Wrong\" (1925), \"Twins\" (1925), \"Pie-Eyed\" (1925), \"The Snow Hawk\" (1925), \"Navy Blue Days\" (1925), \"The Sleuth\" (1925), \"Dr. Pyckle and Mr. Pryde\" (1925), \"Half a Man\" (1925).\n\nLaurel next signed with the Hal Roach studio, where he began directing films, including a 1926 production called \"Yes, Yes, Nanette\". He intended to work primarily as a writer and director.\n\nOliver Hardy, another member of the Hal Roach Studios Comedy \"All Star\" players, was injured in a kitchen mishap in 1927, and Laurel was asked to return to acting. Laurel and Hardy began sharing the screen in \"Slipping Wives\", \"Duck Soup\" (1927), and \"With Love and Hisses\". The two became friends and their comic chemistry soon became obvious. Roach Studios' supervising director Leo McCarey noticed the audience reaction to them and began teaming them, leading to the creation of the \"Laurel and Hardy\" series later that year.\n\nTogether, the two men began producing a huge body of short films, including \"The Battle of the Century\", \"Should Married Men Go Home?\", \"Two Tars\", \"Be Big!\", \"Big Business\", and many others. Laurel and Hardy successfully made the transition to talking films with the short \"Unaccustomed As We Are\" in 1929. They also appeared in their first feature in one of the revue sequences of \"The Hollywood Revue of 1929,\" and the following year they appeared as the comic relief in the lavish all-colour (in Technicolor) musical feature \"The Rogue Song\". Their first starring feature \"Pardon Us\" was released in 1931. They continued to make both features and shorts until 1935, including their 1932 three-reeler \"The Music Box,\" which won an Academy Award for Best Short Subject.\n\nDuring the 1930s, Laurel was involved in a dispute with Hal Roach which resulted in the termination of his contract. Roach maintained separate contracts for Laurel and Hardy that expired at different times, so Hardy remained at the studio and was \"teamed\" with Harry Langdon for the 1939 film \"Zenobia\". The studio discussed a series of films co-starring Hardy with Patsy Kelly to be called \"The Hardy Family.\" But Laurel sued Roach over the contract dispute. Eventually, the case was dropped and Laurel returned to Roach. The first film that Laurel and Hardy made after Laurel returned was \"A Chump at Oxford\". Subsequently, they made \"Saps at Sea\", which was their last film for Roach.\n\nIn 1941, Laurel and Hardy signed a contract at 20th Century Fox to make ten films over five years. During the war years, their work became more standardised and less successful, though \"The Bullfighters\" and \"Jitterbugs\" did receive some praise.\n\nRevisiting his music hall days, Laurel returned to England in 1947 when he and Hardy went on a six-week tour of the United Kingdom performing in variety shows. Mobbed wherever they went, Laurel's homecoming to Ulverston took place in May, and the duo were greeted by thousands of fans outside the Coronation Hall. The \"Evening Mail\" noted: \"Oliver Hardy remarked to our reporter that Stan had talked about Ulverston for the past 22 years and he thought he had to see it.\" The tour included a \"Royal Variety Performance\" infront of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in London. The success of the tour led them to spend the next seven years touring the UK and Europe.\n\nAround this time, Laurel found out that he had diabetes, so he encouraged Hardy to find solo projects which he did, taking parts in John Wayne and Bing Crosby films.\n\nIn 1950, Laurel and Hardy were invited to France to make a feature film. The film was a disaster, a Franco-Italian co-production titled \"Atoll K\". (The film was entitled \"Utopia\" in the US and \"Robinson Crusoeland\" in the UK.) Both stars were noticeably ill during the filming. Upon returning to the United States, they spent most of their time recovering. In 1952, Laurel and Hardy toured Europe successfully, and they returned in 1953 for another tour of the continent. During this tour, Laurel fell ill and was unable to perform for several weeks.\n\nIn May 1954, Hardy had a heart attack and cancelled the tour. In 1955, they were planning to do a television series called \"Laurel and Hardy's Fabulous Fables\" based on children's stories. The plans were delayed after Laurel suffered a stroke on 25 April 1955, from which he recovered. But as the team was planning to get back to work, his partner Hardy had a massive stroke on 14 September 1956, which resulted in his being unable to return to acting.\n\nOliver Hardy died on 7 August 1957. Laurel was too ill to attend his funeral and said, \"Babe would understand\". People who knew Laurel said that he was devastated by Hardy's death and never fully recovered from it. He refused to perform on stage or act in another film without his friend, although he continued to socialise with his fans.\n\nIn 1961, Stan Laurel was given a Lifetime Achievement Academy Award for his pioneering work in comedy. He had achieved his lifelong dream as a comedian and had been involved in nearly 190 films. He lived his final years in a small flat in the Oceana Apartments in Santa Monica, California.\n\nLaurel was always gracious to fans and spent much time answering fan mail. His phone number was listed in the telephone directory, and fans were amazed that they could dial the number and speak to him directly.\n\nJerry Lewis was among the numerous comedians to visit Laurel, who offered suggestions for Lewis's production of \"The Bellboy\" (1960). Lewis paid tribute to Laurel by naming his main character Stanley in the film, and having Bill Richmond play a version of Laurel as well. Dick Van Dyke told a similar story. When he was just starting his career, he looked up Laurel's phone number, called him, and then visited him at his home. Van Dyke played Laurel on \"The Sam Pomerantz Scandals\" episode of \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\".\n\nLaurel was offered a cameo role in \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\" (1963), but turned it down. He did not want to be on screen in his old age, especially without Hardy.\n\nLaurel and Mae Charlotte Dahlberg never married, but lived together as common-law husband and wife from 1919 to 1925, before Dahlberg accepted a one-way ticket from Joe Rock to go back to her native Australia. In November 1937, Dahlberg was back in the USA and sued the now successful Stan Laurel for financial support. At the time, Laurel's second marriage was in the process of a divorce, with Dahlberg's legal suit adding to Laurel's woes. The matter was settled out of court. Dahlberg was described as a \"relief project worker\" by the court.\n\nLaurel had four wives and married one of them a second time after their divorce.\n\nLaurel married his first wife, Lois Neilson, on 13 August 1926. On 10 December 1927, during the early years of Laurel and Hardy's partnership, Laurel and Neilson had a baby daughter, also named Lois. In May 1930, their second child, a son named Stanley, was born two months premature and died after nine days. Laurel's daughter Lois died on 27 July 2017, aged 89. Laurel and Neilson divorced in December 1934.\n\nIn 1935, Laurel married Virginia Ruth Rogers (known as Ruth). In 1937, Laurel filed for divorce from Ruth, confessing that he was not over his ex-wife Lois, but Lois decided against a reconciliation. On New Year's Day 1938, Laurel married Vera Ivanova Shuvalova (known as Illeana), leading to an irate Ruth accusing Stan of bigamy, but their divorce had been finalised a couple of days before his new marriage. The new marriage was very volatile. Illeana accused him of trying to bury her alive in the backyard of their San Fernando Valley home. He and Illeana separated in 1939 and divorced in 1940, with Illeana surrendering all claim to the Laurel surname on 1 February 1940, in exchange for $6,500. In 1941, Laurel remarried Virginia Ruth Rogers, with Laurel and Ruth divorcing for the second time in early 1946.\n\nOn 6 May 1946, Laurel married Ida Kitaeva Raphael, to whom he remained married until his death.\n\nLaurel was a heavy smoker until suddenly quitting around 1960. In January 1965, he underwent a series of x-rays for an infection on the roof of his mouth. He died on 23 February 1965, aged 74, four days after suffering a heart attack on 19 February. Minutes before his death, Laurel told his nurse that he would not mind going skiing; surprised, the nurse replied that she was not aware that he was a skier. \"I'm not,\" said Laurel, \"I'd rather be doing that than this!\" A few minutes later, the nurse looked in on him again and found that he had died quietly in his armchair.\n\nAt his funeral, silent screen comedian Buster Keaton was overheard talking about Laurel's talent: \"Chaplin wasn't the funniest, I wasn't the funniest, this man was the funniest.\" Dick Van Dyke gave the eulogy at Laurel's funeral, as a friend, protégé, and occasional impressionist of Laurel during his later years; he read \"The Clown's Prayer\". Laurel had earlier quipped: \"If anyone at my funeral has a long face, I'll never speak to him again.\" Laurel was cremated and his ashes were interred in Forest Lawn–Hollywood Hills Cemetery.\n\nLaurel and Hardy are featured on the cover of the Beatles' album \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" (1967). In 1989, a statue of Laurel was erected in Dockwray Square, North Shields, Tyne and Wear, England, where he lived at No. 8 from 1897 to 1902. The steps down from the Square to the North Shields Fish Quay were said to have inspired the piano-moving scene in \"The Music Box\". In a 2005 UK poll, \"Comedians' Comedian\", Laurel and Hardy were ranked top double act, and seventh overall. Along with Hardy, Laurel was inducted into the Grand Order of Water Rats.\n\nNeil Brand wrote a radio play entitled \"Stan\", broadcast in 2004 on BBC Radio 4 and subsequently on BBC Radio 4 Extra, starring Tom Courtenay as Stan Laurel, in which Stan visits Oliver Hardy after Hardy has suffered his stroke and tries to say the things to his dying friend and partner that have been left unsaid. In 2006, BBC Four showed a drama called \"Stan\", based on Brand's radio play, in which Laurel meets Hardy on his deathbed and reminisces about their career.\n\nA plaque on the Bull Inn, Bottesford, Leicestershire, England, marks Laurel and Hardy appearing in Nottingham over Christmas 1952, and staying with Laurel's sister, Olga, who was the landlady of the pub. In 2008, a statue of Stan Laurel was unveiled in Bishop Auckland, County Durham, on the site of the Eden Theatre. In April 2009, a bronze statue of Laurel and Hardy was unveiled in Ulverston.\nThere is a Laurel and Hardy Museum in Stan's hometown of Ulverston. There are two Laurel and Hardy museums in Hardy's hometown of Harlem, Georgia. One is operated by the town of Harlem, and the other is a private museum owned and operated by Gary Russeth, a Harlem resident.\n\nIn 2013, Gail Louw and Jeffrey Holland debuted a short one-man play \"...And this is my friend Mr Laurel\" at the Camden Fringe festival. The play, starring Holland as Laurel, was taken on tour of the UK in 2014 until June 2015.\n\nIn a 2018 film, \"Stan & Ollie\", Laurel is played by English comedian Steve Coogan, and Hardy by American actor John C. Reilly. Developed by BBC Films, the film is set in the twilight of their careers, and focuses on their farewell tour of Britain's variety halls in 1953.\n\n\n"}

The series premiered on Showtime on 12 May 2016.\n\nThe series follows the journey of Ashley (Ashlynn Yennie) from being in an unhappy relationship to her exploration of BDSM when she stumbles upon an erotic novel \"SLAVE\" by Nolan Keats.\n\n\n\nThe series co-creator, Jacky St. James, mentioned that she was unhappy with the way BDSM was portrayed in \"Fifty Shades of Grey\", which she considers \"passed off an abusive relationship as an honest interpretation of the BDSM lifestyle\". She hoped to create a more nuanced view of the BDSM world with the series. In an interview with GQ, she described the series as, \"imperfect people in BDSM relationships.\" The lead actress Ashlynn Yennie also echoed the creator's sentiment saying, \"\"Fifty Shades of Grey\" was not a correct portrayal of the type of sex that people practice. It made it seem like it was for people that were messed up or dark and it’s not at all.\" She hoped that the show \"can shatter that glass ceiling of false belief and show the world what it truly means to trust, communicate, and finally feel free to talk about what you want and don’t want sexually in a consensual and healthy way.\"\n\nThe trailer for the series was released on 29 April 2016.\n\nThe series debuted with low viewership of 0.01 share and 55,000 viewers.

Stern, Spencer Stone, Anthony Sadler, and Alek Skarlatos. The film stars Stone, Sadler, and Skarlatos as themselves and follows the trio as they stop the 2015 Thalys train attack; Judy Greer and Jenna Fischer also star.\n\n\"The 15:17 to Paris\" was released in the United States on February 9, 2018, by Warner Bros. Pictures. It received mixed reviews from critics, who called it \"well-intentioned\" but \"strained to wring a full-length feature's worth of drama out of [an event] that was over in a few minutes\", and grossed $57 million worldwide against a production budget of $30 million.\n\nSpencer Stone and Alek Skarlatos are attending a suburban Christian middle school. They bond over their interest in guns, and are often sent to the principal's office for disciplinary action. Once, while sent to the principal's office, they meet another student, who often misbehaves in school, Anthony Sadler, and the three become friends. Spencer and Alek are from single mother homes, and their mothers often stick up for them when called to the principal's office regarding their misconduct.\n\nWhile working part time at a smoothie shop, Spencer waits on a recruiter for the United States Marine Corps. He asks the recruiter what military branch he would select if he could go back. The recruiter replies that the Air Force pararescue save lives and \"seem to being doing fine work in the field.\" Spencer is intrigued and decides that he wants to join up. So he begins working out to lose some extra weight. After several months of rigorous training and exercise, he gets into much better shape and enlists in the Air Force in hopes of becoming a Pararescueman.\n\nUpon completing basic training, Spencer takes his exams to qualify for pararescue school. But having poor depth perception, he is turned down. Upset, he chooses from the other Air Force options left to him, and is soon stationed abroad. His friend, Alek, enlisted in the Army, and has been deployed to Afghanistan. On Skype, Alek tells him that he is planning to visit his girlfriend in Germany, and the two decide to rendezvous there for their next leave. Spencer skypes Anthony, now a college student, and talks him into coming to Europe for a vacation, visiting Italy. Afterwards, the three meet in Germany and decide to go to Amsterdam. After a few days there, they finally decide to visit France after deliberation. They depart from Amsterdam Centraal station on the 15:17 train to Paris.\n\nOn the train, all seems well, until American-born Frenchman Mark Moogalian notices that one of the toilets has been occupied for an unusually long time. When he goes to investigate, a terrorist bursts out with an assault rifle. Another passenger, Damien A., grabs the terrorist by the neck and Moogalian manages to wrest the rifle from the terrorist but is then shot in the back with a 9mm pistol. Passengers begin to flee out of their seats and rush toward the forward cabins of the train, trying to escape. Eventually, the terrorist approaches the next car, where Spencer and his friends are sitting. The moment Spencer sees him, he springs into action. He decides that his only hope, and the only hope of the remaining passengers, is for him to try to defeat the terrorist. Spencer makes a desperate all-out sprint toward the terrorist in the hope of subduing him before being shot. By remarkable luck, the terrorist's weapon jams just as he is about to fire, and he is tackled by Spencer, who successfully disarms the terrorist of his weapon. Seeing Spencer's progress in subduing the terrorist, Alek, Anthony, and other passengers join the effort to try to further overwhelm the terrorist, finally knocking him out. Spencer then stanches the bleeding by plugging the exit wound in Moogalian's neck with his fingers. The police at the next station enter the train fully armed, discovering that Spencer has subdued the terrorist, and they begin to treat his wounds, and the more serious ones of the shot passenger. Paramedics take Moogalian to the emergency room at a local hospital and he survives.\n\nIn a formal ceremony, Spencer, Alek and Anthony are recognized as heroes of France for their gallantry and bravery. The terrorist was later discovered to have been armed with over 300 rounds of ammunition with the apparent aim of using all of it to wreak havoc on all those who boarded the train. The odds of the particular misfire and jam of the cartridge in the terrorist's weapon was estimated on the scene as being over a thousand-to-one, and highly unlikely to have been in Spencer's favor. French officials at the ceremony to honor Spencer's selfless act acknowledge his bravery and he is awarded the French Legion of Honour in recognition of his act of courage. On September 22, 2015, Mark Moogalian was awarded the Legion of Honor by President François Hollande for his actions on the train.\n\n\nAdditionally, Paul-Mikel Williams, Max Ivutin, Bryce Gheisar, Cole Eichenberger, and William Jennings portray younger versions of Stone, Sadler, and Skarlatos.\n\nOn April 20, 2017, it was announced that Clint Eastwood would next direct \"The 15:17 to Paris\" from a screenplay by newcomer screenwriter Dorothy Blyskal based on the book \"The 15:17 to Paris: The True Story of a Terrorist, a Train, and Three American Heroes\". It was announced that Eastwood would begin casting immediately for a principal production start date of later that year. On June 21, 2017, it was announced that Eastwood had chosen Kyle Gallner, Jeremie Harris and Alexander Ludwig to star as Alek Skarlatos, Anthony Sadler and Spencer Stone although offers had not yet been made. \n\nOn July 11, 2017, it was announced that Eastwood had cast Sadler, Skarlatos and Stone as themselves in the film which will \"begin during their childhood and show their friendship leading up to the moment that changed their lives\". It was also announced that the film had commenced principal production. On July 13, 2017, Tony Hale and Thomas Lennon joined the cast as staff members of a school the lead three men attended as children. On August 1, 2017, Sinqua Walls was cast in the film for an unspecified role.\nMark Moogalian and Isabelle Risacher Moogalian were also cast as themselves in the film.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on February 9, 2018. The film was originally rated R by the MPAA for \"a sequence of violence and bloody images\", but received a PG-13 rating upon appeal. \n\n\"The 15:17 To Paris\" was released on HD digital copies on May 1, 2018. The film was then released on Blu-Ray and DVD on May 22, 2018.\n\n\"The 15:17 to Paris\" grossed $36.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $20.6 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $56.9 million, against a production budget of $30 million.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the film was released alongside \"Peter Rabbit\" and \"Fifty Shades Freed\", and was projected to gross $10–15 million from 3,042 theaters in its opening weekend. It ended up making $12.6 million, finishing third at the box office behind its two fellow releases. The film dropped 40% in its second weekend to $7.6 million ($8.9 million over the four-day Martin Luther King Jr. weekend), finishing fifth.\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 24% based on 144 reviews, and an average rating of 4.3/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"The 15:17 to Paris\" pays clumsily well-intentioned tribute to an act of heroism, but by casting the real-life individuals involved, director Clint Eastwood fatally undermines his own efforts.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 45 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B–\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nWriting for Showbiz411, Roger Friedman acknowledged the film's attempts to be different by casting the real-life men and said, \"If there’s a problem with \"15:17\" it’s that it’s almost filmed like cinéma vérité, certainly as the story unfolds. There’s a lot of exposition and it seems slow. Again, a little patience wouldn’t hurt anyone. Because when the kids’ backstories switch to the main guys, Eastwood finds a groove. Forgive him if the entry seems clunky.\" Similarly, A. O. Scott of \"The New York Times\" gave the film a positive review and wrote, \"But [Eastwood's] workmanlike absorption in the task at hand is precisely what makes this movie fascinating as well as moving. Its radical plainness is tinged with mystery.\" Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com gave the film two out of four stars, stating that \"[a] good 70% of [\"The 15:17 to Paris\"] is inert, its affable nothingness redeemed only by the laid-back charisma of three men\", although he praised the film's \"poker-faced sincerity\" and the \"superb\" climactic train scene.\n\n"}

{"id": "88582", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=88582", "title": "The Partridge Family", "text": "The Partridge Family\n\nThe Partridge Family is an American musical sitcom starring Shirley Jones and featuring David Cassidy. Jones played a widowed mother, and Cassidy played the oldest of her five children who embarked on a music career. It ran from September 25, 1970, until March 23, 1974, on the ABC network as part of a Friday-night lineup, and had subsequent runs in syndication. The family was loosely based on the real-life musical family The Cowsills, a popular band in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nIn the pilot episode, a group of musical siblings in the fictitious city of San Pueblo, California (said to be \"40 miles from Napa County\" in episode 24, \"A Partridge By Any Other Name\") convinces their widowed mother, bank teller Shirley Partridge, to help them out by singing as they record a pop song in their garage. Through the efforts of precocious 10-year-old Danny they find a manager, Reuben Kincaid, who helps make the song a Top 40 hit. After more persuading, Shirley agrees that the family can go on tour. They acquire an old school bus, a 1957 Chevrolet Series 6800 Superior, for touring, paint it with Mondrian-inspired patterns, and head to Las Vegas, Nevada for their first live gig at Caesars Palace.\n\nSubsequent episodes usually feature the band performing in various venues or in their garage. The shows often contrast suburban life with the adventures of a show-business family on the road. After the first season, more of the show's action takes place in their hometown than on tour.\n\n\"The Partridge Family\" was created for television by Bernard Slade; the series' executive producer was Bob Claver. The show was inspired by and loosely based on The Cowsills, a family pop music group that was famous in the late 1960s. In the show's early development, the Cowsill children were considered by the producers, but because the Cowsills were not trained actors and were too old for the roles as scripted, Slade and Claver abandoned that idea. Shirley Jones had already been signed as mother Shirley Partridge and star of the show.\n\nThe pilot was filmed in December 1969. This unaired pilot differs from the pilot broadcast in 1970. In the unaired pilot, Shirley's name is \"Connie\" and she has a boyfriend played by Jones' real-life husband at the time, Jack Cassidy, father of David Cassidy. Laurie mentions her late father once getting drunk at a Christmas party, and the family has a different address and live in Ohio.\n\nThe show proved popular, but the fame took its toll on several, if not most, of the starring cast, particularly David Cassidy. In the midst of his rise to fame, Cassidy soon felt stifled by the show and trapped by the mass hysteria surrounding his every move. In May 1972, he appeared nude on the cover of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine in a cropped Annie Leibovitz photo. He used the article to get away from his squeaky clean image. Among other things, the article mentions Cassidy was riding around New York in the back of a car \"stoned and drunk.\"\n\nShortly after the series ended, scriptwriter Roberta Tatum launched a lawsuit against Screen Gems concerning the creation of the show. Tatum claimed that she had submitted a similar premise to Screen Gems prior to 1970 called \"Baker's Half-Dozen\". The matter was resolved out of court, with Tatum receiving a reported $150,000 from Screen Gems.\n\nOn the show's soundtrack and records, none of the actors actually played the indicated instruments, and only Jones and primarily Cassidy sang. The actors pretended while listening to recordings by session musicians who provided the real vocal and instrumental music attributed to The Partridge Family.\n\nDuring its four-season run, many actors made guest appearances on the show. Some of them were well known at the time, such as Morey Amsterdam, John Astin, Carl Ballantine, John Banner, Edgar Buchanan, George Chakiris, Dick Clark (who later hosted \"The Other Half\" from 2001 to 2003 with Danny Bonaduce), Jackie Coogan, Howard Cosell, Jodie Foster, Bernard Fox, Ned Glass, James Gregory, Margaret Hamilton, Pat Harrington Jr., Arte Johnson, Harvey Lembeck, Art Metrano, Mary Ann Mobley, Harry Morgan, Slim Pickens, Richard Pryor, Barbara Rhoades, William Schallert, Nita Talbot, Larry Wilcox, Dick Wilson, and William Windom. Others would later become famous in other roles, such as Meredith Baxter, Richard Bull, Bert Convy, Farrah Fawcett, Norman Fell, Anthony Geary, Louis Gossett Jr., Harold Gould, Jackie Earle Haley, Mark Hamill, Season Hubley, Ann Jillian, Gordon Jump, Cheryl Ladd, Michael Lembeck, William Lucking, Stuart Margolin, Richard Mulligan, Michael Ontkean, Noam Pitlik, Annette O'Toole, Charlotte Rae, Rob Reiner, Jack Riley, Jaclyn Smith, Vic Tayback, Nancy Walker, and Frank Welker.\nCountry singer Johnny Cash made an uncredited cameo appearance in the pilot episode. Ray Bolger played Shirley's father in three episodes, and Rosemary DeCamp played Shirley's mother in four episodes. Then-Governor Ronald Reagan's daughter, Maureen Reagan, was also featured in one episode. Future \"Charlie's Angels\" stars Jaclyn Smith, Farrah Fawcett and Cheryl Ladd all made guest appearances on separate episodes.\n\nBobby Sherman appeared in the last episode of the first season (Episode 25) as struggling songwriter Bobby Conway. This episode led into a short-lived spinoff series on ABC, \"Getting Together\", starring Sherman and Wes Stern as Bobby Conway's business partner Lionel Poindexter.\n\nAt the end of the first season, Jeremy Gelbwaks' family moved out of the Los Angeles area, and the part of Chris was recast with actor Brian Forster. According to David Cassidy, Gelbwaks \"had a personality conflict with every person in the cast and the producers\" and especially did not get along with Cassidy or Bonaduce. A dog named Simone was featured in the first season, but it was phased out during the second season. At the beginning of the fourth season, a four-year-old neighbor, Ricky Stevens (Ricky Segall), was featured and would sing a children's song during each episode, but the character was dropped mid-season.\n\nMusic recorded for the pilot episode was produced by Monkees' producer Shorty Rogers. Songs for the ongoing series were recorded by music producer Wes Farrell.\n\nThe Partridge Family songs heard in the show, and on the several Partridge Family singles and albums, were not performed as seen on-screen. Actor David Cassidy sang lead on most of the records, and actor Shirley Jones can be heard on a few. But the other voices and all the instruments were recorded by session musicians.\n\nThe Partridge Family's instrumental sound was provided by musicians informally known as The Wrecking Crew, who did many of the pop hits of the day attributed to other performers. The actors pretended to play their instruments.\n\nNone of the actors sang background; they lip-synched to recorded singing by the Ron Hicklin Singers, composed of brothers John and Tom Bahler, Jackie Ward (who as Robin Ward had a #14 hit \"Wonderful Summer\" on Dot Records in 1963 ), and Ron Hicklin.\n\nActor David Cassidy was originally to lip sync with the rest of the cast, but convinced Farrell that he could sing and was allowed to join the studio ensemble as the lead singer. He and his step-mother, Shirley, are the only two show actors allowed to sing for recording.\n\n\"The Partridge Family\" theme song, produced by Rogers, was shown over opening credits. More than one song was used as the theme song. Season 1 episodes feature the song \"When We're Singin'\", which was replaced in subsequent seasons with \"C'mon Get Happy\".\n\n<poem>\"Five of us, and Mom working all day,\nwe knew we could help her if our music would pay,\nDanny got Reuben to sell our song, and it really\ncame together when Mom sang along...\" \"(from \"When We're Singin'\")\"</poem>\n\nLater, under Farrell's direction, the new version had new lyrics sung to the \"When We're Singin'\" tune. With the new chorus finalized, \"C'mon Get Happy\" showcased the new verse:\n\n<poem>\n\"We had a dream, we'd go travelin' together,\nWe'd spread a little lovin' then we'd keep movin' on.\nSomethin' always happens whenever we're together\nWe get a happy feelin' when we're singing a song...\" \"(from \"C'Mon Get Happy\")\"</poem>\n\nFor its final season, ABC moved the show from its 8:30 pm Friday night slot (where it rated first in its timeslot) to Saturday at 8:00 pm (opposite CBS' top-rated \"All in the Family\", with which it could not compete successfully). In the UK, the first three episodes were broadcast in a Friday children's slot of 17:20, starting on 17/09/1971. From 02/10/1971, the programme moved to Saturdays at 17:10, and eight episodes were shown at this time. A further episode was shown on New Year's Eve, after which the BBC dropped the programme. After David Cassidy succeeded with UK Top 30 chart hits the following year, the show was picked up by independent commercial television. On London Weekend Television, it was shown on Saturday lunchtimes. After the show's popularity began to decline in the US, it began to increase in the UK. This new popularity in the UK gave them five UK Top 20 Hits, some of which were less popular in the States.\n\nAfter 96 episodes and eight Partridge Family albums, ABC canceled the show.\n\nNickelodeon featured a run of \"The Partridge Family\" from 1993 to 1994 as part of its Nick at Nite lineup. The network used interviews and commercials featuring cast members, and created a new version of the bus for promotion. The show also aired at various times on USA Network, Fox Family, Ion Television, and Hallmark Channel. , it airs on Antenna TV. FETV also started airing \"The Partridge Family\" in December 2017.\n\nThe cast was reunited in 1977 on the special \"Thanksgiving Reunion with The Partridge Family and My Three Sons\". Reunited again in the 1990s on \"The Arsenio Hall Show\" and \"The Danny Bonaduce Show\" and were featured on \"E! True Hollywood Story\", \"Biography\" and VH1's \"Behind the Music\".\n\nWhen the digital subchannel Antenna TV premiered in January 2011, \"The Partridge Family\" became one of its offerings through the network's distribution agreement with Sony Pictures Television (parent company and successor of series producer Screen Gems).\n\n\"The Partridge Family\" was produced for ABC by Screen Gems. The company promoted the show by releasing a series of albums featuring the family band, though David Cassidy and Shirley Jones, who sang background, were the only cast members who were actually featured on the recordings.\n\nAs the show and other associated merchandising soared, David Cassidy became a teen idol. The producers signed Cassidy as a solo act as well. Cassidy began touring with his own group of musicians, performing Partridge songs as well as hits from his own albums, to thousands of screaming teenagers in major stadiums across the USA, UK, Europe, Japan and Australia.\n\nThe Partridge Family's biggest hit came in 1970 with the song \"I Think I Love You\", written by Tony Romeo (who had previously written several of the Cowsills' hits), peaked at Number 1 on the \"Billboard\" charts in December of that year. It sold over five million copies, outselling the Beatles' \"Let It Be\", was awarded a gold disc, and made the group the third fictional artist to have a No. 1 hit (after The Chipmunks and The Archies). The song's companion LP, \"The Partridge Family Album\", reached Number 4 in the \"Billboard\" 200. It was also awarded a gold disc by the RIAA in December 1970, having sold over 500,000 copies. A string of hit Partridge singles followed: \"Doesn't Somebody Want to Be Wanted\", \"I'll Meet You Halfway\", \"I Woke Up In Love This Morning\", \"It's One of Those Nights (Yes Love)\", \"Am I Losing You\", \"Looking Through the Eyes of Love\", \"Breaking Up Is Hard to Do\", and \"A Friend and a Lover\". These singles were showcased on million-selling albums including \"Up To Date\", \"Sound Magazine\", \"Shopping Bag\", \"Notebook\", \"Crossword Puzzle\", and \"Bulletin Board\". Their holiday album \"A Partridge Family Christmas Card\" was the No. 1 selling Christmas record of 1971. Record sales success was replicated internationally, with both The Partridge Family (group) and David Cassidy (solo) achieving huge hits in Canada, Great Britain, Europe, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. In all, The Partridge Family released 89 songs on 9 albums between 1970 and 1973.\n\nThough Danny Bonaduce was not part of the session band, he also got a recording contract, and released a self-titled album in 1972, \"Danny Bonaduce\". Though Bonaduce was credited as lead singer on all songs, he insists that he had a weak voice and that Bruce Roberts provided most of the vocals on the album. The first track, \"I'll Be Your Magician\", in which the 13-year-old Bonaduce seduces a woman into having sexual intercourse with him, has developed a cult following for its campy entertainment value. The original, watered-down, version was recorded with Cassidy for the \"Sound Magazine\" album, but was discarded and never released. In fall 2010, Cassidy dared Bonaduce to learn how to play the bass guitar lines on the songs the Partridge Family performed. Bonaduce learned the bass guitar line for \"Doesn't Somebody Want to Be Wanted\", stating that although he had no ability to read music, the song was relatively easy to learn; Cassidy and Bonaduce subsequently performed together on rare occasions.\n\nIn conjunction with the songs featured by Ricky Segall in the fourth season of the TV show, Bell Records released the album \"Ricky Segall and The Segalls\" in 1973. Seven of the album's ten tracks were featured on the TV show. Two tracks were also released as a single: \"Sooner or Later\"/\"Say Hey Willie\" (Bell 45429).\n\nThe Partridges had a brief resurgence in animated form which saw the family propelled into the future. The animated Partridges first appeared when the kids did a series of guest spots on \"Goober and the Ghost Chasers\". That idea evolved into a CBS Saturday morning Hanna-Barbera-produced cartoon in 1974, \"Partridge Family 2200 A.D.\" (also called \"The Partridge Family in Outer Space\" when rerun later as part of \"Fred Flintstone and Friends\"). Shirley Jones and David Cassidy did not voice their animated characters and Susan Dey and Dave Madden had very limited involvement with this cartoon.\n\nReleased in 1971 by Milton Bradley, The Partridge Family Game offers a glimpse of what life on the road was like for one of TV’s favorite fictional pop bands. The back of the box explains, “As on TV, many happenings occur to the Partridge family, this game describes one of them. They have finished playing at a local arena and must hurry to their BUS to get traveling again. On the way, they may have some delays.” The object of the game is to be the first player to get back to the tour bus.\n\nCharlton Comics produced a comic book featuring The Partridge Family between March 1971 and December 1973. It features stories about the characters, song lyrics and features about David Cassidy. The drawings were provided by Don Sherwood.\n\nThree years after the show's cancellation, Shirley Jones and other cast members gathered with cast members of \"My Three Sons\" for the ABC special \"Thanksgiving Reunion with The Partridge Family and My Three Sons\", that aired on November 25, 1977. The show featured the casts discussing the histories of their shows, although other than Jones and Fred MacMurray both portraying single parents of large families, the two series had no narrative link.\n\nIn 1995, a majority of the cast appeared on Bonaduce's talk show \"Danny!\", including Shirley Jones, Dave Madden, Jeremy Gelbwaks, Brian Forster, Suzanne Crough, Ricky Segall and the show's executive producer Bob Claver. Susan Dey was working on a movie at the time but called into the show to briefly reminisce with Bonaduce. David Cassidy was also unable to appear as he was working on a new album at that time.\n\nIn 2004, VH1 produced a pilot for a syndicated \"The New Partridge Family\", starring Suzanne Sole as Shirley, Leland Grant as Keith, Emma Stone as Laurie and Spencer Tuskowski as Danny. The pilot was the only episode produced.\n\nSony Pictures Home Entertainment has released all 4 Seasons of \"The Partridge Family\" in DVD Region 1. Seasons 1 and 2 have been released in Regions 2 and 4.\n\nOn October 15, 2013, Sony released \"The Partridge Family – The Complete Series\" on DVD in Region 1. The 12-disc set features all 96 episodes of the series as well as bonus features.\n\nThe Screen Gems closing logo was removed from episodes for the first three seasons on DVD.\n\nOn August 27, 2013, it was announced that Mill Creek Entertainment had acquired the rights to various television series from the Sony Pictures library including The Partridge Family. They subsequently re-released the first two seasons on June 24, 2014.\n\nOn September 22, 2015, Mill Creek re-released \"Partridge Family- The Complete Series\" on DVD in Region 1 with the original Screen Gems logo reinstated at the end of the credits. No U.S. DVD releases contain the epilogue to episode #25 (which does appear on Region 2 & 4 releases), nor the unaired 1969 pilot, nor any episodes of the spin-off series \"Getting Together\".\n\n\n\n"}

The definition of what constitutes transmediation would depend on how medium is defined or interpreted. In Understanding media, Marshall McLuhan offered a quite broad of medium \"an extension of ourselves\": \"In a culture like ours, long accustomed to splitting and dividing all things as a means of control, it is sometimes a bit of a shock to be reminded that, in operational and practical fact, the medium is the message. This is merely to say that the personal and social consequences of any medium - that is, of any extension of ourselves - result from the new scale that is introduced into our affairs by each extension of ourselves, or by any new technology.\" From McLuhan's definition, it is possible to infer the definition of transmediation could involve at least two different dimensions: a sensory and semiotic translation. When referring to medium as a sensory mode, transmediation would require to move between sensory modes (e.g., visual to aural, aural to tactile). When referring to transmediation as semiotic translation, transmediation can refer to the process of \"responding to cultural texts in a range of sign systems -- art, movement, sculpture, dance, music, and so on -- as well as in words.\" Semali and Fueyo \n\nTransmediation may utilize more than one media form. All the components of a transmediated work are interlinked with each other to form the whole network. Therefore, transmediated works are closely linked to semiotics and technology in the context of digital media. Transmediation can include response to traditional printed texts, as well as multimedia materials including video, animation, a website, a podcast, a game, etc.\n\nTransmediation is closely linked to semiotics, which is the impact study of signs. Academic researchers and educators interested in transmediation are often also interested in media literacy, visual literacy, information literacy, and critical literacy.\n\nLeonard Shlain highlights the importance of engaging students in the process of transmediation when writing, \"Digital information comes in multiple forms, and students must learn to tell stories not just with words and numbers but also through images, graphics, color, sound, music, and dance. There is a grammar and literacy to each of these forms of communication. Bombarded with a wide variety of images regularly, students need sharp visual-interpretation skills to interact with the media analytically. Each form of communication has its own rules and grammar and should be taught in ways that lead students to be more purposeful, specific, and concise in communicating.\"\n\n"}

The event was held on April 27, 2018 at the King Abdullah Sports City's King Abdullah International Stadium in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The event was scheduled for 7:00 p.m. local time. It aired live in the United States at noon EDT, with a pre-show starting at 11 a.m. EDT. At the event, all men's main roster championships were defended, in addition to a 50-man Royal Rumble match. \n\nThe card comprised ten matches. In the main event, Braun Strowman won the Greatest Royal Rumble match. On the undercard, Brock Lesnar retained the Universal Championship against Roman Reigns in a steel cage match, and the WWE Championship match between AJ Styles and Shinsuke Nakamura resulted in a double countout, The Undertaker defeated Rusev in a casket match, and John Cena defeated Triple H in the opening match.\n\nSince 1988, the Royal Rumble has been an annual event held by WWE and is typically shown on pay-per-view. The event is highlighted by the Royal Rumble match, a battle royal whose participants enter at timed intervals. The Greatest Royal Rumble included the largest version of the match to date, having a total of 50 participants.\n\nOn March 5, 2018, WWE and the Saudi General Sports Authority advertised the Greatest Royal Rumble, a live event to be held on April 27, 2018, at King Abdullah International Stadium, part of the King Abdullah Sports City, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The event is a part of a 10-year strategic multi-platform partnership between WWE and the Saudi General Sports Authority in support of Saudi Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia's social and economic reform program.\n\nOn March 19, 2018, WWE scheduled seven championship matches for the event: the WWE Championship, Universal Championship, United States Championship, Intercontinental Championship, SmackDown Tag Team Championship, Raw Tag Team Championship and Cruiserweight Championship were to be defended at the event.\n\nAs revealed on March 22, 2018, the event was streamed live on the WWE Network. It also aired on traditional pay-per-view in the United States and internationally. The event was also the first WWE pay-per-view with Arabic commentary.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the event, the WWE held tryouts in Saudi Arabia. From these tryouts, eight were selected to receive training by WWE, which would include an opportunity to earn a spot at the Greatest Royal Rumble event itself.\n\nThe card comprised ten matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches, with results predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands. Storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Monday Night Raw\", \"SmackDown Live\", and the cruiserweight-exclusive \"205 Live\".\n\nOn April 9, Brock Lesnar, who had renewed his WWE contract, was scheduled to defend the Universal Championship against Roman Reigns in a steel cage match as a rematch from WrestleMania 34. On the \"Raw\" following WrestleMania, Reigns expressed frustration about not being told about his future matches and opponents, singling out the steel cage match with Lesnar. Reigns alleged that there was a conspiracy against him. Samoa Joe, who had been out with an injury since January, came out and warned Reigns that Lesnar would beat him again.\n\nOn March 26, WWE scheduled a ladder match between then-champion The Miz, Seth Rollins, Finn Bálor, and Samoa Joe for the Intercontinental Championship. At WrestleMania 34, The Miz lost the Intercontinental Championship to Rollins, thus making Rollins the defending champion. Both Miz and Joe were traded to SmackDown while Rollins and Bálor remained on Raw.\n\nOn March 26, Cesaro and Sheamus were scheduled to defend the Raw Tag Team Championship against The Hardy Boyz (Jeff and Matt Hardy). At WrestleMania 34, however, Cesaro and Sheamus lost the titles to Braun Strowman and 10-year-old Nicholas. The following night on \"Raw\", Strowman and Nicholas relinquished the titles due to Nicholas being a fourth grader. Cesaro and Sheamus demanded their titles back, but Raw General Manager Kurt Angle instead scheduled them to face the winner of the four-team Tag Team Eliminator tournament for the vacant titles at the Greatest Royal Rumble. \"Woken\" Matt Hardy and Bray Wyatt won the tournament by defeating Titus Worldwide (Apollo Crews and Titus O'Neil) and The Revival (Dash Wilder and Scott Dawson). Cesaro and Sheamus were then traded to SmackDown during the Superstar Shake-up.\n\nAt WrestleMania 34, The Bludgeon Brothers (Harper and Rowan) defeated The Usos (Jey and Jimmy Uso) and The New Day's Big E and Kofi Kingston in a triple threat tag team match to win the SmackDown Tag Team Championship. On the following \"SmackDown\", The Usos defeated The New Day to earn a title match at Greatest Royal Rumble.\n\nA match between John Cena and Triple H was scheduled on March 26. \n\nThe Undertaker was originally scheduled to face Rusev in a casket match, the first match of its kind in three years. Due to reasons not entirely clear, Rusev was temporarily replaced by Chris Jericho — this was explained with Rusev's wife Lana complaining about her husband competing in a casket match — but eventually reinserted back into the match. Jericho was restored to his original participation in the Greatest Royal Rumble match.\n\nAt WrestleMania 34, Jinder Mahal defeated Randy Orton, Bobby Roode, and Rusev in a fatal-four-way match to win the United States Championship. Mahal was then traded to Raw and lost the championship to Jeff Hardy and Mahal invoked his rematch clause for the Greatest Royal Rumble. Hardy was then traded to SmackDown the following night.\n\nAt WrestleMania 34, AJ Styles successfully defended the WWE Championship against Shinsuke Nakamura. After the match, Nakamura showed his respect to Styles but then attacked him with a low blow and a \"Kinshasa\", turning heel. On April 17, after repeated attacks on Styles by Nakamura, a rematch between the two was scheduled for the Greatest Royal Rumble.\n\nOn the WrestleMania 34 pre-show, Cedric Alexander defeated Mustafa Ali in the WWE Cruiserweight Championship tournament final to win the vacant title. Two nights later on \"205 Live\", Buddy Murphy attacked the new champion during his celebration. Murphy was then scheduled to face Alexander for the title at the Greatest Royal Rumble, but he failed his mandatory weigh-in when he weighed 207 pounds, 2 pounds over the 205 pound weight limit. He was then removed from the match and banned from competing on \"205 Live\" until he met the weight requirement. The following week, Kalisto earned a Cruiserweight Championship match at the Greatest Royal Rumble by winning a gauntlet match.\n\nThe actual pay-per-view opened with John Cena facing Triple H. During the match, Cena performed an Attitude Adjustment on Triple H for a near-fall. Cena attempted another Attitude Adjustment but Triple H countered into a Pedigree for a near-fall. In the end, Cena performed a second Attitude Adjustment on Triple H, a catapult into the corner, and a third Attitude Adjustment to pick up the victory. Following the match, Cena thanked the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for their hospitality, and expressed excitement over the event.\n\nIn the following match, Cedric Alexander defended the Cruiserweight Championship against Kalisto. The match ended when Alexander countered a Salida Del Sol attempt into a Lumbar Check to retain the title.\n\nNext, the vacant Raw Tag Team Championship was contested between the team of Bray Wyatt and Matt Hardy and the former champions, Cesaro and Sheamus. In the end, Hardy distracted Sheamus, allowing Wyatt to perform a Sister Abigail on him. Hardy and Wyatt then performed a wheelbarrow Twist of Fate on Sheamus to win the titled.\n\nJeff Hardy then defended the United States Championship against Jinder Mahal. Hardy performed a Swanton Bomb on Mahal to retain the title.\n\nAfter that, The Bludgeon Brothers defended the SmackDown Tag Team Championship against The Usos. Harper and Rowan retained the titles after performing The Reckoning on Jimmy Uso.\n\nNext, Seth Rollins defended the Intercontinental Championship against Finn Balor, Samoa Joe and The Miz in a Ladder match. Near the end of the match, Balor attempted to retrieve the title, only for Rollins to springboard onto the ladder and retrieve the title belt, thus retaining the championship.\n\nIn a segment between matches, four prospects from the recent Saudi tryouts came out to the ring to introduce themselves. Cruiserweight Ariya Daivari and his brother Shawn Daivari, who had not appeared for WWE in many years, came out to interrupt them. The Saudi prospects attacked and cleared the Daivari brothers from the ring.\n\nLater, AJ Styles defended the WWE Championship against Shinsuke Nakamura. During the match, Nakamura resorted to various illegal tactics, such as a low blow, increasingly frustrating Styles. In the end, both Nakamura and Styles fought outside of the ring, only for the match to end in a double countout. After the match, Styles performed a Phenomenal Forearm to the floor on Nakamura.\n\nAfter that, The Undertaker fought Rusev (who was accompanied by Aiden English) in a Casket match. At the end of the match, Undertaker performed a chokeslam on Rusev and rolled him into the casket. Before he could close the lid, English attacked the Undertaker, who retaliated with another chokeslam and a Tombstone Piledriver before putting English into the casket alongside Rusev and closing it for the victory.\n\nIn the penultimate match, Brock Lesnar (accompanied by Paul Heyman) defended the Universal Championship against Roman Reigns in a steel cage match. Reigns performed three spears on Lesnar for a near-fall. As Reigns tried to escape through the door, Heyman pushed the door into Reigns, allowing Lesnar to execute an F5 on Reigns for a near-fall. In the end, Reigns performed a Spear through the cage wall on Lesnar. Despite Reigns touching the floor first, the referee awarded the win to Lesnar, thereby retaining the Universal Championship.\n\nDaniel Bryan and Dolph Ziggler began the 50-man Royal Rumble match as the first two entrants. Bryan survived until the final three, beating Rey Mysterio for the longest time spent in a single Royal Rumble match of all time at an hour and sixteen minutes. In the end, Big Cass eliminated Bryan and attempted a big boot on Braun Strowman, who countered and eliminated Cass to win the match. Strowman also achieved the most eliminations of a single Royal Rumble match at 13, beating out a record previously held by Roman Reigns with 12. Post-match, Strowman received a trophy and a green championship belt.\n\nWWE had been criticized for holding the event without female wrestlers, who were unable to perform at the event due to the limited rights women have in Saudi Arabia. Triple H, WWE's Executive Vice President of Talent, Live Events and Creative, responded to the criticism: \"I understand that people are questioning it, but you have to understand that every culture is different and just because you don’t agree with a certain aspect of it, it doesn’t mean it’s not a relevant culture...You can’t dictate to a country or a religion about how they handle things but, having said that, WWE is at the forefront of a women’s evolution in the world and what you can’t do is effect change anywhere by staying away from it...While women are not competing in the event, we have had discussions about that and hope that, in the next few years they will be\". Women were in attendance for the event, though only if accompanied by a male guardian. This was a major change from previous events, which were only open to men. Associated Press noted that this is due to \"a series of social changes\" by the Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman. During the event, WWE aired a promotional video, which included WWE female wrestlers. The Saudi General Sports Authority issued an apology for \"indecent material\" that aired at the event.\nIn addition to the women, wrestler Sami Zayn did not participate in the event as Zayn is of Syrian descent, and Saudi Arabia has strained relations with Syria. On the Raw after the event, a storyline excuse was given in where Sami was suffering from vertigo given to him by Bobby Lashley and therefore couldn’t compete.\n\nAnother subject of criticism was the situation of LGBT rights in Saudi Arabia, as in Saudi Arabia homosexual intercourse is illegal and can be punished by death.\n\nAl-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, a militant group offshoot of Al-Qaeda in Yemen, issued a warning to bin Salman and criticized the WWE event stating that \"Disbelieving wrestlers exposed their privates and on most of them was the sign of the cross, in front of a mixed gathering of young Muslim men and women. The corruptors did not stop at that, for every night musical concerts are being announced, as well as movies and circus shows.\"\n\n<onlyinclude></onlyinclude>\n\n\nAt the conclusion of the Greatest Royal Rumble, Braun Strowman was awarded a trophy and a championship title. The role of this Greatest Royal Rumble Championship, however remains unclear. According to \"The Sportster\", \"the likelihood is that nothing that took place in the main event will have any effect on anything once WWE arrives back in the United States and resume normal service.\" Thus far, the belt has not reappeared on WWE programs.\n\nThe base design is similar to the current design of the WWE Championship, with some differences. Instead of a large cut out of the WWE logo, the center plate is modeled with an Arabic pattern with the WWE logo in the center. Like the WWE Championship belt and other belts introduced in 2016 and 2017, the Greatest Royal Rumble Championship belt contains two side plates, both separated by gold divider bars, with removable round sections that can be replaced with the current champion's logo; the default plates show the official logo of Saudi General Sports Authority, which is identical to the national emblem of Saudi Arabia. The plates are on a green leather strap resembling the color of the national flag of Saudi Arabia.\n\n"}

{"id": "854811", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=854811", "title": "Écriture féminine", "text": "Écriture féminine\n\nÉcriture féminine translates from the French as \"women's writing\". The theory, which unpacks the relationship between the cultural and psychological inscription of the female body and female difference in language and text, is a strain of feminist literary theory that originated in France in the early 1970s through the work of theorists including Hélène Cixous, Monique Wittig, Luce Irigaray, Chantal Chawaf, Catherine Clément, and Julia Kristeva and has subsequently been extended by writers such as psychoanalytic theorist Bracha Ettinger, who emerged in this field in the early 1990s.\n\nÉcriture féminine as a theory foregrounds the importance of language for the psychic understanding of self. The theory draws on the foundational work in psychoanalysis about the way that humans come to understand their social roles. In doing so, it goes on to expound how women, who may be positioned as 'other' in a masculine symbolic order, can reaffirm their understanding of the world through engaging with their own outsiderness.\n\nHélène Cixous first coined \"écriture féminine\" in her essay, \"The Laugh of the Medusa\" (1975), where she asserts \"woman must write her self: must write about women and bring women to writing, from which they have been driven away as violently as from their bodies\" because their sexual pleasure has been repressed and denied expression. Inspired by Cixous' essay, a recent book titled \"Laughing with Medusa\" (2006) analyzes the collective work of Julia Kristeva, Luce Irigaray, Bracha Ettinger and Hélène Cixous. These writers are as a whole referred to by Anglophones as \"the French feminists,\" though Mary Klages, Associate Professor in the English Department at the University of Colorado at Boulder, has pointed out that \"poststructuralist theoretical feminists\" would be a more accurate term. Madeleine Gagnon is a more recent proponent. And since the aforementioned 1975 when Cixous also founded women's studies at Vincennes, she has been as a spokeswoman for the group \"Psychanalyse et politique\" and a prolific writer of texts for their publishing house, \"des femmes\". And when asked of her own writing she says, \"Je suis là où ça parle\" (\"I am there where it/id/the female unconscious speaks.\") \n\nAmerican feminist critic and writer Elaine Showalter defines this movement as \"the inscription of the feminine body and female difference in language and text.\" \"Écriture féminine\" places experience before language, and privileges non-linear, cyclical writing that evades \"the discourse that regulates the phallocentric system.\" Because language is not a neutral medium, it can be said to function as an instrument of patriarchal expression. As Peter Barry writes, “the female writer is seen as suffering the handicap of having to use a medium (prose writing) which is essentially a male instrument fashioned for male purposes”. \"Ecriture féminine\" thus exists as an antithesis of masculine writing or as a means of escape for women.\n\nIn the words of Rosemarie Tong, “Cixous challenged women to write themselves out of the world men constructed for women. She urged women to put themselves-the unthinkable/unthought-into words.”\nAlmost everything is yet to be written by women about femininity: about their sexuality, that is, its infinite and mobile complexity; about their eroticization, sudden turn-ons of a certain minuscule-immense area of their bodies; not about destiny, but about the adventure of such and such a drive, about trips, crossings, trudges, abrupt and gradual awakenings, discoveries of a zone at once timorous and soon to be forthright. \nWith regard to phallogocentric writing, Tong argues that \"male sexuality, which centers on what Cixous called the \"big dick\", is ultimately boring in its pointedness and singularity. Like male sexuality, masculine writing, which Cixous usually termed phallogocentric writing, is also ultimately boring\" and furthermore, that \"stamped with the official seal of social approval, masculine writing is too weighted down to move or change\".\nWrite, let no one hold you back, let nothing stop you: not man; not the imbecilic capitalist machinery, in which the publishing houses are the crafty, obsequious relayers of imperatives handed down by an economy that works against us and off our backs; not \"yourself\". Smug-faced readers, managing editors, and big bosses don't like the true texts of women- female-sexed texts. That kind scares them.\nFor Cixous, \"écriture féminine\" is not only a possibility for female writers; rather, she believes it can be (and has been) employed by male authors such as James Joyce or Jean Genet. Some have found this idea difficult to reconcile with Cixous’ definition of \"écriture féminine\" (often termed ‘white ink’) because of the many references she makes to the female body (“There is always in her at least a little of that good mother’s milk. She writes in white ink”.) when characterizing the essence of écriture féminine and explaining its origin. This notion raises problems for some theorists:\n\"\"Ecriture féminine\", then, is by its nature transgressive, rule-transcending, intoxicated, but it is clear that the notion as put forward by Cixous raises many problems. The realm of the body, for instance, is seen as somehow immune to social and gender condition and able to issue forth a pure essence of the feminine. Such essentialism is difficult to square with feminism which emphasizes femininity as a social construction…\"\n\nFor Luce Irigaray, women's sexual pleasure \"jouissance\" cannot be expressed by the dominant, ordered, \"logical,\" masculine language because, according to Kristeva, feminine language is derived from the pre-oedipal period of fusion between mother and child which she termed the semiotic. Associated with the maternal, feminine language (which Irigaray called \"parler femme\", womanspeak) is not only a threat to culture, which is patriarchal, but also a medium through which women may be creative in new ways. Irigaray expressed this connection between women's sexuality and women's language through the following analogy: women's \"jouissance\" is more multiple than men's unitary, phallic pleasure because \n\"woman has sex organs just about everywhere...feminine language is more diffusive than its 'masculine counterpart'. That is undoubtedly the reason...her language...goes off in all directions and...he is unable to discern the coherence.\" \nIrigaray and Cixous also go on to emphasize that women, historically limited to being sexual objects for men (virgins or prostitutes, wives or mothers), have been prevented from expressing their sexuality in itself or for themselves. If they can do this, and if they can speak about it in the new languages it calls for, they will establish a point of view (a site of difference) from which phallogocentric concepts and controls can be seen through and taken apart, not only in theory, but also in practice.\n\nThe approach through language to feminist action has been criticised by some as over-theoretical: they would see the fact that the very first meeting of a handful of would-be feminist activists in 1970 only managed to launch an acrimonious theoretical debate as marking the situation as typically 'French' in its apparent insistence on the primacy of theory over politics. Nonetheless, in practice the French women's movement developed in much the same way as the feminist movements elsewhere in Europe or in the United States: French women participated in consciousness-raising groups; demonstrated in the streets on the 8 March; fought hard for women's right to choose whether to have children; raised the issue of violence against women; and struggled to change public opinion on issues concerning women and women's rights.\n\nFurther criticisms of écriture féminine include its essentialist view of the body; its over-reliance on a feminism of 'difference'; and its tendency to demonise not only the masculine but those (many) women authors who write or have written in more conventional, linear literary forms.\n\nAs a result of the difficulties inherent in the notion of \"écriture féminine\", very few books of literary criticism have run the risk of using it as a critical tool. A. S. Byatt offers: \"There is a marine and salty female wave-water to be...read as a symbol of female language, which is partly suppressed, partly self-communing, dumb before the intruding male and not able to speak out...thus mirroring those female secretions which are not inscribed in our daily use of language (\"langue\", tongue)\".\n\n\n"}
