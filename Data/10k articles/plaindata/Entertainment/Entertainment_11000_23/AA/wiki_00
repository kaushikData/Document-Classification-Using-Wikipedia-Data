It was supposed to be a \"younger brother\" of Warsaw's Baj Theater, hence the name \"Baj Pomorski\". The Bydgoszcz theatre was situated in the city's slaughterhouse, which had functioned as a German marionette theatre during Nazi occupation. On October 28, 1945 it performed its premiere for children – Ewa Szelburg-Zarembina's Little Wandering Taylor. The conditions of Bydgoszcz's stage did not, however, meet the needs of the young puppet theatre. Therefore, I. Pikiel very willingly accepted the proposal for moving the headquarters of Baj Pomorski to Toruń. As early as April 1946 the Theatre had been granted a building at 9 Piernikarska Street, which had previously belonged to the German Castle Theatre during the war. It is in this beautiful location near the ruins of the Castle of The Teutonic Knights that the Theatre has been performing till today – extending to the past sixty years.\n\nThe first actors of \"Baj Pomorski\" were students from The University of Nicholas Copernicus who, under the guidance of experienced actors and directors, took part in theatrical clinics and thereby unearthed the arcana of puppet animation. Work conditions were not easy. The theatre had humble equipment at its disposal, yet it was actively involved in on-the-road performances not only in Pomerania, but also throughout nearly all over Poland. By then \"Baj Pomorski\" had already achieved its first success. In 1947, Joanna Piekarska, an artist and director, became the theatre's artistic manager. She directed the performance entitled She-Cat's House which received 3rd prize at the 1st Festival of Russian and Soviet Plays in Warsaw in 1950. This achievement, as well as the theatre's extensive activity, contributed to the nationalization of Toruń's puppet stage. At that time this meant that, on one hand, the institution would gain financial stability, while on the other, certain liberties for creativity, so inherent in pioneering activities, would have to cease.\n\nFrom then on the rules of play planning and selection, mandated within a cultural policy, had to be consistently obeyed.\nThe following directors of the theatre were \n\nAll the directors have left their ineffaceable expressions upon Toruń's puppet stage. It was when Stapf was the theatre's acting director that the days of \"Baj Pomorski's\" \"artistic adolescence\" occurred. He was the one responsible for helping modernize the theatre, making it into one of the best equipped stages in Poland; he displayed a premiere for adults (the first of its kind for the theatre – a Polish preview puppet show of William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream; he initiated the North Poland Puppet Theater Festival held in Toruń – Pomerania's first event of this caliber. \n\nDuring the Sixties, under Śmigielski's management, a further change was brought about in \"Baj Pomorski's\" image, from that of a traditional puppet stage to one of a theatre seeking new forms of expression, open to Toruń's artistic life. It was during this time that the largest numbers of preview shows within the history of the theatre were staged; ambitious spectacles (influenced by traditional folk theatre) were created, and innovatory stage productions by contemporary regional authors were shown. The Club of Creative Circles Azyl, formed during that time, was a unique artistic phenomenon in Poland, making \"Baj Pomorski\" the center of cultural life and the venue for many a theatrical initiative. \n\nThanks to Tadeusz Petrykowski the theatre reanimated its cooperation with theatre groups abroad, including those from the Czech Republic and Romania; it also increased its participation in Polish puppet festivals.\n\nKonrad Szachnowski made his name in \"Baj's\" past by coming up with a modern concept for staging theatrical classics. His preview puppet show of Fernando de Rojas’ Celestine found its place in Polish puppet theatre's historic lore by using an amazingly creative theatrical idea involving supermarionnette and \"trashy theatre\". \n\nThe eight years of Antoni Słociński's management resulted in the development of theatrical education programs for children; besides this the theatre began to mark its presence at international festivals, with cooperation with German (mainly in Göttingen – one of Toruń's partner cities) and Czech theatres, growing stronger in the process. \n\nThe following directors – Krzysztof Arciszewski and Wojciech Olejnik – presumably continued to expand upon programs based upon previously developed images of the theatre. An important modification introduced during that time was the transformation of the theatre into an institution financed by the City of Toruń.\n\nFurther development of \"Baj Pomorski\" occurred under the management of Czesław Sieńko. This was the era democracy being stabilized in Poland, the executive branch of the government undergoing structural changes, and transformation sweeping throughout all areas of economy, culture and social life. The repertoire included stage productions of the most interesting novels for children and teenagers which had up until then been absent from thespian arts. The theatre took its first steps in promoting new European literature for children. Innovatory scenographic suggestions taught audiences based on one's involvement in the performance. Never before in its history had \"Baj Pomorski\" spectacles received so many awards and honors. In 1994 Sieńko initiated Toruń's Meetings of Puppet Theaters. In 1999 this evolved to become Toruń's International Meetings of Puppet Theaters which has become a perpetual event in Toruń's puppet stage activity.\nToruń's International Meetings of Puppet Theatres is one of the few events of this type and size in Poland. It is held in October on a yearly basis. Throughout this week of contests and challenges one can see the most interesting theatres from around the world –masters of puppetry, artists nurturing the tradition of the puppet theatre, and groups searching and experimenting within the nature of the loosely termed \"animation theatre\". Eleven events have been held thus far, confirming the high rank of the festival from a list of theatrical events both within and beyond Poland.\n\nThe present director of \"Baj Pomorski\" has since made Toruń's puppet stage into an open theatre, vividly responding to the city's needs and present-day trends. Its message, though targeted mostly at children and teenagers, is intended to reach every student and adult. Hopes for the coming years are for the modernization and development of the theatre's main building. Planned on a wide scale it will change its look, making it one of Poland's most modern and interesting stages, and not only from the architectural point of view. By giving the building the characteristics of an enormous, magical, theatrical wardrobe it will be transformed into a place where, for both Toruń's residents and tourists alike, it can serve as the locale for interplay, wherein the mysteries of its theatre and the beauty of its architecture enwrap together the Old and New Town settings.\n\nEnglish translation by Agnieszka Klonowska and Wolf V.

Cigar box manipulation began as a vaudeville act in the United States between the 1880s and 1920s, and was popularized by W. C. Fields. Originally, performers would take actual boxes that cigars were stored in and nail them shut to create their juggling props. Today, cigar boxes for juggling are typically purpose-built, hollow wooden or plastic blocks with suede or foam rubber padding attached to the sides.\n\nCigar boxes are juggled by holding a box in each hand and tossing and flipping a third box in between them. Routines performed with cigar boxes may also include quick midair box-exchanging tricks, balancing tricks, and more. Most tricks are done with three boxes; more advanced routines may include more than three.\n\nRather than the \"flowing\" style of ball juggling, cigar boxes have what is often referred to as a \"stop-and-start\" style. In effect, this means that after the majority of tricks the boxes return to the home position (three or more boxes in a line, smallest ends together) and stop before the juggler starts the next trick. \n\nMost cigar box tricks are achieved by bouncing up and down (normally from the knees, keeping one's arms in the same place relative to one's body). The trick is started at the apex of the 'bounce' and the boxes are pinned in the home position on the downstroke, preferably at the same altitude at which they started. This leads to the visual effect of the boxes being connected by an invisible wire (in tricks where the boxes not involved in the trick are separate; see \"take out\" below) or it can appear as if the boxes are magnetic in some way (where two boxes remain 'stuck' together in the air; see \"end round\" below). This is just an illusion; the boxes are not in any way connected.\n\nIn 1977 Kris Kremo set a Guinness World Record of releasing one box and catching it after a quadruple pirouette. In 1994, Kristian Kristof broke the record by releasing all three boxes and catching them after a quadruple pirouette.\n\nThe world record for the most cigar boxes balanced is on the chin is 223 set by \"Ashrita Furman\" (USA) at The Culture Project Theatre, New York City, New York, USA, on 12 November 2006.\n\nWhereas vaudeville performers originally tended to use actual cigar boxes, today, the props for cigar box routines are usually built specifically for manipulation. They may be constructed from various materials, including plastic, plywood, or even wall paneling. They are sometimes padded on the ends and/or the sides with suede, foam rubber, or a felt-like material to provide extra friction on the catch. Foam yoga blocks are also the right size and shape.\n\n"}
{"id": "22256453", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22256453", "title": "Clearly Impossible", "text": "Clearly Impossible\n\nClearly Impossible is a variation of the illusion of sawing a woman in half devised by Jonathan Pendragon.\n\nThe illusion is very similar in principle and performance to the older \"Thin Model\" versions of sawing a woman in half, with the exception that the boxes used to cover the assistant being divided are clear, rather than opaque. In basic concept, it is very similar to the transparent sawing developed by Les Arnold in the late 1970s. However, in the Pendragons version, the boxes are much smaller, and are never covered at any point during the illusion. As a result, the assistant within the boxes remains in full view throughout, making this a particularly baffling illusion for the audience.\n\nThe illusion usually begins with the magician showing the audience a low table, designed to split into two halves. The main assistant is then introduced, and lies down on the table. Other assistants then place two boxes over the assistant, with clear sides and tops. As the upper box is placed over them, the main assistant extends their arm out of the open side of the box, while their head and feet extend out of the ends of the two boxes. Small stocks are then used to restrain the assistant's feet and neck. Because the boxes have clear sides, the audience is able to see right through them, and can see that the assistant has not curled up inside the upper box, as is described in many commonly available magic books for the \"Thin Model\" sawing. \n\nThe magician then cuts through the box using either a saw or sword (although some performers skip this step), and dividers are placed into the box either side of the cut. With the dividers in place, the two halves of the table are unlocked and pulled apart. As the assistant has been in full view of the audience throughout the illusion, it appears that they have been separated into two halves, the impossibility of this situation helping to give the illusion its name. The halves of the table are then pushed back together, the dividers removed, and the unharmed assistant released from the stocks and boxes.\n\nWhile she was in a relationship with David Copperfield and not otherwise occupied with modelling work, Claudia Schiffer often assisted Copperfield in his stage shows as a \"special guest assistant\". Part of these shows was a performance of Clearly Impossible, with Schiffer as the assistant being sawed in half by Copperfield.\n\nDuring the 1996 TV special \"Champions of Magic\", Jonathan Pendragon performed the illusion on the show's host, Princess Stéphanie of Monaco.\n\nIn November 2004, singer Shania Twain appeared on the BBC charity telethon \"Children in Need\" as a celebrity assistant in a magic act, being sawed in half in a performance of Clearly Impossible.\n\nWhile appearing on a local TV talk show during a promotional visit to Japan in 2006, actress Mischa Barton took part in a performance of the illusion in which she was sawed in half by a local magician.\n\nItalian singer Sabrina Salerno assisted illusionist Martin in a televised performance of Clearly Impossible.\n\nWhile presenting \"SM:TV Live\", British TV presenter Cat Deeley was the first British celebrity to be sawed in half in a version of Clearly Impossible.\n\nDuring a promotional visit to Europe, Jessica Simpson participated in a performance of the illusion where she was sawed in half by illusionist Hans Klok, who used a large circular saw to divide her in two.\n\nWhen she appeared on a Mexican talk show, Penélope Cruz took part in a performance of this illusion.\n\nIn February and March 2012, Klok visited the UK with his stage show The Houdini Experience, playing a five-week run. During the press night at the Peacock Theatre in London, he amazed the audience of celebrity guests when he invited actress Louisa Lytton up onto the stage and, without any prior rehearsal, sawed her in half in his Clearly Impossible illusion.\n"}

Although they had no natural born children of their own they did adopt a daughter Maud Ainsworth Young (1892–1966). She was the biological daughter of Emma's older sister Annie Young (1860–1906) and Emma's brother-in-law Joseph Charles Ainsworth. In adult life Maud Ainsworth McIntyre became the wife of the Brooklyn criminal trial lawyer and Kings County judge George Washington Martin II (1876–1948). Emma sometimes assisted her husband in negotiating theatre contracts. Emma wrote theatrical scripts using the pseudonym Emily Louise Young, and these included \"The Rag Time Opera of Trial Marriage\" (1916), and she co-wrote \"Red Pepper\" and \"Hello, Alexander\".\n\nIn his peak years as a star performer he gave an interview with the \"New York Times\" in which he claimed to have been responsible for introducing to vaudeville the Buck and Wing style of dance that is one form of tap dance.\n\nIn 1874 he met Thomas Kurton Heath (1853–1938) in Texas. They developed a blackface tramp duo minstrel act. McIntyre played the character of Alexander Hambletonian who was a buffoonish stable-boy. Heath acted as \"Henry Jones\" a clever black entertainer who frequently outwits Alexander. Their routines included an oft-performed skit known as the Georgia Minstrels where the character Henry persuades the witless Alexander to quit working as a stable-boy and joins a traveling show where he is promised fame and fortune. None of the fame or fortune materializes and Alexander has comical and outrageous tasks to perform under Henry's direction which allowed them to act out comedic dialogue, dance and songs. Another skit, called the Ham Tree, and which formed the nucleus of a later stage play, involved the two characters discussing how ham grows on trees that are three hundred feet tall.\n\nTheir acting partnership endured for some fifty years as they worked under the twin influential theatre managers of Tony Pastor and Benjamin Franklin Keith appearing as stars in both vaudeville and Broadway. Their blackface minstrel shows were an influential model followed by later film stars such as Al Jolson.

It is commonly found on models of CD players which are made for disc jockeys, and on professional video equipment such as video tape recorders. More recently, they are found on handheld PDAs, and as the scroll wheel on computer mice. \"Jog\" refers to going at a very slow speed, whereas \"shuttle\" refers to a very fast speed.\n\nThere are two basic types of wheels. One type has no stops and can be spun the entire way around, because it is a relative rotary encoder. This type depends on tracking the actual motion of the dial: the faster it spins forward or back, the faster it fast-forwards or rewinds. Once the dial stops moving, the media continues playing or remains paused at that point. Another type has stops on either side, and often has three or so speeds which depend on how far it is turned. Once the wheel is released, it springs back to the middle position and the media pauses or begins playing again.\n\nIf the device is set or designed to pause after the wheel is used, the audio is often stuttered, repeating a small section over and over again. This is usually done on DJ CD players, for the purpose of beatmatching, and is equivalent to an earlier turntablist DJ moving a phonograph record back and forth slightly to find the physical location of a starting beat within the groove. On video, the pause is a freeze frame of the current video frame.\n\nSony Corporation holds a patent for a 5-way version of jog dial. A 5-way jog dial allows up and down scrolling, right and left deflections, and a press-to-click action. Such jog dial was a feature of Sony CLIÉ PDA series and SonyEricsson P800, P900 and P910 smartphones. A 5-way jog dial has not been used by Sony or its subsidiaries since 2006.\n\n"}

It is also the headquarters of Shumeikai, a new religious group founded by Mihoko Koyama.\n\nThe museum was the dream of Mihoko Koyama (after whom it is named), founder of the religious organization Shinji Shumeikai which is now said to have some 300,000 members worldwide. Shinji Shumeikai is illegal in European countries and is a religious cult that punishes member that do not make adequate financial contributions. Furthermore, in the 1990s Koyama commissioned the museum to be built close to the Shumei temple in the Shiga mountains. \n\nThe Miho Museum houses Mihoko Koyama's private collection of Asian and Western antiques bought on the world market by the Shumei organisation in the years before the museum was opened in 1997. While Koyama began acquiring stoneware tea ceremony vessels as early as the 1950s, the bulk of the museum's acquisitions were made in the 1990s. There are over two thousand pieces in the permanent collection, of which approximately 250 are displayed at any one time. Among the objects in the collection are more than 1,200 objects that appear to have been produced in Achaemenid Central Asia. Some scholars have claimed these objects are part of the Oxus Treasure, lost shortly after its discovery in 1877 and rediscovered in Afghanistan in 1993. The presence of a unique findspot for both the Miho acquisitions and the British Museum's material, however, has been challenged.\n\nMany of the items in the collection were acquired in collaboration with the art dealer Noriyoshi Horiuchi over the course of just six years, and some have little or no known provenance. In 2001 the museum acknowledged that a sixth-century statue of a Boddhisatva in its collection was the same sculpture which been stolen from a public garden in Shandong province, China in 1994.\n\nHighlights of the collections have been featured in traveling exhibitions at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1996, as well as the Kunshistorisches Museum Wien in 1999.\n\nMihoko Koyama and her daughter, Hiroko Koyama, commissioned the architect I. M. Pei to design the Miho Museum. I. M. Pei's design, which he came to call Shangri-La, is executed in a hilly and forested landscape. Approximately three-quarters of the 17,400 square meter building is situated underground, carved out of a rocky mountaintop. The roof is a large glass and steel construction, while the exterior and interior walls and floor are made of a warm beige-colored limestone from France – the same material used by Pei in the reception hall of the Louvre. The structural engineer for this project was Leslie E. Robertson Associates.\n\nPei continued to make changes to the design of the galleries during construction as new pieces were acquired for the collection.\n\nPei had earlier designed the bell tower at Misono, the international headquarters and spiritual center of the Shumei organization.

Iwasaki later regretted interviewing for Golden, having cited a breach of confidentiality and later sued and settled out of court with Golden for the parallelism between his book and her life. She later released her own autobiography titled \"Geisha of Gion\" (UK) or \"Geisha: A Life\" (USA) in 2002.\n\nBorn as Masako Tanaka, she left home at the age of five to begin studying traditional Japanese dance at the Iwasaki \"okiya\" (geisha house) in the Gion district of Kyoto. She was legally adopted by the okiya's owner, Madame Oima, and began using their family name of Iwasaki. She had been chosen as the house's \"atotori\", or heir. Iwasaki became a \"maiko\" (apprentice geiko) at age 15. She also received the name Mineko, as prescribed by a Japanese fortune-teller. By age 16, she had earned a reputation as Japan's most popular maiko and finally became a geiko on her 21st birthday.\n\nAccording to her autobiography, Iwasaki worked herself to her physical and mental limits. She developed a near-fatal kidney condition but recovered. She entertained numerous celebrities and foreign dignitaries including United Kingdom's Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Charles. Iwasaki's fame also made her the subject of jealousy and gossip, and she was sometimes faced with sexual harassment and assault.\n\nAfter the death of one of her most significant mentors in 1980, Iwasaki became increasingly frustrated with the tradition-bound world of the geiko, especially inadequacies in the education system. Iwasaki unexpectedly retired at the height of her career, at the age of 29. She hoped that her decision would shock Gion into reform; however, even after over 70 other high ranking geiko followed her into early retirement, nothing was changed. In her autobiography, Iwasaki speculates that the profession may be doomed if the industry fails to adapt to changing economic and social circumstance. She transitioned to a career in art after she married artist Jin'ichirō Satō in 1982. Their child, Kosuke, was born in 1983.\n\nIwasaki was one of several geisha author Arthur Golden interviewed while researching his novel \"Memoirs of a Geisha\". According to Iwasaki, she agreed to speak with Golden on the condition that her involvement would be kept confidential, but Golden revealed her identity by mentioning her name in the book's acknowledgments as well as several national interviews. After \"Memoirs\" was published, Iwasaki received criticism and even death threats for violating the traditional geisha code of silence.\n\nIwasaki felt betrayed by Golden's use of information she considered confidential, as well as the way he twisted reality. She denounced \"Memoirs of a Geisha\" as being an inaccurate depiction of the life of a geisha. Iwasaki was particularly offended by the novel's portrayal of geiko engaging in ritualized prostitution. For example, in the novel the main character Sayuri's virginity (called \"mizuage\" in the novel) is auctioned off to the highest bidder. Iwasaki stated that, not only did this never happen to her, but that no such custom ever existed in Gion.\n\nPart of Iwasaki's displeasure with \"Memoirs\" may have been because the character Sayuri seems obviously modeled on Iwasaki, with many of the book's main characters and events having parallels in Iwasaki's life. These people and experiences are often portrayed negatively in \"Memoirs\", even when their real-life counterparts were positive for Iwasaki.\n\nIwasaki later gave public interviews citing that many established geiko criticized her interview with Arthur Golden, causing a rupture with the geisha tradition of secrecy to the outside world. Furthermore, Iwasaki has mentioned that she had lost some friends and relationships due to the scandal of her being known due to the book, along with certain inconsistencies and fallacies about Gion which were mentioned in \"Memoirs of a Geisha\".\n\nIwasaki sued Golden for breach of contract and defamation of character in 2001, which was settled out of court in 2003.\n\nAfter the publication of \"Memoirs of a Geisha\", Iwasaki decided to write an autobiography, contrasting with the fiction of Golden's book. Her book, co-authored by Rande Gail Brown and published as \"Geisha: A Life\" in the US and \"Geisha of Gion\" in the UK, detailed her experiences before, during and after her time as a geiko to the outside world. It became a worldwide bestseller.\n\n\n"}

The majority of model robots are produced by Bandai and are based on the \"Mobile Suit Gundam\" anime metaseries. This has given rise to the hobby's common name in Japan, \"Gunpla\" (or \"gan-pura\", a Japanese portmanteau of \"Gundam\" and \"plastic model\"). Though there are exceptions, the model robot genre is dominated by anime tie-ins, with anime series and movies frequently serving as merchandising platform.\n\nHard plastic joints generally exhibit greater friction than polyvinyl joints, and are similarly more durable than styrene joints. ABS joints, however, require greater precision in tooling to ensure easy assembly, and in some cases, they require screws and a small gap between parts.\n\nGundam kits are the most common and popular variety of mecha models and so exemplify the general characteristics of models in the genre. Gundam kits are typically oriented toward beginners, and most often feature simple construction, simple designs, and rugged construction—less durable than a pre-assembled toy, but more durable than a true scale model. The result is that the majority of Gundam kits feature hands and other parts that favor poseability or easy assembly over accurate shape. They may also exhibit various draft-angle problems, and features like antennae that are oversized to prevent breakage. For the most part, other kit lines and other kit manufacturers in the genre follow suit, though there are exceptions.\n\nAnime mecha subjects such as Gundam are most often portrayed as being between 15–20 meters tall, and so the kits are scaled in a manner that brings the subject to an economical and manageable size. For machines in this size range, scales of 1:100 and 1:144 are most common, with 1:60 being reserved for larger (and usually more expensive or elaborate) kits. For smaller subjects, scales such as 1:20, 1:35, and 1:72 are common. Bandai kits are commonly based upon fairly extensive and radical redesigns, rather than the original designs themselves. Some of this inconsistency representation may be due to the inherent difficulties in turning a 2-D cel-animated design into a 3-D design. Additionally, newer versions of the same mecha could be very different from an older version, due to better manufacturing technologies.\n\nGunpla is a major hobby in Japan, with entire magazines dedicated to variations on Bandai models. As mecha are fictional humanoid objects, there is considerable leeway for custom models and \"kitbashes.\" A large amount of artistry goes into action poses and personalized variations on classic machines. There is also a market for custom resin kits which fill in gaps in the Bandai model line.\n\nGundam is not the only line of model robots. Eureka Seven, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Patlabor, Aura Battler Dunbine and Heavy Metal L-Gaim, to name a few, are all represented by Bandai model lines. Other manufacturers, such as Hasegawa, Wave, and Kotobukiya, have in recent years offered products from other series, such as Macross, Votoms, Five Star Stories, Armored Core, Virtual-On, Zoids, and Maschinen Krieger, with results rivaling Bandai's best products.\n"}

Recent empirical research suggests that 3 to 5% of the population are affected by it. One notable finding relevant to this phenomenon was borne out of a scientific study conducted in 2014, which revealed that while those exhibiting musical anhedonia do not have a problem comprehending music, they simply fail to experience or exhibit any material form of positive emotional response from listening to it.\n\nResearchers have utilized magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to study patients via scanning their brains while the patients are being presented with the auditory stimulus of musical sounds. Patients were given other psychological and emotional perception-oriented tests that were related to the notion of money during the MRI procedure to effectively control the experiment for music or to isolate the effect or effects of the independent variable of music (i.e., in other words, to make sure they only showed no emotion while listening to music). The studies revealed that, relative to the average person, individuals whom are shown to exhibit this condition tend to have a significantly lesser degree of a connection in their brain between their auditory processing and reward center. MRI scans also showed that people with this condition have relatively little connection between the nucleus accumbens and auditory processing compared to the average person. In fact, it was also empirically deduced that individuals who are shown to enjoy listening to music have a higher connection in this area of the brain than those who are found to have the condition.\n\nThe majority of the world's population enjoys listening to music.

The nurse-led telephone information service provided residents and visitors in England with healthcare advice 24 hours a day, every day of the year through telephone contact on the national non-geographic 0845 46 47 number. The programme also provided a web based symptom checkers on the NHS Direct website and via mobile, both as apps for iPhone and Android smart phones and a mobile website.\n\nIt was discontinued on 31 March 2014 and replaced by NHS 111. As a part of the National Health Service, NHS Direct services were free, although the 0845 number was usually chargeable as a non-geographic number. Some landline providers allowed 0845 calls within \"inclusive\" minutes.\n\nUsers of the service, through whichever channel, were asked questions about their symptoms or problem. Common problems were often given simple self care advice, which they could follow, thereby avoiding an expensive visit to a health care professional. More complex problems were assessed by a nurse and could then be given treatment advice or referred on to another service within the NHS.\n\nAs well as these core services, NHS Direct provided a number of commissioned services throughout the NHS, such as specialised support for patients with long term conditions, access to GP and dental healthcare out of hours, and a professional response system for times of public health anxiety.\n\nNHS Direct only provided its service for residents and visitors in England, and there are corresponding public services covering Scotland (NHS 24) and Wales (NHS Direct Wales). Northern Ireland does not have such a service.\n\nNHS Direct's core service was the provision of health advice to the public through the national telephone service or through digital channels including the website.\n\nIn England and Wales, the NHS Direct telephone service was available on 0845 46 47 and was run by a specially trained team of information handlers and healthcare professionals, including nurses and dental nurses. The service was equipped to deal with a huge range of health enquiries, from symptomatic queries that require assessment and treatment, to requests for local healthcare services and healthy living advice.\n\nEvery person that called NHS Direct feeling unwell was assessed to establish the severity of their symptoms, so as to re-route any urgent or life-threatening situations to the emergency services as quickly as possible.\n\nOther symptomatic callers were able to speak to a nurse practitioner, who asked about their condition in order to recommend the best course of action. This could be giving advice about treating the problem at home, suggesting a visit to a pharmacist, or advising an appointment with their GP, which, if in the out of hours period (when the GP surgeries are closed), could possibly be arranged over the phone.\n\nAs many callers were advised to look after their symptoms at home without seeing their GP, the NHS Direct telephone service reduced the demand on NHS resources and helped to avoid unnecessary trips to the doctor, dentist and accident and emergency department.\n\nThe NHS Direct telephone service also provided a confidential interpreter service in many different languages, which could be accessed by stating the language required when the call was answered. For those who are deaf or hard of hearing, there was a textphone service available on 0845 606 4647.\n\nThe NHS Direct website had a variety of symptom checkers, based on the same system used on the telephone service and could either give self care advice or direct a user to another NHS service. For more complex queries, the symptom checkers allowed the user to receive a call back from a nurse or to take part in a webchat for further information and help.\n\nAll NHS Direct health advice and information on the website passed through a rigorous clinical check by medical professionals before it was published.\n\nNon-urgent health queries could be submitted to the NHS Direct online enquiry service and the website also offered a confidential webchat service for those needing advice about unprotected sex or emergency contraception.\n\nNHS Direct offered its full range of symptom checkers optimised for mobile devices on its mobile website and also launched stand alone 'apps' for iPhone and Android smart phones, both available in the normal app stores.\n\nNHS Direct provided an interactive TV service via Sky Interactive until 31 March 2009, when the service was closed.\n\nThe Freeview service, on channel 100 is now hosted by NHS Choices.\n\nThe digital television service contained condensed versions of many of the most common and popular health encyclopaedia topics and common health questions.\n\nAlthough it is not well known, NHS Direct supplies a multitude of additional commissioned services within the NHS.\n\nNHS Direct supported many local health authorities in England, including Primary Care Trusts (PCTs), helping them to deliver high quality healthcare to people in each region.\n\nThese services ranged from dedicated projects in particular areas, such as the local telephone helpline set up for Sandwell PCT after a dental health scare, to schemes that were developed nationwide. These include a telephone-based pre and post operative assessment for patients having surgery, and allocating care managers to give regular coaching and advice to those with long term conditions, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\n\nNHS Direct was launched in 1998 after the government identified a need for a telephone health advice line staffed by nurses as part of its plans to modernise the NHS.\n\nThe aim of NHS Direct, as stated by the government in the NHS White Paper, \"The New NHS\", was \"to provide people at home with easier and faster advice and information about health, illness, and the NHS, so that they are better able to care for themselves and their families\".\n\nThe NHS Direct telephone service began taking calls in three contact centres in Lancashire, Northumbria and Milton Keynes in March 1998. These original sites were set up as pilots but soon proved successful, reaching over 1 million people and earning highly positive feedback. Additional waves of pilots were established in contact centres around England until the whole country was covered by the NHS Direct telephone service in 2000.\n\nNHS Direct added a website to its services at the end of 1999, allowing users to find clinically accurate health advice and information anonymously. Since its creation, the NHS Direct website was steadily improved and developed, attracting more users. By 2008, there were over 1.5 million visitors to the website every month. NHS Direct's services continued to expand and improve. It had been said that this has made the organisation \"the largest and most successful healthcare provider of its kind, anywhere in the world\".\n\nIt was reported that each call made to NHS Direct cost £25 to answer - an earlier official report had put the total at £16.\n\nIn April 2007, NHS Direct became an NHS Trust, giving it the opportunity to apply for foundation trust status.\n\nIn August 2010, the BBC reported that David Cameron's coalition government was planning to scrap the NHS Direct 0845 46 47 helpline telephone service in favour of the cheaper NHS 111 number. This intention was set out in the white paper, but was portrayed in the media as a 'leak' by the Conservative Health Secretary Andrew Lansley. The service was shut down on 26 March 2014. A copy of the website was archived a few weeks before the official closedown.\n\nThe Department of Health confirmed that NHS Direct's telephone number was to be phased out in favour of the new non-emergency NHS 111 number, following three pilots in the North East, East Midlands and East of England. NHS 111 is intended to work in an integrated way with local GPs, out-of-hours services, ambulance services and hospitals, for the benefit of patients and to help the NHS become more efficient. NHS Direct was intended to have an ongoing role, along with other providers, in helping to deliver the NHS 111 Service and, in the interim, continued providing local and national telephone and web-based services on behalf of its commissioners. The Labour party, which founded NHS Direct, voiced its opposition to the proposal, although it had promised to introduce the new 111 hotline nationally in its election manifesto.\n\nIt was announced in October 2013 that NHS Direct would be closed down in 2014. after the organisation became entangled in and failed to deliver correctly a number of contracts to deliver NHS 111.\n\n"}

According to the French Wikipedia he died on August 8, 2017.\n\nAs of early 1967, he was the international manager for the French company Musicdisc which was the first French company to push 4-track cartridges. In 1967, he was announcing that his company was going to sell 4-track cartridges rather than 8-tracks. The following year he had said in an article that the company had switched to 8-tracks and they were having trouble satisfying the demand for them. \nAround 1969/1970, Jaubert produced a number of recordings for John Lee Hooker which included \"Baby Don't Do Me Wrong\", \"Call It The Night\" and \"Going Home\". \nHe was still heading the international department for Musicdisc in 1971.\n\nDuring the 1970s, he produced the album \"Candy Girl\" for Mal Waldron. The album never saw a proper release and only about 50 copies were pressed. Decades later in 2016, a copy of the LP would sell for US $1215.

He discovered Chantal Curtis one day in the 1970s, overhearing her talking to a friend on a Paris street. Liking the sound of her voice, he asked her if she could sing and then offered her work.

Related activities such as brothel keeping and solicitation are prohibited. UNAIDS estimate there to be 755 prostitutes on the islands, the majority are migrants from other Caribbean countries. They tend to move around the Caribbean, never staying in one territory for long. Prostitution is on the rise due to economic conditions, \n\nIn the capital, St. John's, there is a red-light district in Popeshead Street. The most famous brothel in the street was Wendy's. It had operated for a number of years and was a household name on the island. In 2016 the owners were charged with trafficking. A 'rescue mission' raided the establishment in 2018, looking for trafficking victims. The nearby 'Jam Dung' was also raided.\n\nThe NGO, 'Health, Hope and HIV Network', offers counselling and testing for HIV and other STIs to sex workers. Their motto is 'Creating Positive Change' and the organisation receives government funding.\n\nSex trafficking is a problem in Antigua and Barbuda.\n\nThe country is a destination and transit country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Documented and undocumented immigrants from the Caribbean region, notably from Jamaica, Guyana, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic, as well as from Southeast Asia, are most vulnerable to trafficking. Sex trafficking has been reported in bars, taverns, and brothels. Recruitment of victims has often involved the promise of opportunities, such as a job offer to work as a dancer in a club. There are anecdotal reports of children subjected to sex trafficking, including by parents and caregivers. There have been concerns about trafficking-related complicity by police officers.\n\nThe Trafficking in Persons (Prevention) Act, 2010, which was amended in 2015 to vest jurisdiction for trafficking cases to the High Court of Justice, prohibits all forms of trafficking and prescribes punishments of 20 to 30 years imprisonment and fines of 400,000 to 600,000 Eastern Caribbean dollars. Experts noted the prosecutor’s office had limited staff and resources and were concerned the police were not undertaking proactive raids to uncover sex trafficking cases. Between 2010 and 2015, a total of 43 women were reported to the Directorate of Gender Affairs as being trafficked.\n\nThe United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Antigua and Barbuda as a 'Tier 2' country.\n"}

Most of the estimated 3,100 prostitutes in the Gambia are from Senegal. Prostitution takes place on the beach, in bars and hotels on the coast. Away from the coast, prostitution mainly takes place in bars. The bars are frequently raided and the foreign prostitutes deported. They often return within a few days.\n\nThe HIV infection rate for prostitutes is high.\n\nGambia is a popular destination for sex tourism. One of the most popular areas is the \"Senegambia strip\", the coastal area around Kololi, and is often arranged through local \"bumsters\".\n\nSex tourism in the Gambia attract western female tourists eager for sex with younger men.\n\nThe Gambian Tourist Board plans to change the face of tourism in the country and encourage tourism for wildlife and heritage rather than sex.\n\nChild prostitution is a problem in the Gambia. The Gambian government is taking an active stance against it. Many young people turn to the sex trade due to poverty.\n\nThe Gambia ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child on 3 August 1990, and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child in September 2000, which mandates the government to protect children from sexual child abuse. The main legislation is the Tourism Offences Act, 2003, which is describes a child as anyone under eighteen, even though the legal age of consent is sixteen years. The Tourism Act means that anyone employed in the tourism industry is committing a crime if s/he offers sexual favours to customers for money. The punishment is a fine, imprisonment of a maximum of two years and disqualification from tourism related work for ten years. The law states that hotel operators can face a fine and five years in prison if they knowingly allow child prostitution on their property.\n\nChild prostitution is particularly prevalent around the Tourist Development Area, as well as in Kololi, Senegambia and Pipeline.\n\nSome girls are sent to be prostitutes by their parents to support their families.\n\nWithin The Gambia, girls and, to a lesser extent, boys are subjected to sex trafficking. Children from West African countries, mainly Senegal, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ghana, Nigeria, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Benin. are recruited for commercial sexual exploitation in The Gambia. The majority of these victims are subjected to sexual exploitation by child sex tourists, primarily from Britain, Germany, Scandinavia, the Netherlands and Canada. In recent years, sex traffickers are increasingly hosting child sex tourists in private residences outside the commercial tourist areas of Banjul, making the crime harder for law enforcement to detect. Traffickers have allegedly exploited Sierra Leonean boys and girls as “cultural dancers” in The Gambia. Observers believe organised sex trafficking networks use European and Gambian travel agencies to promote child sex tourism.\n\nThe Gambia is a Tier 2 Watch List country for Human trafficking according to the US Department of State. The Gambian 2007 Trafficking Act prohibits trafficking and those convicted can be sentenced to prison for up to 50 years.\n\nThe Gambia is a source and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking.

Psychic vampires are represented in the occult beliefs of various cultures and in fiction.\n\nTerms used to describe the substance or essence that psychic vampires take or receive from others include: \"energy\", \"qi\" (or \"ch'i\"), \"life force\", \"prana\", and \"vitality\". There is no scientific or medical evidence supporting the existence of the bodily or psychic energy they allegedly drain.\n\nAmerican author Albert Bernstein uses the phrase \"emotional vampire\" for people with various personality disorders who are often considered to drain emotional energy from others.\n\nThe term \"energy vampire\" is also used metaphorically to refer to people whose influence leaves a person feeling exhausted, unfocused, and depressed, without ascribing the phenomenon to psychic interference.\n\nDion Fortune wrote of psychic parasitism in relation to vampirism as early as 1930 in her book, \"Psychic Self-Defense\". Fortune considered psychic vampirism a combination of psychic and psychological pathology, and distinguished between what she considered to be true psychic vampirism and mental conditions that produce similar symptoms. For the latter, she named folie à deux and similar phenomena.\n\nThe term \"psychic vampire\" was popularized in the 1960s by Anton LaVey and his Church of Satan. LaVey wrote on the topic in his book, \"The Satanic Bible\", and claimed to have coined the term. LaVey used \"psychic vampire\" to mean a spiritually or emotionally weak person who drains vital energy from other people. Adam Parfrey likewise attributed the term to LaVey in an introduction to \"The Devil's Notebook\". The terms \"energy vampire\" and \"psychic vampire\" have been used as synonyms in Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union as part of an occult revival.\n\nSociologists such as Mark Benecke and A. Asbjorn Jon. have identified a subculture of people who present themselves as vampires. Jon has noted that enthusiasts of the vampire subculture emulate traditional psychic vampires in that they describe 'prey[ing] upon life-force or 'pranic' energy'.\n\nA related mythological creature is a sexual vampire, which is supposed to feed off sexual energy. Sexual vampires include succubi or incubi.\n\nPsychic vampires are featured in the 1985 science fiction film \"Lifeforce\".\n\nSinger/songwriter Tristen Gaspadarek tells of her experiences with a psychic vampire in the song \"Psychic Vampire\" on her 2017 album \"Sneaker Waves\".\n\nIn the TV show, \"Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency\", the characters known as the Rowdy Three are called \"Psychic Vampires\" because they feed on Psychic energy. The members are Martin, Gripps, Cross, Vogel, Amanda, and the Beast. There are more than three, and they are \"very much aware\" of the fact. Notably, the Rowdy 3 is composed of four people, and later five, and then six at the end of the show, and are some of the people studied by the government organization tracking Dirk. They were originally classified as vampires, as they live by eating people's emotional energy.\n\n"}

Historically, the singing began on the evening before the festival, but today it is much more common for the singing to occur on the main day of the festival. In general, an initial \"challenge phrase\" (\"câu ra\") from the known body of songs is sung by a pair of female singers, following which a pair of male singers will respond by selecting and singing a \"matching phrase\" (\"câu đối\"), which must repeat the melody of the challenge phrase. Once they are finished, the order is reversed, and the men will issue their own challenge phrase with a different melody. While in the past the singing was unaccompanied, it is common today for the singers to be accompanied by instruments, whether traditional Vietnamese instruments or modern ones such as electric keyboards.\n\nThere are a huge number of \"quan họ\" melodies, with thousands of different songs having been recorded and written down in score form. A simpler variant of response song, allowing spoken responses and sung by boys and girls at village festivals is trống quân singing.\n\n"}

Grant, Publisher, Inc. in February 2012 and in a mass market edition by Scribner in May..\n\nThe design of the Scribner edition cover was done by Platinum Fmd, the creators of the cover for King's 2009 novel \"Under the Dome\", and Rex Bonomelli, Scribner's art director and designer. The preliminary version was simpler than the final version, which was designed to \"give the cover a little more drama\".\n\nThe novel begins with Roland and his ka-tet arriving at a river on their journey to the Dark Tower. An elderly man who operates a ferry gets them across the river, and warns them that a severe depression (starkblast) is coming, and that they can find shelter in a building a few miles ahead. They reach the shelter just in time, and while they wait out the storm, Roland tells them of an adventure in his youth to keep them occupied: \"The Skin-Man.\"\n\nFollowing the death of Roland's mother, his father sends him and his friend Jamie De Curry west to the town of Debaria on a mission to capture the Skin-Man, an apparent shape-shifter who terrorizes the town and surrounding areas by transforming into various animals at night and embarking on murderous rampages. Roland and Jamie take a train to Debaria, but it derails before arriving and they must finish their journey on horse. On their way, they pass through a town known as Serenity, a community of women where Roland's mother lived after suffering a mental breakdown following her affair with Marten Broadcloak, an alias of the sorcerer Randall Flagg and Roland's nemesis. It is here that they learn of a woman attacked by the Skin-Man and hear her tale.\n\nRoland and Jamie arrive in Debaria, and with the help of the local Sheriff, Hugh Peavy, they determine that the Skin-Man is most likely a salt miner from a nearby village. The next morning, they discover that another brutal attack has occurred overnight on a local farm. They investigate the scene, and discover a single survivor, a small boy named Bill, who has lost his father in the attack. Roland and Jamie determine that the murderer left the scene on horseback, and Roland sends Jamie to the salt mines to round up every miner who has a horse or is able to ride one. While returning to Debaria with Bill, Roland performs his hypnotism trick (which Roland first used in his chronological life in Wizard and Glass) with one of his spare rounds of ammunition. Under hypnosis, Bill relates what he saw of the Skin-Man; Bill tells Roland that he saw the Skin-Man in his human form after the attack, but only glimpsed his feet. He states that the Skin-Man had a tattoo of a blue ring around his ankle. The tattoo indicates that the man spent time in the prison at a (now abandoned) military barracks further west of Debaria. That area had fallen to the chaos of John Farson, the Good Man, within the last generation. Back in town, Roland brings Bill to a cell in Sheriff's station. He plans to walk each suspect past Bill in the hopes the young boy can identify the Skin-Man, or that the Skin-Man will reveal himself by fleeing due to fear of being identified. While Roland and Bill wait for Jamie to round up the suspects, Roland tells Bill a story from his own childhood, \"The Wind Through the Keyhole.\"\n\nIn this story (within a story), a boy named Tim Ross lives with his mother Nell in a forgotten village that fears the annual collection of property taxes by a man named The Covenant Man. Tim recently lost his father, who was said to have been killed by a dragon while in the woods chopping trees. After the death of his father, Nell, no longer able to pay the taxes to keep their home, marries his father's best friend and business partner Bern Kells, who moves in with them. Kells is a mean man, prone to heavy drinking, who begins to abuse both Tim and Nell. One day The Covenant Man comes to collect the taxes, and he secretly tells Tim to meet him later in the woods. During this meeting, The Covenant Man reveals to Tim that it was actually Kells who killed his father, not a dragon, and with help of a scrying bowl shows Kells beating his mother, causing her to go blind. Later, The Covenant Man sends Tim a vision telling him that if Tim again visits The Covenant Man in the woods, he will give Tim magic that will allow his mother to see again. Tim, armed with a gun given to him by his school teacher, journeys into the dangerous woods, and is led into a swamp by the mischievous fairy, Armaneeta. Here, Tim almost becomes victim to a dragon and other mysterious swamp creatures, but he is saved by his gun as well as a group of friendly swamp people, who mistake him for a gunslinger. The swamp people guide him to the far side of the swamp, and equip him with a small mechanical talking device from the 'Old People' that helps guide him on his journey. Eventually, Tim arrives at a Dogan where he finds a caged 'tyger', which wears the key to the Dogan around its neck. A starkblast approaches, and Tim, realizing this is likely a trap set for him by The Covenant Man, befriends the tyger. Tim and the tyger ride out the storm under a magical protective blanket. The next morning, Tim discovers that the tyger is actually Maerlyn, a white magician, who had been trapped in the cage for years due to black magic. Maerlyn gives Tim a potion to cure his mother's blindness and sends him back to his mother on the flying magic blanket. Returning home, Tim brings sight back to his mother. Tim is attacked by Kells, who had secretly entered the home as Tim tended to his mother, but the boy is saved by his mother, who kills Kells with her late husband's ax.\n\nAs Roland finishes telling \"The Wind Through the Keyhole,\" Jamie arrives back in Debaria with the salt mine suspects. Young Bill is able to identify the Skin-Man due to his ankle tattoo and an associated scar, at which time the Skin-Man transforms into a snake, and kills two people. Roland shoots the snake with a specially-crafted silver bullet (which he had made upon their arrival in town), killing it. Roland and Jamie travel back to Serenity, where the women agree to adopt young Bill, who is now an orphan. The women also give Roland a note written by his mother during her stay in Serenity. In this note, his mother reveals that Marten has predicted that Roland will one day kill her. Although this has caused her to slowly lose her sanity, in the end she forgives Roland and asks that he forgive her infidelity to his father and betrayal of Gilead in return.\n\nWith his Skin-Man story finished, Roland and his ka-tet find that the starkblast has passed, leveling every structure in the area except for the building in which they took shelter. They soon pack their belongings and resume their journey toward the Dark Tower.\n\nAn early review of the book by Kevin Quigley noted how well it meshed with novels in the series that came before and after. \"Most importantly, it manages to retain the quest structure of the first four novels and also subtly underscores King's obsession with the nature of fiction in the latter books, providing a necessary bridge between the two halves of the series.\" Zack Handlen too wondered if the late addition would stand up and found it in fact better than other parts of the sequence: “Where other books of the Dark Tower sequence got bogged down by a vain effort to make sense of it all, \"Wind Through The Keyhole\" has a light, easy touch.\" While impressed on the whole, James Kidd writing in \"The Independent\" noted the book's episodic nature, commenting that “it isn’t a novel but a triptych of novellas nesting inside one another”. But he was unhappy with the quality of the prose, describing it as a mixture of “King’s pithy folk wisdom and cod Shakespeare”.\n"}

Called Turnerville, he opened the site to the public in 1921.\n\nTurnerville quickly became one of the state's most popular attractions, but it was plagued by damage from adjacent Turkey Creek flooding and a fire burned down the Indian pueblo in 1935. The train was added in 1939 and the name became Tiny Town.\n\nOn August 11, 2010 fifteen people were injured as a train entered a curve at the park going between 12 and 17 mph, causing five of the six cars to tip over. An investigation determined the operator was not adequately trained in steam locomotive operation which resulted in confusion of the brake and throttle levers. The state fined Tiny Town $30,500 consisting of $1000 per incident the operator operated the train and $500 for not having documented training of emergency and safety procedures.\n\n\n\n"}

The most publicized awards in Japanese professional wrestling, they are recognized by all the major promotions in the country, including All Japan Pro Wrestling, New Japan Pro-Wrestling, and Pro Wrestling Noah.\n\nThe awards are voted for by a committee made up of people involved with Japanese professional wrestling, including reporters and photographers. After the winners are announced in the middle of December, an award ceremony is held in Tokyo in January. Voting takes place in rounds. In landslide cases, the winner can be determined in a single round of voting, however, if no wrestler gets enough votes, the award can be left blank and not given out that year. Most notably, the award for female wrestler of the year was not given out between 2004 and 2008 and again in 2014, when the committee felt that no wrestler had the necessary qualifications.\n\nThe awards have been described as \"legit to a degree\", but also with the goal of spreading them among different major promotions. For example, the award for the best technical wrestler may not be given to someone actually considered the best technical wrestler in \"puroresu\", but to a top wrestler from a promotion that has not gotten any of the other awards. There are currently ten active awards given out by \"Tokyo Sports\", including one dedicated to sport wrestling.\n\n\n\n"}
