{"id": "654004", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=654004", "title": "11001001", "text": "11001001\n\n\"11001001\" is the 14th episode of the of the American science fiction television series \"\". It was first broadcast on February 1, 1988, in the United States in broadcast syndication. It was written by Maurice Hurley and Robert Lewin, and directed by Paul Lynch.\n\nSet in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the crew of the Starfleet starship \"Enterprise\"-D. In this episode, members of an alien race called the Bynars hijack a nearly evacuated \"Enterprise\" while retrofitting the computer in space dock.\n\nMake-up supervisor Michael Westmore created the look of the Bynars, who were four women in extensive make-up. The musical score was scored by Ron Jones. Reviewers praised the Bynars themselves, and the response to the episode was generally positive, with one critic calling it the best of the season. It was awarded an Emmy Award for Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series.\n\nThe Federation starship \"Enterprise\" arrives at Starbase 74 for a routine maintenance check. Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) and Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) greet Starbase Commander Quinteros (Gene Dynarski) and two pairs of small humanoid aliens known as Bynars; the Bynars heavily rely on their computer technology and work in pairs for best efficiency. Much of the crew take shore leave while Picard, Riker and a skeleton crew remain aboard. Riker is intrigued by the Bynars' claimed upgrades to the holodeck and starts a program in a jazz bar. The program includes a woman named Minuet (Carolyn McCormick), by whom Riker is fascinated, both as a beautiful and charming woman, but also by the level of sophistication in her responses. Riker shortly returns, and Picard walks in on him kissing Minuet, and he too is amazed by the simulation.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bynars discreetly create a catastrophic failure in the ship's warp core. Lt. Cmdr. Data (Brent Spiner) and Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) are unable to locate Picard or Riker and, assuming them to already be on the Starbase, order an emergency evacuation. They set the ship to leave the Starbase and warp to a safe location before it would explode. However, once they are clear of the dock, the failure disappears and the ship sets course for the Bynar system, the planet Bynaus orbiting Beta Magellan. Data, La Forge, and Quinteros realize that the Bynars are still aboard the ship, but there are currently no other working vessels to follow them. Back on the \"Enterprise\", Riker and Picard leave the simulation to find the ship empty and at warp to the Bynar system, with the ship's controls locked to the bridge. Fearing that the Bynars have taken over the ship for nefarious purposes, they set the ship to self-destruct in 5 minutes and then take the bridge by inter-ship transporter beam and find the Bynars there unconscious.\n\nAfter cancelling the self-destruct, they find the Bynars have uploaded massive amounts of information to the \"Enterprise\" computers, but they are unable to decode it. Realizing that Minuet was purposely created by the Bynars as a distraction, Picard and Riker ask the simulation about what is going on as the ship nears the orbit of Bynar. Minuet explains that a star near the Bynar homeworld had gone supernova, and the EMP it emitted would knock out their computer systems, effectively killing the Bynars. They had used the \"Enterprise\" to upload their computer information for safekeeping and then planned to download it back to the Bynar computers after the threat of the EMP had passed. With Data's help, Picard and Riker successfully download the data, and the Bynars recover. They apologize for their actions, having feared that Starfleet would refuse to help, though Picard notes they only had to ask. As the \"Enterprise\" returns to Starbase, Riker returns to the holodeck to thank Minuet but finds that without the Bynar data, the simulation has regressed to the expected norm for the holodeck, and while Minuet still exists, she is not the same as before. Riker reports to Picard that Minuet is gone.\n\nThe name \"11001001\" is a binary number, a contraction of the names of the Bynars (One One, Zero Zero, One Zero, and Zero One). The episode at one point was called \"10101001\". It was originally intended that this episode would take place prior to \"The Big Goodbye\", with the Bynars' modifications causing the problems with the holodeck seen in that episode. Instead it was changed to the Bynars aiming to fix the holodeck to prevent those problems re-occurring. The Bynars themselves were played by young women. Children were considered for the parts, but the production team thought that it would be too problematic because of the limited time they could work each day and the need to hire teachers. Each actress was required to wear extensive make-up, which was created by make-up supervisor Michael Westmore. A large single-piece bald cap was made from the same mold for each actress, which required some customised trimming to get it to fit properly. To cover up problems with the seams of the cap, some fake hair was added on the Bynars' necks. Each actress also controlled the flashing light inside the apparatus on the side of the headpiece through a battery pack attached to the waistband of their costumes. To disguise their voices, the pitch was lowered in post production. It was originally planned to add subtitles over the Bynars' conversations between themselves.\n\nThe image of the Starbase orbiting a planet was re-used from \"\". The score was created by Ron Jones, who incorporated jazz themes composed by John Beasley. The episode was written by Maurice Hurley and Robert Lewin. Hurley was pleased with the outcome of the episode, praising the work of Westmore on the Bynars' makeup and the performance of Jonathan Frakes. Frakes enjoyed the episode too, saying, \"A fabulous show. Those were the kind of chances we took first season that when they worked, they worked great. It was a very chancy show and I loved it.\" Director Paul Lynch also thought that the Bynars were \"great\". Carolyn McCormick appeared as Minuet and subsequently became a regular cast member in Law and Order. She returned to the role of Minuet in the episode \"Future Imperfect\". Gene Dynarski had previously appeared as Ben Childress in \"\" episode \"Mudd's Women\" and Krodak in \"The Mark of Gideon\".\n\n\"11001001\" aired in broadcast syndication during the week commencing February 7, 1988. It received Nielsen ratings of 10.7, reflecting the percentage of all households watching the episode during its timeslot. These ratings were lower than both the episodes broadcast both before and afterwards. For their work in this episode, Bill Wistrom, Wilson Dyer, Mace Matiosian, James Wolvington, Gerry Sackman and Keith Bilderbeck were awarded an Emmy Award for Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series. \"TV Guide\" ranked it No. 6 on its list of the top 10 \"Star Trek\" episodes for the magazine's celebration of the franchise's 30th anniversary.\n\nSeveral reviewers re-watched the episode after the end of the series. James Hunt reviewed the episode for the website \"Den of Geek\" in January 2013. He was surprised by the episode as he \"went in expecting something that was typically season one awful, and got something that was actually a lot of fun\". He thought that the theme of symbiosis between man and machine was \"interesting\", stating it was the best episode up until that point in season one and one of the best of the season overall. Zack Handlen watched the episode for \"The A.V. Club\" in May 2010. He too was surprised by what he found. Handlen said that \"last time I saw it, I thought Riker and Minuet's interactions were cheesy as hell. They didn't bother me so much now, because they don't go on very long, and there's something hilarious about a man trying to seduce a computer simulation designed to respond to his seductions\". But he said, \"I had fun with this, which I wasn't expecting\", and \"thought this was solid\". He gave the episode a B grade.\n\nKeith DeCandido reviewed the episode for Tor.com in June 2011. He described it as \"one of the strongest first-season episodes\", and the Bynars as \"one of the finest alien species \"Trek\" has provided\". He also thought that turning off the auto-destruct with two minutes to go instead of mere seconds neatly avoided a cliché, and gave it a score of seven out of ten. Michelle Erica Green for TrekNation watched the episode in June 2007. She thought that it came \"very close to being a really good episode\". She also thought that Picard and Riker's actions were the \"most boneheaded joint behavior by the top two officers\", in that they got distracted by a female character on the holodeck and didn't notice the ship being evacuated. Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website \"Jammer's Reviews\" described \"11001001\" as \"easily season one's best and most memorable episode\". He thought that it was the \"season's most solid sci-fi concept\" and that the series was \"firing on all cylinders, with everything coming together, from plot to character, to sensible use of technology and action\". He gave it a score of four out of four.\n\nThe first home media release of \"11001001\" was on VHS cassette, appearing on August 26, 1992, in the United States and Canada. The episode was later included on the \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" season one DVD box set, released in March 2002, and then released as part of the season one Blu-ray set on July 24, 2012.\n\n\n"}

Tolkien's \"The Hobbit\") each consisting of three issues and centers around a Russian Spetsnaz colonel.\n\nIn the first part the colonel leads a Russian team investigating a plane crash in Afghanistan. Violence soon erupts after first British and then American military forces become involved in the investigation. In the aftermath, the colonel helps a wounded British Special Air Service trooper who translates a document found on the plane.

The story also focuses on the problems of illegal Mexican immigrants apparently exploited at a slaughterhouse called \"McHell\". The Colonel eventually assassinates the President of the United States with the intention of stopping the Global War on Terror, using a Lee–Enfield rifle using only iron sights, firing from behind a closed window.\n\nThe title of the series refers to a .303 British calibre Lee–Enfield rifle.\n\nThe issues have been collected as a trade paperback:\n\n"}

{"id": "11548711", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11548711", "title": "AG Bear", "text": "AG Bear\n\nAG Bear or Almost Grown Bear is a talking teddy bear that responds to human voice. He was designed by Ron Milner, and manufactured by Axlon, a company formed by Nolan Bushnell, founder of Atari and Chuck E. Cheese, through his Catalyst Technologies venture capital firm. The manufacturer's tag on AG—which stands for \"Almost Grown\"--lists the bear's production date as 1985.\n\nThe bear was a commercial success due to its interactive capabilities: AG Bear is equipped with a voice box which was originally intended to mimic the intonation of the human voice or other sounds in the environment, but expectations changed when children discovered that AG could respond with a spontaneous voice. AG Bear's voice is synth with some \"growling\". The company referred to this as \"bear talk\". When two AG bears are placed beside each other, they interact once one of them starts talking (sound is what makes AG bear react, so the sound of one AG Bear would set the other one talking, and so on). \n\nAG Bear was released in several different fur colors: the traditional bear is brown, while other bear colors include white and grey. AG's traditional clothing is a blue corduroy shirt with a gold AG Bear monogram, although a red corduroy version also exists. Several other versions of the bear were released over time, including GrandPaw AG, GrandMaw AG, Bearonica (AG's sister), and several Baby AG's.\n\nWhen Axlon was eventually sold to Hasbro, AG Bear production was halted. But in the late 1990s, a multi-year lobbying effort resulted in an agreement to resume production of the original AG in a limited run edition. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "984233", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=984233", "title": "Air (visual novel)", "text": "Air (visual novel)\n\nAir is a Japanese adult visual novel developed by Key released on September 8, 2000 for Windows PCs. Key later released versions of \"Air\" without the erotic content, and the game was ported to the Dreamcast, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita. The story follows the life of Yukito Kunisaki, a traveling showman searching for the \"girl in the sky\". He arrives in a quiet, seaside town where he meets three girls, one of whom is the key to the end of his journey.\n\nThe gameplay in \"Air\" follows a branching plot line which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the three female main characters by the player character. The game is divided into three segments—Dream, Summer, and Air—which serve as different phases in the overall story. The title of the game reflects the prominent themes of the air, skies, and use of wings throughout gameplay. The game ranked as the best-selling PC game sold in Japan for the time of its release, and charted in the national top 50 several more times afterwards. \"Air\" has sold over 300,000 units across several platforms.\n\nFollowing the game's release, \"Air\" made several transitions into other media. A manga by Yukimaru Katsura was serialized in Kadokawa Shoten's \"Comptiq\", and later published into two volumes. Comic anthologies and art books were also published, as were audio dramas and several albums of music. Kyoto Animation produced a 13-episode anime television series and a two-episode anime mini-series in 2005, and Toei Animation produced an anime film in 2005. The anime adaptations are licensed by Funimation who released them in North America.\n\n\"Air\" is a romance visual novel in which the player assumes the role of three characters. Much of its gameplay is spent on reading the story's narrative and dialogue. \"Air\" follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction. With the consumer ports, if an undesired choice was selected, there would be an option to rewind the story to correct the mistake. However, if the player reaches a bad end to a storyline, the player does not have this option and must reload the game at the last saved point.\n\nThere are five main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, three which are initially available and two more which can later become available. Throughout gameplay, the player is given multiple options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction.\n\nWhen first playing the game, the player assumes the role of Yukito Kunisaki and the scenarios for the three heroines are available in what is called the Dream story arc. After the plot lines for these three heroines have been completed, an additional scenario called Summer is made available where the player assumes the role of Ryūya. Summer is a linear novel arc in which no choices are presented to the player. Upon the completion of the Summer route, another scenario called Air is made available, which serves as the true ending to the story. In Air, the player assumes the role of a crow named Sora. In the adult versions of the game, there are scenes with sexual CGs depicting Yukito and a given heroine having sex. Later, Key released versions of \"Air\" without the erotic content.\n\nThere are important locations featured in \"Air\" that are based on places in the city Kami in Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan. \"Air\" is set in the Kasumi district of Kami; during the course of the series' creation, Kasumi was an individual town that has since merged with two others to form the city of Kami. Many of the locales in \"Air\", such as the seawall, the train station, the shrine, and the school are based on real places. As \"Air\" is set in the middle of summer, the season offers bright, sunny skies for the town during the day. In the manga adaptation, the town is described as a \"quiet town with few people...with nothing but beaches and countryside.\" Scenario assistant Yūichi Suzumoto has commented that his impression of \"Air\" is similar to that of a folk song due to the rural setting and heartwarming story progression.\n\nAs indicated by the title, air, skies and wings are important themes: Yukito is searching for the \"girl in the sky\", and Misuzu believes that her other self is flying in the sky above her. Other characters show a similar relationship to the sky, such as Minagi who is a member of the astronomy club, and Michiru who has a fondness for bubbles that float in the air. Kano wants wings to fly, and Kanna already has them. Misuzu names a crow she finds —Japanese for \"sky\". Another major theme is the maternal bond, as the four heroines' stories, as well as Yukito's, revolve around their mothers, either biological or adoptive. Main scenario writer Jun Maeda commented that he prefers to include mothers in games if given the choice between only including a mother or a father, as is what happened with \"Air\", though he backs this up by noting that in bishōjo games, women are the main focus anyway. Complicated relationships involving family members and friends play a key part throughout the story. One of the sub-themes in the story is magic. Uraha, Yukito's mother, and Yukito himself have the ability to use magic, though Yukito is the least skilled among them. Kano was told by her sister that when she grows up and takes off her yellow ribbon, she will gain the power to do magic. However, the problems of parents leaving their offspring and poverty are displayed realistically.\n\nThe player assumes the role of Yukito Kunisaki, the protagonist of \"Air\". He lives a poor life going from town to town with little money, trying to make a living off his show with a puppet. By being an adolescent or young adult, Yukito sometimes acts childishly if provoked. Yukito tends to be helpful to those around him while trying to earn any money at the same time, and does his best to look after Misuzu in the Dream arc. Misuzu Kamio, the main heroine of \"Air\", makes Yukito quite mistrustful at first by being too friendly, but eventually earns his affection. She is a cheerful but introverted, slightly clumsy and simplistic high school girl, and often utters the pseudo-dinosauric phrase \"gao\" when she feels troubled, a habit she retained from childhood. Misuzu has a great love of dinosaurs, finding the story of their glory and extinction \"romantic\". As a child, her fascination with dinosaurs stemmed from thinking chicks would grow into them; her adoptive mother Haruko Kamio thinks it is ridiculous.\n\nThe second of the three heroines Yukito meets after Misuzu is Kano Kirishima, a girl attending the same school as Misuzu. She is usually energetic, playful, and tells jokes by saying nonsensical things. Kano is friends with a strange stray dog named Potato that follows her around and is able to communicate in his strange manner of speech. Kano still believes in things she was told by her older sister Hijiri as a child as a way of coping with her past. The third and final heroine Yukito meets is a girl in Misuzu's class at school named Minagi Tohno, a top student in the school who is introverted as well. Until she met Yukito, her only friend was Michiru, with whom she often blows bubbles at the abandoned train station in town.\n\n\"Air\" story revolves around three girls whose lives are connected to the same man. In the first story arc, Dream, Yukito Kunisaki is a showman traveling across Japan, continuing his late mother's search for the \"girl in the sky\". The story opens on Monday July 17, 2000 when Yukito comes across a small seaside town where the story takes place. On his first day in town, Yukito tries to earn money by putting on a mysterious puppet show where he manipulates a doll magically without strings for a small audience of kids passing by. Yukito is unsuccessful in gaining the children's favor, and the children leave without paying him for his performance. That night, Yukito sleeps on the town's seawall by the beach. Yukito collapses from heat stroke the next day and is taken to a nearby fisherman's guild; after he awakens, they feed him, and give him some very large rice balls to take with him as he is leaving. As he sits on the town's seawall eating one of the rice balls, he notices a young girl beside him who introduces herself as Misuzu Kamio—a sincere yet clumsy girl who is eager to become friends with him. Misuzu persistently attempts to play with him, while Yukito tries to refuse her efforts. He eventually follows her home lured by the chance to eat. After Haruko, Misuzu's aunt and foster mother, is persuaded, it is decided that he will stay with them for the time being.\n\nThe next day, Yukito meets a girl named Kano Kirishima and a stray dog named Potato; Kano and Misuzu go to the same high school. Later that day, Yukito meets a third girl named Minagi Tohno, Misuzu's classmate, and her friend Michiru. Like Misuzu, both Kano and Minagi have strange personalities connected with mysterious pasts. Before long, a legend of \"one thousand summers\" begins to unfold where the mysteries of the past are framed primarily by the relationship between Yukito and Misuzu. The cursed \"girl in the sky\" Yukito has been searching for turns out to be Misuzu. By the time he figures this out, she has already grown to love him and has passed her 15th birthday. Once these things have come to pass, the \"girl in the sky\" is cursed to die. The remainder of this arc is dedicated to Yukito's attempt to save her, trying to effectively break the curse.\n\nThe next arc, Summer, reveals events that occurred in the summer of one thousand years before the Dream arc, taking place in the Heian period. Kannabi no mikoto, or Kanna, is one of the last winged beings in \"Air\"s fictional setting and is held as a prisoner in her own castle. Since she bears wings on her back, she is not permitted to leave the castle walls or see her mother, who is in a similar situation elsewhere. With Ryūya, a member of her samurai guard, and Uraha, a fledgling telekinetic, Kanna escapes and traverses feudal Japan to find her mother. However, the rest of the guard and a sect of Buddhist monks follow them. After catching up, they place a curse on Kanna where she must endure constant reincarnation and death whenever she finds love; Misuzu is one such reincarnation.\n\nIn the last arc, Air, Yukito's final wish to save Misuzu's life is heard. The timeline of the Dream arc has been reset, although it is now seen through the viewpoint of a crow Misuzu finds and names Sora. New things are revealed that were not seen following Yukito in the Dream arc. After Misuzu finds Sora and brings him back home, her condition worsens and eventually she forgets even who Haruko is. Misuzu's father, Keisuke Tachibana, shows up during this arc wanting to take Misuzu back to his home, but Haruko pleads with him to grant her more time, and they agree on extending the time for three more days. After the three days pass, Keisuke comes back and sees the love between Misuzu and Haruko; he decides to let them stay together. The remainder of this arc has Misuzu and Haruko spending time together like mother and daughter, culminating in Misuzu's death.\n\nAfter the completion of \"Kanon\", the Key staff started production on \"Air\" and expanded the number of people involved in this project compared to \"Kanon\". The executive producer for \"Air\" was Takahiro Baba from VisualArt's, the publishing company that Key is under. The planning for \"Air\" was headed by Jun Maeda who was also one of two main scenario writers, the other being Takashi Ishikawa. Scenario assistance was provided by four more people: Kazuki Fujii, Kai, Tōya Okano, and Yūichi Suzumoto. Art direction was headed by Key's artist Itaru Hinoue who worked on the character design. Further computer graphics were split between three people—Miracle Mikipon, Na-Ga, and Shinory—and background art was provided by Din and Torino. The music in the game was composed primarily by Shinji Orito, Jun Maeda, and Magome Togoshi, who had started working with Key since before \"Kanon\"s release. After the completion of \"Air\", two of the staff—Kazuki Fujii, and Takashi Ishikawa—left Key.\n\nJun Maeda, the main scenario writer of \"Air\", commented that in the early stages of \"Air\" production, it was already decided that it was to be an adult game, and he further assumes that if it was not at least first released with adult content, that it would not have been as commercially successful. Maeda also commented that he wanted to write \"Air\" to give players the chance to experience the entire story as a whole rather than just a sum of differing parts as typical bishōjo games do, including \"Kanon\". While attempting to do this, Maeda also tried to simultaneously make it seem similar to typical visual novels in the same genre as \"Air\" to give the game appeal to the players who often play such games. As such, while the game incorporates stories from several characters, they are all of varying lengths.\n\n\"Air\" was released as an adult game on September 8, 2000 as a limited edition, playable on a Windows PC as a 2-disc CD-ROM set. The limited edition came bundled with the remix album \"Ornithopter\" remixing background music tracks featured in the visual novel. The regular edition was released on July 27, 2001. Key released on all ages version on July 27, 2001 for Windows. An updated adult version called the \"Air Standard Edition\" was released on April 8, 2005 with added support for Windows 2000/XP as a DVD-ROM. An updated all ages version of \"Air\" compatible for Windows Vista PCs was released by Key on July 31, 2009 in a box set containing five other Key visual novels called Key 10th Memorial Box. Another updated all ages version compatible for Windows 7 PCs called \"Air Memorial Edition\" was released on May 28, 2010.\n\nThe first consumer console port of the game was released for the Dreamcast (DC) on September 20, 2001 by NEC Interchannel. A PlayStation 2 (PS2) version was released on August 8, 2002 also by NEC Interchannel. The PS2 version was re-released as a \"Best\" version on September 1, 2005. The PS2 version was bundled in a \"Key 3-Part Work Premium Box\" package together with the PS2 versions of \"Kanon\" and \"Clannad\" released on July 30, 2009. To compensate for the lack of erotic content in the consumer ports, extra scenes were added.\n\nA version playable on SoftBank 3G mobile phones was released by Prototype through VisualArt's Motto on May 1, 2007. Prototype later released a VGA edition produced by NTT DoCoMo playable on FOMA phones in February 2008. The version for the FOMA phones was split into two separate files: the Dream story arc comprised the first file, and the remaining Summer and Air arcs comprised the second file. A version of the Dream arc playable on Android devices was released on July 27, 2012. A version containing the Summer and Air arcs for Android devices was released on August 15, 2012. A full version \"Air\" on Android devices was released on October 24, 2012 in two editions: one without voice acting, and one with voice acting, including Yukito. Two versions were released on May 2, 2013: an adult version for Android devices and an all ages version playable on iOS devices. A PlayStation Portable (PSP) version of the game was released in Japan on November 22, 2007 by Prototype. A downloadable version of the PSP release via the PlayStation Store was released by Prototype on September 2, 2010. A PlayStation Vita (PSV) version was released by Prototype on September 8, 2016. In the original release, there was no voice acting for the characters, though this was later changed for the DC version, which except for Yukito included full voice acting, and the PS2, PSP and PSV versions, which had full voice acting.\n\nAn \"Air\" manga was serialized in the Japanese computer game magazine \"Comptiq\" between August 10, 2004 and February 10, 2006. The individual chapters were later collected into two separate volumes published by Kadokawa Shoten. The story was adapted from the visual novel version that preceded it, and was illustrated by Japanese artist Yukimaru Katsura. Between the two volumes, there are 15 main chapters (nine in volume one and six in volume two), and two bonus chapters included at the end of each volume. The manga version goes through the Dream and Air arcs in detail while the Summer arc is only touched upon briefly throughout the manga. The main focus is on Misuzu's story with Kano and Minagi serving as minor characters in comparison. However, Minagi's story is explained in the bonus installment at the end of volume two.\n\nThere are also five sets of manga anthologies produced by different companies and drawn by a multitude of different artists. The first volume of the earliest anthology series, released by Ichijinsha under the title \"Air Comic Anthology\", was released on January 25, 2001 under their \"DNA Media Comics\" label. Volumes for this series continued to be released until December 25, 2001 with the seventh volume. The second anthology, \"Air Anthology Comic\", was released in a single volume by Softgarage on December 20, 2002. On April 17, 2004, Ohzora released an anthology composed of works based on both \"Kanon\" and \"Air\" titled \"Haru Urara: Kanon & Air\". Ohzora also released three other anthologies under the title \"Air\", the last of which came out on March 24, 2005. The last manga anthology was released as a single volume on April 2, 2005 by Jive titled \"Comic Anthology Air: Kimi no Iru Basho\". Each of the anthology series are written and drawn by an average of 20 people per volume.\n\nThere were nine drama CDs released based on \"Air\" released by Lantis. The first three focused solely on each of the main heroines separately per CD where the cover of the album would depict which of the girls to be presented. These three albums were released on August 24, 2005. The next set of three was done the same way and released on October 21, 2005. The last three were released in one month increments after the second batch of three drama CDs went on sale. The seventh CD focused on the events of the Summer arc in the story while the last two were based on the Air arc. At least the last CD released on January 25, 2006 contained original stories in addition to the story from the visual novel.\n\nOn November 17, 2004, a teaser DVD named \"Air prelude\" was produced containing interviews with the anime's cast, clean opening and ending theme video sequences, and promotional footage of the anime itself; it was a limited edition DVD, with only 20,000 copies produced. The anime television series is produced by Kyoto Animation, directed by Tatsuya Ishihara, written by Fumihiko Shimo, and features character design by Tomoe Aratani who based the designs on Itaru Hinoue's original concept. Thirteen episodes were produced by Kyoto Animation: 12 regular episodes, and a final recap episode which summarizes Misuzu's story arc. The anime also follows the game by splitting the series into three parts; Dream (episodes one through seven), Summer (episodes eight and nine), and Air (episodes 10 through 12), with the recap episode (episode 13) following. The episodes aired between January 6 and March 31, 2005 on the BS-i Japanese television network. The theme songs from the \"Air\" visual novel are used for the anime's opening theme, ending theme and soundtrack. After the conclusion of the anime series, a mini-series which added to the Summer arc of the story called \"Air in Summer\" aired on August 28 and September 4, 2005 a week later on BS-i. \"Air in Summer\" consisted of two episodes and was produced by the same staff as the anime series.\n\nA DVD released on March 31, 2005 called \"Air Memories\" contained promotional commercials for the series, staff commentaries, and clean ending sequences from the 12th and 13th episodes, lasting 92 minutes. The episodes were released to Region 2 DVD between April 6 and September 7, 2005 by Pony Canyon in limited and regular editions containing two episodes per volume. The DVD for \"Air in Summer\" was later released on October 5, 2005 in Japan. Additionally, \"Air\" became one of the first anime series to be released in Blu-ray Disc format on December 22, 2006. A new version of the Blu-ray Disc box set was released on November 28, 2008 in Japan.\n\nOn April 27, 2007, ADV Films co-founder and executive Matt Greenfield announced the acquisition of both the anime series and the film during a panel at the anime convention Anime Matsuri; it paid $145,000 for the TV series. The 12 main episodes and two \"Air in Summer\" episodes were licensed for North American distribution by ADV Films. The episodes were released on four DVD compilations between August 14 and November 27, 2007. The second DVD volume was sold in two editions, with the difference between the two being a series box all four DVDs could fit inside. In July 2008, the license for the anime series and film was transferred to Funimation, which continued to produce them in North America in English. Funimation released a three-disc series box set of the \"Air\" anime on April 21, 2009, which did not include the recap episode.\n\nAn \"Air\" animated film directed by Osamu Dezaki premiered in Japanese theaters on February 5, 2005. The film, animated by Toei Animation, is a reinterpretation of the original \"Air\" storyline which centers on the story arc of the female lead Misuzu Kamio. Yukito Kunisaki arrives in the town of Kami for a chance to earn money at the summer festival and meets Misuzu on his first day in town. They soon become friends and a story one thousand years old begins to unfold. The film was later sold on DVD and released in three editions: the Collector's Edition, the Special Edition, and the Regular Edition on August 5, 2005. The \"Air\" film was originally released on DVD by ADV Films in North America on December 11, 2007. Funimation continued the release of the film as of July 2008 when the license was transferred from ADV to Funimation; Funimation re-released the film on April 21, 2009.\n\nThe visual novel has three main theme songs: the opening theme , the ending theme \"Farewell song\", and as an insert song. Each song is sung by Lia of I've Sound and the lyrics were written by Jun Maeda. Five of the characters have leitmotifs, or background music theme songs—the three heroines, Kanna, and Michiru. Misuzu's theme is ; Kano's theme is ; Minagi's theme is ; Kanna's theme is ; lastly, Michiru's theme is . Of the six music tracks not used in the visual novel, but of which were included on the game's original soundtrack, the first two were failed attempts at creating a theme for Minagi.\n\nThe first album, \"Ornithopter\", came bundled with the original release of \"Air\" in September 2000. The next album was released in August 2001 as a maxi single titled \"Natsukage / Nostalgia\" containing a vocal version of \"Natsukage\", and a B-side track; both songs were sung by Lia and the rest of the single was produced by Jun Maeda. The game's original soundtrack was released in September 2002 containing two discs with 31 different tracks along with remix and instrumental versions of the opening and ending themes. A piano arrange album was released in December 2003 called \"Re-feel\" which contained five tracks from \"Air\" and five from \"Kanon\". An EP containing original versions of the three theme songs and remixed versions of the opening and ending themes was released in May 2006 called \"Air Analog Collector's Edition: Tori no Uta / Farewell song\". Each of the albums released for the visual novel version were released on Key's record label Key Sounds Label. The film's original soundtrack was released in March 2005 by Frontier Works. A bonus symphony CD titled \"Shinwa e no Izanai\" was released with the special edition \"Air\" film DVD on August 5, 2005. Overall, \"Air\" music has been well received, and the original soundtrack for the visual novel has met with high sales. The opening theme was involved in copyright infringement in 2005.\n\nAccording to a national ranking of how well bishōjo games sold nationally in Japan, the original \"Air\" PC release premiered at number one in the rankings. The game ranked twice at 42 in November and December 2000, at 20 in January 2001, and twice more at 42 through February 2001. The original release appeared on the charts twice more: the first in late September to early October 2001 at 26, and again in the last two weeks of May 2002, ranking in at 43. The regular edition of the \"Air\" PC release premiered at number 13, ranked in at number 41 in the following ranking, and 42 in the ranking after that. The PC all ages version premiered at number seven in the rankings and had a final ranking at 30 in the next ranking. The \"Air Standard Edition\" premiered at number one in the rankings. The \"Air Standard Edition\" ranked in twice more, at 34 and at 28 in the next two rankings. \"Air\" was the highest selling game of 2000 selling 102,080 units, which was about 25,000 more units than the second highest game, \"Inagawa de Ikō!\". The Dreamcast version sold 42,445 units in its first week, and was the fourth highest selling console game in Japan that week. The video game magazine \"Famitsu\" scored this version a 30 out of 40, and it ultimately sold 50,406 units to rank as the 53rd highest selling Japanese Dreamcast game ever, as of 2007. NTT Publishing reported that over 300,000 units of \"Air\" have been sold.\n\n\"\"Air\" took the bishōjo gaming world by storm,\" as states a review of the Dreamcast game by MobyGames. \"Air\" was described as a game that stands out, much like Key's first title \"Kanon\", due to an intricate plot that keeps the player interested, and has a good replay value as well. In an interview of Jun Maeda and Yūichi Suzumoto, they were both surprised to find out that the Japanese public (in March 2001) felt \"Air\" to be a soothing game, but Maeda and Suzumoto made it clear that this impression is completely at odds with their impression of the game, and they remark that there was not one person who worked on \"Air\" who thought that. Characters from \"Air\" have appeared in dōjin works not directly based on the \"Air\" series. Games such as \"Eternal Fighter Zero -Blue Sky Edition-\" by Twilight Frontier where most of the playable characters either came from \"Air\" or from the earlier Key games \"Kanon\" or \"\". In the October 2007 issue of \"Dengeki G's Magazine\", poll results for the 50 best bishōjo games were released. Out of 249 titles, \"Air\" ranked eighth with 43 votes.\n\n\n \n"}

Agetec and Metro 3D released the game in North America and Europe respectively.\n\nFive years after the coup attempt led by Leos Klein the Earth government struggles to realize one of its original objectives, relocating people from the underground cities to the Earth's surface. These plans are hopelessly delayed because the government has had to shift its focus from resettlement to military buildup. A necessary move in the government's eyes, needed to keep both the corporations and the situation on Mars in check. After facing various setbacks, the corporations that once held sway on Mars are in positions of diminished influence. This does not sit well with them and each is secretly rebuilding their personal armies in order to contend with the government's growing might. Tensions between the corporations and government are at a breaking point. With all of the government's efforts currently focused elsewhere, resentment toward the institution from the general populace is at an all-time high. Tired of being neglected, people living in the underground cities have taken matters into their own hands and incidents of armed revolt are a daily occurrence.\n\n\n\n\nThe expansion to \"Armored Core 2\" runs on the same game engine as its predecessor but features a number of changes in the way the game is played. There is no trial mission in Another Age that kicks the game off, the player is simply thrown into the world with their AC and their first job offer right there waiting for them. The Arena, which played a significant role in \"Armored Core 2\" has been removed completely, along with the \"Arena Report\" in your save data, but a fair number of the game's missions involve one-on-one combat with other Ravens in a set-up not unlike \"Armored Core 2\"'s Arena. Another Age has sparse expressed plot, it is more a portrait of the life of a mercenary, always bouncing about from place to place and not getting tied down to any one particular cause. Occasionally recurring elements pop up from time to time as the game progresses, but there is no defined storyline to the game. While there is virtually no storyline there are 100 separate missions that make up the mass of the game, the largest \"Armored Core\" title to date, and each mission plays out in a specific area of the world map screen that would reappear in following AC titles down the road. Another Age is also noted for its cameo appearances. Past enemies from previous \"Armored Core\" games Stinger and Nineball appear as bosses in several special missions that are unlocked once you clear all 100 of the game's missions.\n\nAlso of note is that for the first time in the Armored Core series, analog controls are supported. While Armored Core 2 did use the analog stick buttons (L3 and R3) on the DualShock 2, player control was still based on the D-pad and whatever other buttons were mapped to view/motion control. However, this is limited to using the left analog stick for forward/backward movement and turning similarly to the D-pad. would become the first game to fully utilize dual-stick controls for both movement and aiming, offering it as the default scheme.\n\nOn release, \"Famitsu\" magazine scored the game a 35 out of 40.\n"}

Fan Taylor, presenter at the Wisconsin Union Theater, became the founder of APAP. The University of Wisconsin in Madison initially housed the staff. During the 1960s and 1970s, the presenting field and membership expanded to a variety of organizations, prompting the association to change its name to the Association of College, University and Community Arts Administrators (ACUCAA) in 1973. By the mid-1980s, colleges and universities no longer dominated the membership, and the association’s spectrum expanded. The organization’s name was changed to the Association of Performing Arts Presenters in 1988. Fan Taylor led the organization for 24 years. Bill Dawson succeeded Taylor in 1971 and served until 1986, when Susie Farr became the third executive director until her departure in 1999. During her tenure the national office relocated to Washington, D.C. Sandra Gibson served as president and CEO from 2000 until 2011. In October 2011, the board of directors appointed Mario Garcia Durham as president and CEO, the fifth leader of APAP.\n\nMembership in the association was 29 in 1957; by 1966 it had increased to 275. Today APAP has 1,600 organizational and individual members and serves more than 5,000 performing arts professionals every year.

Members include large performing arts centers in major cities, outdoor festivals, rural community-focused organizations, academic institutions, individual artists, and artist managers and booking agents, and representing disciplines including various forms of dance, music, theater, puppetry, circus, magic, attractions and performance art.\n\nThrough professional development programs and resources, APAP helps artists, agents, managers, presenters and producers to gain the knowledge, skills and strategies they need to make the arts a vibrant, valuable and sustainable part of everyday life. APAP enriches communities by supporting this work through grants, resources and advocacy aimed at making the arts accessible for all. APAP programs focus on broadening the impact of the performing arts to all audiences and to all citizens. As a founding member of the Performing Arts Alliance, APAP advocates for national policies that support, strengthen and improve the performing arts industry.\n\nThe association holds an annual members-only conference in New York City every January called APAP|NYC. The 2017 event—the 60th anniversary of the conference—featured more than 1,000 artist showcase performances, and more than 3,680 arts professionals from 50 states and 36 countries attended.

{"id": "10067011", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10067011", "title": "BabaKiueria", "text": "BabaKiueria\n\nBabakiueria (also known under the video-title Babakiueria (Barbeque Area)) is a 1986 Australian satirical film on relations between Aboriginal Australians and Australians of European descent.\n\n\"Babakiueria\" revolves around a role-reversal, whereby it is Aboriginal Australians who have invaded and colonised the fictitious country of Babakiueria, a land that has long been inhabited by white natives, the Babakiuerians.\n\nThe opening scene depicts a group of Aboriginal Australians in military uniforms coming ashore in a land they have not previously been to. In this land, they discover a number of European Australians engaged in stereotypical European Australian activities. The Aboriginal Australian explorers approach the group and the expedition's leader asks them, \"What do you call this place\"? One of the Europeans replies, \"Er... 'Barbecue Area'\".\n\nAfter around 200 years of Aboriginal occupation, white Australians have become a minority. Aboriginal people have assumed power, taken all of the available land and have mostly confined whites to suburban ghettos. They are expected to follow the laws and customs of the colonisers and their lifestyle is seen through the patronizing eyes of the majority culture. The latest manifestation of this is in a 'documentary' presented by Duranga Manika (Michelle Torres).\n\nThe remainder of the film follows Duranga Manika as she observes how white people are disempowered through poverty, are treated unfairly by the police - often with brutality and indifference, experience arbitrary dispossession, government inaction on white issues, white tokenism, white children being taken from their families only to be taught the values of the majority culture and white people being relocated because the government needs their home for \"something\". White people are now often characterized by society and in the media as lazy, unintelligent and untrustworthy and anyone who protests about the current circumstances is labeled as a 'troublemaker'. White rituals and cultural values are derided and dismissed as violent and meaningless. The Babakiuerian government's paternalistic policies are defended by Wagwan, the Minister for White Affairs (Bob Maza) who was based on the then Premier of Queensland, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen.\n\nThe inversion of reality in \"Babakiueria\" highlights the unfairness of Australia's past and present Aboriginal policies and the entrenched racism in society. This subversion of normality allows viewers to see what is wrong when one group tries to control and dominate another and questions the fairness of the current power structure in Australia.\n\nMuch of \"Babakiueria\" was filmed on location, including the Anzac March and the 'Ritual of Violence' (AFL Game). It was screened in the Australian Museum for many years.\n\n\"Babakiueria\" has been used at times to educate police officers.\n\nAfter it was screened at the Message Sticks Festival in 2012, Mahjid Heath noted that \"issues we were struggling with in the early 80's are still relevant and still define the political and national discourses today.\"\n\n\n"}

It is a place where \"hens lay soft boiled eggs\" and there are \"cigarette trees.\" McClintock claimed to have written the song in 1895, based on tales from his youth hoboing through the United States, but some believe that at least aspects of the song have existed for far longer. It is catalogued as Roud Folk Song Index No. 6696.\n\nThe song was first recorded by McClintock, also known by his \"hobo\" name of Haywire Mac. McClintock claimed credit for writing the song, though it was likely partially based on other ballads, including \"An Invitation to Lubberland\" and \"The Appleknocker's Lament\". Other popular itinerant songs of the day such as \"Hobo's Paradise\", \"Hobo Heaven\", \"Sweet Potato Mountains\" and \"Little Streams of Whiskey\" likely served as inspiration, as they mention concepts similar to those in \"Big Rock Candy Mountain\".\n\nBefore recording the song, McClintock cleaned it up considerably from the version he sang as a street busker in the 1890s. Originally the song described a child being recruited into hobo life by tales of the \"big rock candy mountain\". In later years, when McClintock appeared in court as part of a copyright dispute, he cited the original words of the song, the last stanza of which was:\n\nIn the released version this verse did not appear.\n\nThe song was not popularized until 1939, when it peaked at #1 on \"Billboard\" magazine's country music charts. But it achieved more widespread popularity in 1949 when a sanitized version intended for children was re-recorded by Burl Ives. It has been recorded by many artists throughout the world, but a version recorded in 1960 by Dorsey Burnette to date was the biggest success for the song in the post-1954 \"rock era\", having reached No. 102 on Billboard's chart.\n\nSanitized versions have been popular, especially with children's musicians; in these, the \"cigarette trees\" become peppermint trees, and the \"streams of alcohol\" trickling down the rocks become streams of lemonade. The lake of gin is not mentioned, and the lake of whiskey becomes a lake of soda pop. The 2008 extended adaptation for children by Gil McLachlan tells the story as a child's dream, the last stanza being:\n\nFolklorist John Greenway published the song in his \"American Folksongs of Protest\" (1953), redacting only the second to last line. Bowdlerized versions are included in Irwin Silber's \"Songs of the Great American West\" (1967) and Alan Lomax's \"The Penguin Book of American Folk Songs\" (1964).\n\nA folk version of the song is included in the Gordon \"Inferno\" Collection in the Library of Congress, under the title \"The Appleknocker's Lament\".\n\n\n\n\nA cluster of brightly colored hills just north of Marysvale, Utah, near the Fishlake National Forest, is named the \"Big Rock Candy Mountain\". In 1928, after the song had been released, some Utah residents jokingly placed a sign at the base of the hills labeling it the \"Big Rock Candy Mountain\", along with a sign next to a nearby spring proclaiming it \"Lemonade Springs\". The Big Rock Candy Mountain Resort currently sits at the base of the hills and is a major hub on the Paiute ATV trail.\n\nOther rock formations in the United States have also borrowed the name of the song; the largest exposed rock in the South Platte rock climbing area of Colorado is also called \"Big Rock Candy Mountain\" because of its colored stripes resembling a candy cane. Additionally, one of the peaks in the Capitol State Forest in Washington State is named \"Big Rock Candy Mountain\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

The elder of the two was Charles-Théodore or Théodore Cogniard (30 April 1806 - 13 May 1872) and the younger was Jean-Hippolyte or Hippolyte Cogniard (28 November 1807 – 6 February 1882) Both brothers were born and died in Paris.\n\nNicknamed \"les jumeaux siamois du vaudeville\" (the Siamese twins of vaudeville), they headed the théâtre de la Porte-Saint-Martin from 1840 to 1845. In 1845 Hippolyte took sole charge of the Théâtre du Vaudeville, then of the Théâtre des Variétés from 1854 to 1869, where he instituted a repertoire solely consisting of operettas. It was under Hippolyte's leadership that Jacques Offenbach created his best known works : \"La Belle Hélène\", \"Barbe-Bleue\", \"La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein\" and \"La Périchole\". In 1869, on behalf of his son Léon, Hippolyte acquired the Cirque-Impérial and renamed it the Théâtre du Château d'Eau, after its proximity to the place du Château d'Eau (now place de la République).

The game was partially funded through Kickstarter and is a prequel to \"Divine Divinity\". Upon its release in 2014, the game received acclaim from critics, with many praising its ability to modernize the RPG genre. The game ships with the editor that created it, allowing players to create their own single-player and multiplayer adventures and publish them online. An enhanced edition of the game, featuring voice acting and various other updates, was released in October 2015. A sequel to the game, titled \"\", was released in September 2017.\n\n\"Original Sin\" is an RPG in the \"Divinity\" universe. \"Divinity: Original Sin\" concerns two heroes. The game touts turn-based combat, cooperative multiplayer, an interactive world, and includes a modding tool used for creating new content.\n\nThe customizable protagonists of the game are a pair of \"Source Hunters\": members of an organization dedicated to eradicating a dangerous type of magic known as \"Source\" and its adepts, known as \"Sourcerers\". In the single-player mode, the player controls them both, while in the two-player co-op, each player takes control over one of them. At the start of the game, the Source Hunters receive orders to investigate the murder of a town councilor by a suspected Sourcerer in Cyseal, a port town in southern Rivellon. Upon arrival, they find Cyseal under siege by orcs and undead and soon discover that it was orchestrated by a Sourcerer conspiracy linked to the Immaculates, a cult based in the Luculla Forest further inland. They also find evidence implicating the White Witch, guardian of the Luculla Forest, in the murder. Their search for her takes them to the fairy realm of Hibernheim, where they find her trapped in a block of ice by the Immaculates' leader, the Conduit. Upon being freed, she introduces herself as Icara and pleads guilty of accidentally killing the councilor, but the Source Hunters, having uncovered evidence of Sourcery, mass murder, and human sacrifice carried out by the Immaculates, choose to ally themselves with her against the common foe. Icara reveals to them that the Conduit is actually her own estranged sister Leandra and directs them to infiltrate the Immaculates to learn of her plans. The Source Hunters discover that the cult has been mining a highly toxic metal named \"tenebrium\" in the Luculla Mines, where they also encounter \"Death Knights\", indestructible undead warriors created by Leandra using tenebrium and the Source to conquer Rivellon. Leandra destroys the mines in an attempt to kill the Source Hunters, but they manage to escape with her fail-safe that renders Death Knights vulnerable.\n\nThroughout the game, the Source Hunters occasionally encounter magical crystals known as \"Star Stones\" (some of them transformed into \"blood stones\" by the Immaculates' sacrifices). Upon finding the first one, they are transported to the \"Homestead\", a mysterious fortress outside of regular spacetime that is immediately familiar to both of them. As they recover more Star Stones, they learn from them that the Source had originally been a benevolent magic associated with Astarte, the goddess of life, before it was corrupted by the Void, an evil force from outside of the material world. The Source Hunters themselves are revealed to be reincarnations of two ancient generals, a man and a woman, who imprisoned the Source corruption inside an artifact known as \"the God Box\" and were granted godlike powers to guard it. However, when a demonic being named \"the Trife\" persuaded Astarte to open the Box, the corruption was released again and took on the form of a giant dragon, which Astarte went on to battle for eternity in the Void. As penance for their failure, the Guardians chose to be stripped of their powers and memories and were reborn in Rivellon as ordinary humans; the Star Stones are, in fact, crystallized fragments of their lost memories. Deducing that the Trife is now manipulating Leandra to weaken Astarte and to unleash the Void Dragon on the world, Icara urges the Source Hunters to stop her, either by restoring the \"soulforge\" between the sisters (a psychic link that Leandra had severed), or by killing her if necessary.\n\nThe Source Hunters follow the Conduit's trail to the town of Hunter's Edge near the Phantom Forest, now overrun by the Immaculates, orcs, and barbarian mercenaries. They find directions left behind by the wizard Zandalor, Icara's lover and Leandra's nemesis, that point them towards an ancient Source Temple hidden deeper in the woods. Inside the Temple, they find Zandalor and learn from him that Leandra's objective is the God Box in the First Garden, which they can enter from the Homestead. In the Garden, they confront Leandra and can restore her soulforge with Icara if they have unearthed the means therefor in the Phantom Forest earlier: in this case, she recognizes how evil she has become and leaves with Icara and Zandalor to repent; otherwise, they must fight and kill her. Reaching the God Box, the Source Hunters join forces with Astarte to destroy the Trife, but not before it summons the Void Dragon itself. In a titanic battle, they manage to banish the Dragon back into the Box, and Astarte stays to guard it again for all eternity, thanking the Source Hunters and revealing to them that other gods knowingly let the Source be corrupted. The Source Hunters then leave the First Garden to embark on a new adventure.\n\nA crowdfunding campaign was launched on Kickstarter on 27 March 2013. By using the platform, Larian aimed to secure additional funds to expand the content of the game and the reactivity of the game world. The Kickstarter was successfully funded by 26 April, raising over $1,000,000, with the final budget being €4 million.\n\nThe game was expected to be released in late 2013, but was delayed to 28 February 2014. The release date was subsequently delayed again until 30 June 2014. Originally Larian intended to release Windows and OS X versions of the game simultaneously, and stated that once the OS X version was completed a Linux port would not be difficult. However, they decided to delay the OS X and Linux versions to focus on gameplay.\n\nAn enhanced edition version of the game, which includes new content, such as an expanded storyline and new gameplay options, was announced for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles in May 2015. The re-issue was then released on October 27, 2015. The console version of the game was published by Focus Home Interactive. The version was also free to all the players who have already purchased the PC version of the game.\n\n\"Divinity: Original Sin\" received generally favorable reception, according to review aggregator Metacritic, where it was Larian's highest-rated game until \"Original Sin II\" released in 2017. The game received highly positive reviews. \"Eurogamer\" described the game as \"hands down the best classic-style RPG in years\", and recommended the game to RPG fans, with the caveat that they should be up for a challenge. \"GameSpot\" praised the game for its complex systems, beautiful world, exciting turn-based combat, and its story. \"IGN\" wrote that the game was \"one of the most rewarding RPGs to come along in years\" and lauded its depth, personality, and combat challenges. \"PC Gamer\" appreciated the freedom, simulation, depth, and respect for player's choices evident in the traditional RPG. \"Hardcore Gamer\" stated that the lack of \"hand holding\" could discourage genre novices, and that the difficulty should be more consistent, but otherwise appreciated the game.\n\nGameSpot named it the PC Game of the Year, while Rock, Paper, Shotgun declared it \"The Best Kickstarter Of 2014\".\n\nWithin a week of the game's release, the game had sold over 160,000 copies, and became Larian Studios' fastest-selling game. By September 2014, the game had sold over 500,000.\n\nA sequel to the game, titled \"\", was released on September 14, 2017.\n"}

The player is able to choose between several classes of ships, each with drawbacks and advantages in categories like speed and size. The ships are massive and are intended to give the feel of being a commander, not a rogue bounty hunter. As a result, gameplay involves large amounts of strategy and positioning. In addition to positioning the ship and choosing targets, the player may also allocate power to various parts of the ship. These areas include shields, weapons and engines.\n\nIn multiplayer, coordinated attacks and focus fire are important. Other players may choose to heal a damaged teammate. Matches last around ten minutes and players may switch ship classes after death depending on the match type.\n\nAround the release of the steam version, co-developer Six Foot laid off 45 staff, approximately a third of its workforce. Those affected were given the choice to either terminate their contracts or take an unpaid leave as long as the company struggled financially.\n"}

{"id": "1230174", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1230174", "title": "Flow (television)", "text": "Flow (television)\n\nIn television programming, flow is how channels and networks try to hold their audience from program to program, or from one segment of a program to another. Thus, it is the \"flow\" of television material from one element to the next. The term is also significant in television studies, the academic analysis of the medium. Media scholar Raymond Williams is responsible for first using the term in this sense. He emphasized that flow is \"the defining characteristic of broadcasting, simultaneously as a technology and as a cultural form.\" \"It is evident that what is now called 'an evening's viewing' is in some ways planned by providers and then by viewers as a whole; that it is in any event planned in discernible sequences which in this sense override particular program units\". Williams argued that ads glued programs together which created the sense of television flow with a shift \"from the concept of sequence as \"programming\" to the concept of \"flow\".\"\n\nSince the 1990s, the concept of flow has been threatened by new technologies and programming strategies that free the viewer from the old television model. VCRs, DVDs, DVRs (such as TiVo), Video-on-Demand, and online video sources all allow the viewer to construct their own flow. They are no longer limited to a choice of three or four networks, as they were in the 1950s–1960s. Consequently, the concept of flow is under attack and may not survive beyond the broadcast era of television.\n\nWilliams claims that flow is determined by television's \"stage of development,\" but Rick Altman, Professor of Cinemas and Comparative Literature at the University of Iowa, argues that the culture of the medium produces and determines its flow. He notes that the soundtrack is unique to American culture and is one of the techniques that shapes the viewer's flow or his or her experience watching television. He notes that the soundtrack provides the viewer with sufficient plot, cues important events by sound (sound advance, e.g. clapping before it is seen on screen), and creates continuity. These sonic elements create an intermittent flow of television. The goal is not to get the viewers to watch carefully, but to keep them from turning the television off.\n\n\n"}

It was released on the Atari ST but is compatible with Atari TT and Atari Falcon.\n\nThe creators of the game worked in their free time. The development was influenced by the inexperience of developers who had to learn a lot of things during their work on the game. They included a number of features that they retrospectively deemed unnecessary. The game was then tested by friends of the game authors. Piracy was a major issue at the time of the game. The authors therefore gave particular focus to copy protection. They had experience of copying games themselves, and therefore decided to create a particularly effective protection to prevent pirates from cracking the game. Unfortunately, this protection made it impossible to create physical copies or floppy images for use in emulators.\n\nIn 2004, Marek Nepožitek, then a co-founder of Cinemax, decided to re-release \"Hlava Kasandry\", whose play on various platforms had previously been prevented by anti-piracy protection. He had to work around this, and did not find a solution until 2014; a free version for emulators was released in December 2014.\n\nThe game is set for the future, when a handful of people have to survive in a world destroyed by a massive nuclear conflict. The game follows the story of Teodor Hornice, who deals with the destruction of dangerous warheads. He must destroy a rocket name Kassandra that could destroy the planet.\n\nThe game is a mix of adventure, RPG and simulator. It is played with a joystick and a mouse. While players search for the missing rocket, they must pay attention to fuel and life while avoiding rasioactive areas.\n\nAt the time of release, the game was accepted by the reviewers. The game received a rating of 76% from Narsil and 71% from Excalibur.\n"}

These services may be free for the guest or paid, depending on the service and the individual hotel's or hotel chain’s policy. Generally these services are controlled by using the remote control.\n\nHotel television is generally available as free to guest services, which may include local channels and satellite or cable programming, or as interactive television, which provides services such as video on demand or any other paid services including movies, music, adult content, and other services. In some cases hotel TV also means a bundle of interactive services that are made available on a guest's TV screen such as a hotel welcome screen with hotel information, hotel services, an information portal with weather, news & local attractions, video games, internet applications, internet television, movie rental services, and order & shopping for the hotel’s amenities.\n\nCommonly a hotel television system distributing satellite television signal is known as a Satellite Master Antenna TV (SMATV) system. In an L-band distribution system television signal is sent from the satellite dish to a panel in a distribution closet to a set top box in each room which decrypts the digital signal via a coaxial network. In a Headend type system, the signal is encrypted by a Qam at the headend to prevent piracy and then distributed via a COM3000 from Technicolor, or similar hotel television headend.

In most hotels, a television signal provided by a satellite television or cable television provider or OTA antenna is transmitted over a hotel coaxial cable network. Most hotels today are wired only with coaxial cables. Some newer hotels are pre-wired with UTP or CAT-5/6 cabling, which enables IP-based hotel television services.

{"id": "15315906", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15315906", "title": "Museum theatre", "text": "Museum theatre\n\nMuseum theatre is the use of theatre and theatrical techniques by a museum for educational, informative, and entertainment purposes. It can also be used in a zoo, an aquarium, an art gallery, and at historic sites. It is generally performed by professional actors. Varieties of museum theatre include historical characters, puppetry, movement and music.\n\nActors portraying historical characters perform in first person, as if he or she were an actual person from the era or culture he or she is representing. With puppetry, actors can tell stories, create multiple characters, and portray a variety of cultures.\n\nTheatrical techniques can be used for third-person interpretation, where an actor or trained presenter uses costumes, props. lighting, or special effects to convey historical or scientific facts, without necessarily portraying a character.\n\nMuseum theatre pioneers include the Science Museum of Minnesota, the Museum of Science, Boston, the National Gallery of Art, and the Philadelphia Zoo.\n\nThe Theatre in Museums Workshop, begun in 1983 at the Science Museum of Minnesota, is an annual event now held at The Children's Museum of Indianapolis. It provides all the basic information needed to start a theatre program, and an opportunity to develop scripts under the guidance of experienced museum theatre practitioners.\n\nFirst-person interpretation is an increasingly popular way of creating a full-body experience for museum visitors by giving them the opportunity to interact with the past through actors and interpreters.\nHistorical character interpretation is increasingly becoming the way all first-person interpretation is performed because it adds a high degree of authenticity to a given museum performance or interpretation. This movement corresponds with the increase in focus on the educational benefit of the museum to the visitor as opposed to the previously held belief that the visitor is a secondary concern to the objects. While this has been a strong movement since about 1980, the concern for accuracy and consequent focus on portraying real people is a marker that can be interpreted as a new stage.\n\nOne of the main ways that museum theatre differs from museum interpretation is in the degree of disbelief involved in the performance; representing a historical figure requires less suspension of disbelief because the audience knows that the character being represented did exist. It is easier for an audience to believe that the performer is accurately representing a figure that they themselves can verify existed.\n\nThe portrayal of a historical character in a museum environment as opposed to a traditional theatrical space is hard to define. The main distinction is perhaps that the actor in the museum environment must be prepared to interact with the audience, while the stage actor is not expected to know much about his character beyond what is developed on-stage. While acting the characters are subject to similar acting conventions, the museum actor must be prepared to answer to his audience face-to-face. The final distinction to be made is that the portrayal of a historical character is a performance of living history, as opposed to museum theatre. In taking on the identity of a person who truly lived, you are expected to become that person, which involves answering to that person’s actions, ideologies, and life experiences.\n\nSecond-person interpretation is a newer form of interpretation in which visitors participate in programming and hands-on activities, as opposed to only engaging in dialogue with interpreters. It is employed most often in living history museums and can be used in conjunction with first- or third-person interpretation. Common hands-on activities include candle-dipping, butter churning, weaving on a loom, and musket loading. This form of second-person interpretation does not necessarily require the visitor to adopt a character or pretend to be part of the past. In another form, more similar to participatory theatre, visitors are invited to adopt a character and interact with interpreters as that character. One example is the \"Follow the North Star\" program at Conner Prairie Interactive History Park in Indiana, where visitors pretend to be fugitive slaves as a way of learning about the Underground Railroad. Often, such interactions are carefully facilitated so that a desired outcome is achieved, but sometimes visitors are allowed to make their own choices regardless of the historical record. Allowing visitors to portray prominent historical figures and make their own choices is done less frequently because of concerns over historical accuracy. Many educators support role-playing as a way for visitors to learn by doing, think critically about history, and make personal connections between history and their own lives.\n\nDemonstration is a form of museum interpretation that has been used in museums, historic sites, zoos, and aquaria for decades. Demonstration is a way to illustrate activities such as historical craft-making and concepts like scientific principles. It is also a way to contextualize a museum object or artifact. In a demonstration, the demonstrator generally explains the activity or concept using something \"real\" like an object or animal. In traditional demonstrations, the demonstrators generally do not assume to be anyone else (characterization might be involved in more theatrical demonstrations). One example of a demonstration is fish feeding at the New England Aquarium, in which visitors watch a diver feed fish while listening to a volunteer explain the process. Another example is the lightning presentation at the Museum of Science, Boston during which visitors watch lightning flashes produced by a Van de Graaff generator. There is a great deal of overlap between demonstration and theatre. Theatrical techniques such as characterization, costume, narrative, and special effects are often used to enliven demonstration and draw visitor attention. Some museums, such as The National Museum of Science and Industry in London, classify demonstration as a form of museum theatre, while other museums, such as the Science Museum of Minnesota, use actors to present demonstrations. Demonstration may also serve as a component of a museum play or theatre piece. However, differences remain between the conventions of demonstration and the conventions of theatre. In her book \"Exploring Museum Theatre\", Tessa Bridal warns museums against promoting a demonstration as a theatre performance, as it may cause visitor confusion or disappointment. Yet like museum theatre and other forms of live interpretation, demonstration aims to engage visitors, to create interest in a topic, to serve as an alternative to lists of facts and static exhibitions, and to provoke an emotional response that leads to learning.\n\nStorytelling is a discipline that has a history as long as the human race. Storytellers inhabit the characters of the tale, while still maintaining the status as narrator of the events, they are both first person and third person perspectives in one. Storytelling can help bring historical and cultural context to works of art, dinosaur bones, scientific and historical objects. For this reason some museums will hire a contract storyteller to add depth and experience to exhibitions or programs by spinning children's tales, appearing as a costume character to aid in an immersive environment and to aid in depicting different cultures by sharing traditions, histories, folklore and myths.\n\nMuseum theatre often adapts the archetypal storyteller to a character embodied by a trained and scripted actor. It is important to note that part of the art of storytelling is the development of the storyteller's persona and their unique style of performing, which is similar to the creation of a character intrinsic to the acting discipline and the Theatre genre. Some purists believe that creating a theatrical piece embodying the stories and myths of a culture without the native storyteller present, is a perversion and denigration of cultural patrimony. However, professionals in museum theatre believe that the most important part of creating meaningful experiences using others' stories is that the stories and the culture they represent are handled with respect and every effort is made to portray them accurately. \n\nDespite some detractors museums are beginning to integrate many aspects of museum theatre into their daily programming schedule. This is probably due to recently scholarly discourse in the field of museum education that links multi-sensory experiences like storytelling with effective learning in children and adults. Storytelling is a particularly effective type of museum theatre because children's cognitive and empathetic abilities are increased when they are asked to listen and follow the sequence of events presented by storytellers. To quote Catherine Hughes, \n\nDance and music performance within museum theatre take on many different forms. While they can be used separately, dance and music are also used in conjunction with other forms of museum theatre, including each other, to enhance the visitor’s experience. Music as either an instrumental or vocal performance should be performed by qualified performers. The same goes for a dance performance that is either choreographed or improvised. However, in other circumstances, such as after a performance or in a special program, music and dance can be explored by the visitor in a more participatory way. This helps to enhance their understanding and interpretation of the ideas and concepts the museum is trying to encourage. \n\nEven within a performance museums use music and dance in different ways. Music has been used as a cultural performance to show and explore different cultures through the use of music. In other cases music performance has been used to help visitors discover more about the music and instruments themselves, such as the Exploratorium, in San Francisco. They held a series of informal concerts at which, after the musician gave his or her performance, the audience were given the opportunity to converse with the musician and ask question. Dance performance, presented on its own is unusual. It is often used in addition to or as a part of another museum theatre piece. There are however a few sole dance performances in museums. The Weisman holds a performance entitled \"Eddy\" that uses the museum building itself as the stage. To help visitors look at the building differently, the dancers move through the space walking up walls, using the elevator as a dance floor, and other unusual ways. The museum wants the visitor to appreciate not only the exhibits in the museum, but the building itself. \n\nWhen used together dance and music provide another opportunity for museums to educate. A good example of this is \"The Ballad of Chico Mendes\". The Museum of Science, in Boston used choreographed dance and music, both as song and for background, to teach visitors about the battle for the rainforest through the life of Chico Mendes, a rubber tapper. Not only did they perform this in the museum, but latter took it “on the road” to schools in the area. \n\nUsing dance and music in museum theatre allows the museum to evoke greater emotion within a performance, connecting to the visitor on a different level. Music especially helps to set the stage of not only a musical or dance performance, but more traditional theatre and program pieces as well.\n\n"}

NTWH had programs for acting, singing, voice, writing, and theatre production, and thousands of theatre students and performers with disabilities participated in the company's programs in New York City as well as a campus in Belfast, Maine.\n\nFather Rick Curry's interest in performing became a major activity during his years in university. He gained experience in theatre and television commercial work. His university graduate studies were in theatre arts, which led to a PhD in the field from New York University.\n\nCurry, born without a right hand and forearm, had his first experience with open discrimination against his disability allegedly when he tried to audition for a role in a mouthwash commercial, and the receptionist burst out laughing, assuming he had been sent in as a joke. Months later, he founded NTWH in 1977 in Lower Manhattan.\n\nThe company's goals included training students in communication skills that would help them in professional theatre, and to \"enhance their opportunities in the workplace\". Theatre schools commonly overlooked or excluded students who have a disability; so NTWH helped address this problem, offering courses in academic subjects and also practical theatre skills. NTWH aimed to \"create a theatrical arena in which disabled and able-bodied actors and playwrights collaborate, train, and perform together\". Community events were also held to stage dramatic works dealing with \"themes of disability\".\n\nCurry brought a new focus to projects involving disabled veterans. The Writers’ Program for Wounded Warriors provided a forum for veterans to write dramatic monologues about their war experiences.\n\nCurry was a member of the Roman Catholic Jesuit order for more than 50 years, first as a Jesuit Brother, and more recently, as a priest and Chaplain at Georgetown University. Curry maintained that his theatre values reflected his Jesuit training:\n\nNTWH expanded its scope in 1996, launching a campus in Belfast, Maine, as a seasonal adjunct, and purchasing a local school from the city. A variety of projects were run through NTWH's Belfast campus, such as a theatre workshop, a fine arts gallery, a baking school, and a bakery in Belfast, all managed by people with disabilities. The Maine facility was also residential and fully accessible. NTWH's Belfast projects additionally included Summer theatre camps for children, both with and without disabilities.\n\nBeginning in 2004, NTWH began having several financial problems which caused it to go into arrears on mortgage payments both with its New York studio and Belfast campus. This nearly culminated in a foreclosure auction in 2005, though NTWH was able to temporarily satisfy its debts by selling auxiliary buildings in Belfast. Later years, however, were more difficult for NTWH, and in 2010 the City of Belfast temporarily seized the Maine campus for non-payment of a sewer bill. Belfast City Manager Joe Slocum toured the building in January 2011 and found it abandoned and neglected. In January 2017, a local Belfast resident purchased the building with plans to renovate it for multi-functional use. \n\nNTWH's New York ensemble gave a final performance on August 25, 2008, in Sag Harbour, New York, before suspending its operations. NTWH's final production was titled \"In Honour of Service\", a performance of monologues written by participants in the NTWH Writer's Program for Wounded Warriors. Some of the former members of NTWH Cabaret, a project of the larger NTWH, continue performing in New York City as of 2011, and they have reformed in a new performing organization called Encompassing Voices.\n\nRick Curry died on December 19, 2015 in Philadelphia, PA after a long, undisclosed illness.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "859687", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=859687", "title": "Neo-noir", "text": "Neo-noir\n\nNeo-noir is a modern or contemporary motion picture rendition of film noir. The term film noir (popularised by two French critics, namely, and Etienne Chaumeton, in 1955) was applied to crime movies of the 1940s and 1950s, most produced in the United States. It meant dark movie, indicating a sense of something sinister and shadowy, but also expressing a style of cinematography. The film noir genre includes stylish Hollywood crime dramas, often with a twisted dark wit. Neo-noir has a similar style but with updated themes, content, style, visual elements or media.\n\nNeo-noir, as the term suggests, is contemporary noir. The film directors knowingly refer to 'classic noir' in the use of tilted camera angles, interplay of light and shadows, unbalanced framing; blurring of the lines between good and bad and right and wrong, and a motif of revenge, paranoia, and alienation, among other sensibilities.\n\nThe term \"neo-noir\" is a contraction of the phrase \"new film noir\", using the Greek prefix for the word \"new\" rendered as \"neo\" (from the Greek \"neo\"). \"Noir\", when used as an isolated term in film theory and critique, is a short form reference to \"film noir\". As a neologism, neo-noir is defined by Mark Conard as \"defining any film coming after the classic noir period that contains noir themes and noir sensibility\".\n\nThe term \"film noir\" (French for \"black film\" or \"dark film\") was coined by critic Nino Frank in 1946, and popularized by French critics and Etienne Chaumeton in 1955. The term became revived in general use beginning in the 1980s, with a revival of the style. \n\nThe classic era of film noir is usually dated to a period between the early 1940s and the late 1950s; the films were often adaptations of American crime novels of the era, which were also described as \"hardboiled\". Some authors resisted these terms. For example, James M. Cain, author of \"The Postman Always Rings Twice\" (1934) and \"Double Indemnity\" (1943), is considered to be one of the defining authors of hard-boiled fiction. Both these novels were adapted as crime films, the former more than once. But Cain is quoted as saying, \"I belong to no school, hard-boiled or otherwise, and I believe these so-called schools exist mainly in the imagination of critics, and have little correspondence in reality anywhere else.\"\n\nTypically American crime dramas or psychological thrillers, films noir had a number of common themes and plot devices, and many distinctive visual elements. Characters were often conflicted antiheroes, trapped in a difficult situation and making choices out of desperation or nihilistic moral systems. Visual elements included low-key lighting, striking use of light and shadow, and unusual camera placement.\n\nAlthough there have been few new major films in the classic film noir genre since the early 1960s, it has had significant impact on other genres. These films usually incorporate both thematic and visual elements reminiscent of film noir. Both classic and neo-noir films are often produced as independent features.\n\nIt was not until after 1970 that film critics took note of \"neo-noir\" films as a separate genre. Noir and post-noir terminology (such as \"hard-boiled\", \"neo-classic\" and the like) are often denied by both critics and practitioners alike. \n\nRobert Arnett stated that \"Neo-noir has become so amorphous as a genre/movement, any film featuring a detective or crime qualifies.\" Screenwriter and director Larry Gross, identifies \"Alphaville\", alongside John Boorman’s \"Point Blank\" (1967) and Robert Altman’s \"The Long Goodbye\" (1973), based on Raymond Chandler's 1953 novel, as neo-noir films. Gross believes that they deviate from the classic noir films in having more of a sociological than a psychological focus.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1175916", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1175916", "title": "Pacific Comics", "text": "Pacific Comics\n\nPacific Comics (PC) was an independent comic book publisher that flourished from 1981-1984. It was also a chain of comics shops and a distributor. It began out of a San Diego, California, comic book shop owned by brothers Bill and Steve Schanes. Along with competitors like First Comics and Eclipse Comics, PC took early advantage of the growing direct market, attracting a number of writers and artists from DC and Marvel to produce creator-owned titles, which were not subject to the Comics Code, and thus were free to feature more mature content.\n\nIn 1971, the Schanes brothers (Steve Schanes, age 17, and Bill Schanes, age 13) co-founded Pacific Comics, which started out as a mail-order company, selling to consumers via ads in the \"Comics Buyer's Guide\". This led to advertisements inside some Marvel comics, and ultimately to tangible retail stores. The first Pacific Comics store opened in Pacific Beach, California, in 1974, and business was soon doing so well that the brothers realized they \"couldn't get merchandise\" for the stores, and so set up a distribution system, which was soon supplying neighboring stores also.\n\nThe move from newsstand distribution to the direct market (non-returnable, heavily-discounted, direct purchasing of comics from publishers) happened in the 1970s, in large part due to the work of Phil Seuling and his Sea Gate Distributors company (founded in 1972), as well as a number of individuals, including the Schanes brothers and Bud Plant. The direct-market went hand-in-hand with the creation of specialist comics shops to cater to the collectors who could then buy back issues months after a newsstand issue had disappeared. By the late 1970s, thanks partly to the success of films such as \"Star Wars\" and \"Superman: The Movie\", comics were selling well, and Pacific expanded its distribution system nationwide, raising $200,000 by closing its four San Diego retail locations and selling off inventory, rising rapidly to the top of the new distribution system.\n\nIn the six years between 1974 and 1980, comic or fantasy-related specialty shops rose from numbering 200-300 to around 1500, while Pacific was operating out of a office-warehouse in Kearny Mesa, with 500 wholesale accounts. According to elder brother Steve, the company \"grossed just under a million dollars that year,\" soon doubling its floorspace.\n\nIn 1979, Pacific dipped its feet into publishing when they released \"Warriors of Shadow Realm\", a John Buscema portfolio of six signed, colored plates meant to accompany a Doug Moench and Buscema three-issue Weirdworld epic-fantasy tale which ran in \"Marvel Comics Super Special\" #11-13 (June-Oct. 1979).\n\nIn 1981, rival distributor Capital City launched a black-and-white title, \"Nexus\", and distributed it through their own system. The Schanes brothers took note, and decided to follow suit, even though they were still paying off debt from a $300,000 bank loan taken out in 1979 at 25 percent interest. Steve — who, with a degree in sculpture had a background in art — handled negotiations with creators, while Bill took on the business and accounting end. The brothers turned to Jack Kirby. Steve Schanes recalled, \"I figured if you want to get people's attention with a new comic book, who better to do it with than the King of Comics, Jack Kirby! We were already friends with Jack. We used to send him free copies of comics he'd drawn for other publishers because they never sent him any! So I just went ahead and called him on the phone, and he turned out to be a nice guy, completely accessible. . . . We negotiated a whole detailed publishing deal between the two of us. No middlemen.\"\n\nThe Schaneses asked Kirby, who had effectively quit comics in 1977, for only the publishing rights, assuring him that he could keep full ownership and copyrights, and said they would even help him license characters for use overseas or in other media. Thus, Pacific claims to have become the first company to pay royalty payments to Kirby. Kirby provided Pacific with \"Captain Victory and the Galactic Rangers\", which was published bimonthly from August 1981. Though the Schaneses anticipated sales of less than 25,000, the first issue sold 110,000 copies. Kirby then let Pacific publish his \"Silver Star\", and the brothers decided to start a line of full-color mainstream comic books.\n\nBefore long, Pacific had attracted interest from other comics professionals, including Mike Grell (who recalls that he was actually the first to sign with Pacific by a couple of weeks, but that Kirby's work was published first because he \"delivered his first.\") who had planned his \"Starslayer\" to appear from DC, but after it dropped from the schedule, the Schaneses approached him about publishing it.\n\nAnother invitee was then-aspiring artist Dave Stevens, who purchased comics from Pacific's shops and had met the brothers at the San Diego Comic-Con in 1981. When \"Starslayer\" #2 came up short a few pages, Stevens was approached to fill in the remaining pages, and ultimately came up with \"The Rocketeer\".\n\nIn 1983 Pacific upgraded to paper with higher quality ink. Pacific's innovations in creator-owned properties and high-quality printings were soon imitated by industry leaders DC Comics and Marvel Comics.\n\nPacific continued to distribute and publish comics, running both operations from a San Diego warehouse to which they'd moved in July 1982. They also purchased a firehouse in Steeleville, Illinois and converted it into a distribution hub. It was also operating warehouses in L.A. and Phoenix at the time. Printing about 500,000 comic books every month, the Schanses employed around forty people at their San Diego operation alone, and were grossing over $3.5 million per annum.\n\nThe brothers hired their father, Steven E. Schanes, as financial vice president and their mother (Christine Marra) as office manager. Elder brother Paul \"Pablo\" worked in the financial records department, and sister Chris, an L.A.-based attorney, provided counsel on legal affairs.\n\nPacific's published output contained editorials by David Scroggy, who had started as a comics retailer in 1975, and risen to general manager of Pacific's four San Diego shops by the late 1970s. He helped to bring the reclusive Steve Ditko to Pacific.\n\nDitko's Pacific offering \"Missing Man\" was previewed in \"Captain Victory\" #6, and then featured in issues of \"Pacific Presents\". His work was scripted by Mark Evanier. Meanwhile, Pacific published a magazine-sized black-and-white reprint of Rog 2000 stories that John Byrne had done in the '70s for Charlton Comics, as well as a number of titles under its parent company Blue Dolphin Enterprises. It also welcomed Bruce Jones to the company, and Sergio Aragonés and Mark Evanier's \"Groo the Wanderer\".\n\nBy 1984, Steve Schanes decided to bring back 3-D to comics, a fleeting trend in the 1950s that had then been stymied by poor printing separations. Ray Zone was hired to do the production, after he had successfully converted a Kirby image for Honeycomb cereal. Steve Schanes decided the 3-D book would be \"Alien Worlds 3-D\", featuring the first published work of Art Adams, alongside John Bolton, Bill Wray and others. Sales on the expensively-produced comic, however, were poor, and sales all round were following suit. One-shots became more common, and tolerable sales on \"Elric of Melniboné\" stumbled when First Comics acquired the rights, putting Pacific in the awkward position of continuing as distributor on a comic from a rival publisher that they had helped promote.\n\nAfter organizational difficulties pushed back the release of \"Starslayer\" by several months, Mike Grell decided to take his creator-owned property to First Comics, and a domino effect began to occur as the loss of a high-profile title to a rival publisher engendered bad industry PR, leading other creators to lose faith in Pacific.\n\nMore importantly, the distribution arm of Pacific was suffering serious problems, due in part to overly-generous credit extensions to retailers, which were not paid back as quickly as expected. Thus, Steve Schanes explained:\nPacific's publication arm was also attracting competitors, and Pacific found itself distributing competitors' (including Kitchen Sink Press, Last Gasp and Rip Off Press) titles. With this in mind, other publishers (including Capital City (whose \"Nexus\" comic outsold several Pacific titles), , Aardvark-Vanaheim, Educomics, Quality, Eagle, Eclipse, First, Vortex, New Media, Fantagraphics, Mirage) feared that having Pacific, a rival publisher, as their distributor could result in their being cut off from comic shops. This likely played a factor in the multiple alternate distributors who came into being to compete with Pacific, until nearly a quarter of Pacific's comic-shop accounts defected to alternate distributors in 1984, skipping out on paying Pacific for upwards of three months' worth of comic books.\n\nAt the same time, Pacific and parent company Blue Dolphin Enterprises found themselves the target of lawsuits, including some dealing with foreign rights and royalties for Pacific-published creator-owned titles. In August 1984, with the company $740,000 in debt, the Schaneses informed their staff that they would all be out of work by September. According to Steve Schanes, Pacific's publishing arm was still seeing profit at the time of the closure, but it was outweighed by the losses of the distribution arm, and he and his brother lacked the business expertise to sell off part of the business.\n\nAfter the 1984 collapse of Pacific, many of its creator-owned publications moved to Eclipse Comics: Bruce Jones' \"Twisted Tales\", \"Alien Worlds\", and \"Somerset Holmes\"; Dave Stevens' \"Rocketeer Special\" and a one-shot of Mark Evanier/Sergio Aragones' \"Groo the Wanderer\".\n\nAs Pacific went into liquidation in September 1984, Phil Seuling's distribution company Sea Gate Distributors also closed down. Pacific's distribution centers and warehouses were purchased by Bud Plant, Inc., and Capital City Distribution, who also opened an expanded facility in Seagate's old space in Sparta, alongside the comic-book printing plant.\n\nSteve Schanes and his wife, Ann Fera, subsequently founded Blackthorne Publishing, and Bill Schanes found employment with Diamond Comic Distributors.\n\nWriter Jay Allen Sanford stated that Pacific \"formed the template for Image Comics.\"\n\n\n"}

Raja, and senior journalists, politicians, and corporate houses, taped by the Indian Income Tax Department in 2008–09. The tapes were leaked out to the press, and were finally published by some media outlets and shown by television channels.\n\nThe revelations in the tapes led to accusations of misconduct by many of these people. Nira Radia used to run a public relations firm named \"Vaishnavi Communications\", whose clients include the Tata Teleservices and Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries.\n\nAfter getting authorisation from the Home Ministry, the Indian Income Tax department tapped Radia's phone lines for 300 days in 2008–2009 as part of their investigations into possible money laundering, restricted financial practices, and tax evasion.\n\nIn November 2010, \"OPEN magazine\" carried a story which reported transcripts of \"some\" of the telephone conversations of Nira Radia with senior journalists, politicians, and corporate houses, many of whom have denied the allegations. The Central Bureau of Investigation has announced that they have 5,851 recordings of phone conversations by Radia, some of which outline Radia's attempts to broker deals in relation to the 2G spectrum sale. The tapes appear to demonstrate how Radia attempted to use some media persons to influence the decision to appoint A. Raja as telecom minister.\n\nIn the recorded conversations between Nira Radia and prominent figures, referred to as the Radia Tapes, several prominent figures are heard in conversation with Radia:\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the transcripts of the tapes, Radia lobbied against the reappointment of Dayanidhi Maran to the post of Union IT and Communications minister.\n\nDutt: 'The stalemate (between Congress and DMK) continues, ya\nRadia: 'my honest advice is that you tell them (Congress) that they need to tell him (Karunanidhi) directly ..\nDutt: 'OK, let me talk to them'.\n\nIn a later conversation at 1047 IST, Barkha says that it (conveying the message to Congress) was 'not a problem' and that she would talk to Ghulam (Nabi Azad).\n\n\nThe news gained prominence following sustained pressure on social networking sites Twitter and Facebook against an attempted blackout orchestrated by many prominent Indian TV channels and newspapers. According to the \"Washington Post\", \"Twitter has played an important role in launching what has become an international conversation on the issue, with the Indian diaspora weighing in\".\n\nInitially, only a handful of the mainstream newspapers in India, like The \"Deccan Herald\", Indian Express had openly written about the tapes. Some newspapers like \"HT Media\", \"Mint\" (the business newspaper also owned by HT media) and NDTV said \"the authenticity of these transcripts cannot be ascertained\". CNN-IBN's Sagarika Ghose discussed with a panel of experts, if the corporate lobbying is undermining democracy, on the \"Face the Nation\" programme on the channel. The Radia tapes is seen to have also made a dent in the image of the media in the country. \"The complete blackout of the Nira Radia tapes by the entire broadcast media and most of the major English newspapers paints a truer picture of corruption in the country,\" wrote G Sampath, the deputy editor of the \"Daily News and Analysis\" (DNA) newspaper. After it became an international news, more and more media houses covered the story. The Deccan Chronicle commented, \"The 'Radia tapes' may have torn the veil off the nexus between information hungry journalists, lobbyists and industrialists, and opened everyone’s eyes to what has long been suspected — the ability of a small but powerful group to use their connections to influence policy.\" The largest circulated English newspaper in India and the world, \"The Times of India\" finally opened up on 25 November 2010, commenting \"The people are showing who the boss is. The weapon in their hands is the internet, ... has seen frantic activism against \"power brokering\" by journalists in collusion with corporate groups and top government politicians...\"\n\nBarkha Dutt, Vir Sanghvi, and others have refuted the allegations. M.K.Venu had filed a criminal defamation case against Outlook magazine for mentioning him on its cover. Outlook gave an unconditional apology in the court for mistakenly naming M.K.Venu and acknowledged his consistent writings against Telecom Minister A.Raja. News of the apology was published in Outlook, Indian Express and The Hindu. \"Open Magazine\" maintained that the conversations were carried as they appeared in the recordings. Dutt defended her reputation through her Twitter account. \"Struck by the bizarre irony of being accused of favouring a man i have never met (raja) and have always attacked in print and on TV. Gnite!,\" she said via one of her tweets on Twitter.\n\nNew Delhi Television Limited posted a strong rebuttal on its website terming the insinuation that Barkha lobbied for A Raja as \"unsubstantiated, baseless and defamatory\" and threatened action against \"Open Magazine\".\n\n\"Hindustan Times\" cited Sanghvi's clarifications on his website, and stated that the authenticity of these transcripts cannot be ascertained. Vinod Mehta wrote opposition leader Arun Jaitley said Barkha Dutt pleaded to him not to mention about the conversation in the parliament while attacking the government on the 2G case.\n\nOn 26 November 2010, Barkha Dutt released a detailed statement, addressing questions raised by the tapes, which she claims were edited. On 27 November 2010, Vir Sanghvi released a detailed statement, clarifying his role.\n\nWriting about the controversy in the Hindustan Times, Rajdeep Sardesai said that \"The robust Indian tradition of adversarial journalism has been mortgaged at the altar of cozy networks.\" Tavleen Singh said it was \"very, very disappointing\", and added that \"corruption when it involves ethics\" was worse than \"taking money\". Sumnima Udas of the CNN wrote that the tapes revealed that Dutt served as a power brokers for a deal considered to be one of India's biggest ever scams.\n\nNira Radia has served a legal notice on \"The Pioneer\", on the report titled \"Tapped and Trapped\" published by the newspaper. The notice asserted that \"The Pioneer\"s report regarding corruption and manipulation in the allotment of 2G spectrum to telecom operators, in so far as it referred to Radia's connections with Telecom Minister A Raja, are \"absolutely false, baseless and malicious and constitute gross defamation\".\n\nThe original tapes are now annexures in a Supreme Court petition seeking Raja’s prosecution. The opposition parties in India have demanded a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) probe into the 2G spectrum case, which could also to be extended to include a probe into the Radia tapes to ascertain the media's role in the controversy. The Government is also accused of selectively releasing merely 10 hours of the 2000 hours recorded of the Radia tapes.\n\nThe CBI in its affidavit in the Supreme Court in the 2G spectrum allocation case, on 22 November 2010, had stated that Radia will be approached for investigation at an appropriate time. and that the probe would be completed latest by March 2011. On 24 November 2010, Nira Radia was questioned by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) officials and recorded her statements in relation to the 2G case probe.\n\nOn 1 August 2013 Supreme court asked whether the Income Tax department had informed the authorities which had directed the tapping of Radia’s telephone about the sensitive and serious nature of the conversations.\n\nSubsequently, it was revealed that while true to their word, the Neera Radia tapes themselves had been leaked to the Indian media by a lobbyist belonging to a powerful business family, connected to other politicians and private companies. In 2016, in an interview with Hindustan times, Josy Joseph, a highly respected Indian investigative journalist who had also received the tapes revealed that the Neera Radia tapes had been leaked to the Indian media, not by the government, but by a shource ensconced in a rival lobbying organization, to settle their own internal rivalries. He said that the tapes also contained statements by Ratan Tata stating that the tata group did not pay people under the table, but these segments were not run by media houses.

Relative pitch implies some or all of the following abilities:\n\nThis last definition, which applies not only to singers but also to players of instruments who rely on their own skill to determine the precise pitch of the notes played (wind instruments, fretless string instruments like violin or viola, etc.), is an essential skill for musicians in order to play successfully with others. As an example, think of the different concert pitches used by orchestras playing music from different styles (a baroque orchestra using period instruments might decide to use a higher-tuned pitch).\n\nUnlike absolute pitch (sometimes called \"perfect pitch\"), relative pitch is quite common among musicians, especially musicians who are used to \"playing by ear\", and a precise relative pitch is a constant characteristic among good musicians. Unlike perfect pitch, relative pitch can be developed through ear training. Computer-aided ear training is becoming a popular tool for musicians and music students, and various software is available for improving relative pitch.\n\nSome music teachers teach their students relative pitch by having them associate each possible interval with the first two notes of a popular song. (See ear training.) Another method of developing relative pitch is playing melodies by ear on a musical instrument, especially one which, unlike a piano or other fingered instrument, requires a specific manual adjustment for each particular tone. Indian musicians learn relative pitch by singing intervals over a drone, which is also described by W. A. Mathieu using Western just intonation terminology. Many Western ear training classes use solfège to teach students relative pitch, while others use numerical sight-singing.\n\nCompound intervals (intervals greater than an octave) can be more difficult to detect than simple intervals (intervals less than an octave).\n\nInterval recognition is used to identify chords, and can be applied to accurately tune an instrument with respect to a given reference tone, even if the tone is not in concert pitch.\n\n"}

Berry creates art for galleries, illustration, and paintings for theatrical performances.\nBerry's work has appeared in many science fiction, fantasy and comic books, including Neil Gaiman's Sandman, cards, and Stephen King novels. In 1985, Berry created the first digitally painted book cover worldwide for William Gibson's \"Neuromancer\".\n\nBerry was born in San Bernardino, California in 1953. His father, an air force fighter pilot, was frequently stationed in China. Berry's childhood home was populated with Asian art which fascinated Berry and later found its way into his works.\n\nFrequently moving in his youth, he left behind friends, homes and communities, but he never let go of art. Self-taught, drawing was the constant in his life. He learned from comics, book covers,and anything available from the streets. At 17 while living in Colorado, Berry left school and home, hitchhiking across the country. His art career started around that time in underground comics, as a founding member of Everyman Studios in Colorado.. His first commissioned painting for the book industry was a cover for Jules Verne's \"Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea\", published by Simon and Schuster, 1978.\n\nAn innovator in new media during the early 1980s, Berry is credited with the first digitally painted book cover, in his cover for the cyberpunk novel \"Neuromancer\", by William Gibson. Published in 1985, this cover was commissioned when it became clear that \"Neuromancer\" would sweep the awards after its initial publication in 1984 and remained the novel's cover for almost two decades. Berry created the painting with assistance from hackers at MIT's Machine Architectural Group.\n\nLike William Gibson, Berry purchased his first computer from the proceeds of Neuromancer. He immediately began experimenting with it as a groundbreaking new creative tool, not to mimic techniques of traditional media.\n\nBerry again worked with William Gibson and director Robert Longo for SonyPictures’ \"Johnny Mnemonic\". The team of Rick Berry, Darrel Anderson and Gene Bodio employed state-of-the-art tech advances to design and produce the CGI cyberspace climax - the award-winning sequence featured in SIGGRAPH's animation revue, 1996.\nBerry was also Keanu Reeves’ cyberspace stunt double in Johnny Mnemonic.\n\nIn 2010, Rick Berry and frequent collaborator, Phil Hale, were the subject of the museum exhibition \"Parallel Evolutions\" at Lucca Center for Contemporary Art, Italy. \" ...two artists who are emblematic of the fluid, shifting nature of contemporary art.\" —Cosimo Lorenzo Pancini & Emanuele Vietina, Co-Curators. The exhibition coincided with the annual Lucca Comics and Games Festival attracting 140,000 attendees. Berry and Hale were honored guests at this festival twice, 1998 and again in 2010.\n\n\"Parallel Evolutions\" concluded with a special art event—Berry and Hale collaborating before a packed audience at the museum. These paintings sold during the festival in the charity auction for the local children's hospital. A decade earlier, Berry had designed the festival’s now ongoing live collaborative performance site featuring international artists working together for the first time.\n\nBerry was first introduced to Hale when Phil approached Berry as a teenager interested in acquiring art instruction and they continue a lifelong association. In the early 90s artist Jeffrey Catherine Jones said of Berry and Hale -\n\"\"It is remarkable ... that somehow out of the \"discontinuities of the unexpected universe\" two of the most creative artists and best draftsmen I've ever seen should met at the right time.\"\" -- Jeff Jones commenting on Double Memory the book of art by Berry and Hale.\n\nBerry was commissioned to create several solo exhibitions at Tufts University for their [Institute of Global Leadership]. Examples of topics Berry explored include human trafficking, conflict resolution over limited resources, the politics of fear, and the advancing globalization of China. During 2005-06 Berry was Practitioner in Residence for Tufts INSPIRE program.\nOf works created for these international symposia, Rick states “These paintings serve as meditation upon events almost too overwhelming to contemplate. Seeing with art, it becomes possible to move toward the problems considered, rather than run from them” \n\nBerry was invited to participate in the first visual art residency offered by Opera Boston, a company known for innovative repertoire choices. The two-season collaboration seemed a natural partnership as soon as it began with Shostakovich's surreal opera \"The Nose (opera)\". \"Rick Berry...was embedded in the rehearsals\" (BostonMetro Feb 27, 2009) where he sketched performers in the dark. Back in the studio, Berry would put aside these small sketches and without photography or models, he relied upon his unique process of discovery in the paint and his memory, to evolve large scale works for gallery exhibitions. Berry brought this technique to live theater in his 2010 collaboration with Amanda Palmer and the American Repertory Theater.\n\nIn 2010, Amanda Palmer invited Berry to engage in her upcoming production of \"Cabaret\" at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Once again, he employed his process of rapid ink drawing while embedded in rehearsals, later producing large expressive oil paintings as a part of the café theater set. Influenced by the intensity of the story, performers, and Butoh movement in this production, Berry created works that were \"like images of ghosts projected on smoke and ash. Just at the moment you think you've resolved them, they shimmer and erode before your eyes.\" Berry was awarded the Silver Medal from the Society of Illustrators for his painting \"To Absent Friends\" in this series.\n\nBerry's next collaboration with Amanda Palmer was as one of several artists selected to paint images influenced by her new songs. Two Berry paintings are included in her 2012–13 world tour gallery and art book.\n\n\nBerry won the silver medal in 2010 from the Society of Illustrators for his paintings from the set of Amanda Palmer's \"Cabaret\". He was also selected by Arthur Dion of Gallery NAGA Boston in 2009 for Juror's Choice Award at Cambridge Art Association, Point of View exhibit.\n\nBerry has been twice nominated for the World Fantasy Award, in 1994 and 1998. He was nominated for the Chesley Awards five times, and won twice, in 2000 for \"Artemis\" and in 2005 (sharing the award with two other artists) for the cover art for Judith Tarr's novel \"Queen of the Amazons\". He won a gold medal from \"Spectrum: The Best in Contemporary Fantastic Art\" in 1997 for his work \"Wintermute\", and has won a silver medal from \"Spectrum\" three times. He won the Gold Plate from Lucca Comics & Games Festival in 1998 and an International Horror Guild Award in 2005.\n\n\"... There are echoes of Francis Bacon's horrific portraits in the distorted figure studies shown, and echoes of Max Ernst and Rene Magritte in the dark fantasies...\nYet ultimately Berry and Hale's dark, frightening vision is singularly their own... compelling.\" -Publishers Weekly 1993 \n\n"}

She was active at the \"Troupe de Regente\" of Luigi Riccoboni at the Comédie-Italienne in Paris 1716–1758.\nShe was the star of the Italian theatre in Paris and regarded as a superior interpreter of the plays by Pierre de Marivaux. She mainly played the part of heroine in Commedia dell'arte, \"Silvia\". Casanova belonged to her admirers.\n\nSilvia Balletti was born to the Italian actors Giuseppe Tortoriti (Pascariello), Antonio Benozzi and Clara Mascara, who belonged to a Venetian theatre company active in Toulouse since the banishment of the Comédie Italienne from Paris in 1697. In 1716, she belonged to the first actors engaged when the Comedie Italienne was reestablished in Paris. Her career up to that point is not known, but it is presumed that she must have had experience, since she would not otherwise have been hired to take part in the opening performance before the regent of 18 May 1716. She made a success, and became the theater's star in heroine parts.\n\nIn 1720, she began a long co-operation with Pierre de Marivaux, who wrote numerous plays for her in which she celebrated triumphs on stage. Among her celebrated parts were the main parts i \"Le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard\" (1730), \"L'amante difficile\" (1731), \"Le Je ne sais quoi\" (1731), \"L'École des mères\" (1732), \"Arlequin apprenti philosophe\" (1733). Until his death in 1739, she mainly acted opposite Tommaso Visentini, thereafter opposite Antonio Costantini. Though she eventually replaced the parts as heroine for mother-roles, she remained one of the most celebrated actors of Paris until her retirement, and was in 1754 still referred to as a renowned perfect actor. \nSilvia Balletti retired in February 1758, shortly before her death.\n\nIn 1720, she married her cousin Giuseppe Balletti, who was her co-actor in hero-parts. In 1750, she met Casanova, who was the friend of her son Antonio Stefano Balletti and courted her daughter Manon.\n\n"}

It is the general name used for pop and rock bands that were formally recognized by the Soviet government from the 1960s to the 1980s. \n\nIn Soviet times, the term \"VIA\" generally meant \"band\", but it is now used in Russia to refer specifically to pop, rock, and folk groups active during the Soviet period.\n\nThe term VIA appeared in the Soviet Union in the 1960s and represented a model under which the Soviet government was willing to permit domestic rock and pop music acts to develop. To break through to the state-owned Soviet media, a band needed to become an officially recognized VIA. Each VIA had an artistic director (художественный руководитель) who served as manager, producer, and state-appointed censor. In some bands (such as Pesniary) the artistic director was the band's leading member and songwriter, while in others he played the role of impresario.\n\nSoviet VIAs played a specific style of pop music. They performed youth-oriented (but officially approved) radio-friendly music, which combined contemporary Western and Soviet trends. Folk instruments were often used, and occasionally a keytar (a keyboard held like a guitar). Songs varied from pop ballads, dance-beat disco and new wave to mainstream rock (although bands avoided the \"rock music\" label until the late 1970s, because rock was considered \"bourgeois\" and formally banned). Many VIAs had up to ten members (including a number of vocalists and multi-instrumentalists), who were in frequent rotation. \n\nDue to state censorship, the lyrics of VIAs were family-friendly; typical topics were universal emotions like love, joy, and nostalgia, or idealized vignettes from daily life. Many bands also encouraged national culture and patriotism, (especially those of national minorities from the smaller Soviet republics) such as Yalla from Uzbekistan, Labyrinth from Georgia and Chervona Ruta from Ukraine. Folk-based VIAs such as Pesniary (later they mixed folk rock and progressive rock styles), Siabry and Verasy were especially popular in Belarus. Russian bands from Moscow and Leningrad (such as Zemlyane and Tsvety) were more oriented towards Western pop and rock music.\n\nMany VIAs were created by musicians that played together in local choruses or musical theatrical productions. The earliest VIAs included Avangard (Avantgarde) in 1964, Poyushchiye Gitary (The Singing Guitars) in 1966, Vesyolye Rebyata (Jolly Fellows) in 1968, and Dobry Molodtsy (Good Guys) in 1969.\n\nThe typical VIA consisted of 6 to 10 band members, with several singers and musicians capable of playing multiple instruments. Lead vocalists in VIAs usually did not play an instrument, but only sang. Virtually every member of a VIA was a professional musician with formal musical education and many years of performance experience.\n\nThe Soviet government had strict rules governing how members of a VIA were to behave on stage and conduct themselves in public. Movement around the stage was discouraged. Musicians typically remained in one place as they played their instruments or sang. Anything outside of the conservative \"norm\", such as tattoos, leather jackets, or metallic accessories were forbidden.\n\nVIA song recordings were done by the State owned record company Melodiya (Melody). Concerts and performances were organized by professional associations such as Soyuzkontsert (Union Concerts), Moskontsert (Moscow Concerts), Lenkonsert (Leningrad Concerts), Roskontsert (Russian Concerts), and Goskontsert (Government Concerts), along with regional orchestra groups.\n\nAt times, a VIA would collaborate with a well-known solo singer to provide musical backing. Examples include Yury Antonov and VIAs Araks and Aerobus, Alla Pugacheva and VIA Retsital, Sofia Rotaru and VIA Chervona Ruta, Valeriy Obodzinskiy and VIA Verniye Druziya, and Lev Leschenko and VIA Spektr.\n\nVIAs typically performed songs written by professional composers and lyricists who were members in good standing of the Composers' Union and the Writers' Union in the former Soviet Union. Some songs were created by VIA members or the VIA's artistic director. In the early 1980s, there was an unspoken rule that at least 80% of a VIA's performance repertoire had to be songs written by union members.\n\nVIAs performed songs in a range of musical styles, including folk music, disco, rock, and synth-pop. Although tightly controlled by the government, VIAs had an enormous influence on the Russian public and created an audience for the rock music wave that followed. On the other hand, VIAs tended to deliver songs that were mainstream, simple in expression, and conservative in performance. Lyrics tended to focus on uncontroversial topics such as patriotic motifs, love stories, idealizations of work, light humor, ballads, current events, and folk themes. Any social criticism or protest was heavily censored and largely forbidden, except when directed against the West.\n\nA number of VIAs did cover versions of foreign hits, typically changing the lyrics to entirely different meanings, but matching the music and vocalization. At times, VIAs went so far as to claim that the music was their own original work.\n\nVIAs as a movement in Soviet music existed for approximately two decades, from the mid-1960s until the mid-1980s. They were very popular, particularly among Soviet youth. The best known VIAs would perform year round, giving several concerts a day. Many of these concerts received television and radio air time. Their albums sold tens of millions of copies. \n\nMost VIAs dissolved in the late 1980s. This was in part due to rock music becoming more popular and the censorship apparatus largely falling apart. The advent of synthesizers, samplers, and other technologies that enabled the creation of music without the use of a large number of musicians was also a contributing factor. Finally, the lyrical content of VIA songs became far less relevant in the new, more open society.\n\nAlthough most VIAs disappeared, a number of VIA members enjoyed successful subsequent careers as solo performers or members of new bands. Many Russian pop and rock stars of the 1990s were VIA members in the 1970s and 1980s. A few of the most popular VIAs endured and continued to exist into the 1990s and thereafter, usually with a significantly different membership.\n\nGroups exemplifying VIA music included: \n\n\n\n"}

The park's name was reverted to Wild Waves Water Park and Enchanted Village Amusement Park in April 2016, and once again changed to Wild Waves Theme and Water Park in November 2016, as a result of the park's acquisition by EPR Properties.\n\nThe Enchanted Village theme park was first opened in 1977 by Byron Betts. The initial park site held only a half-dozen rides. In 1984, Wild Waves Waterpark was built adjacent to Enchanted Village; the combined amusement complex became known as Enchanted Parks. In 1991, co-owners Michael Moodenbaugh and Jeff Stock paid $8 million for Enchanted Parks. In 1993, Moodenbaugh traded his share of Enchanted Parks, Inc. for shares in their jointly owned amusement park in Amherstburg, Ontario, Canada called Boblo Island Amusement Park, Inc. In 1993, Jeff Stock purchased several rides from Boblo Island. Stock then sold his shares of Enchanted Parks, Inc. in late 2000 to Six Flags for $19.3 million. In 2000 the park had grown to over , with more than 20 rides, and was the Northwest's largest waterpark. In 2002 and 2003, major expansion took place, with the addition of several new attractions, many manufactured by Zamperla and S&S Power. Also in 2002, approximately 1000 seasonal workers were employed for positions as rides operators and food service workers. Many of these seasonal workers are also students of local high schools. The park's name was reverted to Enchanted Village and Wild Waves Water Park for the 2016 season to once again split the park into two separate parks instead of one.\n\nIn April 2007, Six Flags sold the park to Orlando-based real estate investment trust CNL Income Properties, which leased the park to PARC Management.\n\nIn January 2010, PARC Management had defaulted on its lease with CNL for Wild Waves and a majority of its other parks. Wild Waves was then placed under the new management of Norpoint Entertainment (owned by previous Wild Waves owner Jeff Stock). Stock implemented many changes to the park in 2011 including a new water ride for that season.\n\nWith the CNL Income Properties acquisition, the park was named Wild Waves Theme & Water Park. Other parks owned by CNL included Darien Lake Theme Park Resort, Elitch Gardens, Frontier City, SplashTown Waterpark, White Water Bay, and Waterworld California, all of which were bought in a $312 million purchase from Six Flags.\n\nIn November 2016, Wild Waves and the other CNL properties were sold to EPR Properties, based in Kansas City, Missouri. The total price of all the properties was $456 million, although there was no specific price disclosed for Wild Waves. The parks were placed under the management of Premier Parks, LLC.\n\nOn August 20, 2016, a 33-year-old man died in the Activity Pool due to drowning. A police report noted multiple missed chances to attempt a rescue. According to the report, children reported a body at the bottom of the pool to a lifeguard, who \"believed that they were pranking him and did not think anything of it.\" In a statement released by police, Wild Waves said they actively reviewed the accident, their safety protocols, and the actions taken by staff.\n\nDuring the 1991 Holiday With Lights event, Christmas trees were sold in the North Parking lot.\n\nWild Waves Theme & Water Park holds an annual Fright Fest halloween celebration which is a staple in the Federal Way and Washington community.\n\nIn 2013, Wild Waves Theme & Water Park held its second ever Holiday With Lights, an event featuring more than one million Christmas lights.

The most famous of those puzzles is the Rubik's Cube. The WCA was founded by Ron van Bruchem of the Netherlands and Tyson Mao of the United States. The goal of the World Cube Association is to have \"more competitions in more countries with more people and more fun, under fair conditions.\" In 2017, they started work to become a non-profit organization and on November 20, 2017 the state of California accepted the initial registration of the World Cube Association.\n\nThe organization is run by the board members. It assigns different teams and committees as well as delegates who can organize official competitions. The presence of a delegate is required in order to make the competition official. , more than 100,000 people from around the world have participated in WCA competitions.\n\nThe WCA Board of Directors (or simply WCA Board) is the leadership team of the WCA and its highest authority. WCA Directors are Officers of the WCA and in addition have the role of Full Delegate. The WCA Board is responsible for the WCA organization as a whole. As part of their day-to-day work, they discuss issues that affect the WCA and advise the committees. The WCA Board oversees that the applications to hold WCA Competitions meet fair conditions to give all the world similar chances to compete, and finally approves and announces the competitions accordingly. After competitions, they read reports from the WCA delegates about competitions in order to be up to date on the WCA activity worldwide and take part in the discussion of any incidents that occur.\n\nThe Board is also responsible for helping WCA fulfill its mission: “more competitions in more countries with more people and more fun, under fair and equal conditions.” This means spreading cubing to new communities and countries and working together with the Senior Delegates to open up cubing to even more people.\n\nThe WCA Communications Team (WCT) is in charge of overseeing and supporting communications of the WCA with the community and general public. This includes answering general requests that are submitted via the WCA website and maintaining the social media accounts of the WCA. The team responds to multiple emails a day from all around the world regarding starting cubing competitions in new areas, what to do for your first competition, big media requests about competitive speedcubing, and many other issues. Many requests are also forwarded to the appropriate WCA team or delegate if they are in regard to a particular competition or specialization.\n\nThe WCA Disciplinary Committee (WDC) investigates a variety of situations and proposes solutions including punishments when necessary. Among other topics, these situations could be serious violations of WCA regulations or community issues. They deal with many instances of cheating, general conduct, or disputes in the way that delegates and organizers run events. They are also responsible for issues that may occur in the WCA internally.\n\nThey can be contacted by WCA officials or community members to be made aware of possible violations at WCA competitions. Initial contact with the team is usually through emails or directly from any competitor or delegate. If the Team Leader agrees that this case falls under the WDC’s jurisdiction, a WDC case is initiated. The team attempts to correspond with everyone involved, to get all sides of the story and to provide an independent report for the investigation. Once the case is closed and the decision made, they inform all relevant persons of any actions and make a public announcement, if necessary.\n\nThe WCA Financial Committee (WFC) is responsible for everything regarding finances within the WCA. As an Advisory Committee, they manage the finances and accounts of the WCA in accordance with an approved annual budget proposal, which is also their work to provide on a regular basis. Similarly, the Financial Committee pays invoices and taxes that are directed to the WCA, after consultation and with permission of the WCA Board. On a quarterly basis they report and advise the WCA Board on all finances of the WCA, to give them a summary of the scope of financial possibilities and options that the WCA has.\n\nThe WCA Regulations Committee (WRC) was founded to support the WCA Board in maintaining the WCA Regulations in 2011. Over the years, their area of responsibility has been broadened, so that they handle all issues which are related to the application, the improvement and the development of the WCA Regulations today. They support delegates on any kind of procedural matters happening at competitions and decide on unresolved and uncovered incidents. The WRC regularly publishes WCA internal reports to help all delegates and improve their knowledge of the Regulations.\nThis includes regulation changes based on feedback from the WCA staff and the community, while also taking into account their own insights and reports of incidents that occur during WCA competitions. New versions of the Regulations are published on a periodic basis. Another part of their work is to encourage members of the WCA community to create and maintain translations of the Regulations.\n\nThe WCA Results Team (WRT) is responsible for managing all data in the databases of the WCA, most importantly competition results and person data.\n\nThe most time-consuming regular task of the WCA Results Team is posting results of WCA competitions to the WCA website, once the delegate of the competition has sent them in. They rigorously check if the results were submitted correctly and if so, transfer them into the WCA results database. This work of the Results Team assures the data quality of the databases of the WCA. Each such posting procedure is ended by creating a public post on the WCA website - these are the posts that you can see on the front page of the WCA website!\nApart from posting competition results, the WCA Results Team is also responsible for making corrections to competition results if necessary and they are in charge of administering all WCA profile pages. This includes for example changing user data, like dates of birth, according to verified requests and managing profile picture requests.\n\nThe WCA website is a huge open source project on Github. They bring continuous improvements to the website very frequently, to allow all of community members to easily access and enjoy WCA content. Recently internationalization was implemented, so now people can use the WCA website in their native language. Other important milestones are the development of the registration system, and especially payments. The team keeps an eye on the website all the time to ensure it's permanently available and they react as fast as possible whenever something is wrong.\n\nThe Software Team develops new software for various tasks within the WCA whenever needed. Thus, they created an app simplifying translating the website, to engage more people translating into their language. Also, few years back, the WCA Workbook assistant was designed, which is used by all delegates to submit the competition results to the WCA Results Team. The Software Team also updates the official WCA Scrambler, TNoodle, according to data provided by the WCA Regulations Committee if changes are needed. Additionally, they maintain and develop administrative tools for various Delegates, Committees and Board members on the WCA website.\n\nWCA Delegates are members of the WCA who are responsible for making sure that all WCA competitions are run according to the mission, regulations, and spirit of the WCA. This means that at every competition a WCA Delegate needs to be present to be considered official. The WCA has three different types of delegates: WCA Senior Delegates, WCA Delegates and WCA Candidate Delegates. Beyond the duties of a WCA Delegate a WCA Senior Delegate is responsible for managing the delegates in their area and should also be contacted by the community for regional matters. They are available to mentor the delegates in their area - especially when new communities are being developed. New delegates are listed as WCA Candidate Delegates at first and need to show their ability of managing competitions successfully before being listed as WCA Delegates. If possible they may delegate their first competitions alongside more experienced delegates to get the hang of all responsibilities connected to delegate a WCA competition.\n\nAll acknowledged WCA Delegates, Candidate Delegates and Senior Delegates can be found on their official Website.\n\nIn 1999, the first modern age speedcubers found each other on the Internet via Rubik's Games, a computer game with an electronic version of the Rubik's Cube. Chris Hardwick from Raleigh, NC founded the Yahoo! Group \"Speedsolvingrubikscube\" and the Unofficial World Records, a place where cubers could post their personal best times. Ron van Bruchem started speedcubing.com together with his friend Ton Dennenbroek, an avid puzzle collector.\n\nBecause the cubers were living all over the world, they wanted to organize a competition at which they could all meet. In 2003, under the guidance of Dan Gosbee, they organized the Rubik's Cube World Championship in Toronto. This first modern-age Rubik's Cube competition was a huge success, but there were lots of issues, largely due to the lack of any regulations. After the World Championship, van Bruchem and Tyson Mao started organizing competitions in the Netherlands and Germany, as well as at Caltech in the United States. In 2004, they started the World Cube Association, which today has held competitions in more than 90 countries.\n\nCurrently, the WCA offers competitions in 18 events. Not all of them are offered at every competition, but they are usually all offered at national and global championships. The events are:\n\nAdditionally, some events have had their official WCA event status removed. They are:\n\n"}
