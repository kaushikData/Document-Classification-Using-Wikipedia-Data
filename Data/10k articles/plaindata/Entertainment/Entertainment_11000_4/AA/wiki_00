She was formerly Miss Piedmont. She was widely covered by American media for her part in exposing sexual abuse allegations against Harvey Weinstein.\n\nIn 2010, when 18 and known as Ambra Battilana, she attended a bunga bunga party associated with Silvio Berlusconi after she was spotted in a beauty contest and told she would be guaranteed a well-paid job as a weather girl for attending. She demanded to leave immediately once she realized that there were underage girls being used as prostitutes. She reported her experience to Italian magistrates.\n\nGutierrez was widely covered by the news after she alleged that Harvey Weinstein sexually assaulted her in 2015 while they were reviewing her portfolio. She said she barely spoke English at the time. She filed a police report that night, and the next day wore a wire while speaking with Weinstein. In the recording, he repeatedly asks her to come into his room while Gutierrez says things like, \"I want to leave,\" \"I don’t want to,\" and \"I want to go downstairs.\" When she asked why he tried to assault her the day before, he said, \"Oh, please, I’m sorry, just come on in,\" continuing, \"I’m used to that. Come on. Please.\" When Gutierrez asks if he's used to groping people against their will, he responded with, \"Yes.\" When asked why he grabbed her breast against her will, he said, \"I won’t do it again.\" The recording has since been made public.\n\nDespite the audio confession, the District Attorney Cyrus Vance, Jr. decided not to press charges due to lack of evidence. In the following months, Gutierrez received widespread negative press in tabloids including several stories from \"anonymous sources\" in the New York Post following the incident after the recording was published. She stopped receiving modeling jobs. Gutierrez eventually signed a strict NDA with Weinstein, though she's stated she didn't really understand what she was signing at the time, and was trying to protect herself and her family from Weinstein since no one believed her. Archstone Pictures has purchased the rights to depict Guiterrez's life story.\n"}

It is closely linked to the ars dictandi, covering the composition of documents other than letters. The standing assumption was that these writings would be composed in Latin, and according to well worked-out models. This made the arts of composition a subfield of rhetoric.\n\nIn business letters, it called for some form of address (e.g., “Worshipful master”); salutation (“I greet you well”); notification (“May it please you to know”); exposition (“the wool was shipped”); disposition (“and I want my money”); and valediction (“May God keep you well, at least until my bill is paid”). Clerks and scribes wrote the letters based on those rules.\n\nImportant figures in the development of Latin letter writing and document composition include Albericus Cassinensis, his critic Adalbert of Samaria (\"Praecepta Dictaminum\", c. 1120), and Lawrence of Aquilegia.\n\n\n\n"}

In addition to regular programming that includes the Place Matters Awards and the People's Hall of Fame, the organization works with a wide range of partners to develop exhibitions, publications, and documentary films, and to advocate for the rights of street performers, ethnic clubs, and other grassroots cultural expressions in New York City. City Lore works in four cultural domains: urban folklore and history, preservation, arts in education, and grassroots poetry traditions. Described by Sonnet Takahisa of the September 11th Memorial Museum as \"wise renegades,\" their programs include People's Poetry Project, Place Matters (in collaboration with the Municipal Arts Society) and City of Memory. \n\nCity Lore works collaboratively with folk and community artists, embracing different aesthetics for the creation of art. Their collaborators include the Gotham Center for New York City History, the New-York Historical Society, Bank Street College of Education, and smaller groups such as Los Pleneros de la 21. City Lore’s staff consists of professional folklorists (Steve Zeitlin, the founder and executive director, Elena Martínez and Amanda Dargan), historians (Marci Reaven), photographers (Martha Cooper), ethnomusicologists (Roberta Singer and Lois Wilcken), and arts and education specialists (Anika Selhorst).\n\nThe City Lore office on First Avenue on the Lower East Side houses archives containing over 100,000 images, hundreds of oral histories, and traditional music and poetry performance tapes. The archives are part of the ongoing documentation project featured on City of Memory, a participatory online story map of New York City. \n\nCity Lore's People's Hall of Fame, established in 1993, honors grassroots contributions to New York's cultural life and presents winners with a plate-sized bronze version of the New York City subway token. Recipients have included the Pearls of Wisdom Storytellers, Peter Benfaremo (\"The Lemon Ice King of Corona\"), Jim Power (\"New York's Mosaic Man\"), and Renee Flowers (original member of the Gowanus Wildcats Girls Drill Team). \n\nCity Lore created \"Know Your Rights!\", a guide for street performers. \n\nSince its inception, City Lore has served as an advocate for local landmarks through the Place Matters program in collaboration with Municipal Arts Society. There have been over 650 nominations from the public, including parks, historic sites, public art, beer gardens, industrial sites, and stores. In 2001, they successfully nominated Bohemian Hall, still a vibrant community center/beer garden started by Czech immigrants in Astoria, Queens, and the Casa Amadeo Music Store, the oldest, continuously occupied Latin music store in New York City, as census sites to the National Register of Historic Places. The organization has funding from the Dutch government for an outdoor exhibit in Lower Manhattan commemorating the Quadricentennial of Henry Hudson's voyage with signage marking key sites in New Amsterdam.\n\nIn 2006, City Lore published \"Hidden New York: A Guide to Places that Matter\".\n\nCity Lore develops and implements arts residencies and offers professional development to New York City public schools. In response to requests of public school teachers with increasing Bengali and Bangladeshi populations, the organization designed artist residencies in Queens, funded by the United States Department of Education to teach traditional Bengali scroll painting. City Lore has designed similar programs bringing Mexican, Ecuadorian, Egyptian, Ivorian, Cuban, Haitian, Peruvian, South African, and Brazilian artists into the schools. \n\nIn the aftermath of September 11, 2001 attacks, City Lore found and collected anonymous poems and other writings that had been left at memorials, hospitals and gathering places throughout the city. A selection of these anonymous poems was published in the book, \"Words In Your Face: A Guided Tour Through Twenty Years of the New York City Poetry Slam\". and appeared in Steve Zeitlin's essay, \"Oh Did You See the Ashes Come Thickly Falling Down. \n\nFounded by City Lore and Poets House in 1999, The People's Poetry Gathering was created to present the diverse oral poetry traditions of New York City. In 2003, City Lore's People's Poetry Project launched an initiative to document and disseminate poetry from endangered languages. \n\nCity Lore produces documentary films and collaborates with filmmakers whose work relates to the organization's mission. Sponsored films include Ric Burns' \"Coney Island\" and the five-part series \"\"; \"City of Dreams\", a film about women artists in New York City; \"From Mambo to Hip Hop\", a documentary which traces the history of music in the South Bronx; and the forthcoming \"DeAf Jam\", which highlights the poetry and storytelling of the deaf performed in American Sign Language. \n\nCity Lore developed the traveling exhibit Weavings of War, which featured the work of women textile artists from Central Asia, Southeast Asia, Latin America, and South Africa. \n\nFunds were raised by City Lore to support Peter Siegel's project to restore and issue tapes he made in the 1960s of folk music concerts by Mississippi John Hurt, The Carter Family, Jesse Fuller, Bill Monroe, and others. The recordings became the box set \"Friends of Old Time Music\" released by Smithsonian Folkways in 2006 \n\n"}
{"id": "911884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=911884", "title": "Comedy of manners", "text": "Comedy of manners\n\nThe comedy of manners is a form of comedy that satirizes the manners and affectations of contemporary society and questions societal standards. Social class stereotypes are often represented through stock characters such as the \"miles gloriosus\" (\"boastful soldier\") in ancient Greek comedy or the fop and rake of English Restoration comedy, which is sometimes used as a synonym for \"comedy of manners\". A comedy of manners often sacrifices the plot, which usually centers on some scandal, to witty dialogue and sharp social commentary. Oscar Wilde's play, \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" (1895), which satirized the Victorian morality of the time, is one of the best-known plays of this genre.\n\nThe comedy of manners was first developed in the New Comedy period of ancient Greek comedy and is known today primarily from fragments of writings by the Greek playwright Menander. Menander's style, elaborate plots, and stock characters were imitated by the ancient Roman playwrights, such as Plautus and Terence, whose comedies were in turn widely known and reproduced during the Renaissance. Some of the best-known comedies of manners are those by the 17th-century French playwright Molière, who satirized the hypocrisy and pretension of the \"ancien régime\" in plays such as \"L'École des femmes\" ([\"The School for Wives\"], 1662), \"Tartuffe\" ([\"The Imposter\"], 1664), and \"Le Misanthrope\" ([\"The Misanthrope\"], 1666).\n\nThe comedy of manners has been employed by Roman satirists since as early as the first century BC. Horace's Satire 1.9 is a prominent example, in which the persona is unable to express his wish for his companion to leave, but instead subtly implies so through wit.\n\nWilliam Shakespeare's \"Much Ado about Nothing\" might be considered the first comedy of manners In England, but the genre really flourished during the Restoration period. Restoration comedy, which was influenced by Ben Jonson's comedy of humours, made fun of affected wit and acquired follies of the time. The masterpieces of the genre were the plays of William Wycherley (\"The Country Wife\", 1675) and William Congreve (\"The Way of the World\", 1700). In the late 18th century Oliver Goldsmith (\"She Stoops to Conquer\", 1773) and Richard Brinsley Sheridan (\"The Rivals\", 1775; \"The School for Scandal\", 1777) revived the form.\n\nThe tradition of elaborate, artificial plotting and epigrammatic dialogue was carried on by the Irish playwright Oscar Wilde in \"Lady Windermere's Fan\" (1892) and \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" (1895). In the 20th century, the comedy of manners reappeared in the plays of the British dramatists Noël Coward (\"Hay Fever\", 1925) and Somerset Maugham and the novels of P. G. Wodehouse, as well as various British sitcoms. The \"Carry On films\" are a direct descendant of the comedy of manners \nstyle.\n\nThe term \"comedy of menace\", which British drama critic Irving Wardle based on the subtitle of \"\" (1958), by David Campton, is a jocular play-on-words derived from the \"comedy of manners\" (\"menace\" being \"manners\" pronounced with a somewhat Judeo-English accent). Pinter's play \"The Homecoming\" has been described as a mid-twentieth-century \"comedy of manners\".\n\nIn \"Boston Marriage\" (1999), David Mamet chronicles a sexual relationship between two women, one of whom has her eye on yet another young woman (who never appears, but who is the target of a seduction scheme). Periodically, the two women make their serving woman the butt of haughty jokes, serving to point up the satire on class. Though displaying the verbal dexterity one associates with both the playwright and the genre, the patina of wit occasionally erupts into shocking crudity.\n\nOther contemporary examples include Kazuo Ishiguro's \"The Remains of the Day\", E. M. Forster's \"A Room with a View\", Barbara Pym's \"Excellent Women\", Douglas Carter Beane's \"As Bees in Honey Drown\", \"The Country Club\", \"The Little Dog Laughed\", \"You Rang, M'Lord?\" by David Croft and Jimmy Perry, and the Jeeves and Wooster series by P. G. Wodehouse. The television program \"Absolutely Fabulous\" is another contemporary example of the comedy of manners.\n\n"}

The podcast, which originated in 2005, is produced by the Gallifreyan Embassy, a \"Doctor Who\" fan group originally based in Long Island, New York.\n\n\"Doctor Who: Podshock\" is also significant for being the first podcast to be officially attached to the world's largest \"Doctor Who\" online community, Outpost Gallifrey. Further, it was the first \"Doctor Who\" podcast to feature both British and American hosts, along with regular contributors from other parts of the English-speaking world.\n\n\"Podshock\" has its origins on Long Island, New York. The first meeting of the fan club which would eventually spawn \"Podshock\" was held in a Holiday Inn in Rockville Centre on or about 18 June 1985. It was one of many local clubs being formed around the US during the early 1980s heyday of the PBS broadcast of so-called \"classic\" \"Doctor Who\". Principally, the group existed to mobilize support for PBS pledge drives, but it also formed a support network for those wishing to attend conventions, watch the programme in a social environment, and to generally help promote the programme in their area. One of the membership benefits was a printed newsletter, which, over time, was supplanted by a website. When the new series of \"Doctor Who\" began in 2005, the Gallifreyan Embassy decided on a new means by which to deliver their content. On August 9, 2005, the first episode of the club's then-new podcast was released. The name they chose for this new audio publication— \"Podshock\"—was a reference both to podcasting and to the 1982 \"Doctor Who\" serial, \"Earthshock\".\n\nJune 2015 marks the 10th Anniversary of Podshock. The occasion will be acknowledged by - at least - two special episodes.\n\nOn January 21, 2007 the podcast became affiliated with the \"Doctor Who\" fan website, Outpost Gallifrey. It was after this alliance that the name of the podcast was changed to include a reference to Outpost Gallifrey. It was the only podcast officially associated with the popular \"Doctor Who\" website. However, on December 1, 2007, the Outpost was reduced to a gateway to other sites, and an archive of the site's final incarnation; \"Podshock\" continued to be released until the summer of 2009 under a logo bearing the words, \"Outpost Gallifrey Presents,\" until removing that nomenclature after the site officially shut down.\n\nThe show main hosts: Louis Trapani, Dave Cooper, Ian Bissett, Lee Shackleford, and Kyle Jones\n\nPrevious hosts include:\n\nCorrespondents and contributors from around the world who occasionally contribute to the show:\n\nVarious others have become regular call-in listeners on the \"Podshock: LIVE!\" format, discussed below.\n\nAll episodes of \"Podshock\", regardless of their content, have something things in common. All episodes of \"Podshock\", regardless of type, begin with a stylized intro. Generally, but not always, a clip from the classic or current series is played. Then, spoken either by one of the hosts, or via a pre-recorded insert, the same phrase begins every episode: \"Live! From ___________! It's \"Doctor Who: Podshock\"!\", in a fashion similar to the opening skits in \"Saturday Night Live\". The blank is filled in by a different place relative to the \"Doctor Who\" universe. It has become a popular pastime amongst listeners to offer hints on how to fill in the blank.\n\nThe bulk of the episodes of \"Podshock\" involve at least two of the three main hosts connected via Skype. These episodes tend to have a great deal of post-production work added to them, resulting in a product that approximates studio recording.\n\nA typical episode will run for 80–110 minutes, and contains discussion on all things related to \"Doctor Who\", including the television series (both old and new), audio plays by Big Finish, , merchandise, and the various spin-off series. The show typically starts off with a news section which presents \"Doctor Who\"-related news from the previous week. The features segment usually follows the news. This generally consists of discussion and reviews of various \"Doctor Who\"-related topics. Often, the featured material is pre-recorded in the form of an interview or a review. Feedback from listeners is also included towards the end of the episode, facilitated in part by a call-in line maintained by the Gallifreyan Embassy.\n\nThe occasional interviews on the main show have included the actors Colin Baker, Deborah Watling, Jules Burt and Eugene Washington, music composers Murray Gold and Mark Ayres and writers John Peel, Steven Moffat, Tom MacRae and Paul Cornell. Interviews from archive sources, mostly with people who were involved in the original series of Doctor Who, also feature from time to time. These have included Jon Pertwee, Sylvester McCoy, Sophie Aldred, John Nathan-Turner and Peter Davison.\n\nOn occasion, a much shorter version of the podcast will be published. This type of show debuted on 5 February 2006 and received the name \"Aftershock\", in deference to the fact that it usually gave a bit more information about a topic that had been covered in the previous week's podcast. Generally they are hosted by only one of the three hosts and aim to give greater context to a story previously reported, impart some late-breaking news, or explain why a forthcoming episode is being delayed.\n\nRoundtable discussions were occasionally attempted on the show prior to 2007. However, with the coming of the third series of \"Doctor Who\" in March 2007, \"Podshock\" adopted a new technology, TalkShoe, to facilitate much larger numbers of participants at one time. Starting with Episode 73, an uninterrupted run of 16 weekly episodes began wherein anyone could call in and be placed on the air. However, the recording technology of TalkShoe proved problematic. Initially, host and editor Louis Trapani attempted to clean up each episode through post-production. By episode 80, though, that practice was abandoned entirely, with Trapani noting on air that the post-production wasn't helping to improve the audio. The decision to stop post-production on the TalkShoe episodes was also motivated by the fact that they were almost immediately available to listeners in their raw form on the TalkShoe website itself. Thus, these episodes developed the secondary name, \"Podshock LIVE!\", used primarily on the TalkShoe website.\n\nThis type of \"Podshock\" has become dominant since they were introduced. From 14 April 2007, until 26 May 2008, the ratio of \"Podshock: Live!\" to \"Podshock\" was about 4:1. In May 2008, the decision was taken to more formally separate the live roundtables from the studio recordings. Hence, for the fourth series of \"Doctor Who\", roundtable discussions of individual episodes were no longer part of the main subscription feed, and are considered a separate podcast by the hosts.\n\nSince September 2005 the show has been produced in two audio formats: an enhanced version, encoded in AAC, and an MP3 version. Both have the same audio content, but the enhanced version also includes embedded chapter markers, images and hyperlinks. Initial episodes of the TalkShoe roundtables also were availabable in both enhanced and non-enhanced versions, but this practice was abandoned when post-production on that type of episode stopped.\n\n\"Podshock\" is, according to iTunes, the most popular \"Doctor Who\" podcast.\n\nA review in a 2007 issue of \"SciFi Now\" gave the show four out of five stars, describing it as \"seriously meaty\" analysis of Doctor Who and \"the perfect accompaniment to the television series\", while at the same time noting that the presenters were \"massive Dr. Who aficionados\" whose personalities were obscured behind a \"voiceover [that] is slow, dull and very hard work.\"\n\nThe show is sometimes taken to task for its length. For instance, commentators at the Tachyon TV podcast website noted that the 24 June 2007 episode of Tachyon TV was \"as funny as one would expect and at half an hour, a good 12 hours shorter than your average Podshock.\"\n\nAt least one \"Doctor Who\" writer, Paul Cornell, was at one time a devoted listener of \"Podshock\". Writing on his own blog in February 2007, he noted that, even though a colleague of his had appeared on the , he was \"still a \"Podshock\" boy at heart,\" although later that year he actually appeared on .\n\n"}

An example is the name of English actor Sean Bean, whose name based on its visual aspect looks like it should be pronounced \"Seen Been\", but when spoken, there is no rhyming quality.\n\nMany older English poems, particularly those written in Middle English, contain rhymes that were originally true or full rhymes, but as read by modern readers, they are now eye rhymes because of shifts in pronunciation, especially the Great Vowel Shift. These are called historic rhymes. Historic rhymes are used by linguists to reconstruct pronunciations of old languages, and are used particularly extensively in the reconstruction of Old Chinese, whose writing system does not allude directly to pronunciation.\n\nOne example of a historic rhyme (i.e. one which was a true rhyme which is now an eye rhyme), is the following:\n\nWhen \"Hamlet\" was written around 1600, \"flies\" and \"enemies\" rhymed in local dialects, but as a result of the shifts in pronunciation since then, the original rhyme has been lost.\n\n"}
{"id": "32263044", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32263044", "title": "Fly (Breaking Bad)", "text": "Fly (Breaking Bad)\n\n\"Fly\" is the tenth episode of the third season of American television drama series \"Breaking Bad\", and the 30th overall episode of the series. Written by Sam Catlin and Moira Walley-Beckett and directed by Rian Johnson, it aired on AMC in the United States and Canada on May 23, 2010.\n\n\"Fly\" has been described as \"arguably the most polarizing episode in \"Breaking Bad\" history\", differing from most others in its slow pacing and relative lack of action. A few critics have considered it to be one of the greatest episodes of the series.\n\nWalt, suffering from insomnia, stares up at his smoke detector's flashing light while trying to get back to sleep. Later, he arrives with Jesse at the superlab, where they begin making another batch of meth. At the end of the day, Walt calculates that their yield, while above what they are required to produce, falls short of what he expects. Jesse suggests it may be from other losses from spillage, but Walt insists there is another reason. \n\nAfter Jesse leaves for the day, Walt sees a housefly in the lab which he fears could contaminate the meth-making process. He tries numerous means to swat it, even dangling precariously from the lab's catwalk, from which he slips and falls to the floor. When Jesse returns the next day, he finds Walt still in pain from the fall and demanding that they cannot start cooking until they get rid of the fly. Jesse worries about Walt's lack of sleep and suggests they go outside to figure it out. However, when Jesse leaves, Walt locks him out of the lab and goes back to find the fly. When Jesse disconnects the main power to the lab, Walt lets him back in so they can work together. Jesse gets some flypaper which they hang around the lab, as well as some sleeping pills that he secretly puts into Walt's coffee. He then recounts a story about his late aunt, who experienced auditory hallucinations as a result of her cancer spreading to her brain. Walt asserts that he is still in remission. \n\nAs they wait to catch the fly, the two talk about their families. Walt expresses that he should have died already and tries to think of the perfect moment to have done so: after he had enough money, after Holly was born, before his surgery and before Skyler knew what he'd been doing. He finally decides the perfect moment to die would have been the night Jane died, telling Jesse of his conversation with her father Donald. He tries to calculate the chances of meeting both father and daughter in different scenarios on the same night despite having never met either beforehand, but finds the odds too astronomical to calculate. Jesse is distracted when he sees the fly near the ceiling. As he tries to use a step-ladder to reach the fly, an increasingly-sleepy Walt seems poised to confess to Jesse about his role in Jane's death. Jesse tells him Jane's death was nobody's fault, but he still misses her. Jesse climbs back down and, seeing the fly land on the ladder, swats and kills it. \n\nJesse takes a sleeping Walt to a couch while he cleans up the superlab and prepares for their next batch. They later leave together, but Walt warns Jesse that if he has been skimming from their product, he will not be able to protect him if Gus finds out. Jesse denies taking anything and states that he isn't asking anyone to protect him. That night, Walt is again unable to fall asleep, and sees a fly landing on the smoke detector's flashing light.\n\n\"Fly\" was produced as a result of the series' considerable budgetary restrictions and being unable to afford the $25,000–$35,000 needed to move the production trucks to a new location. Series creator Vince Gilligan remarked: \"We were hopelessly over budget ... And we needed to come up with what is called a bottle episode, set in one location.\" The episode was written by Sam Catlin and Moira Walley-Beckett, and directed by Rian Johnson; it aired on AMC in the United States and Canada on May 23, 2010.\n\nAlong with extras in the laundromat, Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are the only two actors who appear in the episode. Series regulars Dean Norris (Hank), Betsy Brandt (Marie), and RJ Mitte (Walt, Jr.) are credited, but do not appear. Anna Gunn (Skyler)'s voice is heard in the episode, but it is reused audio from the second season episode \"Phoenix\".\n\nGilligan noted that the limited setting and cast allowed for a slower pace and deeper exploration of character traits and motives:\n\nThe episode's original broadcast was viewed by 1.20 million people, which was a decrease from the 1.62 million of the previous episode, \"Kafkaesque\". It has the second-lowest number of viewers on its original broadcast of any season three episode, just ahead of \"Half Measures\" (1.19 million).\n\nWhile not a favorite among audiences, \"Fly\" has been widely acclaimed by critics, particularly for its cinematography and its method of developing the relationship between Walter and Jesse. Donna Bowman of \"The A.V. Club\" gave \"Fly\" an A grade, praising Rian Johnson's direction and remarking that the episode \"would have been stellar even with more conventional direction, but with the unhinged images and bold juxtapositions Johnson provides, it's one of the most distinctive hours of television we're likely to see this year.\" In \"TIME\", James Poniewozik called it \"the most unusual and very possibly best episode of Breaking Bad so far\", comparing it favorably to \"The Sopranos\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> \"Pine Barrens\". In \"Entertainment Weekly\", Ken Tucker said he would be \"shocked if both Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul don’t use the episode for Emmy consideration\", and lauded it for \"[opening] up to become an opportunity for Walt and Jesse to explain more fully the sadnesses and regrets they have over everything\". Alan Sepinwall, writing for \"HitFix\", speculated that \"Fly\" may be \"the best bottle show ever\" and remarked in the subtitle of his review that the budget-saving approach ended up leading to \"an instant classic\". Emma Dibdin of \"Digital Spy\", Kathryn Kernohan of Junkee, and Kaitlin Thomas of TV.com have all ranked it among the show's best episodes. In 2013, Matt Zoller Seitz, writing for \"Vulture\", named \"Fly\" the greatest episode of the entire series, calling it a \"perfect \"Breaking Bad\" episode and a perfect hour of television.\" The same year, it was ranked fifth in \"Entertainment Weekly\"'s ranking of all 62 episodes from best-to-worst, with Darren Franich writing, \"Some people despise 'Fly' for its artsy pretensions and its go-nowhere plot arc. Others frankly think it belongs much higher on this list. But we can all agree that \"Fly\" is one of the great bottle episodes of the new golden age of TV.\"\n\nNegative reception toward \"Fly\" is primarily in the form of arguments that the episode is devoid of plot development and action. An unfavorable Tasha Robinson, however, also argued in \"The A.V. Club\" that the episode presents \"a vision of Walt that did not in any way coincide with the mental image I’d built of him over the course of the series, as a self-justifying, angry man who could be a real badass when required: Instead, we have to see him as irrational and petty to the point of rank stupidity, taking moronic action after action that clearly risks his safety and well-being… all to catch a fly.\" Robinson \"hated it\", writing about the episode for an article in which numerous writers for the site discussed what they thought were the weakest episodes of great shows.\n\n"}
{"id": "35912408", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35912408", "title": "Folk dance of Mexico", "text": "Folk dance of Mexico\n\nFolk dance of Mexico (\"ballet folklórico\") covers a wide range of Mexican dance forms. Folk dance, despite modernization and other social efforts, has survived.\n\nMexico’s modern folk dance tradition is a blending of elements from its Indigenous, African, and European heritage. Before the arrival of the Spanish, indigenous dance developed with strong ties to the religious practices. For the Aztecs, there were two levels of dance, one for the common people, often related to the agricultural cycle and those for the elite. After the Conquest, the Spanish initially worked to eradicate indigenous dances, considering them “too pagan” and succeeded with a number of forms, especially those associated with the priest and ruling classes. However, they were unable to eradicate the more popular forms, especially in the rural and more inaccessible regions of New Spain. Instead, evangelizers worked to adapt dances to Christianity, giving them new meanings. For this reason, most of these dances have suffered at least some modification since the pre Hispanic era.\nDance evolved drastically from 1520 to 1750, mostly among the indigenous and mestizo descendents. One of the first adaptations was allowing the indigenous to continue dances with religious aspects but in homage to the Virgin Mary or other Catholic personage. One of the first areas to begin innovation was Tlaxcala, were dances to reenact the Conquest are traced. In addition, a number of European dances, music and instruments were introduced including Moros y cristianos (a mock battle between Moors and Christians brought t the central states), Los Archos, Las Escadas, Los Machetes, El Paloteo, Las Cintas and Los Doce Pares. Other European dances include La Zambra, La Zarabanda, La Contradanza, seguidillas, fandangos, huapangos, jotas, boleros, zambras and zapateados. In some cases, these dances were modified or given entirely new choreography in Mexico. Most of the traditional dances performed today took on their forms during the colonial period but they were not firmly part of Mexican identity until after the Mexican War of Independence when it received its first surge in popularity. For example, the jarabe dance of Jalisco, became a political tool to evoke feelings of patriotism and “liberty.” In fact, this dance became intricately linked to the independence movement, causing it to be called the Jarabe Mexicano. Its popularity led to interest in other Mexican traditional dances, especially those danced to son music.\n\nDespite modern and foreign influences in Mexico’s culture in the 19th and 20th centuries, waves of nationalism have kept much of the country’s folk dance tradition alive to the present day. The next wave of popularity came after the Mexican Revolution, which also created new songs in folk styles such as the still popular La Adelita, La Valentina, and La Cucaracha. The years after the Revolution also sparked interest in Mexico’s indigenous heritage shifting away from the European emphasis of the Porfirian era. This was reinforced by the muralists and other artists of the 1920s and 1930s whose political aims were to forge a Mexican identity, rejecting foreign influences and politics. In the 1930s, the popularity of the dance prompted education and more formal training in it, with educational centers all over Mexico offering classes including the Departamento de Bellas Arts (Fine Arts Department) of Mexico City. Interest in folk dance declined in the 1950s and 1960s, but the Mexican government continued to subsidize it for its aesthetic and social value. This included the support of folk dance or ballet folklórico companies, the most famous of which is the Ballet Folklórico de México founded by Amalia Hernández in 1952.\n\nToday, traditional Mexican folk dance is a defining element of Mexico’s popular culture nationally and internationally. Preservation and promotion of dances nationally have depended on whether they are seen as part of Mexico’s national identity. It is one of the few areas where indigenous practices are conserved and promoted rather than depreciated or eliminated. One reason for this is “indigenismo” the ongoing struggles of a number of indigenous communities to resist outside influences into their cultures and Mexican government efforts to assimilate them to create a homogenous national identity. Since the 1990s, these efforts have become more political in nature and have resulted in more interest in preserving pre Hispanic cultural forms. ( The government also works to preserve and promote a number of dance forms, with folk dance mandatory in public schools. In September 2011, 457 people set a Guinness record for the largest folk dance performance at the International Mariachi and Charreria Conference in Guadalajara, accompanied by over 300 mariachi musicians from Mexico, Argentina, Ecuador, Colombia and the United States.\n\nMexican folk dance has had an important impact on the culture of the United States, especially in Mexican American communities. This has not only included the preservation of dances that existed before the Mexican–American War in the US Southwest, but other dances, such as the Aztecas or Concheros, dance have migrated north since the 1970s.\n\nMexican folk dance is an uneven synthesis of different cultural traditions. Its historical roots is the synthesis of indigenous, European and African cultural influences but it continues to evolves with influences from modern pop culture. It is not one particular style but rather a collection of various regional and ethnic traditions. Dance traditions vary widely over Mexico’s expanse. In some areas, such as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and the Yucatan Peninsula, the pre Hispanic elements have almost completely disappeared. In others, such as Totonacapan (in the states of Veracruz and Puebla), among the Nahuas of Guerrero and State of Mexico, the Huastecs of San Luis Potosí and areas in the northwest of the country, indigenous elements have been strongly maintained. Those considered native or indigenous include Los Voladores, Los Quetzales, and the Deer Dance. Dances that survive relatively intact are in areas that were remote from colonial authorities. However, their “purity” is under debate.\n\nMost of the ancient dances have been modified in various ways, although most of these are superficial with the basic movements remaining intact from the pre Hispanic period. The aspect to change most has been costuming. The materials used to produce dance costumes, adapting to new materials and the loss of old ones. The use of hides and feathers is the oldest of costuming traditions, but today costumes can be made of synthetic fabrics and other modern elements. One common substitution is the use of mirrors on costumes to replace polished stones.\n\nInstruments used to accompany the dancers have changed to include those from Europe, but pre Hispanic ones, especially drums and flutes, are still used. However, as many dances are still tied to religious events, knowing how to play the traditional songs and dance the traditional dances still gives dancers and musicians social stature, as they are keepers of tradition and expected to pass it along to the next generation.\n\nTraditional dance generally involves the history and/or the cosmology of the people who perform it, and is a part of the social cohesion of that group. While varying widely, many folk dances in Mexico share some common elements. Animals that appear in these dances are generally those that were religiously significant to pre-Hispanic indigenous people. These animals include deer, serpents, eagles, and jaguars. After the Conquest, dancers added other animals—such as horses, bulls, and roosters. Masks are used in various ways in Mexican dance. They can be used to “transform” the dancer into a character, either metaphorically or religiously, it can be used to hide the dancer’s identity for festivals such as Carnival to allow for pranks and/or it can be used for social commentary, for example a farmer wearing a mask and military-style clothing to protest corrupt police. The use of mirrors on costumes are to represent the life force of the sun as its light is reflected as the dancers move. \n\nMost Mexican traditional dance shows indigenous and/or European heritage, but there are some that show the country’s African past, especially in Veracruz and the Costa Chica region in Guerrero and Oaxaca. Like indigenous dances, African based ones often involved the use of masks, costumes and other props that carry various meanings with the dances themselves function as a form of social cohesion. In Veracruz, best known “African” dances include Los Negritos, along with various huapangos and sons. In the Costa Chica, the best known of these dances include Los Diablos, Las Tortugas and Toro de Petate.\n\nGenerally, folk dance is popular and well supported by various government efforts, but not all to the same extent. Those considered representative of the country and popular outside their home region, such as the \"jarocho\" or \"jarabe\" receive regional and federal support. Those without that type of popularity are performed mostly in local and regional religious events. While much support is geared to preserving dance forms, art forms outside of Mexico still have influence. Traditional dance is taught alongside more modern dance such as salsa, merengue and hip hop in various schools and cultural centers across the country with some crossover effect.\n\nMexico’s best known folk dance troupe is the Ballet Folklórico de México, which was founded by dancer Amalia Hernández in 1952. The troupe consists of forty dancers, a mariachi band and sixteen other musicians. Counting support staff such as costume and set designers, the organization involves over 600 people. The group began with eight dancers with sporadic performances until they were invited to perform on television for a program called Función de Gala. Since 1959, it has performed regularly at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City. In 1970 was named the official folk dance company of Mexico.\n\nAmalia Hernández has become a cultural ambassador for Mexico through her work with the dance troupe until her death in 2000 at the age of 84. Today, her grandson Salvador López is the director of the group. The repertoire maintains the traditional dances although somewhat updated with the choreography of López. Dances include the Jarabe tapatío, the Deer Dance and the Aztecs/Concheros. It also has “new” dances such as \"Adelitas,\" which honors the women of the Mexican Revolution. The group has performed over 15,000 times in sixty counties and 300 cities in Europe, Asia and Latin America. It has an average of 250 performances per year.\n\nThe Concheros dance is also known as Apaches, Indios and Chichimecas. It is a ritual dance that likely developed after 1522 as a means of preserving some elements of pre Hispanic culture. Members of these dance troupes are part of formal societies and unlike some other groups admit women. These troupes perform at annual festival mostly in honor of patron saints—especially in the Villa de Guadalupe, Amecameca, Chalma and Los Remedios. These are located north, east, south, and west of Mexico City, a remnant of the importance of the cardinal directions to indigenous people. Dancers dress in indigenous style garb that can include loincloths, feathered headdresses body paint and more. They are accompanied by indigenous drums, flutes and small lutes made from armadillo shells (showing European influence). The symbolism and most of the steps are indigenous.\n\nDanza de los Voladores (Dance of the Flyers) is a dance/ceremony/ritual still performed in Mexico today, best known in the Totonacapan area of northern Veracaruz and northern Puebla states. It is believed to have originated with the Nahua, Huastec and Otomi peoples in central Mexico, and then spread throughout most of Mesoamerica. The ritual consists of dance and the climbing of a 30-meter pole from which four of the five participants then launch themselves tied with ropes to descend to the ground. The fifth remains on top of the pole, dancing and playing a flute and drum. The ceremony was named an Intangible Cultural Heritage by UNESCO in order to help the ritual survive in the modern world.\n\nMoros y cristianos (Moors and Christians) is not indigenous in origin. It was introduced by monks in the 16th century and widely practiced in central Mexico, especially Michoacán. The dancers form two groups to represents the two religious, each wearing masks and capes with Moors marked by a crescent moon and the Christians with a cross. The other elements of the dress vary widely with some versions having the Christians dressed as charros. This dance is part of a larger ceremony that can last up to two days and consist in mock battles and negotiations as well as dance. The voices of the participants generally sing and speak with a high-pitch or falsetto voice. Santiagos is named after the patron saint of Spain, Saint James. It is a dance of Spanish origin similar to Moros y cristianos except that the Saint is the main character. Sometimes the character rides on a real horse or the costume can contain a frame of a horse.\n\nLa Conquista, sometimes called Los Marqueses tells the story of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. There are dancers who represent the main protagonists including Hernán Cortés, La Malinche and Moctezuma. Various versions with include other characters. Those who represent the Spanish soldiers carry arquebuses and usually wear modern clothing. Those who represent the indigenous wear feathers and carry bows and arrows frequently with those dressed as Eagle and Jaguar warriors of rank. All the dancers wear masks. The dance represents the battles between the two groups ending either with the killing of Moctezuma or with the baptism of the indigenous. This is a widely performed dance especially in Michoacan and Jalisco. \n\nThe Danza de los Viejitos (Dance of the Little Old Men) is performed in Michoacán, especially in the Lake Pátzcuaro area. The dance as known today was created by Gervasio López in the mid 20th century, who had a passion for traditional folk music and dance of this region. While the dance is “new” it is based on ancient rhythms and steps and accompanied by traditional instruments. The dancers basically imitate old men, dressed in traditional indigenous clothing and carrying canes. The dancers wear wood-soled shoes to accentuate the noise made while stomping. Although a regional dance, it has been performed abroad in the United States and Europe.\n\nThe Danza de los Quetzales is performed in Puebla. The Huehues dance is performed by the Totonaca and is similar to the Quetzales dance. The headdress is smaller and less ostentatious.\nThe Chinelos dance is derived from Carnival celebrations in what are now the south of Mexico City, Morelos and the State of Mexico. Since Carnival celebrations allow the wearing of masks for anonymity and behaviors not normally tolerated, a tradition arose for the indigenous to make fun of the Spanish elite and their dress through the dance. The word “chinelos” is derived from the Nahuatl word \"zineloquie,\" which means “disguised.” Chinelos dancers wear masks imitating the fair skin and beards of the Spanish along with elaborate dress and gloves. They are the best known Carnival dancers in Mexico with Morelos have the most groups. The Chinelo dancers are now a symbol of the state of Morelos, with the tradition increasing with more towns having dance troupes and it is possible to see troupes dancing at times other than Carnival. It is even possible to hire Chinelos dancers for special occasions.\n\nOcho Vicios (Eight Vices) involves a number of dancers who represent the eight vices as well as an angel, a devil, a doctor and a priest. It involves a number of movements and spoken text. It is similar to a dance called the Siete Pecados (Seven Sins). Danza de los Tres Poderes (Dance of the Three Powers) is a moral tale similar to Siete pecados and Ocho vicios, which was introduced by the evangelizers to the indigenous. The main protagonists are the Archangel Michael, the Devil and a personification of death.\nSegadores contains a number of characters, which includes the “captain” who pays his workers with money from the Mexican Revolution called “bilimbiques,” workers who become lazy and a woman who tends a store but in reality is a man. This dance is performed in some small communities in the State of Mexico .\n\nAcatlaxquis is an Otomi dance with pre Hispanic origins but uses a pan-style flute for accompaniment. The dancers form and arch with sugar cane stalks forming a kind of cupola. This dance is most often performed in the Pahuatlán municipality, along with the Voladores.\nThe Danza de los Arcos is done by men who carry large arches decorated with paper flowers and dance in rows. Their costumes are white with colorful sashes across the chest. It is mostly performed in Hidalgo, State of Mexico and Puebla.\n\nArrieros dancers wear white costumes, sometimes with leather chaps, and ride decoratively dressed donkeys. The dance proceeds as a procession and usually ends at a feast, which is central to the festival, with each “arriero” bringing a dish to share.\n\nCaporales is a dance with men dressed as charros and used a small wooden bull. It is popular in the State of Mexico and Guanajuato.\n\nHuehuenches or Huehues is a dance whose name is derived from the god Huehueteotl the god of old age and of the New Fire. A better known similar dance is called the Dance of the Viejitos.\n\nOther dances from the state of Michoacán include Las Iguiris, Mariposas, Danza de los Tumbis, Paloteros and Pescado Blanco.\n\nNegritos is danced in the Totonacapan region in Veracruz and Puebla.\n\nMatlachines is mostly performed in the states of Zacatecas and Aguascalientes but it is popular in various parts of the country, especially in the north. It consists of dancers in distinctive dress that includes brightly colored skirts, long tunics and feathered headdresses. The tunics were originally made with deerskin but today they are made with rayon but maintain the traditional arrow pattern decoration. The headdresses are made with colored chicken feathers that are often the three colors of the Mexican flag: green, white and red. The headdress also often has a brain made with human or horse hair and fringe in the front that partially covers the faces of the dancers. The dancers wear sandals with wood soles to make more noise when they stomp. The dancers carry rattles on one hand and bows in the other, reminiscent of hunting. Another common adornment is a small mirror, usually over the arm.\n\nPascolas dancers wear white shirts and pants and a red handkerchief called a paliacate either around the neck or partially covering the face. A ribbon tied around the head with streamers or ribbons hanging from the back of the head to the waist. The calves of the dancers are covered in shells that rattles as he dance. They carry small metal pieces in their hands which they bang rhythmically along to music played on harps and violins.\n\nOther dances in the north include Caballitos, Chicaleros and Danza de Palma in Nuevo León, Tsacan Son in San Luis Potosí and Los Pardos in Zacatecas.\n\nDanza del Venado (Deer Dance) is performed in Sonora and Sinaloa and in the very far south of Arizona by the Yaquis and Mayos . This dance is most associated with these peoples’ Lent and Easter celebrations, when indigenous beliefs mixed with the Catholicism introduced in the 17th and 18th centuries. The dance is part of ceremonies aimed at the renewal of the world in spring. Originally the dance was performed the night before hunting to ensure success, but today it is a means to communicate with other worlds. The deer dancer wears a shawl wrapped as a skirt with a belt traditionally made of deer hooves. He carries a gourd in each hand and ties rattles to his ankles. A real or imitation deer head is fastened to his head. Red ribbons wind around the horns to represent flowers.\n\nThe dance of the Parachicos is performed during the “Great Feast” in January each year in Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas. For several weeks, these dances take to the streets each day to honor a number of Catholic saints, especially Saint Sebastian. The dancers wear carved wooden masks, with a headdress made of ixtle, a serape, embroidered shawl and multicolored ribbons, carrying maracas. They are led by a “patron) who carries a guitar, plays the flute and carries a whip. Drummers provide rhythm. The dance has been named an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity .\n\nCochino (pig) is named after a pig’s head which is decorated and carried as part of the event. The head is decorated with flowers and rolls of colored paper, paper birds, rag dolls, and candies. The mouth holds a roll with the name of the person who well receive the head. The head is carried on a large, decorated platter by women who dance and smack their lips to indicate how delicious the animal is. This dance is generally performed in the Yucatan region.\n\nA large number of dances are performed in Oaxaca, especially along the coast. These include the Chareos, Danza de la Pluma (the Zapotec version of La Conquista), Danza de las Mascaritas, Tejoneros, Tenjorones, Danza del Tigre, Toro de Petate and Danza de Tortuga.\n\nThe Jarabe is considered Mexico’s “national dance” and is the best known outside the country, often called the “Mexican Hat Dance” in English. The dance was performed for the first time formally in 1790 at the Coliseo Theater in Mexico City. During the 1860s it was fashionable in high society. The dance symbolizes the courtship of a woman by a man, who at first is refused but accepted in the end. The two protagonists are usually a man in a charro suit and a woman in a “China Poblana” outfit. It was popularized internationally in the 20th century by Russian dancer Anna Pavlova who visited Mexico in 1919. She made the dance part of her permanent repertoire. The dance’s current form emerged nationally during the Mexican Revolution although various “jarabe” dances existed before this time, such as the Jarabe Jalisco, the Jarabe Atole and Jarabe Moreliana. The charros outfit is from Mexico’s cowboy tradition and the China Poblana outfit is based on the dress of an Asian woman who became famous in the city of Puebla in the colonial period. Today, this dress, especially the skirt, is heavily decorated with patriotic themes. \n\nMany notable dances are found in the state of Guerrero. The three most common dances of the coast of Oaxaca and Guerrero are the Devil Dance, the Turtle Dance and the Toro de Petate (Straw Bull Dance), all of which are tied to the area’s Afro-Mexican communities. The first three contains characteristics which are found only in this region and nowhere else in Mexico and include violence and even sexual overtures. The main characters, devils, turtles and bulls represented by those in masks, are mythical creatures which dance in the streets alongside humans who either challenge or subdue them. Other important Afro-Mexican dances include the Tiger Dance and the Tejorones.\nLos Chivos is another dance performed in Guerrero. It is dancers perform movements related to that of goats (chivos) accompanies by wood boxes used as drums and an instruments made from a donkey’s jaw, which is rubbed on the side with a wooden stick. The dancers wear red wooden masks with deer antlers covered in streamers and paper flowers, along with skirts that reach the knees. Machomula refers to a wooden horse’s head which is central to the dance performed in the Costa Chica of Guerrero. The night before a festival, this head is carried on beams all night while the men sing and sometimes perform parodies. On the day of the festival, they form a procession with the guardian of the horse’s head in front on a wooden horse. Pescados (Fish) is performed mostly in Guerrero by participants acting as fishermen with nets and with those that play the part of fish who are identified by small wooden fish that hang from their shoulders. There is one other character which is a lizard, who is covered with a wooden frame that opens and closes its mouth. It also carries some barbed wire which it used to try to hit the fishermen. It is similar to the Tortuga (turtle) dance. Tecuanes comes from Nahuatl which means jaguars or tigers. This dance is the only which features this animal. In this dance, the animal chases children and is in turned pursued by men, who wear masks, boots or chaps and very large sombreros. They carry whips which they use to hit the tiger who wears padding. The dance is very similar to Tlacololeros in its movements. Both are performed in Guerrero.\n\nLos Mudos (The Mute) takes its name from the fact that participants are forbidden to speak during the ceremony and in some cases throughout the festival. The costume is feminine in appearance using rustic wigs made of maguey fibers braided with ribbons of many colors. This dance is common among the Nahuas in Guerrero.\n\nPaixtles is one of the few pre Hispanic dances to remain free from European influence, mostly performed in Jalisco and Nayarit. Participants cover themselves with the moss that hangs from Montezuma Cypress trees and carry staves which have the head of a deer at one end. They accompany themselves with maracas that they carry. Dancers wear masks to cover the face and ribbons that hang from the head.\n\nOther important dances include La Judea, danced by the Coras during Holy Week in Nayarit, Sonajeros, danced in the south of Jalisco, and the Dance of the Cúrpites\n"}

It's eventually revealed that Derrick and Naomi came from the same home town and they were a couple in high school, much like Beau, Naomi refused Derrick and Derrick raped Naomi. Derrick denied the allegation and said Naomi only made it up so her father wouldn't be upset with her. Derrick wasn't very popular in school after the allegation so he moved after graduation and intentionally wanted to spread a rumor about Naomi to get her back. Beau finds out about this, and the two fight each other. Derrick manages to manipulate Beau into thinking they're both victims of Naomi's lies. Derrick goes to Naomi's dorm room to confront her, but Naomi attacks him and Derrick leaves. The next day, Naomi is pronounced dead and because of Derrick and Naomi's past (plus the new marks on Derrick's face,) the campus accuses Derrick of killing her. Investigators come to Derrick's apartment to search for clues and they have intense suspicions that Derrick's responsible. Under the overwhelming psychological pressure, Derrick admits to raping Naomi to Travis. The investigation was proven to be a setup by Jones, Travis, and their professor. To Derrick's surprise, Naomi was revealed to be alive after he confessed.\n\n\n\"Gossip\" received negative reviews from critics and currently holds a 28% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 65 reviews.\n\nThe film opened at #12 at the North American box office making $2.3 million USD in its opening weekend. The film suffered a 59% decline in box office earnings the following week, descending to #17.\n\n"}

In South Africa these are more commonly called \"gumboots\".\n\nThe boots may be embellished with bells, so that they ring as the dancers stamp on the ground. This sound would be a code or a different calling to say something to another person a short distance away. This was used to communicate in the mines as there was strictly no talking otherwise there would be severe, drastic punishments at the discretion of their superior.\n\nRooted back in the dark gold mine tunnels of South Africa, gumboot dancing has come full circle. Initially a codified tap used by black miners deprived of conversation, gumboot dancing today is one of the most expressive South African dance genres.\n\nGumboot dancers are commonly sighted on the streets and plazas of tourist areas in South Africa, such as the Victoria & Alfred Waterfront in Cape Town. Many of the steps and routines are parodies of the officers and guards who controlled the mines and barracks of South African gold miners. Like other forms of African dance, Gumboot utilizes the concepts of polyrhythm and total body articulation, drawing from the cultural dances of the African workers that manned the mines. It is a percussive dance made by idiophones or autophones (objects of the everyday life vibrating by themselves), and is similar in execution and style to forms of \"stepping\" done by African-American fraternities and sororities.\n\nThe dance is the highlight of the performance of Black Umfolosi, a prominent South African folk group.\n\nThe album \"Graceland\" by the American pop singer Paul Simon has a song titled \"Gumboots\", which is performed in the style of South African township jive (mbaqanga) and contains performances by members of the Boyoyo Boys.\n\nThe British-American composer David Bruce has written a clarinet quintet entitled \"Gumboots\", which was inspired by Gumboot dancing. It was commissioned by Carnegie Hall in 2008 and can be heard in full on their website, performed by Todd Palmer and the St. Lawrence String Quartet.\n\nSince the 1990s and 2000s, Drakensberg Boys' Choir School based at gumboot dancing the folk-African part of their repertoire and white gumboots are the part of the second variant of their concert costume (the first variant is a classical \"white man's\" costume).\n\n"}
{"id": "323858", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=323858", "title": "History of animation", "text": "History of animation\n\nThe history of animation started long before the development of cinematography. Humans have probably attempted to depict motion as far back as the paleolithic period. Shadow play and the magic lantern offered popular shows with projected images on a screen, moving as the result of manipulation by hand and/or some minor mechanics. In 1833 the phenakistiscope introduced the stroboscopic principle of modern animation, and would also provide the basis for cinematography.\n\nThere are several examples of early sequential images that may seem similar to series of animation drawings. Most of these examples would only allow an extremely low frame rate when they are animated, resulting in short and crude animations that are not very lifelike. However, it's very unlikely that these images were intended to be somehow viewed as an animation. It is possible to imagine technology that could have been used in the periods of their creation, but no conclusive evidence in artifacts or descriptions have been found. It is sometimes argued that these early sequential images are too easily interpreted as \"pre-cinema\" by minds accustomed to film, comic books and other modern sequential images, while it is uncertain that the creators of these images envisioned anything like it. The motion of instances smaller than a second that are necessary to break down an action into sufficient phases for fluent animation would not really develop before the 19th century.\n\nEarly examples of attempts to capture the phenomenon of motion into a still drawing can be found in paleolithic cave paintings, where animals are often depicted with multiple legs in superimposed positions. It has been claimed that these superimposed figures were intended for a form of animation with the flickering light of the flames of a fire or a passing torch illuminating different parts of the painted rock wall, revealing different parts of the motion.\n\nArchaeological finds of small paleolithic discs with a hole in the middle and drawings on both sides have been claimed to be a kind of prehistoric thaumatropes that show motion when spun on a string.\nA 5,200-year old pottery bowl discovered in Shahr-e Sukhteh, Iran has five sequential images painted around it that seem to show phases of a goat leaping up to nip at a tree.\nAn Egyptian mural approximately 4000 years old, found in the tomb of Khnumhotep at the Beni Hassan cemetery, features a very long series of images that apparently depict the sequence of events in a wrestling match.\n\nThe Roman poet and philosopher Lucretius (c. 99 BC – c. 55 BC) wrote in his poem \"De rerum natura\" a few lines that come close to the basic principles of animation: \"...when the first image perishes and a second is then produced in another position, the former seems to have altered its pose. Of course this must be supposed to take place very swiftly: so great is their velocity, so great the store of particles in any single moment of sensation, to enable the supply to come up.\" It must be noted that this was in the context of dream images, rather than images produced by an actual or imagined technology.\n\nThe medieval codex \"Sigenot\" (circa 1470) has sequential illuminations with relatively short intervals between different phases of action. Each page has a picture inside a frame above the text, with great consistency in size and position throughout the book (with a consistent difference in size for the recto and verso sides of each page).\n\nSeven drawings by Leonardo da Vinci (c. 1510) extending over two folios in the Windsor Collection, \"Anatomical Studies of the Muscles of the Neck, Shoulder, Chest, and Arm\", have detailed renderings of the upper body and less-detailed facial features. The sequence shows multiple angles of the figure as it rotates and the arm extends. Because the drawings show only small changes from one image to the next, together they imply the movement of a single figure.\n\nAncient Chinese records contain several mentions of devices, including one made by the inventor Ding Huan, that were said to \"give an impression of movement\" to a series of human or animal figures on them, but these accounts are unclear and may only refer to the actual movement of the figures through space.\n\nSince before 1000 CE the Chinese had a rotating lantern which had silhouettes projected on its thin paper sides that appeared to chase each other. This was called the \"trotting horse lamp\" [走馬燈] as it would typically depict horses and horse-riders. The cut-out silhouettes were attached inside the lantern to a shaft with a paper vane impeller on top, rotated by heated air rising from a lamp. Some versions added extra motion with jointed heads, feet or hands of figures triggered by a transversely connected iron wire.\n\nVolvelles have moving parts, but these and other paper materials that can be manipulated into motion are usually not regarded as animation.\n\nShadow play has much in common with animation: people watching moving figures on a screen as a very popular form of entertainment, usually a story with dialogue, sounds and music. The figures could be very detailed and very articulated.\n\nThe earliest projection of images was most likely done in primitive shadowgraphy dating back to prehistory. It evolved into more refined forms of shadow puppetry, mostly with flat jointed cut-out figures which are held between a source of light and a translucent screen. The shapes of the puppets sometimes include translucent color or other types of detailing. The history of shadow puppetry is uncertain, but seems to have originated in Asia, possibly in the 1st millennium BCE. Clearer records seem to go back to around 900 CE. It later spread to the Ottoman empire and seems not to have reached Europe before the 17th century. It became very popular in France at the end of the 18th century. François Dominique Séraphin started his elaborate shadow shows in 1771 and performed them until his death in 1800. His heirs continued until their theatre closed in 1870. Séraphin developed the use of clockwork mechanisms to automate the show.\n\nAround the time cinematography was developed several theaters in Montmartre showed elaborate \"Ombres Chinoises\" shows that were very successful. The famous Le Chat Noir produced 45 different shows between 1885 and 1896.\n\nMoving images were possibly projected with the magic lantern since its invention by Christiaan Huygens in 1659. His sketches for magic lantern slides have been dated to that year and are the oldest known document concerning the magic lantern. One encircled sketch depicts Death raising his arm from his toes to his head, another shows him moving his right arm up and down from his elbow and yet another taking his skull off his neck and placing it back. Dotted lines indicate the intended movements.\n\nTechniques to add motion to painted glass slides for the magic lantern were described since circa 1700. These usually involved parts (for instance limbs) painted on one or more extra pieces of glass moved by hand or small mechanisms across a stationary slide which showed the rest of the picture. Popular subjects for mechanical slides included the sails of a windmill turning, a procession of figures, a drinking man lowering and raising his glass to his mouth, a head with moving eyes, a nose growing very long, rats jumping in the mouth of a sleeping man. A more complex 19th century rackwork slide showed the then known eight planets and their satellites orbiting around the sun. Two layers of painted waves on glass could create a convincing illusion of a calm sea turning into a very stormy sea tossing some boats about by increasing the speed of the manipulation of the different parts.\n\nIn 1770 Edmé-Gilles Guyot detailed how to project a magic lantern image on smoke to create a transparent, shimmering image of a hovering ghost. This technique was used in the phantasmagoria shows that became very popular in several parts of Europe between 1790 and the 1830s. Other techniques were developed to produce convincing ghost experiences. The lantern was handheld to move the projection across the screen (which was usually an almost invisible transparent screen behind which the lanternist operated hidden in the dark). A ghost could seem to approach the audience or grow larger by moving the lantern away from the screen, sometimes with the lantern on a trolley on rails. Multiple lanterns made ghosts move independently and were occasionally used for superimposition in the composition of complicated scenes.\n\nDissolving views became a popular magic lantern show, especially in England in the 1830s and 1840s. These typically had a landscape changing from a winter version to a spring or summer variation by slowly diminishing the light from one version while introducing the aligned projection of the other slide. Another use showed the gradual change of for instance groves into cathedrals.\n\nBetween the 1840s and 1870s several abstract magic lantern effects were developed. This included the chromatrope which projected dazzling colorful geometrical patterns by rotating two painted glass discs in opposite directions.\n\nOccasionally small shadow puppets had been used in phantasmagoria shows. Magic lantern slides with jointed figures set in motion by levers, thin rods, or cams and worm wheels were also produced commercially and patented in 1891. A popular version of these \"Fantoccini slides\" had a somersaulting monkey with arms attached to mechanism that made it tumble with dangling feet. Fantoccini slides are named after the Italian word for puppets like marionettes or jumping jacks.\n\nNumerous devices that successfully displayed animated images were introduced well before the advent of the motion picture. These devices were used to entertain, amaze, and sometimes even frighten people. The majority of these devices didn't project their images, and could only be viewed by a one or a few persons at a time. They were considered optical toys rather than devices for a large scale entertainment industry like later animation. Many of these devices are still built by and for film students learning the basic principles of animation.\n\nAn article in the \"Quarterly Journal of Science, Literature, and The Arts\" (1821) raised some interest in optical illusions of curved spokes in rotating wheels seen through vertical apertures. In 1824 Peter Mark Roget provided mathematical details about the appearing curvatures and added the observation that the spokes appeared motionless. Roget claimed that the illusion is due to the fact “that an impression made by a pencil of rays on the retina, if sufficiently vivid, will remain for a certain time after the cause has ceased.” This was later seen as the basis for the theory of \"persistence of vision\" as the principle of how we see film as motion rather than the successive stream of still images actually presented to the eye. This theory has been discarded as the (sole) principle of the effect since 1912, but remains in many film history explanations. However, Roget's experiments and explanation did inspire some further research by Michael Faraday and also by Joseph Plateau that would eventually bring about the invention of animation.\n\nIn April 1825 the first \"thaumatrope\" was published by W. Phillips (in anonymous association with John Ayrton Paris) and became a very popular toy. The pictures on either side of a small cardboard disc seem to blend into one combined image when it is twirled quickly by the attached strings. This is often used as an illustration of what has often been called \"persistence of vision\" (scientifically better known as positive afterimages). Although a thaumatrope can also be used for two-phase animation, no examples are known to have been produced with this effect until long after the phénakisticope had established the principle of animation.\n\nThe phénakisticope (better known by the misspelling phenakistiscope or phenakistoscope) was the first animation device using rapid successive substitution of sequential pictures. The pictures are evenly spaced radially around a disc, with small rectangular apertures at the rim of the disc. The animation could be viewed through the slits of the spinning disc in front of a mirror. It was invented in November or December 1832 by the Belgian Joseph Plateau and almost simultaneously by the Austrian Simon von Stampfer. Plateau first published about his invention in January 1833. The publication included an illustration plate of a fantascope with 16 frames depicting a pirouetting dancer.\n\nThe phénakisticope was very successful as a novelty toy and within a year very many sets of stroboscopic discs were published across Europe, with almost as many different names for the device - including \"Fantascope\" (Plateau), \"The Stroboscope\" (Stampfer) and \"Phénakisticope\" (Parisian publisher Giroux & Cie).\n\nIn July 1833 Simon Stampfer described the possibility of using the stroboscope principle in a cylinder (as well as on looped strips) in a pamphlet accompanying the second edition of his version of the phénakisticope. British mathematician William George Horner suggested a cylindrical variation of Plateau's phénakisticope in January 1834. Horner planned to publish this \"Dædaleum\" with optician King, Jr in Bristol but it \"met with some impediment probably in the sketching of the figures\".\n\nIn 1865 William Ensign Lincoln invented the definitive zoetrope with easily replaceable strips of images. It also had an illustrated paper disc on the base, which was not always exploited on the commercially produced versions. Lincoln licensed his invention to Milton Bradley and Co. who first advertised it on December 15, 1866.\n\n John Barnes Linnett patented the first flip book in 1868 as the \"kineograph\". A flip book is a small book with relatively springy pages, each having one in a series of animation images located near its unbound edge. The user bends all of the pages back, normally with the thumb, then by a gradual motion of the hand allows them to spring free one at a time. As with the phenakistoscope, zoetrope and praxinoscope, the illusion of motion is created by the apparent sudden replacement of each image by the next in the series, but unlike those other inventions no view-interrupting shutter or assembly of mirrors is required and no viewing device other than the user's hand is absolutely necessary. Early film animators cited flip books as their inspiration more often than the earlier devices, which did not reach as wide an audience.\n\nThe older devices by their nature severely limit the number of images that can be included in a sequence without making the device very large or the images impractically small. The book format still imposes a physical limit, but many dozens of images of ample size can easily be accommodated. Inventors stretched even that limit with the mutoscope, patented in 1894 and sometimes still found in amusement arcades. It consists of a large circularly-bound flip book in a housing, with a viewing lens and a crank handle that drives a mechanism that slowly rotates the assembly of images past a catch, sized to match the running time of an entire reel of film.\n\nFrench inventor Charles-Émile Reynaud developed the praxinoscope in 1876 and patented it in 1877. It is similar to the zoetrope but instead of the slits in the cylinder it has twelve rectangular mirrors placed evenly around the center of the cylinder. Each mirror reflects another image of the picture strip placed opposite on the inner wall of the cylinder. When rotating the praxinoscope shows the sequential images one by one, resulting in a fluent animation. The praxinoscope allowed a much clearer view of the moving image compared to the zoetrope, since the zoetrope's images were actually mostly obscured by the spaces in between its slits. In 1879 Reynaude registered a modification to the praxinoscope patent to include the \"Praxinoscope Théâtre\", which utilized the Pepper's ghost effect to present the animated figures in an exchangeable background. Later improvements included the \"Praxinoscope à projection\" (marketed since 1882) which used a double magic lantern to project the animated figures over a till projection of a background.\n\nEadweard Muybridge had circa 70 of his famous chronophotographic sequences painted on glass discs for the zoopraxiscope projector that he used in his popular lectures between 1880 and 1895. In the 1880s the images were painted onto the glass in dark contours. Later discs made between 1892 and 1894 had outlines drawn by Erwin F. Faber that were photographically printed on the disc and then coloured by hand, but these were probably never used in the lectures. The painted figures were largely transposed from the photographs, but many fanciful combinations were made and sometimes imaginary elements were added.\n\nCharles-Émile Reynaud further developed his projection praxinoscope into the Théâtre Optique with transparent hand-painted colorful pictures in a long perforated strip wound between two spools, patented in December 1888. From 28 October 1892 to March 1900 Reynaud gave over 12,800 shows to a total of over 500.000 visitors at the Musée Grévin in Paris. His \"Pantomimes Lumineuses\" series of animated films each contained 300 to 700 frames that were manipulated back and forth to last 10 to 15 minutes per film. A background scene was projected separately. Piano music, song and some dialogue were performed live, while some sound effects were synchronized with an electromagnet. The first program included three cartoons: \"Pauvre Pierrot\" (created in 1891), \"Un bon bock\" (created in 1888, now lost), and \"Le Clown et ses chiens\" (created in 1890, now lost). Later on the titles \"Autour d'une cabine \" (created in 1893) and \"A rêve au coin du feu\" would be part of the performances.\n\nDespite the success of Reynaud's films it took some time before animation was adapted in the film industry that came about after the introduction of Lumiere's Cinematograph in 1895. Georges Méliès' early fantasy and trick films (released between 1896 and 1913) occasionally came close to including animation with substitution splice effects, painted props or painted creatures that were moved in front of painted backgrounds (mostly using wires), and film colorization by hand. Méliès also popularized the stop trick, with a single change made to the scene in between shots, that had already been used in Edison's \"The Execution of Mary Stuart\" in 1895 and probably led to the development of stop-motion animation some years later. It seems to have lasted until 1906 before proper animated films started to appear in cinemas. The dating of earlier films with animation is contested, while other films that may have used stop motion or other animation techniques are lost and can't be checked. \n\nIn 1897 German toy manufacturer Gebrüder Bing had a first prototype of their kinematograph. In November 1898 they presented this toy film projector, possibly the first of its kind, at a toy festival in Leipzig. Soon other toy manufacturers, including Ernst Plank and Georges Carette, sold similar devices. Around the same time the French company Lapierre marketed a similar projector. The toy cinematographs were basically magic lanterns with one or two small spools that used standard \"Edison perforation\" 35mm film. These projectors were intended for the same type of \"home entertainment\" toy market that most of these manufacturers already provided with praxinoscopes and toy magic lanterns. Apart from relatively expensive live-action films, the manufacturers produced many cheaper films by printing lithographed drawings. These animations were probably made in black-and-white from around 1898 or 1899, but at the latest by 1902 they were made in color. The pictures were often traced from live-action films (much like the later rotoscoping technique). These very short films depicted a simple repetitive action and were created to be projected as a loop - playing endlessly with the film ends put together. The lithograph process and the loop format follow the tradition that was set by the zoetrope and praxinoscope.\n\n\"Katsudō Shashin\", from an unknown creator, was discovered in 2005 and is speculated to be the oldest work of animation in Japan, with Natsuki Matsumoto, an expert in iconography at the Osaka University of Arts and animation historian Nobuyuki Tsugata determining the film was most likely made between 1907 and 1911. The film consists of a series of cartoon images on fifty frames of a celluloid strip and lasts three seconds at sixteen frames per second. It depicts a young boy in a sailor suit who writes the kanji characters \"\" (\"katsudō shashin\", or \"moving picture\"), then turns towards the viewer, removes his hat, and offers a salute. Evidence suggests it was mass-produced to be sold to wealthy owners of home projectors. To Matsumoto, the relatively poor quality and low-tech printing technique indicate it was likely from a smaller film company.\n\nJ. Stuart Blackton was a British-American filmmaker, co-founder of the Vitagraph Studios and one of the first to use animation in his films.\"The Enchanted Drawing\" (1900) by is considered to be the first film recorded on standard picture film that included some sequences that are sometimes regarded as animation. It shows Blackton doing some \"lightning sketches\" of a face, cigars, a bottle of wine and a glass. The face changes expression when Blackton pours some wine into the face's mouth and takes his cigar. The technique used in this film was basically the substitution splice: the single change to scenes was that a drawing was replaced by a similar drawing with a different facial expression (or a drawn bottle and glass were replaced by real objects). Blackton had possibly used the same technique in a lost 1896 lightning sketch film. The effect can hardly be considered animation.\nBlackton's 1906 film \"Humorous Phases of Funny Faces\" is often regarded as the oldest known drawn animation on standard film. It features a sequence made with blackboard drawings that are changed between frames to show two faces changing expressions and some billowing cigar smoke, as well as two sequences that feature cutout animation. \n\nBlackton's \"The Haunted Hotel\" (1907) featured a combination of live-action with practical special effects and stop-motion animation of objects, a puppet and a model of the haunted hotel. It was the first stop-motion film to receive wide scale appreciation. Especially a large close-up view of a table being set by itself baffled viewers; there were no visible wires or other noticeable well-known tricks. This inspired other filmmakers, including French animator Émile Cohl and Segundo de Chomón, to work with the new technique. De Chomón would release the similar \"The House of Ghosts\" and \"El hotel eléctrico\" in 1908.\n\nIn 1905 American film pioneer Edwin S. Porter used animated letters and a very simple cutout animation of two hands in the intertitles in \"How Jones lost his roll\". He experimented with a small bit of crude stop-motion animation in his trick film \"Dream of a Rarebit Fiend\" (1906). His 1907 film \"The \"Teddy\" Bears\" mainly shows people in bear costumes, but also features a short stop-motion segment with small teddy bears.\n\nSpanish filmmaker Segundo de Chomón made many trick films and has often been compared to Georges Méliès. De Chomón frequently used stop-motion in his films, even before the release of J. Stuart Blackton's groundbreaking \"The Haunted Hotel\". \"Le théâtre de Bob\" (1906) features over three minutes of stop-motion animation with dolls and some objects. \"El hotel eléctrico\" (1908) features much stop motion with objects, a bit of pixilation and one effect done with drawn animation (a few lines probably drawn on the negative that represent electric sparks).\n\nArthur Melbourne-Cooper was a British filmmaker who did much pioneering work in stop motion animation. He produced over 300 films between 1896 and 1915, of which an estimated 36 were all or in part animated. \n\nBased on later reports by Cooper and by his daughter Audrey Wadowska some believe that his \"Matches: an Appeal\" was produced in 1899 and therefore the very first stop-motion animation. The black-and-white film shows a matchstick figure writing an appeal to donate a Guinea for which Bryant and May would supply soldiers with sufficient matches. No extant archival records show that the film was indeed created in 1899 during the beginning of the Second Boer War. Others place it at 1914, during the beginning of World War I. Cooper created more \"Animated Matches\" scenes in the same setting. These are believed to also have been produced in 1899, while a release date of 1908 has also been given. There is also an \"Animated Matches\" film by Émile Cohl that was released by Gaumont in 1908, which may have caused more confusion about the release dates of Cooper's matchstick men animations. \n\nThe lost films \"Dolly's Toys\" (1901) and \"The Enchanted Toymaker\" (1904) may have included stop-motion animation. \"Dreams of Toyland\" (1908) features a scene with many animated toys that lasts circa three and a half minutes.\n\nThe French artist Émile Cohl created the first animated film using what came to be known as traditional animation methods: the 1908 \"Fantasmagorie\". The film largely consisted of a stick figure moving about and encountering all manner of morphing objects, such as a wine bottle that transforms into a flower. There were also sections of live action where the animator’s hands would enter the scene. The film was created by drawing each frame on paper and then shooting each frame onto negative film, which gave the picture a blackboard look. Cohl later went to Fort Lee, New Jersey near New York City in 1912, where he worked for French studio Éclair and spread its animation technique to the US.\n\nInfluenced by Émile Cohl, the author of the first puppet-animated film (i.e., The Beautiful Lukanida (1912)), Russian-born (ethnically Polish) director Wladyslaw Starewicz, known as Ladislas Starevich, started to create stop motion films using dead insects with wire limbs and later, in France, with complex and really expressive puppets. In 1912, he created \"The Cameraman's Revenge\", a complex tale of treason and violence between several different insects. It is a pioneer work of puppet animation, and the oldest animated film of such dramatic complexity, with characters filled with motivation, desire and feelings.\nMore detailed hand-drawn animations with detailed backgrounds and characters, were those directed by Winsor McCay, a successful newspaper cartoonist, including the 1911 \"Little Nemo\", the 1914 \"Gertie the Dinosaur\", and the 1918 \"The Sinking of the Lusitania\". \"Gertie the Dinosaur\" featured an early example of character development in drawn animation. The film was made for McCay's vaudeville act and as it played McCay would speak to Gertie who would respond with a series of gestures. There was a scene at the end of the film where McCay walked behind the projection screen and a view of him appears on the screen showing him getting on the cartoon dinosaur's back and riding out of frame. This scene made \"Gertie the Dinosaur\" the first film to combine live-action footage with hand-drawn animation. McCay hand-drew almost every one of the 10,000 drawings he used for the film.\n\nAlso in 1914, John Bray opened John Bray Studios, which revolutionized the way animation was created. Earl Hurd, one of Bray's employees patented the cel technique. This involved animating moving objects on transparent celluloid sheets. Animators photographed the sheets over a stationary background image to generate the sequence of images. This, as well as Bray's innovative use of the assembly line method, allowed John Bray Studios to create Colonel Heeza Liar, the first animated series.\n\nDuring the 1910s, the production of animated short films, typically referred to as \"cartoons\", became an industry of its own and cartoon shorts were produced for showing in movie theaters. The most successful producer at the time was John Randolph Bray, who, along with animator Earl Hurd, patented the cel animation process that dominated the animation industry for the rest of the decade.\n\nIn 1915, Max and Dave Fleischer invented rotoscoping, the process of using film as a reference point for animation and their studios went on to later release such animated classics as \"Ko-Ko the Clown\", \"Betty Boop\", \"Popeye the Sailor Man\", and \"Superman\". In 1918 McCay released \"The Sinking of the Lusitania\", a wartime propaganda film. McCay did use some of the newer animation techniques, such as cels over paintings—but because he did all of his animation by himself, the project wasn't actually released until just shortly before the end of the war. At this point the larger scale animation studios were becoming the industrial norm and artists such as McCay faded from the public eye.\n\nThe first known animated feature film was \"El Apóstol\", made in 1917 by Quirino Cristiani from Argentina. He also directed two other animated feature films, including 1931's \"Peludópolis\", the first feature length animation to use synchronized sound. None of these, however, survived.\n\nIn 1920, Otto Messmer of Pat Sullivan Studios created Felix the Cat. Pat Sullivan, the studio head took all of the credit for Felix, a common practice in the early days of studio animation. Felix the Cat was distributed by Paramount Studios, and it attracted a large audience. Felix was the first cartoon to be merchandised. He soon became a household name.\n\nIn Germany, during the 1920s the abstract animation was invented by Walter Ruttman, Hans Richter, and Oskar Fischinger, however, the Nazis censorship against so-called \"degenerate art\" prevented the abstract animation from developing after 1933.\n\nThe earliest surviving animated feature film is the 1926 silhouette-animated \"Adventures of Prince Achmed\", which used colour-tinted film. It was directed by German Lotte Reiniger and French/Hungarian Berthold Bartosch.\n\nIn 1923, a studio called Laugh-O-Grams went bankrupt and its owner, Walt Disney, opened a new studio in Los Angeles. Disney's first project was the \"Alice Comedies\" series, which featured a live action girl interacting with numerous cartoon characters. Disney's first notable breakthrough was 1928's \"Steamboat Willie\", the third of the Mickey Mouse series. The short film showed an anthropomorphic mouse named Mickey neglecting his work on a steamboat to instead make music using the animals aboard the boat. Even though many wrongly believe Steamboat Willie was the first cartoon with synchronized sound, since May 1924 and continuing through September 1926, Dave and Max Fleischer's Inkwell Studios produced 19 sound cartoons, part of the Song Car-Tunes series, using the Phonofilm \"sound-on-film\" process.\n\nIn 1933, Warner Brothers Cartoons was founded. While Disney's studio was known for its releases being strictly controlled by Walt Disney himself, Warner brothers allowed its animators more freedom, which allowed for their animators to develop more recognizable personal styles.\n\nThe first animation to use the full, three-color Technicolor method was \"Flowers and Trees,\" made in 1932 by Disney Studios, which won an Academy Award for the work. Color animation soon became the industry standard, and in 1934, Warner Brothers released \"Honeymoon Hotel\" of the Merrie Melodies series, their first color films. Meanwhile, Disney had realized that the success of animated films depended upon telling emotionally gripping stories; he developed an innovation called a \"story department\" where storyboard artists separate from the animators would focus on story development alone, which proved its worth when the Disney studio released in 1933 the first-ever animated short to feature well-developed characters, \"Three Little Pigs\". In 1935, Tex Avery released his first film with Warner Brothers. Avery's style was notably fast-paced, violent, and satirical, with a slapstick sensibility.\n\nMany consider Walt Disney's 1937 \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" the first animated feature film, though at least seven films were released earlier. However, Disney's film was the first one completely made using hand-drawn animation. The previous seven films, of which only four survive, were made using cutout, silhouette or stop motion, except for one—also made by Disney seven months prior to Snow White's release—\"Academy Award Review of Walt Disney Cartoons\". This was an anthology film to promote the upcoming release of Snow White. However, many do not consider this a genuine feature film because it is a package film. In addition, at approximately 41 minutes, the film does not seem to fulfill today's expectations for a feature film. However, the official BFI, AMPAS and AFI definitions of a feature film require that it be over 40 minutes long, which, in theory, should make it the first animated feature film using traditional animation.\n\nBut as Snow White was also the first one to become successful and well-known within the English-speaking world, people tend to disregard the seven films. Following Snow White's release, Disney began to focus much of its productive force on feature-length films. Though Disney did continue to produce shorts throughout the century, Warner Brothers continued to focus on features.\n\nColor television was introduced to the US Market in 1954. In 1958, Hanna-Barbera released \"The Huckleberry Hound Show\", the first half-hour television program to feature only animation. Terrytoons released \"Tom Terrific\" the same year. In 1960, Hanna-Barbera released another monumental animated television show, \"The Flintstones\", which was the first animated series on prime time television. Television significantly decreased public attention to the animated shorts being shown in theatres.\n\nInnumerable approaches to creating animation have arisen throughout the years. Here is a brief account of some of the non traditional techniques commonly incorporated.\n\nThis process is used for many productions, for example, the most common types of puppets are clay puppets, as used in \"The California Raisins\", \"Wallace and Gromit\" and \"Shaun the Sheep\" by Aardman, and figures made of various rubbers, cloths and plastic resins, such as \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\" and \"James and the Giant Peach\". Sometimes even objects are used, such as with the films of Jan Švankmajer.\n\nStop motion animation was also commonly used for special effects work in many live-action films, such as the 1914 Italian cult epic film \"Cabiria\", the 1933 version of \"King Kong\" and \"The 7th Voyage of Sinbad\".\n\nThe first fully computer-animated feature film was Pixar's \"Toy Story\" (1995). The process of CGI animation is still very tedious and similar in that sense to traditional animation, and it still adheres to many of the same principles.\n\nA principal difference of CGI animation compared to traditional animation is that drawing is replaced by 3D modeling, almost like a virtual version of stop-motion. A form of animation that combines the two and uses 2D computer drawing can be considered computer \"aided\" animation.\n\nMost CGI created films are based on animal characters, monsters, machines, or cartoon-like humans. Animation studios are now trying to develop ways to create realistic-looking humans. Films that have attempted this include \"\" in 2001, \"\" in 2005, \"The Polar Express\" in 2004, \"Beowulf\" in 2007 and \"\" in 2009. However, due to the complexity of human body functions, emotions and interactions, this method of animation is rarely used. The more realistic a CG character becomes, the more difficult it is to create the nuances and details of a living person, and the greater the likelihood of the character falling into the uncanny valley. The creation of hair and clothing that move convincingly with the animated human character is another area of difficulty. \"The Incredibles\" and \"Up\" both have humans as protagonists, while films like \"Avatar\" combine animation with live action to create humanoid creatures.\n\nCel-shading is a type of non-photorealistic rendering intended to make computer graphics appear hand-drawn. It is often used to mimic the style of a comic book or cartoon. It is a somewhat recent addition to computer graphics, most commonly turning up in console video games. Though the end result of cel-shading has a very simplistic feel like that of hand-drawn animation, the process is complex. The name comes from the clear sheets of acetate (originally, celluloid), called cels, that are painted on for use in traditional 2D animation. It may be considered a \"2.5D\" form of animation. True real-time cel-shading was first introduced in 2000 by Sega's \"Jet Set Radio\" for their Dreamcast console. Besides video games, a number of anime have also used this style of animation, such as \"Freedom Project\" in 2006.\n\nMachinima is the use of real-time 3D computer graphics rendering engines to create a cinematic production. Most often, video games are used to generate the computer animation. Machinima-based artists, sometimes called machinimists or machinimators, are often fan laborers, by virtue of their re-use of copyrighted materials.\n\nThe world's first two feature-length animated films and the first film with sound were developed in Argentina by Quirino Cristiani;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe history of Hollywood animation as an art form has undergone many changes in its hundred-year history, the following lists four separate chapters in the development of its animation:\n\n\nThe roots of Czech puppet animation began in the mid-1940s when puppet theater operators, Eduard Hofman and Jiří Trnka founded the Poetic animation school, Bratři v triku. Since that time animation has expanded and flourished.\n\nEstonian animation began in the 1930s and has carried on into the modern day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIran's animation owes largely to the animator Noureddin Zarrinkelk. Zarrinkelk was instrumental in founding the Institute for Intellectual Development of Children and Young Adults (IIDCYA) in Tehran in collaboration with the late father of Iranian graphics Morteza Momayez and other fellow artists like Farshid Mesghali, Ali Akbar Sadeghi, and Arapik Baghdasarian.\n\n\nAnimation in Malaysia began in 1946 with the establishment of the Malayan Film Unit (now known as National Film). The first short animated film was the Hikayat Sang Kancil (Anandam Xavier, 1978) and aired in 1983. Short films that appeared between 1985 and 1987 were: The Mouse & Monkey, The Mouse & Crocodile, The Crow Rage, the Rabbit Arrogant and the Lion of Haloba made by Hassan Abdul Muthalib.\n\n\"See: Animal Logic, Yoram Gross, Flying Bark Productions\"\n\n\n\"See: Weta Digital\"\n\n\n\n"}

Arab-American Palestinian comedian and award-winning journalist Ray Hanania and his companions from the \"Israeli–Palestinian Comedy Tour\" operate under the slogan: \"If we can laugh together, we can live together\".\n\nWarady and Hanania grew up in the same Chicago neighborhood, Pill Hill/South Shore Valley in the 1960s. Warady discovered Hanania while exploring the internet for references to Pill Hill and found Hanania's online book \"Midnight Flight: The Story of White Flight in Chicagoland\" (2000, Online, www.hanania.com). When Warady contacted Hanania and identified himself as an Israeli comedian, Hanania challenged Warady to appear on the same comedy stage with a Palestinian comedian to challenge the animosity enveloping both their peoples. Warady and Hanania arranged the first-ever Palestinian-Israeli comedy tour in the world, with four shows in Israel and one show in East Jerusalem in January 2007. The shows were internationally acclaimed and the duo organized a second tour of Israel and the Palestinian territories in June 2007. The comedians are joined by Aaron Freeman, a veteran of Second City in Chicago and an African American convert to Judaism, and by Yisrael Campbell, a Hasidic Jewish convert from Catholicism.\n\n\"Israeli–Palestinian Comedy Tour\" is the show of an American-Palestinian Ray Hanania and three Jewish comedians Charley Warady, Aaron Freeman and Yisrael Campbell, two of whom live in Israel.\n\nThe MidEastWeb Directory of Middle East Israel-Palestine Information Resources provides links to such shows. It says about \"Israeli–Palestinian Comedy Tour\": [it is] \"To make you laugh. To make you think. To help end conflict in the middle east.\" It further describes \"Stand Up For Peace\" as \"Scott Blakeman and Dean Obeidallah founded and produce Stand up For Peace, which presents Jewish and Arab-American comedians standing together for a non-violent, political solution to the Middle East crisis.\" \"The American Muslim\" journal (\"TAM\") mentions both shows as \"general good news\" \"for Muslims in 2007\" \n\nThe comedians perform around the world. The stage name of the group (officially \"Israeli–Palestinian Comedy Tour\") changes depending on the place the show is given. While in West Bank they are known as \"Ray Hanania And Three Hostages\", in Gaza they made it simpler - \"The Four Hostages\". When they give shows in United States of America, they are \"Three Jews And An Arab\", and in Israel they are back to their official name. All of them support the Two-state solution, but their opinions on the controversial issues about the status of East Jerusalem and other issues alike are not clearly expressed.\n\nAll their performances are filled with sparkling jokes, satire and humor about Middle East conflict that many believe is not a laughing matter. Comedians disagree. They believe that the laughter could lead to a better understanding between the opposite sides of the conflict.\n\nSome of their jokes are prepared before the show while others are just improvisations as the show progresses. Once at the beginning of the show given in one of the Chicago synagogues with mostly Jewish audience Hanania asked innocently: \"How many Arabs are here tonight?\" He held a pause during which the silent spectators looked puzzled ... and then exclaimed: \"Great security!\" And the laughing erupted.\n\nNo joke is off-limits no matter how politically incorrect it might be. Waraday starts on 72 virgins in connection to suicide bombings. He asks what 57-year-old menopausal grandmother who blew herself up not so long ago hoped to get in the Arab paradise:\n\nHanania together with his companion reasons: \n\nWhile performing in Syndrome Theater in Jerusalem Hanania shared the story about his wedding ceremony with his Jewish bride: \n\nWhen asked how he became involved with three Jewish comedians and Jewish humor Hanania jokingly responded: \"These guys stole our land, our homes, so I read a couple of books on Jewish humor, and I stole their jokes.\"\n\nComparing Israeli check points to toll plazas Charley Warady describes his experience with those:\n\nExplaining how voters in Gaza ended up electing Hamas he says:\n\nAaron Freeman jokes that \"in the Comedy Tour all the Jews get along with \"Ray\", but they all fight with each other.\"\n\nRay Hanania, Aaron Freeman Yisrael Campbell and Charley Warady revived the early comedy effort to bring everyone together with a new coalition of Palestinians and Muslims who are willing to work not just with Jews, but also Israelis, and Israelis who are willing to work not just with Muslims and Arabs but with Palestinians, the most difficult hurdle to overcome. The new coalition includes many more comedians including Ray's Jewish son, Aaron Hanania, and Palestinian Muslim Mona Aburmishan, Muslim Pakistani Arif Choudhury, Israeli Benji Lovett, and Jewish comic Larry Bloom.\n\nThe Israeli Palestinian Comedy troupe is the most mixed Arab-Jewish, Palestinian-Israeli, Muslim, Christian and Jewish group performing. Their motto remains \"If we can laugh together, we can live together.\" \n\nThe new website is http://www.IsraeliPalestinianComedy.com\n\n\"Stand Up For Peace\" is the name of the show performed by two men: a Jew Scott Blakeman and an Arab Dean Obeidallah. The men perform separately talking about everything from Patriot act to terrorism and September 11 attacks. They like performing in front of students. After performance they take questions together.\n\nDuring the 1990s, following the conclusion of the Oslo agreement and the Israeli-Jordanian Peace Treaty, two Jordanian artists - Nabil Sawalha and Hisham Yanes - established the duo Nabil and Hisham, which performed in Israel, the Palestinian Authority and Jordan.\n\n"}
{"id": "211714", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=211714", "title": "JAG (TV series)", "text": "JAG (TV series)\n\nJAG (U.S. military acronym for Judge Advocate General) is an American legal drama television show with a distinct U.S. Navy theme, created by Donald P. Bellisario, and produced by Belisarius Productions in association with Paramount Network Television (now CBS Television Studios). This series was originally aired on NBC for one season from September 23, 1995 to May 22, 1996 and then on CBS for an additional nine seasons from January 3, 1997 to April 29, 2005. The first season was co-produced with NBC Productions (now Universal Television) and was originally perceived as a \"Top Gun\" meets \"A Few Good Men\" hybrid series, both of which starred Tom Cruise.\n\nIn the spring of 1996, NBC announced that the series had been canceled after finishing 79th in the ratings, leaving one episode unaired. In December 1996, the rival network CBS announced it had picked up the series for a mid-season replacement original 15 completed episodes from its second season. For several seasons, \"JAG\" climbed in the ratings and ultimately ran for nine additional seasons. \"JAG\" furthermore spawned the hit series \"NCIS\", which in turn led to spin-offs \"\" and \"\".\n\nIn total, 227 episodes were produced over 10 seasons. At the time of the original airing of its fifth season in the United States, \"JAG\" was seen in over 90 countries worldwide. \"JAG\" entered syndication in early 1999.\n\nThe series follows the exploits of the Washington metropolitan area–based \"judge advocates\" (i.e. uniformed lawyers) in the Department of the Navy's Office of the Judge Advocate General, who in the line of duty can prosecute and defend criminal cases under the jurisdiction of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (arising from the global presence of the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Marine Corps), conducting informal and formal investigations, advising on military operational law and other associated duties.\n\nAkin to \"Law & Order\", the plots from many episodes were often \"ripped from the headlines\" with portions of the plot either resembling or referencing recognizable aspects of actual cases or incidents, such as the USS \"Cole\" bombing (\"Act of Terror\" and \"Valor\"), the rescue of downed pilot Scott O'Grady (\"Defensive Action\"), the Cavalese cable car disaster (\"Clipped Wings\"), the USS \"Iowa\" turret explosion (\"Into the Breech\"), and the Kelly Flinn incident (\"The Court-Martial of Sandra Gilbert\").\n\nWhile not part of the mission of its real-world counterpart, some of the main characters are at times also involved, directly and indirectly, in various CIA intelligence operations, often revolving around the recurring character, CIA officer Clayton Webb (played by Steven Culp).\n\n\n\nThe creator of \"JAG\", Donald P. Bellisario, served for four years in the U.S. Marine Corps, and after having worked his way up through advertising jobs, he landed his first network television job as a story editor for the World War II-era series \"Baa Baa Black Sheep\", where he got a habit of promoting a consistent promilitary stance in a business where he got the perception that \"antiwar\" and \"antisoldier\" mentality were the commonplace. The stereotype in the post-Vietnam war era of \"crazed Vietnam veterans\" was notably subverted, by not just one, but three of the main characters, in \"Magnum P.I.\", of which Bellisario was the co-creator. \nFollowing the cancellation of his series \"Quantum Leap\", Bellisario began working on a one-shot screenplay of a murder mystery aboard a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier, where the victim was a female aviator.\n\nThe issue of whether or not to expand the options for women serving in the U.S. armed forces as fighter pilots and in other frontline assignments was a contentious social issue of the day. In 1991, a famous incident had occurred at the Tailhook Association convention in Las Vegas, where male naval aviators had behaved in manners inappropriate, if not criminal, and where the follow-up criminal and other investigations by the then-named NIS, the Naval Inspector General, and the Judge Advocate General of the Navy, were later heavily criticized by the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Defense, with the concurrence to Acting Secretary of the Navy Sean O'Keefe, to whom the report was delivered and who began to take corrective action with respect to both the perceived attitude problems towards women and the functions of the investigative arms of the Department of the Navy.\nThe fallout from the incident resulted in a hard blow to the naval aviation community, where the promotions of many naval aviators were put on hold. The common counterclaim from the other side of the aisle, as articulated by former Secretary of the Navy in the Reagan administration and naval flight officer John F. Lehman, was that the naval aviation community had been unfairly subjected to a witch-hunt motivated by political correctness, in effect killing its \"esprit de corps\", and by extension damaging its combat effectiveness. During the Clinton administration in April 1993, Secretary of Defense Les Aspin announced a new policy, which in effect made it possible to have female fighter pilots serving on aircraft carriers at sea and in other new positions (but still prohibited from serving in infantry, etc.)\n\nThus, the stage was set for the reality-based fictional drama, when Bellisario read in a newspaper about the forthcoming introduction of female fighter pilots on aircraft carriers.\n\nWhile doing research on which organizational entities would partake in investigative efforts of crimes committed aboard Naval vessels, Bellisario found the special agents of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service filled the police role, and the uniformed lawyers, in the Navy's Judge Advocate General's Corps, could alternate between the role of defense attorney, prosecutor, and field investigator. Bellisario chose to go ahead with the lawyers and remarked season six about the unique advantages it brought from a story-telling point of view: \"Unlike most law shows, I've got a detective, a prosecutor, and a defender.\"\n\nInitially, the producers of \"JAG\" did not receive any co-operation from the Department of the Navy, due to sensitivity in light of all the accumulative negative publicity that had been generated from the Tailhook scandal and its aftermath. However, the lack of co-operation from the military was not a show-stopper, as the \"JAG\" production team, by virtue of being a Paramount Pictures production, had access to the stock footage of the motion pictures owned by the studio, which included many films with military content, such as \"Top Gun\", \"The Final Countdown\", and \"The Hunt for Red October.\n\nIn 1997, though, the naval services had begun to change their minds, and began to render support to the production team on a script-by-script basis. A primetime network series about Navy lawyers bringing out controversial subjects in a very public arena was apparently no longer an issue in itself, but as noted by Commander Bob Anderson of the Navy's entertainment media liaison office in Los Angeles in a \"TV Guide\" interview: \"We're fine with that as long as the bad guys are caught and punished, and the institution of the Navy is not the bad guy\".\n\nAlmost all episodes of the series feature scenes filmed aboard real United States Navy ships. The ship most widely used was the , in commission as a training carrier at the time. Most of the \"Nimitz\"-class carriers also appear in one or several episodes. , , and were also used in the series.\n\nUSS \"Enterprise\" was used as the fictional USS \"Seahawk\" in many episodes. USS \"Forrestal\" and were also used as the fictional \"Seahawk\", both in season four and for one episode each. For scenes filmed aboard \"Enterprise\", the whole crew wore caps reading \"USS Seahawk – CVN 65\" so they matched the ship's real hull number.\n\nUSS \"Forrestal\" was featured in many episodes, most prominently two in which she portrayed the fictional USS \"Reprisal\". In these episodes, all crew members wore caps with the \"CV-35\" pennant number. This number was intentionally out of sequence with the pennant numbers of active USN carriers at the time the series was filmed. CV-35 would have been the real pennant number of an \"Essex\"-class carrier actually called \"Reprisal\", which was canceled during construction in 1945 when WWII ended, and broken up in 1949 after consideration had been given to completing her to a revised design roughly similar to that of .\n\nOnly six USN ships featured in the series were called by their real names: , , , , , and . The \"Kitty Hawk\" is mentioned in one of the season-three episodes, but never seen on screen. The \"America\" is the murder scene in a season-three episode, but shots supposedly depicting her are in fact shots of the \"Forrestal\". Real shots of the \"Roosevelt\" in harbor are used in one episode of season one.\n\nSeason-three opener \"Ghost Ship\" was filmed entirely aboard the \"Hornet\" while she was laid up at Alameda Naval Air Station before being preserved as a museum ship. Part of the storyline in \"Ghost Ship\" deals with the final fate of \"Hornet\". It implies (though not explicitly stating it) she was eventually scrapped due to severe fire damage sustained during the course of the episode, contrary to her real-life fate as a national landmark. The subplot in \"Ghost Ship\" indicating that the ship's double hull had to be cut open from the inside to repair supposed damage to her bow during Vietnam was not at all correct with her service record.\n\n\"Coral Sea\" is also featured in the season-three episode \"Vanished\" and season-four episodes \"Angels 30\" and \"Shakedown\". As she had already been scrapped at the time the episodes supposedly took place, archival footage of \"Coral Sea\" was used, with other footage shot aboard \"Forrestal\". The majority of the exterior scenes from \"Angels 30\" were filmed aboard \"Forrestal\" and a few aboard \"Enterprise\".\n\n\"Belknap\" is mentioned in the season-four episode \"Going after Francesca\" as the Sixth Fleet flagship, a role she actually fulfilled in real life from 1986 until her decommissioning in 1994. \"Belknap\" had already been decommissioned and was laid up awaiting scrapping when the episode was filmed, allowing for actual exterior shots of the ship to be featured in the episode.\n\nThe series also includes appearances by \"Tarawa\"-class amphibious assault ships, \"Ticonderoga\"-class cruisers, \"Arleigh Burke\"-class destroyers (in particular the itself during the opening credit montage), and \"Oliver Hazard Perry\"-class frigates. In one of the episodes, the Spanish frigate is used to depict a fictional USN \"Perry\"-class ship (denoted by her NATO pennant number \"F 81\" painted under the bridge, instead of the U.S. practice of having a \"number only\" ID painted on the bow).\n\nWhile most sea episodes are focused on aviation missions, several are based around submarine warfare: namely episodes 1:3, 2:6, 4:16, 5:22, 6:15, 7:14, 7:24, 8:7, 8:17, and 9:7.\n\nIn February 2005, David James Elliott announced he would leave the show at the end of the 10th season; the show was subsequently not renewed for an 11th season by the network. The show also introduced new younger characters, including former \"As the World Turns\" star Chris Beetem, and Jordana Spiro from \"The Huntress\".\n\nThe producers also considered relocating the fictional setting of the show, from Falls Church to Naval Base San Diego. An episode of the final season, \"JAG: San Diego\" had the main cast, excluding Harm, going to the San Diego naval base and working with the local JAG office there. Though it was reportedly considered as a pilot episode, as a reformat of the show aiming for a younger audience, CBS ultimately decided not to pursue a new series.\n\nNevertheless, CBS announced the cancellation of the show on April 4, 2005, after 10 seasons. The final episode, \"Fair Winds and Following Seas\", aired on April 29, 2005, and in which Harm and Mac are assigned different stations: Harm in London, Mac in San Diego. They finally confront their feelings and decide to get married. The episode ends with Bud tossing a challenge coin to decide which one would give up his or her military career to be with the other. However, in keeping with \"JAG\" tradition, the outcome of the toss is never seen, as the screen fades to black, showing only the coin, which bears the inscription \"1995 – 2005\", the years the series spanned.\n\nSeasonal rankings (based on average total viewers per episode) of \"JAG\" on NBC (first season) and CBS (other seasons).\n\nIn January 2003, CBS announced that Donald P. Bellisario was developing a \"JAG\" spin-off, around the work of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service. It was aired in April 2003 in a two-part backdoor pilot in which Commander Rabb is arrested, but later vindicated as innocent, for the murder of Lieutenant Singer. The two episodes, titled \"Ice Queen\" and \"Meltdown\", focused on the NCIS team, with most of the JAG regulars as supporting characters. Whereas the episodes of \"JAG\" are primarily oriented on a mixture of courtroom drama and military activities in the field, \"NCIS\" episodes are more focused, as the meaning of the acronym suggests, on criminal investigations. \"NCIS\" also follows a different storytelling format from \"JAG\", emphasizing character humor to a larger extent than its parent program. \"NCIS\" later produced its own spin-offs, \"\" and \"\", which shows a further departure from the styles and themes of \"JAG\".\n\nThe two episodes \"Ice Queen\" and \"Meltdown\" were edited down to a one-hour pilot film, which was then used to sell the idea of \"NCIS\" as a new series to CBS; the pilot used the title, \"NCIS – The Beginning\". It was later also used to introduce the show to CBS affiliates and advertisers. It was only broadcast once and is not available on home video.\n\nExcluding the backdoor pilot, only two major characters from \"JAG\" have appeared in the \"NCIS\" series. Patrick Labyorteaux appeared briefly as Lieutenant Bud Roberts in the \"NCIS\" first-season episode \"Hung Out to Dry\", and again - now with the rank of captain - in the season fourteen episode \"Rogue,\" advising the NCIS team on a legal issue. John M. Jackson returned in May 2013 as retired Rear Admiral A.J. Chegwidden, now a civilian attorney in the private sector hired by Director Vance to provide legal representation for Special Agent Gibbs, in the season ten \"NCIS\" finale, \"Damned If You Do\". Jackson has recurred as A.J. Chegwidden since the eighth season of \"\". Chegwidden is a Vietnam-era compatriot of series regulars Hetty Lange (Linda Hunt) and Owen Granger (Miguel Ferrer).\n\nLt. Cmdr. Faith Coleman (played by Alicia Coppola) appeared in two episodes of JAG (in 2003) and three episodes of NCIS (2004-2005).\n\nWhile several other actors who played major roles on \"JAG\" have also appeared on \"NCIS\", such as Scott Lawrence (Sturgis Turner on \"JAG\"), Steven Culp (Clayton Webb on \"JAG\"), Randy Vazquez (Victor Galindez on \"JAG\"), and Michael Bellisario (Mikey Roberts on \"JAG\"); they played completely different characters when appearing on \"NCIS\".\n\nFirst introduced in the NCIS back-door pilot, Alicia Coppola appeared as Navy judge advocate Lieutenant Commander Faith Coleman in several episodes of \"NCIS\". Adam Baldwin played the same guest role, Navy SEAL Commander Michael Rainer, in one episode of each show.\n\n\"First Monday\" was a short-lived series co-created by Bellisario and Paul Levine about fictional U.S. Supreme Court justices and their clerks, which aired in 2002 and starred James Garner and Joe Mantegna. The character of U.S. Senator Edward Sheffield (Dean Stockwell), who appeared in three episodes of that show, later became a recurring character on \"JAG\" as the new Secretary of the Navy, starting in season eight.\n\nThe sitcom \"Yes, Dear\" did an episode called \"Let's Get Jaggy With It\" where Greg's father Tom (Tim Conway) wins a walk-on role on \"JAG\". Catherine Bell guest-starred as herself while David James Elliott, Patrick Labyorteaux, and Scott Lawrence guest-starred as their respective \"JAG\" characters.\n\nOn September 1, 1998, the pilot episode of \"JAG\" was released on VHS cassette in the U.S. by Paramount Home Entertainment. However, no further episodes of the series proper were released on any home entertainment media while the show was still in production, allegedly due to syndication deals made with several broadcasters.\n\nBeginning in 2006, CBS Home Entertainment (distributed by Paramount) has released all 10 seasons on DVD in regions 1, 2 and 4. Seasons 1 to 4 are released with a 4:3 aspect ratio, while seasons 5 to 10 have a 16:9 aspect ratio. The region-2 and -4 editions do not have the bonus features (audio commentaries and retrospective interviews) included on the region-1 editions of seasons one and two.\n\nOn December 11, 2012, CBS released \"JAG: The Complete Series – Collector's Edition\" on DVD in region 1. This collection contains, other than all 227 episodes of the series and the bonus features of the previously released individual season packs, one disc with new bonus features and a booklet with production notes.\n\nOn April 14, 2015, CBS Home Entertainment released a repackaged version of the complete series set, at a lower price, in Region 1. It does not include the bonus disc that was part of the original complete series set.\n\nOn April 26, 2010, Intrada released an album of music from the series, featuring Bruce Broughton's theme and his pilot score (tracks 1–15) and weekly composer Steven Bramson's score, including Broughton's format music (the main and end title theme and commercial bumper), for the season-two episode \"Cowboys and Cossacks\" (tracks 16–28).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9593869", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9593869", "title": "James Bond in film", "text": "James Bond in film\n\nThe James Bond film series is a British series of spy films based on the fictional character of MI6 agent James Bond, \"007\", who originally appeared in a series of books by Ian Fleming. It is one of the longest continually-running film series in history, having been in on-going production from 1962 to the present (with a six-year hiatus between 1989 and 1995). In that time Eon Productions has produced 24 films, most of them at Pinewood Studios. With a combined gross of over $7 billion to date, the films produced by Eon constitute the fourth-highest-grossing film series. Six actors have portrayed 007 in the Eon series, the latest being Daniel Craig.\n\nAlbert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman co-produced most of the Eon films until 1975, when Broccoli became the sole producer. The single exception during this period was \"Thunderball\", on which Broccoli and Saltzman became executive producers while Kevin McClory produced. From 1984 Broccoli was joined by his stepson Michael G. Wilson as producer and in 1995 Broccoli stepped aside from Eon and was replaced by his daughter Barbara, who has co-produced with Wilson since. Broccoli's (and until 1975, Saltzman's) family company, Danjaq, has held ownership of the series through Eon, and maintained co-ownership with United Artists since the mid-1970s. The Eon series has seen continuity both in the main actors and in the production crews, with directors, writers, composers, production designers, and others employed through a number of films.\n\nFrom the release of \"Dr. No\" (1962) to \"For Your Eyes Only\" (1981), the films were distributed solely by United Artists. When Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer absorbed United Artists in 1981, MGM/UA Entertainment Co. was formed and distributed the films until 1995. MGM solely distributed three films from 1997 to 2002 after United Artists was retired as a mainstream studio. From 2006 to 2015, MGM and Columbia Pictures co-distributed the film series, following the 2004 acquisition of MGM by a consortium led by Columbia's parent company, Sony Pictures. In November 2010, MGM filed for bankruptcy. Following its emergence from insolvency, Columbia became co-production partner of the series with Eon. Sony's distribution rights to the franchise expired in late 2015 with the release of \"Spectre\". In 2017, MGM and Eon offered a one-film contract to co-finance and distribute the upcoming 25th film worldwide, which was reported on 25 May 2018 to have been won by Universal Pictures.\n\nIndependently of the Eon series, there have been three additional productions with the character of James Bond: an American television adaptation, \"Casino Royale\" (1954), produced by CBS; a spoof, \"Casino Royale\" (1967), produced by Charles K. Feldman; and a remake of \"Thunderball\" entitled \"Never Say Never Again\" (1983), produced by Jack Schwartzman, who had obtained the rights to the film from McClory.\n\nIn 1954 the American CBS television network paid Ian Fleming $1,000 ($ in dollars) for the rights to turn his first novel, \"Casino Royale\", into a one-hour television adventure as part of the dramatic anthology series \"Climax Mystery Theater\", which ran between October 1954 and June 1958. It was adapted for the screen by Anthony Ellis and Charles Bennett; Bennett was well known for his collaborations with Alfred Hitchcock, including \"The 39 Steps\" and \"Sabotage\". Due to the restriction of a one-hour play, the adapted version lost many of the details found in the book, although it retained its violence, particularly in Act III. The hour-long \"Casino Royale\" episode, which starred American actor Barry Nelson as Bond and Peter Lorre as the villain Le Chiffre, aired on 21 October 1954 as a live production.\n\nIn 1959 producer Albert R. \"Cubby\" Broccoli at Warwick Films expressed interest in adapting the Bond novels, but his colleague Irving Allen was unenthusiastic. In June 1961 Fleming sold a six-month option on the film rights to his published and future James Bond novels and short stories to Harry Saltzman, with the exception of \"Casino Royale\", which he had previously sold. Towards the end of Saltzman's option period, screenwriter Wolf Mankowitz introduced him to Broccoli, and Saltzman and Broccoli formed Eon Productions with the intention of making the first Bond film. A number of Hollywood studios did not want to fund the films, finding them \"too British\" or \"too blatantly sexual\". Eventually the two signed a deal with United Artists for 100% financial backing and distribution of seven films, with financing of $1 million for the first feature. Saltzman and Broccoli also created the company Danjaq, which was to hold the rights to the films which Eon Productions was to produce.\n\nEon had originally intended to film Fleming's novel \"Thunderball\" first, but Kevin McClory took Fleming to the High Court in London for breach of copyright over the book, and so Eon decided to film \"Dr. No\" first.\n\nEon asked several directors—Bryan Forbes, Guy Green, Val Guest and Guy Hamilton—to helm the film, but all declined, before Terence Young agreed. Eon had originally hired Wolf Mankowitz and Richard Maibaum to write \"Dr. No\"s screenplay, partly because of Mankowitz's help in brokering the deal between Broccoli and Saltzman. An initial draft of the screenplay was rejected because the scriptwriters had made the villain, Dr. No, a monkey, and Mankowitz left the film. Maibaum then undertook a second version, more closely in line with the novel; Johanna Harwood and Berkely Mather then worked on Maibaum's script, with Harwood in particular being described as a script doctor credited with improving the British characterisations. \n\nTo play the lead role of Bond, Sean Connery was not Broccoli or Fleming's first choice, but he was selected after Patrick McGoohan had turned down the role, and Eon had rejected Richard Johnson. After Connery was chosen, Terence Young took the actor to his tailor and hairdresser and introduced him to the high life, restaurants, casinos and women of London. In the words of Bond writer Raymond Benson, Young educated the actor \"in the ways of being dapper, witty, and above all, cool\".\n\nFilming took place on location in Jamaica between 16 January and 21 February 1962; five days later filming began at Pinewood Studios in England with sets designed by Ken Adam, who had previously worked with Broccoli on the 1960 film \"The Trials of Oscar Wilde\". Maurice Binder created the title sequence and introduced the gun barrel motif that appears in all the Eon Bond films. Monty Norman wrote the accompanying soundtrack, which included the \"James Bond Theme\", heard in the gun barrel sequence and in a calypso medley over the title credits; the theme was described by another Bond film composer, David Arnold, as \"bebop-swing vibe coupled with that vicious, dark, distorted electric guitar, definitely an instrument of rock 'n' roll ... it represented everything about the character you would want: It was cocky, swaggering, confident, dark, dangerous, suggestive, sexy, unstoppable. And he did it in two minutes\". The theme was arranged by John Barry, who was uncredited for the arrangement but credited for his performance.\n\nAfter the financial success of \"Dr. No\", United Artists doubled the budget offered to Eon Productions to $2 million for the company's next film, \"From Russia with Love\". The film was shot in Europe, which had turned out to be the more profitable market for \"Dr. No\". Most of the crew from the first film returned, with major exceptions being production designer Ken Adam—who went to work on \"Dr. Strangelove\" and was replaced by \"Dr. No\"s art director Syd Cain—and title designer Maurice Binder, who was replaced by Robert Brownjohn.\nThe original screenwriter for the film was Len Deighton, but he was replaced because of his slow progress. Two of the writers from \"Dr. No\", Richard Maibaum and Johanna Harwood, were brought in, with Maibaum being given the sole writing credit and Harwood being credited for \"adaptation\". \"From Russia with Love\" is the first Bond film in the series with John Barry as the primary soundtrack composer, although Lionel Bart wrote the title song \"From Russia with Love\", sung by Matt Monro. Principal photography began on 1 April 1963 and concluded on 23 August. Filming took place in Turkey, Pinewood Studios and Venice, with Scotland and Switzerland doubling for the Orient Express journey through Eastern Europe.\n\nWhile the previous two films had concentrated on the Caribbean and Europe, \"Goldfinger\" was chosen by Eon for the third film, with the American cinema market in mind. Because Terence Young was refused a share of the profits, he declined to direct \"Goldfinger\" and worked on \"The Amorous Adventures of Moll Flanders\" instead, although he had done some pre-production work before he left. In his place, Eon turned to Guy Hamilton to direct; he was keen to inject elements of humour into the series, have more gadgets and build bigger and more elegant sets.\n\nEon again turned to Richard Maibaum for the script, although Paul Dehn was later introduced for rewrites. After missing \"From Russia with Love\", Ken Adam returned as production designer. Adam's imagination provided the idea of gold stacked upon gold behind iron bars for the scenes in the United States Bullion Depository. Saltzman disliked the design's resemblance to a prison, but Hamilton liked it enough that it was built.\n\nRobert Brownjohn returned to develop the opening credit sequence, which featured clips of all three Bond films projected on actress Margaret Nolan's body. Its design was inspired by seeing light projecting on people's bodies as they got up and left a cinema.\nPrincipal photography on \"Goldfinger\" started on in Miami, at the Fontainebleau Hotel; the crew was small, consisting only of Hamilton, Broccoli, Adam and cinematographer Ted Moore. After five days in Florida, production moved to England. The primary location was Pinewood Studios, home to sets including a recreation of the Fontainebleau, the South American city of the pre-title sequence, and both Goldfinger's estate and factory. Ian Fleming visited the set of \"Goldfinger\" in he died in August, shortly before the film's release. The second unit filmed in Kentucky, and these shots were edited into scenes filmed at Pinewood. Principal photography then moved to Switzerland for the car chase and additional footage for Goldfinger's factory sequence. Filming wrapped on at Andermatt, after nineteen weeks of shooting.\n\nWhen writing his novels, Ian Fleming had always considered that they could be adapted for the cinema, and he approached producer Sir Alexander Korda to make a film adaptation of either \"Live and Let Die\" or \"Moonraker\". Although Korda was initially interested, he later withdrew. On 1 October 1959, it was announced that Fleming would write an original film script featuring Bond for producer Kevin McClory. Jack Whittingham also worked on the script, culminating in a screenplay entitled \"James Bond, Secret Agent\". However, Alfred Hitchcock and Richard Burton turned down roles as director and star, respectively. McClory was unable to secure the financing for the film, and the deal fell through. Fleming subsequently used the story for his novel \"Thunderball\" (1961), and McClory failed to have its publication stopped. On 19 November 1963 he took the matter to the Chancery Division of the High Court in the case of McClory v Fleming, but settled on 9 December 1963, after nine days in court. McClory gained the literary and film rights for the screenplay, while Fleming was given the rights to the novel, although it had to be recognised as being \"based on a screen treatment by Kevin McClory, Jack Whittingham and the Author\".\n\nAfter \"From Russia with Love\", Eon had considered undertaking an adaptation of either \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\" or \"Casino Royale\". They entered into negotiations with Charles K. Feldman, who held the rights to the latter, but a deal proved too difficult to achieve. Instead, Eon turned to the \"Thunderball\" novel. Although Eon had wanted to adapt the book in 1962, it had not been possible until the legal obstacles had been cleared. As a result of the settlement of the copyright infringement lawsuit brought by Kevin McClory, Eon negotiated with McClory to make \"Thunderball\". McClory received the sole producer credit on the film, while Broccoli and Saltzman took the title Executive Producer, although \"in reality all three men would essentially act as producers\". Broccoli later said of the three-way partnership that \"We didn't want anyone else to make \"Thunderball\" ... We had the feeling that if anyone else came in and made their own Bond film, it would have been bad for our series\".\n\nGuy Hamilton was asked to direct again, but declined feeling that he was \"drained of ideas ... I had nothing to contribute until I'd recharged batteries\"; Terence Young returned to direct after the hiatus of \"Goldfinger\". Richard Maibaum's original script from 1961 was used as the basis of the script, which he then re-drafted, with further revisions by John Hopkins. Principal filming began in Paris on 16 February 1965, and moved to Nassau on 22 March, before concluding at Pinewood Studios in May.\n\nWith worldwide box office earnings of $141.2 million \"Thunderball\" became the highest-grossing instalment and retained the record until it was surpassed by \"The Spy Who Loved Me\" twelve years later; adjusted for inflation it remained the most successful entry until \"Skyfall\" was released in 2012. As part of the contract with Eon, McClory received 20% of the film's profits and undertook not to produce any other films based on the \"Thunderball\" story for a period of ten years following the release of the Eon-produced version in 1965.\n\nAfter the interruption of McClory as producer, Albert Broccoli and Harry Saltzman returned to produce once again. The first four Bond films had been popular in Japan, and Eon decided to take advantage of the market by producing \"You Only Live Twice\". The film included progressive elements of Japanese culture as part of the background.\n\nLewis Gilbert was appointed director and Ken Adam returned as production designer; Adam built a volcano hideaway set for the main antagonist, Ernst Stavro Blofeld, at Pinewood for $1 millon ($ in dollars); at the time it was the biggest film set in Europe. Gilbert, Broccoli, Saltzman, Ken Adam and director of photography Freddie Young then went to Japan, spending three weeks searching for locations. While in Tokyo, the crew crossed paths with Peter R. Hunt, who was on holiday. Hunt had edited the first four Bond films, and he was invited to direct the second unit. The total budget for the film was $10.3 million ($59.9 million in 2005 dollars).\n\nInitially the screenwriter was to be Harold Jack Bloom, although he was later replaced by Roald Dahl, who had little previous screenwriting experience. \"You Only Live Twice\" was the first Bond film to jettison the plot premise of the Fleming source material, although the film retains the title, the Japanese setting, the use of Blofeld as the main villain and a Bond girl named Kissy Suzuki from the novel.\n\nFilming commenced at Pinewood on 4 July 1966 before moving out to Japan on 27 July for six weeks' filming. Local Japanese interest in the filming was high, and the crew had to contend with large crowds throughout the process. Connery, however, was somewhat resigned to the project, lacking the enthusiasm he sported for \"Thunderball\". A press conference on his arrival had been tense, \"soured by aggressive questioning of Connery's crumpled, jet-lagged appearance\". Primary and secondary photography finished in December; the special effects filming for the space scenes were undertaken between January and March 1967, prior to the film's release on 12 June.\n\nThe cinema posters for the film stated \"Sean Connery IS James Bond\", to distance the Eon-produced picture from the independent \"Casino Royale\", which had been released two months earlier. However, during the production, Connery announced that it would be his last film as Bond, leaving Broccoli to tell Alan Whicker, \"it won't be the last Bond under any circumstances—with all due respect to Sean, who I think has been certainly the best man to play this part. We will, in our own way, try to continue the Bond series for the audience because it's too important\".\n\nGeorge Lazenby was signed on to play Bond for OHMSS. Between Sean Connery giving his notice at the beginning of filming \"You Only Live Twice\" and its release, Saltzman had planned to adapt \"The Man with the Golden Gun\" in Cambodia and use Roger Moore as the next Bond, but political instability meant the location was ruled out and Moore signed up for another series of the television programme \"The Saint\". After \"You Only Live Twice\" was released in 1967, the producers once again picked the often-delayed \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\", which had previously been considered to follow both \"Goldfinger\" and then \"Thunderball\".\n\nPeter Hunt, who had worked on the five preceding films, had impressed Broccoli and Saltzman enough to earn his directorial debut as they believed his quick cutting had set the style for the series; it was also the result of a long-standing promise from Broccoli and Saltzman for the opportunity to direct. Hunt also asked for the position during the production of \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\", and he brought along with him many crew members, including cinematographer Michael Reed. Hunt was focused on putting his mark, saying, \"I wanted it to be different than any other Bond film would be. It was my film, not anyone else's\". \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\" was the last film on which Hunt worked in the series.\n\nScreenwriter Richard Maibaum, who worked on the first four Bond films, returned as script writer. Saltzman and Broccoli decided to drop the science fiction gadgets from the earlier films and focus more on plot as in \"From Russia With Love\". Peter Hunt asked Simon Raven to write some of the dialogue between Contessa Teresa \"Tracy\" di Vicenzo and Blofeld in Piz Gloria, which was to be \"sharper, better and more intellectual\"; Raven's additions included rewriting the proposal scene and having Tracy quote James Elroy Flecker. Syd Cain took over from Ken Adam as production designer as Eon decided not to have Adam's larger sets to reduce the film's budget to $7 million, from the $10.3 million it took to make \"You Only Live Twice\".\n\nPrincipal photography began in the Canton of Bern, Switzerland, on 21 October 1968, with the first scene shot being an aerial view of Bond climbing the stairs of Blofeld's mountain retreat. The scenes were shot atop the now-famous revolving restaurant Piz Gloria, located atop the Schilthorn near the village of Mürren. The location was found by production manager Hubert Fröhlich after three weeks of location scouting in France and Switzerland. The Swiss filming ended up running 56 days over schedule. In March 1969 production moved to England, with London's Pinewood Studios being used for interior shooting, and M's house being shot in Marlow, Buckinghamshire. In April the filmmakers went to Portugal, where principal photography wrapped in May. Filming finished on 23 June, two months later than planned, which was largely due to the warm Swiss winter, which had hampered shooting.\n\nMidway through production, acting on advice from his agent Ronan O'Rahilly, George Lazenby announced that he was not going to continue as Bond in future films, and he left the role before the December 1969 release of \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\".\n\nAlthough Eon secured the services of John Gavin to play the role of Bond, United Artists' chief David Picker was unhappy with this decision and instructed associate producer Stanley Sopel to broker a deal with Connery which saw the actor being paid $1.25 million ($ million in dollars) and 12.5% of the gross. Connery's salary took a significant part of the $7.2 million budget.\n\nThe producers had originally intended to have \"Diamonds Are Forever\" re-create commercially successful aspects of \"Goldfinger\", so they hired director Guy Hamilton as a result. Richard Maibaum also returned to write the script; the first draft envisaged the return of Auric Goldfinger portrayer Gert Fröbe, this time in the role of Goldfinger's twin brother. Maibaum also wrote a climax to the film that consisted of the new Goldfinger being chased across Lake Mead by the people of Las Vegas, all being co-ordinated by Bond. In the autumn of 1970 Tom Mankiewicz was hired to undertake re-writes, which included removing Goldfinger's brother and the Lake Mead finale.\n\nFilming began on 5 April 1971 with the desert near Las Vegas doubling for the South African scenes, followed by filming in the Great Basin Desert, Nevada in May for scenes in which Bond drives a moon buggy. On 7 June production moved to Pinewood Studios for filming at sets of the returning Ken Adams; his sets spread through four of Pinewood's stages. Filming also took place in London, Dover, Southampton, Amsterdam and the south of France; principal photography finished 13 August 1971.\n\nWhile filming \"Diamonds Are Forever\", \"Live and Let Die\" was chosen as the next Ian Fleming novel to be adapted because screenwriter Tom Mankiewicz thought it would be daring to use black villains, as the Black Panthers and other racial movements were active at that time. The new Bond actor selected by Eon was Roger Moore, and he tried not to imitate either his predecessor Sean Connery or his own performance as Simon Templar in \"The Saint\"; Mankiewicz adapted the screenplay to emphasise Moore's persona by giving him more comedy scenes and creating a light-hearted feel to Bond. Guy Hamilton was again chosen to direct, and Mankiewicz suggested they film in New Orleans, as he knew Hamilton was a jazz fan. Hamilton didn't want to use Mardi Gras, as \"Thunderball\" featured Junkanoo, a similar festival, so after more discussions with the writer and further scouting, he decided to use two well-known features of the city, the jazz funerals and the canals. While searching for locations in Jamaica, the crew discovered a crocodile farm owned by Ross Kananga, after passing a sign warning that \"trespassers will be eaten\". The farm was put into the script and also inspired Mankiewicz to name the film's villain after Kananga. With the rise of the popularity of Blaxploitation films in the early 1970s, it was decided to borrow elements of the genre for \"Live and Let Die\".\n\nSyd Cain returned as art director and was involved searching for locations with Guy Hamilton in March 1972. Principal photography began on 13 October 1972 in the Irish Bayou in Louisiana for a boat chase scene. On 29 November production moved to Jamaica, which doubled for the fictional island San Monique, the home of antagonist Kananga. In December, production was divided between interiors in Pinewood Studios, while a separate unit also shot in Harlem.\n\nJohn Barry, who had worked on the previous five films, was unavailable during production. Broccoli and Saltzman instead asked Paul McCartney to write the theme song. Since McCartney's salary of $15,000 (plus royalties) was high and another composer of Barry's stature could not be hired with the remainder of the music budget, George Martin, who had little experience of film scoring, was hired.\n\nThe film of \"The Man with the Golden Gun\" saw a change in location from the novel of the same name to put Bond in the Far East for the second time. After considering Beirut, where part of the film is set; Iran, where the location scouting was done but eventually discarded because of the Yom Kippur War; and the Hạ Long Bay in Vietnam, the production team chose Thailand as a primary location, following a suggestion of production designer Peter Murton after he saw pictures of the Phuket bay in a magazine. Saltzman was happy with the choice of the Far East for the setting as he had always wanted to go on location in Thailand and Hong Kong. During the reconnaissance of locations in Hong Kong, Broccoli saw the partially submerged wreckage of the former and came up with the idea of using it as the base for MI6's Far East operations.\n\nTom Mankiewicz wrote a first draft for the script in 1973, delivering a script that was a battle of wills between Bond and the primary villain Francisco Scaramanga, whom he saw as Bond's alter ego, \"a super-villain of the stature of Bond himself\". Tensions between Mankiewicz and Guy Hamilton led to Richard Maibaum taking over scripting duties. Maibaum, who had worked on six Bond films previously, delivered his own draft based on Mankiewicz's work. Broccoli's stepson Michael G. Wilson researched solar power to create the MacGuffin of the \"Solex Agitator\". While \"Live and Let Die\" had borrowed heavily from the blaxploitation genre, \"The Man with the Golden Gun\" borrowed from the martial arts genre that was popular in the 1970s.\n\nOn 6 November 1973 filming commenced at the RMS \"Queen Elizabeth\", which acted as a top-secret MI6 base grounded in Victoria Harbour in Hong Kong. The major part of principal photography started in April 1974 in Thailand. Thai locations included Bangkok, Thonburi, Phuket and the nearby Phang Nga Province, on the islands of Ko Khao Phing Kan () and Ko Tapu (). In late April production returned to Hong Kong and also shot in Macau. Production had to move to studio work in Pinewood Studios—which included sets such as Scaramanga's solar energy plant and island interior.\n\nJohn Barry returned to compose the score, but had only three weeks to complete the work, and the theme tune and score are generally considered by critics to be among the weakest of Barry's contributions to the series—an opinion shared by Barry himself: \"It's the one I hate most ... it just never happened for me\".\n\nFollowing \"The Man with the Golden Gun\", producer Harry Saltzman sold his 50% stake in Eon Productions' parent company, Danjaq, to United Artists to alleviate his financial problems, brought about by financial constraints following a downturn in the fortunes of Technicolor, in which he had invested heavily. The resulting legalities over the Bond property delayed production of the next Bond film, \"The Spy Who Loved Me\".\n\nGuy Hamilton was initially scheduled to follow on from \"The Man with the Golden Gun\" with \"The Spy Who Loved Me\", but instead turned down Eon Productions during pre-production after being offered the opportunity to direct the 1978 film \"Superman\", although he was ultimately passed up for Richard Donner. Eon then turned to Lewis Gilbert, who had directed the earlier Bond film \"You Only Live Twice\". Broccoli commissioned a number of writers to work on the script, including Stirling Silliphant, John Landis, Ronald Hardy, Anthony Burgess and Derek Marlowe, but Richard Maibaum drew up the first draft script, with some inclusions from the previous writers. When Lewis Gilbert was hired to direct, he brought with him Christopher Wood to revise Maibaum's draft. The draft Wood prepared was challenged in court by Kevin McClory, who alleged infringement based on the use of what he claimed were his rights in SPECTRE and the Blofeld character. Eon disputed McClory's claim but had Wood remove the organisation and character from the script.\n\nKen Adam returned as production designer. As no studio stages were big enough for the interior of the villain Karl Stromberg's supertanker, in March 1976 construction began of a new sound stage at Pinewood, the 007 Stage, which cost $1.8 million and became the largest stage in the world. In contrast to the volcano crater set Adam had built for \"You Only Live Twice\" in 1966—which Adam had called \"a workable but ultimately wasteful set\"—the 007 Stage would be a permanent structure that could be rented out to other productions. Secondary filming began in July 1976 at Baffin Island, where the ski jump for the opening credits was filmed. Principal filming commenced in Sardinia in August 1976, moving on to Egypt shortly afterwards. Further filming took place in Sardinia, Malta, Japan, Switzerland and the Faslane submarine base. On 5 December 1976, with principal photography finished, the 007 Stage was formally opened by the former Prime Minister Harold Wilson.\n\nJohn Barry could not work in the United Kingdom due to tax problems and suggested Marvin Hamlisch to score the film. Hamlisch composed \"Nobody Does It Better\" as the theme song; the score and the song were both nominated for Academy and Golden Globe Awards.\n\nEon Productions had originally planned to follow \"The Spy Who Loved Me\" with an adaptation of \"For Your Eyes Only\", although this plan changed within weeks of the 1977 release, following the box office success of the 1977 space-themed film \"Star Wars\". With a budget of $34 million \"Moonraker\" cost more than double any of the previous Bond films, although both Broccoli and United Artists agreed to the costs because of the profits from \"The Spy Who Loved Me\".\n\nLewis Gilbert was again appointed as director, and a number of the crew from \"The Spy Who Loved Me\" also joined the production. Gilbert and Tom Mankiewicz wrote the initial story, but Christopher Wood turned this into the final screenplay. Many of the script ideas came about as a result of location scouting, with Iguazu Falls being identified as a filming location while Broccoli was in Brazil for the release of \"The Spy Who Loved Me\".\n\nUnlike previous Bond films, the production of \"Moonraker\" was not based at Pinewood, as Broccoli moved it to Paris for financial reasons, although the scenes for the cable car interiors and space battle exteriors were filmed at Pinewood, with the special effects team of Derek Meddings active in the UK throughout production. Principal photography began on 11 August 1978 in Paris. The sets designed by returning production designer Ken Adam were the largest ever constructed in France and required more than 222,000 man-hours to construct (approximately 1,000 hours by each of the crew on average). Much of the film was shot in the cities of London, Paris, Venice, Palmdale, California, Port St. Lucie, Florida and Rio de Janeiro. Principal filming finished back in Paris on 27 February 1979, a 28-week schedule that had allowed Roger Moore only three days off. John Barry was again asked to score an Eon film.\n\n\"For Your Eyes Only\" marked a change in the production crew: John Glen was promoted from his duties as a film editor to director, a position he would occupy for the next four films. Since Ken Adam was busy with the film \"Pennies from Heaven\", Peter Lamont, who had worked in the art department since \"Goldfinger\", was promoted to production designer. Following a suggestion from Glen, Lamont created realistic sets, instead of the elaborate scenery for which the series had been known.\n\nRichard Maibaum was once again the scriptwriter for the story, assisted by Michael G. Wilson. According to Wilson, the ideas could have come from anyone as a committee that could include Broccoli, Maibaum, Wilson, Glen and stunt coordinators worked on the outlines. Much of the inspiration for the stories for the film came from two Fleming short stories from the collection \"For Your Eyes Only\": \"Risico\" and \"For Your Eyes Only\". Another set-piece from the novel of \"Live and Let Die\"—the keelhauling—which was unused in that novel's adaptation, was inserted into the plot.\n\nProduction of \"For Your Eyes Only\" began on 2 September 1980 in the North Sea, with three days shooting exterior scenes for the scenes involving the \"St Georges\" spyboat. The interiors were shot later in Pinewood Studios, as well as the ship's explosion, which was done with a miniature in Pinewood's tank on the 007 Stage. On 15 September principal photography started in Corfu at the Villa Sylva at Kanoni, above Corfu Town, which acted as the location of the Spanish villa.\n\nIn October filming moved to other Greek locations, including Meteora and the Achilleion. In November the main unit moved to England, which included interior work in Pinewood, while the second unit shot underwater scenes in the Bahamas. On 1 January 1981 production moved to Cortina d'Ampezzo in Italy, where filming wrapped in February. Many of the underwater scenes, especially involving close-ups of Bond and Melina, were shot on a dry soundstage. A combination of lighting effects, slow-motion photography, wind, and bubbles added in post-production, gave the illusion of the actors being underwater. The pre-credits sequence used a church in Stoke Poges as a cemetery, while scenes involving a helicopter were filmed at the abandoned Beckton Gas Works in London.\n\nThe score of \"For Your Eyes Only\" was written by Bill Conti, who retained a number of John Barry-influenced brass elements in the score but also added elements of dance and funk music.\n\nIn 1980 United Artists, which had provided much of the funding for the Bond films, fell into financial difficulties following the box office failure of \"Heaven's Gate\" (1980), bringing uncertainty to the future of the funding. The situation was resolved in May 1981, when Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer acquired United Artists.\n\nFollowing \"For Your Eyes Only\", Roger Moore had expressed a desire to stop playing James Bond. His original contract had been for three films, a requirement fulfilled with \"The Spy Who Loved Me\". Subsequent films had been negotiated on a film-by-film basis. The producers engaged in a semi-public quest for the next actor to play Bond, which would be for \"Octopussy\". However, when Kevin McClory announced his re-working of \"Thunderball\" as \"Never Say Never Again\", the producers re-contracted Moore in the belief that an established actor in the role would fare better against McClory's choice of Bond, Sean Connery. Before \"For Your Eyes Only\" had been released, Albert Broccoli had asked John Glen to return and direct \"Octopussy\". George MacDonald Fraser wrote an initial treatment that was extensively revised by Michael G. Wilson and Richard Maibaum.\n\nFirst unit filming began on 10 August 1982 at the Berlin Wall crossing point Checkpoint Charlie, although the second unit had already been at work for a few weeks, filming scenes for a mid-air fight sequence. The Monsoon Palace served as the exterior of villain Kamal Khan's palace, while scenes set at the palace of titular character Octopussy were filmed at the Lake Palace and Jag Mandir. Bond's hotel was the Shiv Niwas Palace. In England RAF Northolt, RAF Upper Heyford and RAF Oakley were the main locations. Scenes set at the Karl-Marx-Stadt railways scenes were shot at the Nene Valley Railway, while studio work was undertaken at Pinewood Studios and 007 Stage. Filming finished on 21 January 1983. John Barry returned to score, having passed on \"For Your Eyes Only\" for tax reasons. While Barry wrote the title song, \"All Time High\", Tim Rice wrote the lyrics and the song was performed by Rita Coolidge.\n\n\"Octopussy\" had its premiere on 6 June 1983, four months before the October release of \"Never Say Never Again\". From its budget of $27.5 million, \"Octopussy\" took $183.7 million at the box office, a figure which saw it surpass the takings of its Connery-led rival, which took $160 million.\n\nIn 1984 Michael G. Wilson joined Albert R. Broccoli as co-producer at Eon. Wilson had first worked on a Bond production in February 1964 with the filming of \"Goldfinger\". He had worked on every production since \"The Spy Who Loved Me\", and had been executive producer on \"Moonraker\", \"For Your Eyes Only\" and \"Octopussy\".\n\nThe day before the UK premiere of the non-Eon rival Bond film, \"Never Say Never Again\", Eon announced that Roger Moore would return as Bond for the seventh time. John Glen also returned as director, while Peter Lamont and John Barry also signed up as they had for \"Octopussy\". Michael G. Wilson co-wrote the screenplay with Richard Maibaum.\n\nOn 27 June 1984 the 007 Stage was almost entirely destroyed by fire. It was rebuilt in time for production and reopened in January 1985, when it was renamed the \"Albert Broccoli 007 Stage\". The second unit started filming in Iceland in July 1984, while principal photography with Moore commenced on 1 August at Pinewood. Also in August, the second unit filmed in Paris, including scenes involving a parachute jump from the Eiffel Tower.\n\nThe Amberley Museum & Heritage Centre doubled as the exterior of villain Max Zorin's mine, while the scenes in the complex under Zorin's stables were filmed in a Renault plant in Swindon, before primary filming moved to San Francisco. Filming finished in January 1985 at the 007 Stage, with the filming of the interior of Zorin's mine, designed by Peter Lamont.\n\nWith the retirement of Roger Moore following \"A View to a Kill\", the producers searched for a new Bond and eventually cast Timothy Dalton in the lead role in August 1986. Much of the senior production crew from the previous film worked on \"The Living Daylights\", with John Glen directing, John Barry providing the score and Peter Lamont acting as production designer. Michael G. Wilson and Richard Maibaum again provided the script and initially proposed a prequel, showing Bond's first mission, although this was turned down by Broccoli. Script work continued while the producers searched for Moore's successor.\n\nThe film was shot at the 007 Stage at Pinewood Studios, with principal photography starting on 29 September 1986, before moving to Vienna on 5 October, where the crew filmed for two weeks. Meanwhile, the second unit had started work on the pre-credits sequence on Gibraltar on 17 September before moving to Morocco. Filming finished on 13 February 1987.\n\n\"The Living Daylights\" was the twelfth and final Bond film to be scored by composer John Barry. The title song of the film, \"The Living Daylights\", was co-written with Paul Waaktaar-Savoy of the Norwegian pop-music group A-ha and recorded by them. The group and Barry did not collaborate well, resulting in two versions of the theme song.\n\nThe production costs of \"The Living Daylights\" were $40 million, and the film posted box office results of $191.2 million.\n\nShortly after the release of \"The Living Daylights\", producers Albert R. Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson and writer Richard Maibaum started discussing its successor. They decided that the film would retain a realistic style, as well as showing the \"darker edge\" of the Bond character. For the primary location, the producers wanted a place where the series had not yet visited. While China was visited after an invitation by its government, the idea fell through partly because the 1987 film \"The Last Emperor\" had removed some of the novelty from filming in China. By this stage the writers had already talked about a chase sequence along the Great Wall, as well as a fight scene amongst the Terracotta Army. Wilson also wrote two plot outlines about a drug lord in the Golden Triangle before the plans fell through. The writers eventually decided on a setting in a tropical country while Broccoli negotiated to film in Mexico, at the Estudios Churubusco in Mexico City. In 1985 the Films Act was passed, removing the Eady Levy, which resulted in foreign artists being taxed more heavily. The associated rising costs to Eon Productions meant no part of \"Licence to Kill\" was filmed in the UK, the first Bond film not to do so. Pinewood Studios, used in every \"Bond\" film that far, housed only the post-production and sound re-recording.\n\nThe initial outline of what would become \"Licence to Kill\" was drawn up by Wilson and Maibaum. Before the pair could develop the script, the Writers Guild of America (WGA) went on strike and Maibaum was unable to continue writing, leaving Wilson to work on the script on his own. The script—initially called \"Licence Revoked\"—was written with Dalton's characterisation of Bond in mind; the obsession with which Bond pursues the drug lord villain Franz Sanchez on behalf of Bond's friend, the CIA/DEA agent Felix Leiter and his dead wife is seen as being because of Bond's own \"brutally cut-short marriage\".\n\nJohn Glen returned once again to direct, teaming up once more with production designer Peter Lamont. Principal photography ran from 18 July to 18 November 1988. Shooting began in Mexico, which mostly doubled for the fictional Republic of Isthmus. Other underwater sequences were shot at the Isla Mujeres near Cancún. In August 1988 production moved to the Florida Keys, notably Key West. Seven Mile Bridge towards Pigeon Key was used for the sequence in which the armoured truck transporting Sanchez following his arrest is driven off the edge. Other locations there included the Ernest Hemingway House, Key West International Airport, Mallory Square, St. Mary's Star of the Sea Church for Leiter's wedding and Stephano's House 707 South Street for his house and patio. The US Coast Guard Pier was used to film Isthmus City harbour.\n\nJohn Barry was not available to score the film because of throat surgery, so the soundtrack's score was composed and conducted by Michael Kamen, who was known for scoring many action films at the time, such as \"Lethal Weapon\" and \"Die Hard\". The film's darker and more violent plot elicited calls for cuts by the British Board of Film Classification.\n\n\"Licence to Kill\" marked the end of the involvement for a number of long-term crew members, including John Glen, Maurice Binder, Richard Maibaum and cinematographer Alec Mills. It was also the final film which was produced by the partnership of Albert Broccoli and Michael Wilson.\n\nThe relatively disappointing box office returns for \"Licence to Kill\" led to Albert Broccoli questioning his own leadership of the series, and he put Danjaq, holders of the Bond film copyright, up for sale. Timothy Dalton was quoted at the time as saying \"My feeling is this will be the last one. I don't mean my last one, I mean the end of the whole lot. I don't speak with any real authority, but it's sort of a feeling I have\".\n\nIn 1990 the situation was further complicated when MGM/UA was sold to Qintex, which wanted to then merge with Pathé Communications; the Bond back catalogue was leased to Pathé at a lower-than-market value, without consulting Danjaq – who sued MGM/UA Communications, which was itself the target of a failed takeover bid by Pathé. In August 1990 Albert Broccoli appointed his daughter Barbara Broccoli alongside Michael G. Wilson as producers at Eon, while he concentrated on matters at Danjaq. The dispute between Danjaq and MGM/UA was protracted and delayed production of Bond 17, but was finally settled in 1993.\n\nThe new producers changed the policy of behind-the-scenes continuity prevalent in the series up to that point and, from the 1990s onwards, there were more changes in key production roles, including employing directors \"on a 'guest director' footing\".\n\nDespite the legal action, pre-production towards Bond 17 still progressed, with some early details unveiled at the Cannes Film Festival which took place in May 1990. However, delays occurred because of the ongoing legal action with MGM/UA and, in an August 1993 interview, Dalton revealed that Michael France was involved in writing a script for the next Bond film, with Anthony Hopkins as a potential villain, adding that Hopkins had been in discussions with Eon for a number of weeks. Dalton also stated that the earliest production could begin would be in January or February 1994. Dalton's six-year contract expired in 1993, and after reading France's script for what would become \"GoldenEye\", he announced on 12 April 1994 that he would not be returning to play Bond; he was replaced by Pierce Brosnan. After Michael France delivered the original screenplay, Jeffrey Caine was brought in to rework much of the material. Kevin Wade was also brought into the process before Bruce Feirstein gave the final polish to the script.\n\nWith Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson as co-producers, Albert Broccoli oversaw the production of \"GoldenEye\" as consulting producer but is credited as \"presenter\". John Woo was approached to direct the film, but he turned down the opportunity, saying he was honoured by the offer. The producers then chose Martin Campbell to lead the film.\n\nPrincipal photography started on 16 January 1995 and continued until 6 June. The producers were unable to use Pinewood Studios, the usual location for Bond films, because it had been reserved for \"First Knight\", so an old Rolls-Royce factory at the Leavesden Aerodrome in Hertfordshire was converted into a new studio. In February the crew moved to Monaco and Monte Carlo for scenes in a casino and a demonstration of a Tiger helicopter. The pre-credits sequence involved a bungee jump, which was filmed at the Contra Dam near Locarno, Switzerland. Reference footage for a scene consisting of a tank chase was shot on location in St. Petersburg and matched to sets built at the Leavesden studio by production designer Peter Lamont. Scenes on a satellite dish were shot at Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, while in the UK, Epsom Downs Racecourse and the Nene Valley Railway were both used. For the scenes of the fictional Russian location of Severnaya, and other effects, Derek Meddings built a number of miniature sets at Leavesden. Meddings had worked on the Bond films since \"Live and Let Die\" and died before the film's release; \"GoldenEye\" was dedicated to his memory.\n\nThe soundtrack to \"GoldenEye\" was composed and performed by Éric Serra. Prolific Bond composer John Barry turned down an offer by Barbara Broccoli to score the film. The theme song, \"GoldenEye\", was written by Bono and The Edge, and was performed by Tina Turner. As Serra did not collaborate with Bono or The Edge, orchestral versions of the song did not appear throughout \"GoldenEye\", as had been the case in previous James Bond films.\n\nBefore \"GoldenEye\" had been released in November 1995, MGM/UA started their preparations for Bond 18, intending for a release in early December 1997, leaving Eon Productions little time for pre-production. The producers were unable to convince Martin Campbell to return; his agent said that \"Martin just didn't want to do two Bond films in a row\". Instead, Roger Spottiswoode was chosen in September 1996. With Peter Lamont unavailable because he was committed to \"Titanic\", Spottiswoode chose Allan Cameron in his place to provide sets; Spottiswoode and Cameron had previously worked together on \"Air America\".\n\nThe story was based on a previously discarded treatment by Donald E. Westlake, which had been written before \"GoldenEye\". The script was given a re-working by Bruce Feirstein, based on the return of Hong Kong to the Chinese. Feirstein's script was then contributed to by Nicholas Meyer before being reworked by Dan Petrie Jr. and David Campbell Wilson before Feirstein, who retained the sole writing credit, was brought in for a final polish. The script was finished a week before principal photography started, although Feirstein had to re-write sequences throughout production. The process was further hampered by poor relations between Feirstein and Spottiswoode.\n\nWith the Leavesden studios unavailable, and Pinewood not having sufficient capacity, Eon converted an abandoned grocery warehouse in Hertfordshire into a filming location. With the principal crew about to fly to location in Vietnam, the Vietnamese authorities revoked permission to film at the last minute, and alternative locations were quickly found in Thailand.\n\nSecond unit filming began on 18 January 1997 with Vic Armstrong directing; they filmed the pre-credits sequence at Peyresourde Airport in the French Pyrenees, before moving on to Portsmouth to film the scenes where the Royal Navy prepares to engage the Chinese.\nThe main unit began filming on 1 April 1997 at the new studios, before filming at other UK locations; production then moved to Thailand in May. Filming completed three weeks over schedule in September 1997. Eon initially approached John Barry to score the film, but the two sides could not come to terms; the producers then approached David Arnold, whom Barry endorsed.\n\nThe delays in the production process and the rush to deliver the film by the MGM/UA-imposed deadline of December 1997 drove the costs upwards to $110 million, although the film recouped $338.9 million at the box office.\n\nJoe Dante and then Peter Jackson were considered as directors for \"The World Is Not Enough\". Barbara Broccoli enjoyed Jackson's \"Heavenly Creatures\", and a screening of \"The Frighteners\" was arranged for her. She disliked the latter film, however, and showed no further interest in Jackson. Michael Apted was then selected to lead the film. Writers Neal Purvis and Robert Wade were hired after their work in \"Plunkett & Macleane\", before Michael Apted and his wife, screenwriter Dana Stevens, undertook an uncredited rewrite. Pierce Brosnan was unhappy with some of Stevens' changes to his character, so Michael G. Wilson—who was also uncredited as screenwriter—and Bruce Feirstein undertook further revisions.\n\nProduction was centred at Pinewood Studios and principal photography began there on 11 January 1999 with scenes from inside the MI6 offices, designed by Peter Lamont. The pre-title sequence was shot in Bilbao, Spain, in February, with production moving to Chamonix, France, which doubled for the Caucasus scenes. The exterior of a Kazakh nuclear facility was shot at the Bardenas Reales, in Navarre, Spain, while the exterior of an oil refinery control centre was doubled by the Motorola building in Groundwell, Swindon. The exterior of the oil pipeline was filmed in Cwm Dyli, Snowdonia, Wales, while the production teams shot the oil pipeline explosion in Hankley Common, Elstead, Surrey. The production also visited Istanbul, Turkey; the scenes of villain Elektra King's Baku villa were filmed in the city, and the famous Maiden's Tower was used for the hideout of the second villain Renard. The underwater submarine scenes were filmed in the Bahamas.\n\nDavid Arnold returned to score the music for \"The World Is Not Enough\"—the second Bond soundtrack he composed; Garbage sang the title song. For his work on the film, Arnold won an Ivor Novello Award.\n\nLee Tamahori was hired to direct \"Die Another Day\"; Barbara Broccoli admired his film \"Once Were Warriors\", calling it \"a phenomenal piece of filmmaking\". Broccoli noted that she and Wilson \"sensed his genuine enthusiasm for Bond. It was simply great chemistry. Lee was the right guy and we were very, very lucky to get him\". Screenwriters Neal Purvis and Robert Wade returned and began work in the summer of 2000 with the producers. They used a premise from Fleming's novel \"Moonraker\" as a basis, that of an industrialist villain who had two identities. With the planned release of the film being in the 40th anniversary year of the Bond film series, Tamahori named the Hong Kong hotel seen in the film the \"Rubyeon Royale\", for Eon's ruby anniversary, as well as Fleming's first novel, \"Casino Royale\".\n\nSecond unit filming started on Christmas Day 2001 with Laird Hamilton, Dave Kalama and Darrick Doerner performing the surfing scene at the surf break known as Jaws in Peahi, Maui; the shore shots were later taken near Cádiz, Spain and Newquay, Cornwall. Principal photography of \"Die Another Day\" began on 11 January 2002 at Pinewood studios. The film was shot primarily in the United Kingdom, Iceland, and Cádiz. Filming in the UK took place at the Eden Project, the Reform Club and Pinewood Studios' 007 Stage, with the sets by production designer Peter Lamont, which included the ice palace. During June seven separate units were filming, including underwater, aerial and miniature; principal photography finished on 9 July, in time for the premiere in London on 20 November 2002.\n\nThe soundtrack was composed by David Arnold, while the title song \"Die Another Day\" was written and performed by Madonna, who also had a cameo appearance in the film as a fencing instructor. \"Die Another Day\" had a budget of $142 million and earned $431.9 million at the box office.\n\nIn 1999 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer obtained the rights to the 1967 film \"Casino Royale\" from Sony Pictures Entertainment for $10 million in the out-of-court settlement of a lawsuit. The case was brought by MGM after Sony had announced a deal with Kevin McClory to produce a third version of the \"Thunderball\" novel, for which McClory held the film rights. McClory had previously acted as producer with Eon on \"Thunderball\" and had licensed his rights for the production of \"Never Say Never Again\" in 1983. In 2004, following severe financial troubles, MGM was itself acquired by a consortium backed by Sony for $5 billion.\n\n\"Casino Royale\" reboots the series, establishing a new timeline and narrative framework not meant to precede or succeed any previous \"Bond\" film. Barbara Broccoli stated that \"For years, my father wanted to make \"Casino Royale\"—it's the Holy Grail ... We wanted to make a tougher film, the way it should have been made years ago\". Fellow producer Michael G. Wilson agreed, commenting \"We felt the last film was too fantastical, so we decided to go back to the basics and update\". Neal Purvis and Robert Wade began writing a screenplay at the end of February 2004, while Pierce Brosnan was still Bond. Paul Haggis was brought in later, and his main contribution included rewriting the climax of the film. He explained that \"the draft that was there was very faithful to the book and there was a confession, so in the original draft the character confessed and killed herself. She then sent Bond to chase after the villains; Bond chased the villains into the house. I don't know why but I thought that Vesper [Lynd] had to be in the sinking house and Bond has to want to kill her and then try and save her\". In February 2005 Martin Campbell was announced as the film's director and the next Bond film was revealed to be \"Casino Royale\", although the identity of the new Bond was still unknown; the producers had chosen not to renew Pierce Brosnan's contract, and in October Eon announced that the part of Bond would be taken by Daniel Craig.\n\nPrincipal photography for \"Casino Royale\" commenced on 3 January 2006. The film was primarily shot at Barrandov Studios in Prague, with additional location shooting in the Bahamas, Italy and the United Kingdom. The shoot concluded at Pinewood Studios on 20 July 2006. In the Bahamas filming took place at Paradise Island and Albany House, an estate owned by golfers Ernie Els and Tiger Woods. Footage set in Mbale, Uganda, was filmed at Black Park, a Country Park in Buckinghamshire, with further UK location shooting taking place at the Dunsfold Aerodrome in Surrey and the Millbrook Vehicle Proving Ground in Bedfordshire.\n\nFor many of the effects in the film, Special Effects and Miniature Effects Supervisor Chris Corbould used a more realistic style of film making and significantly reduced digital effects compared with previous Bond films. Corbould noted that, \"CGI is a great tool and can be very useful, but I will fight to the tooth and nail to do something for real. It's the best way to go\". Corbould used the 007 stage at Pinewood for the sinking of the Venetian house at the climax of the film, which featured the largest rig ever built for a Bond film. \"Casino Royale\" featured music composed by David Arnold, his fourth soundtrack for the Bond film series. Producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli announced on 26 July 2006 that Chris Cornell would perform the title song, entitled \"You Know My Name\", which he co-wrote with Arnold.\n\nIn July 2006, as \"Casino Royale\" entered post-production, Eon Productions announced that the next film would be based on an original idea by producer Michael G. Wilson. In June 2007 Marc Forster was confirmed as director. He was surprised that he was approached for the job, stating he was not a big Bond film fan through the years, and that he would not have accepted the project had he not seen \"Casino Royale\" prior to making his decision: he felt Bond had been humanised in that film, arguing that because travelling the world had become less exotic since the series' advent, it made sense to focus more on Bond as a character. Forster found \"Casino Royale\"s 144-minute running time too long, and wanted his follow-up to be \"tight and fast ... like a bullet\".\n\nNeal Purvis and Robert Wade returned as screenwriters and completed a draft of the script by April 2007; Paul Haggis also worked on the script, completing it two hours before the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike officially began. Further work on the script had to be undertaken by Forster and Daniel Craig, who said later, \"We had the bare bones of a script and then there was a writers' strike and there was nothing we could do. We couldn't employ a writer to finish it. I say to myself, 'Never again', but who knows? There was me trying to rewrite scenes – and a writer I am not\". Craig also admitted that the film was not initially meant to be a sequel, but it became one because of the re-writes undertaken by him and Forster. Haggis located his draft's climax in the Swiss Alps, but Forster wanted the action sequences to allude to the four classical elements of earth, water, air and fire. Michael G. Wilson decided on the film's title \"Quantum of Solace\" only \"a few days\" before its announcement on 24 January 2008. Forster hired Dennis Gassner as production designer, replacing Peter Lamont.\n\n\"Quantum of Solace\" was shot in six countries, including Italy (Talamone and Siena), Chile (the Paranal Observatory), Austria (Bregenz), Mexico, Panama and the UK. In the UK interior and exterior airport scenes were filmed at Farnborough Airfield and the snowy closing scenes were filmed at the Bruneval Barracks in Aldershot, as well as ten stages at Pinewood and two theatres for ADR work. David Arnold, who composed the scores for the previous four Bond films, returned for \"Quantum of Solace\". He said that Forster likes to work very closely with his composers and that, in comparison to the accelerated schedule he was tied to on \"Casino Royale\", the intention was to spend a long time scoring the film to \"really work it out\". He also said he would be \"taking a different approach\" with the score. Jack White of The White Stripes and Alicia Keys collaborated on \"Another Way to Die\", the first Bond music duet.\n\nThe production of \"Skyfall\" was suspended throughout 2010 because of MGM's financial troubles. Eon resumed pre-production following MGM's exit from bankruptcy on 21 December 2010 and in January 2011 the film was given official approval, with production scheduled to start in late 2011. The film's budget is estimated to be between $150 million and $200 million, compared to the $200 million spent on \"Quantum of Solace\".\n\n\"Skyfall\" was directed by Sam Mendes, who first signed on to the project shortly after \"Quantum of Solace\" was released, and remained on board as a consultant during the period of uncertainty surrounding MGM's financial situation. Speculation in the media suggested that Mendes had commissioned rewrites of the script to \"[remove] action scenes in favour of 'characterful performances'\", with the intention of bidding for an Academy Award. Mendes denied the reports, stating that the film's planned action scenes were an important part of the overall film.\n\nThe script was written by Bond screenwriting regulars Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, as well as John Logan. Roger Deakins signed on as cinematographer, while Dennis Gassner returned as production designer. Thomas Newman, who worked with Sam Mendes as composer for \"American Beauty\", \"Road to Perdition\", \"Jarhead\" and \"Revolutionary Road\", replaced David Arnold as composer; British singer-songwriter Adele co-wrote and recorded the film's theme song with her regular songwriter, Paul Epworth.\n\nPrincipal photography was scheduled to take 133 days and began on 7 November 2011 in and around London. Production moved to Turkey in April 2012, with parts of Istanbul—including the Spice Bazaar, Yeni Camii, the Main Post Office, Sultanahmet Square and the Grand Bazaar—closed for filming in April. Filming also took place in Shanghai. Although set in Scotland, Bond's family home of Skyfall was constructed on Hankley Common in Surrey using plywood and plaster to build a full-scale model of the building, with some exterior scenes shot in Glen Etive and Glencoe.\n\nIn September 2012 it was announced that Daniel Craig had signed to the role of Bond for the following two films, the first of which was \"Spectre\", funded by MGM and Sony. In March 2013 Mendes announced he would not return to direct the next film in the series, although he later decided to return. In July 2013 it was revealed that John Logan would also return as writer, while in October 2014 it was announced that Léa Seydoux would play a Bond girl in the film. Filming started in December 2014 and the film was released into cinemas on 26 October 2015.\n\nThe twenty-fifth film in the Eon series entered development in early-2016. In October 2016, Craig stated that he may indeed return for another film, saying, \"As far as I'm concerned, I've got the best job in the world. I'll keep doing it as long as I still get a kick out of it. If I were to stop doing it, I would miss it terribly.\" Sony Pictures' contract to co-produce the series with MGM and Eon expired with the release of \"Spectre\" and the distribution rights to theatrically release the upcoming film were up for negotiation, until Eon and MGM reached the new partnership with Universal Pictures. As part of the agreement, Universal will handle the international and home video distribution, while MGM retains the theatrical, digital, and television rights in the United States. MGM will co-release the film with Annapurna Pictures.\n\nIn March 2017, Neal Purvis and Robert Wade were hired as co-screenwriters. By August of the same year, Daniel Craig was officially announced to be reprising the role, for one final movie in his contract. In March 2018, Danny Boyle signed on as director, from an original story co-written with John Hodge. However by late-August of the same year, Boyle stepped down as director and co-writer, due to creative differences. Hodge later followed and left the project for similar reasons. \n\nIn search for a new director, the studio was reportedly considering Christopher McQuarrie, Jean-Marc Vallée, Edgar Wright, David Mackenzie, S. J. Clarkson, Bart Layton, and Yann Demange. The studio will use the script by Purvis and Wade, with production using the working title \"Shatterhand\". Production was initially scheduled to begin on 3 December 2018 with a 25 October 2019 release date. In September 2018, Cary Joji Fukunaga was announced as the film's director, the first American-born director of the series. Production is now scheduled to begin on 4 March 2019 at Pinewood Studios for a 14 February 2020 release.\n\nIn March 1955 Ian Fleming sold the film rights of his novel \"Casino Royale\" to producer Gregory Ratoff for $6,000 ($ in dollars). In 1956 Ratoff set up a production company with Michael Garrison to produce \"Casino Royale\"; Ratoff died in December 1960. After Ratoff's death, producer Charles K. Feldman represented Ratoff's widow and obtained the rights to film.\n\nProduction on \"Casino Royale\" was troubled and chaotic, with five different directors being credited for helming different segments of the film: Ken Hughes, John Huston, Joseph McGrath, Robert Parrish and Val Guest. In addition, stunt director Richard Talmadge was uncredited as co-director of the final sequence. Ben Hecht was originally commissioned by Feldman as writer, and he provided a serious interpretation of Fleming's source novel, before it was decided to turn the film into a comedy. Three main screenwriters then worked on the project—Wolf Mankowitz, John Law and Michael Sayers—and a further nine people provided uncredited additional material. Problems arose on set between Peter Sellers and director Joseph McGrath and between Sellers and Orson Welles. Sellers eventually demanded that he and Welles should not share the same set. Sellers left the film before his part was complete. A further agent's part was then written for Terence Cooper, to cover Sellers' departure, while re-writes, additional filming and post-production cutting compensated for the missing actor. Principal photography started on 11 January 1966 and was scheduled to take up to 26 weeks. Because of the delays and chaotic nature of the filming process, it finally finished ten months later in November.\n\nFeldman asked Burt Bacharach and Hal David to provide the music for the film; David worked for a few months completing his part, while Bacharach took nearly two years. The pair produced the song \"The Look of Love\", which was sung by Dusty Springfield. Columbia Pictures approved a production budget of $6 million for the film, although this rose to $12 million at the end of production. The film performed well, with box office returns of $41.7 million.\n\n\"Never Say Never Again\" had its origins in the early 1960s following the controversy over the 1961 \"Thunderball\" novel, which led to Kevin McClory becoming producer of the Eon Productions film of the same name. Part of the agreement between McClory and Eon was that McClory would not make any further version of the novel for a period of ten years following the release of the 1965 \"Thunderball\".\n\nIn the mid-1970s McClory again started working on a project to bring a \"Thunderball\" adaptation to production and, with the working title \"Warhead\" (a.k.a. \"James Bond of the Secret Service\") he brought writer Len Deighton together with Sean Connery to work on a script. The script ran into difficulties after accusations from Eon Productions that the project had gone beyond copyright restrictions, which confined McClory to a film based on the \"Thunderball\" novel only, and once again the project was deferred. Towards the end of the 1970s developments were reported on the project under the name \"James Bond of the Secret Service\", but then producer Jack Schwartzman became involved and cleared a number of the legal issues that still surrounded the project and licensed the rights from McClory.\n\nWith Connery still committed to the project, producer Jack Schwartzman asked him to play Bond: Connery accepted, asking for and receiving a fee of $3 million ($ million in dollars), a percentage of the profits, as well as casting, script and director approval. Schwartzman then brought on board scriptwriter Lorenzo Semple Jr. to work on the screenplay. Connery was unhappy with some aspects of the work and asked British television writers Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais to undertake re-writes, although they went uncredited for their efforts because of a restriction by the Writers Guild of America.\n\nThe former Eon Productions editor and director of \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\", Peter Hunt, was approached to direct the film but declined due to his previous work with Eon. Irvin Kershner, who had achieved success in 1980 with \"The Empire Strikes Back\", was then hired. A number of the crew from the 1981 film \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" were also appointed, including first assistant director David Tomblin; director of photography Douglas Slocombe and production designers Philip Harrison and Stephen Grimes.\n\nFilming for \"Never Say Never Again\" began on 27 September 1982 on the French Riviera for two months before moving to Nassau, the Bahamas in mid-November where filming took place at Clifton Pier, which was also one of the locations used in \"Thunderball\". The Spanish city of Almería was also used as a location. Villain Maximillian Largo's Palmyran fortress was actually historic Fort Carré in Antibes. Principal photography finished at Elstree Studios where interior shots were filmed. Elstree also housed the \"Tears of Allah\" underwater cavern, which took three months to construct. Most of the filming was completed in the spring of 1983, although there was some additional shooting during the summer of 1983.\n\nProduction on the film was troubled with Connery taking on many of the production duties with assistant director David Tomblin. Director Irvin Kershner was critical of producer Jack Schwartzman, saying that whilst he was a good businessman \"he didn't have the experience of a film producer\". After the production ran out of money, Schwartzman had to fund further production out of his own pocket and later admitted he had underestimated the amount the film would cost to make.\n\nThe music for \"Never Say Never Again\" was written by Michel Legrand. Legrand also wrote the main theme \"Never Say Never Again\", which featured lyrics by Alan and Marilyn Bergman—who had also worked with Legrand in the Academy Award-winning song \"The Windmills of Your Mind\"—and was performed by Lani Hall.\n\nFleming's estate, financially backed by Eon Productions and MGM, made a final attempt to block the film in the High Courts in London in the spring of 1983, but this was thrown out by the court and \"Never Say Never Again\" was permitted to proceed. When \"Never Say Never Again\" was released, it grossed $9.72 million ($ million in dollars) on its first weekend, which was reported to be \"the best opening record of any \"James Bond\" film\" up to that point and surpassing \"Octopussy\"s $8.9 million ($ million in dollars) from June that year. From its budget of $36 million, \"Never Say Never Again\" grossed $160 million.\n\nMcClory attempted to produce another \"Thunderball\" adaptation as \"Warhead 2000 AD\" following the success of \"GoldenEye\" in 1995.

{"id": "2293849", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2293849", "title": "Lara (comics)", "text": "Lara (comics)\n\nLara (née Lara Lor-Van) is a fictional character who appears in Superman comics published by DC Comics. Lara is the biological mother of Superman, and the wife of scientist Jor-El. Lara Lor-Van is Lara's full maiden name, as \"Lor-Van\" is the name of Lara's father. Most depictions of Kryptonian culture show that Kryptonian women use their father's full name as their last names before marriage. After marriage, they usually are known simply by their first names, though various versions show they use their husband's full name or last name as their married last name.\n\nLara's role in the Superman mythos has varied over the years, with her treatment and emphasis often depending on the decade she was written in. Golden Age and early Silver Age stories treated Lara in a lesser role compared to her husband. However, stories from the 1970s onwards depict Lara in more prominent roles; one such example is the 2004 miniseries \".\"\n\nAfter constructing his Fortress of Solitude, Superman honored his deceased biological parents with a statue of Jor-El and Lara holding up a globe of their native planet Krypton.\n\nLara first appeared in the \"Superman\" comic strip and was created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster.\n\nLara first appeared in the \"Superman\" newspaper comic strip in 1939, where she was first named \"Lora.\" Her first comic book appearance (after being mentioned in the 1942 text novel \"The Adventures of Superman\" by George Lowther, where she was named \"Lara\" for the first time) was in \"More Fun Comics\" #101 in January–February 1945. A 1948 retelling of Superman's origin story subsequently delved into detail about Lara, though her more familiar Silver Age aspects became more firmly established starting in the late 1950s and over the course of the next several decades.\n\nAfter the establishment of DC's multiverse in the early 1960s, the Golden Age version of Superman's mother was stated as having been named \"Lora\", and lived on the Krypton of the Earth-Two universe. The Silver Age Lara, meanwhile, lived on the Krypton of the Earth-One universe.\n\nA definitive synopsis of the Silver Age Lara's life (summarizing the various stories revealing her history) came in the 1979 miniseries \"The World of Krypton\" (not to be confused with the post-\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" late 1980s comic special of the same name).\n\nAs summarized in \"The World of Krypton\" (and in various other stories), Lara was a promising astronaut in Krypton's space program. However, Krypton's space program was soon permanently grounded after Jax-Ur blew up one of Krypton's inhabited moons. Eventually, Lara met scientist Jor-El, with the two having several adventures together before getting married, such as a time-traveling Lois Lane attempting to seduce Jor-El after failing to marry their son in the future. Some time later, Lara gave birth to the couple's only child, Kal-El.\n\nEarly in Jor-El and Lara's marriage, the couple are briefly watched by the Guardians of the Universe, who note that Lara (or her husband) would have made an excellent Green Lantern.\n\nLara and her husband Jor-El were shown to be practitioners of the Kryptonian martial art of \"klurkor\".\n\nWhen Krypton was about to explode, Lara and Jor-El placed their infant son into an escape rocket built by Jor-El. In most retellings, Jor-El wanted Lara to accompany their son to Earth, but Lara refused, saying their son would have a better chance of reaching Earth without her extra weight. Kal-El's spaceship then took off, leaving Lara and Jor-El to perish.\n\nAfter the 1985-1986 miniseries \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" and John Byrne's 1986 miniseries \"The Man of Steel\" rewrote Superman's origins, details about Lara's background and character were changed. Under Byrne's version, Lara inhabited a cold, emotionally sterile Krypton where even bodily contact was forbidden. Lara's grandmother, Lady Nara, and Seyg-El, Jor-El's father, were the ones who arranged the union between them – so that they might have a child who would fill an opening in the planet's Register of Citizens when another Kryptonian died a rare and untimely death. Jor-El, however, was considered a \"throwback\" for actually expressing emotions toward his wife Lara, and for his favoring the less sterilized days of past Kryptonian eras. In this version of the mythos, Lara was a librarian and historian of high rank and thought it horrifying that Kal-El would be sent to a \"primitive\" planet such as Earth. In one story, the adult Kal (now Superman) is transported to the past and encounters his parents moments before Krypton's destruction. Lara is disgusted by what she sees and tells Kal not to approach her, finding him \"repellent\", even as she is ashamed of her feelings. \n\nIn the 2004 Superman miniseries \"\", Lara, along with Krypton and Jor-El, more or less again became their Silver Age versions, though with updated touches. In this version, Lara is treated as a fully equal partner to Jor-El in constructing Kal-El's spacecraft and in designing various key components.\n\nIn the 2009 series \"\" by Geoff Johns, Superman is first introduced to his birth mother in his teens by the spaceship that brought him to the Earth as a baby. She is introduced to Kal-El by a hologram of Jor-El as his mother. This moment shocks Superman and brings tears to Martha Kent's eyes.\n\nAlso in 2009, Lara's own family background is described. Lara Lor-Van is born into the Labor Guild, whose members are not physically abused but have no say in the choices of their lives and who, unlike the members of other guilds, cannot change guilds. Lara became a member of her husband's Science Guild when she married him and was thereby granted all the freedoms granted to other Science Guild members. A member of Krypton's Military Guild describes this as being \"raised up.\"\n\nIn September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Lara is a member of Krypton's military forces. One of the most talented students on the Military Academy, Lara is both a skilled fighter and a bright scientist.\n\nLara appears in the \"Krypton Returns\" storyline. She gives her maiden name as \"Lara Van-El.\"\n\nIn Frank Miller's mini-series \"\" (also referred to as DK2), Lara is the name of the daughter of Superman and Wonder Woman, with the powers of a Kryptonian and the warrior attitude of an Amazon. She has a poor opinion of people less powerful than herself and tries to persuade her father to rise above the \"humans\" and maybe even take over the world. He himself is torn between this and his adopted parent's view that he should use his powers to help rather than to dominate. Ultimately, he rejects the former option and reconciles with Batman.\n\nIn Art Baltazar's \"Superman Family Adventures\", Lara survived Krypton's destruction by escaping into the Phantom Zone. She is eventually freed by her son and accepted into the Superman family. Though Jor-El didn't make it out, Superman uses a specific crystal that allows him to resurrect Jor-El for 24 hours that would allow the two to spend more time with each other. When the family tries to stop Brainiac, the villain stops his assault and moves Kandor when he discovers that Lara is pregnant, telling the group that their family isn't complete yet. Lara gives birth in Baltazar's \"Super Powers\" book, where her time in the Phantom Zone has altered the baby's DNA to look like Brainiac.\n\nIn the \"Elseworlds\" series \"\", Jor-El was able to save himself and Lara and accompany Kal-El to Earth, where Jor-El sets up the corporation JorCorp while Lara establishes the self-help movement 'Raology'. More open to adapting on Earth, she arranges for Kal-El to be discreetly adopted by the Kents so that he can live a more normal life, and later has twin children, Bru-El and Valora, whose 'stunted' genetics due to their birth on Earth mean that they only possess half of the superhuman potential of their brother. While attending a dinner in Gotham, Lara is able to save Thomas and Martha Wayne when she intercepts Joe Chill's attempted mugging, thus unknowingly preventing the creation of Batman, Jor-El's own actions further hindering the opportunity for mankind to develop its own heroes in the belief that his family are enough. Lara eventually rejects Jor-El's desire to 'micromanage' humanity out of fear of Earth being destroyed as Krypton was, relocating to her own estate of 'Lara-Land', where she uses red sun emitters to restrict her natural abilities and simply encourages spiritual growth while using Kryptonian technology to heal injuries. However, the manipulation of Lex Luthor allows him to turn her son, Bru-El, into a kryptonite-powered superhuman who nearly kills Jor-El before Lara takes the blast herself, this attack also infecting her with a secret virus that kills her after a few days of exposure.\n\nLara has appeared (usually briefly) in various media adaptations of the Superman story. However, as was the case in the older comics, Lara usually has a less prominent role than Jor-El in such depictions.\n\nAgnes Moorehead portrayed Lara in the debut episode of the radio serial \"The Adventures of Superman\" on February 12, 1940. She reprised the role in a few later episodes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranberg, Charles (2005). \"I Love the Illusion: The Life And Career of Agnes Moorehead\". Albany, Georgia, BearManor Media. .\n\n"}

She was entered into the Guinness World Records as the \"lightest recorded adult\", weighing at the age of 17. According to an 1894 article in \"Strand Magazine\", Zarate achieved her full growth by the age of one year. Her family home, Casa Grande (\"Big House\") is open to the public as a museum.\n\nAt the age of twelve, Zarate moved from her native Mexico to the United States, where she was exhibited for her small stature. An 1876 book published by Oxford University discussed a visit to Zarate paid by several medical professionals, who could not certainly verify that she was twelve, but could ascertain through her dental development that she was at least six. At the time, her height was measured at 20 inches (51 centimeters) tall and her calf was measured as in circumference, more than the thumb of an average adult man. She was with her parents at the time and found to be healthy and intelligent, able to speak some English along with her native Spanish.\n\nShe first worked as part of an act billed as the \"Fairy Sisters\", later partnering with Francis Joseph Flynn (billed under the stage name \"General Mite\") to exhibit internationally. In 1889 she was billed in \"The Washington Post\" as the \"marvelous Mexican midget\" and described as \"a tiny but all powerful magnet to draw the public.\" After her circus train became stranded in the snowy Sierra Nevada mountains, Zarate died of hypothermia in 1890.\n\n\nLink states her birth was around the year 1870, that she was only 6 years old when she started her career, not 12.\n"}

However, the actual design of the British bricks and the other elements of the Minibrix system are thought to have been the work of a Mr Gilbert, an ITS engineer, and patents for the product were applied for on 5 July 1935 in the names of the Premo Rubber Company and Arnold Levy.\n\nTwo series of kits were available in different styles for making Tudor and Modern buildings, and the bases, roofs and lintels were all, like the bricks, made of rubber.\n\n\n"}

This legal transition of copyright works into the public domain usually happens every year on 1 January based on the individual copyright laws of each country.\n\nThe observance of a \"Public Domain Day\" was initially informal; the earliest known mention was in 2004 by Wallace McLean (a Canadian public domain activist), with support for the idea echoed by Lawrence Lessig. Several websites list the authors whose works are entering the public domain each January 1. There are activities in countries around the world by various organizations all under the banner Public Domain Day.\n\nCopyright protection terms are typically described as the life of the author plus a certain number of years after his or her death (or \"pma: post mortem auctoris\"). In many jurisdictions, this usually means that 70 years have passed since the day of author's death. After that period, the works of those authors become fully available so that everyone - without any need for prior authorization - can access and use them for any purpose whatsoever. Legally, this happens on New Year's Day (January 1). That means that in those countries, the works of authors who died, anywhere in the world, in 1936, passed into public domain on 1 January 2007.\n\nSince public domain rights vary based on jurisdiction, the passage of a work into the public domain is not worldwide. The most noticeable exception is the United States, where no additional published works will enter the public domain automatically until 2019. Australia copyright scheme is even more restrictive, with no Public Domain Day possible until 2026. Most of Europe will witness various works passing into the public domain, as will Canada and New Zealand. Many more works would be entering the public domain if not for the copyright extension that has occurred several times in the past several decades.\n\nPublic Domain Day in 2010 celebrated the entry to the public domain in many countries of the works of authors such as Sigmund Freud, William Butler Yeats, Ford Madox Ford and Arthur Rackham. In 2011 it celebrated the public domain status of Isaac Babel, Walter Benjamin, John Buchan, Mikhail Bulgakov, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Emma Goldman, Paul Klee, Selma Lagerlof, Leon Trotsky, Vito Volterra, Nathanael West, and others.\n\nIt is not clear when Public Domain Day started to be observed (it was mentioned by Lawrence Lessig in 2004) but in recent years it has been mentioned by Project Gutenberg and has been promoted by Creative Commons. Public Domain Day events have been hosted on various dates in Poland, Germany, Switzerland, Italy and Israel.\n\nIn January 2011, to celebrate Public Domain Day 2011, Open Knowledge Foundation launched \"The Public Domain Review\", a web-based review of works which have entered the public domain.\n\nIn January 2012, a celebration was announced in Warsaw, Poland and for the first time in Krakow), where for several years on that day various activities have been organized by free culture NGOs (such as Koalicja Otwartej Edukacji and Open Society Institute) and other supporters.

The theorem aims to justify a puzzling aspect of mixed strategy Nash equilibria: that each player is wholly indifferent amongst each of the actions he puts non-zero weight on, yet he mixes them so as to make every other player also indifferent.\n\nThe mixed strategy equilibria are explained as being the limit of pure strategy equilibria for a disturbed game of incomplete information in which the payoffs of each player are known to themselves but not their opponents. The idea is that the predicted mixed strategy of the original game emerge as ever improving approximations of a game that is not observed by the theorist who designed the original, idealized game.\n\nThe apparently mixed nature of the strategy is actually just the result of each player playing a pure strategy with threshold values that depend on the ex-ante distribution over the continuum of payoffs that a player can have. As that continuum shrinks to zero, the players strategies converge to the predicted Nash equilibria of the original, unperturbed, complete information game.\n\nThe result is also an important aspect of modern day inquiries in evolutionary game theory where the perturbed values are interpreted as distributions over types of players randomly paired in a population to play games.\n\nConsider the Hawk–Dove game shown here. The game has two pure strategy equilibria (Defect, Cooperate) and (Cooperate, Defect). It also has a mixed equilibrium in which each player plays Cooperate with probability 2/3.\n\nSuppose that each player \"i\" bears an extra cost \"a\" from playing Cooperate, which is uniformly distributed on [−\"A\", \"A\"]. Players only know their own value of this cost. So this is a game of incomplete information which we can solve using Bayesian Nash equilibrium. The probability that \"a\" ≤\n. If player 2 Cooperates when , then player 1's expected utility from Cooperating is ; his expected utility from Defecting is . He should therefore himself Cooperate when . Seeking a symmetric equilibrium where both players cooperate if , we solve this for \nNow we have worked out \"a*\", we can calculate the probability of each player playing Cooperate as\n\nAs \"A\" → 0, this approaches 2/3 – the same probability as in the mixed strategy in the complete information game.\n\nThus, we can think of the mixed strategy equilibrium as the outcome of pure strategies followed by players who have a small amount of private information about their payoffs.\n\nHarsanyi's proof involves the strong assumption that the perturbations for each player are independent of the other players. However, further refinements to make the theorem more general have been attempted.\n\nThe main result of the theorem is that all the mixed strategy equilibria of a given game can be purified using the same sequence of perturbed games. However, in addition to independence of the perturbations, it relies on the set of payoffs for this sequence of games being of full measure. There are games, of a pathological nature, for which this condition fails to hold.\n\nThe main problem with these games falls into one of two categories: (1) various mixed strategies of the game are purified by different sequences of perturbed games and (2) some mixed strategies of the game involve weakly dominated strategies. No mixed strategy involving a weakly dominated strategy can be purified using this method because if there is ever any non-negative probability that the opponent will play a strategy for which the weakly dominated strategy is not a best response, then one will never wish to play the weakly dominated strategy. Hence, the limit fails to hold because it involves a discontinuity.\n"}

Roger Ebert argues that, by using this structure as well as a false revenge, \"Irréversible\" cannot be classified as an exploitation film, as no exploitation of the subject matter takes place.\n\nThe genre has attracted critical attention. Much of this critical attention comes from feminist critics examining the complex politics involved in the genre and its impact on cinema more generally. More recently, a broad analysis of the rape-revenge genre and concept was published in \"Rape-Revenge Films: A Critical Study\", by Alexandra Heller-Nicholas. The book argues against a simplistic notion of the term 'rape-revenge' and suggests a film-specific approach in order to avoid generalizing films which may \"diverge not over the treatment of sexual assault as much as they do in regard to the morality of the revenge act.\"\n\nIn addition to American and French films, rape/revenge films have been made in Japan (e.g., Takashi Ishii's \"Freeze Me\"), Finland, Russia (\"The Voroshilov Sharpshooter\"), Argentina (e.g., \"I'll Never Die Alone\"; [2008]; original title: \"No Moriré Sola\"), and Norway (e.g., \"The Whore\" [2009]; original title: \"Hora\").\n\n"}

O'Brien makes his acting debut in a scene described as \"truly violent, patently disgusting and darkly humorous\". It is the second film in the \"Sharktopus\" franchise.\n\nSometime after the events of the first film, Lorena Christmas discovers an egg sac containing a baby sharktopus in the ocean.

The pteracuda, controlled with a computer chip in its brain, is secretly hacked by one of the scientists at Symodyne, Vladimir Futon to terrorize populated areas.

The sharktopus makes news headlines as Symes realizes that the original sharktopus had babies.\n\nSymes, and Hamilton force Munoz to give sharktopus to them so they can use it to kill pteracuda, much to Lorena's anger. Symes, and Hamilton proceed to release sharktopus into the ocean so it can fight pteracuda. Sharktopus, and pteracuda kill a few people at diving at a shipwreck before they begin to fight. Meanwhile, Munoz locks Lorena in a closet to keep her quiet, although she manages to break out, and calls her lifeguard boyfriend Rick Hoffman, telling him to evacuate the beach. However, the sharktopus, and pteracuda arrive, and kill a few people, including Conan O'Brien. In the meantime, Symes, and Hamilton discover that Futon hacked into pteracuda's system.

The pteracuda crashes a plane, and kills everybody on board, including the couple that Smith showed the sharktopus to earlier.\n\nHaving been paid a ton of money by Symes, and Hamilton to keep quiet about sharktopus, Munoz closes the park for good. The sharktopus, and pteracuda kill several more people at the beach before continuing their fight. Symes, and Hamilton kidnap Lorena to force her to help them kill the creatures. Lorena realizes that she read one of Symes' papers back in college. Lorena then escapes Symes, and Hamilton after seeing Rick pull in an injured woman on the beach. Pteracuda attacks more people on the beach, and Rick goes on a jetski to warn people, only to be decapitated by pteracuda. Symes, and Hamilton kidnap Lorena again, and the three trace sharktopus' location to a series of nearby canals that are near the aquarium.\n\nSymes discovers that Futon is attempting to cause a meltdown at a nearby nuclear power plant using pteracuda. He, Lorena, and Hamilton then attempt to drive to the hotel to stop Futon. At the aquarium, sharktopus arrives, and kills several people, including Munoz. Lorena, Symes, and Hamilton arrive at the hotel, and take Futon hostage, and find out he's working for a foreign terrorist group. It is revealed on a news report that only Symes is wanted by the government for questioning. Futon takes control of Symes' gun, and leaves with his computer, although he is shot by Hamilton in his escape, and the group leaves him to be eaten by pteracuda while Symes stops the pteracuda's coded course to the power plant.\n\nWhen the group attempts to drive away, they are attacked by pteracuda, and Symes forces Lorena, and Hamilton out of the car with the computer, leaving them for dead. Lorena, and Hamilton manage to evade pteracuda, as it, and the sharktopus begin to fight again. Hamilton then drives off in another car with the computer, intending to kill the creatures himself, and Lorena returns home. The next day, Hamilton confronts Symes, holding him at gunpoint, and forcing him onto a rowboat with the computer. Symes is ripped in half by sharktopus, and pteracuda while Hamilton returns to help Lorena.\n\nLorena realizes that the pteracuda must eat constantly in order to survive, and she, and Hamilton create a plan to kill both creatures. Using a disco ball to lure in pteracuda, sharktopus also arrives subsequently, and the two creatures begin to fight once more. Hamilton shoots the pteracuda with a harpoon that breaches its computer chip, causing it to overload, and explode, killing both creatures. As Lorena, and Hamilton leave, the sharktopus grabs onto their boat, and lunges at the camera, leaving their fates unknown.\n\nCate de Pablo as scuba diver\n\nThe film was followed by a third film called \"Sharktopus vs. Whalewolf\", which aired on July 19, 2015 on Syfy.\n\nNo US DVDs have been made, but there are some DVDs made in Regions 2, 3 and 4, which are available online.\n"}

{"id": "4130245", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4130245", "title": "South by Southwest", "text": "South by Southwest\n\nSouth by Southwest (abbreviated as SXSW and colloquially referred to as South By) is an annual conglomerate of film, interactive media, and music festivals and conferences that take place in mid-March in Austin, Texas, United States. It began in 1987, and has continued to grow in both scope and size every year. In 2017, the conference lasted for 10 days with SXSW interactive lasting for five days, music for seven days and film running concurrently for nine days. Comedy and gaming components to the festival are particularly fast-growing.\n\nSXSW is run by the company SXSW, LLC which organizes conferences, trade shows, festivals, and other events. In addition to the three main South by Southwest festivals, the company runs other conferences: SXSW EDU, a conference on educational innovation, held in Austin, and (beginning in 2017) the me Convention, held in Frankfurt, Germany, in collaboration with Mercedes-Benz. Former conferences run by the SXSW organization were SXSW Eco, an environmental conference held in Austin from 2011 to 2016; and one in Las Vegas: SXSW V2V, a conference focused on innovative startups which ran from 2013 to 2015.\n\nSXSW Music is the largest music festival of its kind in the world, with more than 2,000 acts as of 2014. SXSW Music offers artist-provided music and video samples of featured artists at each festival via their official YouTube channel.\n\nThe music event has grown from 700 registrants in 1987 to over 28,000 registrants. SXSW Film and SXSW Interactive events have grown every year, most recently bringing over 51,000 registrants to Austin every March.\n\nBands must cover their own expenses for travel and lodging at the event. All performers are offered a cash payment or a wristband package that allows access to all music events.\n\nSXSW Film Conference spans five days of conference panels and sessions, and welcomes filmmakers of all levels. Programming consists of keynote speakers, panels, workshops, mentor sessions and more, with expert filmmakers and industry leaders.\n\nIn 2015, the SXSW Film Conference programmed over 250 sessions with 735 speakers. Past notable speakers include Jon Favreau, Mark Duplass, Ava DuVernay, Ryan Gosling, Nicolas Cage, Alejandro Jodorowsky, Tilda Swinton, Amy Schumer, Sally Field, Joss Whedon, Christine Vachon, RZA, Matthew McConaughey, Danny Boyle, Seth MacFarlane, Catherine Hardwicke, Richard Linklater, David Gordon Green, Harmony Korine, Henry Rollins, Sarah Green and Robert Rodriguez.\nAlthough the film festival often highlights independently produced films and emerging directing talent with unique visions, the festival has long served studios as a starting point for their comedies, using enthusiastic fans as a barometer of how they might play in wide release.\n\nThe SXSW Film Festival runs nine days, simultaneously with the SXSW Film Conference, and celebrates raw innovation and emerging talent both behind and in front of the camera. Festival programming categories include: Special Events, Headliners, Narrative Spotlight, Documentary Spotlight, Narrative Competition, Documentary Competition, Visions, Midnighters, 24 Beats Per Second, SXGlobal, Episodic, Festival Favorites and Short Film Programs. The SXSW Film Awards, which occur on the last day of the Film Conference, honor films selected by the Feature and Short Film Juries.\n\nIn 2015, the SXSW Film Festival programmed 150 feature films and 106 short films, selected from 7,361 submissions. Past notable world premieres include \"Furious 7\", \"Neighbors\", \"Chef\", \"21 Jump Street\", \"The Cabin in the Woods\", \"Bridesmaids\" and \"Insidious\", and the TV series \"Girls\", \"Silicon Valley\" and \"Penny Dreadful\".\n\nSXSW Interactive is focused on emerging technology, a focus which has earned the festival a reputation as a breeding ground for new ideas and creative technologies. The festival includes a trade show, speakers, parties, and a startup accelerator. According to a festival organizer Louis Black, SXSW Interactive \"has probably been the biggest of its kind in the world\" since 2007.\n\nIn July 1986, the organizers of the New York City music festival New Music Seminar contacted Roland Swenson, a staffer at the alternative weekly \"The Austin Chronicle\", about organizing an extension of that festival into Austin after having announced that they were going to hold a \"New Music Seminar Southwest\". The plans did not materialize, so Swenson decided to instead co-organize a local music festival, with the help of two other people at the \"Chronicle\": editor and co-founder Louis Black, and publisher Nick Barbaro. Louis Meyers, a booking agent and musician, was also brought on board. Black came up with the name, as a play on the name of the Alfred Hitchcock film \"North by Northwest\". The event was first held in March 1987. The organizers considered it a regional event and expected around 150 attendees to show up, but over 700 came, and according to Black \"it was national almost immediately.\"\n\nMeyers left Austin and the festival in the early 1990s, but Black, Barbaro and Swenson remained the festival's key organizers as of 2010.\n\nSinger-songwriter Michelle Shocked was the keynote speaker at the 1992 South by Southwest. She caused controversy by delivering a speech, written by her then-husband Bart Bull, criticizing white musicians for stealing music from African American artists; and then later during the same conference when she tried to kick the band Two Nice Girls off of a benefit concert, a move that some called anti-gay, due to Two Nice Girls' overtly lesbian image.\n\nIn 1993, SXSW moved into the Austin Convention Center, where it is still held.\n\nIn 1994, SXSW added a component for film and other media, named the \"SXSW Film and Multimedia Conference\". Johnny Cash was the keynote speaker.\n\nThat year, the three brothers of the band Hanson were brought to SXSW by their father in order to perform impromptu auditions for music executives, in the hopes of getting industry attention. Among the people who heard them was A&R executive Christopher Sabec, who became their manager, and would soon afterward get them signed to Mercury Records.\n\nIn 1995, the SXSW Film and Multimedia Conference was split into two separate events, \"SXSW Film\" and \"SXSW Multimedia\".\n\nIn 1999, SXSW Multimedia was renamed \"SXSW Interactive\".\n\nSinger-songwriter John Mayer's performance at the 2000 SXSW Music festival led to his signing soon thereafter with Aware Records, his first record label.\n\nA performance by the band The Polyphonic Spree at the 2002 SXSW Music festival helped bring them to national attention before they had signed with a major label.\n\nAt the 2002 SXSW Film Festival, the film \"Manito\" won the jury award for narrative feature, while the documentary \"Spellbound\" won the jury award for documentary feature.\n\nBritish singer James Blunt was discovered by producer Linda Perry while playing a small show at the 2004 SXSW Music festival, and was signed to Perry's Custard Records soon thereafter, where he would go on to release all three of his subsequent albums.\n\nThe 2005 SXSW Film is considered by some to be the origin of the mumblecore film genre. A number of films now classified as mumblecore, including \"The Puffy Chair\", \"Kissing on the Mouth\", \"Four Eyed Monsters\" and \"Mutual Appreciation\", were screened, and Eric Masunaga, a musician and the sound editor on \"Mutual Appreciation\", is credited with coining the term \"mumblecore\" at a bar while at the festival.\n\nThe film \"Hooligans\" won both the Feature Film Jury Award and the Feature Film Audience Award for narrative feature, while \"The Puffy Chair\" won the Feature Film Audience Award in the \"Emerging Visions\" category. The documentary film \"Cowboy del Amor\" won the SXSW Competition Award and the Audience Award.\n\nA secret concert at the 2006 SXSW Music by the band The Flaming Lips was called one of the \"Top 10 Music-Festival Moments\" of all time by \"Time\" magazine in 2010.\n\nThe 2006 SXSW Interactive featured a keynote panel of Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales and Craigslist founder Craig Newmark.\n\nThat year, \"Screenburn at SXSW\", a component for video games, was added to SXSW Interactive.\n\nThe 2007 music festival took place from March 14 to 18, and more than 1,400 acts performed.\n\nTwo of the top film premieres that year were \"Elvis and Anabelle\" and \"Skills Like This\".\n\nThe social media platform Twitter notably gained a good deal of early traction and buzz at the 2007 SXSW Interactive, though it did not launch at SXSW 2007 as is sometimes reported.\n\nThe 2008 SXSW Interactive got media attention due to a keynote interview of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg by technology journalist Sarah Lacy that was considered by some observers to be a \"train wreck\" due to an audience perception that Lacy was asking uninteresting questions, as well as mocking or terse answers in response from Zuckerberg.\n\nIn 2008, a comedy element was added to SXSW; it was held for one night. (By 2012, comedy performances occurred on all nights of the festival.)\n\nThe 2009 festival was held March 13–22. The Interactive section of SXSW in particular drew larger attendance levels; the influx strained the networks of providers such as AT&T (primarily due to heavy iPhone usage). Also new was the founding of an international organization for those not attending, dubbed NotAtSXSW. Coordinating through Twitter and other online tools, notatsxsw events were held in London, New York, Wisconsin, Portland, Oregon and Miami.\nThe 2009 SXSW Interactive saw the launch of the Foursquare application, which was called \"the breakout mobile app\" of the event by the \"Mashable\" blog.\n\nThe 2009 SXSW Film screened 250 films, including 54 world premieres. The event was notable for having the United States premiere of the film \"The Hurt Locker\", which went on to win the Academy Award for Best Picture in 2010. The winners of the feature jury awards were, for documentary feature, \"45365\", and for narrative feature, \"Made in China\".\n\nThe 2010 music festival, which took place March 12–21, was dedicated to Alex Chilton, who died shortly before he was to perform with Big Star. A tribute concert was performed in his honor on March 20, 2010.\n\nAt the 2010 festival, nearly 2,000 bands were officially scheduled to perform, and festival reps estimated that over 13,000 industry representatives attended. Though traditionally the Austin Music Awards kick off the festival, that year organizers slated it as the closing act. Local musician Bob Schneider earned 6 awards, including Song of the Year, Singer of the Year, and Band of the Year (with Lonelyland.) The 2010 festival was also notable for appearances by the surviving members of the band Moby Grape.\n\nAt the 2010 Film festival, Magnolia Pictures bought the film rights to the science-fiction film \"Monsters\" on the night it screened, in what was the first-ever \"overnight acquisition\" at SXSW. Journalist Meredith Melnick of \"Time\" magazine called this purchase a turning point for SXSW, leading to a greater interest among film studio executives in attending the festival in person. That year also saw the premiere of the indie favorite \"Tiny Furniture\", which won the award for Best Narrative Feature.\n\nThe 2010 Interactive festival had an estimated 12–13,000 paying attendees, which represented a 40% jump over the previous year. This was the first year in which the interactive festival's attendance surpassed the music festival's. The keynote presentation was an interview of then-Twitter CEO Evan Williams by Umair Haque, an interview that many in the audience found disappointingly superficial. Also during the interactive festival, the first-ever (and so far only) \"Hive Awards For the Unsung Heroes of the Internet\" were held.\n\nThe 2011 SXSW festival ran from March 11 to 20.\n\nThe keynote presenter for SXSW Interactive was Seth Priebatsch, founder and CEO of the mobile-gaming platform SCVNGR. The 2011 Interactive festival was by far the largest it had ever been, with an estimated 20,000 attendees.\n\nAlso in attendance at SXSW was boxing legend Mike Tyson, promoting his new iPhone game with RockLive at the Screenburn Arcade.\n\nAt least two films screened at the SXSW Film festival gained distribution deals: the documentary \"Undefeated\" (which went on to win the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature) and the thriller \"The Divide\". As a result, film critic Christopher Kelly wrote that in 2011, SXSW Film went from being \"a well-regarded but fundamentally regional event\" to having \"joined the big leagues of film festivals around the world.\" That festival was also notable for having the premiere of the film \"Bridesmaids\".\n\nThe March 15th screening of the Foo Fighters documentary \"Back and Forth\" was followed by a surprise live performance by the band itself, with a setlist that included the entirety of the then-upcoming album \"Wasting Light\".\n\nSXSW 2012 ran from March 9 to 18.\n\nThe standout technology of the 2012 SXSW Interactive was generally stated to be \"social discovery\" mobile apps, which let users locate other nearby users. Social discovery apps that had a presence at SXSW included Highlight, Glancee, Sonar and Kismet.\n\nSXSW Film saw the premiere of two major Hollywood films: \"The Cabin in the Woods\" and \"21 Jump Street\". Two films obtained distribution deals: \"Girls Against Boys\" and \"The Tall Man\". Another film, \"Gimme the Loot\", which won the SXSW Narrative Feature Grand Jury Prize, got a distribution deal a week after the festival. \"Bay of All Saints\" received the Audience Award for Best Feature Documentary.\n\n2012 was also the first year the music portion was expanded to Tuesday. The musical festival included rappers such as Talib Kweli and Lil' Wayne, along with surprise appearances by Big Sean and Kanye West; indie bands that appeared included MENEW and The Shins. Bruce Springsteen was the keynote speaker for the music festival.\n\nSXSW 2013 ran from March 8 to 17.\n\nThe big-budget films \"The Incredible Burt Wonderstone\" and \"Evil Dead\" premiered at the 2013 SXSW Film, and \"Spring Breakers\" had its U.S. premiere. The film \"Short Term 12\" won the grand jury award for Best Narrative Feature. The films \"Cheap Thrills\" and \"Haunter\" received distribution deals, and \"Drinking Buddies\" obtained a distribution deal several days later.\n\nThe 2013 SXSW Interactive saw another huge jump in registration, now with 30,621 paying attendees. This was over three times the number that had attended in 2008 (9,000), just five years previously. The keynote talk for the 2013 SXSW Interactive was given by SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. The \"Screenburn\" and \"Arcade\" components were renamed to \"SXSW Gaming\" and \"SXSW Gaming Expo\", respectively. The Interactive conference was noted for its increased corporate presence, featuring major participation by Samsung, 3M, Target, American Airlines, Adobe Systems and AT&T, among others. According to CNN, CBS and CNET called Grumpy Cat the undisputed \"biggest star\" of SXSW Interactive over Musk, Al Gore and Neil Gaiman.\n\nSXSW 2014 ran from March 7 to 16.\n\nSXSW Film had premieres of the big-budget films \"Neighbors\", \"Veronica Mars\" and \"Chef\", and \"Cesar Chavez\" had its North American premiere. A clip for the big-budget film \"Godzilla\" was also screened. The films \"Space Station 76\" and \"Exists\" got distribution deals at the festival, while \"Fort Tilden\" (which won the Narrative Feature Grand Jury Prize) and \"Open Windows\" got distribution deals shortly afterward.\n\nA new section, \"Episodic\" (on television programming) was introduced to SXSW Film. Television series that previewed at the festival include \"Silicon Valley\" and \"\". The talk show \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" was taped for a week at the festival; it joined the talk show \"\", which began taping at SXSW in 2013.\n\nSXSW Interactive featured a keynote speech by NSA leaker Edward Snowden, via streaming video, about privacy rights. The festival also featured a talk from another famous leaker, Julian Assange, also speaking remotely. Besides privacy issues, another major focus of the Interactive festival was wearable technology, including devices for augmented reality, activity tracking, identity authentication, charging cell phones and others. \"Computerworld\" magazine called the Oculus Rift, a virtual reality gaming headset, the \"sleeper hit\" of the festival, although it was displayed not at the Interactive but at the Film portion, as part of a \"Game of Thrones\" exhibit. The SXSW Gaming section introduced its SXSW Gaming Awards to recognize achievement in video and other types of gaming, which has continued through future SXSW festivals.\n\nThe keynote presenter and headline act this year for Stubb's was Lady Gaga. To promote her upcoming album, \"Food\", Kelis cooked and served barbecue-style food from a food truck to festival attendees.\n\nOn March 13, 2014, a drunk driver, Rashad Charjuan Owens, drove his car into a crowd of festival attendees while trying to evade a traffic stop. Two people were killed immediately, another two died later from their injuries and another 21 were injured but survived. Owens was convicted of capital murder charges after a November 2015 trial in which eyewitnesses testified that about \"a chaotic and harrowing scene\" on the night, as hundreds of people ran and screamed as the car sped through crowds of people. Owens was given an automatic sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.\n\nOn March 15, 2014, rapper Tyler, The Creator was arrested on misdemeanor charges of \"inciting to riot\" after yelling to fans to push their way past security guards at a sold-out show the previous day. In February 2016, the riot charges were dropped against Tyler, The Creator pursuant to a plea agreement with prosecutors (under which the rapper pleaded guilty to the lesser offense of disorderly conduct and paid a $100 fine, with the case to be dismissed if he stays out of trouble for three months).\n\nSXSW 2015 took place from March 13 to 22.\n\nSXSW Film screened 145 feature films, an all-time high for the festival. The big-budget films \"Furious 7\" (which was a last-minute addition to the lineup), \"Get Hard\", \"Spy\", a rough cut of \"Trainwreck\", \"Moonwalkers\" and \"The Final Girls\" had their world premieres, as did the documentaries \"Danny Says\", \"Steve Jobs: The Man in the Machine\" and \"\". \"Ex Machina\" had its North American premiere. \"6 Years\", \"Manson Family Vacation\" and \"Steve Jobs: The Man in the Machine\" all got distribution deals at the festival.\n\nThe 2015 festival hosted the swearing-in ceremony of Michelle K. Lee as the new head of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker administered the oath of office to Lee at the festival on Friday, March 13.\n\nVarious sources called Meerkat, an iOS app that had launched two weeks earlier that lets users livestream video via Twitter, the breakout technology of SXSW Interactive. Another product that got significant buzz was a prototype of the roadable aircraft AeroMobil, which its makers, the company AeroMobil s.r.o., said would be ready for operation by 2017.\n\nSXSW 2016 began on March 11 and ended on March 20.\n\nOn March 11, President Barack Obama gave a speech at SXSW Interactive in which he called on the technology industry to help solve many of America's problems, such as upgrading outdated networks, helping balance security and privacy, and the FBI–Apple encryption dispute.\n\nFilms that premiered at SXSW Film include \"Everybody Wants Some!!\", \"Keanu\", \"Sausage Party\", \"Pee-wee's Big Holiday\" and \"Don't Think Twice\".\n\nOn the night of March 20, gunshots rang out on 6th Street causing mass hysteria and panic. No injuries were reported and a man from Memphis was arrested with discharging a firearm and disturbing the peace.\n\nFilms that premiered at SXSW Film include \"Song to Song\", \"Baby Driver\", \"Atomic Blonde\", \"Gemini\", \"The Ballad of Lefty Brown\". \"Spettacolo\" and \"The Disaster Artist\". Television shows that were previewed include \"The Son\", \"Dear White People\" and \"American Gods\". To promote the Hulu original miniseries \"The Handmaid's Tale\", an adaptation of the classic dystopian novel by Margaret Atwood, dozens of actresses silently walked the streets of downtown Austin costumed in red \"handmaid\" dresses. To promote the third season of the AMC original series \"Better Call Saul\" (a spin-off prequel of \"Breaking Bad\"), a pop-up \"Los Pollos Hermanos\" restaurant, representing the fictional fast food chain featured in both series, appeared in downtown Austin.\n\nGuest speakers included former mayor of Newark, NJ and current Senator Cory Booker (D-New Jersey), political activist and commentator Van Jones and former Vice President Joe Biden, who spoke about his cancer research initiative. Nile Rodgers gave the keynote address for the music portion of the festival, while filmmakers Gareth Edwards and Lee Daniels gave the keynote presentations for the film portion.\n\nMajor companies and brands which exhibited at SXSW (many with standalone \"brand activation\" pavilions) included IBM, Intel, Panasonic, Nintendo, GE, Giorgio Armani, Mazda and National Geographic.\n\nMajor performers during the music component of the festival included Garth Brooks, Lana Del Rey, Lil Yachty, The Roots, The Avett Brothers, Willie Nelson, Solange Knowles, Rae Sremmurd, Migos, and The Chainsmokers among others.\n\nEn route to SXSW 2017, Italian post-punk band Soviet Soviet, traveling on the Visa Waiver Program, was denied entry to the United States, detained overnight and deported after an immigration officer at Seattle–Tacoma International Airport claimed they were planning on conducting a paid performance, which would have required a work visa. The band presented a letter from their American record label stating that both their performances at KEXP (which was what had brought the band to Seattle) and at SXSW were for promotional purposes only, but this failed to convince officials at the airport. There was also a \"Contrabanned\" showcase on March 17, featuring various artists and musicians (residents of the U.S. and Canada) who are natives of, or have family connections to, countries affected by the 2017 U.S. travel ban on citizens from parts of the Islamic world.\n\nUber and Lyft pulled out of Austin in May 2016 as a result of a city ordinance mandating fingerprint-based background checks for drivers of any transportation network company. However, other services such as (locally based) RideAustin, Fasten and Fare, were available, although in high demand. Uber and Lyft resumed service in Austin in May 2017.\n\nSXSW 2018 ran from March 9 to 18. Some attendees noted fewer \"big name\" musical acts and corporate pavilions at the festival, and fewer crowds, as compared to previous years.\n\nFinalists of the 2018 SXSW Accelerator Pitch Event included Cambridge Cancer Genomics and Bluefield Technologies. Two winners of the event were Austin-based: GrubTubs (in the Hyper-Connected Communities category) and ICON 3D (in the Social and Culture category).\n\nGuest speakers included U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont); entrepreneur Elon Musk; actor and former Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger; Mayor of London Sadiq Khan; author and journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates; journalist Christiane Amanpour; rap artist/producer David Banner, and film producer/directors Barry Jenkins, Darren Aronofsky and Steven Spielberg. Actor and comedian Bill Murray appeared at several unofficial functions during SXSW.\n\nMajor performers during SXSW Music included Tinashe, Rae Sremmurd, Rita Coolidge, Salt-N-Pepa and Khalid. There was an apparent increased emphasis on locally based performers, international acts and relative unknowns.\n\nNew games announced during the 2018 SXSW Gaming Expo included \"Sonic Mania Plus\". At the SXSW Gaming Awards (held March 17), the award for Game of the Year went to \".\"\n\nFilms that premiered at the 2018 South By Southwest Film Festival include \"A Quiet Place,\" \"Blockers\" and \"Ready Player One\". Films that had their U.S. premiere include \"Final Portrait\" and \"Who We Are Now\". TV series that previewed include \"Barry\", \"Krypton\", \"The Last O.G.\" and \"Cloak & Dagger\". To promote the second season of the HBO series \"Westworld\", a recreation of the show's fictional Western \"town\" of Sweetwater was built on two acres of open land just outside Austin. Fans took shuttles to the site, which was dressed in the Old West style, with over 60 actors playing the parts of the android \"hosts\".\n\nSXSW 2018 coincided with a string of bombings in Austin, which had begun on March 2 and ended on March 21, when the presumed perpetrator, Mark Anthony Conditt, blew himself up after being discovered by police. Two of the bombings occurred during SXSW. On March 17, Live Nation Music, a company organizing events for SXSW, received a bomb threat via email. Police searched the area mentioned in the email and found nothing of concern, but planned performances by The Roots and Ludacris, among others, were canceled. Police arrested 26-year-old Trevor Weldon Ingram the next day; Ingram was charged with making a terroristic threat, a third-degree felony, in connection with the email.\nSXSW is the highest revenue-producing event (outside of athletic and other events associated with the University of Texas) for the Austin economy, with an estimated economic impact of $190.3 million in 2012 increasing to $218 million in 2013, $315 million in 2014, $317 million in 2015, and $325 million in 2016. (In comparison, Super Bowl LI brought a $347 million economic impact to the Houston economy and the 2016 Final Four brought a $324 million economic impact to the economy of Phoenix, Arizona.)\n\nAdditionally, demand for hotel rooms in the Austin area continued to outstrip supply, pushing average nightly room rates up to an all-time high of $350 in 2016, a 60 percent increase over the average room rate seen during 2011's edition of SXSW. The average SXSW registrant also stayed in Austin longer in 2016, spending an average of 5.2 nights, up from 4.9 nights in 2015.\n\nThe growth of the festival has brought concerns about violence, crowd control, and safety.\n\nThe 2014 drunk-driving incident prompted discussion about whether the festival had grown too large and raucous. The organizers of the festival—SXSW Holdings LLC and SXSW Holdings Inc.—were sued by families of the four victims.\n\nIn May 2014, partially motivated by the 2014 crash, Austin's Urban Transportation Commission announced that it was seeking to enhance safety at the festival, with an initial focus on implementing transportation measures to resolve issues linked to the festival. The Austin Music Commission also met to discuss music venues and sound problems linked to the festival. The city voted to limit the number of special events which would be approved to 114, a 32 percent decrease from the number of approved events during the 2014 festival.\n\nAnother frequent criticism of the SXSW festival is that it has become overly commercialized. In 2013, NPR writer Andrea Swensson wrote that she had decided to stop attending the festival, writing, \"I can't help but feel that it has strayed far away from its original premise as a grassroots gathering place for new, undiscovered talent and increasingly feels like a big ol' Times Square billboard-sized commercial.\"\n\nIn October 2015, SXSW announced the cancellation of two video game panels (\"#SavePoint: A Discussion on the Gaming Community\" and \"Level Up: Overcoming Harassment In Games\") scheduled for the 2016 festival due to threats of violence made to the festival hosting the sessions. In response to the cancellations, Buzzfeed and Vox Media made statements saying they would pull out of the festival if the two panels weren't reinstated. In response to the criticism, South by Southwest admitted that their decision to cancel the panels was a mistake. In lieu of a panel, South by Southwest hosted a daylong \"online harassment summit\" on March 12, 2016. Despite fears that violent hecklers would disrupt the summit, it was described by Brian Fung as \"a largely peaceful affair\", with protests limited to those who were angry about the bag searches conducted there.\n\n\nThe creators of South by Southwest co-created two similar festivals in 1995: North by Northwest (NXNW) in Portland, Oregon (co-founded by the \"Willamette Week\"), and North by Northeast (NXNE) in Toronto (co-founded by \"Now\"). North by Northwest ended in 2001, and was replaced by MusicfestNW (MFNW), an event run entirely by the \"Willamette Week\". It was joined by TechfestNW, a technology conference, in 2012. From 2006 to 2010, SXSW organizers also ran West by Southwest (WXSW) in Tucson, Arizona, a music festival which occurred directly before South by Southwest and mostly featured bands that were also booked for SXSW.\n\nOther active festivals inspired by SXSW include the following:\n\nFestivals inspired by SXSW that are no longer running include:\n\nFestivals inspired by South by Southwest have been collectively nicknamed \"four-letter festivals\". \"Metro Silicon Valley\", which founded C2SV, wrote in 2013 that such festivals were important revenue sources for the alternative weekly newspapers that founded them.\n\nOn October 3, 2016, a one-day festival, called \"South by South Lawn\" (SXSL), was held at the White House; it was a collaboration between SXSW, US President Barack Obama, and the American Film Institute.\n\n"}

It is the sixth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was written and directed by Joss Whedon and features an ensemble cast that includes Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, and Jeremy Renner as the titular Avengers team, alongside Tom Hiddleston, Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders, Stellan Skarsgård, and Samuel L. Jackson. In the film, Nick Fury, director of the spy agency S.H.I.E.L.D., recruits Tony Stark, Captain America, the Hulk, and Thor to form a team that must stop Thor's brother Loki from subjugating Earth.\n\nThe film's development began when Marvel Studios received a loan from Merrill Lynch in April 2005. After the success of the film \"Iron Man\" in May 2008, Marvel announced that \"The Avengers\" would be released in July 2011. With the signing of Johansson in March 2009, the film was pushed back for a 2012 release. Whedon was brought on board in April 2010 and rewrote the original screenplay by Zak Penn. Production began in April 2011 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, before moving to Cleveland, Ohio, in August and New York City in September. The film was converted to 3D in post-production.\n\n\"The Avengers\" premiered on April 11, 2012, at Hollywood's El Capitan Theatre and was released in the United States on May 4, 2012. The film received positive reviews from critics, as well as numerous awards and nominations including Academy Award and BAFTA nominations for achievements in visual effects. It set or tied numerous box office records, including the biggest opening weekend in the United States and Canada. \"The Avengers\" grossed over $1.5 billion worldwide and became the third-highest-grossing film of all time, as well as the highest-grossing film of 2012. It is the first Marvel production to generate $1 billion in ticket sales. \n\nTwo sequels, titled \"\" and \"\", were released in May 2015 and April 2018, respectively, while an untitled third sequel is scheduled for release in 2019.\n\nThe Asgardian Loki encounters the Other, the leader of an extraterrestrial race known as the Chitauri. In exchange for retrieving the Tesseract, a powerful energy source of unknown potential, the Other promises Loki an army with which he can subjugate Earth. Nick Fury, director of the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D., and his lieutenant Agent Maria Hill arrive at a remote research facility during an evacuation, where physicist Dr. Erik Selvig is leading a research team experimenting on the Tesseract. Agent Phil Coulson explains that the object has begun radiating an unusual form of energy. The Tesseract suddenly activates and opens a wormhole, allowing Loki to reach Earth. Loki takes the Tesseract and uses his scepter to enslave Selvig and a few other agents, including Clint Barton, to aid him in his getaway.\n\nIn response to the attack, Fury reactivates the \"Avengers Initiative\". Agent Natasha Romanoff is sent to Calcutta to recruit Dr. Bruce Banner to trace the Tesseract through its gamma radiation emissions. Coulson visits Tony Stark to have him review Selvig's research, and Fury approaches Steve Rogers with an assignment to retrieve the Tesseract.\n\nIn Stuttgart, Barton steals iridium needed to stabilize the Tesseract's power while Loki causes a distraction, leading to a brief confrontation with Rogers, Stark, and Romanoff that ends with Loki's surrender. While Loki is being escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D., Thor, his adoptive brother, arrives and frees him, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan and return to Asgard. After a confrontation with Stark and Rogers, Thor agrees to take Loki to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier, the Helicarrier. Upon arrival, Loki is imprisoned while Banner and Stark attempt to locate the Tesseract.\n\nThe Avengers become divided, both over how to approach Loki and the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to harness the Tesseract to develop weapons as a deterrent against hostile extraterrestrials. As the group argues, Barton and Loki's other possessed agents attack the Helicarrier, disabling one of its engines in flight and causing Banner to transform into the Hulk. Stark and Rogers work to restart the damaged engine, and Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage. Romanoff reluctantly fights Barton, and knocks him unconscious, breaking Loki's mind control. Loki escapes after killing Coulson and ejecting Thor from the airship, while the Hulk falls to the ground after attacking a S.H.I.E.L.D. fighter jet. Fury uses Coulson's death to motivate the Avengers into working as a team. Stark and Rogers realize that for Loki, simply defeating them will not be enough; he needs to overpower them publicly to validate himself as ruler of Earth. Loki uses the Tesseract, in conjunction with a device Selvig built, to open a wormhole above Stark Tower to the Chitauri fleet in space, launching his invasion.\n\nRogers, Stark, Romanoff, Barton, and Thor rally in defense of New York City, the wormhole's location. Banner arrives and transforms into the Hulk, and together the Avengers battle the Chitauri while evacuating civilians. The Hulk finds Loki and beats him into submission. Romanoff makes her way to the wormhole generator, where Selvig, freed from Loki's mind control, reveals that Loki's scepter can be used to shut down the generator. Meanwhile, Fury's superiors from the World Security Council attempt to end the invasion by launching a nuclear missile at Midtown Manhattan. Stark intercepts the missile and takes it through the wormhole toward the Chitauri fleet. The missile detonates, destroying the Chitauri mothership and disabling their forces on Earth. Stark's suit runs out of power, and he falls back through the wormhole just as Romanoff closes it. Stark goes into freefall, but the Hulk saves him from crashing into the ground. In the aftermath, Thor returns Loki and the Tesseract to Asgard, while Fury expresses confidence that the Avengers will return if and when they are needed.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, the Other confers with his master about the failed attack on Earth. In a post-credits scene, the Avengers eat in silence at a shawarma restaurant.\n\n\nGwyneth Paltrow and Maximiliano Hernández reprise their roles from previous films as Pepper Potts and Jasper Sitwell, respectively. Paul Bettany returns to voice J.A.R.V.I.S. Frequent Whedon collaborator Alexis Denisof portrays the Other, and Damion Poitier portrays his master, Thanos (unnamed in the film), in a post-credit scene. Powers Boothe and Jenny Agutter appear as members of the World Security Council. Avengers co-creator Stan Lee has a cameo appearance in a news report. Harry Dean Stanton cameos as a security guard, and Polish film director Jerzy Skolimowski appears as Georgi Luchkov, Romanoff's interrogator. Enver Gjokaj, who later went on to play Agent Daniel Sousa in the series \"Agent Carter\", appears as a police officer.\n\nIdeas for a film based on the Avengers began in 2003, with Avi Arad, the CEO of Marvel Studios, first announcing plans to develop the film in April 2005, after Marvel Enterprises declared independence by allying with Merrill Lynch to produce a slate of films that would be distributed by Paramount Pictures. Marvel discussed their plans in a brief presentation to Wall Street analysts; the studio's intention was to release individual films for the main characters—to establish their identities and familiarize audiences with them—before merging the characters together in a crossover film. Screenwriter Zak Penn, who wrote \"The Incredible Hulk\" (2008), became attached to the film in 2006, and was hired by Marvel Studios to write the film in June 2007. In the wake of the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, Marvel negotiated with the Writers Guild of America to ensure that it could create films based on its comic book counterparts, including Captain America, Ant-Man and The Avengers. After the successful release of \"Iron Man\" (2008) in May, the company set a July 2011 release date for \"The Avengers\". In September 2008, Marvel Studios reached an agreement with Paramount—an extension of a previous partnership—which gave the company distribution rights for five future Marvel films.\n\nCasting began in October 2008 with Downey's signing. Though Don Cheadle was also reported to be reprising his \"Iron Man 2\" role of War Machine for \"The Avengers\", he later stated that he did not think the character would appear in the film. At the same time, two major prospects occurred for Marvel: Jon Favreau was brought in as an executive producer for the film, and the company signed a long-term lease with Raleigh Studios to produce three other big-budget films—\"Iron Man 2\", \"Thor\" (2011), and \"\" (2011)—at their Manhattan Beach, California complex. Lou Ferrigno, who voiced Hulk in \"The Incredible Hulk\", stated that he would be involved in the film. In February 2009, Samuel L. Jackson signed a nine-picture deal with Marvel Entertainment to play Nick Fury in \"Iron Man 2\" and other films. In September 2009, Edward Norton, who played Bruce Banner in \"The Incredible Hulk\" stated that he was open to returning in the film. The next month, executive producer Jon Favreau stated that he would not direct the film, but would \"definitely have input and a say\". Favreau also expressed concerns, stating, \"It's going to be hard, because I was so involved in creating the world of Iron Man, and Iron Man is very much a tech-based hero, and then with \"Avengers\" you're going to be introducing some supernatural aspects because of Thor... [Mixing] the two of those works very well in the comic books, but it's going to take a lot of thoughtfulness to make that all work and not blow the reality that we've created\". In March 2009, actress Scarlett Johansson replaced Emily Blunt in portraying Natasha Romanoff in \"Iron Man 2\", a deal that subsequently attached her to \"The Avengers\". The following day, Marvel announced that the film's release date had been pushed back to May 4, 2012, almost a full year later. Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston joined the film's cast in June, returning as Thor and Loki, respectively.\n\nIn July 2009, Penn talked about the crossover process, stating, \"My job is to kind of shuttle between the different movies and make sure that finally we're mimicking that comic book structure where all of these movies are connected. . . There's just a board that tracks 'Here's where everything that happens in this movie overlaps with that movie'. . . I'm pushing them to do as many animatics as possible to animate the movie, to draw boards so that we're all working off the same visual ideas. But the exigencies of production take first priority\". At first, Penn tried to reduce Thor's role in the script because he had doubts about the character's ability to succeed on film. He changed his mind once Hemsworth was cast as Thor. The film had always intended to use Loki as its villain, but Penn noted that early discussion had considered using Red Skull.\n\nIn January 2010, Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige was asked if it would be difficult to meld the fantasy of \"Thor\" with the high-tech science fiction in \"Iron Man\" and \"The Avengers\". \"No,\" he said, \"because we're doing the Jack Kirby/Stan Lee/Walt Simonson/J. Michael Straczynski \"Thor\". We're not doing the blow-the-dust-off-of-the-old-Norse-book-in-your-library \"Thor\". And in the \"Thor\" of the Marvel Universe, there's a race called the Asgardians. And we're linked through this Tree of Life that we're unaware of. It's real science, but we don't know about it yet. The 'Thor' movie is about teaching people that\". In March, it was reported that Penn had completed the first draft of the script, and that Marvel editor-in-chief Joe Quesada and \"Avengers\" comic-book writer Brian Michael Bendis had received copies. Also in March, Chris Evans accepted an offer to play Captain America in three films including \"The Avengers\".\n\nBy April 2010, Joss Whedon was close to completing a deal to direct the film and to rework Penn's script, and was officially announced in July 2010. On the hiring, Arad stated: \"My personal opinion is that Joss will do a fantastic job. He loves these characters and is a fantastic writer... It's part of his life so you know he is going to protect it... I expect someone like him is going to make the script even better\". Feige added, \"I've known Joss for many years. We were looking for the right thing and he came in and met on it... we want[ed] to find a director that’s on the verge of doing something great, as we think Joss is.\" Whedon stated at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International, that what drew him to the film is that he loves how \"these people shouldn't be in the same room let alone on the same team—and that is the definition of family\".\n\nWhen Whedon received Penn's draft, he told Feige he felt the studio did not \"have anything\" and they should \"pretend this draft never happened\". Part of Whedon's issue was the lack of character connections in Penn's draft, which necessitated Whedon to begin \"at square one\". Whedon went on to write a five page treatment of his plan for the film, and created the tagline \"Avengers: Some Assembly Required\", riffing on the \"Avengers Assemble\" slogan from the comic books. Marvel quickly began working to sign Whedon to write and direct, only stipulating that he include the Avengers against Loki, a battle among the heroes in the middle, a battle against the villains at the end, and he get the film done for its May 2012 release. The script would go through \"a lot of insane iterations of what might be\" according to Whedon. Whedon explained there was a point when it was not certain Johansson would star in the film, so he \"wrote a huge bunch of pages starring The Wasp.\" He also was \"worried that one British character actor [(Hiddleston)] was not enough to take on Earth's mightiest heroes, and that we'd feel like we were rooting for the overdog. So I wrote a huge draft with Ezekiel Stane, Obadiah Stane's son, in it.\" Once all of the actors were \"locked in place the movie stayed on mission.\" Whedon noted that the characters used do not have the same issue, unlike the X-Men. He felt \"these guys just don't belong together\" before realizing their interactions could be like \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967). Whedon also referenced \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"The Abyss\" (1989), \"His Girl Friday\" (1940), and \"Black Hawk Down\" (2001). Whedon would ultimately share final screenplay credit with Penn, though Whedon noted he \"fought\" for sole credit and was \"very upset about it.\" Penn felt the two \"could have collaborated more, but that was not his choice. He wanted to do it his way, and I respect that.\" \nThe casting process continued into much of 2010, with the additions of Jeremy Renner, Mark Ruffalo, and Clark Gregg. Ruffalo replaced Edward Norton, whom Marvel declined to have back. \"We have made the decision to not bring Ed Norton back to portray the title role of Bruce Banner in \"The Avengers\",\" stated Feige. \"Our decision is definitely not one based on monetary factors, but instead rooted in the need for an actor who embodies the creativity and collaborative spirit of our other talented cast members. \"The Avengers\" demands players who thrive working as part of an ensemble, as evidenced by Robert, Chris H, Chris E, Samuel, Scarlett, and all of our talented casts. We are looking to announce a name actor who fulfills these requirements, and is passionate about the iconic role in the coming weeks.\" In response, Norton's agent Brian Swardstrom decried Feige's statement, calling it \"purposefully misleading\" and an \"inappropriate attempt to paint our client in a negative light\". In October 2014, Norton claimed it was his own decision never to play Hulk again because he \"wanted more diversity\" with his career, and did not want to be associated with only one character.\n\nIn August 2010, it was reported that Paramount Pictures and Marvel Studios were planning to start shooting in February. Simultaneously, it was declared that the film would be shot in 3D, although Mark Ruffalo later tweeted that this was not the case. In October 2010, Grumman Studios in Bethpage, New York and the Steiner Studios in Brooklyn, New York City, were announced as filming locations, with set construction slated to begin in November, but as Whedon later explained, \"Originally we were supposed to be in Los Angeles, then for a short period we were supposed to be in New York, and then somehow we ended up in Albuquerque.\" Also that October, Walt Disney Studios agreed to pay Paramount at least $115 million for the worldwide distribution rights to \"Iron Man 3\" and \"The Avengers\". The deal also allowed Paramount to continue to collect the 8 percent box office fee it would have earned for distributing the film and a marquee credit—placement of the company's production logo on marketing materials and the film's opening titles. As a result, the onscreen production credit reads \"Marvel Studios presents in association with Paramount Pictures\" though the film is solely owned, distributed, financed, and marketed by Disney. Paramount's Epix retained pay TV rights.\n\nIn December 2010, Governor of New Mexico Bill Richardson and Marvel Studios Co-president Louis D'Esposito announced \"The Avengers\" would film primarily in Albuquerque, New Mexico, with principal photography scheduled for April through September 2011. Parts of the film were also scheduled to be shot in Michigan, but a plan to film in Detroit ended after Governor Rick Snyder issued a budget proposal that would eliminate a film tax incentive. Three months later in March, Governor of Ohio John Kasich announced before Mayor Frank G. Jackson's State of the City address that \"The Avengers\" would film in Cleveland.\n\nConcept illustrator and designer of Iron Man's Mark VII armor Phil Saunders stated that \"Joss Whedon was looking for something that had the 'cool' factor of the suitcase suit [from \"Iron Man 2\"], while still being a fully armored, heavy duty suit that could take on an army in the final battle.\" To that end, Saunders borrowed ideas that had been proposed in \"Iron Man 2\" as well as some ideas that had been abandoned in \"Iron Man\" and merged them together in a modular suit that has big ammo packets on the arms and a backpack. The Science & Entertainment Exchange also provided science consultation for the film.\n\nCasting reached its final stages the following year. In February 2011, Cobie Smulders acquired the role of Maria Hill, after participating in screen tests conducted by Marvel for the role of a key S.H.I.E.L.D. member, who Samuel L. Jackson described as Nick Fury's sidekick. Over the successive months, the film's cast expanded to include Stellan Skarsgård, Paul Bettany, and Gwyneth Paltrow. Paltrow was cast at Downey's insistence; prior to this, Whedon had not intended the film to include supporting characters from the heroes' individual films, commenting, \"You need to separate the characters from their support systems in order to create the isolation you need for a team.\"\n\nPrincipal photography began on April 25, 2011, in Albuquerque, New Mexico at Albuquerque Studios, with the working title \"Group Hug\". In June 2011, stuntman Jeremy Fitzgerald injured his head while attempting a stunt involving a 30-foot fall from a building after getting hit by an arrow. A Marvel spokesperson later told TMZ.com that despite the injury, Fitzgerald recovered and continued working on set. The following month, secondary filming took place about an hour outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the Butler area. A chase sequence was also shot in Worthington, Pennsylvania at Creekside Mushroom Farms, the world's largest single-site mushroom farm, which provided 150 miles of abandoned limestone tunnels 300 feet below the ground for filming.\n\nProduction relocated to Cleveland, Ohio in August 2011, where filming transpired over a period of four weeks. The city's East 9th Street was chosen as a double for New York City's 42nd Street to be used in climactic battle scenes. Army Reserve soldiers assigned to the Columbus, Ohio-based 391st Military Police Battalion provided background action during the battle scenes in Cleveland. Staff Sergeant Michael T. Landis stated the use of real soldiers made the scenes more realistic and helped portray the military in a more positive light, explaining that, \"It's easy for us to make on-the-spot corrections to tactics and uniforms, the director actually took our recommendation on one scene and let us all engage the enemy as opposed to only the gunners in the trucks engaging\". Filming also took place in the large vacuum chamber at the NASA Plum Brook Station near Sandusky, Ohio. The station's Space Power Facility was used to portray a S.H.I.E.L.D. research facility. A series of explosions were filmed at the Chevrolet powertrain plant in Parma, Ohio as part of the battle sequence that began in Cleveland. Scenes from the film were also shot on Public Square and the Detroit–Superior Bridge. Public Square's southwest quadrant was turned into Stuttgart, Germany, for filming.\n\nPrincipal photography concluded in New York City, where filming occurred over two days. Filming locations in New York City included Park Avenue and Central Park. For scenes taking place in Manhattan, visual effects supervisor Jake Morrison shot aerial footage for over three days to use as background plates, elaborating that his main objective was to \"get as much aerial work in as possible for the audience to see the big expanses, the wide establishing shots, while also making sure that the effects work doesn't look too computer generated\". \"We're getting much better at making entirely computer-generated environments,\" Morrison explained, \"but there is no substitute for starting with a real image and adding what you need.\"\n\nCinematographer Seamus McGarvey stated that he composed the frame with a 1.85:1 aspect ratio to cope with the varying heights of the main characters, explaining that \"shooting 1.85:1 is kind of unusual for an epic film like this, but we needed the height in the screen to be able to frame in all the characters like Hulk, Captain America and Black Widow, who is much smaller. We had to give them all precedence and width within the frame. Also, Joss [Whedon] knew the final battle sequence was going to be this extravaganza in Manhattan, so the height and vertical scale of the buildings was going to be really important.\" The film was McGarvey's first venture shooting with a digital camera, the Arri Alexa. The Canon EOS 5D Mark II and Canon EOS 7D digital SLR cameras were used for some shots, and high-speed shots were captured on 35 mm film with the Arriflex 435. About his visual approach, McGarvey remarked, \"Joss and I were keen on having a very visceral and naturalistic quality to the image. We wanted this to feel immersive and did not want a 'comic book look' that might distance an audience with the engagement of the film. We moved the camera a lot on Steadicam, cranes and on dollies to create kinetic images; and we chose angles that were dramatic, like low angles for heroic imagery.\"\n\nIn December 2011, Disney announced that the film would be converted to 3D. Said Whedon, \"I'm not a big fan of extreme long lens, talky movies – I like to see the space I'm in and relate to it, so 3D kinda fits my aesthetic anyway. And the technology has advanced so far in the past couple years.\" Whedon also said that \"there definitely are movies that shouldn't be in 3D\" but \"\"The Avengers\" isn't obnoxiously 3D. There's no, 'Oh look, we're going to spend 20 minutes going through this tunnel because it's in 3D!' And no one is pointing at the screen the entire time. But it's an action movie. Things tend to hurtle toward the screen anyway\". In January 2012, it was reported that the film would be digitally remastered for IMAX 3D and open in IMAX theaters on May 4, 2012, the same day it opens in regular theaters. The film's IMAX release follows Marvel's IMAX releases of \"Iron Man 2\" and \"Thor\".\n\nIn a May 2012 interview, Whedon said that it was his decision to include Thanos in a post-credits scene, although the character is not identified in the film. \"He for me is the most powerful and fascinating Marvel villain. He's the great grand daddy of the badasses and he's in love with Death and I just think that's so cute. For me, the greatest Avengers [comic book] was \"Avengers Annual\" #7 (1977) that Jim Starlin did followed by \"Marvel Two-in-One Annual\" #2 (1977) that contained the death of Adam Warlock. Those were some of the most important texts and I think underrated milestones in Marvel history and Thanos is all over that, so somebody had to be in control and had to be behind Loki's work and I was like 'It's got to be Thanos.' And they said 'Okay' and I'm like 'Oh my God!'\" An additional coda involving the Avengers eating shawarma was shot on April 12, 2012, a day after the world premiere. Evans wore a prosthetic jaw while filming the scene to cover the beard he had grown. Shawarma sales in Los Angeles, St. Louis, and Boston reportedly skyrocketed in the days following the film's release. Whedon stated the inspiration for the shawarma scene came from the events surrounding the filming of the scene where Fred dies in Wesley's arms in the \"Angel\" episode, \"A Hole in the World\". After filming the scene, Whedon and actors Amy Acker and Denisof, who portrayed Fred and Wesley, respectively, \"went out for drinks and ended up just sitting around quietly, exhausted from the day's events,\" which Whedon then mimicked in the scene for the film.\nThe film contains more than 2,200 visual effects shots completed by 14 companies: Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Weta Digital, Scanline VFX, Hydraulx, Fuel VFX, Evil Eye Pictures, Luma Pictures, Cantina Creative, Trixter, Modus FX, Whiskytree, Digital Domain, The Third Floor and Method Design. ILM was the lead vendor and shared responsibility for creating many of the film's key effects, including the Helicarrier, the New York cityscape, digital body doubles, Iron Man and the Hulk. To create the on-screen Hulk, Ruffalo performed in a motion-capture suit on set with the other actors while four motion-capture HD cameras (two full body, two focused on his face) captured his face and body movements. Jeff White, ILM's visual effects supervisor, said, \"We really wanted to utilize everything we've developed the last 10 years and make it a pretty spectacular Hulk. One of the great design decisions was to incorporate Mark Ruffalo into the look of him. So, much of Hulk is based on Ruffalo and his performance, not only in motion capture and on set, but down to his eyes, his teeth, and his tongue.\"\n\nILM digitally recreated the vast majority of the New York cityscape used in the film. In total, ILM artists rendered an area of about ten city blocks by about four city blocks. To do this, ILM sent out a team of four photographers to take pictures of the area in a shoot that lasted 8 weeks. Tyson Bidner, the New York location manager on the film, helped by securing the rights to almost every building's likeness in the area ILM needed. Disney and Sony Pictures agreed for OsCorp Tower from \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" to be included in the film, but the idea was dropped because much of the skyline had already been completed.\n\nWeta Digital took over duties for animating Iron Man during the forest duel from ILM. Guy Williams, Weta's visual effects supervisor, said, \"We shared assets back and forth with ILM, but our pipelines are unique and it's hard for other assets to plug into it. But in this case, we got their models and we had to redo the texture spaces because the way we texture maps is different.\" Williams said the most difficult part was re-creating Iron Man's reflective metal surfaces.\n\nScanline VFX completed the reveal shots of the Helicarrier, from the moment Black Widow and Captain America arrive on the carrier deck to the point where it lifts off. Evil Eye Pictures composited digital backgrounds into shots filmed against a greenscreen for scenes taking place inside the Helicarrier. Colin Strause of Hydraulx said, \"We did the opening ten minutes of the movie, other than the opening set-up in space\" including Loki's arrival on Earth and subsequent escape from the S.H.I.E.L.D. base. Luma Pictures worked on shots featuring the Helicarrier's bridge and incorporated the graphic monitor displays that were developed by Cantina Creative. Fuel VFX completed shots taking place in and around Tony Stark's penthouse at Stark Tower. Digital Domain created the asteroid environment, where Loki encounters The Other. Method Design in Los Angeles created the film's closing credits. Steve Viola, creative director at Method Design, said, \"This piece was a two-minute, self-contained main on end sequence created entirely in CG. For each of the shots in the sequence, we designed, modeled, textured, and lit all of the environments and many of the foreground objects. We received assets from Marvel to include in the piece, then heavily re-modeled and re-surfaced them to create a post-battle macro sequence. We also designed a custom typeface for the Main Title of \"The Avengers\" as well as 30 credits set in-scene.\"\n\nIn November 2011, Marvel announced that Alan Silvestri, who scored \"Captain America: The First Avenger\", would write and compose the score for \"The Avengers\". Silvestri said, \"I've worked on films where there have been a number of stars and certainly worked on films where there have been characters of equal weight in terms of their level of importance and profile in the film, but this one is somewhat extreme in that regard because each of these characters has their own world and it's a very different situation. It's very challenging to look for a way to give everyone the weight and consideration they need, but at the same time the film is really about the coming together of these characters, which implies that there is this entity called the Avengers which really has to be representative of all of them together.\" Silvestri developed the score with the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios in London, England. Whedon said, \"The score is very old-fashioned, which is why [Silvestri] was letter-perfect for this movie because he can give you the heightened emotion, the <nowiki>[</nowiki>Hans Zimmer<nowiki>]</nowiki> school of 'I'm just feeling a lot right now!' but he can also be extraordinarily cue and character specific, which I love.\"\n\nIn March 2012, American alternative rock band Soundgarden announced through its Facebook page that its song \"Live to Rise\" would be included on the film's soundtrack. Additionally, the Indian rock band Agnee released a music video for its single \"Hello Andheron\", which serves as the theme song for the film's Indian release. Hollywood Records released the soundtrack concept album inspired by the film, \"Avengers Assemble\", on May 1, 2012, the same day as the score.\n\nThe film was promoted at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International, during which a teaser trailer narrated by Samuel L. Jackson was shown followed by an introduction of the cast. In June 2011, Marvel Studios announced that it would not hold a panel at the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con International after studio executives decided it was not prepared to compete with its own past and fan expectations with filming still in production. In July 2011, a teaser trailer that was meant to be the post-credits scene of \"Captain America: The First Avenger\" was briefly leaked online. \"Entertainment Weekly\" speculated it came from a preview screening and described the footage as \"shaky, fuzzy, flickering and obviously filmed on a cell phone\".\nIn August 2011, Walt Disney Pictures, Pixar Animation Studios and Marvel Studios presented a look at Walt Disney Studios' upcoming film slate, which included \"The Avengers\", at the D23 Expo in Anaheim, California. The presentation featured footage from the film and appearances by the cast members. Later in August, Disney dismissed Marvel's executive vice president of worldwide marketing, vice president of worldwide marketing and manager of worldwide marketing to bring their functions in-house.\n\nIn October 2011, Marvel Studios held a presentation at the New York Comic Con that featured new footage and a panel discussion including producer Kevin Feige and several cast members. The first full-length trailer was also released in October. \"Comic Book Resources\" said, \"The two-minute teaser handily establishes the movie's premise\" and is \"heavy on the assembling, but fans are also treated to plenty of action, as well glimpses of Iron Man's new armor and, best of all, the new take on the Incredible Hulk. Naturally, Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark gets the best lines\". However, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" called it, \"Awesome. Or it would be if we hadn't seen all of this before and expected every single thing that we saw in the trailer\". The trailer, which debuted exclusively on iTunes Movie Trailers, was downloaded over 10 million times in its first 24 hours, breaking the website's record for the most-viewed trailer. This record was surpassed by the trailer for \"The Dark Knight Rises\", which was downloaded more than 12.5 million times in its first 24 hours. The trailer received 20.4 million views in the 24 hours after it debuted. A second full-length trailer was released on iTunes in February 2012, reaching a record 13.7 million downloads in 24 hours. The theatrical trailers of \"The Avengers\" appeared with many films, including \"\", \"21 Jump Street\" and \"The Hunger Games\".\n\nIn January 2012, Marvel Studios held a global Twitter chat. The 30-minute live tweeting event featured writer/director Joss Whedon, cast members Samuel L. Jackson, Tom Hiddleston and Clark Gregg and a 10-second tease of the 30-second Super Bowl commercial that would air during Super Bowl XLVI in February. According to the \"Los Angeles Times\", Disney paid an estimated $4 million for the 30-second spot. On May 1, 2012, executives from Marvel Studios, along with actors Tom Hiddleston and Clark Gregg, rang the opening bell of the New York Stock Exchange in honor of the film's theatrical release.\n\nIn December 2011, Marvel announced that an eight-issue comic-book prelude to the film, written by Christopher Yost and Eric Pearson with art by Luke Ross and Daniel HDR, would be released in March 2012. In February 2012, Marvel announced the release of a second limited series comic book tie-in, \"Black Widow Strikes\" written by Fred Van Lente, who wrote \"Captain America: First Vengeance\", the comic-book prequel to \"Captain America: The First Avenger\". The story is set between \"Iron Man 2\" and \"The Avengers\" and follows Black Widow as she runs down some loose ends from \"Iron Man 2\". Additionally, the title \"Avengers Assemble\" was launched in March 2012, written by Brian Michael Bendis with art by Mark Bagley and features the same Avengers line-up as the film battling a new incarnation of the supervillain team Zodiac.\n\nPaul Gitter, Marvel Entertainment's president of consumer products, commented that the build-up to the film helped strengthen retail partnerships: \"Retailers have been less tolerant with [intellectual property] films, so we decided that if we started on this coordinated strategy several years ago, retailers would give us shelf space throughout the years and we would have a more sustainable position in the marketplace\".\n\nIn September 2011, set photos of Robert Downey Jr. driving a new model Acura were published online. An Acura spokesperson later released a statement confirming the company's involvement with the film, \"As you may know, Acura has been in the Marvel Comics Universe films as the official car of their fictional law enforcement agency called S.H.I.E.L.D. That relationship continues for \"The Avengers\". The open-top sports car that was photographed yesterday is a one-off, fictional car that was made just for the movie and will not be produced. That said, as you may also know, our CEO has said publicly that we are studying the development of a new sportscar, but we can't say any more about it at this time.\" In December 2011, Acura announced that a new NSX styled along the lines of the concept built for \"The Avengers\" would be unveiled at the 2012 North American International Auto Show. A series of 10 S.H.I.E.L.D. SUVs, based on the Acura MDX with modifications by Cinema Vehicle Services, were also made for the film.\n\nIn February 2012, it was announced that Marvel has partnered with fragrance company JADS to promote \"The Avengers\" with character-based fragrances. The announcement was just ahead of the Toy Industry Association's annual February exhibition, where representatives held a sampling booth of the products. Other promotional partners include bracelet-maker Colantotte, Dr Pepper, Farmers Insurance, Harley-Davidson, Hershey, Land O'Frost lunchmeats, Oracle, Red Baron pizza, Symantec, Visa and Wyndham Hotels & Resorts. In total, Marvel and its parent-company Disney secured an estimated $100 million in worldwide marketing support for the film. Notable exclusions include Baskin-Robbins, Burger King and Dunkin' Donuts, who had partnered with Marvel in the past when their films were distributed by Paramount; Disney does not generally promote through fast food outlets.\n\nA video game based on the film was planned for concurrent release. The game was to be a first-person shooter/brawler for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii U, and Microsoft Windows and published by THQ, with THQ Studio Australia developing the console versions and Blue Tongue Entertainment the PC version. After THQ closed both studios, the game was cancelled. Intellectual property rights for an Avengers video game reverted to Marvel, which said it was exploring potential publishing and licensing opportunities.\n\nIn May 2012, Ubisoft and Marvel Entertainment announced that they were partnering to develop a motion-controlled game titled \"\" for the Wii U and Xbox 360 Kinect. The game was inspired by the \"Secret Invasion\" storyline and features 20 different characters. Marvel also announced a four-chapter mobile game titled \"Avengers Initiative\", with one chapter focusing on each of Hulk, Captain America, Thor and Iron Man.\n\nIn February 2012, Disney announced that the film's title would be changed in the United Kingdom to avoid confusion with the British TV series of the same name, as well as its 1998 film adaptation. This led to confusion over the film's actual title. \"Empire\" magazine reported that the film would be titled \"Marvel Avengers Assemble\" while \"The Hollywood Reporter\" said that it would be called simply \"Avengers Assemble\". Marvel's UK website refers to the film as \"Marvel's Avengers Assemble\", although David Cox of \"The Guardian\", in arguing that it was one of the worst film titles ever, considered this to be an error in the production notes, albeit grammatically clearer. According to the British Board of Film Classification and the Irish Film Classification Office, the title is \"Marvel Avengers Assemble\". Frank Lovece in FilmFestivalTraveler.com addressed the discrepancy, writing, \"\"The Avengers\" — formally titled \"Marvel's The Avengers\" onscreen, though no apostrophe-s appears on the posters...\" Producer Kevin Feige said there are only two words in the UK title, one more than in the U.S. title, and stated that \"decisions like that aren't made lightly and there are lots of marketing research, lawyers and things that get into the mix on it\".\n\nThe film's world premiere was April 11, 2012, at Hollywood's El Capitan Theatre. \"The Avengers\" closed the 11th Annual Tribeca Film Festival with a screening on April 28, 2012. The film received an expanded one-week theatrical push for the 2012 U.S. Labor Day weekend, increasing the number of theaters from 123 to 1,700.\n\nThe film was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on Blu-ray Disc, Blu-ray 3D, DVD and digital download on September 25, 2012 in the United States and as early as August 29, 2012 in various international markets. Producer Kevin Feige said the Blu-ray features a new Marvel One-Shot titled \"Item 47\" and \"a number of deleted scenes and a few storylines that fell by the wayside during the editing process\" including \"a few more scenes with the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Maria Hill, played by Cobie Smulders\" and \"some slightly different versions of Maria Hill and Nick Fury's interaction with the World Security Council\".\n\nThe film was also collected in a 10-disc box set titled \"Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One – Avengers Assembled\" which includes all of the Phase One films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It was released on April 2, 2013. Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment will release the film on Ultra HD Blu-ray on August 14, 2018.\n\nSome fans have criticized the UK DVD and Blu-ray release for omitting Joss Whedon's audio commentary, and for altering the scene involving Phil Coulson's death from the film's theatrical version. Disney's UK division said the \"less graphic depiction of Agent Coulson's confrontation with Loki\" occurred because \"[e]ach country has its own compliance issues relative to depictions of violence. Unfortunately, another region's elements were inadvertently used to create the UK in-home release\".\n\nUpon its first week of release on home media in the U.S., the film topped the Nielsen VideoScan First Alert chart, which tracks overall disc sales, as well as the dedicated Blu-ray Disc sales chart with 72% of unit sales coming from Blu-ray, a record for a new release in which both the DVD and Blu-ray formats were released simultaneously.\n\n\"The Avengers\" grossed $623.4 million in the United States and Canada and $895.5 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $1.519 billion. It became the third-highest-grossing film worldwide as well as the highest-grossing 2012 film, the highest-grossing comic-book adaptation, the highest-grossing superhero film and the highest-grossing film ever released by Walt Disney Studios, at the time of its release. The film's worldwide opening of $392.5 million was the fourth-largest. \"The Avengers\" also became the fifth film distributed by Disney and the twelfth film overall to earn more than $1 billion. It reached this milestone in 19 days, matching the record for speed previously set by \"Avatar\" and \"Deathly Hallows – Part 2\". Its grosses exceeded its estimated $220 million production cost 12 days after its release. It was the first Marvel production to generate $1 billion in ticket sales.\n\nThe film became the third-highest-grossing film, the highest-grossing 2012 film, the highest-grossing film distributed by Disney, the highest-grossing superhero film and the highest-grossing film based on comics. It opened Friday, May 4, 2012, on around 11,800 screens across 4,349 theaters, and earned $80.8 million, marking the second-biggest opening and second-biggest single-day gross. The film's Friday gross included an $18.7 million midnight run, a record for a superhero film Without midnight grosses, the film earned the largest opening-day gross ($62.1 million). It also set a Saturday- and Sunday-gross record ($69.6 million and $57.1 million respectively). In total, it earned a total of $207,438,708 for its debut weekend, setting an opening-weekend record, including an IMAX opening-weekend record of $15.3 million and a record for opening-weekend grosses originating from 3D showings ($108 million). The opening-weekend audience was evenly split among those under and over the age of 25, with 60% of the audience male, 55% couples, 24% families and 21% teenagers. Earning $103.1 million on its second weekend, the film set a record for the largest second-weekend gross. Other records set by the film include the biggest weekend per-theater average for a wide release ($47,698 per theater), the fastest film to reach $100 million and each additional $50 million through $550 million, and the largest cumulative gross through every day of release until, and including, its forty-third day (with the exception of its first day). It remained in first place at the box office for three consecutive weekends. The film set a record for the highest monthly share, with its $532.5 million total (through May 31, 2012) accounting for 52% of the total earnings at the box office during May.\n\nThe following are records set by the film upon its theatrical release.\n\nThe film became the third-highest-grossing film, the highest-grossing Disney-distributed film, the highest-grossing 2012 film, and the highest-grossing superhero film. It opened Wednesday, April 25, 2012, in 10 countries, earning $17.1 million. It opened in 29 more countries on April 26 and 27, earning $73.1 million in three days. Through Sunday, April 29, it earned an opening-weekend total of $185.1 million from 39 countries. It was in first place at the box office for four consecutive weekends. The film set opening-day records in New Zealand, Malaysia and Iceland, a single-day record in the Philippines, as well as both single- and opening-day records in Singapore and in Thailand. It also earned the second-highest-grossing opening day in Australia ($6.2 million), behind \"Deathly Hallows – Part 2\", in Mexico, in the Philippines and in Vietnam. It set opening-weekend records in many territories, including Mexico, Brazil, Ecuador, Bolivia, Taiwan, the Philippines, Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates, Argentina, Peru and Central America. It also earned the second largest five-day opening in Australia ($20.2 million).\n\nIn the UK, Ireland and Malta, the film earned £2.5 million ($4.1 million) on its opening day and £15.8 million ($25.7 million) during the weekend, setting an opening-weekend record for a superhero film. It became the market's highest-grossing superhero film. In Latin America, it became the highest-grossing film ($207 million) and the first film to earn more than $200 million. It also became the highest-grossing film in the Philippines, in Singapore and in Indonesia.\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 92% approval rating with an average rating of 8/10 based on 338 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"Thanks to a script that emphasizes its heroes' humanity and a wealth of superpowered set pieces, \"The Avengers\" lives up to its hype and raises the bar for Marvel at the movies.\" On Metacritic, the film achieved an average score of 69 out of 100 based on 43 reviews, signifying \"generally favorable reviews\". CinemaScore reported that audiences gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade, the first superhero film to earn that grade.\n\nTodd McCarthy of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" gave a positive review of the film, remarking, \"It's clamorous, the save-the-world story is one everyone's seen time and again, and the characters have been around for more than half a century in 500 comic book issues. But Whedon and his cohorts have managed to stir all the personalities and ingredients together so that the resulting dish, however familiar, is irresistibly tasty again.\" To \"Rolling Stone\" journalist Peter Travers, the film epitomized an exceptional blockbuster. \"It's also the blockbuster,\" Travers said, \"I saw in my head when I imagined a movie that brought together the idols of the Marvel world in one shiny, stupendously exciting package. It's \"Transformers\" with a brain, a heart and a working sense of humor.\" Justin Chang of \"Variety\" wrote, \"Like a superior, state-of-the-art model built from reconstituted parts, Joss Whedon's buoyant, witty and robustly entertaining superhero smash-up is escapism of a sophisticated order, boasting a tonal assurance and rich reserves of humor that offset the potentially lumbering and unavoidably formulaic aspects of this 143-minute team-origin story.\" Kenneth Turan of the \"Los Angeles Times\" complimented the film's frenetic pace, while Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" commented that it \"provides its fans with exactly what they desire. Whether it is exactly what they deserve is arguable\". Conversely, A. O. Scott of \"The New York Times\" believed that \"while \"The Avengers\" is hardly worth raging about, its failures are significant and dispiriting. The light, amusing bits cannot overcome the grinding, hectic emptiness, the bloated cynicism that is less a shortcoming of this particular film than a feature of the genre.\"\n\nThe performances of several cast members was a frequent topic in the critiques. In particular, Mark Ruffalo's portrayal of Dr. Bruce Banner/the Hulk was well received by commentators. Joe Neumaier opined that his performance was superior to the rest of the cast; \"Ruffalo is the revelation, turning Banner into a wry reservoir of calm ready to become a volcano.\" Similarly, \"The New Yorker\" Anthony Lane proclaimed Ruffalo's acting to be one of the film's highlights—alongside Downey. \"The Village Voice\" Karina Longworth concluded: \"Ruffalo successfully refreshes the Hulk myth, playing Banner as an adorably bashful nerd-genius who, in contrast to the preening hunks on the team, knows better than to draw attention to himself.\" Travers asserted that the actor resonated a \"scruffy warmth and humor\" vibe, while Turan felt that he surpassed predecessors Edward Norton and Eric Bana in playing the character. Owen Gleiberman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" wrote that \"the smartest thing the filmmakers did was to get Mark Ruffalo to play Bruce Banner as a man so sensitive that he's at war, every moment, with himself. (The film finally solves the Hulk problem: He's a lot more fun in small doses.)\"\n\nReferring to Downey, Joe Morgenstein of \"The Wall Street Journal\"—despite complimenting Downey's performance—favored his work in \"Iron Man\" over his acting in \"The Avengers\": \"His Iron Man is certainly a team player, but Mr. Downey comes to the party with two insuperable superpowers: a character of established sophistication—the industrialist/inventor Tony Stark, a sharp-tongued man of the world—and his own quicksilver presence that finds its finest expression in self-irony.\" Neumaier praised Evans, stating that he accurately conveyed his character's internal conflicts.\n\nCommentators appreciated the character development and dialogue. Associated Press reviewer Christy Lemire wrote that the script \"sparkles as brightly as the special effects; these people may be wearing ridiculous costumes but they're well fleshed-out underneath.\" Scott suggested that certain parts of the film permeated a charm that he felt was similar to the western film \"Rio Bravo\" (1959). Longworth felt that while Whedon's script demonstrated the backstory of the characters, the film does not explore it \"in a substantive way\".\n\n\"The Avengers\" has garnered numerous awards and nominations, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Visual Effects and a British Academy Film Award nomination for Best Special Visual Effects. The film has also been nominated for three Critics' Choice Movie Awards, thirteen People's Choice Awards (winning three), eleven Teen Choice Awards (winning two), six Saturn Awards (winning four), and six VES Awards (winning two), as well as the 2013 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation Long Form.\n\nA sequel, titled \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\", written and directed by Whedon, was released on May 1, 2015. Much of the cast returns, with the addition of Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch, Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Quicksilver, Paul Bettany as Vision, and James Spader as Ultron.\n\n\"Avengers: Infinity War\" was directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, from a script by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, and was released on April 27, 2018. Much of the cast from the first two films return, with additional cast and characters joining from other MCU films, and Josh Brolin appearing as Thanos.\n\nAn untitled film, again directed by the Russo brothers from a script by Markus and McFeely, is scheduled for release on May 3, 2019.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6538507", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6538507", "title": "Tâb", "text": "Tâb\n\nTâb is the Egyptian name of a running-fight board game played in several Muslim (mostly Arab) countries, and a family of similar board games played in North Africa (as \"sîg\") and Western Asia, from Iran to West Africa and from Turkey to Somalia, where a variant called \"deleb\" is played. The rules and boards can vary widely across the region though almost all consist of boards with three or four rows. A reference to \"at-tâb wa-d-dukk\" (likely a similar game) occurs in a poem of 1310 CE.\n\nThe game described here was recorded by Edward William Lane in Egypt in the 1820s. \n\nEgyptian tâb is played by two players on a board, often delineated at the ground. The board is four squares wide, and usually an odd number of squares long, usually from 7 to 15, but formerly up to 29 squares. Numbering the four rows 1, 2, 3 and 4, from the start one player has one (nominally) white piece in each field of row 1, and the other a (nominally) black piece in each field of row 4. The pieces may be stones or made from burnt clay. In Egypt, the pieces are referred to as \"kelb\", meaning \"dog\".\n\nAs in the Ancient Egyptian game senet and the Korean game Yut, four sticks of a roughly semi-circular cross-section are used as dice. The flat sides are (nominally) white, and the rounded sides are (nominally) black. The value of a throw depends on the number of black and white sides showing, as indicated in the following table.\n\nFor each piece, the first move must be a tâb, which converts the piece from a \"Christian\" to a \"Muslim\" in addition to moving it one field ahead. Typically all initial tâbs are used to convert pieces, and only later are tâbs used for other purposes.\n\nThe pieces move as shown in the diagram, here shown for \"White\" starting in its home row A-I. The other player (\"Black\" starting in home row \"a-i\") moves in the same way, meaning that black and white pieces move in the same direction through each of the rows. When a white piece gets to square \"s\", White can choose to send the piece to \"a\" or back to K. However, a given piece can only go into its opponent's home row (for White, \"a-i\") once; the next time it must go back to K, thereafter merely circulating through the 2 middle rows. Once in its opponent's home row, a piece cannot move any further as long as there are any pieces left in its own home row. No piece ever returns to its own home row.\n\nA piece moving to a square occupied by one or more enemy pieces will knock those pieces off the board. A piece moving to a square occupied by one or more friendly pieces is placed on top of those, and they move as one piece thereafter. If such a stack moves to a row where one of the pieces has been before, the stack is reduced to just one piece, the other pieces being removed from the board. However, the player is not required to utilize a throw leading to such move. A tâb throw can be used to break up a stack so that the pieces move individually again.\n\nThe game continues till one player has lost all pieces, whereby the other player wins.\n\nA game position is not given by the position of all pieces only, but also by their pre-history, substantially complicating the game.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "16831542", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16831542", "title": "UK Rock Challenge", "text": "UK Rock Challenge\n\nThe UK Rock Challenge is the British arm of the Global Rock Challenge. The Rock Challenge is an anti-drug and crime-prevention that takes the form of a friendly performing arts competition for schools and colleges. Originating in Australia in the 1980s, it reached UK shores due to Inspector Mark Pontin of the Hampshire Constabulary seeing it in 1995 and being so impressed that he persuaded the Chief Constable of Hampshire Constabulary to form a joint venture with Tony Barron, Chairman of Hampshire Education Committee and Peter Coles the Chief Executive , Together they introduced it into their area of the UK and found joint funding to do so. The first UK event took place in Portsmouth Guildhall, Portsmouth in 1996 involving 11 schools and around 750 young people; since then, Rock Challenge has expanded into many areas across the UK; in 2016 there are 49 days of events.\n\nAll the events in the UK are funded by the Be Your Best Foundation (Registered Charity Number 1077291), a non-profit charity set up by the creators of the Rock Challenge in the UK who source funding for the events across the UK.'\n\nThe premise of the Rock Challenge is that each school puts together an 8-minute dance and drama production on a theme of their choice set to a soundtrack of commercially available music. Over the course of months/weeks schools create their production and finally bring it to an event day held at a professional venue where they spend the day rehearsing and preparing for an evening show where parents, peers, community members, and invited guests attend. During the evening, a panel of judges give verbal feedback on each performance and also score each piece based on strict criteria. Performances are judged on:\n\nPerformance Judge\nMarks:\n\nProduction Judge\nMarks:\n\nDrama and Design Judge\nMarks:\n\nEach judge also gives the performance a mark for 'Overall Impact' out of 5.\n\nAt the end of the evening a prize ceremony is held where a number of awards are presented along with the announcement of the top-scoring schools.\n\nThe core message of the Be Your Best Rock Challenge is to show young people how they can achieve a 'natural high' on life rather than with the use of drugs, alcohol and tobacco - the concept is that through participation in the event at a professional venue with a professional production and technical crew, the students are helped in the belief that they can achieve a high on life rather than relying on substances. This is emphasised during the event where everyone is warned that if anyone is caught smoking, taking drugs or drinking alcohol the individual/s concerned will be asked to leave and their team will be deducted two overall ranking places (making it impossible for them to win or go further in the competition).\n\nParticipation in the Rock Challenge has shown to have many positive effects on participants, schools, and communities, including:\n\n\nRock Challenge has been running in the UK since 1996 (see above) and has been running as the Rock Eisteddfod Challenge in Australia since 1980 (see History in Rock Eisteddfod Challenge page) and has reached out across the world to New Zealand (Stage Challenge), Japan (Rock Challenge Japan), Germany, South Africa (ARA Be Your Best Rock Challenge) and UAE (set up by the British Be Your Best Rock Challenge). Rock Challenge also had a short and small stay in the US, but there has been no known activity since the confirmation of two events for 2004.\n\nJust like in the UK, since its inception in Australia the events have grown in popularity, so much that the National Finals are shown on the Nine Network over a period of weeks on a Saturday Morning (after being previously recorded live). This television coverage has been happening since the early 1990s, but since the UK launch in 1996 it still does not have any major media coverage there.\n\nThe most famous participant of Rock Challenge in the UK was the actress Emma Watson from the Harry Potter franchise. She participated twice, once in 2006 and once as the Rock Challenge leader in 2007 with her school in Oxford.\n\nRock Challenge is split into 2 age brackets:\n\nJunior Rock Challenge\nThe Junior Rock Challenge started in the UK in 2005 for participants aged 7–11. Many Junior Rock Challenges events are not full competitions based on the desires of the local schools and sponsors.\n\nRock Challenge\nRock Challenge is for participants aged 11–18. As of 2004, Rock Challenge has been split into 2 competition divisions; the Open and the Premier divisions: \nIn the 'Open' Division:\n\nIn the 'Premier' Division:\n\nFrom 2007, National Awards have also been awarded, judged nationally by a panel of judges new and independent from those at the live events, announcing each division's top schools in each criteria.\n\nScottish Grand Final\nAs of 2012, schools participating in Scottish events will compete at heats for a place in the Scottish Grand Final held in Dundee. Should a school win the Scottish Grand Final two years in succession they will be given the option of competing in the Northern Region Premier Division for the following year. Should a school win the Scottish Grand Final three years in succession they will be automatically moved into the Northern Region Premier Grand Final for the following year.\n\nNational Grand Final\nIn 2009 the UK's first National Grand Final was held at the Sheffield Arena. This consisted of the top 5 schools from each Premier Final along with the top scoring first place from the Open finals (one from the North and one from the South) giving twelve schools: Sandown High School from Sandown, Isle of Wight won this event with their performance 'Cursed' after winning their Open Grand Final.\n\nIn 2012 the second UK Rock Challenge National Grand Final was held at the Milton Keynes Theatre, Milton Keynes: Kings Langley School, Hertfordshire won this event with their performance entitled 'Swift as a shadow short as any dream.'.\n\nSince 1996, the Tour has been to many venues around the country and as Rock Challenge has become larger, so have the venues. Even just in the first year it grew from one night and one event to 8 venues and 11 nights.\n\nWith the planned National Grand Final, it would bring the biggest ever venue ever used by the Rock Challenge team in the UK, The Sheffield Arena with a capacity up to 12,500 seated (downgraded to 4000 seats for Final).\n\nAs of 2012 the events will have taken place in the following towns/cities across the UK:\n\n• Aberdeen\n• Arbroath\n• Basingstoke\n• Belfast\n• Bournemouth\n• Bradford\n• Brighton\n• Carlisle\n• Crawley\n• Croydon\n• Derby\n• Dundee\n• Eastbourne\n• Grantham\n• Grimsby\n• Hackney\n• Hemel Hempstead\n• Hull\n• Inverness\n• Leeds\n• Lincoln\n• London (central)\n• Manchester\n• Margate\n• Milton Keynes\n• North Finchley\n• Portsmouth\n• Reading\n• Rotherham\n• Sheffield\n• Skegness\n• Southampton\n• St Albans\n• Stevenage\n• York\n\nThe Be Your Best Foundation is always looking for sponsorship, because they are a charity and this sponsor helps to put on the events. There is a wide range of sponsors, but not as internationally known as the Australian sponsorship is (like Calvin Klein for one). In certain areas where the Rock Challenge is there is major backing and sponsorship from the local police force (partly because the introduction to the UK was with the backing of the Hampshire Constabulary). The One Network Radio stations like Heart FM(formerly known as 2CR FM), Southern FM, Chiltern Radio are also sponsors in their area and this way the Rock Challenge also some times use local presenters from the Radio Stations. Other Radio stations which are not owned by The One Network are also used for sponsorship (for example both from the Yorkshire Radio Network: The Pulse & Viking FM; Independently owned Lincolnshire based Lincs FM and finally Belfast's Downtown Radio).\nOther campaigns for good health, to tackle drugs & alcohol and to promote a better community also appear in the sponsorship. Just like the Police forces in Rock Challenge tour areas, all the local city and borough councils promote the Rock Challenge (but in the London area there is no definitive sponsorship or backing from the Police or city council).\nFor the Finals, the sponsorship changes slightly because all the finals are presented by the insurance company Ansvar insurance (which ironically has an Australian parent company) which is a company which helps non-profit organizations and individuals like Charities, helping by investing in certain organizations which work firstly and foremostly in alcohol and drug education (Ansvar Insurance (UK) Website).\nIn the early announcements over the 2009 national finals it has been said that the success of the event is down highly to the sponsorship gained, to help the staging of the biggest event yet.\n\nSince its inception in 1996, many UK Rock Challenge events have taken place up and down the nation; below is a full chronological list of results (announced places) from the very first event to the present day:\n\n1996 Be Your Best Rock Challenge\n\nPortsmouth Guildhall, Portsmouth, Hampshire\n\nAwards:\n1997 Be Your Best Croydon Rock Challenge\n\nAshcroft Theatre, Croydon, Surrey\nWednesday, 26 February\n\nAwards:\n1997 Get Real Be Your Best Portsmouth Rock Challenge Day One\nPortsmouth Guildhall, Portsmouth, Hampshire\nTuesday, 4 March\n\nAwards:\n1997 Get Real Be Your Best Portsmouth Rock Challenge Day Two\nPortsmouth Guildhall, Portsmouth, Hampshire\nThursday, 5 March\nAwards:\n1997 Get Real 2CR FM Be Your Best Bournemouth Rock Challenge\nBournemouth Pavilion, Bournemouth, Dorset\nFriday, 7 March\n\nAwards:\n1997 Get Real 2-Ten FM Be Your Best Basingstoke Rock Challenge\nThe Anvil Theatre, Basingstoke, Hampshire\nWednesday, 12 March\n\nAwards:\n1997 Get Real Be Your Best Southampton Rock Challenge\nSouthampton Guildhall, Southampton, Hampshire\nFriday, 14 March\nAwards:\n1997 Lifestyle Be Your Best Hull Rock Challenge\nHull New Theatre, Hull\nWednesday, 19 March\nAwards:\n1997 Be Your Best Fox FM Oxford Rock Challenge\nApollo Theatre, Oxford, Oxfordshire\nFriday, 11 April\n\nAwards:\n1997 Be Your Best The Pulse Bradford Rock Challenge\nSt George's Hall, Bradford, West Yorkshire\nMonday, 14 April\n\nAwards:\n1997 Be Your Best The Pulse Rock Challenge Northern Grand Final\nSt George's Hall, Bradford, West Yorkshire\nTuesday, 15 April\nAwards:\n1997 Be Your Best Get Real Rock Challenge Southern Grand Final\nPortsmouth Guildhall, Portsmouth, Hampshire\nThursday, 17 April\nAwards:\n\n1998 Get Real 2-Ten FM Be Your Best Basingstoke Rock Challenge\nThe Anvil, Basingstoke, Hampshire\nTuesday, 2 March\nAwards:\n1998 Get Real Be Your Best Southampton Rock ChallengeSouthampton Guildhall, Southampton, HampshireThursday, 5 March\nAwards:\n1998 Get Real 2CR FM Be Your Best Bournemouth Rock ChallengeBournemouth Pavilion, Bournemouth, DorsetFriday, 6 March\nAwards:\n1998 Get Real Be Your Best Portsmouth Rock Challenge Day OnePortsmouth Guildhall, Portsmouth, HampshireMonday, 9 March\nAwards:\n1998 Get Real Be Your Best Portsmouth Rock Challenge Day TwoPortsmouth Guildhall, Portsmouth, HampshireTuesday, 10 March\nAwards:\n1998 Lifestyle Be Your Best Hull Rock ChallengeHull New Theatre, HullTuesday, 17 March\nAwards:\n1998 Be Your Best The Pulse Leeds Rock ChallengeLeeds Grand Theatre, Leeds, West YorkshireFriday, 20 March\nAwards:\n1998 Lifestyle Be Your Best Grimsby Rock Challenge Grimsby Auditorium, Grimsby, North East Lincolnshire Tuesday, 24 March\nAwards:\n1998 Be Your Best Fox FM Oxford Rock ChallengeApollo Theatre, Oxford, OxfordshireThursday, 26 March\nAwards:\n1998 Be Your Best Brighton Rock ChallengeThe Dome, BrightonFriday, 27 March\nAwards:\n1998 Be Your Best Rock Challenge Southern Grand FinalPortsmouth Guildhall, Portsmouth, HampshireTuesday, 31 March\nAwards:\n1998 Lifestyle Be Your Best Grimsby Rock ChallengeGrimsby Auditorium, Grimsby, North East LincolnshireTuesday, 24 March\nAwards:\n\n1999 Get Real Be Your Best Power FM Portsmouth Rock Challenge Day One\n\nPortsmouth Guildhall, Portsmouth, Hampshire\nMonday 1 February\n\n1st Place\nCowes High School, Cowes, Isle of Wight\n2nd Place\nPark Community School, Leigh Park, Hampshire\n3rd Place\nStaunton Park Community School, Havant, Hampshire\n\n1999 Get Real Be Your Best Power FM Portsmouth Rock Challenge Day Two\n\nPortsmouth Guildhall, Portsmouth, Hampshire\nTuesday 2 February\n\n1st Place\nKing Richard Secondary School Team Two, Portsmouth, Hampshire -

{"id": "1061167", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1061167", "title": "Verse drama and dramatic verse", "text": "Verse drama and dramatic verse\n\nVerse drama is any drama written as verse to be spoken; another possible general term is poetic drama. For a very long period, verse drama was the dominant form of drama in Europe (and was also important in non-European cultures). Greek tragedy and Racine's plays are written in verse, as is almost all of Shakespeare's drama, Ben Jonson, John Fletcher and others like Goethe's \"Faust\".\n\nVerse drama is particularly associated with the seriousness of tragedy, providing an artistic reason to write in this form, as well as the practical one that verse lines are easier for the actors to memorize exactly. In the second half of the twentieth century verse drama fell almost completely out of fashion with dramatists writing in English (the plays of Christopher Fry and T. S. Eliot being possibly the end of a long tradition).\n\nDramatic verse occurs in a dramatic work, such as a play, composed in poetic form. The tradition of dramatic verse extends at least as far back as ancient Greece.\n\nThe English Renaissance saw the height of dramatic verse in the English-speaking world, with playwrights such as Ben Jonson, Christopher Marlowe and William Shakespeare developing new techniques, both for dramatic structure and poetic form. Though a few plays, such as \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", feature extended passages of rhymed verse, the majority of dramatic verse is composed as blank verse; there are also passages of prose.\n\nDramatic verse began to decline in popularity in the nineteenth century, when the prosaic and conversational styles of playwrights such as Henrik Ibsen became more prevalent, and were adapted in English by George Bernard Shaw. Verse drama did have a role in the development of Irish theatre.\n\nAn important trend from around 1800 was the closet drama: a verse drama intended to be read from the page, rather than performed. Lord Byron and Shelley, as well as a host of lesser figures, devoted much time to the closet drama, in a signal that the verse tragedy was already in a state of obsolescence. That is, while poets of the eighteenth century could write so-so poetic dramas, the public taste for new examples was already moving away by the start of the nineteenth century, and there was little commercial appeal in staging them.\n\nInstead, opera would take up verse drama, as something to be sung: it is still the case that a verse libretto can be successful. Verse drama as such, however, in becoming closet drama, became simply a longer poetic form, without the connection to practical theatre and performance. \n\nAccording to Robertson Davies in \"A Voice From the Attic\", closet drama is \"Dreariest of literature, most second hand and fusty of experience!\". But indeed a great deal of it was written in Victorian times, and afterwards, to the extent that it became a more popular long form at least than the faded epic. Prolific in the form were, for example, Michael Field and Gordon Bottomley.\n\nDramatic poetry is any poetry that uses the discourse of the characters involved to tell a story or portray a situation. \n\nThe major types of dramatic poetry are those already discussed, to be found in plays written for the theatre, and libretti. There are further dramatic verse forms: these include dramatic monologues, such as those written by Robert Browning and Alfred Tennyson and William Shakespeare.\n\n\n"}
