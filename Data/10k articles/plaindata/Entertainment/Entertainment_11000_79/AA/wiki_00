{"id": "23048910", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23048910", "title": "Asas '50", "text": "Asas '50\n\nThe Writers' Movement '50 (Angkatan Sasterawan 1950), better known as Asas '50, is the first and oldest literary association in post-war Malaya and the Malay region. Founded on 6 August 1950, Asas '50 represented the voice of the Malay community and used literature as the ideal thrust towards the independence of Malaya in 1957. The association's philosophy of \"Art for Society\" (Seni untuk Masyarakat) formed the main shaping force in the development of Modern Malay literature. The literary body was pioneered by Muhammad Ariff Ahmad (MAS), Kamaluddin Muhammad (Keris Mas), Abdul Wahab Muhammad (Awam-il Sarkam), Abdul Jalil Haji Nor (Merayu Rawan), Munir Ali (Rosmera), Kumasi Haji Dainuri (Teruna Jaya), Abdul Majid Husain (Hamzah), Masuri Salikun (Masuri S.N), Abu Yamin Kasun, Ahmad Ramli Abdul Karim (Ramlimah), Muhammad Daud, Abu Yazid Abidin (Wijaya Mala) and Muhammad Yusof Yaacob (Jim).\n\nAsas '50 was dedicated in the development of literature. It held the belief that literature is an integral part of the society. Asas '50 currently works to promote and propagate literature through seminars, workshops, forums, dialogues, courses etc.\n\nOne of the landmark events in the early history of ASAS 50 was the debate on the purpose of literature. The debate was between two groups, the \"Utusan Melayu\" group, headed by Asraf and the \"Majalah Hiburan\" group headed by Hamzah Hussien. The crux of the debate was whether to follow \"Art for Society\" (Seni untuk Masyarakat) or \"Art for Art's Sake\" (Seni untuk Seni). According to a researcher, Athi Sivan (1997), Hamzah propagated the Gautierian call for purity of art to distance Asas 50 from the left wing ideologies prevalent at that time in Singapore, especially in \"Utusan Melayu\". This ensued the debate and it lasted more than a year before slowly fading away with Hamzah leaving Asas 50 to form a new literary organisation. After this debate, ASAS 50 became less active after 1955, when several of its main members (Keris Mas, Usman Awang, etc.) left to reside back in Malaya, while several loyal members remained in Singapore and continued to spearhead the association to this day.\n\nThe philosophy held by Asas '50 was described by Keris Mas as follows:\n\nIn the field of literature, the proponents of ASAS 50 adopted a new breathe of style, employing a mode of language that is fresh, departing from the preceding genre of writers, propounding the themes of societal awareness, politics and culture with the aim of revitalising the spirit of freedom, the spirit of independence of a people (bangsa) of its own unique sense of honour and identity, upholding justice and combating oppression. \n\n... We criticised societal backwardness and those whom we regard as the instruments responsible for the birth of such backwardness. We criticised colonialism and its instruments, that is, the elite class, those whose consciousness have been frozen by the influence of feudalism and myths, and superstition that has been enmeshed with religion.\nAsas '50 plays a role in the development of literature and language in the region. They are led by Mohamed Pitchay Gani (President), Mohamed Latiff Mohamed (Deputy President), Yazid Hussein (Vice-President), Abdul Samad Ali (Secretary), Hoirull Amri Tahiran (Secretary 2), Muhammad Herwanto Johari (Head of Youth and Head of Programmes), Namira Mazlan (Head of IT) and Irwan Jamal (Head of Publications).\n\nWith the motto \"Seni Untuk Masyarakat\" (Arts for the People), it was inspired by the Indonesian writers movement, \"Angkatan 45\", and has been described as a watershed moment for the development of Malay literature in the region. Seen as an angry young men movement, it promoted several aims:\n\nAn attempt initiated by Asas '50 to absorb the splinter literary groups such as Grup Gelorasa and Pass into Asas '50 was carried out in 1974. A new slogan \"Literature for the Community\" was coined to provide a mutual understanding and mission amongst the new members of Asas '50. The slogan was generic and did not have any ideological leanings of any the other previous associations. Thus, the slogan is accepted by all the new members of Asas '50. However, the battleground has changed for Asas '50 as it was no longer fighting for the independence and physical extrication of the community. This time, Asas '50 stated aim is to free the community from psychological and intellectual oppression left behind during the reign of the colonial masters and the Japanese Occupation. 'Independence' was superficial as the community still glorified the masters to the point of diminishing and trivialising their very own identity. Asas '50's mission is still schooled in the concept of \"Literature for the Community\" even though it has since changed its slogan.\n\nAsas '50's contributed significantly towards the development of the Malay language and was described by kakiseni.com as \nthe movement that championed the use and development of the Malay language \nIt was described by Kakiseni.com as The thousands of literary works written in Malay exhibited a diverse form of writing styles as well as the use of contemporary terms to explain a certain phenomena experienced by the community at that point in time lay as a testament of Asas '50's success. In addition, a number of Asas '50 members are teachers and journalists.\n\nA significant and historic contribution made by Asas '50 was the introduction of the Roman script to Malay. The Jawi writing was initially the modus operandi. However, since the 3rd Malay Language Congress (Kongres Bahasa ke-3) in 1956 and under the initiation of Asas '50, Maritime Southeast Asia saw a reformation and revolution in the Malay language arena. As a result, Roman spelling was integrated into Malay and this has remained till today. This change simplifies the learning as Roman spelling is also used in the English language. Research and study of materials and sources from the West to be used by the locals were thus made more accessible and decipherable. Roman spelling has since eclipsed the use of Jawi in daily matters and in education. Only Brunei still practices the use of Jawi.\n\nAsas '50 is the first registered Malay literary association and it is also the first to begin a literary culture rooted as the social protest or the social critic. The association is also responsible in the push towards independence for Malaya in the 1950s and the changes made to the Malay language via the 3rd Malay Language Congress (Kongres Bahasa ke-3). In the 1970s, Asas '50 initiated the Malay Literary Prize (Hadiah Sastera) which is now known as the Malay Literary Award (Anugerah Persuratan). This enabled the works and efforts of writers to be recognised and appreciated. Asas'50 was also recognised as the first Malay literary body in the region to hold the Regional Malay Literati Conference (Pertemuan Sasterawan Nusantara) in 1977. This has since been integrated and adopted as bi-annual event for the Malay literary scene in this region.\n\nThe association is the first Malay association to have sealed a Memorandum of Understanding with the National Library Board (NLB). In addition, Asas '50 has also published \"Leksikon\", a comprehensive directory, complete with detailed descriptions, of 70 reputed writers in Singapore from 1965 to 2005. The launch of \"Leksikon\" also immortalised Asas '50 as the first association to have held an event at the new NLB building at Victoria Street.\n\nAsas '50 has been the country's official representative in learning the development of the Malay literature in the region. The association works arm in arm with regional literary associations such as Gapena (Malaysia), Asterawani (Brunei), Horisons (Indonesia) and others. Many of its members are also involved in activities organised and held by the Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka (DBP), Mastera and Mabbim.\n\nSince its inception, the crux of Asas '50 has always been formed by a group of young and dedicated writers who are passionate in understanding the struggles of the community. These young writers are usually at their most productive and prolific as they continue their search for their own identities and self. The Asas '50 youth wing was started in 2002 to shape the next generation of leaders and activists in the Malay literary scene. This aim was strongly advocated by Masuri S.N, who believed that the strength of an association is reliant on the youths, who will eventually receive the baton to carry the association into the next phase of its mission. The younger members Asas '50 mainly comprises the trainee teachers of the National Institute of Education Townsville Campus. Today, a number of these members are appointment holders in the association's executive committee.\n\nTo date, Asas '50 publishes a variety of books. A number of these publications however were only produced in the early 2000s. However, there were already books published independently by members of Asas '50. Among the publications was the 2005 release of Abdul Ghani Hamid's \"Petikan Rasa/Extracts of Feelings\". Funded by National Arts Council via the Singapore Cultural Medallion Grant, the book was a bilingual compilation of Abdul Ghani Hamid's poems and paintings. Another book published by Asas '50 was \"Memoir Perjalanan Mas\" in 2004. This historical biography of Muhammad Ariff Ahmad depicted the life and struggles of Mas. The importance of this book lies in the involvement of Muhammad Ariff Ahmad in the Malay culture, language and literary arena. Inadvertently, this book has become the unofficial documentation of the Malay literary movement history in Singapore.\n\nThe publishing of the first Malay writer's directory called Leksikon was a collaborative effort with the NLB, and it was the first of its kind in the Singapore Malay literature. Detailed information of the creative writers in Singapore since 1965, is available in this book. Another one for the history books is the association's publication of an anthology of poems and short stories called \"Menyongsong Pelangi\" in 2005. This anthology comprises literary works contributed by young writers alike and is released in commemoration of Asas '50's 55 years celebration.\n\nAsas '50 has played a part in the early Malay film industry. Films by P. Ramlee were influenced by Asas '50 as the objectives of those films mirrored those of the association's. There were also connections and friendships linking P.Ramlee to Asas '50. For example, Asraf's wife, Fatimah Murad, was the editor of P.Ramlee's film magazine called the \"Majalah Bintang.\" Thus, Asraf capitalised on this avenue and network to inject the ideologies held by Asas '50 as well as to trade views and opinions with P.Ramlee. Historical film enthusiasts and observers have recognised the film \"Bujang Lapok\" to breathe the same ideologies as that of Asas '50. The film is said to contain satirical stabs at the community at that point in time. An obvious trait prevalent in these films was the use of the actors' real name such as \"Ramlee\", \"Sudin\" and \"Aziz.\" This was P.Ramlee's method of highlighting the emotional aspect and the reality that shrouded the community of yesteryear.\n\nThe local newspaper has also held the principle of \"Literature for the Community\" by publishing literary works that speak of the latest phenomena and dilemma faced by the community all through the years. These poems, shorts stories, essays etc. unearthed the ills of the community from the social, religious, political and economical perspectives. In fact, the number of literary works published in the local newspaper totalled 3,200 from 1,600 writers as of 1965. This reception has made Singapore Malay literature synonymous with the term \"newspaper literature (sastera akhbar).\" Inadvertently, Asas '50's mission was propagated and proliferated by the local newspaper which had the same ideologies as the literary association.\n\nThe NLB has recognised Asas '50 as the ideal resource and reference pool for its \"Singapore Literary Pioneers Gallery\" and NLB Online Repository of Artistic Works (NORA) projects. This includes a database collection of Malay writers and manuscripts. Another project piloted by NLB and Asas '50 was the \"Potret Tun Seri Lanang.\" In this project, Asas '50 acted as the middleman in obtaining the literary works of the Tun Sri Lanang award winners, which included books, publications, private collections and others. These will then be displayed at the special collections section of the NLB.\n\nThe part played by Asas '50 in the growth, development and progress of the Malay literature span a wide scope and has impacted the community intrinsically. The association has consistently upheld its mission and vision of \"Literature for the Community\" with utmost integrity and responsibility. Asas '50 has spearheaded a myriad of initiatives to preserve the image of the community, country and that of the writer himself. From its battle towards independence for Malaya to its inexorable aim of uniting the splinter Malay literary groups, Asas '50 has managed to form a united front under the manifesto \"Literature Develops Humanity.\" The climax of Asas '50 achievements is manifested in the installation of the Malay Literary Prize (Hadiah Sastera), which inevitably raised the status and stature of writers in our societal mould.\n\n\n"}

AHI’s first major accomplishment was \"Historieta Bajo Tierra\" (Underground Comics), a convention that brought together the entire Argentine indie comics community. Building on the success of this event, AHI bought a stand at Fantabaires in 1998 to nurture the previously nonexistent indie comics market. Other accomplishments included putting a common logo on the covers of member comics and organizing events to display and disseminate good new works.\n\nAHI kept growing in 1998 as new offices popped up throughout the country. AHI held its first national meeting in the \"Che\" Plaza of Rosario, Argentina. At this event, members reaffirmed their commitment to collectively producing independent comics. Furthermore, many participants said that for the first time, they felt truly Argentine.\n\nIn 1999, irreconcilable differences emerged between certain constituents. One group split from AHI and formed independent publishing collective La Productora. Maintaining informal connections throughout the country and putting national aspirations of earlier years on the backburner, AHI-Rosario emerged as the strongest group to continue the AHI tradition. Entrance into AHI-Rosario is open to all dedicated to publishing independent comics and related materials. In self-publishing, AHI celebrates the freedom of expression, complete individual creator control over material and the close relationship of the creator to the final product. Their goals include supporting indie creators in producing and distributing their works.

{"id": "23126579", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23126579", "title": "Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines", "text": "Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines\n\nAssassin's Creed: Bloodlines is an action-adventure video game for PlayStation Portable, part of the \"Assassin's Creed\" franchise, taking place in between the events of \"Assassin's Creed\" and \"Assassin's Creed II\". The game was developed by Ubisoft Montreal in conjunction with Griptonite Games and published by Ubisoft, it was released on November 17, 2009 in North America and November 20, 2009 in Europe, concurrently with \"Assassin's Creed II\" and \"\".\n\nOn June 2, 2009, at their E3 Conference, Sony announced \"Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines\" for the PlayStation Portable with a release date of November 17, 2009.\n\n\"Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines\" is an action-adventure, stealth game set in an open world environment. Contains similar, almost the same, gameplay to \"Assassin's Creed\" in terms of control style, although there were minor modifications to the control scheme, due to the lack of specific keys and buttons. Some features from the previous game, such as Eagle Vision, were removed for the improvement of the controls. Due to the system platform, the AI has been seen as somewhat inferior when compared to the first game, making combat easier and simpler. A minor addition was featured in the combat aspect of the game, allowing players to instantly assassinate a target when they are downed in combat.\n\nAnother difference between the two games is the amount of civilians present on the street. While the first game was filled with random civilians, Bloodlines has little to no civilians, explained in-game that the civilians were in a constant state of insecurity due to the new system of governance. Still, civilians will react to Altaïr's improper behavior, such as scaling buildings, and running around the streets.\n\nStealth in Bloodlines was downgraded, again for the reason of controls. Blending was downgraded, due to the system platform. Although scholars are still present in-game, Altaïr can no longer use them as a way to hide. Although Altaïr can still blend, it only acts as a way to safely bypass guards without raising suspicion. Scaling the side of buildings was made easier and faster, resulting in simpler animations, again, due to the system's inferiority. High and Low profile movements were still present in-game, though they were downgraded as well.\n\nTaking the place of flags, a new collectible featured in the game are Templar Coins that can be used to upgrade health bars, and the amount of damage a weapon can inflict. Three types of coins are present in game: Bronze, Silver and Gold, with Gold holding the highest value. Similar to the previous game, Side-missions are available to players, such as saving civilians from Templar soldiers and performing specific tasks for allies of the resistance. The variety of tasks has been expanded, such as delivering letters, and intercepting couriers. In return, Altaïr will receive coins as a reward, instead of assistance from previous groups, such as scholars and vigilantes.\n\nThe setting of this game was based on two areas: Limassol and Kyrenia. The look of the area is very similar to some of the cities in the first game, going as far as having the same atmosphere. Due to the small setting, Horseback riding was removed in Bloodlines. Like in the previous game, Altaïr can synchronize from high vantage points around the city in order to map out the city. Although the map itself is already drawn out, synchronizing will provide the locations of various side-missions.\n\nNew assassination techniques were featured in Bloodlines. Weapons from the previous game return in Bloodlines, such as Altaïr's sword, his hidden blade, throwing knives, and his fists. His usage of each of the weapons is very similar to the first Assassin's Creed. Assassinations are also similar to the first game, although the animation has been toned down to better fit the system. A new, yet very minor assassination technique has been added to the game, allowing Altaïr to pull opponents off of ledges, similar to \"Assassin's Creed II\".\n\nIn \"Bloodlines\", cut-scenes are played through preset dialogue, with the character models acting in preset motions and gestures. Unique gestures were only present in confrontations between boss characters, such as Moloch and the Dark Oracle. Subtitles were also added to the game. This enabled easier understanding of the game plot\n\nStory missions and assassinations were simplified and straightforward. As a replacement for eaves-dropping and pick-pocketing, missions were played in the same structure as \"Assassin's Creed II\", with Altaïr handling one task after another and slowly gathering vital information from both his allies and enemies as each mission was cleared.\n\nAn in-game achievement system is featured in Bloodlines, which rewards players with Templar coins. Achievements can be earned after performing specific tasks, such as killing a set number of soldiers in a specified order, and also collecting all of the Templar coins located throughout the game world. Despite all the downgrades, a new feature is also in this game that doesn't apply to the other games: Altaïr can now regain throwing knives by walking over his used ones. Since pick-pocketing was removed and was the only way to regain throwing knives in the first game, Altaïr can now re-use his throwing knives provided that: the knife he threw landed on the ground or an enemy; if the knife lands on water, Altaïr cannot retrieve them. Throwing knives may also be regained by interacting with the newly added knife box in the safehouses.\n\nBeginning shortly after the end of the first game, Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad learns of a plan of the remaining Templars to escape to Cyprus, and so infiltrates one of their strongholds in Acre to stop them from doing so. Although he does not succeed in this regard, he does defeat and capture Maria Thorpe, who attempted to avenge her former master, Robert de Sablé, who died at Altaïr's hands. Managing to charter a ship, Altaïr also heads to Cyprus in pursuit of the apple, with Maria in tow.\n\nOnce there, he learns of the presence of Armand Bouchart, who has succeeded Robert de Sablé, as Grand Master of the Templar Order. Altaïr also learns, and gains the assistance, of a resistance movement in the city opposed to the presence of the Templars, who, after purchasing the island from King Richard, have formed a repressive government to control the land and its people. He also learns of a Templar \"archive\", a trove of Templar knowledge and artifacts, hidden somewhere on the island. True to the way of the Assassins, Altaïr makes to both locate the archive and free Cyprus from Bouchart's grip, firstly by slaying his underlings: Frederick \"the Red\"; Moloch \"the Bull\"; Shalim and Shahar \"the Twins\", and the Dark Oracle \"the Witch,\" eventually confronting and defeating Bouchart at the archive, whose contents have been evacuated and relocated by Templar soldiers. Following Bouchart's death, the archive begins to collapse, but Altaïr manages to escape.\n\nThe game also details the relationship between Altaïr and Maria. At first, Maria is hostile and sarcastic towards Altaïr (in her own words, \"the man who spared my neck but ruined my life\"), but as the story develops, she gradually warms to the assassin who, despite her repeated escape attempts, repeatedly rescues her from harm and does not punish her. Eventually, she decides to assist Altaïr by killing a Templar mole in the resistance when he attempts to kill Altaïr and confronting Bouchart alongside him in the final battle, at this point having fallen in love with the assassin. After their escape from the Templar archive, the two of them decide to head east towards India.\n\n\"Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines\" features exclusive connectivity with the PlayStation 3's version of \"Assassin's Creed II\". It was revealed at the E3 2009 that by connecting a PSP to the PlayStation 3, six exclusive and unique weapons can be unlocked on \"Assassin's Creed II\" as well as on \"Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines\".\n\nThere are six unique weapons that are unlocked for use in \"Assassin's Creed II\" once each boss in \"Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines\" is defeated. Coins acquired in \"Bloodlines\" can be transferred over as Florins to \"Assassin's Creed II\". Vice versa, in \"Bloodlines\", extra health, the ability to block with the hidden blade, and the ability to shoot daggers can be unlocked from acquiring codex pages in \"Assassin's Creed II\".\n\n\"Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines\" has received mixed reviews from critics. It received a 5.5 from GameSpot which praised its sound-effects but heavily criticized the platforming, small areas and over-emphasis on combat neglecting other areas. However IGN gave it a 6.9 criticizing its repetitive sound effects as well as one dimensional combat but praising the game's visuals. GameSpy gave the game a 2.5 out of 5 praising its faithfulness to the series and its gameplay though heavily criticizing its environments, repetitive gameplay as well as poor script and voice-acting. GameZone's Louis Bedigian gave the game a 5.3/10, saying the game is \"Generic at best, Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines is a great example of what can be done on the PSP visually, but should in no way be considered an example of great gameplay.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "588564", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=588564", "title": "Authorial intent", "text": "Authorial intent\n\nIn literary theory and aesthetics, authorial intent refers to an author's intent as it is encoded in his or her work. Authorial intentionalism is the view, according to which an author's intentions should constrain the ways in which it is properly interpreted.\n\nNew Criticism, as espoused by Cleanth Brooks, W. K. Wimsatt, T. S. Eliot, and others, argued that authorial intent is irrelevant to understanding a work of literature. Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley argue in their essay \"The Intentional Fallacy\" that \"the design or intention of the author is neither available nor desirable as a standard for judging the success of a work of literary art\". The author, they argue, cannot be reconstructed from a writing—the text is the primary source of meaning, and any details of the author's desires or life are secondary. Wimsatt and Beardsley argue that even details about the work's composition or the author's intended meaning and purpose that might be found in other documents such as journals or letters are \"private or idiosyncratic; not a part of the work as a linguistic fact\" and are thus secondary to the trained reader's rigorous engagement with the text itself.\n\nWimsatt and Beardsley divide the evidence used in making interpretations of poetry (although their analysis can be applied equally well to any type of art) into three categories:\n\n\n\nThus, a text's internal evidence—the words themselves and their meanings—is open for literary analysis. External evidence—anything not contained within the text itself, such as statements made by the poet about the poem that is being interpreted—does not belong to literary criticism. Preoccupation with the authorial intent \"leads away from the poem.\" According to Wimsatt and Beardsley, a poem does not belong to its author but rather \"is detached from the author at birth and goes about the world beyond his power to intend about it or control it. The poem belongs to the public.\"\n\nIn psychoanalytic criticism, the author's biography and unconscious state were seen as part of the text, and therefore the author's intent could be revived from a literary text—although the intent might be an unconscious one.\n\nThe Cambridge School of contextualist hermeneutics, a position most elaborated by Quentin Skinner, in the first instances distinguishes linguistic meaning from speech-acts: that is to say, things which the performance of an utterance \"does\". Consider the following. Typically, the ceremony of marriage concludes upon the exchange of the utterance \"I do\". In such a case, to utter \"I do\" is not merely to report an internal disposition, but to perform an action, namely, to \"get\" married. The intended force of \"I do\" in such a circumstance is only ever retrievable through understanding something about the complex social activity of marriage. Indeed, to understand a speech-act is to understand what conventions are regulating its significance. Since actions are always publicly legible—they are done by the speech itself—this presupposes no knowledge about the author's mental states. The task is always thus: with as much contextual information as possible, can we establish which conventions a text was interacting with, and by inference to the best explanation, what the author's intent was.\n\nIn post-structuralism, there are a variety of approaches to authorial intent. For some of the theorists deriving from Jacques Lacan, and in particular theories variously called \"écriture féminine\", gender and sex predetermine the ways that texts will emerge, and the language of textuality itself will present an argument that is potentially counter to the author's conscious intent.\n\nFor Marxist literary theorists, the author's intent is always a code for a particular set of ideologies in the author's own day. For Marxists (especially those of the Soviet realism type), authorial intent is manifest in the text and must be placed in a context of liberation and the materialist dialectic. However, Marxist-derived theorists have seen authorial intent in a much more nuanced way. Raymond Williams, for example, posits literary productions always within a context of emerging, resistant, and synthetic ideological positions. The author's intent is recoverable from the text, but there are always encoded within it several separate positions. The author might be arguing consciously for empire, but hidden within that argument will be a response to a counterargument and a presentation of an emerging synthesis. Some members of the reception theory group (Hans Robert Jauss, in particular) have approximated the Marxist view by arguing that the forces of cultural reception reveal the ideological positions of both author and readership.\n\nReader response critics view the authorial intent variously. In general, they have argued that the author's intent itself is immaterial and cannot be fully recovered. However, the author's intent will shape the text and limit the possible interpretations of a work. The reader's \"impression\" of the author's intent is a working force in interpretation, but the author's actual intent is not.\n\nWeak intentionalism combines intentionalism with insights from reader response. Mark Bevir in \"The Logic of the History of Ideas\" sees meanings as necessarily intentional but suggests that the relevant intentions can be those of readers as well as those of authors. Weak intentionalists privilege intentionality to emphasize that texts do not have meanings in themselves. They believe that meanings are always meanings for people—albeit the relevant people, whether authors or readers.\n\nAuthorial intention is of great practical concern to some textual critics. These are known as intentionalists and are identified with the Bowers-Tanselle school of thought. Their editions have as one of their most important goals the recovery of the author's intentions (generally final intentions). When preparing a work for the press, an editor working along the principles outlined by Fredson Bowers and G. Thomas Tanselle will attempt to construct a text that is close to the author's final intentions. For transcription and typesetting, authorial intentionality can be considered paramount.\n\nAn intentionalist editor would constantly investigate the documents for traces of authorial intention. On one hand, it can be argued that the author always intends whatever the author writes and that at different points in time the same author might have very different intentions. On the other hand, an author may in some cases write something he or she did not intend. For example, an intentionalist would consider for emendation the following cases:\n\n\nIn cases such as these where the author is living, they would be questioned by the editor who would then adhere to the intention expressed. In cases where the author is deceased, an intentionalist would attempt to approach authorial intention. The strongest voices countering an emphasis on authorial intent in scholarly editing have been D. F. McKenzie and Jerome McGann, proponents of a model that accounts for the \"social text,\" tracing material transformations and embodiments of works while not privileging one version over another.\n\n"}

{"id": "15673774", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15673774", "title": "Code of Practices for Television Broadcasters", "text": "Code of Practices for Television Broadcasters\n\nThe Code of Practices for Television Broadcasters, also known as the Television Code, was a set of ethical standards adopted by the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) for television programming from 1952 to 1983. The code was created to self-regulate the industry in hopes of avoiding a proposed government Advisory Board and satisfying parental concerns over violence and other matters. Prior to the Television Code, the 1935 NAB Code of Ethics for radio was applied to television but fewer than half of television stations subscribed to it; when the Television Code was first issued, two-thirds of stations became subscribers.\n\nThe code was first issued on December 6, 1951, and amended multiple times, especially in the wake of the 1950s quiz show scandals, Congressional hearings into violence (1952, 1954), and concern over the possible blurring of fact and fiction in early docudrama.\n\nThe code prohibited the use of profanity, the negative portrayal of family life, irreverence for God and religion, illicit sex, drunkenness and addiction, presentation of cruelty, detailed techniques of crime, the use of horror for its own sake, and the negative portrayal of law enforcement officials, among others. The code regulated how performers should dress and move to be within the \"bounds of decency\". Further, news reporting was to be \"factual, fair and without bias\" and commentary and analysis should be \"clearly defined as such\". Broadcasters were to make time available for religious broadcasting and were discouraged from charging religious bodies for access. Most importantly, it limited the commercial minutes per hour.\n\nIn 1973, responding to concerns raised by Action for Children's Television, the NAB revised the code to limit commercial time in children's programming to twelve minutes per hour. Additionally, the hosts of children's television programs were prohibited from appearing in commercials aimed at children. This became Section XIV “Time Standards for Non-Program Material”.\n\nThe Television Code rules were interpreted, monitored, and enforced by the Code Authority Director, who was appointed by the President of the NAB. The Code Authority interpreted the code by providing advice, publishing guidelines and amendments to clarify code provisions, and issuing rulings on specific programs or commercials, although most cases were resolved through negotiation rather than rulings. The main concern of code staff was commercials, not program content. The Code Authority had three offices in New York, Hollywood, and Washington D.C. and published a monthly newsletter, \"Code News\".\n\nThe Television Code provided for suspension and expulsion of subscribers as determined by the NAB Television Code Review Board whose members were subscribers to the Code and appointed by the NAB President. The Board checked compliance through a system of biannual monitoring backed up by complaint letters coming mostly from competing stations. Appeals of the Review Board’s decisions could be taken to the NAB Television Board of Directors. Compliance with the code was indicated by the \"Seal of Good Practice\", displayed during closing credits on most United States television programs, and on some US TV station sign-on and sign-offs from 1952 to the early 1970s.\n\nIn 1976, the code's program standards were suspended after a Los Angeles federal judge ruled that the Family Viewing Hour violated the First Amendment. In 1979, the Carter Justice Department challenged the code's Section XIV time standards limiting advertising on children's programming, alleging that they “represented an unlawful effort to restrict supply of commercial availabilities and hence drive up prices for these spots.” They then brought an antitrust action against the NAB. After a summary judgment was handed down against the NAB in 1982 partially striking down Section XIV, the NAB and the Reagan Justice Department entered into a consent decree abolishing the time standards and the industry-wide limitations on the number and length of commercials. Under further threats of legal action by the Justice Department on the grounds the code violated the First Amendment and Fairness Doctrine, the NAB decided to eliminate the remainder of the Television Code as well as the Radio Code in 1983.\n\nThe code paved the way for the development of the Broadcast Standards and Practices (BS&P) departments of the terrestrial broadcast networks (NBC, CBS, ABC) and most cable networks. After the Television Code’s demise and with the burden of self-regulation now falling to networks, the BS&P offices were forced to produce their own written codes which integrated some of the code’s concepts, recommendations, and rules.\n\nIn October 1990, the NAB Board of Directors issued a brief, simplistic “Statement of Principles of Radio and Television Broadcasters” that encourages broadcasters to “exercise responsible and careful judgment in the selection of material for broadcast.”\n\nA scholarly discussion titled \"Self-Regulation and the Media\" by Angela J. Campbell (1999) examines media self-regulation and concludes that \"Applying these five factors to digital television public interest responsibilities and privacy on the Internet, it concludes that self-regulation is not likely to be successful in these contexts.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7835738", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7835738", "title": "Combinatorial explosion", "text": "Combinatorial explosion\n\nIn mathematics, a combinatorial explosion is the rapid growth of the complexity of a problem due to how the combinatorics of the problem is affected by the input, constraints, and bounds of the problem. Combinatorial explosion is sometimes used to justify the intractability of certain problems. Examples of such problems include certain mathematical functions, the analysis of some puzzles and games, and some pathological examples which can be modelled as the Ackermann function.\n\nA Latin square of order is an array with entries from a set of elements with the property that each element of the set occurs exactly once in each row and each column of the array. An example of a Latin square of order three is given by,\nA common example of a Latin square would be a completed Sudoku puzzle. A Latin square is a combinatorial object (as opposed to an algebraic object) since only the arrangement of entries matters and not what the entries actually are. The number of Latin squares as a function of the order (independent of the set from which the entries are drawn) provides an example of combinatorial explosion as illustrated by the following table.\n\nA combinatorial explosion can also occur in some puzzles played on a grid, such as Sudoku. A Sudoku is a type of Latin square with the additional property that each element occurs exactly once in sub-sections of size (called \"boxes\"). Combinatorial explosion occurs as increases, creating limits to the properties of Sudokus that can be constructed, analyzed, and solved, as illustrated in the following table.\n\nOne example in a game where combinatorial complexity leads to a solvability limit is in solving chess (a game with 64 squares and 32 pieces). Chess is not a solved game. In 2005 all chess game endings with six pieces or fewer were solved, showing the result of each position if played perfectly. It took ten more years to complete the tablebase with one more chess piece added, thus completing a 7-piece tablebase. Adding one more piece to a chess ending (thus making an 8-piece tablebase) is considered intractable due to the added combinatorial complexity.\n\nFurthermore, the prospect of solving larger chess-like games becomes more difficult as the board-size is increased, such as in large chess variants, and infinite chess.\n\nCombinatorial explosion can occur in computing environments in a way analogous to communications and multi-dimensional space. Imagine a simple system with only one variable, a boolean called A. The system has two possible states, \"A\" = true or \"A\" = false. Adding another boolean variable \"B\" will give the system four possible states, \"A\" = true and \"B\" = true, \"A\" = true and \"B\" = false, \"A\" = false and \"B\" = true, \"A\" = false and \"B\" = false. A system with \"n\" booleans has 2 possible states, while a system of \"n\" variables each with Z allowed values (rather than just the 2 (true and false) of booleans) will have \"Z\" possible states.\n\nThe possible states can be thought of as the leaf nodes of a tree of height \"n\", where each node has \"Z\" children. This rapid increase of leaf nodes can be useful in areas like searching, since many results can be accessed without having to descend very far. It can also be a hindrance when manipulating such structures.\n\nA class hierarchy in an object-oriented language can be thought of as a tree, with different types of object inheriting from their parents. If different classes need to be combined, such as in a comparison (like \"A\" < \"B\") then the number of possible combinations which may occur explodes. If each type of comparison needs to be programmed then this soon becomes intractable for even small numbers of classes. Multiple inheritance can solve this, by allowing subclasses to have multiple parents, and thus a few parent classes can be considered rather than every child, without disrupting any existing hierarchy.\n\nAn example is a taxonomy where different vegetables inherit from their ancestor species. Attempting to compare the tastiness of each vegetable with the others becomes intractable since the hierarchy only contains information about genetics and makes no mention of tastiness. However, instead of having to write comparisons for carrot/carrot, carrot/potato, carrot/sprout, potato/potato, potato/sprout, sprout/sprout, they can all multiply inherit from a separate class of tasty whilst keeping their current ancestor-based hierarchy, then all of the above can be implemented with only a tasty/tasty comparison.\n\nSuppose we take the factorial for \"n\":\n\nformula_1\n\nThen 1! = 1, 2! = 2, 3! = 6, and 4! = 24. However, we quickly get to extremely large numbers, even for relatively small \"n\". For example, 100! = 9.33262154 × 10, a number so large that it cannot be displayed on most calculators, and vastly larger than the estimated number of fundamental particles in the Universe.\n\nIn administration and computing, a combinatorial explosion is the rapidly accelerating increase in communication lines as organizations are added in a process. (This growth is often casually described as \"exponential\" but is actually polynomial.)\n\nIf two organizations need to communicate about a particular topic, it may be easiest to communicate directly in an ad hoc manner—only one channel of communication is required. However, if a third organization is added, three separate channels are required. Adding a fourth organization requires six channels; five, ten; six, fifteen; etc.\n\nIn general, going on like that, it will take\nformula_2\ncommunication lines for \"n\" organizations, which is just the number of 2-combinations of \"n\" elements (see also binomial coefficient).\n\nThe alternative approach is to realize when this communication will not be a one-off requirement, and produce a generic or intermediate way of passing information. The drawback is that this requires more work for the first pair, since each must convert its internal approach to the common one, rather than the superficially easier approach of just understanding the other.\n\n"}
{"id": "1313722", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1313722", "title": "Costume design", "text": "Costume design\n\nCostume design is the investing of clothing and the overall appearance of a character or performer. Costume may refer to the style of dress particular to a nation, a class, or a period. In many cases, it may contribute to the fullness of the artistic, visual world which is unique to a particular theatrical or cinematic production. The most basic designs are produced to denote status, provide protection or modesty, or provide visual interest to a character. Costumes may be for a theater, cinema, or musical performance but may not be limited to such. Costume design should not be confused with costume coordination which merely involves altering existing clothing, although both create stage clothes.\n\nFour types of costumes are used in theatrical design: historical, fantastical, dance, and modern.\n\nVillage festivals and processions in honor of Dionysus (See also: Dionysia) amongst the ancient Greeks, are believed to be the origin of theatre, and therefore theatre costume. The sculpture and vase paintings provide the clearest evidence of this costume. Because of their ritualized style of theatre many masks were used giving each character a specific look and they varied depending if they were used for comedic or dramatic purposes. Some masks were constructed with a cheerful as well as a serious side on the same face in an attempt to indicate a change in emotion without a change of mask. The same is true for the Romans, who continued the mask tradition, which made the doubling of roles easier.\n\nDuring the late Middle Ages in Europe, dramatic enactments of Bible stories were prevalent, therefore actual Christian vestments, stylized from traditional Byzantine court dress, were worn as costumes to keep the performances as realistic as possible. Stereotypical characterization was key when clothing performers for this style of theatre. In most instances actors had to supply their own costumes when playing a character found in daily life.\n\nLater, in Elizabethan performance during the 1500-1600s in England, costume became the most important visual element. Garments were very expensive because only the finest fabrics were used. The majority of characters were clothed in Elizabethan fashion, otherwise the costumes could be divided into five categories; \n\"Ancient\", which was out of style clothing used to represent another period; \"Antique\", older additions to contemporary clothing to distinguish classical characters; Dreamlike, \"fanciful\" garments for supernatural or allegorical characters; \"Traditional\" clothing which represented only a few specific people, such as Robin Hood, or \"National or Racial\" costumes that were intended to set apart a specific group of people but did not tend to be historically accurate.\n\n\"Ordinarily, fashionable garments were used in both comedy and tragedy until 1727, when Adrienne Lecouvreur adopted the much more elaborate and formal court dress for tragedy. Her practice soon became standard for all tragic heroines\" Major actors began to compete with one another as to who would have the most lavish stage dress. This practice continued until around the 1750s when costumes became relevant to the character again. Art began to copy life and realistic characteristics were favored especially during the 19th century. For example, Georg the second, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen took personal interest in the theatre and began managing troupes. He advocated for authenticity and accuracy of the script and time period, therefore he refused to let actors tamper with their own costumes. He also made sure the materials were authentic and specific, using real chain mail, armor, swords, etc. No cheap substitutes would be allowed.\n\nIn August 1823, in an issue of \"The Album\", James Planché published an article saying that more attention should be paid to the time period of Shakespeare's plays, especially when it comes to costumes. In the same year, a casual conversation led to one of Planché's more lasting effects on British theatre. He observed to Charles Kemble, the manager of Covent Garden, that \"while a thousand pounds were frequently lavished upon a Christmas pantomime or an Easter spectacle, the plays of Shakespeare were put upon the stage with makeshift scenery, and, at the best, a new dress or two for the principal characters.\" Kemble \"saw the possible advantage of correct appliances catching the taste of the town\" and agreed to give Planché control of the costuming for the upcoming production of \"King John\", if he would carry out the research, design the costumes and superintend the production. Planché had little experience in this area and sought the help of antiquaries such as Francis Douce and Sir Samuel Meyrick. The research involved sparked Planché's latent antiquarian interests; these came to occupy an increasing amount of his time later in life.\n\nDespite the actors' reservations, \"King John\" was a success and led to a number of similarly-costumed Shakespeare productions by Kemble and Planché (\"Henry IV, Part I\", \"As You Like It\", \"Othello\", \"Cymbeline\", \"Julius Caesar\"). The designs and renderings of \"King John\", \"Henry IV\", \"As You Like It\", \"Othello\", \"Hamlet\" and \"Merchant of Venice\" were published, though there is no evidence that \"Hamlet\" and \"Merchant of Venice\" were ever produced with Planché’s historically accurate costume designs. Planché also wrote a number of plays or adaptations which were staged with historically accurate costumes (\"Cortez\", \"The Woman Never Vext\", \"The Merchant's Wedding\", \"Charles XII\", \"The Partisans\", \"The Brigand Chief\", and \"Hofer\"). After 1830, although he still used period costume, he no longer claimed historical accuracy for his work in plays. His work in \"King John\" had brought about a \"revolution in nineteenth-century stage practice\" which lasted for almost a century.\n\nIn 1923 the first of a series of innovative modern dress productions of Shakespeare plays, \"Cymbeline\", directed by H. K. Ayliff, opened at Barry Jackson's Birmingham Repertory Theatre in England.\n\nCostumes in Chinese theatre are very important, especially in Beijing Opera. They are usually heavily patterned and loud in color. The standard items consist of at least 300 pieces and describe the actors character type, age and social status through ornament, design, color and accessories. \"Color is always used symbolically: red for loyalty and high position, yellow for royalty, and dark crimson for barbarians or military advisors.\" Symbolic significance is also found in the designs used for emblems. For example, the tiger stands for power and masculine strength. A majority of the clothing, regardless of rank, is made out of rich and luxurious materials. Makeup is also used symbolically and very important to the overall look.\n\nIn Japanese Noh drama masks are always used and the prominent aspect of the costume. They are made of wood and usually used for generations. There are five basic types; male, female, aged, deities and monsters, all with many variations. The masks are changed often throughout the play. \nIn Kabuki, another form of Japanese theatre, actors do not wear masks but rely heavily on makeup for the overall look. Features are exaggerated or removed and for some of the athletic roles musculature is outlined in a specific pattern. Traditional costumes are used for each role, based upon historical garments that are altered for dramatic effect. \"Some costumes weigh as much as fifty pounds, and stage attendants assist the actors in keeping them properly arranged while on stage\" \n\nThe costume design process involves many steps and though they differ from genre to genre a basic method is commonly used.\n\n1.) Analysis:\nThe first step is an analysis of the script, musical composition, choreography, etc. Costume Parameters for the show are established and a rough costume plot is created. A costume plot outlines which character is in which scene, when the actors change, and what costumes are mentioned in the script.\n\n2.) Design Collaboration:\nAn important phase in the process where all of the designers meet with the director. There must be a clear understanding of where the show is headed. The designers get on the same page with the director in terms of themes for the show and what message they want the audience to get from the show.\n\n3.) Costume Research:\nOnce the director and designers are on the same page, the next step is for the Costume designer to gather research. Costume designers usually begin with world of the play research where they find research to establish the world where the play takes place. This helps the designers establish the rules of the world and then in turn understand the characters better. The designer will then go into broad research about each character to try to establish their personalities though their costume.\n\n4.) Preliminary Sketching and Color Layout:\nOnce enough information is obtained, Costume designers begin by creating preliminary sketches. beginning with very quick rough sketches the designer can get a basic idea for how the show will look put together and if the rules of the world are being maintained. The Costume designer will then go into more detailed sketches and will figure out the specific costumes and colors for the character. Sketches help see the show as a whole without them having to spend too much time on them.\n\n5.) Final Sketches:\nOnce the Costume Designer and the Director agree on the costumes and the ideas are fully flushed out, the designer will create final sketches. These are called rendering and are usually painted with watercolors or acrylic paints. These final sketches show what the designer wants the character to look like and the colors of the costume.\n\nOnce the show is designed, it is necessary to plan where the items will be sourced. There are four options. Garments can be: \n\nThere are two ways a garment can begin to be constructed; either pattern drafted or draped, and many times both methods will be used together.\nPattern drafting begins by using a set of basic pattern blocks developed from the actor’s measurements. They are drawn out on paper first, then transferred to fabric, and sewn together to test fit.\n\nDraping involves manipulating a piece of fabric on a dress form or mannequin that have measurements closely related to the actors. It is a process that takes a flat piece of cloth and shapes it to conform the fabric to a three-dimensional body by cutting and pinning.\n\nOnce constructed, however, the costume has not finished \"working.\" A most important aspect of costumes is the ways they affect actors' performances and function within their settings. The very best costume designers build their original ideas after assessing the visual and spatial conditions of the costumes.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8088", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8088", "title": "Documentary film", "text": "Documentary film\n\nA documentary film is a nonfictional motion picture intended to document some aspect of reality, primarily for the purposes of instruction, education, or maintaining a historical record. Such films were originally shot on film stock—the only medium available—but now include video and digital productions that can be either direct-to-video, made into a TV show, or released for screening in cinemas. \"Documentary\" has been described as a \"filmmaking practice, a cinematic tradition, and mode of audience reception\" that is continually evolving and is without clear boundaries. Documentary films were originally called 'actuality' films and were only a minute or less in length. Over time documentaries have evolved to be longer in length and to include more categories, such as educational, observational, and even 'docufiction'. Documentaries are also educational and often used in schools to teach various principles. Social media platforms such as YouTube, have allowed documentary films to improve the ways the films are distributed and able to educate and broaden the reach of people who receive the information.\n\nPolish writer and filmmaker Bolesław Matuszewski was among those who identified the mode of documentary film. He wrote two of the earliest texts on cinema \"Une nouvelle source de l'histoire\" (eng. A New Source of History) and \"La photographie animée\" (eng. Animated photography). Both were published in 1898 in French and among the early written works to consider the historical and documentary value of the film. Matuszewski is also among the first filmmakers to propose the creation of a Film Archive to collect and keep safe visual materials.\n\nIn popular myth, the word \"documentary\" was coined by Scottish documentary filmmaker John Grierson in his review of Robert Flaherty's film \"Moana\" (1926), published in the \"New York Sun\" on 8 February 1926, written by \"The Moviegoer\" (a pen name for Grierson).\n\nGrierson's principles of documentary were that cinema's potential for observing life could be exploited in a new art form; that the \"original\" actor and \"original\" scene are better guides than their fiction counterparts to interpreting the modern world; and that materials \"thus taken from the raw\" can be more real than the acted article. In this regard, Grierson's definition of documentary as \"creative treatment of actuality\" has gained some acceptance, with this position at variance with Soviet film-maker Dziga Vertov's provocation to present \"life as it is\" (that is, life filmed surreptitiously) and \"life caught unawares\" (life provoked or surprised by the camera).\n\nThe American film critic Pare Lorentz defines a documentary film as \"a factual film which is dramatic.\" Others further state that a documentary stands out from the other types of non-fiction films for providing an opinion, and a specific message, along with the facts it presents.\n\nDocumentary practice is the complex process of creating documentary projects. It refers to what people do with media devices, content, form, and production strategies in order to address the creative, ethical, and conceptual problems and choices that arise as they make documentaries.\n\nDocumentary filmmaking can be used as a form of journalism, advocacy, or personal expression.\n\nEarly film (pre-1900) was dominated by the novelty of showing an event. They were single-shot moments captured on film: a train entering a station, a boat docking, or factory workers leaving work. These short films were called \"actuality\" films; the term \"documentary\" was not coined until 1926. Many of the first films, such as those made by Auguste and Louis Lumière, were a minute or less in length, due to technological limitations.\n\nFilms showing many people (for example, leaving a factory) were often made for commercial reasons: the people being filmed were eager to see, for payment, the film showing them. One notable film clocked in at over an hour and a half, \"The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight\". Using pioneering film-looping technology, Enoch J. Rector presented the entirety of a famous 1897 prize-fight on cinema screens across the United States.\n\nIn May 1896, Bolesław Matuszewski recorded on film few surigical operations in Warsaw and Saint Petersburg hospitals. In 1898, French surgeon Eugène-Louis Doyen invited Bolesław Matuszewski and Clément Maurice and proposed them to recorded his surigical operations. They started in Paris a series of surgical films sometime before July 1898. Until 1906, the year of his last film, Doyen recorded more than 60 operations. Doyen said that his first films taught him how to correct professional errors he had been unaware of. For scientific purposes, after 1906, Doyen combined 15 of his films into three compilations, two of which survive, the six-film series \"Extirpation des tumeurs encapsulées\" (1906), and the four-film \"Les Opérations sur la cavité crânienne\" (1911). These and five other of Doyen's films survive.\nBetween July 1898 and 1901, the Romanian professor Gheorghe Marinescu made several science films in his neurology clinic in Bucharest: \"Walking Troubles of Organic Hemiplegy\" (1898), \"The Walking Troubles of Organic Paraplegies\" (1899), \"A Case of Hysteric Hemiplegy Healed Through Hypnosis\" (1899), \"The Walking Troubles of Progressive Locomotion Ataxy\" (1900), and \"Illnesses of the Muscles\" (1901). All these short films have been preserved. The professor called his works \"studies with the help of the cinematograph,\" and published the results, along with several consecutive frames, in issues of \"La Semaine Médicale\" magazine from Paris, between 1899 and 1902. In 1924, Auguste Lumiere recognized the merits of Marinescu's science films: \"I've seen your scientific reports about the usage of the cinematograph in studies of nervous illnesses, when I was still receiving \"La Semaine Médicale,\" but back then I had other concerns, which left me no spare time to begin biological studies. I must say I forgot those works and I am thankful to you that you reminded them to me. Unfortunately, not many scientists have followed your way.\"\n\nTravelogue films were very popular in the early part of the 20th century. They were often referred to by distributors as \"scenics.\" Scenics were among the most popular sort of films at the time. An important early film to move beyond the concept of the scenic was \"In the Land of the Head Hunters\" (1914), which embraced primitivism and exoticism in a staged story presented as truthful re-enactments of the life of Native Americans.\n\nContemplation is a separate area. Pathé is the best-known global manufacturer of such films of the early 20th century. A vivid example is \"Moscow Clad in Snow\" (1909).\n\nBiographical documentaries appeared during this time, such as the feature \"Eminescu-Veronica-Creangă\" (1914) on the relationship between the writers Mihai Eminescu, Veronica Micle and Ion Creangă (all deceased at the time of the production) released by the Bucharest chapter of Pathé.\n\nEarly color motion picture processes such as Kinemacolor—known for the feature \"With Our King and Queen Through India\" (1912)—and Prizmacolor—known for \"Everywhere With Prizma\" (1919) and the five-reel feature \"Bali the Unknown\" (1921)—used travelogues to promote the new color processes. In contrast, Technicolor concentrated primarily on getting their process adopted by Hollywood studios for fictional feature films.\n\nAlso during this period, Frank Hurley's feature documentary film, \"South\" (1919), about the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition was released. The film documented the failed Antarctic expedition led by Ernest Shackleton in 1914.\n\nWith Robert J. Flaherty's \"Nanook of the North\" in 1922, documentary film embraced romanticism; Flaherty filmed a number of heavily staged romantic films during this time period, often showing how his subjects would have lived 100 years earlier and not how they lived right then. For instance, in \"Nanook of the North\", Flaherty did not allow his subjects to shoot a walrus with a nearby shotgun, but had them use a harpoon instead. Some of Flaherty's staging, such as building a roofless igloo for interior shots, was done to accommodate the filming technology of the time.\n\nParamount Pictures tried to repeat the success of Flaherty's \"Nanook\" and \"Moana\" with two romanticized documentaries, \"Grass\" (1925) and \"Chang\" (1927), both directed by Merian Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack.\n\nCity symphony films were avant-garde films made during the 1920s to 1930s. These films were particularly influenced by modern art: namely Cubism, Constructivism, and Impressionism. (See A.L Rees, 2011) According to Scott Macdonald (2010), city symphony film can be located as an intersection between documentary and avant-garde film: \"avant-doc\". However, A.L. Rees suggest to see them as avant-garde films. (Rees, 2011: 35)\n\nCity symphony films include \"Manhatta\" (dir. Paul Strand, 1921), \"Paris Nothing but the Hours\" (dir. Alberto Cavalcanti, 1926), \"Twenty Four Dollar Island\" (dir. Robert Flaherty, 1927), \"Études sur Paris\" (dir. André Sauvage, 1928), \"The Bridge\" (1928), and \"Rain\" (1929), both by Joris Ivens.\n\nBut the most famous city symphony films are \"\" (dir. Walter Ruttman, 1927) and \"The Man with a Movie Camera\" (dir. Dziga Vertov, 1929).\n\nA city symphony film, as the name suggests, is usually based around a major metropolitan city area and seek to capture the lives, events and activities of the city. It can be abstract and cinematographic (see Walter Ruttmann's \"Berlin\") or utilise Russian Montage theory (See Dziga Vertov's \"Man with a Movie Camera\"). But most importantly, a city symphony film is like a cine-poem and is shot and edited like a \"symphony\". \nThe continental, or realist, tradition focused on humans within human-made environments, and included the so-called \"city symphony\" films such as Walter Ruttmann's \"Berlin, Symphony of a City\" (of which Grierson noted in an article that \"Berlin\" represented what a documentary should not be), Alberto Cavalcanti's \"Rien que les heures\", and Dziga Vertov's \"Man with a Movie Camera\". These films tend to feature people as products of their environment, and lean towards the avant-garde.\n\nDziga Vertov was central to the Soviet \"Kino-Pravda\" (literally, \"cinematic truth\") newsreel series of the 1920s. Vertov believed the camera—with its varied lenses, shot-counter shot editing, time-lapse, ability to slow motion, stop motion and fast-motion—could render reality more accurately than the human eye, and made a film philosophy out of it.\n\nThe newsreel tradition is important in documentary film; newsreels were also sometimes staged but were usually re-enactments of events that had already happened, not attempts to steer events as they were in the process of happening. For instance, much of the battle footage from the early 20th century was staged; the cameramen would usually arrive on site after a major battle and re-enact scenes to film them.\n\nThe propagandist tradition consists of films made with the explicit purpose of persuading an audience of a point. One of the most celebrated and controversial propaganda films is Leni Riefenstahl's film \"Triumph of the Will\" (1935), which chronicled the 1934 Nazi Party Congress and was commissioned by Adolf Hitler. Leftist filmmakers Joris Ivens and Henri Storck directed \"Borinage\" (1931) about the Belgian coal mining region. Luis Buñuel directed a \"surrealist\" documentary \"Las Hurdes\" (1933).\n\nPare Lorentz's \"The Plow That Broke the Plains\" (1936) and \"The River\" (1938) and Willard Van Dyke's \"The City\" (1939) are notable New Deal productions, each presenting complex combinations of social and ecological awareness, government propaganda, and leftist viewpoints. Frank Capra's \"Why We Fight\" (1942–1944) series was a newsreel series in the United States, commissioned by the government to convince the U.S. public that it was time to go to war. Constance Bennett and her husband Henri de la Falaise produced two feature-length documentaries, \"\" (1935) filmed in Bali, and \"Kilou the Killer Tiger\" (1936) filmed in Indochina.\n\nIn Canada, the Film Board, set up by John Grierson, was created for the same propaganda reasons. It also created newsreels that were seen by their national governments as legitimate counter-propaganda to the psychological warfare of Nazi Germany (orchestrated by Joseph Goebbels).\nIn Britain, a number of different filmmakers came together under John Grierson. They became known as the Documentary Film Movement. Grierson, Alberto Cavalcanti, Harry Watt, Basil Wright, and Humphrey Jennings amongst others succeeded in blending propaganda, information, and education with a more poetic aesthetic approach to documentary. Examples of their work include \"Drifters\" (John Grierson), \"Song of Ceylon\" (Basil Wright), \"Fires Were Started\", and \"A Diary for Timothy\" (Humphrey Jennings). Their work involved poets such as W. H. Auden, composers such as Benjamin Britten, and writers such as J. B. Priestley. Among the best known films of the movement are \"Night Mail\" and \"Coal Face\".\n\nFilm \"Calling mr. Smith\" (1943) was anti-nazi color film created by Stefan Themerson and being both documentary and avant-garde film against war. It was one of the first anti-nazi films in history.\n\nCinéma vérité (or the closely related direct cinema) was dependent on some technical advances in order to exist: light, quiet and reliable cameras, and portable sync sound.\n\nCinéma vérité and similar documentary traditions can thus be seen, in a broader perspective, as a reaction against studio-based film production constraints. Shooting on location, with smaller crews, would also happen in the French New Wave, the filmmakers taking advantage of advances in technology allowing smaller, handheld cameras and synchronized sound to film events on location as they unfolded.\n\nAlthough the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, there are important differences between cinéma vérité (Jean Rouch) and the North American \"Direct Cinema\" (or more accurately \"\"), pioneered by, among others, Canadians Allan King, , and Pierre Perrault, and Americans Robert Drew, Richard Leacock, Frederick Wiseman, and Albert and David Maysles.\n\nThe directors of the movement take different viewpoints on their degree of involvement with their subjects. Kopple and Pennebaker, for instance, choose non-involvement (or at least no overt involvement), and Perrault, Rouch, Koenig, and Kroitor favor direct involvement or even provocation when they deem it necessary.\n\nThe films \"Chronicle of a Summer\" (Jean Rouch), \"Dont Look Back\" (D. A. Pennebaker), \"Grey Gardens\" (Albert and David Maysles), \"Titicut Follies\" (Frederick Wiseman), \"Primary\" and \"\" (both produced by Robert Drew), \"Harlan County, USA\" (directed by Barbara Kopple), \"Lonely Boy\" (Wolf Koenig and Roman Kroitor) are all frequently deemed cinéma vérité films.\n\nThe fundamentals of the style include following a person during a crisis with a moving, often handheld, camera to capture more personal reactions. There are no sit-down interviews, and the shooting ratio (the amount of film shot to the finished product) is very high, often reaching 80 to one. From there, editors find and sculpt the work into a film. The editors of the movement—such as Werner Nold, Charlotte Zwerin, Muffie Myers, Susan Froemke, and Ellen Hovde—are often overlooked, but their input to the films was so vital that they were often given co-director credits.\n\nFamous cinéma vérité/direct cinema films include \"Les Raquetteurs\", \"Showman\", \"Salesman\", \"Near Death\", and \"The Children Were Watching\".\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, documentary film was often conceived as a political weapon against neocolonialism and capitalism in general, especially in Latin America, but also in a changing Quebec society. \"La Hora de los hornos\" (\"The Hour of the Furnaces\", from 1968), directed by Octavio Getino and Arnold Vincent Kudales Sr., influenced a whole generation of filmmakers. Among the many political documentaries produced in the early 1970s was \"Chile: A Special Report,\" public television's first in-depth expository look of the September 1973 overthrow of the Salvador Allende government in Chile by military leaders under Augusto Pinochet, produced by documentarians Ari Martinez and José Garcia.\n\nBox office analysts have noted that this film genre has become increasingly successful in theatrical release with films such as \"Fahrenheit 9/11\", \"Super Size Me\", \"Food, Inc.\", \"Earth\", \"March of the Penguins\", \"Religulous\", and \"An Inconvenient Truth\" among the most prominent examples. Compared to dramatic narrative films, documentaries typically have far lower budgets which makes them attractive to film companies because even a limited theatrical release can be highly profitable.\n\nThe nature of documentary films has expanded in the past 20 years from the cinema verité style introduced in the 1960s in which the use of portable camera and sound equipment allowed an intimate relationship between filmmaker and subject. The line blurs between documentary and narrative and some works are very personal, such as the late Marlon Riggs's \"Tongues Untied\" (1989) and \"Black Is...Black Ain't\" (1995), which mix expressive, poetic, and rhetorical elements and stresses subjectivities rather than historical materials.\n\nHistorical documentaries, such as the landmark 14-hour \"Eyes on the Prize: America's Civil Rights Years\" (1986—Part 1 and 1989—Part 2) by Henry Hampton, \"4 Little Girls\" (1997) by Spike Lee, and \"The Civil War\" by Ken Burns, UNESCO awarded independent film on slavery 500 Years Later, expressed not only a distinctive voice but also a perspective and point of views. Some films such as \"The Thin Blue Line\" by Errol Morris incorporated stylized re-enactments, and Michael Moore's \"Roger & Me\" placed far more interpretive control with the director. The commercial success of these documentaries may derive from this narrative shift in the documentary form, leading some critics to question whether such films can truly be called documentaries; critics sometimes refer to these works as \"mondo films\" or \"docu-ganda.\" However, directorial manipulation of documentary subjects has been noted since the work of Flaherty, and may be endemic to the form due to problematic ontological foundations.\n\nDocumentary filmmakers are increasingly utilizing social impact campaigns with their films. Social impact campaigns seek to leverage media projects by converting public awareness of social issues and causes into engagement and action, largely by offering the audience a way to get involved. Examples of such documentaries include \"Kony 2012\", \"Salam Neighbor, Gasland\", \"Living on One Dollar\", and \"Girl Rising\".\n\nAlthough documentaries are financially more viable with the increasing popularity of the genre and the advent of the DVD, funding for documentary film production remains elusive. Within the past decade, the largest exhibition opportunities have emerged from within the broadcast market, making filmmakers beholden to the tastes and influences of the broadcasters who have become their largest funding source.\n\nModern documentaries have some overlap with television forms, with the development of \"reality television\" that occasionally verges on the documentary but more often veers to the fictional or staged. The \"making-of\" documentary shows how a movie or a computer game was produced. Usually made for promotional purposes, it is closer to an advertisement than a classic documentary.\n\nModern lightweight digital video cameras and computer-based editing have greatly aided documentary makers, as has the dramatic drop in equipment prices. The first film to take full advantage of this change was Martin Kunert and Eric Manes' \"Voices of Iraq\", where 150 DV cameras were sent to Iraq during the war and passed out to Iraqis to record themselves.\n\nFilms in the documentary form without words have been made. From 1982, the Qatsi trilogy and the similar \"Baraka\" could be described as visual tone poems, with music related to the images, but no spoken content. \"Koyaanisqatsi\" (part of the Qatsi trilogy) consists primarily of slow motion and time-lapse photography of cities and many natural landscapes across the United States. \"Baraka\" tries to capture the great pulse of humanity as it flocks and swarms in daily activity and religious ceremonies.\n\n\"Bodysong\" was made in 2003 and won a British Independent Film Award for \"Best British Documentary.\"\n\nThe 2004 film \"Genesis\" shows animal and plant life in states of expansion, decay, sex, and death, with some, but little, narration.\n\nThe traditional style for narration is to have a dedicated narrator read a script which is dubbed onto the audio track. The narrator never appears on camera and may not necessarily have knowledge of the subject matter or involvement in the writing of the script.\nThis style of narration uses title screens to visually narrate the documentary. The screens are held for about 5–10 seconds to allow adequate time for the viewer to read them. They are similar to the ones shown at the end of movies based on true stories, but they are shown throughout, typically between scenes.\nIn this style, there is a host who appears on camera, conducts interviews, and who also does voice-overs.\n\nDocufiction is a genre from two basic ones, fiction film and documentary, practiced since the first documentary films were made.\n\nFake-fiction is a genre which deliberately presents real, unscripted events in the form of a fiction film, making them appear as staged. The concept was introduced by Pierre Bismuth to describe his 2016 film \"Where is Rocky II?\"\n\nA DVD documentary is a documentary film of indeterminate length that has been produced with the sole intent of releasing it for direct sale to the public on DVD(s), as different from a documentary being made and released first on television or on a cinema screen (a.k.a. theatrical release) and subsequently on DVD for public consumption.\n\nThis form of documentary release is becoming more popular and accepted as costs and difficulty with finding TV or theatrical release slots increases. It is also commonly used for more 'specialist' documentaries, which might not have general interest to a wider TV audience. Examples are military, cultural arts, transport, sports, etc..\n\nCompilation films were pioneered in 1927 by Esfir Schub with \"The Fall of the Romanov Dynasty\". More recent examples include \"Point of Order\" (1964), directed by Emile de Antonio about the McCarthy hearings. Similarly, \"The Last Cigarette\" combines the testimony of various tobacco company executives before the U.S. Congress with archival propaganda extolling the virtues of smoking.\n\nPoetic documentaries, which first appeared in the 1920s, were a sort of reaction against both the content and the rapidly crystallizing grammar of the early fiction film. The poetic mode moved away from continuity editing and instead organized images of the material world by means of associations and patterns, both in terms of time and space. Well-rounded characters—\"lifelike people\"—were absent; instead, people appeared in these films as entities, just like any other, that are found in the material world. The films were fragmentary, impressionistic, lyrical. Their disruption of the coherence of time and space—a coherence favored by the fiction films of the day—can also be seen as an element of the modernist counter-model of cinematic narrative. The \"real world\"—Nichols calls it the \"historical world\"—was broken up into fragments and aesthetically reconstituted using film form. Examples of this style include Joris Ivens' \"Rain\" (1928), which records a passing summer shower over Amsterdam; László Moholy-Nagy's \"Play of Light: Black, White, Grey (1930)\", in which he films one of his own kinetic sculptures, emphasizing not the sculpture itself but the play of light around it; Oskar Fischinger's abstract animated films; Francis Thompson's \"N.Y., N.Y.\" (1957), a city symphony film; and Chris Marker's \"Sans Soleil\" (1982).\n\nExpository documentaries speak directly to the viewer, often in the form of an authoritative commentary employing voiceover or titles, proposing a strong argument and point of view. These films are rhetorical, and try to persuade the viewer. (They may use a rich and sonorous male voice.) The (voice-of-God) commentary often sounds 'objective' and omniscient. Images are often not paramount; they exist to advance the argument. The rhetoric insistently presses upon us to read the images in a certain fashion. Historical documentaries in this mode deliver an unproblematic and 'objective' account and interpretation of past events.\n\nExamples: TV shows and films like \"Biography\", \"America's Most Wanted\", many science and nature documentaries, Ken Burns' \"The Civil War\" (1990), Robert Hughes' \"The Shock of the New\" (1980), John Berger's \"Ways Of Seeing\" (1974), Frank Capra's wartime \"Why We Fight\" series, and Pare Lorentz's \"The Plow That Broke The Plains\" (1936).\n\nObservational documentaries attempt to simply and spontaneously observe lived life with a minimum of intervention. Filmmakers who worked in this subgenre often saw the poetic mode as too abstract and the expository mode as too didactic. The first observational docs date back to the 1960s; the technological developments which made them possible include mobile lightweight cameras and portable sound recording equipment for synchronized sound. Often, this mode of film eschewed voice-over commentary, post-synchronized dialogue and music, or re-enactments. The films aimed for immediacy, intimacy, and revelation of individual human character in ordinary life situations.\n\nParticipatory documentaries believe that it is impossible for the act of filmmaking to not influence or alter the events being filmed. What these films do is emulate the approach of the anthropologist: participant-observation. Not only is the filmmaker part of the film, we also get a sense of how situations in the film are affected or altered by their presence. Nichols: \"The filmmaker steps out from behind the cloak of voice-over commentary, steps away from poetic meditation, steps down from a fly-on-the-wall perch, and becomes a social actor (almost) like any other. (Almost like any other because the filmmaker retains the camera, and with it, a certain degree of potential power and control over events.)\" The encounter between filmmaker and subject becomes a critical element of the film. Rouch and Morin named the approach cinéma vérité, translating Dziga Vertov's kinopravda into French; the \"truth\" refers to the truth of the encounter rather than some absolute truth.\n\nReflexive documentaries do not see themselves as a transparent window on the world; instead, they draw attention to their own constructedness, and the fact that they are representations. How does the world get represented by documentary films? This question is central to this subgenre of films. They prompt us to \"question the authenticity of documentary in general.\" It is the most self-conscious of all the modes, and is highly skeptical of 'realism'. It may use Brechtian alienation strategies to jar us, in order to 'defamiliarize' what we are seeing and how we are seeing it.\n\nPerformative documentaries stress subjective experience and emotional response to the world. They are strongly personal, unconventional, perhaps poetic and/or experimental, and might include hypothetical enactments of events designed to make us experience what it might be like for us to possess a certain specific perspective on the world that is not our own, e.g. that of black, gay men in Marlon Riggs's \"Tongues Untied\" (1989) or Jenny Livingston's \"Paris Is Burning\" (1991). This subgenre might also lend itself to certain groups (e.g. women, ethnic minorities, gays and lesbians, etc.) to 'speak about themselves.' Often, a battery of techniques, many borrowed from fiction or avant-garde films, are used. Performative docs often link up personal accounts or experiences with larger political or historical realities.\n\nDocumentaries are shown in schools around the world in order to educate students. Used to introduce various topics to children, they are often used with a school lesson or shown many times to reinforce an idea.\n\nA 2007 study from the German Research Foundation found that, \"participants in the Film Repetition condition and in the School Lesson plus Film condition performed equally well and significantly better than those in the Film once condition and School Lesson once condition.\"The pattern of repetition has been shown to boost memory performance. Likewise, students perform better when they are taught with a school lesson which is reinforced by an educational film. An educational film also provides a sense of entertainment for students and increases their interest in the topic.\n\nThe negative side of educational films in school is the director's creative license. As seen before, \"some popular historical movies contain major factual errors.\"When a film introduces incorrect facts, \"it enhances the likelihood that incorrect details from the movie are stored in memory.\"Educational film if presented accurately as well as reviewed for this accuracy can be used to reinforce topics. However, educational film can also mislead the student indirectly, causing a problem for this tool of learning.\n\nBecause YouTube is a global social media platform for videos, it is also used in classrooms as an educational resource. YouTube has the potential to, \"dramatically accelerate scientific advance,\" and that, \"certain public school systems, non-profits, and charter schools use YouTube videos of outstanding educators n the training and professional development of teachers.\" The versatility of YouTube has allowed for the proliferation of knowledge to millions of students around the world as, \"the short, easy to understand videos available can explain difficult concepts.\"Many teachers use the video platform to introduce real examples of topics. Another useful side of YouTube is one of its most important and, \"is changing how we learn because it is free to use.\"This is especially important for students in developing countries as they have limited opportunities for education. With YouTube these students are able to receive the education they deserve in a way that is mare enjoyable. YouTube continues to change lives and change the future of generations to come. YouTube will be a major factor in years to come in the educational system.\n\nThere are several challenges associated with translation of documentaries. The main two are working conditions and problems with terminology.\n\nDocumentary translators very often have to meet tight deadlines. Normally, the translator has between five and seven days to hand over the translation of a 90-minute programme. Dubbing studios typically give translators a week to translate a documentary, but in order to earn a good salary, translators have to deliver their translations in a much shorter period, usually when the studio decides to deliver the final programme to the client sooner or when the broadcasting channel sets a tight deadline, e.g. on documentaries discussing the latest news.\n\nAnother problem is the lack of postproduction script or the poor quality of the transcription. A correct transcription is essential for a translator to do their work properly, however many times the script is not even given to the translator, which is a major impediment since documentaries are characterised by \"the abundance of terminological units and very specific proper names\". When the script is given to the translator, it is usually poorly transcribed or outright incorrect making the translation unnecessarily difficult and demanding because all of the proper names and specific terminology have to be correct in a documentary programme in order for it to be a reliable source of information, hence the translator has to check every term on their own. Such mistakes in proper names are for instance: \"Jungle Reinhard instead of Django Reinhart, Jorn Asten instead of Jane Austen, and Magnus Axle instead of Aldous Huxley\".\n\nThe process of translation of a documentary programme requires working with very specific, often scientific terminology. Documentary translators usually are not specialist in a given field. Therefore, they are compelled to undertake extensive research whenever asked to make a translation of a specific documentary programme in order to understand it correctly and deliver the final product free of mistakes and inaccuracies. Generally, documentaries contain a large amount of specific terms, with which translators have to familiarise themselves on their own, for example:\nThe documentary \"Beetles, Record Breakers\" makes use of 15 different terms to refer to beetles in less than 30 minutes (longhorn beetle, cellar beetle, stag beetle, burying beetle or gravediggers, sexton beetle, tiger beetle, bloody nose beetle, tortoise beetle, diving beetle, devil’s coach horse, weevil, click beetle, malachite beetle, oil beetle, cockchafer), apart from mentioning other animals such as horseshoe bats or meadow brown butterflies.\nThis poses a real challenge for the translators because they have to render the meaning, i.e. find an equivalent, of a very specific, scientific term in the target language and frequently the narrator uses a more general name instead of a specific term and the translator has to rely on the image presented in the programme to understand which term is being discussed in order to transpose it in the target language accordingly. Additionally, translators of minorised languages often have to face another problem: some terms may not even exist in the target language. In such case, they have to create new terminology or consult specialists to find proper solutions. Also, sometimes the official nomenclature differs from the terminology used by actual specialists, which leaves the translator to decide between using the official vocabulary that can be found in the dictionary, or rather opting for spontaneous expressions used by real experts in real life situations.\n\n"}

{"id": "654722", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=654722", "title": "Heiner Müller", "text": "Heiner Müller\n\nHeiner Müller (; 9 January 1929 – 30 December 1995) was a German (formerly East German) dramatist, poet, writer, essayist and theatre director. His \"enigmatic, fragmentary pieces\" are a significant contribution to postmodern drama and postdramatic theatre.\n\nMüller was born in Eppendorf, Saxony. He joined the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands, SED) in 1947 and began serving for the German Writers' Association (Deutscher Schriftsteller-Verband, DSV) in 1954. Müller became one of the most important dramatists of the German Democratic Republic and won the Heinrich Mann Prize in 1959 and the Kleist Prize in 1990.\n\nHis relationship with the East German state began to deteriorate, however, with his drama \"Die Umsiedlerin\" (\"The Resettler Woman\") which was censored in 1961 after only one performance. Müller was banned from the Writers' Association in the same year. The East German government remained wary of Müller in subsequent years, preventing the premiere of \"Der Bau\" (\"Construction Site\") in 1965 and censoring his \"Mauser\" in the early 1970s. Yet despite these hardships, Müller's work began to gain popularity both in West Germany and internationally at this time. Many of his best-known plays from this period were premiered in the West: this includes \"Germania Death in Berlin\", which was first performed in 1978 at the Munich \"Kammerspiele\". Heiner Müller himself directed a production of \"The Mission\" (\"Der Auftrag\") in Bochum in 1982. In Paris, Jean Jourdheuil directed the world premiere of \"Hamletmachine\" (\"Die Hamletmaschine\") in 1979. English translations, first by Helen Fehervary and Marc Silberman, then by Carl Weber, introduced Müller to the English speaking world in the mid- and late 1970s; Müller's controversial play \"Mauser\" was first performed in 1975 in Austin, Texas.\n\nDue to his growing worldwide fame, Müller was able to regain acceptance in East Germany. He was admitted to the DDR Academy of Arts, Berlin in 1984 – only two years before he became a member of parallel West Berlin academy. Despite earlier honors, Müller was not readmitted to the East German Writers' Association until 1988, shortly before the end of the GDR. After the fall of the Wall, Müller became final president of the DDR Academy of the Arts from 1990 until its 1993 merger with the western academy. \n\nIn 1992, he was invited to join the directorate of the Berliner Ensemble, Brecht's former company at the Theater am Schiffbauerdamm, as one of its five members along with Peter Zadek, Peter Palitzsch, Fritz Marquardt and Matthias Langhoff. In 1995, shortly before his death, Müller was appointed as the theatre's sole artistic director.\nDuring the last five years of his life, Müller continued to live in Berlin and work all over Germany and Europe, mostly directing productions of his own works. He wrote few new dramatic texts in this time, though, like Brecht, he did produce much poetry in his final years. In the last half-decade of his life, Müller also worked towards transforming the interview into a literary genre. Müller died in Berlin of throat cancer in 1995. Müller is buried at Berlin's Dorotheenstadt cemetery. Müller's grave was designed by his last stage designer Mark Lammert.\n\nAmong his better known works, other than those already mentioned, are \"Der Lohndrücker\" (\"The Scab\"), \"Wolokolamsker Chaussee\" (\"Volokolamsk Highway\") Parts I–V, \"Verkommenes Ufer Medeamaterial Landschaft mit Argonauten\" (\"Despoiled Shore Medea Material Landscape with Argonauts\"), \"Philoktet\" (\"Philoctetes\"), \"Zement\" (\"Cement\"), \"Bildbeschreibung\" (\"Description of a Picture\" aka \"Explosion of a memory\") and \"Quartett\".\nOver a decade after his death, Müller continues to have an enormous influence on European playwriting, dramaturgy, and performance. In 1998, the journal New German Critique devoted a special issue to his work. He is the only playwright to have ever received such an honor. In 2009, one of Europe’s leading intellectual publishing houses, Suhrkamp, issued the final three volumes in a twelve-volume edition of Müller's collected works.\n\nMüller has also paved the way for a new generation of directors, playwrights, and dramaturgs who regard themselves as \"samplers.\" Müller adopted Brecht's notion of \"Kopien\" (German for \"copying\"), the practice of regarding texts by others as material to be used, imitated, and rewritten. In regards to Brecht's own oeuvre, Müller stated \"To use Brecht without criticizing him is treason.\" For Müller, the work of other writers and artists was not seen as private property; it was to be used as raw material for his own work. Thus, Müller's work in the theater marks the beginning of a tradition of densely poetic dramaturgy based in the logic of association, rather than linear \"dramatic\" narrative.\n\nJonathan Kalb, theater critic for \"The New York Times\", describes Müller's legacy on theatre as replacing the \"closed\" didactical form of the Brechtian parable with \"open\" dramatic forms offering multiple meanings based, in Hans-Thies Lehmann's words, on a surreal \"montage dramaturg . . . in which the reality-level of characters and events vacillates hazily between life and dream and the stage becomes a hotbed of spirits and quotes outside any homogeneous notion of space and time.\" Based on Müller's breakthrough work \"Hamletmachine,\" Giannina Braschi, a leading force of the Nuyorican poetry movement, wrote \"United States of Banana\". In reference to Müller, Tony Kushner declares, \"Write into the void, learn to embrace isolation, in which we may commence undistractedly our dreadful but all-important dialogue with the dead. Forget about love and turn your face to history.\" With Müller's work, theater is a forum for examining history; it is \"a dialogue with the dead.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "25152964", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25152964", "title": "Magic (illusion)", "text": "Magic (illusion)\n\nMagic, along with its subgenres of, and sometimes referred to as illusion, stage magic or close up magic is a performing art in which audiences are entertained by staged tricks or illusions of seemingly impossible feats using natural means. It is to be distinguished from paranormal magic which, it is claimed, are effects created through supernatural means. It is one of the oldest performing arts in the world.\n\nModern entertainment magic, as pioneered by 19th century magician Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin, has become a popular theatrical art form. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, magicians such as Maskelyne and Devant, Howard Thurston, Harry Kellar, and Harry Houdini achieved widespread commercial success during what has become known as \"The Golden Age of Magic\". During this period, performance magic became a staple of Broadway theatre, vaudeville, and music halls. Magic retained its popularity in the television age, with magicians such as David Copperfield, Doug Henning, Penn & Teller, and David Blaine transitioning away from traditional venues.\n\nThe term \"magic\" etymologically derives from the Greek word \"mageia\" (μαγεία). In ancient times, Greeks and Persians had been at war for centuries, and the Persian priests, called \"magosh\" in Persian, came to be known as \"magoi\" in Greek. Ritual acts of Persian priests came to be known as \"mageia\", and then \"magika\"—which eventually came to mean any foreign, unorthodox, or illegitimate ritual practice. During the 17th century, many books were published that described magic tricks. Until the 18th century, magic shows were a common source of entertainment at fairs. A founding figure of modern entertainment magic was Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin, who had a magic theatre in Paris in 1845. John Henry Anderson was pioneering the same transition in London in the 1840s. Towards the end of the 19th century, large magic shows permanently staged at big theatre venues became the norm. As a form of entertainment, magic easily moved from theatrical venues to television magic specials.\nPerformances that modern observers would recognize as conjuring have been practiced throughout history. For many recorded centuries, magicians were associated with the devil and the occult. During the 19th and 20th centuries, many stage magicians even capitalized on this notion in their advertisements. The same level of ingenuity that was used to produce famous ancient deceptions such as the Trojan Horse would also have been used for entertainment, or at least for cheating in money games. They were also used by the practitioners of various religions and cults from ancient times onwards to frighten uneducated people into obedience or turn them into adherents. However, the profession of the illusionist gained strength only in the 18th century, and has enjoyed several popular vogues since.\n\nOpinions vary among magicians on how to categorize a given effect, but a number of categories have been developed. Magicians may pull a rabbit from an empty hat, make something seem to disappear, or transform a red silk handkerchief into a green silk handkerchief. Magicians may also destroy something, like cutting a head off, and then \"restore\" it, make something appear to move from one place to another, or they may escape from a restraining device. Other illusions include making something appear to defy gravity, making a solid object appear to pass through another object, or appearing to predict the choice of a spectator. Many magic routines use combinations of effects.\nOne of the earliest books on the subject is Gantziony's work of 1489, \"Natural and Unnatural Magic\", which describes and explains old-time tricks. In 1584, Englishman Reginald Scot published \"The Discoverie of Witchcraft\", part of which was devoted to debunking the claims that magicians used supernatural methods, and showing how their \"magic tricks\" were in reality accomplished. Among the tricks discussed were sleight-of-hand manipulations with rope, paper and coins. At the time, fear and belief in witchcraft was widespread and the book tried to demonstrate that these fears were misplaced. Popular belief held that all obtainable copies were burned on the accession of James I in 1603.\n\nDuring the 17th century, many similar books were published that described in detail the methods of a number of magic tricks, including \"The Art of Conjuring\" (1614) and \"The Anatomy of Legerdemain: The Art of Juggling\" (c. 1675).\nUntil the 18th century, magic shows were a common source of entertainment at fairs, where itinerant performers would entertain the public with magic tricks, as well as the more traditional spectacles of sword swallowing, juggling and fire breathing. In the early 18th century, as belief in witchcraft was waning, the art became increasingly respectable and shows would be put on for rich private patrons. A notable figure in this transition was the English showman, Isaac Fawkes, who began to promote his act in advertisements from the 1720s – he even claimed to have performed for King George II. One of Fawkes' advertisements described his routine in some detail:\nFrom 1756 to 1781, Jacob Philadelphia performed feats of magic, sometimes under the guise of scientific exhibitions, throughout Europe and in Russia.\n\nA founding figure of modern entertainment magic was Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin, originally a clockmaker, who opened a magic theatre in Paris in 1845. He transformed his art from one performed at fairs to a performance that the public paid to see at the theatre. His speciality was constructing mechanical automata that appeared to move and act as if alive. Many of Robert-Houdin's mechanisms for illusion were pirated by his assistant and ended up in the performances of his rivals, John Henry Anderson and Alexander Herrmann.\n\nJohn Henry Anderson was pioneering the same transition in London. In 1840 he opened the New Strand Theatre, where he performed as \"The Great Wizard of the North\". His success came from advertising his shows and captivating his audience with expert showmanship. He became one of the earliest magicians to attain a high level of world renown. He opened a second theatre in Glasgow in 1845.\nTowards the end of the century, large magic shows permanently staged at big theatre venues became the norm. The British performer J N Maskelyne and his partner Cooke were established at the Egyptian Hall in London's Piccadilly in 1873 by their manager William Morton, and continued there for 31 years. The show incorporated stage illusions and reinvented traditional tricks with exotic (often Oriental) imagery. The potential of the stage was exploited for hidden mechanisms and assistants, and the control it offers over the audience's point of view.\nMaskelyne and Cooke invented many of the illusions still performed today – one of his best-known being levitation.\n\nThe model for the look of a 'typical' magician—a man with wavy hair, a top hat, a goatee, and a tailcoat—was Alexander Herrmann (February 10, 1844 – December 17, 1896), also known as Herrmann the Great. Herrmann was a French magician and was part of the Herrmann family name that is the \"first-family of magic\".\n\nThe escapologist and magician Harry Houdini took his stage name from Robert-Houdin and developed a range of stage magic tricks, many of them based on what became known after his death as escapology. Houdini was genuinely skilled in techniques such as lockpicking and escaping straitjackets, but also made full use of the range of conjuring techniques, including fake equipment and collusion with individuals in the audience. Houdini's show business savvy was as great as his performance skill. There is a Houdini Museum dedicated to him in Scranton, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Magic Circle was formed in London in 1905 to promote and advance the art of stage magic.\n\nAs a form of entertainment, magic easily moved from theatrical venues to television specials, which opened up new opportunities for deceptions, and brought stage magic to huge audiences. Famous magicians of the 20th century included Okito, David Devant, Harry Blackstone Sr., Harry Blackstone Jr., Howard Thurston, Theodore Annemann, Cardini, Joseph Dunninger, Dai Vernon, Fred Culpitt, Tommy Wonder, Siegfried & Roy, and Doug Henning. Popular 20th- and 21st-century magicians include David Copperfield, Lance Burton, James Randi, Penn and Teller, David Blaine, Criss Angel, Hans Klok and Derren Brown. Well-known women magicians include Dell O'Dell and Dorothy Dietrich. Most television magicians perform before a live audience, who provide the remote viewer with a reassurance that the illusions are not obtained with post-production visual effects.\n\nMany of the principles of stage magic are old. There is an expression, \"it's all done with smoke and mirrors\", used to explain something baffling, but effects seldom use mirrors today, due to the amount of installation work and transport difficulties. For example, the famous Pepper's Ghost, a stage illusion first used in 19th-century London, required a specially built theatre. Modern performers have vanished objects as large as the Taj Mahal, the Statue of Liberty, and a space shuttle, using other kinds of optical deceptions.\n\nMagic is often described according to various specialities or genres.\n\nMagicians describe the type of tricks they perform in various ways. Opinions vary as to how to categorize a given effect, and disagreement as to what categories actually exist. For instance, some magicians consider \"penetrations\" a separate category, while others consider penetrations a form of restoration or teleportation. Some magicians today, such as Guy Hollingworth and Tom Stone have begun to challenge the notion that all magic effects fit into a limited number of categories. Among magicians who believe in a limited number of categories (such as Dariel Fitzkee, Harlan Tarbell, S.H. Sharpe), there has been disagreement as to how many different types of effects there are. Some of these are listed below.\n\n\nMany magic routines use combinations of effects. For example, in \"cups and balls\" a magician may use vanishes, productions, penetrations, teleportation and transformations as part of the one presentation.\n\nThe methodology behind magic is often referred to as a science (often a branch of physics) while the performance aspect is more of an art form.\n\nDedication to magic can teach confidence and creativity, as well as the work ethic associated with regular practice and the responsibility that comes with devotion to an art.\nThe teaching of performance magic was once a secretive practice. Professional magicians were unwilling to share knowledge with anyone outside the profession to prevent the laity from learning their secrets. This often made it difficult for an interested apprentice to learn anything but the basics of magic. Some had strict rules against members discussing magic secrets with anyone but established magicians.\n\nFrom the 1584 publication of Reginald Scot's \"Discoverie of Witchcraft\" until the end of the 19th century, only a few books were available for magicians to learn the craft, whereas today mass-market books offer a myriad titles. Videos and DVDs are a newer medium of tuition, but many of the methods found in this format are readily found in previously published books. However, they can serve as a visual demonstration.\n\nPersons interested in learning to perform magic can join magic clubs. Here magicians, both seasoned and novitiate, can work together and help one another for mutual improvement, to learn new techniques, to discuss all aspects of magic, to perform for each other—sharing advice, encouragement, and criticism. Before a magician can join one of these clubs, they usually have to audition. The purpose is to show to the membership they are a magician and not just someone off the street wanting to discover magic secrets.\n\nThe world's largest magic organization is the International Brotherhood of Magicians; it publishes a monthly journal, \"The Linking Ring\". The oldest organization is the Society of American Magicians, which publishes the monthly magazine \"M-U-M\" and of which Houdini was a member and president for several years. In London, England, there is The Magic Circle, which houses the largest magic library in Europe. Also PSYCRETS—The British Society of Mystery Entertainers—caters specifically to mentalists, bizarrists, storytellers, readers, spiritualist performers, and other mystery entertainers. Davenport's Magic in London's The Strand is the world's oldest family-run magic shop. The Magic Castle in Hollywood, California, is home to the Academy of Magical Arts.\n\nTraditionally, magicians refuse to reveal the methods behind their tricks to the audience. Membership in professional magicians' organizations often requires a commitment never to reveal the secrets of magic to non-magicians. Magic performances tend to fall into a few specialties or genres. Stage illusions use large-scale props and even large animals. Platform magic is performed for a medium to large audience. Close-up magic is performed with the audience close to the magician. Escapology involves escapes from confinement or restraints. Pickpocket magicians take audience members' wallets, belts, and ties. \nMentalism creates the illusion that the magician can read minds. Comedy magic is the use of magic combined with stand-up comedy, an example being Penn & Teller. Some modern illusionists believe that it is unethical to give a performance that claims to be anything other than a clever and skillful deception. Others argue that they can claim that the effects are due to magic. These apparently irreconcilable differences of opinion have led to some conflicts among performers. Another issue is the use of deceptive practices for personal gain outside the venue of a magic performance. Examples include fraudulent mediums, con men and grifters who use deception for cheating at card games.\n\nSome modern illusionists believe that it is unethical to give a performance that claims to be anything other than a clever and skillful deception. Most of these performers therefore eschew the term \"magician\" (which they view as making a claim to supernatural power) in favor of \"illusionist\" and similar descriptions; for example, the performer Jamy Ian Swiss makes these points by billing himself as an \"honest liar\". Alternatively, many performers say that magical acts, as a form of theatre, need no more of a disclaimer than any play or film; this policy is advocated by the magician and mentalist Joseph Dunninger, who states \"For those who believe, no explanation is necessary; for those who do not believe, no explanation will suffice.\"\n\nThese apparently irreconcilable differences of opinion have led to some conflicts among performers. For example, more than thirty years after the hugely successful illusionist Uri Geller made his first appearances on television in the 1970s to exhibit his self-proclaimed psychic ability to bend spoons, his actions still provoke controversy among some magic performers, because he claimed he was not using conjuring techniques. On the other hand, because Geller bent—and continues to bend—spoons within a performance context, the Dunninger quote may be said to apply.\n\nLess fraught with controversy, however, may be the use of deceptive practices by those who employ conjuring techniques for personal gain outside the venue of a magic performance.\n\nFraudulent mediums have long capitalized on the popular belief in paranormal phenomena to prey on the bereaved for financial gain. From the 1840s to the 1920s, during the greatest popularity of the Spiritualism religious movement as well as public interest in séances, a number of fraudulent mediums used conjuring methods to perform illusions such as table-knocking, slate-writing, and telekinetic effects, which they attributed to the actions of ghosts or other spirits. The great escapologist and illusionist Harry Houdini devoted much of his time to exposing such fraudulent operators. Magician James Randi, magic duo Penn & Teller, and the mentalist Derren Brown have also devoted much time to investigating and debunking paranormal, occult, and supernatural claims.\n\nFraudulent faith healers have also been shown to employ sleight of hand to give the appearance of removing chicken-giblet \"tumors\" from patients' abdomens.\n\nCon men and grifters too may use techniques of conjuring for fraudulent goals. Cheating at card games is an obvious example, and not a surprising one: one of the most respected textbooks of card techniques for magicians, \"The Expert at the Card Table\" by Erdnase, was primarily written as an instruction manual for card sharps. The card trick known as \"Find the Lady\" or \"Three-card Monte\" is an old favourite of street hustlers, who lure the victim into betting on what seems like a simple proposition: to identify, after a seemingly easy-to-track mixing sequence, which one of three face-down cards is the Queen. Another example is the shell game, in which a pea is hidden under one of three walnut shells, then shuffled around the table (or sidewalk) so slowly as to make the pea's position seemingly obvious. Although these are well known as frauds, people still lose money on them; a shell-game ring was broken up in Los Angeles as recently as December 2009.\n\nBecause of the secretive nature of magic, research can sometimes be a challenge. Many magic resources are privately held and most libraries only have small populist collections of magicana. However, organizations exist to band together independent collectors, writers, and researchers of magic history, including the Magic Collectors' Association, which publishes a quarterly magazine and hosts an annual convention; and the Conjuring Arts Research Center, which publishes a monthly newsletter and biannual magazine, and offers its members use of a searchable database of rare books and periodicals.\n\nPerformance magic is particularly notable as a key area of popular culture from the mid-19th to mid-20th centuries. Many performances and performers can be followed through newspapers of the time.\n\nMany books have been written about magic tricks; so many are written every year that at least one magic author has suggested that more books are written about magic than any other performing art. Although the bulk of these books are not seen on the shelves of libraries or public bookstores, the serious student can find many titles through specialized stores catering to the needs of magic performers.\n\nSeveral notable public research collections on magic are the \"WG Alma Conjuring Collection\" at the State Library of Victoria; the \"R. B. Robbins Collection of Stage Magic and Conjuring\" at the State Library of NSW; the \" H. Adrian Smith Collection of Conjuring and Magicana\" at Brown University; and the \"Carl W. Jones Magic Collection, 1870s–1948\" at Princeton University.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Leon (1904 – November 2, 1984) was an impresario, radio producer, conductor, musicologist, opera manager, referee, and businessman. He had a wide array of talents and interests which led him towards a highly diversified career in many fields from running and owning WDAS (AM) from 1950 to 1979, refereeing for Polo sporting events, and owning and operating Whole-Sum Products, a candy factory, for more than four decades. He also was a highly accomplished musician, serving as the founder and conductor of the Philadelphia Pops Orchestra and working as the General Manager of the Opera Company of Philadelphia.\n\nBorn in Poland to Jewish parents, Leon came to the United States at the age of 16. He began his career working for the Whole-Sum Products candy factory in Philadelphia in the 1920s during which time he also played a variety of instruments in \"Max Leon and his Musical Eagles\", a local dance band. Leon eventually became the General Manager of Whole-Sum Products and later bought the company in 1934, which he kept going into the 1970s. He notably forged a partnership with Breyers Ice Cream, and the company invented their marshmallow ice cream flavor along with making other products for Breyers.\n\nLeon continued to be active with several amateur musical groups in Philadelphia during the 1930s. He eventually ended up studying conducting with Paul Breisach, a conductor at the Metropolitan Opera, Martin Rich at the Curtis Institute of Music, and Eugene Ormandy, famed director of the Philadelphia Orchestra. Leon financed and founded the Philadelphia Pops Orchestra in 1943 and became the principal conductor. The orchestra was made up of musicians primarily from the Philadelphia Orchestra. He conducted concerts with the orchestra for many years.

It is something said that, because of its apparent lack of meaning relative to what preceded it, seems absurd to the point of being humorous or confusing.\n\nThis use of the term is distinct from the non-sequitur in logic, where it is a fallacy.\n\nThe expression is Latin for \"it does not follow.\" It comes from the words \"non\" meaning not, and the deponent verb \"sequor\", \"sequi\", \"secutus sum\" meaning 'to follow'. Deponent verbs have passive forms but active meanings.\n\nA non-sequitur can denote an abrupt, illogical, or unexpected turn in plot or dialogue by including a relatively inappropriate change in manner. A non-sequitur joke sincerely has no explanation, but it reflects the idiosyncrasies, mental frames and alternative world of the particular comic persona.\n\n\n"}

The game was created in collaboration between the film's director Peter Jackson, and game designer Michel Ancel.\n\nThe game allows players to play as both Jack Driscoll and King Kong. The King Kong segments are played from a third-person perspective, while human levels are played from a first-person perspective. The game de-emphasizes the role of a heads-up display, with the developers explaining that this conceivably would help players to get further immersed into the game.\n\nIt was released on PC and sixth generation platforms and a Nintendo DS version on November 21, 2005, while it was released on November 22, 2005 on the Xbox 360 as a launch title, as well as a Game Boy Advance version titled \"Kong: The 8th Wonder of the World\"; also, a PlayStation Portable version was released December 20, 2005. The film's cast members reprise their roles. \n\nUpon release, the game received critical acclaim, with critics praising the game's immersive environments, action sequences and ability to switch through two protagonists throughout the game. However, the DS version was panned due to the bugs featured in these versions. The PSP version received a mixed reception due to the shorter length and parts cut out from the console and PC versions.\n\nIn the game, the player assumes the roles of both New York scriptwriter Jack Driscoll and the giant gorilla, Kong as they struggle to survive the threats of Skull Island in 1933.\n\nHuman levels are controlled from a first person perspective. The game de-emphasizes the role of a heads-up display: it lacks a life bar, aiming reticule, and ammunition readout (the ammo readout and aiming reticule can be turned on and off at the player's will, but will be disabled by default.), further adding to the challenge and encouraging the player to find alternate weapons and techniques.\n\nInterspersed with human adventure are levels in which the player controls Kong himself, traversing Skull Island's unique geography, battling various giant monsters while defending Ann. The Kong levels take place in a third person view, as the player directs Kong to punch, grab and use objects/corpses as weapons. He can also bite, climb, charge, hurl enemies and even pound his chest to go into fury mode. When Kong is sent into fury mode, the sky becomes tinted with a golden hue and Kong becomes more powerful and less vulnerable to attack. Many of the Kong sequences fulfill the role of boss fights, as the giant ape is able to effectively battle the gigantic creatures that Jack's weapons cannot harm.\n\nIn 1933, film director Carl Denham (Jack Black), has gotten hold of a mysterious map, which reveals the secret location of a large island known as Skull Island, a place located in the far reaches of the Indian Ocean (correctly the Pacific Ocean in the game). Carl hires playwright Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) to write his script and plucks a starving, out-of-work actress Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) to play the part of leading lady and a tramp steamer called the \"Venture\" to take them to the island. The ship, controlled by Captain Englehorn (Thomas Kretschmann) arrives at the island on October 12, 1933. But due to the stormy seas and huge rocks, it can't get close enough to land so the crew orders the captain to send three lifeboats containing the cast, crew and a few sailors to the island and he does. However, the lifeboat containing Jack, Carl, Ann, Hayes (Evan Parke), and Briggs gets hit by a chunk of rock which falls from a large stone structure, tossing the party out into the sea.\n\nJack is horrified to find out that one of the sailors, Briggs is dead and the lifeboat completely wrecked. Hayes shoots out a distress signal, informing everyone that if Englehorn sees it, he'll come looking for them via the ship's plane. The group head upwards to a cave entrance leading into a dark, flooded cave. After fighting off several giant crabs with their 9mm Luger P08 pistols, they head towards the exit and move out onto a rocky outcrop, to the left there is a rocky slope leading down to a stony beach. Carl suggest shooting some test shots for his movie, he asks Ann to scream and her classic damsel-in-distress style wailing is answered by a loud roar. The director and his men are suddenly attacked by huge crabs that crawl out from the shore, rifles raised, the men shoot the miniature tanks down, but a huge bellow erupts from the water. A 30-foot crab emerges from the murk and knocks over a wooden platform supported by wooden beams which is standing next to the slope. After much man-made commotion the creature is defeated, and they move on through a gigantic wooden door. Jack has the option of swapping his Luger for a Winchester Model 1897 pump-action shotgun.\n\nThe party progress forward, meeting up with the second lifeboat containing Preston (Colin Hanks), Jimmy (Jamie Bell) and Lumpy (Andy Serkis), although it cannot land because of the strong current of the sea. The team continue traversing the island, battling with many vicious creatures, and are eventually forced to split up. Jack crosses a wooden bridge, but after he crosses it, it breaks. Ann insists on going with him and climbs up to the cliff above Jack. After a huge battle with Megapedes and Scorpiopedes through a seemingly abandoned village, Jack and Ann are captured by the island Natives. Jack gets to use a Mauser Gewehr 98 sniper rifle, but loses it.\n\nWhen Jack wakes up tied to a stake, he can only watch as Ann is taken by Kong, a gorilla during a native sacrifice. Carl eventually rescues Jack and the two give chase. During the dangerous journey through the jungle, they have an encounter with \"Venatosaurus\" who are feasting on a dead \"Ferrucutus\". Jack and Carl reunite with Hayes after defeating a pack of \"Venatosaurus\" with the last weapon, a .45 caliber Thompson submachine gun with a 50-round drum magazine. Soon after, they meet up with Preston, Lumpy, Jimmy and Baxter, who are crossing a bridge, but they are attacked by a \"Vastatosaurus rex\". Lumpy is torn apart, Jimmy and Baxter fall down into the crevasse, but Preston got to the other side. Jack is separated from Carl and Hayes, who tell him to continue look for Ann. Jack eventually finds Ann, but she is kidnapped by a \"Terapusmordax\". Kong comes to the rescue and saves Ann. Jack continues on into the canyon, where he sees a migrating herd of \"Brontosaurus\", and also battles Megapedes and Scorpio-Pedes. A \"V. rex\" attacks the sauropods and Jack meets up with Carl and Hayes, and continue on their path. In the jungle, they come across Jimmy, who is being attacked by the \"Venatosaurs\". They eventually meet up on a raft, where Jimmy tells the group that everyone is dead. After escaping the Skull Islanders the team are pursued by two \"V.rexes\". Kong comes to the rescue and kills them. As the teams continue their journey, they enter a swamp, and fight against strange-looking Udusaurs. After leaving the swamp, Kong interrupts their log crossing and tips them into a huge ravine. Carl's camera is broken and he gives up, heading downstream towards the Venture. Jack, Jimmy and Hayes continue their pursuit of Ann. \n\nJack eventually saves Ann from a \"V. rex\", and the party continue the adventure to find a long stretch of water of which the seaplane can land on. After fighting off some \"Venatosaurus\" and a juvenile \"V. rex\" in a cave, and leaving a swamp, they finally come across a long stretch of water. Captain Englehorn, in his seaplane, lands on the water. However, he takes flight as a \"V. rex\" follows them into a large area cluttered with ancient stone ruins. The monster breaks through the barricade and begins smashing down their shelter. Ann signals for Kong to come. Eventually, Kong comes to save them while Jack shoots some \"Terapusmordax\" to distract the carnivore. As Hayes tries to stop the fight, opening fire on Kong, the \"V. rex\" charges at Kong and inadvertently steps on Hayes, injuring him. Jack and Jimmy stand over Hayes, who tells Jimmy before he dies to get back to the ship. Jack and Jimmy fight many raptors and head back to the stretch of water and find the seaplane. Jimmy climbs in (there is only one passenger seat) and Jack climbs up into the mountains to save Ann.\n\nJack discovers Kong's lair and kills two juvenile \"V. rex\" and the Skin-Birds roosting above the entrance. He rescues Ann while Kong fights several cave serpents. After leaving the jungle, Jack and Ann arrive at The Wall, Ann is captured by the natives once again until Kong comes to get her. He saves her then heads for the shore. Kong gets gassed by sailors once he reaches the shore. He eventually passes out and is taken to New York City, where he is put on display on Broadway. Kong isn't held captive for long and wanders New York in search of Ann. He eventually finds her and, after destroying many army trucks and making a tip of Manhattan, he takes her up the Empire State Building. He tries to destroy a swarm of biplanes but is eventually shot down. Carl stands beside Kong's body and says \"It wasn't the airplanes. It was Beauty that killed the Beast.\"\n\nThe alternate ending occurs if the player defeats enough biplanes as Kong, and then destroys the army's searchlights, Kong will climb down the Empire State Building and a cut scene will play of Kong roaring on the top of his homeland, having been safely returned. To unlock the alternate ending, players must complete the entire game and then go back and play through various maps and earn a total of 250,000 points. It can also be accessed by using the cheat codes.\n\nThe Xbox 360 release featured improved graphics and audio over the sixth generation console releases. The second PC version, known as the \"Gamer's Edition\", (originally only available with select graphics cards and later offered on game download services) also included these improved features.\n\nThe \"Special Edition\" version of the game was available for a limited time. Along with the two standard game discs, included are: A bonus disc, containing concept art and a screensaver; and a making-of disc, containing a featurette with Peter Jackson. There was an error in the printing of the discs and the disc labelled \"Making of\" was actually the \"Bonus\" disc and vice versa. The signature edition also comes with a Topps trading card of King Kong, a code for a downloadable ringtone, and a cover signed by Peter Jackson.\n\nSymptomatic of early seventh generation console games, the Xbox 360 version was only correctly set up for HDTV, leaving the image on standard-definition TVs very dark and unsatisfactory for gameplay. As a result, Ubisoft recommended fans buy the Xbox version until a fix for the problem was produced. The patch was eventually released. The Xbox version is not backwards compatible with the Xbox 360 and the Xbox 360 version is not currently backwards compatible with the Xbox One.\n\nThe retail PC version is also known to utilize the StarForce copy protection system, which may cause unforeseen difficulties for players, especially those using Microsoft Windows 7. No patch has been released by the publisher to remedy this problem. However, the Gamer's Edition of the game is still playable on Windows 7 and in Windows 10 with no issues.\n\nThe Xbox 360 version of the game also had poorly coded shaders, allowing homebrew and unsigned code to run on the Xbox 360 through modified disc images of the game, which exploited the shader engine.\n\n\"Peter Jackson's King Kong\" was a commercial success, selling more than 4.5 million copies by the end of March 2006. The PlayStation 2 version received a \"Platinum\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe PC and console versions received critical acclaim, with critics praising the game's immersive environments, action sequences and ability to switch through two protagonists throughout the game. However, the Nintendo DS version was widely panned by reviewers because of bugs and glitches, poor level design and enemy AI. The DS version was listed in the 'Flat-Out Worst Game' list of GameSpot's Best & Worst of 2005. The PSP version received mixed reception, mainly for a shorter length, as well as cut down features from the console and PC versions.\n\nNon-video game publications gave the game generally positive reviews as well. \"The New York Times\" gave it a favorable review and stated, \"The sense of immersion is increased by the game's first-person perspective and an absence of on-screen clutter. There is no health gauge blocking your view; if a dinosaur bites you, your vision blurs, indicating that one more bite will kill you.\" \"The A.V. Club\" gave it a B+ and called it \"an instant classic.\" \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" gave it three-and-a-half stars out of five and said of the game, \"With a rather abrupt final sequence it does seem to rush to its climax, but despite its brevity, this is an unforgettable trip through the realm of Kong.\" \"Detroit Free Press\" gave the Xbox 360 version three stars out of four and called it \"A decent effort. And if you're a gamer who likes movies, this one's got all the cinematic feel and production value of a big-budget film.\" \"Maxim\", however, gave the PSP version a score of four out of ten and stated that \"while the PSP version adds a two-player Co-op mode, it also has wonkier controls than its console cousin, which weren't great to begin with.\"\n\n\"King Kong\" received the Spike TV Award for Best Group Acting Performance, Best Video Game Based on a Movie, and Best Leading Male Performance (Jack Black as Carl Denham). The game was humorously awarded the \"Most Long-Winded Game Title\" in the \"Dubious Honors\" category of GameSpot's \"Best of 2005\". It was also included on \"Game Informer\"s \"Top 50 Games of 2005\" list and was placed #10 on the \"Top 10 Heroes of 2005\" list.\n"}

PFL debuted its inaugural season on June 7, 2018 at Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden in New York, NY. Each champion in the six weight classes will win a championship prize of $1 million each.\n\nThe World Series of Fighting (WSOF) formed in 2012, having signed a broadcast deal with the NBC Sports Network. Soon after the promotion's event announcement, WSOF confirmed Bas Rutten and Michael Schiavello would be commentators for the debut event. In September 2013, commentator Kenny Rice, reporter Joey Varner, and ring announcer Jazz Securo were acquired and debuted. Todd Harris, who was under contract with NBC Sports, was the main play-by-play announcer. WSOF held 35 events.\n\nIn 2013, WSOF started the WSOF Global Championship brand that featured events in Japan, China, Philippines, and other destinations.\n\nIn 2017, MMAX Investment Partners, a group of Reston, Virginia investors, acquired a controlling stake in the WSOF. In April of the same year, they renamed the organization the Professional Fighters League.\n\nThe PFL 2018 season has 72 fighters in six weight-classes, competing in seven regular season events on Thursday nights in June, July, and August.

The PFL 2018 season will conclude on December 31 with six championship bouts back-to-back with a $10 million prize pool.\n\nPFL uses the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts regulated by the Nevada State Athletic Commission. The League uses a unique ten-sided (decagon) cage for their events.\n\nThe eight fighters with the most points in each weight class advance will advance to the playoff rounds. The point system consists of outcome-based scoring and bonuses for an early win. Under the outcome-based scoring system, the winner of a fight receives three points and the loser receives zero points. If the fight ends in a draw, both fighters will receive one point. The bonus for winning a fight in the first, second, or third round is three points, two points, and one point, respectively. For example, if a fighter wins a fight in the first round, the fighter will receive six total points.\n\nIn 2018, the seven regular season events (referred to as PFL1-PFL7) will be held at the Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden, the Chicago Theatre, GWU Smith Center, Nassau Coliseum, and Ocean Resort Casino.

It is a direct sequel to and introduces new puppets named Blitzkrieg, Bombshell, Kamikaze and Weremacht, who fight alongside the Nazis. It was released on October 9, 2012 by Full Moon Features.\n\nOzu, the villain from the previous film, walks down a dark alley only to be stopped by Kommandant Moebius, the Nazi general. Ozu offers him the puppet Tunneler, in exchange for her freedom. Moebius gladly takes the prize, which immediately kills SS Soldier #1. Moebius \"sets her free\" by shooting her in the head. While this takes place, the puppet Blade watches from the shadows. The next morning, Danny and Beth are recovering at Danny's house. Danny tells the rest of the puppets that he couldn't revive Ninja, but they will get back Tunneler. Blade appears and informs them of Ozu's death and Tunneler's capture by the Nazis. Danny and Beth respond to a knock at the door only to be grabbed by mysterious men in suits. Meanwhile, in a secret lab in Chinatown, Docter Freuhoffer, a captured Austrian doctor with a fixation on dolls, is working for Moebius to develop a machine that can reanimate the dead. The seductive Uschi, a Nazi, tries to motivate the doctor only to be interrupted by Moebius. He demands a demonstration of the machine. He brings in a Japanese man and slits his throat. The machine makes him walk for a moment only for him to decay and fall down. Freuhoffer promises to fix the machine. Moebius reminds him that if he doesn't, his daughter will be killed. He then presents him with Tunneler to study.\n\nDanny and Beth are revealed to have been taken to a military base. Major Collins commends them for thwarting the bombing of the weapons factory. He also informs Danny that General Porter will be in town and that he will present him with a medal. To protect them, he has Sergeant Stone assigned as their bodyguard. Back at the lab, Moebius and Uschi are discussing the machine and what it will mean for him. A soldier enters and informs him of General Porter's arrival. Back at Beth's house, Stone is settling in and getting on Beth's nerves with his sexist attitude. Back at the lab, Freuhoffer is examining Tunneler when Uschi enters and tries to again seduce him. Moebius enters and in a rage shoots Uschi through the head. Danny, Beth, and Stone eat and discuss how they can help their cause when Danny thinks Stone should be introduced to the puppets. Freuhoffer tries using the fluid he extracted from Tunneler in his machine to revive Uschi but it fails. Danny introduces a dumbfounded Stone to the puppets and tells him that the Nazi's have one of them that needs to be recovered. Freuhoffer shows Moebius his newest creation, Bombshell, a puppet made in Uschi's image with machineguns in her chest. Moebius, while amused, still wants his machine completed.\n\nDanny and the others take Blade and Pinhead to Chinatown to locate the Nazi base. They are ambushed by Bombshell and must retreat. Bombshell returns to the lab and Freuhoffer presents three other puppets Weremacht, a werewolf, Blitzkrieg, a tank, and Kamikaze, a walking bomb. Danny and the others are preparing for the award ceremony when Leech Woman tries to tell them something. During the awards, Freuhoffer's puppets attack, and kill Major Collins. Danny's puppets take them on but are beaten back. Porter, grateful to Danny, allows him to enter the army. Danny and the others ponder how to stop the Nazi puppets when Leech Woman pulls out Six-shooter's head. They locate the lab and take out the Nazi guards. Once inside, they locate and recover Tunneler, but are stopped by Moebius and Freuhoffer's puppets. The puppets fight and this time the Nazi puppets are beaten. Beth holds Freuhoffer at gunpoint, but lets him explain himself. Moebius and Stone fight and just as Stone gets the upper hand, Moebius stabs and kills him. Moebius comes at Danny, but is shot down by Six-shooter. Moebius, still alive, pulls out a gun and plans to shoot Danny, who states \"Never screw with America\". Blade then comes from behind and stabs Moebius. Beth and Freuhoffer come out and tells Kamikaze to detonate, destroying the lab and Moebius. Danny and Beth let Freuhoffer go but as he leaves the others didn't notice he has a bottle of the puppets' fluid.\n\n\n\nThese new puppets are Nazi puppets, created by Professor Freuhoffer \n\nAmong Doctor Freuhoffer's dolls is Freakshow's robotic baby, the Zuni killing doll and Retro-Tunneler's head from \"Killjoy 4\", \"Trilogy of Terror\" and \"Retro-Puppetmaster\".\n\nThe film was met with mostly negative to mixed reviews. *Dread Central panned the film, giving it 1/2 blades out of 5 and saying it \"is every bit as terrible as you might think, and then some\". Film Critic Dave Harlequin also gave a negative review with a score of 2.0/10, calling it \"by far the worst release in the near 25-year lifespan of the Puppet Master franchise\". Cinema Crazed praised \"Axis Rising\", calling it \"a solid horror film\".\n\n"}

Costain's book. It was filmed partly on location in England and Morocco which substitutes for the Gobi Desert of China. The film was partly conceived as a follow-up to the movie \"Prince of Foxes\", and reunited the earlier film's two stars.\nTalbot Jennings' screenplay was based on a popular novel of the same name by Canadian author Thomas B. Costain, published in 1945, introducing an anachronistic Saxon rebellion against the Norman aristocracy as a vehicle for launching the protagonists on their journey to the Orient. \n\nIt was nominated for Best Costumes-Color at the 23rd Academy Awards (Michael Whittaker). \n\nThe story begins in England approximately a century and a half after the Norman Conquest, or around 1300 A.D. Saxon scholar Walter of Gurnie is the illegitimate son of the Earl of Lessford and has been dispossessed of his inheritance by his father's Norman widow. After joining a group of Saxons who free hostages held by Lessford, Walter is forced into exile when he is recognized.\n\nWalter flees England, accompanied by his friend Tristram Griffen, a Saxon archer, and sets out to make his fortune in Cathay during the times of Pax Mongolica. Walter seeks the patronage of Mongol warlord General Bayan of the Hundred Eyes and agrees to fight for him. \n\nThe \"Black Rose\" of the title is the beauteous Maryam, a half-English, half-Mongol girl who has escaped from the harem Bayan is escorting to China. Disguised as a servant boy, she travels with Walter and Tristram in the caravan. Maryam loves Walter, but he is too interested in his adventure to pay her any attention. Tristram doesn't like all the killing and decides to get away. He takes Maryam with him because she wants to go to England.\n\nBayan sends Walter on a mission to see the Yuan Empress of China. When he arrives he is told that he must stay in China as a \"guest\" for the rest of his life. Then he finds Tristram and Maryam had also been captured and imprisoned. During this time, Walter realizes he loves Maryam. The three of them decide to escape. Tristram dies. The small boat in which Maryam is waiting for Walter in drifts away before Walter can catch her. Walter returns to England alone. \n\nWalter is welcomed back by the Norman King Edward because of all the cultural and scientific knowledge (including gunpowder) he has brought back from China. The king knights Walter and grants him a coat of arms. Two Mongol emissaries from Bayan show up. They have brought the Black Rose to England to join Walter there.\n\n\nIt was the first movie Henry Hathaway directed after an operation for cancer. He had a doctor with him on set. Hathaway later said he felt the movie was badly cast, saying Jack Hawkins was \"too old\" for his role (\"it should have been played by someone like Van Johnson\") and that Cecile Aubry \"didn't have a lick of sense. I tried to get Leslie Caron but Caron said she loved ballet and didn't want to be in pictures.\" He also says he and Orson Welles got along \"terrible\" because Welles would not follow direction. \"It pleased him to outwit people. That was the trouble with him throughout his career.\"\nTrade papers called the film a \"notable box office attraction\" in British cinemas in 1950.\n\nThere are unsubstantiated stories regarding a 40 second scene in the movie where the bodies of two Moroccan peasants can be seen hanging from a tree. The two bodies were said to have been offered to the movie director by a French colonel called Louis Morin (or Moran) due to his admiration for actor Orson Welles. The movie was shot in Morocco, which was a French colony at the time.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "173449", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=173449", "title": "Trinitron", "text": "Trinitron\n\nTrinitron is Sony's brand name for its line of aperture-grille-based CRTs used in television sets and computer displays. One of the first truly new television systems to enter the market since the 1950s, the Trinitron was announced in 1968 to wide acclaim for its bright images, about 25% brighter than common shadow mask televisions of the same era. Constant improvement in the basic technology and attention to overall quality allowed Sony to charge a premium for Trinitron devices into the 1990s.\n\nPatent protection on the basic Trinitron design ran out in 1996, and it quickly faced a number of competitors at much lower prices. Sony responded by introducing their flat-screen FD Trinitron designs (WEGA), which maintained their premier position in the market into the early 2000s. However, these designs were surpassed relatively quickly by plasma and LCD designs. Sony removed the last Trinitron televisions from their product catalogs in 2006, and ceased production in early 2008. Video monitors are the only remaining Trinitron products being produced by Sony, at a low production rate, although the basic technology can still be found in downmarket televisions from third parties.\n\nThe name Trinitron was derived from \"trinity\", meaning the union of three, and \"tron\" from elec\"tron\" tube, after the way that the Trinitron combined the three separate electron guns of other CRT designs into one.\n\nColor television had been studied, but it was only in the late 1940s that the problem was seriously considered. At the time, a number of systems were being proposed that used separate red, green and blue signals (RGB), broadcast in succession. Most systems broadcast entire frames in sequence, with a colored filter (or \"gel\") that rotated in front of an otherwise conventional black and white television tube. Because they broadcast separate signals for the different colors, all of these systems were incompatible with existing black and white sets. Another problem was that the mechanical filter made them flicker unless very high refresh rates were used. In spite of these problems, the United States Federal Communication Commission selected a sequential-frame 144 frame/s standard from CBS as their color broadcast in 1950.\n\nRCA worked along different lines entirely, using the luminance-chrominance system. This system did not directly encode or transmit the RGB signals; instead it combined these colors into one overall brightness figure, the \"luminance\". Luminance closely matched the black and white signal of existing broadcasts, allowing it to be displayed on existing televisions. This was a major advantage over the mechanical systems being proposed by other groups. Color information was then separately encoded and folded into the signal as a high-frequency modification to produce a composite video signal – on a black and white television this extra information would be seen as a slight randomization of the image intensity, but the limited resolution of existing sets made this invisible in practice. On color sets the signal would be extracted, decoded back into RGB, and displayed.\n\nAlthough RCA's system had enormous benefits, it had not been successfully developed because it was difficult to produce the display tubes. Black and white TVs used a continuous signal and the tube could be coated with an even deposit of phosphor. With the compatible color encoding scheme originally developed by Georges Valensi in 1938, the color was changing continually along the line, which was far too fast for any sort of mechanical filter to follow. Instead, the phosphor had to be broken down into a discrete pattern of colored spots. Focusing the right signal on each of these tiny spots was beyond the capability of electron guns of the era, and RCA's early experiments used three-tube projectors, or mirror-based systems known as \"Triniscope\".\n\nRCA eventually solved the problem of displaying the color images with their introduction of the shadow mask. The shadow mask consists of a thin sheet of steel with tiny holes photo etched into it, placed just behind the front surface of the picture tube. Three guns, arranged in a triangle, were all aimed at the holes. Stray electrons at the edge of the beam were cut off by the mask, creating a sharply focused spot that was small enough to hit a single colored phosphor on the screen. Since each of the guns was aimed at the hole from a slightly different angle, the spots of phosphor on the tube could be separated slightly to prevent overlap.\n\nThe disadvantage of this approach was that for any given amount of gun power, the shadow mask filtered out the majority of the energy. To ensure there was no overlap of the beam on the screen, the dots had to be separated and covered perhaps 25% of its surface. This led to very dim images, requiring much greater electron beam power in order to provide a useful picture. Moreover, the system was highly dependent on the relative angles of the beams between the three guns, which required constant adjustment by the user to ensure the guns hit the correct colors. In spite of this, the technical superiority of the RCA system was overwhelming compared to the CBS system, and was selected as the new NTSC standard in 1953. The first broadcast using the new standard occurred on New Year's Day in 1954, when NBC broadcast the Tournament of Roses Parade.\n\nIn spite of this early start, only a few years after regularly scheduled television broadcasting had begun, consumer uptake of color televisions was very slow to start. The dim images, constant adjustments and high costs had kept them in a niche of their own. Low consumer acceptance led to a lack of color programming, further reducing the demand for the sets in a supply and demand problem. In the United States in 1960, only 1 color set was sold for every 50 sets sold in total.\n\nSony had entered the television market in 1960 with the black and white TV8-301, the first non-projection type all-transistor television. A combination of factors, including its small screen size, limited its sales to niche markets. Sony engineers had been studying the color market, but the situation in Japan was even worse than the U.S.; they accounted for only 300 of the 9 million sets sold that year. But by 1961, dealers were asking the Sony sales department when a color set would be available, and the sales department put pressure on engineering in turn. Masaru Ibuka, Sony's president and co-founder, steadfastly refused to develop a system based on RCA's shadow mask design, which he considered technically deficient. He insisted on developing a unique solution.\n\nIn 1961, a Sony delegation was visiting the IEEE trade show in New York City, including Ibuka, Akio Morita (Sony's other co-founder) and Nobutoshi Kihara, who was promoting his new CV-2000 home video tape recorder. This was Kihara's first trip abroad and he spent much of his time wandering the trade floor, where he came across a small booth by the small company Autometric. They were demonstrating a new type of color television based on the Chromatron tube, which used a single electron gun and a vertical grille of electrically charged thin wires instead of a shadow mask. The resulting image was far brighter than anything the RCA design could produce, and lacked the convergence problems that required constant adjustments. He quickly brought Morita and Ibuka to see the design, and Morita was \"sold\" on the spot.\n\nMorita arranged a deal with Paramount Pictures, who was paying for Chromatic Labs' development of the Chromatron, taking over the entire project. In early 1963, Senri Miyaoka was sent to Manhattan to arrange the transfer of the technology to Sony, which would lead to the closing of Chromatic Labs. He was unimpressed with the labs, describing the windowless basement as \"squalor\". The American team was only too happy to point out the serious flaws in the Chromatron system, telling Miyaoka that the design was hopeless. By September 1964, a 17-inch prototype had been built in Japan, but mass-production test runs were demonstrating serious problems. Sony engineers were unable to make a version of Chromatron that could be reliably mass-produced.\n\nWhen sets were finally made available in late 1964, they were put on the market at a competitive 198,000 yen (US$550), but cost the company over 400,000 yen (US$1111.11) to produce. Ibuka had bet the company on Chromatron and had already set up a new factory to produce them with the hopes that the production problems would be ironed out and the line would become profitable. After several thousand sets had shipped, the situation was no better, while Panasonic and Toshiba were in the process of introducing sets based on RCA licenses. By 1966, the Chromatron was breaking the company financially.\n\nIn the autumn of 1966, Ibuka finally gave in, and announced he would personally lead a search for a replacement for Chromatron. Susumu Yoshida was sent to the U.S. to look for potential licenses, and was impressed with the improvements that RCA had made in overall brightness by introducing new rare earth phosphors on the screen. He also saw General Electric's \"Porta-color\" design, using three guns in a row instead of a triangle, which allowed a greater portion of the screen to be lit. His report was cause for concern in Japan, where it seemed Sony was falling ever-farther behind the U.S. designs. They might be forced to license the shadow mask system if they wanted to remain competitive.\n\nIbuka was not willing to give up entirely, and had his 30 engineers explore a wide variety of approaches to see if they could come up with their own design. At one point, Yoshida asked Senri Miyaoka if the in-line gun arrangement used by GE could be replaced by a single gun with three cathodes; this would be more difficult to build, but be lower cost in the long run. Miyaoka built a prototype and was astonished by how well it worked, although it had focusing problems. Later that week, on Saturday, Miyaoka was summoned to Ibuka's office while he was attempting to leave work to attend his weekly cello practice. Yoshida had just informed Ibuka about his success, and the two asked Miyaoka if they could really develop the gun into a workable product. Miyaoka, anxious to leave, answered yes, excused himself, and left. The following Monday, Ibuka announced that Sony would be developing a new color television tube, based on Miyaoka's prototype. By February 1967, the focusing problems had been solved, and because there was a single gun, the focusing was achieved with permanent magnets instead of a coil, and required no manual adjustments after manufacturing.\n\nDuring development, Sony engineer Akio Ohgoshi introduced another modification. GE's system improved on the RCA shadow mask by replacing the small round holes with slightly larger rectangles. Since the guns were in-line, their electrons would land onto three rectangular patches instead of three smaller spots, about doubling the lit area. Ohgoshi proposed removing the mask entirely and replacing it with a series of vertical slots instead, lighting the entire screen. Although this would require the guns to be very carefully aligned with the phosphors on the tube in order to ensure they hit the right colors, with Miyaoka's new tube, this appeared possible. In practice, this proved easy to build but difficult to place in the tube – the fine wires were mechanically weak and tended to move when the tubes were bumped, resulting in shifting colors on the screen. This problem was solved by running several fine tungsten wires across the grille horizontally to keep the vertical wires of the grille in place.\n\nThe combination of three-in-one electron gun and the replacement of the shadow mask with the aperture grille resulted in a unique and easily patentable product. In spite of Trinitron and Chromatron having no technology in common, the shared single electron gun has led to many erroneous claims that the two are very similar, or the same.\n\nOfficially introduced by Ibuka in April 1968, the original 12 inch Trinitron had a display quality that easily surpassed any commercial set in terms of brightness, color fidelity, and simplicity of operation. The vertical wires in the aperture grille meant that the tube had to be nearly flat vertically; this gave it a unique cylindrical look. It was also all solid state, with the exception of the picture tube itself, which allowed it to be much more compact and cool running than designs like GE's Porta-color. Some larger models such as the KV-1320UB for the United Kingdom market were initially fitted with 3AT2 valves for the extra high tension (high voltage) circuitry, before being redesigned as solid state in the early 70s.\n\nIbuka ended the press conference by claiming that 10,000 sets would be available by October, well beyond what engineering had told him was possible. Ibuka cajoled Yoshida to take over the effort of bringing the sets into production, and although Yoshida was furious at being put in charge of a task he felt was impossible, he finally accepted the assignment and successfully met the production goal. The KV-1210 was introduced in limited numbers in Japan in October as promised, and in the U.S. as the KV-1210U the following year.\n\nEarly color sets intended for the UK market had a PAL decoder that was different from those invented and licensed by Telefunken of Germany, who invented the PAL color system. The decoder inside the UK-sold Sony color Trinitron sets, from the KV-1300UB to the KV-1330UB, had an NTSC decoder adapted for PAL. The decoder used a 64 microsecond delay line to store every other line, but instead of using the delay line to average out the phase of the current line and the previous line, it simply repeated the same line twice. Any phase errors could then be compensated for by using a tint control knob on the front of the set, normally unneeded on a PAL set.\n\nReviews of the Trinitron were universally positive, although they all mentioned its high cost. Sony won an Emmy Award for the Trinitron in 1973. On his 84th birthday in 1992, Ibuka claimed the Trinitron was his proudest product.\n\nNew models quickly followed. Larger sizes at 19\" and then 27\" were introduced, as well as smaller, including a 7\" portable. In the mid-1980s, a new phosphor coating was introduced that was much darker than earlier sets, giving the screens a black color when turned off, as opposed to the earlier light grey. This improved the contrast range of the picture. Early models were generally packaged in silver cases, but with the introduction of the darker screens, Sony also introduced new cases with a dark charcoal color, following a similar change in color taking place in the hi-fi world. This line expanded with 32\", 35\" and finally 40\" units in the 1990s.\n\nIn 1980, Sony introduced the \"ProFeel\" line of prosumer component televisions, consisting of a range of Trinitron monitors that could be connected to standardized tuners. The original lineup consisted of the KX-20xx1 20\" and KX-27xx1 27\" monitors (the \"xx\" is an identifier, PS for Europe, HF for Japan, etc.) the VTX-100ES tuner and TXT-100G TeleText decoder. They were often used with a set of SS-X1A stereo speakers, which matched the grey boxy styling of the suite. The concept was to build a market similar to contemporary stereo equipment, where components from different vendors could be mixed to produce a complete system. However, a lack of any major third party components, along with custom connectors between the tuner and monitors, meant that systems mixing fully compatible elements were never effectively realized. They were popular high-end units, however, and found a strong following in production companies where the excellent quality picture made them effective low-cost monitors. A second series of all-black units followed in 1986, the ProFeel Pro, sporting a space-frame around the back of the trapezoidal enclosure that doubled as a carrying handle and holder for the pop-out speakers. These units were paired with the VT-X5R tuner and optionally the APM-X5A speakers.\n\nSony also produced lines of Trinitron professional studio monitors, the PVM (Professional Video Monitor) and BVM (Broadcast Video Monitor) lines. These models were packaged in grey metal cubes with a variety of inputs that accepted practically any analog format. They originally used tubes similar to the ProFeel line, but over time, they gradually increased in resolution until the late 1990s when they offered over 900 lines. When these were cancelled as part of the wider Trinitron shutdown in 2007, professionals forced Sony to re-open two of the lines to produce the 20 and 14 inch models.\n\nAmong similar products, Sony produced the KV-1311 monitor/TV combination. It accepted NTSC-compatible video from various devices as well as analog broadcast TV. Along with its other functions, it had video and audio inputs and outputs as well as a wideband sound-IF decoded output. Its exterior looks much like the monitor illustrated here, with added TV controls.\n\nBy this time, Sony was well established as a supplier of reliable equipment; it was preferable to have minimal field failures instead of supporting an extensive service network for the entire United States.\n\nSony started developing the Trinitron for computer monitor use in the late 1970s. Demand was high, so high that there were examples of third party companies removing Trinitron tubes from televisions to use as monitors. In response, Sony started development of the GDM (Graphic Display Monitor) in 1983, which offered high resolution and faster refresh rates. Sony aggressively promoted the GDM and it became a standard on high-end monitors by the late 1980s. Particularly common models include the Apple Inc. 13\" model that was originally sold with the Macintosh II starting in 1987. Well known users also included Digital Equipment Corporation, IBM, Silicon Graphics, Sun Microsystems and others. Demand for a lower cost solution led to the CDP series. In May 1988, the high-end 20 inch DDM model (Data Display Monitor) was introduced with a maximum resolution of 2,048 by 2,048, which went on to be used in the FAA's Advanced Automation System air traffic control system.\n\nThese developments meant that Sony was well placed to introduce high-definition televisions (HDTV). In April 1981, they announced the High Definition Video System (HDVS), a suite of MUSE equipment including cameras, recorders, Trinitron monitors and projection TVs.\n\nSony shipped its 100 millionth Trinitron screen in July 1994, 25 years after it had been introduced. New uses in the computer field and the demand for higher resolution televisions to match the quality of DVD when it was introduced in 1996 led to increased sales, with another 180 million units delivered in the next decade.\n\nSony's patent on the Trinitron display ran out in 1996, after 20 years. After the expiration of Sony's Trinitron patent, manufacturers like Mitsubishi (whose monitor production is now part of NEC Display Solutions) were free to use the Trinitron design for their own product line without license from Sony although they could not use the Trinitron name. For example, Mitsubishi's are called \"Diamondtron\". To some degree, the name Trinitron became a generic term referring to any similar set.\n\nSony responded with the FD Trinitron, which used computer-controlled feedback systems to ensure sharp focus across a flat screen. Initially introduced on their 27, 32 and 36 inch models in 1998, the new tubes were offered in a variety of resolutions for different uses. The basic WEGA models supported normal 480i signals, but a larger version offered 16:9 aspect ratios. The technology was quickly applied to the entire Trinitron range, from 13 to 36 inch. High resolution versions, Hi-Scan and Super Fine Pitch, were also produced. With the introduction of the FD Trinitron, Sony also introduced a new industrial style, leaving the charcoal colored sets introduced in the 1980s for a new silver styling.\n\nSony was not the only company producing flat screen CRTs. Other companies had already introduced high-end brands with flat-screen tubes, like Panasonic's Tau. Many other companies entered the market quickly, widely copying the new silver styling as well. The FD Trinitron was unable to regain the cachet that the Trinitron brand had previously possessed; in the 2004 Christmas season, they increased sales by 5%, but only at the cost of a 75% plunge in profits after being forced to lower costs to compete in the market.\n\nAt the same time, the introduction of plasma televisions, and then LCD-based ones, led to the high-end market being increasingly focused on the \"thin\" sets. Both of these technologies have well known problems, and for some time Sony explored a wide array of technologies that would improve upon them in the same way the Trinitron did on the shadow mask. Among these experiments were organic light-emitting diodes (OLED) and the field emission display, but in spite of considerable effort, neither of these technologies matured into competitors. Sony also introduced their Plasmatron displays, and later LCD as well, but these had no inherent technical advantages over similar sets from other companies. From 2006, all of Sony's BRAVIA television products are LCD displays, initially based on screens from Samsung, and later Sharp.\n\nSony eventually \"threw in the towel\" on Trinitron, ending production in Japan some time in 2004. In 2006, Sony announced that it would no longer market or sell Trinitrons in the United States or Canada, but continue to sell the Trinitron in China, India, and regions of South America using tubes delivered from their Singapore plant. Production in Singapore finally ended in March 2006, only months after ending production of their rear-projection systems. Two lines of the factory were later brought back online to supply the professional market.\n\nThe Trinitron design incorporates two unique features: the single-gun three-cathode picture tube, and the vertically aligned aperture grille.\n\nThe single gun consists of a long-necked tube with a single electrode at its base, flaring out into a horizontally-aligned rectangular shape with three vertically-aligned rectangular cathodes inside. Each cathode is fed the amplified signal from one of the decoded RGB signals.\n\nThe electrons from the cathodes are all aimed toward a single point at the back of the screen where they hit the aperture grille, a steel sheet with vertical slots cut in it. Due to the slight separation of the cathodes at the back of the tube, the three beams approach the grille at slightly different angles. When they pass through the grille they retain this angle, hitting their individual colored phosphors that are deposited in vertical stripes on the inside of the faceplate. The main purpose of the grille is to ensure that each beam strikes only the phosphor stripes for its color, much as does a shadow mask. However, unlike a shadow mask, there are essentially no obstructions along each entire phosphor stripe. (Larger CRTs have a few horizontal stabilizing wires part way between top and bottom, but in practice, they are not noticed.\n\nIn comparison to early shadow mask designs, the Trinitron grille cuts off much less of the signal coming from the electron guns. RCA tubes built in the 1950s cut off about 85% of the electron beam, while the grille cuts off about 25%. Improvements to the shadow mask designs continually narrowed this difference between the two designs, and by the late 1980s the difference in performance, at least theoretically, was eliminated.\n\nAnother advantage of the aperture grille was that the distance between the wires remained constant vertically across the screen. In the shadow mask design, the size of the holes in the mask is defined by the required resolution of the phosphor dots on the screen, which was constant. However, the distance from the guns to the holes changed; for dots near the center of the screen, the distance was its shortest, at points in the corners it was at its maximum. To ensure that the guns were focused on the holes, a system known as dynamic convergence had to constantly adjust the focus point as the beam moved across the screen. In the Trinitron design, the problem was greatly simplified, requiring changes only for large screen sizes, and only on a line-by-line basis.\n\nFor this reason, Trinitron systems are easier to focus than shadow masks, and generally had a sharper image. This was a major selling point of the Trinitron design for much of its history. In the 1990s, new computer-controlled real-time feedback focusing systems eliminated this advantage, as well as leading to the introduction of \"true flat\" designs.\n\nEven small changes in the alignment of the grille over the phosphors can cause the color purity to shift. Since the wires are thin, small bumps can cause the wires to shift alignment if they are not held in place. Monitors using Trinitron technology have one or more thin tungsten wires running horizontally across the grille to prevent this. Screens 15\" and below have one wire located about two thirds of the way down the screen, while monitors greater than 15\" have 2 wires at the one-third and two-thirds positions. These wires are less apparent or completely obscured on standard definition sets due to wider scan lines to match the lower resolution of the video being displayed. On computer monitors, where the scan lines are much closer together, the wires are often visible. This is a minor drawback of the Trinitron standard which is not shared by shadow mask CRTs.\n\nThis is a polyurethane sheet coated to scatter reflections and can be very easily damaged. The fix is to simply remove the sheet entirely, which one can do on Trinitron and Diamondtron CRT Monitors using a Stanley blade and a chopstick. Many users claim that removal of the anti-glare coating increases the overall light output of the display and results in more vivid colors and a sharper picture, but at the expense of reduced contrast and (as expected) increased reflection from light sources in front of the display screen.\n\n\n\n"}

Before long, Vince purchased a wooden dummy and dubbed him \"George.\"\n\nVince began working on Long Island with other performers, including Eddie Murphy, Rob Bartlett, and Bob Nelson at Richard Dixon's White House Inn in North Massapequa, New York. At first, Vince had wanted to do stand-up, but found he did better with a ventriloquist act; Vince has called George his \"safety net\", saying, \"He gets away with everything. Nobody ever gets mad at him.\"\n\nBefore finishing the course, he (along with George) hosted a two-hour children's program on Armed Forces television and radio. Vince was also the first $10,000 winner on ABC-TV's \"America's Funniest People\" in 1991.\n\nVince toured with the USO, entertaining United States troops. Vince and George appeared on numerous television shows, including \"Comedy Central, Good Morning America, The Joan Rivers Show, The Joe Franklin Show,\" and \"Comedy Tonight.\"\nOn occasion they opened for Soupy Sales, Henny Youngman, Robert Klein, Tiny Tim, Jay and the Americans, Martina McBride, Judy Collins, Bobby Rydell, Bobby Vinton, Little Anthony and the Imperials, and Boyz II Men.\n\nVince regularly performed at such places as Pocono Palace in the Pocono mountains, Caesar's Resorts, and The Tropicana in Atlantic City.\n\nDantona died on February 27, 2012, at the age of 62.\n"}
