In order to become \"top dog\" of the game, the player must race and defeat opponents through a variety of different stages all set in Los Angeles's infamous South Central region.\n\nThe game's title comes from two phrases common in the subculture. 187 is the California Penal Code section that defines murder. It has come into general use among gangs in the United States as a synonym for murder, and this usage has passed into popular culture via gangsta rap. \"Ride or die\" is a combination of the phrases \"ride it out\" and \"die trying\", meaning one is willing to do anything even if it involves personal risk.\n\nIf playing with another player, one can be the driver and the other can be the shooter. This can be done in the story and online mode. There are a variety of modes available to the player.\n\nThe game would later be ported to the PlayStation Portable under the title \"Street Riders\" on March 31, 2006.\n\n\"187 Ride or Die\" received \"mixed\" reviews on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.\n"}

It was shot in 1949 and released theatrically on July 8, 1950.\n\nThe Brooklyn Ice Palace shuts down after the Ice Frolics pack up to go to another show somewhere else, but during their departure, the Ice Frolics crew forget their star performer, \"Playboy\" Penguin. Playboy is found by Bugs Bunny, who vows to take him home. But, upon discovering penguins come from the South Pole, exclaims \"Ooh, I'm dyin'!\"\n\nTo go down south, Bugs and Playboy hitch a ride on a freight train to New Orleans.\n\nOnce in New Orleans, Bugs puts Playboy aboard a ship named \"Admiral Byrd\", which he believes is going to the South Pole. Afterwards, Bugs orders a carrot martini at La Bouche Cafe and stays for Mardi Gras. After hearing that the ship is actually headed for Brooklyn, Bugs swims out to it to rescue Playboy and finds him hanging upside down in the ship's kitchen among uncooked chickens, but rather than swimming back to New Orleans, they end up on a tropical island.\n\nWhile Bugs strums a guitar and composes a calypso ballad (six years before the style was popularized by \"The Banana Boat Song\"), Playboy is forced to build a dugout boat. As Bugs is playing, Humphrey Bogart, straight out of the film \"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\", appears and asks him if he can \"help out a fellow American who's down on his luck\". Bugs reaches into his pocket, digs around, and pulls out a coin and flips it at him and tells him to \"hit the road\".\n\nAfter ten days at sea, Bugs is beginning to feel hungry, having not taken any food with them. Upon looking at Playboy, Bugs remembers a hobo on the train saying that penguins are practically chickens, and decides to eat Playboy, but immediately snaps out of his daze and apologizes to Playboy, just as he spots land. The land, however, is the Panama Canal and when the guard at the first lock demands a quarter for passage through, Bugs refuses to pay it and decides he and Playboy will continue the journey on foot.\n\nWhile trekking rough South America, Bugs and Playboy end up in a cauldron of cannibals around Bolivia, Brazil, or Peru and are about to be eaten by the chanting natives when one comes running shouting \"El Bwana\" which scares the other natives away. Bugs Bunny intrepidly awaits the \"El Bwana\" which turns out to be Humphrey Bogart asking again \"Pardon me, but could you help out a fellow American who's down on his luck?\". Rather than berate him again, Bugs just gives him a coin for saving his and Playboy's life and then he and Playboy resume their journey.\n\nBugs and Playboy's route continues down through the rest of South America nearly straight to the South Pole, with Bugs having to swing through trees, outswim a hungry crocodile, scale a mountain in the Andes, and sail a boat through the South Pacific to the Antarctic.\n\nBugs brings Playboy to the exact South Pole and says that he [Bugs] has brought him home like he promised and is leaving, causing Playboy to cry. Bugs asks what's the problem now which Playboy shows Bugs a flyer for his performance which reads \"The Ice Frolics \"Presents\" The Only Hoboken Born Penguin In Captivity Skating The\" (\"which\" Hoboken is unspecified) and Bugs (realizing that regardless of which Hoboken it may be would still have to travel more than half the Earth to get Playboy to his true destination) yells that \"Ooh, I'm dying again!\" Humphrey Bogart appears yet again and starts to ask for Bugs' help. Just as Bogart says \"Say pardon me but...\" poor Bugs begs \"him\" if \"he can help out a fellow American who's down on his luck\". With that, he thrusts Playboy into Bogart's hands and runs off into the distance while laughing hysterically.\n\n\"8 Ball Bunny\" is the second appearance of Playboy; his first appearance was in 1949's \"Frigid Hare\". The Bogart voice was performed by impressionist Dave Barry (no relation to the humor columnist).\n\nWhile the film is introduced by the \"Looney Tunes\" music \"The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down\", the opening card indicates a \"Merrie Melodies\" Blue Ribbon release with the 1959–1964 red rings, as does the end card billed as a \"Vitaphone Release\", replacing the original green opening and ending sequences.\n\nWhen the short aired on ABC, the part where Bugs and Playboy are captured by South American natives is edited to remove the part where one of the natives runs to warn the group of \"El Bwana\" Humphrey Bogart coming and the group scattering. The scene was replaced with a frozen shot of Bogart's feet while the sound of the group muttering and fleeing was heard. However, the short has been aired uncensored (as recently as 2015) on Cartoon Network, Boomerang and the Canadian cable channel Teletoon Retro.\n\nThe short is included in the VHS release \"Looney Tunes Video Show Volume 3\", can be seen as a bonus feature on the DVD releases of the movie \"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\" (the Humphrey Bogart caricature in this cartoon short is based on Bogart's character in the film) and the documentary film \"March of the Penguins\". It is also featured uncensored and uncut and digitally remastered on of the \"Looney Tunes Golden Collection\" DVD set, as well as disc one of \"The Essential Bugs Bunny\".\n\n"}

Two-player mode is a race between two human opponents in split screen. The game also features weather effects.\n\n\"ATV: Quad Power Racing\" was received poorly by critics. GameSpot's Shane Satterfield wrote that for ATV enthusiasts the game may warrant a rental but others who are only mildly into the sport will be disappointed by the game's repetitive graphics, steep learning curve, and overall lack of variety or fun. IGN also gave low marks saying that \"This game has little to no balance, very poor racing AI and never really gets past go...or is that Start\".

{"id": "639539", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=639539", "title": "Adventure racing", "text": "Adventure racing\n\nAdventure racing (also called expedition racing) is typically a multi-disciplinary team sport involving navigation over an unmarked wilderness course with races extending anywhere from two hours up to two weeks in length. (What Is Adventure Racing Video) Some races offer solo competition as well. The principle disciplines in adventure racing include trekking, mountain biking, and paddling although races can incorporate a multitude of other disciplines including climbing, abseiling, horse riding, skiing and white water rafting. Teams generally vary in gender mix and in size from two to five competitors, however the premier format is considered to be mixed gender teams of four racers. There is typically no suspension of the clock during races, irrespective of length; elapsed competition time runs concurrently with real time, and competitors must choose if or when to rest.\n\nThe roots of adventure racing are deep and people debate the origin of the modern adventure race. Some point to the two-day Karrimor International Mountain Marathon, first held in 1968 as the birth of modern adventure racing. The Karrimor Marathon required two-person teams to traverse mountainous terrain while carrying all the supplies required to support themselves through the double-length marathon run.\n\nIn 1980, the Alpine Ironman was held in New Zealand. Individual competitors ran, paddled and skied to a distant finish line. Later that year, the Alpine Ironman's creator, Robin Judkins launched the better-known Coast to Coast race, which involved most of the elements of modern adventure racing: trail running, cycling and paddling. Australias 2-day WildTrek ran from 1981 through 2005.\n\nIndependently in 1982, the first expedition-length adventure race, a week-long, North American event called the Alaska Mountain Wilderness Classic debuted. The Classic involved wilderness travel—no roads, no pack animals, and no support teams, carry all food and equipment from start to finish—with less than 50 of its 150 mile length on trail. It continues today, changing courses every 3 years.\nIn 1989, the modern era of adventure racing arrived with Gerald Fusil's launch of the Raid Gauloises in New Zealand. Inspired by the Paris-Dakar Rally, Fusil envisioned an expanded expedition-style race in which competitors would rely on their own strength and abilities to traverse great and challenging terrain. The race included all the modern elements of adventure racing, including mixed-gender teams competing in a multi-day 400+ mile race. Building on Fusil's concept, the inaugural Southern Traverse was held in 1991.\n\nIn the early-90's, Mark Burnett read an L.A. Times article about Raid Gauloises and was inspired to compete and bring the race to the USA and promote the race as a major televised sporting event. After purchasing the rights from Gerald Fusil, Burnett launched the first \"Eco-Challenge\" race in 1995. Burnett promoted his event with Emmy-award-winning films (tapping the talent of Mike Sears to produce the films for the first two events). The Eco-Challenge was last held in 2002 when Burnett shifted his focus to Survivor, the Contender, the Apprentice and other reality based television shows. With the Eco-Challenge also came the name \"adventure race\", a phrase coined by journalist and author Martin Dugard, to describe the class of races embodied by the Raid and Eco-Challenge.\n\nThe United States Adventure Racing Association \"USARA\" was formed in 1998. The USARA was the first \"national governing body\" for the sport of adventure racing and arose from the need for safety standards, insurance and to promote the growth of adventure racing in the United States. The USARA has added national rankings, a national championship, ecological standards to the list of benefits provided for the sport of adventure racing.\n\nIn 2000, the inaugural United States Adventure Racing Association Adventure Race National Championship was held in Kernville, California. The USARA National Championship is typically held the first weekend in October and is considered the premier adventure race in the U.S. The USARA Adventure Racing National Championship has continued each year drawing the best US teams for a chance at earning the title of national champion.\n\nIn 2001, the inaugural World Championships were held in Switzerland with Team Nokia Adventure crossing the finishing line first. The concept of a world championship lay dormant until it was revived in 2004, with Canada's Raid the North Extreme serving as the AR World Championship event in Newfoundland & Labrador. The Adventure Racing World Series and its ultimate event, the AR World Championships have been held every year since. The 2013 World Championships were in Costa Rica, 2014 in Ecuador, 2015 in Brazil, 2016 in Australia, and 2017 in the United States. The 2018 event will be off the coast of Africa on the Reunion Island.\n\nIn 2002, the first major expedition length race to be held exclusively in the United States was launched. Primal Quest has been sporadically held since its inception - about 6 times from 2002 to 2017. In 2004, the death of veteran racer Nigel Aylott over-shadowed the race, and raised debates about the nature of Primal Quest and adventure racing.\n\nIn 2004, professional geologist Stjepan Pavicic organized the first Patagonian Expedition Race at the bottom tip of the American continent, in the Chilean Tierra del Fuego. Truly demanding routes through rough terrain of often more than 600 km soon made it be known as “the last wild race”.\n\nIn 2010, the German Adventure Race Series where held for the first time in three different locations all over Germany. Since then the popularity of the sport in Germany has grown every year. More races and venues have joined the series and the number of competitors are still growing from year to year. Competitors can start in teams of two (male, female or mixed) within the categories Master (15-20 h), Challenger (8-10 h) or Beginner (4-6 h).\n\nIn 2012, Commander Forer of the Royal Navy organized the first Sea-land navigation discipline race The Solent Amphibious Challenge. The race demanded the competitors to split up between sailing, running, and cycling in parts of the race and rendezvous at the end and sail the yacht to the finish line.\n\nIn December of 2017, the Adventure Racing Cooperative (ARC) was launched in the United States. It was formed in a grassroots movement to help promote and expand the sport of Adventure Racing in the United States. ARC is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit business.\n\nIn May 2018 World OCR, the world governing body for Obstacle Sports and related disciplines announced the Expedition OCR World Championships in collaboration with Primal Quest to be held in September 2018.\n\nIn June 2018 Eco-Challenge announced it would re-launch in 2019 with Bear Grylls and the original production team\n\n\nThe majority of adventure races include trail running, mountain biking and a paddling event. Navigation and rope work are also featured in all but the shortest races, but this is only the beginning. Races often feature:\n\n\nThe rules of adventure racing vary by race. However, virtually all races include the rules of racing: \n\nTypically races will feature an organizational meeting either the night before or the morning of the race. At this meeting the course will be revealed for the first time. For sprints, racers may follow a marked course. For longer races, racers may be given maps marked to show checkpoints (\"CPs\") or racers may be simply given a topographical map and coordinates (usually UTM coordinates) that indicate where the CPs will be found. Special rules, last minute changes and other information may also be provided at the meeting.\n\nRacers are required to visit a series of checkpoints or passport controls (CPs), usually in a specific order.\n\nMost races include one or more transition areas that teams can visit to replenish supplies. Typically, teams change to another mode of travel in a transition area. For instance, teams will end a trekking leg and transition to mountain biking in a transition area. Shorter races often feature a single transition area that teams may visit numerous times during the event. Teams will leave food, water, paddling and biking gear, fresh clothing and any other items they may need during the course of the race.\n\nLonger races feature multiple transition areas. Team gear is transported either by a support crew (provided by the team) or by the racing staff.\n\nVirtually all adventure races feature mandatory gear that must be carried during part or all of the race. Races will often include mandatory pre-race gear checks by race personnel and harsh penalties or disqualification may result if a team lacks the requisite equipment.\n\nIn addition to pre-race gear checks, many race organizers also include on-course gear checks. This helps to ensure that teams that start with approved gear, compete with, and finish a race with that same gear.\n\nAdventure races attract individuals of greatly divergent abilities. To make the sport more inclusive, many race directors will \"short course\" racers; allow racers who miss mandatory time cut-offs to continue racing on a reduced-length course. These racers will often earn an official finish time but be \"unranked\" and not eligible for prizes. Some races provide the option for teams to skip certain CPs but incur a time penalty (which often must be \"served\" during the race).\n\nMost adventure races are team events, with expedition length races typically requiring a set number of teammates (usually four or five) and requiring the teams to be co-ed. Many racers find the team aspect of adventure racing to be among the most enticing and demanding aspects.\n\nTeams typically elect a team captain and designate a team navigator. Teams have different views as to the functions of each of these positions, with some teams having very little structure, while others assigned specifics rights and responsibilities to each of these persons. For example, a team that stresses a democratic philosophy may limit the captain’s role to be the keeper of the racing passport and rules, and limit the navigator’s role to carrying the map and being primarily responsible for determining the team’s position at any given time. A more regimented team may give the captain ultimate responsibility for making all decisions regarding rest schedules, rule interpretations and the like, while the navigator has full responsibility for not only tracking the team’s location, but determining route choice as well.\n\n\n\nRace Organizations/Websites\n"}

The episodes were released between 2005 and 2011.\n\nIn December 2007, television industry trade magazine \"TelevisionWeek\" (www.tvweek.com) reported that \"Ask a Ninja\" creators Kent Nichols and Douglas Sarine made about $100,000 a month in ad revenue and income from merchandising and licensing from the show. In January 2007 Forbes listed The Ninja as one of the top \"Fictional Celebrities\" on the web.\n\nThe series, created by Los Angeles improvisational comedians Kent Nichols and Douglas Sarine, features a ninja who answers e-mails from \"viewers\" (a similar format to Ask Zorbak and Strong Bad Email, which was an influence on Ask A Ninja's creators according to Kent Nichols). According to an interview, \"Ask A Ninja\" was originally supposed to be an animated show about two Ninjas living in Orange County.\n\nThe episodes feature constant and erratic camera-angle changes, as well as enthusiastic and wild hand gestures by the Ninja. Each episode usually ranges from four to seven minutes, usually ending with Ninja's signature remark to each questioner: \"I look forward to killing you soon!\" New episodes had been released bi-weekly during the height of the podcast's popularity. Starting with Episode 23, \"Ninternships\", the behind-the-scenes-team decided to have sponsors for their episodes.\n\nAlthough episodes 1 to 16 are answered by Ninja in front of a featureless blue background, the action sometimes goes to other places, such as inside a car or another house. Episodes after the \"Ninja Omnibus\" episode use the Ninja edited onto a red circle gradient background, and episodes after the \"BBQ\" episode changed to blue.\n\nThe episodes start with the song \"I Am Ninja\", performed by The Neu Tickles and written by satirist Brently Heilbron.\n\nOn October 4, 2010 the web series returned to re-launch as a daily series with new videos each week day. The new lineup will feature an experimental sketch show along with a weekly wrap up show (Ask A Ninja Weekly Wrap) and a showcase of emerging web shows that the Ninja likes. Web series producer Brett Register, creator of \"The Crew\", \"A Good Knight's Quest\" and \"Craig & The Werewolf\", was hired on as the new day-to-day producer-director for \"Ask a Ninja\".\n\n\"Ask A Ninja\" has widespread popular appeal, and has appeared in numerous media outlets.\n\nDouglas Sarine was once asked to report as a guest film critic on National Public Radio's show, \"All Things Considered\"; his review there of \"\" is classified as a special delivery episode. In a 5- to 10-minute piece \"Ask A Ninja\" interviewed \"Blades of Glory\" stars Will Ferrell and Jon Heder for which he asked a series of movie related questions. At the end of the interview he ice skates circles around Olympic gold medalist Scott Hamilton. One notable episode was shot in the \"MythBusters\" warehouse with Jamie and Adam, where he disputed the theory of gravity, but when asked for proof, claimed he would have to perform a move in which he would simultaneously pull out both their brains.\nAt the end of older episodes, the Ninja advertised the Ninja-Mart Store, where viewers may buy \"Ask A Ninja\"-related merchandise. More recent episodes have ended with Ninja advertising Ask A Ninja's first DVD release in the style of HeadOn commercials. He's also advertised \"The Simpsons Game\" as well as Doritos. Ask a Ninja also started hosting their videos with CastFire's video hosting service, likely to add to their monetization strategy.\n\nRecently, Nichols and Sarine appeared as commentators on VH1's \"Best Week Ever\". The Ninja, however, does not appear with them. The Ninja appears alongside Margaret Cho in Liam Kyle Sullivan's \"Let Me Borrow That Top\" music video. The Ninja has also appeared as a judge on Yahoo's talent-show contest.\n\nOn April 11, 2007 episode of \"The Showbiz Show\", the Ninja, in a pre-recorded segment, provided a short review of the first episode of the final season of \"The Sopranos\".\n\nJessica Lee Rose appeared with Ninja in an episode called \"Jessica Lee Rose\" to celebrate his series' 50th episode anniversary and to comment on the death of lonelygirl15.

{"id": "53349949", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53349949", "title": "Barre (exercise)", "text": "Barre (exercise)\n\nBarre is a form of physical exercise, usually conducted in group classes in gyms or specialty studios. It is distinguished from other group fitness activities by its use of the ballet barre and its incorporation of movements derived from ballet. These classical dance movements and positions are combined with those drawn from yoga and pilates, and other equipment is sometimes used in addition to the barre, such as resistance bands, yoga straps, exercise balls and hand weights. Barre classes typically focus on small, pulsing movements with emphasis on form, alignment and core engagement. Participants hold their bodies still while contracting specific, targeted sets of muscles in isometric exercises. Repetitions tend to be high, range-of-motion small, and weights, when used, light (1–1.5kg or 2–3 pounds). Barre classes focus on the lower body, developing strength and flexibility from the ankles up though the calves, knees, thighs, and glutes. Holding muscles in contraction for extended periods frequently leads to them shaking as they fatigue. This is particularly true of thighs, as the quadriceps tire.\n\nParticipants wear activewear similar to that worn in yoga classes, and do the exercises either in bare feet or in socks. Some specialized socks (\"grip socks\") include non-slip features to increase traction.\n\nBarre classes attract people who want to develop the lean muscle tone of a ballerina. Supposed benefits include improved strength, posture, flexibility, balance, stability, endurance, and muscle definition, together with weight loss and reduced stress. The exercises target muscles that support and stabilise the body and which are often neglected in everyday life and by other forms of exercise. \n\nBeyond purely physical goals, barre develops control and a particular aesthetic.\n\nOne criticism of barre is that strength gains from small, isometric exercises do not build functional strength in the same way that compound movements common in traditional strength training do, because many of the movements used in barre class are not used anywhere but in dance. Furthermore, isometric movements are less effective than compound movements at encouraging muscle fibre growth and increased metabolic rate that will help reach weight loss goals. Neither are barre classes as effective as traditional aerobics classes at building cardio-vascular fitness, typically only raising heart rates to 40–50% of maximum. In terms of energy output, barre typically does not burn many calories and its energy demands more closely resemble walking than running.\n\nSome barre classes adopt the ballet aesthetic of keeping the lower back straight, achieved by tucking the pelvis. This practice can lead to back pain and injuries. The balletic plié movement used in many barre classes relies on bending the knee outwards with the legs rotated away from the centreline of the body. The pressure this places on the knees can increase the risk of knee injury, particularly if someone goes running immediately after a barre class.\n\nBarre was created by ballerina Lotte Berk in London in 1959. After injuring her back, Berk got the idea of combining her ballet bar routines with her rehabilitative therapy to form an exercise system. In 1959 she opened The Lotte Berk Studio in her West End basement. She numbered Joan Collins and Barbra Streisand among her students.\n\nOne of Berk's students, Lydia Bach, brought barre to the United States. She opened the Lotte Berk Method studio in New York City in 1971, where it operated until 2005. Instructors from the studio went on to found some of the major chains providing barre classes, including Physique 57, The Bar Method, and Exhale Spa.\n\nBarre rapidly expanded in popularity in the 2010s. By 2015, the Pure Barre chain alone had nearly 300 studios in the United States, and The Bar Method had over 80. The Los Angeles based chain Pop Physique popularized Barre by appealing to a younger urban hipster demographic, opening studios In Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco. Sadie Lincoln, co-founder of the barre3 chain of studios attributes the growth of popularity of barre to people wanting smaller, more connected fitness classes in the economic climate following the Global Financial Crisis. Tanya Becker, co-founder of the Physique 57 chain suggests that the appeal of barre is that classes deliver well-rounded exercise in a short space of time. The American Council on Exercise noted a rise in popularity of barre classes after the release of the 2010 movie \"Black Swan\".\n"}

It was written by Frank Miller, illustrated by David Mazzucchelli, colored by Richmond Lewis, and lettered by Todd Klein. \"Batman: Year One\" originally appeared in issues #404–407 of the comic book title \"Batman\" in 1987. As well as recounting Batman's early crime-fighting career, the story simultaneously examines the life of recently transferred officer James Gordon – eventually building towards their partnership.\n\nThere have been several reprints of the story: a hardcover, multiple trade paperback editions (one in standard comics paper with simpler coloring and one deluxe version with rich detailing in the colors — both colored by Richmond Lewis) and it has been included in \"The Complete Frank Miller Batman\" hardcover. The story arc was adapted into an in 2011.\n\nBatman (Bruce Wayne) is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics who debuted in \"The Case of the Chemical Syndicate\", a story published in \"Detective Comics\" #27 (May 1939). He was created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger to capitalize on the success of DC's other superhero Superman and was inspired by characters from pulp fiction stories, such as the Shadow. Batman's origin story was introduced in a two-page, 12-panel story by Kane and Finger from \"Detective Comics\" #33 (Nov. 1939). In the story, a young Bruce witnesses the murder of his parents Thomas and Martha at the hands of a mugger. Bruce vows to avenge his parents' deaths by fighting crime; he takes the persona of Batman after a bat flies through his window one night. For the story, Finger lifted elements from tales published in \"Popular Detective\" and \"The Phantom\", while Kane traced artwork of Tarzan and from \"Junior G-Men\".\n\nIn the years afterward, much of DC's continuity became convoluted and contradictory. Examples of this were present in Batman's origin: in a 1948 story, Finger gave the mugger a name (Joe Chill), and in 1956 wrote that he killed Bruce's parents on behalf of the mob. Finger also went on to suggest that the Batman persona was inspired by a bat costume Thomas wore to a masquerade ball. Other stories depicted Bruce traveling across the world to learn the skills he would need as Batman. In an effort to resolve continuity errors like these in the DC Universe, Marv Wolfman and George Pérez produced the 12-issue limited series \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\". Wolfman's plans for the DC Universe after \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" included relaunching every DC comic with a new first issue.\n\nDuring the production of \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", Frank Miller became the writer of Marvel Comics' \"Daredevil\". Miller had originally been the series' penciller, but editor Dennis O'Neil soon made him the series' writer. Sales rose dramatically after Miller began to write. For one critically acclaimed \"Daredevil\" story, Miller collaborated with artist David Mazzucchelli. Miller went to work for DC as well, and produced the influential four-issue limited series \"The Dark Knight Returns\" (1986). O'Neil also made the move to DC.\n\nThe contract Miller signed to produce \"The Dark Knight Returns\" also required him to write a revamped Batman origin story. While Miller handled the writing and artwork of \"The Dark Knight Returns\", he simply wrote \"Year One\", while Mazzucchelli joined to pencil. In the past, Miller had been overwhelmed by having to handle both writing and illustration duties. Todd Klein was the story's letterer, while Mazzucchelli's wife Richmond Lewis handled coloring. O'Neil edited the issues. According to O'Neil, the contract Miller and Mazzucchelli signed to produce \"Year One\" in the ongoing \"Batman\" series guaranteed publication within 6 months.\n\"Year One\" was originally conceived as a graphic novel. O'Neil, who had been asked to edit several issues of \"Batman\", was friends with Miller and was able to learn of the story. Reflecting on poor sales of \"Batman\", O'Neil caught Miller one day while on a walk in Los Angeles and convinced him and Mazzucchelli to serialize the story in the ongoing series. Miller was initially reluctant; he felt this would be hard because he had to ensure the story stayed canonical to the DC Universe, something he did not have to worry about when writing \"The Dark Knight Returns\". In addition, Miller's pacing would have to be altered because of ongoing series' relatively small page counts. O'Neil reasoned that \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" had completely remade the DC Universe, so Miller would be able to have the same creative freedom that \"The Dark Knight Returns\" provided. He also reassured Miller that he and Mazzucchelli \"weren’t going to lose anything\" by serializing it.\n\nMiller has said he kept Kane and Finger's basic story for \"Year One\" but expanded it. In writing the story, Miller looked for parts of Batman's origin that were never explored. He left the core elements, such as the murder of Bruce's parents, intact, but reduced them to brief flashbacks. Bruce's globe-trotting adventures was something Miller removed, as he found uninteresting. Rather than portraying Batman as a larger-than-life icon as he had in \"The Dark Knight Returns\", Miller chose to characterize \"Year One\"'s Batman as an average, inexperienced man trying to make a change in society because Miller believed a superhero is least interesting when most effective. Examples of this include Batman underestimating his opponents, getting shot by police, and his costume being too big. The story's violence was kept street-level and gritty, emphasizing noir and realism.\n\nIn illustrating, Mazzucchelli sought to make \"Year One\" look grimy, dark, and muted. His interpretation of Gotham City was designed to symbolize corruption, featuring muddy colors that gave the impression of the city being dirty and needing a hero. The newsprint paper used in \"Batman\" was unable to reproduce the bright coloring and visual effects of \"The Dark Knight Returns\", so Mazzucchelli took on \"Year One\" with a more grounded and darker approach.\n\nIn accordance with Wolfman's plans, O'Neil initially saw \"Year One\" as the start of the second volume of \"Batman\" and expected the first part to be its first issue. However, Miller rejected this idea. He explained: \"I don't need to slash through continuity with as sharp a blade as I thought. Doing the \"Dark Knight\" has shown me there's been enough good material... I didn't feel that fleshing out an unknown part of Batman's history justified wiping out 50 years of [adventures].\" Thus, the four \"Year One\" issues bear no continuity to past issues of \"Batman\".\n\nOne of the earliest collections of \"Year One\" was released in \"The Complete Frank Miller Batman\", published by Longmeadow Press in 1989. A dedicated collected edition, \"Batman: Year One\", was published as a trade paperback in October 1997 (). It is 96 pages long and contains the four \"Year One\" issues.\n\nDC released a hardcover \"deluxe edition\" of \"Batman: Year One\" () to coincide with the release of \"Batman Begins\" in April 2005. This release includes introductions by Miller and Mazzucchelli, the original penciled artwork, promotional and unseen Batman art, Lewis's color samples, and some pages of the original script, for a total of 144 pages. This edition was rereleased as a 136-page trade paperback in January 2007, with an introduction by O'Neil (). New versions of this edition were released in 2012 and 2017 ().\n\nTo celebrate Batman's 75th anniversary in November 2014, DC released a sample of \"Year One\" as a part of its \"DC Comics Essentials\" line of promotional comics. In 2015, a special package was released that contained the story and its ().\n\nIn November 2016, DC released a 288-page DC Comics Absolute Edition of \"Batman: Year One\". It comes in a slipcase with two hardcover books: one that reprints a remastered version of the story, with refined coloring; and another that reprints the original, unaltered story from 1987. Both books contain over 60 pages of bonus materials, including Miller's complete scripts.\n\nThe story recounts the beginning of Bruce Wayne's career as Batman and Jim Gordon's with the Gotham City Police Department. Bruce Wayne returns home to Gotham City at the age of twenty-five from training abroad in martial arts, man-hunting, and science for the past 12 years, and James Gordon moves to Gotham City with his wife, Barbara, after a transfer from Chicago. Both are swiftly acquainted with the corruption and violence of Gotham City, with Gordon witnessing his partner Detective Arnold John Flass assaulting an African-American teen for fun.\n\nAfter refusing a proposition from a teenage prostitute Holly Robinson, Bruce is reluctantly drawn into a brawl with her violent pimp and is attacked by several prostitutes, including dominatrix Selina Kyle. Two police officers shoot and take him in their squad car, but a dazed and bleeding Bruce breaks his handcuffs and causes a crash, dragging the police to a safe distance before fleeing. He reaches Wayne Manor barely alive and sits before his father’s bust, requesting guidance in his war on crime. A bat crashes through a window and settles on the bust, giving him the inspiration to become the Batman.\n\nGordon soon works to rid corruption from the force, but, on orders from Commissioner Gillian Loeb, several officers attack him, including Flass, who personally threatens Gordon’s pregnant wife. In revenge, the recovering Gordon tracks Flass down, beats him, and leaves him naked and handcuffed in the snow.\n\nAs Gordon becomes a minor celebrity for several brave acts, Batman strikes for the first time, attacking a group of thieves. Batman soon works up the ladder, even attacking Flass while the latter was accepting a drug dealer’s bribe. After Batman interrupts a dinner party attended by many of Gotham's corrupt politicians and crime bosses to announce his intention to bring them to justice, including Carmine \"The Roman\" Falcone, Loeb orders Gordon to bring him in by any means necessary.\n\nAs Gordon tries in vain to catch him, Batman attacks Falcone, stripping him naked and tying him up in his bed and dumping his car in the river, infuriating the mob boss. Assistant District Attorney Harvey Dent becomes Batman’s first ally, while Detective Sarah Essen and Gordon witness Batman save an old woman from a runaway truck, after Essen suggested Bruce Wayne as a Batman suspect. Essen holds Batman at gunpoint while Gordon is momentarily dazed, but Batman disarms her and flees to an abandoned building.\n\nClaiming the building has been scheduled for demolition, Loeb orders a bomb to be dropped on it, forcing Batman into the fortified basement, where he abandons his belt as it catches fire. A SWAT team led by trigger-happy officer Branden is sent in and attempts to trap Batman in the basement. After tranquilizing Branden, Batman dodges bullets as Branden's team opens fire on him, barely managing to survive after two bullet wounds. Enraged as the team’s carelessly fired bullets injure several people outside, Batman beats the team into submission and, after using a device to attract the bats of his cave to him, he flees amid the chaos. After witnessing him in action, Selina Kyle dons a costume of her own to begin a life of crime.\n\nGordon has a brief affair with Essen, while Batman intimidates a mob drug dealer for information. The dealer comes to Gordon to testify against Flass, who is brought up on charges. Upset with Gordon's exploits, Loeb blackmails Gordon against pressing charges with proof of his affair. After bringing Barbara with him to interview Bruce Wayne, investigating his connection to Batman, Gordon confesses the affair to her.\n\nBatman sneaks into Falcone’s manor, overhearing a plan against Gordon, but is interrupted when Selina Kyle, hoping to build a reputation after her robberies were pinned on Batman, attacks Falcone and his bodyguards, aided from afar by Batman. Identifying Falcone’s plan as the morning comes, the uncostumed Bruce leaves to help.\n\nWhile leaving home, Gordon spots a motorcyclist enter his garage. Suspicious, Gordon enters to see Johnny Vitti, Falcone's nephew, and his thugs holding his family hostage. Gordon decisively shoots the thugs and chases Vitti, who has fled with the baby. The mysterious motorcyclist, now revealed to the reader as Bruce Wayne, rushes out to chase Vitti. Gordon blows out Vitti's car tire on a bridge and the two fight hand-to-hand, with Gordon losing his glasses, before Vitti and James Gordon Jr. fall over the side. Bruce leaps over the railing and saves the baby. Gordon realizes that he is standing before an unmasked Batman, but says that he is \"practically blind without [his] glasses,\" and lets Bruce go.\n\nIn the final scenes of the comic, Flass turns on Loeb, supplying Dent with evidence and testimony, and Loeb resigns. Gordon is promoted to captain and stands on the rooftop waiting to meet Batman to discuss somebody called the Joker, who is plotting to poison the reservoir.\n\nDC's post-\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" revamp was a major success, raising sales 22% in the first year, and DC beat Marvel in direct market sales for the first time in August and September 1987. The four \"Year One\" issues were no exception to this. Two years before the relaunch, \"Batman\" had all-time low sales of 75,000 copies per month; \"Year One\" sold an average of 193,000 copies an issue, numbers not seen since the early 1970s. Despite this, it did not outsell other books like \"Uncanny X-Men\", and the collected edition sold well but never matched the sales of \"The Dark Knight Returns\". The story, with its noir-inspired narrative and dirty violence, quickly caught the attention of readers. The \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote that \"Year One\" offered an interesting and entertaining update to the origin of Batman.\n\n\"Year One\"'s characterization, particularly that of Batman and Gordon, has been praised. Hilary Goldstein (\"IGN\") compared their journey to friendship to the plot of the film \"Serpico\"; they found that the two characters' respective story arcs—with Gordon's \"illustrat[ing] the corruption in Gotham\" and Batman's detailing \"the transformation from man to myth\"—offered an exploration of Batman's world like no other. Glenn Matchett (\"ComicsVerse\") wrote that, unlike \"The Dark Knight Returns\", \"Year One\"'s Batman is more vulnerable and inexperienced, which made the story more memorable. Nick Roberts (\"Geek Syndicate\") thought the characters seemed believable, and comics historian Matthew K. Manning called the characterization realistic.\n\nThe story's depiction of Gotham and dark tone has also been acclaimed. Journalist James Lovegrove described \"Year One\" as a \"noir-inflected pulp tale of vigilantism and integrity, focused on a good man doing the right thing in a dirty world\" and noted the brutality of its fight sequences. Jason Serafino (\"Complex\") wrote that by ignoring many of Batman's trademark gadgets and villains, Miller managed to present Batman in a relatable and thrilling way. Goldstein found every moment memorable, writing \"Miller does not waste a single panel\" in presenting a gritty and dark story. Matchett agreed; he offered particular praise for the scenes depicting Batman clashing with the police, calling them the moment Batman began to become a legend.\n\nMazzucchelli's art was noted as a standout.\n\nBefore the New 52 in 2011, \"Batman: Year One\" existed in the mainstream DC continuity, and in the same continuity as the other storylines in Miller's \"Dark Knight Universe\", consisting of \"The Dark Knight Returns\", its sequel \"The Dark Knight Strikes Again\", \"\", \"The Dark Knight Returns: The Last Crusade\", \"Spawn/Batman\", and \"All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder\". However, following the New 52 reboot, \"\" replaced \"Year One\" as the official origin for Batman and \"Year One\" was relegated to the continuity of the other Frank Miller storylines.\n\nFollowing \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", DC rebooted many of its titles. \"Year One\" was followed by \"\", but the 1994 \"\" crossover erased \"Year Two\" from continuity. In another continuity re-arrangement, \"Catwoman: Year One\" (\"Catwoman Annual\" #2, 1995) posited that Selina Kyle had not actually been a prostitute, but, rather, a thief posing as one in order to commit crimes.\n\nLaunched in 1989, following the success of the film \"Batman\", the title \"\" examines crime-fighting exploits primarily, not exclusively, from the first four to five years of Batman's career. This title rotated in creative teams and time placement, but several stories directly relate to the events of \"Year One\", especially the first arc \"Batman: Shaman\". In 1998, Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale created \"\" and \"\", two 13-issue maxiseries that recounted Batman's early years as a crime-fighter following the events of Miller's original story and retold the origins of Two-Face and Dick Grayson. The \"Year One\" story was continued in the 2005 graphic novel \"\", following up on Gordon informing Batman about the Joker, and thus recounting their first official encounter. Two other stories, \"Batman and the Monster Men\" and \"Batman and the Mad Monk\" tie into the same time period of Batman's career, filling in the gap between Year One and the Man Who Laughs. The comics \"\" and \"\" describe his sidekicks' origin stories.\n\nAfter the critical failure of \"Batman & Robin\", several attempts were made to reboot the Batman film franchise with an adaptation of \"Year One\". Joss Whedon and Joel Schumacher both pitched their own takes. In 2000, Warner Bros. hired Darren Aronofsky to write and direct \"Batman: Year One\". The film was to be written by Miller, who finished an early draft of the script. The script, however, was a loose adaptation, as it kept most of the themes and elements from the graphic novel but shunned other conventions that were otherwise integral to the character. It was shelved by the studio in 2001, after an individual who claimed to have read Miller's script published a negative review on \"Ain't It Cool News\". In 2016, Miller stated the film was canceled because of creative differences between him and Aronofsky: \"It was the first time I worked on a Batman project with somebody whose vision of Batman was darker than mine. My Batman was too nice for him. We would argue about it, and I'd say, 'Batman wouldn't do that, he wouldn't torture anybody'\".\n\nIn 2005, Christopher Nolan began his series, with the reboot film \"Batman Begins\", which draws inspiration from \"Year One\" and other stories. \"Batman Begins\" and its sequel \"The Dark Knight\" are set during the same timespan and adopt several elements directly from the graphic novel. Major characters like Commissioner Loeb, Detective Flass and Carmine 'The Roman' Falcone are featured prominently in \"Batman Begins\". Film critic Michael Dodd argued that with each major motion picture focused on the Dark Knight's origins, the odes and references to the \"Year One\" comic increased. Comparing \"\" with \"Batman Begins\" he noted that \"...Phantasm was a Batman story with \"Year One\" elements, while \"Batman Begins\" was a \"Year One\" story with added features\".\n\nIn 2011, an was released as a DC Universe Animated Original Movie. It was produced by Bruce Timm, co-directed by Lauren Montgomery and Sam Liu. It features the voices of Benjamin McKenzie as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Bryan Cranston as James Gordon, Eliza Dushku as Selina Kyle/Catwoman, Katee Sackhoff as Sarah Essen, Grey DeLisle as Barbara Gordon, Jon Polito as Commissioner Loeb, Alex Rocco as Carmine 'The Roman' Falcone, and Jeff Bennett as Alfred Pennyworth. The movie premiered at Comic-Con, with a Catwoman short shown in October.\n\nThe second half of the fourth season of the Batman-based television series \"Gotham\" is inspired by \"Batman: Year One\".\n\n"}

{"id": "41891372", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41891372", "title": "Book test", "text": "Book test\n\nThe book test is a classic magic trick used by mentalists to demonstrate telepathy-like effects. The name refers to its early use as a test of mental powers.\n\nAn audience member (the \"spectator\") is called onstage to assist the mentalist. The spectator is shown one or more books, and asked to read a random passage from one of them. The passage may be revealed to the audience, or recorded in some other way for later comparison. The mentalist then typically presents a routine to establish an atmosphere or back story, and proceeds to read the spectator's mind to reveal elements relating to the passage read by the spectator.\n\nBooks have been used as props as long ago as the 1450s. In one particularly common trick, the \"blow book\", spectators would blow on the pages of a book which would then reveal images, colors, or text. However, these were not similar to modern book tests, as the \"magic\" was simply the change in appearance.\n\nThe modern concept of the book test involves the magician revealing a word, phrase, or image that the spectator has selected at random. The earliest known example is a variation on the modern Twenty One Card Trick, in which a series of operations reveals the chosen item through basic mathematics. The magician first asks a spectator to choose a word or figure on a starting page. An associated number, say the column or group that the figure appears in, is used to select another page. For instance, if the spectator picks a figure in column two, they might flip forward two pages. Here the spectator sees the same figure somewhere else on the page, and repeats the process. After three flips the magician stops them and reveals the figure.\n\nIt is known that a version of this sort of book test was created by well-known publisher Girolamo Scotto and demonstrated for the Emperor of Austria in 1572. However, printed versions from this time are not extant. The earliest surviving example was found by Italian magician Vanni Bossi in the book \"Il Laberinto\", originally published in 1607 by Andrea Ghisi. An English translation was published in 1610 under the title \"Wits laberynth, or, the exercise of idlenesse\". It is believed \"Wits laberynth\" was the inspiration for the same trick in Nicholas Hunt's \"Newe Recreations\", published in London in 1631.\n\nModern variations of the original \"labyrinth\" concept using gimmicked books are widespread, although they vary greatly in nature. The first modern example is widely suggested to have been introduced by Johann Nepomuk Hofzinser sometime between 1865 and 1875, generally known simply as \"The Word\". Variations using a single page that can be inserted into other books, sometimes known as the \"True Test\" or \"Modern Magazine Test\", were first developed by in the 1930s by U.F. Grant, a well-known inventor of magic tricks.\n\nA very different style of book test uses unmodified books, and yet produces similar results. Originally developed by magician David Hoy and published in his 1963 \"The Bold and Subtle Miracles of Dr. Faust\", the \"Bold Book Test\" is widely considered a classic and inventive trick. The trick, often with Hoy's name removed, has been published in dozens of books and pamphlets.\n\nThe book test has been a staple of mentalist acts throughout the 20th century. One of the best known variations of this trick was repeatedly performed by The Piddingtons, whose version included elaborate stagecraft that placed Lesley Piddington, the \"reader\", in a variety of bizarre locations, from London Tower to a diving bell. James Randi uses the trick as a staple of his impromptu shows, selecting among a wide variety of methods at whim.\n\nThere are many versions of the book test. The magician may use a single book, a single page or multiple books. In each case there are multiple variants. Methods using more than one book generally used unmodified books, or \"naturals\". These can be distinguished because the mentalist hands the books to the spectator to choose among, and has some sort of riffle or fast flipping of the pages later in the trick. Methods using a modified book, a \"gimmick\", allow free selection of the word from any page. In cases using the dictionary test principle have the magician holding the book in front of them, facing out.\n\nAnother major class of book tests involves a mnemonic device to distribute \"money words\" across a page. For instance, a given page might have the word \"Abermarle\" on it, and this would be the only \"proper name\" that starts with the letter A and the spectator would be invited to select a proper name beginning with A. \"Hybrid\" systems replace the gimmick book with a single gimmick page, which is styled and sized to fit within a target magazine or book. The mentalist must prepare the book themselves, inserting the page into any suitable book or magazine. For this version, the mentalist must use some form of a equivocation to ensure the spectator chooses the right page. There are a wide variety of forces used for this purpose.\n\nIn both cases the spectator is handed the gimmicked book, or allowed to select among many similar examples. The spectator is then instructed to open and select a word off the page, with the word selection being limited, for example only allowing \"odd words\" or \"proper names.\" The mentalist then asks the spectator a single question, typically \"what is the first letter of the word you are thinking of?\" They then apply the mnemonic to return the word, and reveal.\n\nThere are a variety of systems used to create the word selection. The original method, called \"The Word,\" was developed by U.F. Grant, but a number of variations exist. All require some preparation to use properly.\n\nThe \"dictionary test\" is a gimmicked book test that anyone can prepare using any book, but works best with dictionaries, encyclopedias, books of lists, or other texts where there is some sort of obvious first word that is called out in the text.\n\nUsing a dictionary, the gimmick is prepared by finding the first defined word on the left page, which is normally bolded or larger, and writing it in fine pencil on the top of the right page. The magician then holds the book open in front of the spectator and riffles with the left hand, and asks the spectator to call \"stop\" at any point. The magician then points to the upper right corner (blindly, as the book is still facing away from the magician) and while the spectator is looking there, peeks at the other corner, which is turned just enough to be visible.\n\nA commercial variation of the dictionary test is known as \"Flashback,\" and comes in the form of a complete gimmicked book. Instead of the word appearing faintly at the top of the page, it is arranged so the last word on the left page is the same as the first word on the right page. In some forms the antonym appears on the mirror page, instead of the same word. For instance, if the word \"day\" appears as the first word on the left page, a straight flashback would put the word \"day\" on the left page, while an antonym version puts \"night\" there instead. Flashback variations are often incorporated in gimmick books supporting other methods as well.\n\nThe \"Page, Line and Word\" trick uses two or three spectators, handing one a book (the \"reader\"), another an envelope, and the third pencil and paper (the \"writer\"). The writer is asked to \"imagine\" opening the book and selecting a word at random, and then writes down the page, line and word number they imagined. The magician then palms the writer's slip and hands a prepared slip to the reader, who opens the book to the selected section. The third spectator then opens the envelope to reveal the same word.\n\nThe \"1089 force\" is a natural that relies on the mathematical manipulation of three-digit numbers such that the answer to a series of seemingly random operations will always result in the number 1089. The spectator is then asked to turn to page 108 and read the 9th word. Mathematical forces of this sort, similar to the original \"labyrinth\" type tests, are no longer common as these are widely known to the audience.\n\nThe \"coin force,\" which can be performed with a number of props instead of coins, is essentially a combination of the natural and the flashback concepts. A word or statement from a natural is selected, and then some sort of marker, normally a quarter, is inserted in that page near the spine. As the magician riffles the book, they can easily flip to that page when the spectator calls \"stop\". This relies on nothing other than the magician holding the book firmly by the spine while it is riffled, both to obscure the coin as well as to keep it from falling out.\n\n\n"}

In 2005, it placed an overall cap on worldwide voting membership \"which now stands at approximately 6,500\".\n\nBAFTA does not receive any funding from the government: it relies on income from membership subscriptions, individual donations, trusts, foundations and corporate partnerships to support its ongoing outreach work.\n\nBAFTA has offices in Scotland and Wales in the UK, in Los Angeles and New York in the United States and runs events in Hong Kong and mainland China.\n\nAmanda Berry OBE has been chief executive of the organisation since December 2000.\n\nIn addition to its high-profile awards ceremonies, BAFTA manages a year-round programme of educational events and initiatives including film screenings and Q&As, tribute evenings, interviews, lectures, and debates with major industry figures. With over 250 events a year, BAFTA's stated aim is to inspire and inform the next generation of talent by providing a platform for some of the world's most talented practitioners to pass on their knowledge and experience.\n\nMany of these events are free to watch online at BAFTA Guru and via its official channel on YouTube.\n\nBAFTA runs a number of scholarship programmes across the UK, US and Asia.\n\nLaunched in 2012, the UK programme enables talented British citizens who are in need of financial support to take an industry-recognised course in film, television or games in the UK. Each BAFTA Scholar receives up to £12,000 towards their annual course fees, and mentoring support from a BAFTA member and free access to BAFTA events around the UK. Since 2013, three students every year have received one of the Prince William Scholarships in Film, Television and Games, supported by BAFTA and Warner Bros. These scholarships are awarded in the name of [Prince William, Duke of Cambridge] in his role as President of BAFTA.\n\nIn the US, BAFTA Los Angeles offers financial support and mentorship to British graduate students studying in the US, as well as scholarships to provide financial aid to local LA students from the inner city. BAFTA New York's Media Studies Scholarship Program, set up in 2012, supports students pursuing media studies at undergraduate and graduate level institutions within the New York City area and includes financial aid and mentoring opportunities.\n\nSince 2015, BAFTA has been offering scholarships for British citizens to study in China, vice versa.\n\nBAFTA presents awards for film, television and games, including children's entertainment, at a number of annual ceremonies across the UK and in Los Angeles, USA.\n\nThe BAFTA award trophy is a mask, designed by American sculptor Mitzi Cunliffe. When the Guild merged with the British Film Academy to become the Society of Film and Television Arts, later the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, the first 'BAFTA award' was presented to Sir Charles Chaplin on his Academy Fellowship that year.\n\nToday's BAFTA award – including the bronze mask and marble base – weighs 3.7 kg and measures 27 cm (h) x 14 cm (w) x 8 cm (d); the mask itself measures 16 cm(h) x 14 cm (w).\n\nIn 2017, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts introduced new entry rules for British Films Only starting from 2018 season. \n\nBAFTA's annual film awards ceremony is known as the British Academy Film Awards, or \"the BAFTAs\", and reward the best work of any nationality seen on British cinema screens during the preceding year. In 1949 the British Film Academy, as it was then known, presented the first awards for films made in 1947 and 1948. Since 2008 the ceremony has been held at the Royal Opera House in London's Covent Garden. It had been held in the Odeon cinema on Leicester Square since 2000. \nSince 2017, the BAFTA ceremony has been held at the Royal Albert Hall. The ceremony had been performed during April or May of each year, but since 2002 it has been held in February to precede the academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' (AMPAS) Academy Awards, or Oscars.\n\nIn order for a film to be considered for a BAFTA nomination its first public exhibition must be displayed in a cinema and it must have a UK theatrical release for no fewer than seven days of the calendar year that corresponds to the upcoming awards. A movie must be of feature length and movies from all countries are eligible in all categories, with the exception of the Alexander Korda Award for Outstanding British Film and Outstanding Debut which are for British films or individuals only.\n\nThe British Academy Television Awards ceremony usually takes place during April or May, with its sister ceremony, the British Academy Television Craft Awards, usually occurring within a few weeks of it.\n\nThe Television Awards, celebrating the best TV programmes and performances of the past year, are also often referred to simply as \"the BAFTAs\" or, to differentiate them from the movie awards, the \"BAFTA Television Awards\". They have been awarded annually since 1954. The first ever ceremony consisted of six categories. Until 1958, they were awarded by the Guild of Television Producers and Directors.\n\nFrom 1968 until 1997, BAFTA's Film and Television Awards were presented together, but from 1998 onwards they were presented at two separate ceremonies.\n\nThe Television Craft Awards celebrate the talent behind the programmes, such as individuals working in visual effects, production, and costume design.\n\nOnly British programmes are eligible – with the potential exception of the publicly voted Audience Award – but any cable, satellite, terrestrial or digital television stations broadcasting in the UK are eligible to submit entries, as are independent production companies who have produced programming for the channels. Individual performances can either be entered by the performers themselves or by the broadcasters. The programmes being entered must have been broadcast on or between 1 January and 31 December of the year preceding the awards ceremony.\n\nFrom 2014 the \"BAFTA Television Awards\" will be open to TV programmes which are only broadcast online.\n\nThe British Academy Games Awards ceremony traditionally takes place in March, shortly after the Film Awards ceremony in February.\n\nBAFTA first recognised video games and other interactive media at its inaugural \"BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Awards\" ceremony during 1998, the first major change of its rules since the admittance of television thirty years earlier. Among the first winning games were \"GoldenEye 007\", \"Gran Turismo\" and interactive comedy \"MindGym\", sharing the spotlight with the \"BBC News Online\" website which won the news category four years consecutively. These awards allowed the academy to recognise new forms of entertainment that were engaging new audiences and challenging traditional expressions of creativity.\n\nDuring 2003, the sheer ubiquity of interactive forms of entertainment and the breadth of genres and types of video games outgrew the combined ceremony, and the event was divided into the \"BAFTA Video Games Awards\" and the BAFTA Interactive Awards Despite making headlines with high-profile winners like \"Halo 2\" and \"Half-Life 2\" the interactive division was discontinued and disappeared from BAFTA's publicity material after only two ceremonies.\n\nDuring 2006, BAFTA announced its decision \"to give video games equal status with film and television\", and the academy now advertises video games as its third major topic in recognition of its importance as an art form of moving images. The same year the ceremony was performed at The Roundhouse by Chalk Farm Road in North London on 5 October and was televised for the first time on 17 October and was broadcast on the digital channel E4.\n\nSince 2009, the ceremonies have been performed at the London Hilton Park Lane and Tobacco Dock, London, and have been hosted by Dara Ó Briain and Rufus Hound.\n\nThe British Academy Children's Awards are presented annually during November to reward excellence in the art forms of the moving image intended for children. They have been awarded annually since 1969.\n\nThe academy has a long history of recognising and rewarding children's programming, presenting two awards at the 1969 ceremony – The Flame of Knowledge Award for Schools Programmes and the Harlequin Award for Children's Programmes.\n\nSince 2007 the Children's Awards have included a Kids Vote award, voted by children between seven and 14. BAFTA Kids Vote is the annual competition for children aged between seven and 12 which is now part of BAFTA's year-round BAFTA Kids programme of activity helping children \"discover, explore and find out more about the worlds of films, television and games by providing content, information and experiences\". The CBBC Me and My Movie award, a children's filmmaking initiative to inspire and enable children to make their own movies and tell their own stories, has been discontinued.\n\nPresidents\n\nVice-Presidents\n\nPrince William, the Duke of Cambridge, has been President of the academy since February 2010.\n\nThe Duke's appointment follows a long tradition of royal involvement with the academy. Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, was the first President of the Society of Film and Television Arts (SFTA) in 1959 to 1965, followed by Earl Mountbatten of Burma and the Princess Royal, who was its President from 1972 to 2001. It was the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh's generous donation of their share of profits from the film \"Royal Family\" that enabled the academy to move to its headquarters at 195 Piccadilly. The Duke of Cambridge succeeded Lord (Richard) Attenborough to become the academy's fifth president in its history.\n\nBAFTA Los Angeles, founded in 1987, serves as the bridge between the Hollywood and British production and entertainment business communities. The BAFTA Los Angeles location hosts a series of events, including the Britannia Awards, the Awards Season Film and Television Tea Parties in January and September and the annual Garden Party.\n\nBAFTA Los Angeles provides access to screenings, Q&As with creative talent, produces seminars with UK film and television executives and the Heritage Archive, featuring interviews with British members of the film and television industries. The Los Angeles location also hosts the Student Film Awards and has an active Scholarship Program offering financial support and mentorship to UK students studying in the US. It created The Inner City Cinema, a screening program providing free screenings of theatrical films to inner city areas not served by theatres. The success of Inner City Cinema has led to further free screening programs extended to multiple inner city parks through the academy's work with both the County of Los Angeles Department of Parks and Recreation (Parks After Dark) and The City of Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks (Teen Summer Camps).\n\nThe Britannia Awards are BAFTA Los Angeles' highest accolade, a \"celebration of achievements honouring individuals and companies that have dedicated their careers to advancing the entertainment arts\". The Awards began in 1989 and usually take place in October/November every year. There are no awards given to specific movies or TV programmes, only to individuals. During the first ten years, one award was given at each event, named the 'Britannia Award for Excellence in Film', but since 1999 the number of awards has increased.\n\nAwards given include 'The Stanley Kubrick Britannia Award for Excellence in Film' (the original award was renamed during 2000 to honour director Stanley Kubrick), presented to an individual \"upon whose work is stamped the indelible mark of authorship and commitment, and who has lifted the craft to new heights\"; 'The John Schlesinger Britannia Award for Artistic Excellence in Directing' (added during 2003 in honour of John Schlesinger); the 'Britannia Award for British Artist of the Year'; and the 'Albert R. Broccoli Britannia Award for Worldwide Contribution to Filmed Entertainment'. In select years, the evening has included the 'BAFTA Los Angeles Humanitarian Award'.\n\nThe show has been broadcast on TV around the world, including the TV Guide Network and BBC America in the United States.\n\nBAFTA Scotland is a branch of the academy located in Glasgow, Scotland.\n\nSince 1986, BAFTA has continued to specifically champion the film, television and game industries in Scotland by celebrating excellence, championing new Scottish talent and reaching out to the public.\n\nThe British Academy Scotland Awards are BAFTA Scotland's annual awards ceremony, celebrating and rewarding the highest achievements in Scottish film, television and games.\n\nBAFTA Scotland also produces the annual New Talent Awards ceremony, shining a spotlight on new and emerging Scottish talent in the art forms of moving image. Since they began in 1996, the annual New Talent Awards highlight the creativity that exists in Scotland by recognising and rewarding talented individuals who have started to work in the film, television and games industries.\n\nBAFTA Cymru is a branch of the academy formed in 1991 and extends the charity's mission across the UK in support of Wales' creative communities.\n\nFor over 25 years BAFTA Cymru has celebrated Welsh talent across film and television production and craft and performance roles with the British Academy Cymru Awards, its annual awards ceremony that takes place in Cardiff. In 2016, having reviewed the eligibility criteria for last year's awards, BAFTA Cymru now encourages Welsh individuals who have worked on Welsh or UK productions – rather than solely Welsh productions – to enter into any one of the 16 craft and performance categories, \"[ensuring] that BAFTA in Wales can recognise the work of talented individuals who are working on network productions in craft or performance roles across the UK.\"\n\nBAFTA New York founded in 1996, recognises and promotes the achievements of British film and television in New York and all along the East Coast.\n\nIt hosts feature film, television and documentary screenings, panel discussions, premieres and co-produced events with other established organisations in the film and television industry, and runs an educational outreach program aimed at underserved youth in New York City that includes the BAFTA New York Media Studies Scholarship Program.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "9971388", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9971388", "title": "Carl Sternheim", "text": "Carl Sternheim\n\nCarl Sternheim (born William Adolph Carl Francke; 1 April 1878 – 3 November 1942) was a German playwright and short story writer. One of the major exponents of German Expressionism, he especially satirized the moral sensibilities of the emerging German middle class during the Wilhelmine period.\n\nSternheim was born in Leipzig, the son of Rosa Marie Flora (née Francke) {1856-1908} and Carl Julius Sternheim {1852-1918}, a banker. His parents married two years after he was born. His father was Jewish and his mother was a Lutheran from a working-class family. Sternheim grew up in Hannover and Berlin. Between 1897 and 1902, he studied philosophy, psychology, and jurisprudence intermittently at the Universities of Munich, Göttingen, and Leipzig, but never graduated. In 1900, he began working as a freelance writer in Weimar, where he met and married his first wife Eugenie Hauth the same year. Their union ended in 1906 and he married the writer Thea Löwenstein (née Bauer) in 1907, with whom he had two children. Their daughter Dorothea (\"Mopsa\") was a resistance fighter during the Second World War and was detained by the Nazi's in Ravensbrück concentration camp.\n\nThe wealth brought by Thea from her rich manufacturing family enabled the couple to build the Schloss Bellemaison in Munich. Here, Sternheim worked in the company of fellow artists such as Mechtilde Lichnowsky, Max Reinhardt, and Frank Wedekind, and assembled his own art collection. In 1908, he collaborated with Franz Blei to launch the Expressionist literary journal \"Hyperion\", which published the first eight prose works by Franz Kafka. He also contributed occasionally to the Expressionist journal \"Die Aktion\". In 1912, he relocated with his family to Belgium and in 1918, they fled the fighting of World War I and temporarily moved to St. Moritz and Uttwil in Switzerland. Sternheim and Thea divorced in 1927. His next marriage, to actress and singer Pamela Wedekind, took place in 1930 and lasted until 1934, after which he lived with Henriette Carbonara. Sternheim died in Ixelles (Brussels) during World War II and was buried in the Ixelles Cemetery. A friend of his, Marcel Hastir (1906–2011), was buried in the same tomb.\n\nSternheim's circle of prominent friends included Gottfried Benn, Carl Einstein, Franz Pfemfert, Walther Rathenau, Ernst Stadler, Hugo von Tschudi, Fritz von Unruh, and Otto Vrieslander. In 1915, he presented the prize money for the Fontane Prize to the then largely unknown Kafka. The Nazi authorities banned Sternheim's work not only because of his partial Jewish descent but also because of his savage comedic assaults on the perceived moral corruption of the German bourgeoisie.\n\nSternheim's works remain popular in Germany, but English language productions of them are rare. This is in part due to the large number of English comedies already in existence, bypassing the need for translations of German comedies. Academics have also argued that Sternheim's works are sometimes hard to sell to the market in foreign languages due to the difficulty in categorising his style as belonging to any one specific movement.\n\nAs a result, Sternheim's plays have rarely been produced in a major venue. One notable exception occurred when Simon Callow made his West End debut in a version of \"Bürger Schippel\" (re-titled as \"The Plumber's Progress\") alongside Harry Secombe in the 1970s. However, in August 2011, both \"Paul Schippel Esq.\" (an alternative title often given to \"Bürger Schippel\") and \"The Fossil\", another of Sternheim's comedies, were performed as a double-bill at the Charing Cross Theatre, London, with Kieran E. Sims and Alex Corbet Burcher in the respective title roles.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20876254", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20876254", "title": "Centralcasting", "text": "Centralcasting\n\nIn terrestrial radio and television broadcasting, centralcasting refers to the use of systems automation by which customised signals for broadcast by multiple individual stations may be created at one central facility.\n\nCentralcasting is a form of broadcast automation which operates on the presumption that large quantities of content are similar and are handled in a consistent or repetitive manner across multiple stations in a broadcast station group. While each individual station has its own digital on-screen graphic logo, call sign and identity, much of the content on a typical affiliate station consists of a common television network or syndicated programming with a small number of local broadcast programming time blocks employed for television news and sports television coverage, public affairs programming or local television commercials.\n\nTraditionally, many operations at an individual broadcast station were handled manually by broadcast engineering technicians at the local station. Network feeds would arrive by satellite; these would contain time cues to indicate when the station could switch to a prerecorded local station break from a videotape recorder, a local station ID from a character generator or a local program such as a newscast. Syndicated programming would arrive separately, either recorded in advance from satellite for tape delay or transported on prerecorded media. Local advertisements would be stored on tape cartridges (\"carts\") which would need to be inserted in the correct timeslots manually. A station could not operate unattended, even if it were merely retransmitting a network television programme originated elsewhere.\n\nBroadcast automation relies on computers to store and retrieve video, largely eliminating the use of individual videotapes and allowing switching and retrieval of stored programming, advertising and titles to take place automatically. The server would operate from stored playlists, in which each programme, each commercial advertisement, each live or network feed and each station break had been configured in advance.\n\nIn some cases, broadcasters have operated groups of multiple stations at the regional or national level from one central facility, removing many tasks which were formerly done locally. These operations normally take one of two forms:\n\n\nMany traffic and operations tasks, such as acquiring programming, selling advertisements, scheduling and keeping records of what was broadcast and billing advertisers take place behind the scenes, yet are also suited to automation and central operation by regional broadcast station groups. If computers handle scheduling of individual broadcasts, advertisements and local identification, a computerised record of what has been broadcast can easily be extracted for use at a central location to bill advertisers for broadcast time. Central operation of non-broadcast business functions removes the need for these tasks to be carried out at each of the multiple local stations.\n\nFor some broadcasters, centralisation of broadcasting operations has reduced the number of people required to operate a station, with some saving in cost. This must be carefully balanced, however, against the cost of the extra communications links required from the local station to the hub; these often are optical fibre, microwave or (occasionally) satellite and can be costly if large amounts of digital video must be carried great distances.\n\nBy shifting many of the control tasks to a central hub, centralcasting may also reduce the investment which must be made in equipment for each individual local station in the group for upgrades such as digital television broadcasting as less equipment is required at each local station site.\n\nCentralcasting can also be used as a way to control a station's local operations remotely during off-hours (such as late night, where there may be no one or just a skeleton crew at the local site). This can allow a station to operate on an \"auto-pilot\" basis during off-hours in which it otherwise may have needed to sign-off.\n\nAn over-reliance on automation (and a reduction in the number of people at the local station) may leave an individual station less able to respond to local breaking news, such as tornadoes or other natural disasters which require local, live and immediate coverage. Individual local stations must also retain enough equipment to handle Emergency Alert System messages, routing them automatically to any remote locations being used to encode the final broadcast signals.\n\nThe use of large amounts of centrally assembled programming may also reduce local diversity, turning a station into little more than a semi-satellite of a main broadcaster in another city. In some cases, individual stations in a group will legally need to maintain nominal main studios in or near their respective communities of license but will originate little or nothing from these facilities once most broadcast-related tasks become centralised.\n\nBroadcast centralisation can create problems when one station in the group is sold (as the local master control functions which had been centralised must be restored before the local station is a viable stand-alone entity). There also needs to be some means to remain on-air locally if the link to the central hub is lost, lest a single point of failure take down all stations in the regional group.\n\nIndividual users of centralcasting facilities include:\n\nSome groups, such as Sinclair Broadcast Group, have attempted to centralise not only routine operational tasks but also the production of local news. The News Central format, which Sinclair abandoned in 2006, involved inserting small blocks of local content into an otherwise-national newscast, which would then be presented to local viewers as having been generated at the local station.\n\nThe resulting product contains largely the same content (and potentially the same journalistic biases) in each market in which it appears, raising objections from proponents of localism and opponents of concentration of media ownership.\n\nThe reduction in local broadcast-related jobs as tasks are moved to central locations has also drawn objections from trade unions.\n\n"}

Cheerleading is available at the junior high school, high school, collegiate, club, and all-star level. Teams can either be all female or coed featuring males and females.\n\nCompetition routines are held on a 12-meter square mat in which the entire surface can be used. Each team must perform a 2 minutes and 30 seconds routine in which 1 minute and 30 seconds of the routine may contain music. Routines showcase different elements including sideline cheers, pyramids and stunts, dance, and gymnastics. There is also a division for group stunt competition where a group of five participants perform a 60–65 seconds routine of strictly stunts. There is also a division for partner stunt competition that includes one male and one female and one spotter. These routines last around 55–60 seconds and can only incorporate stunting.\n\n\nOn July 13, 1988 the Foundation of Japan Cheerleading Association was founded with the purpose of supervising the cheerleading world as a competitive sport in Japan and to promote a healthy spread and promotion of the cheerleading competition. The Japan Cheerleading Association (JCA) also holds cheerleading and leadership workshops, holds domestic and international competitions, trains trainers, certifies competition equipment, and handles publications.\n\nThe International Federation of Cheerleading (IFC) is also based in Tokyo, Japan and is the world governing body of cheerleading.\n\nThe Asian Federation of Cheerleading (AFC) is the governing body of cheerleading in Asia and is one of the continental confederations that makes up the International Federation of Cheerleading.

Up to four players and bots in local multiplayer advance through randomly generated dungeons with one player as the hero and the others as spirits who possess traps and monsters in the environment to kill and thus replace the hero. The game received a Steam Early Access release for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux platforms in August 2014, and a full release for those three as well as PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in April 2017 and a release for Nintendo Switch on December 19, 2017.\n\n\"Crawl\" is a cross-genre game with roguelike, bullet hell, and brawler elements for up to four offline players and bots. The main player advances through randomly generated dungeons as a human hero while up to three other spirit players control the dungeon's enemies and traps to kill the main player. The spirit player who kills the human hero swaps roles to become the next main player. Players earn experience as they progress through the dungeon in both the human hero and the non-human spirit roles. Hero experience unlocks new attacks and spells, and spirit experience unlocks stronger enemies to possess. Each player's human hero experience level, weapon, and stats progress is preserved between turns. \"Crawl\" was designed to be more fast-paced and arcade-like than strategic, and includes genre-standard activities like collecting loot and upgradable weapons and magic items. Once player spirits possess \"monster spawners\" and traps in the active room, they cannot leave the form until they die or kill the main character. The players and enemies grow progressively more powerful over the course of a match. The game ends when a human hero reaches experience level 10, enters a portal, and defeats a final boss whose limbs are controlled cooperatively by the other players. Typical matches last about 30 minutes.\n\n\"Crawl\" was developed by Powerhoof, a two-person indie studio based in Melbourne. They described the game as their version of four-player \"Gauntlet\" combined with the Japanese bullet hell genre, or a combination of \"Super Bomberman\" and \"The Legend of Zelda\". The game was made on the Unity game engine, and the developers designed a pixelated version of Gabe Newell as an in-game boss.\n\nThe game was \"greenlit\" on Steam within twenty-four hours. There is no online multiplayer. The game was expected for release on Steam Early Access in July 2014, but was delayed due to an issue pertaining to Powerhoof's taxes and formation as a company. The game was released on Steam Early Access on August 6, 2014 for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux platforms. The full version released for computers, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on April 11, 2017. A Wii U console version was planned in 2014.\n\nCritics placed \"Crawl\" in a trend of local multiplayer functionality amongst indie games. Pete Davison of \"USgamer\" wrote that the game bridged multiple genres and was an example of the resurgence of couch co-op's fashionability. \"Rock, Paper, Shotgun\" Nathan Grayson compared the game's premise with \"Dungeonland\". \"Hardcore Gamer\" Marcus Estrada called the game's concept \"ingenious\" and praised its capacity as a party game. In reviewing a prerelease version, Estrada wrote that the game had issues with gameplay pacing, lackluster artificial intelligence, and opportunities for players to hold up the game.\n\nThe game sold over 10,000 copies in its first 12 days on sale on early access.\n\n\n"}

The ship's occupant dies shortly after the crash. The space-traveler's brain is saved and it is transplanted into cyborg body. His memory is erased so that he can be put to work. The memory wipe fails and the player, as the unwilling cyborg, must escape.\n\nWhen starting the game, players are prompted to select an arm, body, and legs for their cyborg character. Enemies are also a combination of these three types of cyborg parts, even having the secondary arm mixed. When players choose the \"two players game mode,\" players will be prompted to the customization room, and afterwards either go to the main adventure mode or the duel mode if they previously set it in the Options menu. The first player has a combination of metallic gray and yellow, while the second player has a combination of metallic green and purple.\n\nEnemies come in pairs, with first and second player colors respectively. Players have a wide variety of moves, which includes picking up and using objects and manipulating enemies, grabbing the enemy's arm and removing it,and swap it for the current arm, and if the enemy doesn't have a primary arm, then the next thing the player can grab is the body and tear the enemy in half, which can then be drained to replenish energy.\n\nAs the levels progress, the player is confronted with cyborg enemies sporting different modified bodies. If desired, the player can swap out parts from defeated enemies by kicking the wreckage and grasping downward at the displayed item. This is sometimes needed, such as in the first level where the player is faced with an enemy with high-jump legs and then has to jump across a wide chasm. Later on, battles with enemies become increasingly difficult. The more powerful weapons from defeated enemies prove essential in defeating the next wave of foes or end-level bosses.\n"}

Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, and directed by Lee Tamahori, marked the \"James Bond\" franchise's 40th anniversary. The series began in 1962 with Sean Connery starring as Bond in \"Dr. No\". \"Die Another Day\" includes references to each of the preceding films.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews. Some critics praised the work of Tamahori, while others criticised the film's heavy use of computer-generated imagery, which they found unconvincing and a distraction from the film's plot. Nevertheless, \"Die Another Day\" was the highest-grossing \"James Bond\" film up to that time if inflation is not taken into account.\n\nMI6 agent James Bond infiltrates a North Korean military base, where Colonel Tan-Sun Moon is illegally trading weapons for African conflict diamonds. After Moon's assistant Zao discovers that Bond is a British agent via an unknown source, Moon attempts to kill Bond and a hovercraft chase ensues, ending with Moon's apparent death. Bond survives, but is captured by North Korean soldiers and imprisoned by the Colonel's father, General Moon.\n\nAfter fourteen months of captivity and torture, Bond is traded for Zao in a prisoner exchange. He is sedated and taken to meet M, who informs him that his status as a 00 Agent is suspended under suspicion of having leaked information under duress. Bond is convinced that he has been set up by a double agent in the British government and decides to avenge his betrayal. After escaping from the custody of MI6, he discovers that he is in Hong Kong, where he learns from a Chinese agent that Zao is in Cuba.\n\nIn Havana, Bond meets NSA agent Giacinta 'Jinx' Johnson, with whom he is intimate. Later, Bond follows her to a gene therapy clinic, where patients can have their appearances altered through DNA restructuring. Bond locates Zao inside the clinic and attempts to kill him, but he escapes, leaving behind a pendant which leads Bond to a cache of diamonds, identified as conflict diamonds, but bearing the crest of the company owned by British billionaire businessman Gustav Graves. Bond learns that Graves only appeared a year prior, apparently discovering a vein of diamonds in Iceland leading to his current wealth, celebrity, and philanthropy from its assets.\n\nAt Blades Club in London Bond meets Graves, along with his assistant Miranda Frost, who is also an undercover MI6 agent. After a fencing exercise (and a literal sword-fight), Bond is invited by Graves to Iceland for a scientific demonstration. Shortly afterwards, M tells Bond of MI6's doubts about Graves, restores Bond's Double-0 status and offers assistance in the investigation.\n\nAt his ice palace adjacent to the diamond mine site in Iceland, Graves unveils a new orbital mirror satellite, \"Icarus\", which is able to focus solar energy on a small area and provide year-round sunshine for crop development. During the night, Jinx infiltrates Graves' command centre, but is captured by Graves and Zao. Bond rescues her and later discovers that Colonel Moon is still alive. Moon has used the gene therapy technology to change his appearance, creating the identity of Gustav Graves and amassing his fortune from sale of the conflict diamonds.\nBond confronts Graves, but Frost arrives to reveal herself as the traitor who betrayed Bond in North Korea, forcing Bond to escape from Graves' facility. Bond then returns in his Aston Martin Vanquish to rescue Jinx, who has been captured once again within the palace. As Graves uses Icarus to melt the ice palace, Zao pursues Bond into the palace using his Jaguar XKR. Bond kills Zao by causing a giant ice chandelier to fall onto him, and then revives Jinx after she has almost drowned.\n\nBond and Jinx pursue Graves and Frost to the Korean peninsula and stow away on Graves' cargo plane. Graves reveals his true identity to his father, and the true purpose of the Icarus satellite: to cut a path through the Korean Demilitarized Zone with concentrated sunlight, allowing North Korean troops to invade South Korea and reunite the peninsula by force. Horrified at the fact that it would result in a nuclear war with the United States, General Moon tries to turn the plan down, but he is murdered by his own son.\n\nBond attempts to shoot Graves, but he is prevented by one of the soldiers on board. In their struggle, a gunshot pierces the fuselage, causing the plane to descend rapidly. Bond engages Graves in a fist fight, and Jinx attempts to regain control of the plane. Frost attacks Jinx, forcing her to defend herself in a sword duel. After the plane passes through the Icarus beam and is further damaged, Jinx kills Frost. Graves attempts to escape by parachute, but Bond opens the parachute, causing Graves to be pulled out of the plane and into one of its engines, killing him and disabling the Icarus beam. Bond and Jinx then escape from the disintegrating plane in a helicopter from the cargo hold, carrying away Graves' stash of diamonds in the process. In the end, they are seen to have sex amidst the diamonds on a bed in a South Korean Buddhist temple located in a valley.\n\n\nPrincipal photography of \"Die Another Day\" began on 11 January 2002 at Pinewood studios. The film was shot primarily in the United Kingdom, Iceland, and Cádiz, Spain. Other locations included Pinewood Studios' 007 Stage and Maui, Hawaii, in December 2001.\nLaird Hamilton, Dave Kalama, and Darrick Doerner performed the pre-title surfing scene at the surf break known as Jaws in Peahi, Maui, while the shore shots were taken near Cádiz and Newquay, Cornwall. Scenes inside Graves' diamond mine were also filmed in Cornwall, at the Eden Project. The scenes involving the Cuban locations of Havana and the fictional Isla de Los Organos were filmed at La Caleta, Spain.\n\nThe scenes featuring Berry in a bikini were shot in Cádiz. The location was reportedly cold and windy, and footage has been released of Berry wrapped in thick towels between takes to avoid catching a chill. Berry was injured during filming when debris from a smoke grenade flew into her eye. The debris was removed in a 30-minute operation.\n\nGadgets and other props from every previous \"Bond\" film and stored in Eon Productions' archives appear in Q's warehouse in the London Underground. Examples include the jetpack in \"Thunderball\" and Rosa Klebb's poison-tipped shoe in \"From Russia with Love\". Q mentions that the watch he issues Bond is \"your 20th, I believe\", a reference to \"Die Another Day\" being the 20th Eon-produced Bond film. In London, the Reform Club was used to shoot several places in the film, including the lobby and gallery at the Blades Club, MI6 Headquarters, Buckingham Palace, Green Park, and Westminster. Svalbard, Norway, and Jökulsárlón, Iceland were used for the car chase on the ice with additional scenes filmed at Jostedalsbreen National Park, Norway and RAF Little Rissington, Gloucestershire; Manston Airport in Kent was used for the scenes involving the Antonov cargo plane scenes. The scene in which Bond surfs the wave created by Icarus when Graves was attempting to kill Bond was shot on the blue screen. The waves, along with all the glaciers in the scene are computer-generated.\n\nThe hangar interior of the \"US Air Base in South Korea\", shown crowded with Chinook helicopters, was filmed at RAF Odiham in Hampshire, UK, as were the helicopter interior shots during the Switchblade sequence. These latter scenes, though portrayed in the air, were actually filmed entirely on the ground with the sky background being added in post-production using blue screen techniques. Although the base is portrayed in the film as a US base, all the aircraft and personnel in the scene are British in real life. In the film, Switchblades (one-person gliders resembling fighter jets in shape) are flown by Bond and Jinx to stealthily enter North Korea. The Switchblade was based on a workable model called \"PHASST\" (Programmable High Altitude Single Soldier Transport). Kinetic Aerospace Inc.'s lead designer, Jack McCornack was impressed by director Lee Tamahori's way of conducting the Switchblade scene and commented, \"It's brief, but realistic. The good guys get in unobserved, thanks to a fast cruise, good glide performance, and minimal radar signature. It's a wonderful promotion for the PHASST.\"\n\nThe soundtrack was composed by David Arnold and released on Warner Bros. Records. He again made use of electronic rhythm elements in his score, and included two of the new themes created for \"The World Is Not Enough\". The first, originally used as Renard's theme, is heard during the mammoth \"Antonov\" cue on the recording, and is written for piano. The second new theme, used in the \"Christmas in Turkey\" track of \"The World Is Not Enough\", is reused in the \"Going Down Together\" track.\n\nThe title song for \"Die Another Day\" was co-written and co-produced by Mirwais Ahmadzai and performed by Madonna, who also had a cameo in the film as Verity, a fencing instructor. The concept of the title sequence is to represent Bond trying to survive 14 months of torture at the hands of the North Koreans. Critics' opinions of the song were sharply divided—it was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Original Song and the 2004 Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording, but also for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Original Song of 2002 (while Madonna herself won the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actress for her cameo). In a MORI poll for the Channel 4 programme \"James Bond's Greatest Hits\", the song was voted 9th out of 22, and also came in as an \"overwhelming number one\" favourite among those under the age of 24.\n\nMGM and Eon Productions granted Mattel the license to sell a line of Barbie dolls based around the franchise. Mattel announced that the Bond Barbies will be at her \"stylish best\", clad in evening dress and red shawl. Lindy Hemming created the dress, which is slashed to the thigh to reveal a telephone strapped to Barbie's leg. The doll was sold in a gift set, with Barbie's boyfriend Ken posing as Bond in a tuxedo designed by the Italian fashion house Brioni.\n\nRevlon also collaborated with the makers of \"Die Another Day\" to create a cosmetics line based around the character Jinx. The limited edition 007 Colour Collection was launched on 7 November 2002 to coincide with the film's release. The product names were loaded with puns and innuendo, with shades and textures ranging from the \"warm\" to \"cool and frosted\".\n\n\"Die Another Day\" had its world premiere on 18 November 2002 at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip were guests of honor, making it the second \"Bond\" film premiere to be attended by the Queen, the first one being \"You Only Live Twice\" in 1967. The Royal Albert Hall had a make-over for the screening and had been transformed into an ice palace. Proceeds from the première, about £500,000, were donated to the Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund of which the Queen is patron. On the first day, ticket sales reached £1.2 million. \"Die Another Day\" was the highest grossing James Bond film until the release of \"Casino Royale\". It earned $432 million worldwide, becoming the sixth highest-grossing film of 2002.\n\n\"Die Another Day\" was controversial in the Korean Peninsula. The North Korean government disliked the portrayal of their state as brutal and war-hungry. The South Koreans boycotted 145 theatres where it was released on 31 December 2002, as they were offended by the scene in which an American officer issues orders to the South Korean army in the defence of their homeland, and by a lovemaking scene near a statue of the Buddha. The Jogye Buddhist Order issued a statement that the film was \"disrespectful to our religion and does not reflect our values and ethics\". \"The Washington Post\" reported growing resentment in the nation towards the United States. An official of the South Korean Ministry of Culture and Tourism said that \"Die Another Day\" was \"the wrong film at the wrong time.\"\n\nThe amount of product placement in the film was a point of criticism, specifically from various news outlets such as the BBC, \"Time\" and Reuters who all used the pun \"Buy Another Day\". Reportedly 20 companies, paying $70 million, had their products featured in the film, a record at the time, although \"USA Today\" reported that number to be as high as $100 million. By choice, the number of companies involved in product placement was dropped to eight for the next Bond film \"Casino Royale\" in 2006.\n\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film received an approval rating of 58% based on 215 reviews, with an average rating of 6.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Its action may be bit too over-the-top for some, but \"Die Another Day\" is lavishly crafted and succeeds in evoking classic Bond themes from the franchise's earlier installments.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 56 out of 100 based on 43 critics, indicating \"mixed and average reviews\". Michael Dequina of \"Film Threat\" praised the film as the best of the series to star Pierce Brosnan and \"the most satisfying installment of the franchise in recent memory.\" Larry Carroll of CountingDown.com praised Lee Tamahori for having \"magnificently balanced the film so that it keeps true to the Bond legend, makes reference to the classic films that preceded it, but also injects a new zest to it all.\" \"Entertainment Weekly\" magazine also gave a positive reaction, saying that Tamahori, \"a true filmmaker\", has re-established the series' pop sensuality. Dana Stevens of \"The New York Times\" called the film the best of the \"James Bond\" series since \"The Spy Who Loved Me.\" Kyle Bell of Movie Freaks 365 stated in his review that the \"first half of \"Die Another Day\" is classic Bond\", but that \"Things start to go downhill when the ice palace gets introduced.\" The first 20 minutes of \"Die Another Day\" was regarded as \"much closer to the grimmer post-9/11 Bond played by Daniel Craig\" [Pierce Brosnan's successor as the actor portraying James Bond] and able to \"go toe-to-toe with the darkest moments in franchise history\".\n\nHowever, some reviewers felt the film relied too heavily on gadgets and special effects, with the plot being neglected. James Berardinelli of Reelviews.net said, \"This is a train wreck of an action film – a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed James Bond into the mindless \"XXX\" mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs.\" Of the action sequences, he said, \"\"Die Another Day\" is an exercise in loud explosions and excruciatingly bad special effects. The CGI work in this movie is an order of magnitude worse than anything I have seen in a major motion picture. Coupled with lousy production design, \"Die Another Day\" looks like it was done on the cheap. Gary Brown of the \"Houston Community Newspapers\" also described the weak point of the film as \"the seemingly non-stop action sequences and loud explosions that appear to take centre stage while the Bond character is almost relegated to second string.\" Roger Moore, who played Bond in earlier films, said: \"I thought it just went too far – and that’s from me, the first Bond in space! Invisible cars and dodgy CGI footage? Please!\"\n\n\"Die Another Day\" was novelised by the then-official James Bond writer, Raymond Benson, based on the screenplay by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade. An effort is made to depict some of the film's more outlandish elements with more believability, in the style of Fleming's original novels' use of cutting-edge technology. So for example, the non-bodywork elements of the Aston Martin with its 'cloaking' function – the glass windows and rubber tyres – are described as having retractable covers to achieve the invisibility effect. Fan reaction to it was above average. After its publication Benson retired as the official James Bond novelist and a new series featuring the secret agent's adventures as a teenager, by Charlie Higson, was launched in 2005. As the novelisation was published after Benson's final original 007 novel, \"The Man with the Red Tattoo\", it was the final literary work featuring Bond as originally conceived by Ian Fleming until the publication of \"Devil May Care\" by Sebastian Faulks in 2008 to mark the 100th anniversary of Fleming's birth.\n\n007 Legends released in 2012 features Daniel Craig's James Bond in a Die Another Day level.\n\nSpeculation arose in 2003 of a spin-off film concentrating on Jinx, which was scheduled for a November/December 2004 release. It was originally reported that MGM was keen to set up a film series that would be a \"winter olympics\" alternative to 'James Bond'. In the late 1990s, MGM had originally considered developing a spin-off film based on Michelle Yeoh's character, Wai Lin, in 1997's \"Tomorrow Never Dies\". However, despite much speculation of an imminent movie, on 26 October 2003, \"Variety\" reported that MGM had completely pulled the plug on this project, to the dismay of Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson of Eon Productions, who were reported to be \"clearly furious\" about the decision. MGM was keen to instead move on with the next film, \"Casino Royale\", which went on to feature several recycled ideas originally penned for the cancelled spin-off.\n\n"}

During a game of \"Scenes From a Hat,\" Drew pulled out the subject \"books least likely to be checked out at the library\" and friend Ryan Stiles acted as if he was picking a book and read the title \"Dirty Jokes and Beer.\"\n\nThe book is divided into three sections, which are referred to in the title. All of the chapters within the first two sections (save for \"101 Big-Dick Jokes\", which \"would be redundant\") are preceded by a dirty joke Carey has heard over the years.\n\nThe first section deals with Drew's views on various topics, such as being at airports (he writes that he likes to ride around in the carts to make people move out of his way) and the difference between Las Vegas and Atlantic City. (Carey writes that he prefers Las Vegas, as he sees Atlantic City as being filled with retired people shuffling around, playing nickel slot machines.) The section ends with \"101 Big Dick Jokes\".\n\nThis section of the book contains the autobiographical stories. Drew briefly discusses his upbringing and his time with the United States Marines, as well as his experiences working on his show. In this section, he also includes reviews about his show, both positive and negative, as well as some of the notes he received from network censors about the show's content.\n\nThis section contains five short stories that Drew wrote for the book. He describes these stories as being \"Drew in \"The Twilight Zone,\"\" where he takes some elements from his life and changes them into fictional stories where he is the main protagonist of the stories. These short stories are not preceded by dirty jokes. The very first story \"Mi Plea\" was a completely true story, except for the ending.

{"id": "1694448", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1694448", "title": "Erwin Piscator", "text": "Erwin Piscator\n\nErwin Friedrich Maximilian Piscator (17 December 1893 – 30 March 1966) was a German theatre director and producer and, along with Bertolt Brecht, the foremost exponent of epic theatre, a form that emphasizes the socio-political content of drama, rather than its emotional manipulation of the audience or the production's formal beauty.\n\nErwin Friedrich Max Piscator was born on 17 December 1893 in the small Prussian village of Greifenstein-Ulm, the son of Carl Piscator, a merchant, and his wife Antonia Laparose. His family was descended from Johannes Piscator, a Protestant theologian who produced an important translation of the Bible in 1600. The family moved to the university town Marburg in 1899 where Piscator attended the Gymnasium Philippinum. In the autumn of 1913, he attended a private Munich drama school and enrolled at University of Munich to study German, philosophy and art history. Piscator also took Arthur Kutscher's famous seminar in theatre history which Bertolt Brecht was also later to attend. He began his acting career in the autumn of 1914, in small unpaid roles at the Munich Court Theatre, under the directorship of Ernst von Possart. In 1896, Karl Lautenschläger had installed one of the world's first revolving stages in that theatre.\n\nDuring the First World War Piscator was drafted into the German army, serving in a frontline infantry unit as a Landsturm soldier from the spring of 1915 (and later as a signaller). The experience inspired a hatred of militarism and war that lasted for the rest of his life, as well as a few bitter poems, published in 1915 and 1916 in the left-wing Expressionist literary magazine \"Die Aktion\". In summer 1917, having participated in the battles at Ypres Salient and been in hospital once, he was assigned to a newly established army theatre unit. In November 1918, when the armistice was declared, Piscator gave a speech in Hasselt at the first meeting of a revolutionary Soldiers' Council (Soviet).\n\nIn collaboration with the writer Hans José Rehfisch, he formed a theatre company in Berlin at the Comedy-Theater on Alte Jacobsstrasse, following the Volksbühne (\"people's stage\") concept, where in 1922–1923 they staged works by Maxim Gorky, Romain Rolland and Leo Tolstoy. As stage director at the Volksbühne (1924–1927), and later as managing director at his own theatre (the Piscator-Bühne on Nollendorfplatz), Piscator produced social and political plays especially suited to his theories. His dramatic aims were utilitarian — to influence voters or clarify left-wing policies. He used mechanized sets, lectures, movies, and mechanical devices that appealed to his audiences. In 1926, his updated production of Friedrich Schiller's \"The Robbers\" at the distinguished Preußisches Staatstheater in Berlin provoked widespread controversy. Piscator cut the text heavily and reinterpreted it as a vehicle for his political beliefs. He presented the protagonist Karl Moor as a substantially self-absorbed insurgent. As Karl's foil, Piscator made the character of Spiegelberg, often presented as a sinister figure, the voice of the working-class revolution. Spiegelberg appeared as a Trotskyist intellectual, slightly reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin with his cane and bowler hat. As he died, the audience heard \"The Internationale\" sung. \n\nPiscator founded the influential (though short-lived) Piscator-Bühne in Berlin in 1927. In 1928 he produced a notable adaptation of the unfinished episodic comic Czech novel \"The Good Soldier Schweik\". The dramaturgical collective that produced this adaptation included Bertolt Brecht. Brecht later described it as a \"montage from the novel\". Leo Lania's play \"Konjunktur\" (Oil Boom) premiered in Berlin in 1928, directed by Erwin Piscator, with incidental music by Kurt Weill. Three oil companies fight over the rights to oil production in a primitive Balkan country, and in the process exploit the people and destroy the environment. Weill's songs from this play, like \"Die Muschel von Margate\" are still part of the modern repertoire of art music.\n\nIn 1929 Piscator published his own work on the theory of theatre, \"The Political Theatre\". In the preface to its 1963 edition, Piscator wrote that the book was \"assembled in hectic sessions during rehearsals for \"The Merchant of Berlin\"\" by Walter Mehring, which had opened on 6 September 1929 at the second Piscator-Bühne. It was intended to provide \"a definitive explanation and elucidation of the basic facts of epic, i.e. political theatre\", which at that time \"was still meeting with widespread rejection and misapprehension.\" Three decades later, Piscator felt that:\n\nIn 1931, after the collapse of the third Piscator-Bühne, Piscator went to Moscow in order to make the motion picture \"Revolt of the Fishermen\" with actor Aleksei Dikiy for Mezhrabpom, the Soviet film company associated with the International Workers' Relief Organisation. As John Willett put it, throughout the pre-Hitler years Piscator's \"commitment to the Russian Revolution was a decisive factor in all his work.\" With Hitler's rise to power in 1933, Piscator's stay in the Soviet Union became exile. In July 1936, Piscator left the Soviet Union for France. In 1937, he married dancer Maria Ley in Paris. Bertolt Brecht was one of the groomsmen.\n\nDuring his years in Berlin, Piscator had collaborated with Lena Goldschmidt on a stage adaptation of Theodore Dreiser's bestselling novel \"An American Tragedy\"; under the title \"The Case of Clyde Griffiths\" and with Lee Strasberg as director, it had run for 19 performances on Broadway in 1936. When Piscator and Ley subsequently migrated to the United States in 1939, Piscator was invited by Alvin Johnson, the founding president of The New School, to establish a theatre workshop. Among Piscator's students at this Dramatic Workshop in New York were Bea Arthur, Harry Belafonte, Marlon Brando, Tony Curtis, Ben Gazzara, Judith Malina, Walter Matthau, Rod Steiger, Elaine Stritch, Eli Wallach, Jack Creley and Tennessee Williams.\n\nPiscator returned to West Germany in 1951 due to McCarthy era political pressure. He was appointed manager and director of the Freie Volksbühne in West Berlin in 1962. To much international critical acclaim, in February 1963, Piscator premièred Rolf Hochhuth's \"The Deputy\", a play \"about Pope Pius XII and the allegedly neglected rescue of Italian Jews from Nazi gas chambers.\" Until his death in 1966, Piscator was a major exponent of contemporary and documentary theatre. Piscator's wife, Maria Ley, died in New York city in 1999.\n\nPiscator's contribution to theatre has been described by theatre historian Günther Rühle as \"the boldest advance made by the German stage\" during the 20th century. Piscator's theatre techniques of the 1920s — such as the extensive use of still and cinematic projections from 1925 on, as well as complex scaffold stages — had an extensive influence on European and American production methods. His dramaturgy of contrasts led to sharp political satirical effects and anticipated the commentary techniques of epic theatre.\n\nIn the Federal Republic of Germany, Piscator's interventionist theatre model experienced a late second zenith. Several productions trying to come to terms with the Germans' Nazi past and on other timely issues made Piscator the inspirer of a mnemonic and documentary theatre from 1962 on. Piscator's stage adaptation of Leo Tolstoy's novel \"War and Peace\" has been played in some 16 countries since 1955, including three productions in New York.\nIn 1980 a monumental sculpture by Scottish artist Eduardo Paolozzi was dedicated to Piscator in central London. In the fall of 1985, an Erwin Piscator Award was inaugurated that is annually being awarded in New York, the adopted city of Piscator's second wife Maria Ley. Additionally, a Piscator Prize of Honors has been annually awarded to generous patrons of art and culture in commemoration of Maria Ley since 1996. The host of the Erwin Piscator Award is the international non-profit organisation \"Elysium − between two continents\" that aims at fostering artistic and academic dialogue and exchange between the United States and Europe. In 2016, a Piscator monument has been raised in his birthplace Greifenstein-Ulm.\n\nPiscator's artistic remains are held by the archive of the Academy of Arts, Berlin (since 1966) and the Southern Illinois University Carbondale (Morris Library, since 1971).\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was played by the Brazilian actor and humorist . He became very popular among Brazilian kids in the 1980s, having his own TV show, discs, dolls and many licensed products.\n\nThe character's first appearance was in the morning children's television program \"Balão Mágico\" in 1983, as a supporting character to the children's musical group. However, the character became very popular, arriving to become one of the icons of Brazilian media during the 80s, mainly due to high sales of a plush toy based on the character. After the end of the original program in 1986, the character won a solo program in the same year, broadcast by Rede Bandeirantes until 1989, called \"TV Fofão\" (with a return between 1994–1996). The last appearance of the character on television was in 1998 by the channel .\n\nIn 1989 the character starred in a theatrical movie titled \"\". The character has also led to several other licensed products and sold numerous albums of children's songs during the 80s and 90s.\n\nAccording to Orival Pessini, Fofão was created at the request of TV Globo director José Bonifácio de Oliveira Sobrinho (a.k.a. Boni), who needed a child character for the program Balão Mágico, which would debut in a few months, and any character that was created would go on the air. Orival had never worked with children and had no idea what to create, imagined various possibilities, such as a dog, a pig, a clown, a teddy bear, an extraterrestrial or a human being, after thinking he decided to mix all the imagined alternatives, resulting in Fofão. Other inspiration that Orival had to create Fofão was Steven Spielberg's E.T, which according him \"was very ugly, with disgusting appearance and his head looked like as inverted foot, but he had a great heart and was very charismatic\", so decided to create a similar character.\n\nAt the end of the 1980s an urban legend about the plush toy of the character has become quite controversial. The legend claims that the doll had inside its body a knife, supposedly meant for evil rituals and killing children. The doll has even come to be compared to Chucky from \"Child's Play\" horror film series. In recent years the mystery was partially confirmed when it was revealed that the doll had a pointed hard plastic object as its spinal chord.\n\nIn 2016, Fofão was again popular on the internet, when a group of street performers titled “Carreta Furacão” became a popular meme in Brazil. The group features several amateur artists, dressed up as fictional characters of popular culture, like Popeye, Captain America, Mickey Mouse, Fofão himself, and a generic clown. Videos of the artists dancing and performing acrobatics on the streets were popular on YouTube and became a meme on the internet. Fofão was considered the most prominent character to be used by the artists like a leader; however, Orival Pessini made a protest against the group, prohibiting the use of his character in political affairs. Some changes were then made to the generic character from the group.\n\nOn October 14, 2016, Fofão creator Orival Pessini died of spleen cancer, aged 72.\n"}

Hero of Socialist Labour (1974) and People's Artist of the USSR (1949). \n\nIgor Ilyinsky was born on 24 July 1901 in Moscow. At age 16 he entered the Theatre Studio of Theodore Komisarjevsky and in half a year already debuted on the professional stage in Komissarjevsky Theatre. His first theatre role was that of the \"Old Man\" in Aristophanes' play \"Lysistrata\". In 1920, he joined the Vsevolod Meyerhold Theatre. The young actor's style was in correspondence with the principles of Meyerhold, and so Ilyinsky soon became the central actor of that theatre.\n\nIn the mid-1920s Ilyinsky started to appear in movies, where he also played vivid comic characters. In 1924, Yakov Protazanov featured him in his famous futuristic film \"Aelita\", which was followed by his role in Protazanov's comedy \"The Tailor from Torzhok\" (1925). In 1926, he appeared in three films.\n“I can act on the roof of a train carriage, on the radiator of a moving car, on back of a galloping horse, or while swimming in the sea”. \n\nIn 1938 he joined the Maly Theatre that had been his favourite one since school years. Afterwards Ilyinsky stayed in the Maly Theatre for almost fifty years and even staged several plays there himself. Ilyinsky would later write that it was Russian classic literature that had helped him overcome the crisis and feeling that he had been unable to create new characters, different from the previous ones. An outstandingly prolific period in the actor’s life was related to his work with the famous film director Grigori Aleksandrov. In 1938 Ilyinsky splendidly acted as Byvalov in the comedy Volga-Volga (for this role, he was awarded Stalin Prize in 1941). He deliberately avoided any comic traits in his character to create a common image of a red-tapist. \n\nThe starting point for him was the gracious and stirring character of Lyubov Orlova. He decided to create a totally contrasting character, which he succeeded in. That role brought Ilyinsky the State Prize. Stalin reportedly watched the film sixteen times. At Molotov's birthday party Stalin flung Ilyinsky a remark: “Ah, Byvalov! You are a bureaucrat and I am a bureaucrat. We shall understand each other”. The success of that movie determined the development of Soviet film comedy for the next several decades. However, after the film Ilyinsky almost stopped his film acting. In the mid-1950s Ilyinsky finally got a chance to act in a movie. It was a light comedy, \"A Crazy Day\". The character created by Ilyinsky was a repetition of what he had done 20 years earlier. He managed to play a truly starry film role only 18 years after Volga-Volga. It was the role of the bureaucrat Ogurtsov in the smash-hit comedy \"The Carnival Night\", directed by Eldar Ryazanov. \n\n\"“I was not going to feature the great Igor Ilyinsky in The Carnival Night - I felt timid, and understood that being a coryphaeus he would suppress me. When Pyriev offered him for the role of Ogurtsov, I just panicked: he was my idol from childhood, the famous actor of the Meyerhold Theatre! And me, directing my first film, on the other scale!”\" (Eldar Ryazanov)\n\nIn Maly Theatre at the same time Ilyinsky shifted to portrayals of deeply tragic characters, in particular, from Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Leo Tolstoy. In the late 1960s Ilyinsky went into stage directing. His first stage production was the stage version of Gustave Flaubert's popular novel \"Madame Bovary\". The last period of Ilyinsky’s career was marked by his portrayal of Leo Tolstoy in the play \"Turning Full Circle and of Firs\", and his performance in \"The Cherry Orchard\" by Anton Chekhov. As a very old person Igor Ilyinsky acted a lot on the radio – almost blind, he was accompanied to the studio. \n\nIgor Ilyinsky died on 13 January 1987, aged 85. His widow, actress Tatyana Yeremeyeva, died on 29 November 2012, aged 99.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1130242", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1130242", "title": "King levitation", "text": "King levitation\n\nThe King Rising levitation is a levitation illusion developed by and named after Corey King. Some consider it to be a variation of the Balducci levitation.\n\nThe performer is viewed from the side. The performer's legs may be covered (commonly with a jacket) at the beginning of the effect. At this point the performer may patter, saying something like, “You may have seen other magicians levitate behind a jacket...\". This is a reference to the Superman levitation. The obstruction (jacket, etc.) would then be removed. The performer's whole body is clearly visible. The performer suddenly appears to levitate a few inches above the ground. Both feet are clearly seen to be in the air. The levitation usually lasts just a few seconds. When both feet return to the ground, the performer's legs may again be momentarily obscured. The performer may again make a comparative reference to the Superman levitation. Immediately afterwards the effect is complete, and the performer (particularly the performer's clothing) and the area around the performer can be thoroughly examined.\n\nThe biggest advantage of this levitation effect is that it is (like the Balducci levitation) impromptu. It can be performed anytime, anywhere, as long as the performer is wearing pants and shoes. It is more believable than the Balducci levitation because both feet are clearly seen in the air. However, it does require a small set-up that must be done under some kind of cover (an obstruction or misdirection). It is also considerably more difficult to perform than the Balducci levitation.\n\nThe performer stands so as to be viewed from the side. Under cover, the performer removes his or her foot from the far shoe and positions it at a right angle to that shoe, with the heel of the foot placed against the side of the shoe. After the obstruction is removed, the front of the performer's body can be seen. From the spectator's perspective it is impossible to tell that the performer's foot is out, because it is hidden by the leg closest to the viewers. The performer's weight is shifted to the leg, and the empty shoe is pinched between the angled foot and the shoe closest to the audience. The performer stands on the tip of the foot. Again, the foot remains hidden behind the shoes, which are both physically in the air, creating the genuine levitation. To end the effect the process is simply reversed.\n\nThe key to this illusion is that the spectators assume that there is a foot inside of the shoe, which is only natural. When both shoes are seen above the ground, it is then assumed that both feet are above the ground, and the performer is levitating.\n\nNote that an obstruction is generally used to hide the performer's action of removing, and replacing the foot in its shoe. It is possible however to perform the effect without ever covering the legs, by using misdirection.\n\n"}

{"id": "20570407", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20570407", "title": "Megamind", "text": "Megamind\n\nMegamind is a 2010 American 3D computer-animated superhero comedy film directed by Tom McGrath, produced by DreamWorks Animation and distributed by Paramount Pictures. The film premiered on October 28, 2010, in Russia, while it was released in the United States in Digital 3D, IMAX 3D and 2D on November 5, 2010. It features the voices of Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, Jonah Hill, David Cross, and Brad Pitt.\n\nThe film tells the story of a super-intelligent alien supervillain, Megamind, who after a long-lasting battle one day actually destroys his foe, the much-loved superhero Metro Man. Having Metro City for himself, Megamind finds out that his villainy has no purpose and thus creates a new superhero to serve as his nemesis. His plan backfires, as he ends up creating instead a new super-villain. With Metro City spiraling out of control, Megamind attempts to set things right and discovers his newfound purpose—as a superhero.\n\n\"Megamind\" received generally positive reviews from critics, praising its strong visuals and the cast's performances, but criticizing its unoriginality. With a budget of $130 million, the film grossed over $321 million worldwide, becoming one of DreamWorks Animation's lowest-grossing CG animated films of the 2000s.\n\nA short film, titled \"\", was released on February 25, 2011, on the \"Megamind\" DVD and Blu-ray.\n\nEver since they arrived on Earth as infants, supervillain Megamind has fought superhero Metro Man for dominance of Metro City. In his latest plan, Megamind and his sidekick Minion kidnap reporter Roxanne Ritchi and hold her hostage in a copper-lined observatory. When Metro Man arrives to save her, he reveals he is weakened by copper, and Megamind obliterates him with a death ray. Megamind finally takes control of the city, but his celebration is short-lived as without Metro Man to challenge him, he finds his life has no meaning.\n\nWhile wandering the recently-opened Metro Man Museum, Megamind sees Roxanne nearby, and uses his holographic disguise watch to take the form of Bernard, the museum's curator, whom he had \"dehydrated\" into a small cube. He talks to Roxanne and becomes attracted to her, and is inspired by one of her statements to create a new superhero for him to fight. Megamind returns to his lair and creates a serum containing Metro Man's DNA which he plans to inject into a proper candidate with his Defuser Gun. However, Roxanne's arrival at his lair with her dimwitted cameraman Hal Stewart causes Megamind to inadvertently inject Hal with the serum. Megamind disguises himself as Hal's \"Space Dad\" and convinces him to become the superhero \"Titan\". Titan spends several days training with his Space Dad before issuing a challenge to fight Megamind.\n\nOn the day before the fight, Megamind gets into an argument with Minion about giving up villainy for Roxanne, while Titan tries and fails to woo her. Megamind, disguised as Bernard, takes Roxanne on a dinner date. Titan sees them, and as he had been infatuated with Roxanne, becomes upset and leaves. Shortly thereafter, Megamind's disguise fails, revealing his identity to Roxanne, who also storms off. The situation leaves him unable to find his invisible car, which is where he left the Defuser Gun he used to inject the serum into Hal.\n\nTitan does not arrive at the scheduled fight, and Megamind finds that he has used his abilities for criminal purposes. As \"Space Dad\" and \"Bernard\" Megamind successfully convinces Titan to fight him as Titan realizes Megamind has used him and \"taken\" Roxanne from him. Titan engages in a super-powered fight with Megamind and his mechs hit. However, when Titan wants to \"kill\" him instead of arrest him, Megamind lures Titan into a copper-lined trap, but he is unaffected and continues to fight. Megamind escapes from the battle and seeks out Roxanne, hoping she can help. She offers to take him to Metro Man's secret headquarters, where they are both surprised to find Metro Man alive. Metro Man faked his death and weakness to copper, as he had become tired of being a superhero and wanted to retire to become a music star. He declines to help, but offers Megamind the advice that a hero will always rise up to challenge evil.\n\nReturning to the city, Megamind does not believe he can become the hero the city needs, and allows himself to be locked up in prison. Titan kidnaps Roxanne and demands Megamind show himself or else. Megamind has a change of heart and pleads with the prison warden, apologizing for his past actions. The warden reveals himself to be Minion in disguise, accepting Megamind's apology, and frees him so they can fight Hal.\n\nAs Hal is about to kill Roxanne, Megamind appears and frees her. The two escape, but Hal traps Megamind under rubble when Metro Man suddenly arrives, and Hal flees. Roxanne discovers that \"Megamind\" is really an injured Minion in disguise, while \"Metro Man\" is Megamind. Hal, in his flight, recognizes Megamind's distinctive mispronunciations, and realizes he was duped. Hal flies back and fights Megamind, during which Megamind finds his invisible car. He grabs the Defuser Gun and is able to extract the Metro Man serum from Titan, restoring him to normal. Hal is arrested for his crimes. Now hailed as heroes, Megamind and Minion appear at the reopening of Metro Man's museum, now dedicated to Megamind instead, while Metro Man, in disguise within the crowd, silently congratulates his former rival.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene Minion is doing the laundry when a re-hydrated Bernard pops out of the washing machine.\n\n\nThe film was written by Alan J. Schoolcraft and Brent Simons. It was first titled \"Master Mind\", and then \"Oobermind\". It was suggested that Ben Stiller would be cast as Megamind, and later Robert Downey, Jr. but Will Ferrell was ultimately given the role, due to \"scheduling conflicts\" for Downey. Lara Breay and Denise Nolan Cascino were the film's producers, and Ben Stiller and Stuart Cornfeld were the executive producers. Justin Theroux and Guillermo del Toro worked as creative consultants on the film. Del Toro only came onboard three weeks before the end of production, but went on to have a more substantial role in subsequent DreamWorks Animation films. The opening of the film, where Megamind is falling to his apparent death, was del Toro's idea.\n\nMegamind: Music from the Motion Picture is a soundtrack to the film of the same name, composed by Hans Zimmer and Lorne Balfe, and released on November 2, 2010 by Lakeshore Records.\n\n\"Megamind\" premiered on October 28, 2010, in Russia, and was theatrically released in the United States on November 5, 2010. It was supposed to be released in Japan on March 12, 2011, but because of the earthquake and tsunami a day before, the Japanese release was cancelled.\n\n\"Megamind\" was promoted at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International, with Tom McGrath, Tina Fey, Jonah Hill, and Will Ferrell, who was dressed as Megamind.\n\n\"Megamind\" was released on both Blu-ray Disc and DVD on February 25, 2011, accompanied with an all-new short titled \"\". \"The Button of Doom\" also had its television premiere on Nick, which was aired on February 26, 2011. It was the seventh-best-selling DVD of 2011 with over 3 million units sold. The film made a total of $75 million in DVD and Blu-ray sales. \n\nThe film was released on Blu-ray 3D in March 2011 exclusively as a part of Samsung 3D Starter Kits, and on September 11, 2011, exclusively at Best Buy stores.\n\nIn July 2014, the film's distribution rights were purchased by DreamWorks Animation from Paramount Pictures and transferred to 20th Century Fox, the rights are now owned by Universal Pictures.\n\n\"Megamind\" opened to $12.5 million on opening day, and earned $46 million over the three-day weekend, taking the No. 1 spot and averaged $11,668 from around 7,300 screens at 3,944 theaters. The opening was a bit higher than \"How to Train Your Dragon\", which earned $43.7 million back in March 2010. It was the fifth-highest opening for an animated feature in 2010. In its second weekend, it repeated at No. 1 and dropped 37% to $29.1 million for a $7,374 average from 3,949 theaters, and bringing its 10-day cumulative total to $88.8 million. On its third weekend, it fell 45% to $16 million and finished second to \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1\", averaging $4,237 from 3,779 theaters. Over Thanksgiving weekend, it held well with just a 22% drop to $12.6 million and slid to third place behind \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1\" and \"Tangled\" (it earned $17,304,307 over the five-day Thanksgiving period). Following Thanksgiving, the film fell a sharp 61% in its fifth weekend to $4.9 million and finished in sixth place.\n\nThe film closed in theaters on February 24, 2011 (a day before it was released on DVD and Blu-ray), earning $148.4 million in North America, and $173.5 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $321.9 million. The final gross was on the low end for a DreamWorks Animation film, but was still a box office success since it beat its $130 million budget. It is the sixth-highest-grossing animated film from 2010 worldwide, behind \"Toy Story 3\" ($1.063 billion), \"Shrek Forever After\" ($753 million), \"Tangled\" ($591 million), \"Despicable Me\" ($543 million), and \"How to Train Your Dragon\" ($494 million), the highest-grossing film worldwide in both Ferrell and Fey's careers, as well as the fourth-highest-grossing superhero comedy film, behind \"Incredibles 2\", \"The Incredibles\" and \"Big Hero 6\".\n\nReview aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives a score of 72% based on 176 reviews and an average rating of 6.6 out of 10. The site's consensus states the film \"regurgitates plot points from earlier animated efforts, and isn't quite as funny as it should be, but a top-shelf voice cast and strong visuals help make \"Megamind\" a pleasant, if unspectacular, diversion.\" Another review aggregator, Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, calculated an average score of 63 based on 33 reviews. Audiences polled by Cinemascore gave \"Megamind\" a grade of \"A-\" on a scale from A+ to F-.\n\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" awarded the film three out of four stars, stating \"This set-up is bright and amusing, even if it does feel recycled from bits and pieces of such recent animated landmarks as \"The Incredibles\" with its superpowers and \"Despicable Me\" with its villain.\" Stephen Holden, of \"The New York Times\", positively wrote in his review, \"Visually \"Megamind\" is immaculately sleek and gracefully enhanced by 3-D.\" \"Entertainment Weekly\" reviewer Owen Gleiberman graded the film a B+ and wrote, \"...too goofy-surreal to pack a lot of emotional punch, but it's antically light on its feet, with 3-D images that have a lustrous, gizmo-mad sci-fi clarity.\" Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" commented, \"What this raucous 3D animated fun house lacks in originality (think bastard child of \"The Incredibles\" and \"Despicable Me\") it makes up for in visual and vocal wit.\" In a mixed review, Betsy Sharkey of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote, \"Just as Megamind struggles to find his center, at times, so does the film.\"\n\nThe main point of criticism was the unoriginality of the film. Michael Phillips of the \"Chicago Tribune\" wrote: \"You have seen all this before\", while Justin Chang of \"Variety\" said: \"Though enlivened by some moderately clever twists on the superhero-movie template, \"Megamind\" never shakes off a feeling of been-there-spoofed-that.\" Claudia Puig of USA Today even asked: \"Do we really need \"Megamind\" when \"Despicable Me\" is around?\".\n\nSeveral video game tie-ins published by THQ were released on November 2, 2010 to coincide with the film's release. An Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 version is titled \"Megamind: Ultimate Showdown\", while the Wii version is titled \"Megamind: Mega Team Unite\" and the PlayStation Portable and Nintendo DS versions are both titled \"Megamind: The Blue Defender\". All three versions of the game have been rated E10+ for fantasy violence by the ESRB.\n\nDreamWorks Animation and WildStorm produced a 32-page full-color comic book titled \"The Reign of Megamind\", which was released in July 2010 exclusively at the Comic-Con convention. Full version of the comic is also available on the \"Megamind\" website.\n\nApe Entertainment released under its Kizoic label five full colour comic books based on the film. A 52-page prequel titled \"MEGAMIND: Reign of Megamind\" was released in October 2010. It features two stories titled \"The Reign of Megamind\" and \"MINION 2.0\". The stories show Megamind and Minion's biggest failures in their attempt to defeat Metro Man. In 2010 and 2011 followed a mini series of four 32-page books. The comic book #1 features story titled \"Can I Have This Dance\", #2 features \"Bad Minion! Bad!\", #3 features \"Megamutt\" and #4 features \"A Sidekick's Sidekick\".\n\nIn April 2011, DreamWorks Animation's CEO, Jeffrey Katzenberg, commented that the studio did not have plans to produce future movie genre parodies like \"Shark Tale\", \"Monsters vs. Aliens\", and \"Megamind\", saying that these films \"all shared an approach and tone and idea of parody, and did not travel well internationally. We don't have anything like that coming on our schedule now.\"\n\n"}

The platform provides content from Walt Disney Studios, Universal Pictures, 20th Century Fox, Warner Bros. and Sony Pictures. The system utilizes an internal platform known as KeyChest, which synchronizes content licenses from digital distribution platforms linked to a central user account.\n\nMovies Anywhere was first launched on February 10, 2014 as Disney Movies Anywhere (DMA) with content from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, and \"Star Wars\"-branded films on iOS with iTunes Store integration; the service has since been extended to other platforms and storefronts, including Amazon Video, Google Play, Vudu, FandangoNow, and Microsoft Movies & TV. On October 12, 2017, DMA was relaunched as Movies Anywhere, with other studios joining Disney in offering their film titles through the platform.\n\nMovies Anywhere is a competitor to the UltraViolet platform that was deployed by other major film studios (though the latter is declining as most of those studios move to Movies Anywhere); Disney declined to back the platform, in favor of promoting KeyChest as an alternative.\n\nIn 2009, Disney unveiled a rights synchronization platform known as KeyChest, which would allow content purchases via digital distribution platforms to be queried and used to build a centralized library. The company explained that this system would allow \"persistent\" access to purchased content across multiple digital platforms, including television set-top boxes and mobiles..The platform was viewed as being a competitor to UltraViolet, a competing concept developed by DECE, a consortium containing all other major U.S. film studios but Disney.\n\nDisney Movies Anywhere originally launched on February 10, 2014, as an iOS app that allows users to link Disney films purchased on iTunes Store into a unified library with digital copies of Disney films purchased on physical media, so that they can be streamed or downloaded. The integration is achieved by linking a user's Apple ID with a Disney account. The app also allows users to browse through a catalog of Disney films available on iTunes Store, access supplemental content such as interviews and behind-the-scenes footage, and participate in the Disney Movie Rewards program. Walt Disney Studios CTO Jamie Voris explained that the app was designed to provide a \"rich, interactive experience\" around its content as an alternative to \"utilitarian\" online stores, and that Disney planned to seek additional retail partners for the service in the future.\n\nIn November 2014, support for Google Play Movies & TV and Vudu was added. In September 2015, support for Amazon Video and Microsoft Movies & TV was added, and DMA apps for Android TV and Roku were also released. In August 2016, Verizon Fios became the first television provider to integrate with DMA, allowing purchases through Fios On Demand to be synced into DMA libraries.\n\nIn September 2017, DMA ceased support for Microsoft Movies & TV, with future purchases no longer automatically accessible through the linked library however in August 2018 support for the service provider was officially restored under Movies Anywhere.\n\nOn October 10, 2017, it was reported that the DMA platform would expand to include content from non-Disney studios under the name Movies Anywhere, with 20th Century Fox, Sony Pictures, Universal Pictures, and Warner Bros. serving as initial partners, and Lionsgate and Paramount Pictures expressing interest. It would also include titles from Disney's Touchstone Pictures and Hollywood Pictures banners that were previously unavailable on DMA. The DMA platform was relaunched on October 12, 2017. \"The Verge\" felt that the new platform could be used to replace the commercially-unsuccessful UltraViolet platform (which Disney did not support).\n\nJust two months after launch, at the January 2018 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, GM Karin Gilford announced that consumers’ accounts have accumulated nearly 80 million movies.

It saw release in North American and PAL regions during 2011.\n\n\"Professor Layton and the Last Specter\" is a puzzle game presented in the style of an adventure game. The player controls the actions of a group of three protagonists as they move about a village called Misthallery: Professor Hershel Layton, his assistant Emmy Altava, and a young boy named Luke Triton. While in the village, the three of them are presented with several mysteries that are solved as the plot progresses. Misthallery is divided into several sections, although many require the plot to progress to a certain point before they can be accessed. In order to move about Misthallery, players tap a shoe-shaped icon on the bottom-right corner of the touch screen, and then the arrow representing the direction of the path they wish to take. While in Misthallery, the player is capable of tapping anywhere on the bottom screen of the Nintendo DS system to investigate objects and reveal bits of dialogue, hint coins, collectible items, or hidden puzzles. Likewise, if a non-player character is visible on the screen, they can be tapped to initiate a conversation.\n\nInitiating a conversation or investigating an object in the main game will often lead to the player being asked to solve a puzzle. If the plot progresses to a point at which a puzzle can no longer be accessed, it will be retrieved by a character named Keats the Cat for later solving. There are over 170 puzzles in the game, including brain teasers, sliding puzzles, logic puzzles, peg solitaire, and several other varieties. When a puzzle begins, the player is briefly presented with the puzzle's name, number, and value in \"Picarats\", the game's system of points as well as an estimation of the puzzle's difficulty. These points are not used during the main game, but if a player collects enough of these Picarats, they gain access to bonuses accessible from the main menu.\n\nAfter this first screen, players are taken the main puzzle solving interface, which provides instructions for the current puzzle on the top screen while allowing the player to interact directly with the touch screen in order to solve the puzzle. The player has an infinite amount of time to complete each puzzle, and they have access to an in-game memo pad function to aid them in solving each puzzle. If they do not wish to solve the puzzle at the time, they can hit the button labelled \"Quit\" in order to exit the interface without losing any Picarats. Additionally, all puzzles have three hints available that can be purchased with tokens called \"hint coins\". If a player needs more help, they can also purchase a fourth \"super hint\", a more detailed hint that costs two hint coins. However, there are a limited amount of hint coins, and the game recommends they be used wisely. The player starts with ten hint coins, but more can be obtained by thorough investigation of the village.\n\nIn order to solve a puzzle, the player must input an answer on the bottom screen. Sometimes, this will involve tapping a button labelled \"Input Answer\" and writing a word or number that solves the given puzzle. Other times, they might be asked to circle an answer or tap an area on the touch screen, and then hit \"Submit\". Still others are solved automatically once the player finds the solution by interacting with objects on the bottom screen. If the player has made a mistake in solving a puzzle, they can hit the button labelled \"Restart\" to reset the puzzle. Deducted Picarats and purchased hints are not reset if a puzzle is restarted. If the player submits an incorrect answer, they will be asked to repeat the puzzle, and a varying amount of Picarats will be deducted from the maximum possible for that puzzle. If the player submits a correct answer, they are rewarded with the amount of Picarats the puzzle is worth, and the plot will progress. After completing a puzzle, it can be played again at any time from the Puzzle Index, a section in the game's interface that lists the puzzles a player has completed. Occasionally, after completing a puzzle, the player will receive small items that can be used in minigames. Fulfilling certain criteria, such as clearing all levels in a minigame, unlock additional puzzles in the Bonuses section.\n\nPlayers are also capable of connecting to Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection in order to download additional puzzles in the \"Bonuses\" mode, which can be selected from the game's title screen. These puzzles to be are made available each week following the game's release. Hints for these puzzles could not be purchased with hint coins, but they were provided freely one week after the puzzle was made available, for 33 weeks. A 34th puzzle was produced but never issued. When a player connected to Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, all puzzles and hints would be downloaded. After May 20, 2014, it's no longer possible to download the additional content, as the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service was terminated on that date.\n\n\"Professor Layton and the Last Specter\" also features several small minigames that are playable in the main game, available by selecting them from the Professor's Suitcase located in the top-right corner of the bottom screen while moving about the town. In order to play these minigames, the plot must have progressed far enough to have unlocked each of them, and more difficult levels require the completion of puzzles in the main game.\n\nThe Toy Train minigame involves laying a railroad track across a complex game board. The toy train must pass through every train station and reach a defined end point, and in harder levels, it must be timed to avoid cars and other trains. The toy train requires fuel to move, limiting the amount of track that can be placed by a player unless more fuel is collected before a track ends.\n\nThe Fish minigame involves manipulating a fish to collect every coin in its tank. The fish moves in a straight diagonal line, and the player can alter this line by placing bubbles at certain marked points, reflecting it in a different direction. In the Japanese version of \"Last Specter\", the Fish minigame is instead based on trying to create words by feeding them to fish, who alter them in specific patterns.\n\nIn the Puppet Theater minigame, the player is tasked with finishing the script of an ongoing play so that it makes sense. If the player chooses a word that does not make sense in the context of the play, the play abruptly ends and the player is asked to try again; if all of the right words are chosen, the play is given an epilogue and an audience applauds.\n\nAfter progressing far enough into the story, the player can tap mice across Misthallery to earn \"mouse badges\" and gain access to another minigame, entitled Mouse Alley. Unlike the other minigames, this is accessed through a character in Misthallery and not through the Trunk. The goal of the minigame is to tap as many mice as possible within the time limit, while avoiding tapping Luke's mouse, Toppy, by mistake. This is the only real-time element in the game.\n\n\"Professor Layton and the Last Specter\" takes place three years before the events of \"Professor Layton and the Curious Village\" in a fictional English village known as Misthallery. In Misthallery, citizens have long spoken of legends of a specter who rose from the mist to defend the village whenever the Specter's Flute was played. Lately, a monster who is believed by the town's population to be this specter has been attacking the village during the middle of the night, destroying homes and buildings.\n\nMisthallery is a watery town in which traveling via gondola to move about the town's canals is commonplace. By these canals, the town is divided into five distinct regions: the Crossroads, the Market, the East District, Ely Street, and Highyard Hill. The Crossroads contain the library as well as the home of the mayor, Clark Triton. The town market is a shady place controlled by a mysterious entity known as the Black Raven, the East District contains an abandoned warehouse, and Ely Street as well as Highyard Hill are primarily residential areas. On the outskirts of Highyard Hill lies the manor owned by the former mayor's children, who live away from the rest of the village. The townspeople believe that the manor is home to a witch. The town is also rumored to contain the Golden Garden, hidden ruins of an ancient city.\n\nAs the story begins, a woman named Emmy Altava is hired to be Professor Layton's assistant at the fictional Gressenheller University. Upon her introduction to him, he reveals that he is currently heading towards a town named Misthallery. According to a letter allegedly sent by his close friend, Clark Triton, a specter is attacking the village at night. As the pair reach Clark's house, though, they find that the letter was sent not by Clark, but by his son, Luke, who has learned how to predict the specter's attacks and wished to enlist Layton's help in putting an end to them. Luke sneaks out of his house to join Layton and Emmy's investigation. After they finish exploring Misthallery for the day, they go to spend the night at a local hotel. As they look out from the window in their room, they hear the sound of a flute and see a large, shadowy figure emerge from the mist, which proceeds to forge a path of destruction through the town, including their hotel room, before vanishing without a trace.\n\nThe next day, Layton, Luke, and Emmy set off to find the town's black market in order to discover information about the Specter's Flute, an artifact which is said grant those who play it control over the specter. After winning the trust of the Black Raven, a group of children who run the market, Layton learns that the flute was auctioned to the now-deceased Evan Barde, once the richest man in Misthallery, soon before the specter started attacking the town. The three then head to Barde Manor to visit his daughter, Arianna, a girl who was once close friends with Luke, but is now suffering from a terminal illness and is believed by the townspeople to be a witch.\n\nArianna refuses to talk to anyone, however, so Layton and Luke continue to question the townspeople while Emmy goes to the Scotland Yard for information regarding Evan Barde's death. With the aid of Inspectors Chelmey and Grosky, she uncovers the records for the case before heading back to Misthallery to reunite with Layton and Luke. Inspector Grosky returns with her, hoping that his own influence will help convince the town's Chief of Police, Chief Jakes, to provide further information on the case. Regardless, Chief Jakes remains adamantly opposed to the investigation of Barde's death, and demands that Layton and company leave the town within 24 hours. Despite Jakes' threats, they visit Arianna to explain to her what has happened to the town and to her father. Arianna opens up to them, and proceeds to guide them to the nearby lake before playing the Specter's Flute, which causes a prehistoric aquatic creature named Loosha to rise from the lake.\n\nChief Jakes then appears at the lake, revealing that he had followed the Professor, and takes Arianna and Loosha into police custody, claiming them to be behind the specter attacks. In his absence, the trio manage to find the real \"specter\" at an abandoned factory within the town. As Arianna and Loosha are being formally accused in front of the townspeople, Layton appears and exposes the true identity of the specter: an excavation machine destroying the town in search of the \"Golden Garden\", ancient ruins believed to be beneath Misthallery. He goes on to describe Chief Jakes' scheme to become mayor of the town and his accomplice: a man disguised as Clark's butler, Doland Noble, named Jean Descole, a scientist looking for the Golden Garden who had held hostage Clark's wife along with his real butler. With Descole's plan revealed, he combines his machines into a giant mecha in a final attempt to level the town in search of the Golden Garden.\n\nWith the combined efforts of Layton, Luke, Emmy, Loosha, and the Black Ravens, the mecha is eventually defeated and Descole is forced to retreat. Despite Loosha having been fatally wounded during the fight, she proceeds to destroy the floodgates of the town's dam, drying the lake and revealing the entrance to the Golden Garden. As the group enter the garden, Loosha dies, and Arianna learns of Loosha's true intentions. Loosha knew that the clean environment of the garden would help Arianna recover from her disease, and fought the specter to ensure the garden would survive long enough to cure her. She fully recovers from her illness a year later, and the Golden Garden's discovery is then made public, marking the beginning of Layton's fame in the field of archaeology.\n\nAs Luke leaves the garden, he realizes he still has much to learn about the world, and asks to become Layton's apprentice. Layton obliges, and the game ends with Luke bidding farewell to the people of Misthallery before beginning his journeys with Layton. In a final scene, Jean Descole is seen on a cart, preparing his next plan.\n\n is a role-playing game developed in cooperation with Brownie Brown, included with \"Professor Layton and the Last Specter\". In \"London Life\", the player creates an avatar that can later be customized with clothing and accessories. With this avatar, players live in \"Little London\", a small city inspired by London. Within Little London, the player can create and decorate their own room and perform errands for the townspeople, who consist of many characters from all four games in the \"Professor Layton\" series at the time of its creation. The game also includes characters from the animated movie released later the same year, \"Professor Layton and the Eternal Diva\", such as singer Janice Quatlane as well as Melina and Oswald Whistler. By aiding the townspeople, players can gain items or furniture that can be used to access new areas of the city, as well as wealth and happiness. Players can also use Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection to upload their avatar to the Internet, to be downloaded by other players with whom they have traded friend codes. \"London Life\" is advertised to contain over 100 hours worth of gameplay. Players can also trade in-game items with others through the Nintendo DS's tag mode feature, in which the Nintendo DS system communicates wirelessly with other Nintendo DS systems running the same game while in sleep mode.\n\n\"Professor Layton's London Life\" would later be the basis of another Level-5 title, \"Fantasy Life\". \"London Life\" can only be played after completing the Japanese version of the main game \"Last Specter\", but is accessible from the beginning of the game in North American and Australian versions of the game. The European versions do not include \"London Life\", because the amount of time it would take to translate the game would otherwise have prevented the game from being released before the end of 2011.\n\nEvery puzzle in \"Last Specter\" was created by Akira Tago, a Japanese professor and author of the Atama no Taisō series of puzzle books, which has sold more than 12 million copies within Japan. The game was produced by Level-5 CEO Akihiro Hino, and designed around the concept of , detailing how Professor Layton met his apprentice, Luke.\n\nThe \"Professor Layton\" series was envisioned as a trilogy, to be completed with the release of the third game, \"Professor Layton and the Unwound Future\". In spite of this, Hino said that, during the development of \"Unwound Future\", Level-5 had received a lot of questions from gamers asking if it was \"really the end [of the series]\", which was all of the inspiration he needed to create a \"second season\" of the \"Professor Layton\" series. In March 2009, Akihiro Hino officially unveiled \"Professor Layton and the Last Specter\" in \"Famitsu\", stating that, with the second season, each game would take longer to develop than before, to dispel beliefs that \"Professor Layton\" had not significantly changed with each passing game. The second season of the series was also scheduled to have animated movies that take place between the games, starting with \"Professor Layton and the Eternal Diva\", which was announced alongside \"Last Specter\".\n\nIn Japan, the music featured within the game was released as a soundtrack: the . The ending theme, , sung by Yūko Andō, was omitted from the soundtrack, and was also replaced with an instrumental version of the song in international releases of the game. The game also reuses music from \"Diabolical Box\" and \"Unwound Future\".\n\nThe game's musical score has been met very positively. Square Enix Music Online rated the soundtrack an eight out of ten, stating that it \"goes a little step further compared to its ancestors\", and praised the quality of the orchestral renditions, calling them \"superior to Professor Layton and the [Unwound Future], which already had fantastic arrangements.\" RPGfan likewise praised the orchestral songs, and also spoke highly of the rest of the soundtrack, particularly \"The Last Specter's Theme\", stating that it was \"sure to win over most any video game music fan.\"\n\nThough the game was released within Japan during November 2009, the game did not appear at E3 2010 alongside \"Unwound Future\" and the Nintendo 3DS sequel to \"Last Specter\", \"Professor Layton and the Miracle Mask\", which were both announced at the event. The game would, for the next year, only be mentioned by Nintendo in passing during an interview involving the Nintendo DSi XL, where it was referred to as \"Professor Layton and the Specter's Flute\". At the end of May 2011, Level-5 filed a trademark in the United States for \"Professor Layton and the Last Specter\", and the game was officially unveiled internationally following E3 2011. The game was released in North American and PAL regions during late 2011.\n\nAfter the game's release in Japan during late 2009, \"Professor Layton and the Last Specter\" quickly rose to the top of Japanese sales charts, moving over 300,000 units during its first week, eventually totaling 659,504 sales in Japan as of December 20, 2010. When it saw international release during late 2011, it became the best-selling Nintendo DS game in North America on the week of its release – although across all platforms, it was outsold by \"\" and \"Just Dance 3\", among other titles. In the United Kingdom, it was the seventh-highest selling game on its week of release, and the third-highest on a single console following both the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of \".\" By the end of 2011, the game totaled 1.19 million sales within North America and Europe, where it has sold 1.25 million copies as of March 2012.\n\n\"Professor Layton and the Last Specter\" received \"favorable\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Many critics noted that although the game feels similar to past titles, the series had found a working formula and did not need to change. IGN shared these sentiments, but found that the game had \"an added attention to detail that makes the whole game feel a bit sharper and more magnificent\" than its predecessors. The game's puzzles received mixed reception. Reviewers often commented that they felt too similar to puzzles from the other games in the series, and several felt that they tended to be vague or inconsistent in difficulty. Despite this, \"GamePro\" felt that the game's puzzles were \"more balanced\" than those from previous games. The game's cutscenes and visuals were very well received, with GamesRadar describing the cutscenes as \"near-Ghibli quality\" and IGN saying that \"the graphics, which make use of a cartoony yet beautifully detailed, painterly art style, are simply gorgeous.\"\n\n\"Professor Layton's London Life\" was also viewed as a worthwhile extension to the game, with 1UP.com stating that the main game was \"almost a side diversion\" in comparison. Critics often compared the gameplay to the popular \"Animal Crossing\" franchise. Response to the game was mixed. IGN felt it \"surprising the game was included as a mere bonus\" and GamePro praised the dialogue, calling it \"clever and genuinely funny in ways that few other games are.\" However, Game Revolution said that the game soon \"becomes a chore\" to play, and some reviewers were unhappy with the decision to remove the game from European versions of \"Professor Layton and the Last Specter\".\n\n\"The Escapist\" gave \"Last Specter\" a score of four-and-a-half stars out of five, saying, \"Another Professor Layton game, another bit of puzzling brilliance. Some of the brain teasers feel a bit recycled - instead of foxes and chickens, you're shuttling dogs and cats across the river, for example - but there's more than enough variety to warrant doggedly tracking down every last one. But if you only solve the ones you need to move the story forward, that's ok, too.\" \"The Guardian\" gave it four stars out of five, saying, \"If you've not been a fan of the series, this isn't the game that's going to change your mind. For everybody else though, \"Professor Layton & The Spectre's Call\" is several days of commute-improving, grey cell stimulation in a mostly effective package. And bravo to Nintendo for keeping this franchise on the standard DS rather than – for the time being, at least – adding that third dimension.\" However, \"The Daily Telegraph\" gave it two-and-a-half stars out of five, saying, \"The Layton charm is undoubtedly still present, but it's not enough to carry the series by itself. Upon solving certain puzzles, Layton exclaims 'I love the thrill of a good solution'. So do we, Hershel, so do we. And in this Layton game, sadly, that thrill is all too rare.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8460326", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8460326", "title": "Salegy", "text": "Salegy\n\nSalegy is a popular music genre from Madagascar. Originating as a Sub-Saharan African folk music style in the northwestern coastal areas of Madagascar, modern salegy is the genre of Malagasy music that has gained the widest recognition and commercial popularity in the international market. Its sound is considered emblematic of the island. Eusèbe Jaojoby, a Sakalava singer from Antsiranana, was a key originator of the style and is widely considered the \"King of Salegy\". \n\nThe contemporary, electrified form of popular salegy originated from traditional acoustic roots in northwestern Madagascar around Mahajanga and Antsiranana in the 1950s. It has been popularized by originators like Jaojoby and relative newcomers such as Ninie Doniah, Vaiavy Chila and Dr. J.B. and the Jaguars. The style is funky and energetic, dominated by ringing electric guitars, real or synthesized accordion, and call-and-response polyphonic vocals, propelled by heavy electric bass and a driving percussion section typically including a drum kit, djembe and shakers. The syncopated, polyrhythmic beat of salegy is rapid (typically around 290BPM) and features a distinctive percussion pattern performed on a Western drum kit in or time with accents on the 3rd or 7th beat. The melody and harmonies are often in the A minor key and feature beautiful high-life electric guitar and synthesized accordion lines. The sound of salegy can be heard at night clubs, cabarets, parties and dance floors across the island.\n\nSalegy represents an electrified version of the \"antsa\" musical style that was traditionally performed at Betsimisaraka and Tsimihety rituals. In addition to their commonalities in tempo, vocal style, and tendency toward minor keys (which some attribute to an Arab influence, and which stands in contrast to the major key dominance of Highland music), the salegy shares the antsa's structure in that it always features a middle section called the \"folaka\" (\"broken\") which is primarily instrumental—voice serves only to urge on more energetic dancing—and during which the vocalists (and the audience) will launch into intricate polyrhythmic hand-clapping to the beat of the music.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2370017", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2370017", "title": "Self-working magic", "text": "Self-working magic\n\nSelf-working magic is magic that works simply from following a procedure that is known to the audience. It requires no secret set-up, trickery, sleight-of-hand, or other hidden objects or moves. Some self-working magic allows the audience to have a secret that they do not reveal to the magician until the end. The audience can be told every step, and can even repeat the trick. It can be done alone, since the \"magician\" may be just as surprised as anybody. All the magician has to do is follow a certain procedure, and everything will be good. Optical illusions and some other science demonstrations could fall into this category. The wonder comes from unexpectedness of a natural phenomenon. Basically, self-working magic relies on some expectation or lack of knowledge in the audience about what produces the outcome. Usually, self-working card tricks revolve around some mathematical principle, such as in the trick \"Magical 13\", where the spectator is asked to cut the deck 13 times, then split the deck into 13 piles. Upon revealing each pile, it is found that each pile contains only cards of the same value (i.e., one pile has all four fours, the other pile has all four twos, etc.). This is based on the principle that beforehand, the deck is set up with all the suits in order. No matter how many times you cut the deck, the same cards will always be 13 cards away from each other.\n\nSelf-working magic tricks can be baffling in a special way. The patter can take different forms that make them more entertaining. One variation of patter is to say that you are hiding nothing, and explaining every step of the trick. Some audience members may still think it is a trick. Another variation, possibly with some tricks, is to say, \"I will not be doing the magic, here: you will\". Another way of doing it is to make a story that explains—gives a reason to—each step, so that no step is hidden, and the audience can even DO the steps, but the audience members are baffled, anyway.\n\nStory: Make a story of cutting the deck 7 times. 7 drunken sailors decide to play a high-stakes poker game with a new deck of cards. (Use a new deck that is ordered correctly for this game, all cards in order in every suit, not backwards order as some decks have, or have the audience put the cards in order to simulate a new deck). Then say, none of them are in a state of mind to shuffle, so they decide to cut the deck 7 times, one time each. The dealer deals but forgets his own 2nd and 4th cards, so he ends up with 3 cards. He asks for 2 more, but the other sailors refuse, arguing, but none of them want to start the round over. They finally agree to let him get 5 new cards. They make their bets, and each sailor bets high, giving up everything he owns. The dealer bets last, and accepts all the bets. Everybody is all in. Finally, they reveal their cards, the dealer revealing last. Every drunken sailor has a full house. But the dealer rarely loses the hand, having usually a straight flush, and sometimes a royal straight flush. Every step of the trick has been told directly to the audience, but they are still amazed.\n\nNo magic, here. Say, \"No magic, here. You will tell me which cards you picked.\" Ask the audience to pick 3 cards, not show them to you, and write them down. Make a pile of 10 cards, a pile of 15, another pile of 15, and a pile of 9, in order (no Jokers in the deck). Ask the audience to place the first card face down on the first deck. Then, take any number of cards from the 2nd deck and place them on the 1st. Put the 2nd card on top of the 2nd deck, and put any number of cards from the 3rd deck onto the 2nd deck. Put the 3rd card on top of the 3rd deck. Now, you put the 4th pile on the 3rd, both on the 2nd, and all 3 on the 1st. You have one deck. Take 4 cards from the top and put them on the bottom. You can tell the audience every step you are doing. Now, you can get 0 points to 3 points. I will go thru the deck, and you grab your cards if you see them. If you grab all 3 by the end, you get 3 points, if you grab 1, you get one point, and so on.\n\nNow, put the 1st card face up, the 2nd face down. They will find no cards. Say that is OK, we will keep going. Pick up the face-down deck and keep going. Do it again, and again. They will never see their card. Stop when only 3 cards are left. And say, gee—only 3 cards left. Turn them over, and there are their 3 cards. It works every single time. Sometimes, you can arrange it so that they do not know that they had to memorize the cards after writing them down. They may pick the wrong cards. Show them that they picked the wrong cards by looking at their paper. They will think the trick is over. Then, reveal the correct 3 cards.\n\n1. Steps of math operations that use some secret knowledge of the audience like their birthday, and then reveal that secret knowledge in an unexpected way at the end. For example, think of any secret 3-digit number, multiply it by one specific number, and then another, and it always comes out a 6-digit number with the original 3\n-digit number repeated twice.\n\n2. Another one asks the audience to think of words that start with certain letters, and then words linked to the last letters of those words, asking the audience to reveal only their last choices, but somehow almost always ends with the words \"Grey elephant in Denmark\" even though the audience thought up their own words throughout the steps.\n\n3. Another one ends up with the audience getting all the same number, but it is the WRONG number! Like an optical illusion, people are susceptible to adding up this particular sequence the wrong way almost every time.\n"}
{"id": "21287503", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21287503", "title": "Sharks in captivity", "text": "Sharks in captivity\n\nSeveral species of sharks are kept in captivity in public aquaria. In home aquaria, size constraints mean that only the smallest sharks are typically viable as pets.\n\nUntil recently only a few benthic species of shark, such as hornsharks, leopard sharks, catsharks, and zebra sharks, had survived in aquarium conditions for up to a year or more. This gave rise to the belief that sharks, as well as being difficult to capture and transport, were difficult to care for. A better knowledge of sharks has led to more species (including the large pelagic sharks) being able to be kept for far longer. At the same time, transportation techniques have improved and long distance movement of sharks is becoming easier. Several attempts to keep a Great White Shark in captivity have been attempted, but most specimens died or had to be released after a short time. One example, placed in the Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium in Japan, only survived for three days. The longest a Great White was held in captivity was at the Monterey Bay Aquarium, in September 2004. A young female was kept in an outdoor tank for 198 days before releasing her back into the wild. In the following years, the Monterey Bay Aquarium hosted five more juvenile white sharks for temporary stays before ending their program in 2011. \n\nWhen introduced to their new habitat some mature sharks has refused food despite the abundance and variety of feeding methods used. Over a period of years this results in sharks dying of starvation amidst plenty. \nSharks are usually seen to live a solitary existence, rarely moving about in group events, although, a tank could house up to four or five species during the same time period. \nIt has been commonly seen that Lemon and Nurse sharks occupy the bottom of the tank floor. Occasionally, they will take a swim no more than two or three feet off the bottom. Bull sharks, Sandbar sharks, and Sand tiger sharks continuously swim at mid-depth. Larger tiger sharks inhabit the upper region of the tank where their dorsal fin is breaking the surface frequently. \nSwimming patterns seen from sharks in captivity are that of Blacktip, Bull, and Lemon sharks being active 24 hours and those of Sandbars, Nurse and Sand tigers being active at certain times of the day/night. However, within some aquaria’s this could be attributed to the different feeding times of these species. \nSharks in captivity, referring to that of Sandbar, Sand tiger, and Nurse sharks are predicted to be less aggressive being that no aggressive biting is seen after feeding. The foremost behavior observed from those in captivity was curiosity, reasoning's being due to less competition for food and lack of stimulation.\n\nMost species of shark are not suitable for domestic aquaria and not every species of shark sold by pet stores make good inhabitants for personal aquaria. Some species of sharks can also be kept well in home saltwater aquaria. Uninformed or unscrupulous dealers sometimes sell juvenile sharks like the nurse shark, which upon reaching adulthood will have far outgrown typical home aquaria. Public aquaria are generally not interested in accepting donated specimens that have overgrown their housing and some shark owners have been tempted to release them into the wild.\n\nHowever, some species of shark can make prized additions to home aquaria. Species appropriate to home aquaria represent considerable spatial and financial investments as they generally approach adult lengths of 3 feet and can live up to 25 years. Sharks must be housed in aquaria at or exceeding 180 gallons in volume, with more active species requiring more space. Surface area is an even more significant consideration for aquarists than volume as it is the determining factor for the amount of oxygen that ends up being dissolved in the water, and therefore critical to the sharks' respiration. Choice of aquarium substrate is also important because a sharp, rough bed can irritate a shark's soft underbelly, or in severe cases lead to fatal infections. Shark aquaria are generally advised to be decorated \"conservatively\" in order to leave space for the animal to move more freely during daily activities. A cave, however, is often an appropriate addition for some shy species.\n\nSharks are very frequently overfed by amateur aquarists, which can lead to obesity or unnaturally fast growth rates. Captive sharks are healthiest when fed at levels similar to their food intake in the wild. Usually this amounts to 1-3% of their body weight weekly. However, aquarium conditions and species disposition are considered by conscientious aquarists when feeding captive sharks. Relatively sedentary species, such as wobbegongs can live on feedings occurring once or twice weekly. More active species may require to be fed three or four times per week to maintain satisfactory health. Sharks living in cooler water temperatures have slower metabolisms than sharks in warmer water housings and therefore require less food.\n\nThe most common staple food provided to captive sharks in home aquaria is frozen fish. The freezing process used to store foods for sharks often results in the food items losing nutrient value. Lost nutrients are replaced by vitamin supplements, which are marketed commercially, sometimes by companies generally associated with more typical pet foods (such as Purina Mills). Uncorrected nutrient deficiencies inherent in the frozen food diet can cause considerable detriment to the health of captive specimens. Conditions such as popeye, ascites, and anemia are known to occur in captive sharks that are deficient in some essential vitamin. Vitamin B deficiency results in a treatable condition where the shark's back arches and it swims in a circular motion.\n\nFeeding sharks frozen non-marine fish can result in deficiencies of omega-3 fatty acids, which can result in \"fat infiltration of the liver,\" which can impede the organ's function seriously enough for major health issues.\n\nSometimes sharks are unwittingly put in harm's way when aquarists include potentially dangerous tankmates in the same aquarium. Hobbyists generally don't think of other fish being a threat to sharks, but triggerfish, angel fish, puffers, and wrasses can all injure them. A large grouper is capable of consuming smaller sharks. Sometimes docile bottom feeding sharks are put at risk because of the fish that feed on the ocean bottom, sedentary sharks are simply an extension of the substrate.\" Another problem aquarists keeping sharks with other types of fish have encountered is that the smaller, more passive aquarium-friendly shark species often have difficulty competing with their tankmates for the food provided by the aquarist. Sharks are predatory themselves and may maul or consume tankmates smaller or weaker than themselves.\n\n"}

The camp kicked off in Büren, Nuremberg and Werbellinsee. During the Easter holidays of 2010, Star Camp headed towards Helmarshausen in Bad Karlshafen, Hesse. The Star Camp takes place every year.\n\nSince 2013 Robin Redelfs is the owner.\n\nStar Camp offers professional coaching in areas such as singing, dancing and interview training. It was initiated by German singing sensation LaFee, who stated it was always her dream to create a camp for young, talented individuals, since she would have enjoyed such a camp greatly while beginning her career and pursuing her musical ambitions. Co-founders include young entrepreneur and former major label recording artist, Matthew Mockridge. To create an equal opportunity for everyone interested in Star Camp LaFee and her team partnered with leading media companies to give out scholarships to very talented contestants. Among others, Scholarships were provided by newspaper magazine \"Bild\" and television station VIVA. Star Camp currently costs €399 per camper for 1 week. This includes room, board, classes and souvenirs. The age restriction is 10 to 20 years. The Star Camp experience includes daily coaching sessions with professional artists and other representatives of the entertainment industry. Other camp activities such as swimming, movie-night, camp-fire and sports are also part of Star Camp.\n\nIn 2013 Robin Redelfs took over the company. Ever since the camps take place under his direction.\n\n\nIn its first year, Star Camp was taken out in 3 cities. The camp took place in Büren, Nuremberg and Werbellinsee. A total of 5 scholarships was given out, the final show was filmed by RTL and some major label executives were invited to the show. The ensemble song was \"Lean On Me\" for all three camps. Marc Jentzen from \"Deutschland sucht den Superstar\" was a guest coach for the three camps.\n\nThe only camp held in 2010 was during the Easter holidays and was called \"Easter Special\". All campers, headed by 5 specially selected lead singers and guest stars, recorded the promotional song \"For Once and For All\", the official Camp-Song for 2010. The ensemble song 2010 was \"Fame\".\n\nStar Camp has announced to take a break in 2010 and will come back to Germany in the summer of 2011.\n\nIn 2013 Robin Redelfs took over the company. Ever since the camps take place under his direction.\nThe Star Camp 2013 took place in Willingen, Germany. \n\nFeedback was generally positive, with campers calling it the time of their lives and stating the organization should keep the same coaches. Online magazine Media Monitor reconfirmed that the participants are given the chance to feel like real \"stars in the making\", compared to contestants of the \"Idol series\" or \"Popstars\", but questioned if they really know that the camp is not intended to make stars. \"It's just about the process and not the result\", as stated by Star Camp creator Matthew Mockridge.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "854662", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=854662", "title": "Tankōbon", "text": "Tankōbon\n\nThe largest imprint labels for manga tankōbon publications include Jump Comics (for manga originally serialized in \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\" and other \"Jump\" magazines), Shōnen Sunday Comics, and Shōnen Magazine Comics.\n\nTypically, Japanese comics are first published in thick, phone-book-sized weekly or monthly anthology manga magazines (such as \"Afternoon\", \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\", or \"Hana to Yume\"). These anthologies often have hundreds of pages and dozens of individual series by multiple authors. They are printed on very cheap newsprint and are considered disposable. A \"tankōbon\" collects multiple installments from a single series and reprints them in a roughly paperback-sized volume on higher quality paper than in the original magazine printing. However, any colored images from the magazine publication are typically grayscaled.\n\nIn English, while a \"tankōbon\" translation is usually marketed as a \"graphic novel\" or \"trade paperback\", the transliterated terms \"tankoubon\" and \"tankōbon\" are sometimes used amongst online communities. Japanese people frequently refer to manga \"tankōbon\" by the English loanword , although it is more widespread for being used in place of the word \"manga\", as they are the same thing. The term also refers to the format itself—a comic collection in a trade paperback sized (roughly 13 × 18 cm, or 5\" × 7\") book (as opposed to the larger 18 × 25 cm / 7\" × 10\" format used by traditional American graphic novels). Although Japanese manga tankobon may be in various sizes, the most common are Japanese B6 (12.8 × 18.2 cm, 5.04\" × 7.17\") and ISO A5 (14.8 × 21.0 cm, 5.83\" × 8.2\"). The \"tankōbon\" format has made inroads in the American comics market, with several major publishers opting to release some of their titles in this smaller format, which is sometimes also called \"digest format\" or \"digest size\". In the United States, many manga are released in the so-called \"Tokyopop trim\" or \"Tokyopop size\" (approximately 5\" × 7.5\").\n\nAn aizōban () is a collector's edition volume . These volumes are generally more expensive and lavished with special features such as special covers created specifically for the edition, special paper used for the cover, higher quality paper, a special slipcase, and so on. \"Aizōban\" are generally printed in a limited run, thereby increasing the value and collectability of those few copies made. The \"aizōban\" format has begun to make inroads into the US market, with titles such as \"Fruits Basket\", \"Rurouni Kenshin\" and \"Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin\" being reissued in \"aizōban\" format. Generally only the most popular manga are released in this format.\n\nA bunkoban () edition refers to a \"tankōbon\" printed in \"bunko\" format, or a typical Japanese novel-sized volume. \"Bunkoban\" are generally A6 size (105 × 148 mm) and thicker than \"tankōbon\" and, in the case of manga, usually have a new cover designed specifically for the release. In the case of manga, a \"bunkoban\" tends to contain considerably more pages than a \"tankōbon\" and usually a republication of \"tankōbon\" of the same title which may or may not have been out of print. Thus, the \"bunko\" edition of a given manga will consist of fewer volumes. For example, \"Please Save My Earth\" was published in 21 \"tankōbon\" volumes, and then re-released in 12 \"bunko\" volumes. If the original manga was a \"wide-ban\" release, the \"bunkoban\" release will generally have the same number of volumes. The term is commonly abbreviated in Japanese to just \"bunko\" (without the \"-ban\").\n\nThe kanzenban () is another term sometimes used to denote this kind of a special release. A \"kanzenban\" release is generally A5 size (148 × 210 mm) and will typically reproduce individual chapter covers, color pages, and side-stories from its original magazine run, features that are often omitted or converted to grayscale in standard \"tankōbon\" releases. While the \"aizōban\" appellation emphasizes the value of the volumes, the term \"kanzenban\" emphasizes their completeness, though it is likewise generally reserved for popular manga such as \"Dragon Ball\".\n\nSimilar to a \"wide-ban\", a is a new edition released with (usually) a new cover. The volumes in such a release usually have new color pages and other extras. For example, in 2002, \"Sailor Moon\" was reedited; some pages were completely redrawn and most dialogues were rewritten by the author. Plus, the chapters were redivided to fit into 12 volumes instead of 18.\n\nThe sōshūhen () is a relatively new format published by Shueisha beginning in 2008. A \"sōshūhen\" edition is B5 size (176 × 250 mm), larger than a \"kanzenban\", and similarly reproduces chapter covers and color pages while also including a variety of bonus features such as posters and interviews. The majority of \"sōshūhen\" releases are for popular manga with ongoing serializations. They also contain far more pages than a standard \"tankōbon\" and thus feature more chapters in fewer volumes; \"Naruto\" Part I was originally published in 27 \"tankōbon\" volumes, but was completed in just eight \"sōshūhen\" volumes.\n\nA wide-ban or waidoban () edition is larger (A5 size) than a regular \"tankōbon\". Many manga, particularly seinen and josei manga, are published in \"wide-ban\" editions after magazine serialization, and are never released in the \"tankōbon\" format that is common in shōnen manga and shōjo manga. When a series originally published in \"tankōbon\" format is re-released in \"wide-ban\" format, each volume will contain more pages than in the original edition, and therefore the series will consist of fewer volumes. For example, \"Maison Ikkoku\" was originally released in 15 \"tankōbon\" volumes, but was republished as 10 \"wide-ban\" volumes.\n\n"}

A Wikipedian in residence generally helps to coordinate Wikipedia-related outreach events between the GLAM and the general public.\n\nInstitutions that have hosted a Wikipedian in residence include large institutions like the National Library of Wales, British Museum, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the British Library, the University of Toronto, the National Library of Norway, and the Federal Archives of Switzerland and smaller venues like the Derby Museum and Art Gallery and The New Art Gallery Walsall in the UK; the Palace of Versailles in France; the Museu Picasso in Spain; and in the US, the Smithsonian Institution, the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library, and the National Archives and Records Administration.\n\nIn 2010, Australian Liam Wyatt became the first Wikipedian in residence when he volunteered at the British Museum for a period of five weeks. He noted the need for Wikipedia to strengthen partnerships with museums to create the most up-to-date and accurate information, saying \"we are doing the same thing for the same reason, for the same people, in the same medium. Let's do it together.\" The Children's Museum of Indianapolis became involved with the program after Wikipedian Lori Phillips volunteered for a GLAM event in 2010, becoming the second Wikipedian in residence. The third, Benoît Evellin, spent six months at the Palace of Versailles. The Museu Picasso in Barcelona, Spain, and the Derby Museum and Art Gallery in the United Kingdom were also early adopters of the idea.\n\nIn 2010, the Smithsonian Institution expressed interest in the idea, which led to the hiring of Sarah Stierch in July as Wikipedian in Residence. The following year, the National Archives and Records Administration followed suit and hired Dominic McDevitt-Parks, a student from Simmons College, who was pursuing a master's degree in history and archives management, to work at its Archives II location. McDevitt-Parks had been editing Wikipedia since 2004 and was hired for this position by David Ferriero.\n\nIn July 2011 Wikimedia UK engaged Andy Mabbett, an editor since 2003, as an \"Outreach Ambassador\" in-residence at the Bristol-based wildlife charity Wildscreen, working on the . Since then Mabbett has been a Wikipedian in residence at other organisations such as the New Art Gallery Walsall.\n\nIn January 2013, the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library became the first Presidential library to hire a Wikipedian in residence, when they hired Michael Barera, a master's student at the University of Michigan.\n\nIn September 2013, the National Archives and Records Administration became the first organisation to employ a permanent full-time Wikipedian in residence when it hired Dominic McDevitt-Parks to join its Office of Innovation in that capacity.\nIn March 2014, Harvard University posted a job listing seeking applicants to be their Wikipedian in residence at the Houghton Library.\n\nIn October 2014, the University of Victoria Libraries announced that in collaboration with The Electronic Textual Cultures Lab (ETCL) and the Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences that had been named Honorary Resident Wikipedian-in-Residence for the 2014/2015 academic year.\n\nBy 2016, more than 100 Wikipedians had taken part in the role, most of whom were paid by either the institution where they work or a Wikimedia-related organization.\n\nThe primary role of the Wikipedian-in-Residence is to serve as a liaison between the host institution and the Wikimedia community by assisting with events and training that support the missions of both organisations. Typical duties include arranging and/or leading training events and editathons; providing explanations to other staff and members of the public about policies and practice, such as policies about conflict-of-interest; as well as making contributions to articles relevant to the institution's materials and mission, such as articles about significant cultural objects in an organisation's collection.\n\nWhile Wikipedia discourages direct paid compensation for article editing and prohibits undisclosed advocacy, Wikipedians in residence are , either by offering credit, stipend or salary, through their sponsoring institutions they adhere to strict guidelines against engaging in public relations or marketing for their institution.\n\nOne such advertised post has been reported positively by others as being a \"unique opportunity to help enrich Wikipedia and its sister projects and share with the world... resources and knowledge.\" Conversely, journalist Andrew Orlowski criticized another advertised post as a waste of government funds. In 2013, a part-time temporary position was advertised by National Library of Scotland and was noted as being \"the first large-scale partnership\" between a Scottish institution and Wikimedia UK. This initiative was followed by University of Edinburgh where a Wikimedian in residence was appointed in December 2015.\n\n"}
