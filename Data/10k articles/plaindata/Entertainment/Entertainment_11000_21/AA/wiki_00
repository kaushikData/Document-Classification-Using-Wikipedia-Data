Lewis based on a story, \"A Horse for Mrs. Custer,\" by Glendon Swarthout set after the Battle of the Little Big Horn. Filmed in Mexico, the picture stars Randolph Scott and Barbara Hale.\n\nCaptain Tom Benson (Randolph Scott) has been granted a furlough to bring his bride-to-be Martha back to Fort Abraham Lincoln and his Regiment, the 7th Cavalry. Benson is mystified when he sees the fort apparently deserted with the colors not flying. Exploring the vacant post he is met by the hysterical Charlotte Reynolds (Jeanette Nolan) whose husband replaced Benson as commander of his \"C\" Company and was killed at the Battle of the Little Big Horn. Only a small group of misfits and guardhouse prisoners led by an old sergeant remain who have held a wake by drinking themselves into oblivion.\n\nOnce the commands of Major Marcus Reno (Frank Wilcox) and Captain Frederick Benteen (Michael Pate) have returned, they and the widows hold Benson in contempt, not only for not being at the battle in command of his men, but what they perceived as George Custer's liking for him, Benson's non-West Point background, and his career as a gambler until commissioned into the Regiment.\n\nMartha's father Colonel Kellogg (Russell Hicks) comes to the post to conduct a Board of Inquiry into Custer's actions that Benson sees as a smear against a man he admires who can not defend himself.\n\nHeld in contempt by his Regiment, when the President of the United States orders the recovery of the slain officers and the burial of the cavalrymen who fell in the battle, Benson takes his misfits and military prisoners into Indian territory to perform the task.\n\nThe Indians have made the land sacred ground and do not want to see the enemies they respected taken away from their burial site. A standoff develops as the cavalry insist on leaving the battleground with the dead officers' bodies. As the situation becomes tense a cavalryman is shot dead with an arrow whilst trying to escape. Then Custer's second horse (Dandy) appears - having been ridden out by a messenger who is unhorsed by an Indian scout away from the action - and is mistaken for Custer's dead horse (Vic) by the Indians. The bugler blows the call to charge and the horse gallops towards the cavalry's position. The Indians are said to believe that Custer's spirit has returned and allow the cavalry to leave the field. Back at the camp Captain Benson is reconciled with his father-in-law, and salutes as a 48-star American flag is raised.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6118554", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6118554", "title": "Bachatón", "text": "Bachatón\n\nBachatón is a fusion genre from Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic which combines bachata melodies and reggaeton style beats, lyrics, rapping, and disc jockeying. The word \"bachatón\" is a combination of \"bachata\" and \"reggaeton\". \"Bachatón\" was coined and widely accepted in 2005. It is a subgenre of reggaeton and bachata.\n\nBachata is a genre of music that originated in the Dominican Republic in the early parts of the 20th century and spread to other parts of Latin America and Mediterranean Europe. It became popular in the countryside and the rural neighborhoods of the Dominican Republic. Its subjects are often romantic; especially prevalent are tales of heartbreak and sadness. In fact, the original term used to name the genre was \"amargue\" (\"bitterness\" or \"bitter music\"), until the rather ambiguous (and mood-neutral) term \"bachata\" became popular. The form of dance, bachata, also developed with the music. The earliest bachata was originally developed in the Dominican Republic around the early part of the 20th century, with mixed Cuban boleros and, which originated from Son. with African elements, combined with traditional Latin/Caribbean rhythms. During much of its history, bachata music was denigrated by Latino/Caribbean society and associated with rural backwardness and delinquency. The typical bachata group consists of five instruments: lead guitar, rhythm guitar, electric bass guitar, bongos and güira.The rhythm guitar is also known as a \"segunda\" and serves the purpose of adding syncopation to the music. Bachata groups mainly play a simple style of bolero (lead guitar instrumentation using arpeggiated repetitive chords is a distinctive characteristic of bachata), but when they change to merengue based bachata, the percussionist will switch from bongo to a tambora drum. In the 1960s and 1970s, maracas were used instead of güira. The change in the 1980s from maracas to the more versatile güira was made as bachata was becoming more dance oriented.\nReggaetón is an urban form of music which has its roots in Latin and Caribbean music. Its sound derives from the Reggae en Español from Panama. The genre was invented, shaped and made known in Puerto Rico where it got its name; most of its current artists are also from Puerto Rico. After its mainstream exposure in 2004, it spread to North American, European, Asian and African audiences. Reggaeton blends Jamaican musical influences of dancehall, with those of Latin America, such as salsa, bomba, Latin hip hop, and electronica. Vocals include rapping and singing, typically in Spanish. Lyrics tend to be derived from hip hop rather than from dancehall. Like hip hop, reggaeton has caused some controversy, albeit less, due to alleged exploitation of women. While it takes influences from hip hop and Jamaican dancehall, reggaeton is not precisely the Hispanic or Latin American version of either of these genres; reggaeton has its own specific beat and rhythm, whereas Latin hip hop is simply hip hop recorded by artists of Latino descent. The specific \"riddim\" that characterizes reggaeton is referred to as \"Dem Bow\". The name is taken from the dancehall song by Shabba Ranks that first popularized the beat in the early 1990s which appears on his album \"Just Reality\".\n\nThe appearance of Dominican styles of music such as bachata and merengue in reggaetón coincided with the arrival in Puerto Rico of the Dominican-born production team of Luny Tunes—although they are not solely credited for this development. In 2000, they received an opportunity to work in the reggaeton studio of DJ Nelson. They began to produce a string of successful releases for reggaeton artists including Ivy Queen, Tego Calderón and Daddy Yankee. \"Pa' Que Retozen\", one of the first songs to combine bachata and reggaeton appeared on Tego Calderón's highly acclaimed \"El Abayarde\" (2002). It features the unmistakable guitar sounds of Dominican bachata—although, it was not produced by Luny Tunes but by DJ Joe. Luny Tunes however, on their debut studio album, \"Mas Flow\" (2003) included a hit by Calderón, \"Métele Sazón\". It exhibited bachata's signature guitar arpeggios as well as merengue's characteristic piano riffs.\n\nAfter the success of these songs, other artists began to incorporate bachata with reggaeton. Artists such as Ivy Queen began releasing singles that featured bachata's signature guitar sound and slower romantic rhythm as well as bachata's exaggerate emotional singing style. This is reflected in the hits \"Te He Querido, Te He Llorado\" and \"La Mala\". Daddy Yankee's \"Lo Que Paso, Paso\" and Don Omar's \"Dile\" also reflect this. A further use of bachata occurred in 2005 when producers began remixing existing reggaeton with bachata's characteristic guitar sounds marketing it as \"bachatón\" defining it as \"bachata, Puerto Rican style\".\n\n"}
{"id": "840351", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=840351", "title": "Battlefield 2", "text": "Battlefield 2\n\nBattlefield 2 is a 2005 first-person shooter military simulator video game, developed by Digital Illusions CE and published by Electronic Arts exclusively for Microsoft Windows as the third game in the \"Battlefield\" series.\n\nPlayers fight in a modern battlefield, using modern weapon systems. \"Battlefield 2\" is a first-person shooter with some strategy and Tactical Shooter elements.\n\nThe single-player aspect features missions that involve clashes between U.S. Marines, China and the fictional Middle Eastern Coalition. The multiplayer aspect of the game allows players to organize into squads that come under the leadership of a single commander to promote teamwork. The story takes place in the early 21st century during a fictional world war between various power blocs: China, the European Union, the fictional Middle Eastern Coalition (MEC), Russia and the United States. The game takes place in different fronts, as the Middle East and China are being invaded by US and EU forces, and the United States is being invaded by Chinese and MEC forces. A sequel, \"Battlefield 3\", was released in October 2011. On June 30, 2014, the multiplayer master server was shut down alongside other GameSpy-powered titles.\n\n\"Battlefield 2\" is a sequel to \"Battlefield Vietnam\", with many changes to the popular gameplay of the original. Many of these new gameplay features were added to the game with teamwork and collaboration in mind. The new game engine includes improved physics, dynamic lighting, and more realistic material penetration.\n\n\"Battlefield 2\" is a multiplayer game played via the Internet or on a local area network. A single-player mode with three difficulty levels is included. Both player modes use the same maps and use \"Battlefield\"s conquest game mode. Single-player mode allows 16 computer-controlled players while Internet mode allows up to 64 players. Players can choose to play as the United States Marine Corps, the People's Liberation Army, or the \"Middle Eastern Coalition\". Additional factions are playable through the expansion packs, such as the European Union. Progress in the game is made via promotions which allow additional weapons to be unlocked. By playing the game on ranked servers, players are able to add to their global player statistics. These statistics are used to award promotions and other achievements.\n\nIn \"Battlefield 2\", players are divided into two opposing teams (which factions they represent is dependent upon the map). The key objective in \"Battlefield 2\" is to reduce the opposing teams tickets. Tickets represent an army's ability to reinforce their position on the battlefield; each team has only a limited supply of tickets, and each casualty on the battlefield reduces the number of available tickets. Control points represent key points on the map, and are represented by flags. Control points are \"Battlefield 2\"s spawn points, and one team possessing a significant majority of the control points causes the other teams tickets to gradually decrease, regardless of casualties. A round ends when one team's tickets gone, the round's timer ends, or if at any point a team holds no control points, and has no soldiers alive on the battlefield (meaning they are not present in any way on the battlefield).\n\n\"Battlefield 2\"s two game modes are Conquest and Cooperative. The only difference between the two modes is that Cooperative includes computer-controlled players, whilst Conquest allows only human players. Results from Cooperative mode do not count toward global player statistics.\n\nIn \"Battlefield 2\", as with previous \"Battlefield\" titles, players are able to select from a variety of infantry classes. Each class of soldier is equipped with different weaponry appropriate to their role in the battle. Assault soldiers, for example, are general-purpose infantry with grenade-launcher equipped assault-rifles and extra armor, Medics carry first-aid equipment such as a field defibrillator, and Anti-Tank troopers are equipped with missiles which are effective against heavy armor.\n\nPlayers are able to choose a class at the start of a match, or between dying and respawn. Players can also change their class by picking up a \"kit\" from the body of an incapacitated soldier, friendly or otherwise. Hence, an Assault soldier can become a Medic if they come across a fallen Medic. Player classes are divided in 'Heavy' (with reduced damage done to the torso, but lower stamina) and 'Light' (with standard multipliers, but higher stamina, thus able to sprint for a longer time).\n\nWithin the infantry class, there are four support classes with special abilities. The Engineer can repair with his wrench, the Medic can revive with his defibrillator paddles and heal, the Support can resupply ammunition with his ammunition bags and the sniper can place claymores and engage long distance targets. When one of these three classes occupies a vehicle(with the exception of the recon), nearby personnel and vehicles can be replenished, repaired or healed by being in close proximity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe various forces still use the trademark feature of the \"Battlefield\" series – the large stable of vehicles that any player can climb into and control. There are many different types of vehicles playable in \"Battlefield 2\", all based on real-life vehicles used by the militaries of different countries.\n\nIn contrast to \"Battlefield 1942\", \"Battlefield 2\" has only one purely water-based vehicle, the rigid-inflatable boat; however, the BTR-90, the MEC APC, can travel in water as well as the LAV-25 and the WZ 551, the USMC and PLA equivalents, respectively. The developers tried to design the game so that every vehicle would be weak to another type of vehicle, intending to create a situation similar to a game of rock-paper-scissors. For example, mobile anti-air was intended to effectively destroy helicopters, but are vulnerable against opposing tanks. Included within this relationship are stationary defenses such as light machine guns and anti-aircraft/TOW emplacements. The availability and number of certain vehicles are dependent on the map and its size as well as control points captured. Also, more vehicles become available to be used on the maps of expansion/booster packs. (see Maps). The USS Essex is the only naval ship featured in BF2, featuring two spawn points and aircraft spawn points, and is not drivable or destroyable, except for its Phalanx turrets.\n\nPlayers are able to form squads of up to six soldiers in order to more effectively work as a team. Up to nine squads are permitted per team; each squad has a number (automatically assigned) and name (usually a phonetic alphabet letter) for identification. Members of a squad have the ability to communicate with one another via \"Battlefield 2\"s integrated voice over IP (VoIP) system.\n\nSquad leaders may assign their squad a variety of objectives (for example, moving to or attacking a specific location). Orders may also be given by the team's commander. Squad leaders are able to issue requests for commander assets (such as artillery fire) and have a direct VoIP channel to the commander.\n\nMembers of a squad may spawn near their squad leader, provided that the leader is not dead (or incapacitated), and that the team holds at least one control point. This feature allows squads to more quickly regroup after taking casualties.\n\nThe commander position is an exclusive role played by one member of each team. Any member of a team may apply for the position, but priority is given to players of higher rank.\n\nThe commander alone has access to the \"commander screen\", an interface similar to that of a real-time strategy game. This allows the commander an overview of the battlefield as a whole, or zoom in and view parts of the map in real-time. The commander also has control of the various commander assets, which include artillery strikes, vehicle and supply drops, and UAV's. They can deploy them to assist their team. The commander can communicate with squads either by sending orders, or via VoIP voice communication. These tools allow the commander to strategically coordinate their forces on the battlefield.\n\nA commander may resign at any point, freeing the position for other members of their team; they may also be forcibly removed by a successful mutiny vote conducted by their team (provided the server allows mutiny votes). Although the commander does not gain points by normal methods (kills, flag captures, etc.), their score is doubled at the end of the round if their team wins.\n\nThe commander position would be seen again in \"Battlefield 2142\" and \"Battlefield 4\".\n\nPlayers can earn awards (ribbons, badges, and medals) for certain in-game accomplishments. Badges and ribbons are the easiest to obtain, while medals are usually much harder, requiring more extensive play. As players ascend through the ranks they will gain the ability to unlock certain weapons. Each time a player is promoted to an eligible rank, they are given the opportunity to unlock one of seven unlockable weapons, one for each class, which they may subsequently use in place of the standard weapon for the given class.\n\nA built-in game recorder records battles for subsequent replay. These files can be downloaded from a server which supports BattleRecorder directly after their respective game. Recorded battle files are around 1 to 8 megabytes in size and are played within the \"Battlefield 2\" engine. Camera angles can be changed (free roaming & selected player), as well as the speed, though there is no rewind capability. Files can be exported to AVI format. The Battlefield Recorder has facilitated the creation of various machinima. Usage of the PunkBuster service is mandatory for all official ranked \"Battlefield 2\" servers, but optional for unranked servers.\n\n\"Battlefield 2\" offers 15 maps for the players to play but shipped with 12. These maps are diverse, ranging from swamps such as Songhua Stalemate, to urban areas such as Strike at Karkand, to an unfinished dam known as Kubra Dam. The USMC is present in all maps and faces against either the MEC or the PLA depending on the map. The PLA is present in Far East theaters such as Dragon Valley and Daqing Oilfields. MEC is present in Middle East theaters such as Gulf of Oman and Zatar Wetlands. The BF2 series including the expansion and booster packs puts the map count at 29 maps.\n\n\"Battlefield 2\" maps have 3 variations, each suited for a certain number of players. Each map has 16, 32, and 64 player-suggested variations in which the area of battlefield or playing field is relatively small, medium, and large, respectively. The only exceptions to this are Wake Island 2007, which is locked at 64-player size and the \"Euro Force\" maps, Operation Smokescreen, Great Wall, and Taraba Quarry, which have no 64-player size. 32 and 64 player maps are unavailable to offline players from retailers, but an option is given to download 64 Single player AI bot mods. Other contrasts between these variations other than the size are the number and position of control points and availability of vehicles. As a result, the gameplay of the map is different depending on the variation.\n\nThe game is set in 2007 during a world war between various power blocs: the United States aided by the European Union, Britain and Chechen resistance are at war against Russia, China and the fictional Middle Eastern Coalition (MEC) aided by various insurgent groups.\n\nThere is no given reason as to how or why the war broke out, though one likely theory is for control of oil reserves. In-game, the European Union and the United States fight China and the MEC. It is mentioned in-game that the US and EU are allies and the EU has negotiated a truce with Russia, but it is unknown if China and the MEC are allies. The game also takes place in different fronts, as the Middle East and China are being invaded by US and EU forces, and the United States is being invaded by Chinese and MEC forces.\n\n\"Battlefield 2\"'s first expansion pack, \"Special Forces\", first began its development sometime during or shortly before the release of the original \"Battlefield 2\" by DICE: \"Battlefield\" producer, Mike Doran, commented in August 2005 that \"The truth is that work on \"Battlefield 2: Special Forces\" began several months ago.\" It was officially announced on July 14, 2005 and released on November 21 of the same year. The focus of the development was infantry-based combat as opposed to vehicle-centric combat from the original. As such, most of the additional content in the expansion pack can only be used by or for infantry.\n\nThe expansion pack provides eight maps, 6 playable factions, and ten more vehicles such as the AH-64D Apache and Mi-35 Hind, though all jets have been removed. In addition to these new contents, players have access to new equipment such as night vision goggles, tear gas, gas masks, zip lines and grappling hooks which can alter gameplay. There are eight more small arms weapons available such as the G36K/E and FN SCAR L/H and several weapons from the original are replaced. The expansion offers more awards in the form of badges, ribbons, and medals that players can earn. Finally, many of the weapons from the expansion may be used in the original \"Battlefield 2\".\n\nBooster packs are additional content released for \"Battlefield 2\" that are currently available for free download. The booster packs were later available in retail form as the \"Booster Pack Collection\", containing a DVD which features these packs, as well as being included in \"The Complete Collection\", containing a DVD with both the original game and all of the expansions/booster packs.\n\nBooster packs add a significant amount of content to the game, but are different from expansion packs because they are intended to add to the original gameplay and not stand on their own (such as \"Special Forces\" does). The booster packs include new maps, vehicles, and a new European Union faction.\n\nThe two booster packs were included free of charge in the 1.50 update released on September 1, 2009.\n\n\"Battlefield 2: Euro Force\" is the first booster pack, and was released on March 14, 2006. The booster pack allows players to play as a new European Union army, armed with new weapons and vehicles from the various countries of the EU. It is available for purchase online at the Electronic Arts download service, or as part of the retail \"Booster Pack Collection\". It was scheduled for release in February, but was delayed due to a substantial number of new bugs caused by the release of patch 1.2. It features a whole new army, 4 new vehicles, 3 new maps, and 7 new weapons such as the L85A2 with AG36 GL, the FAMAS, the HK53, the HK21, and the Benelli M4. Some of the vehicles for the EU military include the Challenger 2, Eurocopter Tiger, Leopard 2A6 and the Eurofighter. The maps include 'The Great Wall of China', against the People's Liberation Army of China, where the EU army is trying to gain a strong foothold in northern China, to reinforce their American allies in the south later on. 'Operation Smoke Screen' features the EU army fighting the MEC in the Middle East for precious oil fields, and the third map, 'Taraba Quarry', where the EU army is trying to reinforce American positions in the south. Mindful of the European plans, the MEC tries to stall the EU, where the Europeans must confront their enemies because that route is the only possible path along that side of the Caspian Sea.\n\nIt was made free with patch 1.5.\n\n\"Battlefield 2: Armored Fury\" is the second booster pack released for \"Battlefield 2\" and was released on June 6, 2006. It added three new maps, as well as two new vehicle classes: attack jets for close air support and reconnaissance helicopters that operate as a mobile UAV. The booster pack has the USMC defending U.S. soil from invasions from the PLA and MEC. Operation Midnight Sun features the Chinese landing at the Alaskan port Valdez where they are trying to secure much needed fuel from the pipeline. Operation Road Rage is a MEC vs. USMC map, where the MEC are using US Highways to transport units to industrial areas. Operation Harvest sees the United States trying to stall the MEC en route to the capital from the northwest, being blocked in a Pennsylvania Dutch farm, while waiting for reinforcements. New vehicles include Attack or Close Air Support aircraft such as the A-10 Thunderbolt II, Su-39 and the Nanchang Q-5 as well as new light utility helicopters such as MH-6 Little Bird, EC-635 and the Z-11. As well as the addition of new helicopters and planes, DICE also added the Muscle Car and Semi Truck. However, the proposed AV-8B Harrier was cut from the add-on due to balancing issues.\n\nLike Euro Force, it was made free with patch 1.5.\n\nThe soundtrack of Battlefield 2 consists of 18 tracks composed and created by Fredrik Englund, David Tallroth, and Jonas Östholm.\n\nThe game received widespread critical acclaim, garnering an aggregate score of 91/100 from 55 reviews on Metacritic. It received five stars out of five from publications Yahoo! Games, GameSpy, X-Play and Computer Gaming World. PC Gamer awarded it 94%, stating, \"Its finely tuned maps and balanced gameplay prove that you \"can\" improve on perfection,\" and honored it as Game of the Year. GameSpot rated the game 9.3 out of 10 claiming that \"when you experience \"Battlefield 2\" like it's meant to be played, with everyone working together and using real-time voice chat, the game quickly becomes unlike anything else that you've played before.\"\n\nSome of the lower scores were reactions to the large amount of bugs and glitches in the initial release, including crash to desktop bugs and network problems. For example, Gaming Nexus (who awarded the game an 8.7 out of 10) reported, \"I’ve had many cool experiences playing it and a lot of 'did I just see that' moments but all of that is crapped on by the bugs and quirks in the game.\"\n\nGamesRadar approved of the game, awarding a 90%, but added a disclaimer that the gaming experience is best \"if your machine is up to it\". GameSpot's review agreed with the high system requirements noting that \"the load times are one of the biggest gripes that we have, as you will spend quite a bit of time waiting for a game to start up, even on high-end machines...also a bit demanding in the hardware department.\"\n\n\"Battlefield 2\" sold 1 million copies in its first month after release. Total sales by July 2006 were 2,225,000. It received a \"Gold\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom.\n\n\"Battlefield 2\" won \"PC Gamer US\"s \"Best Multiplayer Game 2005\" and \"Game of the Year 2005\" awards. The magazine's Dan Stapleton wrote, \"Few other games in the history of the medium have so effectively captured the visceral feeling of modern military combat in an urban environment\". The editors of \"Computer Games Magazine\" presented \"Battlefield 2\" with their 2005 awards for \"Best Action Game\" and \"Best Multiplayer\", and named it the year's second-best computer game overall. They called it \"perhaps the most thrilling example of how far shooters have come in the last few years.\"\n\n"}

The game follows the protagonist Vieg who is partnered with his pregnant wife Vahti. Along with them are Vahti's parents Olgar and Rachel, Ayuta and Kushina, as well as Cyllis and Yorath. The Agent tells them the same set up that was in the original Chaos Rings and Vieg challenges him. Olgar joins up and they try to take on the Agent and lose badly. The Agent calls the Executioner and then Vahti and Rachel step in to help out. The Agent relents, saying that he can't afford to lose so many of them so soon and calls off the Executioner.\n\nVahti goes into labor shortly after and Rachel helps. Vieg and Olgar team up and find the first two rings. At that point, the Agent tells them the first matches will be Ayuta/Kushina vs Cyllis/Yorath and Olgar/Rachel vs Vieg/Vahti. Vieg and Olgar protest that Vahti is in labor and ask that the first match be held off until Vieg's child is born. The Agent agrees, saying that their offspring is important. Everyone chips in to help and Vahti soon gives birth to a baby boy, Ohm. The Agent then tells everyone it's time for the matches. Rachel stays to help Vahti recover, but everyone else leaves. Olgar tells Vieg he has a plan, but it's a long shot. Upon getting to the arena, Olgar tells Vieg that his plan is for them to fight to the death and see which is stronger.\n\nVieg reluctantly defeats Olgar, however when the Executioner shows up to finish the job, Olgar attacks. Olgar's plan was to lure out the Executioner since it is weaker than the Agent and take it on separately. Vieg joins up and they finish off the Executioner.\n\nMeanwhile, Kushina has been killed by Cyllis and Yorath. Ayuta is sobbing over her and Cyllis reveals that her target is Theia, Ayuta's original partner. She and Yorath butcher Ayuta to death offscreen.\n\nWhen Olgar and Vieg return together, the Ark is quiet. They go to check on Vahti and Rachel and find Rachel's clothes in a gory mess in the room. The Agent calls them and Olgar and Vieg stand off against him, thinking he killed Rachel. The Agent denies having anything to do with it, but says that the situation has changed and it has no use for them anymore. Olgar and Vieg fight and are losing against the Agent when Cyllis and Yorath show up. Yorath kills the Agent in one hit and the Agent comments that it recognizes a genetic pattern in them and can't seem to contact the Master before it dies.\n\nCyllis and Yorath tell Vieg and Olgar that they killed Rachel and have Vahti and Ohm hostage. They tell Olgar and Vieg that they will kill Rachel and Vahti if they can't kill 4 great beasts before 12 bells ring. Olgar leaves Vieg alone to kill the first beast while he gives Rachel a proper burial. While Vieg is going solo, Yorath shows up and tells Vieg the whole story about the Ark arena and reveals that the monsters they are all facing are all called \"Congloms\" and they are all born from Cyllis. He also reveals that he is a Conglom as well.\n\nOlgar rejoins Vieg and they go after the next 3 beasts. Vieg brings Olgar up to speed on what Yorath told him. Yorath pops in and gives them Ohm back. They have Piu Piu take care of Ohm while they continue. Yorath later pops in and tells them that Cyllis has prepared a surprise for them with the last beast. They find that the last beast cannot be damaged by solo attacks and they have to use Pair attacks to damage him. After he is defeated, three more pop up. Olgar tells Vieg that he'll hold them off while Vieg goes to get Vahti.\n\nVieg pursues Cyllis to the Conglom Plant where he's confronted with both her and Yorath. Cyllis shows him Vahti and Ohm (who she's reclaimed after Yorath gave him up) suspended over lava. Vieg fights Cyllis and Yorath and when Cyllis dies she retreats leaving Yorath to deal with Vieg. Vieg loses the fight and when Yorath is closing in for the kill he narrowly evades a jump attack from behind by Olgar. Olgar fights against Yorath and despite being outmatched Olgar refuses to die and eventually Yorath is hurt badly enough that he has to escape. At that point, the final bell tolls and Yorath tells Vieg and Olgar that they are too late. Both Vahti and Ohm drop down towards the lava. Olgar grabs a floor panel and throws it under them, wedging it into a metal strut. He then jumps after them and grabs them, but the floor panel gives way and they all fall into the lava.\n\nOlgar lives, knee deep in the lava and carries Vahti and Ohm to safety. As he's sinking into the lava, he tells Vieg that he's to take Olgar's old job and name as captain and that Olgar himself will go back to his old name Dante and then sinks the rest of the way into the lava.\n\nWe flash forward to Vieg, now Olgar, neglecting Vahti and Ohm to fight solo and make himself stronger. He is angry that he wasn't able to do more to help. Vahti calms him down and they agree to go together to finish the fight with Cyllis. They go further into the Conglom Plant and eventually confront Yorath. This time, they have gotten strong enough to defeat him and he yields to them. They then get to Cyllis and fight and defeat her. As a last-ditch measure, Cyllis spawns a Conglom that's a beastlike combination of Dante and Rachel. Olgar and Vahti defeat it and Theia announces that the Original Door is now open and Cyllis promises that the conflict isn't over, but Dante/Rachel hold her back while Olgar and Vahti escape.\n\nWhen Olgar and Vahti go out of the Original Door, they find that they are on the deck of the Ark, which is still going back in time. Cyllis breaks through the deck and tells them that Theia opened the Original Door too early and that this spacetime outside the Ark will cease to exist soon. Cyllis blocks their exit back into the Ark while Olgar and Vahti defeat her. She still blocks their exit, though, until Yorath shows up and warps them out. Cyllis and Yorath die together when the Ark drops back into normal spacetime. Now, Olgar, Vahti, and Ohm are back on Earth 10,000 years in the past and are told that they will be the new Original Couple and need to rebuild a new human race capable of defeating the Qualia. Theia tells them that their descendants will be the ones that bring about the final battle and warps off.\n\nThe game's soundtrack is composed by Noriyasu Agematsu with only eight songs in the official soundtrack.\n\n"}
{"id": "1343434", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1343434", "title": "Cinema of Iran", "text": "Cinema of Iran\n\nThe Cinema of Iran (Persian: \"سینمای ایران\"), also known as the Cinema of Persia, refers to the cinema and film industries in Iran which produce a variety of commercial films annually. Iranian art films have garnered international fame and now enjoy a global following.\n\nAlong with China, Iran has been lauded as one of the best exporters of cinema in the 1990s. Some critics now rank Iran as the world's most important national cinema, artistically, with a significance that invites comparison to Italian neorealism and similar movements in past decades. A range of international film festivals have honored Iranian cinema in the last twenty years. World-renowned Austrian filmmaker Michael Haneke and German filmmaker Werner Herzog, along with many film critics from around the world, have praised Iranian cinema as one of the world's most important artistic cinemas.\n\nThe earliest examples of visual representations in Iranian history may be traced back to the bas-reliefs in Persepolis (c. 500 B. C.). Bas relief is a method of sculpting which entails carving or etching away the surface of a flat piece of stone or metal. Persepolis was the ritual center of the ancient kingdom of Achaemenids and \"the figures at Persepolis remain bound by the rules of grammar and syntax of visual language.\"\n\nIranian visual arts maybe said to have peaked about a thousand years later during the Sassanian reign. A bas-relief from this period in Taq Bostan (western Iran) depicts a complex hunting scene. Similar works from the period have been found to articulate movements and actions in a highly sophisticated manner. It is even possible to see the progenitor of the cinema close-up: a wounded wild pig escaping from the hunting ground, among these works of art.\n\nAfter the conversion from Zoroastrianism to Islam — a religion in which visual symbols were avoided — Persian art continued its visual practices. Persian miniatures provide great examples of such continued attempts. The deliberate lack of perspective in Persian miniature enabled the artist to have different plots and sub-plots within the same image space. A very popular form of such art was \"Pardeh Khani\". Another type of art in the same category was \"Naqqali\".\n\nPopular dramatic performance arts in Iran, before the advent of cinema, include Marionette, Saye-bazi (shadow plays), Rouhozi (comical acts), and Ta'zieh.\n\nCinema was only five years old when it came to Persia at the beginning of the 20th century. The first Persian filmmaker was Mirza Ebrahim Khan Akkas Bashi, the official photographer of Muzaffar al-Din Shah, the King of Persia from 1896–1907. After a visit to Paris in July 1900, Akkas Bashi obtained a camera and filmed the Shah's visit to Europe upon the Shah's orders. He is said to have filmed the Shah's private and religious ceremonies, but no copies of such films exist today. A few years after Akkas Bashi started photography, Khan Baba Motazedi, another pioneer in Iranian motion picture photography emerged. He shot a considerable amount of newsreel footage during the reign of Qajar to the Pahlavi dynasty.\nThe first public screening took place in Tehran in 1904, presented by Mirza Ebrahim Khan Sahaf Bashi. He arranged the screening in the back of his antique shop. In 1905, Sahaf Bashi opened the first movie theater in Cheragh Gaz Avenue in the national capital.\nIn 1909, with fall of the Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar heir of Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar and the success of the constitutionalists, Russi Khan lost his support. Consequently, his film theatre and photography studios were destroyed by the public. Soon after, other cinema theatres in Tehran closed down. Movie theatres sprang up again in 1912 with the help of Ardeshir Khan an Armenian -Iranian. In 1925, Ovanes Ohanian decided to establish the first film school in Iran.\nIn 1904, Mirza Ebrahim Khan Sahhafbashi opened the first movie theater in Tehran. The cinematographic camera was introduced to Iran in 1929, as yet another tool of modernization. After Mirza Ebrahim Khan, several others like Russi Khan, Ardeshir Khan, and Ali Vakili tried to establish new movie theaters in Tehran. Until the early 1930s, there were little more than 15 theatres in Tehran and 11 in other provinces. In 1925, Ovanes Ohanian, decided to establish the first film school in Iran. Within five years he managed to run the first session of the school under the name \"Parvareshgahe Artistiye Cinema\".\n\nIn 1930 the first Iranian silent film was made by Professor Ovanes Ohanian called \"Abi and Rabi\". In 1933 he made his second film titled \"Haji Agha\". Later that year, Abdolhossein Sepanta made the first Iranian sound film, entitled \"Lor Girl\", which was released in 1933 in two Tehran cinemas, Mayak and Sepah. The story of the film was based on a comparison between the state of security in Iran at the end of the Qajar dynasty and during Reza Shah period. Sepanta would go on to direct movies such as \"Ferdowsi\" (the life story of the most celebrated epic poet of Iran), \"Shirin and Farhad\" (a classic Iranian love story), and \"Black Eyes\" (the story of Nader Shah's invasion of India). In 1937, he directed \"Laili and Majnoon\", an Eastern love story similar to the English story of \"Romeo and Juliet\".\n\nThe present day Iranian film industry owes much of its progress to two industrious personalities, Esmail Koushan and Farrokh Ghaffari. By establishing the first National Iranian Film Society in 1949 at the Iran Bastan Museum and organizing the first Film Week during which English films were exhibited, Ghaffari laid the foundation for alternative and non-commercial films in Iran.\n\nEarly Persian directors like Abdolhossein Sepanta and Esmail Koushan took advantage of the richness of Persian literature and ancient Persian mythology. In their work, they emphasized ethics and humanity.\n\nThe 1960s was a significant decade for Iranian cinema, with 25 commercial films produced annually on average throughout the early ‘60s, increasing to 65 by the end of the decade. The majority of production focused on melodrama and thrillers.\nFrom 1937 till 1947 because of the world economic conditions and then the involvement in World War Two, the motion picture industry in Iran did not produce a single film, but the flow of foreign film to Iran did not stop. In 1947, Esmail Koushan, With the help of some of his colleagues, he established Mitra Films (1997), the first real film company in Tehran, Iran. Through their persistence, local feature film production was born and survived.\nThe movie that really boost the economy of Iranian cinema and initiated a new genre was \"Ganj-e Qarun\" (Croesus Treasure), made in 1965 by Syamak Yasami. Four years later Masoud Kimiai made \"Kaiser\". With \"Kaiser\" (Qeysar), Kimiai depicted the ethics and morals of the romanticized poor working class of the Ganj-e-Qarun genre through his main protagonist, the titular Qeysar. But Kimiay's film generated another genre in Iranian popular cinema: the tragic action drama.\n\nWith the screening of the films \"Kaiser\" and \"The Cow\", directed by Masoud Kimiai and Darius Mehrjui respectively in 1969, alternative film established their status in the film industry.By 1970 Iranian cinema entered into its mature stage. The College of Dramatic Arts, instituted in 1963, produced its first graduates at the decade’s beginning. Many progressive film co-ops and associations came into existence and there were a few regular film festivals taking place in the country. Attempts to organize a film festival that had begun in 1954 within the framework of the \"Golrizan Festival\", bore fruits in the form of the \"Sepas Film Festival\" in 1969. The endeavors of Ali Mortazavi also resulted in the formation of the \"Tehran International Film Festival\" in 1973.\nFrom 1950 to the mid-1960 the Iranian film industry grew rapidly. Many studios were established as well as others that entered the Cycle of the film industry independently. There were 324 films produced during this period 1950 for 1965. By 1965 there were 72 movie theatres in Tehran and 192 in other Provinces. Ebrahim Golestan in 1965 directed by films of interest \"Brick and Mirror\" 1965. Bahram Beyzai is the director of one of the ground-breaking films of the Iranian New wave, 1972 \"Ragbar\" (\"Downpour\"). Sohrab Shahid-Saless is auteur director who embodied his original style in his 1975 film \"Still Life\". Abbas Kiarostami is now a well-known director of the 1990s who directed one of the last films that screened before the revolution in 1978, \"Gozaresh\" (\"The Report\").\n\nIn the early 1970s, a New Iranian Cinema emerged (\"cinema motefävet\"). However, following the Revolution in 1979, a few filmmakers and actors went into exile as Khomeini altered the focus in features. Between 1979 and 1985, about 100 features were released. While Khomeini's censorship remained, the small number of features produced focused on sexual display and European influence.\n\nIn 1982, the annual Fajr Film Festival financed films. The Farabi Cinema Foundation then stepped in to try and reassemble the disorganized cinema. The following year, the government began to provide financial aid. This change in regime encouraged a whole new generation of filmmakers, which included female directors as well. With this, the focus shifted to children overcoming obstacles: true stories, lyrical, mystical drama, real-life problems, documentary footage, etc.\n\nPost-revolutionary Iranian cinema has been celebrated in many international forums and festivals for its distinct style, themes, authors, idea of nationhood, and cultural references. Starting With Viva... by Khosrow Sinai and followed by many excellent Iranian directors who emerged in the last few decades, such as Abbas Kiarostami and Jafar Panahi. Kiarostami, who some critics regard as one of the few great directors in the history of cinema, planted Iran firmly on the map of world cinema when he won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival for \"Taste of Cherry\" in 1997.\n\nThe continuous presence of Iranian films in prestigious international festivals such as the Cannes Film Festival, the Venice Film Festival, and the Berlin Film Festival attracted world attention to Iranian masterpieces .. In 2006, six Iranian films, of six different styles, represented Iranian cinema at the Berlin Film Festival. Critics considered this a remarkable event in the history of Iranian cinema.\n\nAn important step was taken in 1998 when the Iranian government began to fund ethnic cinema. Since then Iranian Kurdistan has seen the rise of numerous filmmakers. In particular, the film industry got momentum in Iranian Kurdistan and the region has seen the emergence of filmmakers such as Bahman Ghobadi, actually the entire Ghobadi family, Ali-Reza Rezai, Khosret Ressoul and many other younger filmmakers.\n\nThere is also movie-documentary production, often critical of the society in the name of the Islamic revolution ideal, like the films directed by Mohammedreza Eslamloo.\n\nBy the year 2001 the number of features produced in Iran rose to 87 (from 28, which is the number of films that were produced in 1980, after the fall of the Shah). The most popular genres were melodramas and historical pageants which seldom went to festivals. In 1997, the newly elected president, Mohammed Khatemi, would eventually come to play a role in helping filmmakers achieve a certain degree of artistic freedom.\n\nToday, the Iranian box office is dominated by commercial Iranian films. Western films are occasionally shown in movie theaters. and contemporary Hollywood productions are shown on state television. Iranian art films are often not screened officially, and are viewable via unlicensed DVDs which are available. , some of these acclaimed films were eened in Iran and had box office success. Examples include Rassul Sadr Ameli's \"I’m Taraneh, 15\", Rakhshan Bani-Etemad's \"Under the skin of the City\", Bahman Ghobadi's \"Marooned in Iraq\" and Manijeh Hekmat's \"Women's Prison\".\n\nThe internationally award-winning cinema of Iran is quite different from the domestically oriented films. The latter caters to an entirely different audience, which is largely under the age of 25. This commercial Iranian cinema genre is largely unknown in the West, as the films are targeted at local audiences. There are Three categories of this type of film:\n\n\"Lor Girl\", \"A Party in Hell\", \"Qeysar\", \"Dar Emtedade Shab\", \"Amir Arsalan\", and \"Ganj-e Qarun\".\n\"Eagles\", \"Barzakhiha\", \"The Viper\", \"Dadshah\", \"Boycott\", \"Duel\", \"Taraj\", \"Ekhrajiha\", \"The Glass Agency\", \"Kani Manga\", \"Ofogh\", \"Bashu, the Little Stranger\", \"Leily Ba Man Ast\", \"M as in Mother\" and \"The Night Bus\".\n\nFor many years, the most visible face of Iranian commercial cinema was Mohammad Ali Fardin, who starred in a number of popular successful films. In the more conservative social climate of Iran after the Iranian Revolution of 1979, however, he came to be considered an embarrassment to Iranian national identity and his films — which depicted romance, alcohol, vulgarity, objectification of women, scantily-dressed men and women, nightclubs, and a vulgar lifestyle now condemned by the Islamic government — were banned. Although this would effectively prevent Fardin from making films for the remainder of his life, the ban did little to diminish his broad popularity with Iranian moviegoers: His funeral in Tehran was attended by 20,000 mourners. Before Fardin, one could argue, Iran simply did not have a commercial cinema.\n\nDuring the war years, crime thrillers such as \"Senator\", \"The Eagles\", \"Boycott\", \"The Tenants\", and \"Kani Manga\" occupied the first position on the sales charts.\n\nOfficially, the Iranian government disdains American cinema: in 2007 President Ahmadinejad's media adviser told the Fars news agency, \"We believe that the American cinema system is devoid of all culture and art and is only used as a device.\" However, numerous Western commercial films such as \"Jaws\", \"The Illusionist\", \"Passion of the Christ\", \"House of Sand and Fog\", \"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\", \"Sherlock Holmes\", \"Alpha and Omega\", \"Scarface\", \"Casino Royale\", \"The Mechanic\", and \"The Aviator\" have been screened in Iranian cinemas and Iranian film festivals since the revolution. Despite great pride in the country's more than 100-year film history, Western cinema is enormously popular among Iran's young people, and practically every recent Hollywood film is available on CD, DVD, or video. State television has also broadcast more Western movies—partly because millions of Iranians have been switching to the use of banned satellite television equipment.\n\nIranian New Wave refers to a new movement in Iranian cinema. According to film critic Eric Henderson, the acclaimed documentary The House Is Black (خانه سیاه است) directed by Forough Farrokhzad (famous Iranian poet and director) paved the way for the Iranian New Wave. The movement started in 1964 with Hajir Darioush's second film \"Serpent's Skin\", which was based on D.H. Lawrence's \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\" featuring Fakhri Khorvash and Jamshid Mashayekhi. Darioush's two important early social documentaries \"But Problems Arose\" in 1965, dealing with the cultural alienation of the Iranian youth, and \"Face 75\", a critical look at the westernization of the rural culture, which was a prizewinner at the 1965 Berlin Film Festival, were also contributing significantly to the establishment of the New Wave.\n\nIn 1969, after the release of \"The Cow\" directed by Darius Mehrjui followed by Masoud Kimiai's \"Qeysar\", and Nasser Taqvai's \"Calm in Front of Others\", the New Wave became well established as a prominent cultural, dynamic and intellectual trend. The Iranian viewer became discriminating, encouraging the new trend to prosper and develop.\nIn the 1960s, there were 'New Wave' movements in the cinema of numerous countries. The pioneers of the Iranian New Wave were directors like Forough Farrokhzad, Sohrab Shahid Saless, Bahram Beizai, and Parviz Kimiavi. They made innovative art films with highly political and philosophical tones and poetic language. Subsequent films of this type have become known as the New Iranian cinema to distinguish them from their earlier roots. The most notable figures of the Iranian New Wave are Abbas Kiarostami, Jafar Panahi, Majid Majidi, Bahram Beizai, Darius Mehrjui, Mohsen Makhmalbaf, Khosrow Sinai, Sohrab Shahid-Saless, Parviz Kimiavi, Samira Makhmalbaf, Amir Naderi, and Abolfazl Jalili.\n\nThe factors leading to the rise of the New Wave in Iran were, in part, due to the intellectual and political movements of the time. A romantic climate was developing after the 19 August 1953 coup in the sphere of arts. Alongside this, a socially committed literature took shape in the 1950s and reached a peak in the 1960s, which may consider as the golden era of contemporary Persian literature.\n\nFeatures of New Wave Iranian film, in particular the works of legendary Abbas Kiarostami, can be classified as postmodern.\n\nIranian New Wave films shared some characteristics with the European art films of the period, in particular Italian Neorealism. However, in her article 'Real Fictions', Rose Issa argues that Iranian films have a distinctively Iranian cinematic language\n\nIn his book \"Close Up: Iranian Cinema, Past, Present, Future\" (2001) describes modern Iranian cinema and the phenomenon of [\"Iranian\"] national cinema as a form of cultural modernity. According to Dabashi, \"the visual possibility of seeing the historical person (as opposed to the eternal Qur'anic man) on screen is arguably the single most important event allowing Iranians access to modernity.\"\n\nWhile Beyzai and Taghvai represent the first generation and Karim-Masihi and Kiarostami represent the second generation of New wave filmmakers, the third generation is represented by Rafi Pitts, Bahman Ghobadi, Maziar Miri, Asghar Farhadi, Mani Haghighi, and Babak Payami, along with newly emerged filmmakers such as Saman Salur and Abdolreza Kahani.\n\nParallel to the Iranian New Wave, with its neorealist and minimalist art cinema, there exists a so-called \"popular art cinema\" in Iran. Filmmakers who belong to this circle make films with a broader range of audience than the narrow spectrum of highly educated people who admire the New Wave, but believe that their movies are also artistically sound. Filmmakers such as Nasser Taghvaee and Ali Hatami are the best examples of this cinematic movement (some of these filmmakers also make new wave films e.g. \"Mum's Guest\" by Darius Mehrjui). The Demon and the Bald Hassan, Adam and Eve, The Fisherman's Story, City of Oranges, and Talisman are some of Hatami's works.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Iranian New Wave, there are now record numbers of film school graduates in Iran and each year more than 20 new directors make their debut films, many of them women. In the last two decades, there have been a higher percentage of women directors in Iran than in most countries in the West.\nSamira Makhmalbaf directed her first film, \"The Apple\", when she was only 17 years old and won the Cannes Jury Prize in 2000 for her following film \"The Blackboard\".\n\nThe success and hard work of the pioneering Rakhshan Bani-Etemad is an example that many women directors in Iran were following much before Samira Makhmalbaf made the headlines And the current Tahmineh Milani, Niki Karimi. Internationally recognized figures in Iranian women's cinema are:\n\nBesides women involved in screenwriting and filmmaking, numerous award-winning Iranian actresses with uniques styles and talents attract critic. The first Iranian actress who won an award for acting in a major film festival was Mary Apick. The most notable Iranian actresses are:\n\n\n\nWar cinema in Iran was born simultaneously with the beginning of Iran–Iraq War. However, it took many years until it found its way and identity by defining characteristics of \"Iranian war cinema\".\nShows the most poematic view on the Iran Iraq war and still after years, is one of the leading films about this historical event from a humanistic aspect, although unlike other Iranian war cinema which are fully supported by the Iranian government this film was made with numerous difficulties.\nIn the past decades, the Iranian film industry has produced many war films. In the Iranian war film genre, war has often been portrayed as glorious and \"holy\", bringing out the good in the protagonist and pandering to nationalist sentiments with propagandistic messaging. \"Tears of Cold\" and \"Duel\" were two films that have gone beyond the traditional view of war.\nMany renowned directors were involved in developing \"Iranian war cinema\":\n\n\n\nOther films famous and popular Iran Iraq War: \"Goodbye Life\" directed by Ensieh Shah-Hosseini, \"Heeva\", \"Mazrae-ye pedari\" and \"Safar be Chazabeh\" directed by Rasoul Mollagholipour, \"Kirkuk Operation\", \"Hoor on Fire\" and \"Kani Manga\" directed by Seifollah Dad. \"Che\", \"Az Karkheh ta Rhein\", \"Mohajer\" and \"The Red Ribbon\" directed by Ebrahim Hatamikia. \"Big Drum Under Left Foot\" directed by Kazem Masoumi. \"Gilaneh\" directed by Rakhshan Bani-E'temad. \"The Day Third\" directed by Mohammad Hossein Latifi. \"The Reward of Silence\" directed by Maziar Miri. \"Sizdah 59\" directed by Saman Salur. \"The Queen\" directed by Mohammad Ali Bashe Ahangar. \"Mardi shabih-e baran\" directed by Saeed Soheili. \"Bashu, the Little Stranger\" directed by Bahram Beyzai. \"Snake Fang\" directed by Masoud Kimiai and \"Hoor dar Atash\" directed by Azizollah Hamidnezhad.\n\nThere exist some evidences suggesting that Ancient Iranians made animations. An animated piece on an earthen goblet made 5000 years ago was found in Burnt City in Sistan-Baluchistan province, southeastern Iran. The artist has portrayed a goat that jumps toward a tree and eats its leaves.\n\nThe first Tehran International Animation Festival was held in 1999, four decades after the time the production of first animation films in Iran. The Second Tehran International Animation Festival was held in February 2001. Apart from Iranian films, animations from 35 foreign countries participated in the festival.\n\nThe following are among the notable filmmakers of Iranian animated films:\n\n\n\nAmongst the pioneers of French New Wave were François Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Claude Chabrol and Eric Rohmer or Barbet Schroeder (born in Tehran, Iran in 1941 where his German geologist Father was on assignment).\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, France was the major destination for Iranian students who wished to study abroad. Iranian Ambassador to the United Nations Fereydoun Hoveyda was one of them. Fereydoun Hoveyda played a major role in French cultural scene and especially in the field of Cinema, for he was the protégé of François Truffaut whom he befriended and with whom he helped create the well-known film magazine \"Les Cahiers du Cinéma\" that spearheaded the French Nouvelle Vague or New Wave Cinema. He also worked closely with Italian film director Roberto Rossellini on several film scripts during that period. Fereydoun Hoveyda was not the only Iranian of his generation to play an active role in promoting the French Cinéma d'Auteur. Youssef Ishaghpour is another example.\n\nAnother Iranian figure in French New Wave was Shusha Guppy a singer, writer and filmmaker who was Jacques Prévert's girlfriend. However, the most important contribution to the French New Wave cinema is that of Serge Rezvani an Iranian poet born in Tehran in 1928. He played a major role as music composer of both François Truffaut \"Jules et Jim\" and Jean-Luc Godard \"Pierrot le Fou\", considered as landmarks of French New Wave Cinema.\n\nFarah Diba studied at the Beaux Arts and became the focus of attention and the French press was to see her as the new Persian Cinderella. Farah Diba was one of the rare foreign dignitaries to become a permanent member of the French Académie des Beaux-Arts.\n\nIranian Robert Hossein (son of legendary musician Aminollah Hossein) started his acting career with his French Armenian friend Chahnour Varinag Aznavourian (known as the famed crooner Charles Aznavour) in the mid fifties essentially type cast as \"Mr. Tough Guy\". However he got international acclaim in the early Sixties particularly in Europe, Russia and Asia as the mysterious \"Jeoffrey, Comte de Peyrac\" lover of the lovely Michèle Mercier in the soft erotic-adventure film series of \"Angélique Marquise des Anges\". In the seventies and eighties he was to play opposite Jean-Paul Belmondo in police thrillers like \"The Professional\". Hossein became known for being a talented theater director and his taste for popular historical vehicles involving large sets and numerous actors.\n\nAfter the resignation of French President Charles de Gaulle, Iranian Anicée Shahmanesh became known under the screen name Anicée Alvina, playing a French girl in a British film hit called \"Friends\", the music score of which propelled British pop star Elton John. She was also to take on a courageous lesbian role in the screen adaptation of Françoise Mallet-Joris' novel \"Le Rempart des Béguines\".\n\nTwo major documentaries were produced in these years by respectively Agnès Varda and the duo Claude Lelouch-Claude Pinoteau.\n\nAgnès Varda, first to be discovered to young actor Gérard Depardieu in her 1970 film \"Nausicaa\", directed a love story set in Isfahan (1976) between a French woman (Valérie Mairesse) visiting Iran as a tourist and her guide an Iranian Man (Ali Raffi). The film was entitled \"Plaisir D'Amour en Iran\". The romantic film was shot on location in \"The Masjed Shah\".\n\nClaude Pinoteau and Claude Lelouch on the other hand shot their documentary just after the Persepolis Celebrations in 1971. They decided to address the urban transformations and cultural emancipation that the country was subject to by the early seventies.\n\nSeveral Iranian expats such as Philippe Khorsand or Persian play writer/actor Yasmina Reza have also gained notice in recent years. The latter is particularly known for her highly intellectual introspections in such plays like \"Art\" (Sean Connery bought the film rights advised by his French wife).\n\nAlthough Iranian composers usually have their own special style and music structure, they all share one thing: melodic, lively rhythms. That might be because they often begin with folkloric songs and shift to film music. In the past few decades, a few composers have emerged in the Iranian cinema with highly appraised works. Composers like Hormoz Farhat, Morteza Hannaneh, Fariborz Lachini, Ahmad Pejman, Majid Entezami, Babak Bayat, Karen Homayounfar, Naser Cheshmazar and Hossein Alizadeh were some of the most successful score composers for Iranian films in the past decades.\n\nFilm festivals have a rather long history in Iran that goes back to the 1950s. The first \"Tehran International Film Festival\" opened in April 1973. Although the festival never reached the level of Cannes and Venice, however, it managed to become well known as a class A festival. It was a highly reputable festival and many well-known filmmakers took part in it with their films. Great filmmakers such as Francesco Rosi, Michelangelo Antonioni Grigori Kozintsev, Elizabeth Taylor, Pietro Germi, Nikita Mikhalkov, Krzysztof Zanussi, Martin Ritt won the festival's awards.\n\nThe Fajr International Film Festival has taken place since 1983. It was intended to be as magnificent and spectacular as possible from its very onset. It had a background as powerful as that of the Tehran International Film Festival and wanted to remain on the same track. Although the Fajr Film Festival is not yet classed among the top film festivals, it has been successful in making policies and setting examples for the future of Iranian cinema. In its early years it had a competition section for professional as well as amateur film (8 mm, 16 mm). Since 1990, there has been an international along with the national competition. The festival also features a competition for advertisement items like posters, stills and trailers. In 2005, the festival added competitions for Asian as well as spiritual films. The top prize is called Crystal Simorgh.\n\nIran is the current President of the Non-Aligned Movement and hosted the 16th NAM summit between 26 and 31 August 2012, after which the presidency was handed to Ahmadinejad on 1 September. The latest move by the NAM Chairman has been to organise a NAM filmmakers' meeting in order to discuss the establishment of a NAM filmmakers' union. The meeting is to be held in February 2013, concurrently with the 31st Fajr International Film Festival in Tehran.\n\nThis International Film Festival of Children and Young Adults has taken place since 1985. In its first three years, it was part of the Fajr Film Festival. From 1988 to 1989, it was located in Tehran and in 1996, it was held in Kerman. The festival features international and national film and video competitions. The top prize is called \"Golden Butterfly\".\n\nOn September 12, the national day of Iranian cinema, a celebration is held annually by the House of Cinema. In the 2006 event, Akira Kurosawa was honored.\n\nFounded in 2007, the Noor Iranian Film Festival is held annually in Los Angeles, California.\n\nIranian Film Festival - San Francisco (IFF), the first independent Iranian film festival outside of Iran, launched in 2008, is an annual event showcasing independent feature and short films made by or about Iranians from around the world.

It is the only festival in the UK that is dedicated to Iranian independent cinema, with this year's event taking place from the 1st to the 9th of November.\n\nRoshd International Film Festival was first staged in 1963 by the Bureau of Audio-visual Activities of the Ministry of Education of Iran. It is centered on the films with educational and pedagogical themes and is staged every year by the Supplying Educational Media Center, a sub-branch of the Ministry of Education of the I.R.Iran. The Festival seeks the main objectives of identifying and selecting the best educational and pedagogical films in order to introduce them to the educational systems.\n\nPersian International Film Festival is an independent cultural film event, that brings together screen stories of diverse global Persian communities.

Some Iranian films that have been internationally acclaimed are banned in Iran itself. Conversely, some Iranian filmmakers have faced hostility in other countries.\n\nDariush Mehrjui's seminal film \"Gaav\" (\"The Cow\", 1969) is now considered a pioneering work of the Iranian New Wave. The film was sponsored by the state, but they promptly banned it upon completion because its vision of rural life clashed with the progressive image of Iran that the Shah wished to project, while its prominence at international film festivals annoyed the regime.\n\nAfter the Iranian revolution, filmmakers experienced more restrictions. Since the mid-1980s, Iran's policy on film censorship has been changed in order to promote domestic film production: the strict censorship eased after December 1987. Old directors resurfaced and new ones emerged. However, the application of the rules is often inconsistent. Several films have been refused release inside Iran, but have been given export permits to enter international film festivals. Even here, the censorship is inconsistent: \"May Lady\" by Rakhshan Bani-Etemad (1998) got through but her contribution to \"Stories of Kish\" (1999) did not.\n\nAll of Jafar Panahi's films have been banned from public theaters in Iran. \"Offside\" was relegated to \"a guest slot\" at the International Fajr Film Festival. \"It was not shown as an important film\", says Panahi. \"They didn't give any value to it.\" Several of Mohsen Makhmalbaf's films are also banned in Iran. For example, \"Time of Love\" and \"The night of Zaiandeh-rood\" were banned for dealing with physical love and for raising doubts about the revolution.\nIn 2001, feminist filmmaker Tahmineh Milani who made The Hidden Half was jailed because her movie was presumed anti-revolution (against the 1979 Islamic revolution). Many Iranian and international artists and filmmakers demanded her release. After 8 days of Imprisonment, Eventually President Khatami and the Minister of Culture were able to secure her release. In \"Nargess\", Rakhshan Bani-Etemad who is a pioneer among female Iranian film directors, pushes censorship codes to the limits, questioning the morals of society, showing desperate people overwhelmed by social conditions and a couple living together without being married.\n\nAbbas Kiarostami was significantly acclaimed in Europe but the Islamic government has refused screening of his films in his own country. Kiarostami's films have been banned in his country for more than 10 years. They are only accessible there through unauthorized DVDs and private screenings. Kiarostami is uncertain what the government dislikes about his films, saying \"I think they don't understand my films and so they prevent them being shown just in case there is a message they don't want to get out.\". Despite this, Kiarostami has displayed an extraordinarily benign perspective, at least in recorded interviews: \"The government is not in my way, but it is not assisting me either. We lead our separate lives.\" Despite the censorship, Kiarostami insists on working in Iran, saying \"I think I really produce my best work in Iran.\" He believes that throughout the ages and all over the world censorship has existed in one form or another and artists have managed to live with this, saying \"Today, the most important thing is that, although there is censorship, Iranian filmmakers are doing their job and they surpass the difficulties of censorship showing and discussing many things. So why ask me about what's not in the films? It has happened many times that a filmmaker hides a weakness under the excuse of censorship but difficulties have always existed in our lifestyle and our role is to surpass them.\" The director Mohammed Rasoulof, was convicted of charges relating to state security and anti-government propaganda. In 2009 and 2013 the number of political films and drama like \"Khers\", \"Guidance Patrol\", \"The Wooden Bridge\", \"I am a Mother\" and \"Private Life\" (Zendegi Khosoosi) were Sanctioned.\n\nIn December 2011, Iran’s Council of Public Culture declared its ‘House of Cinema’, the country’s largest professional organisation for film makers, illegal. Authorities state the organization was shut down because of secret amendments to its charter. House of Cinema came under pressure when it challenged the detention of filmmakers accused of selling films to the BBC.\n\nIn September 2013, House of Cinema has been reopened by the new government.\n\nIn September 2011, House of Cinema issued a statement in support of several filmmakers detained for contact with the BBC. They questioned the legal basis for the arrests, pointing out that the government itself has contact with international news organizations. As a result, they received an official rebuke.\n\nGiven the tense relationship between Iran and the United States, Iranian filmmakers have faced hostility there, even if they have also been banned in their own country. Abbas Kiarostami was refused a visa to attend the New York Film Festival, Ohio University and Harvard University in 2002, in the wake of the September 11 attacks. Festival director Richard Pena, who had invited him, said: \"It's a terrible sign of what's happening in my country today that no one seems to realize or care about the kind of negative signal this sends out to the entire Muslim world\". Finnish film director Aki Kaurismäki boycotted the festival in protest. Similarly, Bahman Ghobadi, winner of the Golden Plaque at the Chicago International Film Festival, refused to accept the prize in protest of the U.S. government's refusal to issue him a visa. In 2007, Ahmed Issawi, the abashed Arab director of the New York South Asian Film Festival admitted that a conscious decision was made not to invite any Iranian filmmakers, saying \"That's a territory I no longer want to tread [...] It's over. Given the whole thing with Iran—I refuse to approach it.\"\n\nIn March 2007, a bomb explosion severely injuring several actors and crew members halted production in Afghanistan of \"Two Legged Horse\", the film by Iranian helmer Samira Makhmalbaf. Mohsen Makhmalbaf was the target of two unsuccessful murder attempts when he shot \"Kandahar\" in Iran near the Afghan border in 2000, and his daughter Hana was twice the victim of a failed abduction attempt during the shooting of Samira's last film \"At Five in the Afternoon\" in the Afghan capital Kabul in 2002.\n\nOn 1 March 2010, Jafar Panahi was arrested. He was taken from his home along with his wife Tahereh Saidi, daughter Solmaz Panahi, and 15 of his friends by plain-clothes officers to Evin Prison. Most were released 48 hours later, Mohammad Rasoulof and Mehdi Pourmoussa on 17 March 2010, but Panahi remained in section 209 inside Evin Prison. Panahi's arrest was confirmed by the government, but the charges were not specified.On April 14, 2010, Iran's Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance said that Panahi was arrested because he \"tried to make a documentary about the unrest that followed the disputed 2009 re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.\"On 18 May, Panahi sent a message to Abbas Baktiari, director of the Pouya Cultural Center, an Iranian-French cultural organization in Paris, stating that he was being mistreated in prison and his family threatened and as a result had begun a hunger strike. On 25 May, he was released on $200,000 bail while awaiting trial.On 20 December 2010, Panahi, after being convicted for \"assembly and colluding with the intention to commit crimes against the country’s national security and propaganda against the Islamic Republic,\" the Islamic Revolutionary Court sentenced Panahi to six years imprisonment and a 20-year ban on making or directing any movies, writing screenplays, giving any form of interview with Iranian or foreign media as well as leaving the country except for Hajj holy pilgrimage to Mecca or medical treatment. Panahi's colleague, Mohammad Rasoulof also received six years imprisonment but was later reduced to one year on appeal.On October 15, 2011, a court in Tehran upheld Panahi's sentence and ban. Following the courts decision, Panahi was placed under house arrest. He has since been allowed to move more freely but he cannot travel outside Iran.\n\nHossein Rajabian, an Iranian independent filmmaker, After finishing his first feature film, was arrested by Iranian security forces on 5 October 2013 outside his office [in Sari] alongside two musicians, and was transferred to Ward 2-A of Evin Prison where all three of them were held in solitary confinement for more than two months and were threatened with televised confessions. He was released on bail (around $66,000) in mid-December, pending trial. Two years later, his case was heard at Branch 28 of Tehran Revolutionary Court which was presided over by Judge Moghisseh (Summer 2015). He was sentenced to six years in prison and fines for pursuing illegal cinematic activities, launching propaganda against the establishment and hurling insults at sanctities. On appeal, his sentence was changed to three years imprisonment and three years of suspended jail and Fines.Hossein Rajabian was sent to the ward 7 of Evin Prison in Tehran. After spending one third of his total period of imprisonment (that is 11 months), he went on hunger strike to protest against unjust trial, lack of medical facilities, and transfer of his brother to another ward called section 8 of the same prison. During the first hunger strike period, which lasted 14 days, he was transferred to hospital because of pulmonary infection and he could not continue his hunger strike because of the interference of the representative of the prosecutor who was sent as an intermediary. After some time, he sent an open letter to the judicial authorities of Iran and went again on strike which brought him the supports of international artists. After 36 days of hunger strike, he could convince the judicial authorities of Iran to review his case and grant him medical leave for the treatment of his left kidney suffered from infections and blood arising out of hunger strike. he, after a contentious struggle with the judicial officer of the prison was sent to the ward 8 for punishment.\n\nCinemapeople in the Iranian diaspora, such as Shohreh Aghdashloo, Zuleikha Robinson, Nadia Bjorlin, Shirin Neshat, Adrian Pasdar, Amir Mokri, Bahar Soomekh, Amir Talai Catherine Bell, Nazanin Boniadi, Samira Makhmalbaf, Freema Agyeman, Sarah Shahi, Hughes brothers, Nasim Pedrad, Daryush Shokof, and Farhad Safinia are also popular.\n\nSeveral institutes, both government run and private, provide formal education in various aspects of filmmaking.

{"id": "5267987", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5267987", "title": "Cinema of Vietnam", "text": "Cinema of Vietnam\n\nThe cinema of Vietnam originates in the 1920s, and has largely been shaped by wars that have been fought in the country from the 1940s to the 1970s. Better known Vietnamese language films include \"Cyclo\", \"The Scent of Green Papaya\" and \"Vertical Ray of the Sun\", all by French-trained Việt Kiều director Tran Anh Hung. In recent years, as Vietnam's film industry has modernized and moved beyond government-backed propaganda films, contemporary Vietnamese filmmakers have gained a wider audience with films such as \"Buffalo Boy\", \"Bar Girls\", and \"The White Silk Dress\".\n\nIn the 1920s, a group of Vietnamese intellectuals formed the Huong Ky Film Company in Hanoi. It produced documentaries on the funeral of Emperor Khải Định and the enthronement of Bảo Đại. There was also the silent feature, \"Một đồng kẽm tậu được ngựa\" (\"A Penny for a Horse\").\nThe first sound films were produced from 1937 to 1940, with \"Trọn với tình\" (\"True to Love\"), \"Khúc khải hoàn\" (\"The Song of Triumph\") and \"Toét sợ ma\" (\"Toét's Scared of Ghosts\") by the Asia Film Group studio in Hanoi with the participation of artist Tám Danh. The Vietnam Film Group, led by Trần Tấn Giàu produced \"Một buổi chiều trên sông Cửu Long\" (\"An Evening on the Mekong River\") and \"Thầy Pháp râu đỏ\" (\"The Red-Bearded Sorcerer\").\n\nTwo other films, \"Cánh đồng ma\" (\"The Ghost Field\") and \"Trận phong ba\" (\"The Storm\"), were made in 1937 and 1938 in Hong Kong with Vietnamese actors and dialogue, but both were financial failures.\n\nThe government's Ministry of Information and Propaganda formed a film department around 1945 and documented battles in the First Indochina War in the documentaries \"Trận Mộc Hóa\" (\"Mộc Hóa Battle\") in 1948, \"Trận Đông Khê\" (\"Đông Khê Battle\") in 1950 \"Chiến thắng Tây Bắc\" (\"North West Victory\") in 1952, \"Việt Nam trên đường thắng lợi\" (\"Việt Nam on the Road to Victory\") in 1953 and \"Dien Bien Phu\" (1954).\n\nWith the end of the First Indochina War and the creation of North Vietnam and South Vietnam, there were two Vietnamese film industries, with the Hanoi industry focusing on documentary and drama films and Saigon on war or comedy films.\n\nHanoi's Vietnam Film Studio was established in 1956 and the Hanoi Film School opened in 1959. The first feature film produced in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was a nationalistic work directed by Nguyễn Hồng Nghị, \"Chung một giòng sông\" (\"Together on the Same River\"). There was even an animated feature, \"Đáng đời Thằng Cáo\" (\"A Just Punishment for the Fox\") in 1960.\n\nDocumentaries and feature films from Hanoi attracted attention at film festivals in Eastern Europe at the time. The documentary \"Nước về Bắc Hưng Hải\" (\"Water Returns to Bắc Hưng Hải\") won the Golden Award at the 1959 Moscow Film Festival, and the 1963 feature by Phạm Kỳ Nam, \"Chị Tư Hậu\" (\"Sister Tư Hậu\") won the Silver Award at Moscow. It starred lead actress Trà Giang.\n\nBut mostly the Hanoi-based industry focused on documenting the Vietnam War. Between 1965 and 1973, 463 newsreels, 307 documentaries and 141 scientific films were produced, in contrast to just 36 feature films and 27 cartoons. Films during this period include the documentaries \"Du kích Củ Chi\" (\"Củ Chi Guerillas\") in 1967 and \"Lũy thép Vĩnh Linh\" (\"Vĩnh Linh Steel Rampart\") in 1970, which included footage from battles. Other films, such as \"Đường ra phía trước\" (\"The Road to the Front\") in 1969 and \"Những người săn thú trên núi Dak-sao\" (\"Hunters on Dak-sao Mountain\") in 1971 were docudramas.\n\nFeature films from this time include \"Nguyễn Văn Trỗi\" (1966), \"Đường về quê mẹ\" (\"Road Back to Mother\") (1971), \"Truyện vợ chồng Anh Lực\" (\"The Story of Anh Lực and his Wife\") in 1971, and \"Em bé Hà Nội\" (\"Girl from Hanoi\") in 1975.\n\nSaigon produced numerous documentary and public information films, as well as feature films. The most well known feature film of the late 1950s was \"Chúng Tôi Muốn Sống\" (We Want To Live), a realistic depiction of the bloody land reform campaign in North Vietnam under Communist-dominated Vietminh. Some mid-1960s black-and-white features dealt with war themes, with actors such as Đoàn Châu Mậu and La Thoại Tân. Some later popular color features revolved around the theme of family or personal tragedy in a war-torn society, such as \"Người Tình Không Chân Dung\" (The Faceless Lover) starring Kiều Chinh, \"Xa Lộ Không Đèn\" (Dark Highway) starring Thanh Nga, \"Chiếc Bóng Bên Đường\" (A Silhouette by the Road) starring Kim Cương and Thành Được. Comedy movies were usually released around Tết, the Vietnamese New Year; most notable was \"Triệu Phú Bất Đắc Dĩ\" (The Reluctant Millionaire) starring the well-loved comedian Thanh Việt.\n\nJoseph Mankiewicz's adaptation of Graham Greene's \"The Quiet American\" was filmed in and around Saigon in 1957. American actor Marshall Thompson directed and starred in \"A Yank in Vietnam\", or \"Year of the Tiger\" in 1964.\n\nAfter Reunification of North Vietnam and South Vietnam, studios in the former South Vietnam turned to making Socialist Realism films. Vietnamese feature film output increased and by 1978 the number of feature films made each year was boosted from around three annually during the war years to 20.\n\nFilms from the years following the war focused on heroic efforts in the revolution, human suffering created by the war and social problems of post-war reconstruction. Films from this time include \"Mùa gió chướng\" (\"Season of the Whirlwind\") in 1978 and \"Cánh đồng hoang\" (\"The Abandoned Field: Free Fire Zone\") in 1979.\n\nThe shift to a market economy in 1986 dealt a blow to Vietnamese filmmaking, which struggled to compete with video and television. The number of films produced in Vietnam has dropped off sharply since 1987.\n\nStill, a number of filmmakers continued to produce film that would be seen on the arthouse circuit. These include Trần Văn Thủy's \"Hà Nội trong mắt ai?\" (\"Hanoi Through Whose Eyes?\", 1983) and \"Chuyện tử tế\" (\"Story of Good Behavior\", 1987) and Trần Anh Trà's \"Người công giáo huyện Thống Nhất\" (\"A Catholic in Thống Nhất District\", 1985), Trần Vũ's \"Anh và em\" (\"Siblings\", 1986), Ðặng Nhật Minh's \"Cô gái trên sông\" (\"Girl on the River\", 1987), Nguyển Khắc Lợi's \"Tướng về hưu\" (\"The Retired General\") and Ðặng Nhật Minh's \"Mùa ổi\" (\"Guava Season\", 2001).\n\nTony Bui's \"Ba mùa\" (\"Three Seasons\", 1998) won prizes at the Sundance Film Festival in 1998. Trần Văn Thủy's \"Tiếng vĩ cầm ở Mỹ Lai\" (\"The Sound of the Violin at My Lai\") won Best Short Film prize at the 43rd Asia Pacific Film Festival in 1999. \"Đời cát\" (\"Sandy Life\") by Nguyễn Thanh won best picture at the same festival the following year. Bùi Thạc Chuyên's \"Cuốc xe đêm\" (\"Night Cyclo Trip\") won third prize in the short film category at the Cannes Film Festival in 2000.\n\nBetter known, however, are European productions in Vietnam, such as \"The Lover\" and \"Indochine\", as well as films by Việt Kiều directors Tran Anh Hung and Tony Bui. Tran's first feature, \"The Scent of the Green Papaya\" won the Golden Camera at the Cannes Film Festival in 1993 and was the first Vietnamese film nominated for an Oscar in 1994. His other films include \"Xích lô\" (\"Cyclo\", 1995) and \"Mùa hè chiều thẳng đứng\" (\"Vertical Ray of the Sun\") in 2000. Another European co-production, \"Mùa len trâu\" (\"The Buffalo Boy\") by Nguyễn Võ Nghiêm Minh, has won numerous awards at film festivals, including the Chicago International Film Festival in 2004.\n\nIn recent years, Vietnamese filmmakers have moved in more commercial directions to try and regain audiences lost to television and DVDs. One of the most successful films of recent years at the Vietnamese box office has been Phi Tiến Sơn's \"Lưới trời\" (\"Heaven's Net\"), a film about corruption that closely mirrors the trial of Ho Chi Minh City gangster Nam Cam.\n\nAn even bigger film was 2002's Lê Hoàng's \"Gai nhay\" (\"Bar Girls\"), which depicted Ho Chi Minh City's titillating and seedy nightlife while also warning of the dangers of HIV and AIDS. Featuring the first government-approved topless scene, it spawned a sequel, \"Lọ lem hè phố\" (\"Street Cinderella\") in 2004. Another film along these lines is \"Nữ tướng cướp\" (\"Gangsta Girls\"). There are also comedy-romance films, such as \"Hon Truong Ba Da Hang Thit\" (\"Truong Ba's Soul in Butcher's Body\") in 2006 and \"Khi dan ong co bau\" (\"When Men Get Pregnant\") from 2004.\n\nViệt Linh has made several critically acclaimed films.\n\nIn 2007, \"Muoi\" (\"Muoi: the Legend of a Portrait\"), the first horror film in Vietnam after the Fall of Saigon (collaborated by Korean producers) also became the first rated film with an under-16 ban.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13612929", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13612929", "title": "Cinephilia", "text": "Cinephilia\n\nCinephilia (; also cinemaphilia or filmophilia) is the term used to refer to a passionate interest in films, film theory, and film criticism. The term is a portmanteau of the words cinema and philia, one of the four ancient Greek words for love. A person with a passionate interest in cinema is called a cinephile (), cinemaphile, filmophile, or, informally, a film buff (also movie buff).\n\nIn English, \"cinephile\" is sometimes used interchangeably with the word cineaste (), though in the original French the term \"cinéaste\" () refers to a cinephile who is also a filmmaker.\n\nIn a review of a book on the history of cinephilia, Mas Generis writes: \"Cinephilia, is the condition of a sexual attraction to movies.\" Generis also introduces a quote from film scholar Annette Michelson that states that there is, \"No one such thing as cinephilia, but rather forms and periods of cinephilia.\" As described by Antoine de Baecque and Thierry Frémaux, \"The definitive essence of cinephila is a culture of the discarded that prefers to find intellectual coherence where none is evident and to eulogize the non-standard and the minor.\"\n\nFilm historian Thomas Elsaesser wrote that it \"reverberates with nostalgia and dedication... more than a passion of going to the movies and only a little less than an entire attitude towards life\".\n\nSince the beginning of the silent era, there have been film clubs and publications in which people who felt passionately about cinema could discuss their interests and see rare and older works. At the beginning of the sound era, there were more and more people interested in seeing older films, which led to the establishment of organizations such as the Cinémathèque Française, the first major archive devoted to film preservation.\n\nPerhaps the most notable cinephilic community of the 20th century was the one that developed in Paris in the decades following World War II. An influx of foreign films that had been withheld during the Occupation, as well as the screening programs of local film clubs and the Cinémathèque Française, generated interest in world cinema amongst the city's intellectual youth culture. In general, the cinephiles of the period set a template for future like-minded groups by having keen enthusiasm for both older and contemporary films.\n\nInfluential film clubs of the period included Objectif 49, whose members included Robert Bresson and Jean Cocteau, and the Ciné-Club du Quartier Latin (Cinema Club of the Latin Quarter). \"Revue du Cinéma\", a magazine published by members of the two clubs, later evolved into the influential film magazine \"Cahiers du Cinéma\".\n\nMany of the people who attended the screenings became film critics and later filmmakers, founding the film movement known as the French New Wave. André Bazin, François Truffaut, Jacques Doniol-Valcroze, Claude Chabrol, Jean-Luc Godard, Alexandre Astruc, Jacques Rivette, Luc Moullet and others were regulars, and several, most notably Truffaut, maintained their ties to the community after they had achieved fame.\n\nThe community fostered an interest in directors and films that had been neglected, forgotten or simply unknown in the West, and led to the development of the auteur theory. The directors the French cinephiles of the period had strong interests in included F. W. Murnau, Robert Flaherty, Sergei Eisenstein, Jean Renoir, Jean Vigo, Orson Welles, Anthony Mann, Louis Feuillade, D. W. Griffith, the Lumière Brothers, Alfred Hitchcock and Georges Méliès, whose films would be screened from nitrate prints on special occasions.\n\nWith the popular success of the French New Wave, film-going became fashionable in Europe and America. Revival screenings and independently run cinemas specializing in foreign films became increasingly common. In the United States, New York City was often seen as the center of cinephile culture, due to the wide variety of films available to see at any given time. This culture was also helped by the popularity in America of figures such like Pauline Kael, Andrew Sarris and Susan Sontag. Certain writers and critics, including Sontag, would later come to view this as the \"golden age\" of film-going in the US. Directors such as Ingmar Bergman, Akira Kurosawa, Michelangelo Antonioni and Federico Fellini enjoyed a great deal of popularity in the US and influenced the young generation of film enthusiasts who would become the New Hollywood, including Martin Scorsese, Peter Bogdanovich, Francis Ford Coppola and Woody Allen. Due to growing public interest in films from other countries, specialty distributors such as Janus Films and New Yorker Films began importing and subtitling foreign movies.\n\nThe era also saw the growth of college film societies in the US. Though some, like Doc Films at the University of Chicago, had existed since the 1930s, the 1960s saw directors of all generations regularly make appearances at college campuses, whether to revisit their old films or to discuss new ones.\n\nAt the same time, the Parisian cinephilic culture became increasingly politicized. Critics, and by extension the cinephiles who followed their work, began to emphasize political aspects of films and directors. Though many of the major figures of the post-war community has been originally aligned with the political right—including most of the \"Cahiers du Cinéma\" group—by the late 1960s \"Cahiers\" and the young cinephile public in general had aligned with various forms of the Left, with some figures, such as Jean-Luc Godard, aligning with Maoism. In this very politicized climate, cinema was often seen as directly connected to Marxism. Many members of this new generation of cinephiles would become critics and directors, including Serge Daney, Philippe Garrel, and Andre Techine.\n\nThough most of the world's major film festivals had existed for decades by this point—including the Berlin International Film Festival, the Cannes Film Festival and the Venice Film Festival—the period saw the establishment of festivals in nearly every major city. The New York Film Festival, the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival and the Chicago International Film Festival were all started during this time. The Toronto International Film Festival, often seen as second only to the Cannes Film Festival in terms of importance, was founded towards the end of this period, in 1976.\n\nAs VHS tapes and later DVDs became more common, cinephilia became less associated with filmgoing in theatres.\n\nWhile Japanese films have enjoyed worldwide distribution in the mid 20th century, the late 20th century saw an increase in interest amongst cinephiles in cinema from other Asian countries, especially China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and, later, Thailand.\n\nSince the beginning of the 21st century, blogging has become a large part of cinephile culture. In the English-speaking world, established critics and theorists like Dave Kehr, David Bordwell, Jonathan Rosenbaum, Glenn Kenny, Wheeler Winston Dixon and Adrian Martin, as well as non-professional cinephiles like Girish Shambu and Acquarello, play key roles in building interest in films or theories amongst cinephiles by writing and communicating through blogs. Forums and podcasts have become popular ways to stir discussion, allowing cinephiles from different countries and cultures to discuss ideas about film. The social networking and video streaming service Mubi caters specifically to cinephiles, allowing its members access to films that sometimes haven't been distributed theatrically or on video in their home countries. Home video distribution labels such as The Criterion Collection and Masters of Cinema cater to cinephiles, often including large amounts of supplemental and critical material with their releases.\n\nAs was the case with the French cinephilia of the post-war era, the international cinephilic community that has developed on the Internet often emphasizes films and figures that do not have strong critical or popular recognition, including many directors who work within genre film, in what is sometimes dubbed vulgar auteurism. These include Abel Ferrara, Bela Tarr, Michael Mann, Apichatpong Weerasethakul, Park Chan-wook, Kiyoshi Kurosawa, Philippe Garrel, Pedro Costa, Lucrecia Martel and Jose Luis Guerin.\n\nThroughout the history of cinema, there have been numerous directors who developed their understanding of cinema through filmgoing and participation in cinephile communities and organizations instead of within the formal settings of either a film school or a film studio. Directors who began as cinephiles include Jean-Luc Godard, Claude Chabrol, François Truffaut, Satyajit Ray, Quentin Tarantino, Jacques Rivette, Ed Wood, Andre Techine, Pedro Costa, Brian de Palma, Jim Jarmusch, Paul Thomas Anderson, Wim Wenders, Wes Anderson, Éric Rohmer, Hal Hartley and Aki Kaurismäki.\n\nThe directors of the French New Wave, who learned about filmmaking by attending screenings at film clubs and discussing movies amongst themselves, are often seen as models for cinephiles. Their intellectual omnivorousness, which equated an interest in cinema with strong understandings of literature, art and sometimes philosophy, has continued to have influence on cinephiles. \n\nOn the other hand, many directors emphasize their lack of cinephilia or interest in movies. Abbas Kiarostami, popular with cinephiles, often emphasized his disinterest in cinema when interviewed.\n\nThere has also been different forms of \"cinephobia\" (fear or hatred of cinema) from the current fear of \"losing\" celluloid film in the digital age through anxieties about moral values on the big screen to the point of censorship. \n\nTelephilia is the term used to refer to a passionate interest in television.\n\nIt was coined by \"The New York Times\" critic Frank Rich, in a pejorative way, as \"the pathological longing of Americans, no matter how talentless, to be on television\".\n\nFor years, television was frowned upon as inferior to film until the advent of quality television in the 1980s when recording and reproduction technologies allowed the spectator to release his/her viewing from the palimpsest's rigidity. \n\nAnti-heroic series like \"The Sopranos\" and \"The Wire\" were cited as improving television content thus earning critical praise. \n\nIt also rivals cinephilia for relevance as production values are higher than ever before on shows such as \"Mad Men\", \"Breaking Bad\" and \"Homeland\". Despite this development, there are still intellectuals who consider telephilia as inferior to cinephilia particularly in cases of obsessions for modern television programs belonging to genres such as melodrama and soap opera. This is also explained by the view that highlighted the unattainable nature of the cinema, which makes it more desirable and extraordinary since it features a regime of presence-yet-absence filmic image, allowing a form of cinematic stardom capable of triggering a series of psychic mechanisms. This is contrasted with television, which is perceived to be more present and immediate - with its stars \"famous only in so far as he or she makes frequent television appearances.\" Some observers, however, note that there is now a destabilization of traditional notions of what constitutes cinephilic tendency due to the availability of film on home media technology.\n\n"}

This means that they are free to talk to their colleagues in the booth, and also the Stage management team and other crew members via the communications headset. A booth that is sealed to the auditorium also allows for noisier equipment to be used, in particular computers and computer-based lighting desks, which require built-in fans in order to work properly. The downside to having a sealed booth is that it can be difficult for the sound engineer to mix without being able to hear what is happening on stage. In this situation a separate table may be set up in the house for the sound engineer.\n\nIn some smaller theatres, and school halls control booths can sometimes be found above or at the side of the stage. This allows space at the back of the auditorium for more seating, or a better/larger foyer area.\nIn older theatres, this is because before the advent of thyristor dimming and compact electronic control desks, there was a limit on the distance that lighting controls could be placed away from the dimmers.\n\nIn some theatres, the control booth is divided into a suite of rooms, allowing each of the technical elements of a production its own customized space. This is especially likely to be the case where a theatre produces performances which require live sound mixing rather than just pre-recorded effects, as a sound operator needs to be able to hear the sound in the auditorium, and so not be sealed from it as a lighting operator, followspot operator or projectionist might be. In some theatres with one or more balconies, the followspots may be given their own room above the highest balcony, with the lighting booth typically lower down at the rear of the stalls or the first balcony.\n\nIn rare cases; such as low budget theatres or ones at small or older schools, the control booth is not enclosed as its own space, rather it is part of the seating house. This however, is a setup that is almost never used because it hinders the possibility of the technician team to effectively communicate to the backstage area without disrupting the performance.\n\nThe booth contains a variety of equipment used in the production of theatrical performances. Although booths vary greatly from venue to venue, most booths contain a light board, and sometimes a sound board. Most control booths have at least one intercom headset used for communication with the backstage crew during performances.

The CCB's 140,000 m² spaces was initially built to accommodate the European Presidency, but adapted to provide spaces for conferences, exhibitions and artistic venues (such as opera, ballet and symphony concerts), in addition to political and research congresses, high security meeting halls, and a 7,000 m² exhibition area.\n\nThe decision to construct the Cultural Centre of Belém occurred in January 1988, as part of the Portuguese government's need to construct a building to welcome and accommodate the people involved in Portugal's European Union Presidency (in 1992). The facility would also serve as a core facility for cultural and leisure activities after its term, and serve as a venue for conferences and exhibitions.\n\nAn international architectural competition was held and six proposals were invited to submit a preliminary project, out of the 57 submissions. The final proposal, submitted by the architectural consortium of Vittorio Gregotti (Italy) and Atelier Risco at the time led by Manuel Salgado (Portugal), was designed to include five modules: a Conference Centre, a Performing Arts Centre, an Exhibition Centre, Hotel and complementary equipment zone, but only the Conference Centre, the Performing Arts Centre and the Exhibition Centre were initially constructed.\n\nStarting in July 1989, the buildings along the waterfront were demolished and many of the infrastructures were reestablished. By January 1992, modules 1, 2 and 3 were completed and ready to accommodate the institutions, administration, communication centre and security of the European Union Presidency. A year later the Conference Centre and small auditorium (March) and later the Exhibition Centre were opened to the public. By fall of the same year (September), the main auditorium was inaugurated.\n\nThe building is located in Santa Maria de Belém, near the riverfront west of Lisbon, between the dual Avenida da Índia-Avenida de Brasília motorway and \"Rua Bartolomeu Dias\". Apart from fronting the \"Praça do Império\" (\"Imperial Square\"), it juxtopositions the Jerónimos Monastery, and is surrounded by many historical buildings, such as the Palace and the \nTower of Belém, the Museum of Archaeology, the Planetarium, the Monument to the Discoveries.\n\nThe Belém Cultural Centre has 140,000 m² of construction area and was prepared in a very short period (1989–1992). The client of the project was the Portuguese State through the \"Secretaria de Estado da Cultura\" (State Agency for Culture). Completed in 1992, it occupies a total of 100,000 m² and is the work of architects Vittorio Gregotti and Manuel Salgado; the interior was planned by Daciano Costa.\n\nIts designed, aligned with the Jerónimos' Monastery, intentionally fronts the Império Square, and consists of structural blocks with courtyards and \"patio-squares\" that interconnect the three principal structures. Each centre is separated by transversal \"streets\", that link the building's interiors which are extensions of the city of Lisbon's historical urban structure. The centrality of the main building extends the urban fabric to the interior creating a public space. This architectural style can best be interpreted by Santana and Matos (2010) who refer to as the \"\"patios-squares\" versus the \"narrow streets\"\" a conflicting dynamic structure.\n\nWith highly sophisticated equipment and a wide variety of installed services, it has several areas with different roles:\n\nThe Cultural Centre of Belém won the International Stone Architecture Award at the Verona Fair in 1993.\n\nIt has already hosted important events like the summit meeting of the Heads of State of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "897219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=897219", "title": "Dark Reign: The Future of War", "text": "Dark Reign: The Future of War\n\nDark Reign: The Future of War is a real-time strategy video game for Microsoft Windows, developed by Auran and published by Activision in 1997. The game consists of a large single-player campaign but also supports multiplayer online games. A mission construction kit is included with the game, that allows players to create new maps for multiplayer game and create entire missions and campaigns.\n\nAn expansion pack, \"\", was released on March 31, 1998, which added new missions and new units to the game.\n\nA prequel, \"Dark Reign 2\", was released on June 30, 2000.\n\nThe game takes place in the distant future. The player takes the role of a survivor of a faction of humans known as the Tograns, whose society was decimated after their homeworld became engulfed in the civil war between the Freedom Guard and the Imperium (who were once both the Sprawlers and the Jovian Detention Authority (JDA) from \"Dark Reign 2\" respectively). As one of the last remaining Tograns that set off in hopes they might find a new refuge to rebuild and carry on the words of Alpheus Togra (a famous research scientist and philosopher), the player is presented with an opportunity to go back through time and prevent the death of the founder, Togra, using an advanced probe launched by him just prior to the destruction of the planet Strata-7. To use the device, the player must first demonstrate their worth by achieving victory in simulations of famous battles between the Imperium and the Freedom Guard.\n\nThe thirteen missions play out the events from the first skirmish between the Imperium and Freedom Guard up to the battle for and destruction of Strata-7. The missions may freely be played from the perspective of the Imperium or the Freedom Guard. In the thirteenth and final mission, the last Togran, the player, is sent back in time using the Chronomachine to Strata-7, and must use the weapons and technology of both the Imperium and the Freedom Guard to combine a force that will defeat both sides and prevent the complete destruction of Strata-7 and the death of Togra.\n\nIn the expansion, \"Rise of the Shadowhand\", the story depicts the increasing desperation and despotism of the Imperium after the emergence of the Tograns as a third credible faction. After a massive Imperium assault on Freedom Guard space, a fleeing transport stumbles upon a planet, at the other side of the galaxy, where the Imperium secret police, the Shadowhand, have conducted major research. By coincidence, the Shadowhand simultaneously is faced with losing control of its advanced units due to the malfunction of their guiding AI, Osiris.\n\nThe gameplay is that of a sci-fi real-time strategy, similar to that of \"Command & Conquer\". In any given scenario, the player first constructs buildings for unit production, resource gathering, power generation and base defense. The production of units and buildings represent an opportunity cost as they all have an associated cost in terms of credits (the currency used by the game). Additional credits are earned by collecting shipments of water from fresh springs, while additional power can be generated by harvesting Taleon. Water and Taleon are the only two resources collected during gameplay. These resource deposits continuously regenerate and can never be completely exhausted, however, when depletion occurs, resource accumulation from these sources takes longer. In a special case, the complete destruction of water sources can be forced through the use of the Water Contamination Unit as part of resource-denial strategy. During short games, it is advised to assert control over as many water deposits as possible to ensure a strong income in financing attacks and base defenses. In longer games, this strategy is extended to protecting and maintaining supply routes as it takes longer to derive the same amount of profit.\n\nThe two sides have completely unique units and strategies, unlike many contemporary games. Freedom Guard units are characterized as being weaker but more mobile, being faster and better able to handle difficult terrain. As such, these units specialize in lightning strikes and ambushes and are useful in harassing enemy units and supply lines. Imperium units rely on strength and numbers to overwhelm their enemies. Although their units are usually slower when compared to Freedom Guard counterparts, they are able to outmatch Freedom Guard units with increased armor and firepower. Furthermore, Imperium units have a greater reliance on hover technology, which limits their use in extreme terrain but allows them to easily cross natural water barriers. Freedom Guard technology relies on hiding their units through use of technology called phasing. Phasing allows units to quickly hide underground, making them effective for close-quarters ambushes. The Imperium are directed more towards a blitzkrieg style of play, with units focused on supremacy in combat ahead of tactical flexibility. Freedom Guard units are geared more towards an anti-armor role, especially to counter Imperium armor superiority, while the Imperium utilize more anti-infantry weapons to negate Freedom Guard infantry advantages.\n\nPlayers can steal technology from other players, thus negating specific unit advantages and specialty. In order to do this, the player uses an espionage unit called the Infiltrator to steal weapon designs from an enemy Headquarters, the building tasked with producing construction rigs. Once the plans have been successfully stolen, the infiltrator unit is then directed back to the player's HQ to incorporate the new technology in their production options. The Infiltrator may steal as many weapon designs as possible while in the enemy headquarters but risks being exposed the longer the unit stays.\n\nIn the campaign missions, the player is given a number of objectives that must be met before victory can be achieved. These victory conditions follow the historical scenario being replayed - for example, a given mission might require the player, as the Freedom Guard, to evacuate or protect a particular unit or structure, or as the Imperium, to destroy those units or prevent their escape.\n\n\"Dark Reign\" possesses a complex fog-of-war where line of sight is affected by varying terrain height and shape. This allows for the use of forests for ambushes and limits the effectiveness of recon in densely forested or mountainous areas. Like many RTS titles, structures in the game consume power and do not function if sufficient power is unavailable. Players can 'power down' buildings to keep their bases online, giving greater flexibility in base management. The game also features production queues, and where multiple production facilities of the same type exist, they automatically divide up production, or can be ordered to each focus on particular production queues.\n\nA player can place any number of paths, each with any number of points, and save each one with a unique name. Units on a path can be assigned to patrol it, loop, or travel it once, and units automatically carry out behaviours at each point - for example, a resource collector can be given a path to take it around an enemy base to a water deposit and it will treat this route as its standard resource gathering path. Separate from waypoints, units can be given individual orders such as \"search and destroy\", \"harass\", or \"scout\", allowing them to choose their own targets, engaging and occupying the enemy while freeing up the player to work on more significant strategies or development. These tactics can be controlled further with the use of individually customisable AI settings for every unit, allowing the player to set unit pursuit range, damage tolerance (how quickly the unit will seek healing / repairs and flee combat), and independence (how far the unit will stray from orders in order to engage attackers or targets of opportunity). These can be set individually for every unit, and the default setting can be changed, eliminating the need to change every unit if a unified strategy calls for particular settings.\n\n\"Dark Reign\" began life as a game called \"Corporation: Offworld\". Developed by Auran's co-founder Greg Lane, \"Corporation: Offworld\" and its sister game entitled \"Wild West\" were demonstrated to Activision in June 1996 and a deal signed shortly thereafter. Auran continued development of the Tactics Engine under Greg Lane while Activision layered a new story on top of \"Corporation: Offworld\" and \"Dark Reign\" was born. Many of the units, and the unit AI, innovative tile-blending system, map systems, production systems and real time line of sight were already present in \"Corporation: Offworld\" when it was first demonstrated to Activision in 1996.\n\nOn January 23, 2013, Magnetar Games released \"Dark Reign Redux\", an adapted port of the original \"Dark Reign\", on Xbox Live Indie Games. The projected originally started as a fan remake, until it got licensed and approved by Activison. The game contains all twelve missions of the main game.\nIt looks to be later taken down by Magnetar Games as the result of licensing negotiations.\n\nThe Construction Kit shipped with the game allows the creation of anything from multiplayer / skirmish maps to full-fledged campaigns. Tools supplied with it allow for custom-created AI profiles to be created easily and scripted events to be implemented. As a result, there was a large community and several mods, including total conversions such as 'Edge Of Darkness', which added two new races and a host of new units and strategies.\n\n\"Dark Reign: Rise of the Shadowhand\" was released on March 31, 1998. The expansion includes a new campaign, along with new maps and terrains. It also features two new sides, Xenite and Shadowhand, resulting in a total of four playable factions. Each of the new factions contain its own unique units and buildings which expand upon what was available via the original factions, with the Shadowhand including and expanding upon Imperium units and buildings from the original game, and with the Xenite do the same for the Freedom Guard.\n\n\"Battles of the Outer Rim\" was released in 1998. It was developed by Macmillan Digital Publishing USA. It includes six single player missions, 79 multiplayer maps and a searchable map browser.\n\n\"Dark Reign\" was a commercial success. In the United States alone, \"Dark Reign\" sold 78,600 units by the end of 1997.\n\n"}

{"id": "14234559", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14234559", "title": "EMI 2001", "text": "EMI 2001\n\nThe EMI 2001 Broadcast studio camera was an early, very successful British made Plumbicon studio camera that included the lens within the body of the camera. Four 30 mm tubes allowed one tube to be dedicated solely to producing a relatively high resolution monochrome signal, with the other three tubes each providing red, green or blue signals. Even though semiconductors were used in most of the camera, the highly sensitive head amplifiers still used thermionic valves in the first generation of the design.\n\nIntegrating the lens within the body of the camera had both positive and negative effects. On the positive side, it meant the optical nodal point of the camera was close to the centre of gravity, which could make operation easier and more instinctive when used on movable camera mounts such as pedestals. The downside was that lens manufacturers were limited to which lenses they could adapt to fit to the camera. This made the 2001 less attractive for outside broadcasts.\n\nThe 2001 was both heavy and large. The pull-out handles at each corner needed four people to safely move the camera with the lens in place. It also required a separate remote camera control unit and the cable connecting the two was over 2 inches thick. The standard servo-controlled studio zoom lens had a 5 to 50° horizontal angle of view, with a minimum focus distance of either 36 inches (J type) or 18 inches (K type).\n\nFirst produced in 1966, by the early 1970s almost all of BBC Television's studios and many outside broadcast (OB) units were equipped with the 2001. Several ITV companies purchased or leased the camera including Thames Television, Yorkshire Television, Associated Television/Central Independent Television, Granada, HTV, Anglia and London Weekend Television. Independent outfits such as the early cable television stations Rediffusion Cablevision, Sheffield Cablevision and the educational television arm of the Inner London Education Authority also purchased the camera.\n\nAlthough there was no predicted lifespan for the camera, the heavy hot-running four-tube design was considered somewhat outdated even when it was new, which contributed to the camera's near-total failure to sell to broadcasters outside the UK. Furthermore, when EMI closed-down the Broadcast Equipment Division in the late 1970s, studios were deprived of technical and spares support for their cameras. Consequently, several ITV companies began replacing them in the late-1970s with the last commercial operators (Thames & Central) both phasing them out in 1986 (in the main, Central had disposed of them in 1984, however they were used for continuity and presentation from their Birmingham operation until 1986). However the BBC kept a number of such cameras in operation at BBC Television Centre, their various regional outposts and their BBC Elstree Centre for some years afterwards, the last being at Elstree until July 1991; they were kept running by \"cannibalising\" identical cameras left behind by Central when the BBC purchased Elstree from them in 1984 as well as BBC EMI 2001s disposed of in previous years.\n\nIn 1963, prior to the development of the 2001, an experimental four tube camera was constructed by EMI engineers. This experimental camera had been inspired by RCA's new four tube camera, the TK-42, and used the same tube arrangement, i.e. a 4½ inch image Orthicon tube in the luminance channel and three 1” Vidicon tubes in the colour channels. In addition, the experimental camera had an integrally mounted Varotal III zoom lens. It was demonstrated to the BBC in 1964 where it received a mixed reception. Pictures from the camera had disappointing colorimetry, but sharp luminance detail.\n\nA production version of this camera was planned, the EMI 2000, but this camera was never built. Instead, EMI opted to use the newly available Plumbicon tubes supplied by Philips, in its new camera, the EMI 2001. After successful trials, production quantities of this camera became available only just in time for the launch of the BBC's colour television service, in 1967. (The BBC also purchased cameras from other suppliers, namely the Marconi Mk VII four-tube cameras, which were used in the weather, news and presentation studios in Television Centre, and Philips' LDK3 three-tube cameras mainly used for outside broadcasts).\nWhen sold abroad, the EMI 2001 was carried under the Thomson SA brand – hence \"Thomson TH.T 2001\". How this came about is unknown as EMI and Thomson SA did not have business links.\n\nThe Thomson 2001's, like the EMI's, also used Plumbicons; however, due to a brochure which was printed in French, it was presumed that they used Vidicon tubes. But, apart from the silver viewfinder squares (instead of white) and the brand name change on the front and sides, the cameras were the same.\n\nIn the United States, the cameras were marketed by International Video Corporation as the IVC/EMI 2001-B (four tubes), with another version, the IVC/EMI 2001-C, consisting of three tubes. Only one U.S. station is known to have purchased the 2001: WSNS-TV in Chicago, in the early years of its operation.\n\nEMI engineers visited the United States in 1963, in order to view RCA's new four-tube colour camera, the TK42. Immediately following this visit, EMI Research Labs. embarked on a program to build an experimental camera using the same format. The construction took only six weeks of intensive effort, aided by the cannibalization of parts from existing EMI cameras. Items were taken from an EMI Type 203 image Orthicon monochrome studio camera, for the luminance channel, and a Type 204 industrial colour camera, for the colour channels. This camera contained 3 Vidicon tubes and a colour-splitting system using plate glass dichroic mirrors. In addition, a Varotal III zoom lens was integrated into the body of the experimental camera. The camera was housed in a simple box-shaped structure with ribs of extruded aluminium and with plain side panels.\nThe experimental camera was demonstrated to the BBC in 1963 where it received a mixed reception. At that time, the BBC was evaluating an early Philips 3-tube camera which used some newly available Plumbicon pick-up tubes. It had been set up by BBC engineers to give highly saturated colour pictures and they were unimpressed by the 'tinted' pictures of the EMI camera. \nIn order to better judge the performance of the then existing cameras, the BBC organized comparison tests between the experimental EMI camera, a Philips camera, and a Marconi three I.O. camera. In these tests, the colorimetry of the pictures from the EMI camera compared unfavourably with the other two, but it did give the sharpest pictures.\n\nIn spite of the BBC’s lukewarm reception of the experimental camera EMI persisted with the 4-tube concept, but now using Plumbicon tubes, as suggested by Wood although there was some delay before the work started. There were several reasons for the delay. Firstly, EMI’s board hesitated to provide the financial investment needed for the project. Secondly, there was indecision regarding where to place the work but, eventually, the Colour TV Department of the Research Labs. was chosen in preference to the Broadcast Equipment Division (the existing supplier of EMI's monochrome cameras and studio equipment). Thirdly, there was concern regarding the reliability of supply of Plumbicon tubes, as Philips was the only supplier. Fourthly, there were concerns regarding the variable quality standards of the early Plumbicon pick-up tubes, as some tubes were found to produce unstable pictures. Although most issues with tube quality were quickly resolved by Philips, there remained concerns regarding 'comet tails' and 'blooming'.\n\nAfter the EMI board granted approval for the new camera, in late 1964, work on it progressed rapidly. The camera was to use four Plumbicon pick-up tubes, to use solid state circuitry, include a zoom lens as standard and to use prism optics. After the late start, the first fully operational prototype was shown to the BBC and others in 1966, only just in time to meet BBC time-scales for the introduction of their new colour service.\n\nEarly cameras used thermionic valves (vacuum tubes) in the first stages of the head amplifiers but later FET amplifiers were introduced, such cameras being designated type 2001/1. All other circuitry in the cameras, apart from the pick-up tubes, was solid state.\n\nSales of the Type 2001 were very successful in the UK. The BBC and many of the independent TV companies installed the cameras in their studios during the rapid expansion of the UK colour services after 1967. However, by the time EMI had fulfilled its UK orders (towards the end of the decade), the boom in the US market had been missed and the European market had yet to fully develop or was already dominated by Philips cameras. In addition, rival companies were already bringing out new designs and EMI now found only a limited market for a camera with a 4-tube configuration.\n\nThe EMI 2001 used a 4-way prism assembly to split the light into its components, using the same novel principles that had been developed by Philips for their 3-way splitter. These new assemblies used the property of total internal reflection, within the prisms, to direct the light to the pick-up tubes. The techniques were described in a patent first filed in 1961. The 3-way prism was also described in a description of the LDE3 camera.\n\nThe technique of using a prism assembly in this way was far superior to the earlier light-splitting arrangements, since the prism assembly was neat and compact and reproducibility in manufacture was much improved. The problems previously experienced with double imaging (common with plate glass dichroic mirrors) were also eliminated. Furthermore, because of the near-normal incidence of light onto the dichroic surfaces, sensitivity to polarised light was reduced.\n\nConsequently, EMI chose to use a 4-tube version of the prism splitter for their new colour camera, in order to retain all the advantages of the method. However, devising a single prism arrangement for four tubes was less easy than for three and several alternatives were initially considered.\n\nIn an early configuration of the prism block, shown in the thumbnail, three of the pick-up tubes were envisaged to be in a common plane, but with the fourth (red) tube sticking up, nearly at right angles to the other three. (This configuration was to be used in the Russian 4-tube camera type KT-116M.)\n\nFor the final optical arrangement in the EMI 2001, the 'green' prism was changed to have a fully silvered mirror at about 45 degrees, to deflect the green light sideways, resulting in the final 4-spoke arrangement. (When viewed from the back of a camera the four tubes were seen as a diagonal cross). This optical arrangement defined the cross-section dimensions of the camera (which was not small – 380 x 380 mm), but it did allow the zoom lens to be located within the camera body. Also the removal of individual pick-up tubes was possible without any need to remove the scanning coils, as the tube bases were easily accessible at the outer corners\n\nRank Taylor Hobson declined to offer a zoom lens for EMI's new camera, claiming they were fully committed elsewhere, but the Angenieux Company (see Pierre Angenieux) expressed their interest in supplying zoom lenses for the project. The French company offered two zoom lenses for the camera; the first was a 10:1 zoom for studio use and the second a larger unit for outside broadcasts. Both could be accommodated within the body of the camera, although the O.B. lens did protrude a little. \nTo accommodate a 4-way prism splitter, extra distance was needed, from the back of the lens to the image focal plane, when compared to a 3-tube splitter. This set severe demands for the lens designer, but Angenieux were able to achieve EMI's requirements, provided that field flattening lenses were fitted in front of each pick-up tube. Early cameras used this arrangement, but with later zoom designs these lenses became unnecessary.\n\nThe servo motors and the servo amplifiers were supplied by Evershed Power Optics. The driver amplifiers for the servo motors were mounted in the camera body alongside the lens. The servo-driven zoom lens and the associated amplifier circuitry added considerably to the weight of the camera. In addition, incorporating the servo drivers within the camera body precluded the use of other makes of zoom lens.\n\nThe integral zoom lens was a popular feature of the EMI 2001, which was liked by cameramen, and it was sometimes referred to as \"the cameraman’s camera\". With no protruding zoom lens, the studio camera was only 537mm long enabling it to be used in small spaces and to be panned very easily (it had a low moment of inertia). In addition, pictures produced while panning had a more natural look. The operational flexibility of the camera was demonstrated in training videos.\n\nAlthough the integral zoom lens camera was a popular within the UK, this concept had little influence on designs or sales of cameras elsewhere. Only Marconi with their small neat Mk VIII and the cameras from Link (a few years later) followed the concept. Most camera manufacturers claimed that a format where the lens protrudes out in front of the camera gave greater choice of lens supplier and, of course, it was a format that made life easier for camera designers, so the enthusiasm of cameramen for the integral zoom concept was found to have little long term influence on camera designers. Even EMI abandoned the notion of having an integral zoom lens, with its new camera, the Type 2005, which had a format reminiscent of the very earliest Philip’s experimental camera (with its three horizontally configured tubes)\n\nThe circuitry in the 2001 was all solid state apart from the pick-up tubes and, in the early cameras, the first stage of the head amplifiers. The circuitry made extensive use of the 'ring-of-three' amplifier configuration, shown simplified in the figure. This circuit was easily adapted for various uses.\n\nIn the normal, non-inverting mode, the bottom of resistor R2 is grounded and the input is via V(1). In this mode, the amplifier behaves somewhat like a 'current feedback amplifier'. The circuit maintains its bandwidth as the gain is increased (by reducing R2), unlike a conventional voltage feedback op. amp.\n\nThe circuit has a 'virtual earth' point at 'A' so that inverting or summing amplifiers are possible. In this mode, the base of TR1 is grounded and the input is via V(2) and the series resistor R2.\n\nThe EMI 2001 used band defining filters in all four channels. For the colour channels and narrow-band luminance, the low-pass filters had a Gaussian shaped pass-band and, although such filters were not ‘sharp-cut’, they were linear phase and gave negligible overshoots on transients. The wide-band luminance channel had its bandwidth defined by a linear phase low pass filter with a 3 dB cut-off at 6.8 MHz. Its design follows the lattice filter methods of Bode.\nThe amplitude responses of the two filters are shown below. Also shown are the phase deviations of the two filters from the linear phase/frequency characteristic, given by:\nwhere ‘f’ is the frequency in Hz and (f) is in degrees. At low frequencies, the propagation delays of the two filters are both the same (177 ns, approximately).\n\nThe composite signals of the NTSC, PAL and SECAM systems are made up of a wideband luminance signal and two narrow-band colour difference signals containing B-Y and R-Y. If a band-limited version of the signal from the luminance tube is used to derive the colour difference signals, without modification, then colour errors would occur. This is because the luminance characteristic expected by the colour processing must be made up in a particular way, using specific proportions of red, green and blue, whereas the signal form the luminance tube has a more general monochromatic characteristic akin to that from a conventional black and white camera. In addition, the application of gamma correction to the signals further complicates the situation (display tubes have, approximately, a square law characteristic with γ ≈ 2.2).\n\nAs shown below, it is beneficial, but not sufficient, to shape the luminance response to simulate that of the NTSC (PAL or SECAM) luminance characteristic (by, for example, placing an optical filter in front of the luminance tube to pass light with the required luminosity function, or by a special dichroic surface which reflects light to the luminance tube with the required luminosity function).\n\nFor a basic 3-colour system the wideband luminance signal (Y'), for NTSC, PAL and SECAM, is given by: \n\nIn the case of a separate luminance tube, with appropriate spectral shaping, the output signal (Y) is given by:\n\nwhich when gamma-corrected gives:\n\nWhen deriving the two narrowband colour difference signals containing R and B , a bandlimited version of the luminance signal (y') is required, namely:\n\nbut the band limited signal from the luminance tube is:\n\nAs before, formula_9 does not equal formula_10. If the gamma corrected luminance signal formula_9 is simply used instead of y' then colour errors result which can be appreciable for saturated colours.\n\nIn the EMI 2001 a process known as Delta-L Correction is used to overcome this problem.\n\nA band-limited luminance difference correction signal, ΔL is formed, where:\nThis narrowband signal is used to correct the wideband luminance channel at low frequencies, so the monchrome signal transmitted becomes:\n\nWith this corrected luminance signal, the correct colour rendition is obtained, whilst still retaining the sharp luminance detail of a 4-tube camera. The narrowband R, G and B signals are gamma corrected and applied to a suitable matrixing circuit, to derive the correction. With grey scale scenes formula_9 = formula_10 and the signal reverts to that of the luminance tube only.\n\n“Blooming” refers to the situation where bright areas in a picture 'bleed' into adjacent dark areas, with a consequential loss of picture sharpness and detail. The condition leads to “comet-tails” which streak across a picture, following moving highlights.\n\nThe pictures from early Plumbicon cameras were susceptible to comet tails and blooming and, although these effects had not been a major concern in the previous generation of cameras, which employed vidicon or image orthicon tubes, they were an annoying feature of Plumbicon tubes.\n\nThe problems arose when the beam current of a pick-up tube was insufficient to fully discharge the target in very bright areas of an image. Reducing the target voltage and increasing the beam current of the pick-up tube helped to mitigate the problem but, with early Plumbicons, this resulted in loss of resolution and increased lag.\n\nThis problem with Plumbicon tubes was already of concern in the early 1960s and all the early plumbicon cameras suffered from it, including the EMI 2001. With separate mesh tubes there was some improvement, because higher beam currents could be used without loss of resolution. Some cameras introduced anti comet-tail circuits to provide dynamic correction, when an overload was sensed (ACT circuits), but these were not used in the EMI 2001.\n\nThe problem was not satisfactorily resolved until the late 1960s when an extra ‘anti-comet-tail’ gun was introduced into plumbicon tubes. New camera designs, produced in the 1970s, were able to include the new improved tubes, and usually did so. Some 2001 cameras were modified to take the new tubes, but it was a difficult retrofit procedure, because of the complexity of the additional circuitry.\n\nAs supplied by EMI, the 2001 and the later 2001/1, did not have any form of ACT (anti-comet tail) or HOP (highlight overload protection). This is why its performance was poor, in this respect, when compared with the next generation of cameras supplied in the 1970s. None of the first generation of true broadcast cameras in the middle to late 1960s had ACT, so the EMI 2001 was not unusual.\n\nWhen observing old programmes, such as those from the 2001, it is very easy to tell if a programme used EMI 2001s (or any other first-generation PAL colour camera) to capture the images as the comet tails would often be coloured \"blobs\" or \"splodges\" (usually caused by a light source or light reflecting off a highly reflective or polished surface) simply because the camera did not have ACT circuits.\n\nSome broadcasters modified their cameras to have ACT, but retro fitting ACT/HOP was not an easy modification as 4 new HOP camera tubes would be needed, the tube bases, wiring harness, 4 head amplifiers and 4 video amplifiers and the tube beam current boards would all have needed work done to them. ACT and HOP works by using an extra electrode in the tube to 'flood discharge' the target during the flyback period. Great care was needed in setting up the HOP voltages as damage to the tube’s emission could occur. Once fitted, the ACT circuits were adjusted so that the Comet Tail doesn't appear as a \"blob\". <br>\nEven when ACT circuits had been retro-fitted, comet tails would sometimes occur, consisting of either a mix of two separate colours, one colour inside the other (e.g. a comet tail that is red with a smaller comet tail inside that one that may be green), or the comet tail may be a non primary colour, such as pink. The problems occurred when the settings of the ACT circuits were not well matched.\n\nFour-tube television camera\n\n"}

The development and publishing of Flight Control on non-Apple mobile phones is being handled by Namco under license.\n\nAn HD version of the game called \"Flight Control HD\" was released for the iPad in March 2010 and for the PlayStation 3 on the PlayStation Network (supporting the PlayStation Move controller) on September 15, 2010. The PlayStation 3 version supports exclusive additional features including a stereoscopic 3D mode, 1080p resolution, four player co-operative multiplayer, as well as an exclusive new map, Metropolis, which features a day and night cycle. Flight Control HD was also ported to the Microsoft Windows and OS X operating systems and made available through Steam. These releases are similar to the iPad version aside from the addition of a new airfield. The Mac version was released via the Mac App Store on July 21, 2011.\n\nIn September 2015, the iOS version was removed for sale from the App Store, although it remains for sale on Android.\n\nPlayers assume the role of an air traffic controller at an extremely busy airport. The airport features a runway for large red jets, a runway for small yellow planes and a helipad for blue helicopters. Players draw paths along the field to direct each aircraft to its designated landing zone. Each successfully landed aircraft scores the player one point, and as the player's score increases, so does the number of aircraft that will appear on the screen simultaneously. The game ends when two or more aircraft collide. Players receive a high score for the most planes landed, which can be uploaded to online leaderboards using Firemint's cloudcell technology as well as to those in the iOS Game Center. The 1.2 version update includes four additional types of aircraft and two new stages (a beach and an aircraft carrier). The 1.3 version update includes the use of Bluetooth to enable multiplayer via a second device. The 1.5 update includes a new Australian Outback map which includes airplanes from the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia that cannot be redirected.\n\nUpdate 1.7, released on May 11, 2010, completely overhauls the graphical engine to add higher quality animations and more vibrant detail to the game. For fans of the Flight Control theme song, the 1.7 update extends the length of the title screen melody. A new fast forward feature called 'Safe Fast Forward' has also been included. Safe Fast Forward slows the game down to normal speed when a plane crash is imminent, allowing the player more time to prevent it. 'Windy Airfield' is a newly added airfield which only allows the player to land planes on runways that face into the wind. Runways that face the same direction as the wind are closed until the wind changes. A windsock indicates which direction the wind is coming from.

{"id": "3103575", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3103575", "title": "Ginger Kids", "text": "Ginger Kids\n\n\"Ginger Kids\" is the eleventh episode in the ninth season of the American animated television series \"South Park\". The 136th episode of the series overall, it first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on November 9, 2005. The episode was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker. It caused controversy after its ironic premise was misunderstood by people who acted violently against redheads.\n\nIn the episode, Cartman suffers from a mysterious and sudden onset of Gingervitus. Sick and tired of being ridiculed for his red hair, light skin and freckles, he rallies all the ginger kids everywhere to fight against discrimination and rise up and become the master race they are intended to be.\n\nFor a class presentation, Cartman delivers a hate speech, against what he calls \"gingers\": people with red hair, freckles, and pale skin due to a disease called \"Gingervitis\". He describes them as being disgusting, inhuman, unable to survive in sunlight, and having no souls. When Kyle points out that he too has red hair, Cartman says that there is a second class of redheads, the \"daywalkers\", who have red hair but not pale skin and freckles.\n\nIn Kyle's attempt to prove Cartman wrong, he decides to do a presentation countering Cartman's facts, arguing that being a \"ginger kid\" is an inheritable trait. To prove this, Kyle and Stan visit a family who have redhead children. To their shock, the parents of the Ginger kids, who each carry a recessive gene that has caused them to have Ginger kids, possess the same prejudice towards Ginger kids as Cartman. The father of the Ginger kids informs Kyle that marrying an Asian woman ensures that the recessive gene is not passed down, and mentions a friend who is marrying an Asian woman for that reason. When Kyle makes his presentation, Cartman stands up for his claims and uses Biblical references, alleging that Judas Iscariot was a Ginger. As a result, Cartman's speech causes a new-found prejudice towards Ginger kids in the school. The gingers are treated as outcasts and forced to eat in the hallway rather than the cafeteria. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny agree that they need to teach Cartman a lesson.\n\nAt night, the three sneak into Cartman's room and use skin bleach to make his skin pale, dye his hair red, and put Henna tattoos of freckles on his face. Cartman wakes up in the morning to discover that he now has the disease \"gingervitis\" and has become a Ginger himself. Cartman is taken to the doctor, who turns out to be prejudiced himself and soon insults him, even suggesting that Mrs. Cartman have him put down, which she considers. At school, Cartman is laughed at by Butters, and faces discrimination from the very people he himself convinced to despise Gingers. He is forced to join the gingers in eating in the hallway despite his attempts to convince them that he is still who he was. In response to this, Cartman establishes the \"Ginger Separatist Movement\" to promote the better aspects of being ginger.\n\nInitially peaceful, Cartman's movement quickly becomes violent and Nazi-esque in tone, arguing that Gingers are a \"great race\", though when he tries to name a successful \"ginger\", the gingers are forced to simply declare themselves as being like \"Ron Howard… and others.\" He and his organization start holding protests, including beating up a brunette who played Annie, for playing a redhead but not actually being one. Eventually, Cartman convinces the Ginger kids to decide to kill all the town's non-gingers by telling them \"The only way to fight hate… is with MORE hate!\"\n\nAn hour before dawn, the boys decide to sneak into Cartman's room and change him back to his original appearance. However, on their way over to his house, Ginger kids start to creep out of seemingly nowhere and follow them. At first, though terrified, the boys try to ignore them and decide to go home. Kenny is suddenly snatched away, prompting Kyle and Stan to break into a run. Meanwhile, children across the town are abducted from their homes by the Ginger kids. Eventually, Stan and Kyle are the only ones left. They lock themselves in a barn for protection but the Ginger kids break in and capture them both.\n\nAll the non-gingers are taken to the Sunset Room at the Airport Hilton Hotel, complete with a lava pit and refreshment buffet. They are all imprisoned in cages and will be chosen for sacrifice one by one.\n\n\"Daywalker\" Kyle is chosen as the first. Cartman states a \"half-ginger\" is much worse than one with no such trait. However, he asks that before he dies, he say something private to Cartman. Kyle whispers in Cartman's ear that he is not in fact a \"ginger\". Now thinking only of self-preservation, he realizes that if his own cult were to learn of his true physical identity he too would die with every other non-\"ginger kid\" of the town. Cartman pretends to have had an epiphany that everyone should live in harmony and peace since Kyle's speech, then gets everyone to sing a song about how the different races should live together in peace. As the non-gingers are freed, an annoyed Kyle calls Cartman a \"manipulative asshole\" for his hypocrisy. Cartman gleefully responds \"Yes, but I'm not going to die\".\n\nOn the DVD commentary for \"Ginger Kids\", Trey Parker and Matt Stone said that they had wanted to do an episode about ginger kids for a long time, though did not initially know what to do for it. Parker and Stone were inspired to create the episode by a billboard that they saw in England while promoting the show. The billboard read \"Only you can prevent ginger\" and had a picture of a redheaded girl. Parker and Stone did a lot of research to ensure that there was some truth to the whole story, rather than it being purely fictional.\n\nThe fact that Kyle has red hair introduced some difficulties during production. Parker and Stone felt that they needed to distinguish Kyle from the other redheaded kids because the character does not associate with them. Also, it had already been established that Kyle did indeed have red hair, thus making it more necessary to give an explanation as to why he was not like the other gingers. They eventually settled on the idea that there were true redheaded gingers, like the ones Cartman starts associating with, and \"daywalkers\", people like Kyle with red hair but no freckles or light skin.\n\nIn the episode, a man tells Stan and Kyle \"If you really don't want to have ginger kids, marry an Asian woman. Asians don't carry the recessive gene. I know a guy who's marrying a Japanese woman very soon for just that reason.\" This is an intentional reference to Parker doing the same thing in real life. He once had a girlfriend whose mother had red hair, and ended the relationship to avoid having redheaded children, and even admitted to harboring what he described as racial prejudice against gingers. He later married Emma Sugiyama, a Japanese woman.\n\nThe episode supposedly inspired \"Kick a Ginger Day\" in 2013 at Wingfield Academy in Rotherham, Yorkshire, where red-headed students faced discrimination based on their hair color. Parents of the discriminated students launched a Facebook group protesting the offending students in an attempt to end the bullying. One mother pulled her 13-year-old son from the school until she could be assured that the discrimination would stop, saying \"My son rang me and said kids were kicking him, saying it was National Kick a Ginger Kid Day. He was scared so I went to get him out of school.\" One father was disgusted with the way students treated his 13-year-old daughter based on her hair color, and reported that she received bruised legs from beatings, stating \"She should be able to go to school without having to worry about being kicked in the corridor.\" School staff \"strongly reprimanded\" the offending students. A school spokesperson declared the incidents \"deplorable acts\" and stated that the entire institution was warned that students who continued such discrimination would also be punished.\n\n"}

Milton S. Hershey established HE&R in 1927 to distinguish and separate his chocolate manufacturing company from his other business ventures. All of his non-chocolate producing businesses were established as Hershey Estates, renamed Hershey Entertainment and Resorts Company in 1980.\n\nIn 1894, Milton S. Hershey founded the Hershey Chocolate Company as a subsidiary of his Lancaster Caramel Company. In 1900, the American Caramel Company offered to purchase the Lancaster Caramel Company for $1 million. Hershey accepted the offer, maintaining ownership of the Hershey Chocolate Company. In 1903, Hershey began purchasing land in Derry Township, Pennsylvania, not far from the family homestead he owned, to create a company town for his proposed chocolate factory. To build the structures of the town, Hershey created a subsidiary company called the Hershey Improvement Company. This company was the predecessor to Hershey Entertainment and Resorts. After the factory was completed and put in operation in 1904, the Hershey Improvement Company turned toward building the town, which included homes, stores and parks. Hershey Park was opened on May 30, 1906, with a dance hall pavilion, band shell for shows, tennis courts and a baseball field with a grand stand available for sporting events. As the park gained popularity, further improvements were made, such as a grand entrance for the park in 1916.\n\nIn 1905, Hershey created the Hershey Trust Company to provide banking to the town of Hershey. In 1909, Hershey and his wife Catherine, who were unable to have children, established the Hershey Industrial School for orphan boys (renamed the Milton Hershey School in 1951). Hershey created a deed of trust establishing a trust fund for the school. He named the Hershey Trust Company as administrator of the school trust. In 1918, three years after Catherine Hershey died, Hershey transferred nearly all of his assets, including his control of the chocolate company, and various other entities, to the school. This made the Hershey Trust Company owner of the Hershey Improvement Company.\n\nIn 1920, Hershey experienced financial difficulty following the collapse in sugar futures. Hershey was forced to sign a promissory note from National City Bank to keep the chocolate company in business. Under the terms of the note, National City Bank sent R.J. DeCamp to be on the board of managers, to assume management of the company. DeCamp remained on the board until 1922, when the company settled the debt. During that time period, DeCamp prevented substantial improvements to the park or the town, as it was considered too costly an investment. Once Hershey regained control of the company, this made him realize that he should split his operations such that if the chocolate company ever failed again as it had, it wouldn't directly impact the town as the DeCamp period had.\n\nIn 1927, the Hershey Chocolate Company was incorporated, became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange, and became the Hershey Chocolate Corporation. The Cuban businesses held within the chocolate company were spun out into a privately owned company called Hershey Corporation. All of Hershey’s other non-chocolate business endeavors were incorporated into a separate entity known as Hershey Estates. All three entities were owned by the Hershey Trust Company - under public majority share or privately held ownership. This meant that the Hershey Estates was a distinctly separate company from the chocolate corporation.\n\nIn 1933, The Hotel Hershey opened, becoming Hershey Estate's second hotel in Hershey. Hershey Estates was a conglomeration, having ownership of such things as a bakery, electric company, creamery, sports arena, air park, amusement park, and lumber yard. The Estates company maintained this kind of control until the 1960s, when they began selling off public works companies such as the electric company, gave control of the roads they owned to Derry Township, and began closing poor performing divisions. In 1971, Hershey Estates began a large renovation project for Hershey Park, involving new rides, a gate around the park, live acts, and other kinds of entertainment. The park was also renamed Hersheypark.\n\nIn 1976, the company changed its name from Hershey Estates to HERCO, Inc., because public perception led many to believe that Hershey Estates referred to land that Milton Hershey once owned. In 1980, the name was changed to the current name: Hershey Entertainment and Resorts Company (HE&R), a backronym.\n\nBetween 1980 and 1987, HE&R began expanding their presence to hotels in the Pocono Mountains, Philadelphia and Corpus Christi, Texas, as well as purchasing Lake Compounce in Bristol and Southington, Connecticut. However, economic and political circumstances caused the Philadelphia and Corpus Christi hotels to struggle substantially. This caused HE&R to experience severe financial difficulties, leading to the promotion of J. Bruce McKinney as CEO of the company. One of his first significant decisions was the controversial move to sell Hershey Lake Compounce.\n\nUltimately, McKinney successfully led the company back to financial stability, which led to substantial growth within Hersheypark and at the Hershey Lodge in the mid and late 1990s. McKinney retired in 2000 and was replaced by Scott Newkam.\n\nNewkam served as CEO of HE&R until 2006, when Newkam was replaced by Ted Kleisner. On January 1, 2013, William F. Simpson Jr. replaced Kleisner as the CEO of Hershey Entertainment and Resorts.\nThere are two main divisions of the Hershey Entertainment and Resorts Company: Hershey Entertainment Group and the Hershey Resorts Group.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "22144721", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22144721", "title": "Iron Man 2", "text": "Iron Man 2\n\nIron Man 2 is a 2010 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Iron Man, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Paramount Pictures. It is the sequel to 2008's \"Iron Man\", and is the third film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Jon Favreau and written by Justin Theroux, the film stars Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man, alongside Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Sam Rockwell, Mickey Rourke, and Samuel L. Jackson. Six months after the events of \"Iron Man\", Tony Stark is resisting calls by the United States government to hand over the Iron Man technology while also combating his declining health from the arc reactor in his chest. Meanwhile, rogue Russian scientist Ivan Vanko has developed the same technology and built weapons of his own in order to pursue a vendetta against the Stark family, in the process joining forces with Stark's business rival, Justin Hammer.\n\nFollowing the successful release of \"Iron Man\" in May 2008, Marvel Studios announced and immediately set to work on producing a sequel. In July of that same year Theroux was hired to write the script, and Favreau was signed to return and direct. Downey, Paltrow and Jackson were set to reprise their roles from \"Iron Man\", while Cheadle was brought in to replace Terrence Howard in the role of James Rhodes. In the early months of 2009, Rourke, Rockwell and Johansson filled out the supporting cast, and filming took place from April to July of that year. Like its predecessor the film was shot mostly in California, except for a key sequence in Monaco.\n\n\"Iron Man 2\" premiered at the El Capitan Theatre on April 26, 2010, and was released in the United States on May 7, 2010. The film received generally positive reviews and was commercially successful, grossing over $623.9 million at the worldwide box office, making it the seventh highest-grossing film of 2010, and receiving an Academy Award nomination for Best Visual Effects. The third installment of the \"Iron Man\" series, \"Iron Man 3\", was released on May 3, 2013.\nIn Russia, the media covers Tony Stark's disclosure of his identity as Iron Man. Ivan Vanko, whose father Anton Vanko has just died, sees this and begins building a miniature arc reactor similar to Stark's. Six months later, Stark is a superstar and uses his Iron Man suit for peaceful means, resisting government pressure to sell his designs. He reinstitutes the Stark Expo to continue his father Howard's legacy.\n\nThe palladium core in the arc reactor that keeps Stark alive and powers the armor is slowly poisoning him, and he cannot find a substitute. Growing increasingly reckless and despondent about his impending death, and choosing not to tell anyone about his condition, Stark appoints his personal assistant Pepper Potts CEO of Stark Industries, and hires Stark employee Natalie Rushman to replace her as his personal assistant. Stark competes in the Monaco Historic Grand Prix, where he is attacked in the middle of the race by Vanko, who wields electrified whips. Stark dons his Mark V armor and defeats Vanko, but the suit is severely damaged. Vanko explains his intention was to prove to the world that Iron Man is not invincible. Impressed by Vanko's performance, Stark's rival, Justin Hammer, fakes Vanko's death while breaking him out of prison and asks him to build a line of armored suits to upstage Stark. During what he believes is his final birthday party, Stark gets drunk while wearing the Mark IV suit. Disgusted, Stark's best friend, U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes dons Stark's Mark II prototype armor and tries to restrain him. The fight ends in a stalemate, so Rhodes confiscates the Mark II for the U.S. Air Force.\n\nNick Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D., approaches Stark, revealing \"Rushman\" to be Agent Natasha Romanoff and that Howard Stark was a S.H.I.E.L.D. founder whom Fury knew personally. Fury explains that Vanko's father jointly invented the arc reactor with Stark, but when Anton tried to sell it for profit, Stark had him deported. The Soviets sent Anton to the gulag. Fury gives Stark some of his father's old material; a hidden message in the diorama of the 1974 Stark Expo proves to be a diagram of the structure of a new element. With the aid of his computer J.A.R.V.I.S., Stark synthesizes it. When he learns Vanko is still alive, he places the new element in his arc reactor and ends his palladium dependency.\n\nAt the Expo, Hammer unveils Vanko's armored drones, led by Rhodes in a heavily weaponized version of the Mark II armor. Stark arrives in the Mark VI armor to warn Rhodes, but Vanko remotely takes control of both the drones and Rhodes' armor and attacks Iron Man. Hammer is arrested while Romanoff and Stark's bodyguard Happy Hogan go after Vanko at Hammer's factory. Vanko escapes, but Romanoff returns control of the Mark II armor to Rhodes. Stark and Rhodes together defeat Vanko and his drones. Vanko seemingly commits suicide by blowing up his suit, along with the defeated drones.\n\nAt a debriefing, Fury informs Stark that because of Stark's difficult personality, S.H.I.E.L.D. intends to use him only as a consultant. Stark and Rhodes receive medals for their heroism. In a post-credits scene, S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson reports the discovery of a large hammer at the bottom of a crater in a desert in New Mexico.\n\n\nThe director, Jon Favreau, reprises his role as Happy Hogan, Tony Stark's bodyguard and chauffeur, while Clark Gregg and Leslie Bibb reprise their roles as S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Phil Coulson and reporter Christine Everhart, respectively. John Slattery appears as Tony's father Howard Stark and Garry Shandling appears as United States Senator Stern, who wants Stark to give Iron Man's armor to the government. Favreau stated that Shandling's character was named after radio personality Howard Stern. Paul Bettany again voices Stark's computer, J.A.R.V.I.S. Olivia Munn has a small role as Chess Roberts, a reporter covering the Stark expo, Yevgeni Lazarev appears as Ivan Vanko's father Anton Vanko, Kate Mara portrays a U.S. Marshal who summons Tony to the government hearing, and Stan Lee appears as himself (but is mistaken for Larry King).\n\nAdditionally, news anchor Christiane Amanpour and political commentator Bill O'Reilly play themselves in newscasts. Adam Goldstein appears as himself and the film is dedicated to his memory. Further cameos include Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk and Oracle Corporation CEO Larry Ellison. Favreau's son Max appears as a child wearing an Iron Man mask whom Stark saves from a drone. This was retroactively made the introduction of a young Peter Parker to the MCU, as confirmed in June 2017 by eventual Spider-Man actor Tom Holland, Feige and \"\" director Jon Watts.\n\nJon Favreau said it was originally his intent to create a film trilogy for Iron Man, with Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) becoming Iron Monger during the sequels. After a meeting between Favreau and various comic book writers, including Mark Millar, Stane became the main villain in \"Iron Man\". Millar argued the Mandarin, whom Favreau originally intended to fill that role, was too fantastical. Favreau concurred, deciding, \"I look at Mandarin more like how in \"Star Wars\" you had the Emperor, but Darth Vader is the guy you want to see fight. Then you work your way to the time when lightning bolts are shooting out of the fingers and all that stuff could happen. But you can't have what happened in \"Return of the Jedi\" happen in \"A New Hope\". You just can't do it.\" Favreau also discussed in interviews how the films' version of Mandarin \"allows us to incorporate the whole pantheon of villains\". He mentioned that S.H.I.E.L.D. would continue to have a major role.\n\nDuring development, Favreau said the film would explore Stark's alcoholism, but it would not be \"the 'Demon in a Bottle' version\". While promoting the first film, Downey stated that Stark would probably develop a drinking problem as he is unable to cope with his age, the effects of revealing he is Iron Man, and Pepper getting a boyfriend. Downey later clarified that the film was not a strict adaptation of the \"Demon in a Bottle\" storyline from the comic book series, but was instead about the \"interim space\" between the origin and the \"Demon\" story arc. Shane Black gave some advice on the script, and suggested to Favreau and Downey that they model Stark on J. Robert Oppenheimer, who became depressed with being \"the destroyer of worlds\" after working on the Manhattan Project.\n\nImmediately following \"Iron Man\"s release, Marvel Studios announced that they were developing a sequel, with an intended release date of April 30, 2010. In July 2008, after several months of negotiating, Favreau officially signed on to direct. That same month, Justin Theroux signed to write the script, which would be based on a story written by Favreau and Downey. Theroux co-wrote \"Tropic Thunder\", which Downey had starred in, and Downey recommended him to Marvel. Genndy Tartakovsky storyboarded the film, and Adi Granov returned to supervise the designs for Iron Man's armor.\n\nIn October 2008, Marvel Studios came to an agreement to film \"Iron Man 2\", as well as their next three films, at Raleigh Studios in Manhattan Beach, California. A few days later, Don Cheadle was hired to replace Terrence Howard. On being replaced, Howard stated, \"There was no explanation, apparently the contracts that we write and sign aren't worth the paper that they're printed on sometimes. Promises aren't kept, and good faith negotiations aren't always held up.\" \"Entertainment Weekly\" stated Favreau did not enjoy working with Howard, often re-shooting and cutting his scenes; Howard's publicist said he had a good experience playing the part, while Marvel chose not to comment. As Favreau and Theroux chose to reduce the role, Marvel came to Howard to discuss lowering his salary – Howard was the first actor hired in \"Iron Man\" and was paid the largest salary. The publication stated they were unsure whether Howard's representatives left the project first or if Marvel chose to stop negotiating. Theroux denied the part of the report which claimed the size of the role had fluctuated. In November 2013, Howard stated that, going into the film, the studio offered him far less than was in his three-picture contract, claiming they told him the second will be successful, \"with or without you,\" and, without mentioning him by name, said Downey \"took the money that was supposed to go to me and pushed me out.\"\n\nIn January 2009, Rourke and Rockwell entered negotiations to play a pair of villains. A few days later, Rockwell confirmed he would take the role, and that his character would be Justin Hammer. Paul Bettany confirmed that he would be returning to voice J.A.R.V.I.S. Marvel entered into early talks with Emily Blunt to play the Black Widow, though she was unable to take the role due to a previous commitment to star in \"Gulliver's Travels\". Samuel L. Jackson confirmed that he had been in discussions to reprise the role of Nick Fury from the first film's post-credits scene, but that contract disputes were making a deal difficult. Jackson claimed that \"There was a huge kind of negotiation that broke down. I don't know. Maybe I won't be Nick Fury.\"\n\nIn February, Jackson and Marvel came to terms, and he was signed to play the character in up to nine films. Downey and Rourke discussed his part during a roundtable discussion with David Ansen at the 2009 Golden Globes, and Rourke met with Favreau and Theroux to discuss the role. Rourke almost dropped out due to Marvel's initial salary offer of $250,000, but the studio raised the offer, and in March Rourke signed on. Later that same day Scarlett Johansson signed on to play the Black Widow. Her deal included options for multiple films, including potentially \"The Avengers\". In April, Garry Shandling, Clark Gregg, and Kate Mara joined the cast.\n\nPrincipal photography began April 6, 2009, at the Pasadena Masonic Temple, with the working title \"Rasputin\". The bulk of the production took place at Raleigh Studios, though other locations were also used. Scenes were filmed at Edwards Air Force Base from May 11 through May 13. The location had also been used for \"Iron Man\", and Favreau stated that he felt the \"real military assets make the movie more authentic and the topography and the beauty of the desert and flightline open the movie up\". The Historic Grand Prix of Monaco action sequence was shot in the parking lot of Downey Studios, with sets constructed in May and filming lasting through June. Permission to film in Monaco prior to the 2009 Monaco Grand Prix had initially been awarded, but was later retracted by Bernie Ecclestone. The filmmakers shipped one Rolls-Royce Phantom there, and filmed a track sequence in which race cars were later digitally added. Tanner Foust took on the role of driving Stark's racing car. Also in June, it was reported that John Slattery had joined the film's cast as Howard Stark. Olivia Munn was also cast, in an unspecified role.\n\nA massive green screen was constructed at the Sepulveda Dam to film a portion of the Stark Expo exterior, with the rest either shot at an area high school or added digitally. To construct the green screen, hundreds of shipping containers were stacked, covered in plywood and plaster, and then painted green. For the conclusion of that climactic scene, which the crew dubbed the \"Japanese Garden\" scene, a set was built inside Sony Studios in Los Angeles. Filming lasted 71 days, and the film's production officially wrapped on July 18, 2009. A post-credits scene depicting the discovery of a large hammer was filmed on the set of \"Thor\", and some of it was reused in the film. Jon Favreau revealed that the scene was filmed with anamorphic lenses to match \"Thor\", and was directed by Kenneth Branagh, the director of \"Thor\".\n\nIn January 2010, IMAX Corporation, Marvel, and Paramount announced that the film would receive a limited release on digital IMAX screens. It was not shot with IMAX cameras, so it was converted into the format using the IMAX DMR technology. The film underwent reshoots in February. Olivia Munn's original role was cut, but she was given a new role during the reshoots.\nJanek Sirrs was the film's visual effects supervisor, and Industrial Light & Magic again did the majority of the effects, as it did on the first film. ILM's visual effects supervisor on the film, Ben Snow, said their work on the film was \"harder\" than their work on the first, stating that Favreau asked more of them this time around. Snow described the process of digitally creating the suits:\nILM created 527 shots for the film, using programs such as Maya. Perception worked on over 125 shots for the film. They crafted gadgets, such as Tony Stark's transparent LG smartphone, and created the backdrops for the Stark Expo as well as the computer screen interfaces on the touch-screen coffee table and the holographic lab environment. In total, 11 visual effect studios worked on the film.\n\nA soundtrack album featuring AC/DC was released by Columbia Records on April 19, 2010, in at least three different versions: basic, special and deluxe. The basic edition includes the CD; the special edition contains a 15-track CD, a 32-page booklet and a DVD featuring interviews, behind-the-scenes footage, and music videos; and the deluxe includes a reproduction of one of Iron Man's first comic book appearances. Only 2 songs on the soundtrack actually appear in the movie. Although not included on the soundtrack album the film includes songs by The Average White Band, The Clash, Queen, Daft Punk, 2Pac and Beastie Boys.\n\nThe film score was released commercially as \"Iron Man 2: Original Motion Picture Score\" on July 20, 2010, featuring 25 tracks. John Debney composed the score with Tom Morello, with composer Richard M. Sherman of the Sherman Brothers contributing the Stark Expo theme song, \"Make Way for Tomorrow Today\".\n\nAt the 2009 San Diego Comic Con, a five-minute trailer for the movie was shown. Actors portraying Stark Industries recruiters handed out business cards with an invitation to apply. A website for Stark Industries went online, with an attached graphic of a \"napkin memo\" from Stark to Potts announcing that Stark Industries no longer made weapons. Another section featured an online application. It was confirmed that the first theatrical trailer would premiere in front of \"Sherlock Holmes\" (another Robert Downey Jr. film). This trailer was released online on December 16, 2009. A new trailer was shown by Robert Downey Jr. on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" on March 7 after the Academy Awards. Promotional partners included Symantec, Dr Pepper, Burger King, 7 Eleven, Audi, LG Electronics\nand Hershey.\n\nAuthor Alexander C. Irvine adapted the script into a novel, also titled \"Iron Man 2\", that was released in April 2010. Prior to the film release, Marvel Comics released a four issue miniseries comic book titled \"Iron Man vs Whiplash\", which introduced the film's version of Whiplash into the Marvel Universe. A three issue prequel miniseries titled \"Iron Man 2: Public Identity\" was released in April.\n\nAn \"Iron Man 2\" video game was released by Sega on May 4, 2010 in North America, written by \"The Invincible Iron Man\" scribe Matt Fraction. The Wii version was developed by High Voltage Software and all console versions were published by Sega, while Gameloft published the mobile game. The game's Comic-Con trailer showed that the Crimson Dynamo was set to appear as a villain. Cheadle and Jackson voice their respective characters in the games. The trailer revealed that A.I.M, Roxxon Energy Corporation, and Ultimo (depicted as a man named Kearson DeWitt in a large armor) are enemies in the game as well as reveal that the wearer of the Crimson Dynamo armor is General Valentin Shatalov. The game received generally unfavorable reviews, with a Metacritic score of 41% for both the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions.\n\n\"Iron Man 2\" premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles, California on April 26, 2010, and was released in 6,764 theaters (48 IMAX) across 54 countries between April 28 and May 7, before going into general release in the United States on May 7, 2010. In the United States, it opened at 4,380 theaters, 181 of which were IMAX. The international release date of the film was moved forward to increase interest ahead of the 2010 FIFA World Cup association football tournament.\n\nOn September 28, 2010, the film was released by Paramount Home Media Distribution on DVD and Blu-ray. The film was also collected in a 10-disc box set titled \"Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One – Avengers Assembled\" which includes all of the Phase One films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on April 2, 2013.\n\n\"Iron Man 2\" earned $312.4 million in the United States and Canada, as well as $311.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $623.9 million. Since the film was included in a predetermined legacy distribution deal that was signed before the Walt Disney Company purchased Marvel, Paramount Pictures distributed the film and collected 8% of the box office, while the remaining portion went to Disney.\n\n\"Iron Man 2\" earned $51 million on its opening day in the United States and Canada (including $7.5 million from Thursday previews), for a total weekend gross of $128 million, which was the fifth-highest opening weekend ever, at the time, behind \"The Dark Knight\", \"Spider-Man 3\", \"\" and \"\". It also had the highest opening for a 2010 movie. The film yielded an average of $29,252 per theater. IMAX contributed $9.8 million, which was the highest opening weekend for a 2D IMAX film, surpassing \"Star Trek's\" previous record of $8.5 million. \"Iron Man 2\" was the third-highest-grossing film of 2010 in the United States and Canada, behind \"Toy Story 3\" and \"Alice in Wonderland\".\n\n\"Iron Man 2\" launched in six European markets with number-one openings on Wednesday, April 28, 2010, for a total $2.2 million. It earned $100.2 million its first five days from 53 foreign markets for a strong average of $14,814 per site. IMAX Corporation reported grosses of $2.25 million. This surpassed the previous record-holder for an IMAX 2D release, 2009's \"\" ($2.1 million). It was the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2010 internationally, behind \"Toy Story 3\", \"Alice in Wonderland\", \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1\", \"Inception\", \"Shrek Forever After\", and \"\".\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 73% approval rating with an average rating of 6.5/10 based on 286 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"It isn't quite the breath of fresh air that \"Iron Man\" was, but this sequel comes close with solid performances and an action-packed plot.\" Metacritic gave the film a weighted average rating of 57/100 based on 40 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nBrian Lowry of \"Variety\" stated, \"\"Iron Man 2\" isn't as much fun as its predecessor, but by the time the smoke clears, it'll do\". Anthony Lane of \"The New Yorker\" said, \"To find a comic-book hero who doesn't agonize over his supergifts, and would defend his constitutional right to get a kick out of them, is frankly a relief\". David Edelstein of \"New York Magazine\" wrote, \"It doesn't come close to the emotional heft of those two rare 2s that outclassed their ones: \"Superman II\" and \"Spider-Man 2\". But \"Iron Man 2\" hums along quite nicely\". Roger Ebert gave it 3 stars out of 4, stating that \"\"Iron Man 2\" is a polished, high-octane sequel, not as good as the original but building once again on a quirky performance by Robert Downey Jr\". Frank Lovece of \"Film Journal International\", a one-time Marvel Comics writer, said that, \"In a refreshing and unexpected turn, the sequel to \"Iron Man\" doesn't find a changed man. Inside the metal, imperfect humanity grows even more so, as thought-provoking questions of identity meet techno-fantasy made flesh.\"\n\nConversely, Kirk Honeycutt of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" stated, \"Everything fun and terrific about \"Iron Man\", a mere two years ago, has vanished with its sequel. In its place, \"Iron Man 2\" has substituted noise, confusion, multiple villains, irrelevant stunts and misguided story lines.\"\n\nAfter the release of \"Iron Man 2\", Walt Disney Studios agreed to pay Paramount at least $115 million for the worldwide distribution rights to \"Iron Man 3\" and \"The Avengers\". Disney, Marvel and Paramount announced a May 3, 2013 release date for \"Iron Man 3\". Shane Black directed \"Iron Man 3\", from a screenplay by Drew Pearce. Downey, Paltrow, Cheadle, and Favreau reprised their roles, while Ben Kingsley played Trevor Slattery, Guy Pearce played Aldrich Killian, and Rebecca Hall played Maya Hansen.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3858746", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3858746", "title": "Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa", "text": "Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa\n\nMadagascar: Escape 2 Africa is a 2008 American computer-animated comedy film produced by DreamWorks Animation. As the sequel to the 2005 film \"Madagascar\", it continues the adventures of Alex the Lion, Marty the Zebra, Melman the Giraffe, and Gloria the Hippo. It was directed by Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath, with a screenplay written by Etan Cohen, Darnell, and McGrath. The voice actors Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, David Schwimmer, Jada Pinkett Smith, Sacha Baron Cohen, Cedric the Entertainer, and Andy Richter return for the sequel, joined by Bernie Mac, Alec Baldwin, Sherri Shepherd, Elisa Gabrielli, and will.i.am.\n\nThe film begins by showing a small part of Alex's early life, including his capture by hunters, then moves to shortly after the point where \"Madagascar\" left off, with the animals deciding to return to New York City. They board an airplane in Madagascar but crash-land in Africa, where each of the central characters meets others of the same species and where Alex is reunited with his parents. Problems arise, and their resolution occupies much of the remainder of the film.\n\n\"Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa\" was released on November 7, 2008, by Paramount Pictures. It grossed $603.9 million on a $150 million budget, making it the sixth highest-grossing film of 2008, and won the 2009 Kids' Choice Award for Favorite Animated Movie. It was dedicated to Bernie Mac, who died before the film's release (by coincidence, another film of his, \"Soul Men\", would be released on the same date as this film.). A sequel, \"\", was released in 2012.\n\nIn Africa, Zuba the lion tries to teach his son Alakay how to fight, but the cub is more interested in dancing. Rival male Makunga challenges Zuba for the title of alpha lion, and during their fight Alakay is captured by poachers. The crate containing Alakay falls into the ocean and drifts to New York City, where he is renamed Alex and grows up at the Central Park Zoo with Marty the zebra, Melman the giraffe, and Gloria the hippopotamus.\n\nYears later, following their adventure in Madagascar, the zoo animals—Alex, Marty, Melman, Gloria, the penguins Skipper, Kowalski, Rico, and Private, and chimpanzees Mason and Phil—prepare to return to New York aboard a battered airplane piloted by the penguins, accompanied by the lemurs King Julien XIII the ring-tailed lemur, Maurice the aye-aye, and Mort the mouse lemur. The plane runs out of fuel and crash lands in continental Africa. The animals find themselves at a watering hole on a nature reserve, and are excited to meet others of their species. Alex is reunited with his parents and impresses them with tales of his status as \"the King of New York\". Marty fits in with a herd of other zebras who look and sound just like him. Melman, a hypochondriac, is distressed that the reserve has no doctors, so the other giraffes appoint him their witch doctor. Seeking romance, Gloria attracts the attention of the smooth-talking male hippopotamus, Moto Moto.\n\nMeanwhile, the penguins set about repairing the plane, assisted by numerous chimpanzees recruited by Mason and Phil. They steal vehicles from several groups of New Yorkers who are on safari and strip them for parts. Nana, a tough old woman who beat up Alex during the events of \"Madagascar\", takes charge of the stranded tourists and helps them survive in the wilderness.\n\nThe zoo animals' excitement soon turns to disappointment. In a scheme to oust Zuba as alpha lion, Makunga insists that Alex complete a rite of passage which Alex mistakes for a talent contest. It is actually a fighting contest, and Makunga tricks him into choosing the strongest lion as his opponent, resulting in Alex's humiliating defeat. Faced with the duty of banishing his son, Zuba relinquishes his title as alpha and Makunga takes over. Meanwhile, Marty is dejected by the realization that the other zebras can do everything he can, believing himself no longer unique. Melman comes to believe that he is deathly ill, and Gloria's interest in Moto Moto saddens him since he has secretly loved her for a long time. The four friends argue heatedly with one another. Gloria has a date with Moto Moto, but loses interest when she realizes he is only attracted to her because of her size. After a pep talk from King Julien, Melman finally reveals his feelings for Gloria.\n\nThe next day, the animals panic when the watering hole dries up. Determined to redeem himself, Alex mends his friendship with Marty and they leave the reserve to investigate upriver. King Julien suggests that offering a sacrifice to the nearby volcano will restore the water. Melman, forlorn and believing he is dying, volunteers to be sacrificed. Gloria stops him from jumping into the volcano, and realizes that he is the perfect guy for her. Alex and Marty discover that the stranded New Yorkers have built a camp and dammed up the river, and Alex is captured by them. Zuba rushes to his aid, but Alex saves them both by dancing for the tourists, who remember him fondly from the zoo. Marty, Melman, Gloria, the penguins, and the chimpanzees arrive in the repaired airplane and help Alex destroy the dam, restoring the water. Makunga angrily makes a stand for control, but Alex tricks him into being subdued by Nana. Zuba offers Alex the title of alpha lion, but he declines, and father and son become co-leaders.\n\nSkipper marries a bobblehead doll from the plane, and he, the other penguins, and the chimpanzees head off to honeymoon in Monte Carlo. Alex, Marty, Melman, Gloria, and the lemurs happily decide to stay on the reserve for a while.\n\nA sequel to \"Madagascar\" had been in development since 2005, when the first film had been released, with a release date planned for late 2008. In the first teaser trailer, which was released in March 2008, the film was subtitled with \"The Crate Escape\". By June 2008, the film was given its final title – \"Escape 2 Africa\".\n\nThe film received generally mixed to positive reviews from critics.

Another review aggregator, Metacritic classified the film into the \"generally favorable reviews\" category with 61/100 approval rating based on 25 reviews, also a bit higher a score than the original.\n\nMichael Phillips of the \"Chicago Tribune\" stated in his review that the film \"goes easy on the pop culture jokes, I should clarify: one of the smarter things in the script is how Alex, who digs his Bob Fosse and Jerome Robbins dance moves, becomes the film's primary pop-cult gag.\" Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film 3 stars and wrote \"This is a brighter, more engaging film than the original \"Madagascar\". Steven D. Greydanus complained the film's plot was similar to \"The Lion King\", \"Joe Versus the Volcano\", and \"Happy Feet\".

Now you have \"Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa\".\" John Anderson gave the film 3½ approval rating and stated \"\"Madagascar 2: Escape to Africa\", the sequel to the enormously successful DreamWorks adventure and a film that hews close to the whole \"Lion King\"/species-as-destiny/self-fulfillment paradigm.\"\n\nOn its opening day, the film grossed $17,555,027 from 4,056 theaters with an $4,328 average.

Some of the more famous performers include Kevin Parker, Rolf Harris, David Helfgott, Luke Steele and Tim Minchin. Notable artists in genres including rock, classical, and electronic music have lived in Perth.\n\nPerth's isolation is problematic for many rising artists, as it increases costs associated with touring and promotion. For this reason, many artists leave Perth to improve their popularity, with varying degrees of success.\n\nWhile most artists leave after achieving some popularity, some acclaimed performers only gained their fame after leaving, such as The Triffids and Pendulum.\n\nThe Perth International Arts Festival bills itself as the largest and longest-lasting multi-arts festival in Australia. Music institutions include the West Australian Opera, West Australian Symphony Orchestra, and numerous choral groups.\n\nPerth is also home to a major local scene, which has produced nationally and internationally renowned bands such as Tame Impala, Pond, Eskimo Joe, John Butler Trio, Gyroscope, Birds of Tokyo, End of Fashion, Turnstyle, Little Birdy, Jebediah, The Sleepy Jackson, Karnivool, Institut Polaire, The Panics, The Waifs, Knife Party and drum and bass acts like Pendulum.\n\nPerth's hip hop scene has produced artists such as Drapht, Downsyde, MC Layla, Matty B, Trooth and Lo-Key Fu. Many of these artists are members of the Perth hip hop crew named Syllabolix. A majority of Perth's premier emcees are featured on the Obese Records label. This connection has seen several Perth artists feature in the recordings of other Australian acts, such as The Hilltop Hoods.\n\nMany of Australia's critically acclaimed hardcore bands originated from Perth, including Extortion, Miles Away, Break Even, Rupture and Heist.\n\nThe Big Day Out, Soundwave and the West Coast Blues & Roots Festival are major popular music festivals regularly held in Perth or its suburbs.\n\nPerth is home to the West Australian Symphony Orchestra which performs a regular programme of orchestral music, usually from its base at the Perth Concert Hall; it also tours regional Western Australia. There are a large number of smaller professional, semi-professional and non-professional music groups and choral societies and choirs which perform in a variety of venues in and around Perth. Repertoire ranges from baroque to contemporary.\n\nThe West Australian Youth Music Association (or WAYMA), allows the youth of Perth to experience playing in a musical ensemble. Acceptance is only granted to amateur student players under the age of 25 years and who are currently under instrumental tutelage. The association runs a symphonic band, a flute choir, several choirs and four orchestras in total (two string orchestras and two symphony orchestras).\n\nMajor music venues in Perth include the Perth Concert Hall, the Burswood Dome, Perth Arena, Challenge Stadium, the Metropolis Concert Clubs in Fremantle and Perth, Fremantle Arts Centre, Belvoir Amphitheatre and the Red Hill Auditorium. Large international acts often play outdoors, in stadium venues like the WACA cricket ground, Subiaco Oval, Members Equity Stadium or Perth Oval. Festival events are generally held at Claremont Showgrounds or on the Perth Esplanade. The Supreme Court Gardens offer a large alternative outdoor venue, and have hosted such acts as David Bowie.\n\nMany former venues have been demolished, including wartime dancehalls such as The Tearooms and The Pagoda Ballroom. The Perth Entertainment Centre hosted many international acts until it was closed in 2002 and demolished in 2012. It has been replaced with the Perth Arena.\nOther venues, such as The Bakery, The Raffles Hotel, the Hyde Park Hotel, The Grosvenor, The Stoned Crow, Fitzgerald's, The Red Parrot and The Old Melbourne Hotel, have closed as music venues but have been redeveloped as restaurants, public bars or apartments.\n\nCurrent live music venues are predominantly located in the Fremantle and Perth/Northbridge entertainment districts.

Nueva ola bands usually had their names in English and rather than producing their own material they recorded versions of songs that were already popular in the United States or Europe. More than an artistic movement the nueva ola was an economic and social phenomenon that marked the beginning of youth culture and pop music in South America.\n\nArtists associated with the nueva ola reached their peak of popularity in the 1960s. Nueva ola music was contemporaneous with nueva canción, a style which, together with nueva ola, became the precursor to the rock en español scene that rose to prominence in the 1980s. During the '90s nueva ola music experienced a revival in Chile.\n\nIn 1960, RCA Victor general manager Ricardo Mejía discovered through a market research that there were almost no popular music stars among the youth. As a result, the company began the selection of new singers, initiating the phenomenon of the nueva ola in Argentina. Led by Mejía, RCA executives partnered with future journalist Leo Vanes and musicians Ray Nolan and Jimmy Lerman to create the TV show \"El club del clan\". Based on foreign music shows, each episode showed a group of friends that got together to perform various styles of music including rock 'n' roll (and the accompanying twist), bolero and cumbia. The personality of each interpreter was modeled taking into account the type of music they would sing. The show aired on Canal 13 on Saturdays at 8:30 pm, and proved to be extremely successful for RCA. It turned its young cast—which included Palito Ortega, Billy Caffaro, Violeta Rivas, Lalo Fransen, Nicky Jones and Cachita Galán—into the first national teen idols. Journalist Miguel Grinberg described \"El club del clan\" in 2006 as \"a kind of juvenile ebullition that, impelled by television, established a basic difference, that was young people who did not reproduce the music of their parents.\"\n\nIn 1964, after The Beatles' performances in the United States, Beatlemania also reached Argentina, generating the appearance of several bands that imitated their sound and fashion. The nueva ola was overshadowed by the popularity of British Invasion bands, while at the same time a feeling nonconformity grew among the youth, which saw the phenomenon as too carefree and compliant. Before the dissolution of the group and \"as a farewell,\" an \"El club del clan\" film directed by Enrique Carreras was released on March 12, 1964.\n\n"}

These theatres are smaller than Broadway theatres, but larger than Off-Off-Broadway theatres, which seat fewer than 100.\n\nAn \"Off-Broadway production\" is a production of a play, musical, or revue that appears in such a venue and adheres to related trade union and other contracts. Shows that premiere Off-Broadway are sometimes subsequently produced on Broadway.\n\nOriginally referring to the location of a venue and its productions on a street intersecting Broadway in Manhattan's Theater District, the hub of the theatre industry in New York, the term later became defined by the League of Off-Broadway Theatres and Producers as a professional venue in Manhattan with a seating capacity between 100 and 499 (inclusive) or a specific production that appears in such a venue and adheres to related trade union and other contracts.\n\nPreviously, regardless of the size of the venue, a theatre was considered a Broadway (rather than Off-Broadway) house if it was within the \"Broadway Box\", extending from 40th north to 54th Street and from Sixth Avenue west to Eighth Avenue, including Times Square and West 42nd Street. This change to the contractual definition of \"Off-Broadway\" benefited theatres satisfying the 499-seat criterion because of the lower minimum required salary for Actors' Equity performers at Off-Broadway theatres as compared with the salary requirements of the union for Broadway theatres. The adoption of the 499-seat criterion occurred after a one-day strike in January 1974. Examples of Off-Broadway theatres within the Broadway Box are the Laura Pels Theatre and The Theater Center.\n\nThe Off-Broadway movement started in the 1950s as a reaction to the perceived commercialism of Broadway and provided less expensive venues for shows that have employed hundreds of future Broadway artists. According to theatre historians Ken Bloom and Frank Vlastnik, Off-Broadway offered a new outlet for \"poets, playwrights, actors, songwriters, and designers. ... The first great Off-Broadway musical was the 1954 revival\" of \"The Threepenny Opera\", which proved that Off-Broadway productions could be financially successful. Theatre Row, on West 42nd Street between 9th and 10th Avenues in Manhattan, is a concentration of Off-Broadway and Off-Off-Broadway theatres. It was developed in the mid-1970s and modernized in 2002.\n\nMany Off-Broadway shows have had subsequent runs on Broadway, including such successful musicals as \"Hair\", \"Godspell\", \"Little Shop of Horrors\", \"Sunday in the Park with George\", \"Rent\", \"Grey Gardens\", \"Urinetown\", \"Avenue Q\", \"The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee\", \"Rock of Ages\", \"In the Heights\", \"Spring Awakening\", \"Next to Normal\", \"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\", \"Fun Home\", \"Hamilton\" and \"Dear Evan Hansen\". In particular, two that became Broadway hits, \"Grease\" and \"A Chorus Line\", encouraged other producers to premiere their shows Off-Broadway. Plays that have moved from Off-Broadway houses to Broadway include \"Doubt\", \"I Am My Own Wife\", \"Bridge & Tunnel\", \"The Normal Heart\", and \"Coastal Disturbances\". Other productions, such as \"Stomp\", \"Blue Man Group\", \"Altar Boyz\", \"Perfect Crime\", \"Forbidden Broadway\", \"Nunsense\", \"Naked Boys Singing\", \"\", and \"I Love You, You're Perfect, Now Change\" have had runs of many years Off-Broadway, never moving to Broadway. \"The Fantasticks\", the longest-running musical in theatre history, spent its original 42-year run Off-Broadway and began another long Off-Broadway run in 2006.\n\nOff-Broadway shows, performers, and creative staff are eligible for the following awards: the New York Drama Critics' Circle Award, the Outer Critics Circle Award, the Drama Desk Award, the Obie Award (presented since 1956 by \"The Village Voice\"), the Lucille Lortel Award (created in 1985 by the League of Off-Broadway Theatres & Producers), and the Drama League Award. Although Off-Broadway shows are not eligible for Tony Awards, an exception was made in 1956 (before the rules were changed), when Lotte Lenya won Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Musical for the Off-Broadway production of \"The Threepenny Opera\".\n\nCapacity is based on the capacity given for the respective theatre at the Internet Off-Broadway Database.\n"}

The novel debuted at No. 1 on \"The New York Times\" Fiction Best Sellers of 2015 list (combined print and e-book) dated 1 February 2015, and remained in the top position for 13 consecutive weeks, until April 2015. In January 2016 it became the No.1 best-seller again for two weeks. Many reviews referred to the book as \"the next \"Gone Girl\"\", referring to a popular 2012 psychological mystery with similar themes and use of unreliable narrators.\n\nBy early March 2015, the novel had sold over 1 million copies, and 1.5 million by April. It has occupied the number one spot of the UK hardback book chart for 20 weeks, the longest any book has ever held the top spot. By early August 2015, the book had sold more than 3 million copies in the US alone, and, by October 2016, an estimated 15 million copies worldwide. The audiobook edition, narrated by Clare Corbett, Louise Brealey and India Fisher (released by Books on Tape) won the 2016 Audie Award for Audiobook of the Year.\n\nThe film rights were acquired by DreamWorks Pictures in 2014 for Marc Platt Productions. The film adaptation, starring Emily Blunt and directed by Tate Taylor, was released on 7 October 2016.\n\nThe story is a first-person narrative told from the point of view of three women: Rachel, Anna, and Megan.\n\nRachel Watson is a 32-year-old alcoholic, reeling from the end of her marriage to Tom, who left her for another woman, Anna Watson. Rachel's drinking has caused her to lose her job; she frequently binges and has blackouts. While drunk, she often harasses Tom, though she has little or no memory of these acts once she sobers up. Tom is now married to Anna and has a daughter with her, Evie – a situation that fuels Rachel's self-destructive tendencies, as it was her inability to conceive a child that began her spiral into alcoholism. Rachel follows her old routine of taking the train to London everyday; her train slowly passes her old house, where Tom, Anna, and Evie now live. She also begins watching from the train an attractive couple who live a few houses away from Tom. She idealises their life (christening them \"Jason\" and \"Jess\"), though she has no idea that their life is far from perfect. The wife of the couple, Megan Hipwell (\"Jess\"), has a troubled past. She finds her life boring, and escapes from her troubles by taking a series of lovers. Megan has sought help by seeing a therapist, Dr. Kamal Abdic. Eventually, she reveals to him a dark secret she has never confided to anyone before.\n\nAnna is young, beautiful, in love with Tom, and happy as a stay-at-home mother to the young Evie. While at first she enjoyed the idea of showing off to Rachel that Tom picked her over Rachel, she eventually becomes furious at Rachel's harassment of her family. One day, Rachel is stunned to see Megan kissing another man. The next day, after heavy drinking, Rachel awakens to find herself bloody and injured, with no memories of the night before. She learns that Megan is missing, and is questioned by the police after Anna reports having seen her drunkenly staggering around the night of Megan's disappearance. Rachel becomes interested in the case and tells the police she thinks Megan was having an affair. She then contacts Megan's husband, Scott (\"Jason\") and tells him as well, lying that she and Megan were friends. Rachel learns that the man she saw kissing Megan was Kamal.\n\nRachel contacts Kamal, lying about her identity to get close to him and learn more about him. She makes a therapy appointment with him to see if he can help her recall the events that happened during her blackout that night. While Kamal suspects nothing, Rachel begins to gain insight into her life by speaking with him, inadvertently benefiting from the therapy. Her connections to Scott and Kamal, though built on lies, make her feel more important. She ends up not drinking for several days at a time but always relapses. Meanwhile, she continues to call, visit, and harass Tom. Megan's body is found; she is revealed to have been pregnant, and her unborn child was fathered by neither Scott nor Kamal. As Scott discovers Rachel's lies and lashes out at her, her memories become clearer. Rachel remembers seeing Megan get into Tom's car. Anna discovers that Tom and Megan were having an affair.\n\nRachel begins trusting her own memories more, and realises that many of the crazy things Tom told her she did while drunk never really happened. He had been gaslighting her for years, which made her question her sanity. Armed with this sad realisation, and the knowledge that he must have been the one who killed Megan, Rachel warns Anna. When Anna confronts him, Tom confesses to murdering Megan after she threatened to reveal that he had gotten her pregnant. Anna is cowed, fearing for her daughter's safety. Tom tries to beat and intimidate Rachel into keeping silent but she defies him and fights back. Knowing he is about to kill her, Rachel stabs Tom in the neck with a corkscrew. Anna helps Rachel make sure that he dies from the wound. When the police arrive, former adversaries Rachel and Anna support each other by co-ordinating their stories to explain their actions as self-defence. Finally free, Rachel decides to quit drinking and move on with her life. \n\n\"The Girl on the Train\" received mostly positive reviews from critics and audiences alike. In 2015 it became the fastest-selling adult hardcover novel in history, and it spent over four months on the \"New York Times\" Bestseller List following its release. \"Kirkus Reviews\" praised the novel with a starred review, writing that \"even the most astute readers will be in for a shock as Hawkins slowly unspools the facts, exposing the harsh realities of love and obsession's inescapable links to violence.\" Subsequently, the novel was honoured by \"Kirkus Reviews\" as one of the best books of 2015, in the fiction category. The book also won the 2015 Goodreads Choice Award in the category Mystery & Thriller.\n\nIn a less positive review for \"The New York Times\", Jean Hanff Korelitz questioned the novel's narrative structure and criticised the protagonist for behaving \"illogically, self-destructively, and narcissistically.\"\n\n\"The Girl on the Train\" has been compared frequently to \"Gone Girl\" by Gillian Flynn, as both novels employ unreliable narrators and deal with suburban life. Paula Hawkins has waved these comparisons off, however, saying in an interview with \"The Hollywood Reporter\": \"Amy Dunne is a psychopath, an incredibly controlling and manipulative, smart, cunning woman. [Rachel is] just a mess who can't do anything right.\"\n\nThe foreign rights have been sold in 34 countries, and the book has been translated into many languages, including:\nThe film rights for the novel were acquired in March 2014 by DreamWorks Pictures and Marc Platt Productions, with Jared Leboff (a producer at Marc Platt) set to produce. Tate Taylor, who directed \"The Help\" (2011), was announced as the director of this film in May 2015, with Erin Cressida Wilson as scriptwriter. In June 2015, British actress Emily Blunt was in talks to portray Rachel. Author Hawkins said in July 2015 that the film's setting would be moved from the UK to the US. The film began production in the New York City area in October 2015. The film was released on 7 October 2016. It remains mostly faithful to events in the book; the only distinct difference is that Rachel realises the truth about Tom's accusations of her behavior, not because of her own efforts, but through a chance meeting with the wife of Tom's former manager, who reveals that Tom was actually fired from his job because of his numerous affairs at the office, rather than Rachel's having a violent breakdown at a party (In reality, Rachel simply drank too much and passed out in a guest room, until Tom made her leave).\n\nA stage adaptation of the novel by Rachel Wagstaff and Duncan Abel made its world premiere in The Courtyard Theatre at the West Yorkshire Playhouse from 12 May to 9 June 2018. It stars Jill Halfpenny as Rachel Watson and is directed by Joe Murphy.\n\nReferences\n"}
{"id": "11946990", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11946990", "title": "Transformation playing card", "text": "Transformation playing card\n\nA transformation playing card (sometimes referred to as a transformation deck when assembled into a complete set) is a type of playing card where an artist incorporates the pips of the non-face cards into an artistic design. In a classical transformation playing card, the pips retain their standard position and coloration on the card. In some variations, the pips may be different in size, location or color. There is some debate as to whether these cards, often referred to as semi-transformed, should be considered true transformation playing cards.\n\nBy the 19th century, the standard form for playing cards had become fixed in most of Europe and America. French cards used hearts, diamonds, spades and clubs. German cards used acorns, leaves, hearts and bells. It was at this time that designers in Germany, France and England began to draw small figures around the pips.\n\nThe first transformation playing cards were created by D.W. Soltan and D. Berger in 1801 as illustrations for a German edition of Hudibras. The cards illustrated were the 2 of hearts, 3 of hearts, 5 of hearts and 8 of hearts. In 1803, John Nixon published the first complete set (52 cards) of transformed cards. Titled \"Metastasis\", this collection was also published as illustrations on sheets of paper. In 1804, J.C. Cotta, a publisher and bookseller in Tübingen, Germany, produced the first set of transformation cards that was published as an actual deck of playing cards. These decks were published as almanacs, in which each of the 52 cards corresponded to one of the 52 weeks of the year.\nIn 1865 Dean and Son published a deck in which the pips have been changed in both size and location, being placed at the artist's whim. Collectors debate as to whether or not this deck should be considered a transformation deck, due to these differences. The Dean and Son deck remained the only deck to manipuate the pips until the 1970s, when the practice gained some popularity. Today, cards that do not strictly adhere to standard pip placement, size and color are referred to as semi-transformation playing cards. \n\nAn article entitled \"Playing Card Squiggles.\" was published in the December 1910 issue of \"Strand Magazine\". Several \"Cotta\" cards were pictured, erroneously attributed to an unnamed French artist. \"Strand\" subsequently asked its readers to submit their own designs for card squiggles, which the magazine periodically published. John Butler Yeats was one of the first to contribute a card design to the magazine. The feature remained popular for some time.\n\nSome have estimated that around 70 different transformation decks were created throughout the entire nineteenth century, which by modern standards is a relatively small number. This period of time also witnessed progression with this art-form. By the late 19th century more colourful and creative transformation decks by Vanity Fair and Harlequin appeared, which showed pips incorporated into artwork that depicted people dining, skating, playing tennis and riding bicycles.\n\nTransformation playing cards like \"Art for the Earth\" by The Friends of the Earth and \"Under the Sea\" by the Marine Stewardship Counsel, are created for charity purposes, with different artists contributing art for each card. Similarly, other collective projects like \"Ultimate Deck\" from Dan & Dave and Stranger & Stranger or the series from Black Rock Collective brings multiple artists together to create semi-transformation decks.\n\nOne of the more notable contemporary sets is the award winning \"The Key to the Kingdom,\" a semi-transformation deck commissioned by London's V&A Museum of Childhood and created by Tony Meeuwissen. It won the WH Smith Literary Award for best illustration and The Designers and Art Directory Association of London gold award. This set of cards was created around the theme of nursery rhymes and poems. The cards were sold with a book containing each poem and a picture of the corresponding card on the opposite page. Additionally, the deck was constructed as a puzzle contest laid out in the form of an original poem. The poem gave clues to pick certain cards, which then could be decrypted into a secret message. The prize of $10,000 and a golden key was won by Susan Kavanagh of Essex.\n\nWith the advent of Kickstarter and other crowdfunded websites, individual artists are more easily able to bring transformation and semi-transformation decks to the public. Notable examples include the series of semi-transformation decks from Emmanuel Jose (including \"Curator\" and \"Clipped Wings\") and Dave Ufford's traditional transformation EclecDeck.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23895943", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23895943", "title": "Trials HD", "text": "Trials HD\n\nTrials HD is an Xbox Live Arcade game developed by RedLynx and published by Microsoft Game Studios. It was released on August 12, 2009 as part of the second annual Xbox Live Summer of Arcade and was later re-released in a retail pack alongside \"Limbo\" and \"'Splosion Man\" in April 2011. It is a 2.5D puzzle/racing game. The player must guide a trial motorcycle with exaggerated physics through various obstacles to reach each stage's finish line. On September 6, 2012 it was announced that a Microsoft Windows version of \"Trials HD\" would be bundled inside a special version of \"Trials Evolution\", dubbed \"Trials Evolution: Gold Edition\"—although this version changes the physics of the game. It is the third game in the series. On February 11, 2016, Microsoft added \"Trials HD\" as part of its backwards compatibility program for Xbox One.\n\nIn \"Trials HD\" the player controls a rider on a physics-based motorcycle from the start of the level to the end while navigating a number of obstacles. The objective is to complete the course as fast as possible and with as few crashes, known in the game as faults, as possible. The game uses 3D graphics, but is played on a 2D plane, so the rider can only move forwards and backwards. Players can also control the bike's pitch at slow speeds or while in the air.\n\nThe game has a variety of courses in a range of difficulties from beginner to extreme. There are a total of thirty-five courses in the game, and players can replay completed courses to attempt a faster time. Tournament mode sees the player attempt to complete a number of courses in sequence, trying to achieve a fast overall time with minimal faults. Twelve skill games can also be unlocked which place the player in different challenges. These include things such as riding inside or on top of a large spherical cage, achieving as many flips as possible within a set time limit, or towing a trailer with two large bombs as far as possible while keeping them from exploding by impact. Players earn medals based on their completion time, number of faults, and in the case of skill games, other specialized criteria.\n\nWhen connected to Xbox Live, the player can view their performance in relation to players in their friends list. This is done by an in-game meter which displays the closest friend to the player's time which adjusts based on whether the player is leading or trailing the friend's course time. \"Trials HD\" includes a level editor that allows players to construct their own courses and share them with players in their friends list. Every course in the game was created using the level editor, which allows users to create professional-quality levels. It also features leaderboards for each of the game's courses and modes. For each course the fastest five thousand times are able to be viewed as replays. During the replay the viewer can view that recorded player's controller presses, allowing them to learn patterns and skills from it.\n\n\"Trials HD\" is the second 2.5D game in the \"Trials\" series, following \"\". The game is based on the popular flash games from the same series. It was released on August 12, 2009 as part of the second annual Xbox Live Summer of Arcade. RedLynx developed \"Trials HD\" using an in-house engine coupled with a modified version of \"Bullet Physics Library\" which was optimized to utilize the Xbox 360's CPU and vector units. RedLynx applied the physics system to give a realistic feel, but to maintain the enjoyment of a video game, they tweaked the physics to \"bend the reality in just the proper way.\" RedLynx saw this as a \"crucial thing in making Trials such a fun and addictive game\" Previous \"Trials\" games used a much simpler in-house physics engine, however for \"Trials HD\" developers opted to use the \"Bullet\" library and devote one of the 360's cpu cores entirely to physics. Developers also improved on the \"Trials 2\" engine by adding more advanced lighting and real time soft shadows.\nLevels created for \"Trials HD\" were designed using the same in-game level editor that allows players to make user-based content. All of the tools and abilities the developers had at their disposal can be used by the community. In an interview with Eurogamer, RedLynx's Lead Programmer Sebastian Aaltonen stated that there were no plans to port the game to other platforms, adding \"\"Trials HD\" technology has been specially designed for the Xbox 360 feature-set.\" The voice work for the game was done by three Pennsylvanian voice actors, Rake Yohn, Brandon DiCamillo, and Art Webb.\n\n\"Trials HD\" was announced June 1, 2009 at a Microsoft luncheon during E3 2009. It was released August 12, 2009 as part of the Xbox Live Summer of Arcade. On December 23, 2009 the first downloadable content, known as the \"Trials HD Big Pack\", was released. The content features twenty three new courses, new objects for the game's built-in level creator and new achievements. A second downloadable content pack was announced for the game in July 2010. The \"Trials HD Big Thrills Pack\" features forty new courses made by RedLynx, but unlike the \"Trials HD Big Pack\" it also features ten user created courses. These ten courses are to be decided from entries to the Big Thrills Track Creation Competition. The top three contestants were awarded prizes of $5,000, $3,000, and $1,000, respectively. Winners were announced on November 15, 2010. The \"Big Thrills Pack\" was released December 1, 2010.\n\n\"Trials HD\" was generally well received by game critics. Aggregate websites GameRankings and Metacritic report average scores of 86.1% and 86/100, respectively. In its first month, the title sold over 300 thousand units. On September 14, 2010 RedLynx announced that \"Trials HD\" had surpassed 1.3 million units in sales. Sales of the first downloadable content pack have also exceeded 360 thousand, with the second pack selling over 90 thousand units. On May 27, 2011 RedLynx announced that sales have exceeded two million units. In 2009, \"Trials HD\" received two awards voted on by the Xbox 360 community, Best Overall Arcade Game and Best Innovation. In a September 2010 ranking, IGN listed \"Trials HD\" sixteenth in their top twenty-five Xbox Live Arcade titles of all time. It was also awarded a perfect score by \"Xbox World 360\" magazine.\n\nReviewers generally praised the game's replay value. IGN's Daemon Hatfield remarked that \"Trials HD\" had \"truckloads of content\" adding that the game's features \"really take advantage of what can be done with Xbox Live.\" GameTrailers staff also praised the amount of content in the game stating that it was an excellent value for the price. Eurogamer stated that \"it's a game built for endless replay and community expansion beyond that.\" The game's leaderboards, especially the ability to have a view of where other players were at a certain time during a run, were widely praised by Brad Shoemaker of Giant Bomb.\n\nOne of the primary criticisms given by critics was \"Trials HD\"s steep difficulty curve. Brad Shoemaker of Giant Bomb stated that he wished the difficulty curve was \"a little smoother.\" Daemon Hatfield of IGN further commented on the game's difficulty, stating \"It's when you get stuck trying to get over some small hill and you see that fault counter in the top left corner counting up [...] that the game starts being more frustrating than fun.\" GameSpy's Anthony Gallegos added that the \"limited number of tries per track feels arbitrary.\" He was also critical of the game's file sharing system, noting that instead of a repository from which to download tracks that sharing is limited to those in the player's friends list. Tom Mc Shea of GameSpot also agreed that the difficulty on the latter tracks was \"ridiculously hard\" and shared disappointment in the file sharing system.\n\n\n"}

The modern fair takes place in August (occasionally beginning late July) and lasts 11 days.\n\nThe first Wisconsin State Fair was held in 1851 in Janesville, with approximately 13,000 to 18,000 people in attendance. Sponsored by the state’s Agricultural Society, it was held on a six-acre plot along the banks of the Rock River. It featured a 200-pound squash and a quarter-acre plowing competition with teams of horses and oxen. It was reportedly the largest gathering in Wisconsin history.\n\nWhen the second fair was held in Milwaukee in 1852, fairgoers took their carriages for rides around the Cold Spring Race Course.\n\nAbraham Lincoln was invited to give the annual oration at the fair in 1859. He spoke on the principles of free labor - farmers and their families working for themselves without the use of hired labor - and of the interconnectedness of farmers, merchants, and other businesses. He advised farmers to embrace new methods of agriculture, with the goal of raising the standard of living.\n\nThe fair added new attractions each year, and in 1869, there was a fire engine demonstration where boxes, barrels and a large wooden building were set aflame. For decades, the fair moved from city to city, including Janesville, Watertown, Fond du Lac, Madison and Milwaukee, until 1892, when it was first held at its permanent and present location at Wisconsin State Fair Park.\n\nDuring the 2011 fair, some adolescent African Americans formed a violent flash mob and began attacking fairgoers, with some witnesses stating that the attacks were racially-motivated. Eighteen people, including seven police officers, were injured during the event. In response, fair managers added a youth curfew and worked with civic and youth leaders to prevent a recurrence.\n\nThe Milwaukee Mile is a one-mile paved oval racing circuit on the grounds of the State Fair. It is the oldest continuously-operated motor racing circuit in the world. Racing or exhibition events are often held on the circuit in conjunction with the state fair.\n\nYearly features at the fair include a wide variety of vendors, many local and national bands, the Kids From Wisconsin, and a large assortment of food and drink, including cream puffs, which are one of the fair's most popular attractions. In 2010, the Wisconsin State Fair introduced Comet 2, a forty-foot roller coaster. New in 2012, the Wisconsin State Fair took over the Midway, creating Spin City, a collection of independently contracted rides including the Sizzler, the Freak Out, and the Stratosphere, a 200-foot-tall swing ride.\n\nThe Main Stage features headline performance every evening of the fair. Many local bands can also be seen on smaller stages and pavilions located throughout the grounds.\n\nAgricultural exhibits of horses, cattle, sheep, chickens and other animals are featured every year at the fair.\n\nThe Wisconsin State Fair is also home of the Wisconsin Wine Garden. Established in 1996 by the then ten member-wineries of the Wisconsin Winery Association, the Wine Garden features wines from dozens of Wisconsin wineries.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
