The screenplay, written by Karen McCullah and Kirsten Smith, is a loose modernization of William Shakespeare's late-16th century comedy \"The Taming of the Shrew\", retold in a late-1990s American high school setting. In the story, new student Cameron (Gordon-Levitt) is smitten with Bianca Stratford (Oleynik) and, in order to get around her father's strict rules on dating, attempts to get bad boy Patrick (Ledger) to date Bianca's ill-tempered sister, Kat Stratford (Stiles). The film is titled after a poem written by Kat about her bittersweet romance with Patrick. Much of the filming took place in the Seattle metropolitan area, with many scenes shot at Stadium High School in Tacoma.\n\nReleased March 31, 1999, \"10 Things I Hate About You\" was number two at the domestic box office during its opening weekend, behind only \"The Matrix\", and was a moderate financial and critical success. It was a breakthrough role for Stiles, Ledger, and Gordon-Levitt, all of whom were nominated for various teen-oriented awards. Ten years later, the film was adapted into a television series of the same title, which ran for twenty episodes and featured Larry Miller reprising his role as the father, Walter Stratford, from the film.\n\nCameron James, a new student at Padua High School in the Seattle area, becomes instantly smitten with popular sophomore Bianca Stratford. Geeky Michael Eckman warns him that Bianca is vapid and conceited, and that her overprotective father does not allow Bianca or her older sister, the shrewish Kat, to date. Kat, a senior, is accepted to Sarah Lawrence College in New York, but her father, Walter, wants her to stay close to home. Bianca wishes to date affluent senior Joey Donner, but Walter, an obstetrician worrisome of teenage pregnancy, will not allow his daughters to date until they graduate. Frustrated by Bianca's insistence and Kat's rebelliousness, Walter declares that Bianca may date only when Kat does, knowing that Kat's antisocial attitude makes this unlikely.\n\nWhen Cameron asks Bianca out, she informs him of her father's new rule and, as a pretense for allowing her to date Joey, suggests that Cameron find someone willing to date Kat. Cameron selects \"bad boy\" Patrick Verona, but Patrick scares him off. Michael assists by convincing Joey to pay Patrick to take out Kat, under the pretense that this will allow Joey to date Bianca. Patrick agrees to the deal, but Kat rebuffs his first few advances. Michael and Cameron help him by prying Bianca for information on Kat's likes and dislikes. Armed with this knowledge, Patrick begins to win Kat's interest. She goes to a party with him, which enables Bianca to go as well, much to Walter's dismay.\n\nAt the party, Kat becomes upset when she sees Bianca with Joey, and responds by getting drunk. Patrick attends to her, and Kat starts to open up, expressing her interest in starting a band. However, when she tries to kiss him, Patrick pulls away and Kat leaves, infuriated. Meanwhile, Bianca ignores Cameron in favor of Joey, leaving Cameron dejected. Bianca soon realizes, however, that Joey is shallow and self-absorbed, and asks Cameron for a ride home. Cameron admits his feelings for her and his frustration with how she has treated him. Bianca responds by kissing him.\n\nJoey offers to pay Patrick to take Kat to the prom so he can take Bianca. Patrick initially refuses, but relents when Joey offers him more money. Kat is still angry with Patrick, but he wins her over by serenading her with the accompaniment of the marching band, and she helps him sneak out of detention. They go on a date which turns romantic, but Kat becomes suspicious and angry when Patrick insists that she go with him to the prom, an event she is adamantly against. Bianca is irritated that Cameron has not asked her to the prom, and so accepts Joey's invitation, but Walter will not allow it unless Kat goes too. Kat confesses to Bianca that she dated Joey when they were freshmen and, succumbing to peer pressure, had sex with him. Afterward she regretted it and Joey dumped her, so she vowed to never again do anything just because everyone else was doing it. Bianca insists that she can make her own choices, so Kat agrees to go to the prom with Patrick, and Bianca decides to go with Cameron instead of Joey.\n\nAll is going well at the prom until Bianca learns that Joey planned to have sex with her that night. Angry that Bianca has spurned him for Cameron, Joey reveals his arrangement with Patrick, which causes Kat to leave heartbroken. Joey then punches Cameron, but is in turn beaten up by Bianca for having hurt her, Kat, and Cameron. Bianca and Cameron share another kiss.\n\nThe next day, Bianca reconciles with Kat and begins dating Cameron. Walter admits that Kat is capable of taking care of herself, and gives her permission to attend Sarah Lawrence College. For an assignment in which the students were required to write their own version of William Shakespeare's Sonnet 141, Kat reads aloud a poem titled \"10 Things I Hate About You\", revealing that she still loves Patrick. Patrick surprises her with a guitar bought with the money that Joey paid him, and confesses that he has fallen for her. Kat forgives him, and the two reconcile with a kiss.\n\n\nMany of the scenes were filmed on location at Stadium High School and at a house in the Proctor District of Tacoma, Washington. The prom sequence was shot over three days in Seattle.\n\nCostume designer Kim Tillman designed original dresses for Larisa Oleynik and Julia Stiles as well as the period outfits for Susan May Pratt and David Krumholtz. Gabrielle Union's snakeskin prom dress is a Betsey Johnson design. Heath Ledger and Joseph Gordon-Levitt's vintage tuxes came from Isadora's in Seattle.\n\nThe primary tagline is an allusion to a poem written by Elizabeth Barrett Browning from her Sonnets from the Portuguese collection. (\"How do I loathe thee? Let me count the ways.\") Another tagline is a spoof from Shakespeare's \"Romeo and Juliet\" (\"Romeo, Oh Romeo, Get Out Of My Face.\") and another is a line from \"The Taming of the Shrew\" that is spoken in the film by Cameron (\"I burn, I pine, I perish!\"). The original script was finalized on November 12, 1997.\n\nIn its opening weekend, the film grossed US$8,330,681 in 2,271 theaters in the United States and Canada, averaging $3,668 per venue, and ranking number two at the box office (behind \"The Matrix\"). It grossed a total of $38,178,166 in the United States and Canada and $15,300,000 in other territories, about $53,500,000 worldwide. The film had an estimated budget of $16 million and is considered a moderate financial and critical success. On October 12, 1999, the Region 1 DVD was released. In the box office, the film is number ten in teen romance, 18th in high school comedies, and ranked 96th in comedies.\n\nThe film received generally positive feedback from critics. Geoff Andrew from \"Time Out\" praised the film's leads, stating \"Stiles grows into her character, and Ledger is effortlessly charming\". Brad Laidman from Film Threat said the film was \"pure of heart and perfectly executed.\" Ron Wells, another critic from Film Threat, expressed, \"Of all the teen films released this year, this one is, by far, the best.\" Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars out of four: \"Entertainment Weekly\" listed the film at #49 on its list of Best High School Movies.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film got a 61% from critics, based on 62 reviews, with a rating of 6.1/10. The website's critical consensus was: \"Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger add strong performances to an unexpectedly clever script, elevating \"10 Things\" (slightly) above typical teen fare.\"\n\n\"10 Things I Hate About You\" was a breakthrough role for stars Stiles, Ledger, and Gordon-Levitt. Gordon-Levitt, Stiles, and Oleynik each received Young Star Award nominations for Best Actor/Actress in a Comedy Film. The movie was nominated for seven Teen Choice Awards: Choice Movie: Breakout Star (Stiles), Choice Movie: Comedy, Choice Movie: Funniest Scene (featuring Krumholtz), Choice Movie: Love Scene (featuring Stiles and Ledger), Choice Movie: Hissy Fit (Gordon-Levitt), Choice Movie: Villain (Gordon-Levitt) and Choice Movie: Soundtrack. The film's casting directors Marcia Ross and Donna Morong won \"Best Casting for Feature Film, Comedy\" at the Casting Society of America in 1999. In 2000, Stiles won the CFCA Award for \"Most Promising Actress\" for her role as Kat Stratford (tied with Émilie Dequenne in \"Rosetta\") and an MTV Movie Award for Breakthrough Female Performance. The same year, Ledger was nominated for Best Musical Performance for the song \"Can't Take My Eyes Off You.\"\n\nThe soundtrack album features popular modern rock anthems from 1970s up to the late 1990s, including various covers from Letters to Cleo, who created modernised renditions of songs such as \"I Want You To Want Me\" by Cheap Trick and \"Cruel to Be Kind\" by Nick Lowe. The albums peak position in the Billboard (magazine) charts was 52nd, which was just after its release and it managed to hold a place in the Billboard top 200 for a total of 27 weeks. Artists such as The Notorious B.I.G. and Joan Jett were also used in the films soundtrack, although were not featured on the soundtrack album. The album was described by AllMusic as \"One of the best modern rock soundtracks of the spring 1999 season\".\n\nIn June 1999, the Scholastic Corporation published a novelization of the story, adapted by David Levithan. The story is retold as it is in the film with each chapter written from the point of view of either Bianca, Cameron, Kat, Patrick, or Michael.\n\nIn October 2008, ABC Family ordered a pilot episode of \"10 Things I Hate About You\", a half-hour, single-camera comedy series based on the feature film of the same name. Larry Miller is the only actor from the film to reprise his role in the television series. The director of the film, Gil Junger, directed many of the episodes including the pilot while the film's music composer, Richard Gibbs, also returned to do the show's music. The series was adapted and produced by Carter Covington. The show premiered on July 7, 2009, and lasted 20 episodes.\n\nThe film is a retelling of William Shakespeare's play \"The Taming of the Shrew\" in an American high school setting. Screenwriters Karen McCullah and Kirsten Smith also wrote the script for \"She's the Man\" (2006), a retelling of Shakespeare's play \"Twelfth Night\" set in an American college.\n\nKat and Bianca share the same names as the female leads in the original play. Their surname is Stratford, a nod to Shakespeare's birthplace. Patrick's surname Verona references the home of his relative character Petruchio. The characters attend Padua High School, named after where the play is set.\n\nCameron (Lucentio, who disguises himself as a tutor named Cambio) tutors Bianca in French and slips in a line from play while obsessing over her: \"I burn, I pine, I perish\". Patrick's character reflects the outlandish behavior of Petruchio, and Michael coerces Patrick into the marching band incident with the words from Sonnet 56: \"Sweet love, renew thy force\". The physicality of Petruchio and Katherina is transformed into a playful paintball match; the prom substitutes for the Act V feast; Kat's poem replaces Katherina's famous Act V speech; and Joey Donner's wager over Bianca's virginity parallels the bet placed by Shakespeare's husbands regarding their partners' obedience.\n\n"}

{"id": "37520827", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37520827", "title": "Antenarrative", "text": "Antenarrative\n\nAntenarrative is the process by which retrospective narrative is linked to living story. While aspects of this process have been studied by other disciplines under other names for centuries, the term \"antenarrative\", coined by David Boje in 2001, has four primary uses. The first two uses of antenarrative are as the before(ante)-narrative, existing as story is turned to narrative, and a bet (ante) narrative, placed in hopes that something will become a retrospective narrative. The other two uses are spiral and rhizome antenarratives.\n\nResearch in the journal, Organization Science, has recently found a number of nationally oriented antenarratives that are utilized in cross border mergers and acquisitions. Other scholars that have utilized antenarrative include Barge 2004; Collins & Rainwater, 2005; Durant, Gardner & Taylor, 2006; Vickers, 2005; Yolles, 2007; Grow 2009.\n\nThe antenarrative is pre-narrative, a bet that a fragmented polyphonic story will make retrospective, narrative, sense in the future. In a recent description of the bet aspect of antenarrative Karl Weick has said \"To talk about antenarrative as a bet is also to invoke an important structure in sense-making; namely, the presumption of logic (Meyer, 1956). ‘Without faith in the purpose- fulness of, and rationality of art, listeners would abandon their attempts to understand, to reconcile deviants to what has gone before or to look for their raison d’être in what is still to come’ (1956: 75).\". Antenarratives serve a similar purpose. The process of moving from the nebulous and chaotic story to a narrative with a beginning middle and end is the antenarrative faith that story fragments will make retrospective sense some time in the future.\n\nSpiral antenarrative goes beyond linear and cybernetic, closed signal loop, systems. Instead it utilizes the dialectic of deviation-amplification and deviation counteraction to show dynamically changing meanings. This is where antenarrative participates with heteroglossia. As David Boje says \"This is a connection between more immediate-emergence-sensemaking and a prospective-sensemaking that anticipated a possible future by enacting particular sorts of actions of caring and in-Being involved, for a while, iteratively.\" Spirals are like circles except in that the variability of the trajectory is, itself, dissymetrical Meaning that, unlike cycles, that which is part of the new spiral may be made up of, and utilize things unrelated to, the previous iteration.\n\nRhizomeatic/assemblage antenarrative, is the antenarrative process that is not theoretically causal, but rather combinatorial. It builds on the theoretical tradition of quallia which allows for assemblages of interacting processes. When a narrative is forming but still maintains a level of ambiguity regarding the multiple linear potentials, all of which interact during the formation, then the antenarrative is rhizomatic. As David Boje has said: from a storytelling method standpoint, \"an assemblage (rhizome) has visible runners and invisible roots that connect agents (usually people, but also animals, and the fire of the forge) with actants (usually material things, such as the iron, the carbon, the subatomic stuff). Agents and actants, people and things, are networked together by their runners and rooting connectivity.\" This shows a kind of rhizome-ontology that can be found amongst various actors and actants.\n\n"}

{"id": "1160944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1160944", "title": "Buddy the Gob", "text": "Buddy the Gob\n\nBuddy the Gob is an American animated short film, produced and released by Warner Bros. on January 13, 1934. It is a \"Looney Tunes\" cartoon, featuring Buddy, the second star of the series. It was the first cartoon supervised by Friz Freleng; the musical score is by Norman Spencer. The theme music played at the beginning is \"Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean.\"\n\nA great Navy gunboat sails toward the audience and fires her weapons; several other ships go on behind it. Buddy is a \"gob\", a sailor onboard one of the ships, and is excited to see that they have made port in China. Jumping from the side of his ship and into a rowboat, Our Hero makes his way to land.\n\nIn the Chinese city, now, we see that a large woman carries her four children, attached by their hair to a pole straddled across her shoulders; Buddy turns a corner and sees an older gentleman expand and compress himself vertically in order to read a poster on the side of a building; when the man has left, Buddy goes to read the message, which converts, for our benefit, into English: \"Grand Celebration To-day: the 150th Birthday Anniversary of the Sacred Dragon: a beautiful girl will be sacrificed to the Dragon. Come one! Come all!\" Leaping from straw hat-to-straw hat of five men arranged from back-to-front in ascending order of height, Buddy manages to see the grand celebration: a baton wielder bounces his belly; a drum, held by two marchers, is host to six tiny people who jump upon it; in addition to trumpeters and tiny men whose hats double as cymbals, the procession happens to include a pianist! One of the masked dancers in the parade is a caricature of Jimmy Durante (a favorite target of Warner Bros. cartoons of the time.)\n\nThen we see the young girl to be sacrificed, in her cage, carried by two marchers; she begs for help and weeps. Buddy is not about to let the ritual occur. But when he attempts to enter the temple into which the girl has been taken, he is ejected from the very steps by spear, and thus caught on a wall by the seat of his pants. Once free, Our Hero hears the girl's screams from a window several stories above him. When his attempt at propelling himself to the window by means of the spear fails, Buddy simply picks up a piece of a gate and fires the spear-like points of it, as though they were arrows, at the wall of the prison-temple, thereby forming a series of steps up which he can easily walk to reach the girl's holding cell.\n\nThe girl's keeper locks her cuffs, swallows the key, and steps out of the room, leaving the girl to be terrified by the imprisoned, fire-breathing dragon across the room from her. Buddy enters, but can not seem to break the lock; so he knocks on the door, and stands aside, picking up a nearby barrel: the keeper steps inside, and Buddy slams the barrel over the villain's head and body, dazing him. A swift kick in the pants, and the jailer coughs up the key. The brave little sailor frees the girl, but no sooner does he that than the bars entrapping the dragon rise and free the beast. At Buddy's direction, the girl leaps from the window to a waiting rickshaw beneath: Buddy, after enduring the dragon's flame on his behind, follows. \n\nAs the vehicle speedily makes away, a throng of angry, spear-wielding people notice that their sacrifice is escaping! When their rickshaw breaks upon hitting a rock, the driver himself becomes the escape vehicle, off of which Buddy and the girl get, preferring to run. They come to a bridge of wooden planks, suspended by ropes tied to stakes. Once on the bridge, Buddy, the rescued girl at his side, severs the ropes with a saw; the two run across as the bridge just as surely as it falls, plank-by-plank, behind them. From one side of the valley, the angry people helplessly protest the escape as Buddy and the girl tease their pursuers. One such pursuer hurls his spear all the way across; dodging this, the two continue to tease, but the spear, imbued with malevolent life, turns about and pricks Buddy's rear end before falling, lifeless, to the ground. A victorious but dazed Buddy stares into the camera as the cartoon ends.\n\nThe opening scene, in which the ship sails towards the camera and fires her guns, is recycled for a cinematic sequence in 1935's \"Buddy's Theatre\".\nAlso the Mice play Yankee Doodle of the Drums was reused from \"It's Got Me Again!\".\n\n\n"}

He grew up an orphan in the London area. At some point he came to the United States and played first violin at the Grand Opera House in Chicago in the 1890s.\n\nHe married his second wife, Cornelia Helen (d. September 25, 1933, known as \"Helen\") on December 24, 1897. After his marriage he stayed in Chicago a short time to teach violin students. In 1898 he relocated to New York City, the only major recording center of the time.\n\nOne of the earliest violinists to make recordings, D'Almaine's first (\"\") was recorded in 1899 and released on Edison cylinder #7324. He went to the Berliner Gramophone studios in January and February 1900, where at least 13 of his recordings were issued. When a standing orchestra was established at the Edison studios, D'Almaine was made concertmaster.\n\nBeginning his association with the Victor company in 1901, he eventually became concertmaster of the house unit, the Victor Orchestra. He also made recordings for Columbia, where sometimes the pseudonym Charles Gordon was used. His musical duties outside the recording studio included positions at the Metropolitan Opera House. In addition to performing, he also made several violins.\n\nIn April 1914 he and his wife Helen enrolled at the Palmer College of Chiropractic in Davenport, Iowa, where he obtained his Doctor of Chiropractic. He made his final recordings for Pathé Records. He and his wife operated chiropractic practices in New York City and Newark, New Jersey.\n\nIn addition to his medical duties, he continued his musical career. He was second-violinist with the New York Metropolitan Opera orchestra. for the 1921–1922 season, and was employed there until the 1924–1925 season in the violin section. He was released, having spent 17 years at the Met, when a new conductor brought in many new players he was familiar with. D'Almaine spent the following summer season with the Arthur Pryor band. His last professional musical activity was to tour with Harry Lauder, after which he abandoned music to devote himself to his chiropractic practice. On June 17, 1943 he died, childless, in Newark, and was cremated.\n\nMany of D'Almaine's recordings used the Stroh violin, and he was the first to record using that instrument. In addition to classical pieces and straight renditions of popular songs, his output of fiddle-tunes was significant to the genre, often because of Edison's penchant for marketing to rural markets. D'Almaine was the fiddle player on Len Spencer's immensely popular \"Arkansas Traveler\", as well as the first to record \"The Irish Washerwoman\" (1904), \"Flowers of Edinburgh\" (1905), and \"Tom and Jerry\" (1905). He also made novelty records such as \"Donkey and Driver\", which includes sound effects generated on his instrument. As the violin soloist of choice for Victor Records and Edison Records, D'Almaine's output was prolific. His wide repertoire and varied duties demanded a formidable technique, which he rarely got to fully display; the most virtuosic of his \"classical\" recordings is probably his 1906 rendition of Jean-Delphin Alard's \"Brindisi-Valse\" for violin and piano, opus 49 no. 16 (recorded with orchestral accompaniment and released as Victor 31542). He also recorded for Berliner Gramophone, Columbia Records, and other, smaller companies. Among his most popular recordings were \"Shepherd's Dance\", a 1902 release on cylinder for Edison, and \"Medley of Old-Time Reels\", a 1906 release on a 12-inch Victor disc.\n\n"}
{"id": "6231", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6231", "title": "Comic book", "text": "Comic book\n\nA comic book or comicbook, also called comic magazine or simply comic, is a publication that consists of comic art in the form of sequential juxtaposed panels that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form. Although some origins in 18th century Japan, comic books were first popularized in the United States and the United Kingdom during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, \"Famous Funnies\", was released in the U.S. in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics. The term \"comic book\" derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone.\n\nThe largest comic book market is Japan. By 1995, the manga market in Japan was valued at (), with annual sales of 1.9billion manga books/magazines in Japan (equivalent to 15issues per person). The comic book market in the United States and Canada was valued at in 2016. , the largest comic book publisher in the United States is manga distributor Viz Media, followed by DC Comics and Marvel Comics. Another major comic book market is France, where Franco-Belgian comics and Japanese manga each represent 40% of the market, followed by American comics at 10% market share.\n\nComic books are reliant on their organization and appearance. Authors largely focus on the frame of the page, size, orientation, and panel positions. These characteristic aspects of comic books are necessary in conveying the content and messages of the author. The key elements of comic books include panels, balloons (speech bubbles), text (lines), and characters. Balloons are usually convex spatial containers of information that are related to a character using a tail element. The tail has an origin, path, tip, and pointed direction. Key tasks in the creation of comic books are writing, drawing, and coloring.\n\nComics as a print medium have existed in America since the printing of \"The Adventures of Mr. Obadiah Oldbuck\" in 1842 in hardcover, making it the first known American prototype comic book. Proto-comics periodicals began appearing early in the 20th century, with historians generally citing Dell Publishing's 36-page \"Famous Funnies: A Carnival of Comics\" as the first true American comic book; Goulart, for example, calls it \"the cornerstone for one of the most lucrative branches of magazine publishing\". The introduction of Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster's Superman in 1938 turned comic books into a major industry and ushered the Golden Age of Comics. The Golden Age originated the archetype of the superhero.According to historian Michael A. Amundson, appealing comic-book characters helped ease young readers' fear of nuclear war and neutralize anxiety about the questions posed by atomic power.\n\nHistorians generally divide the timeline of the American comic book into eras. The Golden Age of Comic Books began in the 1930s; which is generally considered the beginning of the comic book that we know today. The Silver Age of comic books is generally considered to date from the first successful revival of the then-dormant superhero form, with the debut of the Flash in \"Showcase\" #4 (Oct. 1956). The Silver Age lasted through the late 1960s or early 1970s, during which time Marvel Comics revolutionized the medium with such naturalistic superheroes as Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's Fantastic Four and Lee and Steve Ditko's Spider-Man. The demarcation between the Silver Age and the following era, the Bronze Age of Comic Books, is less well-defined, with the Bronze Age running from the very early 1970s through the mid-1980s. The Modern Age of Comic Books runs from the mid-1980s to the present day.\n\nA notable event in the history of the American comic book came with psychiatrist Fredric Wertham's criticisms of the medium in his book \"Seduction of the Innocent\" (1954), which prompted the American Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency to investigate comic books. In response to attention from the government and from the media, the U.S. comic book industry set up the Comics Magazine Association of America. The CMAA instilled the Comics Code Authority in 1954 and drafted the self-censorship Comics Code that year, which required all comic books to go through a process of approval. It was not until the 1970s that comic books could be published without passing through the inspection of the CMAA. The Code was made formally defunct in November 2011.\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, a surge of creativity emerged in what became known as underground comix. Published and distributed independently of the established comics industry, most of such comics reflected the youth counterculture and drug culture of the time. Many had an uninhibited, often irreverent style; their frank depictions of nudity, sex, profanity, and politics had no parallel outside their precursors, the pornographic and even more obscure \"Tijuana bibles\". Underground comics were almost never sold at newsstands, but rather in such youth-oriented outlets as head shops and record stores, as well as by mail order.\n\nFrank Stack's \"The Adventures of Jesus\", published under the name Foolbert Sturgeon, has been credited as the first underground comic; while R. Crumb and the crew of cartoonists who worked on \"Zap Comix\" popularized the form.\n\nThe rise of comic book specialty stores in the late 1970s created/paralleled a dedicated market for \"independent\" or \"alternative comics\" in the U.S. The first such comics included the anthology series \"Star Reach\", published by comic book writer Mike Friedrich from 1974 to 1979, and Harvey Pekar's \"American Splendor\", which continued sporadic publication into the 21st century and which Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini adapted into a 2003 film. Some independent comics continued in the tradition of underground comics. While their content generally remained less explicit, others resembled the output of mainstream publishers in format and genre, but were published by smaller artist-owned companies or by single artists. A few (notably \"RAW\") represented experimental attempts to bring comics closer to the status of fine art.\n\nDuring the 1970s the \"small press\" culture grew and diversified. By the 1980s, several independent publishers - such as Pacific, Eclipse, First, , and Fantagraphics - had started releasing a wide range of styles and formats—from color-superhero, detective, and science-fiction comic books to black-and-white magazine-format stories of Latin American magical realism.\n\nA number of small publishers in the 1990s changed the format and distribution of their comics to more closely resemble non-comics publishing. The \"minicomics\" form, an extremely informal version of self-publishing, arose in the 1980s and became increasingly popular among artists in the 1990s, despite reaching an even more limited audience than the small press.\n\nSmall publishers regularly releasing titles include Avatar Comics, Hyperwerks, Raytoons, and Terminal Press, buoyed by such advances in printing technology as digital print-on-demand.\n\nIn 1964, Richard Kyle coined the term \"graphic novel\". Precursors of the form existed by the 1920s, which saw a revival of the medieval woodcut tradition by Belgian Frans Masereel, American Lynd Ward and others, including Stan Lee.\nIn 1950, St. John Publications produced the digest-sized, adult-oriented \"picture novel\" \"It Rhymes with Lust\", a 128-page digest by pseudonymous writer \"Drake Waller\" (Arnold Drake and Leslie Waller), penciler Matt Baker and inker Ray Osrin, touted as \"an original full-length novel\" on its cover. In 1971, writer-artist Gil Kane and collaborators devised the paperback \"comics novel\" \"Blackmark\". Will Eisner popularized the term \"graphic novel\" when he used it on the cover of the paperback edition of his work \"A Contract with God, and Other Tenement Stories\" in 1978.\n\nIn 2017, the comic book market size for North America was just over $1 billion with digital sales being flat, book stores having a 1 percent decline, and comic book stores having a 10 percent decline over 2016.\n\nThe 1970s saw the advent of specialty comic book stores. Initially, comic books were marketed by publishers to children because comic books were perceived as children's entertainment. However, with increasing recognition of comics as an art form and the growing pop culture presence of comic book conventions, they are now embraced by many adults.\n\nComic book collectors are often lifelong enthusiasts of the comic book stories, and they usually focus on particular heroes and attempt to assemble the entire run of a title. Comics are published with a sequential number. The first issue of a long-running comic book series is commonly the rarest and most desirable to collectors. The first appearance of a specific character, however, might be in a pre-existing title. For example, Spider-Man's first appearance was in \"Amazing Fantasy\" #15. New characters were often introduced this way, and did not receive their own titles until there was a proven audience for the hero. As a result, comics that feature the first appearance of an important character will sometimes be even harder to find than the number 1 issue of a character's own title.\n\nSome rare comic books include copies of the unreleased \"Motion Picture Funnies Weekly\" #1 from 1939. Eight copies, plus one without a cover, emerged in the estate of the deceased publisher in 1974. The \"Pay Copy\" of this book sold for $43,125 in a 2005 Heritage auction.\n\nThe most valuable American comics have combined rarity and quality with the first appearances of popular and enduring characters. Four comic books have sold for over $1 million USD , including two examples of Action Comics #1, the first appearance of Superman, both sold privately through online dealer ComicConnect.com in 2010, and Detective Comics #27, the first appearance of Batman, via public auction.\n\nUpdating the above price obtained for \"Action Comics\" #1, the first appearance of Superman, the highest sale on record for this book is $3.2 million, for a 9.0 copy. \n\nMisprints, promotional comic-dealer incentive printings, and issues with extremely low distribution also generally have scarcity value. The rarest modern comic books include the original press run of \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\" #5, which DC executive Paul Levitz recalled and pulped due to the appearance of a vintage Victorian era advertisement for \"Marvel Douche\", which the publisher considered offensive; only 100 copies exist, most of which have been CGC graded. (See Recalled comics for more pulped, recalled, and erroneous comics.)\n\nIn 2000, a company named Comics Guaranty (CGC) began to \"slab\" comics, encasing them in a thick plastic and giving them a numeric grade. , there are two companies that provide third party grading of comic book condition. Because condition is so important to the value of rare comics, the idea of grading by a company that does not buy or sell comics seems like a good one. However, there is some controversy about whether this grading service is worth the high cost, and whether it is a positive development for collectors, or if it primarily services speculators who wish to make a quick profit trading in comics as one might trade in stocks or fine art. Comic grading has created valuation standards that online price guides such as GoCollect and GPAnalysis have used to report on real-time market values.\n\nThe original artwork pages from comic books are also collected, and these are perhaps the rarest of all comic book collector's items, as there is only one unique page of artwork for each page that was printed and published. These were created by a writer, who created the story; a pencil artist, who laid out the sequential panels on the page; an ink artist, who went over the pencil with pen and black ink; a letterer, who provided the dialogue and narration of the story by hand lettering each word; and finally a colorist, who added color as the last step before the finished pages went to the printer.\n\nWhen the original pages of artwork are returned by the printer, they are typically given back to the artists, who sometimes sell them at comic book conventions, or in galleries and art shows related to comic book art. The original pages of the first appearances of such legendary characters as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and Spider-man are considered priceless.\n\nThe first comic books in Japan appeared during the 18th century in the form of woodblock-printed booklets containing short stories drawn from folk tales, legends, and historical accounts, told in a simple visual-verbal idiom. Known as , , and , these were written primarily for less literate readers. However, with the publication in 1775 of Koikawa Harumachi's comic book , an evolved form of comic book originated, which required greater literacy and cultural sophistication. This was known as the . Published in thousands of copies, the \"kibyōshi\" may have been the earliest fully realized comic book for adults in world literary history. Approximately 2,000 titles remain extant.\n\nModern comic books in Japan developed from a mixture of these earlier comic books and of woodblock prints with Western styles of drawing. They took their current form shortly after World War II. They are usually published in black-and-white, except for the covers, which are usually printed in four colors, although occasionally, the first few pages may also be printed in full color. The term \"manga\" means \"random (or whimsical) pictures\", and first came into common usage in the late 18th century with the publication of such works as Santō Kyōden's picturebook (1798) and Aikawa Minwa's \"Comic Sketches of a Hundred Women\" (1798). During the Meiji period, the term \"Akahon\" was also common.\n\nWestern artists were brought over to teach their students such concepts as line, form, and color; these were things which had not been regarded as conceptually important in \"ukiyo-e\", as the idea behind the picture was of paramount importance. Manga at this time was referred to as \"Ponchi-e\" (Punch-picture) and, like its British counterpart \"Punch\" magazine, mainly depicted humor and political satire in short one- or four-picture format.\n\nDr. Osamu Tezuka (1928–1989) further developed this form. Seeing an animated war propaganda film titled inspired Tezuka to become a comic artist. He introduced episodic storytelling and character development in comic format, in which each story is part of larger story arc. The only text in Tezuka's comics was the characters' dialogue and this further lent his comics a cinematic quality. Inspired by the work of Walt Disney, Tezuka also adopted a style of drawing facial features in which a character's eyes, nose, and mouth are drawn in an extremely exaggerated manner. This style created immediately recognizable expressions using very few lines, and the simplicity of this style allowed Tezuka to be prolific. Tezuka's work generated new interest in the \"ukiyo-e\" tradition, in which the image is a representation of an idea, rather than a depiction of reality.\n\nThough a close equivalent to the American comic book, manga has historically held a more important place in Japanese culture than comics have in American culture. Japanese society shows a wide respect for manga, both as an art form and as a form of popular literature. Many manga become television shows or short films. As with its American counterpart, some manga has been criticized for its sexuality and violence, although in the absence of official or even industry restrictions on content, artists have freely created manga for every age group and for every topic.\n\nManga magazines—also known as \"anthologies\"—often run several series concurrently, with approximately 20 to 40 pages allocated to each series per issue. These magazines range from 200 to more than 850 pages each. Manga magazines also contain one-shot comics and a variety of four-panel yonkoma (equivalent to comic strips). Manga series may continue for many years if they are successful, with stories often collected and reprinted in book-sized volumes called , the equivalent of the American trade paperbacks. These volumes use higher-quality paper and are useful to readers who want to be brought up to date with a series, or to readers who find the cost of the weekly or monthly publications to be prohibitive. Deluxe versions are printed as commemorative or collectible editions.\n\n, fan-made Japanese comics, operate in a far larger market in Japan than the American \"underground comics\" market; the largest dōjinshi fair, Comiket, attracts 500,000 visitors twice a year.\n\nKorean manhwa have quickly gained popularity outside Korea in recent times as a result of the Korean Wave. The manhwa industry has suffered through two crashes and strict censorship since its early beginnings as a result of the Japanese occupation of the peninsula which stunt the growth of the industry but has now started to flourish thanks in part to the internet and new ways to read manhwa whether on computers or through smartphones. In the past manhwa would be marketed as manga outside the country in order to make sure they would sell well but now that is no longer needed since more people are now more knowledgeable about the industry and Korean culture.\n\nWebtoons have become popular in South Korea as a new way to read comics. Thanks in part to different censorship rules, color and unique visual effects, and optimization for easier reading on smartphones and computers. More manhwaga have made the switch from traditional print manhwa to online webtoons thanks to better pay and more freedom than traditional print manhwa. The webtoon format has also expanded to other countries outside of Korea like China, Japan, Southeast Asia, and Western countries. Major webtoon distributors include Lezhin, Naver, and Kakao.\n\n \nFrance and Belgium have a long tradition in comics and comic books, called \"BDs\" (an abbreviation of \"bande dessinées\") in French and \"strips\" in Dutch. Belgian comic books originally written in Dutch show the influence of the Francophone \"Franco-Belgian\" comics, but have their own distinct style.\n\nThe name \"bande dessinée\" derives from the original description of the art form as drawn strips (the phrase literally translates as \"the drawn strip\"), analogous to the sequence of images in a film strip. As in its English equivalent, the word \"bande\" can be applied to both film and comics. Significantly, the French-language term contains no indication of subject-matter, unlike the American terms \"comics\" and \"funnies\", which imply an art form not to be taken seriously. The distinction of comics as \"le neuvième art\" (literally, \"the ninth art\") is prevalent in French scholarship on the form, as is the concept of comics criticism and scholarship itself. Relative to the respective size of their populations, the innumerable authors in France and Belgium publish a high volume of comic books. In North America, the more serious Franco-Belgian comics are often seen as equivalent to graphic novels, but whether they are long or short, bound or in magazine format, in Europe there is no need for a more sophisticated term, as the art's name does not itself imply something frivolous.\n\nIn France, authors control the publication of most comics. The author works within a self-appointed time-frame, and it is common for readers to wait six months or as long as two years between installments. Most books first appear in print as a hardcover book, typically with 48, 56, or 64 pages.\n\nAlthough \"Ally Sloper's Half Holiday\" (1884) was aimed at an adult market, publishers quickly targeted a younger demographic, which has led to most publications being for children and has created an association in the public's mind of comics as somewhat juvenile. \"The Guardian\" refers to Ally Sloper as “one of the world’s first iconic cartoon characters”, and “as famous in Victorian Britain as Dennis the Menace would be a century later.” British comics in the early 20th century typically evolved from illustrated penny dreadfuls of the Victorian era (featuring Sweeney Todd, Dick Turpin and \"Varney the Vampire\"). First published in the 1830s, penny dreadfuls were “Britain’s first taste of mass-produced popular culture for the young.”\nThe two most popular British comic books, \"The Beano\" and \"The Dandy\", were first published by DC Thomson in the 1930s. By 1950 the weekly circulation of both reached two million. Explaining the enormous popularity of comics in British popular culture during this period, Anita O'Brien, director curator at London's Cartoon Museum, states: “When comics like the Beano and Dandy were invented back in the 1930s - and through really to the 1950s and 60s - these comics were almost the only entertainment available to children.\" The “world’s naughtiest schoolboy”, \"Dennis the Menace\" was created in the 1950s, which saw sales for \"The Beano\" soar. He features in the cover of \"The Beano\", with the BBC referring to him as the “definitive naughty boy of the comic world.” \n\nIn 1954, \"Tiger\" comics introduced \"Roy of the Rovers\", the hugely popular football based strip recounting the life of Roy Race and the team he played for, Melchester Rovers. The stock media phrase \"real 'Roy of the Rovers' stuff\" is often used by football writers, commentators and fans when describing displays of great skill, or surprising results that go against the odds, in reference to the dramatic storylines that were the strip's trademark. Other comic books such as \"Eagle\", \"Valiant\", \"Warrior\", \"Viz\" and \"2000 AD\" also flourished. Some comics, such as \"Judge Dredd\" and other \"2000 AD\" titles, have been published in a tabloid form. Underground comics and \"small press\" titles have also appeared in the UK, notably \"Oz\" and \"Escape Magazine\".\n\nThe content of \"Action\", another title aimed at children and launched in the mid-1970s, became the subject of discussion in the House of Commons. Although on a smaller scale than similar investigations in the U.S., such concerns led to a moderation of content published within British comics. Such moderation never became formalized to the extent of promulgating a code, nor did it last long. The UK has also established a healthy market in the reprinting and repackaging of material, notably material originating in the U.S. The lack of reliable supplies of American comic books led to a variety of black-and-white reprints, including Marvel's monster comics of the 1950s, Fawcett's Captain Marvel, and other characters such as Sheena, Mandrake the Magician, and the Phantom. Several reprint companies became involved in repackaging American material for the British market, notably the importer and distributor Thorpe & Porter. Marvel Comics established a UK office in 1972. DC Comics and Dark Horse Comics also opened offices in the 1990s. The repackaging of European material has occurred less frequently, although \"The Adventures of Tintin\" and \"Asterix\" serials have been successfully translated and repackaged in softcover books.\n\nIn the 1980s, a resurgence of British writers and artists gained prominence in mainstream comic books, which was dubbed the \"British Invasion\" in comic book history. These writers and artists brought with them their own mature themes and philosophy such as anarchy, controversy and politics common in British media. These elements would pave the way for mature and \"darker and edgier\" comic books and jump start the Modern Age of Comics. Writers included Alan Moore, famous for his \"V for Vendetta\", \"From Hell\", \"Watchmen\", \"Marvelman\", and \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\"; Neil Gaiman with \"The Sandman\" mythos and \"Books of Magic\"; Warren Ellis, creator of \"Transmetropolitan\" and \"Planetary\"; and others such as Mark Millar, creator of \"Wanted\" and \"Kick-Ass\". The comic book series \"Hellblazer\", which is largely set in Britain and starring the magician John Constantine, paved the way for British writers such as Jamie Delano.\n\nAt Christmas time, publishers repackage and commission material for comic annuals, printed and bound as hardcover A4-size books; \"Rupert\" supplies a famous example of the British comic annual. DC Thomson also repackages \"The Broons\" and \"Oor Wullie\" strips in softcover A4-size books for the holiday season.\n\nOn 19 March 2012, the British postal service, the Royal Mail, released a set of stamps depicting British comic-book characters and series. The collection featured \"The Beano\", \"The Dandy\", \"Eagle\", \"The Topper\", \"Roy of the Rovers\", \"Bunty\", \"Buster\", \"Valiant\", \"Twinkle\" and \"2000 AD\".\n\nIn Italy, comics (known in Italian as \"fumetti\") made their debut as humor strips at the end of the 19th century, and later evolved into adventure stories. After World War II, however, artists like Hugo Pratt and Guido Crepax exposed Italian comics to an international audience. Popular comic books such as \"Diabolik\" or the \"Bonelli\" line—namely \"Tex Willer\" or \"Dylan Dog\"—remain best-sellers.\n\nMainstream comics are usually published on a monthly basis, in a black-and-white digest size format, with approximately 100 to 132 pages. Collections of classic material for the most famous characters, usually with more than 200 pages, are also common. Author comics are published in the French BD format, with an example being Pratt's \"Corto Maltese\".\n\nItalian cartoonists show the influence of comics from other countries, including France, Belgium, Spain, and Argentina. Italy is also famous for being one of the foremost producers of Walt Disney comic stories outside the U.S. Donald Duck's superhero alter ego, Paperinik, known in English as Superduck, was created in Italy.\n\n\"Čtyřlístek\" (in English translated as Lucky Four or Four-Leaf Clover) is one of the most well-known comics for children published in the Czech Republic.\n\nDistribution has historically been a problem for the comic book industry with many mainstream retailers declining to carry extensive stocks of the most interesting and popular comics. The smartphone and the tablet have turned out to be an ideal medium for online distribution.\n\nOn November 13, 2007, Marvel Comics launched Marvel Digital Comics Unlimited, a subscription service allowing readers to read many comics from Marvel's history online. The service also includes periodic release new comics not available elsewhere. With the release of \"Avenging Spider-Man\" #1, Marvel also became the first publisher to provide free digital copies as part of the print copy of the comic book.\n\nWith the growing popularity of smartphones and tablets, many major publishers have begun releasing titles in digital form. The most popular platform is comiXology. Some platforms, such as Graphicly, have shut down.\n\nMany libraries have extensive collections of comics in the form of graphic novels. This is a convenient way for many in the public to become familiar with the medium.\n\nThe largest comic book ever published was on the 5th of August 2018 in São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil. It is named \"Turma da Mônica — O Maior Gibi do Mundo!\" by Panini Comics Brasil and Mauricio de Sousa Editora, and it measures at 69.9 cm by 99.8 cm (2 ft 3.51 in by 3 ft 3.29 in).\n\nThe Japanese manga author Eiichiro Oda has made comic book history by attaining a Guinness World Record title for having the \"Most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author\". His widely popular comic titled One Piece was first serialised in Weekly Shonen Jump magazine (Shueisha) in Japan, back in December 1997. In the space of less than two decades, the series has accumulated an incredibly loyal following and has gone on to sell an incredible 320,866,000 units, with a substantial 77 volumes of the comic book released over that period.\n\n\n\n"}

It is also known as Saint Distaff's Day, one of the many unofficial holidays in Catholic nations.\n\nMany St. Distaff's Day gatherings are held, large and small, throughout local fiber community. The distaff, or rock, used in spinning was the medieval symbol of women's work.\n\nIn many European cultural traditions, women resumed their household work after the twelve days of Christmas. Women of all classes would spend their evenings spinning on the wheel. During the day, they would carry a drop spindle with them. Spinning was the only means of turning raw wool, cotton or flax into thread, which could then be woven into cloth.\n\nMen have their own way of celebrating this occasion; this is done through Plough Monday. It is the first Monday after Epiphany where men are supposed to get back to work.\n\nEvery few years, Distaff Day and Plough Monday falls on the same day. Often the men and women would play pranks on each other during this celebration, as was written by Robert Herrick in his poem \"Saint Distaffs day, or the Morrow After Twelfth Day\" which appears in his Hesperides.\n\nSome modern craft groups have taken up the celebration of Distaff day as part of their new year celebrations.\n\nRobert Herrick wrote a poem on the subject which was later adapted into a song.\n\n"}

The game was last updated in 2006.\n\nEarly development commenced in 1994, by a group called NoSense, consisting of students at Masaryk University, in Brno, Czech Republic. The team consisted of programmers Pavel Pospíšil, Lukáš Svoboda and Robert Špalek; graphic artists Jakub Dvorský, Pavel Jura and Jan Pokorný; and musician Radovan Kramář. These students knew members of the small development team Pterodon, which had been responsible for \"Tajemství Oslího ostrova\", a noted success at the time. Hoping to outdo the Pterodon team, the team grew and eventually consisted of seven people. During 1994 and early 1995, NoSense focused on finding artists and writing a story. Active development began in mid-1995. The game was designed to be a grotesque adventure with unbridled jokes, and contained forty locations.\n\nPublished in Christmas 1995, the game sold 7000 copies, becoming one of the best selling Czech games. In addition, it was the first-ever title to be released in the Czech Republic on CD. The CD version was the first Czech game to include amateur Czech dubbing, a breakthrough for the Czech game industry. 11 years later, the game was made available under the GPL License and was free to download after this point.\n\nNoSense followed the game with 1997's \"\", which was worked on by Jakub Dvorský, who had also contributed to \"Dračí historie\" and later founded the Czech development company Amanita Design.\n\n11 years after the game's original release in 2006, the game was revisited for the first time, when Roberta Špalka cleaned it up ready for a remastered version which was released as freeware. In the summer of 2009, Denis Kasak started to convert the game into C++ as part of the ScummVM project, during Google Summer of Code'09, under Špalka's leadership. After Kasak was paid he left the project for good, and Špalka was left to finish it off. In 2010 he cleaned the game scripts and graphics in order to make it easier to translate to other languages, while the English, German, and Polish versions were refined.\n\nThe game centres around a teen dragon named Bert. He lives with his father Herbert and mother Berta. Bert's father leaves to look for treasure. Bert decides to find his father and bring him home.\n\nThe game received mostly positive reviews from critics in 1995. The lowest rating was 60% from Score, while the highest was 92% from Riki.\n\nA review on Freegame.cz written in 2006 commented that the technical processing still held up. Tiscali.cz said that while the game was disappointing, it was nevertheless a turning point for the Czech game scene. Gry Online felt the game was humorous and targeted at children. Database-her.cz thoguht the title had pleasant cartoon graphics and humorous dialogues. In 2006, Bonusweb gave the game a rating of 80%, commenting that it had lost virtually nothing of its attractiveness. FreeHry.cz described it as a \"true nostalgic memory of old good adventures\". In 2010, Root.cz deemed it a blast from the past, yet still fun to play.\n\nThe game sold 7,000 copies in 1995, one of the best-selling Czech games at the time. Between 1995-1999, approximately 10 to 15 thousand official copies were sold.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25954977", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25954977", "title": "Fabrice Emaer", "text": "Fabrice Emaer\n\nFabrice Emaer (1935–1983) called \"The Prince of the night\" \nwas an impresario whose nightclubs le Sept, Le Bronx and le Palace, were the premier spots in Paris nightlife in the 1970s and early 1980s, celebrated in memoirs and songs like Amanda Lear's 1979 song \"Fashion Pack\" which declared, \"In Paris you got to be seen at Maxim's / The Palace / The 7 and then go Chez Regine.\" \n\nBorn May 1, 1935, Francis Paul Emaer grew up in Wattrelos near Lille in northern France. His father was a traveling salesman for the local spinning mills, and his untimely death left the family impoverished. \n\nAt seventeen, he left his family and traveled North Africa and the French Riviera, before settling in Paris. By then, he had changed his name to the more elegant Fabrice, and worked as a stylist and make-up artist.\n\nHe opened his first club, \"Le Pimm's Bar,\" in 1964. Le Pimm's evolved into the premier gay club on Saint-Anne Street, situated in the heart of the gay neighborhood near L'Opera that was packed with bars, bathhouses, and prostitutes. The clientele was almost exclusively gay men who were there to cruise.\n\nHe had different ideas in 1968 when he took over another place down the block at 7, Saint-Anne Street. The Sept (7) had a restaurant on the ground floor with a small dance floor in the basement which he decorated simply, with mirrors on the walls and a ceiling with multicolored lights that flashed with the music.\n\n\"...the greatest innovation of Le Sept was that it was defined by glamour, not homosexuality. Everyone came -- gay, straight, and the undecided. 'You didn't have to be rich, you didn't have to be famous,' says former Le Sept DJ Guy Cuevas, 'you had to be beautiful.'\" \n\nEmaer himself fit the bill. He was handsome and charming. When Guy Cuevas took over at the turntables, the Sept became the \"epicenter of disco\" , attracting all of Paris. Visitors might see Francis Bacon, Nureyev, Roland Barthes, Bianca and Mick Jagger, Andy Warhol, Fred Hughes, Karl Lagerfeld, Yves Saint Laurent and Kenzo.\n\nAnd after a visit to New York in 1977, Emaer returned with even greater ambitions—to create the Parisian answer to Studio 54 which he found impressive and repulsive at the same time. \"It is completely sterilized, a ghetto for model agencies and Régine's emirs...\" He sneered at the clientele which was \"totally clean, beautiful, they look like they are fed on best quality corn.\" \n\nFollowing the recommendation of then culture minister Michel Guy, Emaer chose as his address the decrepit Palace Theater on rue Faubourg Montmartre which would allow him not just a huge disco, but the accoutrements of a traditional theater space with stages and an enormous balcony. He restored the architecturally classified building, including the decor of the '30s, hired a huge team of party organizers and press people to promote the club, and brought Guy Cuevas as DJ from the Sept.\n\nAgain, he was met with success. The opening night, May 1, 1978, was packed. Clubgoers loved the music and Emaer's talent for creating a compelling crowd. At the entry, Emaer instructed Edwige and Paquita Paquin to choose an interesting mix of rich and poor, gay and straight, black and white, the bourgeois, even punk. Above all they looked for attitude and an interesting look.\n\nThe jetset followed Emaer from the Sept, along with thousands of others from Alain Pacadis of the newspaper Libération who frequently evoked le Palace and its regulars in his chronicles to young journalist Frédéric Mitterrand, an unknown Madonna, and the famous Paloma Picasso whose wedding celebration eventually became a Palace event.\n\nEmaer's only misstep came in 1981 when he broke the taboo against meddling in French politics, and one night asked the crowd to vote for François Mitterrand, who would become the first French President of the left in decades. \n\nEmaer had never hidden his political leanings. He was openly gay and at some point even described himself as a \"homosexual militant\" whose commercial activities helped to build a sense of community among French homosexuals. He offered a Sunday \"Tea Dance\" free for gay men, and used the theater's giant screen to call attention to Argentina's disappeared.\n\nBut Paquita Paquin in her memoir, \"Twenty Years Without Sleeping,\" remembered that his direct call to vote for Mitterrand left many of the clubgoers appalled. A large number returned their membership cards to \"Privilege\" the VIP lounge at the Palace.\n\nThat paired with the fading of disco, began to empty the club. By the time Emaer died of cancer two years later in 1983, Le Palace was struggling to fill its enormous dance floors.\n\nShortly before his death, Emaer commented, \"I think that I have been rather successful in life. I am unhappy about only one thing: I have not earned any money...\" \n\nThe statement rang true. While millions passed through his hands, Emaer regularly spent more than he pulled in, sinking millions in the renovation of the Palace, and spending tens of thousands on parties that were successes in terms of pleasure and attendance, but never quite returned their investments.\n\nHe is remembered, nevertheless, for creating these mythical clubs, especially le Palace, which for its size and cultural impact continues to resonate in French society.\n"}

Home shopping allows consumers to shop for goods from the privacy of their own home, as opposed to traditional shopping, which requires one to visit brick and mortar stores and shopping malls.\n\nThere are three main types of home shopping: mail or telephone ordering from catalogs; telephone ordering in response to advertisements in print and electronic media (such as periodicals, TV and radio); and online shopping.\n\nThe possibility for merchants to show their goods through the world was the first usage of the \"electroscope\" (some kind of television apparatus) imagined by the author of the hoax published in the New York Sun, 30 March 1877.. First experiments appears in UK as soon as 1934. \n\nThe home shopping/electronic retailing industry was created in 1977, when small market talk radio show host Bob Circosta was asked to sell avocado-green-colored can openers live on the air by station owner Bud Paxson, when an advertiser traded 112 units of product instead of paying his advertising bill. Hesitant at first, Circosta reluctantly obliged – and to both men's great surprise, all 112 can openers sold out within the hour. Paxson sensed the vast sales potential of home-based commerce, and founded the world's first shopping channel on cable television, later launching nationwide with the Home Shopping Network (rebranded as HSN). Bob Circosta was America's first ever TV home shopping host,becoming one of the most instantly recognizable salesmen in the United States. Over the next three decades, Circosta sold over 75,000 different products on HSN, netted over 20,000 hours of live, on-air TV selling, and achieved personal product sales in excess of one billion dollars. (The story is disputed; there is some record of Paxson having unsuccessfully tried a similar format in 1969 on one of his earlier TV stations, WNYP in Jamestown, New York.)\n\nThe classic television-based home shopping industry quickly became a major player in the retail industry. The two most successful shopping channels – HSN and QVC – generate a combined total of over 10 billion dollars in sales every year. And Jewelry Television is the largest gemstone retailer in the world. [4] Nigeria joins the league with the start of MoneyMart TV, Nigeria's first largest multi-retailer teleshopping mall broadcasting 24hours on satellite and terrestrial on AIT network, powered by Innovative Strategy International Limited owned by Will Dokpesi.\n\nAmazon.com began as an online bookstore in 1994, created by Wall Street computer scientist Jeff Bezos. In addition to books, Amazon eventually added video games, computer software, electronics, apparel, and more to its sales repertoire. The company now generates approximately eight-and-a-half billion dollars annually.\n\nIn Europe, more than 150 home shopping channels were identified in activity in February 2018 by the European Audiovisual Observatory. \n\nDirect-response marketing is often considered to be a part of the home shopping/electronic retailing industry. The Electronic Retailing Association, when totaling the combined revenues from all the home shopping companies, estimates that in 2005, the industry generated over 320 billion dollars.direct marketing is a marketing where buyers will give direct response to the sellers and seller will immediately take an order..\n\n"}

Klein referred to ABC's programs as \"porn\" in order to tap into the 1970s moral panic and anxiety over the spread of pornography, using the neologism to describe the use of female television celebrities moving in loose clothing or underwear in a way in which their breasts or buttocks could be seen to move, or \"jiggle.\" An American invention, it was used to refer to programs such as \"Charlie's Angels\", \"Wonder Woman\" and \"Three's Company\", which used the sexuality of young women as appeal to their audiences. The program's plots were often sexist, full of innuendo and suggestive language, and unrealistic in nature. Producers of such series would make sure that its lead female actors would appear in a bikini, bathing suit, négligée, underwear, or naked under a towel, in each show.\n\nAt the time, the ABC target audience was 18 to 35 years old. Jiggle was also called \"Tits & Ass Television\" or \"T&A\" for short and in the 1970s the amount of sex on television increased, as did its ratings, creating social controversies and consequences.\n\nThe term was later taken to new extremes by the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s and early 2000s on such television shows as \"Baywatch\", \"She Spies\", and numerous USA Network series.\n\nThe term has been used to describe the dramatic television series of Aaron Spelling such as \"Honey West\", \"The Love Boat\", \"Fantasy Island\", \"Beverly Hills 90210\", \"Melrose Place\", \"Charmed\" and others. Jiggle TV is seen as trashy and escapist entertainment. Programs or female performers are often judged by their \"jiggle factor\" and many, such as Pamela Anderson had their bodies surgically modified to increase it. The term Jiggle-o is used to describe a character which uses jiggle factor and \"jiggle syndrome\" is used to discuss the phenomenon as a whole.\n\nList of some Jiggle TV shows:\n\n\"Battle of the Network Stars\", \n\"Baywatch\", \n\"Charlie's Angels\", \n\"Dukes of Hazzard\", \n\"Fantasy Island\", \n\"Hee Haw Honeys\", \n\"I Dream of Jeannie\", \n\"Logan's Run\", \n\"The Love Boat\", \n\"North Shore\", \n\"Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In\", \n\"Sugar Time!\" \n\"Three's Company\", \n\"We Got It Made\", \n\"WKRP in Cincinnati\", \n\"Wonder Woman\", \n\"Xena: Warrior Princess\".\n\n"}

In its \"markers up\" form, it is the usual casual version of Australian rules (similar to the relationship between backyard/beach cricket and the established forms of cricket).\n\nAlthough not a sport in itself, the term is used to describe a social exercise played in parks, fields, streets, back yards and also as a playground game that requires at least two people.\n\nKick-to-kick is used as a warm-up exercise of many Australian rules football clubs and has been the beginnings of many clubs in far-flung places. It has long been a pitch invasion tradition in the breaks immediately after official Australian rules football matches, although as professionalism in the Australian Football League increased, the practice was discontinued at most of AFL venues.\n\nThe two players will space themselves about 15 metres or more apart and alternate kicking whilst the other marks. Sometimes players will run and/or bounce when returning a long ball and experiment with different kicking styles, such as the drop punt, torpedo punt or checkside punt. If goal posts are present, participants will often position themselves in front and behind the posts to practice scoring. Kick-to-kick is often a family pastime and many footballers learned their skills in games of backyard kick-to-kick. It has been suggested that informal kick-to-kick can assist in battling obesity in children.\n\nMore formal kick-to-kick can involve multiple players, usually grouped in two bunches at either end for easier return of the ball, resulting in similar informal games, such as forcey backs. This type of play can include some play contesting, many Australian rules fans requiring a \"stepladder\" player to emulate the specky or spectacular mark seen on the football field, often also heard crying out famous names of spectacular mark proponents such as \"Jesaulenko\", \"Ablett\" or \"Capper\".\n\nThe ancient indigenous Australian game of Marn Grook, which is believed by some to have influenced Australian rules football is similar in many ways to the modern varieties of the kick-to-kick pastime.\n\nAuthor Sean Fagan claims that the kick-to-kick tradition originates with rugby football in England, citing books from 1856 which make reference to the term \"punt about\", however although the sources mention kicking practice they do not indicate other participants catching or marking the ball or kicking it back.\n\nRugby union and rugby league fans and players do not tend to participate in kick-to-kick as much as Australian rules football fans (primarily because kicking is a specialist technique in these sports; and because of variants of the codes that are playable on a small scale, such as touch football). Gaelic football and association football (soccer) fans also participate in a form of kick-to-kick with the round ball.\n\nPlaying \"Kick to kick football\" is sometimes used by Australian rules fans as a derogatory term to describe uncontested, possession based style of play sometimes seen at the professional AFL level, which many fans find boring and compare to non-contact sports such as basketball, and netball. This is because kick-to-kick does not generally involve any of the contesting found in an official game of Australian rules football, such as tackling, bumping, smothering (known as a \"charge down\" in rugby league), spoiling and other one percenters which often result in more unpredictable change of possession.\n\nRock band TISM featured a song titled \"'And The Ass Said to the Angel: \"Wanna Play Kick To Kick?'\" on the album Great Truckin' Songs of the Renaissance in 1988.\n\nMichael Leunig painted \"Street Football\" in 1990.\n\nThe pastime inspired a short film named \"Kick to Kick\" by Tony McNamara in 2000.\n\nAuskick in 2007 used the kick-to-kick tradition as part of their promotional television campaign, which shows kids from around the country kicking the football to each other to the tune of Gimme dat Thang.\n"}

It stars Adam Sandler as Nicky, one of Satan's three sons as he attempts to save his father and prevent his brothers from taking over Earth.\n\nThe film was a financial failure and received negative reviews from critics.\n\nThe story revolves around a struggle to determine which of Satan's three sons will succeed their father (Harvey Keitel) as ruler of Hell. Adrian (Rhys Ifans) is the most devious, Cassius (Tom \"Tiny\" Lister, Jr.) is the cruelest, and Nicky (Adam Sandler) is their father's favorite. Adrian and Cassius claim that Nicky's mother is a goat and torment him by controlling his body with their minds. Nicky has had a speech impediment and a disfigured jaw since Cassius hit him in the face with a shovel.\n\nHaving been the Prince of Darkness for ten thousand years, the Devil assembles his sons to decide which of them will succeed him; he tells them that they are not ready yet, having decided to keep his throne. Angered by this decision, Adrian and Cassius go to Earth to create a new Hell by possessing religious and political leaders in New York City. As they leave, they freeze the entrance to Hell, preventing more souls from entering and causing Satan's body to begin decomposing. To stop Adrian and Cassius, Satan sends Nicky to Earth with a silver flask that traps whoever drinks from it inside.\n\nAt first, Nicky has trouble staying alive on Earth. He is killed several times, landing in Hell and returning to New York each time. While learning how to eat and sleep, he meets a talking bulldog named Mr. Beefy (voice of Robert Smigel), rents an apartment with an actor named Todd (Allen Covert), and falls in love with a design student named Valerie (Patricia Arquette).\n\nNicky's first encounter with his brothers occurs when Adrian sees him with Valerie, takes mental control of his body, and makes him scare her away. Then Nicky sees Cassius on television, possessing the referee of a Globetrotters game. When he goes to the court and tricks Cassius into the flask, Satanist metalheads John (Jonathan Loughran) and Peter (Peter Dante) are so thrilled with his performance that they become his devoted fans. That evening, Nicky tries to apologize to Valerie. The meeting goes badly at first, but she accepts him after he explains who he is and why he is on Earth.\n\nThe next day, Adrian possesses the Chief of the NYPD (Michael McKean) and accuses Nicky of mass murder. Not knowing what to do, Nicky has Todd kill him so he can go back to Hell and ask his father for advice, but his father has trouble hearing because his ears have fallen off, and his assistants are in a panic because the midnight deadline to capture Adrian and Cassius is only hours away. Back on Earth again, Nicky and his friends devise a plan to capture Adrian in a subway station, but Adrian discovers their trick. In the ensuing fight, Adrian grabs Valerie and dives onto the track as a train approaches, but Nicky throws her out of the way, leaving himself and Adrian to be killed by the train.\n\nArriving in Hell just minutes before midnight, Adrian begins the process of taking over Hell by pushing what remains of his father aside and sitting on the throne, rising to Central Park, and starting a riotous party. Meanwhile, Nicky wakes up in Heaven as a reward for sacrificing himself and meets his mother (Reese Witherspoon), an angel who tells him he can defeat Adrian with the Inner Light he inherited from her. After she gives him a mysterious orb, he goes to Central Park. Adrian appears to win a pitched battle by locking Nicky in the flask and turning himself into a bat, but Nicky escapes from the flask. When he shatters the orb, Ozzy Osbourne appears, bites Adrian's head off, and spits it into the flask.\n\nWith his brothers captured, Nicky is ready to save his father. After he sins to make sure he goes to Hell, he and Valerie express their love for each other and she kills him. In Hell, Satan regains his body and recommends that Nicky go back to Earth. The film ends a year later, when Nicky and Valerie live in New York with their infant son.\n\n\n\nIt opened at #2 at the North American box office making $16 million USD in its opening weekend, behind \"Charlie's Angels\", which was on its second consecutive week at the top spot. The film went on to earn $39.5 million domestically and another $18.8 million worldwide, bringing the total to $58.3 million.\n\nBased on 115 reviews collected by the film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, only 22% of critics gave \"Little Nicky\" a positive review. The site's consensus states [that] \"Despite the presence of a large, talented cast, the jokes in \"Little Nicky\" are dumb, tasteless, and not that funny, and Adam Sandler's character is grating to watch.\" Comedian and former \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" host Michael J. Nelson named the film the worst comedy ever made. Roger Ebert had some positive comments for the feature, describing \"Little Nicky\" as \"the best Sandler movie to date,\" while at the same time lamenting Sandler's lack of finesse.\n\nThe film was nominated for five awards at the 21st Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Picture, Worst Actor (Adam Sandler), Worst Supporting Actress (Patricia Arquette), Worst Director and Worst Screenplay. It lost in all categories to \"Battlefield Earth\" starring John Travolta.\n\nDespite its negative reception the film has received a cult following over the years. It also has a 56% audience approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n\"Little Nicky\" was released on DVD and VHS on April 24, 2001. The DVD includes two audio commentaries and plenty of deleted scenes.\n\nThere is yet to be a blu-ray release of the film.\n\nThe soundtrack to the movie was released October 31, 2000 through Maverick Records and featured a lineup that leaned heavily toward Maverick recording artists that included Deftones, Insolence, Muse and Unloco. The track listing as listed on Allmusic:\n\nA Game Boy Color game was released based on the film shortly after its release.\n\n"}

Location scouts also look for generally spectacular or interesting locations beforehand, to have a database of locations in case of requests.\n\nLocation scouts often negotiate legal access to filming locations.\n\nSuitability of a location to the task at hand takes into consideration many factors, including:\n\nTypically ideas for what a filming location should or could be are discussed between production department and locations department (it could be at this point that the locations department is actually created), then research is begun to actually find and document that location using location scout(s).\nThe location scouts and other Locations Department staff (see below), working under the supervision of the Location Manager, generally strive to provide as many potentially useful/viable ideas and/or options as possible for review by production; often the Assistant Director, Production Manager and subsequently, the Director or even the Executive Producer in the case of narrative filmmaking.\n\nOnce a consensus on locations with the most potential is reached, arrangements are normally made for some of the heads of the other Production Departments to tour those location(s) to confirm suitability. This tour is commonly called a \"tech scout\", \"recce\" or \"go-see\".\n\nDuring this time the Locations Department (most likely the Location Manager in situations requiring the most responsibility) will have contacted and begun negotiation with internal and external parties that may affect ability to film at the location. This is known as \"clearing the location\": investigating and confirming availability and fees to be paid to a location owner or agent, obtaining a certificate of insurance, obtaining any needed film permits (may involve fees). Also, there might be distribution of \"resident letters\" or \"filming notifications\". These are notices to neighbors, advising them of intent to film in the area (often a local requirement). These steps result in \"locking down\": making sure that all details and existing or potential issues are addressed. While it is the Locations Department's job to anticipate and minimize problems associated with a location, it is also the Locations Department's duty to advise other Production Department heads of intractable problems that need consideration so contingencies can be planned. This may lead to a decision to use an alternate location. This might involve additional planning and budget allocation for additional location scouting.\n\nProduction events involving the Location Department and its personnel can occur very quickly and quite often, the requirements themselves, \"i.e.\", script rewrite(s), creative concept change(s), of a location itself can change on the fly. More often than not, multiple locations associated with multiple scenes in production are involved; under some circumstances, a busy and resourceful freelancer or Locations Department Staffer could be involved in multiple projects simultaneously.\n\nSolving location problems can be challenging, requiring hard work for long hours, keen communication skills, focus, ability to \"think on one's feet\" or \"multitasking\", take action quickly and responsibly as well as using technical skills. Familiarity with local resources and a network of capable support are needed.\n\nAfter completing all the steps above, if a location is still viable and available, it is confirmed (booked). Usually a contract is signed by all parties, and a property release is obtained: a written, signed permission from the property owner or agent allowing photography of and public depiction via media (\"i.e.\", broadcast, video, film, print publication). \n\nOnce a location is booked, there are very few reasons for filming to not commence as planned. At this point many man-hours of paid production work and considerable amounts of money for location fees and/or permits have been invested in the chosen location. A change of creative concept at this stage or glitch of any kind (such as property owner cancellation) is potentially costly, and legal action is a possible consequence. Also, if production misrepresents itself regarding its activities, intended use of the location, damages the property or negligently causes other problems for the property owner, the property owner may seek remedy in any of many forms available, including legal action.\n\nLocal weather conditions can figure heavily into a location's viability and affect many areas of production scheduling, so contingencies and alternate, budgetary-efficient plans should be made well in advance of any shoot day with a possibility to be affected by weather. A location with potential to be affected by weather should always be cleared and placed, in advance, with the property owner's understanding and consent \"on weather hold\" or under the condition that production will only confirm use of the location and commence photography pending viable weather conditions. The aim, in addition to the obvious goal of attaining the correct aesthetic for the shot in acceptable and safe working conditions is also geared toward providing greater flexibility of crew scheduling, equipment, vehicle, etc. rentals and other production aspects and minimize inconvenience to the owner and in the event of cancellation or postponement by production due to weather, eliminate or minimize cancellation fees as may be part of an agreement between production and the location.\n\nIn addition to feature films and short films, television commercials and television shows, documentary films, corporate video, print advertising photography, editorial photography and even event planning all have the possibility to employ location scouts to find and photograph locations for their productions. \n\nThe methods employed are much the same as for feature film production, but the processes often differ in some ways:\n\nTurn around times are generally shorter and the decision making is shared between production, the director/photographer and the advertising agency or even the end client. A weekly broadcast television show may have significant deadline challenges for obvious reasons.\n\nOften the decision makers are geographically dispersed, which may explain why commercial and print scouts have been early adopters of online presentations and other digital technologies.\n\nThe Locations Department's duties often extend beyond pre-production and into actual production as well as after filming at the location has completed; a Location Manager and/or other Locations Department members are often needed during actual shooting and at wrap to be a general point of internal contact for matters related to the Locations Department such as ensuring smooth crew movement to and from the location, answering locations-related questions/ solving misc problems as may arise, coordinating crowd control and as an external point of contact between production and such parties as perhaps the property owner, neighbors, local film office/government and law enforcement.\n\nLocations Department personnel are always the last crew to leave a location and the credo is to leave the location in the same (if not better) condition than it was found.\n\nA film crew might have the following titled positions staffed in regard to the Locations Department. Many of the positions often \"cross over\" or a member of the department might \"wear several hats\":\n\nOversees the Locations Department and its staff, typically reporting directly to the Production Manager and/or Assistant Director (or even Director and/or Executive Producer). Location Manager is responsible for final clearing (or guaranteeing permission to use) a location for filming and must often assist Production/Finance Dept(s) in maintaining budget management regarding actual location/permit fees as well as labor costs to production for himself and the Locations Department at large.\n\nWorks with the Location Manager and the various departments in arranging technical scouts for the essential staff (grips, electric, camera, etc.) to see options which the Location Manager has selected for filming. The Assistant Location Manager will be onset during the filming process to oversee the operation, whereas the Location Manager continues preproduction from elsewhere (generally an office) on the upcoming locations. (Note: On most location-based television shows, there will be two Assistant Location Managers that alternate episodes, allowing one to prep an upcoming episode while the other is on set with the current one.)\n\nDoes much of the actual research, footwork and photography to document location possibilities. Often the Location Manager will do some scouting themselves, as well as the Assistant Location Manager.\n\nOn a large film crew someone might be assigned exclusively to do research work for the Locations Department, freeing the Location Scout(s) to concentrate on photographing location possibilities or other tasks. This person's job might be to do internet or public library research and contact resources to assess said resource's interest in being involved in the film project and if such interest exists, the location researcher might be responsible for setting up an appointment for a location scout to go there.\n\nHired by the Location Manager to be on-set before, during, and after the filming process. General responsibilities can include arriving first at the location to allow the set dressers into the set for preparation; maintaining the cleanliness of the location areas during filming (on larger budget projects this can include securing and supervising a contract clean-up crew or assigning such duties to a set PA); limiting the impact of a working production crew on the location grounds; fielding complaints from neighbors; and ultimately, at the end of the filming, managing on-set time and crew with regard to the closure of the location within contractually-permitted time constraints. There are generally one to three assistants on a shoot at any given time.\n\nThis position exists generally on larger budget productions. The Locations PA is the assistant who is almost never onset, but instead is always \"prepping\" a location or \"wrapping\" a location. That is, when a location requires several days of set up and breakdown prior and following the day(s) of filming.\n\nTypically hired by Location Manager on an as-need basis to supervise Parking Staff in order to secure and coordinate crew parking including equipment trucks and personal vehicles. Locations Department and Parking Department might work together with local law enforcement to coordinate traffic control if the scene being filmed involves roadway right-of-way in any way.\n\nParking Staff hang up the brightly colored signs that declare No Parking and then sit in their cars (with an orange cone on the top) to ensure that no one parks in the coned off areas.\n\nLocation Department's disposition is to be the last to depart a location upon wrap and to leave the location in exactly if not better condition as it existed upon arrival. A waste removal company might be hired on an as-need basis.\n\nA location scout typically takes descriptive, panoramic photographs or video of location possibilities. A good location scout will make photos of a location possibility that reflect the aesthetic goals of the production and will also include visually descriptive utilitarian photography and information in his presentation, documenting much more than just what will potentially appear onscreen.\n\nAdditional descriptive information might include (as might be relevant):\n\n\n"}

{"id": "44936061", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44936061", "title": "Online deliberation", "text": "Online deliberation\n\nThe term online deliberation describes the emerging field of practice and research related to the design, implementation and study of deliberative processes that rely on the use of electronic information and communications technologies (ICT).\n\nOnline deliberation is a relatively new field.\n\nOnline deliberation is very interdisciplinary, and includes practices such as online consultation, e-participation, e-government, Citizen-to-Citizen (C2C), online deliberative polling, crowdsourcing, online facilitation, online research communities, interactive e-learning, civic dialogue in Internet forums and online chat, and group decision making that utilizes collaborative software and other forms of computer-mediated communication. Work in all these endeavors is tied together by the challenge of using electronic media in a way that deepens thinking and improves mutual understanding.\n\nOpen international conferences on online deliberation have been held at Carnegie Mellon University in 2003, Stanford University in 2005, and the University of California, Berkeley in 2008. The most recent conference was held at the University of Leeds, June 30 – July 2, 2010. Attendees of the 2005 conference voted to create an international society for online deliberation, but no formal organization has yet been established. Other events of interest have been sponsored by the Online Deliberative Democracy Consortium.\n\nOver the past few decades, scholars across research traditions and areas have commonly identified at least two aspects in their definitions of deliberation: (1) a form of communication characterized by \"the performance of a set of communicative behaviors that promote thorough group discussion\"; and (2) the idea that individuals involved in this process of communication carefully weigh arguments and reasons for and against some propositions posed by others in the group. To be considered deliberative discussion, argue scholars, the communication and the involved interactants' behavior has to meet criteria established by the principles of political equality and egalitarian reciprocity.\n\nAccording to Habermas, deliberation is \"an interchange of rational–critical arguments among a group of individuals, triggered by a common or public problem, whose main focus or topic of discussion is to find a solution acceptable to all who have a stake in the issue\". Halpern and Gibbs define deliberation as \"a particular sort of discussion between at least two individuals in which (1) the form of communication emphasizes the use of logic and reasoning instead of power or coercion, (2) this reasoned engagement focuses on a social or political issue through which participants are able to identify solutions to a common problem, and (3) individuals are open to opinions and ideas expressed by others, and at the same time the communication between them is governed by rules of equality, symmetry and civility\". Stroud and colleagues noted that many definitions of deliberation \"share the basic idea that deliberation involves people exchanging views on a matter of public importance in a respectful manner, reasoning through their claims, and listening to the perspectives of others\".\n\nThe advent of the Internet and subsequently Web 2.0-based applications and especially social media have fostered discursive participation and deliberation online through computer-mediated communication.\n\nPolitical deliberation is critical to societal consensus-building. Online deliberation can have positive implications for the democracy. Research has found that social media can enhance civic participation and democratic decision-making. First, online spaces allow for more equal and decentralized communication as numerous users from diverse backgrounds connect. Participants have equal opportunities to express opinions, raise questions, and exchange information. Secondly, online tools constitute a more favorable channel for users to engage in rational-critical debate than traditional synchronous channels because users are able to compose messages at their own pace and will. Thirdly, the written and asynchronous features of online deliberation enable more reflexive, rational and argumentative conversations.\n\nResearchers have questioned the utility of online deliberation as an extension of the public sphere, declining the idea that online deliberation is no less beneficial than face-to-face interaction. Computer-mediated discourse is deemed impersonal, and is found to encourage online incivility. Furthermore, users who participate in online discussions about politics are found to make comments only in groups that agree with their own views, indicating the possibility that online deliberation mainly promotes motivated reasoning and reinforces preexisting attitudes.\n\nIn the context of new media environment, researchers have evaluated the quality of online discourse based on criteria such as the presence of civility, relevance, genuine questions, and evidence to determine if the discourse meets the deliberative norms.\n\nIn the context of comments posted to online news sites, the presence of a recognizable journalist engaging with commenters has been found to be associated with improved quality of deliberation with reduced incivility and increased evidence-based discourse, as compared with when no one engages with commenters or when an unidentified staff member from the news organization engages with commenters. Discussions surrounding news of health or abortion topics are more relevant but with fewer genuine questions posed than news of topics on education, crimes or guns, and economy. News of education topics has less uncivil and more relevant comments than the other news topics. People provide less evidence in their discourse when discussing news of economy topics as compared to the other news topics.\n\nGroup size, volume of communication, interactivity between participants, message characteristics, and social media characteristics have also been found to impact online deliberation.\n\nDeliberation can be defined as being the \"act of thinking about or discussing something and deciding carefully\" by the Merriam-Webster dictionary. In an online political setting, however, it is more complicated than only reaching a decision. Members need to contribute material with an intent for it to be discussed and responded to by others. Participants of online deliberation need to diligently analyze, review, and present the sources of their findings before any decisions can be made. A consensus has to be reached among members of which material to use based on relevancy and quality, and ability to accurately resolve the issue of which they are trying to find a solution to.\n\nGenerally, participation in online deliberation forums has been low. This is an issue because representativity is poor and can be swayed towards meeting the wishes of those that participate, consisting of those who are well-educated, and so forth. There is also the possibility that the issues wouldn't even be considered if turnout remains so low. Low levels of influence not only repel legislative bodies, but also potential participants. However, large participation levels present the chance that members are beginning to solely chat on topics, not fully read and evaluate others' inputs. If a forum is deliberate and goal-oriented, and those who participate are forced to have to go through processes to get their opinions out, those who wish to simply chatter will be filtered out, and the forums will be left only with those seriously interested and involved in finding a solution, as explored by Cyril Velikanov in his \"Mass Online Deliberation\" paper.\n\nOnline deliberation Internet forums require participants to be able to work together comfortably in order to make the best possible deliberations. In order to do that, as Beth Noveck has put it, forums need to establish \"physics\" for groups, or rules and regulations have to follow in order for members to feel comfortable with one another. Once comfort is achieved, the environment groups are now in are their \"culture,\" and healthy conversations can now be made. Since participants do not communicate face-to-face, visual queues often make groups more self-aware. For instance, green and red lights can be implemented for when members speak, and therefore the group can visualize if a member isn't participating or involved, or if a member is \"too\" involved. This way, imbalances in groups can be avoided, such as gridlocked situations or communication flaws.\n\nSystems of \"chunking work,\" or, members self-selecting roles to play in their groups, help to keep work high quality and manageable. Collaboration becomes easier when people choose the way they want to work in whatever way suits them. When members select the method of working that is comfortable to them, they are more likely to remain interested in their subject and produce quality content for their group. If Internet forums can find a way to divide work in a way that members are most comfortable, their outcomes will be better produced.\n\nRating systems are valuable to Internet forums because they police both participants and the content they produce to ensure quality material. If members can rate each other based on their collaboration or work produced, then they can more easily trust those who have high ratings to have quality product. The forums themselves can also see these ratings and be able to filter out inappropriate, irrelevant, or low-quality content. Members policing each other forces the members to be cautious and aware about the information they put out. Ratings help to regulate and organize the sites on a large scale, making it easier to sift through content even if there are large amounts of it.\n\n\"Online Deliberation: A Review of The Literature.\" Bang The Table, 7 Aug. 2017, www.bangthetable.com/online-deliberation/.\n\"Online Deliberation.\" Online Deliberation | Participedia, participedia.net/en/methods/online-deliberation.\nEsau, Katharina, et al. \"Design Matters!

The most familiar example is the magazine, typically published weekly, monthly, or quarterly. Newspapers, often published daily or weekly, are, strictly speaking, a separate category of serial. Other examples of periodicals are newsletters, literary magazines (literary journals), academic journals (including scientific journals), science magazines, yearbooks and comic books.\n\nThese examples are typically published and referenced by volume and issue. \"Volume\" typically refers to the number of years the publication has been circulated, and \"issue\" refers to how many times that periodical has been published during that year. For example, the April 2011 publication of a monthly magazine first published in 2002 would be listed as, \"volume 10, issue 4\". Roman numerals are sometimes used in reference to the volume number.\n\nWhen citing a work in a periodical, there are standardized formats such as \"The Chicago Manual of Style\". In the latest edition of this style, a work with volume number 17 and issue number 3 may be written as follows:\n\n\nPeriodicals can be classified into two types: popular and scholarly. Popular periodicals are usually magazines (e.g., \"Ebony\" and \"Esquire\"). Scholarly journals are most commonly found in libraries and databases. Examples are \"The Journal of Psychology\" and the \"Journal of Social Work\".\n\nTrade magazines are also examples of periodicals. They are written for an audience of professionals in the world. As of the early 1990s, there were over 6,000 business, technical, academic, scientific, and trade publications in the United States alone.\n\nThese examples are related to the idea of an indefinitely continuing cycle of production and publication: magazines plan to continue publishing, not to stop after a predetermined number of editions. A novel, in contrast, might be published in monthly parts, a method revived after the success of \"The Pickwick Papers\" by Charles Dickens. This approach is called part-publication, particularly when each part is from a whole work, or a serial, for example in comic books. It flourished during the nineteenth century, for example with Abraham John Valpy's \"Delphin Classics\", and was not restricted to fiction.\n\nThe International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) is to serial publications (and by extension, periodicals) what the International Standard Book Number (ISBN) is to books: a standardized reference number.\n\nPostal services often carry periodicals at a preferential rate; for example, Second Class Mail in the United States only applies to publications issued at least quarterly.\n\n"}

He refuses, instead offering Bob one of his side businesses so he can earn extra money as a taxi cab driver.\n\nBob accepts the offer while Louise becomes Tina's kissing coordinator as a birthday present to her to get ready for the expected kissing moment with Jimmy Jr. On the first night of his job, Bob starts to enjoy driving around the city, even befriending three transgender prostitutes: Glitter (Steve Agee), Marbles (Jack McBrayer), and Cha-Cha (Oscar Nunez). Tina starts inviting classmates to her party, including Jimmy Jr., who needs permission from his father for the R.S.V.P.. Unfortunately, Jimmy Sr. forbids Jr. to come because of his rivalry with Bob, and Tina refuses to have a party without Jimmy Jr. Bob tries to talk sense into Jimmy Pesto, but Jimmy refuses unless Bob shaves his mustache and brings it to him as part of his collection. Tina disrespects him for his refusal to shave his mustache since he does not wants to negotiate with the Pesto family.\n\nAfter a night out with the sex workers, Bob deliriously comes back to the restaurant (due to drinking alcohol and possibly taking crack). Linda tells Bob that Tina agrees to attend the party, but only for a few minutes. Bob wakes up half an hour late for the party, and finds out it is not going well: the boys and girls aren't dancing, Gene in his role as the DJ and Mort working as the magician are appalling. Bob remembered that he invited not just his regular transgender customers but others, including Marshmallow (David Herman) and a homeless man. Tina is disappointed in Bob for what he's done, and refuses to talk to him. The trans women mention to Tina that Bob worked really hard for the party and remind her that she has a good father who worked two jobs to pay for her party. She apologizes to Bob for what she said to him and lets him know that he already made the party perfect, even without Jimmy Jr. present. However, Bob has already shaved his mustache off. The trans women recognize Jimmy Sr. as one of their dates, known as \"Baby Num Num\", a \"diaper lover.\" Bob brings the trans women over to Jimmy's restaurant to threaten him about his personal dates. He concedes with Bob's demands; Bob keeps his mustache hair, albeit in a plastic baggie, and Jimmy Jr. is allowed to attend the party. Jimmy Jr. comes to the party, and Tina is grateful to Bob for what he has done. Tina and Jimmy Jr. kiss under the party's disco ball, with Louise's encouragement, and Gene plays the Thompson Twins' song, \"If You Were Here,\" creating a reference to the ending of the film \"Sixteen Candles.\" The episode finishes with everyone enjoying the party.\n\nIn its original American broadcasting, \"Sheesh! Cab, Bob?\" was viewed by an estimated 4.91 million viewers and received a 2.7 rating/4% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, an improvement from last episode and became the highest rated episode of the season to be aired after the first two episodes. Rowan Kaiser of \"The A.V. Club\" gave the episode an A-, saying \"As funny as the episode is, it's also genuinely sweet by the end, with Bob and Tina bonding over how much work he's done. Of course, that just makes his drunken bender with sex workers that much funnier, as well as Louise acting as Tina's kissing coordinator and sending her to boot camp.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "6581847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6581847", "title": "Skweee", "text": "Skweee\n\nSkweee is a musical style, with origin in Sweden and Finland. Skweee combines simple synth/chiptune leads and basslines with funk, R&B or soul-like rhythms, overall rendering a stripped-down funky sound. The tracks are predominantly instrumental, though there are exceptions. The name Skweee was coined by Daniel Savio, one of the originators of the emerging sound. The name refers to the use of analog synthesizers in the production process, where the aim is to \"squeeze out\" the most interesting sounds possible.\nProducers can vary from high-profile to new talent from the Scandinavian electronica environment.\n\nSkweeelicious, a blog dedicated to skweee, and community sites such as MySpace and Nation of Skweee have played a major role in the distribution of skweee music and public exposure of the genre.\n\nThe major outlets of skweee music are the Swedish record label Flogsta Danshall and Finnish record label Harmönia. Norwegian Dødpop, Canadian Ancient Robot, US Losonofono, US Titched, US Poisonous Gases, Spanish Lo Fi Funk, Finnish Mässy, and French Mazout have since been added to this family. The preferred media format of skweee enthusiasts is the 7\" vinyl record. Early releases were exclusively released in this format. More recently, however, a series of 12\" vinyl records, digital releases and CD compilations have been released through these outlets as well.\n\nThe increasing notability of the skweee genre has resulted in releases such as the Eero Johannes album on Planet Mu and the Skweee Tooth compilation on Ramp Recordings.\n\nSkweee has, during late 2008 and early 2009, started to influence the sound of dubstep. A thread started on the dubstepforum made the scene aware of skweee. Producers such as Rusko, Gemmy, Joker, Zomby, Rustie, among others, have given their take on the sound, resulting in several releases on the boundary between skweee and dubstep. The gap between dubstep and skweee has been further bridged by artists such as DJ Pontificate and underground ambient artist Chohmo, as evidenced by the former's release \"Skweeeal.\"\n\n"}

In the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) station database (CDBS), broadcast STA applications have a prefix of BSTA (general), BLSTA (legal), BESTA (engineering), or BLESTA (both). STAs can also be issued for other telecommunication services under FCC regulation. Often an STA is necessary due to an unforeseen event. A station operator must exhibit why the STA is necessary and serves the public good.\n\nA common reason to apply for STA is an equipment failure. In case a station cannot use its licensed antenna or transmission system, it can immediately continue operations using any available antenna or operating parts of existing system, as long as an STA is filed for within 24 hours. An AM station may use a random wire antenna if necessary. AM stations operating directionally are limited to 25 percent of their licensed power if their directional array fails and they must operate non-directionally under STA. If a station is evicted from its transmitter site or must move for another reason, it may also continue operating from a temporary site under the same rules, as long as it does not change or increase its coverage area or plan to permanently broadcast from that site. These rules allow stations to resume broadcasting quickly in case of a state of disaster.\n\nA station may go silent entirely for up to ten days without notifying the FCC at all, and up to thirty days with only a letter of notification. A station that is or will be silent for longer than thirty days must apply for a \"silent STA\", which can be granted for up to six months. The FCC typically required that silence be for reasons beyond the operator's control, such as total equipment failure or loss of programming, and asked for plans to return the station to air. The commission has since started to grant silent STAs for financial reasons. Stations that are silent can also apply for an operational STA to resume broadcasting from a temporary facility, to avoid losing its license after one continuous year of silence. The one-year limit was written into the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and cannot be overridden by the FCC due to extenuating circumstances.\n\nThis silent/operational STA process presents a loophole in that it can be used to work around the Telecommunications Act indefinitely, and such STAs are normally granted with little oversight. In January 2018, the FCC initiated a crackdown on stations that exploit the loophole. The first high-profile case was co-owned stations WBVA in Bayside, Virginia and WVAB in Virginia Beach, Virginia, whose 2017 license renewals were designated for a hearing. The stations have operated under a cycle of silent and operational STAs since 2008; they applied yearly to broadcast with 30 and 6 watts, respectively, from a temporary site for several weeks before going silent for the rest of the year. Station owner Birach Broadcasting Corporation has claimed it is stuck with the temporary facilities as it has been unable to get zoning approval for a new transmitter site.\n\nAn STA can also be used for special events as a Restricted Service Licence is in the U.K., however this is rare. A market has developed around proprietary devices that provide live audio or video to attendees of a conference or sporting event; these devices receive a signal from a low-powered television station operating under a temporary STA in VHF Band I, which is largely no longer used for broadcasting.\n\n"}

It is the sixth game in the \"TOCA\" series. The game features several fully licensed championships, including the DTM series and V8 Supercar championship. This is the last in the series to have TOCA in its title as following on from this TOCA was dropped in favour of just Race Driver.\n\nIt includes 120 Championships and 35 Types of Racing through the Championship in World Tour, Pro Career, and Free Race. Also it has Bonus Championships in different disciplines. They take place largely in the UK and Germany, though many more tracks are unlocked by winning cups in Pro Career, or by setting a lap time record on a course within Pro Career mode. Open wheel, GT, Oval racing, Rallying and Off-road racing were all featured, and can be raced in either a detailed Pro Career mode or an open-ended World Tour.\n\nOnline play allows 12 and 8 players on PlayStation 2 and Xbox, respectively. Currently, it is the only racing simulator for PlayStation 2 with an online racing mode. For the PC up to 12 players could race together with the built-in Gamespy Server or by using a LAN. When Gamespy closed in 2014 Online Multiplayer was subsequently made possible using the Free Tunngle Network. But the Tunngle Network was shutdown at 30.04.2018 due to pending requirements of the new European General Data Protection Regulation. However, Cross-Platform Online Racing was still possible in 2018 using the Openspy Server. The game received good reviews, frequently being compared favorably to \"Gran Turismo 4\" and \"Forza Motorsport\", in the aspects of cars on track, collision and wear damage. Custom tuning of suspension components for handling and gear ratios, and including braking ratio front to rear. A more through tuning setup for a race car was allowable more so then in a driving simulator like Gran Turismo 4, since TOCA Race Driver 3 was a racing simulator.\n\nThe game features many real-life competitions, including British GT, DTM, IRL and V8 Supercars, as well as a Vintage series, other GT series, and Rally. The Formula Williams FW27 is the featured car of the Formula 1 series in the game.\n\nThe game received \"generally favorable reviews\" on all platforms according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. In Japan, where the PS2 version got a port on January 24, 2008, \"Famitsu\" gave it a score of all four sevens for a total of 28 out of 40.\n\n\n"}

TheBestPageInTheUniverse.net, an alternate domain for Maddox's website, had an Alexa rank of about 33,000 in 2009, and 180,000 in 2017. Maddox himself wrote an article in 2002 illustrating that despite all traffic being generated by word-of-mouth alone, his site was still ranked ahead of major corporations such as McDonald's and Pepsi, who spend millions of dollars on advertising every year.\n\nHe launched a competition for people to send him cartoons about himself or his website, most of which are attacks about emails for \"more updates.\"\nLater, he parodied this himself by stating that now that he's finished with the comic book, he'd be able to \"Not update the site more regularly.\"\nEntries included a depiction of Maddox leaping out of a computer monitor and smashing two fans' faces together and a comic strip of a boy checking the website for new content only to find a cartoon of himself that he had posted ten seconds earlier.\n\n\"The Best Page in the Universe\"'s layout was made sparse primarily to reduce bandwidth costs.\nMaddox also stated the sparsity protested the many websites containing \"fancy HTML\" but lacking substantial content. \nThe page is headed with an image of Maddox's face superimposed over a bust of Che Guevara.\nIn the image, Maddox is wearing a beret emblazoned with the Jolly Roger, and an eye patch.\nMaddox uses this image as a parody of the revolutionary icon.\nMaddox says that Che Guevara is remembered as \"Che the revolutionary,\" not \"Che the pinko\", and claims to be neither socialist nor communist.\nInstead, he often proclaims himself to be a pirate, and typically portrays himself as such in his articles and artwork.\n\nMaddox has compared reading black text on a white background to \"staring at a light bulb.\"\nThe site uses large, light-colored text on a black background to, in the stated opinion of Maddox, reduce strain on the eyes.\n\nThe site contains advertisements only for itself: it sells merchandise, such as stickers and apparel, that bear phrases from its articles. Maddox chose to not use advertisements because he thought they could end up censoring him by dropping ads.\n\nMany of Maddox's articles include MS Paint illustrations, with touch up done in Photoshop. Images include elderly people being fired into the Sun, hippies being killed, and Maddox's testicles drawn larger than basketballs.\nMaddox maintains a section in which he criticizes hate mail his website has generated. When posting his replies he breaks the e-mail down and ridicules points which use fallacious logic and also corrects grammatical or orthographical errors.\nThe site contains several \"hidden pages\", many of which are unfinished works or first drafts of articles that were moved around.\n"}

Many members of the crew are at the party, including Captain Janeway and The Doctor, who is acting as their bartender. Eventually the ship becomes stuck in the field, causing the internal communications system on board \"Voyager\" to fail. Unable to communicate with Tuvok, who is acting captain during the party, the crew end the party early and attempt to return to their posts, however the ship's layout has mysteriously changed and they are unable to find their way. The crew eventually become separated and hopelessly lost within the labyrinthine corridors. Meanwhile, The Doctor becomes unable to return himself to sickbay, and finds himself amorously pursued by the hologram Sandrine.\n\nDuring the exploration, Neelix once more becomes jealous of Tom Paris's relationship with Kes; he goes on to demand to know more about her friendships with other male officers. When she becomes angry and refuses to discuss her feelings with him, he goes to Chakotay for advice. Chakotay tells him that jealousy is natural, but that he must try to control himself for the sake of his relationship with Kes.\n\nThe crew, including Tuvok, who has left the bridge and become similarly lost, all find themselves back at the holodeck. They organize themselves in an attempt to reach crucial areas of the ship such as engineering and the bridge; B'Elanna and Paris are successful in reaching engineering, but when they try to transport to the bridge they find themselves back at the holodeck. Meanwhile, Janeway becomes delirious after coming into direct contact with the energy field, which is penetrating further into the ship, and is brought to the holodeck by Harry Kim in the hope that The Doctor can help her.\n\nB'Elanna returns to Engineering and makes an attempt to stop the field with a ship-wide energy burst, but this only makes the field envelop the ship at an accelerated rate. With the holodeck as the last refuge, the crew gathers there, and Tuvok suggests that the most logical course of action is to simply do nothing, as any attempt to stop it has only made the situation worse, and they so far have no evidence that being engulfed by the field is fatal. They do as Tuvok suggests and neither the crew nor the ship is harmed by passing through the field. Janeway is returned to health and surmises that the energy field was somehow sentient and trying to communicate with them – her theory is backed by the fact that the entire ship's memory had been downloaded and that 20 billion gigaquads of data have been uploaded to \"Voyager\"s computer.\n\n\"Twisted\" was extensively rewritten prior to being shot, and was for a time rumored to be so bad that it would never be aired, based largely on comments that Robert Picardo made at several fan conventions. The episode originally underran its time significantly, and several scenes had to be invented to extend its length, most significantly the subplot involving The Doctor being pursued by Sandrine. Script writer Michael Piller went on to voice criticisms about Neelix's subplot in this episode; he felt that the character should not be constantly portrayed as a 'buffoon', and attempting to correct the issues that he saw and resolve the subplot in question with the following episode, . Reviewers Lance Parkin and Mark Jones complained that the massive data deposit of 20 billion gigaquads was never explained or referred to again, leading to frustration as to why it was ever mentioned in the first place.\n\nTV.com lists \"Twisted\" with a rating of 7.9/10 as of 2018, based on 179 votes. It had a Nielsen rating of 5.6 points when it was broadcast in 1995.\n\n\n"}

By the 1920s no significant such circulating libraries by music publishers survived, most probably due to reduced demand (the interested public would just buy the music they were interested in). In terms of the housed collections/music in such \"libraries\" run by publishers, it is probably fair to say that most was lost, with only some still being in music publisher's archives.\n\nMessrs. Schuermann & Co. were probably the first music publisher in the United Kingdom to start a \"Universal Circulating Music Library\" in 1855. An announcement at the time stated: \n'Many of our readers will be glad to have their attention directed towards the very comprehensive Music Library which has been formed by Messrs. Schuermann & Co., of 72, Newgate-street. The catalogue contains more than 42,042 separately numbered works, embracing almost every English and Foreign publication, under various headings and subdivisions.\n\nLibraries of reference are of such absolute necessity to all students, especially to the musician, that several attempts have been made to satisfy the want; but most of these labor under the serious disadvantage of being confined to either one class of musical works, or—as in the case of the British Museum—of being available only to those who can go from home to study.\n\nMessrs. Schuermann’s arrangements allow of a very liberal supply of works at the subscriber’s private residence, And the small annual cost would be well bestowed even by those who ultimately intend to purchase a private library for their own use, because it affords so complete an oppoortunity of examining the merits of a work previously to purchase. A very handsomely printed catalogue may be purchased at small cost; its perusal will fully prove the great outlay at which the proprietors have got together this collection.'\n\nThe \"Universal Circulating Music Library\" provided by Novello, Ewer & Co. dates back to 1867/68. The preface of the first catalogue states:\n\nThe Universal Circulating Music Library:\nThis Library, which was established, and has been most successfully carried on since 1859, by Messrs. Ewer and Co., has been purchased by Messr. Novello and Co., and will be continued by them under the style of Novello, Ewer and Co.\nIn addition to the works named in the Library Catalogue, the whole of the publications of Messr.

A survey completed in 2017 indicated that game development in Australia employed 928 people. In fiscal year 2016-17, revenue from Australian game developers was approximately $118.5 million, 80 percent of which was from overseas sales.\n\nThe industry body for video games in Australia is the Interactive Games & Entertainment Association. The Game Developers Association of Australia supports video game development.\n\nVideo game retailers in Australia include EB Games and Gametraders. Video games are also sold at department stores like Big W and Target.\n\nBeam Software was one of the first Australian game development studios to achieve global success, with a text adventure adaption of The Hobbit released in 1982 for the ZX Spectrum. The company went on to produce other successful titles including The Way of the Exploding Fist for Commodore 64 in 1985 and Le Mans for the SEGA Dreamcast in 2001. Ozisoft, a major distributor of games, was established in 1982.\n\nOther early game development studios in Australia include SSG, who developed Reach for the Stars in 1983, and Micro Forté, founded by John De Margheriti in 1985.\n\nJohn De Margheriti later established the Academy of Interactive Entertainment (AIE) in 1996 and founded the Game Developers Association of Australia (GDAA) in 1999. The first president of the GDAA was Adam Lancman, who had previously worked at Beam Software.\n\nThe Game Wizards, an Australian video game retailer, was established in 1990. It was the first retailer to sell games online in Australia when it set up its website in 1997. In 2007, the company's 22 stores were acquired by GAME and re-branded. By 2009 GAME Australia had expanded to over 100 stores.\n\nEB Games entered the market as a video game retailer in 1997.\n\nIn 2002, the Interactive Entertainment Association of Australia (IEAA) was established as an industry association for publishers, distributors and marketers of video games. A research report published by the association in 2005 found that the 76 per cent of households had a device for playing video games, 38 per cent of gamers were female and the average age of a gamer was 24. The IEAA was later renamed the Interactive Games & Entertainment Association (IGEA).\n\nIn 2005, the top three games by units sold were Gran Turismo 4, and Pokémon Emerald. The most popular game genres were strategy, adventure and action.\n\nTeam Bondi, a Sydney-based independent third-party game developer, was founded in 2003. The studio was responsible for the Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 title \"L.A. Noire\", published by multinational video game developer and publisher Rockstar Games (also popular for the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series). \"L.A. Noire\" was both a critical and commercial success, with over 5 million sales. Despite this, Team Bondi was wound up on 5 October 2011.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2015, a number of other large studios operating in Australia shut down including KMM Brisbane, Pandemic Studios, Krome Studios, THQ, Visceral Games and 2K Australia.\n\nDuring the same period, smaller game developers were having success with mobile games. In 2010, Halfbrick, a studio based in Brisbane, released Fruit Ninja which has since been downloaded over a billion times. Other notable mobile games developed in Australia include Crossy Road and Framed. In October 2015, half of the top 10 mobile games in the App Store were Australian made.\n\nEB Games held the first EB Expo video game convention at the Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre in 2011. The expo was attended by over 10,000 people. The expo moved to the Sydney Showground for 2012 and was held there annually until the expo returned to the Gold Coast in 2017. 36,750 people attended the expo in 2015.\n\nAt PAX Prime 2012, it was announced that PAX would expand internationally to Australia. PAX Australia was held for the first time in 2013 at the Melbourne Showgrounds.

The subsequent report was tabled on 29 April 2016.\n\nVideo games could not be designated an adults only or 18+ rating in Australia until 1 January 2013. An R18+ classification rating has been available for this purpose for other forms of media since the introduction of the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995. Prior to 1 January 2013, a video game that had content deemed unsuitable for persons under the age of 18 would be 'Refused Classification' by the Australian Classification Board (ACB) under this act. Classification of video games is mandatory in Australia and material refused classification is legally banned from sale, hire or import.\n\nNotable video games that were refused classification by the ACB prior to the introduction of an R18+ for video games include: Duke Nukem 3D, Grand Theft Auto III, , , Grand Theft Auto IV, Fallout 3, Left 4 Dead 2, Mortal Kombat (2011) and . Most of these games were subsequently modified by the publishers and later reclassified MA15+ and made available for sale in Australia.\n\nOn 22 July 2011, the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General agreed in-principle to introduce legislation that would allow video games to be classified R18+. Amendments to the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995 came into effect on 1 January 2013 to allow video games to receive the adults only rating. Games that were refused classification prior to 1 January 2013 can be designated an R18+ rating and made available for sale in Australia if the publisher of the game applies for re-classification and pays a fee.\n\nGames can still be refused classification and banned from sale if they depict, express or otherwise deal with matters of sex, drug misuse or addiction, crime, cruelty, violence or revolting or abhorrent phenomena in such a way that they offend against the standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults to the extent that they should not be classified.\n\nNotable video games that have been refused classification since the introduction of an R18+ for video games include: Saints Row IV, , and Outlast 2.\n\nMaterial which is refused classification is put on the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service list of prohibited items.

{"id": "44273673", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44273673", "title": "Yup'ik dancing", "text": "Yup'ik dancing\n\nYup'ik dancing (or dance) or Yuraq, also Yuraqing (Yup'ik \"yuraq\" \"yurak\" \"yurat\" ) is a traditional Eskimo style dancing form usually performed to songs in Yup'ik, with dances choreographed for specific songs which the Yup'ik people of southwestern Alaska. Also known as Cup'ik dance for the Chevak Cup'ik dialect speaking Eskimos of Chevak and Cup'ig dance for the Nunivak Cup'ig dialect speaking Eskimos of Nunivak Island. Yup'ik dancing is set up in a very specific and cultural format. Typically, the men are in the front, kneeling and the women stand in the back. The drummers are in the very back of the dance group. Dance is the heart of Yup’ik spiritual and social life. Every song has a story behind it and some songs is either about hunting or berry picking. Some songs could be about sports or other things that don't really relate to hunting. Traditional dancing in the qasgiq is a communal activity in Yup’ik tradition. The mask (\"kegginaquq\") was a central element in Yup'ik ceremonial dancing.\n\nEskimo dancing of their ancestors was banned by Christian missionaries in the late 19th century as \"primitive idolatry\". After a century, Cama-i dance festival is a cultural celebration that started in the mid 1980s with a goal to gather outlying village Eskimo dancers to share their music and dances. There are now many dance groups who perform Eskimo dances in Alaska. Most popular activity in the Yup'ik-speaking Eskimo area is rediscovered Yup'ik dancing.\n\nBoth Yup'ik and Iñupiaq dancing are also known as Eskimo dancing or Eskimo dance in Alaska.\n\nThe most obvious ways in which the Eskimo dancing of northwestern Alaska (known as Iñupiaq style Eskimo dance) differs from that of southwestern Alaska (known as Yup'ik style Eskimo dance) are in: the beating of the frame-drum from below, rather than from above; the standing, rather than the kneeling, of the male dancers; the very small use of decorative dance fans (\"de rigueur\" in the south); and the considerable musical ceremonialism that still survives (which never developed as much in the south and southwest of Alaska, although it certainly existed there).\n\n\"Yuraryaraq\" \"Yuraryarat\" (lit. \"way[s] of dancing\") or \"Yupiit Yuraryarait\" (lit. \"Yup'ik ways of dancing\") embrace six fundamental key entities identified as \"ciuliat\" (ancestors), \"angalkuut\" (shamans), \"cauyaq\" (drum), \"yuaruciyaraq\" (song structures), \"yurarcuutet\" (regalia) and \"yurarvik\" (dance location).\n\nThe ancestors (\"ciuliaq\" \"ciuliat\" , \"ciuliaput\" \"our ancestors\") are regarded with respect and believed to be part of the living in Yup'ik epistemology.\n\nThe shaman (\"angalkuq\" \"angalkuk\" \"angalkut\" ) played a functional role in dance. The role of shaman as the primary leader, petitioner, and a trans-mediator between the human and non-human spiritual worlds in association with music, dance, and masks. The shaman’s professional responsibility was to enact ancient forms of prayers to request for the survival needs of the people. The specified masks depicted survival essentials requested in ceremonies. Shamans often carved the symbolic masks that were vital to many Yup'ik ceremonial dances and this masks represented spirits that the shaman saw during visions. \"Nepcetat\" (powerful ceremonial masks) were empowered by shamans. Shamans wearing masks of bearded seal, moose, wolf, eagle, beaver, fish, and the north wind were accompanied with drums and music.\nThe drum (\"cauyaq\" \"cauyak\" \"cauyat\" ) is only instrument in yuraryaraq. Drum that is accompanied with a drum stick (\"cauyaun\", \"mumeq\", \"mengruq\"). The drum is made with a round bentwood frame crafted with a designed handle. Traditionally, the drumskin (\"eciq\" or \"cauyam ecia\") was made out of fine mammal stomach lining. The drum was to be treated with respect and used for ceremonial purposes. The Yup'ik calendar clearly marks the seasons and seasonal rounds of activity. The November (\"Cauyarvik\" in Nelson Island dialect, \"Causarvik\" in Kotlik dialect, lit. \"place for drumming”) is the time for drumming.\n\nThe song structures (\"yuaruciyaraq\" ) in ceremonies are composed and choreographed differently. The ceremonies are accompanied with music and must adhere to specific composition formalities as practiced by Yup’ik ancestors. This musical forms of songs are warm-up chorus (\"ayakata’aryaraq\"), chorus (\"agnera\"), first verse (\"apalluan ciuqlia\"), voiceless motion (\"cauyarialnguq\"), second verse (\"apalluan kinguqlia\"), encore (\"pamyua\").\n\nThe dance regalia (\"yurarcuun\" \"yurarcuutek\" \"yurarcuutet\" ) includes \"qaliq\" (fancy fur parka), \"nasqurrun\" (wolf/wolverine/caribou beaded headdress), \"uyamik\" (beaded necklaces), \"tegumiak\" (finger mask or woven grass caribou dance fans), \"piluguuk\" (decorated boots), and ivory/beaded earrings. Men wear round wooden fans with waterfowl or owl feathers. Today, both female and male dancers wear designed qaspeq (hand-sewn calico pullover clothing).\n\nDance mask (\"kegginaquq\" \"kegginaquk\" \"kegginaqut\" ) was a central element in Yup'ik ceremonial dancing.\n\nDance fans or finger masks or maskettes (\"tegumiaq\" \"tegumiak\" \"tegumiat\" ): Hand-held fans accentuate the fluid movements of a dancer’s arms. They were used in traditional winter ceremonies and continue as part of contemporary Yup’ik dance regalia. Men’s fans, like this pair, have feathers inserted into wooden hoops.\n\nDance headdress (\"nasqurrun\" \"nasqurrutek\" \"nasqurrutet\" ): Women wore similar headdresses, which remain a part of modern Yup’ik dance regalia for both sexes.\n\nThe dance location (\"yurarvik\" \"yurarviik\" \"yurarviit\" lit. \"place for dancing”). The qasgiq is where people danced in ancient times. The qasgiq, was the community center for ceremonies and festivals which included singing, dancing, and storytelling.\n\nThe Yuraq (\"yuraq\" \"yurak\" \"yurat\" ) is use generic term for Yup'ik/Cup’ik regular dance. Also, yuraq is concerned with animal behaviour and hunting of animals, or with ridicule of individuals (ranging from affectionate teasing to punishing public embarrassment). But, use for inherited dance is Yurapik or Yurapiaq (\"yurapiaq ~ yurapik\" \"yurapiit\" , lit. \"real dance\") and yurapik long story dance performed by women, or is a dance style that relates to dance sequences that have no associated song [and] are owned by individuals and passed down through family lines.\n\nTypes of dances are \"nangercelluku\" (first dances), \"yagirat\" (motions dances), \"cukaqautet\" (fast beat dances), \"ciuqitet\" (contemporary dances), \"ingulautet\" (slow dances). Rhythmic dances combined distinct gestures, story-telling, songs and the use of drums and masks. There were six styles of yuraq: \"arula\" dances consisting of yuraq, verse and chorus; \"yurapiat\" (storytelling dances); \"ingula\" dances, which were slow, oldstyle dances performed by women following berry harvests; \"pualla\" dances, primarily performed by men; \"yurat\" done to \"taitnauq\" songs; and \"telciqata'arcutet\", or proper entrance dances.\n\nThe reasons of the discrediting of traditional native dances are the effects of social changes that came about in the late 19th century as a result of fur trade, epidemics, and missionary activity. Along with the expansion of Europeans and Americans into Alaska were accompanying hardships for the indigenous people: epidemic diseases, strong Christian missionary activities, and western educational policies such as English language-only rules. Ancestral Eskimo dancing and non-Christian festivities, traditional ceremonies, and shamanistic rites were discouraged or even demonized and banned by Christian missionaries in the late 19th century as \"primitive idolatry\". Shamanistic rituals are no longer practiced, although some elders have information about these rites. Song and dance have remained. The Moravian Church had banned dancing from the villages. Yuraq dancing feasts between villages in the King Salmon and Naknek region were forbidden by Russian Orthodox priests as of 1933. Dancing as part of Yup'ik feasts no longer existed as Jesuit missionaries forbade it at the end of the 19th century. Many of these spiritual ceremonies, such as the \"Agayuyaraq\", an intervillage ceremony associated with the performance of masked dances usually at the end of the winter season, were abandoned. Masked dances and the Kelek (masquerade) dances were among the first to be removed from Yup'ik practice. Because of their highly spiritual content, dances were considered dangerous by missionaries who called them \"heathen idol worship, devil's frolic and black art\".\n\nThere are now many dance groups who perform Eskimo dances in Alaska. There are many performances and festivals, however, that are more traditional in their role. Masked dances especially have served as a strong reminder of the connection to the worlds of animals and spirits. Dances embody the Yup'ik conception of the world. The beliefs that stem from this conception are the models by which Yup'iks live. Today, a dance festival, both in preparation and the actual event, consumes an entire village with its significance, just as it did in pre-contact times.\n\nThe first Yup'ik dance festival is Yupiit Yuraryarait (lit. \"Yup'ik ways of dancing\") started in 1982 at St. Mary's (\"Negeqliq\"), fostering a revival of the traditions of the Yup’ik people. Concerned about the survival of Yup’ik cultural heritage, the Negeqliq first brought together artists where traditional dancing was still practiced to participate in a festival designed to pass on dance traditions to younger generations. Nine villages in Yukon–Kuskokwim Delta came to that intervillage festival. The success of that event stimulated the creation of dance festivals throughout the lower Yukon River region. The Yupiit Yuraryarait is a dance festival that is now held every three or four years.\n\nThe second Yup'ik dance festival is Cama-i (lit. \"hello; greetings; pleased to meet you; good to see you again\") started in 1984 in Bethel (\"Mamterilleq\"). Traditional dancers from all over Alaska and beyond participate every March in the Cama-i dance festival. Bethel is unique in the region in having an astounding diversity of cultures, including a large contingent of Koreans. The Cama-i dance festival, an annual event in Bethel in the spring, hosts Alaska Native dancers from all over the state as well as Korean and Japanese dancers, and dancers from other regions of the world and the nation.\n\n\n"}
