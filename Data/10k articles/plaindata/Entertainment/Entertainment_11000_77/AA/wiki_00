{"id": "1277119", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1277119", "title": "Al-Manar", "text": "Al-Manar\n\nAl-Manar (Arabic:المنار \"al-Manār\";English: \"the beacon\") is a Lebanese satellite television station affiliated with Hezbollah, broadcasting from Beirut, Lebanon.\n\nAl-Manar was designated as a “Specially Designated Global Terrorist entity,” and banned by the United States on 17 December 2004. \nIt has also been banned by France, Spain, and Germany,\nand has run into some service and license problems outside Lebanon, making it unavailable in the Netherlands, Canada, and Australia, while it has not officially been banned in any of these regions.\n\nAl-Manar first began terrestrial broadcasting from Beirut, Lebanon on 4 June 1991. By 2000, the station began broadcasting via satellite at a cost that was a couple of million dollars. The station was located in the predominantly Shi'a neighborhood of Haret Hreik in the southern suburbs of Beirut, where the Hezbollah is also headquartered. Originally, the station employed only a few men that had studied media in London during the mid-1980s. But almost a year later, Al-Manar was employing over 150 people.\n\nInitially, Al Manar would broadcast only five hours per day. Shortly before the 1992 election, it began broadcasting regular news bulletins in order to help Hezbollah attain more votes and spread its message to more people. In 1993, the station expanded its broadcasting to seven hours a day and extended its signal to the southern part of the Bekaa Valley. Ahead of the 1996 Lebanese parliamentary elections, additional antennas were erected in Northern Lebanon and throughout the Mount Lebanon range, so that the station could be viewed not only in Lebanon, but also in western Syria and northern Israel. Broadcasting was extended to 20 hours in 1998 but reduced to 18 hours in 2000.\n\nIn 1996, the Lebanese government granted broadcasting licenses to only five television stations, not including Al-Manar. Approximately 50 stations were forced to close at the time. Several stations appealed the government's decision, but only four of them were finally granted licenses, one of which was Al-Manar. On 18 September, the Lebanese Cabinet decided to grant Al-Manar a license after having been requested to do so by then Syrian president Hafiz al-Asad. Al-Manar received the license in July 1997.\n\nAccording to the US department of treasury, Al Manar is the media arm of the Hezbollah. The station manager Muhammad Afif Ahmad, said that Al Manar belongs to Hezbollah culturally and politically. By 2004, Al Manar was estimated to hold 10-15 million viewers daily worldwide.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the popularity of satellite broadcasting greatly increased in the Arab world and in Lebanon. The first Lebanese station to use this technology was Future Television, launching Future International SAT in 1994, while LBCI and the Lebanese government followed by launching LBCSAT and Tele Liban Satellite respectively. In order to compete with these emerging stations, and in order to find an international audience, Al-Manar announced its intention to launch a satellite channel on 9 March 2000. Muhammad Ra'd, a Hezbollah member of parliament and al-Manar's largest shareholder, submitted the request to the minister of transmission, which was approved in April 2000. Although the launch of the satellite station was originally planned for July, the date was moved up in order to coincide with the end of the Israeli occupation of South Lebanon on 25 May. This success led other television stations to follow in launching satellite stations, including Murr TV in November 2000, but it was shut down for \"violating an election law prohibiting propaganda\" — a fate which al-Manar did not meet, although its programming was also considered propaganda by many analysts . ArabSat, a leading communications satellite operator in the Middle East, headquartered in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, was at first wary about collaborating with al-Manar, because of the station's Shi'a agenda — the two companies agreed, however, that the programming would be adapted to the pan-Arab audience, leading to a slight difference between the local broadcast and the one via satellite. At first, only three hours of satellite programming were broadcast per day, but by December 2000, the station was broadcasting around the clock.\n\nAl-Manar was soon carried by many satellite providers. However, starting with the removal of the station from TARBS World TV in Australia in 2003, many satellite television providers stopped featuring it. Until then the station was featured by the following providers at one time or another:\n\nAccording to the BBC on 26 July 2006, Al-Manar had three satellite signals:\n\nThe channel was continuously struck by missiles during Israeli air raids. The Israeli Air Force attacks on 13 July 2006 led to injury of three employees. The attack on Al Manar's facilities shortly followed another strike against the Rafic Hariri International Airport in Beirut earlier that morning. Despite the attack, the station remained on air, broadcasting from undisclosed locations.\n\nThe IDF bombed Al-Manar's Beirut complex again on July 16 causing fire in the complex and surrounding buildings. The station's signal disappeared briefly several times, then continued normal programming.\n\nThe bombing of media outlets violates international law when they are not being used for military purposes (\"it is unlawful to attack facilities that merely shape civilian opinion; neither directly contributes to military operations\"), according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nThis incident has been condemned by the International Federation of Journalists. The Israel Association of Journalists withdrew from the federation due to this criticism, claiming that Al-Manar employees \"are not journalists, they are terrorists\".\n\nThe New York based Committee to Protect Journalists, has also expressed alarm over the incident as \"it (Al-Manar) does not appear based on a monitoring of its broadcasts today to be serving any discernible military function, according to CPJ’s analysis.\"\n\nAl-Manar's programming consists of 25% music videos and fillers, 25% series and dramas, 25% talk shows, and finally 25% news and family shows. Most of the programming is self-produced, although on occasion, programming from IRIB (Iran) is used. The point-of-view of the programming is strongly anti-Israel and anti-US. \"Appearing on al-Manar, Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah frequently calls for `Death to America`\" and the Statue of Liberty is depicted \"as a ghoul, her gown dripping blood, a knife instead of a torch in her raised hand.\"\n\nThe news programming includes much footage from the international press, especially the Israeli. Additionally the station subscribes to the following wire services: Reuters, Associated Press, Agence France Presse, and Deutsche Presse Agentur. It also sources stories from Iranian news agencies such as FARS and IRNA. The station airs eight news bulletins a day in Arabic in addition to one in English and one in French.\n\nSeveral talk shows are regularly aired on al-Manar. The best known of these is \"Beit al-ankabut\" (\"The Spider's House\"); its title alludes to a metaphor, Hassan Nasrallah often employs to describe Israel. It is dedicated to uncovering the \"weakness of the Zionist entity\", i.e. Israel. It attempts to convince the Arab world that Israel could easily be destroyed, for example, by an increase in the Arab population and the implementation of the Palestinian right of return. Further talk shows include \"Hadith al-sa'a\" (\"Talk of the Hour\"), \"Matha ba'ad\" (\"What's Next?\"), \"Ma'al Hadath\" (\"With The Event\"), \"Bayna Kawsayn\" (\"Between The Brackets\"), \"Milafat\" (\"Files\"), \"Al-din wa al-hayat\" (\"Religion and Life\"), and \"Nun wa al-qalam\" (\"The 'Nun' and the Pen\"). Guests include well-known journalists, analysts, writers, Lebanese politicians, spokespersons of terrorist groups, and Islamic scholars, who then discuss current religious, political, and cultural, regional and global topics.\n\nAl-Manar often airs music videos and fillers in between full-length programs and during commercial breaks. The music videos are generally dedicated to the following seven purposes: the promotion of the Hezbollah, highlighting the importance of armed resistance against Israel, the glorification of martyrdom, spreading of anti-Americanism, denunciation of Israel and Zionism as the embodiments of terrorism, the appeals for the destruction of Israel, and the depiction of the future of Arab youths. The videos are on average three minutes long. The videos are usually professionally produced by the station itself and each usually takes about three to four days to make. The filler material usually consists of appeals to donate money to the Hezbollah, lists of demonstrations taking place worldwide, and slogans in English, Hebrew, or Arabic.\n\nThe station also offers sports broadcasting - such as the programs \"Goal\" and \"Tis'in daqiqa\" (\"Ninety Minutes\") -, family programming - such as \"Al-mustakshifoun al-judud\" (\"The New Explorers\"), \"Al-Muslimoun fi al-Sin\" (\"Muslims in China\"), and \"Ayday al-khayr\" (\"Hands of Benevolence\") -, game shows - including \"Al-mushahid shahid\" (\"The Viewer Is the Witness\"), where contestants attempt to guess the names of Israeli political and military figures, and \"Al-muhima\" (\"The Mission\") -, and even a children's program called \"Al-manr al-saghir\" (\"The Little Manar\"), which is in the style of the US show \"Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood\", targeting three- to seven-year-olds. Al-Manar also broadcasts Iranian soap operas, dubbed into Modern Standard Arabic.\n\nDuring Ramadan, al-Manar features special programs, many of which are self-produced. In 2001, \"Izz al-Din al-Qassam: Qisat al-jihad wa al-muqawama\" (\"Izz al-Din al-Qassam: A Story of Jihad and Resistance\"), a four-part drama based on the life of Izz al-Din al-Qassam, an early-twentieth-century Arab, after whom the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades are named. It was considered a success among Palestinians. The 2002 program \"Faris bi la jawad\" (\"A Knight without a Horse\"), which was produced by an Egyptian, was based on \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\", an old Russian anti-Semitic text claiming a conspiracy of Jews control the world, like many programs of the station. The 29-part series \"Ash-Shatat\" (\"The Diaspora\"), which was aired in 2003, was also based on \"The Protocols\" and produced in Syria; it led to the banning of al-Manar in France.\n\nAl-Manar was the first TV station to report Hezbollah's condemnation of the September 11 attacks. Other non-state attacks against the United States have also been condemned on Al Manar, including the 2000 USS \"Cole\" bombing suicide attack against a US Navy destroyer.\n\nAl-Manar was once described as one of the channels, among other complex reasons, of the spread of Shiism in Syria in the years before 2009.\n\nUntil the Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon, al-Manar's programming political focus was mainly against the Israeli presence in Lebanon. While the withdrawal in May 2000 left a void in the station's programming, Hezbollah and al-Manar consider the Shebaa Farms to be Lebanese territory occupied by Israel, and this became a focal point for political programming. In September of that year, the al-Aqsa Intifada broke out, and al-Manar began to cover the issue of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict more extensively, overtly propagandizing to support the Palestinian militants.\n\nAccording to Al Manar's news director, Hassan Fadlallah, Al Manar does not aim to be neutral in its broadcasting, \"Neutrality like that of Al Jazeera is out of the question for us,\" Fadlallah said. \"We cover only the victim, not the aggressor. CNN is the Zionist news network, Al Jazeera is neutral, and Al Manar takes the side of the Palestinians...He said Al Manar's opposition to neutrality means that, unlike Al Jazeera, his station would never feature interviews or comments by Israeli officials. \"We're not looking to interview Sharon,\" Fadlallah said. \"We want to get close to him in order to kill him.\"\n\nAl-Manar was placed on a US terrorist watchlist in December 2004. Reporters without Borders said that no evidence was presented of Al-Manar's involvement with terrorism. The main evidence provided for Al-Manar being anti-semitic was its partial showing, in October–November 2003, of the Syrian-produced 29-part series \"Ash-Shatat\" (\"The Diaspora\"). \"Al Manar management apologized for airing the series, dropped it and explained that the Station had purchased it without first viewing the entire series.\" Lebanon's ambassador to the United States, Farid Abboud, protested: \"If you want simply to demonize or eliminate one side, you're not going to advance the issue. If you are going to focus on one side simply because of the political message, it's unacceptable and it's a grave breach of the freedom of speech.\".\n\nIn March 2006 Al-Manar was designated as a \"Specially Designated Global Terrorist entity\" by the United States, declaring it \"owned or controlled by the Iran-funded Hezbollah terrorist network\". As a result, Al-Manar was made subject to US sanctions.\n\nOne of the satellite providers which has transmitted Al-Manar is the French satellite Hot Bird 4, owned by the Eutelsat Satellite organisation. On 13 December 2004, the French Conseil d'État, the highest administrative Court in France, ordered the French-based Eutelsat Company to shut down Al-Manar broadcasts following accusations that its programmes were anti-Semitic and could incite hatred.\n\nAl-Manar claims the French decision was political and not legal, influenced by Israel and Jewish lobbies.\n\nAl-Manar's broadcasts have been banned by the US, France, Spain, and Germany.\n\nAfter the U.S. Department of State placed Al-Manar on the Terrorist Exclusion List on 17 December 2004, transmissions to North America via Intelsat's satellites were blocked. Javed Iqbal, a resident of New York City is the first person to charged under this law. Iqbal, 45, a Pakistani who had been living in the U.S. for more than 25 years, was charged by federal prosecutors with providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization by broadcasting Al Manar to U.S. customers, in exchange for thousands of dollars payment. In a 2008 plea bargain, he agreed to serve a prison term of up to years. Saleh Elahwal, who also operates HDTV, was also charged and went on trial 5 January 2009. Donna Lieberman, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, says it's constitutional for the government to outlaw businesses with direct operational ties to terrorist organizations, and media outlets that directly incite and direct violent action, but in this case, the government is trying to stop the spread of ideas. Mark Dubowitz, who founded the Coalition Against Terrorist Media to in part stop Al-Manar, said Al-Manar was shouting fire in a crowded theater, although Lieberman disagreed with that metaphor.\n\nThe Dutch Media Authority \"discovered that a satellite owned by New Skies Satellites was carrying Al-Manar and has ordered the company to stop doing so, because the channel did not have the required Dutch licence.\" Many, including Radio Netherlands Worldwide Media Network consider this to be a ban. The Spanish authorities banned the retransmission of Al-Manar by Hispasat on 30 June 2005 (which effectively prevents its reception not only in the Iberian Peninsula but also in South America).\n\nThe lack of transmission from Intelsat had the effect of making Al-Manar unavailable in Canada, which some have interpreted as a \"ban\". While Al-Manar is not approved for distribution in Canada, there is no record of application for approval having been made.\n\nTARBS World TV voluntarily stopped broadcasting al-Manar in Australia on 5 November 2003, 15 days into an investigation by the ABA regarding accusations of \"broadcast programs that are likely to incite or perpetuate hatred against or gratuitously vilify any person or group on the basis of their ethnicity, nationality, race or religion\". The report for this investigation was never finalised as TARBS had gone into receivership by that time. Al-Manar in August 2009 received approval for broadcast by Australian Communications and Media Authority.\n\nAl-Manar provides a live feed of its programming on the Internet through its website. This effectively circumvents the bans as Al-Manar is still available in all the areas it does not broadcast to via satellite.\n\nOn 25 July 2012, Al Manar launched an application through Apple's iTunes app store, directing users to various content produced by the Hezbollah television station, including speeches by Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah.\n\nHowever, the application was subsequently pulled from iTunes four days later, and two days after that, Google announced that the al-Manar app had been removed from Google Play. Maha Abouelenein, Head of Communications for the Mena at Google, subsequently stated that “We remove applications that violate our policies, such as apps that are illegal or that promote hate speech” although she added that “We don’t comment on individual applications — however, you can check out our policies for more.\"\n\nAl Manar TV subsequently blamed \"Israeli incitement against Al Manar TV\" as the reason Al-Manar mobile apps were removed by Apple and Google. An Al-Manar TV reporter stated that: \"Al Manar TV is once again targeted by America and Israel. The removal of the channel's mobile apps from the Google and Apple stores is a new attempt to curb Al-Manar's message of resistance.\n\nAl Manar TV Director-General Abdallah Qasir stated that the removal of the apps \"indicates that Al Manar TV has the ability to cause great harm to Israel, and that Israel is extremely annoyed by Al Manar becoming so widespread and by its great credibility. Israel cannot even bear to see the Al-Manar icon on smartphones.\" Abd Al-Hadi Mahfouz, president of the Lebanese National Media Council, also supported Al-Manar, arguing that: \"This move contradicts all laws pertaining to radio and television, to the exercising of media liberties, and to the right of citizens, Western and Arab alike, to information.\" Rabi' Al-Ba'lbaki, the head of the Lebanese IT Association reportedly called for a boycott of Apple and Google if they do not restore service for Al-Manar's applications.\n\nIn a statement issued on 16 August 2012, Al Manar says it is “back on Ipad and Iphone applications via alternative ways, following the campaign carried out by the Jewish Anti-Defamation League to deactivate Al-Manar applications on smart phones at Google Play and apple store.” In an effort to avoid distributor policies and control, the new applications are downloadable directly from Al-Manar’s website, which is hosted British server. The website also provides instructions, along with screen shots, on configuring Android phones to accept applications “not sourced in Android Market” and for installing the application on iPhones.\n\nIn March 2014, Al Manar relaunched their application in Apple's iTunes store under the name \"LCG.\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "141958", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=141958", "title": "Animation in the United States in the television era", "text": "Animation in the United States in the television era\n\nTelevision animation developed from the success of animated movies in the first half of the 20th century. The state of animation changed dramatically in the three decades starting with the post-World War II proliferation of television. While studios gave up on the big-budget theatrical short cartoons that thrived in the 1930s and 1940s, new television animation studios would thrive based on the economy and volume of their output. By the end of the 1970s and 1980s, most of the Golden Age animators had retired or died, and their younger successors were ready to change the industry and the way that animation was perceived.\n\nCartoons in the Golden Age, such as \"Red Hot Riding Hood\", contained topical and often suggestive humor, though they were seen primarily as \"children's entertainment\" by movie exhibitors. This point of view prevailed when the new medium of television began showing cartoons in the late 1950s.\n\nOne of the first images to be broadcast over television was that of Felix the Cat. In 1938, cartoonist Chad Grothkopf's eight-minute experimental \"Willie the Worm\", cited as the first animated film created for TV, was shown on NBC.\n\nAs TV became a phenomenon and began to draw audiences away from movie theaters, many children's TV shows included airings of theatrical cartoons in their schedules, and this introduced a new generation of children to the cartoons of the 1920s and 1930s. Cartoon producer Paul Terry sold the rights to the Terrytoons cartoon library to television and retired from the business in the early 1950s. This guaranteed a long life for the characters of Mighty Mouse and Heckle and Jeckle, whose cartoons were syndicated and rerun in children's television programming blocks for the next 30 to 40 years.\n\nThere were a number of early experiments in limited animation television cartoons. These cartoons usually were about five minutes in length and were episodic in nature, allowing stations to flexibly program them. One of the first cartoons produced expressly for television was \"Crusader Rabbit\", a creation of Alexander Anderson and Jay Ward. A small studio in Florida was responsible for another early adventure serial, \"Colonel Bleep\". Often, existing programs would be a launching ground for new cartoon characters. In 1956, the \"Howdy Doody\" show aired the first \"Gumby\" clay animated cartoon from creator Art Clokey. Sam Singer earned a certain degree of infamy for his efforts at television animation, which included an animated adaptation of \"The Adventures of Paddy the Pelican\" (which may or may not have made it to air) and the original series \"Bucky and Pepito\", both of which have been cited as among the worst of their kind. On the other hand, a long-running series of animated shorts named \"Tom Terrific\" was produced by Terrytoons for the \"Captain Kangaroo\" show, and this series was praised by film historian Leonard Maltin as \"one of the finest cartoons ever produced for television.\" \n\nBeginning in 1954, Walt Disney capitalized on the medium of television with his own weekly TV series, \"Disneyland.\" This ABC show popularized his new Disneyland theme park and began a decades-long series of TV broadcasts of Disney cartoons, which later expanded into the show \"Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color.\" While Disney recognized that the economics of the medium could not support his production standards and refused to go into TV animation, he still ordered the creation of one character exclusive to TV, Ludwig Von Drake. The character's segments would link compilations of the company's archived theatrical shorts as complete episodes. Walt continued to host the show for the rest of his life, and he became as recognizable to the TV audience as his studio's cartoon characters.\n\nThe first major animation studio to produce cartoons exclusively for television was Hanna-Barbera Productions. When MGM closed its cartoon studio in 1957, Hanna-Barbera began producing cartoons directly for television, finding an audience in the evening \"family hour\" time. The first animated series from Hanna-Barbera were NBC's \"The Ruff & Reddy Show\" and the first-run syndication entry \"The Huckleberry Hound Show\". However, the studio hit its stride in 1960s with ABC's \"The Flintstones\", the first half-hour animated sitcom. Like many of its immediate successors it was originally aired during prime time when the whole family would be watching television. \"The Flintstones\" was the first of several prime-time animated series from Hanna-Barbera, which included \"The Jetsons\", \"Top Cat\", and \"Jonny Quest\". But after the end of \"The Flintstones\" in 1966, Hanna-Barbera largely turned its efforts to the growing market for Saturday morning cartoons, outside of isolated series for first run syndication in the 1970s such as \"Wait Till Your Father Gets Home\".\n\nHanna-Barbera was notorious for using common tropes in its series. Its original series of the late 1950s through mid-1960s all featured anthropomorphic animals, usually an adult (who would in turn impersonate a well-known celebrity) and child, interacting with the humans of their environment. After the immense success of \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\", which premiered on CBS in 1969, the next decade of Hanna-Barbera's animated output would follow that show's formula: a group of teenagers solving mysteries or fighting crime, usually with the help of a wacky animal or a ghost. The many incarnations of \"Scooby-Doo\" ran uninterrupted on CBS and then ABC for 17 seasons. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Hanna-Barbera turned to adaptations of prime time sitcoms. It was not until \"The Smurfs\" in 1981 that H-B once again had anything successful outside the \"Scooby\" template; it, in turn, led to derivative series (\"The Snorks\" and \"Paw Paws\"). The late 1980s and early 1990s saw Hanna-Barbera join the numerous studios producing younger and junior versions of cartoon characters for the Saturday morning cartoon market.\n\nOne of the problems with producing animation for television was the extremely labor-intensive animation process. While theatrical short subjects were previously produced in six-month cycles or longer, network television needed a season of 10-20 half hour episodes each year. This led to a number of shortcut techniques to speed up the production process, and the techniques of limited animation were applied to produce a great number of quickly-produced, low-budget TV cartoons. Hanna-Barbera also used limited animation for artistic reasons: with smaller, low-resolution screens, the company's namesakes reasoned that a limited style that focused on dialogue and close-up shots with bold outlines worked better than the fully detailed animation used in film shorts, which were designed for large theater screens.\n\nThe UPA studio was one of the first victims of the TV-animation market. In 1952, because of his left-wing social activism, John Hubley was dismissed from the studio under pressure from Columbia Pictures (who was itself under pressure from the HUAC). The creative atmosphere post-Hubley was not the same and UPA's theatrical shorts ended in 1959. In order to stay afloat financially, UPA turned to television to sustain itself. The TV versions of \"Mister Magoo\" and \"Dick Tracy\" were not successful and did nothing to reverse the studio's financial decline. In spite of the 1962 animated feature \"Gay Purr-ee\" (distributed by Warner Bros.), which featured the voices of Judy Garland and Robert Goulet and a Harold Arlen/Yip Harburg song score, and the beloved animated special \"Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol\", UPA was shut down in 1964.\n\nThe Jay Ward studio, producer of \"The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show,\" used limited animation in its series, but compensated with its satire of Cold War politics and popular culture and its off-beat humor. Like the earlier \"Crusader Rabbit\", the Rocky and Bullwinkle adventures were multi-part serials. The Ward studio also produced \"George of the Jungle\", \"Super Chicken\", and \"Tom Slick\". It later produced a series of popular television commercials for Quaker Oats cereals Cap'n Crunch, Quisp and Quake. Another company that used the same animation studios as Jay Ward did was Total Television, most famous for \"The Underdog Show\". Total Television and Jay Ward animated productions were often mixed and aired together in syndication, leading to the two companies' shows to sometimes be confused with each other.\n\nFilmation, headed by Lou Scheimer and Norm Prescott, was another television animation studio that arose in the 1960s. Filmation was most famous for its acquisition of licenses to produce animated series based on other media; it was one of the few companies to keep all of its animation within the United States and did not use the aesthetics of limited animation preferred by Hanna-Barbera and UPA; instead, Filmation productions relied on heavy usage of stock footage, rotoscoping, limited voice casts (Scheimer himself provided many voices) and a balance of licensed animated series with lower-budget, live-action ones (such as \"The Ghost Busters\" and \"Uncle Croc's Block\") to stay financially solvent. After a string of success lasting well into the 1980s, Filmation dissolved in 1989.\n\nOne of the most infamous users of limited animation was Cambria Studios, which invented and patented a process known as Syncro-Vox, implementing it beginning in 1960. While the process resulted in an extremely economical, quick and inexpensive product (thus making it ideal for television), it had a fatal flaw that prevented it from being taken seriously: the process involved inserting the moving lips of the voice actor over a still frame of a character's mouth. The result was that Cambria's cartoons (\"Clutch Cargo\", \"Space Angel\" and \"Captain Fathom\") contained hardly any animation at all, and were effectively pictures (albeit well-drawn ones that were of greater detail than other producers') with words. Cambria switched to a more mainstream limited animation process with \"The New Three Stooges\" in 1965, but went out of business shortly afterward.\n\nBy the late 1950s and 1960s, the perception of cartoons as children's entertainment was entrenched in the public consciousness. Animation began to disappear from movie theaters; while Disney continued to produce animated features after losing its founder, MGM and Warner Bros closed their studios, outsourced their animation, and got out of it entirely by the end of the decade. The majority of American animation came to be dominated by limited animation made for TV and aimed primarily at children. However, there were a number of attempts to challenge this perception during the late 1960s and 1970s with ambitious (and often controversial) animated projects that were definitely not for children.\n\nIn the 1960s, Walt Disney's current animated films (\"One Hundred and One Dalmatians\", \"The Sword in the Stone\", the live-action/animated combo \"Mary Poppins\", and \"The Jungle Book\") generated hefty revenue for the studio, as did the regular reissues of earlier animated films. \"Poppins\", in particular, won five Academy Awards (and received with the studio's first Best Picture nomination) and topped the 1964 box office charts while launching the film career of its star, Julie Andrews, who won an Oscar. \"Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color\", now on NBC, became a Sunday night television institution that kept Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, and Pluto in the public consciousness long after their theatrical cartoon series had ended. The anthology series ran until 1983. In 1961, Walt helped to establish the \"California Institute of the Arts.\" The founding of the institute was both a philanthropic gesture and a savvy investment by Disney, as the school provided plenty of creative talent for the company in the years to come. In 1966, the studio brought A.A. Milne's Winnie-the-Pooh characters to the screen for the first time in two of four animated featurettes (the second of which, \"Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day\", won an Oscar, the last Walt Disney received).\n\nThe Disney empire was rocked to its core when Walt died from lung cancer on December 15, 1966. While the studio tried to remain true to his vision (a common catchphrase of the time was \"What would Walt do?\"), the level of popularity and acclaim the studio received in earlier years eluded it in the 1970s. The theme parks Disneyland and Walt Disney World (the latter having opened in 1971) ended up contributing more to the bottom line than the film division. Additionally, many veteran animators either retired or died, so the studio had to find ways to replace them. In 1973, Eric Larson started a training program for new animators.\n\nThe studio's post-Walt animation fare consisted of the features \"The Aristocats\", \"Robin Hood\", \"The Rescuers\" and \"The Fox and the Hound\", the featurettes \"It's Tough to Be a Bird\", \"Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too!\", \"The Small One\", \"Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore\", and \"Mickey's Christmas Carol\", and the live-action/animation hybrids \"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\" and \"Pete's Dragon\". Some of the films got mixed reactions from critics; \"Robin Hood\", in particular, was widely criticized for re-use of animation from earlier films (especially in the production number \"The Phony King of England\"), but this was done because the film had fallen way behind schedule. Still, all of these films were successful and many of them received Academy Award nominations (with two wins, one for the short \"Bird\" and another for the special effects in \"Bedknobs\"). Additionally, in keeping with Walt's original intentions, the first three \"Pooh\" featurettes were compiled into the 1977 feature \"The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh\".\n\nThe most devastating development since Walt's death occurred in September 1979, when studio animator Don Bluth led a walkout of himself and 11 of his supporters (a large chunk of the studio's animation department at the time), including Gary Goldman and John Pomeroy. Fed up with the status quo at Disney, he and his acolytes left to start his own studio, which produced the short film \"Banjo the Woodpile Cat\" and the feature film \"The Secret of NIMH\". Disney entered the 1980s facing an uncertain future, despite the respectable $39,900,000 gross and some good reviews for \"The Fox and the Hound\".\n\nWarner Bros. shut down its animation studio completely in 1963, and the directors of Termite Terrace went their separate ways. Friz Freleng co-founded DePatie-Freleng Enterprises, which produced \"Looney Tunes\" and \"Merrie Melodies\" from 1964 to 1967. Warner Bros.-Seven Arts reopened the studio from 1967 to 1969, but the low-budget cartoons produced were not popular with critics or audiences then or now. The new characters introduced during the Seven Arts period, such as Cool Cat, Bunny and Claude, Quick Brown Fox and Rapid Rabbit, and Merlin the Magic Mouse, never caught on, while the Termite Terrace cartoons remained perennial television favorites through syndication and Saturday morning airings throughout the remainder of the 20th century.\n\nIn 1961, Chuck Jones moonlighted as a writer on the UPA feature \"Gay Purr-ee\". When Warner Bros. distributed the film the following year, they discovered that he had contributed to the film in violation of his exclusive contract and fired him. Jones teamed with Les Goldman to form Sib Tower 12 Productions to work with MGM on the \"Tom and Jerry\" series in the mid-1960s; his shorts were not as popular as the Hanna-Barbera originals but more so than the Gene Deitch shorts produced overseas in the early 1960s. Jones then began producing a number of successful animated TV specials. His most famous special was \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas!\", a 1966 CBS adaptation of the Dr. Seuss story that still remains popular and has been released on video and DVD several times. Jones also produced three animated adaptations of short stories from Rudyard Kipling's \"The Jungle Book\", a full-length MGM feature film entitled \"The Phantom Tollbooth\", and the 1970 TV version of \"Horton Hears a Who!\"\n\nAfter leaving the remnants of Termite Terrace behind for good, Friz Freleng and his new partner David H. DePatie went on to produce the \"Pink Panther\" cartoons during the 1960s and 1970s, with the cartoons appearing almost simultaneously on television and in theaters through a distribution deal with United Artists. Freleng also produced several TV specials based on Dr. Seuss books throughout the 1970s, including \"The Cat in the Hat\" and \"The Lorax\".\n\nIn 1981, Friz Freleng retired. The DePatie-Freleng Enterprises studio was sold to Marvel Comics, and it continued under his lead as Marvel Productions Ltd. This new studio focused almost exclusively on toy merchandising, and it found a new audience among young viewers with such action oriented cartoons as \"\" and \"The Transformers\".\n\nIn 1968, the music of The Beatles and the Peter Max-inspired psychedelic artwork of Canadian-born animator George Dunning came together to create \"Yellow Submarine\". Displeased with the previous animated television series depicting themselves, the Beatles themselves had reservations about the project at first and declined to participate beyond providing a mix of older and original musical recordings. However, they were impressed enough with the finished film to appear in a live action epilogue.\n\nIn 1968, Ralph Bakshi, along with producer Steve Krantz, founded Bakshi Productions, establishing the studio as an alternative to mainstream animation by producing animation his own way and accelerating the advancement of female and minority animators. He also paid his employees a higher salary than any other studio at that time. In 1969, Ralph's Spot was founded as a division of Bakshi Productions to produce commercials for Coca-Cola and \"Max, the 2000-Year-Old Mouse\", a series of educational shorts paid for by Encyclopædia Britannica. Bakshi was quoted in a 1971 article for the \"Los Angeles Times\" as saying that the idea of \"grown men sitting in cubicles drawing butterflies floating over a field of flowers, while American planes are dropping bombs in Vietnam and kids are marching in the streets, is ludicrous.\" Bakshi soon developed \"Heavy Traffic\", a tale of inner-city street life. However, Krantz told Bakshi that studio executives would be unwilling to fund the film because of its content and Bakshi's lack of film experience. While browsing the East Side Book Store on St. Mark's Place, Bakshi came across a copy of \"R. Crumb's Fritz the Cat\". Impressed by Crumb's sharp satire, Bakshi purchased the book and suggested to Krantz that it would work as a film.\n\n\"Fritz the Cat\" was the first animated film to receive an X rating from the MPAA, and is the highest grossing independent animated film of all time. With the success of his second film, \"Heavy Traffic\", Bakshi became the first person in the animation industry since Walt Disney to have two financially successful films released back-to-back.\n\nA few attempts were made to produce independent feature-length animated films in the 1970s. Several of these were decidedly adult-oriented productions, including \"Watership Down\", \"Heavy Metal,\" and a live-action/animated version of the Pink Floyd concept album \"The Wall\" (which, although produced in Britain, received wide release in the United States).\n\nOther films like Richard Williams' \"\" were less successful. The industry largely continued to ignore or dismiss animation as something only kids watched on Saturday morning television. A notable exception was a series of films based on the \"Peanuts\" franchise, beginning with the 1969 film \"A Boy Named Charlie Brown\", which was both a commercial and critical success; the films were made with the same production team behind the acclaimed \"Peanuts\" television specials that were airing throughout the time period, led by Bill Melendez.\n\nAnimation on television focused almost exclusively on children, and the tradition of getting up early to watch Saturday morning cartoons became a weekly ritual for millions of American kids. The networks were glad to oblige their demands by providing hours-long blocks of cartoon shows. Hanna-Barbera Productions became the leader in the production of TV cartoons for children. A number of other studios produced TV cartoons, such as Filmation (\"Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids\", \"The Archies\") and DePatie-Freleng Enterprises (\"The Pink Panther\"), but Hanna-Barbera had developed a virtual lock on Saturday morning cartoons by the 1970s. Such critics of Hanna-Barbera's style of limited animation as Chuck Jones referred to it disparagingly as \"illustrated radio,\" yet when one show was cancelled, the studio usually had another one ready to replace it because they were so cheap to produce.\n\nFrom the late 1960s through the early 1980s, several successful prime-time animated TV specials aired. Because these one-shot cartoons were aired during prime-time hours (and thus had to appeal to adults as well as children), they had to obtain higher ratings than their Saturday and weekday counterparts. CBS in particular allowed a large number of animated TV specials to air on its network, and several of these continue to be repeated annually and sold on video and DVD. The Rankin-Bass studio produced a number of stop-motion specials geared towards popular holidays (including \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\", \"Frosty the Snowman\", and \"Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town\"); while Bill Melendez's long-running series of \"Peanuts\" specials won numerous awards, spawned four feature films, and even launched a Saturday morning series. Other attempts to bring comic strip characters to TV did not have anywhere near as much success until one of the \"Peanuts\" directors, Phil Roman, brought the Jim Davis comic strip \"Garfield\" to TV starting in 1982, resulting in 11 specials and a long-running animated series.\n\nThis era also saw a number of independent animated short films that were rarely seen outside of \"art house\" movie theaters. As the Hollywood animation studios faded, a number of independent producers of animation continued to make experimental, artistic animated films that explored new artistic territory in the medium of animation. Short films such as \"The Critic,\" \"Bambi Meets Godzilla,\" \"Lupo the Butcher,\" and many others were almost unknown to mainstream audiences; however, these independent animated films continued to keep the yearly category of the Academy Award for Animated Short Film alive, as well as introducing a number of new names into the field of animation—names that would begin to bring change to the industry in the 1980s.\n\nThough the dominant Hanna-Barbera Productions launched a phenomenon with the 1981 premiere of \"The Smurfs\" on NBC, very little else which they produced in this decade caught on. Adding to this was the financial problems of their owner Taft Broadcasting, which was taken over by Carl Lindner, Jr., owner of Great American Insurance Company, in 1987. Two years later, Tom Ruegger launched an exodus of H-B employees to form a relaunched Warner Bros. Animation division. In 1991, Turner Broadcasting System bought the company and its library.\n\nOther studios' offerings chipped away at the H-B Saturday dominance throughout the decade, such as H-B alumni Ruby-Spears Productions' \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\", Marvel and Jim Henson's \"Muppet Babies\", DiC and Columbia's \"The Real Ghostbusters\", and Film Roman's \"Garfield and Friends\". Additionally, the Saturday morning continued to see attempts to adapt prime time series for animation, some successfully (\"Happy Days\" and its spinoffs, \"Mister T\", \"\"), others less so (\"It's Punky Brewster\", \"The Gary Coleman Show\", \"Little Rosie\"). After three decades of resistance, Disney finally entered Saturday morning in 1985 when \"The Gummi Bears\" and \"The Wuzzles\" debuted with significantly more substantial budgets; the first-run syndication success of \"DuckTales\", which premiered in 1987, eventually inspired a whole block of Disney-produced syndicated cartoons which forced competing studios to improve their own production standards to compete.\n\nThe 1980s also saw a number of cartoons based on children's toys, such as \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\", \"\", \"The Transformers\", \"My Little Pony 'n Friends\", \"He-Man\", \"\", \"Jem and the Holograms\" and \"Care Bears\". There were even cartoons based on \"Pac-Man\" video games and \"the Rubik's Cube\". Some of them even inspired feature films. While many of them were successful with children, shows like these were accused of being glorified toy commercials by parents' groups such as Action for Children's Television. These groups also objected to the level of violence in many of these shows. ACT's efforts to curb these trends resulted in the Children's Television Act, enacted in 1990 and strictly enforced by the FCC starting in 1996.\n\nThroughout this period, Japanese anime production made a limited impact on the North American market. The most notable work were the television series like \"Battle of The Planets\" and \"Star Blazers\" in the 1970s and \"Voltron\" and \"Robotech\" in the 1980s. As a rule, the imported series were heavily censored to make them acceptable to children; \"Star Blazers\" and \"Robotech\" were partial exceptions. Although their impact on the art in North America was minimal for decades, the distinctive nature of the anime series created a cult following that grew gradually until the 1980s when \"Star Blazers\" and \"Robotech\", with their complex storylines and frank depiction of violence, helped create the groundswell that would lead to the major influx of anime popularity starting in the 1990s.\n\nThe 1980s also saw the rise of the music video industry, spearheaded by MTV. Artistic experimentation in these short films often resulted in the production of innovative animated sequences that reminded viewers of the potential of animation as something other than Saturday morning cartoons. A number of memorable animated videos were produced during the heyday of MTV, including \"Take on Me\" by a-ha; \"Sledgehammer\" by Peter Gabriel; \"Money for Nothing\" by Dire Straits; and \"The Harlem Shuffle\" by The Rolling Stones (the animated sequences in this video were directed by Ralph Bakshi and John Kricfalusi).\n\n"}

{"id": "5827247", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5827247", "title": "Auction theory", "text": "Auction theory\n\nAuction theory is an applied branch of economics which deals with how people act in auction markets and researches the properties of auction markets. There are many possible designs (or sets of rules) for an auction and typical issues studied by auction theorists include the efficiency of a given auction design, optimal and equilibrium bidding strategies, and revenue comparison. Auction theory is also used as a tool to inform the design of real-world auctions; most notably auctions for the privatization of public-sector companies or the sale of licenses for use of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nAuctions are characterized as transactions with a specific set of rules detailing resource allocation according to participants' bids. They are categorized as games with incomplete information because in the vast majority of auctions, one party will possess information related to the transaction that the other party does not (e.g., the bidders usually know their personal valuation of the item, which is unknown to the other bidders and the seller). Auctions take many forms, but they share the characteristic that they are \"universal\" and can be used to sell or buy any item. In many cases, the outcome of the auction does not depend on the identity of the bidders (i.e., auctions are \"anonymous\").\n\nMost auctions have the feature that participants submit \"bids\", amounts of money they are willing to pay. \"Standard\" auctions require that the winner of the auction is the participant with the highest bid. A \"nonstandard\" auction does not require this (e.g., a lottery).\n\nThere are traditionally four types of auction that are used for the allocation of a single item:\n\n\nMost auction theory revolves around these four \"basic\" auction types. However, other auction types have also received some academic study (see Auction Types).\n\nThe \"benchmark model\" for auctions, as defined by McAfee and McMillan (1987), offers a generalization of auction formats, and is based on four assumptions:\nThe benchmark model is often used in tandem with the \"Revelation Principle\", which states that each of the basic auction types is structured such that each bidder has incentive to report their valuation honestly. The two are primarily used by sellers to determine the auction type that maximizes the expected price. This optimal auction format is defined such that the item will be offered to the bidder with the highest valuation at a price equal to their valuation, but the seller will refuse to sell the item if they expect that all of the bidders' valuations of the item are less than their own.\n\nRelaxing each of the four main assumptions of the benchmark model yields auction formats with unique characteristics:\n\nA game-theoretic auction model is a mathematical game represented by a set of players, a set of actions (strategies) available to each player, and a payoff vector corresponding to each combination of strategies. Generally, the players are the buyer(s) and the seller(s). The action set of each player is a set of bid functions or reservation prices (reserves). Each bid function maps the player's value (in the case of a buyer) or cost (in the case of a seller) to a bid price. The payoff of each player under a combination of strategies is the expected utility (or expected profit) of that player under that combination of strategies.\n\nGame-theoretic models of auctions and strategic bidding generally fall into either of the following two categories. In a private value model, each participant (bidder) assumes that each of the competing bidders obtains a random \"private value\" from a probability distribution. In a common value model, the participants have equal valuations of the item, but they do not have perfectly accurate information about this valuation. In lieu of knowing the exact valuation of the item, each participant can assume that any other participant obtains a random signal, which can be used to estimate the true valuation, from a probability distribution common to all bidders. Usually, but not always, a private values model assumes that the values are independent across bidders, whereas a common value model usually assumes that the values are independent up to the common parameters of the probability distribution.\n\nA more general category for strategic bidding is the \"affiliated values model\", in which the bidder's total utility depends on both their individual private signal and some unknown common value. Both the private value and common value models can be perceived as extensions of the general affiliated values model.\n\nWhen it is necessary to make explicit assumptions about bidders' value distributions, most of the published research assumes symmetric bidders. This means that the probability distribution from which the bidders obtain their values (or signals) is identical across bidders. In a private values model which assumes independence, symmetry implies that the bidders' values are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.).\nAn important example (which does not assume independence) is Milgrom and Weber's \"general symmetric model\" (1982). One of the earlier published theoretical research addressing properties of auctions among asymmetric bidders is Keith Waehrer's 1999 article. Later published research include Susan Athey's 2001 Econometrica article, as well as Reny and Zamir (2004).\n\nThe first formal analysis of auctions was by William Vickrey (1961). Vickrey considers two buyers bidding for a single item. Each buyer's value, v, is an independent draw from a uniform distribution with support [0,1]. Vickrey showed that in the sealed first-price auction it is an equilibrium bidding strategy for each bidder to bid half his valuation. With more bidders, all drawing a value from the same uniform distribution it is easy to show that the symmetric equilibrium bidding strategy is \nTo check that this is an equilibrium bidding strategy we must show that if it is the strategy adopted by the other n-1 buyers, then it is a best response for buyer 1 to adopt it also. Note that buyer 1 wins with probability 1 with a bid of (n-1)/n so we need only consider bids on the interval [0,(n-1)/n]. Suppose buyer 1 has value v and bids b. If buyer 2's value is x he bids B(x). Therefore buyer 1 beats buyer 2 if\n\nSince x is uniformly distributed, buyer 1 bids higher than buyer 2 with probability nb/(n-1). To be the winning bidder, buyer 1 must bid higher than all the other bidders (which are bidding independently). Then his win probability is\nBuyer 1's expected payoff is his win probability times his gain if he wins. That is,\nIt is readily confirmed by differentiation that U(b) takes on its maximum at \n\nIt is not difficult to show that B(v) is the unique symmetric equilibrium. Lebrun (1996) provides a general proof that there are no asymmetric equilibria.\n\nOne of the major findings of auction theory is the celebrated Revenue equivalence theorem. Early equivalence results focused on a comparison of revenue in the most common auctions. The first such proof, for the case of two buyers and uniformly distributed values was by . In 1979 proved a much more general result. (Quite independently and soon after, this was also derived by ).The revenue equivalence theorem states that any allocation mechanism or auction that satisfies the four main assumptions of the benchmark model will lead to the same expected revenue for the seller (and player \"i\" of type \"v\" can expect the same surplus across auction types).\n\nRelaxing these assumptions can provide valuable insights for auction design. Decision biases can also lead to predictable non-equivalencies. Additionally, if some bidders are known to have a higher valuation for the lot, techniques such as price-discriminating against such bidders will yield higher returns. In other words, if a bidder is known to value the lot at $X more than the next highest bidder, the seller can increase their profits by charging that bidder $X – Δ (a sum just slightly inferior to the sum is willing to pay) more than any other bidder (or equivalently a special bidding fee of $X – Δ). This bidder will still win the lot, but will pay more than would otherwise be the case.\n\nThe winner's curse is a phenomenon which can occur in \"common value\" settings—when the actual values to the different bidders are unknown but correlated, and the bidders make bidding decisions based on estimated values. In such cases, the winner will tend to be the bidder with the highest estimate, but the results of the auction will show that the remaining bidders' estimates of the item's value are less than that of the winner, giving the winner the impression that they \"bid too much\".\n\nIn an equilibrium of such a game, the winner's curse does not occur because the bidders account for the bias in their bidding strategies. Behaviorally and empirically, however, winner's curse is a common phenomenon. (cf. Richard Thaler).\n\nIn the Journal of Economic Literature Classification System C7 is the classification for Game Theory and D44 is the classification for Auctions.\n\n\n"}

It was released in Ireland on October 20 2006, 29 years after \"Bat Out of Hell\" (1977), and 13 years after \"\" (1993). It was released in the UK on October 23, 2006, and in the US on October 31, 2006.\n\nProduced by Desmond Child, it is the only \"Bat\" album not involving Jim Steinman in its production. The album was subject to a legal dispute between Meat Loaf and Steinman, who had registered the phrase \"Bat Out of Hell\" as a trademark and attempted to prevent the album using the phrase. In the end, seven songs that Steinman wrote for various other projects were included.\n\nAs with its predecessors, the album received mixed reviews. A tour, named The Seize the Night Tour, followed the release, concentrating upon songs from the \"Bat\" albums.\n\nAccording to a Reuters report, Meat Loaf and Steinman started working on an album in 2001. During the concerts in his \"Hair of the Dog\" tour, Meat Loaf made a point to mention that he and Steinman were putting out a new album.\n\nThe composer suffered some health setbacks around 2004. Meat Loaf says that \"lawyers worked for over a year putting together a contract for Steinman to do \"Bat Out of Hell III\". It was one of the best producer's contracts in the history of the record business.\" Ultimately, according to the singer, Steinman was not well enough to work on such an intense project and made what he calls the \"selfish\" decision to go ahead without him. In promotional interviews he said that he did not want to wait a year and a half just to find out that Steinman was still unfit. Describing himself as a \"really loyal person,\" Meat Loaf says that \"the decision not to use Steinman has taken its toll on me.\"\n\nHowever, in 2006, David Sonenberg, Steinman's manager, said:\nJim's health is excellent. That's not the reason he didn't participate in (\"Bat III\"). He had some meaningful health problems about four years ago, but he's been totally healthy the last couple of years. His health in no way impacted on his involvement in the \"Bat Out of Hell\" project.\n\nThe development problems and confusion over Steinman's involvement is a result of a dispute of the trademark \"Bat Out of Hell\", which Steinman registered in 1995. Meat Loaf sued Steinman and his manager, in a complaint filed May 28, 2006 in federal District Court in Los Angeles, California, for $50 million and to prevent further use by the writer/producer.\n\nMeat Loaf has stated that he contributed lyrics to \"Bat Out of Hell\". He had used the phrase extensively for tours, to which Steinman had never objected \"until a recent falling out.\" Steinman and his representatives approached Meat Loaf's labels, Universal and Virgin, asserting trademark ownership and threatening litigation to prevent the album's release. An agreement was reached in Summer 2006. According to Virgin, \"the two came to an amicable agreement that ensured that Jim Steinman's music would be a continuing part of the 'Bat Out of Hell' legacy.\" In promotional interviews, Meat Loaf has played down the dispute with Steinman, pointing out that it was over in three weeks and was purely for the sake of business.\n\nI consider him to be one of my best friends but the real thing is about managers: I think Steinman's manager is the devil and Steinman feels the same way about my manager. So, we had to communicate through managers and he refused to sign some papers that would have allowed for the recording of \"Bat Out of Hell III\" without a hitch. So, really, I didn't sue Jim Steinman. I sued his manager.\n\nDespite the fact that Steinman was not involved in the recording or production, the album does include seven of his songs, five of which are covers of previously released songs. The other two were covers of Steinman's demos intended for musical theater projects, at the time unreleased. The agreement enabled Steinman to work on a musical theatre project based on all of the songs from \"Bat Out of Hell\". Describing the project as \"\"Cirque du Soleil\" on acid\", in September 2007, he expected it to open in London in 2010.\n\nMeat Loaf had announced that Michael Beinhorn was producing the record, but Desmond Child took the helm. The singer reports that Child would say things that made him think he was sitting next to Steinman. Child began recording sessions by playing Slipknot CDs to get the assembled musicians in the mood. In addition to musicians from his touring band, the Neverland Express, several guest players contributed to the album. Meat Loaf says, \"I didn't just want to bring in rock players — I wanted to go to extreme rock people\" resulting in an album that \"has all the touches of the other two \"Bats\", but it's much more of a rock album.\" Child says that one of the most memorable experiences working on the album was working with Brian May, who played on \"Bad for Good\". The album also featured guest performances by John 5, Steve Vai and John Shanks.\n\nMeat Loaf says that he does not enjoy recording in studios. He compares the process to \"going to the dentist and having root canal everyday\". Whereas you \"really\" have to be flat for people to notice it in a live show, in a studio, every \"nuance is under a microscope... and I'm a perfectionist who knows that there's no such thing as perfection but I try to get as close as I can.\"\n\nTodd Rundgren, who produced the first album and arranged all of the background vocals for \"Bat II\", arranged the background vocals for three tracks. In a promotional interview for the album Rundgren has said \"continuity is an important thing.\" However, in another interview he said that his contribution was considerably less than on some earlier Meat Loaf albums.\n\nAnd by the time they got it all organized and figured out, there were really only a couple of songs left for me to do anything on. So I came into L.A. for a couple of days and Kasim... came in, as was the routine, and we did maybe three songs... just so that I’d have a few fingerprints on the record. I think someone, maybe Meat Loaf, said that to keep everything covered, I had to be in there somewhere... but not necessarily running the whole thing. So my involvement was pretty much peripheral.\n\nThe album features three duets. Norwegian vocalist Marion Raven duets on \"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\". \"What About Love?\" features Patti Russo, who has toured with Meat Loaf for over thirteen years. Finally, Jennifer Hudson performs on \"The Future Ain't What It Used to Be\".\n\nThe album opens with the title track. \"The Monster Is Loose\" is highly influenced by the Gothic style of John 5, who plays the main guitar parts. The song is very heavy and continues Meat Loaf's association with Major League Baseball established with Phil Rizzuto's commentary on \"Paradise by the Dashboard Light.\" \"Blind as a Bat\", written by Desmond Child, tells about how one is thankful for the love another has given him, even after he has done deeds to suggest that he does not deserve such love.\n\nAccording to Steinman, \"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\" was inspired by \"Wuthering Heights\", and was an attempt to write \"the most passionate, romantic song\" he could ever create. In interviews, Meat Loaf has said that, in his mind, the song was always meant to be a duet. Norwegian artist Marion Raven, who had been working on her solo album with Child, was chosen because the timbre of her voice starkly contrasts to Meat Loaf's.\n\n\"Bad for Good\" was one of the many songs written by Steinman under the inspiration of \"Peter Pan\" and lost boys who never grow up. This is reflected in lyrics such as \"You know I'm gonna be like this forever/I'm never gonna be what I should.\" The song was written to appear on the follow-up to \"Bat Out of Hell\", but which Steinman recorded himself. Because of this, Meat Loaf was aware that there is a \"core of fans that know that song,\" so he \"had that under the microscope more than any other on the album.\"\n\n\"Cry Over Me\" is, according to Meat Loaf, a timeless song dealing with relationships of all kinds. In a 2007 interview, he says that it can be about your first or last loves, or dealing with your boss at work. Partially quoting the lyrics, the singer posits that there are times when \"you want him to feel exactly like I felt when he said that to me.\"\n\n\"The Guardian\" says \"In the Land of the Pig (The Butcher Is King)\" is \"five Olympian minutes crying out for a full production at Glyndebourne.\" Guitarist Steve Vai describes it as \"very Gothic; almost terrifying.\" It is about the intense power over subordinates:\n\n\"Monstro\" is a bombastic orchestral piece layered with chorals that lead into the piano introduction to \"Alive.\" Meat Loaf decided to hire Desmond Child when he revealed that he had written \"Alive\" especially for the album. The song refers to how the singer has overcome difficult periods in his life.\n\n\"What About Love\", a piano-based duet with Patti Russo, is a sexually charged song that echoes \"Paradise by the Dashboard Light\" from the 1977 album. Here, though, the singers are singing about love throughout, not bitterness. The final verse contains the most explicit lyrics about their first sexual encounter.\n\n\"Seize the Night\" has a strong orchestral foundation underneath the lead vocals and a choir. A duet with Jennifer Hudson, \"The Future Ain't What It Used to Be\" is a pessimistic song based upon the myth that Pandora closed her jar before allowing \"hope\" to escape (the song first appeared on the only album performed by female group Pandora's Box). The lyrics reveal the hopelessness of the past (\"Were there ever any stars in the sky?\") and the future (\"There's nothing so sad as a tomorrow gone bad\").\n\nThe final song of the \"Bat\" trilogy is a short one written by Steinman. A few lyrics of \"Cry to Heaven\" begin rather sweet, but turning rather bitter: (\"Cry baby cry/Cry, cry to heaven/If that doesn't do it for you/Go ahead and cry like hell\".) The two parts are bridged by an instrumental dominated by an Irish flute.\n\nThe cover follows the style of the previous two albums called \"Bat Out of Hell\". Julie Bell designed the cover and the artwork that appears alongside the lyrics in the booklet. She also supplied the art for the \"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\" single. The cover features the biker from the first two covers about to slay the giant bat from the second cover, while the angel from the same cover takes cover behind a destroyed pillar. Like the first two \"Bat\" albums, Steinman's songwriting is credited on the cover, this time shared with Desmond Child.\n\nThe booklet contains all of the lyrics to the songs, each page featuring a small illustration. The CD liner contains a dedication \"For thirty years of friendship and inspiration, \"Bat Out of Hell III\" is dedicated to Jim Steinman.\"\n\nThe album debuted at #8 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and sold about 81,000 copies in its opening week, his best since \"Bat Out of Hell II: Back Into Hell\". However, it slipped to #60 after three weeks. The album also reached #3 in the UK charts, but quickly fell off.\n\n\"Q\" gave the album a positive review, calling it \"the second-best album to bear the 'Bat' name\", and saying that Child did an \"impressive recreation of Steinman's Andrew Lloyd Webber-on-steroids approach\", while the album was \"overblown, frequently ridiculous and largely devoid of irony.\" They were unimpressed with the title track, suggesting that \"whoever decided it would be a good idea for Meat Loaf to tackle nu metal…should be tarred and feathered.\" \"Q\" did, however, praise the \"operatic\" vocals and May's \"fabulously hysterical guitar\" on the track \"Bad for Good\". \"The Village Voice\" named it as 'Album of the Year This Week', calling it \"absurdist, righteous majesty\".\n\nSome reviews lamented Steinman's absence. According to AllMusic, \"this \"Bat\" is quite obviously a patchwork, pieced together from things borrowed and recreated, never quite gelling the way either of the previous \"Bats\" did.\" They criticized \"The Monster Is Loose\" as a \"disarming, a grindingly metallic riff-rocker that sits very uncomfortably next to Steinman's \"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\", and Child as \"a professional who is playing a game without bothering to learn the rules.\" On the other hand, the review commended Meat Loaf's voice: he sings \"his heart out as he valiantly tries to make this \"Bat\" a worthy successor to the originals.\"\n\n\"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\" was the first song released as a single. It reached number one in Raven's native Norway, and the top ten in both the United Kingdom and Germany. \"Blind As a Bat\" was scheduled to be released in the UK on December 18, but was then put back to February 26, as two CDs. In turn, this single was pulled at the last minute, in favor of \"Cry Over Me\", which was released on May 7, 2007.\n\nP. R. Brown directed the videos for \"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\" and \"Cry over Me.\" \"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\" is an elaborate production, in which Meat Loaf is being haunted by the memory of his dead lover. Told in flashback, Raven's character crashes her car to avoid a man standing in the road. She sings as an unseen spirit following Meat Loaf. It echoes Steinman's comments that the song is about the \"dark side of love\" and the \"ability to be resurrected by it.\"\n\nThe video for \"Cry over Me\" had the lowest budget since those for the original album. A simple video, Meat Loaf has said that it only took four hours to film. The animated music video for \"The Monster Is Loose\" is about a biker who rescues a girl from an enormous bat-like creature.\n\nThe videos for \"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\", \"Cry over Me\" and \"The Monster Is Loose\" are included as bonus features on the \"3 Bats Live\" DVD, released in October 2007.\n\nAll of the Jim Steinman songs were written for other projects. Like \"Bat II\", the album contains two songs (\"It's All Coming Back...\" and \"The Future Ain't What It Used to Be\") that originally appeared on \"Original Sin\", Steinman's 1989 concept album with Pandora's Box. Steinman's demo of \"In the Land of the Pig, the Butcher Is King\" was part of the preparations for the unrealized \"Batman: The Musical\" project. Steinman's \"Cry to Heaven\" demo was intended for the possibility that Steinman would provide songs for a musical based on the film \"Cry-Baby\". \"Cry-Baby\" has since been staged, but without any work from Steinman. \"Bad for Good\" was featured as the title track on Steinman's 1981 album. Some of the songs on the \"Bad for Good\" album were once intended to be a Meat Loaf solo album. \"Seize the Night\" first appeared as \"Carpe Noctem\" in the German language musical \"Tanz der Vampire\". It was also performed in English in the 2002 Broadway show called \"Dance of the Vampires\", and demos of the song in English became widely available around that time. \"If It Ain't Broke, Break It\" first appeared in the MTV film \"Wuthering Heights\", and a recording of the song was released on the soundtrack CD for the film.\n\nA limited edition was released with an accompanying DVD, containing a short \"making of\" featurette, the animated trailer, and \"The Monster is Loose\" career montage video. The US version also includes a photo gallery and the \"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\" video.\n\nBest Buy's version of the album came with an exclusive bonus track: a live version of \"Testify\" (from \"Couldn't Have Said It Better\"). This track was originally announced to be on the CD itself, but Best Buy opted to include an insert in the packaging giving customers a code to download the song. Circuit City's version came with an exclusive downloadable track: a live version of \"Life Is a Lemon and I Want My Money Back\". Target released a \"Limited Tour Edition\" with a concert ticket pre-sale offer. Wal-Mart released the album as part of an exclusive 2-pack with the \"Meat Loaf Bat Out of Hell Classic Albums\" DVD.\n\nThe version of the album available from Apple's iTunes Store includes two bonus tracks, a live version of \"I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)\", recorded at a concert in Australia, and \"Heads Will Roll\", sung by Marion Raven from her EP of the same name.\n\nMeat Loaf embarked on a 112 date world tour to promote the album. He performed a concert performing some songs from all three \"Bat Out of Hell\" albums on October 16 at London's Royal Albert Hall, and performed many of those songs on the rest of his tour as well. He also performed a \"Bat on Broadway\" performance on November 2, 2006 at New York's Palace Theater, as well as shows in Toronto, Atlantic City, Uncasville, and Mexico City.\n\nMarion Raven joined Meat Loaf for the first leg of his 2007 tour, Seize the Night tour. She was the supporting act, promoting her \"Set Me Free\" album. Meat Loaf introduced her on stage at the latter stages of the concerts to duet on \"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\".\n\nA DVD of the tour was released in October 2007, entitled \"3 Bats Live\". It also contains a bonus disc featuring the promotional videos and animations from \"Bat III\".\n\nPortions of the tour were captured on film in the Theatrical Documentary \"\", directed by Bruce David Klein, which was released in 2008.\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "41670650", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41670650", "title": "Batman Eternal", "text": "Batman Eternal\n\nBatman Eternal is a year-long weekly limited series published by DC Comics, that began in April 2014. The series featured Batman, his allies, and Gotham City, and was written by Scott Snyder, James Tynion IV, Ray Fawkes, Kyle Higgins, and Tim Seeley. John Layman was originally scheduled to write for the series as well, before leaving the project in January 2014 and being replaced by Higgins; his final issue was issue 10. \"Batman Eternal\" ran through April 2015, after which it took a hiatus, before returning in October 2015 for a 26-issue weekly sequel series titled \"Batman and Robin Eternal\".\n\nIn October 2013, DC Comics announced the series would launch in early 2014, with Scott Snyder heading the story. Additional writers include James Tynion IV, John Layman, Ray Fawkes, and Tim Seeley, with art at the beginning handled by Jason Fabok. Snyder and Tynion co-wrote the first story arc, which lays the groundwork for the series. The story lines then move to a bigger story that includes Snyder's \"Batman\" title, once it finishes the \"\" story line. The series is part of the 75th anniversary celebration of Batman.\nIn November 2013, Snyder released a teaser image by Fabok, titled \"Happy Batsgiving\", inspired by Jean Leon Gerome Ferris' \"The First Thanksgiving 1621\". The image was intended to be \"full of Easter eggs and teases\" for the series. In December 2013, Seeley stated that Snyder and Tynion created the overarching plot threads of the series to keep each writer progressing, but then further broke the whole story down to different genres for each writer to work in. Fawkes also added that each writer takes turns being the \"lead\" on the issue, while the others continue to contribute their parts to the issue.\n\nIn January 2014, Snyder revealed that each writer is writing arcs to the series, opposed to each writer working together on a single issue. Snyder said, \"it might be more difficult or tricky to do a series where each one of us is doing an arc that leads to the next arc, but we liked that idea. We liked that challenge.\" To aid in this, a large document containing the whole story was created to help map out where large moments needed to occur, and how to aid in connecting each writer's arcs. It was also announced in January that the series would launch in April 2014, and that Layman had left the project. Layman's final issue was issue 10, though he still received \"contributing writer\" credit through issue 21. Later in the month, DC confirmed the addition of Kyle Higgins on the writing team, who wrote The New 52 series \"Nightwing\" up to its penultimate issue in March 2014.\n\nThe series starts with a three-issue arc that features a glimpse at the series' end, as well as establishing the incident that drastically reshapes Gotham. Then, issues 4–7 set up smaller plots branching out from the overarching story, before shifting into three-issue arcs by the various creative teams. On the arcs, Snyder said, \"Each arc reflects the tastes and the real talent of each writer, and yet at the same time it will feel really seamless and singular — like one bombastic game-changing story that rolls forward through these different neighborhoods of writing in an interesting way.\" Seeley called issue 20 the end of \"season one\" of \"Eternal\".\n\nIn July 2014, Snyder revealed the story arc after \"Zero Year\" in \"Batman\", \"\", would take place after the events of \"Eternal\". He revealed that issue 34 would act as a way to catch readers up to the events of \"Eternal\", without spoiling the conclusion, while also setting up the new story arc that will run from \"Batman\" #35-40. Starting in October 2014, along with the \"Endgame\" storyline, most New 52 titles in the \"Batman\" family take place at the end of the \"Eternal\" storyline ending in April 2015. At the end of October, Snyder confirmed the series would go on hiatus after April 2015, and would return for a second year.\n\nIn December 2013, Snyder announced that \"Batman\" #28, originally scheduled to be part of the \"Zero Year\" story, would instead act as a preview issue to \"Batman Eternal\" and the future story line in \"Batman\". The issue was written by Snyder and Tynion, with Dustin Nguyen and Derek Fridolfs providing the artwork. Snyder stated that if \"Batman\" #28 was an issue of \"Eternal\" it would be issue 39.5, which equates to a year's time from the continuity seen at the end of \"Forever Evil\" and the start of \"Eternal\", and was done as a way to tease where \"Eternal\" would lead in 2014. However, the solicitations for issue 43 indicated that that issue would have close ties to \"Batman\" 28. \n\nThe issue introduces a Gotham where the police are no longer allies to Batman and a curfew is being enforced. Harper Row is able to gain access to The Egyptian, the last remaining nightclub in New Gotham, where she reveals to security that her brother is sick in the Narrows at \"ground zero\" and was hoping to meet the new \"kingpin\" of Gotham to get help. When security starts to question her reason for being there, she shuts off the lights, to allow Batman to enter. Learning where to go next from a mysterious girl in the Batcave, Harper begins to help Batman remove the remaining security teams, working under the name Bluebird. Batman and Bluebird learn that the new \"kingpin\" is Selina Kyle, who has quickly taken control of the underworld. They request to get something from her safe that will help the people dying in Gotham. At the safe, it is revealed Selina has Stephanie Brown / The Spoiler tied up and she is the only one who knows how to stop what is coming next.\n\nEach of the writers spoke about the different aspects of Batman and Gotham City they would be exploring in their arcs. With the main plot occurring in Snyder's and Tynion's arcs, each writer was able to incorporate different genres and aspects of the Batman universe into their stories:\n\n\nSnyder stated after the release of \"Batman\" #28, that Harper Row \"is all over this book\" and later said that one of the \"spines\" of the series is the relationship between Batman and Jim Gordon, putting \"them in situations you've never ever seen before where the conflicts and challenges they're up against are different than anything they've experienced on the page.\" On the characters that will appear in the series, Tynion said, \"Gotham is the best toy box in the comics industry, and we're getting to play with all of the toys, even the ones that are sort of in the bottom of the bin that have been forgotten about.\"\n\nTynion later added that Dick Grayson would not appear in his series, due to the Bat Family believing he is dead from the events of \"Forever Evil\" and the character appearing in his new role as a superspy in the series \"Grayson\". However, the effect of the Bat Family thinking Nightwing is dead and not knowing where he is will be explored. At the 2014 Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo, Tynion revealed that the creative team almost included Renee Montoya, who has yet to appear in The New 52, but they decided against it, saying, \"We cut her out because we didn't want her to just be in the background of the GCPD. We want to bring her back for her own big story.\"\n\nAdditional characters that saw their New 52 debut in the series, played a significant role overall or within an individual writer's arc, or were included in the \"Batsgiving\" teaser, include: Batwoman, Jason Bard, Harvey Bullock, Catwoman, Deacon Blackfire, Carmine Falcone, Jack Forbes, Hush, Joker's Daughter, Killer Croc, Penguin, Alfred Pennyworth, Professor Pyg, Road Runner, Maggie Sawyer, and Tiger Shark.\n\nIn the near future, Batman is seen tied to the Bat-Signal while Gotham City burns around him. In the present, Commissioner Gordon is fighting Professor Pyg before being joined by Batman. The two give chase to Pyg, with Gordon cornering one of his henchmen, ordering him to lower his weapon, though the henchman states he does not have one. Gordon fires, but the bullet passes through the henchman and hits a transformer, which causes a massive explosion and two trains to collide. The Gotham City Police Department and Jason Bard, who had just arrived in Gotham, arrive at the scene and Bard arrests Gordon, who is denied bail for his crimes and assigned to Blackgate Prison until his trial. Batman reviews the footage of the accident and learns that the henchman Gordon was chasing worked for Carmine Falcone, who has been talking to Mayor Sebastian Hady about returning Gotham to the time before the rise of Batman. Batman goes to the Iceberg Lounge to see if Penguin knows of Falcone's whereabouts, only to find that Penguin does not know he has returned. Later at the Batcave, Batman attempts to piece together the evidence gathered so far, when he learns of attacks on Penguin's weapons caches by Falcone's men. Learning of the attacks as well, Penguin prepares to go to war with Falcone. Mayor Hady, under the guidance of Falcone, promotes Major Jack Forbes to interim commissioner of the GCPD, who shifts the department's priority to stopping Batman.\n\nAs Batman deals with an explosion at Pyg's lab caused by Doctor Phosphorus, Catwoman visits Penguin at the Iceberg Lounge to learn about disappearances in the Gotham Underground, before Falcone, Tiger Shark and Road Runner begin an attack on the casino. Catwoman is able to save Penguin and patrons of the casino before it sinks to the bottom of Gotham Harbor, while Pyg destroys Road Runner's car dealership, believing he was connected to destroying his lab. After Batman apprehends multiple Falcone thugs throughout the night for the GCPD, Falcone contacts Forbes about putting Batman in his place. Later that night, Batman meets Forbes and Bard at the Bat–Signal, hoping to form an alliance similar to the one he had with Gordon. When Forbes threatens to shoot, Bard orders the SWAT members to fire their smoke grenades, allowing Batman to escape. To learn more about Falcone's past and why he has returned to Gotham, Batman heads to Hong Kong, where is aided by the Batman of Japan. Batman learns from Shen Fang that Falcone bought Fang out to end the gang war in Hong Kong to return to Gotham. Batman returns home with Julia Pennyworth, who was injured while fighting Fang, to the surprise of Alfred. In Gotham, Catwoman is captured by Falcone when she attempts a heist. While Alfred helps nurse Julia back to health at Wayne Manor, Pyg takes Falcone and Catwoman hostage, hoping to turn Falcone into one of his henchmen for blowing up his lab, though Batman is able to stop him and rescue Catwoman.\n\nWith no end to the gang war in sight, Bard approaches Harvey Bullock, Maggie Sawyer, Vicki Vale and Batman with an idea on how to stop it: lead an assault on Falcone's men to capture them, and with the help of Vale, wire tap Forbes to learn more about his involvement with Falcone. Elsewhere, Gordon begins his trial and learns that his son, James Gordon Jr., is alive, who gives him an opportunity to escape his captivity the next night, though Gordon does not take it. Distraught by all that Falcone has done to him, Penguin arrives at Falcone's hideout to finish him, only for both to be arrested by Bard and sent to Blackgate. Once inside Blackgate, along with many of their gang members, one of Falcone's men kills one of Penguin's, igniting a riot and takeover in the prison. Hearing this, Gordon sets out to save the guards and receives help from his cellmate Leo, who turns out to be former crime boss Rex Calabrese. With Bard and Batman working together now, the two witness someone head underground in the Narrows and go to investigate. They are eventually joined by Killer Croc, where they encounter Ten-Eyed Man and a captured victim. Batman, Croc and Bard are able to save the victim and defeat Ten-Eyed Man, as the underground caves in on him.\n\nBatgirl uses the Batcomputer to recreate the train station surveillance, where she notices a man who spent three hours on the tracks, leaving only just before the trains collided. She identifies him as a Brazilian soap opera star with drug cartel connections, and heads to South America to find him. In South America, Batgirl is confronted by Scorpiana. With the aid of Red Hood, who Bruce sends to help Batgirl, Starfire and El Gaucho, she is able to defeat Scorpiana and learns that the man was not actually at the train station, but an impersonator instead. Searching for the actual person, Red Hood and Batgirl are joined by Batwoman, and they eventually end up at a toy factory in Rio de Janeiro. Once inside, they find Dr. Falsario, who uses mind altering technology on Batgirl, who begins to attack Red Hood and Batwoman, seeing them as the Joker and James Jr., respectively. While Batwoman is able to get to Dr. Falsario and learn that he supplied his mind altering technology to have Gordon see a gun, Red Hood tells Batgirl one of his favorite memories of them to spark her eidetic memory, and break the mind control. Dr. Falsario escapes to the rain forest, where Batgirl gives chase, though he is killed by an unknown assassin before she can talk to him.\n\nDuring the gang war, Stephanie Brown returns home to see her father meeting with other villains, narrowly escaping when her dad attempts to kill her for being a possible deterrent to his boss and his associates' rising to power in Gotham. Stephanie calls her mother to tell her what she has learned, only for her mother to reach out to her father after hanging up with her. Stephanie heads to the library, where she begins to post articles alerting the public to her father and his comrades' villainous deeds, and also researches the history of her father and how he became Cluemaster. To draw her out, Cluemaster sends a bomb to one of Stephanie Brown's friend's house, setting it ablaze. She creates the Spoiler costume to go after her father and other bad guys.\n\nRed Robin investigates the infected children who were present during Pyg's fight with Gordon, and learns the infection originated from a single building in the Narrows. Red Robin goes to the Narrows and discovers the infection was caused by nanobots, and accidentally activates them in a child. Elsewhere, Vicki Vale follows a lead on potential gang wars in the Narrows, and, upon confronting them, is saved by Harper Row. The gang members follow Harper and Vale back to Harper's apartment, which is below Red Robin, who falls through the floor fighting the nanobots. The nanobots attack the gang members before Red Robin is able to stop them. However, Harper's brother Cullen, who was also infected, has the nanobots enter his body. In Tokyo, one of Bruce's teachers, Sergei, comments that the nanobots were activated too early, and that Bruce would not be happy. Red Robin heads to Tokyo to find Sergei, only to learn that Harper has stowed away on his plane. The duo find Sergei and Red Robin shows him the nanobot design, which Sergei says resembles a design that was stolen from him. Red Robin also begins to consider training Harper.\n\nBatman sends Batwing to assist Jim Corrigan at Arkham Asylum to investigate a magical disturbance, while Joker's Daughter prepares a summoning ritual below Arkham, using its inmates that have the \"dark dream\". Corrigan and Batwing enter Arkham only to be attacked, with Batwing captured by Joker's Daughter. Batwing is able to escape and meets back up with Corrigan to discover that a resurrected Deacon Blackfire is the cause of the Arkham disturbance, who is able to unleash his attack on Gotham.\n\nBard becomes the new police commissioner, when word is released that Gordon is receiving a life sentence for his murders. Bard arranges Falcone to be released from Blackgate, but Batman meets with him first. He tells Falcone he knew he framed Gordon, as he has since learned from Batgirl, Red Hood and Batwoman, that the knife that killed Dr. Falsario belongs to the crime lords of Hong Kong, only for Falcone to say that Batman has no idea who is actually behind everything. Later, Batman gives Bard evidence that can clear Gordon, and tells Bard he does not trust him. At Wayne Manor Hush injects Alfred with fear toxin, while Bard goes to Blackgate to retrieve Falcone and release Zachary Gate, giving him his Architect costume. Bard contacts Hush telling him he released the Architect and that Batman does not suspect anything, along with destroying the evidence clearing Gordon. Batman heads to the Beacon Tower when he sees the Architect destroying it. Julia Pennyworth enters the Batcave and contacts Batman, telling him about Alfred's condition and assists him in rescuing the hostages held in the Beacon Tower. Batman confronts the Architect, who helps him realize that Hush has been one of the masterminds since the beginning.\n\nHush has been manipulating the city, both overtly, through the gang war between Carmine Falcone and the Penguin and the Architect's attack on Beacon Tower; and covertly, using the Cluemaster to trigger rolling blackouts, infesting the city with rats and strangling the road network with traffic jams. All of this brings tensions to a head so that when Hush has Jason Bard leak a story about an imminent terrorist attack to the \"Gotham Gazette\", rioting breaks out, forcing Bard to introduce a state of martial law.\n\nWith the help of Jade, a girl living on the streets under the protection of Killer Croc, Selina Kyle enters Blackgate Prison to meet with her father, Rex Calabrese. Calabrese suggests that she alone can end the gang war by showing herself to be his daughter, but Selina refuses. When Jade is taken by child services and placed with her only living relatives, a group of Romanian mobsters, Selina makes it her mission to rescue her. The Romanians use Jade to lure her into a trap, capturing her and intending to beat and torture her to death in front of a paying crowd. Selina escapes when Killer Croc arrives, looking for Jade, but is horrified when a bullet aimed at her kills Jade instead. She returns to Calabrese who repeats his suggestion that Selina could end the gang war, and she takes up the cause.\n\nMeanwhile, Hush—as Thomas Elliott—has Alfred moved to Arkham Asylum, which remains under the control of the inmates. Although Deacon Blackfire's plan to open Gotham up to the influence of hell has been thwarted, he still retains corporeal form and is able to overpower Jim Corrigan. Having been separated previously, Batwing reawakens and tries to rescue Corrigan, only to witness the Spectre emerging and stopping Blackfire. However, this causes the caves under Arkham Asylum to collapse, destroying the facility and allowing a mass break-out of the inmates. Alfred is among the survivors and joins with Bane in trying to locate other survivors. Alfred leads him to a satellite Batcave and uses its defence systems to knock him out.\n\nWhile Batman tries to track down the Arkham escapees, Hush has Jason Bard deploy soldiers to specific locations around the city. While on a routine patrol, an explosion destroys a police convoy, killing several police officers. The explosion is revealed to have been a Wayne Enterprises weapons cache, one of seventeen placed around the city to assist Batman Incorporated. Batman joins Julia Pennyworth in rendering each cache safe by activating its failsafe, destroying its contents. He finally confronts Hush in the final cache, and the two fight. Although Batman prevails, Hush directs his attention to a news broadcast in which Lucius Fox announces that in light of the explosion, the federal government has seized upon Wayne Enterprises' assets, effectively rendering Bruce Wayne bankrupt.\n\nWith Hush in custody, order is temporarily restored until Jason Bard tries to capture Batman with seized Wayne Enterprises assets, leading Batman to believe that Hush was simply another pawn in a wider scheme. He starts searching for the mastermind, first tracking down the Riddler and later Ra's al Ghul—the only people he believes who have the ability carry out such a sophisticated plan—only for both of them to convince him of their innocence, arguing that they could easily destroy a weakened Batman, but that they must vanquish him at the height of his powers in order to prove their power over him.\n\nMeanwhile, Red Robin enlists Harper Row's aid in locating the source of the nanomachine infestation sweeping the city. They identify Jervis Tetch as the source, and Harper—adopting the name \"Bluebird\"—is forced into the field when Red Robin, Batgirl and Red Hood are all overwhelmed by the nanomachines. Harper tricks Tetch into giving up the device that controls the nanomachines, shutting down the infestation. They realise that a variant of Tetch's mind-control technology was used to manipulate Jim Gordon into firing the shots that triggered the subway accident.\n\nFollowing the collapse of Arkham Asylum, several high-value inmates remain at large. After regrouping and arguing over their leadership, they find an anonymous backer has supplied them with unlimited resources, enabling them to unleash havoc on the city at will. Selina Kyle is made the same offer, but turns it down and instead focuses on finding Stephanie Brown, who is still on the run from assassins. Selina locates her quickly and turns her over to Batman. Stephanie refuses to talk, believing that Bruce Wayne is responsible for backing the criminal activity that has taken hold in Gotham. As each of Batman's allies heads off to thwart the individual criminals, the Penguin starts a riot at Blackgate Penitentiary to try and kill James Gordon. Gordon is saved by Harvey Bullock and Jason Bard, who has had a change of heart. They escape the prison to find Gotham of fire following an attack by Firefly.\n\nBatman initially prepares to engage Firefly, but realises that it is a distraction. He moves to Beacon Tower where he is confronted by the real mastermind of the plan: Arthur Brown, also known as the Cluemaster, a costumed villain largely regarded as a third-rate criminal. Brown reveals that his entire plan hinged on Batman believing his own legend—that if his enemies appeared to not only be co-ordinated, but orchestrated, then he would always look for the bigger threat behind it all and never consider a small-time criminal like Brown as the mastermind. Brown prepares to kill Batman, but is himself killed by his silent partner, Lincoln March; also known as the Talon. On the Night of the Owls, Brown approached the Court of Owls with his plan to ruin Batman, only to find that they have been slaughtered by March, who agrees to support his plan.\n\nAs March and a physically and mentally exhausted Batman begin to fight, Jim Gordon rallies the people of Gotham to rise up and support him. The entire Batman family converges on Beacon Tower to apprehend March before he can kill Batman, but he escapes through the sewers. In the aftermath, Jason Bard resigns as commissioner with his career in ruins, while Stephanie Brown moves in with Harper Row and her brother Cullen. Red Robin questions March's whereabouts, and it is revealed that although he killed the Court of Owls' leadership, the membership continued on, catching him and putting him into an induced hypothermic coma indefinitely. In the epilogue, Batman meets with Jim Gordon, who reveals that Scarecrow has launched another attack on the city. Batman asks if he is ready for one more fight; Gordon replies that he is willing to find out.\n\n, review aggregate website Comic Book Roundup reported a 7.3/10 rating for the series, based on individual reviews for each issue. In February 2014, \"Batman Eternal\", along with DC's second weekly title launching in 2014, \"\", were featured on IGN's \"Most Anticipated Comics of 2014\".\n\nThe first issue received positive reviews. Comic Book Resources' Jim Johnson gave the issue 4.5 stars out of 5, saying the issue \"is a tremendous start, not just for a weekly series, but for any comic series.\" Michael Moccio of Newsarama added, \"From beginning to end of this issue, you won’t want to stop turning the pages and, at the final page, you’ll be on the edge of your seat anticipating the next issue\", giving it an 8 out of 10. Despite some \"clunky dialogue\" at the start of \"Batman Eternal\" #1, Mike Logsdon of IGN gave the issue an 8.6 out of 10, due to its \"cinematically-scaled layouts, strong themes, an interesting use of a new character, and an intriguing new mystery.\"\n\nJohn Layman's first issue in the series, \"Batman Eternal\" #4, was met with generally positive reviews. Logsdon gave the issue a 9.0 out of 10, saying, beyond a few art distractions, it was \"the strongest issue of this series so far.\" Newsarama's Pierce Lydon added that, despite \"another solid installation in this weekly series... the plot is starting to spin its wheels. We are less than 10% through this series, but we’re not seeing enough effective payoff yet. The World’s Greatest Detective is really taking his time doing any detecting\", giving the issue a 6 out of 10. Jennifer Cheng of Comic Book Resources said the issue felt \"like a well put-together TV show, and not just in its faster week-to-week pacing. There are many interlocking parts to the plot, and each part holds its own,\" awarding the issue 3.5 stars out of 5.\n\nIssue 5, James Tynion IV's first issue, continued the generally positive trend, receiving 4 stars out of 5 from Comic Book Resources's Greg McElhatton. He said, \"A weekly series needs to have three to four times as much plot as a monthly book, in order to keep from feeling padded. With this issue, we're starting to enter the outskirts of \"epic\" levels of plot, and that's a relief. Tynion takes on the scripting for this issue and it flows well, introducing the new elements without feeling like we've been left hanging for what's come before.\" Logsdon gave the issue a 7.8 out of 10, saying \"It seems that this weekly series might be presenting us with a series of one-shots that tie into the larger story. If this really is the start of a trend, so far it has been quite successful. James Tynion IV takes on scripting duties and he does a good job of capturing Tim Drake's new personality.\" Lydon, however, said, \"I’m always partial stories that take into account more than just the police and capes side of a story and Tynion taps Vicki Vale for a starring role as well. But we’re still just moving pawns in this game of chess, and the strategy has been yet to be fully realized,\" giving the issue a 5 out of 10.\n\n\"Batman Eternal\" #6, the first for Ray Fawkes, had more mixed reviews. IGN's Jeff Lake said the series \"is starting to feel a bit like \"Game of Thrones\". Each week offers a snapshot view of a few characters, only to switch to a different set the following week. Issue #6 is a Batwing issue, and while it's fun to see him working alongside Jim Corrigan (and facing the always awesome Gentleman Ghost), it's hard to see how it fits into the main story,\" awarding the issue a 7.8 out of 10. Lydon expressed similar sentiments, giving the issue a 6 out of 10 and adding, \"We’re still firmly in building mode but we’re starting to lose sight of the inciting incident. Gordon’s mishap and the return of the Roman feel like they happened so long ago because we’ve seen an attempt to weave so many other storylines in.\"\n\nLogsdon gave issue 7, Tim Seeley's first, an 8.0 out of 10, feeling Seeley gave each of the characters he dealt with the proper spotlight. Marykate Jasper of Comic Book Resources gave the issue 4 stars out of 5, saying the issue was \"an explosion-packed, game-changing issue that keeps up the pace of its predecessors and continues to expand the scope of the story.\" Lydon also spoke positively, giving the issue an 8 out of 10, and saying, \"The chains are really starting to move in \"Eternal\"... [and the series] is changing the landscape of Gotham quite literally, and it’s exciting to watch.\"\n\nIssue 22, Kyle Higgins' first issue, received a 5 out of 10 from Lydon. He said, \"Kyle Higgins’ scripting serves really only to get us to the ending and have the Architect reveal his motivations a bit... This chapter almost feels extraneous, but it’s not the worst this title has been.\" McElhatton gave the issue 2.5 stars out of 5, saying, \"The problem with \"Batman Eternal\" #22 is that this recent shift, bringing the Architect and Hush back into continuity, hasn't had time to settle in with everything else around it. Dealing with the crime war or the strangeness under Arkham Asylum, bringing the characters in feels out of place, almost like an entirely different comic. While the connection is there, it's still such a thin line that for the moment it's hard to adjust to a proverbial jumping of the tracks into something else. The tone is different, the characters we've been reading about are suddenly all absent, and this just doesn't quite work.\"\n\nComic Book Resources' Doug Zawisza gave \"Batman\" #28 4.5 stars out of 5, saying he was \"onboard and locked in to see how Snyder and crew weave the not-so-distant past with the near future... [and the] issue is a nice break from \"Zero Year,\" a change of pace, a switch in visual impact, a breath of fresh air and a sign of hope for the Gotham of tomorrow as Snyder continues to construct and deepen the legend of Gotham City and its role in the mythology of Batman.\" David Pepose of Newsarama gave the issue an 8 out 10. He said, \"With this preview to the upcoming Bat-event \"Batman Eternal\", the creative team adds just enough to Gotham's mythology to hold your interest.\" IGN's Melissa Grey gave the issue an 8 out of 10 as well, calling it \"a fun issue,\" but one that \"doesn't comfortably ground the reader in its timeline.\"\n\nFor April 2014, Diamond Comic Distributors announced that \"Batman Eternal\" issues 1–4 were the fourth, sixth, ninth and 10th best selling titles of the month, respectively. \"Batman Eternal\" #5–8 ranked 10th, 11th, 17th and 15th, respectively for May 2014. In June 2014, \"Batman Eternal\" #9-12 ranked 14th through 17th, respectively. For July 2014, \"Eternal\" #13-17 ranked 17th, 18th, 22nd, 23rd and 25th, respectively. \"Eternal\" #18 in August 2014 ranked 10th, while issues 19-21 ranked 14th-16th, respectively. In September 2014, \"Batman Eternal\" #22-25 ranked 31st, 34th, 35th and 37th, respectively. In October 2014, issues #26-30 ranked 29th, 32nd, 39th and 38th, respectively. The final issue, #52, reached the rank of 39th.\n\nIn June 2014, DC announced a new title within the \"Batman\" family of New 52 titles, \"Arkham Manor\", written by Gerry Duggan, with art by Shawn Crystal for release in October 2014. In August, they also announced \"Gotham By Midnight\" for release in November 2014, written by Ray Fawkes and art by Ben Templesmith. Both spin out of the events of \"Eternal\", with \"Arkham Manor\" focusing on Wayne Manor becoming the new Arkham Asylum, and \"Gotham By Midnight\" exploring Corrigan and \"The Midnight Shift\" of the Gotham Police Department that handle supernatural occurrences. \"Arkham Manor\" takes place after the events of \"Eternal\" #30, with \"Gotham By Midnight\" occurring at the end of the \"Eternal\" storyline ending in March 2015.\n\nAt the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con International, DC announced a follow up series, \"Batman and Robin Eternal\". It will feature Tynion as the lead writer, along with Snyder, Seeley, Geneveive Valentine, Steve Orlando, Jackson Lanzing, Collin Kelly and Ed BrissonIt, with art from Tony Daniel, Paul Pelletier and Scot Eaton. \"Batman and Robin Eternal\" will begin in October 2015 until April 2016, running weekly for 26 issues, and is intended to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the Robin character, just as \"Batman Eternal\" celebrated the 75th anniversary of the Batman character. Tynion stated, \"Part of it will be Dick Grayson as Robin in the past alongside Batman. This is Dick's first international mysteries, he thought it was the most harrowing case of his life but he didn't know who he was up against. He's going to stumble into a mystery that shakes the foundation of the concept of Robin. This is the series where we will bring back Cassandra Cain to the DC Universe. She's been one of my favorite characters, I came up in the era when she was front and center. Bringing her into continuity in this story in particular -- the three leads in this story are Dick Grayson and Harper Row and Cassandra Cain. It's going to take us all over the world and bring in all of the Robins. The whole Bat family.\"\n\nMonthly Creative Team Solicitations\n"}
{"id": "43603241", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43603241", "title": "Captain Marvel (film)", "text": "Captain Marvel (film)\n\nCaptain Marvel is an upcoming American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is intended to be the twenty-first film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film is written and directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, with Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Jac Schaeffer also contributing to the screenplay. Brie Larson stars in the title role, alongside Samuel L. Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn, Djimon Hounsou, Lee Pace, Lashana Lynch, Gemma Chan, Annette Bening, Clark Gregg, and Jude Law. Set in 1995, the story follows Danvers as Earth is caught in the center of an intergalactic conflict between two alien worlds.\n\nDevelopment of the film began as early as May 2013, and was officially announced in October 2014, making it Marvel Studios' first female-led superhero film. Nicole Perlman and Meg LeFauve were hired as a writing team the following April after submitting separate takes on the character. The story borrows elements from Roy Thomas' 1971 \"Kree–Skrull War\" comic book storyline. Larson was announced as Danvers at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con International. Boden and Fleck were brought on board to direct in April 2017, and Robertson-Dworet soon took over scripting duties, with the remainder of the cast added by the start of filming. Location shooting began in January 2018, with principal photography beginning that March in California before concluding in July 2018 in Louisiana. Jackson and Gregg, both reprising their roles from previous MCU films, were digitally de-aged in post-production.\n\n\"Captain Marvel\" is scheduled to be released in the United States on March 8, 2019, in IMAX and 3D.\n\nSet in 1995, \"Captain Marvel\" follows Carol Danvers, a former U.S. Air Force fighter pilot, as she turns into one of the galaxy's mightiest heroes and joins Starforce, an elite Kree military team, before returning home with new questions about her past and identity when the Earth is caught in the center of an intergalactic conflict between two alien worlds.\n\nAdditionally, Algenis Pérez Soto and Rune Temte portray Att-Lass and Bron-Char, respectively, both members of Starforce. Robert Kazinsky, Vik Sahay, Colin Ford, Chuku Modu, and Kenneth Mitchell have been cast in undisclosed roles. Stan Lee, co-creator of the first Captain Marvel, has a posthumous cameo appearance in the film.\n\nBy May 2013, a script for \"Ms. Marvel\", the moniker Carol Danvers used in the comics before she took the mantle Captain Marvel, had been written for Marvel Studios through the studio's writing program. Producer Louis D'Esposito stated later that year that the studio was interested in a female-driven superhero film, saying that they have plenty of \"strong female characters\" from which to choose and suggested Captain Marvel, Black Widow, Pepper Potts, or Peggy Carter as possible candidates. Kevin Feige, President of Production at Marvel Studios, said that if Marvel was to make a female-led film, he would prefer it to be a new character to the Marvel Cinematic Universe like Captain Marvel, who could receive an origin story. In August 2014, Feige stated that Black Panther and Captain Marvel were \"both characters that we like, that development work has been done on and is continuing to be done on\" and that the studio is often asked about it by the public, \"more than \"Iron Man 4\", more than \"\" ... I think that's something that we have to pay attention to.\"\n\nIn October 2014, Feige announced that \"Captain Marvel\" would be released on July 6, 2018, as part of the studio's Phase Three slate of films, making it Marvel's first female-led film. He said the film would be based on the Carol Danvers version of the character and that the film \"has been in the works almost as long as \"Doctor Strange\" or \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" before it came out, and one of the key things was figuring out what we wanted to do with it. Her adventures are very earthbound, but her powers are based in the cosmic realm.\" Feige added that a writer and director would be announced \"quite soon\", and female filmmakers were being considered, though he could not promise that Marvel would \"hire from any one demographic\".\n\nIn February 2015, Marvel pushed back the release date to November 2, 2018. In early April, Feige revealed that Captain Marvel appeared in an early draft of the \"\" screenplay, but was removed as \"it didn't feel like the time. We didn't want to introduce her fully formed flying in a costume before you knew who she was or how she came to be.\" He also said that Marvel would be ready to announce writers for the film \"hopefully in the next week or two\", and by mid-April, \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" co-screenwriter Nicole Perlman and \"Inside Out\" co-screenwriter Meg LeFauve were announced to be writing the screenplay. The duo were put together as a writing team after impressing Feige with separate takes on the character, and began work on the film within a month. LeFauve found the character being a female superhero to be both \"wonderful\" and a challenge, particularly because of how powerful the character is which could lead to the \"Superman curse. 'What's her vulnerability?' is what we have to figure out.\"\n\nBy May, Marvel had discussions with Ava DuVernay about directing \"Captain Marvel\" or \"Black Panther\", which Feige confirmed a month later, saying that he had met with DuVernay amongst a number of other directors and expected a decision to be made by mid- to late 2015. That September, Feige said that the casting process would not begin until 2016, as \"we're scripting the film, figuring out who we want Carol Danvers to be, and really what the structure of the movie will be and what her part will be in some of our other Phase 3 films.\" Producer Jeremy Latcham elaborated that \"getting the character right first is going to lead the charge. We want to make sure we know who it is before we can start figuring out who should play it.\" In October 2015, Marvel changed the release date once again, moving it back to March 8, 2019.\nFeige stated in April 2016 that a director would be announced \"in the next month or two\" and that the first cast members would be announced in mid-2016. He also mentioned that the film would be about Carol Danvers' journey to become Captain Marvel. The next month, indie filmmaker Emily Carmichael's name surfaced as a possible contender to direct the film, and by June, Brie Larson emerged as the frontrunner to play Captain Marvel. Larson was confirmed for the role at San Diego Comic-Con International 2016, for which she will earn $5 million. Larson was initially hesitant to accept the role, but \"couldn't deny the fact that this movie is everything I care about, everything that's progressive and important and meaningful, and a symbol I wished I would've had growing up.\" She was able to bring \"some of those [deep emotional] things\" she had used in more \"dramatic roles\" for the part, which she felt helped set \"Captain Marvel\" apart from other superhero films. Also at Comic-Con, Feige said the search for a director had been narrowed down to \"a short list of 10\", and was hoping to be able to announce the choice \"by the end of the summer\".\n\nPerlman revealed in August that the character's origin story had been changed for the film due to similarities with Green Lantern's, with Feige expanding by saying, \"I think we have a very cool and unique way of telling\" her story, centered on Danvers finding her limitations and vulnerabilities; he added that the character would be \"by far the most powerful character\" in the MCU films, and would be a \"very important character in our universe\". Producer Nate Moore later explained that they sought to break away from the traditional structure of many MCU origin stories, \"which is you meet the character, they have a problem, they get powers at the end of the first act, and the end of the second act they learn about the powers, the third act they probably fight a villain who has a function of the same powers,\" in order to give audiences a new experience; Danvers starts the films with her powers already.\n\nIn October 2016, Feige admitted that the announcement for a director was taking longer than he previously expected, and explained that the studio was now waiting for \"a little more of the story [to be] set\" so they could talk to potential directors about it. Once again talking about hiring a female filmmaker to direct the film, Feige said that he did not think it would be a requirement \"to make a great version of \"Captain Marvel\", but it's something we think is important,\" even if that female filmmaker does not know a lot about the comics, as \"they just have to fall in love with it once they are presented with it. It's amazing to see all of the filmmakers read through [the source material] and know, 'Oh, a female's writing it now'\", speaking in particular to Kelly Sue DeConnick's run in the comics. Feige expected a director to be announced by the end of 2016; however, Perlman and LeFauve turned in a script treatment around December, pushing additional meetings with director candidates into early 2017.\n\nIn February 2017, Perlman stated that despite her and LeFauve being hired almost a year previously, the duo had only recently gotten their \"marching orders\" for the script, stating one of the reasons for the delay was figuring out where the film would fit within the MCU. Perlman also discussed the character's femininity, feeling that it was important to make sure she is not \"somebody who is a hero in spite of her femininity ... being a woman is part of [her] strength.\" The writers were also considerate of tropes that could be diminishing to a female character but not for male characters, \"things you wouldn't think twice about for Iron Man but you would think twice about for Captain Marvel.\"\n\nMarvel hired Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck to direct \"Captain Marvel\" in April 2017, after the duo impressed Marvel \"time and time again\" over numerous meetings with their vision for the character, and because of their experience working in both television and film. Feige noted that he and Marvel were impressed with Boden and Fleck's ability to create character-driven stories in all of their works. He added, \"The stories they've told have been so diverse, but regardless of the subject matter, they can dive into it and hone in on that character's journey.\" Ultimately, Feige felt the film \"needs to be about the three-dimensional, multilayered Carol Danvers character. You have to be able to track her and follow her and relate to her at all points of the movie, regardless of how many visual effects and spaceships and bad guys are filling the frame.\" Filming was scheduled to begin in January 2018, at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, but Feige was expecting it to not begin until February 2018.\n\nBy July 2017, Samuel L. Jackson was set to appear in the film, reprising his role as Nick Fury. At the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con, Feige revealed that the film would take place in the 1990s and the Skrulls would act as the film's villains, allowing elements from the \"Kree–Skrull War\" storyline to appear. By setting the film in the 1990s, Feige noted it would allow Danvers to \"be the singular hero, but place it within timing of the MCU.\" In response to this announcement, Graeme McMillan of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" compared the film to \"\" and the DC Extended Universe film \"Wonder Woman\", as they were also set decades before present day. By setting the film in the 1990s, McMillan felt it would create the question of \"what happened to Captain Marvel to take her off the playing field ahead of the Marvel movies that we've seen to date?\", and noted Danvers' story might echo the \"Captain America narrative\", where \"a hero from the past... disappears from the world before re-emerging\". Also in July, the California Film Commission awarded a $20.7million tax credit to the production, going towards the first $100million spent on qualified in-state expenditures, making California the main filming location for \"Captain Marvel\". D'Esposito called this \"very exciting\" given Marvel Studios' headquarters and post-production facilities are also in the state, allowing them to streamline the production process for this film and others. Awarding of the tax credit was dependent on filming beginning within 180 days. Marvel planned to spend $118.6 million filming in the state, for a net of $97.8 million after the tax credit was applied.\n\nGeneva Robertson-Dworet was hired by Marvel by mid-August to take over the scripting duties for \"Captain Marvel\" after LeFauve left the project to co-direct \"Gigantic\" for Disney Animation. Perlman confirmed her departure from the project as well, and said that the story she and LeFauve worked on in earlier drafts would be retained in the final screenplay. Robertson-Dworet described the film as an action-comedy, and likened her script to an initial one she wrote for \"Tomb Raider\" (2018) before that film took a more dramatic tone. She added that it was important to the entire creative team to keep the comedic elements of the film and the \"very funny voice\" of the character, since Danvers \"is one of the funniest comic book characters. She's so sassy, she's such a smartass, she won’t take shit from anyone\". Robertson-Dworet also credited Boden for helping to shape Danvers' voice in the film and the desire \"to carve our own path and make sure we weren’t retreading the same territory [after the release of \"Wonder Woman\"], and showing all facets of what women are capable of.\" Feige added that \"Captain Marvel\" would have \"homages to our favorite '90s action films\", such as the action from \"Terminator 2\", \"cool street level fights, street level car chases, and fun stuff like that\", since the 1990s action genre was one Marvel Studios had yet to explore. He also stated much of the film would take place in outer space. Quantum physicist Spyridon Michalakis from the Institute for Quantum Information and Matter at the California Institute of Technology consulted on the film.\n\nBy October, filming was slated to begin in March 2018. Feige described the film then as \"a big part of heading towards\" the then untitled Avengers film, set for release after \"Captain Marvel\", and concluding the story being told across the first three phases of the MCU. Ben Mendelsohn entered negotiations to join the film as the main villain, having previously worked with Boden and Fleck on their film \"Mississippi Grind\". They had him in mind for the \"Captain Marvel\" villain when they first began working on this film's story, and once they had met with him about the role, Mendelsohn \"quickly agreed to pursue\" it. By November, Jude Law was in negotiations for the role of Walter Lawson / Mar-Vell in the film. In January 2018, DeWanda Wise was cast as Maria Rambeau, and Mendelsohn and Law were confirmed to have been cast. Feige stated that Law was an actor Marvel had \"admired for a long time and have wanted to find a role for in our movies\", feeling his part in \"Captain Marvel\" was \"extraordinary\". For Law, he felt Marvel was \"an interesting party to join in with at an interesting time in their ascendancy. That to me is an interesting playground to work in,\" noting Marvel's \"effort [in recent years] to hire independent directors with distinct voices\".\n\nLocation shooting occurred at the end of January 2018. Set photos taken at that time showed Larson in a green and black uniform instead of the character's familiar red and blue suit. Feige responded by saying that Marvel accepts the risk of set photos being leaked as a consequence of location shooting, and felt that \"most people are savvy enough to know they're looking at a behind-the-scenes photo, completely out of context.\" He added that a large amount of scenes in the film would be shot on location.\n\nA month later, Gemma Chan joined the cast as Minn-Erva. In mid-March, Wise withdrew from the film due to a scheduling conflict with her television series \"She's Gotta Have It\". The following day, Lashana Lynch entered into negotiations to replace Wise. By the end of the month, Lynch was confirmed while Djimon Hounsou, Lee Pace, and Clark Gregg were set to reprise their roles as Korath, Ronan the Accuser, and Phil Coulson, respectively, from earlier MCU films. Algenis Perez Soto, Rune Temte, and Mckenna Grace were also set to star. At the same time, Marvel credited Boden and Fleck and the writing team of Liz Flahive and Carly Mensch with writing the screenplay along with LeFauve, Perlman and Robertson-Dworet. Additionally, Bek Smith worked on production rewrites for the film, after spending a year in Marvel's writers program. With the inclusion of Korath, Ronan, and Coulson (characters established and killed in earlier films), Richard Newby of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" felt the film \"provide[d] the MCU with another unique opportunity to strengthen the presence of some characters who may not have lived up to their potential and to give great actors, particularly those who portrayed ill-fated villains, a chance to bring more to their roles than their initial opportunities allowed... \"Captain Marvel\" allows these characters to become more prominent, and while their fates are sealed for now, their pasts and the stories that reside there can entirely change our perception of them.\"\n\nPrincipal photography began on March 19 in Los Angeles, under the working title \"Warbird\", with Ben Davis serving as director of photography, marking his fourth time working as a cinematographer in the MCU following \"Guardians of the Galaxy\", \"\", and \"Doctor Strange\". A carnival scene, set in 1986 and featuring Danvers and Fury, was filmed later that week at the Jim Hall Racing Club in Oxnard, California. Filming of \"Captain Marvel\" in Los Angeles, along with other big-budget films that took advantage of California's improved tax credit program, helped raise on-location feature film production in the area by 11.7% in the first quarter of 2018, compared to the same period in 2017; it was the first two-figure increase in production since the fourth quarter of 2015. Filming at Shaver Lake outside Fresno, California was set to take place in April under the working title \"Open World\", but was pushed back to mid-May. In late April, Feige stated that filming was a little less than halfway completed. The following month, Annette Bening joined the cast in an undisclosed role. In late June, principal photography moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana and New Orleans for two weeks, also using the working title \"Open World\", before concluding on July 6.\n\nAdditional photography was confirmed to have begun in late November 2018 via set photos. With the release of the theatrical poster in early December 2018, Marvel provided updated writing credits for the film, crediting Perlman and the writing team of Joe Shrapnel and Anna Waterhouse for the story, and Boden, Fleck, Robertson-Dworet, and Jac Schaeffer for the screenplay. Visual effects were created by Lola VFX, with the company working on the de-aging of Jackson and Gregg.\n\nIn May 2018, Clark Gregg indicated the film's soundtrack would include songs from the 1990s. Pinar Toprak signed on to compose the film's score by the following month, making her the first woman to score an MCU film.\n\nConcept art from the film was shown at the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con. In June 2018, Feige revealed a look at Larson as Danvers at CineEurope. Larson debuted the first trailer in September 2018 at the National Air and Space Museum on \"Good Morning America\". Petrana Radulovic of \"Polygon\" felt the trailer showed \"large-scale action and intergalactic mayhem that reaches for \"\"s heights.\" Ben Kuchera, also of \"Polygon\", felt opening the trailer with Blockbuster Video was \"fitting\" and an \"anchoring shot\" since its logo \"remains instantly identifiable to a large audience\", and pointed out that the scenes of Danvers as an Airforce pilot \"appear to nod at the famously sun-drenched \"Top Gun\"\" that calls back \"to the golden era of films about fighter pilots.\" Devan Coogan of \"Entertainment Weekly\" called the trailer \"a powerful introduction to the MCU’s first solo female hero.\" Graeme McMillian of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" noted that Nick Fury's narration dominates the first half of the trailer which \"grounds the trailer in something — some — familiar for the Marvel faithful, and lays the groundwork for Carol Danvers’ first words.\" He also noted that the film's apparent departure from its' comic book origins removes \"the self-determination and agency of Carol Danvers\", which was \"a risky proposition\" to long-time fans of the character. Richard Newby, also of \"The Hollywood Reporter\", felt the trailer \"waste[d] no time in not only establishing Captain Marvel’s tremendous power set, but also distinguishing her from the heroes that have come before.\" Newby also noted, that since Captain Marvel's powers are not as recognizable for the general audience, Marvel does not use their \"unfamiliarity to present the character as a joke\" as they did with \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" and \"Ant-Man\", but \"[r]ather it makes a statement that Captain Marvel means business, and if you don’t know her, well buckle up because she’s about to change the universe.\" Newby commended cinematographer Ben Davis from the trailer for making the film's identity \"distinct\" from the other MCU films he worked on, noting \"Captain Marvel\" seemed \"more grounded\" than Davis' work on \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" or \"Doctor Strange\" and appeared to be inspired by the films of Tony Scott, Roland Emmerich, and Richard Donner. The trailer was viewed 109 million times in its first 24 hours, becoming the 11th most viewed trailer in that time period.\n\n\"Captain Marvel\" is scheduled to be released in the United States on March 8, 2019, in IMAX and 3D. It was originally scheduled for release on July 6, 2018, before moving in February 2015 to November 2, 2018, to accommodate \"\". In October 2015, it moved again to accommodate \"Ant-Man and the Wasp\".\n\n\"Captain Marvel\" will be the first Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures-distributed film not to stream on Netflix, after Disney decided to let their licensing deal with Netflix expire, and is intended to be the first theatrical Disney release to stream exclusively on Disney+.\n\n"}

{"id": "34884755", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34884755", "title": "Collage film", "text": "Collage film\n\nCollage film is a style of film created by juxtaposing found footage from disparate sources. The term has also been applied to the physical collaging of materials onto film stock.\n\nThe surrealist movement played a critical role in the creation of the collage film form. In 1936, the American artist Joseph Cornell produced one of the earliest collage films with his reassembly of \"East of Borneo\" (1931), combined with pieces of other films, into a new work he titled \"Rose Hobart\" after the leading actress. When Salvador Dalí saw the film, he was famously enraged, believing Cornell had stolen the idea from his thoughts. But Adrian Brunel made, twelve years before, \"Crossing the Great Sagrada\" (1924) and Henri Storck conceived, four years earlier, \"Story of the Unknown soldier\" (\"Histoire du soldat inconnu\") (1932.)\n\nThe idea of combining film from various sources also appealed to another surrealist artist André Breton. In the town of Nantes, he and friend Jacques Vaché would travel from one movie theater to another, without ever staying for an entire film.\n\nA renaissance of found footage films emerged after Bruce Conner's \"A Movie\" (1958). The film mixes ephemeral film clips in a dialectical montage. A famous sequence made up of disparate clips shows \"a submarine captain [who] seems to see a scantily dressed woman through his periscope and responds by firing a torpedo which produces a nuclear explosion followed by huge waves ridden by surfboard riders.\" Conner continued to produce several other found footage films including \"Report\" and \"Crossroads\" among others.\n\nWorking at the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) in the 1960s, Arthur Lipsett created collage films such as \"Very Nice, Very Nice\" (1961) and \"21-87\" (1963), entirely composed of found footage discarded during the editing of other films (the former earning an Academy Award nomination).\n\nIn 1968, the young Joe Dante made \"The Movie Orgy\" with producer Jon Davidson that featured outtakes, trailers and commercials from various shows and films.\n\nOther notable users of this technique are Chuck Workman with his Oscar-winning \"Precious Images\" , Craig Baldwin in his films \"Spectors of the Spectrum\", \"Tribulation 99\" and \"O No Coronado\" and Bill Morrisson who used found footage lost and neglected in film archives in his 2002 work \"Decasia\" (which alongside Kevin Rafferty's 1982 Cold War satire \"The Atomic Cafe\" were inducted to the National Film Registry). A similar entry in the found footage canon is Peter Delpeut's \"Lyrical Nitrate\" (1991).\n\nThe technique was employed in the 2008 feature film \"The Memories of Angels\", a visual ode to Montreal composed of stock footage from over 120 NFB films from the 1950s and 1960s. Terence Davies used a similar technique to create \"Of Time and the City\", recalling his life growing up in Liverpool in the 1950s and 1960s, using newsreel and documentary footage supplemented by his own commentary voiceover and contemporaneous and classical music soundtracks.\n\nThe 2016 experimental documentary \"Fraud\" was sourced from over a hundred hours of home video footage uploaded to YouTube by an unknown family in the United States. The footage was collaged with additional clips appropriated from other YouTube users and transformed into a 53-minute crime film about a family preoccupied with material consumption going to extreme lengths in order to get out from under unsustainable personal debt.\n\n\nSome of the earliest surrealist collage works were humorous. This tradition of using film collage for comedic effect can later be seen in commercial films such as Woody Allen's first film, \"What's Up, Tiger Lily?\" in which Allen took a Japanese spy film by Senkichi Taniguchi, re-edited parts of it and wrote a new soundtrack made up of his own dialogue for comic effect, and Carl Reiner's 1982 comedy \"Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid\" which incorporated footage from approximately two dozen classic film noir films along with original sequences with Steve Martin.\n\nSome filmmakers have taken a more literal approach to collage film. Stan Brakhage created films by collaging found objects between clear film stock, then passing the results through an optical printer, such as in \"Mothlight\" and \"The Garden of Earthly Delights\".\n\nExamples of animated collage film (which uses clippings from newspapers, comics and magazines alongside other inanimate objects):\n"}

{"id": "48403782", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48403782", "title": "Cultureme", "text": "Cultureme\n\nA cultureme is any portion of cultural behavior apprehended in signs of symbolic value that can be broken down into smaller units or amalgamated into larger ones. A cultureme is a \"cultural information-bearing unit\", the contents of which are recognizable by a group of people. Culturemes are the bridge between linguistic units and culture.\n\nTheir usage can be seen in cultural expressions, phraseologisms, jokes, slogans, literature, religion, folklore, sociology, anthropology, etc. All of which are subcultures in a culture system. Culturemes of this nature have historical relevance that when translated or explained result in a miscommunication and misunderstanding. \n\nThe notion of cultureme is being increasingly used in translation studies and other disciplines. It is a recently used concept that is yet to be defined and distinguished from others, such as phraseme, idiom, symbol, cultural word, etc.\n\nFernando Poyatos breaks down the features of a cultureme into four phases. These phases analysis the broadest of culturemes to the most particular aspects of culturemes.\n\nBasic culturemes are the broadest of culturemes. They characterize the initial semblance of a culture. Basic culturemes are separated into two cultural \"realms,\" urban and rural, and two domains: exterior and interior. Basic culturemes begin with urban and rural realms because of their dichotomy in cultural identity and displays of social interactions. Within either cultures, there are exteriors (what is observed from the outside) and interiors (what is observed from the inside of buildings or establishments that are not seen from an outdoors perspective). The main divisions of culturemes are: urban-exterior, urban-interior, rural-exterior, and rural-interior.\n\nThe significance of basic culturemes is to give a general sense of surroundings. For instance,\n\n\"in \"North America\" (United States and Canada): the larger size of many automobiles, the summery sound and smell of lawn mowing, the smell of city bus exhausts, the basic separation of the 'downtown' business and residential areas in the small town or village, the sirens of their police cars, the smell of hamburger and French fries of many eating establishments, the unique drugstore smell, the 'Licensed' signs in many second-rate restaurants (indicating a cultural attitude towards drinking\"\n\nPrimary culturemes exist in the phase when acculturation occurs, in which one's culture is becoming more complex. The basic four culturemes are subcategorized into environmental (cultural settings) and behavioral (behaviors of people and their interactions). These culturemes are a result of recognizing cultural patterns and \"experiencing it through mere observation or systemic learning.\" \n\nCulturemes are further broken down into settings, in which a specific culture is exemplified. These includes cultures in the school, the park, the bar, etc. These are secondary culturemes. Phase three is the point where the cultures identified in phase two begin to interact; interrelationships are seen among different cultural systems and values.\n\nPhase four delves deeper into human senses, analyzing to the fullest extent possible. The completion of phase four allows one to identify the cultureme's cultural system and subculture. Knowing the cultural system and subculture are important as it helps to navigate through other identifiable systems within the culture.\n\nTranslating a cultureme can be challenging, as connotations are sometimes very strong. For instance: the Spanish word \"alcázar\" means \"the castle\", \"palace\" or \"fortress\", but, as it is of Arabic origin, it recalls eight centuries of history (Al Andalus), which cannot be easily translated into English, so the translator must adopt a crucial decision: either choose the English word \"fortress\" and lose all the historical and cultural connotations, or use the loan word alcazar.\n\nA language may have various cultures and various languages may share the same culture. Cultures may differ in conceptualization that may in turn affect how thoughts are conveyed in their languages. The asymmetry of language complicates the matter of providing a linguistically and culturally sound equivalent of a cultureme in another language. The complex relationship of language and culture is significant in giving culturemes their intended value. Dictionaries further complicate cross-cultural gaps of meaning because without the collaborative effort of all cultures, it is impossible to define the significance of words that may be culturemes in the dictionary. Though, slowly, interactive and multimedia dictionaries have become extensive in information that lessen the bridge across languages and cultures.\n\nCulturemes are translated in several ways:\n\nIn translating, the inability to convey cultural meaning strips a cultureme of its \"cultureme\" title and it simply becomes an ambiguous word. Culture is classified into three categories: Norms, Ideas, and Materials.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "52257413", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52257413", "title": "Donald Trump in music", "text": "Donald Trump in music\n\nMany songs, albums, bands and performances have referenced Donald Trump or his various brands, including Trump Tower, his TV show, his hotel chain, and his casinos. Though recent songs refer to Trump's campaign and subsequent election as President of the United States, more than 200 songs refer to Trump prior to his successful presidential campaign between 1989 and 2013. With his victory in the 2016 presidential election, Trump's prominence in hip-hop music has been likened to that of Ronald Reagan's in hardcore punk during the 1980s.\n\nTrump's name first appeared in hip hop lyrics during the 1980s when the business mogul became an icon of the ultra rich. Among the earliest mentions of Trump in rap lyrics was the Beastie Boys' track \"Johnny Ryall\" on the 1989 \"Paul's Boutique\" album, in which they contrast Donald Trump with his homeless alter-ego, Donald Tramp.\n\nWhile many rappers praise Trump's wealth, usually comparing their own financial aspirations or success to that of the billionaire businessman, others have used their music as a platform to criticize Trump's practices and politics. Among the earliest of these was The Coup from Oakland, California, who critiqued and mocked Trump on their first two albums released in the early 1990s.\n\nESPN's political site FiveThirtyEight documented that between 1989 and 2014, 19% of song lyrics about Trump were negative while 60% were positive. The 2010s marked a left-leaning political shift in musicians' attitude toward Trump as his presence in the public eye changed from that of a business tycoon to a politician, particularly one known for making controversial statements. Because of hip hop's close association with minority communities and its reinvigorated politicization with the Black Lives Matter movement, lyrical depictions of Trump rapidly grew to be more disparaging throughout his campaign and subsequent election as President of the United States.\n\nMany artists have name-checked Trump in more than one song. Pre-presidency, Rick Ross had the most Trump mentions (nine songs between 2008 and 2015) with Nas running second (seven songs between 1996 and 2012). Other major Trump name-checkers include Migos (six songs between 2013 and 2016), Young Thug (six songs between 2013 and 2015), Lil Wayne (five songs between 2000 and 2012) and Raekwon (five songs between 1995 and 2012).\n\nWhen Mac Miller's 2011 song \"Donald Trump\" became a \"Billboard\" hit, Trump released a YouTube video congratulating the rapper:\n\nAs the song garnered more plays, Trump took a more aggressive tone and demanded royalties for using his name, thereby starting a feud with Miller. In early 2013, Trump threatened the rapper via a series of exchanges on Twitter:\n\nIn 2015 Trump changed his attitude toward Miller again when he ended an interview with \"The Hill\" by praising Miller's song as it approached 100 million hits. Miller later appeared on \"The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore\" to denounce Trump for his racial views during his run for President in 2016.\n\nOutside of hip hop, most lyrical references to Trump have appeared in songs ranging from satires of the billionaire, to outright protest in varying degrees of explicitness. One of the earliest Trump send-ups was the 1990 ballad \"Donald Trump (Black Version)\" written by Prince for fellow Minneapolis act The Time in which singer Morris Day calls himself a black version of Donald Trump, who can use his riches to \"fulfill [a woman's] every wish, [and her] every dream\". In 1992 Irish folk-rock group Goats Don't Shave had a #4 hit with \"Las Vegas in the Hills of Donegal,\" which references Trump's casino business in imagining an Irish county that becomes a gambling mecca.\n\nMore recently, songs like \"Fergus Laing\" by Scottish folk singer Richard Thompson present thinly veiled references to Trump without mentioning him by name, while songs like \"Fucked Up Donald\" by Canadian punk band D.O.A. are more direct. Many songs attack Trump by mocking his supporters through stereotypical portrayals of their views and lifestyles. Phoenix-based comedian Brian Nissen comedian stars as \"Mullets Over America\" spokesman Dwain in the music video \"Make America Great Again\", while Rocky Mountain Mike's cover of \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" remakes the lyrics to be about Trump, with the song's title alluding to the color of his skin. Sung from the perspective of a xenophobic Trump supporter, the song opens:\n\nIn October 2016, author Dave Eggers launched a project slated to release one anti-Trump song each day leading up to 2016's election day. Originally called \"30 Songs, 30 Days\", Eggers' plan was to have each song performed by a different artist, but due to more musicians coming through with songs, it grew to be 40, and then 50 songs in 30 days. Eggers worked on the project with Jordan Kurland with whom he had previously worked on two similar election-related projects. Eggers' inspiration for the project came when attending a Trump rally in Sacramento earlier that year. Participating artists included Death Cab for Cutie, Aimee Mann, Bhi Bhiman, Jim James, Franz Ferdinand, Josh Ritter, Thao Nguyen, EL VY, R.E.M., Adia Victoria, Moby, Lila Downs, Mac McCaughan, Tim Bluhm, Vinnie Paz, Jesu, Sun Kil Moon, Filthy Friends, Radioinactive, Sheila Brody, Ani DiFranco, Andrew Bird, Mirah, clipping., Sam Cohen, Blake Hazard, Wesley Stace, Loudon Wainwright III, Cold War Kids, Reggie Watts, Mission of Burma, Bob Mould, Ryan Miller, The Long Winters, Open Mike Eagle, Jimmy Eat World, Kyle Craft, Local Natives, Anthony D'Amato, Greg Holden, Laura Gibson, Tim Heidecker, Modern Baseball, Joe Purdy, and Rogue Wave.\n\nIn June 2017, Compound Sound LLC released \"Trumped Music\", a 32-minute album of eight songs which are Fair Use parodies of famous hit songs throughout the years. These songs are sung by impressionist Christopher John as 'Donald Trump', with several tracks also featuring impressionist Andrew Harris as 'Vladimir Putin'.\n\nAt the 2017 Lowlands Festival in the Netherlands, the American coloratura soprano Sara Hershkowitz performed György Ligeti's 1992 concert excerpts from his opera \"Le Grand Macabre\", titled \"Mysteries of the Macabre\", with the Noord Nederlands Orkest. She alluded to Donald Trump in three costumes which she changed on stage, a clown, baby outfit with a bottle, and a Miss America swimsuit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It appeared in April 2010.\n\nThe song received attention in Latin American rapidly got millions of hits. Calle 13 singer Residente called it YouTube's \"We Are the World\".\n\nThe video features three principals and a number of back-up singers. The principals are Peruvian singers La Tigresa del Oriente, Wendy Sulca and Indigenous Kichwa Ecuadorian singer-songwriter Delfin Quishpe, known as \"Delfín Hasta El Fín\". Quishpe has expressed a desire to visit Israel.\n\nThe opening shot is of video Delfin Quishpe sitting in a living room watching television. People on television speak of war, fear, and the dangers of living in Israel, despite the obvious fact that they are not Israeli. Delfin rises to his feet and shouts \"This cannot be,\" spreading his arms high and wide. The video segues to an introduction of each of the singers. The song then continues as a lovesong to Israel and Israelis. Gastón Cleiman, a Buenos Aires advertising man who wrote the song’s lyrics describes it as, \"a song against prejudice.” The score is by Gaby Kerpel and Daniel Mart.n Picky Talarico directed.\n\nThe tracks were recorded separately. Wendy and Bustos were recorded in Lima, while Delfin was recorded in Ecuador. The music was mixed and the video produced in Buenos Aires by Gaby Kerpel. The three performers were not acquainted and did not meet during the production of the video.\n\nThe video was intended by its creators to be taken as a genuinely naive work, a kind of online outsider art. It was taken for such by Alma Guillermoprieto who gushed over it in the ultra-sophisticated New York Review of Books, calling Latin America \"the last great reservoir of innocent art,\" and continuing:\n\n\"Their self-confidence and optimism we can only envy, and yet they have lives we can barely imagine (how much did the rural violence provoked by Peru’s Shining Path guerrillas influence Wendy’s parents’ decision to migrate to the capital?); they make choices that to us seem inscrutable (what is that monkey doing behind the rowboat?). But millions of people admire these singers. What the video shows us is the chaotic transformation of a culture that has always had an infinite and joyful capacity for self-invention. This is not outsider but insider art of the deepest sort, forged in a hot-hot crucible, and it is we who stand on the outside, peering wistfully at the screen.\"\n\nThe video’s great success has brought new opportunities for the three performers. A party promoter brought \"La Tigresa\" to Buenos Aires, where diners in an upscale restaurant greeter her by breaking into the chorus of “En Tus Tierras Bailaré.” She was and hailed as a gay icon and stopped in the street by fans wanting photos. There is talk of a world tour, ending in Israel.\n"}

{"id": "5437039", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5437039", "title": "Festival of Lights (Lyon)", "text": "Festival of Lights (Lyon)\n\nThe Festival of Lights () in Lyon, France expresses gratitude toward Mary, mother of Jesus around December 8th of each year. This uniquely Lyonnaise tradition dictates that every house place candles along the outsides of all the windows to produce a spectacular effect throughout the streets. The festival includes other activities based on light and usually lasts four days, with the peak of activity occurring on the 8th. The two main focal points of activity are typically the Basilica of Fourvière which is lit up in different colours, and the Place des Terreaux, which hosts a different light show each year.\n\nThe origins of the festival date to 1643 when Lyon was struck by plague. On September 8, 1643 the municipal councillors (\"échevins\") promised to pay tribute to Mary if the town was spared. Ever since, a solemn procession makes its way to the Basilica of Fourvière on 8 December (the feast of the Immaculate Conception) to light candles and give offerings in the name of Mary. In part, the event thus commemorates the day Lyon was consecrated to the Virgin Mary.\n\nIn 1852, it became a popular festival when a statue of the Virgin Mary was erected next to the Basilica, overlooking the city. Now a focal point of the festival, the statue was created by the renowned sculptor Joseph-Hugues Fabisch and was sponsored by several notable Lyonnais Catholics. It was then accepted by Maurice Cardinal de Bonald in 1850. The inauguration of the statue was due to take place on September 8, 1852, the day of celebration of the Nativity of the Virgin. However, the flooding of the Saône prevented the statue from being ready. The archbishop, with the agreement of a committee of lay people, therefore chose to move the date back to the 8 December.\n\nBy 1852 in Lyon, December 8 had already been a celebration for the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin. Leading up to the inauguration, everything was in place for the festivities: The statue was lit up with flares, fireworks were readied for launching from the top of Fourvière Hill and marching bands were set to play in the streets. The prominent Catholics of the time suggested lighting up the façades of their homes as was traditionally done for major events such as royal processions and military victories.\n\nHowever, on the morning of the big day, a storm struck Lyon. The master of ceremonies hastily decided to cancel everything and to push back the celebrations once more to the following Sunday. In the end the skies cleared and the people of Lyon, who had been eagerly anticipating the event, spontaneously lit up their windows, descended into the streets and lit flares to illuminate the new statue and the Chapel of Notre-Dame-de-Fourvière, later superseded by the Basilica. The people sang songs and cried \"Vive Marie!\" until late in the night. This celebration was then repeated from year to year.\n\nThus, tradition now dictates that every family in Lyon keep, along with its Christmas decorations, a collection of stained or clear glass in which candles are burnt on windowsills on 8 December. These stout, fluted candles can be found in shops towards the end of November.\n\nNowadays, the city council puts on professionally run performances. The people of Lyon's participation remains strong as evidenced by numerous façades lit up in the traditional way and by the throngs of people wandering the streets on 8 December.\n\nHistorians and sociologists note the rather misinformed notions that the people of Lyon have concerning the celebration's origins: confusion over the thanks given to Mary, as well as the dates involved, leads people to think the celebration commemorates the establishment of the Basilica of Notre-Dame de Fourvière or a wish granted after a plague supposedly struck in the 19th century.\n\nNowadays, the festival draws 3 to 4 million people each year.\n\nIn 2015, the festival was scaled back, owing to the nationwide state of emergency banning large assemblies in the wake of the November 13 attacks in Paris. The festival was limited to the traditional lumignon candles and an installation which paid tribute to the victims of the terrorist attacks, whose first names were displayed over the buildings of the quays.\n\nBecause of the continuing risk of attacks, the 2016 edition of the festival took place in a smaller area than usual and will lasted for three days instead of four. Security inspections were conducted at entrances to the event and additional security forces were provided by the Minister of the Interior.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "23529232", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23529232", "title": "Gambling in Russia", "text": "Gambling in Russia\n\nGambling in Russia is legal in only four regional subject areas, and in 2009 was made illegal in all other areas of Russia.\n\nIn 2009, gambling was banned almost everywhere in Russia. The only exceptions are four specially arranged zones in the Altai, Krasnodar, Kaliningrad, and Primorsky regions.\n\nGambling has been a major policy problem for the Russian government since the early 21st century. The problem was the rapidly increasing number of slot machines and gambling houses, including casinos, spreading all over the country. This caused a little concern for the government. According to city officials, after the year 2002 there were 58 casinos, 2,000 gaming rooms and approximately 70,000 slot machines in Moscow.\nIt became a greater problem for the government because the younger population was widely exposed to the obtrusive advertising of gambling houses. Teenagers missed school to crowd around slot machines hoping to win some money. This behavior affected the society’s welfare in a way that was external to the market, thus, giving rise to a negative externality. Experts from the Russian Association of Gambling Business Development claimed that approximately half a million people on a regular basis indulged in gambling in the capital city of Moscow. At the same time, city psychiatrists, who met with people addicted to excessive gambling, provided quite different information arguing that the number was much higher. “The head of the extra-hospital aid in the National Narcological Scientific Center Taras Dudko says that the number of people regularly going to Moscow casinos, bookmaking offices and gambling houses is over 1.5 million people”.\nAccording to marketing research by Bookmaker-Ratings, in Russia from May 2016 till May 2017 services of illegal offshore bookmakers were used by 1 million 410 thousand players, services of legal Russian bookmakers – by 820 thousand players. Additionally, money laundering was another concern of every city government that failed to collect estimated tax revenue from gambling businesses, that kept the profits and did not share them with the city by avoiding tax payment. \nThese were the major rationales for the government to get involved and implement a policy on gambling restriction. \nOne of the policy solutions to solve the gambling problem in Russia was proposed in the form of limiting the number of gambling establishments throughout the country. Additionally, the Moscow officials proposed to bar slot machine parlors within 500 yards of a residential area, which would force operators out of all urban areas in the country in order to protect the young generation from being tempted to lose money using slot machines. \nThe major policy problem about excessive gambling in the Russian society and their people’s continuous discontent with the spread of gambling houses all over the country finally led to the implementation of federal policy. Russia closed down its casinos overnight as gambling was banned nationwide. Thus since July 1, 2009, according to the Federal Law № 244 “On state regulation of organization and management of gambling”, the gambling business in Russia has been allowed only in four designated zones. The ban was to protect the health of society, and was expected to put an end to the era which witnessed an eruption of gambling fueled by a lawless business culture, which caused great costs to the society. Despite the ban, gambling continues working, pretending to be Internet cafes, lottery clubs, nightclubs.\n\nAt the end of 1927, the People’s Commissar of the Interior presented a report devoted to gambling and the gaming business existing at that time to the RSFSR SPC. The main idea voiced through the report was that its incompatibility of an idle, bourgeois pastime with\nthe true spirit of the working proletariat. And, regardless of the rather modest figures in the gaming sector (for example, only 4 small gaming houses operated in Leningrad at that time), the key prohibitive provisions in the report were approved.\n\nAll this led to a ban on the opening of gambling houses in worker districts, it was followed by a ban on gambling in the entire districts, and later, on May 8, 1928, by the resolution of the USSR SPC, all Soviet Republics were instructed, the reasons not being explained, \"to take measures on the immediate closure of any facilities for card games, roulette, lotto and other kinds of gambling\". The closure of gaming houses and the gambling ban were pushed by the penal policy course shaped by the Soviet state, providing for overall reinforcement of criminal sanctions in the country and the modification of the state's penitentiary policy upon the whole. Later, lotteries were also restricted. On June 6, 1928, the Workers-Peasants’ Government of the RSFSR issues the resolution, \"On Banning the Draw of Liquors in Lotteries\". First, on January 1, 1930, the USSR SPC issues the resolution \"On the Procedure of Issuing Permits for Lottery Arrangement\", and then, on August 31, 1932, another USSR SPC Resolution #1336 was announced, \"On the Regulation of the Lottery Business\".\n\nThe first slot machines which appeared in the country quite lawfully, were installed only in 1988 in hotels which were part of the USSR State Committee of Foreign Tourism (Goscomintourist). Within the system, the All-Russian Business External Trade Union (VHVO) \"Intourservice\" is set up, developing new kinds of additional services for foreign tourists, payable in free convertible currency. And private businesses have no access to gambling operations. Despite an eagerness to deal with slot machine installation and operation, the Soviete authorities allowed it only within its state structures, only as an experiment. To be on the safe side, there was a legal reminder that the business still cannot be entered. On December 29, 1988, the Council of Ministers of the USSR issued another resolution, this time \"On the Regulation of Certain Activities of Cooperatives According to the Law on Cooperation in the USSR\", which, in particular, stressed that cooperatives are not entitled to perform gambling operations.\n\nOn August 23, 1989, the Soviet government lifted its ban on gambling and opened the first gambling house in Moscow and later, the first casino was opened in the capital city’s Savoy Hotel.\n\nPoker in Russia was very popular during the collapse of the USSR, when people started being interested in Western culture and values.\n\nIn the Soviet Union it was possible to play poker only in cellar clubs or the casino. In addition, players often gathered in private flats. By the end of the 90s it was the first attempt to hold poker tournaments, but it did not get the widespread popularity at the time.\n\nIn 2004, the Law #142-FZ “On Gambling Tax” being in effect for a sixth year, Chapter 29 “Gambling Tax” of the Russian Federation’s Tax Code came into effect. A new and the most complicated stage in the area of gambling taxation began. As of January 1, 2004, gambling tax became regional and its receipts are transferred to the budgets of the Federation’s constituent entities. As of 2004, each region was entitled to independently determine the gambling tax rate within the limits provided for by the Law #142-FZ “On Gambling Tax”. The taxation rate for slot machines with cash winnings was 1,500 to 7,500 roubles and for gaming tables, totalisator cash desks and bookmaker cash desks – 25,000 to 125,000 roubles. Any previous privileges with regard to the gambling tax were cancelled.\n\nThe state regulation of activities involved in gambling organisation and arrangement was performed by the government, by the federal executive agency authorised by the government to perform functions on standard and legal regulation in the area of\ngambling organisation, by other federal executive authorities within their competence and by the governmental bodies of the Russian Federation’s constituent entities, authorised to perform the functions of gaming zone management.\n\nGambling may be arranged solely by legal entities registered according to the set procedure within the Russian Federation. Gambling cannot be arranged by legal entities, the founders (participants) of which include the Russian Federation, the Russian Federation’s constituent entities or local government authorities.\n\nThe law contemplates that four gaming zones will be created within the Russian Federation; meanwhile no more than one gaming zone may be created within one and the same constituent entity. If Legal Requlation of Gambling in Former USSR Countries and Foreign States the created gaming zone belongs to several regions, no other gaming zones may be created within their territories. Gaming zones are to be set up within the Altay, Primorie and Kaliningrad regions and on the border between the Krasnodar region and Rostov region. The procedure of gaming zone creation and liquidation, their names, borders and other characteristics, will be determined by the government upon an agreement with the government bodies in constituent entities. The existence of gaming zones has no time limits. A decision on the liquidation of a gaming zone by the government may not be made until ten years after it was created. A ruling on the creation of a gaming zone may set requirements for certain types of gambling facilities, as well as other restrictions. Gambling facilities, except bookmakers’ offices and totalisators, may be opened only within the gaming zones according to the procedure set out by the law. Furthermore, the boundaries of the gaming zones should have been outlined by July 1, 2007, whereas they cannot be created on land in populated localities.\n\nThe names of the territories are \"Siberian Coin\" (Altay), \"Yantarnaya\" (Kaliningrad region), \"Azov-city\" (Rostov region) and \"Primorie\" (Primorie region).\n\nThe gambling operator should submit the data needed for exercising control of compliance with the legislative requirements. The net assets of the gambling operator, throughout the entire period of their activities, cannot be less than: 600,000,000 roubles (for operators of casinos and slot halls) and 100,000,000 roubles (for operators of bookmakers’ offices and totalisators). The procedure for the calculation of the value of the gambling operator’s net assets will be set by the Ministry of Finance, while the Government may establish additional requirements for gambling operators.\n\nThe gambling operator shall secure the personal safety of gamblers, other visitors to gambling facilities and their employees during their stay in the gambling facility. People under 18 cannot be the gambling operator’s employees or visit a gambling facility. Gambling facilities may be located only in buildings which are capital construction projects. Gambling facilities cannot be located in residential fund properties, uncompleted constructions, temporary structures, kiosks, open shelters and other similar premises; in buildings and constructions where children’s, educational, healthcare and sanatorium institutions are located; in buildings and constructions including bus stations, railway stations, river stations, river ports, airports, at stations and stops for any public transport(common carriers) for urban and suburban services, etc., as well as on plots of land where the above-mentioned facilities are situated.\n\nBookmakers’ offices and totalisators, apart from those opened within gaming zones, may be opened solely based on licences, the\nprocedure of issuing which will be determined by the government The customer service area for gamblers in casinos cannot be less\nthan 800 square metres. The customer service area in a casino shall feature at least ten gaming tables. Should slot machines be installed in the casino customer service area, the area of the slot machine zone cannot be less than 100 square metres and the zone shall feature at least 50 slot machines. The technically implied average winnings (payback) from a slot machine cannot be less than 90 percent\n\nThe law came into effect as of January 1, 2007. The gambling facilities which comply with the above-mentioned requirements may continue their operations till June 30, 2009, without obtaining permits for activities on gambling organisation and arrangement in gaming zones. Any gambling facilities that fail to comply with the requirements set out by the law shall be closed by July 1, 2007. Gambling operations using information and telecommunication networks, including the Internet, and communication means, including mobile communications, are prohibited. Gaming business licensing was also changed. In fact, there remained only one activity to be licensed – the organisation and arrangement of gambling in bookmakers’ offices and totalisators. In legal terms, gambling operations in casinos and slot halls will exist only on a pro forma basis as of July 1, 2007 and as of July 1, 2009, licensing will be completely substituted with a system of permits and shift to a regional level from a federal one.\nThe latest edition of the law on gambling business falls on March 28, 2017. This Act regulates the legal framework of state control over the activities of institutions that organize gambling. The Act introduces restrictions on the exercise of this activity in order to protect citizens' morals and the legitimate interests of the population.\n\n\n"}

Voices from a Medieval Village is a 2007 children's book written by Laura Amy Schlitz. The book was awarded the 2008 Newbery Medal for excellence in children's literature.\n\nInstead of the typical narrative structure, the book is constructed of a series of monologues, each spoken by a young member of a medieval village. Each character has a monologue with the exceptions of Petronella and Jacob, and Mariot and Maud, who have dialogues. The book was originally written to be performed by fifth-grade students at the Park School of Baltimore, where Schlitz is a librarian. It contains nineteen monologues and two dialogues, with the characters ranging from a runaway boy to the lord's daughter.\n\nAccording to \"Kirkus Reviews\", \"Schlitz takes the breath away with unabashed excellence in every direction.\" Deirdre F. Baker wrote in \"The Horn Book Magazine\", \"Byrd's pristine, elegant pen-and-ink illustrations in opulent colors make the book almost too visually appealing, belying the realistically dirty, stinky conditions described in the text.\" John Schwartz, in \"The New York Times\", called Schlitz a \"talented storyteller\" and praised the book for its frank depiction of the Middle Ages. Nina Lindsay, chair of the Newbery Medal committee, called the monologues \"superb\" and stated that as a whole, they \"create a pageant that transports readers to a different time and place.\"\n\nIn 2008, Anita Silvey, author of \"100 Best Books for Children\", described \"Good Masters! Sweet Ladies!\" in a \"School Library Journal\" article as one of several recent Newbery winners considered \"particularly disappointing\" by public librarians. Silvey \"criticized the Newbery selections as too difficult for most children.\" Writing for \"Slate\", Erica S. Perl responded to this criticism, saying that while her younger self might not have enjoyed the subject matter or archaic language, her \"inner drama geek\" would have enjoyed the theatrical elements.\n"}
{"id": "6235184", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6235184", "title": "Gothic 3", "text": "Gothic 3\n\nGothic 3 is a fantasy-themed open world action role-playing game for Microsoft Windows from the German game developer Piranha Bytes. It is the sequel to \"Gothic II\". Although widely available in English, the native release of the game is German. The North American release incorporates two patches that appeared after the initial UK edition.\n\nA \"Collector's Edition\" was also released containing bonus collectible material. JoWooD released a standalone expansion, entitled \"\", in November 2008.\n\nThe player must complete quests and slay wild animals and monsters to earn experience and improve skills. The game is reputation centric allowing the player to side with a faction. While there are six factions in the game, only three are joinable: the Rebels, the Orc mercenaries and the Hashishin. The remaining factions are the Rangers, the Nomads and the people of Nordmar. The player is able to take advantage of missions to allow either side to take over towns. Dialog changes according to in-game actions and behavior. The game places a special focus on the interactivity of the environment. The controls have been altered slightly with a stronger focus on action. Navigation and combat are more mouse-centric, with each mouse button having a different combat action. The Nameless Hero can also now wield dual weapons or use a shield.\n\nThe first part of Gothic tells the story of The Nameless Hero, a man thrust into the events of a penal colony. The colony takes the form of a natural landscape encased in a large magical shield known as The Barrier, much like an impenetrable dome. Over the course of the story, The Nameless Hero becomes acquainted with several characters, the most notable of which are Diego, Lee, Cor Angar, Lester, Gorn, Lares, Milten, and Xardas. Some of these characters are connected with the various factions of the game, which include the \"Old Camp\", the \"New Camp\" and the \"Swamp Camp\". Also connected with these factions are the water and fire mages, of which Xardas is an outcast. Xardas, a necromancer, plays a central part to the survival and advancement of the character. Ultimately, he galvanizes the character toward the ultimate goal of stopping the summoning of a beast known as \"The Sleeper\", but the entrance was guarded by a camp of orcs. The hero was helped by an orc shaman named Ur-Shak, who made an artifact that would prevent the orcs from attacking him. The Nameless Hero banishes \"The Sleeper\" at the cost of nearly losing his own life.\n\nThe second part of Gothic sees The Nameless Hero resurrected by Xardas into a new setting. Now located outside the city of Khorinis, he is asked by Xardas to investigate a new evil that threatens Khorinis and the surrounding lands. Over the course of the story, The Nameless Hero reconnects with old friends from the first chapter while adjusting to changes in the faction structure. With the penal colony and its barrier a thing of the past, the surrounding lands have been invaded by orcs. Factions now consist of the \"Militia/Paladins\" of Khorinis, the \"Fire Novices/Fire Mages\", and the \"Mercenaries/Dragon Hunters\". Water mages also make a return. Having discovered the source of the evil threatening Khorinis, our hero assembles a crew of trusted friends and sails to a nearby island. There he battles a large undead dragon, completing the central quest of the chapter. The chapter closes with the hero and his allies sailing away from the island.\n\n\"Gothic 2\" also has an expansion called \"Night of the Raven\". In the expansion, the Hero faced many new dangers and a new unexplored world. The Water Mages played an important role in the expansion. There was a new faction known as the Ring of Water, who had the same relationship to the Water Mages as the Paladins do to the Fire Mages. The main antagonist was Raven, who was second-in-command to Gomez, leader of the Old Camp, in the first game. Raven wanted to command the armies of Beliar, the evil one of the 3 gods, along with a new powerful weapon known as the Claw of Beliar.\n\nThe third part opens with the Nameless Hero and his friends sailing to a new continent overrun with orcs, arriving in Myrtana, the central region of the continent. The hero lost all his belongings from the previous game when his ship is stolen while he's onshore with Milten, Diego, Gorn, and Lester. Presumably this is the source of the orc invasion that was launched on Khorinis during the second chapter. These lands have no physical connection to Khorinis or the ruins of the penal colony. In these mountainous forests the orcs have enslaved the human kingdom with only a few free humans living in the nearly uninhabitable icy northlands of Nordmar and the southern desert of Varant. The hero must decide whether to join the rebellion and stay true to the deposed human king, serve the Orcish usurpers in their quest to topple the last remaining human stronghold, or choose a path that serves his own ends. Throughout the story, he is accompanied by a number of NPCs, some of whom are old friends. While this chapter brings forward friends from the previous title (Xardas, Diego, Milten, Gorn, Lester, Lee, and Vatras) it also introduces two new major characters; King Rhobar the Second (who ultimately was responsible for sending the Nameless Hero to the penal colony in the first game) and Zuben. While the king has a strong past as a bold leader, he now faces a near defeat; his fame is on the decline. Zuben leads the Hashishin that inhabit the southern region of Varant.\n\n\"Gothic 3\" is powered by a custom engine called Genome; it supports Pixel Shader 3.0, has a multithreaded design and includes dynamic lighting (including self-shadowing). Character animation uses EMotion FX 2 and physics simulation is provided by Ageia's PhysX physics engine. It also uses IDV's SpeedTreeRT tree and plant software, Bink Video Technology from RAD Game Tools for the cutscenes, as well as the FMOD Sound System from Firelight Technologies for sound playback.\n\nThe game was designed for a minimum system requirement of a 2.0 GHz Intel Pentium 4 with 768 MB System RAM; recommended video cards include an ATI X1600, Nvidia GeForce 6800 series or better if possible.\n\nAfter a release with many problems and bugs, a dispute between the publisher and developer led to their separation in 2007. The game remained with the last released patch 1.12 in a buggy and unfinished state, and an announced further patch and editor were not finished.\n\nTherefore, the copyright holding publisher Jowood granted access to the source code to developers from the game community to allow the fans at least take care of the significant problems and bugs themselves. In years of voluntary and unpaid work the fan community produced several community patches, with an actual iteration version 1.75 released on April 2012. With this 1.5 GB sized patch significant enhancements and fixes were introduced, so that finally a playable state of the game was achieved. Also, a \"Community Story Project\" still works on fixing inconsistencies in former \"Gothic\" games and on filling story gaps. In 2014 an additional patch and a data optimizer for the 1.75.14 version became available fixing some of the remaining issues.\n\nOn November 21, 2008 JoWooD Productions released a standalone expansion entitled \"Gothic 3: Forsaken Gods\", developed by Trine Games. \"Gothic 3: Forsaken Gods\" was similar buggy as the original game and was later fixed in an \"Enhanced Edition\" by Mad Vulture Games, a company which was created by developers from the game community.\n\n\"Gothic 3\" was a commercial success, with global sales over 500,000 copies by March 2007.\n\nThe game received \"mixed\" reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Prior to its release in early October 2006, Gothic 3 was nominated as the best game of E3 by IGN. Since the release, most concerns have centered on bugs. \"Hyper\"'s Daniel Wilks commended the game for its \"ton of quests, rewards exploration and approachable combat\". However, he criticised it for \"system hogging, feeling unfinished and atrocious voice acting\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10671765", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10671765", "title": "Media meshing", "text": "Media meshing\n\nMedia meshing is the process of using one of the media, such as a blog or a website, to enhance the experience of another medium, such as a newspaper article or a fictional television program. \"Meshing\" may describe activities and motivations of an information receiver which are completely independent of the intentions of the source of that information. \"Meshing\" may also be used to describe the activities of an information provider, who may intentionally encourage consumer engagement by using multiple media or channels of information exchange related to a product or organization, as in an integrated advertising campaign. Strictly, in both cases, \"media meshing\" ultimately describes the \"behaviour\" of the person \"receiving\" the information.\n\nWhen the meshing of media sources is encouraged by the source itself, as is often the case with commercial products and special interest promotions, media meshing may be better described as integrated media. This describes the activity desired by commercial entities when they encourage web traffic through non-web media such as billboards or newspaper articles in a comprehensive advertising campaign.\n\nHowever, from the perspective of the information consumer, Lerma describes that meshing represents a way to experience media which is fundamentally different from the way people interacted with mass media in the past. When the participants themselves choose the channels, pieces, sources, and specific media that they use to enhance or disassemble the first piece of media they encounter, especially when these are perceived to be mostly independent sources, the result is an enriched self-discovery experience with a level of engagement not possible from even the most well designed guided experiences. Meshing goes beyond simply mutually inclusive public relations across media channels, pieces, and product placement. Broadband technology and diversity of online services have increased the accessibility and prevalence of simultaneous media experiences to the point where some would argue there is a new, more demanding and more inquisitive, incarnation of information consumers. The richness of experience in meshing becomes even more evident when information receivers puts their new views and interpretations back into the media by posting or answering questions on a discussion forum or blog, publishing a formal in-depth response, or creating an independent fan site. In cases like these, the persons may be called information prosumers, as they are both consuming information from various sources and producing a web of related information for other \"meshers\" to \"consume\" (or \"prosumers\" to mesh).\nIt is arguable, however, that this is the traditional approach of historians and scientists to information sources, and that what is new is the speed and ease with which cross-referencing and elaboration can be achieved with the media delivery and display technology that is used, and the amount of time invested in multi-source research by the non-specialized population. It is also arguable that multi-form/multi-source information gathering only \"seems\" new when contrasted to the recent era of single-voice and non-interactive commercial television and radio information broadcasting. It is also important to note that if the sources are not chosen carefully to be as orthogonal as possible, media meshing will result in a false reassurance of the \"facts\" presented by the single-voice of the original articles, but it would still technically be media meshing (i.e., confirming a CNN television story about an event in London by meshing the CNN.com web-site, BBC radio, and \"The Guardian\" newspaper will probably confirm the original facts, but a different set of facts may be forthcoming from an email to a friend who lives there or from reading a blog from a beat-cop in the area.)\n\nThe following activities, while perhaps not unique to media meshing, are characteristic of this type of 'enhanced' media consumption\n\n\n\n"}

Based in San Francisco, the company develops and sells web-based services for 3D character animation. Mixamo's technologies use machine learning methods to automate the steps of the character animation process, including 3D modeling to rigging and 3D animation.\n\nMixamo is spun-off of Stanford University and has raised over $11 million from investors Granite Ventures, Keynote Ventures, Stanford University and AMD Ventures. Mixamo was acquired by Adobe Systems on June 1, 2015.\n\nMixamo was founded in 2008 by Stefano Corazza and Nazim Kareemi as a spin-off of Stanford University's Biomotion Lab, and started out as a cloud-based service offering animations and automatic character rigging. It launched its first online animation service in 2009. In 2010, Mixamo worked with Evolver to provide characters to customers. Later Autodesk acquired Evolver and made it proprietary, but Mixamo had already begun work on its own character creation service.\n\nMixamo released its automatic rigging service in 2011. That was followed by the launch of its real-time facial animation product, Face Plus, in 2013, and the official launch of its Fuse 3D character creator software in March 2014. In August 2014, Mixamo launched a new pricing structure.\n\nIn March 2014, Mixamo officially launched Fuse Character Creator at Game Developers Conference. Fuse stems out of the research done by Siddhartha Chaudhuri which originated within Vladlen Koltun's research group at Stanford and Substance technology from Allegorithmic. An early version of the service had been released in November 2013.\n\nIt allows users to create a 3D character by assembling customizable body parts, clothing and textures together. Those characters can then be exported into other 3D model software packages or game engine. In March 2014, Mixamo launched Fuse 1.0 on Steam with the ability of importing and integrating user generated content in the character creation system. Fuse was updated to allow the importation and editing of character models generated by Microsoft's Kinect 2.0 in August of that year.\n\nMixamo also provides an online, automatic model rigging service known as the Auto-Rigger, which was the industry's first online rigging service. The AutoRigger applies machine learning to understand where the limbs of a 3D model are and to insert a \"skeleton\", or rig, into the 3D model as well as calculating the skinning weights. The service can take up to 2 minutes.\n\nMixamo's online services include an animation store featuring downloadable 3D models and animation sequences. The animations were created at Mixamo using motion capture and cleaned up by key frame animators. All its animations work with characters created in Fuse and/or rigged with Mixamo's AutoRigger.\n\nAugust 2013, Mixamo released Face Plus, a game development tool that allows users to record facial animation data of themselves using a standard webcam and apply the animation to a character inside the Unity game engine in real-time. Face Plus was briefly included in the keynote presentation at the Unite conference in Vancouver. The technology was developed in collaboration with AMD. and uses GPU acceleration.\n\nThe animated short \"Unplugged\" was created using Face Plus technology and as of April 2014 has won several awards.\n\n"}

The purchase of the Climax Racing studio, developer of most of the previous titles in the series, from Climax Studios by Disney Interactive Studios led to speculation over who would be developing the game. However, a promo video on the Xbox Live Marketplace confirmed that Climax Studios were still involved in \"MotoGP '07\".\n\n\"MotoGP '07\" features complete rider and team data, new 800cc MotoGP bikes and all 18 circuit of the 2007 MotoGP season. The title also features interactive track-side crowds, on-line tournament features, on-line \"pink slip\" racing, and a revamped Extreme mode. The revamped Extreme mode allows for over one million possible bike customizations.\n\nIn addition, minor gameplay changes have been made to the handling and braking to allow for easier player accessibility. Changes to acceleration and deceleration have been made to add to the realism which will make turns easier to navigate through. Slight fishtailing with hard braking has been put in to give a better feel for the handling of the bike and to let the player know how effective their braking is.\n\nAlso, the ability of the player to customise their bikes is greatly increased. In Extreme mode the player can upgrade their bike with various performance modifications: carbon brakes, race exhausts, magnesium/carbon wheels etc. In Grand Prix mode, the customisation is limited to visual upgrades, though \"MotoGP'07\" now allows players greater control over the appearance of their bike. Despite this, some players have complained that the visual modifications are still fairly restrictive - the main criticism is that the custom paintwork option still restricts the player to the same limited amount of customisation as the previous games, despite the fact that the overall visual modification option has been overhauled. This leaves the player unable to design or customise the paint on their bike to approximate the level of design detail achieved by other AI racers.. Whether this issue will be resolved in future patches is not known.\n\nIn addition to this the PC version of the game features a corrupt model of the Yamaha M1 with the rear cowling misformed visible on Rossi and Edwards' bikes. Also the crowds in grandstands no longer work with post 2010's graphics drivers on the PC and shimmer.\n\nThe game features Ilmor GP to ride but In real life Ilmor rider Jeremy McWilliams crashed before the first Round of the season in Qatar, resulting in him not Being able to take part in the race. Andrew Pitt, the second Rider, raced alone. However, Ilmor GP does not appear in more races since Ilmor retired from the 2007 Championship after the first GP in Qatar.\n\nHowever, Jeremy McWilliams and Andrew Pitt and the Ilmor GP bike are available to use as a playable driver and bike in the championship mode and race mode and in the quick races\n\nIn championship mode, the Ilmor GP team was removed to avoid running against them,\n\nIn sports race, you can use the Ilmor GP team to customize it and play with it but like the championship mode, the Ilmor GP team is removed and we will not be able to race against them.\n\nIn quick race, one rider IA will be replaced random for Andrew Pitt, since the game only has 19 bikes at a time, 20 bikes for the sports race mode.\n\n\"MotoGP '07\" had a somewhat protracted release in the United Kingdom. While the Xbox release proceeded as planned, the PC version was delayed twice: originally delayed until the first week of September, and then delayed again until the eventual release date of September 28.\n\nThe Xbox 360 version received \"generally favorable reviews\", while the PC version received \"average\" reviews, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.\n\n"}
{"id": "37846886", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37846886", "title": "Musical hallucinations", "text": "Musical hallucinations\n\nMusical hallucinations fall under the category of auditory hallucinations and describe a disorder in which a sound is perceived as instrumental music, sounds, or songs. It is a very rare disorder, reporting only 0.16% in a cohort study of 3,678 individuals.\n\nIn 73 individual cases reviewed by Evers and Ellger, 57 patients heard tunes that were familiar, while 5 heard unfamiliar tunes. These tunes ranged from religious pieces to childhood favorites, and also included popular songs from the radio. Vocal and instrumental forms of classical music were also identified in some patients. Keshavan found that the consistent feature of musical hallucinations was that it represented a personal memory trace. Memory traces refer to anything that may seem familiar to the patient, which indicate why certain childhood or familiar songs were heard.\n\nInvestigators have successfully narrowed down the major factors that are associated with musical hallucinations. Evers and Ellgers compiled a significant portion of musical hallucination articles, case studies etc. and were able to categorize five major etiologies:\n\n\nHypoacusis is defined as impairment in hearing or deafness. Hypoacusis is one of five etiologies of musical hallucinations, and is the most common in the case studies reviewed by Evers and Ellgers. According to Sanchez et al. 2011, there have been suggestions that pontine lesions could alter the central auditory system's function causing hypoacusis and musical hallucinations.\n\nA case study by Janakiraman et al. 2006, revealed a 93‑year‑old woman with major depressive disorder who experienced musical hallucinations while treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Investigators found that the patient's depression symptoms were inversely related to her hallucinations and primarily stemmed from the ECT treatment. The patient had no known abnormalities in hearing, suggesting that musical hallucinations could arise from a variety of sources including psychiatric illnesses. After a complete course of ECT, her hallucinations dissipated, also suggesting that they can be acute.\n\nAccording to Evers and Ellgers, some other major psychiatric disorders that contribute to musical hallucinations include schizophrenia and depression. Some patients who have schizophrenia experience musical hallucinations due to their ongoing psychosis, but there are some cases that do so without psychosis. There are also a very small percentage of musical hallucination cases due to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).\n\nAmong the handful of cases that Evers and Ellgers studied, major lesion sites included the temporal cortex; however, the specific location and laterality (left vs. right temporal cortex) was variable. Many cases of focal brain lesions had comorbidity with hearing impairment (see hypoacusis), epileptic activity and intoxication. There have also been several findings of acute musical hallucinations in patients with dorsal pons lesions post-stroke and encephalitis potentially due to disruption of connections between the sensory cortex and reticular formation.\n\nEpileptic brain activity in musical hallucinations originates in the left or right temporal lobe. In a specific case studied by Williams et al. 2008, a patient who received a left temporal lobectomy in order to treat epilepsy was diagnosed with musical hallucinations post-surgery. The patient also had multiple additional risk factors that could have accounted for the hallucinations including mild neuropsychiatric dysfunction and tinnitus.\n\nIntoxication accounts for a small percentage of musical hallucination cases. Intoxication leads to either withdrawal or inflammatory encephalopathy, which are major contributors to musical hallucinations. Some of the drugs that have been found to relate to musical hallucinations include salicylates, benzodiazepines, pentoxifylline, propranolol, clomipramine, amphetamine, quinine, imipramine, a phenothiazine, carbamazepine, marijuana, paracetamol, phenytoin, procaine, and alcohol. General anesthesia has also been association with musical hallucinations.\nIn a case study by Gondim et al. 2010, a seventy–seven-year-old woman with Parkinson's disease (PD) was administered amantadine after a year of various other antiparkinsonian treatments. Two days into her treatment, she started to experience musical hallucinations, which consisted of four musical pieces. The music persisted until three days after cessation of the drug. Although the patient was taking other medications at the same time, the timing of onset and offset suggested that amantadine either had a synergistic effect with the other drugs or simply caused the hallucinations. Although the case wasn't specific to intoxication, it leads to the idea that persons with PD who are treated with certain drugs can experience musical hallucinations.\n\nPositron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) show that musical hallucinations activate a wide variety of areas in the brain including the following: auditory areas, motor cortex, visual areas, basal ganglia, brainstem, pons, tegmentum, cerebellum, hippocampi, amygdala, and peripheral auditory system.\n\nTo date, there is no successful method of treatment that \"cures\" musical hallucinations. There have been successful therapies in single cases that have ameliorated the hallucinations. Some of these successes include drugs such as neuroleptics, antidepressants, and certain anticonvulsive drugs. A musical hallucination was alleviated, for example, by antidepressant medications given to patients with depression. Sanchez reported that some authors have suggested that the use of hearing aids may improve musical hallucination symptoms. They believed that the external environment influences the auditory hallucinations, showing worsening of symptoms in quieter environments than in noisier ones. Oliver Sacks' patient, Mrs. O'C, reported being in an \"ocean of sound\" despite being in a quiet room due to a small thrombosis or infarction in her right temporal lobe. After treatment, Mrs. O'C was relinquished of her musical experience but said that, \"I do miss the old songs. Now, with lots of them, I can't even recall them. It was like being given back a forgotten bit of my childhood again.\" Sacks also reported another elderly woman, Mrs. O'M, who had a mild case of deafness and reported hearing musical pieces. When she was treated with anticonvulsive medications, her musical hallucinations ceased but when asked if she missed them, she said \"Not on your life.\"\n\nAccording to Oliver Sacks' \"Hallucinations\", the first known medical report of musical hallucinations was published in 1846, by French alienist Jules Baillarger. However, the first scientific description of the disorder was reported in the early 1900s. In the last two decades, Berrios has reported case studies in 1990 and 1991 along with Keshavan et al. in 1992. Berrios concluded that confirmed diagnoses of deafness, ear disease, brain disease, advanced age and drug use are all important factors in the development of musical hallucinations. After analyzing 46 cases, Berrios found a female predominance of 80% in women over the age of 60. The study concluded that musical hallucinations were more likely to be seen in elderly women affected by deafness or brain disease than in individuals with no psychiatric illness at all.\n\nKeshevan and Berrios were the first authors to identify classes of musical hallucinations. These classes consisted of hearing loss, coarse brain disease (i.e. tumors), epileptic disorder, stroke, and psychiatric disorder. Although no statistical analyses were performed, the authors stated that deafness was the most strongly related factor in musical hallucinations and that there was a female predominance, which could entail a genetic component.\n"}

Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden have all had successful domestic record industries for many years. Because the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were under Soviet control for much of the 20th century, when recording technology and popular music spread across the world, those three countries have a more tenuous connection with the popular industries of Finland, Sweden and the rest. However, since the fall of the Soviet Union, Western popular music in general has gained audiences in the Baltic states; this includes popular music from the other Nordic nations, as well as the United Kingdom, United States and elsewhere.\n\nThe Nordic metal scene is highly visible compared to other genres from the region. Many big names such as Opeth, Meshuggah, Children of Bodom and Amon Amarth hail from Nordic nations.

{"id": "27598579", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27598579", "title": "Tarrare", "text": "Tarrare\n\nTarrare (c. 1772 – 1798), sometimes spelled Tarare, was a French showman and soldier, noted for his unusual eating habits. Able to eat vast amounts of meat, he was constantly hungry; his parents could not provide for him, and he was turned out of the family home as a teenager. He travelled France in the company of a band of thieves and prostitutes, before becoming the warm-up act to a travelling charlatan; he would swallow corks, stones, live animals and a whole basketful of apples. He then took this act to Paris where he worked as a street performer.\n\nAt the start of the War of the First Coalition, Tarrare joined the French Revolutionary Army. With military rations unable to satisfy his large appetite, he would eat any available food from gutters and refuse heaps but his condition still deteriorated through hunger. He was hospitalised due to exhaustion and became the subject of a series of medical experiments to test his eating capacity, in which, among other things, he ate a meal intended for 15 people in a single sitting, ate live cats, snakes, lizards and puppies, and swallowed eels whole without chewing. Despite his unusual diet, he was of normal size and appearance, and showed no signs of mental illness other than what was described as an apathetic temperament.\n\nGeneral Alexandre de Beauharnais decided to put Tarrare's abilities to military use, and he was employed as a courier by the French army, with the intention that he would swallow documents, pass through enemy lines, and recover them from his stool once safely at his destination. Tarrare could not speak German, and on his first mission was captured by Prussian forces, severely beaten and underwent a mock execution before being returned to French lines.\n\nChastened by this experience, he agreed to submit to any procedure that would cure his appetite, and was treated with laudanum, tobacco pills, wine vinegar and soft-boiled eggs. The procedures failed, and doctors could not keep him on a controlled diet; he would sneak out of the hospital to scavenge for offal in gutters, rubbish heaps and outside butchers' shops, and attempted to drink the blood of other patients in the hospital and to eat the corpses in the hospital morgue. After being suspected of eating a toddler he was ejected from the hospital. He reappeared four years later in Versailles with a case of severe tuberculosis, and died shortly afterwards, following a lengthy bout of exudative diarrhoea.\n\nTarrare was born in rural France, near Lyon, around 1772. His date of birth is unrecorded and it is not even known if Tarrare was his real name or a nickname.\n\nAs a child, Tarrare had a huge appetite and by his teens could eat a quarter of a bullock, weighing as much as Tarrare himself, in a single day. By this time, his parents could not provide for him and had forced him to leave home. For some years after this, he toured the country with a roaming band of thieves and prostitutes, begging and stealing for food, before gaining employment as a warm-up act to a travelling charlatan. Tarrare would draw a crowd by eating corks, stones and live animals, and by swallowing an entire basketful of apples one after the other. He would eat ravenously and was particularly fond of snake meat.\n\nIn 1788, Tarrare moved to Paris to work as a street performer. He appears to have been successful in general, but on one occasion the act went wrong and he had severe intestinal obstruction. Members of the crowd carried him to the Hôtel-Dieu hospital, where he was treated with powerful laxatives. He made a full recovery and offered to demonstrate his act by eating his surgeon's watch and chain; M. Giraud, the surgeon, was unimpressed by the offer and warned him that if he did so, he would cut Tarrare open to recover the items.\n\nDespite his unusual diet, Tarrare was slim and of average height. At the age of 17, he weighed only (). He was described as having unusually soft fair hair and an abnormally wide mouth, in which his teeth were heavily stained and on which the lips were almost invisible. When he had not eaten, his skin would hang so loosely that he could wrap the fold of skin from his abdomen around his waist. When full, his abdomen would distend \"like a huge balloon\". The skin of his cheeks was wrinkled and hung loosely, and when stretched out, he could hold twelve eggs or apples in his mouth. \n\nHis body was hot to the touch and he sweated heavily, he constantly had foul body odour; he was described as stinking \"to such a degree that he could not be endured within the distance of twenty paces\". This smell would get noticeably worse after he had eaten; his eyes and cheeks would become bloodshot, a visible vapour would rise from his body, and he would become lethargic, during which time he would belch noisily and his jaws would make swallowing motions. He had chronic diarrhoea, which was said to be \"fetid beyond all conception\". Despite his large intake of food, he did not appear either to vomit excessively or to gain weight. Aside from his eating habits, his contemporaries saw no apparent signs of mental illness or unusual behaviour in him, other than an apparently apathetic temperament with \"a complete lack of force and ideas\".\n\nThe cause of Tarrare's behaviour is not known. While there are other documented cases of similar behaviour from the period, none of the subjects other than Tarrare were autopsied and there have been no modern documented cases resembling Tarrare. Hyperthyroidism can induce an extreme appetite, rapid weight loss, profuse sweating, heat intolerance, and fine hair. Bondeson (2006) speculates that Tarrare had a damaged amygdala; it is known that injuries to the amygdala in animals can induce polyphagia.\n\nOn the outbreak of the War of the First Coalition, Tarrare joined the French Revolutionary Army. Unfortunately for him, military rations were insufficient to satisfy his appetite. He would carry out tasks for other soldiers in return for a share of their rations and scavenge on the dungheap for scraps, but this was not enough to satisfy him. He was admitted to the military hospital at Soultz-Haut-Rhin with a case of extreme exhaustion. He was granted quadruple rations but remained hungry; he would scavenge for garbage in gutters and refuse containers, eat the scraps of food left by other patients, and creep into the apothecary's room to eat the poultices. Military surgeons could not understand his appetite; Tarrare was ordered to remain in the military hospital to take part in physiological experiments designed by Dr. Courville (surgeon to the 9th Hussar Regiment) and George Didier, Baron Percy, surgeon-in-chief of the hospital.\nCourville and Percy decided to test Tarrare's capacity for food. A meal had been prepared for 15 labourers near the hospital gates; although generally hospital staff restrained Tarrare in the presence of food, on this occasion Courville allowed him to reach the table undisturbed. Tarrare ate the entire meal of two large meat pies, plates of grease and salt and four gallons of milk, and then immediately fell asleep; Courville noted that Tarrare's belly became taut and inflated like a large balloon. On another occasion Tarrare was presented with a live cat. He tore the cat's abdomen open with his teeth and drank its blood, and proceeded to eat the entire cat aside from its bones, before vomiting up its fur and skin. Following this, hospital staff offered Tarrare a variety of other animals including snakes, lizards and puppies, all of which were eaten; he also swallowed an entire eel without chewing, having first crushed its head with his teeth.\n\nAfter several months he spent as an experimental case, military authorities began to press for Tarrare to be returned to active duty. Dr. Courville was keen to continue his investigations into Tarrare's eating habits and digestive system, and approached General Alexandre de Beauharnais with a suggestion that Tarrare's unusual abilities and behaviour could be put to military use. A document was placed inside a wooden box which was in turn fed to Tarrare. Two days later, the box was retrieved from his excrement, with the document still in legible condition. Courville proposed to de Beauharnais that Tarrare could thus serve as a military courier, carrying documents securely through enemy territory with no risk of their being found if he were searched.\n\nTarrare was called on by Beauharnais to demonstrate his abilities before a gathering of the commanders of the Army of the Rhine. Having swallowed the box successfully, Tarrare was given a wheelbarrow filled with of raw bull's lungs and liver as a reward, which he immediately ate in front of the assembled generals.\n\nFollowing this successful demonstration, Tarrare became employed officially as a spy of the Army of the Rhine. Although General de Beauharnais was convinced of Tarrare's physical capacity to carry messages internally, he was concerned about his mental state and reluctant to entrust him initially with significant military documents. Tarrare was ordered as his first assignment to carry a message to a French colonel imprisoned by the Prussians near Neustadt; he was told that the documents were of great military significance, but in reality de Beauharnais had merely written a note asking the colonel to confirm that the message had been received successfully, and if so to return a reply of any potentially useful information about Prussian troop movements.\n\nTarrare crossed Prussian lines under cover of darkness, disguised as a German peasant. Unable to speak German, he soon attracted the attention of local residents, who alerted the Prussian authorities, and he was captured outside Landau. A strip search found nothing suspicious on his person, and despite being whipped by Prussian soldiers, he refused to betray his mission. Brought before the local Prussian commander, General Zoegli, he again refused to talk and was imprisoned. After 24 hours of captivity, Tarrare relented and explained the scheme to his captors. He was chained to a latrine, and eventually, 30 hours after being swallowed, the wooden box emerged. Zoegli was furious when the documents, which Tarrare had said contained vital intelligence, transpired only to be de Beauharnais's dummy message, and Tarrare was taken to a gallows and the noose placed around his neck. (Some sources state that Zoegli never retrieved the box, as Tarrare had the presence of mind to recover and eat the stool containing it before it could be seized by the Prussians.) At the last minute, Zoegli relented, and Tarrare was taken down from the scaffold, given a severe beating, and released near the French lines.\n\nFollowing this incident, Tarrare was desperate to avoid further military service, and returned to the hospital, telling Percy that he would attempt any possible cure for his appetite. Percy treated him with laudanum without success; further treatments with wine vinegar and tobacco pills were likewise unsuccessful. Following these failures, Percy fed Tarrare large quantities of soft-boiled eggs, but this also failed to suppress his appetite. Efforts to keep him on any kind of controlled diet failed; he would sneak out of the hospital to scavenge for offal outside butchers' shops and to fight stray dogs for carrion in gutters, alleys and rubbish heaps. He was also caught several times within the hospital drinking from patients undergoing bloodletting, and attempting to eat the bodies in the hospital mortuary. Other doctors believed that Tarrare was mentally ill and pressed for him to be transferred to a lunatic asylum, but Percy was keen to continue his experiments and Tarrare remained in the military hospital.\n\nAfter some time, a 14-month-old child disappeared from the hospital, and Tarrare was immediately suspected. Percy was unable or unwilling to defend him, and the hospital staff chased Tarrare from the hospital, to which he never returned.\n\nFour years later, in 1798, a M. Tessier of Versailles hospital contacted Percy to notify him that a patient of theirs wished to see him. It was Tarrare, now bedridden and weak. Tarrare told Percy that he had swallowed a golden fork two years earlier, which he believed was lodged inside him and causing his current weakness. He hoped that Percy could find some way to remove it. Percy, however, recognised that he had advanced tuberculosis. A month later, Tarrare began to experience continuous exudative diarrhoea, dying shortly afterwards.\n\nThe corpse rotted quickly; the surgeons of the hospital refused to dissect it. Tessier, however, wanted to find out how Tarrare differed from the norm internally, and was also curious as to whether the gold fork was actually lodged inside him. At the autopsy, Tarrare's gullet was found to be abnormally wide and when his jaws were opened, surgeons could see down a broad canal into the stomach. His body was found to be filled with pus, his liver and gallbladder were abnormally large, and his stomach was enormous, covered in ulcers and filling most of his abdominal cavity.\n\nThe fork was never found.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\nBibliography\n\n"}

The game also contains parodies or homages to works by Hayao Miyazaki and Buster Keaton. The game also uses a movie-like effect where upcoming in-game events are previewed in the game's background.\n\nThe game takes place during the 1930s in an unspecified European country. Research on a secret weapon of mass destruction was being conducted in this country under the leadership of a fearsome army general, the \"Dark Ogre\", but an elderly scientist decides to escape after learning that he was being manipulated by the general. The scientist gives the key piece of his research, a prism stone, to his granddaughter \"Charlotte\" as he escapes, and the general pursues the prism with the full force of his army. Charlotte takes refuge in the home of \"Edward Randy\", a teenage boy who was preparing for his first date in half a year with his girlfriend, \"Jennifer\", while Edward suddenly finds himself in the midst of a huge adventure involving a dangerous plan to destroy the world.\n\nThe player controls the main character using an 8-way joystick and 2 buttons, one for attacking and one for jumping. The main character attacks using a whip, and he can attack in 8 different directions depending on the direction pressed on the joystick. He can also slide on the ground when the jump button is pressed while the joystick is pressed to the side or diagonally downwards. Pressing the joystick diagonally upwards causes the character to run quickly, and pressing down on the joystick while the character is in the air allows him to stomp on enemies on the ground. The character can also do a spin-attack by looping their whip on other objects and holding left or right on the joystick. The character is invincible while they are spinning, but can only spin 4 times per attack.\n\nThe game is completed when the player finishes all 7 levels, and up to 2 players can play together at a time. There are no lives in the game, and the main character's remaining health is directly linked to the number of points gained by the player on each level. The player can revive the main character's health by killing more enemies, and they lose points along with health when they are hit by enemy attacks. The player is taken to the game over screen when their points (health) reaches 0. Therefore, the high score is calculated as the highest number of points the player had at any point in the game rather than the number of points they have at the end of the game.\n\nThe game's story-line is explained in demo screens that appear in-between levels. The level's subtitle is displayed before the start of each level.\n"}

Sestero details the troubled development and production of the 2003 cult film \"The Room,\" his own struggles as a young actor, and his relationship with \"Room\" director Tommy Wiseau.\n\nIn December 2017, a film adaptation of the same name was released, directed and produced by and starring James Franco as Wiseau, with his brother and co-producer Dave Franco in the role of Sestero.\n\nSestero, an aspiring actor struggling with confidence, first encounters Wiseau in an acting class. Sestero is at first perplexed by Wiseau's over-the-top acting technique, his unusual physical appearance, his unidentifiable accent and his eccentric behavior, which includes a fascination with all things American and a refusal to discuss his past. At the same time, Sestero admires Wiseau's boldness and his genuine enthusiasm for both life and acting. The two form an odd but affectionate bond as Sestero begins to learn of the many contradictions of Wiseau's personality.\n\nAs Sestero slowly accrues more acting credits and makes other friends, Wiseau grows jealous and schemes to earn similar acknowledgement (such as earning a SAG card by producing and starring in a commercial for a company he himself owned), leading Sestero to become uncomfortable with their relationship. After viewing \"The Talented Mr. Ripley\" for the first time, Sestero is struck by how similar Wiseau is to the title character and convinces him to see the film. However, instead of recognizing his own behavior, Wiseau is deeply impressed by the performance and becomes obsessed with creating a movie just as emotionally powerful. The result is the screenplay for \"The Room\", which includes a character, Mark, named after actor Matt Damon (whose name Wiseau had misheard).\n\nBacked by a seemingly endless, mysterious supply of money, Wiseau develops, produces, directs and stars in \"The Room\", despite having no knowledge of filmmaking. On-set relationships are a disaster: the story itself is nonsensical and full of plot threads that are never addressed or resolved (a matter complicated by Wiseau refusing to give anyone a full copy of the script); Wiseau's camera set-up requires two full crews to operate, actors and crew storm off the set, scripts are rewritten in the middle of scenes, sets are broken down only to be rebuilt and re-shot the following day, and at the last possible moment, Wiseau convinces Sestero to join the crew as one of the principal actors, in spite of the role already having been cast. By the end of shooting, the cast and crew, convinced that the film will never be seen, lose their enthusiasm, resulting in lackluster performances and technical blunders that are never corrected.\n\nSestero screens a rough cut of the film for his friends and family, who are enthralled by its bizarre ineptitude. Their reaction turns out to be prophetic when, eight months later, Wiseau secures a release for the film, beginning its cult reputation as \"the \"Citizen Kane\" of bad movies\". The book ends with Sestero's meditation on the power—and danger—of unconditional belief in one's dreams.\n\nA film adaptation of the same name, directed and co-produced by and starring James Franco as Wiseau and Dave Franco as Sestero, premiered at South by Southwest on March 12, 2017, and was released in the United States on December 1, 2017.\n\nIn May 2014, an audiobook version of \"The Disaster Artist\" was released by Tantor Audio, with Sestero reading the story. Sestero's impression of Wiseau in the audiobook has received praise from critics, including \"The Huffington Post\" and Publishers Weekly.\n\n\"The Disaster Artist\" audiobook was named a finalist for the 2015 Audie Awards for Best Humor Audiobook.\n\nIn March 2014, \"The Disaster Artist\" (Audiobook) won for \"Favorite Non-Fiction Book of 2013\" at Bookish.\n\nOn November 23, 2014, \"The Disaster Artist\" won for Best Non-Fiction at the National Arts & Entertainment Journalism Awards ceremony in Los Angeles. The judges praised the book, stating \"\"The Disaster Artist\" is not only a hell of a good read, it will make a great film if ever adapted. It's equal parts \"Ed Wood\", \"American Hustle\" and demented \"Citizen Kane\"—with a dash of Monty Python thrown into the mix\".\n\nOn February 11, 2015, \"The Disaster Artist\" (Audiobook) was nominated for Best Humor Audiobook at the Audie Awards, and was narrated by author Greg Sestero. The awards ceremony was held May 28, 2015 in New York City.\n\nOn January 23, 2018 \"The Disaster Artist\" was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay at the 90th Oscars.\n\n"}

{"id": "665543", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=665543", "title": "Zip-line", "text": "Zip-line\n\nA zip-line (or zip line, zipline, Sypline, zip wire, aerial runway, aerial ropeslide, death slide, flying fox, or, in South Africa, foefie slide) consists of a pulley suspended on a cable, usually made of stainless steel, mounted on a slope. It is designed to enable a user propelled by gravity to travel from the top to the bottom of the inclined cable by holding on to, or attaching to, the freely moving pulley. Zip-lines come in many forms, most often used as a means of entertainment. They may be short and low, intended for child's play and found on some playgrounds. Longer and higher rides are often used as a means of accessing remote areas, such as a rainforest canopy. Zip line tours are becoming popular vacation activities, which are found at outdoor adventure camps or upscale resorts, where they may be an element on a larger challenge or ropes course. The jungles of Costa Rica, Florida, Puerto Vallarta, and Nicaragua are popular destinations for zip line enthusiasts.\n\nThe zip-wire has been used as a transportation method in some mountainous countries for many years. In some remote areas in China such as Nujiang (Salween) valley in Yunnan, zip lines served the purposes of bridges across rivers, but due to a poor safety record, they have mostly been replaced by real bridges by 2015. Referred to as \"an inclined strong\", one appears in \"The Invisible Man\" by H. G. Wells, published in 1897, as part of a Whit-Monday fair.\n\nIn 1739, Robert Cadman, a steeplejack and ropeslider, died when descending from Shrewsbury's St Mary’s Church when his rope snapped.\n\nAlberto Santos-Dumont used a direct ancestor of the zip-line in spring 1906 for a method of testing various characteristics of his Santos-Dumont 14-bis pioneer era canard biplane, before it ever flew under its own power later that year.\n\nIn the Australian outback, zip-lines were occasionally used for delivering food, cigarettes or tools to people working on the other side of an obstacle such as a gully or river. Australian troops have used them to deliver food, mail and even ammunition to forward positions in several conflicts.\n\nThe term \"flying fox\" is most commonly used in reference to a small-scale zip line typically used as an item of children's play equipment, except in Australia and New Zealand where it also refers to professional forms of zip-line equipment.\n\nWith the flying fox, the pulley(s), attached to the car, are fixed to the cable. The car itself can consist of anything from a simple hand grip, with the user hanging underneath, to a bucket for transporting small items, to a quite elaborate construction, perhaps including a seat or a safety strap. Children's versions are usually not set up with a steep incline, so the speeds are kept relatively low, negating the need for a means of stopping.\n\nTo be propelled by gravity, the cable needs to be on a fairly steep slope. Even then the car will generally not travel completely to the end (although this will depend on the load), and some means of safely stopping the car at the bottom end is sometimes needed. It can be returned by several means, either by simply pushing the car back to the top of the hill on foot (as is common in children's play equipment as they do not hang far from the ground) or a line leading from the car to the uphill end.\n\nThe flying fox is usually made with rope instead of steel cable to make it easier and cheaper to install, uninstall and transport. Riders on the Flying Fox need safety harness to get support on the zip line.\n\nProfessional versions of a zip-line are most typically used as an outdoor adventure activity. In contrast to \"flying foxes\" professional courses are usually operated at higher speeds, covering much longer distances and sometimes at considerable heights. The users are physically attached to the cable by a harness that attaches to a removable trolley. A helmet is required on almost all courses of any size.\n\nCables can be very high, starting at a height of over , and traveling well over . All zip-line cables have some degree of sag. The proper tensioning of a cable is important and allows the ability to tune the ride of a zip line.\n\nZip lines are a common way to return participants to the ground at the end of a ropes adventure course.\n\nUsers of zip-lines must have means of stopping themselves. Typical mechanisms include:\n\nWith proper knowledge and training on the part of the operators, along with good maintenance, zip lines are generally safe and easy to use. In 2012 there were an estimated 200 commercial zip lines in the US and a further 13,000 private ones resulting in 3,600 visits to the emergency room.\n\nThe world's longest zip-line as of January 2018 is the 2.8 kilometer 'Jebel Jais Flight' at Jebel Jais in Ras Al Khaimah, United Arab Emirates.\n\n\"Parque de Aventura Barrancas del Cobre\" at 2545 m (8,350 ft) in Copper Canyon, Mexico was once the longest.\n\nIn 2012, ZipFlyer Nepal (HighGround Adventures) was the world's steepest with max incline of 56%, is currently second in the world and is still the tallest zip line. It had a vertical drop of .\n\nOn 19 September 2015 the world's steepest zipline was opened at Letalnica bratov Gorišek, on the ski flying hill in Planica, Slovenia. It is long with a vertical drop. It has an average 38.33% and a maximum 58.6% incline. The longest zipline in Europe, at just over 1600 meters long, is the Zip World Bethesda line in Penryn Quarry, Bethesda, Wales. The Zip World Bethesda line also holds the record for being the fastest Zip-Line in the world. \n\nThe longest zipline in England is the Skywire at the Eden Project in Cornwall measuring 660 meters (2,165 ft).\n\nThe zip-line trolley is the frame or assembly together with the pulley(s) also known as sheave(s) inside that run along the cable. (The term \"trolley\" is more often used when this assembly consists of more than a single pulley with simple hanger and bearing.) Often more than one pulley is used to spread the load over more than one spot on the cable, to reduce cable bending stresses that may lead to metal fatigue and cable breakage. This also reduces any tendency of a pulley to twist sideways and run off the cable, with disastrous results. In addition, the trolley is usually shaped with guards to hold the cable in the groove(s) of the pulley(s).\n\nA pivoting link, such as a carabiner, is used to secure the load to the trolley so that the trolley does not have a tendency to rock and thus fall off the cable if the load should sway. Load carriers ranging from enclosed cabins to gondolas to harnesses are attached to the link. Occasionally the load carrier is just a handhold or handlebar, although there is the danger of the rider losing his grip and falling. Such a simple carrier should be used only on zip lines that are near the ground or over water. The rider losing his grip due to the use of the simple carrier has led to a number of deaths.\n\nYungas, Bolivia, features a system of zip lines used for transporting harvested crops.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18322776", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18322776", "title": "Zorns Lemma (film)", "text": "Zorns Lemma (film)\n\nZorns Lemma is a 1970 American structural experimental film by Hollis Frampton. Originally starting as a series of photographs, the non-narrative film is structured around a 24-letter Latin alphabet. It remains, along with Michael Snow's \"Wavelength\" and Tony Conrad's \"The Flicker\", one of the best known examples of structural filmmaking.\n\nThe opening section of \"Zorns Lemma\" is 5 minutes long. In it a woman reads an abecedary of 24 couplets from \"The Bay State Primer\", an eighteenth century book designed to teach children the alphabet. The film is entirely black during this section.\nThe film's main section is silent and lasts 45 minutes, broken into 2,700 one-second units. It shows the viewer an evolving 24-part \"alphabet\". The section begins by presenting each letter typed on a sheet of tin foil. The alphabet is initially composed of words that appear on street signs, photographed in Manhattan. As the film continues to cycle through the alphabet, individual letters are slowly substituted with images. The first four substitutions—fire (\"x\"), waves (\"z\"), smoke (\"q\"), and reeds (\"y\")–depict the four classical elements.\n\nThe film's conclusion lasts 10 minutes. It shows a man, woman and dog walking through snow. During this scene, six women's voices alternate in reading the words of a passage from \"On Light, or the Ingression of Forms\" by Robert Grosseteste. The voices read at a rate of one word per second.\n\n\"Zorns Lemma\" emerged from \"Word Pictures\", a photography project that Frampton made from 1962 to 1963. For \"Word Pictures\", Frampton shot over 2000 black-and-white 35mm photographs of environmental words, seeking to explore the illusions of photography as a medium. However, he had difficulty devising a form in which to present the photographs. During this period, Frampton became less active as a photographer and first started to experiment with filmmaking. He started to make a film by shooting the photographs on a stand but thought the result looked \"dead\", deciding that he should film the words in color. He began filming static shots of words, carefully framing them with the use of a tripod.\n\nFrampton thought that imposing his own order on the film would make it too similar to a poem, so he decided to use alphabetical order and avoid any conscious connections between words. Because the number of times he had captured each letter varied greatly, he decided to use the \"double alphabet\" and continuously cycle through the letters. This structure left \"holes\" to be filled in the film. Frampton decided to gradually substitute out the letters for images, originally planning to use entirely different images each time. Frampton's production notes outline three criteria for selecting the images used. He preferred banal images, with the exception of animals included for \"shock value\". He preferred \"sculptural\" images showing work or the \"illusion of space or substance\". These included painting a wall (\"k\") and changing a tire (\"t\"). Frampton worked in \"cinematic or para-cinematic reference\", often subtly so. The letter \"d\" is substituted with cookie dough being sliced with a star-shaped cookie cutter, as a cinematic reference to film \"stars\". Modular actions—such as a child swinging (\"l\") or assembling Tinkertoys (\"r\")—serve as para-cinematic references to modular time. Frampton set the length of each shot to be one second, or 24 frames. However, 24 of the shots have slight irregularities in their lengths. Frampton instructed key grip David Hamilton that 12 shots should have 23 frames and 12 shots should have 25 frames.\n\nThe final section of \"Zorns Lemma\" was shot in 1970. Frampton envisioned it as a time for the audience \"to empty the mind\". When loading and unloading the film rolls, he intentionally exposed them to sunlight and created reel-end flares to emphasize \"the materiality of film\".\n\nFrampton's films are often titled after specialized scientific disciplines, as in the case of \"Maxwell's Demon\", \"Prince Rupert's Drops\", and \"Hapax Legomena\". In the early 1960s minimalist artist Carl Andre described to Frampton the Dedekind cut, which partitions a totally ordered set into a set with no maximal element and a set with no minimal element. He became interested in the relationship between set theory and film while working on his ongoing project \"Magellan\". Frampton titled \"Zorns Lemma\" after Zorn's lemma (also known as the Kuratowski–Zorn lemma), a proposition of set theory formulated by mathematician Max Zorn in 1935. Zorn's lemma describes partially ordered sets where every totally ordered subset has an upper bound. The letters and images in \"Zorns Lemma\" are sets whose order is discovered during the course of the film.\n\n\"Zorns Lemma\" premiered at the Philharmonic Hall for the 1970 New York Film Festival. It was the first experimental feature film to be screened there. J. Hoberman wrote that it \"drove the audience mad\", and Howard Thompson observed that \"never, at least so far during the Film Festival, have so many Philharmonic Hall viewers slithered outside for a cigarette.\" Nevertheless, the sale of \"Zorns Lemma\" was a financial success for Frampton. \n\nAmos Vogel called \"Zorns Lemma\" a \"radical example of reductive cinema\" that warned of \"things to come ... 'meaning' (political, psychological, personal, or whatever) has been eliminated and the work exists purely for itself, demanding attention to structure, pattern, and orchestration.\" Kevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\" described the film as \"a thoroughly demanding but highly stimulating exercise in heightening our awareness of the possibilities of visual perception and, indeed, the ways in which we create meaning itself\". The experimental filmmaker Ernie Gehr stated, \"\"Zorns Lemma\" is a major poetic work. Created and put together by a very clear eye, this original and complex abstract work moves beyond the letters of the alphabet, beyond words and beyond Freud.\"\n\nCritics have interpreted Stan Brakhage's 1972 film \"The Riddle of Lumen\" as a response to \"Zorns Lemma\". Director Peter Greenaway has cited the film as an influence on his work, based on its illustration of how to \"structure a film without necessarily using narrative\". Greenaway's 1973 short film \"H Is for House\" presents long lists of words beginning with the letter \"h\", and his later feature films \"The Draughtsman's Contract\" and \"A Zed & Two Noughts\" feature children reciting abecedaries. Su Friedrich adapted the structure of \"Zorns Lemma\" for her 1990 film \"Sink or Swim\". Originally intending to represent each letter of the alphabet with multiple words, Friedrich ultimately used a 26-segment structure that moves in reverse alphabetical order.\n\n\"Zorns Lemma\" received three critics' votes in the 2012 \"Sight & Sound\" polls of the world's greatest films.\n\n\n"}
