According to \"The Times of India\", the director of the film failed as a storyteller and the film was \"a bland Jurassic adventure\".\n\nProfessor Neelakantan (J. Livingston) is an maverick Indian scientist and inventor who develops and constructs a time machine, and begins experimenting with it. He realises that his machine requires a recognised \"object\" to work, and he therefore seeks to locate such an object that can be transported in time through his machine. He jokingly tells his pet dog that he would use it as the \"object\".\n\nVarsha (Sreelakhsmy N. Nair) and Vikas (Prithvi) are Neelakantan's mischievous granddaughter and grandson who live with their parents and are very fond of the grandfather. While on a visit, the two children enter Neelakantan's laboratory in his absence and start playing with the dog. Varsha throws a ball that strikes the time machine's control screen and accidentally turns on the device, which recognises Varsha and Vikas as transferable \"objects\". Neelakantan enters the room and is shocked to see the machine's condition, but it is too late. As he tries to save the kids, he too is recognised as an \"object\" by the machine, and his grandchildren and he are accidentally transported to the age of dinosaurs.\n\nIn the prehistoric world Neelakantan and his grandchildren encounter animals that are now extinct, including several species of dangerous dinosaurs. At first they are afraid and struggle to understand what to do. But, gradually they try to be friends with a dinosaurs.

Before its release, Shakthi Scott promised \"surprise elements\" in the film. Upon release, \"Adhisaya Ulagam 3D\" received negative reviews from critics. \"The Times of India\" gave the film one out of five stars, and called it \"a bland Jurassic adventure\". They described the film plot as a mix of those from \"Back to the Future\" and \"Jurassic Park\" and found story-telling and the graphic works unimpressive. They wrote, \"But when even the five-year-old kids in the theatre get restless, it is a clear sign that the filmmaker has failed as a storyteller.\"\n\n\"NowRunning\" criticised the director's film-making, and the movie's story line and graphics. They found the works of the VFX artists \"amateurish\" and wrote that the film \"looks like an unfinished product.\" Overall, they rated the film \"Poor\" and gave it half out of five stars,\n\nShakthi Scott participated in a short film making contest conducted by \"Star World\" and \"Steven Spielberg\" in the year 2007. \"On the Lot\" was a single season reality show and online competition for filmmaking, produced by Steven Spielberg, Mark Burnett and David Goffin. Shakthi Scott was selected among 12000 entries and was the only person to be selected from Asia.\n\nThe film had a poor opening at the box office and was a commercial flop. According to Behindwoods, in its Chennai theatrical run from 6 to 12 August 2012, the film collected only and had only 10% theatre occupancy on weekdays.\n\n"}

It follows Anthea, a 25-year-old girl who hates her job and has to sit back and watch as all her friends move away from her hometown, Brisbane, to make a better life. In 2013, \"The Guardian\" referred to it as a \"cult film\" inspired by \"a typically Brisbane lament... the departure of people in their late 20s to Sydney, Melbourne, London or New York.\"\n\nAnthea (Charlotte Gregg) is undergoing a crisis of confidence: overworked, no boyfriend, and now all her friends are leaving Brisbane. She is tempted to leave herself, but is opposed by her longtime best platonic male friend Michael (Matt Zeremes).\n\nMichael thinks people who leave Brisbane are copycats who follow the crowd; he is quite happy to stay in Brisbane, he is in a stable job and a stable very low-maintenance \"sex-with-the-ex\" relationship with his ex-girlfriend, Stephanie (Sarah Kennedy). In short, he is in a rut.\n\nAnthea's temptation to leave Brisbane increases with the impending departure of her flatmate Kath (Cindy Nelson). However, she then hears that her ex-boyfriend Jake (Gyton Grantley) is coming back to Brisbane to live. To Michael's annoyance, she dreams of a great future with him.\n\nMichael is then thrown out of his comfort zone by starting a new relationship with a girl he meets at work; Simone (Romany Lee). Slightly \"alternative\" and good natured, Simone is totally different from the sorts of girls he normally deals with, and he finds himself in a relationship over which he does not have total control.\n\nOn her last day in Australia, Anthea and Michael finally resolve their feelings for each other.\n\n\nOriginally, \"All My Friends are Leaving Brisbane\" was a stage performance at the University of Queensland's Cement Box Theatre, where director Louise Alston first saw it. She could see that the story would make an ideal feature film and worked with writer Stephen Vagg on developing a script.\n\nProducer Jade van der Lei then became interested in the film and was able to raise a budget of .

{"id": "351172", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=351172", "title": "BMX XXX", "text": "BMX XXX\n\nBMX XXX is a sports video game developed by Z-Axis and published by Acclaim Entertainment under their AKA Acclaim label for the Xbox, PlayStation 2 and GameCube. While primarily a BMX-based action sports title, it earned most of its notoriety for containing nudity, foul language and adult humor. The game allows the player to create female characters that are fully topless and view live-action video clips of real life strippers, also with bare breasts. Consequently, \"BMX XXX\" was initially denied classification in Australia. In North America, while the game is available uncensored on the GameCube and Xbox, all naked breasts are covered in the PlayStation 2 version. While the adult content garnered a great deal of publicity for the game, it was almost entirely negative, and it was eventually released to mediocre reviews and poor sales.\n\n\"BMX XXX\" builds on the earlier work done by Z-Axis on \"Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX\", their previous BMX title featuring and endorsed by professional BMX rider Dave Mirra. During development of the new game, publisher Acclaim Entertainment decided to style the game after a raunchy sex comedy movie. It is commonly believed that the origins of this decision came when Acclaim saw what was shaping up to be an extremely subpar game, and so, in an effort to salvage the time and money already invested in it, they decided to add the vulgar humor and naked women in an effort to muster up publicity and hopefully turn that into sales. When Mirra found out about the content in the game, he refused to endorse the product and took legal action against publisher Acclaim in order to prevent any further implication of his involvement in the game. Mirra was successful in getting the courts to block Acclaim from using his name in association with the game, and the title was then shortened to its final name, \"BMX XXX\".\n\nThe game received \"mixed\" reviews on all platforms according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.\n\nAt the time of \"BMX XXX\"'s release, sexual humor and nudity were not widely explored themes in mainstream video games. As a result, Acclaim's attempt to drum up publicity for the game was a rousing success, although the publicity achieved was not positive. Television news outlets reported that Wal-Mart, Toys R Us and most major IEMA retailers in the United States declined to carry the game in their stores due to the nudity. Then, Sony Computer Entertainment of America refused to allow the game to be published for the PlayStation 2 until the nudity was censored. In the end, sales were abysmal: under 100,000 copies were sold across all three platforms. The game was not greeted with controversy in Europe, but it was not met with sales success either. In Australia, it was sold with the sexual content removed entirely. \"BMX XXX\", along with several other poorly performing titles, contributed to Acclaim Entertainment filing for bankruptcy in 2004.\n\n"}
{"id": "50427147", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50427147", "title": "Bahuk", "text": "Bahuk\n\nBahuk () is a Gujarati long narrative poem by Chinu Modi. The poem is composed both in metrical and non-metrical verse and centres on Nala, a character from the \"Mahabharata\" who metamorphosed into Bahuka. It is an acclaimed poem of Gujarati literature written in Sanskrit-styled figurative language. The poem was selected for the Ushnas Prize (1982–83) by the Gujarati Sahitya Parishad.\n\nChinu Modi began writing Bahuk in 1971. He suspended work between 1979 and 1981, on receiving a creative fellowship from the Department of Culture in Delhi, before going on to complete the poem in October 1982. Bahuk was published in book form in January 1983 by Adarsh Publication, Ahmedabad, and reprinted in 1999. A third edition, including critical articles, was published in October 2014.\n\n\nDuring his exile, Pandava king Yudhishthira asked Brihadashwa, \"Is there any other emperor in this wood who is unfortunate as me?\". At that time, Brihadashwa consoled him by narrating the story of Nala and Damayanti. In China Modi's poem, the sage Brihadashwa comes into his own as an independent character and observer.\n\nThe subject of the poem is the story of Nala and Damayanti from chapter 27 chapter of the \"Vana Parva\", third \"parva\" (book) of the \"Mahabharata\". The poem's central theme is the psyche and subtle emotions of Nala, and of his wife Damayanti. After losing his empire to his brother Pushkara in a bet, Nala spends three days and nights outside his city, Nishadnagar, with Damayanti, before going into the forest. Cut off from his city, Nala feels extreme loneliness. The poem depicts the dissolution of his personality during these three days and nights.\n\nThe poem is divided into three \"sarga\" (cantos). The first contains 15 chapters, the second 13 chapters, and the third 22 chapters. The three characters do not communicate with each other but speak in independent monologues.\n\nThe chronological order of narrator monologues is as follows:\n\n\nThe first and second sargas are composed in non-metrical verse. The third is composed in accordance with the rules of \"Sanskrit-vritta\" (Sanskrit prosody) and \"Matra-vritta\", including \"Prithvi\", \"Vasantatilka\", \"Mandakranta\", \"Shikhrini\", \"Chopai\" and \"Katav\". The poem is structured using Sanskrit-styled and figurative language. The narrative comprises long monologues from the three characters, Nala, Damayanti, and Brihadashwa. Brihadashwa and Damayanti's monologues centre alternately on Nala and his psyche, reflecting the affection they hold for Nala. The poet reinterprets the two accounts in the original story, \"Karkotaka dankh\" (\"The sting of Karkotaka\") and \"Matsya Sajivan Prasang\". In the original story, a bite from the snake Karkotaka transforms Nala into Bahuka. In the poem, Chinu Modi describes Nala's metamorphosis into Bahuka as being caused by natural phenomena.\n\nThe first \"sarga\" (canto) begins with three visions of Brihadashwa: the arrival of victorious Pushkara in the town Nishadanagar; the citizens' fear at his arrival; and victorious Pushkara's emotions and Nala's numbness. There follows a description of Nala's despair at being cut off from his city. The \"sarga\" concludes with Damayanti's thoughts and feelings on Nala's situation.\n\nThe second \"sarga\" begins with Brihadashwa's address to the \"Vrukharaj\" (a banyan tree) and some other elements of nature at the border of Nishadanagar concerning Nala's mental state. Nala's monologue follows, reflecting his stillness, his passivity and lifelessness, and his growing consciousness of these things. Finally, Damayanti's monologue reveals her own state of mind in certain lines, with the remainder concerning Nala. Damayanti addresses Nala, attempting to rouse him from his numbed state. The entire monologue uses the technique of Indication.\n\nThe third \"sarga\" begins with Damayanti’s monologue describing Nala’s mental state through the symbol of the banyan tree \"Vruksharaj\" and other elements of nature. Damayanti attempts to convince Nala to accept his new situation. Brihadashva’s monologue follows, describing Nala's situation using natural imagery such as darkness and the forest. At the beginning of the final monologue, by Nala, Nala finds a golden, fleshy bird. Hungry, he finds the bird fit to eat. This is the point ay which his transformation into Bahuka commences. He makes a snare out of his only cloth to catch the bird, but it flies away carrying the cloth. Nala is left naked and feels his individuality dissolving, with a deep sense of grief. Finally, Nala turns into Bahuka, not as a result of the snake Karkotaka's bite as in the original story in the \"Mahabharata\", but through the sting of loneliness. He leaves Damayanti and wanders away into the forest. The episode that begins with Nala’s desire to kill the bird closes with Nala leaving Damayanti, revealing his uglier side. The Nala of the poem is written as a displaced person.\n\nThe book was awarded the Ushnas Prize (1982–83) by the Gujarati Sahitya Parishad (Gujarati Literary Council).\n\nThe poem has been critically acclaimed by several Gujarati authors. Harivallabh Bhayani noted that Chinu Modi has broken new ground in modern Gujarati long narrative poetry (Khandakavya) with his attempts at narrative poems. Chandrakant Topiwala noted, \"In Gujarati literature, poets like Ravji Patel, and Raghuvir Chaudhari have written poem on separation from village when they moved from village to city. But here for the first time, Chinu Modi has grabbed the opportunity to writing on separation from the city as the lead character is separated from the city and moving to woods\". In this, he has described the pain of personal separation in a modern context. However, in one article Pramodkumar Patel questioned the psychological role and the truthfulness and authenticity of the emotions of the character Damayanti. He noted that Damayanti's behavior runs counter to reality in some instances in the poem.\n\nChinu Modi adapted the poem as two-act Gujarati play in 1991. In the production, Himanshu Trivedi played the role of Nala and Asma Dalal played Damayanti. The poem was translated into Hindi by Kavita Sharma 'Jadli' in 2017.\n"}

It is focused on developing, producing and distributing horror themed digital content, with an emphasis on monsters and recurring characters in linked universes.\n\nBest known for viral characters such as the Birch and the Look-See, Crypt specializes in short-form horror videos made for the internet. The company has garnered a combined social media following of 5 million likes on Facebook and more than 1 million subscribers on YouTube.\n\nIn 2017, Crypt's short films were featured as a keynote presentation at Tribeca Film Festival through \"Crypt TV's Monster Madness\". That same year, Crypt won a Streamy Award in the Action or Sci-Fi category as well as a Webby Award for Best Drama: Individual Short for its production of \"The Birch.\"\n\nJack Davis, who was still attending Duke University at the time, met Eli Roth at a dinner party in 2013. The pair kept in touch, discussing how to make scary entertainment effective on phone screens. Crypt TV was formed when Davis and Roth launched a \"six-second scare\" contest together in October 2014, as \"a way to test to see if you could really make great scary content in short form on mobile,” according to Davis. The contest was featured on Good Morning America and subsequently went viral, receiving over 15,000 submissions. Roth showed the contest to Jason Blum, who was looking for a digital strategy for Blumhouse Productions, and Blum became Crypt's first investor. The company was officially launched in April 2015 in Los Angeles with just three employees: Davis, Darren Brandl as Chief Operating Officer, and Kate Krantz as Chief Content Officer.\n\nIn March 2017, Crypt TV raised $3.5 million in funding, led by venture capital fund Lerer Hippeau Ventures, a backer of Buzzfeed. The company has raised $6.2 million from past investors.\n\nCrypt releases about 100 videos every three months, building its audience through Facebook and YouTube and averaging more than 100 million online views a month. Using real-time reactions on social media to test characters and concepts, the most well-received characters are inducted into Crypt's \"monster universe,\" who then form the basis for as many as 15 videos in a quarter. Giggles the Clown, The Look-See, and Sunny Family Cult are among the most popular series developed this way.\n\nCrypt's viral characters expand beyond traditional narrative videos; Giggles the Clown does live streaming interviews with fans, engaging on social media as a typical influencer would, and she has appeared as an attraction at Knott's Scary Farm. Crypt also has a merchandising deal with Spencer's Gifts, which sells merchandise for Giggles, the Birch, and Sunny Family Cult.\n\n\"The Birch\" is a short film about a sentient tree who protects a kid from bullies, produced by Crypt TV in 2016. The short was written and directed by Anthony Melton and Ben Franklin, and The Birch creature design was created by special effects artist, Cliff Wallace. The film went viral, winning a Webby award in 2017. The Birch will be expanded and developed into a full-fledged Crypt universe character.\n\n\"Ghosted\" was an eight-episode, long-form digital series distributed by Verizon's go90 streaming video platform, hosted by actress and cosplayer LeeAnna Vamp. In the show, Vamp traveled to different haunted locations in the southern United States and interacted with local ghost hunting communities, as well as exploring local foods, drinks, and attractions in each city.\n\nIn 2016, Crypt TV partnered up with Fullscreen to launch the El Terror contest, a search for the most horrifying 30-second teaser. The winner would receive $50,000 to create a digital series based on their submission video. The winning concept was \"Afterlife\", a series from filmmakers Kate Freund and Jordan Harris about a woman who cheated death and is now haunted by an entity after her soul. \"Afterlife\" debuted on Fullscreen in 2017.\n\n\"The Look-See\" is a popular horror web series based on a short by the same name. The series is about a sharp-toothed grinning demonic entity that puts his chosen victims to potentially fatal tests. The character and series were created by Landon Stahmer. \n\n\"My First Day\" is a darkly comedic horror short about a demented child who gets accepted into a private school for young aspiring serial killers. The short was written and directed by Jon Kovel. The short went viral and was shown at the 2017 Tribeca Film Festival as part of an horror anthology entitled, \"Crypt TV's Monster Madness.\" \n\n\"Slice of Summer\" was a series of original horror shorts that premiered on the Chiller Network in July 2016. It featured works by filmmakers across the globe, including films \"The Thing in the Apartment\", \"The Grey Matter\", \"The Prey\", \"Meridians\", and \"Invaders\".\n\n\"Sunny Family Cult\" is a popular horror drama web series based on a short by the same name. The show centers around a teenager named Taylor who strives for a normal life while juggling her not-so-normal serial killing cult family. The series was created by Gabriel Younes. \n\nIn 2015, Crypt partnered with Hearst Digital Studios for a digital series called \"This Forgotten Day in Fright\". The series, hosted by LeeAnna Vamp and Ryan J. Downey, was part of Hearst's This Forgotten Day in... franchise, and looked at memorable moments from that day in the history of horror.\n\n\"The Thing in the Apartment\" is a popular horror short from 2015 about two women who must confront a terrifying creature lurking in the shadows of a flat. The short was written and directed by John Ross. In 2017 it was shown at the Tribeca Film Festival as part of an horror anthology entitled, \"Crypt TV's Monster Madness,\" and was featured as part of the Chiller Network's \"Slice of Summer.\" It spawned a 2017 sequel, \"The Thing in the Apartment: Part II.\" \n\nCrypt TV produced a live, four-minute murder mystery that aired on Snapchat in 2015, featuring a number of YouTube stars. Influencers such as Logan Paul, Lia Marie Johnson, Nick Bateman, Simone Shepherd, and others starred in the Clue-like dinner party mystery at a creepy mansion, in which they got \"killed off\" one by one. The program drew more than one million opens; the \"killer\" was revealed to be Lia Marie Johnson.\n"}

{"id": "528107", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=528107", "title": "E!", "text": "E!\n\nE! (originally an initialism of Entertainment Television) is an American basic cable and satellite television channel that is owned by the NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment Group division of NBCUniversal, all owned by Comcast.\n\nAs of January 2016, E! is available to 92.4 million households in America.\n\nE! was originally launched on July 31, 1987, as Movietime, a service that aired movie trailers, entertainment news, event and awards coverage, and interviews as an early example of a national barker channel. The channel was founded by Larry Namer and Alan Mruvka. Early Movietime hosts included Greg Kinnear, Paula Abdul, Katie Wagner, Julie Moran, Suzanne Kay (daughter of Diahann Carroll), Mark DeCarlo, Sam Rubin and Richard Blade.\n\nControlling ownership was originally held by a consortium of five cable television providers (Comcast, Continental Cablevision, Cox Cable, TCI, and Warner Cable), HBO/Warner Communications, and various founding shareholders, with HBO directly programming and managing the network. In 1989, after Time-Life bought Warner Communications to fend off a takeover bid by Paramount, the new Time Warner company held four of the eight major ownership positions and took over management control of Movietime and renamed the network as E!: Entertainment Television on June 1, 1990; this name change was made to emphasize its widening coverage of the celebrity–industrial complex, contemporary film, television and music, daily Hollywood gossip, and fashion.\n\nIn 1997, Comcast, one of the minority partners, teamed up with Disney/ABC Cable Networks to buy the channel after Time-Warner had exercised their put agreement. Comcast increased the ownership stakes in the network through mergers with forerunners of TCI and Continental under various circumstances. In November 2006, Comcast acquired Disney's 39.5% share of E! for $1.23 billion to gain full ownership of the network as part of a broader programming carriage agreement between Disney/ABC and Comcast.\n\nIn January 2011, Comcast Entertainment Group, the company's television unit, became a division of the NBCUniversal Television Group, after Comcast acquired a 51% majority stake in NBCUniversal from General Electric. E!'s only sister networks prior to the NBC Universal merger were the now-defunct channels Style Network (then Esquire Network) and G4, along with Comcast's sports networks: Versus, Comcast SportsNet and Golf Channel. In the case of Versus, E! staff produced that network's \"Sports Soup\" and G4's \"Web Soup\", while the Orlando-based Golf Channel featured no crossovers with E! at all due to incompatible audiences and operations. Versus and Golf Channel were taken under the direct control of the NBC Sports division, with the former being renamed NBC Sports Network in January 2012, and are no longer connected to their former sister networks beyond advertising and in-house operations.\n\nOn July 9, 2012, the channel introduced a revised logo (the first change to its logo since the network rebranded as E! in 1990), removing the exclamation mark background behind the \"E\" but keeping the exclamation point underneath, along with a new slogan \"Pop of Culture\", which coincided with the launch of the new series \"Opening Act\". The network also started the process of introducing scripted programming (the first series, \"The Royals\", premiering in March 2015), in addition to its existing reality and documentary series. The changes were announced during E!'s programming upfront presentation on April 30, 2012.\n\nE! is one of the few U.S. general-entertainment cable channels that broadcasts a daily news program; its flagship entertainment news program is \"E! News\", which debuted on September 1, 1991. The weekday program (which also has an hour-long weekend edition) features stories and gossip about celebrities, and the film, music and television industries, and has been broadcast under various formats since its launch, even being aired live for a time during the mid-2000s. It was first hosted by Dagny Hultgreen. Steve Kmetko was a host from 1994-2002. It has been hosted by Terrence Jenkins and Giuliana Rancic since 2012 and 2006, respectively, with Ryan Seacrest (who co-anchored the program from 2006 to 2012) serving as managing editor of the news operation.\n\n\"E! News\" was the only entertainment news show on the channel for much of its history until 2006, when the channel launched \"The Daily 10\", hosted by Sal Masekela and Catt Sadler (Debbie Matenopoulos also co-hosted from the show's inception until 2008); the series was cancelled in September 2010 after E! announced that the weekday editions of \"E! News\" would be expanded to one hour starting on October 25, 2010.\n\nE! also carried a simulcast of business news channel Bloomberg Television from 2004 to January 2009, when the latter network had expanded its cable and satellite carriage to a level that allowed the discontinuation of the simulcast. During its time on E!, the 5 to 8 a.m. block was the most watched period for the network, according to Nielsen Media Research.\n\nOutside \"E! News\" telecasts, the channel runs an \"E! News\"–branded ticker displaying entertainment news headlines each half-hour during regular programming (except during airings of \"E! News\" and \"The Soup\", and the channel's early morning infomercial block) which is updated daily; fast-breaking entertainment headlines (such as a celebrity arrest or death) may also be displayed on a ticker, during any program when warranted.\n\nE! is known for its live red carpet pre-shows for the industry's three prominent award shows, the Primetime Emmy Awards, the Golden Globe Awards, and the Academy Awards, and were famous for their fashion critiques by Joan Rivers; Rivers also hosted post-awards specials under the title \"Fashion Police\", which became a regular weekly series in September 2010. In April 2017, it was announced that E! had acquired the People's Choice Awards, which will move to the network from CBS in 2018 with a new November scheduling. The network promoted that the show would be given an \"end-to-end\" experience that will leverage its existing experience in awards show coverage.\n\nThe network also produces many documentary and biographical series, most notably \"E! True Hollywood Story\"; many of E!'s original specials are entertainment-related ranging from light fare (such as \"25 Cutest Child Stars All Grown Up\") to serious fare (such as \"15 Most Unforgettable Hollywood Tragedies\"). It also produces specials centering on investigative and crime stories including \"E! Investigates\", which features topical investigative reports on subjects ranging from child prostitution to teenage pregnancy.\n\nIn recent years, the network has become known for its reality television programs. Its most popular series as of 2011 is \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\", which has spawned three spin-offs (\"Kourtney and Khloé Take Miami\", \"Kourtney and Kim Take New York\", and \"Khloe and Lamar\"). Other original programming airing on the network included weekly version of \"Fashion Police\" (which continues as post-awards ceremony specials).\n\nE! has had three comedy programs: the late night talk show \"Chelsea Lately\", hosted by comedian Chelsea Handler, its scripted/improvised spin-off \"After Lately\", and \"The Soup\" (based on the popular 1991-2002 E! series \"Talk Soup\"), featuring clips of the previous week's TV shows with humorous commentary delivered by the host, actor/comedian Joel McHale. Handler also produced \"Love You, Mean It\", a weekly comedic look at pop culture hosted by Whitney Cummings.\n\nOver the years, E! has occasionally run acquired programming including reruns of \"Alice\", \"Absolutely Fabulous\", \"20/20\" lifestyle-based interview shows from ABC (since removed under NBCUniversal ownership), and edited 60-minute versions of \"Saturday Night Live\", though fewer of these programs currently air. The only programming currently airing on E! that it does not produce are broadcast standards-edited reruns of the former HBO series \"Sex and the City\" originally carried by HBO's sister network TBS, and feature films that air under the banner \"Movies We Love\"; the latter was part of a since-abandoned initiative by the network to use films to increase the network's ratings, though the branding remains, and low and mid-grossing female focused films from the Universal Pictures library usually receive their basic cable premiere on E!, with higher-grossing films premiering on USA Network. The network has aired same-week runs of NBC series (such as \"The Voice\", \"Fashion Star\", \"Whitney\", and \"Are You There, Chelsea?\"), and in the past aired previews of G4 programming to give that network an extended promotional platform due to their lowered carriage when it was removed from DirecTV in November 2010.\n\nE! HD is a high definition simulcast feed of E! that launched on December 8, 2008; like the rest of E!'s sister lifestyle and sports networks owned by former parent Comcast Entertainment Group and subsequently the NBC cable networks, the feed broadcasts in the 1080i resolution format. Currently, filmed program content and all of the network's post-2010 programs, along with limited pre-2010 content is carried in the format, with HD programming airing in a letterbox format on the SD channel (some films remain in 480i due to contractual or technical reasons). The HD feed is available on most cable and telco providers, along with both satellite services.\n\nDuring E!'s run as a broadcast service in Canada, the \"E! Ontario\" version of the service until the December 2008 discontinuation of the E! broadcast television system was available in HD over Hamilton, Ontario-based CHCH-TV (channel 11) on its channel 18 digital signal, though the majority of E!'s programming outside American primetime series before the shutdown of the television system was not available in the format.\n\n\"E! Online\" is the online arm of E!, featuring live updates on entertainment news stories; the website includes an online-only entertainment news bulletin titled \"E! News Now\", which is updated each weekday. The website also provides live streaming video of major red carpet events including movie premieres and award shows such as the Academy Awards and the Emmys, along with some blogs involving shows such as \"The Soup\". Columnists featured on the website include Kristin dos Santos (the \"Watch with Kristin\" television blog), Ted Casablanca (\"The Awful Truth\" gossip blog), and Marc Malkin (writer of an eponymous gossip blog and host of a daily video blog on the site).\n\nAs part of the rebrand of the cable channel on July 9, 2012, EOnline.com was redesigned for HTML5, including tablet and mobile devices.\n\nUnlike most international cable channels that have licensed an American cable channel's branding and programming, E! has existed as two separate television channels in Canada – in both broadcast and pay television forms.\n\nOn September 7, 2007, Canwest Global Communications rebranded its CH television system as E! CH originally launched on February 12, 2001 by CHCH/Hamilton, Ontario as a secondary service of the Global Television Network; the CH/E! system would later include four additional Canwest-owned stations in Quebec (CJNT/Montreal), British Columbia (CHEK/Victoria and CHBC/Kelowna) and Alberta (CHCA/Red Deer), and three affiliates owned by Jim Pattison Group in British Columbia (CKPG/Prince George and CFJC/Kamloops) and Alberta (CHAT/Medicine Hat). The E! television system shut down on September 1, 2009 due to low ratings and corporate financial difficulties that eventually led to Canwest filing for bankruptcy protection and selling its properties to Shaw Media for $6.7 million USD; the E! owned-and-operated stations experienced varied fates (CHCH and CJNT were sold to Channel Zero, CHEK was sold to an employee-led group; CHBC remained with Canwest and was converted into a Global O&O, and CHCA ceased operations outright), while the Pattison Group stations affiliated with the Rogers Media-owned Citytv system. As E!, local news and other regional programming, as well as most local community sponsorships on the O&O stations, used local branding (incorporating the callsign branding scheme common with Canadian stations not owned by a network or television system). This decision was at least partly made to avoid confusion with \"E! News\", but likely intended to ensure that local newscasts were not perceived as celebrity-oriented.\n\nThe E! brand would later return to Canada on November 1, 2010, when CTVglobemedia (whose assets are now owned by Bell Media) signed a multi-year/multi-platform agreement with Comcast to rebrand Category 2 specialty channel Star! (which had a similar format to E! U.S. and had carried some of its programming prior to the 2007 rebranding of CH) into a Canadian version of E! on November 29, 2010.\n\nE! is broadcast in Israel by cable provider HOT and by satellite provider yes.\n\nE! Philippines was launched in mid-1997 over-the-air in Metro Manila on DWKC-TV (channel 31), sharing the channel with Cinema Television. In 2000, CTV-31 Manila leased DWKC's entire broadcast day, and branded the channel as E! Philippines. It was originally broadcast 24 hours a day, but eventually reduced in 2001 to a primetime 6-midnight block, before ending in 2003. Some of E!'s programs were brought to the Philippines and remade in a local version, one of which was \"Wild On! Philippines\".\n\nThree years after the relaunch as a standalone cable channel, E! produced its very first original reality series in Asia, \"It Takes Gutz to Be A Gutierrez\" starring the Gutierrez family.\n\n"}

{"id": "77691", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=77691", "title": "Figure of speech", "text": "Figure of speech\n\nA figure of speech or rhetorical figure is figurative language in the form of a single word or phrase. It can be a special repetition, arrangement or omission of words with literal meaning, or a phrase with a specialized meaning not based on the literal meaning of the words. Figures of speech often provide emphasis, freshness of expression, or clarity. However, clarity may also suffer from their use, as figures of speech can introduce an ambiguity between literal and figurative interpretation.\n\nClassical rhetoricians classified figures of speech into four categories or \"quadripartita ratio\":\n\n\nThese categories are often still used. The earliest known text listing them, though not explicitly as a system, is the \"Rhetorica ad Herennium\", of unknown authorship, where they are called πλεονασμός (addition), ἔνδεια (omission), μετάθεσις (transposition) and ἐναλλαγή (permutation). Quintillian then mentioned them in \"Institutio Oratoria\". Philo of Alexandria also listed them as addition (πρόσθεσις), subtraction (ἀφαίρεσις), transposition (μετάθεσις), and transmutation (ἀλλοίωσις).\n\nFigures of speech come in many varieties. The aim is to use the language inventively to accentuate the effect of what is being said. A few examples follow:\n\nScholars of classical Western rhetoric have divided figures of speech into two main categories: schemes and tropes. \"Schemes\" (from the Greek , 'form or shape') are figures of speech that change the ordinary or expected pattern of words. For example, the phrase, \"John, my best friend\" uses the scheme known as apposition. \"Tropes\" (from Greek , 'to turn') change the general meaning of words. An example of a trope is irony, which is the use of words to convey the opposite of their usual meaning (\"For Brutus is an honorable man; / So are they all, all honorable men\").\n\nDuring the Renaissance, scholars meticulously enumerated and classified figures of speech. Henry Peacham, for example, in his \"The Garden of Eloquence\" (1577), enumerated 184 different figures of speech. Professor Robert DiYanni, in his book \"Literature – Reading Fiction, Poetry, Drama and the Essay\" wrote: \"Rhetoricians have catalogued more than 250 different \"figures of speech\", expressions or ways of using words in a nonliteral sense.\"\n\nFor simplicity, this article divides the figures between schemes and tropes, but does not further sub-classify them (e.g., \"Figures of Disorder\"). Within each category, words are listed alphabetically. Most entries link to a page that provides greater detail and relevant examples, but a short definition is placed here for convenience. Some of those listed may be considered rhetorical devices, which are similar in many ways.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1231200", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1231200", "title": "Fuji music", "text": "Fuji music\n\nFuji is a popular Nigerian musical genre. It arose from the improvisational Ajisari/Were music tradition, which is a kind of music performed to wake Muslims before dawn during the Ramadan fasting season. Were/Ajisari music itself was made popular by Alhaji Sikiru Ayinde Barrister.\n\nWere music/Ajisari, traditionally, was an Islamic type music played by the Muslim children in Yorubaland to wake the faithful for fasting or Suhur during Ramadan period. This musical genre was made popular by Alhaji Dauda Epo-Akara, the deceased who based in Ibadan,was the \"awurebe\" founder and Ganiyu Kuti, a.k.a. \"Gani Irefin\".\n\nThe Muslim community in Lagos metropolis (Lagos Mainland and Lagos Island) had a sizeable number of “Ajiwere” acts. These early performers drew great inspiration from Yoruba Sakara music style (using the sakara drum but without the violin-like goje instrument—which is normally played with an accompanying fiddle). The long list of notable Isale Eko (lower lagos city) \"ajiwere\" performers during the early Independence years included Sikiru (Omo Abiba), Ajadi Ganiyu, Ayinde Muniru Mayegun a.k.a. \"General Captain,\" Ajadi Bashiru, Sikiru Onishemo, Kawu Aminu, Jibowu Barrister (under whom Alhaji Sikiru Ayinde Barrister performed), Ayinde Fatayi, Kasali Alani, Saka Olayigbade, Ayinla Yekinni, and Bashiru Abinuwaye.\n\nVarying styles were beginning to evolve by this time, and it was not unusual for a few to play mouth organs (harmonica) between “Ajiwere” interludes within their compositions. Alhaji Sikiru Ayinde Barrister was the lead singer/composer of the popular ajisari group, Jibowu Barrister, under the leadership of Alhaji Jibowu Barrister (mentioned above). Alhaji Sikiru Ayinde Barrister and other young “Ajiwere” \"rocked\" Lagos and its environs.\n\nAlhaji Sikiru Ayinde Barrister is the creator of Fuji music, one of the variations of the were/Ajisari musical genre. The name, \"Fuji,\" chosen for the new musical genre was conceived in a rather funny and unusual way. According to Alhaji Sikiru Ayinde Barrister: \"I came up with it when I saw a poster at an airport, advertising the Mount Fuji, which is the highest peak in Japan.\" Fuji, in this context, should not be mistaken for the Yoruba word \"fuja,\" or \"faaji,\" which means leisure or enjoyment. \"Onifuja\" or \"Onifaaji\" is Yoruba for a socialite, or one who relishes leisure or enjoyment.\n\nFuji music is an offshoot of were/Ajisari musical genre. In one of his early LPs, which he used to chide the unreasonable critics who dubbed his creation \"a local music,\" Alhaji Sikiru Ayinde Barrister explained that \"Fuji music is a combination of music consisting of Sakara, Apala, juju, Aro, Afro, and gudugudu, possibly highlife.\" Alhaji Sikiru Ayinde Barrister did a tremendous job of popularizing his craft by taking it all over the world; he started touring the European continent, especially Britain, since the early 1970s. Also, he first brought his trade to the North America, particularly the United States of America in 1984. All these tours happened before any subsequent Fuji players ever left the shores of Africa.\n\nBetween 1970 and throughout the 1980s, other fuji musicians included Fatai Adio, Saura Alhaji, Student Fuji, Rahimi Ayinde (Bokote), Ramoni Akanni, Love Azeez, Waidi Akangbe, Sikiru Olawoyin, Agbada Owo (who prematurely experimented with the guitar), Iyanda Sawaba, Ejire Shadua, Wahabi Ilori, Wasiu Ayinde Barrister (he later changed his name to Wasiu Ayinde Marshall) and also the Ibadan quatro of Suleiman Adigun, Sakaniyau Ejire, and Wasiu Ayinla emerged, all introducing their versions of Fuji music.\n\nSince the early 1980s, Alhaji Kolynton Ayinla (Baba Alatika or Kebe-n-Kwara) is a name to be reckoned with as far as fuji music is concerned. Wasiu Ayinde Marshall Barrister before he changed his name to K1 De Ultimate, has gradually emerged (with hits such as \"Talazo Fuji\", 1984) after tutelage under Alhaji Sikiru Ayinde Barrister. Marshall had served under Barrister in different roles such as his instrument packer and notably as his road manager. He served under Dr. Sikiru Ayinde Barrister for 15 years. Marshall's style evolved through the early 1990s as he added youthful vigour to it. By the end of the 1990s,his brand of Fuji had become one of the most popular dance genres in the country. Another artist, Adewale Ayuba, dabbled into Fuji music and took the nation by storm in the early 1990s. He managed to give off a vibe of class, though Fuji music was more popular among Yoruba Muslims, as opposed to Juju music. His brand of Fuji, termed \"Bonsue Fuji\", was clean,lively, and appealed to young and old alike as it was not hard to accept. Ayuba clearly did an excellent job by staying away from any feud with any other musician. He still performs till date and has many followers. Another artist that emerged in the early 1990s was Abass Akande Obesere (Omo rapala), who brought lewd street slang called \"Asakasa\" into the Fuji scene. He became popular with the street type and even the educated buy and hide in their cars and rooms to listen to his music.\nGenerally, the lyrics are in Yoruba. Due to its popularity with young Nigerians, Fuji is now the main hook lines of Nigerian hip-hop music.\n\nPopular modern Fuji musicians in Nigeria include Abass Akande obesere[PK 1];[Sir)Shina Akanni, Adewale Ayuba, ;Wasiu Alabi,(Oganla 1)King Dr.Saheed Osupa [His Majesty]; Late Sunny T Adesokan (Omo Ina ton ko fuji) Alayeluwa Sulaimon Alao Adekunle Malaika(KS1, Original ), Shefiu Adekunle Alao (Omo Oko), Sule Adio (Atawéwé), Tajudeen Alabi Istijabah (Oju Kwara), Wasiu Ajani, (Mr. Pure Water), Taiye Currency, Alhaji Komi Jackson, Remi Aluko(Igwe fuji), Muri Alabi Thunder, Karube Aloma, Oyama Azeez (Arabesa | Alapatinrin) [The Modern Real Fuji Creator], Murphy Adisa Sabaika (Madiba 2), Abiodun Ike Minister (Aremo Alayeluwa), Tunde Ileiru, Karubey Shimiu, Adeolu Akanni (Paso Egba), Shamu Nokia, Bola Abimbola, (Quintessential) Sunny Melody, Olusegun Ologo, and Segun Michael .\n\nToday, fuji music has continued to attract younger generations; there are now over 10 fuji singing kids (such as Shanko Rasheed, Wasiu Container, Cripsymixtee, Konkolo Wally G, Global T, and Muri Ikoko) who are doing well in the industry. In this generation of singers, Wasiu Ayinde Marshall, known as (KWAM1 or K1 De Ultimate), has been the most recognizable name in the genre since the mid- to late 1990s, and Abass Akande Obesere,in the late 1990s the trio of Wasiu Alabi Pasuma (Oganla fuji and King Saheed Osupa are dominating the scene until the present.\n\n"}

The building was one of the first theatres in the region, and was originally a vaudeville/opera house/live performance venue.\n\nBuilt in 1893, it was designed by architect Oscar Cobb. It is located in a spot that was originally surrounded by hotels. The massive two-story brick building was built in the Romanesque Revival Style. The auditorium is located on the second floor, which features graceful arched windows on the front side. The street level contains two storefront spaces, with square window designs.\n\nAccording to the 1893 Ashland Daily Press \"Annual Edition\", the original plan and location for this building were different. Proposed at a corner of Sixth Avenue West and Main Street West, it was built instead at the present location, in a smaller and less expensive design. This was probably due to the financial panic of 1893.\n\nDespite being vacant and in need of restoration, some redevelopment has already been done, including the restoration of the front facade.\n\nThe building is a contributing resource within the West Second Street Historic District, of downtown Ashland. Although not located directly on Second Steet (later renamed Main Street), it is still considered a contribution to the Historic District, being located close to the District, on a side street.\n\nIn later years, the building housed a liquor store, and a gun shop.\n\n"}

{"id": "33371368", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33371368", "title": "Japan Music Week", "text": "Japan Music Week\n\nJapan Music Week (JMW) was an annual international music showcase festival and convention, covering all kinds of music genres, industry sectors and regions. \nJMW first began in 2009 and was centered on the downtown music hub of Shibuya, Tokyo.\n\nJapan Music Week was one of the largest music festivals in Japan, with more than 500 performers from over 40 countries playing in more than 50 venues over 10 days in November at as many as 200 events.\n\nJMW attracted a strong following among local musicians and entrepreneurs, as well as bands from abroad. Its focus on emerging talent earned the festival a burgeoning reputation as a breeding ground for music networking in the region.\n\nLynch formed JMW in November 2009 after being sent to American music-industry showcase South by Southwest (SXSW) to make a documentary for Space Shower TV, and developed the idea to start his own festival. \"SXSW is a weeklong festival and I think at that time they had about 3,000 artists playing,\" says Lynch. \"Austin is a much smaller city than Tokyo, even though it's kind of set up for conventions, so it just struck me that Tokyo, and Shibuya in particular, would be very suitable for hosting that kind of event.\". As founder of the free music-listings magazine Juice and its sister magazine Club Juice, Lynch used his contacts to persuade club owners to adhere to a wristband providing free or discounted access to a number of themed events occurring in live venues around the city.\n\nJapan Music Week kicked off with a big networking party at the well-known Shibuya club, O-East, on November 9, 2009. It was accompanied by panel discussions and seminars, and immediately followed by “Best of Japan,” a concert that aimed to showcase Japan-based artists, such as Kinlay Band and Kev Gray & The Gravy Train. Bands from abroad included the popular New Zealand rap-fusion outfit, Nesian Mystic. However, a lack of funding and the mixed reviews of 2009, saw serious organizational problems for 2010.\n\nComments on the JMW-related forums criticized the event for its lack of organization and overkill of events, with music ranging from Afghanistan Night to Hong Kong Night, which some musicians felt was clogging up the schedule with empty events for the sake of diversity. The finite number of guests and venues also meant audience figures was split too thinly with some clubs allegedly complaining of low turnouts.\n\nLynch, together with Tokyo-based events organizer, Jhoana Mendieta, secured sponsorship from Marlboro for the 2011 event, which enabled substantial funding for artists that offer free downloads and set up events. Lynch has stated, “We aim to provide a showcase for emerging artists, and to stimulate the local and international music industry to find strong new directions in the face of its many challenges.”. He clearly stands by his vision, \"I believe next year we could have 100 or 200 cities in Japan Music Week.\"\n\nSimilar festivals elsewhere include the Kansai Music Conference in Osaka, Popkomm in Berlin, North by Northeast (NXNE) in Toronto, North by Northwest (NXNW) in Portland, Oregon and West by Southwest (WXSW) in Tucson, Arizona. On an international scale there is the Fête de la Musique, also known as World Music Day, a music festival taking place around the world on June 21.\n\n"}

{"id": "591054", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=591054", "title": "Lew Grade", "text": "Lew Grade\n\nLew Grade, Baron Grade, OStJ, KC*SS (25 December 1906 – 13 December 1998), born Louis Winogradsky, was a British media proprietor and impresario.\n\nOriginally a dancer, and later a talent agent, Grade's interest in television production began in 1954 when, in partnership, he successfully bid for franchises in the newly created ITV network, which led to the creation of Associated Television (ATV). Having worked for a time in the United States, he was aware of the potential for the sale of television programming to American networks, and a subsidiary, the Incorporated Television Company (ITC; commonly known as ITC Entertainment) was formed with this specific objective in mind. Grade had some success in this field with such series as Gerry Anderson's various Supermarionation series such as \"Thunderbirds\", Patrick McGoohan's \"The Prisoner\", and Jim Henson's \"The Muppet Show\". Later, Grade invested in film production, but several expensive box office failures caused him to lose control of ITC, and ultimately resulted in the disestablishment of ATV after it lost its ITV franchise.\n\nGrade was born in Tokmak, Taurida Governorate, Russian Empire to Isaak and Olga Winogradsky. In 1912, when Grade was five years old, the Jewish family emigrated to escape Cossack violence and anti-Semitism, from Odessa via Berlin to Brick Lane in Bethnal Green in the East End of London.\n\nIsaak worked as a trouser-presser while his three sons (Grade and his younger brothers, Bernard (later Bernard Delfont) and Leslie) attended the Rochelle Street Elementary School near Shoreditch, where Yiddish was spoken by 90% of the pupils. For two years the Winogradskys lived in rented rooms at the north end of Brick Lane, before moving to the nearby Boundary Estate.\n\nAt the age of 15, Grade became an agent for a clothing company, and shortly afterwards started his own business. In 1926, he was declared Charleston Champion of the World at a dancing competition at the Royal Albert Hall. Fred Astaire was one of the judges. Grade subsequently became a professional dancer going by the name Louis Grad; he changed this name to Lew Grade, which came from a Paris reporter's typing error that Grade liked and decided to keep. Decades later, the then octogenarian Lord Grade once danced the Charleston at a party Arthur Ochs Sulzberger gave in New York.\n\nSigned as a dancer by Joe Collins (father of Jackie and Joan Collins) in 1931, around 1934, Grade went into partnership with him and became a talent agent in their company Collins & Grade. Among their earliest clients were the harmonica player Larry Adler and the jazz group Quintet of the Hot Club of France.\n\nFollowing the beginning of the Second World War in 1939, Grade became involved in arranging entertainment for soldiers in Harrogate, and later joined the British Army. He was discharged after two years when an old problem with swelling of the knees, which had earlier ended his dancing career, recurred. In 1945, the arrangement with Collins having been terminated, Grade formed a partnership with his brother Leslie (Lew and Leslie Grade Ltd., or the Grade Organisation). That year, the brothers travelled in the United States, where they developed their entertainment interests. His connections included, among others, Bob Hope and Judy Garland, who performed in Britain for the first time. The brothers became the main bookers of artists for the London Palladium in 1948, then managed by Val Parnell for the Moss Empires Group owned by the family of Prince Littler.\n\nIn 1954, Grade was contacted by the manager of singer Jo Stafford, Mike Nidorf, who notified him of an advertisement in \"The Times\" inviting franchise bids for the new, commercial ITV network.\n\nAssembling a consortium that included impresarios Val Parnell and Prince Littler, the Incorporated Television Programme Company (ITP), which soon changed its name to Incorporated Television Company (ITC; also known as ITC Entertainment), was formed. ITC's bid to the Independent Television Authority (ITA) was rejected on the grounds of its conflict of interest from its prominence and involvement in artist management.\n\nThe Associated Broadcasting Development Company (ABD) had gained ITA approval for both the London weekend and Midlands weekday contracts, but was undercapitalised; Grade's consortium joined with the ABD to form what became Associated Television (ATV). Reflecting his background in variety, Grade's favourite show and a success for the new company was \"Sunday Night at the London Palladium\" (1955–67, 1973–74), one of the most popular programmes on British television in its day. Grade did not avoid the other end of the cultural spectrum, and from 1958 Sir Kenneth Clark began to talk about the history of art on television.\n\nMeanwhile, Grade committed the funds for what would become the first trans-Atlantic success of the ITP subsidiary: \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" (1955–60), commissioned by UK-based American producer Hannah Weinstein. ITC became a wholly owned ATV subsidiary in 1957, That same year ATV established a music publishing division with ATV Music and gained a half interest in Pye Records in 1959, later Pye became a wholly owned subsidiary.\n\nGrade was deputy managing director of ATV under Val Parnell until 1962, when he became managing director having contrived to have the board oust Parnell. Grade soon decided that the Midlands deserved its own regular soap opera as a rival to \"Coronation Street\". \"Crossroads\", much derided but ultimately a serious challenge to Granada's series in the ratings, began its initial quarter century run in November 1964.\n\nITC's success continued and had many internationally successful TV series, leading Howard Thomas, managing director of the Associated British Corporation (ABC), to complain that Grade distributed programming for \"Birmingham, Alabama, rather than Birmingham, England\". These series included \"The Saint\" (1962–69), which was sold to over 80 countries, and two featuring Patrick McGoohan: \"Danger Man\" (1960–68) and \"The Prisoner\" (1967–68). These series, exclusively thrillers, were normally used as summer replacements for American-made programmes until the mid-1960s. While many of Grade's series used American actors in lead roles (\"The Baron\" and \"Man in a Suitcase\", for example) it was those series which used an exclusively British cast, such as \"The Saint\" (and \"The Avengers\", made by another ITV contractor), which were more successful in the United States.\n\nIn 1962, AP Films became a subsidiary of ITC. Co-founded by Gerry Anderson, AP Films produced the children's marionette puppet (\"Supermarionation\") series during the 1960s, \"Thunderbirds\" (1965–66), and (as Century 21), \"Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons\" (1967–68). After a screening of the pilot for \"Thunderbirds\" (\"Trapped in the Sky\", 1964), Grade insisted that the episodes be lengthened to fill a one-hour slot. Unusually for children's television series, these colour programmes were generously budgeted for the time (Grade paid £22,000 per episode), and has been successfully repeated internationally. \nIn 1966, Grade's companies were re-organised again to form the Associated Communications Corporation (ACC). That year, \"The Sunday Times\" investigated the interconnected nature of the companies controlled by Grade and his two brothers, Bernard Delfont and Leslie Grade. Their firms, effectively amounting to a \"cartel\", were agents for most of the major talents in acting as well as entertainment and controlled theatres in both London and the rest of the UK and ATV was a major provider of televised entertainment.\n\nThe following year, ATV lost its London franchise to what would become London Weekend Television (LWT); at the same time, however, ATV's Midlands franchise was expanded to run throughout the week from July 1968. Through ATV Music, Grade acquired Northern Songs, gaining control of the Lennon–McCartney song catalogue.\n\nForeign sales remained strong for a time (valued at $30 million in 1970) and the ACC received the Queen's Awards for Export in both 1967 and 1969.\n\nSome of the 1970s distributions performed poorly: these included \"The Julie Andrews Hour\" (1972–1973), which aired for only one season on the ABC Television Network in the United States. This received positive reviews and seven Emmy Awards, including the title Best Variety Series. Neither \"The Protectors\" (1972–74) and \"The Persuaders!\" (1971–72), both action shows, were particularly successful. Anderson moved to live action science fiction shows \"UFO\" (1969–71) and \"\" (1975–77). After \"Space: 1999\", Gerry Anderson made no new series for ITC, but maintained a connection with Grade until Grade lost control of his companies in 1982.\n\nIn the mid-1970s Grade approached American puppeteer Jim Henson, who was in need of assistance for his latest TV project. Henson wanted to create a new variety show starring his Muppet characters, but had been dismissed by American networks on account of his contributions to children's programmes such as \"Sesame Street\" (from 1969). CBS came close to agreeing to broadcast \"The Muppet Show\", but only if it was during a syndicated block of its programming. After watching one of Henson's pilots and recalling a special made in one of his studios Grade allowed Henson to realise his project in Britain (the series was recorded at ATV's Elstree Studios) and distributed internationally by ITC. Grade's action was instrumental in bringing \"The Muppet Show\" to the screen in 1976 and ensuring its success.\n\nGrade's other accomplishments in TV included the mini-series \"Jesus of Nazareth\" (1977), which was successfully sold to the American market and secured a record-breaking $12 million in revenue. Several years in preparation, the deal with the Italian broadcaster RAI and director Franco Zeffirelli was announced in August 1974.\n\nGrade approached Blake Edwards to revive the Pink Panther franchise as a TV series, an option Edwards was not keen on, but he did work on developing scripts. Eventually, he persuaded Grade to finance the property as a feature film project with he and Peter Sellers waiving their fees in return for a profit-sharing arrangement. Both men's careers had not been prospering for a few years. Only Grade's second big budget feature, ITC produced the eventual film \"The Return of the Pink Panther\" (1975), while United Artists (UA), who had earlier rejected the project themselves, gained distribution rights and a 5% share of the profits. Distribution in other countries was undertaken by ITC. \"The Return of the Pink Panther\" was a commercially successful release.\n\nIt also prompted Grade to move into the film industry, where he had success with \"Farewell My Lovely\" (1975). Other films of the period made with Grade's involvement include the co-releases \"The Boys From Brazil\" (1978) with 20th Century Fox and \"Movie Movie\" (also 1978) with Warner Brothers. He was a producer on the Ingmar Bergman films \"Autumn Sonata\" (1978) and \"From the Life of the Marionettes\" (1980). Grade was executive producer of \"The Muppet Movie\" (1979) and \"The Great Muppet Caper\" (1981); Orson Welles portrayed a studio executive named \"Lew Lord\" in the first film. One domestic British film made by the ITC subsidiary Black Lion Films, \"The Long Good Friday\" (1980) was purchased and released by HandMade Films after Grade and his company had effectively disowned it for, in Grade's reputed opinion, seeming to be sympathetic to the IRA.\n\nGrade's backing of an expensive \"all-star\" flop was to prove decisive. Of \"Raise the Titanic\" (1980), an adaptation of the novel by Clive Cussler, Grade himself observed that \"It would have been cheaper to lower the Atlantic\". The film was panned by critics and, after costing $36 million, returned only $8 million in rentals. This and other expensive box office failures – including \"Saturn 3\" (1980) and \"The Legend of the Lone Ranger\" (1981) – marked the end of Grade's involvement in major film production. Despite this, several of the most critically acclaimed films produced by Grade were released after the failure of \"Raise the Titanic\": these included \"On Golden Pond\" (1981) and \"Sophie's Choice\" (1982), both winners of Academy Awards, as well as \"The Dark Crystal\" (1982), which was Jim Henson's final project created in association with ITC.\n\nIn 1980, Grade's standing in the mass media industry was damaged by three events: Henson's decision to end \"The Muppet Show\" after five years, the poor reception to \"Raise the Titanic\", and a decision that, effective from 1 January 1982, ATV Midlands would be permitted to keep its licence only on the condition that it terminate its association with Grade and ITC (ultimately leading to its re-branding as Central Television). Grade resigned his position in the company while it underwent a series of partnerships and mergers. In 1982, he lost control of ACC to Robert Holmes à Court, who dismissed him and all his staff.\n\nGrade was brought in by American producer Norman Lear in June 1982 to head the London division of Embassy Communications International involved in the production and distribution of films and television programmes. Subsequently he became a producer of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical \"Starlight Express\". After Coca-Cola had bought Embassy, he became the head of a new venture, the Grade Company in 1985, and was elected a vice-president of the Loews Group chain of cinemas in the United States. The Grade Company produced adaptations for television of works by novelist Dame Barbara Cartland; he owned the rights to 450 of her romances.\n\nBy the mid-1990s, Grade had returned to ITC to head the company one final time until his death in 1998. Grade was a member of the Founding Council of the Rothermere American Institute at the University of Oxford.\n\nKnighted in 1969, Grade was created a life peer — Baron Grade, of Elstree in the County of Hertfordshire on 22 June 1976. He chose Elstree as his territorial designation because ATV's main studios were based there.\n\nGrade died of heart failure, 12 days short of his 92nd birthday, on 13 December 1998 in London. To celebrate Grade's life and mark the centenary of his birth, BBC Radio 2 transmitted two special one-hour tribute programmes on 24 and 25 December 2006.\n\n"}

Marcinelle school cartoonists were all associated with the weekly magazine, \"Spirou\", whose offices in the 1940s were located in the town of Marcinelle, near Charleroi in Belgium.\n\nThe style of these cartoonists soon became the preferred in-house style for artists working at the influential \"Spirou\" magazine, and thus had a huge impact on the Franco-Belgian comics scene, inspiring generations of cartoonists. \n\nStylistically, the Marcinelle school is a mix of cartoonish and realist, and is also sometimes called \"comic-dynamic\" (\"comic\" here refers to \"comical\", not the medium). It is often cited in books in opposition to Hergé's \"ligne claire\" style. Though these two styles have much in common, Marcinelle school is all about conveying the impression of movement, while \"ligne claire\" tends to be more schematic.\n\nThe artists most closely associated to the Marcinelle school are:\n\nOther artists considered part of the School include:\n\n"}

Czech music also constitutes a substantial part of the music culture of its direct predecessor, Czechoslovakia.\n\nMusic in this area has its roots in sacred music from more than a thousand years ago. The oldest recorded song from this territory is the hymn \"Hospodine, pomiluj ny\" (\"Lord, Have Mercy on Us\"), dating from the turn of the 11th century.\n\nBohemian traditional music includes that of Chodsko , where bagpipes are common. Moravian traditional music is known for the cimbalom, which is played in ensembles that also include double bass, clarinet and violins. The traditional music of Moravia displays regional influences, especially in Valachia with a Romanian and Ukrainian legacy, and has close cultural relations with Slovakia and Lachia (the borderland of northern Moravia and Czech Silesia) with its Polish aspects.\n\nA famous dance from the region is the Bohemian polka.\nEarly evidence of music from this region is documented in manuscripts from the library of the Cistercian monastery in Vyšší Brod (founded in 1259). One of the most important is manuscript No. 42, from 1410. It contains a hymn called \"Jezu Kriste, ščedrý kněže\" (\"Jesus Christ Bountiful Prince\"), that people would sing during the preaching of John Huss.\n\nWith the development of towns in the 15th century, music started to play an important role in two Bohemian centers: Prachatice and Sušice. Václav z Prachatic (Václav of Prachatice) dealt with the theory of music at the Charles University in Prague. His manuscript \"\" is a collective work on the theory of music inspired by the thoughts of Johan de Muris, who worked in Paris, and is in the university library.\n\nExtensive musical activities in Prachatice took place in the second half of the 16th century during the Renaissance, a notable period of \"literátská bratrstva\" (\"men of letters brotherhoods\"). Their main focus was community singing performed during ceremonial services. The brotherhood established its memorial book in 1575, which described its activities until 1949, when the brotherhood perished. The Habsburg Counter-Reformation in Bohemia after 1620 also affected music in the region. Catholic priests performed Gregorian chorals, while the people sang spiritual songs often based on the Protestant tradition. This ended in a new Catholic edition of hymn books such as \"Capella regia musicalis\".\n\nThe Czech classicism period is exemplified by František Xaver Brixi, Johann Baptist Wanhal, and Augustin Šenkýř. Among the 18th and 19th century composers are Vincenc Mašek , Jan Jakub Ryba, Jan August Vitásek. In the 19th century German and Austrian productions also had their place here. The founder of Czech national music Bedřich Smetana was inspired by the Bohemian Forest while creating his symphonic poem \"Vltava\". Antonín Dvořák was also inspired by the Bohemian Forest in his piece called \"Klid pro violoncello a orchestr\".\n\nThe traditional music of Bohemia and Moravia influenced the work of composers like Leoš Janáček, Antonín Dvořák, Bedřich Smetana, and Bohuslav Martinů. Earlier composers from the region include Adam Michna, Heinrich Biber, Jan Dismas Zelenka, Johann Wenzel Stamitz and Johann Ladislaus Dussek.\n\n"}
{"id": "1898660", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1898660", "title": "Music on hold", "text": "Music on hold\n\nMusic on hold (MOH) is the business practice of playing recorded music to fill the silence that would be heard by telephone callers who have been placed on hold. It is especially common in situations involving customer service.\n\nMusic on hold is sometimes referred to as phone on hold, message on hold, on hold messaging, or hold music.\n\nMusic on hold was created by Alfred Levy, an inventor, factory owner, and entrepreneur. In 1962, Levy discovered a problem with the phone lines at his factory. He discovered that a loose wire was touching a metal girder on the building. This made the building a giant receiver so that the audio broadcast signal from a radio station next door would transmit through the loose wire and could be heard when calls were put on hold. Levy patented his work in 1966. While other advancements have come to change and enhance the technology, it was this initial patent creation that began the evolution for today's music on hold.\n\nMost MOH systems are integrated into a telephone system designed for businesses via an audio jack on the telephone equipment labeled \"MOH\". There are also some units with built-in message on hold capabilities and units designed for small businesses without an extensive phone system.\n\nToday, equipment that supports physical media usually plays CDs. Some older systems may still use cassette tapes (sometimes employing endless-loops), or reel-to-reel tape players. In each case, the unit loads the media into a digital memory chip to prevent premature wearing of the mechanical parts.\n\nEquipment that supports virtual media generally plays MP3 files. Several types of units play these files. USB Flash Drive units allow an MP3 file to be received electronically, downloaded to a flash drive and connected to the player. Ethernet based remote load units connect via the network to a remote IP address. Phone line based remote load systems allow for a connection via an analog telephone line and dialing the number belonging to the unit. For VoIP phone systems, MP3s are loaded without any equipment.\n\nNewer technology allows MP3 files to be downloaded automatically from the internet so that messages (or interesting content in the form of news and weather, amongst many) can be changed daily. The new \"online on hold\" technology makes the older technology redundant since it requires no additional hardware. All these systems allow analog-to-digital audio storage and playback.\n\nAs of 2011 allow productions to be downloaded via the Internet or played through a USB flash drive. This allows for larger files and higher quality formats. Grace Digital manufactures internet radio devices that play streaming content (see Recent Trends, below).\n\nA number of studies have been conducted, which highlight consumer perceptions of music on hold, reinforcing its use by businesses to improve standards of call handling.\n\nA survey of more than 2,000 UK consumers commissioned by audio branding specialist PHMG (company) revealed 70% of consumers are put on hold for more than 50% of their calls. When put on hold, 73% of callers want to hear something other than beeps or silence.\n\nA CNN survey found that 70 percent of callers in the United States who hold the line in silence hang up within 60 seconds. Meanwhile, research by North American Telecom found callers hearing music on hold will stay on the line 30 seconds longer than callers experiencing silence.\n\nThe musical source may be as simple as playing a local radio station through the MOH jack. This is unlawful without the express permission of the music title and mechanical copyright holders.\n\nOwners of radio stations will usually air their broadcast signal as music on hold, using their main program signal, if there are several. Examples include RÚV from Iceland using Rás 1 as the on-hold music.\n\nCommercial CDs eliminate the problems encountered with radio commercials, and they offer control over the selection of music; they do not, however, grant proper license for MOH use unless users first obtain permission from the song title copyright owner (when the song is not in the \"public domain\") and the mechanical copyright owner. (See \"Radio,\" above, for more details.)\n\nCDs are available that have been specifically recorded and licensed for MOH systems. These may contain only music, or may include periodic voice-overs with messages such as \"Your call is important\" or \"Please stay on the line\". Such off-the-shelf recordings may be generic or may be specific to individual industries, but will not be customized for individual companies.\n\nIn general, custom music on hold is advised to:\n\nCDs (or other MOH formats, such as MP3 files) can be custom-created to suit the particular needs of a business. The announcements can be scripted to emphasize particular attributes of the business such as location, store hours, or special promotions or services. These are typically used for up-selling and cross-selling callers. Companies can either record the messages themselves, or hire a music on hold production company.\n\nA program loaded onto an existing computer and connected to the phone system can allow automatic content updates interspersed with company information.\n\nStreaming MOH refers to a live music on hold stream (URL-based delivery) which can also include custom content. Streams in http .mp3 format include those provided by easyonhold.com. Streaming MOH can also refer to a streaming media server, as with Cisco Unified Call Manager, in which case RTP format is utilized.\n\nPrograms available to non-profit organizations at no cost. Very few companies offer absolutely free programs. The programs are available in generic and custom formats, and are delivered at no cost to the requesting organization.\n\nThe style of music played by MOH systems depends largely on the type of business offering the service. It is generally best to present music that will not be offensive to the audience, but that would also be of particular interest to the typical caller. A western apparel store may choose to play country music. A Christian book store may choose to play popular Christian music. A university may choose to play classical music. An athletic ticket office may choose to play the team or school's fight song. Light classics, smooth jazz, and beautiful music are common choices, as is fully synthesized melodic music.\n\nThe most common MOH is \"Opus Number One\", which is on \"65 million Cisco phone sets worldwide as the default hold music,\" according to a \"This American Life\" podcast (number 516). The composer, Tim Carleton, recorded the song in 1989 on a four-track tape recorder with Darrick Deel. When Deel, who works at Cisco, told Carleton their song could be the default music on hold, Carleton also approved.\n\nWith the application of newer equipment, music on hold devices can now interact with the caller. No additional programs are required on the platform, as all the logic is done with the MoH device. This can include services such as 'polling on hold', rating your customer service officer anonymously, etc. \n\nThe trend toward hosted IP telephony for business phone systems is demanding changes in music on hold message technology. In November, 2013, EasyOnHold.com introduced custom messages on hold streams for use with Asterisk and OnSIP phone systems.\n\nIn the US, and other countries where copyright laws are practiced, authors are granted copyright protection on their musical compositions. Such copyright protection has existed since just after the turn of the 20th century and most music written prior to 1900-1910 - from impressionism back to baroque and antiquity are said to be \"in the public domain.\" Use of any said music prior to the creation of these copyright laws may be presumed to be free for use by all - although individual titles may have been later copyrighted through a change in the composition or arrangement. The use of copyrighted music is not for free use in the public domain.\n\nAll music written after this period, which is copyrighted under multiple acts of congress, are owned by the author(s) or their assignees. The use of this music is protected and controlled in order that the owner may derive usage income. Specific to telephonic MOH (music-on-hold), the US laws currently protect the copyright owners from unlawful, unpermitted use of their music titles in over-the-phone broadcast. Any person or business wishing to use current, popular, post 1900-1910, copyrighted music for MOH purposes may only lawfully do so by obtaining permission from the owner. Currently, performance rights societies such as ASCAP, BMI and SESAC will sell blanket permission to use music titles in their catalog for MOH purposes—for an express annual fee - calculated by size and frequency of usage. Failure to obtain this paid permission is a violation of US copyright laws.\n\nThis same copyright protection is also true in the rebroadcast of any radio program. As mentioned earlier, the broadcaster has been assigned a narrow and specific usage license to air copyrighted song titles. This does not include permission to any person or business to re-broadcast that program on telephonic MOH. The broadcaster may not promote such unlawful use and is not an owner who has any lawful right to grant MOH usage permission. They do not hold the ownership of the title and have no right to license use in any way. Those who plug radio broadcast into their telephone MOH without first obtaining paid permission through the owner's agents (ASCAP, BMI or SESAC) may be in violation of copyright law and may be prosecuted under existing federal laws.\n\nA second copyright exists when it comes to licensing use for telephonic MOH. A piece of music, as mentioned above, is copyrighted and may be licensed for use as a music title and is understood to be a combination of melody, harmony and, where applicable, lyrics. However, neither radio listeners nor MOH listeners could hear this music unless it was recorded - providing a delivery medium whereby the \"music\" becomes a \"performance.\" As mentioned elsewhere, in countries such as the US, where said copyright laws are enforced, nearly every recording of a song title holds its own \"mechanical copyright.\"\n\nFor most of the 20th century, music was recorded in studios, produced by record company executives, producers, arrangers and engineers who were hired to deliver the artist's finished recordings for mastering and duplication - for sale on the varied media: 78, 45 and 33 RPM vinyl, reel-to-reel, 8-track tape, cassette and compact disc. To protect their investment, the record companies obtain a mechanical copyright in order to protect and control the recording with which they derive usage and sales income. (For those still uncertain of the difference between \"song title\" and \"mechanical\" copyrights, consider the Capitol Records lawsuit for copyright infringement against Nike some 20 years ago. Nike legally obtained permission to use the Beatles song title \"Revolution\" from the title's owner, Michael Jackson. They used the Capitol Records owned recording of the Beatles' performance, but failed to obtain and pay for permission and use. Capitol Records sued and prevailed because Nike ONLY had a license to use the title and did not have a license to use the mechanical recording.)\n\nTherefore, persons or businesses wishing to play music that falls \"in the public domain\" are still legally required to obtain permission to use the mechanical recording of this music, from the mechanical copyright holder. And where the use is of copyrighted music, the same applies. In all cases, before a song title may be broadcast on a telephone MOH, said use must be approved and licensed from BOTH the \"song title\" copyright owner (if it is NOT in public domain) and the \"mechanical\" copyright owner. \n\nIt is generally known within the on-hold industry that some performance rights societies, with regional offices and staff, both monitor and prosecute persons and businesses that infringe on the copyright of title holders in their libraries. ASCAP and BMI are both aggressive about this, from time to time. It is not known whether any record companies are currently or actively monitoring and prosecuting violators of their mechanical license.\n\nAs of 2010, the music-on-hold/message-on-hold business was a 100+ million dollar industry with more than 300 different vendors to choose from producing custom content amounting to less than $1M in sales per company - including various manufacturers of specific-duty, message-on-hold devices.\n\n"}

The character Olli was original created in 2004 by Dutch designer and film director Hein Mevissen and writer Diederiekje Bok as a character for a bottled mineral water. Olli was one of many characters used on the packages and posters of the bottled water brand and John's Phone. Olli was launched on a party of MTV In Rotterdam in 2004. In 2013 Olli was again part of a campaign. This time to save the Rotterdam Zoo Diergaarde Blijdorp. Olli is part of the Ollimania family which is the company that created and owns all characters. Olli became a national hype in the Netherlands from the launch in 2004. After the launch Olli became the symbol of Rotterdam and professional football club Feyenoord.\nOn September 10, 2015, Ollimania and its creators Hein Mevissen and Diederiekje Bok donated a huge Olli statue to the Sophia Children’s Hospital in Rotterdam. They did this to give a smile to the little patients and parents in the hospital. This original big Olli is there to stay.\n\nThe first two Ollimania books were launched in October 2014. 'Olli en het poepkanon' and 'Olli is een olifant'. Both books made it into the top 10 of best sold children books in the Netherlands. In June 2015 Ollimania published again two new books called 'Olli en de woestijndraak' and 'Olli op reis'.\n\n\nHein Mevissen and Diederiekje Bok from design company John Doe designed Olli from the basic shape of a soccer ball. They believe the basic shape, size and character was part of Olli's success. This made Olli easily recognizable to audiences. Olli is drawn in a minimalist style, requiring only a few lines and one primary color. Olli was created in three sizes, one small size 4.7 in. one medium, size 11 in. and one big size 7.2 ft.\n\nThere are two big Olli's. They are the elder version of small Olli. The Big Olli's is a special creature model made for several charities. One is a permanent hard plastic polyester statue at the Sophia Children's Hospital and another one has a temporarily place at the Rotterdam Zoo. The big Olli that is used in the short film to save the Rotterdam ZOO is stored at a secret location according to the creators.\n\nOlli is toy elephant grown to the size of a real elephant. Olli is a lovable character with furry friends living in a Japanese fantasy world. Later in 2013 there was a story added that he was also the favorite toy of Famous Soccer player Giovanni van Bronckhorst. Together they are the main cast of a short film. In Rotterdam, Netherlands of 1980, Giovanni van Bronckhorst is a little boy (played in the short film by the son of Giovanni van Bronckhorst). One day, he discovers a stuffed Elephant at the Rotterdam Zoo and immediately grows attached to it. The name of the elephant is Olli. Giovanni takes him everywhere he goes, especially when he plays soccer. One day during a soccer game, he loses Olli in the canal of Rotterdam. 28 years later in 2013, Giovanni became a Famous Soccer Player and trainer of soccer club Feyenoord and Olli, also grew big, reunite again.\n\nHein Mevissen and Diederiekje Bok have a history in creating things that help people. To give something back to society and convince big brands to do so too. Olli was a few times part of a strategy they developed in 2004 and created Olli as a separate brand to generate awareness and in one campaign to generate more traffic and money for a ZOO in Rotterdam.\n\nIn December 2013 Hein Mevissen and Diederiekje Bok of John Doe got awarded with the highest Dutch advertising award the Golden Loeki for this campaign. The agency John Doe got the award in a Live television show from Arian Buurman, CEO of the Stichting Ether Reclame who hosts the Loeki awards.\n\nIn 2013 Olli was used to help and save the Rotterdam zoo to generate money after the zoo lost government funding.

Ollimania works with local charity organizations as well as collaborating on common projects, fund‐raisings and social activities. In 2013 Ollimania saved a historic Zoo. In 2015 Ollimania brings its stuffed toy characters to children hospitals, where he interact with little patients by distributing Ollimania presents, reading out Ollimania stories, taking pictures and even organizing birthday celebrations for the most needing ones and their families.

The Dutch Insurance company used illegally images and foto’s from Ollimania to sell insurances to their customers. The Dutch court ruled in favor of John Doe BV/ Ollimania and urged ASR Nederland to stop their copyright infringement.\nASR Nederland had a license for a year on one of the Olli toys that expired in August 2014. The insurance company also kept 30.000 toys that were meant for the Rotterdam zoo to earn money to keep the ZOO open. ASR Nederland was entitled to keep the toys and distribute them however they see fit as long they would not infringe the copyrights of John Doe BV and Olli again. ASR Nederland is the biggest insurance company of the Netherlands with almost 3000 employees.

Child sex tourism is a problem, primarily by visitors from the United States. Sex trafficking is also a problem in the country.\n\nWhilst prostitution is legal, the buying of sexual services is not.\n\nRelated activities such as procuring another person to work as a prostitute, providing premises for prostitution and living off the earnings of prostitution are illegal. Keeping, managing or assisting in the management of a brothel is also prohibited. Liquor licensing laws prohibit prostitution in bars.\n\nThe Summary Jurisdiction (Offences) Act Chapter 98 prohibits \"common prostitutes\" (women who have previously received a police warning) from soliciting in a street or public place for the purpose of prostitution. \"Male persons\" are prohibited from loitering for the purpose of prostitution, or to persistently solicit or importune for immoral purposes.\n\nThe laws treat prostitution offences as nuisances and penalties are small.\n\nThe Trafficking in Persons Prohibition Act of 2003 combats trafficking, but the maximum penalty is low, compared to other countries, at 5 years imprisonment or $5,000 fine.\n\nThe Immigration laws prohibit the entry into the country of prostitutes or any person living off the proceeds of prostitution.\n\nThe laws are commonly not enforced, and law enforcement officials are often corrupt.\n\nAlthough illegal, brothels are widespread in the country. Orange Walk Town is reputed to have the highest concentration of brothels.\n\nIn June 2011, the country's best known brothel, Raul's Rose Garden, was burnt down. It had first opened in February 1981. Before their withdrawal in the 1990s, the establishment was popular with British soldiers.\n\nSome hotels operate a \"ficha\" system. Prostitutes rent rooms in the hotel and attract clients in the bar. The women are paid commission on the drinks brought by the clients before going to the rooms. The rent of the room is taken out of the commission. These hotels are often connected to nightclubs or go-go bars.\n\nTo try and combat the spread of STIs, including HIV, and by inter-governmental agreement, a number of brothels were set up for the exclusive use of British troops stationed in the country. The prostitutes, many from Guatemala, had to carry a photo identification card and undergo weekly health checks. The use of condoms was mandatory.\n\nBelize is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to sex trafficking. The UN Special Rapporteur on Trafficking in Persons reported family members facilitate the sex trafficking of Belizean women and girls. In tourist regions, foreign child sex tourists, primarily from the United States, exploit child sex trafficking victims. Sex trafficking of Belizean and foreign women and girls, primarily from Central America, occur in bars, nightclubs, brothels, and domestic service. LGBTI men, women, and children are vulnerable to sex trafficking. Foreign men, women, and children—particularly from Central America, Mexico, and Asia—migrate voluntarily to Belize in search of work and are often exploited by traffickers who recruit victims using false promises of relatively high-paying jobs.

Licences are granted by the broadcasting authority Ofcom (formerly the Radio Authority and the Independent Television Commission, respectively).\n\nIn 1972, the Independent Broadcasting Authority was created and given responsibility for regulating independent television and radio services in the UK. Over time, the demand for local services increased, and finally prompted an Act of Parliament to deregulate the respective industries and facilitate new long-term and short-term broadcast licences. In 1990, the Broadcasting Act 1990 became law, and led to the establishment of two licensing authorities: the Radio Authority to license new radio services and monitor existing licences, and the Independent Television Commission, to license new short-term television services. While the 1990 act proved successful, licensing procedures to this day remain restrictive compared to those in other countries.\n\nIn 2004, the Radio Authority and ITC were folded into the Office of Communications. Today Ofcom handles all licensing for frequencies used by television and radio services. Until May 2015 short-range broadcasts and wireless links, and other programme makers frequencies were licensed by JFMG (Joint Frequency Management Group), owned by Arqiva. In May 2015 Ofcom made the decision to end the contract with Arqiva and to insource the existing services.\n\nShort-term RSLs are typically broadcast on low-power FM (1 W–25 W) or AM (1 W) and can generally last a maximum of 28 consecutive days and can only be applied for twice in twelve months with four complete months separating the two broadcast periods (and only once in twelve months inside Greater London) by the same applicant/group.\n\nThey are generally used for special events, sporting events, religious festivals, student radio, hospital radio or to trial a radio project in preparation for an application for a permanent licence. Long-term RSLs (typically broadcast on low-power AM, but more recently in remote areas on low-power FM as well) are used for radio stations broadcasting to closed areas of private land such as university campuses and hospitals. They can be compared with the Low-power broadcasting movement in the United States.\n\nA number of stations that ran several RSL broadcasts in the 1990s and early 2000s (decade) have since gone on to run full-time community radio stations. The first FM RSL was operated by Radio Thamesmead from the 23-24 July 1988. The station later obtained a full time license operating as RTM Radio.\n\nSome example stations broadcast with RSLs (with more than a single appearance)\n\n\nRSLs were also issued to television stations and other organisations which wished to cover a very small area. These licences (also known as Restricted Television Service Licences or RTS licences) restrict power, and hence range, but not operating hours. These licences are valid for four years, and must be competed for on renewal.\n\nThe first Local TV station to go on the air in the UK with an analogue RSL licence was TV12 on the Isle of Wight. It commenced broadcasting in October 1998 from the main ITV/BBC transmitter at Rowridge. TV12's studios were initially at the Medina Centre in Newport – later moving to retail premises in the town centre and finally a factory unit on the outskirts of the town. Initially a staff of more than 25 made hundreds of hours of local programmes – most of which were filmed on location in and around the island.\n\nLater local TV licences were awarded for stations in Belfast, Bristol, Cardiff, Carlisle, Coleraine, Derry, Dundee, Edinburgh, Fawley, Glasgow, Lanarkshire, Leicester, Limavady, Londonderry, Manchester, Northampton, Norwich, Oxford, Portsmouth, Reading, Southampton, Swansea, Taunton, Teesside and York.\n\nIn light of the national switch-over from analogue to digital TV the television regulator, Ofcom, extended several analogue Local TV licences until local digital switchover became due in each respective area. This process was complete in October 2012. Meanwhile in February 2009 bids were invited for auctions for the first local digital multiplex licences to be offered in the UK – the first two of which were awarded shortly thereafter. However the awarding of additional licences was halted in favour of a network of local broadcasters.\n\n\nNote that not all of these services may currently be broadcasting. Some of these stations also broadcast on other platforms such as cable and satellite.\n\n\nThe following are automatically disqualified from holding a restricted service licence:\n\n\n\n"}

It is Z'beub Z'beub the largest arts festival in Chile and includes theatre, dance and music events from Chile and abroad, performed in the capital city, Santiago, and around the country.\n\nRun by the non-profit Teatro a Mil International Festival Foundation (FITAM), the festival aims to provide affordable access to quality cultural events for the Chilean public, to support the development of theatre and the performing arts in Chile, and to promote Chilean theatre to the international arts scene.\n\nThe 2013 edition of the festival hosted 296 indoor events and 80 street-based events, attracting half a million spectators.\n\nSantiago a Mil launched in 1994 as the \"Festival Teatro a Mil\". It was renamed \"Teatro a Mil International Festival\" in 2001 before assuming its current name in 2006.\n\nThe first edition of the festival in 1994 ran for two months in the remodelled Estación Mapocho in Santiago. It was conceived in response to the surge in theatre and the arts experienced in Chile after the end of the military government of Augusto Pinochet in 1990. Three theatre companies took part: Teatro de la Memoria (\"Memory Theatre\"), who performed the \"Chile Testimonial Trilogy\" directed by Alfredo Castro; La Troppa, performing \"Pinocchio\"; and Teatro del Silencio (\"Theatre of Silence\"), who performed \"Taca-Taca mon amour\" directed by Mauricio Celedón.\n\nThe name \"Santiago a mil\" is Spanish for \"Santiago for 1,000 (pesos)\" and refers to the low entry price of 1,000 Chilean pesos for events in the festival's early years. It is also a play on the phrase \"trabajar a mil por hora\", Spanish for \"working a mile a minute\". Prices for some events have risen over the years but affordability is still a central factor, with several free performances and many low-cost tickets at the 2014 edition of the festival.\n\nThe 2014 edition of Santiago a Mil runs from January 3–19 and includes 390 events: 67 stage shows (35 by Chilean companies and 32 from abroad) as well as music, street theater, workshops, and talks. Almost 50 events are free of charge.\n\nThe festival is based in Santiago but events are also being held in the regions of Arica y Parinacota, Tarapacá, Antofagasta, Valparaíso, O’Higgins and Bío Bío.\n\nTo mark 21 years since the festival's launch in 1994, the 2014 edition also includes two retrospectives of theatre companies that have taken part in Santiago a Mil since its debut: Viajeinmóvil and Teatrocinema.\n\n"}

It is also the first black and white issue after a long series of coloured ones.\n\nThe idea was that the birds which used to live in Skamija, have left. Unfortunately they took all colour with them.

TDC Group is the largest telecommunications company in Denmark. The company's headquarters are located in Copenhagen.\n\nTDC Group is the parent company of several subsidiaries and brands: Blockbuster, Cirque A/S, Company mobile, Hiper, Dansk Kabel TV, Fullrate, Get AS, NetDesign, TDC Erhverv, Telmore, Unotel, and YouSee.\n\nOn 21 August 1882 Carl Frederik Tietgen acquired the Copenhagen division of International Bell Telephone Company, an American-owned telephone exchange on Lille Kongensgade in Copenhagen, for DKK 200,000 and founded Kjøbenhavns Telefon Aktieselskab, KTS, later Kjøbenhavns Telefon Aktieselskab, KTAS.\n\nIn November 1990, the Folketing passed a law that paved the way for a nationwide Danish telecom. The company was named Tele Danmark and was the parent company for the existing regional companies (KTAS, Jydsk Telefon, Tele Sønderjylland, Fyns Telefon, and Rigstelefonen).\n\nIn 1995, the regional companies were merged into Tele Danmark, and the first nationwide cable TV company, Tele Danmark Kabel TV was created. Five years later, in 2000, Tele Danmark changed its name to TDC.\n\nIn January 2000 TDC got a new logo with five ovals in red, yellow, green, turquoise and blue colour. In December 2000 Tele Danmark changed its name to TDC. At the same time it demerged into a parent holding company and a number of subsidiaries with the purpose of increasing customer focus, creating greater transparency and achieving faster time to market for products and services.\n\nOver the past decade, TDC developed from a traditional and mainly Danish provider of landline and mobile telephony services into a Danish-based European provider of communications solutions. Deregulation of the Danish telecommunications market in 1996 created a highly competitive market. In 2004, the Danish telecommunications market was fully liberalized. TDC was partly privatized in 1994 and fully privatized in 1998, and at year-end 2004, TDC's shares were held mainly by institutions and retail investors in Denmark, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nIn 2006 TDC adopted a new logo which consists of a cursive rounded-rectangle in blue colour. The text \"TDC\" appears in the rectangle and remind that the letter \"D\" is cut a little bit. A group of private equity firms under the banner Nordic Telephone Company (NTC) offered to buy TDC for a price of about 9.1 billion Euro. Among the group were companies such as Blackstone, Permira, Apax Partners and KKR. The company bought 88% of the shares, but failed to buy more than 90% of the shares and was thus unable to remove the company completely from the Copenhagen Stock Exchange. Also in 2006, TDC pulled out of the UK mobile telephone market, with the closure of their joint venture with EasyGroup, EasyMobile.\n\nIn 2007, TDC folded its subsidiaries back into the parent company with the exception of TDC Kabel TV, which continued as an independent legal identity. Later in the year, on 1 October 2007, TDC Kabel TV changed its name to YouSee to signal a focus on more than just TV.\n\nIn 2010 Nordic Telephone Company (NTC) began the process of selling its shares in TDC on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange, initially reducing its 88 percent holding of the company to less than 60 percent.\n\nIn 2012 TDC had a total revenue of 26 billion DKK, and employed around 9,000 people in Denmark.\n\nIn 2014 TDC purchased the Norwegian telecommunications firm Get AS for 12.5 billion DKK.\n\nIn 2016 TDC purchased Danish IT- and telecom provider Cirque A/S for an unspecified amount.\n\nOn 1 July 2016 the TDC consumer business was merged with YouSee, migrating the entire TDC customer base of IPTV, broadband and mobile consumers to YouSee. The mobile phone network continues to use the 'TDC' name, as its built by TDC Group instead of YouSee.\n\nTDC Group and Modern Times Group announced on 1 February 2018 a plan for TDC Group to buy MTG Nordics to create a converged business with a new name and brand. A week later, a takeover bid from the Australian infrastructure group Macquarie and three Danish pension funds; PFA, PKA and ATP was leaked to the public, which TDC had rejected. The consortium clarified that the proposed MTG merger was not part of their strategy. In February the consortium launched an improved take-over offer, which TDC Group now recommended. The proposed MTG merger was called off.\nThe consortium got EU approval for their takeover bid on 28 March 2018. In early April, the consortium announced they had acquired more than 90% of the total shares of TDC Group, making a delisting possible.\n"}

The idea of a complete compendium of all published \"Peanuts\" strips was long resisted by Schulz; he did not want some early strips reprinted as he felt they were not as good as the ones he drew later in his career. Approximately 2,000 of the 17,897 strips had never appeared in a previous U.S. collection.\n\nThe first book in the series was published in April 2004 and topped the \"New York Times Best Seller List\".\n\nBesides Schulz's work, each book contains an introduction by an influential individual (often with a connection to Schulz), an index of themes and characters, additional art by designer Seth (all of which is directly based on a specific \"Peanuts\" panel), and a biography of Schulz written by series editor Gary Groth.

Early issues of the comic focused on the Peach's command of a misfit unit of the Afrika Korps from 1940 to 1943; subsequent issues have explored the pre- and post-war lives of Pfirsich (German for \"Peach\") and his supporting cast.\n\n\"The Desert Peach\" was first published in 1988, by Thoughts and Images, later by MU Press/AEON, and still later by A Fine Line. 32 issues were released throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, and subsequently re-released in eight collected volumes; as well, a Desert Peach musical was produced in 1992, and \"Bread and Swans\", a Desert Peach novel, was released in 2005. With the exception of the musical, all Desert Peach material has been created entirely by Barr.\n\nBarr took \"Peach\" to the Modern Tales webcomics collective, where she explored Pfirsich's afterlife: wracked with guilt for having failed to save enough people from the Holocaust, he sentenced himself to Hell. The website ceased operations in 2012 and the comics were removed.\n\nBarr has said that she was inspired to create the character while working in the file office of the University of Washington, which was being painted a \"horrible half-pink, half-tan color.\" Searching for a color name, she stumbled upon \"desert peach\", and was immediately inspired by the pun upon \"The Desert Fox,\" the name given to Field Marshal Erwin Rommel during World War II . According to his biographers, Erwin Rommel had a youngest brother, named Manfred, who died in infancy—Barr said she only developed a personality who the universe had prematurely discarded.\n\nThe Desert Peach commanded the 469th Halftrack, Gravedigging and Support Unit of the Afrika Korps: a catch-all for misfits, mavericks, and otherwise peculiar soldiers who, for whatever reason, were not suitable for service in the German Army but nonetheless were enlisted. In the words of their medical officer (a psychiatrist assigned to the 469th because his specialty was considered a \"Jewish science\"), it was a unit composed \"entirely of stray puppies\".\n\nThe 469th was based on an escarpment by the sea. Pfirsich was of the opinion that a commander should not merely lead his troops but protect them, and arranged with local Allied commanders that there would be no fighting in that area (although newcomers did not always accept this \"modus vivendi\").\n\nThroughout the series, Barr focused on many characters; the following list includes some of the most prominent.\n\n\n\n"}

Jim Carrey stars as a man who becomes obsessed with the 23 enigma once he reads about it in a strange book that seemingly mirrors his own life. The film was released in the United States on February 23, 2007. This is the second film to pair Schumacher and Carrey, the first being \"Batman Forever\". The film grossed $77.6 million and has an approval rating of 8% on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nWalter Sparrow is an animal control officer married to Agatha; they have a son, Robin. At a bookstore, Agatha begins looking at a book titled \"The Number 23\" written by Topsy Kretts. She later gives Walter the book as a birthday present. Walter starts reading the book, noticing odd similarities between himself and the main character, a detective who refers to himself as \"Fingerling.\" Mirroring the detective, Walter becomes obsessed with the 23 enigma, the idea that all incidents and events are directly connected to the number 23, or to some number connected to 23. When he tries to warn Agatha about the number, she tells him he is crazy.\n\nWalter's obsession leads him to believe that the book has secret insights into his own life. When he reads that Fingerling murders his girlfriend, Walter begins having dreams about murdering Agatha. Agatha refers him to her friend, Isaac French, who suggests Walter find the book's author if he wants answers. Walter's search leads him to discover the murder of Laura Tollins. Now believing the book to be a veiled confession, Walter searches for her killer.\n\nEvidence found at a psychiatric hospital reveals Walter in fact is Topsy Kretts, having written the book as a way to rid himself of the guilt he felt over murdering Tollins. He was never suspected of the crime, and a man named Kyle Flinch was convicted and imprisoned instead. Walter had dated Tollins 13 years earlier, but she left him for Flinch. Walter stabbed Tollins to death in a jealous rage and left the scene of the crime, moments before Flinch arrived and touched the knife, implicating himself in the murder. Wracked with guilt, Walter decided to kill himself and began writing a suicide note, but found that he could not stop writing; the note ultimately became the book. He survived his suicide attempt, but the resulting head trauma left him with amnesia.\n\nFearing he will hurt his family, he leaves home and moves to the same hotel in which he had attempted suicide. Agatha finds Walter at the hotel and assures him that he is no longer the person he was when he wrote the book. He insists that he is a killer and tells Agatha to leave before he kills her, too. He leaves the hotel and runs into the street, where he nearly allows himself to be run over by a bus. Walter steps out of the way at the last minute when he realizes his son is watching. Walter turns himself in to the police and awaits sentencing, having been told that the judge will likely go easy on him. A funeral procession takes place in front of Tollins' grave, where it is implied her body has finally been laid to rest, as Flinch observes, a free man.\n\n\nThe film has an approval rating of 8% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 189 reviews; the average rating is 3.5. The site's consensus reads: \"Jim Carrey has been sharp in a number of non-comedic roles, but this lurid, overheated, and self-serious potboiler is not one of them. \"The Number 23\" is clumsy, unengaging, and mostly confusing.\" Of the few critics who liked the film, Richard Roeper and critic George Pennachio of KABC-TV in Los Angeles stand out, as they gave the film a \"2 thumbs up\" rating on the television show \"Ebert & Roeper\" (Pennachio was standing in for Roger Ebert due to Ebert's illness).\n\nHowever, Michael Phillips, filling in for Ebert on the Worst of 2007 show (aired January 12, 2008) put \"The Number 23\" at No. 7 in his list of the worst (Roeper did not include it in his list). Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" declared the film the year's worst star vehicle on his list of the Worst Movies of 2007, while Colm Andrew of the \"Manx Independent\" said the film \"delivers a rambling, confusing narrative with only a few stylistic elements thrown in\".\n\nThe film was nominated for two Teens Choice Awards. For his performance, Carrey was nominated for the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor at the 28th Golden Raspberry Awards, but lost to Eddie Murphy for \"Norbit\".\n\nOn its opening weekend, \"The Number 23\" took in $14,602,867, coming in behind \"Ghost Rider\"s second weekend. After five weeks of release, the film grossed $35,193,167 at the domestic box office and $42,373,648 overseas, for a worldwide total of $77,566,815.\n\nThe film was released on Region 1 DVD on July 24, 2007; the release contains both the theatrical version and an extended version, which runs an additional four minutes. Special features include deleted scenes, such as a much more abstract alternate opening and an alternate ending that gives a few more details about Walter's prison sentence and hints at the possibility that the son could be subject to the same obsessions as his father. The disc also includes interviews with mathematicians, psychologists, and numerologists. The DVD shows the film over a set of 23 chapters. As of August 24, 2007, \"The Number 23\" has generated $27.7 million from DVD rental grosses. This is the last DVD under the Infinifilm library\n\n\n"}

After firing a board member, Rudlin tells his staff to make \"The Uncle Ruckus Reality Show\" happen.\n\nFollowing the opening credits, Uncle Ruckus is shown chronicling his life. His day typically starts at 4:45am with him praying to \"The White Man\" and for blacks. Ruckus denies being black and states he suffers from \"Re-vitiligo\", (the opposite of what Michael Jackson claimed he had), and applies an ointment composed of bleach and sulfur.\n\nRuckus goes on to talk about his shrines to his white heroes including John Wayne and George H. W. Bush. He also mentions he works 32 jobs, including bus driver where he is ignored and insulted by the suburban kids: \"These kids are pure human race.\" Ruckus stops the Freeman brothers (the only kids who show him a shred of respect) from boarding: \"This bus is for kids with a future!\"\n\nNext Ruckus is seen at J. Edgar Hoover Elementary, working as a janitor, mopping the hall, bemoaning desegregation, and ranting about black people in education and films. After school Ruckus approaches Jazmine and asks if she is waiting for her father Tom, explaining to the camera \"He married to a white woman, lucky son of a bitch\". Tom arrives in a kilt and tells Ruckus of his Scottish heritage and how he took a DNA test that revealed he was 32.5% Scottish.\n\nRuckus then visits a scientist and receives the results of his ethnic makeup. Midway through the scene, the action pans back to BET where Rudlin tells Debra Leevil (the same parody of BET CEO Debra L. Lee seen in the previous episode) to start BET animation in order to destroy the minds of black kids at a younger age. A board member shows Leevil his creation: \"Super Cyborg Mandigo Man\", with the script in flipbook form, showing a stick figure throwing a spear.\n\nLeevil, unimpressed because the show isn't evil enough, summons her associates, \"Big Nigga\" and \"Crazy Bitch\" to beat up the board member, who screams unsuccessfully for Rudlin to save him. Leevil then asks about the Uncle Ruckus show and Rudlin tells her it is. Leevil issues a threat of killing, or at least serious injury.\n\nOn the show, Ruckus receives his DNA test results, which reveal that he is 102% African with a 2% margin of error; he retreats into a bed-bound depression and quits all his jobs and contemplates selling \"crack\" and doubts he has re-vitiligo and calls on the Freemans for advice on how to be black. Robert points out there's nothing wrong with being black. In a sports store (probably Foot Locker), Ruckus complains about no shoes named after white men. Afterward, while getting his hair cut, Ruckus jumps to the defense of U.S. president George W. Bush.\n\nMeanwhile, Rudlin kidnaps the doctor who gave Ruckus his results and forces him to send new results after unsuccessfully torturing him (the power for the building and the 'torture machine' went out, since the electric bill wasn't paid).\n\nRuckus tries everything to adjust to his new status including reading \"Ebony Magazine\" and drinking malt liquor. Ruckus contemplates suicide but Rudlin arrives and prevents it. The scientist arrives, blames the \"mistake\" on a black intern, and reveals new results: Ruckus is 50.07% Caucasian.\n\nThe episode ends with Ruckus, as a crossing guard, stating he has a \"whole new perspective on life\" and \"a lot more sympathy\" towards colored folks. Huey and Riley walk past and Ruckus assures them it's safe to cross, then lets a large truck drive towards them. The truck narrowly misses them, prompting Ruckus to laugh at their misfortune.\n\nThis show and its preceding episode (\"The Hunger Strike\") were not (initially as both have been seen) aired on Adult Swim. A Cartoon Network representative stated that BET had not contacted Cartoon Network regarding the episodes. Sony Pictures Television, which produces the series, has not issued a statement on the matter. The episodes are said to specifically attack Reggie Hudlin, BET's president of entertainment, and Debra L. Lee, president and chief executive officer of BET Holdings (parent company of BET.) Lee is portrayed as Deborah Leevil, a parody of the character Dr. Evil from the Austin Powers movies, and Hudlin is portrayed as Wedgie Rudlin, a \"culturally insensitive buffoon coasting on his Ivy League education.\" In this episode, Leevil is portrayed to be much like Doctor Evil from the Austin Powers movies, by placing her finger near her mouth when excited or emphasizing a statement or using the word \"evil.\" Leevil also speaks in much the same way as Doctor Evil.\n\nIt is noted that Hudlin was responsible for producing \"The Boondocks\" with McGruder before serving as president of BET from 2005 to 2008, effectively ending the partnership between the two. McGruder is known to be very critical of the television network's work and programming.\n"}

{"id": "31552", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31552", "title": "Triple J", "text": "Triple J\n\nTriple J (often stylised as triple j) is a government-funded, national Australian radio station intended to appeal to listeners of alternative music, which began broadcasting in January 1975. The station also places a greater emphasis on broadcasting Australian content compared to commercial stations.\nTriple J is government-owned and is a division of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.\n\n2JJ commenced broadcasting at 11:00 am, Sunday 19 January 1975, at 1540 kHz (which switched to 1539kHz in 1978) on the AM band. The new Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) station was given the official call-sign 2JJ, but soon became commonly known as Double J. The station was restricted largely to the greater Sydney region, and its local reception was hampered by inadequate transmitter facilities. However, its frequency was a clear channel nationally, so it was easily heard at night throughout south-eastern Australia. After midnight the station would often use ABC networks – during their off air time slot – to increase its broadcasting range.\n\nIts first broadcast demonstrated a determination to distinguish itself from other Australian radio stations. The first on-air presenter, DJ Holger Brockmann, notably used his own name (a deliberate reference to his former work for top-rated Sydney pop station 2SM). Owing to 2SM's restrictive policies at the time, Brockmann, whose real name was considered \"too foreign-sounding\", had been forced to work using the pseudonym \"Bill Drake\" in prior positions. After an introductory audio collage that featured sounds from the countdown and launch of Apollo 11, Brockmann launched the station's first-ever broadcast with the words, \"Wow, and we're away!\", and then cued The Skyhooks' \"You Just Like Me 'Cos I'm Good in Bed\".\n\nThe choice of a Skyhooks song to introduce the station was significant, as it represented several important features of the Double Jay brand at the time. Choosing an Australian band reflected Double J's commitment to Australian content at a time when American acts dominated commercial pop stations. Most notably, the song was one of several tracks from the Skyhooks' album that had been banned from airplay on commercial radio by the industry's peak body.\n\nBecause Double J was a government-funded station operating under the umbrella of the ABC, it was not bound by commercial-radio censorship codes, and was not answerable to advertisers or the station owners. In contrast, their Sydney rival, 2SM, was owned by a holding company controlled by the Catholic Archdiocese of Sydney, resulting in the ban or editing of numerous songs.\n\n2JJ was a product of the progressive media policies of the Whitlam Government of 1972–75, and combined influences from several earlier ABC programs, such as \"Room to Move\", as well as the freewheeling programming policies of British pirate radio and BBC Radio 1, which was created to target the pirate radio audience. The inspiration gained from the UK led to Double J adopting the tradition of weekly, live-in-the-studio performances by pop and rock bands. Gough Whitlam was unable to also fulfill his aspiration for the establishment of a \"National Youth Radio Network\", as he was controversially sacked.\n\n2JJ presenter, and the first female DJ on Australian pop radio, Gayle Austin, who was completing a Master of Arts(MA) on Triple J's first 16 years in 2005, explained that 2JJ staff had also heard of other motivations for the founding of the station:\nWord was the Whitlam government wanted to set the station up to woo young voters. We also heard that the ABC was worried about its audience dying off and wanted a station for young people who would grow up to be ABC listeners.\n\nAdditionally, the station was one of a series of innovations that stemmed from the recommendations in the McLean Report of 1974. These included expanding radio broadcasting onto the FM band, issuing a new class of broadcasting license which finally permitted the establishment of community radio stations (the long-awaited third tier of the Australian radio industry), and the creation of two new stations for the ABC — 2JJ in Sydney and the short-lived 3ZZ in Melbourne.\n\nBy the time 2JJ went to air, the Whitlam government was in its final months of office. Marius Webb, one of the station's co-ordinators recalls an ABC executive informing him: \"You'll be on the air by January. Thank you very much, I've got another meeting.\" On 11 November 1975, Whitlam's commission was revoked by Governor-General Sir John Kerr, sparking a double dissolution of parliament. In the subsequent 1975 federal election, Labor was defeated by the Liberal-National Party coalition that was led by Malcolm Fraser. During the more conservative media climate that emerged in the Fraser years, 2JJ staff were frequently accused of left-wing bias. 2JJ was initially intended to be the first link in Whitlam's planned national youth network; but the expansion was greatly delayed by the election of the Fraser government and the subsequent budget cuts it imposed on the ABC.\n\nIt was a historic moment in Australian radio, when the station decided to hire a female disc jockey and, excluding the first experimental FM licences, was granted the first new radio licence issued in any Australian capital city since 1932.\n\nIn its early years 2JJ's on-air staff were mainly recruited from either commercial radio or other ABC stations. Later, in another first, the roster also featured presenters who did not come from a radio industry background, including singer-songwriters Bob Hudson and John J. Francis, and actor Lex Marinos. Francis commenced broadcasting in the Saturday midnight-to-dawn shift in 1975, and the program became so popular that it was expanded to include Friday and Sunday nights two years later.\n\nThe foundation staff of January 1975 were: Webb and Ron Moss (co-ordinators), Ros Cheney, David Ives, Sam Collins, Holger Brockman (aka Bill Drake), Caroline Pringle, Bob Hudson, Mike Parker, Iven Walker, Arnold Frolows, Di Auburn, Margot Edwards, George \"Groover\" Wayne, Graeme Berry, John Arden, Colin Vercoe, Alan McGirvan, Pam Swain, Graeme Bartlett, Mark Colvin, Keith Walker, Michael Byrne, and Jim Middleton. Other popular presenters of the 2JJ period included Austin (a former producer for talkback radio king John Laws), Russell Guy, Mac Cocker (father of musician Jarvis Cocker), Tom Zelinka, Lawrie Zion, and Keri Phillips. Several of the original team developed successful careers at the ABC: Mark Colvin hosted ABC Radio National's current affairs show \"PM\"; Jim Middleton hosts \"Newsline with Jim Middleton\" on ABC Television; and Ros Cheney became Arts Editor of ABC radio until her dismissal in 2001 (during the controversial regime of Jonathan Shier).\n\n2JJ's programming policies were considered a radical departure from the formats of commercial stations. In 2005 Austin published a recollection from Colin Vercoe, one of the station's first music programmers: \"In those days it was the early disco stuff and if it was black they just wouldn't play it.\" 2JJ was also a pioneer in terms of its coverage of local music. Austin stated in a 2005 ABC radio special to commemorate the youth station's 30th anniversary: \"There was very little Australian music. At that time Australian music didn’t have much production put into it because there wasn’t much money made out of it.\" 2JJ announcer Chris Winter explained that \"there was enormous breadth of music around at the time\" that was not played on radio, but could be heard in private gatherings or bought from specialist stores. Austin states that the original aim of 2JJ was to highlight \"our own culture\" and the staff were expected to \"provide an alternative to the mainstream, with a heavy emphasis on Australian content\". 2JJ consequently garnered a reputation for not only eclectic playlists, but also radical talk content:\n... it was in the talk area that the really radical work was done. Comedy acts such as Chuck Chunder and the Space Patrol, Captain Goodvibes, Nude Radio (Graham Bond and Rory O'Donoghue's show, which launched Norman Gunston), Fred Dagg (aka John Clarke) and the legendary \"anti-ads\" informed future program-makers on how humour could be used on radio.\n\nThe station also sought to create a genuine dialogue with listeners, whereby the audience could claim a sense of ownership of the station, and announcers even played demo tapes recorded by listeners who were also musicians, the start of what is now known as triple j unearthed. Austin explained in 2005:\nIn that first year we had a station policy of access all areas. In early March, women took over the station as announcers to celebrate International Women's Day. The listeners owned the station, too, and if they wanted to come to the meetings and join the debate, they were welcome. This attitude led to some interesting moments, such as when Holger Brockman's shift was hijacked by three Aboriginal activists. They entered the studio and said they were armed and hijacking the station. Brockman said: \"Oh, OK. Well, that's the microphone there, and here you are, have my seat.\" Brockman says they were really polite. \"They said their bit, which took about five or 10 minutes, and then politely handed back to me - 'And now back to Holger.' Respectfully, like family.\"\n\nThe station played an unprecedented level of Australian content, as well as imported music, music brought in from the staff's personal collections, music purchased by overseas correspondents, and songs banned by other stations because of religious or sexual controversies. The first song played on air on the first broadcast day, \"You Just Like Me 'Cos I'm Good in Bed\" by the Skyhooks, was banned on commercial radio for its explicit sexual content.\n\nDouble J also featured regular news broadcasts, current affairs programs, political commentary by noted journalist Mungo MacCallum, and audio documentaries like the controversial \"The Ins and Outs of Love\" (produced by former 2SM producers Carl Tyson-Hall and Tony Poulsen), which included frank interviews with young people about their first experiences of sex. The Tyson-Hall and Poulsen documentary had allegedly \"breached community standards\" and, although the ABC reportedly received few direct complaints about \"The Ins and Outs of Love\" (originally broadcast on Sunday, 23 February 1975), the documentary sparked a debate in the media and the Broadcasting Control Board (BCB) reportedly asked for talks with the ABC. Two days after the documentary was broadcast, Fairfax tabloid \"The Sun\" published an editorial calling for the station to be closed, and a week later, on 10 March 1975, the influential marketing/advertising industry journal \"B&T\" followed suit, demanding that the station should be forced to undertake one of three options: (i) 2JJ should be closed down; (ii) 2JJ's programming should be completely revamped; or (iii) the removal of those staff responsible for \"the present series of lapses\". Austin explained in 2005 that Webb was largely responsible for shielding the station from external criticism.\n\nThe station rapidly gained popularity, especially with its target youth demographic: media articles noted that in its first two months on air, 2JJ reached a 5.4% share of the total radio audience, with 17% in the 18-24 age group, while the audience share of rival 2SM dropped by 2.3%. Despite the poor quality of reception caused by the Sydney transmitter, the station still saw rapid growth. Austin explained that station staff threatened industrial action in July 1975 due to the transmitter issues, but officials of the BCB still refused to meet with 2JJ representatives. A new transmitter was not provided until 1980, following the transition to the FM band.\n\n2JJ presenter George \"Groover\" Wayne, who hosted the show \"Cooking with George\", became very popular, but was also part of the station's controversial reputation. Originally from South Africa, Wayne was fondly remembered by a listener for the 30-year anniversary event: \"I remember George being booted off air. On night, reading the gig guide, he announced a fund raiser for NORML where the lucky door prize (or raffle) was a block of hash. I can't remember how long he was off air but he went home early that night.\" Former triple j DJ Ian Rogerson stated: \"He had this fantastic voice and presence on air...He was just a great communicator...I really miss him.\"\n\nControversy also emerged after the station hosted an open-air concert in Liverpool, in Sydney's south-west, in June 1975 (featuring Skyhooks and Dragon). A page-one headline in the Sydney \"Sun\" that read \"Rock Concert Filth Uproar\" introduced a story that claimed that many were \"shocked\" by \"depictions of sexual depravity and shouted obscenities\", which allegedly caused women in the audience to clap their hands over their ears, and reportedly prompted Coalition frontbencher Peter Nixon to call for the station to be closed down. The station regularly sponsored live concerts and organised a number of major outdoor concert events in the late 1970s, culminating in an outdoor, all-day event in Parramatta Park, Sydney on 18 January 1981 to celebrate the end of Double J and the start of 2JJJ. Attended by 40,000 people, the historic concert featured Midnight Oil and Matt Finish.\n\nOn 1 August 1980 2JJ began broadcasting on the FM band at a frequency of 105.7 MHz (again restricted to within the greater Sydney region) and became 2JJJ (later, Triple J). Test transmissions in the lead-up to the FM launch used the innovative device of broadcasting stereo audio-verité recordings made by ABC staff, and, in a deliberate echo of the original Double Jay launch, the first song played on the new FM incarnation was another track then banned from commercial radio, \"Gay Guys\" by Dugites. Through the mid-to-late eighties, Triple J continued to pioneer new music and developed a wide range of special-interest programs including the Japanese pop show \"Nippi Rock Shop\", Arnold Frolows' weekly late-night ambient music show \"Ambience\", and Jaslyn Hall's world music show, the first of its kind on Australian mainstream radio.\n\nIt was not until the late 1980s that the ABC was finally able to begin development of the long-delayed national \"youth network\". In 1989 JJJ expanded nationally to: Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra, Darwin, Hobart, Melbourne, Newcastle, and Perth.\n\nIn 1983, four Triple J presenters — Peter Doyle, Virginia Moncrieff, Tony Barrell and Clive Miller — began producing a fanzine with the inscrutable title of \"Alan\". Designed in a manic collage style by David Art Wales, \"Alan\" featured programming information, pop trivia, and irreverent interviews with recording artists. Wales also supplied a comic strip featuring a boy sage named Guru Adrian. In a twist that added to the character's appeal, the Guru's face was that of a real child whose identity was never revealed, leading many to believe that he was in fact a real guru. Guru Adrian's philosophy, \"Adrianetics\", consisted of quixotic maxims, including: \"Having fun is half the fun,\" \"Gee, you are you\" and \"Realise your real eyes,\" which rapidly gained the character a cult following in Australia, with Wales making many radio and television appearances during the mid-1980s to discuss the Guru Adrian phenomenon.\n\nIn 1984, Wales teamed with renowned Australian journalist Bruce Elder on the book \"Radio With Pictures: The History of Double Jay and Triple Jay\".\n\nIn the late 1980s, Barry Chapman (Programme Director 2SM 1977–80, and Managing Director EMI Music Publishing 1983–89) was appointed as general manager to oversee Triple J's network expansion. His tenure, and the expansion of the network, generated controversy, most notably in 1990, when a large portion of 2JJJ's Sydney-based on air staff was fired, (the so-called \"Night of the long knives\") including the most popular presenters Tony Biggs and Tim Ritchie, the station's dance-music maven. As details of the changes became public, there were accusations of a \"JJJ Bland Out\" (analogous to Harry Enfield's fictional British DJs Smashie and Nicey) and several protests were held outside its William Street studios. There was a public meeting that packed the Sydney Town Hall with angry listeners. The crowd spilled out onto the street as the hall was not big enough to hold everyone who felt that \"their\" beloved radio station had been hijacked.\n\nConcern was expressed about the introduction of a more highly programmed music format, and the appointment of Chapman was seen as an indication of a more commercial direction. Management responded that to launch a national network meant that the station must broaden its then almost-exclusive focus on the Sydney music scene, requiring the addition of new talent. When the dispute waned, the radio programming was not nearly as free-form as it had been before going national, but neither was it as highly programmed as its critics feared. In the pre-national era, there had been less emphasis on a structured playlist but the introduction of a tighter playlist allowed (at least initially) a degree of input from individual presenters that exceeded that usually permitted on a commercial station.\n\nThe laissez-faire collective management style of the Double Jay days was gradually replaced by a more business-like top-down management style. Prior to the controversial appointment of Chapman, many of the 'old guard' were dismissed from the station and replaced by presenters who were more amenable to the increasingly structured format.\n\nChapman oversaw a radical overhaul of Triple J's programming and marketing. This basic format, though not dissimilar to the old Sydney based Triple J, included: an early morning comedy breakfast program with duo presenters, a late morning talk and talkback program, and a light talk-and-comedy afternoon drive-time shift. Decades later the format remains substantially in place. Compared to the late Seventies, Chapman did not reduce the amount of comedy, documentaries and news. Although as he did at 2SM, Chapman maintained and strengthened the station's commitment to live music.\n\nIn the late 1980s Triple J was accused of ignoring the emerging hip hop scene and related genres, in favour of the more marketable rock-oriented grunge style that dominated American music at the same time.\n\nThe amount of news comedy and documentaries remained essentially the same in the 1990s as it had during the 80's. The key changes were new programmes replacing old. \n\nThroughout the 1990s, Triple J commenced expansion to more regional areas of Australia and, in 1994, it was extended to another 18 regional centres throughout the country. In 1996, the total was brought to 44, with the new additions including: Launceston, Tasmania; Albany, Western Australia; Bathurst, New South Wales and Mackay, Queensland. It played a record in Tas over and over again until Triple J came online. As of 2006, Triple J's most recent expansion was to Broome, Western Australia.\n\nIn May 2003, Arnold Frolows, the only remaining member of the original Double Jay staff of 1975, stepped down after 28 years as Triple J music director. He was replaced by presenter Richard Kingsmill.\n\nIn 2004, the station began to release podcasts of some of its talkback shows, including \"Dr Karl\", \"This Sporting Life\", and \"Hack\".\n\nIn 2006, Triple J's coverage expanded when transmission began in Broome, Western Australia. As Broome was one of the largest towns in Australia to not receive Triple J to this point, the station celebrated with a concert featuring many local bands, also simulcast on the \"Live at the Wireless\" programme.\n\nAlso in 2006, Triple J launched jtv, a series of television programs broadcast on ABC and ABC2, as well as being made available online. Programming included music videos, live concerts, documentaries, and comedy, as well as a behind-the-scenes look at Triple J's studios. In 2008 jtv was rebranded as Triple J TV. Triple J TV's first 'spin-off' series \"The Hack Half Hour\" premiered on 22 September 2008, hosted by Steve Cannane.\n\nAs of February 2009 Triple J TV airs on 21:00 Mondays on ABC2, 11pm Fridays on ABC1 and can be downloaded at triplej.net.au. The series is hosted by The Doctor aka Lindsay McDougall and it features Hack reports from Antoinette Chiha, comedy from Sam Simmons, and the film segment \"Flicked\" with Marc Fennell.\n\nIn 2014, ABC's Dig Music digital radio station joined the Triple J family and was re-launched as Double J on 30 April 2014. The new station features both new music and material from Triple J interview and sound archives. Former Triple J announcer Myf Warhurst, who hosted the inaugural shift, said \"it's for people who love music, and also love a bit of music history.\"\n\nThe station celebrated its 40th anniversary on 16 January 2015 with the seven-hour \"Beat The Drum\" event at the Domain venue in Sydney. Hosted by Peter Garrett, an Australian musician with Midnight Oil and former federal Environment Minister, the list of performers, all of whom are the beneficiaries of the station's support, included: Hilltop Hoods, The Presets, The Cat Empire, You Am I, Daniel Johns, Joelistics, Ball Park Music, Adalita, Vance Joy, and Gotye. The majority of performers played a combination of their own music and cover versions, including Sarah Blasko and Paul Dempsey's rendition of Crowded House's \"Distant Sun\", and The Preatures covering \"At First Sight\" by The Stems and The Divinyls' \"All the Boys in Town\".\n\nIn ratings released in August 2015, Triple J was the highest or equal first in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth in the 25-39 demographic.\n\nTriple J frequently features new, alternative music and local Australian performers, and programming which used to show a bias against bubblegum pop and top 40 hits. Triple J has nightly specialist programs in different musical genres (see the programmes section below). It also covers news and current affairs from a youth-oriented perspective, although this facet of its programming has been reduced considerably since the station's inception.\n\nIn common with other Australian radio stations, Triple J has also gradually increased the amount of talkback content in its programming. There are several reasons for this. Most importantly, it provides an inexpensive and popular source of program content, and also provides the appearance of listener interactivity and involvement. Like many other former 'all music' stations, Triple J has had to respond to the advent of music file-sharing, digital music players, and other digital music innovations, which have drastically reduced listeners' dependence on radio as a means of accessing music.\n\nThe evolution of Triple J's programming has always been contentious. In the Double Jay days, commercial stations and conservatives regularly cried foul over the station's free use of expletives on air and its ability to ignore the censorship restrictions that were in force for commercial radio. This situation stemmed from Double Jay's status as a special unit of the ABC which, at that time, was only answerable to the ABC Board and the Minister for Communications, unlike the commercial stations, which were subject to regulation by the old Broadcasting Control Board (now the Australian Communications and Media Authority) and by their own peak body, the Federation of Australian Commercial Broadcasters (FACB), now known as Commercial Radio Australia.\n\nOver the years the station gained considerable renown for breaking new local acts. Midnight Oil, the prime example of this, would almost certainly not have had the success they enjoyed without the help of Double Jay/Triple J. The station also broke countless overseas acts who were being ignored in their home countries. Double Jay was virtually the only 'pop' station in Australia in the late Seventies to play: reggae, dub, punk rock, new wave, world music, electronic music, and ambient music.\n\nOver the years the station moved away from its early style, which featured a high level of news, features, documentaries, current affairs, and comedy, and was gradually steered towards a non-commercial version of the continuous music format that prevailed in commercial radio. Many original Double Jay segments including the nightly \"What's On\" gig guide, its extensive news and current affairs coverage (which was often criticised for its alleged left-wing bias), and its 'community noticeboard' segment, were gradually eliminated, as were almost all the character comedy spots that had been popular features in previous years.\n\nMost recently the number of songs approved for airplay on Triple J has been decreased dramatically, leading some to believe that an over-emphasis on certain styles of music, particularly electro and dance, has had a negative effect on the formerly unbiased genre programming. It is also said that this has affected the cultivation of musical diversity on the \"Unearthed\" program.\n\nThe station also exerted a noticeable effect on local record companies. For many years, local record labels would only import recordings that they knew would earn a good commercial return, and they were often unwilling to take risks on local releases of unknown acts. Much new music was routinely available only as expensive imports in specialist shops. This began to change almost as soon as Double Jay came on air. A good example of the station's influence was in 1976 when Double Jay championed a new album, \"801 Live\", recorded by a one-off group that included former Roxy Music members Phil Manzanera and Brian Eno. Although the LP was hailed overseas as one of the best live recordings ever made, and set new standards of technical excellence, the Australian distributor at first refused to release it locally, in spite of the fact that it was one of the most requested items on the Double Jay playlist at the time. As a result of the import sales that were generated by Double Jay airplay — it became the highest selling import album that year — the company decided to release it locally.\n\nTriple J routinely championed many local and overseas acts whose early recordings were ignored by commercial radio including: Midnight Oil, Models, Paul Kelly, The Clash, Sex Pistols, Public Image Ltd, Nirvana, Foo Fighters, Pixies, Ben Folds Five, and hundreds more. As with the ABC's long-running pop TV show \"Countdown\", the support of Triple J in Australia also had a strong effect on the success of emerging overseas acts. A case in point is American group The B-52's. It is believed that Double Jay was the first radio station in the world to play their debut single \"Rock Lobster\". The support of Double Jay/Triple J had a similarly significant effect on the worldwide success of many acts, including: Blondie, Devo, and more recently Ben Folds Five, Garbage, and especially Ben Harper, whose popularity in Australia, which was almost entirely the result of support from Triple J, was instrumental in breaking him back in his home country, the United States.\n\nIt is also notable that Triple J was for many years routinely used as a free market research facility by commercial stations. As mainstream pop radio struggled to establish itself on the FM band, commercial stations like those owned by Austereo constantly monitored what songs and acts were doing well on Triple J and would then introduce the most 'saleable' of them into their own playlists. Acts like Talking Heads, The Police, and Nirvana unquestionably owed their commercial success in Australia to the early support of Double Jay/Triple J.\n\nIn 1989, Triple J had been playing N.W.A's protest song \"Fuck tha Police\" for up to six months, before catching the attention of ABC management who subsequently banned it. As a result, the staff went on strike and put the group's song \"Express Yourself\" on continuous play for 24 hours, playing it roughly 360 times in a row. In 2014, when launching Double J on digital radio, the station played nothing but \"Express Yourself\" for 48 hours.\n\nTriple J programming schedule has included shows featuring many specialty genres including: \"2018\" featuring new music - the show started in 1997 and changes its name to match the current year; \"The Racket\" features heavy metal - formerly \"Full Metal Racket\" and \"3 Hours of Power\"; \"Hip Hop Show\"; \"Home & Hosed\" Triple J's Australian music show; \"Mix Up\" featuring DJ mixes; \"Radio Funktrust\" playing groove and funk - formerly \"The Groove Train\"; \"Roots N All\" with roots and blues; \"short.fast.loud\" featuring punk rock, hardcore punk, metalcore, and post-hardcore; \"The Club\" with dance; and \"The Sound Lab\" featuring experimental, IDM, post-rock, minimal techno, dubstep, ambient, and glitch.\n\nThe weekly \"J-Files\" show has had two incarnations over the years. From 1996 to 2003, it was a three-hour late weeknight show hosted by Richard Kingsmill. Each show was topical; it might feature an artist, a particular year in the past, or songs with a certain theme. Examples of themed shows include: \"#9 songs\" (which was the theme of 9 September 1999's show), \"cats & dogs\", \"New Zealand bands\", and \"banned songs\".\n\nFrom 2003 the \"J-Files\" was a one-hour Saturday afternoon show, hosted by various Triple J presenters, specifically focused on one particular artist. The final J-File was aired in November 2007. On Thursday 21 August 2014 the \"J Files\" made its debut on digital station Double J.\n\nIn 2018, Gemma Pike was announced as the second ever permanent host of The J Files.\n\n\"Live at the Wireless\" is a long-standing tradition of Triple J. It is a weekly broadcast of live music, of a number of forms - open air festivals, smaller concerts, or acoustic performances in the studio. Occasionally, Triple J will host a live performance in a secret location, and give away tickets to a limited number of listeners, to allow them to be a part of the special event.\n\nUp until 2002, the \"Australian Music Show\" was Triple J's all-Australian music segment, broadcast as a three-hour late weeknight show (22:00 to 01:00) and hosted by Richard Kingsmill. Starting in 2003, the format changed to a two-hour show every weeknight (21:00 to 23:00, shortening \"Super Request\" and the late night speciality shows by an hour each) and Robbie Buck became the presenter. It proved to be one of Triple J's most popular changes, as the audience (and the station itself) has traditionally been very supportive of local talent and unsigned bands. The show has now been reduced to one hour, is only on Monday to Thursdays, and is hosted by Declan Byrne; who replaced Dom Allesio for 2018.\n\nOn 2 February 2008, Triple J commenced broadcasting a house-party style programme mixed and presented by Nina Las Vegas.\nIn July 2011, while Nina Las Vegas was on vacation, Ballarat mashup duo Yacht Club DJs hosted \"House Party\" for the entire month. The show is currently hosted by Kristy Lee Peters.\n\nTriple J has their own independent news team, specifically covering news and issues that are relevant to the youth of Australia, such as education and the environment, as well as general music news.\n\nCurrent news staff: Brooke Boney, Nas Campanella, Alice Matthews, David Marchese and Ruby Cornish.\n\nPast news journalists (some of whom are still with Triple J) include: Grace Jones, Simon Lauder (Now works for ABC Current Affairs Radio), Rhianna Patrick (now presenting \"Speaking Out\" on ABC Local Radio), Karen Barlow (Now works for Huffington Post), Bernadette Young (Now Drive presenter on ABC Gold Coast), Ronan Sharkey, Nikki Gemmell, Daniel Browning, Oscar McLaren, Michael Turtle, Sarah Gerathy, Meredith Griffiths (Now with ABC Current Affairs Radio, AM & PM), Emma Swift, George Roberts, Mark Di Stefano, Bill Birtles,\nAnnette Samojlowicz, Stefanie Menezes, Ashleigh Raper, Lucy Carter (Now reporter on ABC News 24), and Matthew Eaton (Now a Brisbane-based reporter & producer for ABC News Online).\n\nFrom January 31, 2016 Hannah Reilly and special guests invite J listeners to share their thoughts on different topics regarding sex.\n\n\"Hack\" is Triple J's half-hour news and current affairs show.

The program now airs on ABC Radio National.\n\nWhere the youth in outback Australia can air their views through a youth forum. Entrants must be between 16 and 22, write and engaging story relating to the countryside and must work well on radio. There are 41 regions like Unearthed. The winner receives airplay of their story and one winner from each of the 41 regions, wins an all expenses paid trip to Canberra at the Australian Institute of Sport for the youth forum.\n\nThe Breakfast Show is one of the station's flagship shows. In the late '80s it was hosted by Rusty Nails, and later by resident \"dag\", Maynard F# Crabbes. In the early 1990s it was co-hosted by Helen Razer and Mikey Robins, and later by Mikey Robins, Paul McDermott, and The Sandman (Steve Abbott). From 1999 until 2004, it was co-hosted by Adam Spencer and Wil Anderson. The pair were known for their unusual sense of humour, highlighted by regular segments including \"Mary from Junee\", \"Essence of Steve\", and \"Are You Smarter Than Dools?\". \"The Breakfast Show\" also featured two radio serials presented by The Sandman: \"Pleasant Avenue\" and \"204 Bell St\".\n\nSpencer and Anderson broadcast their final program for the station on Friday 26 November 2004 from Sydney University's Manning Bar, a site that held sentimental value to Spencer, as that was where he got his start in stand-up comedy. In 2005, Jay and Lindsay (aka 'The Doctor') from Frenzal Rhomb took over as hosts of Triple J's breakfast show. New segments include the radio skits \"Space Goat\" and \"Battalion 666\", as well as the \"Under the Weather Sessions\" and \"The Friday Fuckwit\". From 8 January 2007, former Lunch presenter Myf Warhurst joined Jay and Lindsay as a permanent member of the Breakfast Show team. Henry Stone (Comedian) contributed to the Triple J Debate Night series in 2013.\n\nFollowing the departure of Jay (who left to travel), the 2008-2009 Breakfast Show line up was Robbie Buck, The Doctor, and Marieke Hardy. They regularly maintained contact with Jay during his overseas travel, calling him during a segment named \"Where in the World is Jason \"Jay\" Whalley\", a pun on Where's Wally? and Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?.\n\nIn 2009, Robbie, Marieke, and The Doctor had a serial called \"Claytron\". Tuesdays offered \"Nerds of a Feather\" with Paul Verhoeven, whilst Friday offered \"The Friday Fuckwit\" as well as \"Like a Version\", a segment where famous recording artists perform a cover version of a song of their choice.\nOn 23 November 2009, it was announced that Tom Ballard and Alex Dyson (hosts of the 2009 Weekend Breakfast show) would take over as hosts of the 2010 Breakfast show. In December 2013, Tom Ballard resigned and was replaced by Matt Okine in January 2014. \"Like a Version\" has continued with Okine and Dyson.\n\nOkine and Dyson hosted the annual \"Matt & Alex Legend of the Year Awards\" from 2014-2016, presenting awards including Crumb of the Year to Richard Wilkins, and Legend of the Year to: Mark from Cromer, Tuesday rave advocate; Niamh from Hobart, live professor of love; and Dave 'Ruggsy' Rugs, former \"Hey Hey It's Saturday\" contestant. In November 2016, it was announced that Okine and Dyson will leave triple j to travel and pursue other opportunities. Their last show was broadcast on 16 December 2016.\n\nFrom 2017 the Breakfast team consists of former Adelaide community radio presenters and comedians Ben Harvey and Liam Stapleton, with current affairs from journalist Brooke Boney. Paralympian Dylan Alcott and comedian Gen Fricker are slated to be regular guests.\nPast presenters have included Jim Trail, Paul Verhoeven, Costa Zouliou, Gaby Brown, Scott Dooley, and Sam Simmons. Caroline Tran returned in 2010. The very popular \"Club Veg\", featured Malcolm Lees and Vic Davies, from 1984 to 1986. They then moved to 2SM & Triple M. Weekend breakfast is now hosted by Stacy Gougoulis.\n\n\"This Sporting Life\" (TSL), which ran from 1986 to 2008, was a parody of sporting panel programs, created and hosted by actor-writer-comedians John Doyle and Greig Pickhaver (under the pseudonyms Roy Slaven & HG Nelson). As well as sport, the duo cast a wide comedic net that encompassed the worlds of entertainment, politics and celebrity. \"TSL\" was remarkable as one of the few successful comedy programs that was substantially improvised.\n\nThe longest-running show in Triple J's programming history, \"TSL\" commanded a large and dedicated nationwide audience. Special editions of \"TSL\" were broadcast to coincide with the NRL and AFL grand finals (\"The Festival of the Boot\") as well as for all three of rugby league's State of Origin series matches. (see Roy and HG's State of Origin commentary). In 2009, after 22 years at the ABC, the duo left to work for the commercial rock station Triple M.\n\nIn 2012 Roy Slaven & HG Nelson's \"The Festival of the Boot\" returned to an ABC Radio station for the first time since 2009. To date all 3 AFL grand finals (labeled \"Part 1\") & all 3 NRL grand finals (labeled \"Part 2\") have been broadcast on ABC News Radio\n\nTriple J supports, promotes and broadcasts clips from the Raw Comedy Competition, which is produced by the Melbourne International Comedy Festival. Podcasts of competition sets are available via the Triple J website.\n\n\"Restoring the Balance\" was broadcast sporadically on Sunday afternoons during 2004. The primary concept behind the show was a satire of the contrasting political views between the conservative Australian Howard government, and the left-wing government-funded Triple J radio station. The show suggested that the station was forced to broadcast a segment of right-wing political views in order to \"restore the balance\".\n\n\"Ross and Terri\" broadcast weekdays at lunch times, for two 2-week periods, over summer 2005 and 2006. It was hosted by Ross Noble and Terri Psiakis. It was initially a filler show, but the popularity of the pair was enough to bring them back in 2006.\n\n\"Today Today\" was the name given to the drive show in 2004 and 2005, hosted by Chaser members Chris Taylor and Craig Reucassel. The show's name was derived from \"Today Tonight\", a controversial Australian TV current affairs show screened on the Seven Network. Their humour was in a similar vein to \"CNNNN\" and \"The Chaser\", being more politically driven. One of their more popular skits was \"Coma FM\", a parody of commercial radio stations.\n\nTriple J currently has had several comedic radio plays:\n\nIn 2005 Dave Callan started at Triple J presenting the Saturday night/Sunday early morning program the \"Graveyard Shift\".\n\nIn 2006 Dave hosted the Saturday evening timeslot, called \"Saturday Night\". The show followed the pattern of Callan's mid-dawn shifts from previous years. In January 2007 this show was renamed \"Pirate Radio\" after one of the personae commonly adopted by callers. Listener interaction plays a significant role in Callan's programmes with regular callers such as \"Steph from Tamworth\", \"Snake Charmer Farmer\", and \"Ukulele Guy\", as well as an assortment of \"randoms\" and \"carnies\". On 27 January 2008, Dave returned to the \"Graveyard Shift\" (01:00-06:00 Sunday mornings). From January 2009 the show was shortened, finishing at 04:00. As of 2011 Dave is no longer on Triple J.\n\nBeginning in 2005, John Safran and Father Bob Maguire have co-hosted a Sunday night talk show interviewing international guests, generally discussing serious topics like religion and politics. The show is no longer on air.\n\nBeginning on 27 October 2008, Chris Taylor and Craig Reucassel co-hosted a comedy program centred on the 2008 US Presidential Election entitled \"The Race Race\". The programme aired at 17:00 weekdays until the wrap-up episode, which aired on 5 November 2008, after the elections had concluded.\n\nThe program derived its name from the fact that Barack Obama, the first African–American to be nominated by a major American political party for president, was running a formerly exclusively white political race against the white Republican candidate, John McCain. The program became the number one podcast in Australia, and Triple J released a number of commemorative Race Race T-shirts which featured the show's catchphrase \"I Like Pie\".\n\nThe Hottest 100 is an annual poll of the previous year's most popular songs, as voted by its listeners. It has been conducted for over two decades in its present form, and in 2016 attracted 2.26 million votes from 172 countries. It is promoted as the \"world's greatest music democracy\" and has also spawned a series of compilation CDs, and more recently, music DVDs, released via ABC Music. The countdown of the poll had regularly taken place on Australia Day from 1998 to 2017. In response to controversy surrounding Australia Day celebrations and an extensive poll of Triple J listeners, it was announced in November 2017 that future countdowns would be aired on the fourth weekend of January to avoid associations with the Australia Day holiday.\n\nUnearthed, an ongoing project to find hidden talent, began in 1995. It originally focused on regional areas but now covers all of Australia. Many of these discoveries have been very successful. Some, such as Grinspoon, Killing Heidi, and Missy Higgins, have even been successful enough to receive commercial radio airplay.\n\nThe Unearthed competition was inspired by the success of a talent search on SBS program \"Nomad\" called \"Pick Me\". This segment, co-produced by Triple J, discovered a trio from Newcastle called the \"Innocent Criminals\", who later gained international fame under the name Silverchair.\n\nThe most recent incarnation of \"Unearthed\" is run online, and allows listeners to rate and review songs uploaded by bands and musicians.\n\nSome on-air promotions for the first volume were recorded at the Triple J studios in Ultimo by Darren McErlain in 1996. He was invited to record voice-overs for Triple J, whilst completing an internship at ABC Radio News.\n\nOn 5 October 2011 Triple J Unearthed was launched as a radio station available on digital radio and online.\n\nTriple J occasionally runs a competition known as 'Beat the Drum' - named for their logo of three drumsticks hitting a drum. It is a competition designed to promote the logo, whereby, whoever displays it in the most prominent place would win a prize. Notable entries include:\n\nIn late 2004, the station's promotion for that year's Beat the Drum contest caused a brief but bitter controversy after it released a series of promotional images featuring the 'Drum' logo. Many were outraged by the inclusion of a mocked-up image of the former World Trade Center draped with a huge Drum flag.\n\nIn 2015 no \"One Night Stand\" was held. Instead \"Beat The Drum\" was held.\nTo commemorate the 40th anniversary of Triple J a one-off concert was held on January 16 at The Domain, Sydney. Artists included: Ball Park Music, Vance Joy, The Preatures, You Am I, The Cat Empire, The Presets, Hilltop Hoods, and many special guests.\n\nThe \"Impossible Music Festival\", broadcast in August 2005 was a celebration of 30 years of live music recordings made by JJ and Triple J. Voted for by listeners from over 1000 recorded gigs/concerts, the broadcast went from 18:00 Friday the 26th to 01:00 Monday the 29th. The 2006 \"Impossible Music Festival\" was aired on the weekend of 7–8 October. The 2007 \"Impossible Music Festival\" broadcast from Friday 25 May to Sunday 27 May. The 2008 \"Impossible Music Festival\" was broadcast from Friday 19 September until Sunday 21 September.\n\nThe \"One Night Stand\", held annually since 2004, offers a small town the opportunity to host a free, all ages concert, sponsored by Triple J, featuring three or four Australian musical acts. Entries must include examples of local support, including community (signatures), local government (council approval), and a venue for the concert.\n\nEach November on Triple J is Ausmusic month, where Australian artists are heavily promoted. This includes a solid weekend of Australian music; some free, limited-entry concerts around the country; All-Australian feature albums; Live at the Wireless; and each day, a new \"unknown\" Australian band is featured and played several times during the day.\n\nThe J Awards are an annual awards ceremony held at the start of December each year to celebrate Australian music. Awards include; the Unearthed J Award for best Unearthed artist, the J Award for Australian Music Video of the year, and the main J Award for Australian album of the year, judged by a panel of Triple J presenters. Past winners of the J Award include; Wolfmother (2005), Hilltop Hoods (2006), and The Panics (2007). In 2008, The Presets took the award for \"Apocalypso\". In 2009 the award was won by Sarah Blasko. In 2010, Tame Impala won the coveted J Award. The 2011 winner of best Australian album was Gotye. In 2012 Tame Impala won the award for a second time, this time with \"Lonerism\". In 2013, the electronic artist Flume took out the award with his self-titled debut album.\n\nMany Double Jay and early Triple J presenters went on to successful careers with commercial stations, the most notable being Doug Mulray, who honed his distinctive comedy-based style at the Jays before moving to rival FM rock station 2-MMM (Triple M) in the 1980s, where he became the most popular breakfast presenter in Sydney (and one of the highest-paid radio personalities in the country). Presenter Annette Shun Wah went on to host the popular \"Rock Around the World\" series on SBS and is now a program executive with SBS TV and producer of \"The Movie Show\".\n\nWeekends\n\n\n"}

The Philippine eSports Organization (PeSO) is an eSports entity that is the official Philippine representative to the International eSports Federation (IeSF), which is one of the largest eSports associations in the world. It carries the interests of the Filipino eSports community in the international arena.\n\nNIKO Media Research projected the number of PC Gamers to rise from 21 million in 2012 to 28.72 million in 2014.\n\nThe Philippines is a minor player regarding the game development industry. In 2011, it was reported that the local industry only has a 0.02% market share of the $90 billion global industry. The majority of the game development industry is focused on outsourcing to foreign companies rather than creation of local content. According to the Game Developers Association of the Philippines (GDAP), there are about 4,000 professionals representing about 60 companies involved in the game development industry as of 2013. The Philippines' primary competitors in this field are China, Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam.\n\nThe first Filipino-developed commercial computer game was \"\" which was released in November 2003. 2 months prior to the release of Anito, in September 2003, a free and open source Solitaire card game named Drac was also released by Rico Zuñiga, which makes Drac the first Filipino-developed computer game and game development framework. Drac was also used to create another card game based on the rules of the popular Filipino game, Tong-its which was released on November 2003.\n\nIn 2016 the French video game development company Ubisoft announced plans to establish a subsidiary in the country, which opened on March 28, 2016 in Santa Rosa, Laguna in partnership with De La Salle University.\n\nThe University of The Visayas New School (UVNS) offers esports and game development through their Senior High Arts and Design track. UVNS offers subjects like game theory, mechanics, strategy, and game awareness. Students can also pick up game design, branding, and shoutcasting as well as entrepreneurship. \n\nAfter the return qualification of two Filipino teams for the world DOTA 2 tournament in 2017, esports backers like Sen. Bam Aquino see the potential of the online gaming industry to bring honor to the country while creating jobs and ushering in investments.\n\nDue to the popularity of video gaming in the Philippines, various outlets have conducted tournaments from local to international levels. In 2016 the Manila Cup held various gaming competitions with participation by local and international players, featuring games such as \"Mortal Kombat XL\", \"BlazBlue Chronophantasma\" and \"Street Fighter\". Big name conventions such as the Asia Pop Comic Convention and eSports and Gaming Summit hold various video game tournaments as part of their programs.\n\nThe surging popularity of esports in the Philippines has led to various Filipino teams competing in renowned eSports tournaments worldwide, even producing champions over different tournaments.\n\nIn 2017, a national eSports league was established which is called as The Nationals.\n\nOn November 19, 1981 President Ferdinand Marcos banned video games in the country through a presidential decree, making the Philippines the first nation to ban video games. The decree was a response to complaints from parents and educators who alleged that games such as \"Space Invaders\" and \"Asteroids\" were detrimental to youth morals, viewing them as a \"destructive social enemy\" and existing \"to the detriment of the public interest\". Marcos also decreed the ban of pinball machines, slot machines, and other similar gaming devices. Filipinos were given two weeks to either destroy their video games and devices or surrender the materials to the police and army. Violators had to pay a fine amounting to about $600 and face 6 months to 1 year of prison. Playing video games in the country went underground. The ban was effectively lifted following the 1986 People Power Revolution.\n\nWhile no video games have been banned nationwide since 1986, at least one title, \"Defense of the Ancients\", has been banned at a barangay in Dasmariñas, Cavite following complaints of delinquency and two murder incidents involving youths in the area resulting from brawls related to the game.\n\nUnauthorized distribution of video games is a complex issue in the Philippines. Despite legislation against copyright violation, enforcement and cultural factors remain an obstacle in the country. Bootleg video games, along with warez, contribute to the underground economy of the country where video gaming is a popular form of entertainment among Filipino families. The inability of many Filipino families to afford video game software and hardware at legitimate prices leads them to turn to unlicensed goods. The Optical Media Board in cooperation with the police enforces intellectual rights law in the country.\n"}
