The script, based on a novel by Ray Gaulden, was written by Marguerite Roberts, who also wrote the screenplay of \"True Grit\" for Hathaway the following year.\n\nIn 1880, a gambler in the small town of Rincon, 100 miles from Denver, Colorado is caught cheating at a five-card stud poker game. The players, led by the volatile Nick Evers, take the cheating gambler to hang him. One of the players, Van Morgan, tries to prevent the others from administering frontier justice, but is unable to stop the man's lynching. Morgan leaves town, but later returns when he hears that a couple of the other players from that ill-fated game have become victims of grisly murders.\n\nThe town has a new resident, a stern and somewhat edgy Colt .45-carrying Baptist preacher named Reverend Rudd. As more members of the lynch mob are killed off one by one, it becomes clear that someone is taking revenge, and it is up to Morgan to solve the mystery. Finally, only he is left. He discovers the identity of the killer just in time.\n\n\nThe song led by Rudd at his first service in Rincon is \"Mercy's Call,\" a late-19th-century Baptist hymn written by W.H. Doane.\n\nThis film marked one of the last appearances of Inger Stevens, and the second time Mitchum played an unorthodox preacher (the first being 1955's \"The Night of the Hunter\"). This film brought together director Henry Hathaway and Dean Martin for a second time. The first was the 1965 film \"The Sons of Katie Elder\". Martin plays a gunslinger and performs the title song.\n\n\n\n"}

In reviewing Hitler's inner world, the play carries several anti-Fascism undertones.\n\nThe play has had considerable success internationally; it has been performed in India, Ireland, Hong Kong, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Singapore, Norway, New Zealand, Cyprus and Australia. A performance was also given in Finland and Turkey.\n\nThe play is customarily performed by a single actor playing all the roles. The only major role is that of Adolf Hitler.\n\nSet in the Hitler's underground \"Führerbunker\" in 1945 and designed to be played using minimal resources, the props of the play are limited to three: a banner of German Nazi party hung vertically in the background, a table in centre stage left, and a wooden chair. Promotional material often features photographs of the actor, dressed like Hitler, standing in front of the flag.\n\nRoughly the first half of the play is spent on an overview of Hitler's political ideas, extensively citing \"Mein Kampf\". The quotations are, to a significant extent, chosen for their obvious outrageousness, in expectation that a modern watcher wouldn't find it hard to disagree with them. The rest of the play is dedicated to demonstrating that even half a century after Hitler's death, his \"poisoned utopias\" and \"warped logic\"—the \"spirit of Hitler\"—live on in modern societies. A number of theatre critics have found this turnaround a defining and deeply moving aspect of the play.\n\nPrevent Genocide International: \n\n\n"}

Alliance for Open Society International, Inc., 570 U.S. ___ (2013), was United States Supreme Court decision in which the court ruled that conditions imposed on recipients of certain federal grants amounted to a restriction of freedom of speech and violated the First Amendment.\n\nIn 2003, the United States Congress passed and President George W. Bush signed a law providing federal government funds to private groups to help fight AIDS and other diseases all over the world, through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). However, one of the conditions imposed by the law on grant recipients was a requirement, known as the anti-prostitution pledge, to have \"a policy explicitly opposing prostitution and sex trafficking\". Many AIDS agencies preferred to remain neutral on prostitution so as not to alienate the sex workers they work with to reduce HIV rates.\n\nDKT International filed a lawsuit in Washington, DC but the challenge to the law was defeated on appeal. Alliance for Open Society International and Pathfinder International filed another suit in 2005. In 2008, InterAction, and the Global Health Council joined the suit against the provision in a federal court in New York City, arguing that the requirement to promote a specific message violated the First Amendment's protection of free speech. The district court judge ruled in their favor, and the provision has effectively been blocked since. On appeal, the Second Circuit Court upheld the judge's decision.\n\nIn November 2012, the Supreme Court granted a petition for certiorari filed by USAID, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the Center for Disease Control. In a 6-2 decision, the court ruled in a majority written by Chief Justice John Roberts that the government cannot force a private organization to publicly profess a viewpoint that mirrors the government's view but is not held by the organization itself. Such a requirement would be considered a form of \"leveraging\" and violated the First Amendment protection of free speech. Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas jointly filed a dissenting opinion arguing that the majority's ruling would prevent government funding for specific ideological programs.\n\n"}

His talent as a ventriloquist has been put to use in television series such as \"Beverly Hills, 90210\" and \"Las Vegas,\" as well as in the sci-fi Web series \"After Judgment\".\n\nSince 2000, Gross has toured the United States with his \"MindBoggling Variety Show,\" which combines his comedy, magic, and ventriloquism with large-scale stage illusions. Among the more notable ventriloquist's dummy characters in the stage act is Steve, The Customer Service Guy, a soft puppet who dispenses computer repair support by telephone.\n\nIn 2013, Gross created a video depicting a unique spin on the classic cut-in-half illusion that he dubs the \"Split Man\" trick, which makes it appear as though the entertainer has been severed in two but is still able to walk about.

{"id": "4393438", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4393438", "title": "Baldur's Gate", "text": "Baldur's Gate\n\nBaldur's Gate is a fantasy role-playing video game developed by BioWare and published in 1998 by Interplay Entertainment. It is the first game in the \"Baldur's Gate\" series and takes place in the Forgotten Realms, a high fantasy campaign setting, using a modified version of the \"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons\" (\"AD&D\") 2nd edition rules. It was the first game to use the Infinity Engine for its graphics, with Interplay using the engine for other Forgotten Realms-licensed games, including the \"Icewind Dale\" series, as well as other licensed \"D&D\" campaign worlds such as \"\". The game's story focuses on players controlling a protagonist of their own creation who finds themselves travelling across the Sword Coast alongside a party of companions, to unravel the mystery surrounding a sudden iron crisis affecting the region and attempting to discover the culprits behind it, while uncovering dark secrets about their origins and dealing with attempts on their life.\n\nThe game received critical acclaim following its release and was credited for revitalising computer role-playing games. Its success led to an expansion pack entitled \"\", as well as spawning a sequel entitled \"\", which later received its own expansion called \"\". An enhanced version of the Infinity Engine was later created as part of Beamdog's remake, entitled \"\", the first new release in the franchise in nearly nine years.\n\nPlayers conduct the game from a top-down isometric third-person perspective, creating a character for each playthrough who then travels across pre-rendered location, taking on quests, recruiting companions to aid them, and combating enemies, while working towards completing the game's main story. Control is done through a user interface that allows a player to move characters and give them actions to undertake, review information on on-going quests and the statistics of characters in their party, manage their inventories, organize the formation of the party, though the screen does not need to be centered on the characters being controlled and can be moved around with the mouse and keyboard, the latter also capable of accessing various player options through keyboard shortcuts. All of the gameplay mechanics were coded to conform to the \"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons\" 2nd edition role-playing rules, with game automatically computing the rule intricacies, including tracking statistics and dice rolling. Although the game is conducted in real-time, some elements of the ruleset used in the coding were modified to allow it to feature a pausable real-time mode, allowing players to pause the game at any time and prepare what actions a character do, including the ability to set the game to automatically pause at preset points in combat. A new playthrough requires the player to either create a new player character (PC), or import one they exported from a previous playthrough. Every new character requires the player to determine what their name, gender, race, class, and alignment are, and what ability scores and weapon proficiencies they have, with thieves requiring points be allocated between their thieving skills, and spellcasters having a few spells set up for them - those using priest spells have them available for use from the start, while those using wizard spells add them to their spellbook and have one primed for use at the start of a new game. New PCs can be multi-class, but must adhere to the restrictions that come from this, in accordance to the 2nd edition rules; a character who is both a cleric and a fighter, may only use weapons of the former class.\n\nThe game's main story is divided up into eight parts - a prologue and seven chapters - with each requiring the player to complete a specific task in order to complete it; while free exploration of the game's world map is allowed from the outset upon completing the prologue, some areas are not accessible until the player has advanced to a specific chapter. With the exception of imported characters, all PCs begin off as weak characters from the start, but eventually grow stronger as the player explores the game's world, completing both the major quests and the game's large variety of side quests, killing hostile enemies, earning experience points to level up their character, finding new spells to use and new pieces of equipment to wear, and recruiting a variety of companions, each with different classes and skills, to aid them in their travels. A PC may have up to five companions travelling with them in their party, with the player free to decide who to recruit and who to dismiss from the party. Upon reaching the experience threshold for their current level, defined by their class, both the PC and companions can level up, increasing their hits and occasionally improving their weapon proficiencies, with thieves provided additional points to distribute between their skills, and spellcasters gaining access to additional spell slots, sometimes gaining access to new ones for higher levels of magic. All characters are limited to a maximum number of 89,000 experience points in the game, with characters who multi-class being also affected by this cap - an elf who uses two classes may only earn half the cap in each, with experience divided equally between the two classes, while a human who dual-classed after earning a third of the cap in their base class, may only earn the other two thirds in their second class.\n\nThe main user interface consists of three action bars surrounding the main screen. The first bar consisting of buttons to the various options players can use, including a map of the party's location and the world, the journal that logs all details of notable events and all on-going and completed quests, character records for each member of the party, the inventories for each character, spellbooks containing all spells available for spellcasters, a time display that also acts as the pause mechanism when clicked, and the various game options. The second bar consists of the portraits of each character currently in the party, detailing their hit points, their order, and any positive and negative effects they are experiencing, with the portrait switching from colour to greyscale when the character has died. The third bar provides specific actions depending on the number of characters being controlled by the player; if one is selected, the player has the ability to switch between the weapons they are using, use any spells and items set up for quick use, and utilises a character's special abilities or those of certain pieces of equipment, but if more than one is selected, the bar displays options for conversing with or attacking NPCs, regardless of being friendly, neutral or hostile, stop what is being done, and change their formation to those available in the game.\n\nThe inventory system used in \"Baldur's Gate\" follows the conventions of the \"paper doll\" mechanics, in that each character can equip items depending on what type they are - weapons, ammo, armour, helmet, necklace, rings, belt, cloak, feet, and usable. The number of items a character can both equip and carry is affected by their weight limit, which is determined by their Strength ability score; going over this limit will encumber the character causing them to move slowly or prevent them moving altogether, until they remove items from their inventory. The system notably indicates what equipment a character can not use as defined by their class, which also determine how many weapon slots they have available for weapons; by default, all character have two weapon slots along with an off-hand slot for shields and weapons, but some classes allow character to one or two extra weapon slots to use. In addition, characters may equip three stacks of ammo for ranged weapons (bows, crossbows and slings), and use three different types of usable items (potions, scrolls and wands). Items can be examined in the inventory, though most enchanted items require identification before their properties are known, while any cursed equipment can't be removed unless through magic or visiting a temple. Any potions found can be used without being set up for quick use, while mages can learn spells from scrolls that they do not have knowledge of and have room for in their spellbook; unlike priest classes, who have access to all the spells of each level magic upon acquiring a slot in that level, mages need to learn spells from scrolls found in their travels or bought from shops, but can learn those of higher levels that they do not have spell slots for, though higher game difficulties incur the possibility of failing to learn a new spell. In addition, any spells set to a spell slot cannot be used until the spellcaster rests first to \"memorise\" it.\n\nDialogue is an important aspect of the game, which relies heavily on it. Conversation can be initiated by players selecting a member of the party and clicking on a friendly or neutral NPC, though some conversation are initiated automatically when characters come close to them, and while most conversations are mainly text-based, some include spoken dialogue. Most conversation include a list of responses that a character can use, some that can provide information on certain topics, lead to quests, or access services, while others can influence a situation, such as provoking a fight, or finding another way to solve a problem. Certain NPCs offer services that character can use when talking with them, including shops where characters can buy and sell items and get unknown enchanted items identified, inns where the party can rest in safety and recover lost hit points and memorise spells, and temples where characters can pay for healing services, such as resurrecting a dead party member.\n\nOther features that affect gameplay include:\n\n\n\"Baldur's Gate\" takes place in the fictional world of Ed Greenwood's \"Forgotten Realms\" setting, during the year of 1368DR in the midst of an apparent iron shortage, where items made with iron inexplicably rot and break. Focusing upon the western shoreline of Faerûn, the game is set within a stretch of the region known as the Sword Coast, which contains a multitude of ecologies and terrains, including mountains, forests, plains, cities, and ruins, with the story encompassing both the city of Baldur's Gate, the largest and most affluent city in the region, and the lands south of it, including the Cloud Peaks, the Wood of Sharp Teeth, the Cloakwood forest, the town of Beregost and the village of Nashkel, and the fortress citadel of Candlekeep. In addition to the region, a variety of organisations from the \"Forgotten Realms\" setting also feature as part of the game's main story, including the Zhentarim, the Red Wizards of Thay, The Iron Throne, the Flaming Fist, The Chill, The Black Talons, and the Harpers.\n\n\"Baldur's Gate\" includes around 25 player companions that can join with the PC. A number of the characters who appear include several who are canon to the official \"Forgotten Realms\" campaign setting, including Drizzt Do'Urden and Elminster.\n\nThe player plays as the young and orphaned ward of the mage Gorion. The two live in the ancient library fortress of Candlekeep. Abruptly, the Ward finds themselves ordered by Gorion to prepare to leave the citadel together during the night with no explanation. On the night of leaving Candlekeep, a mysterious armoured figure and his cohort ambushes the pair and orders Gorion to hand over the Ward. Gorion refuses, and dies in the ensuing battle, while ensuring that his Ward can escape. In the morning, the Ward encounters Imoen, a childhood friend and an orphan like them who lived in Candlekeep, who had followed them in secret. With no safe hiding place available, Candlekeep no longer accessible to them without Gorion's influence to circumvent its admission fee, and the city of Baldur's Gate currently closed off to outsiders due to bandit raids, the Ward resolves to investigate the cause of the region's Iron Crisis.\n\nTravelling to the mines of Nashkel, the main source of the region's iron, the Ward's party discovers that the mine's ore is being contaminated by a group of kobolds led by a half-orc, and that they and the bandits plaguing the region are being controlled by an organization known as the Iron Throne, a merchant outfit operating out of Baldur's Gate. After sabotaging a mine operated by the Iron Throne in the Cloakwood that would presumably give them total control over the region's iron, the Ward's party head into the newly reopened Baldur's Gate. Venturing to the Throne's headquarters, the group learns that proof of the organization's involvement with the Iron Crisis was taken by one of the regional leaders when they and the rest of the leadership headed to Candlekeep for an important meeting. Revealing their findings to Duke Eltan, the leader of the Flaming Fist, the group receive a rare and valuable book, which would allow them access into Candlekeep, in order to spy on the meeting. During their investigations in the citadel's library, the Ward discovers a prophecy written by the ancient seer Alaundo, foretelling how the offspring created during the Times of Trouble by the dead god Bhaal, the Lord of Murder, will sow chaos until only one remains to become the new Lord of Murder. The Ward then finds a letter from Gorion revealing that the Ward is among the offspring of Bhaal, known as Bhaalspawn. During their stay at Candlekeep, the Ward's party is imprisoned for the murders of the Iron Throne leaders, regardless of whether they did so or not, until they can be transported to Baldur's Gate to be executed. Tethoril, a prominent keeper in Candlekeep, visits the party and reveals that a suspicious character the party met earlier, Koveras, is really the foster son of one of the now dead Iron Throne leaders. His name is Sarevok, the one responsible for Gorion's murder, and also wishes to kill the Ward.\n\nBelieving the Ward to be innocent, Tethoril transports the party into the catacombs beneath the fortress, where the party battles their way through doppelgängers taking on the form of people the Ward knew in Candlekeep. Returning to Baldur's Gate, the Ward's party find themselves accused of causing the Iron Crisis on the orders of the Kingdom of Amn, assassinating one of the city's Grand Dukes, and poisoning Duke Eltan. Forced to stay hidden from the Flaming Fist, the party discovers that the Iron Throne orchestrated the Iron Crisis to gain control of iron through their mine in the Cloakwood, while using doppelgängers to weaken other merchant outfits, ensuring that they would have a monopoly on iron. With tensions rising between Baldur's Gate and Amn, the organization hoped to sell the stockpiled iron to the city at exorbitant prices. Afterward, they aimed to de-escalate tensions between Baldur's Gate and Amn.\n\nThe party also discovers that Sarevok, having uncovered that he was a Bhaalspawn, hoped to fuel distrust between Baldur's Gate and Amn by making each think the other was responsible for creating the crisis, and cause them to go to war. Sarevok believed that the resulting carnage would be enough to allow him to become the new Lord of Murder. Due to the Ward's similar background, he hired assassins to kill them. Sarevok remained loyal to his father until the Iron Throne's meeting in Candlekeep threatened his plans, which led Sarevok to eliminate him and the other regional leaders of the Iron Throne before taking over the outfit and transferring their stores of iron to the city in order to be seen as a savior. He was also responsible for the poisoning of Duke Eltan and the assassination of one of the four Grand Dukes.\n\nThe Ward's party gain entry to the Duchal Palace, where the coronation of Sarevok as a Grand Duke of Baldur's Gate would be held, and present evidence of his schemes. Exposed, Sarevok flees into an ancient underground ruin beneath Baldur's Gate, with the Ward and the party following after. The Ward confronts Sarevok within an ancient temple to Bhaal, and defeats him, saving the Sword Coast and ending their brother's schemes. In the final ending cinematic, Sarevok's tainted soul departs his body and travels deep underground to a large circular chamber of alcoves, and destroys a statue of himself contained in one of the alcoves, whereupon it is revealed that the other alcoves each contain a statue of a Bhaalspawn that exists in Faerûn.\n\n\"Baldur's Gate\" was developed by Canadian game developer BioWare, a company founded by practicing physicians Ray Muzyka and Greg Zeschuk. The game was initially titled \"Forgotten Realms\". According to Muzyka, \"Our head programmer has actually read every one of the [Forgotten Realms] books - everything, every single one of the short stories and the paperbacks. He made a point of it. He really want to immerse himself.\" The game required 90 man-years of development, which was spent simultaneously creating the game's content and the BioWare Infinity Engine. The primary script engine for the game (used mainly as a debugging tool) was Lua. DirectDraw was used for the graphics.\n\n\"Wasteland\" was a major influence on \"Baldur's Gate\", particularly its design philosophy of having more than one possible method to achieve each goal.\n\nUnusually for the time, the graphics were not built from tiles; each background was individually rendered, which greatly extended the amount of time needed to create the game. At the time that the game was shipped, none of the sixty-member team had previously participated in the release of a video game. The time pressure to complete the game led to the use of simple areas and game design. Ray Muzyka said that the team held a \"passion and a love of the art,\" and they developed a \"collaborative design spirit.\" He believes that the game was successful because of the collaboration with Interplay.\n\n\"Baldur's Gate\" was released on November 30, 1998, and was published by Black Isle Studios, an internal division of Interplay.\n\n\"Baldur's Gate\" had low sales expectations from Interplay, and BioWare's internal sales goal was 200,000 units, a number that \"PC Zone\"s Dave Woods said would \"justify work on the sequel.\" However, the game was a financial success. In its first two weeks of release, the game sold 175,000 copies worldwide. This pushed it to the #1 position of computer game sales charts in France, Germany, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States during the period. Its global sales totaled more than 500,000 copies by February 1999, nearly 700,000 by June and roughly one million by November.\n\nIn the United States alone, \"Baldur's Gate\" sold 55,071 copies during 1998 and was the country's second-best-selling computer game during the first half of 1999, behind \"SimCity 3000\". It ultimately claimed ninth place for 1999 as a whole, with a total of 356,448 copies sold. It was also the country's seventh highest-grossing computer game in 1999, with revenues of $15.7 million. Sales in the United States surpassed 500,000 copies by March 2000, which led Desslock of GameSpot to describe \"Baldur's Gate\" as an \"undisputed commercial blockbuster\".\n\nGlobal sales reached 1.5 million copies in 2001, and ultimately surpassed 2.2 million by 2003.\n\n\"Baldur's Gate\" received positive reviews from virtually every major computer gaming publication that reviewed it. At the time of the game's release, \"PC Gamer US\" said that \"Baldur's Gate\" \"reigns supreme over every RPG currently available, and sets new standards for those to come.\" \"Computer Shopper\" called it \"clearly the best \"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons\" (AD&D) game ever to grace a PC screen\". \"Maximum PC\" magazine compared the gameplay to \"Diablo\", but noted its more extensive selection of features and options. The pixel-based characters were panned, but the reviewer stated that \"the gloriously rendered backgrounds make up for that shortcoming.\" The main criticism was of the problems with the path finding algorithm for non-player characters. Despite this, the game was deemed an \"instant classic\" because of the amount of customization allowed, the \"fluid story lines\", and the replayability. The reviewer from \"Pyramid\" felt that the \"basic buzz was positive\" surrounding the development of the game. The \"actual results are a mixed bag, but there's real promise for the future\" thanks to the inclusion of the Infinity Engine.\n\n\"Baldur's Gate\" was named the best computer role-playing game of 1998 by the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences, the Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts & Design, \"Computer Gaming World\", the Game Developers Conference, \"Computer Games Strategy Plus\", IGN, CNET Gamecenter, RPG Vault, \"PC Gamer US\" and GameSpot. IGN, \"Computer Games\" and RPG Vault also presented it with their overall \"Game of the Year\" awards. The editors of \"Computer Games\" wrote that \"Baldur's Gate\" \"delivers everything you could ask for in a computer game.\"\n\nAccording to IGN, \"Baldur's Gate\" did much to revive the role-playing video game genre. John Harris of Gamasutra wrote that it \"rescued computer D&D from the wastebasket.\" According to GameSpy, \"\"Baldur's Gate\" was a triumph [that] single-handedly revived the [computer role-playing game] and almost made gamers forgive Interplay for \"Descent to Undermountain\"\". IGN ranked \"Baldur's Gate\" No. 5 on their list of \"The Top 11 Dungeons & Dragons Games of All Time\" in 2014.\n\n\"Baldur's Gate\" was the first game in the \"Baldur's Gate\" series. It was followed by the expansion pack \"\" (1999), then the sequel \"\" (2000) and its expansion pack \"\" (2001). As of 2006, total sales for all releases in the series was almost five million copies. The series set the standard for other games using AD&D rules, especially those developed by BioWare and Black Isle Studios: \"\" (1999), \"Icewind Dale\" (2000), and \"Icewind Dale II\" (2002). The novel \"Baldur's Gate\" (1999) by Philip Athans was based on the game.\n\n\"Baldur's Gate\" was re-released along with its expansion in 2000 as \"Baldur's Gate Double Pack\", and again in 2002 as a three CD collection entitled \"Baldur's Gate: The Original Saga\". In 2002, the game and its expansion were released along with \"Icewind Dale\", \"\" and \"\" as the \"Black Isle Compilation\". In 2004, it was re-released, this time along with \"Icewind Dale II\", in \"Part Two\" of the compilation. Atari published the \"Baldur's Gate 4 in 1 Boxset\" including all four games on a combination of DVDs and CDs.\n\n\"Baldur's Gate\" and its expansion were released digitally on Good Old Games (later GOG) on September 23, 2010. It has also been made available via GameStop App as part of the D&D Anthology: The Master Collection, which also includes the expansion \"\", \"\", \"\", \"Icewind Dale\", \"\", \"\", \"Icewind Dale II\", \"\", and \"The Temple of Elemental Evil\".\n\nOn March 15, 2012 a remake was announced entitled \"\", originally slated for release in Summer 2012. Five days later, Overhaul Games announced that the Enhanced Edition would also be released for the Apple iPad. On September 14, Trent Oster, president of Overhaul Games, announced that the game's release would be delayed until November, citing an overwhelming response and a desire to \"make the best \"Baldur's Gate\" possible\". The game was launched for Microsoft Windows on November 28, 2012, for iPad running iOS 6 or greater on December 7, 2012, for Mac OS X on February 22, 2013, and for Android on April 17, 2014. On March 17, 2012, Beamdog founder and former BioWare employee Trent Oster confirmed via Twitter that \"Baldur's Gate III\" would be the company's \"long-term goal.\"\n\n"}

Bugg is a four-step dance and performed at different paces (120–180 BPM). Bugg is a partner dance and follows certain basic rules, but is essentially improvised, with the woman following the man's lead. Acrobatic moves are not allowed on national or international dancecompetitions. Swedish Bugg belongs to the swing dance family and closely resembles Modern Jive.\n\nBugg is both a very popular social dance as well as a competitive dance in Sweden. It also has the most competitors and practitioners within the Swedish Dancesport Federation.\n\nThere is also a variant called double bugg that is usually performed by one man and two women, but other combinations of three dancers may appear.\n\nSwedish Bugg is a totally Swedish phenomenon and is also a variant of the early Lindy Hop (Jitterbug), which came to Sweden in the mid-1940s. In films from a famous dance place called Nalen in Stockholm, one can see the Swedish style of Lindy Hop (Jitterbug) in which the Swedish Bugg has its origins. This dance style was then developed to the modern style we see today, danced in dance places throughout Sweden and now beginning to spread around the globe. This style has of course various dialects and variants, but the bases are more or less equal throughout the country.\n\nWhen the dance competitions began in Sweden during the mid 70s, there was only one class for all participants, namely \"Free style\". This was then in 1983 divided into two different dance styles, \"Social bugg\" and \"Free style\". In 1984 this was changed again. A new style was created. These two new styles were then called \"Free style\" and Rock for a long period.\n\nLater on these two dancestyles more or less was developed toward one single Bugg style and into what one can see today. Yet with different dialects and variants throughout the country, but without the acrobatic elements. The Swedish Bugg was from now on practised with great enthusiasm by many dancers and in all ages, from all of Sweden. Today, the Swedish Bugg is one of the most popular social dances in Swedish danceclubs (ext link: swedish dance clubs. It can also provide a gateway into other dance styles.\n\n"}

{"id": "6220357", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6220357", "title": "Counterfeit (song)", "text": "Counterfeit (song)\n\n\"Counterfeit\" is a song by the American nu metal band Limp Bizkit from their debut album \"Three Dollar Bill, Y'all\" (1997). Notable for showcasing guitarist Wes Borland's experimental playing style, the song was written by Borland, DJ Lethal, Fred Durst, John Otto and Sam Rivers as a response to local bands that copied Limp Bizkit's style.\n\nThe song was released as the album's first single in 1997, prior to the album's release. \"Counterfeit\" was the subject of controversy when Interscope Records paid a Portland radio station to play the song fifty times as a paid advertising, sparking payola accusations and criticism of the band and label. In 1999, the song was reissued as another single under the title \"Counterfeit Countdown\". It also appears on multiple compilations.\n\nThe song originated from the band's frustrations at the fact that other bands were copying Limp Bizkit's style. According to Borland, \"They saw this little thing we built [...] and they were like, 'Oh, let's get baggy pants and dress like kind of hip-hoppy and, you know, play heavy metal and rap.' [...] five or six bands just popped up out of nowhere that became these, you know, groups that were trying to sound like us. It was ridiculous. That's where the song 'Counterfeit' came from.\"\n\nOn the recorded version, Borland played without a guitar pick, performing with two hands, one playing melodic notes, and the other playing chord progressions. Borland's playing featured octave shapes, and choppy, eighth-note rhythms, sometimes accompanied by muting his strings with his left hand, creating a percussive sound. Borland also made use of unevenly accented syncopated sixteenth notes and hypnotic, droning licks to create a disorienting effect.\n\n\"Counterfeit\" was released as a single in 1997 after to the release of \"Three Dollar Bill, Y'all\", and was the first single released from the album. It featured the album versions of the songs \"Counterfeit\" and \"Nobody Loves Me\", and a shorter edit of \"Counterfeit\" intended for radio airplay. A second single of the song was released in 1999 under the title \"Counterfeit Countdown\", containing three remixes and the album and radio edits of the song.\n\nThe band filmed a music video for the song depicting a teenage boy with bleached hair who is harassed by others. Wanting to fit in, he starts by cutting his hair short. He then takes his shirt off, and starts to cover himself with a black tar-like substance. He puts on a fly mask, as he continues to cover himself with the tar, with Durst watching him in the background with a disgusted look on his face. The boy then exits his room and comes down the stairs, now mutated into some sort of human fly. He enters the kitchen, where his family simply ignores him. He jumps onto the kitchen table, and begins to throw around the food on the table, while rubbing some into his face.\n\nInterscope Records proposed to the band that the label pay $5,000 to guarantee that Portland radio station KUFO-FM play the song \"Counterfeit\" fifty times, preceded and concluded with an announcement that the air time was paid for by Interscope. The paid air time was criticized by the media, who saw it as \"payola\". The band's manager Jeff Kwatinetz later termed the plan as a \"brilliant marketing move\". Durst stated, \"It worked, but it's not that cool of a thing.\"\n\nThe two singles released for the song were not well received by critics. Allmusic gave the 1997 single two out of five stars. The 1999 reissue, similarly, was also not well received, receiving the same rating from the website as the previous single. Reviewing the 1999 \"Lethal Dose Extreme Guitar Mix\" by DJ Lethal, Allmusic writer Bradley Torreano criticized DJ Lethal's decision to remove the original music in favor of a hip hop beat, writing, \"[it makes] Durst's shaky lyrics sound that much worse [...] [DJ Lethal] only keeps a little of the original chugging guitar.\"\n\nIn 2001, the \"Lethal Dose Extreme Guitar Mix\" of the song was included on the remix album \"New Old Songs\". The original version of the song appeared on the compilations \"Greatest Hitz\" (2005), \"Collected\" (2008) and \"Icon\" (2011).\n\nThe cover art for the \"Counterfeit Countdown\" single was produced by Christopher Karl Salat \"BeZerk\" and M. Figueroa \"GONZO247\" of the Aerosol Warfare graffiti crew from Houston, Texas. The sculpture was created by \"BeZerk\" using spray paint cans, clock parts, colored tape and white/red audio chords. The piece is entitled \"Aerosol Warfare 2\" (US Copyright: VA0001131224) and was displayed by Christopher in many art galleries all over the U.S. before appearing on the single used to promote Limp Bizkit’s song \"Counterfeit\". The photograph of the sculpture used on the single was taken by \"GONZO247\" at the “Worship Center”, in Houston’s downtown metropolitan area. Aerosol Warfare was also an underground video documentary about hip hop culture that circulated the underground during the 90's golden age of hip hop. The video kept up with current underground subjects such as; MC/Beatbox battles, graffiti marathons, graffiti artist interviews, breakdancing, and the new styles of the current graffiti movement. Aerosol Warfare is still active in the Arts scene in Houston, Texas.\n"}

The film is the Bollywood debut of Pakistani model turned actor Imran Abbas Naqvi. The film also stars Amit Tandon and Mukul Dev in supporting roles. The film rec\n\nAhana (Bipasha Basu) opens a hotel in Glendale, Himachal Pradesh. During the day of the opening party, she meets Kunal Anand (Imran Abbas), a novelist, and they become attracted to each other. When a couple and the hotel cook are killed by an unknown creature, Kunal decides to help Ahana. Romance grows between Ahana and Kunal and they consummate their relationship. After a few peaceful days, the creature strikes again and wreaks havoc in the hotel; Ahana finds herself facing off against a ten-feet long creature with the legs and tail of a dinosaur, and the body and head of a human. Professor Sadanand (Mukul Dev) scares off the creature with a burning log.\n\nThe next morning, the injured guests and hotel staff get evicted by police. The professor explains that the creature is a Brahmarakshas, a man-eating mutant which is the result of Lord Brahma, the Hindu god of creation, cursing demons to become such creatures with no salvation, eternally condemned to roam on earth and suffer. Brahmarakshasas still lurk in dense forests of India, but their sightings are as relevant as sightings of UFOs. He suggests Ahana and Kunal to leave if they wish to stay alive. Ahana refuses to leave the hotel, determined to fight back.\n\nAhana, Kunal and the professor are joined in the fight by two cops, Inspector Rana (Deepraj Rana) and Inspector Chaubey (Bikramjeet Kanwarpal), but the Brahmarakshasa kills Chaubey. They learn that a Sarpanch filed a report of a Brahmarakshasa sighting a few years back and go to meet him. He tells them that decades ago, a hunter killed a Brahmarakshasa, and the only person who can help them now is Dr. Moga, the son of the late hunter. Kunal and Ahana set for Shimla to meet the doctor. On the way, Kunal reveals his true identity as Karan Malhotra, the chairman of the builder group that compelled Ahana's father to commit suicide. He tells her that he felt guilty and wanted to apologize. Heartbroken, Ahana breaks up with Karan.\n\nDr. Moga explains that Brahmarakshasa can be killed by a weapon dipped in the temple pond of the Brahma Temple in Pushkar but is effective only if dipped into the pond on night of Kartik Purnima.Since Kartik Purnima is many days away, Dr. Moga gives Ahana an old rifle with which his father had killed a Brahmarakshasa. Ahana, the professor, and Rana enter the den of the Brahmarakshasa; Rana and the professor are killed by the beast, and when it tries to attack Ahana, Karan saves her. With Karan's help, Ahana manages to kill the creature with the last bullet in the rifle.\n\nA few days later, the hotel is ready to be reopened. Ahana forgives Karan and they rekindle their relationship.\n\n\nThe soundtrack and the lyrics of the film were written by Mithoon, except for \"Sawan Aaya Hai\" which has music and lyrics by Tony Kakkar. The film's soundtrack officially released on 31 July 2014. Koimoi stated that the soundtrack had received a good reception.\n\nThe trailer of the movie was released in July 2014. Koimoi called it \"a half baked trailer that relies solely on 3D\".\n\nVinayak Chakravorty of \"India Today\" has given 2 stars to the movie stating that it suffered from budget constraints, \"serves little intrigue and banks on the sporadic jolts courtesy loud music.\" Anupama Chopra said, \"This is the type of film in which the human beings are so annoying that you are actually rooting for the creature that kills them. In fact, the creature had more personality than all of them put together. In an effective opening sequence, Vikram introduces him to us by only showing us isolated parts; his talons, monstrous eyes, powerful tail. I think this Creature should have demanded a better script.\"\n\n\"India Today\" reports that the film had a budget of Rs.18 crore with an additional Rs.7 crore spent on a marketing campaign.\n\nKoimoi reported the film opened on 1400 screens, with an average occupancy.

It is organised by various political parties, community organisations and civil societies in Southern Tamil Nadu to commemorate the memory of Immanuvel Devendrar, a freedom fighter and Indian National Congress leader who took part in the Quit India movement during the British Raj era. He worked in the Indian Army in independent India and later he fought for the rights of depressed class people of Southern Tamil Nadu, particularly for upliftment of Pallar caste. He was a close associate of chief minister K. Kamaraj.\n\nImmanuel Devendrar was a member of the Indian National Congress and a close associate of its leader, K. Kamaraj. At that time, Congress was supported by influential communities of southern Tamil Nadu, such as the Pallars and Nadars, and opposed by the Forward Block, which was itself favoured by the Maravar community. The two sides clashed during elections. Violence erupted notably in the districts of Ramanathapuram and Madurai which claimed over 40 lives. Devendrar was killed at this time and the anniversary of his death is today celebrated by various political parties and community organisations and civil societies as Devendrar Jayanthi.\n\nDevendrar Jayanti is among the celebrations sometimes criticised as being designed mainly as expressions of caste pride and political power, which sometimes turn into inter-caste violence. The critics claim that political parties used them as a form of vote bank politics.\n\nThese critics are rebutted by people who say that every caste has its own leader and the people are celebrating the memories of their leaders. Despite of these arguments every year the government is struggling to maintain the law and order during these celebrations.\n"}
{"id": "3276273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3276273", "title": "Equal-time rule", "text": "Equal-time rule\n\nThe equal-time rule specifies that U.S. radio and television broadcast stations must provide an equivalent opportunity to any opposing political candidates who request it. This means, for example, that if a station gives a given amount of time to a candidate in prime time, it must do the same for another candidate who requests it, at the same price if applicable. This rule originated in §18 of the Radio Act of 1927; it was later superseded by the Communications Act of 1934. A related provision, in §315(b), requires that broadcasters offer time to candidates at the same rate as their \"most favored advertiser\".\n\nThe equal-time rule was created because the FCC was concerned that broadcast stations could easily manipulate the outcome of elections by presenting just one point of view, and excluding other candidates. The equal-time rule should not be confused with the now-defunct Fairness Doctrine, which dealt with presenting balanced points of view on matters of public importance.\n\nThere are four exceptions to the equal-time rule. If the airing was within a documentary, bona fide news interview, scheduled newscast or an on-the-spot news event, the equal-time rule does not apply. Since 1983, political debates not hosted by the media station are considered \"news events,\" and as a result, are not subject to the rule. Consequently, these debates may include only major-party candidates without having to offer air time to minor-party or independent candidates. Talk shows and other regular news programming from syndicators, such as \"Entertainment Tonight\", are also declared exempt from the rule by the FCC on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe equal-time rule was temporarily suspended by Congress in 1960 in order to permit the Kennedy-Nixon debates to take place.\n\nThe Zapple Doctrine was similar to the equal-time rule, but applied to different political campaign participants. The equal-time rule applies to the political candidate only. The Zapple Doctrine had the same purpose and requirements of equivalent coverage opportunity as the equal-time rule, but its scope included the candidate's spokesman and supporters, not the candidate.\n\n\n"}

Over three decades, the annual indoor event became a major attraction in the San Francisco Bay and was attended by nearly half a million people since its inception with steadily increasing growth in attendance each year until 2010, when the event was cancelled due to poor ticket sales and cost overruns. The 2011 ball was never planned. Due to the worldwide popularity of the event the City of San Francisco issued three proclamations for “Exotic Erotic Ball Day,” twice by Mayor Willie Brown in 1999 and again in 2001, and once by Mayor Gavin Newsom in 2004. In 2011 and 2012, similar but unrelated events, Masquerotica and the XO Ball & Expo, respectively, filled the void left by the demise of the original Exotic Erotic.\n\nMany attendees of the Exotic Erotic Ball came to the event in wildly elaborate, creative, and sexy Halloween costumes to compete in the annual “Best Costume” contest which in later years typically awarded the winner prize money and merchandise in the $10,000 USD range. \n\nWhile the Exotic Erotic Ball by definition would be considered a “Festival” the event is rarely categorized into conventional terms by attendees, the media, or event organizers. Because of the broad spectrum of conventional and unconventional entertainment offered on multiple stages at the Exotic Erotic Ball, it may be described as a combination of Adult-themed; Halloween festival, Music Festival, Burlesque show, Lingerie party, Masquerade ball, Fetish club, Swingers party and Adult Industry Trade Show.\n\nFrom 2004 through 2009, organizers expanded the Exotic Erotic Ball to include the Exotic Erotic Expo. The expo was a two-day Adult-Expo typically held the day before and the day of the Exotic Erotic Ball. Activities included panel discussions on First Amendment rights with adult actress, actors, and media, wine tastings with porn stars, and various oddities such as the \"spiritual oasis\" with psychic readings and massage, body painting, a classic adult cinema, and a human petting zoo. It also features a commercial area with vendors and exhibitors who showcase the latest in exotic fashion, erotic art, adult products, games, websites, and adult novelties. \n\nIn 2008, 26,341 people participated in the combined Exotic Erotic Ball and Exotic Erotic Expo.\n\nPerry Mann organized the first Exotic Erotic Ball in 1979 to raise campaign funds for his business partner and best friend, the late Louis Abolafia, who ran for President of the United States under the Nudist Party with the slogan: “I have nothing to hide.” Louis also coined the phrase, “Make love, not war!” and his legendary Greenwich Village love-ins inspired the New York press to crown him “The Love King.” Abolafia had previously run in 1968 under the Cosmic Love Party, even then with the slogan \"What have I got to hide?\" Abolafia died in 1995, reportedly of a drug overdose.\nThe Nudist Ball, a precursor to the Exotic Erotic Ball, took place in Mann's Tenderloin, San Francisco, California apartment in 1978 and attracted a few hundred people. In 1979, it moved to California Hall on Turk Street and officially became the Exotic Erotic Ball, with 800 to 900 people paying $10 apiece.\n\nThe location changed over the years ending up at its last home at the Cow Palace in Daly City. In May 2004, Republican legislators in California—countering a move to outlaw gun shows at the Cow Palace—unsuccessfully sought to ban the ball as well. In 2010, the expo and ball relocated from the Cow Palace to the new Craneway Pavilion in Richmond, California. The move meant that instead of having 20,000 people, organizers would be limited to 14,000 attendees into the Craneway Pavilion on the Richmond waterfront over two days. Organizers expected 7,500 attendees, but canceled the 2010 event the day before it was scheduled to occur, citing poor ticket sales and cost overruns. \n\nMany longtime Exotic Erotic Ball attendees were apparently unwilling to travel to Richmond, an industrial city located 25 miles northeast of San Francisco, citing its longtime reputation for being crime-plagued (the city's own police department described Richmond as having a chronic violent crime problem for \"decades\" and in 2010 was ranked as the 6th most dangerous city in the United States).\n\nThe Exotic Erotic Ball fostered strong ties to the San Francisco community. Over the years, the Ball distributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to charities supporting causes such as helping the victims of natural disasters, AIDS, homelessness, domestic violence, child abuse, and has always supported freedom of expression and First Amendment Rights. The Exotic Erotic Ball hosted an annual blood drive with Blood Centers of the Pacific whereby free tickets were offered to those who donated blood.\n\nFor several years, Mann also held an Exotic Erotic New Year's Eve Ball, but discontinued it in 1995. \n\nIn 2001, Mann released the book \"The Exotic Erotic Ball: Twenty Years of the World's Sexiest Party\" (). Perry Mann: \"My late partner's Louis' expression 'Make Love, Not War' was once the rallying cry of a generation. I don't think that message has ever been more timely or important than it is today, and I don't think our show has ever been a more needed diversion.\" \n\nIn September 2011, Mann announced that they were \"pursuing an international opportunity\" and \"editing our 30-year documentary\" but not producing an event. They did recommend a new event called: \"Masquerotica,\" to be held on October 22, 2011 at The Concourse in San Francisco—one of the old Ball's longtime venues. In an announcement posted on the Exotic Erotic Ball's Website, Mann promised, \"You'll see a lot of familiar faces ... and other body parts.\" Masquerotica is produced by different local event producers and other than being recommended by Mann has no affiliation to the Exotic Erotic Ball. Another similar but unrelated event, held in September 2012 at Cow Palace, is the XO Ball and Expo.\n\n"}

Usually credited as being the first to use a knee-sitting figure, he is known as \"The Father of Modern Ventriloquism\".\n\nRussell was born in London, and began his career as a journalist, but from 1882 began performing his hobby of ventriloquism in public. In 1886, when he was editor of the \"Hackney and Kingsland Gazette\", he was offered a professional engagement at London's Palace Theatre and took up his stage career permanently. His act, based on the cheeky-boy dummy \"Coster Joe\", broke from the prevailing format of a family of dummies, establishing a precedent for performers such as Edgar Bergen and Paul Winchell.\n\nAccording to \"The Times\" obituary, he changed his name because of the political flavour of \"Parnell\".\n\nIn 1910, Russell published a book on his craft entitled \"Ventriloquism and Kindred Arts\". His act remained popular for several decades, involving prolonged tours of Britain, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, as well as visits to the United States and Ceylon. In 1938 he appeared at the Royal Command Performance. He was active in promoting the variety show genre and was an early and leading member of the Grand Order of Water Rats. He was a founder of the Variety Artistes' Federation. In 1948 he was awarded an OBE for his long services to the profession.\n\nHe continued to perform late in life, giving televised music hall performances in 1952, billed as \"the oldest ventriloquist in the world\". He died in Wembley, aged 95.\n\nFred Russell lived in Kenilworth Court in Putney, London, from 1914 to 1926. A blue plaque by the entrance of Kenilworth Court commemorates him.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "39155724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39155724", "title": "German playing cards", "text": "German playing cards\n\nGerman playing cards are a style of playing cards used in many parts of Central Europe. Playing cards (\"Spielkarten\") entered German-speaking lands around the late 1370s. The earliest cards were likely Latin-suited like in Italy and Spain. After much experimentation, the cards settled into new suits of Acorns (\"Eichel\"), Leaves (\"Grün\", \"Blatt\", \"Laub\" or \"Gras\"), Hearts (\"Herz\") and Bells (\"Schelle\" or \"Schell\") around 1450. Closely related Swiss playing cards are used in German-speaking Switzerland. The French suit symbols were derived from the German ones around 1480. German-suited cards spread throughout Central Europe into areas that were once under German or Austrian control (Hungary, Slovenia, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Croatia, Transylvania, Banat, Vojvodina, South Tyrol, Transcarpathia, and parts of Poland). They were also produced and used as far east as Russia until the early 20th century. German-suited decks are not well known all over these countries including parts of Germany itself as they have been undergoing strong competition from French playing cards since the late 17th-century. Traditional card games in which the German suits are used include Skat, Schafkopf, Doppelkopf and Watten.\n\nGerman suited decks tend to have fewer cards than either the French, Spanish, or Italian sets. The typical northern German pack has 32 cards ranking from 7, 8, 9, 10, Under Knave (\"Unter\" = inferior / sergeant), Over Knave (\"Ober\" = superior / officer), King (\"König\"), and Ace (\"Ass\") for a total of 32 cards. The \"Ace\" is really a Deuce (\"Daus\") as usually indicated by its two pips. Southern patterns have 36 cards by including the 6.\n\nIn Bavaria, Austria and South Tyrol, the 6 of Bells is known as the \"Weli\" or \"Belle\" which is often used as a wild card. The \"Weli\" first appeared around 1855 in the discontinued Tyrolean pattern and later the Salzburg and William Tell patterns. The 6 of Acorns is known as the \"Spitz\" or \"Soacher\" and is of comparable use, with the \"Weli\" being the higher card. For instance, in the Bavarian Watten game the top three cards following the respective trump ace are - in descending order: \"Maxe\" (= the King of Hearts, nicknamed after Bavaria's first King), \"Belle\" (or \"Welle\") and \"Spitz\". With the exception of the New Altenburg pattern, all cards with the rank of 10 include the Roman numeral X at the top centre of the card.\nThe ace in German and Swiss German sets have a peculiar history. Aces disappeared from German decks during the 15th century. When the Ace was promoted above the King in French packs during the 16th century, the deuce did so as well in Germany leading to the conflation of the Ace and Eeuce. This is why in some sets the ace depicts two pips and is also called a \"Daus\" (deuce). Confusion is avoided when the 7 or 6 became the lowest card in most packs during the 17th and 18th centuries. Players also avoid confusion by alternatively calling the Ace/Deuce a \"Sau\" (sow).\n\nMany regions have their own pattern (\"Bild\") which features their own unique artwork or number of cards. Some patterns are descended from much earlier ones like the Saxon pattern which can trace their ancestry to the 15th-century Stukeley type cards named after their identifier, William Stukeley, in 1763. \n\nNorthern patterns have 32 cards and are used to play Skat. In northern patterns, the acorns are red. The only traditional northern pattern still in production is the Saxon pattern where only pip cards have corner indices. It is a product of a long evolution from the primitive Stukeley type cards imported from Nuremberg. They have been marginalized by the New Altenburg or \"German pattern\", created by Walter Krauss (1908-1985) in the former East Germany, which added corner indices to every card but the Aces.\n\nThe 36 card Bavarian (Munich and Stralsund types), Franconian, and Salzburg (or \"einfachdeutsche\") patterns are descended from the Old Bavarian pattern which itself goes back to the 15th-century Augsburg pattern. Their most notable feature are that the Obers and Unters are engaged in combat except in the suit of leaves where they accompany their fighting comrades by playing musical instruments. Since the 1980s, Italian manufacturers have included 5s into their Salzburg decks to allow the German speaking South Tyroleans to play Italian card games that require 40 cards with suits they are more familiar with. Salzburg decks also inherited the \"Weli\" from its extinct sibling, the Tyrolean pattern.\n\nThe Bohemian (or Prague) pattern is also descended from the Old Bavarian but has only 32 cards like the northern ones. The Salzburg and Bohemian patterns are also not reversible and lack corner indices. Most games require only 32 cards by excluding the 6s such as Schafkopf. Games that require the full deck include Jass and Tarock.\n\nThe Württemberg pattern was invented around 1865 by C.L. Wüst and carries many unique features. The kings were copied from French-suited patterns now found in the Netherlands and Portugal. The Obers were inspired by the Knights in Adler-Cego decks used in nearby Baden. Unters are journeymen. A younger type of this pattern, using different court designs also exist. In the present, the cards are sold as a doubled pack of 48 cards (24 unique cards duplicated). The duplicated cards (7, 10, U, O, K, A of each suit) are used to play Doppelkopf, Pinochle, and Gaigel. They used to be produced in 36 card packs (with every card unique), like other southern patterns, to play Württembergischer Tarock. This was the original format but by 1985 it was restricted to the Palatinate where it died out. Pressman Toy has published a 48 card version where every card is unique to play Karnöffel. It uses the younger type and is mislabeled as the Bavarian pattern.\n\nThe William Tell or Double German (\"doppeldeutsche\") pattern is popular throughout the former Austro-Hungarian Empire. The Ober and Unter cards depict William Tell and other characters from Friedrich Schiller's \"Wilhelm Tell\" (the title character is Ober of Acorns). The play's first Hungarian performance was in 1833 and the first decks were made by József Schneider of Pest around 1835. The characters from the drama were chosen to avoid censorship at the time of the Hungarian opposition to Habsburg rule. The story, after all, was about a successful revolt against the Habsburgs. \n\nWhen Austrians began producing this deck, they changed two of the characters. The Aces or Deuces depict the four seasons which are also somewhat different in the Austrian and Hungarian versions. The Slovak-Moravian version follows the Austrian version but doesn't label the characters or the seasons. The Kings don't represent anyone in particular and are shown mounted on horses. Except for the Aces, all pip cards have Roman numerals. The suit symbols are also slightly different, most notably the leaves are now half yellow and end with three tips. They come in packs of 32, 33 (with the \"Weli\"), or 36 cards. They are sometimes called \"Swiss cards\" due to the nationality of the characters but this pattern is not used in Switzerland. In Hungary, they are called \"magyar kártya\", i.e. \"Hungarian cards\".\n\nThe characters and seasons depicted by the cards are as follows:\n\nAfter the unification and reunification of Germany, compromise decks were created to help players from around the country who were used to different suits. The Skat Congress decks split cards diagonally with one half using the pattern with French suits and the other half using the pattern with German suits. This is not unique to Germany as similar split decks are found in Austria, Switzerland and even France.\n\nThe Turnierbild pack was created for official Skat tournaments, using the French suited Berlin pattern but with German colours (green Spades and yellow Diamonds).\n"}

The series premiered in syndication on August 31, 1998, and on ABC through its Disney's One Saturday Morning block on September 12, 1998. The syndicated run lasted 52 episodes, while the ABC run lasted 13 episodes.\n\n\"Disney's Hercules\", like the animated series \"Disney's The Little Mermaid\", is a spin-off of the 1997 theatrically released animated film of the same name (Hercules) and is based on his teenaged adventures, though it is not a prequel to the film of the same name (\"Disney's The Little Mermaid\" featured tales of a 16-year-old Ariel which occurred before the start of the theatrical film) or truly a sequel like \"Disney's Aladdin\" (whose tales takes place after the original film and The Return of Jafar). Rather, the \"Hercules\" TV series is a set during the film's song \"One Last Hope\", during his years in training on the Isle of Idra under the tutelage of Philoctetes (Phil) the satyr. Many of the Olympian Gods and Goddesses only glimpsed during the film pay visit to the young hero-to-be and help or hinder him in his adventures. Other characters from the film that appear are the evil god Hades (voiced by James Woods) and winged stallion Pegasus (voiced by Frank Welker). Corey Burton portrayed Hercules' father Zeus, as Rip Torn did not return.\n\nThe series follows Hercules, as a teenager, training as a hero, as well as trying to adjust to life. With his free-spirited friend Icarus, his future-seeing friend Cassandra, and his teacher Philoctetes (\"Phil\"), he battles his evil uncle Hades. Like all teenagers though, Hercules has to worry about peer pressure when the snobbish prince Adonis ridicules him. The series notably contradicts several events in the original film.\n\nThe main cast of the series includes:\n\nThe series was produced by Tad Stones, who had previously done \"Aladdin\". The directors of \"Hercules\", John Musker and Ron Clements, jokingly said to him while the film was being produced: \"Hey, Tad, we're doing a pilot for a series\". The producers decided that the irreverence of the movie would be captured more easily by setting it within the events of the movie, with Stones declaring that \"by ignoring continuity and trying to stay true to the elements of humor and adventure in the film, we came up with a much stronger series that really stands on its own\". Since James Woods signed to voice Hades again, along with most of the cast of the film, many big-name actors were interested in taking part on the show. Over 150 celebrities took a part in the series, some self-lampooning: Merv Griffin played a griffin talk show host, game show host Wink Martindale played a riddle-expert sphinx and Mike Connors, famous for \"Mannix\", played Athenian policeman Chipacles (named after \"CHiPs\").\n\nDisney's revamping of Greek legend moved to the small screen in the late summer of 1998. Disney's Hercules had the Greek god still in \"geek god\" mode, before his \"Zero to Hero\" transformation. In the series, \"Herc\" was enrolled at Prometheus Academy, a school for both gods and mortals. Since events occur before young Herc meets and falls for the lovely Megara (Meg), he is joined by two new friends Cassandra (voiced by comedian Sandra Bernhard) and Icarus (voiced by French Stewart).\n\nThe animated television series' episodes and the direct-to-video film were animated by Toon City Animation, Inc. in Manila, Philippines, Walt Disney Animation Australia, Walt Disney Animation Japan, Studios Basara, Tama Productions, Delta Peak Productions, Frontier Pictures, Win Wood Productions, Nakamura Productions, Wang Films Productions Co., Ltd. and Thai Wang Films Productions Co., Ltd., Hanho Heung-Up Co., Ltd., Plus One Animation, Inc., Sunmin Image Pictures Co., Ltd., Sunwoo Animation, Korea, Hana Animation, Jade Animations International Co., Ltd. and a New Zealand studio called Slightly Off Beat Productions NZ Co., Ltd. which was also based in the other countries of Seoul, Korea, Xindian District, Taipei, Taiwan and Japan.\n\nIn 2000, Hercules moved to the now defunct channel Toon Disney, where it continued airing until 2008.\nDisney XD aired the series for the first time in June 2011 when the channel launched in Canada.\n\nCommonSenseMedia gave the series a rating of 4 stars out of 5, noting that this \"better-than-average spinoff has heart and brawn.\" Calhoun Times and Gordon County News gave the series 3 stars out of 4.\n\nFour episodes of \"Hercules\" were reformatted into the movie \"\" and released to home video. The episode \"Hercules and the Yearbook\" serves as the linking narrative, with random clips replaced with the episodes \"Hercules and the First Day of School\", \"Hercules and the Grim Avenger\" and \"Hercules and the Visit From Zeus\".

In one version, public opinion rises when the \"manager\" executes a number of prisoners with Zyklon B. However, ordering said gas costs money, which can be gathered by forcing the prisoners to work.\n\nSpending too much time without a \"sufficient\" number of executions makes \"public satisfaction\" drop, and having too few working prisoners will soon drive to a resource shortage, and closing of the camp, thus losing the game. Also, prisoners must be \"purchased\" by the camp's \"manager\", and the corpses of the deceased prisoners must be disposed of (the game describes them as \"Müllberg\", German for \"garbage mountain \" or \"pile of garbage\"), an operation which also has an associated cost.\n\nLike other resource management games, this means that ultimately the goal of the game is trying to find an optimal balance and timing between expenses, income, actions and \"production goals\", although with a highly controversial twist.\n\nEach game version was released several times and began to circulate in Austria and Germany during the 1990s; the earliest versions being DOS, text mode games, graphical DOS versions as well as a Windows version called \"KZ manager millennium\". According to a 1991 article written by Linda Rohrbough, an Amiga has been found to exist.

Lottery betting (also known as lotto betting) is a form of online gambling, run by licensed betting firms, where players place bets on the outcome of lottery draws instead of buying physical or online tickets via official lottery operators. \n\nBy betting on the outcome of a lottery draw, rather than purchasing an official ticket, players are able to take part in international and state lottery draws that are usually out of their jurisdiction. For example, a resident of the United Kingdom could place a bet on the outcome of the American lottery draw, Powerball, even though they would not be eligible to buy official tickets.\n\nMost betting firms that provide lottery betting operate using an insurance-backed model.\n\nCompanies using this model are not required to purchase tickets from official lottery operators. Instead, when a player places a wager on a lottery, the company then forwards this bet to a third-party insurance company. The betting company pays a set fee for every wager placed to the insurance company in order to offset the risk of a large lottery prize being won. If a player wins a large prize (such as a jackpot), the insurance company pays the betting company, who subsequently give the money to the winning player. In the event of small prize wins, the betting firm will typically pay the prize directly to the player from their own funds.\n\nInsurance-backed lottery betting firms are required to hold betting licenses in the jurisdictions they wish to operate.\n\nCompanies operating using a ticket reseller model purchase tickets for the official lottery draw on behalf of the player. The company then charges the player the price of the ticket, as well as an extra commission. In the event of a winning ticket, the company collects the winnings from the official lottery operators and then forwards the winnings on to the player. \n\nBetting on the outcome of lottery draws is the most common form of lottery betting. This follows the same format as purchasing online lottery tickets in that players follow the same ruleset as found on the official lottery draw. Typically, this means that players choose the same amount of numbers and win the same prizes if they match these numbers, as they would have if purchasing an official ticket. The cost of betting on a lottery can differ from the cost of purchasing an official lottery ticket.\n\nWith some betting firms, players are also able to bet on certain numbers being drawn, rather than following the ruleset of official lottery operators. For example, a player could bet on just one number being drawn on a specific lottery. With number betting, the betting company can set its own prize amounts and pays out prizes directly to customers.\n\nLottery betting is legal in parts of the world where online gambling is permitted, including most European nations, although it is heavily regulated. Companies offering lottery betting services are required by law to hold a relevant gambling license for the jurisdiction of their customers. Following a year of consultation, the British Government banned third-party betting on the EuroMillions lottery in April 2018. This was, in part, due to its violation of the Gambling Act 2005, and \"closed the loophole\" used by betting companies to allow gamblers to bet on international lotteries in the UK.\n"}

Thus, \"outlaw\" is still commonly used to mean those violating the law or, by extension, those living that lifestyle, whether actual criminals evading the law or those merely opposed to \"law-and-order\" notions of conformity and authority (such as the \"outlaw country\" music movement in the 1970s).\n\nThe colloquial sense of an outlaw as bandit or brigand is the subject of a monograph by British author Eric Hobsbawm: Hobsbawm's book discusses the bandit as a symbol, and mediated idea, and many of the outlaws he refers to, such as Ned Kelly, Mr. Dick Turpin, and Billy the Kid, are also listed below.\n\nThe stereotype owes a great deal to English folklore precedents, in the tales of Robin Hood and of gallant highwaymen. But outlawry was once a term of art in the law, and one of the harshest judgments that could be pronounced on anyone's head.\n\nThe outlaw is familiar to contemporary readers as an archetype in Western films, depicting the lawless expansionism period of the United States in the late 19th century. The Western outlaw is typically a criminal who operates from a base in the wilderness, and opposes, attacks or disrupts the fragile institutions of new settlements. By the time of the Western frontier, many jurisdictions had abolished the process of outlawry, and the term was used in its more popular meaning. Some Old West outlaws, such as Billy the Kid and Jesse James, became legendary figures in Western lore both in their own lifetime and long after their deaths.\n\n\n\n\"Cangaceiros\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Hajduci\"\n\n\n\n\"Klephtes\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Australia two gangs of bushrangers have been made outlaws – that is they were declared to have no legal rights and anybody was empowered to shoot them without the need for an arrest followed by a trial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It features the characters Reginald Barclay and Deanna Troi from \"\". Paris's dad Admiral Paris played by Richard Herd, makes contact with his son. This also marks a continuation of the story arc of Picard's Enterprise with contact between Voyager crew and Barclay who had served aboard the Enterprise D, and first contact with Earth by Voyager since \"\" (S4E14).\n\nPreviously, the Star Trek character Reginald Barclay had appeared in the Voyager show in \"\" (S2E3), however, although played by the same actor in that episode it was a holographic simulation of Barclay. The same actor playing as Barclay had appeared in cinema in the feature film (1996).\n\nOn Earth, Reginald Barclay is involved in the Pathfinder project, an effort to communicate with the USS \"Voyager\" stranded in the Delta Quadrant. Barclay soon becomes obsessed. He loses himself in the reality of the holographic \"Voyager\" created for the project, enjoying the false friendships within.\n\nHe seeks help from old friend and shipmate Counselor Deanna Troi who advises him to forge real relationships and stop straying into the holo-program he has created of the \"Voyager\" ship and crew. When Admiral Paris visits the project to inspect progress, Barclay ignores orders from Commander Harkins, the project leader, not to bother the Admiral with his infeasible suggestions. Barclay puts forward his theory that using the MIDAS Array (an advanced sensor array), and computing \"Voyager\"s progress from their last contact, they would be able to create a micro wormhole in the Delta Quadrant near \"Voyager\" and use it to create a two way communication link. Admiral Paris is intrigued by this and promises to give it further study which Barclay is highly excited by, but at a later meeting with Admiral Paris, Barclay oversteps the line and is removed from the project for insubordination.\n\nLater that night, he breaks back in to the Pathfinder project to prove his theory is correct. He hacks into the system and sends commands to the array which, as he predicted, creates the wormhole in the Delta Quadrant. As he attempts to contact \"Voyager\" using the array, Starfleet detects and sends security personnel to stop him. Barclay locks out the system and takes refuge in the holodeck simulation of \"Voyager\" where he continues to direct the wormhole to locate \"Voyager\". The security officers led by Commander Harkins follow Barclay into the simulation where the faux \"Voyager\" crew rebels, even firing on the security officers. Of course, this has no effect except to momentarily distract them as the safety protocols are on. The holo-Torres is destroyed by a pursuing Commander Harkins, who shuts down the primary cooling systems on the holographic \"Voyager\" which will cause the warp core to overheat and breach, effectively destroying the entire program unless Barclay complies and releases command back to him.\n\nAs a dejected Barclay is led out, Admiral Paris enters the lab and announces that Barclay's idea has real promise and should be explored further. As he is informed that the attempt has already been made and was unsuccessful, Admiral Paris expresses regret at Barclay's choice to disregard protocol.\n\nMeanwhile, the real \"Voyager\", far in the Delta Quadrant, detects the micro-wormhole and a communication signal which Seven of Nine disbelievingly identifies as Federation in origin on a Starfleet Emergency Channel. The crew attempts to clear up the signal while back on Earth, the jubilant officers and Barclay assist. For a few seconds the team on Earth clear up the return signal, two-way communication is established for 86 seconds before the micro-wormhole collapses. A few words are exchanged and data from \"Voyager\"s logs, crew reports, and navigational records are transmitted to Earth. Barclay sends \"data on some new hyper-subspace technology\", along with recommended modifications to the ship's communications system, so that \"Voyager\"s crew will be able to keep regular contact with home. In the final seconds, the crew hear some moving words from Admiral Paris ending with, \"I want you all to know we're doing everything we can to bring you home.\"\n\nTo celebrate the knowledge that home is looking for them and regular communication will be possible in due time, the crew of \"Voyager\" hold a party in honor of Barclay. They discuss what little they know of him through his personnel record and declare him an honorary \"Voyager\" crewmember.\n\nBarclay and Troi shows:\n\n"}

The revue has received several productions, beginning with its premiere in England in 1992, Broadway in 1999 and the West End in 2014.\n\nThe revue came about due to many requests for an update to \"Side by Side by Sondheim\" (1976). Having resisted a new show, he was finally convinced by producer Cameron Mackintosh, and Julia McKenzie was brought in to assist.\n\n\"Putting It Together\" was first performed on January 27, 1992 at the Old Fire Station Theatre in Oxford, England, where it ran for 24 performances. Directed by Julia McKenzie and produced by Cameron Mackintosh, the cast included Diana Rigg, Clive Carter, Claire Moore, Clarke Peters, and Kit Hesketh-Harvey.\n\nThe Manhattan Theatre Club production opened Off-Broadway on April 1, 1993 at New York City Center, where it ran for 59 performances and 37 previews.

The cast included Stephen Collins, Christopher Durang, Michael Rupert, Rachel York, and Julie Andrews, making her return to the New York City stage after an absence of more than 30 years. \n\nThe markedly revised revue now had a slight plot: At an all-night, black-tie party in a penthouse. The hosts, an older couple (Andrews and Collins) face their disillusions and marital troubles; a younger, less jaundiced couple (Rupert and York) struggle with their feelings and desires, and a commentator (Durang) oversees and influences the action. The spouses deal with infidelity and divorce but finally reconcile before dawn. A cast recording was released by RCA Records.\n\nA production at the Mark Taper Forum (Los Angeles) transferred to Broadway the following year, opening November 21, 1999 at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, where it ran for 101 performances and 22 previews. Directed by Eric D. Schaeffer and choreographed by Bob Avian, the Broadway cast included Carol Burnett (Wife), George Hearn (Husband), Ruthie Henshall (Young Woman), John Barrowman (Young Man), and Bronson Pinchot (Observer). Kathie Lee Gifford replaced Burnett at some performances. The production marked the return of Burnett to the Broadway stage after performing in \"Moon Over Buffalo\" in 1995.

{"id": "56531485", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56531485", "title": "Sexual abuse in Hollywood", "text": "Sexual abuse in Hollywood\n\nThere have been cases and accusations of sexual abuse in Hollywood, a neighborhood in Los Angeles, California, notable as the home of the U.S. film industry, reported against people related to the medium of cinema. Ever since the first film studio was founded there in 1911, Hollywood became an emblematic place for the development of world cinema.\n\nAccusations of sexual assault in the industry go back to 1921, and during the last decades they have gained strength due to the accusations against producers, directors, actors and related publicists. Speculation about sexual assault in the industry grew in 1977, when director Roman Polanski left the United States after being convicted on charges of sexual abuse against a minor.\n\nIn October 2017, the issue reached widespread media coverage after producer Harvey Weinstein was accused of sexual abuse by more than 80 women. The accusations to Weinstein led to dozens of men and women to publicly began to denounce sexual aggressions, in what became known as the Weinstein effect and the Me Too movement. Some actors in the medium joined the protest and became sensitized with the victims. The subject continues being object of general interest for the public opinion.\n\nThe first mediatic case occurred on September 5, 1921, when comic actor Roscoe Arbuckle was accused of sexual abuse against actress Virginia Rappe. Arbuckle had organized a party in which, accordong to the accusation, he took advantage of Rappe's alcoholic state to rape her. The aggression was so violent that Rappe died four days later. The news reached an important repercussion when journalist William Randolph Hearst wrote columns in which he directly accused Arbuckle and added details to the event, such as that Arbuckle had raped Rappe with a bottle. Arbuckle was the defendant in three widely publicized trials for the rape of Rappe, and after the first two trials, which resulted in hung juries, Arbuckle was acquitted in the third trial and received a formal written statement of apology from the jury. Despite Arbuckle's acquittal, the scandal was enough to end his career.\n\nAnother case was exposed after the death of actress Natalie Wood, who died in 1981 when she fell from her yacht and drowned. After her death, an alleged rape that occurred during the 1950s was revealed, allegedly committed by a major actor at the time. Wood herself had refused to reveal the name of her rapist; however, in 2011, after the publication of a book about the life of the actress, it was speculated that the abuser had been the actor Kirk Douglas. A year later, through a blog, an anonymous user published a note stating that Douglas, while drunk, had raped her when the actress was 18 years old, and that Wood did not dare to denounce Douglas at the time because \"he was a money machine\". Later rumors pointed to actor Robert Downey Jr. as the person who wrote the note, allegedly preferring to remain anonymous to avoid retaliation. Douglas was 96 years old at the time of its publication, but never made a statement on the subject.\n\nIn 2016, actress Tippi Hedren claimed in her autobiography that in 1963, she had been sexually harassed by film director Alfred Hitchcock during the filming of the film \"The Birds\" and that he had forbidden other male actors to approach her.\n\nAt the end of 2016, it was reported that in 1972, Marlon Brando had sexually abused actress Maria Schneider during a scene from the film \"Last Tango in Paris\". According to the reports, neither Brando nor director Bernardo Bertolucci warned the actress that she would film a sexual scene with Brando that day, leading in turn to reports that Bertolucci had \"confessed\" to Schneider being raped on set, prompting Bertolucci to release a statement clarifying that a simulation and not an actual intercourse took place.\n\nIn 1977, Samantha Gailey, then 13 years old, accused director Roman Polanski of forcing her to have sex with him. Gailey described that the director took her to the house of actor Jack Nicholson in Los Angeles, under the argument of wanting her as a model for a photo shoot for \"Vogue\" magazine. There, Polanski supplied quaaludes and later photographed her topless. Both were alone in Nicholson's house, so Polanski took advantage to take her to the master bedroom and then rape her. Polanski was accused of sexual abuse of a minor, drug use, perversion and sodomy. The prosecution ordered 90 days of state prison that included a psychiatric evaluation, while deliberating the final sentence. However, Polanski requested another 90-day probation period to finish a then-current project, which was granted. After filming finished, the director returned to his native France where, due to the terms of his sentence, his French nationality prevented him from being extradited to the United States. Since then, he has lived in Europe.\n\nThe Polanski case sparked the interest of the American media who condemned the actions of the French authorities. In March 2003, during the 75th Academy Awards ceremony, Polanski was awarded the Academy Award for Best Director for the film \"The Pianist\"; Polanski did not attend. Attendees at the ceremony gave the director a standing ovation despite being absent. In September 2009, he was arrested at the Zürich Airport in Switzerland at the request of American authorities on the Samantha Gailey case, however, the following year, the Justice Department announced that Switzerland would not extradite Polanski. In 2016, the Supreme Court of Poland also refused to reopen the case. In 2017, Gailey herself asked to close the case, arguing that she only preferred to \"turn the page.\"\n\nGailey was joined by three other women who accused the filmmaker, including actress Charlotte Lewis, who in 2010 accused Polanski of predatory sexual conduct against her when she was 16 years old, claiming that Polanski insisted that she sleep with him in return for casting her in \"Pirates\". As of 2018, Polanski lives in Poland.\n\nIn 1978, actress Mia Farrow and her husband André Previn adopted Soon-Yi Previn, born in Seoul. After Farrow's divorce from Previn, she began a relationship with film director Woody Allen. Besides Farrow's children from her previous relationship with Previn, Farrow and Allen had a son, Ronan Farrow, and adopted two others. In 1992, rumors about a crisis in the relationship between Farrow and Allen were confirmed when she stated that she had discovered her adopted daughter Soon-Yi having sex with Allen. At that time Soon-Yi was 17 years old. After that, the relationship was finished and Farrow was left with the custody of all her children. The court granted Allen an agreement that he could see them with Farrow's permission. On August 4, 1992, Farrow left all her children with Allen while she went shopping. According to a later statement, Allen took advantage of the moment to go down to the basement with one of his adopted daughters, Dylan Farrow, then 7 years old, and later sexually abuse her. A legal dispute began for the total custody of the minors and Allen was taken to court, although the accusation did not proceed. A year later, a doctor at the Yale–New Haven Hospital's Children's Sexual Abuse Clinic stated that Dylan Farrow's rape story was possibly an invention of the girl caused by the stress of living in a volatile home. Dylan Farrow, by then 28, repeated the assault allegation in February 2014 in an open letter in \"The New York Times\" blog of Nicholas Kristof, a family friend, stating, \"when I was seven years old, Woody Allen took me by the hand and took me to a dark attic on the second floor of our house. I played with my brother's electric train, then he sexually abused me, he talked to me while he was doing it, whispering to me that he was a good girl, that was our secret and he promised me that we would go to Paris and make me a movie star.\"\n\nAlthough Allen has denied all the accusations against him, his son Ronan Farrow defended his sister and became one of the main activists against sexual abuse and one of the first to write a report about the sexual abuse allegations against Harvey Weinstein, leading to the Weinstein effect and the Me Too movement. Allen has been married to Soon-Yi since 1997. After the 2017 accusations, actors such as Griffin Newman, Ellen Page, Evan Rachel Wood, David Krumholtz, Greta Gerwig, Mira Sorvino, Rebecca Hall, Timothée Chalamet, Rachel Brosnahan, Natalie Portman, Colin Firth, Marion Cotillard, Chloë Sevigny, Joaquin Phoenix, Hayley Atwell, Peter Sarsgaard, Elle Fanning, and Michael Caine publicly expressed their regret for having worked with Allen; with Newman, Hall, Chalamet and Fanning saying they would donate their earnings from Allen's film \"A Rainy Day in New York\" (2018) to charities. On the other hand, actors Diane Keaton, Alec Baldwin, and Cherry Jones came out in his defense.\n\nIn April 2014, Michael F. Egan claimed that his acting career was cut short in 1999 when he refused to continue attending \"parties\" held by powerful men from the film industry. Egan publicly denounced Bryan Singer, director of films like \"The Usual Suspects\" and the \"X-Men\" film series of abusing him in those parties that took place inside a mansion in Los Angeles and whose requirement for men was not to wear a swimsuit and swim completely naked. According to his testimony, when he was 15 years old, Singer raped him after forcing him to inhale cocaine. Egan explained that both Singer and other men threatened him and his family under the argument that they controlled Hollywood, and that they added: \"If you do not keep the members of this group happy, we will eliminate you.\" Singer denied the accusations, however, in 2017 another man identified as César Sánchez-Guzmán said that the director forced him to perform oral sex on him in 2003. Sánchez-Guzmán claimed to the \"New York Times\" that Singer organized parties aimed at the gay community in Hollywood and that he had threatened to \"ruin his reputation if he ever spoke.\"\n\nEgan also accused Garth Ancier, former president of BBC America, David Neuman, former president of Disney Channel, and Gary Goddard, a Broadway producer, of participating in the violations. Jeff Herman, his attorney, said: \"Hollywood has a problem with the sexual exploitation of children.\" During 2011, photographs showing a party organized by Singer and director Roland Emmerich showing a pool where mature and young men shared were shown.\n\nIn November 2017, actor Corey Feldman expressed his interest to make a documentary that portrays pedophilia in Hollywood and the \"sectors of power\" within the industry. Feldman alleged that he suffered sexual abuse within what he described as a \"network of prostitution.\" Feldman said he would seek the money to hire lawyers to back them up, since the material to be published would make a direct statement against \"six main Hollywood producers who would seek to deny it.\" Feldman also said that actor Corey Haim, who was one of his friends and who died in 2010 from an drug overdose, had died without being able to confess to the public the name of the person who raped him when both were looking for a job opportunity. Feldman had already participated in the 2014 documentary \"An Open Secret\", which exhibited the sexual abuse committed during the casting and the recruitment of young actors in movies or commercials, by the people of the film industry. The documentary also makes multiple references to the accusations against Singer, and the opinions of the children's parents, who at some point saw themselves in the need to \"trust\" the agents for the means to improve their economic condition. Similarly, the case of photographer Bob Villard was exposed in the material. According to the statements, Villard took photographs of children and adolescents and then sold them without permission or authorization from parents through the eBay portal as erotic content.\n\nAmong the defendants were also Martin Weiss, manager of child actors who was arrested in 2011. Despite denying having sexual acts with minors, a recording showed that Weiss had confessed to \"being with a child.\" The recording was made by Jason James Murphy, who stated that in 1996 when he was eleven years old and Weiss was his manager, the man took him to a field where he asked him \"if he had seen someone's penis,\" then he abused him. Weiss was sentenced to 15 years in prison, a sentence he ultimately did not fully serve. The accusations also reached the producer Marc Collins-Rector, friend of Singer, who was accused of sexual abuse against boys and adolescents. Collins-Rector achieved a judicial agreement and moved to the Dominican Republic.\n\nIn other cases, actor Jeffrey Jones was arrested in 2003 after forcing a 14-year-old boy to pose nude for him; Jones did not deny the accusations. In the 1980s, Victor Salva (director of \"Jeepers Creepers\") served 15 months in prison for abusing one of his actors, a 12-year-old boy, and for forcing him to have oral sex with another 14-year-old boy.\n\nSince 2014, around 60 women publicly accused actor and television presenter Bill Cosby who according to his statements had sexually abused them during the 1970s and 1980s. Most coincided that Cosby had drugged them to facilitate the aggression. For example, former model Janice Dickinson said that one afternoon in 1982, while suffering from intense menstrual pain, Cosby recommended a \"pill\" that supposedly calmed the discomfort. \"The last thing I remember is losing consciousness and Cosby over me as the monster he is,\" she told CNN. In the same article, Cosby is held responsible for raping a 15 year old minor.\n\nBill Cosby faced two trials (the second still ongoing) on charges of sexual abuse. In January 2018, he joked about the issue and appeared unconcerned.\n\nThere were two high-profile accusations around the time of the 89th Academy Awards.\n\nIn October 2016, after the premiere of the movie \"The Birth of a Nation\", its director and main actor, Nate Parker was singled out for a 1999 case, when he and his friend Jean Celestin (who co-wrote the film) were accused of sexually abusing a 18-year-old woman after drugging her. During the promotion of the film, the case resurfaced when the victim's brother published that she never overcame the abuse committed and that she had committed suicide in 2012, claiming that she could never file a complaint since Parker himself threatened her not to do so. The promotion of \"The Birth of a Nation\" was involved in a climate of accusations against its director, which were credited with making the film not go beyond expectations.\n\nActor Casey Affleck was also singled out for sexual harassment. According to reports, during the filming of the film \"I'm Still Here\", Affleck was accused of sexually harassing Amanda White and Magdalena Gorka, producer and director of photography of the film respectively. Both parties reached an out-of-court settlement in 2010. Actress Brie Larson, who having won a year earlier the Best Actress Award at the Academy Awards, had to give the award to Affleck as Best Actor, did not applaud when the actor went on stage to collect the award. Later she would say that, \"whatever it was that I did onstage kind of spoke for itself\". In January 2018, Affleck declared that he would not present the Academy Award for Best Actress at the 90th Academy Awards ceremony, the reason being credited to not wanting to be the subject of attention at a time of the Me Too movement.\n\nThe subject of sexual abuse in Hollywood acquired important significance in the world media in 2017, after producer Harvey Weinstein, founder of Miramax and The Weinstein Company, was accused by more than 80 women of having sexually assaulted them. The accusations ranged from sexual harassment to rape; Weinstein denied any wrongdoing. According to the women's reports, Weinstein invited young actresses or models to a hotel room or office on the pretext of discussing his career, and then demanded massages or sexual intercourse. During an audio revealed during the ensuring scandal, Weinstein can be heard pressing model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez to accompany him to take a shower, and after her refusal, the producer insists with the phrase, \"I will not do anything to you, I swear it for my children.\"\n\nAmong the actresses who claim to have suffered harassment or rape by Weinstein are Rose McGowan, Angelina Jolie, Mira Sorvino, Paz de la Huerta, Annabella Sciorra and Gwyneth Paltrow. Another one of them, the Italian actress Asia Argento, elaborated a list in which accusations of sexual abuse against Weinstein were collected. The incidents alleged in the list date from 1980 to 2015, and include 18 complaints of rape. In them it was alleged that Weinstein conditioned important roles in films in exchange for sexual favors. As a result, The Weinstein Company and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences decided to expel Weinstein.\n\nThe accusations against Weinstein led to the disclosure of a considered number of victims of other sexual assaults by people in the film industry.\n\nOn October 30, 2017, actor Anthony Rapp stated that in 1986, while still a minor, he had been sexually harassed by actor Kevin Spacey during a party held at Spacey's home. According to the statement, Rapp was in Spacey's bedroom watching TV, when Spacey walked in drunk and laid on top of Rapp. In response to these allegations, Spacey alleged that he did not remember behaving inappropriately, and asked for forgiveness if it was so. In the same statement, Spacey publicly declared that he was gay. The accusations against Spacey were aggravated when technical staff from the television series \"House of Cards\" (which Spacey starred) declared that the actor frequently harassed men during filming. Mexican actor Roberto Cavazos also accused Spacey of harassing him. In his story he said, \"It seems that it only took being a male under 30 to make Mr. Spacey feel free to touch us.\"\n\nAfter the accusations, Spacey announced his admission to the clinic The Meadows, in Arizona, to undergo treatment for sex addiction. Netflix broke commercial ties with the actor and his participation in the film \"All the Money in the World\" was eliminated; actor Christopher Plummer had to re-shoot the scenes of Spacey's character. \"House of Cards\" later announced that its following sixth season would be the series' last, and that it would be filmed without Spacey.\n\nThe accusations to Harvey Weinstein unleashed a campaign through the hashtag Me Too with which different people joined the list of victims of sexual abuse by actors, directors and producers. The comedian Louis C.K. and filmmaker Brett Ratner had projects canceled after at least six accusations each; C.K. later confirmed the allegations against him and apologized, while Ratner denied the claims against him. For his part, the filmmaker James Toback had a total of 200 accusations of sexual harassment.\n\nActing coach Anna Graham Hunter declared against the actor Dustin Hoffman claiming that in 1985 during the filming of the television film \"Death of a Salesman\" the actor groped her and harassed her with comments as when she asked him what he wanted to eat at breakfast; Hoffman replied, \"I'll have a hard-boiled egg and a soft-boiled clitoris.\" This accusation was soon followed by those of six other women. Hoffman later released an apology but denied wrongdoing, saying, \"I have the utmost respect for women and feel terrible that anything I might have done could have put her in an uncomfortable situation,\" continuing, \"I am sorry. It is not reflective of who I am,\" but has not publicly responded to the other six allegations. Other actors like Richard Dreyfuss and Jeffrey Tambor denied the accusations against them. In January 2018, after winning the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, James Franco was accused by five women, including Sarah Tither-Kaplan, who claimed that when she was a student of Franco, he forced them to undress and remove the plastic protections during the filming of sexual scenes. Franco did not attend the 23rd Critics' Choice Awards ceremony afterwards.\n\n\"Time\" magazine named the \"Silence Breakers\" behind the #MeToo movement \"Time\" Person of the Year in 2017.\n\nPublic opinion was against not only those who committed sexual abuse but those who covered or silenced it. Actors such as Matt Damon, Ben Affleck and director Quentin Tarantino admitted knowing the sexual crimes of Weinstein. After actress Meryl Streep denied knowing the behavior of the producer, Rose McGowan, one of the victims, rebutted her arguing that Streep had knowledge and called her a \"hypocrite.\" On January 7, 2018, during the 75th Golden Globe Awards ceremony, the vast majority of attendees decided to wear black in solidarity with the victims. The participation of some attendees was criticized, including Streep herself, in addition to Kirk Douglas, due to the accusations regarding Natalie Wood, and of Oprah Winfrey, who after receiving the honorary Cecil B. DeMille Award, dedicated her speech to the victims of such aggressions. That same night, singer Seal declared that Oprah had been a friend of Weinstein and claimed that she knew his behavior.\n\nActor Liam Neeson criticized the social movement, alleging that the accusations against his fellow actors had turned into a witch hunt, adding, \"There are some people, famous individuals, who are suddenly accused of touching a girl's knee, or something like that, and then they are dismissed from their shows.\" In January 2018, French actress Brigitte Bardot called \"hypocrites\" some of the actresses who denounced the abuses. In her statement she said, \"There are many actresses who provoke the producers to obtain a role, then, when speaking of them, they say they were harassed.\"\n\nDuring the 75th Golden Globe Awards ceremony, presenter Seth Meyers said in reference to the movie \"The Shape of Water\" (directed by Guillermo del Toro): \"When I heard that the story of an innocent woman who falls in love with a water monster was filmed, I just said, 'Oh no, not another Woody Allen movie!'\" In 2016, the presenter of the 73th Golden Globe Awards ceremony Ricky Gervais talked about the movie \"Spotlight\" (about a journalist team who investigated the sexual abuse scandal in Boston) thus: \"\"Spotlight\" is the movie about how a group of sexual predators was allowed to abuse children and continue working with impunity and without punishment. Roman Polanski called it 'the best romantic comedy in history.'\" At the 85th Academy Awards ceremony in 2013, host Seth MacFarlane joked when announcing the Best Supporting Actress nominees: \"Congratulations, you five ladies no longer have to pretend to be attracted to Harvey Weinstein.\"\n\nThe psychology center Cepsim in Madrid, Spain described in summary the profile of the abuser: \"They are men or women with a lot of power who use it with vulnerable people to get what they want. Normally they lack empathy, which is what places us in someone else's pain and makes us not hurt or be selfish.\" The Department of Psychology of the University of Málaga added that the rapist does not usually assimilate that he is committing a crime, since his mind is usually narcissistic. People with media power usually present themselves with a \"charming\" personality and enjoy good public relations, so when the abuse is uncovered the laws themselves doubt the victims. The personality of abusers in show business also has atypical behaviors such as quoting actresses and models to castings or sign contracts in unusual places such as hotel rooms or private rooms. After the abuse they resort to blackmail or a direct threat to silence the victim. Criminal law lawyer Alicia Ozores explained to the newspaper \"La Vanguardia\" that some abusers tried to take refuge under the argument that \"they were addicted to sex\", this in order to reduce a sentence and cleanse their image because sex addiction is a recognized disorder. Weinstein and Spacey used the argument in response to the accusations against them. According to the psychological profile of the abuser, many stalkers and rapists dod not need to resort to physical violence, since they used persuasion, deception or pressure to subdue the victim, based on their authoritative relationship. In the case of child abuse itself, the rapist would be opportunistic, taking advantage of the carelessness of the parents and in this case of their desire to venture into the media.\n\nRegarding the victims, their fear is usually related to the disbelief of public opinion and to being judged by it. Usually, the society condemns the abuse but in turn questions the reason why the victim did not speak or denounce before. Brazilian psychologist Flavia Dos Santos told Colombian newspaper \"El País\" that victims are usually convinced to speak when they are told that their statement can contribute to cases to happen less and less. The victim usually feels helpless to know that his abusers are people with media power and as a result can enjoy impunity when he has public demand. Many of The later behaviors of the victims, such as guilt or disbalance in interpersonal relationships, were shown in the documentary \"An Open Secret\", where victims narrate that sexual abuse has been assumed as part of the culture in Hollywood and for that reason nobody has worried about eradicating it.\n\nSexual abuse as a result of having a position of power was one of the issues during the 2016 United States presidential election, particularly when in October of the same year and a month before the election, an audio recording was released that dated from 2005 in which Donald Trump, then the presidential candidate for the Republican Party, was heard expressing himself in 2005 on how he used his power to \"grab women.\" In 2005, Trump, still removed from politics, was the judge of the television show \"The Apprentice\", a concept he had created for NBC. In the recording Trump argued about women, \"when you're a star, they let you do anything. Grab them by the pussy.\"\n\nThat same day, Trump gave a statement in which he apologized for the video's content, and said that \"he was not perfect.\" Likewise, during the third presidential debate he argued: \"nobody respects women more than me.\" Trump won the presidential election a month later and a year later the production company Brave New Films presented a video that compiled the testimonies of 16 women who publicly accused Trump of harassing or sexually assaulting them.\n\nIn October 2017, former President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed their sympathy with victims of sexual abuse. Obama would testify about the specific behavior of Weinstein, \"Michelle and I are disgusted by the recent reports on Harvey Weinstein; any man who degrades women in that way should be condemned and held accountable, regardless of their wealth or condition.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "27193568", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27193568", "title": "Shrek Forever After", "text": "Shrek Forever After\n\nShrek Forever After (previously promoted as Shrek: The Final Chapter) is a 2010 American computer-animated, comedy film by DreamWorks Animation. It is the fourth installment in the \"Shrek\" film franchise and the sequel to \"Shrek the Third\" (2007). The film was directed by Mike Mitchell from a script by Josh Klausner and Darren Lemke, and stars Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, Antonio Banderas, Julie Andrews, and John Cleese reprising their previous roles, with Walt Dohrn introduced in the role of Rumpelstiltskin. The plot follows Shrek struggling as a family man with no privacy, who yearns for the days when he was once feared. He is tricked by Rumpelstiltskin into signing a contract that leads to disastrous consequences.\n\nThe film premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 21, 2010. It was theatrically released in the United States by Paramount Pictures on May 21, 2010, in 3D and IMAX 3D formats. The film debuted as the top-grossing film at the box office, a position it held for three consecutive weeks in the United States and Canada, grossing a worldwide total of $752 million and becoming the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2010. In addition, \"Shrek Forever After\" became DreamWorks Animation's second-highest-grossing film at the foreign box office. Although originally marketed as the final installment in the film franchise, a fifth \"Shrek\" film has unofficially been reported to be in production with speculation it could be released as early as 2019.\n\nIn a flashback, King Harold and Queen Lillian are about to sign the kingdom of Far Far Away over to Rumpelstiltskin, in exchange for lifting their daughter's curse. The deal is abruptly cancelled at the last second when a knight informs the King and Queen that Princess Fiona has been rescued by Shrek. An angry Rumpelstiltskin laments his loss and wishes that Shrek was never born.\n\nIn the present time, Shrek has grown steadily weary of being a family man and celebrity among the local villagers, leading him to wish for when he felt like a \"real ogre\" again. When he takes his family to Far Far Away to celebrate his children's first birthday, a series of mishaps further injure his ego, causing him to lose his temper and walk out in anger.\n\nShrek encounters Rumpelstiltskin, who seizes his chance, having observed Shrek's angry outburst. He follows Shrek and arranges for him to appear to save his life. He gives Shrek a day to live like a real ogre, in exchange for a day from his childhood that he would not remember being erased to \"thank\" him.\n\nShrek signs the contract and appears in an alternate reality where the events starting from Fiona's rescue are irrelevant. Now feared by villagers, he takes the opportunity to cause some lighthearted mischief until he finds \"WANTED\" posters for Fiona and his home deserted and desolate. He is kidnapped by witches and taken to Rumpel, now the King of Far Far Away, which has become derelict and run down.\n\nUpon inquiry, Rumpel reveals that he took away the day Shrek was born. Therefore, Shrek never saved Fiona or met Donkey, and consequently Rumpel was able to trick King Harold and Queen Lillian into signing their kingdom over to him, making them both disappear. When the day ends, Shrek will disappear as well as he was never born in this timeline. Shrek escapes Rumpel's castle with Donkey. Initially terrified of Shrek, Donkey decides to trust him after seeing Shrek cry over his erased history, something he had never seen an ogre do before. After Shrek explains the situation, Donkey helps him find a hidden exit clause: the contract can be nullified by \"true love's kiss\".\n\nThey soon encounter an army of ogres who are resisting Rumpel. The ogres are led by a still-cursed Fiona who, after escaping from the tower where she was held captive, keeps the retired and overweight Puss in Boots as a pet. Shrek does everything he can to gain Fiona's love, but she is too busy preparing an ambush on Rumpel. She is also bitterly cynical and disillusioned about the power of true love and throws herself into planning Rumpel's capture. While sparring with her, Fiona begins to like Shrek, but stops short of kissing him. Puss encourages him to continue pursuing Fiona.\n\nDuring the ambush, the ogres are captured by the Pied Piper, though Shrek and Fiona escape with the intervention of Puss and Donkey. Shrek insists Fiona kiss him, saying it will fix everything; however, because in this altered timeline Fiona does not truly love him, the kiss does not work. When he hears that Rumpel is offering a wish to the one who brings him Shrek, Shrek turns himself in and uses the wish to free the other ogres. Afterwards, Rumpel reveals a captured Fiona whom he is going to feed to Dragon along with Shrek. Donkey leads the Ogre army to storm the castle, battle the witches, and capture Rumpel, while Shrek and Fiona trap Dragon.\n\nAs the sun rises, Shrek begins to fade from existence, but Fiona, having fallen in love with him, kisses Shrek just before he disappears, restoring Shrek to his world just before he lashed out at the party. Shrek embraces his friends and family with a newfound appreciation for everything he has.\n\n\nFollowing the success of \"Shrek 2\", a third and fourth \"Shrek\" film, along with plans for a fifth and final film, were announced in May 2004 by Jeffrey Katzenberg. In October 2006, DreamWorks Animation revealed that the fourth film would be released in 2010.\n\nIn October 2007, Katzenberg announced a title for the fourth film, \"Shrek Goes Fourth\", explaining that \"Shrek goes out into the world, forth!\" In May 2009, however, DreamWorks Animation retitled the film to \"Shrek Forever After\", indicating that it would be the last in the \"Shrek\" series. In November 2009, Bill Damaschke, head of creative production at DreamWorks Animation, confirmed with \"All that was loved about Shrek in the first film is brought to the final film.\"\n\nTim Sullivan was hired to write the script in March 2005, but was later replaced by Darren Lemke and Josh Klausner. Klausner, about the script's evolution, said, \"When I first came onto the project, it wasn't supposed to be the final chapter—there were originally going to be 5 \"Shrek\" movies. Then, about a year into the development, Jeffrey Katzenberg decided that the story that we'd come up with was the right way for Shrek's journey to end, which was incredibly flattering.\" In May 2007, shortly before the release of the third film, it was announced Mike Mitchell would be on board to direct the new installment. Much of the film was written and recorded in New York City.\n\nSimilar to most of the other \"Shrek\" films, the film's original score was composed by British composer Harry Gregson-Williams.\n\n\"Shrek Forever After\" premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 21, 2010. It was publicly released on May 20, 2010, in Russia, while the American release followed the next day. The film was also released in IMAX 3D format. In July 2014, the film's distribution rights were purchased by DreamWorks Animation from Paramount Pictures and transferred to 20th Century Fox before reverting to Universal Pictures in 2018.\n\n\"Shrek Forever After\" earned $238.7 million in North America, and $513.9 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $752.6 million. This made it the 52nd-highest-grossing film, the 12th-highest-grossing animated film, the fifth-highest-grossing of 2010, the second-highest-grossing animated film of 2010 (behind \"Toy Story 3\") and the second-lowest-grossing film of the \"Shrek\" series.\n\n\"Shrek Forever After\" had the widest release for an animated film (4,359 theaters, later expanded to 4,389) in North America. On its opening day (May 21, 2010), it ranked No.1, grossing $20.8 million, which was lower than the opening days of the last two \"Shrek\" films. The film then opened in three days with $70.8 million, lower than box office analysts' predictions of an opening of $105 million and also lower than the two previous films of the franchise. Anne Globe, head of worldwide marketing for DreamWorks Animation, said they were \"happy with the film's opening\" since it debuted at No. 1 and also had the fourth-best opening for an animated film, at the time, in the United States and Canada. \"Shrek Forever After\" was No.1 for three consecutive weekends.\n\nIn North America, it was the eighth-highest-grossing film of 2010, the fourth-highest-grossing DreamWorks Animation film, 2010's third-highest-grossing animated film, trailing \"Toy Story 3\" and \"Despicable Me\" and the lowest-grossing \"Shrek\" film. Executives at DreamWorks Animation were impressed because the film earned $238.7 million in North America, although it was the fourth film in the series, seemingly being outgrown by its fans.\n\nHaving made $513.9 million in other continents, it is the highest-grossing \"Shrek\" film, DreamWorks Animation's second-biggest hit (behind \"\") and the seventh-highest-grossing animated film. It topped the weekend box office once on July 16–18, 2010 with $46.3 million. In Russia and the CIS, its second-highest-grossing country, it had a $19.7 million opening weekend which was a record among animated films. It earned $51.4 million in total. Third in total earnings came the United Kingdom, Ireland and Malta, where it opened with £8.96 million ($13.6 million) and finished its box office run with £31.1 million ($51.1 million).\n\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, \"Shrek Forever After\" has an approval rating of 58% based on 191 reviews, with an average rating of 5.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"While not without its moments, \"Shrek Forever After\" too often feels like a rote rehashing of the franchise's earlier entries.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 58 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, the same score earned by \"Shrek\" and \"Shrek 2\".\n\nStephen Holden of \"The New York Times\" stated \"What fortifies “Shrek Forever After” are its brilliantly realized principal characters, who nearly a decade after the first “Shrek” film remain as vital and engaging fusions of image, personality and voice as any characters in the history of animation.\" Pete Hammond of \"BoxOffice\" gave the film 4.5 stars out of 5, writing \"Hilarious and heartfelt from start to finish, this is the best \"Shrek\" of them all, and that's no fairy tale. Borrowing liberally from Frank Capra's \"It's a Wonderful Life\", this edition blends big laughs and emotion to explore what Far Far Away might have been like if Shrek never existed.\" James Berardinelli of \"Reelviews\" awarded the film 3 out of 4 stars and wrote \"Even though \"Shrek Forever After\" is obligatory and unnecessary, it's better than \"Shrek the Third\" and it's likely that most who attend as a way of saying goodbye to the Jolly Green Ogre will not find themselves wishing they had sought out a more profitable way of spending 90-odd minutes.\"\n\nJames White of \"Empire\" gave the film four out of four stars, saying \"DreamWorks could be entering a period of fresh creativity. With How To Train Your Dragon and a balanced, darker-hued and very funny Shrek finale, they've found the magic again.\" Lisa Schwarzbaum of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the film a \"B−\" grade, saying \"Everyone involved fulfills his or her job requirements adequately. But the magic is gone and \"Shrek Forever After\" is no longer an ogre phenomenon to reckon with.\" Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" wrote \"It's a fun ride. What's missing is the excitement of a new interpretation.\" Mary Pols of \"Time\" concluded her review with \"Can an ogre jump a shark? I think so.\" Giving the film 1 star out of 4, Kyle Smith of the \"New York Post\" wrote \"After the frantic spurt of fairy-tale allusions and jokes in the first three \"Shrek\"s, this one inches along with a few mostly pointless action scenes and the occasional mild pun.\"\n\n\"Shrek Forever After\" was released on DVD and Blu-ray on December 7, 2010. As of April 24, 2011, the movie has made $75 million in DVD and Blu-ray sales. The film is also included in \"Shrek: The Whole Story\", a box set released on the same day that included all four \"Shrek\" movies and additional bonus content.\n\n\"Shrek Forever After\" is an action-adventure video game based on the movie of the same name. It was released by Activision on May 18, 2010.\n\nIn February 2014, in an interview with Fox Business Network, Katzenberg hinted that a fifth film still may be made, saying, \"We like to let [the characters] have a little bit of time to rest. But I think you can be confident that we'll have another chapter in the Shrek series. We're not finished and, more importantly, neither is he.\"\n\nOn June 15, 2016, after NBCUniversal purchased DreamWorks Animation for $3.8 billion, NBCUniversal's president and chief executive officer Steve Burke discussed plans to revive the franchise, as well as other DreamWorks films. In July 2016, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" cited sources saying that a fifth film was planned for a 2019 release. In September 2016, Eddie Murphy confirmed that the film was expected to be released in 2019 or 2020, and that the script had been completed. In October 2016, Mike Mitchell stated that \"Austin Powers\" screenwriter Michael McCullers had written a script based on his own original idea. In March 2017, asked about the script, McCullers said it featured \"a pretty big reinvention\" for the film series.\n\nOn November 6, 2018, it was reported by \"Variety\" that Illumination Entertainment's CEO and founder Chris Meledandri had been tasked by Universal Pictures to revive both \"Shrek\" and \"Puss in Boots\" film series, with the original cast potentially returning.\n\n\"Puss in Boots\" is a computer-animated feature film that was released on October 28, 2011. The movie is based on and follows the character of the same name on his adventures with Kitty Softpaws and mastermind Humpty Dumpty before his first appearance in \"Shrek 2\".\n\n"}

{"id": "615277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=615277", "title": "Stuart Smalley", "text": "Stuart Smalley\n\nStuart Smalley is a fictional character invented and performed by comedian and satirist Al Franken. The character originated on the television show \"Saturday Night Live\", in a mock self-help show called \"Daily Affirmations With Stuart Smalley.\" It first aired on the show's February 9, 1991 episode hosted by Kevin Bacon. Stuart is Franken's middle name. Franken has stated that his \"going to Al-Anon meetings inspired [the character] Stuart [Smalley]\". (He attended the meetings in support of his wife, who was battling alcoholism at the time.)\n\nStuart participates in many (sometimes fictional) programs, not limited to Overeaters Anonymous, Children of Alcoholic Parents Anonymous, and Children of Rageaholic Parents Anonymous. He is an effeminate man with a perfectly coiffed bleached-blond hairdo, who regularly wears a yellow button-down shirt with a powder blue cardigan.\n\nIt is frequently hinted that Stuart may be gay, but his sexual orientation is never clearly stated. All his romantic partners have names which could be male or female, like Dale, Chris, or Merle. His father gripes, \"You'd drink too if you had Liberace for a son.\" \n\nWithin the context of the show, Stuart is quick to point out that he is \"not\" a licensed therapist but relies instead upon the credibility of his own experiences as a non-professional. His guests are very often celebrities; however, Smalley is seemingly unaware of his guests' fame as he never uses their full names so as to \"protect (their) anonymity.\"\n\nOther guests who appeared were his family members, such as Macaulay Culkin playing his nephew or Roseanne Barr playing his sister, who suffers from battered wife syndrome. One Canadian relative named Leon Smalley and played by Kiefer Sutherland also had a show called \"Today's Meditation\", which became a big hit in Canada. Although he is clearly a copycat of Stuart, Leon does seem more self-confident on his show, which could be a reason for his greater success.\n\nThe character was popular enough to spawn a 1992 novel, \"I'm Good Enough, I'm Smart Enough, and Doggone It, People Like Me!: Daily Affirmations with Stuart Smalley\". The book keeps in line with the concept of the character, and is presented (tongue-in-cheek) as a legitimate day-to-day affirmation book. Each page is dated and the reader is \"supposed\" to follow through as if they were actually seeking help. Naturally, however, things go wrong in the writing process, and thus the affirmations branch off into Stuart's own commentary about what a hard time he is having writing it, etc. He also discusses his past relationship with ex-significant-other Dale, \"the Rageaholic\".\n\nAn audiobook was also released, \"You're Good Enough, You're Smart Enough, and Doggone It, People Like You\". The content of this audio book was completely different from the printed one, but followed through on the same gag. The tapes played guided visualizations meant to help the listener relax and focus; however, Stuart makes a vow at the beginning not to make any edits or corrections in the recording process because \"I'm a perfectionist and if I start making changes, I'll never stop.\" As such it is full of humorous errors, including one gag in which Stuart tells his listeners who are driving to work to \"close their eyes and envision...\" something. (As such, there is a warning label on the box that says, \"Do not listen while driving,\" a joke that doesn't make sense until one has actually listened to the tape.)\n\nAs the character's popularity increased, a film was released called \"Stuart Saves His Family\". It chronicled the life Stuart leads and his relationship with a very dysfunctional family. His alcoholic father and enabling mother, overweight sister and equally alcoholic brother call upon him when an aunt dies. He is asked to oversee the sale of her home, bringing much-needed money to all of the family. At the same time, his public access self-help show is canceled. Naturally, things go awry, and he must learn to deal with himself and his own life before he can attempt to help others. While many critics praised the film, including Gene Siskel (who awarded the film 3.5 stars out of four, in his print review) and Roger Ebert, the film was financially unsuccessful.\n\nAccording to a March 1995 article in \"New York\" magazine, Franken regularly lobbied to get the Smalley character on the air more in his last season on \"Saturday Night Live\".\n\nThe character effectively disappeared after the box-office failure of the film and Franken's exit from \"Saturday Night Live\", save one appearance where Smalley, bitter over the failure of the movie, refused to finish his affirmation, excoriated his viewers for not watching, and openly wept. At one point in that skit, Smalley (in reference to the film, its glowing reviews, and the film that beat it) commented: \"But you didn't want 'funny' and 'poignant'. You wanted 'Dumb...and Dumber...and Dumber...and Dumber'!\" In 2002, Franken reprised the Smalley character again when Al Gore hosted, in which he mentioned that his father was still an alcoholic.\n\nThe character also showed up from time to time on \"The Al Franken Show\". Later, after Franken made a bid for a United States Senate seat that ended in success but also in controversy – he would not be officially declared the winner, and therefore under Minnesota law could not be seated, until a full eight months after the election itself – he would be dubbed \"Senator Stuart Smalley\" by critics and fans alike.\n\nThe character is known for a number of catchphrases, many of which are chosen not just for comic effect, but to play on a perceived tendency of the self-help movement to talk and think in psychobabble. Some, such as the phrase \"stinkin' thinkin'\", are taken from common 12-step slogans.\n"}

Often adorned with classical motifs (columns, statues), a sylvan theater may substitute a simple green lawn for built seating and can include elaborate arrangements of shrubs, flowers and other greenery. These alfresco stages may be features of grand formal gardens or parks, or of more intimate settings, and may be intended for either public or private use.\n\nA notable early example of a sylvan theater was the \"Bosquet du Théâtre d’Eau\" (\"Water Theater Grove\") — one of the 14 celebrated \"bosquet\" (\"groves\") in the Gardens of the Palace of Versailles near Paris. The central feature of this \"bosquet\", which was designed for King Louis XIV by Le Nôtre between 1671 and 1674, was the auditorium-like theater sided by three tiers of turf seating that faced a stage decorated with four fountains alternating with three radiating cascades. As part of the replantation of the gardens ordered by King Louis XVI during the winter of 1774-75, the \"Bosquet du Théâtre d’Eau\" was destroyed and replaced with an unadorned garden. (As of 2009, the \"Bosquet du Théâtre d’Eau\" is currently being rebuilt.)\n\n"}

The series, which was originally created by O'Barr as a means of dealing with the death of his girlfriend at the hands of a drunk driver, was first published by Caliber Comics in 1989. It became an underground success, and was later adapted into a film of the same name in 1994. Three film sequels, a television series, and numerous books and comic books (published by numerous companies) have also been subsequently produced.\n\n\"The Crow\" has been translated into almost a dozen languages and has sold around 750,000 copies worldwide.\n\nThe Crow first appeared on the back cover of \"Deadworld\" #10 (November 1988); James O'Barr provided a back cover to the first comic book Caliber Press published, which contained an advertisement for the upcoming The Crow appearance in \"Caliber Presents\" #1. (The ads shows The Crow standing with a smoking shotgun in one hand and a samurai sword in the other, with the statement, \"For Some Things...There Is No Forgiveness\". It mentions The Crow appearing in February 1989.)\n\nThe Crow's first in-story appearance was in \"Caliber Presents\" #1 (January 1989), in the story \"Inertia\", which serves as a prequel to the main series. O'Barr again provided a back cover for this issue.\n\nThe character's first limited series was \"The Crow\" #1-4 (Feb.–May 1989). Four issues, titled \"Pain\", \"Fear\", \"Irony\", and \"Despair,\" take readers through a series of vengeance tales as The Crow cuts and shoots through Tin Tin, Tom Tom, Top Dollar, Funboy and T-Bird, the gang members that attacked and killed him and his lover Shelly.\n\nIn \"A Caliber Christmas\" (Dec. 1989), Eric reflects back on happier times with Shelly in the story \"Atmosphere.\" (In \"The Crow\" graphic novel, this story is placed between issues #2 and 3.)\n\n\"Caliber Presents\" #15 (Sept. 1990) contained a preview of the unpublished \"The Crow\" #5, titled \"Death\", that was meant to complete the original story arc. \n\nTundra Publishing later reprinted Caliber's first four issues in two double-sized volumes and printed \"Death\" (also double-sized) as the third volume.\n\nFrom 1996-1998, Kitchen Sink Press published five mini-series and a one-shot based on The Crow concept with a new avatar in each series.\n\nFollowing the Kitchen Sink series, London Night Studios published \"The Crow/Razor: Kill the Pain\" in 1998, which saw Eric Draven paired with Everette Hartsoe's bad girl character Razor.\n\nIn 1999, Image Comics released a new \"Crow\" comic series with yet another take on the Eric Draven story. It ran for ten issues, ending in November of that year.\n\nIn 2002, Titan Books compiled and released the previous original books into one, making this the first time The Crow appeared as a single book\n\nO'Barr stated in a 2004 interview that an Author's Edition would contain at least \"60 pages of new material that no one has ever seen. Half of that are pages that had to be removed for space reasons.\" O'Barr described the additions as including \"more romance flashback scenes between Eric and Shelly,\" as well as sequences that would make the work \"more visually interesting.\" On January 16, 2010, it was announced on O'Barr's official website that the Author's Edition of \"The Crow\" was indeed going to be released and that O'Barr was currently working on it. On April 7, 2011, O'Barr announced that \"The Crow: Special Edition\" would be released on July 28, 2011, from Gallery Books.\n\nIn July 2012, IDW Publishing published a new five-issue Crow series, \"The Crow: Death and Rebirth\", written by novelist John Shirley (co-writer of the original Crow film) and illustrated by Kevin Colden.\n\nFour more IDW \"Crow\" series followed: \"The Crow: Skinning the Wolves\" (2013), \"The Crow: Curare\" (2013), \"The Crow: Pestilence\" (2014) and \"The Crow: Momento Mori\" (2018).\n\nThe story revolves around an unfortunate young man named Eric. He and his fiancée, Shelly, are assaulted by a gang of street thugs after their car breaks down. Eric is shot in the head and is paralyzed, and can only watch as Shelly is savagely beaten, raped, and shot in the head. They are then left for dead on the side of the road. Eric later dies in the hospital operating room while Shelly is DOA.\n\nHe is resurrected by a crow and seeks vengeance on the murderers, methodically stalking and killing them. When not on the hunt, Eric stays in the house he shared with Shelly, spending most of his time there lost in memories of her. Her absence is torture for him; he is in emotional pain, even engaging in self-mutilation by cutting himself.\n\nThe crow acts as both guide and goad for Eric, giving him information that helps him in his quest but also chastising him for dwelling on Shelly's death, seeing his pining as useless self-indulgence that distracts him from his purpose.\n\n\n\"The Crow\" is ranked 37th in IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes. In 2005, creator James O'Barr claimed that \"The Crow\" was:\n\nIn 1994, a film based on the comic (titled \"The Crow\") was released to theaters by Miramax Films. The film was both a critical and commercial success, earning $50,693,129 total gross during its 1994 United States theatrical release. A cult following, in part due to the accidental death of its star Brandon Lee on the film's set, has maintained the film's popularity, with a regular staple of movie memorabilia being found at retailers like Hot Topic. Three sequels have been made so far: \"\" (1996), starring Vincent Pérez (as The Crow), Mia Kirshner, Richard Brooks and Iggy Pop; \"\" (2000), starring Eric Mabius (as The Crow), Kirsten Dunst and Fred Ward; and \"\" (2005), starring Edward Furlong (as The Crow), David Boreanaz and Tara Reid.\n\nIn the late 1990s, a sequel/reboot to \"The Crow\" entitled \"The Crow: 2037\" was in the works; it would be set in the future. It was written and scheduled to be directed by Rob Zombie, but it was ultimately cancelled.\n\nOn December 14, 2008, Stephen Norrington announced in \"Variety\" that he planned to write and direct a \"reinvention\" of \"The Crow\". Norrington distinguished between the original and his remake: \"Whereas Proyas’ original was gloriously Gothic and stylized, the new movie will be realistic, hard-edged and mysterious, almost documentary-style.\" In 2009 Ryan Kavanaugh's Relativity Media was negotiating with Edward R. Pressman for both the film's rights and financing. In May 2013, actor Luke Evans accepted the role of Eric Draven, with F. Javier Gutiérrez set to direct. According to James O'Barr the movie is expected to be much more faithful to the comic including flashbacks, metaphors, horses, trains and barbed wire, making it not suitable for younger audiences. Director Javier Gutiérrez also confirmed that his intentions are to create literally a page-by-page adaptation of the movie. Filming was slated to start in the spring of 2015 but on July 31, 2015, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" reported that production on the reboot stalled because of Relativity Media's bankruptcy.\n\nCorin Hardy was the next director to take on the film and O'Barr said in October 2017:\n\nOn May 31, 2018, it was announced that both director Hardy and star Jason Mamoa had exited the project.\n\nA television series, \"\" (1998), was based on the first movie with Mark Dacascos replacing Lee in the role of Eric Draven.\n\nFrom 1996–2001, a number of novels based on the world and thematic concerns of The Crow were published, mostly by Harper. Authors of these novels included such notable names as Chet Williamson, David Bischoff, Poppy Z. Brite, S. P. Somtow, Norman Partridge, and A. A. Attanasio.\n\nIn 1998, O'Barr and editor Ed Kramer asked an array of fiction writers, poets, and artists — including Gene Wolfe, Alan Dean Foster, Charles de Lint, Jack Dann, Jane Yolen, Henry Rollins and Iggy Pop — to interpret this Gothic fiction phenomenon. \"The Crow: Shattered Lives and Broken Dreams\" was released by Random House on Halloween; and a year later, in a limited signed and numbered volume, by Donald M. Grant Publishing.\n\n\"\" is a 1997 action video game for Sega Saturn, Sony PlayStation and Microsoft Windows. It is loosely based on the .

It is based on The Crow comics by James O'Barr and depicted images from the movie. It was released in November 1995 but initially had a release date of March 1995. It was one of three sets released by Heartbreaker Press and Target Games in November along with James Bond 007 and Kult. The game did not have starter decks and instead it had a core set with 122 cards that included 10 foils that had artwork from the comic. The game was sold in booster packs of 15 cards, but no starter packs were available. A promo card called \"The Confident Crow\" was available by mail through proof-of-purchase order. An expansion titled \"Crow: City of Angels\" was announced for an October 1996 release but never materialized.\n\nPlayers control Angel, Devil, and Neutral Bystander cards and then send them into combat with \"opposing [P]ersonalities\". Action cards allow players to pump or hinder a Personality. Each Personality has an attack and defense value, as well as Virtue, which is equal to the highest value. Players play their card Personality card and discard cards from their hands equal to the Virtue of the played card, and then they attack. If a player has a higher attack value than their opponent's defense value, the opponent is wounded. If a Personality would be wounded again, it is killed. A player wins by killing 25 Virtue worth of an opponent's Personalities.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The film is the directorial debut of Cedric Nicolas-Troyan, who was a visual effects supervisor and second unit director on the first film. It is written by Craig Mazin and Evan Spiliotopoulos, based on characters created by Evan Daugherty, which like the first film were inspired by the fairy tale \"Snow White\" compiled by the Brothers Grimm, as well as \"The Snow Queen\" by Hans Christian Andersen. Reprising their roles from the first film, the cast includes Chris Hemsworth, Charlize Theron, Nick Frost, and Sam Claflin. The film also introduced new characters played by Emily Blunt, Jessica Chastain, and Rob Brydon.\n\nThe film premiered in Hamburg on March 29, 2016, and was released in the United States on April 22, 2016. It received mixed to negative reviews from critics and audiences alike, with praise for the visuals and cast but many feeling the film was an unnecessary sequel. It grossed $165 million worldwide against an estimated $115 million production cost.\n\nEvil sorceress Queen Ravenna's powers allow her to know that her younger sister Freya, whose powers have not yet emerged, is not only involved in an illicit affair with an already elsewhere engaged nobleman Andrew, but is also pregnant with his child. Sometime after Freya gives birth to a baby girl, Freya discovers that Andrew not only reneged on his promise of elopement with her but also murdered their child. In a grief-fueled rage, her broken heart freezes over and she kills him with her sudden emergence of powers - the elemental control of ice.\n\nFreya abandons her sister's kingdom and builds herself a new kingdom up North. Ruling as the much feared Ice Queen, Freya orders children to be abducted so they can be trained to avoid the pain of love (as she suffered), and to be an army of fearsome huntsmen to conquer for her. Despite the training, two of her best huntsmen, Eric and Sara, grow up and fall in love, secretly bind, and plan to escape to a free life together. Freya discovers their secret and confronts them, creates a massive ice wall to separate them, then casts Eric out of her kingdom after first forcing him to watch as Sara is killed by one of their fellow huntsmen.\n\nSeven years later, and after Ravenna's death, Queen Snow White falls ill after hearing Ravenna's Magic Mirror beckoning her. Because of its overwhelming dark magic, she ordered it to be taken to Sanctuary, the magical place that sheltered Snow White during the events leading to her retaliation and ultimately Ravenna's death, so the mirror's magic can forever be contained. Snow White's husband, William, informs Eric that the soldiers tasked with carrying the Mirror went missing while en route to the Sanctuary. Eric realizes that he is being spied upon by Freya through sorcery (via a magical ice owl). Knowing the dark magic of the mirror can make Freya even stronger, perhaps invincible even, Eric agrees to investigate and attempt retrieve the mirror. Reluctantly though, he allows Snow White's dwarf ally Nion and his annoying half-brother Gryff to come along.\n\nWhile travelling to the last known location of the soldiers, they discover they seemingly attacked each other. At a tavern later, the trio are attacked by a group of Freya's huntsmen, but are rescued by a very much still alive Sara. Sara reveals that she was imprisoned by Freya the entire time, only to escape recently. They decipher that Eric was falsely made to see Sara's death, while she was made to see him abandoning her rather than fighting to help. Eric convinces her that Freya conjured these visions to trick them apart, and eventually has Sara join with him and the dwarves to thwart Freya. \n\nSoon, in a surprise attack, the quartet is ensnared in a trap set by she-dwarves Bromwyn and Doreena. They convince the she-dwarves to also help them find the Mirror, and the two lead them to the goblins that stole the mirror from Snow White's soldiers. The party fight off the goblins and retrieve the Mirror.\n\nAs the group nears the Sanctuary with the Mirror, they are ambushed by Freya and her huntsmen. Freya reveals Sara has been loyal to her all along, and that Sara was using her companions to find the Mirror for her. In the ensuing chaos, Nion and Doreena are turned into ice statues, and Sara shoots an arrow into Eric's chest on Freya's order, killing him. Freya departs with the Magic Mirror, but she is unaware that Sara intentionally missed so that Eric could live. Back in her palace, Freya recites the iconic verse associated with the Mirror, resurrecting Ravenna, who became one with the Mirror when Snow White vanquished her into it. Boasting a new suite of powers thanks to the Mirror's powerful magic, Ravenna usurps Freya's rule by coordinating Freya's huntsmen and army to reclaim the kingdoms Snow White had liberated.\n\nEric infiltrates the ice palace with help of Gryff and Bromwyn. He attempts to assassinate Freya, but is stopped by Ravenna. When Freya realizes that Sara didn't actually kill Eric, betrayed, she reluctantly sentences them both to death because of Ravenna's manipulation. However, Eric is able to convince a few huntsmen to rebel, claiming the love of life-long brethren. Ravenna begins to kill the huntsmen. Freya, realizing that she regards the huntsmen as her own surrogate \"children\", protects them with an ice wall, separating the huntsmen from the sisters. As Eric, Sara and the other huntsmen climb over the wall to fight Ravenna and retrieve the mirror, the two sisters argue over the icy kingdom. Ravenna lets slip that she's responsible for withdrawing her sister's weakness, awakening her powers. Freya, now suspicious, forces Ravenna (who as the mirror's captive spirit must answer her summoner's questions truthfully) to reveal that the mirror had told her that Freya's child would eventually be more beautiful than Ravenna, that she enchanted Andrew to kill the baby, ultimately causing the death of Freya's child so she could remain 'the fairest of them all'. Freya, outraged by her sister's evil deception and betrayal, finally turns against her. Freya is impaled by Ravenna, but with her remaining strength Freya freezes the Magic Mirror. Eric takes advantage and shatters the Mirror, thus destroying Ravenna. As Freya dies from her wounds, she smiles at the sight of a vision of her old loving self, and gladly witnesses Eric and Sara's devotion for each other.\n\nWith Freya's death, those who had been imprisoned by Freya's magic are set free, including Nion and Doreena, while a mysterious golden bird flies overhead. Eric, Sara and the huntsmen look forward to a new future while the dwarves pair off romantically and Eric and Sara share a kiss, finally happy to have a free life together for the first time in their lives.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, Snow White with a crown on her head is seen from behind. The aforementioned bird flies and lands on the balcony next to her. Snow White's own magical spy/scryer. (Though this scene seems to have been excised from consequent broadcast versions.)\n\n\nA sequel to \"Snow White and the Huntsman\" was initially planned with director Rupert Sanders in talks to return. The sequel plans were changed in August 2012 to a spin-off film concentrating on the Huntsman instead. Universal announced a few days later that they were not shelving the sequel. Another report stated that Universal authorised a sequel with Stewart set to reprise her role, but without Sanders to return as the director. A script was written and production was set to begin at some point in 2013, with the film to be released in 2015. On June 4, 2014, Deadline reported that Frank Darabont, Gavin O'Connor and Andrés Muschietti were on the shortlist to direct a sequel.

Two years later, Stewart said that she voluntarily turned down an offer from the studio to provide a cameo in the film. On January 16, 2015, it was announced that Darabont had exited the film after he parted with Universal. Hemsworth and Theron were set to return for the film, while Emily Blunt was being circled for a new role.

On March 18, 2015, it was revealed that Sheridan Smith, Rob Brydon, and Alexandra Roach were added to the cast to play dwarves alongside Frost's character Nion. \"TheWrap\" confirmed on May 7, 2015, that Sam Claflin would return as William in the sequel.\n\nPrincipal photography on the film began on April 6, 2015. Filming took place at Waverley Abbey in Surrey, England in April 2015. Filming also occurred from May to July 2015 in Windsor Great Park, England, at locations including South Forest, Johnson's Pond and in the Deer Park near Snow Hill. Filming was also done in Wells Bishop's Palace and Wells Cathedral. In July 2015, filming also took place at Puzzlewood, in the Forest of Dean.\n\nOn October 8, 2015, it was officially announced, that James Newton Howard would return to score the film, after creating the music for \"Snow White and the Huntsman\". The score album was released on April 22, 2016. Singer Halsey promoted the film by releasing an alternate version of her song \"Castle\", along with a subsequent music video, made for the film.\n\nOn July 31, 2014, Universal Pictures announced the film's release date would be April 22, 2016. In February 2016, it was announced that the film would be released in 3D in international markets like Germany. In Poland, the theatrical release was scheduled for April 8, 2016, which was the date for many other international markets.\n\nOn November 16, 2015, Universal Pictures unveiled four character posters for the film, along with the film's new title, \"The Huntsman: Winter's War\". Three days later, on November 18, 2015, the first official trailer of the film was released, along with two additional teaser posters. A second trailer debuted on February 11, 2016. Universal released a final trailer on March 22, 2016. Hemsworth, Theron, and Chastain introduced a performance by Halsey of \"Castle\" at the 2016 MTV Movie Awards.\n\n\"The Huntsman: Winter's War\" was released on Digital HD on August 2, 2016, and was followed by a release on Blu-ray and DVD on August 23, 2016. The film debuted at No. 1 on the home video sales chart. A Blu-ray extended edition (with DVD & digital HD) was also released with a run time of 120 minutes.\n\n\"The Huntsman: Winter's War\" grossed $48.4 million in North America and $116.6 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $165 million, against a production budget of $115 million.\nIn the United States and Canada, early tracking suggested the film would open to $24–30 million, which was significantly lower than its predecessor's $56.2 million opening in 2012. The film opened in 3,791 theaters and grossed $7.3 million on its first day, including $1 million from its early Thursday night previews. In its opening weekend, it grossed a lower-than-expected $19.4 million, which was about 64% less than the original film's opening. Due to its underperforming opening weekend, the film lost Universal $30–40 million, with some estimates having the total losses at up to $70 million. \"The Hollywood Reporter\" estimated the film lost the studio at least $75 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues.\n\nInternationally, \"The Huntsman: Winter's War\" was released in a total of 65 countries. There were some estimates that the film will end its run at about $150 million internationally, which is lower than its predecessor's total of $240 million. One notable difference is that while \"Winter's War\" has secured a release date in China, \"Snow White and the Huntsman\" did not play there, and analysts believe that could make \"some difference\". It was released in 18 countries two weeks ahead of its U.S. debut, earning $19.1 million from 3,969 screens, and had No. 1 openings in eleven of them, and second overall at the international box office charts, behind the superhero film \"\". In its second weekend, it added 7 new markets and grossed a total of $17.8 million, falling only by 8% from its previews weekend, and still remained at No. 2, behind \"The Jungle Book\". It was still No. 2 in its third weekend. Its top openings occurred in China ($10.4 million), the United Kingdom and Ireland ($4.2 million), Brazil ($3.1 million), Mexico ($2.8 million), France ($2.6 million), Korea ($2.1 million), Russia ($2 million), the Philippines ($1.6 million), Malaysia ($1.6 million), Spain ($1.4 million), and Thailand ($1.2 million). In China, it was in third place, behind local pic \"Yesterday Once More\" and the continued run of \"The Jungle Book\". It lost a tremendous number of screens in its second weekend due to the arrival of three new local pics – \"Book of Love\", \"Phantom of the Theater\" and \"MBA Partners\" – along with the continued run of \"The Jungle Book\" and as a result it grossed just $710,000.\n\nIn terms of total earnings, its largest markets outside of North America are China ($15.6 million), the UK ($7.3 million) and Mexico ($7.2 million).\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes the film has a rating of 17%, based on 199 reviews, with an average rating of 4.2/10. The site's consensus reads, \"\"The Huntsman: Winter's War\" is visually arresting and boasts a stellar cast, but neither are enough to recommend this entirely unnecessary sequel.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 35 out of 100, based on 41 critics, indicating \"generally unfavourable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\n"}

{"id": "49733962", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49733962", "title": "Women in rock", "text": "Women in rock\n\nWomen in rock describes the role of women singers, instrumentalists, record producers and other music professionals in rock music and popular music and the many subgenres and hybrid genres that have emerged from these genres. Women have a high prominence in many popular music styles as singers. However, professional women instrumentalists are uncommon in popular music, especially in rock genres such as heavy metal. \"[P]laying in a band is largely a male homosocial activity, that is, learning to play in a band is largely a peer-based... experience, shaped by existing sex-segregated friendship networks. As well, rock music \"...is often defined as a form of male rebellion vis-à-vis female bedroom culture.\"\n\nIn popular music, there has been a gendered \"distinction between public (male) and private (female) participation\" in music. \"[S]everal scholars have argued that men exclude women from bands or from the bands' rehearsals, recordings, performances, and other social activities.\" \"Women are mainly regarded as passive and private consumers of allegedly slick, prefabricated – hence, inferior – pop music..., excluding them from participating as high status rock musicians.\" One of the reasons that there are rarely mixed gender bands is that \"bands operate as tight-knit units in which homosocial solidarity – social bonds between people of the same sex... – plays a crucial role.\" In the 1960s pop music scene, \"[s]inging was sometimes an acceptable pastime for a girl, but playing an instrument...simply wasn't done.\"\n\n\"The rebellion of rock music was largely a male rebellion; the women—often, in the 1950s and '60s, girls in their teens—in rock usually sang songs as personæ utterly dependent on their macho boyfriends...\". Philip Auslander says that \"Although there were many women in rock by the late 1960s, most performed only as singers, a traditionally feminine position in popular music\". Though some women played instruments in American all-female garage rock bands, none of these bands achieved more than regional success. So they \"did not provide viable templates for women's on-going participation in rock\". In relation to the gender composition of heavy metal bands, it has been said that \"[h]eavy metal performers are almost exclusively male\" \"...[a]t least until the mid-1980s\" apart from \"...exceptions such as Girlschool.\" However, \"...now [in the 2010s] maybe more than ever–strong metal women have put up their dukes and got down to it\", \"carv[ing] out a considerable place for [them]selves.\"\nWhen Suzi Quatro emerged in 1973, \"no other prominent female musician worked in rock simultaneously as a singer, instrumentalist, songwriter, and bandleader\". According to Auslander, she was \"kicking down the male door in rock and roll and proving that a female \"musician\" ... and this is a point I am extremely concerned about ... could play as well if not better than the boys\".\n\nA number of these artists are also notable for singing and songwriting, but they are listed here for their instrumental skills:\n\nAn all-female band is a musical group in popular music genres such as rock, blues, jazz and related genres which is exclusively composed of female musicians. This is distinct from a girl group, in which the female members are solely vocalists, though this terminology is not universally followed. While all-male bands are common in many rock and pop bands, all-female bands are less common.\n\nA girl group is a music act featuring several female singers who generally harmonize their vocals together. The term \"girl group\" is also used in a narrower sense within English-speaking countries to denote the wave of American female pop music singing groups which flourished in the late 1950s and early 1960s between the decline of early rock and roll and the British Invasion, many of whom were influenced by doo-wop style. All-female bands are sometimes also called girl groups.\n\nIn the Jazz Age and during the 1930s, all-female bands such as The Blue Belles, the Parisian Redheads (later the Bricktops), Lil-Hardin's All-Girl Band, The Ingenues, The Harlem Playgirls, Phil Spitalny's Musical Sweethearts and \"Helen Lewis and Her All-Girl Jazz Syncopators\" were popular. Ina Ray Hutton led an all-girl band, the Melodears, from 1934 to 1939. Eunice Westmoreland, under the name Rita Rio, led an all-female band appearing on NBC Radio and for Vitaphone and RKO. Ivy Benson's \"All Girls Band\" was the BBC's resident dance band in 1943 and toured until the 1980s. A Polish group Filipinki was established in 1959.\n\nGroups composed solely of women began to emerge with the advent of rock and roll. Among the earliest all-female rock bands to be signed to a record label were Goldie & the Gingerbreads, to Atlantic Records in 1964, The Pleasure Seekers with Suzi Quatro to Hideout Records in 1964 and Mercury Records in 1968, The Feminine Complex to Athena Records in 1968, and Fanny (who pioneered the all-female band sound in the early to mid-1970s) in 1969 when Mo Ostin signed them to Warner Bros. Records. There were also others, such as The Liverbirds (1962–1967), the Ace of Cups (1967), The Heart Beats (1968), and Ariel (1968–1970).\n\nIn 1971 Fanny became the first all-female band to reach the Hot 100's top 40, with \"Charity Ball\" peaking at No. 40. In 1975, the Canadian duo of sisters, Kate and Anna McGarrigle, recorded the first of a string of albums. The Runaways were an early commercially successful, hard-edged, all-female hard rock band, releasing their first album in 1976: band members Joan Jett, Cherie Currie and Lita Ford all went on to solo careers. The 1980s, for the first time, saw long-sought chart success from all-female bands and female-fronted rock bands. On the Billboard Hot 100-year-end chart for 1982 Joan Jett's \"I Love Rock 'n' Roll\" at No. 3 and the Go-Go's \"We Got the Beat\" at No. 25 sent a message out to many industry heads that females who could play could bring in money.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the advent of punk in the late 1970s with its \"anyone can do it\" ethos led to women making significant contributions. In contrast to the rock music and heavy metal scenes of the 1970s, which were dominated by men, the anarchic, counter-cultural mindset of the punk scene in mid- and late 1970s encouraged women to participate. \"That was the beauty of the punk thing,\" Chrissie Hynde later said.\" [Sexual] discrimination didn't exist in that scene.\" This participation played a role in the historical development of punk music, especially in the U.S. and U.K. at that time, and continues to influence and enable future generations.\n\nRock historian Helen Reddington states that the popular image of young punk women musicians as focused on the fashion aspects of the scene (fishnet stockings, spiky blond hair, etc.) was stereotypical. She states that many, if not most women punks were more interested in the ideology and socio-political implications, rather than the fashion. Music historian Caroline Coon contends that before punk, women in rock music were virtually invisible; in contrast, in punk, she argues \"[i]t would be possible to write the whole history of punk music without mentioning any male bands at all -- and I think a lot of [people] would find that very surprising.\" Johnny Rotten wrote that ‘During the Pistols era, women were out there playing with the men, taking us on in equal terms ... It wasn’t combative, but compatible.’ Women were involved in bands such as The Slits, The Raincoats, Mo-dettes, and Dolly Mixture, The Innocents.\n\nOthers take issue with the notion of equal recognition, such as guitarist Viv Albertine, who stated that \"the A&R men, the bouncers, the sound mixers, no one took us seriously.. So, no, we got no respect anywhere we went. People just didn't want us around.\" The anti-establishment stance of punk opened the space for women who were treated like outsiders in a male-dominated industry. Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon states, \"I think women are natural anarchists, because you're always operating in a male framework.\"\n\nThe all-female heavy metal band Girlschool, from South London, formed in 1978 out of the ashes of Painted Lady. While somewhat successful in the UK, they became better known in the early 1980s. One of the original members of the band, Kathy Valentine departed to join the all-female band The Go-Gos', switching from guitar to bass. Among Girlschool's early recordings was an EP titled \"The St. Valentines Day Massacre\" which they recorded with Bronze label-mates Motörhead under the name Headgirl. In 1974, The Deadly Nightshade, a rock/country band, was signed by Phantom.\n\nIn the 1990s, musician's magazines were starting to view female musicians more seriously, putting Bonnie Raitt and Tina Weymouth on their covers. While The Go-Go's and The Bangles, both from the LA club scene, were the first all-female rock bands to find sustained success, individual musicians paved the way for the industry to seek out bands that had female musicians.\n\nIn the 1990s, bands such as Hole, Babes in Toyland, Super Heroines, The Lovedolls and L7 became popular, while demonstrating on stage, and in interviews, a self-confident and \"bad\" attitude at times, always willing to challenge assumptions about how an all-female band should behave. Courtney Love described the other females in Hole as using a more \"lunar viewpoint\" in their roles as musicians. In the 1990s, the punk, female-led Riot Grrrl genre was associated with bands such as Bratmobile and Bikini Kill.\n"}
