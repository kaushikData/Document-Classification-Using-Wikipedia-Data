It was made by Bohemia Interactive, the developer of the original game and Black Element Software. It contains new units, weapons, islands and campaigns.\n\nThe first campaign \"Rahmadi Conflict\" is a follow-up to the original storyline. Player takes role of Leon Ortega who leads a U.S. Army Special Forces team. He is sent to nearby island of Rahmadi where the remaining of Sahrani Liberation Army is located and led by a mysterious leader, called \"the President\". The campaign consists of three missions and takes place on Rahmadi and a new island Porto.\n\nThe other campaign, \"Royal Flush\", takes place on Sahrani a few years after the original storyline. The island is united, but the people from the northern part of the island together with the refugees from the south are dissatisfied with the monarchy which evolved into an oppressive regime. A group of mercenaries from Black Element private military company is hired by Sahrani queen Isabella who has taken the throne after a sudden death of her father, King Jose and her brother, Prince Orlando in a helicopter crash, causing a full scale-insurgency on the north. They are supposed to fight anti-government insurgents on North and to seize a stockpile of chemical weapons believed to be in possession of the rebels. Player takes role of Kurt Lambowski who is a member of the group. Before arriving to Sahrani, Lambowski believes there is something fishy about the Queen who is unable to quell the insurgency despite having well-trained armed forces at hand. This proves true during the campaign as the team discovers that the Queen is a ruthless leader who runs a police state and puts the opponents to the concentration camps. Which is more - Prince Orlando is alive and leads the rebels. With these facts at hand, the team decides to help the rebels.\n\nDepending on the player's decisions the Queen is either overthrown (killed or escapes) or she manages to get Prince Orlando killed, forcing the contractors to hastily leave the island and they are later branded as the rogue contractors.\nThe allegations about the involvement of Black Element company in a coup d'état is one of the reasons for a later rebranding of the company name to ION Services.\n\n\nThe critical reception was mixed. It currently holds 67% on Metacritic.\n\n"}

It was announced in the February 2008 issue of \"Play\" magazine and released on January 27, 2009. The game was developed by Namco Bandai Games and in North America, it was the first (and would end up being the only) game published under their western label, Surge. In Europe and Australia the game was released under the Namco brand instead and was distributed by Atari Europe.\n\n\"Afro Samurai\" is a 3D brawler with platforming elements. Using light hits, power hits, kicks, and blocks the player fights various enemies. Most levels culminate in a boss fight, and in-engine cutscenes advance the story.\n\nThe game features a cel-shaded animation style. Though it is a hack and slash game, the \"fighting is a bit more strategic\" and the player is able to block and use combos. The enemies will respond by rolling, ducking and hopping over the player's blade and occasionally using body orifices to catch the weapons, the combat system was worked on by Monty Oum.\n\nIt is said that the one who becomes \"Number One\" will rule the world, wielding powers akin to a god. Someone becomes Number One by killing the previous Number One and taking his ceremonial headband. However, only the \"Number Two\" is allowed to challenge the Number One. Because of this, few people ever reach the Number One because the Number Two headband is constantly changing owners. Afro's father was the old Number One, until he was brutally killed by a gunman named Justice, an event witnessed by Afro as a child. Now an adult, Afro Samurai is the current Number Two and a master swordsman; he travels the road seeking revenge on Justice. Lengthy flashbacks interspersed throughout the story detail how Afro rose from frightened boy fleeing the death of his father, to master swordsman, and eventually to become the current \"Number Two\", while the story in the present deals with the adult Afro making his way to the mountain top keep of the \"Number One\" to duel Justice, while at the same time the mysterious cult known as the Empty Seven Clan sends various agents to kill Afro and take his Number Two headband. Ultimately, Afro discovers that Justice is already long dead, rendering his quest meaningless. After defeating a hallucination of Justice in single combat, Afro realizes that the headbands only bring pain and death and throws them into an abyss.\n\nAll of the main characters are voiced by the same actors as in the anime. Mary Elizabeth McGlynn served as the voice director for the game.\n\nHip hop producer RZA is credited as music director, but due to time constraints, he was unable to contribute fully. Instead he told the team how he went about scoring \"Afro Samurai\", and put them in contact with various individuals to assist them in delivering a sound similar to what he created for the anime. He did, however, send the team a couple of tracks to use in the game.\n\nThe game's credits reveal that Namco Bandai commissioned a TV screenwriter, Peter Saji, to produce a storyline for a downloadable episode. In an interview, Saji admitted that multiple downloadable episodes are in production, but could not provide a release date.\n\nThe game was given moderate reviews, resulting in the Metacritic score of 65. Namco Bandai posted on its fiscal year report that the game sold 420,000 copies across all platforms in the US and Europe.\n\nAn episodic sequel was announced in June 2015, called \"\". Volume 1 was released on PlayStation 4, and PC on September 22, 2015 and the Xbox One on October 8, 2015. In November 2015, the game was removed from the PlayStation Store, Xbox Marketplace and Steam and volumes 2 and 3 were cancelled due to poor reception.\n\n"}

{"id": "45263877", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45263877", "title": "Anubhava", "text": "Anubhava\n\nIn Hindu thought, Anubhava or \"anubhavah\" (Sanskrit: अनुभव) refers to personal knowledge or aesthetic experience.\n\nThe term \"anubhava\" or \"anubhavah\" (Sanskrit) is a compound of: \n\n\"Anubhava\" has a wide range of possible translations: \n\nSeveral related words express the mental state which can be communicated to others or represented (अभिनय – 'acting'), either verbally or physically or emotionally, in one or different contexts:\n\n\"Anubhāvas\" are not causes, but aesthetic experiences and important ingredients of Rasa. \"Anubhavah\" is not a sense-experience.\n\n\"Anubhavah\" refers to poetic, narrative or ritual experience, enjoyment, relish or delight resulting, for the devotee or the seeker after truth, in the ecstatic experience of the divine; it is a means to understand during one’s own life-time the true nature of one’s own self which is the real nature of the Atman by experiencing the sublime delight of the unity with the Supreme Self .\n\nCognition is said to be of two kinds – \"smrti\" ('reproductive') which is other than re-cognitive perception requiring disposition, and \"anubhavah\" ('productive') which involves a kind of awareness not derived from disposition alone. The difference between the waking state and the dreaming state becomes known through \"anubhava\" ('perception').\n\nThe sage of the Mundaka Upanishad declares:\nThis is so because Brahman is of the nature of experience (\"anubhuti\") and to have the \"anubhava\" of Brahman is to become Brahman, thus this revelation, a moment ago non-existing, is realized as existing eternally. \"Vijñānam\" is \"anubhava\", and \"anubhava\" is realization of the identity of the individual self and Brahman, which experience does not depend on any process, neither produced by any process nor as an effect to any cause and is the highest state of development.\n\nWith regard to the origination of things, Badarayana declares:\nShankara holds \"anubhava\" to be a \"pramana\", an independent source of knowledge which is provided by contemplation (\"nididhyasana\"). In his commentary on this \"sutra\" Shankara explains that a thing cannot be simultaneously judged to be existent and non-existent for the valid knowledge of the true nature of a thing does not depend on human notions and यतः (\" yatah\" ) ('that from which') in this \"sutra\" \"is not meant to present an inference but speaks of a cause that is by nature eternal, pure, free and intrinsically omniscient\" (which has to be experienced and felt). The realization of the Supreme Word (\"śabda\"), which is truth and reality, happens intuitively (a stage of \"pratibha\"), and resembles Shankara’s concept of \"anubhava\".\n\nPadmapada (fl. 8th century), a student of Shankara, in his \"Panchapādikā\", expounding Prabhākara’s view, explains that knowledge is \"anubhava\" i.e. the immediate experience, the resultant-cognition gained through valid means of knowledge when the subject and the object manifest and the self of the knower is known indirectly as \"I\". And, according to Abhinavagupta, the very continuous and proper remembrance of the mantra (of a ritual) is the attainment of the condition in which the devout \"upāsaka\" as a routine has the continuous and direct \"anubhava\" ('experience') of the Self as no different from himself.\n\nSwami Dayananda notes that \"anubhava\" has a more specific meaning than its conventional meaning of \"experience\", namely \"direct knowledge\". Dayananda explains that interpreting \"anubahva\" as \"experience\" may lead to a misunderstanding of Advaita Vedanta, and a mistaken rejection of the study of the scriptures as mere intellectual understanding. Stressing the meaning of \"anubhava\" as knowledge, Saraswati argues that liberation comes from knowledge, not from mere experience. Saraswati points out that \"the experience of the self ... can never come because consciousness is ever-present, in and through each and every experience.\"\n\nAccording to Vivekananda, \"anubhavah\" is the ground and source of all religious traditions, the infallible source of liberating knowledge, and the ultimate source of spiritual knowledge; however, he happens to distinguish between internal and external experience, between knowledge gained through words heard and own experience which he finds are not similar in nature and import. According to Reza Shah-Kazemi \"anubhava\" is the immediate experience through which the transcendence of the Supreme Self beyond all limitations becomes known as one’s own self, then one realizes the real nature of one’s own self.\n\nThayumanavar, the 18th-century Tamil Saiva Siddhanta saint, the one who gains \"anubhava\" delights in the unitive experience (\"advaita anubhava\") which is deep and intuitive, and the culmination of all experimental states of Vedanta; it is the \"svarupa-lakshana\".\n\nIn the waking state and in the dreaming state, \"samvedana\" (संवेदन) ('perception', 'act of perceiving or feeling', 'cognitive awareness') is two-folds – i) 'knowledge' and its ii) 'object'; in deep sleep state and \"turiya\" state, which states are not different from knowledge, \"anubhava\" ('experiencing awareness') is consciousness alone; the enlightened soul does not ever lose this experiencing awareness which event (\"anubhava\") occurs no sooner the object is perceived and its existence is registered.\n\nIn poetry, prose and drama, emotions are indirectly communicated to the readers and audience via portrayal of certain aspects of emotion’s conditions and causes (\"vibhāva\" consisting of \"alambana\" and \"uddipana\"), exterior manifestations or consequences (\"anubhāva\" which is \"vācika\", \"āngika\" or \"sāttvika\") and concomitant accompanying emotions (\"sancāribhāva\") which method is called \"rasa\" ('relish') or \"dhvani\" and involves diction (\"riti\"), rhetoric (\"alankāra\") and oblique expression (\"vakrokti\"), and is the finished product of sentiment (\"sthāyibhāva\"). \"Bhāva\" is emotion.\n\nMystic poetry is known as \"Anubhāvakāvya\". Bendre, who started the cultural movement \"nada-habba\", considers mystic experience as an extension of \"anubhava\", and \"anubhava\" leads to \"anubhāva\" – \"Bhāva\" -> \"Anubhava\" -> \"Bhāva\" -> \"Anubhāva\". In his poem, \"Sanna Somavara\" as a poetic composition is seen the transformation of \"bhāva\" into \"anubhava\" and back to \"bhāva\".\n\nThere are eight different and distinct \"rasa\" or 'sentiments' – 'erotic', 'comic', 'pathetic', 'furious', 'heroic', 'terrible', 'odious', and 'marvellous', to which \"rasa\" is also added \"śānta rasa\". Bharata states that \"rasa\" is the soul of poetry. The \"vedic\" meaning of \"rasa\" is 'liquid' or 'flavour'; for Shankara, \"rasa\" signifies the intrinsic and spiritual non-material bliss. Natya Shastra (St.109) explains that \"rasa\" is produced from a combination of determinants (\"vibhāva\"), consequents or histrionic representations (\"anubhāva\") and any of the thirty-three transitory states (\"vyabhicāribhāva\"), according to which text, 'love', 'mirth', 'sorrow', 'anger', 'energy', 'terror', 'disgust' and 'astonishment' are the eight dominant states or \"sthāyibhāva\"; 'paralysis', 'perspiration', 'horripilation', 'change of voice', 'trembling', 'change of colour', 'weeping' and 'fainting' are the eight temperamental states or \"sattvikabhāva\", and emphasizes on histrionic representation or \"abhinaya\" of the \"anubhāva\" presented by the characters developed by the playwright. Abhinavagupta states that \"śānta rasa\", also a \"sthāyibhāva\", leads to \"moksha\", for it is the very experience of pure consciousness; \"vibhāva\" also means 'pure consciousness' and \"anubhāva\" also means the experience arising from pure consciousness. \"Rasa\" is an experience of pure consciousness brought about by the aesthetic contents, impressions and stimuli for the mind, the intellect and the emotions; \"vibhāva\" causes a specific emotional state to cause an \"anubhāva\" (effect) which is defined as means of histrionic representation. The experience of \"rasa\" is the experience of the different levels of perception corresponding to the different transitory mental states, the \"sāttvika-bhāvas\", for example, are involuntary and uncontrollable physical responses produced from certain mental states. Bhatta Lolatta states that \"rasa\" is intensified \"sthāyibhāva\" located in the character (\"anukārya\") and the actor (\"anukartā\") by virtue of the power of identification.\n"}

Eleven years later, in 1987, the plaintiff sought registration for the work with the US Copyright Office. On February 13, 1987 and again on May 22, 1987, Copyright Registrar Ralph Oman refused to register the work because it \"did not contain at least a minimum amount of original pictorial or graphic authorship, or authorship in sounds\". Atari challenged Oman's use of discretion not to award the game copyright protection.\n\nJustice John H. Pratt of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, deferred to the Registrar and granted summary judgment for the defendant. He noted that \"It is simply not the case, in short, that video games are \"per se\" copyrightable, or by definition more expressive and creative than other mediums.\"\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, sitting on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, reversed the decision of the trial court and held that \"Breakout\" was a copyrightable work.\n\nIn order for a work to be copyrightable, it must be fixed.

Because breakout consists of a series of shapes and images in a particular sequence alongside audio, the court found it met the requisite level of copyright.\n\nThis case stands as a precedent that a video game can attract the protection of copyright.

{"id": "524986", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=524986", "title": "Batman: The Killing Joke", "text": "Batman: The Killing Joke\n\nBatman: The Killing Joke is a 1988 DC Comics one-shot graphic novel featuring the characters Batman and the Joker written by Alan Moore and illustrated by Brian Bolland. \"The Killing Joke\" provides an origin story for the supervillain the Joker, loosely adapted from the 1951 story arc \"The Man Behind the Red Hood!\". The Joker's origin is presented via flashback, while simultaneously depicting his attempt to drive Jim Gordon insane and Batman's desperate attempt to stop him.\n\nCreated by Moore and Bolland as their own take on the Joker's source and psychology, the story became famous for its origin of the Joker as a tragic character; a family man and failed comedian who suffered \"one bad day\" that finally drove him insane. Moore stated that he attempted to show the similarities and contrasts between the two characters. The story's effects on the mainstream Batman continuity also included the shooting and paralysis of Barbara Gordon (a.k.a. Batgirl), an event that laid the groundwork for her to develop the identity of Oracle.\n\nMany critics consider the graphic novel to be the definitive Joker story and one of the best Batman stories ever published. The comic won the Eisner Award for 'Best Graphic Album' in 1989 and appeared on \"The New York Times\" Best Seller List in May 2009. In 2006, \"The Killing Joke\" was reprinted as part of the trade paperback \"\". In 2008, DC Comics reprinted the story in a deluxe hardcover edition, which features new coloring by Bolland, with a more somber, realistic, and subdued palette than the original. Elements of \"The Killing Joke\" have inspired or been incorporated into other aspects of Batman media.\n\nArtist Brian Bolland's version of the Joker stemmed in part from his having recently seen the film \"The Man Who Laughs\". Giordano's invitation led directly to Bolland working with writer Alan Moore to create a plausible background story for the Joker. He recounted, \"I thought about it in terms of who's my favorite writer at the moment, what hero I would really love to do, and which villain? I basically came up with Alan, Batman and the Joker\".\n\nAlthough the story takes pains to stress that it is merely one possible \"origin story\", it has been widely accepted and adopted into DC continuity, and a central mutilation of a long-running character had to be specially approved by editor Wein. Bolland said that he saw \"Judge Death [as] almost a dry run for drawing the Joker\". He also recounted that \"by the time Alan had finished \"Watchmen\" he had fallen out with DC to a certain extent ... in the end, he only continued to do \"Killing Joke\" as a favor to me\".\n\nThe 48-page prestige format one-shot comic took a considerable amount of time to produce. Both Moore and Bolland are well known for their meticulous and time-consuming work; both creators' then-recently finished 12-issue maxiseries titles – Moore's \"Watchmen\" and Bolland's \"Camelot 3000\" – had seen delays. He was aided by the laidback attitude taken by DC, who he says \"seemed prepared to let me do it at my own pace\". The original editor, Len Wein, left the company, and was replaced by Dennis O'Neil, a \"very hands-off sort of guy\", with whom Bolland only recalls having one conversation about the book.\n\nBolland envisaged the flashback sequences in black and white, and instructed \"Watchmen\" colorist John Higgins to use \"muted November colors\". He was upset when he saw the finished comic had \"garish ... hideous glowing purples and pinks ... and my precious \"Eraserhead\"-esque flashback sequences swamped in orange\". The 2008-published 20th anniversary edition of the book featured new colouring by Bolland, restoring his artistic intentions to the palette.\n\nThe story is referred to in a flashback scene in the DC Universe Animated Original Movies, \"\". In the movie, Red Hood lures Batman to the chemical factory where the Joker's accident took place. Batman remembers the events like in the comic, where a fleeing Joker had attempted to escape while trying to claim that he was set up but accidentally fell into the toxic waste and disfigured him. Red Hood calls it Batman's greatest failure. Jason Todd also refers to Joker crippling Barbara.\n\nThe man who will become the Joker is an unnamed engineer who quits his job at a chemical company to become a stand-up comedian, only to fail miserably. Desperate to support his pregnant wife Jeannie, he agrees to guide two criminals through the chemical plant where he previously worked so that they can rob the playing card company next to it. During the planning, the police inform him that his wife has died in a household accident. Grief-stricken, the engineer tries to withdraw from the plan, but the criminals strong-arm him into keeping his commitment to them.\n\nAt the plant, the criminals make him don a special mask to become the infamous Red Hood. As previously told to the engineer by the criminals, they use this disguise to implicate any accomplice as the mastermind and to divert attention away from themselves. Once inside, they encounter security personnel, a shootout ensues, and the two criminals are killed. The engineer is confronted by Batman who is investigating the disturbance.\n\nTerrified, the engineer jumps into the chemical plant's waste pound lock to escape Batman and is swept through a pipe leading to the outside. Once outside, he discovers to his horror that the chemicals have permanently bleached his skin chalk-white, stained his lips ruby-red and dyed his hair bright green. The engineer's disfigurement, compounded with the loss of his family, drives him completely insane and marks the birth of the Joker.\nIn the present day, Batman goes to Arkham Asylum to talk with the Joker about ending their years-long feud, only to realize that the Joker has escaped and put a decoy in his place. Soon after, the Joker shoots Barbara Gordon in the stomach, paralyzing her, and kidnaps her father, Commissioner James Gordon. The Joker imprisons Gordon in a run-down amusement park. His henchmen then beat Gordon and cage him in the park's freak show. It is implied but not explicitly said that the Joker gives Gordon LSD to continue his mental torture. The Joker chains Gordon to one of the park's rides and forces him to view giant photos of Barbara, lying down naked, bloodied, and in pain. Once Gordon has run the horrifying gauntlet, the Joker puts him on display in the freak show, ridiculing him as \"the average man\", a naïve weakling doomed to insanity.\n\nBatman's attempts to locate Commissioner Gordon are unsuccessful until the Joker sends him an \"invitation\" that leads him to the amusement park. Batman arrives to save Gordon, and the Joker retreats into the funhouse. Though traumatized by the ordeal, Gordon retains his sanity and moral code, and he insists that Batman capture the Joker \"by the book\" in order to \"show him that our way works\". Batman enters the funhouse and dodges the Joker's booby traps, while the Joker tries to persuade his nemesis that the world is \"a black, awful joke\" that is not worth fighting for, and that it only takes \"one bad day\" to drive an ordinary man insane.\n\nBatman subdues the Joker and tells him that Gordon survived the Joker's torments, and suggests that the Joker is alone in his madness. He attempts to reach out to the Joker and offers to help him recover in order to end their everlasting war, which Batman fears may one day result in a fight to the death. The Joker declines, saying it is \"too late for that. Far too late\". He then says that this situation reminds him of a joke about two inmates in a lunatic asylum who try to escape. One inmate jumps across a narrow gap between the asylum and the adjoining building, but the other is afraid he will fall. The first inmate offers to shine his flashlight across the gap so the other can walk across it, but the second inmate replies, \"What do you think I am, crazy? You'd turn it off when I was halfway across!\" Batman chuckles at the punchline, and the two old foes laugh as the police arrive.\n\nFrom the text itself, the ending is ambiguous: according to one view, Batman breaks the Joker's neck out of panel, causing the laughter to stop abruptly. Some people theorise that the title, \"The Killing Joke\", is in reference to the ending scene, in which The Joker and Batman laugh, over a joke, thus triggering Batman to kill the Joker. According to another view, Batman and the Joker, who have been fighting for years, end all of their disputes by having a good laugh about it all. Still another theory maintains that the first and last panels of the book are both purposely of rain falling on the ground, which symbolizes that nothing has changed except for the two parties' respect for each other.\n\nThough many people, fans and critics alike, have debated each of these theories, the ending was purposely left uncertain to allow each individual reader to decide what happened.\n\nThe book explores Moore's assertion that, psychologically, \"Batman and the Joker are mirror images of each other\" by delving into the relationship between the two. The story itself shows how the Joker and Batman came to terms with their respective life-altering tragedies, which both eventually lead to their present lives and confrontation. Critic Geoff Klock further explained that \"both Batman and the Joker are creations of a random and tragic 'one bad day'. Batman spends his life forging meaning from the random tragedy, whereas the Joker reflects the absurdity of life, and all its random injustice\".\n\nThe torments that the Joker puts Commissioner Gordon through are meant to serve as \"proof that there is something buried deep within each lunatic, a nugget of insanity, that is simply waiting for the right moment to spring forth\". Unlike the Joker, however, Gordon emerges from his ordeal with his sanity and moral code intact. The story is also famous for changing how the Modern Age of Comics perceived Batman comics by bringing it back to its darker roots. The comic book, however, delves deeper in order to present Batman's own psychology—that he is, in his own way, just as insane as the Joker, and that he and the Joker perceive the world according to differing points of view, with the Joker's interpreted through a joke.\n\nThe Joker serves as an unreliable narrator. He admits to his own uncertainty, as he has disparate memories of the single event (\"Sometimes I remember it one way, sometimes another ... If I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice!\"), accentuating the comic's depiction of \"a world unraveling toward relentless urban violence and moral nihilism ...\"\n\nAlthough a one-shot, the events of \"The Killing Joke\" were adopted into ongoing comic book storylines. DC Comics officially retired Batgirl in the one-shot comic \"Batgirl Special\" #1 (July 1988), and when Barbara Gordon reappeared in the \"Birds of Prey\" series, she was in a wheelchair and became the computer hacker Oracle (this series was later adapted into a TV series of the same title). This event, along with a Batman storyline that takes place shortly afterward, \"\", involving the Joker murdering Robin (Jason Todd), \"The Killing Joke\", leads Batman's obsession with the Clown Prince of Crime to a personal level. The mantle of Batgirl would eventually be passed to successor Cassandra Cain and later, Stephanie Brown. Gordon's paralysis was later retconned into a temporary event that lasted only three years in DC Comics' 2011 line-wide title relaunch, The New 52, which saw her restored as the first and only Batgirl.\n\nThe graphic novel won the Eisner Award for Best Graphic Album and garnered Alan Moore the Best Writer award in 1989. Hilary Goldstein of IGN Comics praised \"The Killing Joke\", calling it \"easily the greatest Joker story ever told\" and adding that \"Moore's rhythmic dialogue and Bolland's organic art create a unique story often mimicked but never matched\". IGN declared \"The Killing Joke\" the third-greatest Batman graphic novel, after \"The Dark Knight Returns\" and \".\" James Donnelly of \"Pop Syndicate\" called \"The Killing Joke\" \"one of the greatest comics of the 20th century, period\". Van Jensen of \"ComicMix\" said, \"Each time [I read \"The Killing Joke\"] I'm amazed all over again at how Alan Moore and Brian Bolland teamed to pack such intensity, ferocity and humanity into those pages. B.L. Wooldridge of Batman in Comics called the graphic novel \"an incredible story, with Moore at his best and awe-inspiring art by painter Brian Bolland\". Comics historians Robert Greenberger and Matthew K. Manning describe it as \"the definitive Joker story of all time\". Manning additionally called it \"one of the most powerful and disturbing stories in the history of Gotham City\".\n\nAndy Shaw of \"Grovel\" had a more lukewarm response to \"The Killing Joke\", saying that though \"wonderfully executed\", it \"suffer[s] from its reliance on the rules of the superhero story\". Seb Patrick of \"Den of Geek\" also had a mixed response, calling \"The Killing Joke\" \"one of the most revered and influential 'Batman' stories ever written and arguably the definitive Joker story\", but adding that it's \"not at the level of [Alan Moore's] true masterpieces [such as] \"Watchmen\", \"V for Vendetta\" [and] \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\"\".\n\nIn a 2000 interview, Moore said: \"I don't think it's a very good book. It's not saying anything very interesting\". In 2003, he elaborated:\n\n\"The Killing Joke\" is a story about Batman and the Joker; it isn't about anything that you're ever going to encounter in real life, because Batman and the Joker are not like any human beings that have ever lived. So there's no important human information being imparted ... Yeah, it was something that I thought was clumsy, misjudged and had no real human importance. It was just about a couple of licensed DC characters that didn't really relate to the real world in any way.\n\nIn a 2006 interview with \"Wizard\" magazine, Moore was also critical about his decision to cripple Barbara Gordon: \"I asked DC if they had any problem with me crippling Barbara Gordon - who was Batgirl at the time - and if I remember, I spoke to Len Wein, who was our editor on the project ... [He] said, 'Yeah, okay, cripple the bitch'. It was probably one of the areas where they should've reined me in, but they didn't\".\n\nIn the introduction to the story as it appears in the \"DC Universe: The Stories of Alan Moore\" trade paperback, Brian Bolland disputes the widely held belief that the story started as a \"Batman\" annual story and ended up as a prestige-format book. Bolland recalls that the idea for a one-off \"Batman\" story focusing on the Joker—with Batman more of an incidental character—was his. Bolland says that in 1984, DC editor Dick Giordano told him he could do any project for DC he wanted, and Bolland requested to do a Batman/Joker prestige book with Moore as writer. Bolland has also expressed dissatisfaction with the final book, and regrets that its impending schedule for release meant he could not color the book himself (John Higgins was the colorist). Bolland says that \"the end result wasn't quite what I'd hoped. I don't think it rates with some of the highlights of Alan's career\". March 2008 saw the release of the artwork as Bolland intended it: the twentieth anniversary hardcover edition of \"The Killing Joke\" is completely recolored by Bolland himself. The book made \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list in May 2009.\n\nCritic Mark Vogler wrote that \"The Killing Joke\" provided the Joker \"with a sympathetic back story as it presented some of the villain's most vile offenses\". Moore's rendition of the Joker's origin employs elements of the 1951 story \"The Man Behind the Red Hood\" (\"Detective Comics\" #168), which established the concept of the Joker originally having been a thief known only as the Red Hood. The tragic and human elements of the character's story, coupled with his barbaric crimes as the Joker, portray the character as more of a three-dimensional human being. During an interview with \"Salon\", Moore explained that Joker's psychotic nature could have been caused by a \"bad decision\" in his life.\n\nMuch of the Joker's backstory from \"The Killing Joke\" is also referenced in 2004's \"Pushback\" (\"\" #50-55; reprinted with #66 as \"Batman: Hush Returns\"), in which the events are observed and reported by the Riddler, who recounts that the pregnant wife of the pre-accident Joker, who is called \"Jack\" prior to his accident, was kidnapped and murdered by the criminals in order to force his compliance.\n\nThe book has been the subject of feminist critique, criticizing the treatment of Barbara Gordon. Author Brian Cronin notes that \"[many] readers felt the violence towards Barbara Gordon was too much, and even Moore, in retrospect, has expressed his displeasure with how the story turned out\". Author Sharon Packer wrote: \"Anyone who feels that feminist critics overreacted to [Gordon's] accident is advised to consult the source material ... Moore's \"The Killing Joke\" is sadistic to the core. It shows Gordon stripped and mutilated, with before, during and after photos of the attack displayed before her bound and gagged father, the police commissioner. She is more than merely disabled\". Gail Simone included the character's paralysis in a list of \"major female characters that had been killed, mutilated, and depowered\", dubbing the phenomenon \"Women in Refrigerators\" in reference to a 1994 Green Lantern story where the title character discovers his girlfriend's mutilated body in his refrigerator. Author Jeffrey A. Brown noted \"The Killing Joke\" as an example of the \"relatively unequal violence [female characters] are subjected to\" in the major DC/Marvel comics industry. While male characters may be critically injured or killed, they are more than likely to be returned to their original conception, while \"women on the other hand, are more likely to be casually, but irreparably, wounded such as when Barbara Gordon's (the original Batgirl) spine was shattered by the Joker just for fun and has been restricted to a wheelchair for over a decade now\".\n\nIn 2007, Geoff Johns wrote a companion story to \"The Killing Joke\" entitled \"No Joke\" that appeared in the series \"Booster Gold\".\n\nIn the story, Booster Gold is charged by Rip Hunter to go back in time and save Barbara from being shot by the Joker. Booster arrives at the carnival shortly after the Joker has rounded up the freaks, only to be attacked by them. He manages to escape, but arrives too late to save Barbara. Catching the Joker in the middle of taking photos of the wounded Barbara, Booster attacks the Joker in a rage; the Joker nevertheless gains the upper hand, snapping several photos of Booster as well. Rip returns Booster to the future before Joker can murder him, but Booster demands to be sent back again. Booster fails several times until Rip reveals that the Joker is destined to paralyze her, as it would ensure that she would become Oracle. Rip did this to demonstrate to Booster that some points in time, like Barbara's paralysis, are fixed and cannot be prevented or altered, so that Booster would not continue insisting on rescuing his friend Ted Kord from death, another fixed point. The story also reveals that Batman kept the photos of Barbara and Booster, and had been waiting until Booster came of age before confronting him. Batman thanks Booster for trying to stop the Joker and offers him his friendship. Eventually, Dick Grayson, who becomes his mentor's temporary successor as Batman, would also learn about this and offer his thanks as well.\n\nIn 2010, writer J. Michael Straczynski and artist Cliff Chiang collaborated on a one-shot story called \"Ladies' Night\", which was published in the anthology series \"The Brave and the Bold\". The story is set shortly before \"The Killing Joke\" and deals with Zatanna and Wonder Woman struggling to come to terms with the impending attack on Barbara after Zatanna has a precognitive dream about it. Like \"No Joke\", the story heavily implies that the heroines cannot alter Barbara's fate, despite their desire to do so, instead giving her a final night on the town before she loses the use of her legs. The story also implies that Wonder Woman served as the inspiration for Barbara Gordon's eventual codename of Oracle.\n\nWhen DC Comics relaunched its continuity in 2011, many of Batman's stories were erased from history or altered, but the events of \"The Killing Joke\" remained intact. In the new continuity, Barbara Gordon recovered from the paralysis after four years. Although she resumes her work as Batgirl one year after recovering her mobility, she continues to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder when exposed to gunfire that could result in receiving new spinal damage.\n\nOn March 13, 2015 DC Comics released 25 Joker-themed variant covers for its various monthly series for release that June, in celebration of the character's 75th anniversary. Among them was a cover to \"Batgirl\" #41 by artist Rafael Albuquerque that took its inspiration from \"The Killing Joke\". The cover depicts the Joker standing next to a tearful Batgirl, who has a red smile painted across her mouth. The Joker has one hand holding a revolver draped over Batgirl's shoulder and is pointing to her cheek with the other hand, as if gesturing to shoot her. The cover quickly drew criticism for highlighting a dark period in the character's history, especially when juxtaposed with the youthful, more optimistic direction of the series at the time. The hashtag #changethecover drew dozens of posts on Twitter and Tumblr asking DC to not release the variant. DC ultimately withdrew the cover from publication at the request of Albuquerque, who stated, \"My intention was never to hurt or upset anyone through my art...For that reason, I have recommended to DC that the variant cover be pulled\".\n\n\n\"The Killing Joke\" is included in the 2006 trade paperback collection \"\".\n\nThere are multiple printings of the original comic graphic novel. The title on the cover of the multiple printings changes color.\n\nIn March 2008, a deluxe hardcover version of the book was released, featuring recoloring of the book by Brian Bolland. The new colors featured black-and-white flashbacks, as opposed to Higgins' colors, along with one or two items per panel colored in pink or red, up until the helmet of the Red Hood is revealed. In addition to recoloring the pages, Bolland also removed the yellow oval around the bat symbol on Batman's chest. Also included is a colored version of Bolland's \"An Innocent Guy\" (originally published in \"Batman Black and White\"), an introduction by Tim Sale and an epilogue by Bolland. Van Jensen of ComicMix said that \"the new colors really do improve the book, giving it a subtlety and grimness not present in the original\". James Donnelly of Pop Syndicate said that the original version \"is outdone by Bolland's recoloring\", which he said \"gives the comic a more timeless quality\". Seb Patrick of Den of Geek had a lukewarm reaction, calling the recoloring of the flashbacks \"superb\", but commenting that \"some of the [other] changes seem to have less of a point — increasing definition for the sake of it, but giving the book too much of a present-day feel rather than looking like it was printed in the 1980s\".\n\n \n"}

The company originated the modern concept of theatre for children in an educational context.\n\nBrian Way was born in Sussex, England, in 1923. He was the prime mover in a group of lecturers and teachers, who were in 1946 considering the relationship between theatre and teaching. People such as Peter Slade, Warren Jenkins and Brian English had a considerable influence on his thinking and he edited Slade's book \"Child Drama\". They worked together at Bristol Old Vic, where he met his first wife, Kathleen. After his marriage to her in 1946, they came to London and he continued to make a rather tenuous living from lecturing and teaching until the beginning of the fifties, when he provided a centre for unemployed actors, on occasional days, at a hall in Loudoun Road, St John's Wood.\n\nThere he produced plays in the round including \"Philoctetes\" and \"Pinocchio\", which he wrote with Warren Jenkins and an abbreviated version of \"The Man Born to be King\" by Dorothy L. Sayers. Sayers herself saw this production and was so impressed she donated £200 to him so that he could establish Theatre Centre as a company, whose board of management she joined. Brian, who had co-founded the West Country Children's Theatre Company after the war, again turned his attention to educational children's theatre. He believed that plays in this context ought to be performed in the round, for specific age groups limited in number, with professional actors capable of interacting with the children. He believed the plays should be entertaining, as well as informative. That philosophy has remained the purpose of Theatre Centre ever since. It was not, however, until 1965 that theatre in education became an accepted part of the educational system and of professional theatre.\n\nBrian stated his beliefs in two seminal books, \"Development Through Drama\" and \"Audience Participation\", which have been translated into many languages. He retired from Theatre Centre in 1977 and he has to his credit more than 50 plays. He became a visiting professor in a number of distinguished universities, moving permanently to Canada in 1983 and living in Toronto with his second wife Perri. He is survived by her, by Kathleen and by his three children David, Peter and Amanda. He was a seminal figure in the development of educational theatre. He died in Toronto in 2006.\n\nThe Arts Council of Great Britain established The Children's Award to celebrate the accomplishments and raise the profile of theatre for young people and most especially playwrights who work in this field. Since 2006 Theatre Centre has administrated this Award, which has been renamed 'The Brian Way Award' in honour and recognition of this pioneering man of extraordinary vision.\n\n"}

At the age of six, Simon’s parents were murdered by the forces of Dracula (voiced by Robert Carlyle) and Simon was lucky to escape with his own life. Lost and alone, he was found in the forest by some of the mountain people. Simon was taken in and raised amongst them. Simon never forgot what had happened to his parents and vowed to deliver vengeance one day upon those responsible. He trained hard and was extremely gifted in combat, yet life was hard for young Simon growing up. Always an outcast amongst the tribe, he developed a strong will and stubborn attitude that would always boil over into rage, and men soon came to fear him and his prowess in the arts of war.

The reason for the transposition is not known: one speculation is that the aim was to increase the contrast between the two works. F major is a \"flat\" key and B minor is a \"sharp\" key, and the keynotes are related by a tritone, which is the most distant modulation. Another possible motivation is that out of the eight German note names A, B (B), C, D, E, F, G, H (B), six had already been used as keynotes in the Partitas, thus only F and H remained.\n"}

The changes in the actual game engine are few, but significant. The 4 and 6-panel modes are offered instead of the usual options, and the chubby arrows of the Solo series also appear. Multi-player Mode from the Solo series is not present in either game.\n\nWhile not Solo releases per se, these games offer a one-player mode inspired by \"Solo\".\n\nAll songs from \"Solo BASSMIX\" can also be played in \"Solo 2000\".\nDance Dance Revolution Kids\n\nDancing Karaoke DKara\nA combined soundtrack for both \"DDR Solo\" mixes was released by Toshiba-EMI under their Dancemania dance music brand. It contains 35 tracks from the game and all 9 megamixes.\n\nIn 2002, a bowling alley in San Diego, California removed a \"Solo 2000\" machine after Jennifer Stoefen and several members of a local group, known as Youth Advocacy Coalition (YAC), complained that the background movies of selected songs contained images that could promote substance abuse, such as a scantily clad nurse and pills in \"I'm Alive\" and alcoholic drinks appearing in \"Club Tropicana\". \n\nThe alley opted to replace the \"Solo 2000\" machine with a \"DDRMAX Dance Dance Revolution 6thMix\" machine, which removes the nurse theme and alcohol references, but includes profanity. Konami responded by warning arcades that such machines are illegally imported. Using the DDR Freak fan site, the YAC located other \"Solo 2000\" machines and considered contacting the operators, asking for the games to be removed or replaced. In response, DDR Freak published a statement that denied the allegations of \"Dance Dance Revolution\" promoting substance abuse, pointing out that \"Solo 2000\" had a medical theme instead.

The episodes involved the Fowler and Beale family travelling from London to Ireland to meet their long-lost relatives. They were badly received by viewers and heavily criticised in the media. The BBC was inundated with complaints from angry viewers from Ireland for negative stereotyping, portraying Irish people as \"dirty, rude, and drunk\". Complaints were made by the Irish Embassy and there were fears that the episodes would have a negative effect on the Irish tourist trade. The BBC was forced to issue an apology for causing offence.\n\nIn 1997, \"EastEnders\" aired a storyline in which the character Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard) discovers that she has a long-lost sister, Maggie Flaherty (Olivia Shanley). In the storyline, Pauline's now-deceased mother Lou Beale had given Maggie up for adoption shortly after her birth, as she was born out of wedlock. Maggie is first said to be the result of an illicit affair Lou had with an Irishman 60 years earlier, but although Maggie is initially thought to be Pauline's half-sister, it later transpires that they share the same father too; Maggie was only the result of pre-marital sex between Lou and her husband-to-be, Albert Beale.\n\nPauline and various members of the Fowler and Beale family travel to Ireland to reunite with their long-lost relatives in a special week of episodes. The episodes were filmed on location in the countryside around County Dublin, away from the soap's typical filming location in Borehamwood, England. They were filmed over a period of two weeks in July and August 1997, and were broadcast on 22, 23 and 25 September 1997. In the three episodes, Pauline is accompanied by her sons Mark Fowler (Todd Carty) and Martin Fowler (James Alexandrou), Mark's wife Ruth Fowler (Caroline Paterson), nephew Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) and his daughter Lucy Beale (Casey Anne Rothery). Speaking about their trip to Dublin, actress Wendy Richard who played Pauline said \"It's nice to be in Dublin for a change. It's not like London at all, where they take you a little bit for granted\", and Todd Carty, who played her screen son Mark, said \"It's also really nice to get out of Albert Square for a while to do something different.\"\n\nA number of Irish actors were cast as Pauline's long-lost relatives, many of whom were starring in their first prominent television role. They included Maggie Flaherty, played by Olivia Shanley, son Conor (Sean Gleeson) and his headstrong daughter Mary (Melanie Clark Pullen). For the latter two characters, Conor and Mary, the Ireland episodes were only the beginning of their stint in \"EastEnders\". Both characters remained in the serial as regulars, moving back to the soap's setting in Albert Square to be with the new-found family. They remained on-screen for two years. At the time of filming the Ireland episodes, Gleeson, from Thurles, County Tipperary, said, \"The \"EastEnders\" cast are all really nice people\", and Shanley said, \"I've always been a big fan of \"EastEnders\" and to tell the truth I was a bit star struck [...] But they made us all feel very much at ease.\" Clark Pullen added, \"I was expecting the cast to be luvvies but they were all brilliant – real grafters and totally down to earth. They were all very supportive as well and made me feel right at home. I was pretty starstruck [...] Wendy Richard who plays Pauline Fowler was great – she is the most wonderful woman and she quietly gave me advice on how to cope with the sudden fame and attention.\" They were also joined by a host of other characters, including Maggie's husband Sean (Pat Laffan), second son Eamonn (Maurice O'Donoghue), Eamonn's wife Brenda (Janet Behan) and daughter Colette (Shiona Redmond).\n\nThe episodes were not well received by viewers or the media. The BBC and the programme makers were heavily criticised for the stereotypical way they portrayed Irish people. Viewers were angered by scenes that they felt portrayed Irish as resentful towards English, drunk, dirty, poor and rude – one scene showed a drunk man pouring beer over Pauline Fowler (later revealed to be her brother-in-law), and then demanding payment for the drink. Others were angered by the scriptwriters' decision to include various farm animals in a street scene on the outskirts of Dublin, with one viewer commenting to the \"Daily Mirror\": \"It was nothing like life in the real Ireland of today. When did you last see a donkey walking along our streets? The EastEnders production team haven't got a clue about modern Irish society; they are living in the Dark Ages.\"\n\nThe BBC and RTÉ (the Public Service Broadcaster of Ireland) received complaints from angry Irish people all over Britain and Ireland, and it was reported that viewers \"bombarded\" local and national radio stations, claiming the episodes were an insult to Irish people everywhere. Callers to Radio Ulster's Talkback programme and Gerry Ryan's morning talk show on RTÉ radio, demanded that the scriptwriters be sacked. BBC contributor Mike Philpott described the show as \"the worst case of stage 'Oirish' seen for a long time\" and \"one of the most shameful half-hour episodes in the history of British television\".\n\nThe angry reaction stretched from official channels, such as the Irish Embassy, to holiday chiefs, who feared that the episodes would have a negative effect on tourist trade. The Irish Embassy in London said, \"[\"EastEnders\"] has caused a great deal of upset and annoyance in the country [Ireland] and with Irish people in Britain.\" Furthermore, they suggested that the episodes \"presented a prejudiced and stereotyped view of Ireland that [was] utterly unrecognisable.\" Ted Barrington, Ireland's ambassador to the UK, described the portrayal of Ireland as an \"unrepresentative caricature\", stating he was worried by the negative stereotypes and the images of drunkenness, backwardness and isolation. He added, \"EastEnders is a powerful and very concentrated medium … People are upset at the caricature and misrepresentation of Ireland. Irish people can laugh at themselves but, the point is, this is one of the most popular programmes on British television, and it decided to present an image of Ireland that conforms to old-fashioned negative stereotypes. It selected an unrepresentative range of stereotypes. Cultural and racial stereotyping tends to create barriers between people.\"\n\nMark Mortell, the chairman of Ireland's national tourism development, Bord Fáilte, said: \"I am enormously concerned that the single biggest television audience in Britain was shown a negative image of Irish hospitality … It has the potential to be enormously damaging.\" His colleague, John Lahiffe, added: \"I am dismayed by the mischievous nature of it. We go to great efforts to promote this country, but it was in no way representative of Ireland.\"\n\nVarious Irish entertainers and sports personalities also went public with their opinions on the episodes. Broadcaster Gerry Kelly labelled the episodes racist, and an unmitigated disaster. The Irish actors, who were employed specifically for the storyline, were also criticised by Kelly for not speaking out against the scenes they were enacting. He accused them of selling out their heritage and denigrating their fellow-countrymen. Comic Brendan O'Carroll said, \"Whoever wrote the script has obviously never been to Ireland. I'm very disappointed because \"EastEnders\" is a programme I have great respect for. It is outrageous and untrue to portray us like that. I'm disappointed the producers allowed it to be broadcast as it was.\" Former jockey and TV presenter Declan Murphy said, \"It's wrong and disgraceful when writers portray everyone from Ireland as backward drunks. I am an Irishman and I'm proud of it, but I'm not a drunk and I'm certainly not backward and neither are my compatriots.\" Actor Garret Keogh, who played an \"ignorant\" Irish hotel owner in the \"EastEnders\" episodes, revealed: \"The streets around Cabra, where I live, are hopping. I went down to get the paper and some bread and I was accosted. The script has stirred up a hell of a hornets' nest here. I'm only an actor, but I wouldn't want to do anything that would be demeaning to me, my people or my country.\" However, actor Dermot Morgan urged Irish people not to over-react: \"I'm sure there's no great conspiracy against Irish people here. The BBC have a good track record and this would seem to be a dodgy storyline that has somehow crept through. As for being drunks, surely they must only mean on a Saturday night!\"\n\nComplaints were upheld by the British Broadcasting Standards Commission, who said \"the intention was positive rather than negative but the result was clumsy and irritating\". The BBC said, \"EastEnders has a reputation for showing slices of life in many different ways and sometimes these are not flattering\", but they admitted that the episodes were \"ill-judged\" and issued a public apology for causing offence and misrepresenting Irish people. Jana Bennett, the BBC's then director of production, stated on BBC1's news bulletin: \"It is clear that a significant number of viewers have been upset by the recent episodes of \"EastEnders\", and we are very sorry, because the production team and programme makers did not mean to cause any offence.\" A year later, in 1998, BBC chairman Christopher Bland admitted that as result of the Irish-set \"EastEnders\" episodes, the station failed in its pledge to represent all groups accurately and avoid reinforcing prejudice.\n\nMargaret \"Maggie\" Flaherty is the illegitimate child of Lou (Anna Wing) and Albert Beale (Gary Olsen), before they married. She was given up for adoption, as she was born out of wedlock, and was sent to live with a family in Ireland.\n\nIn 1996, eight years after Lou's death in 1988, her youngest daughter Pauline (Wendy Richard) finds a letter from Lou to her best friend Ethel (Gretchen Franklin), revealing that she had a secret daughter. Pauline and her family try to find Maggie, and when they do, they visit her in Kilmoneen, Ireland.\n\nWhilst in Ireland, Maggie's lecherous husband Sean (Pat Laffin) flirts with Pauline, and is abusive to his granddaughter, Mary (Melanie Clark Pullen). When Pauline and her family leave, taking Mary with them, she begs Maggie to leave Sean and return to Walford with her, but Maggie decides to stay and look after her vast family. This is the last time she is seen.\n\nHer grown up family send a wreath to Pauline's funeral in 2006 and Maggie herself sends flowers and a condolence message to her nephew Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), when his daughter Lucy (Hetti Bywater) dies in 2014.\n\nSean Flaherty, portrayed by Pat Laffin, is first seen as a lecherous drunk in a pub in the Irish village of Kilmoneen. Sean leers over Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard)'s breasts and tries to buy her a drink, only to be told to leave her alone by Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). He later goes over to Pauline and tries to touch her, spilling stout on her. He is then thrown out of the bar.\n\nLater, when Pauline is at Maggie's house, and her eldest son Eamonn brings his father home, Pauline is shocked to see that Maggie was married to Sean.\n\nEamonn later tells Sean of his granddaughter Mary (Melanie Clark Pullen)'s affair with married man Gerry McCrae. Maggie races to Mary's school to collect her before violent Sean can get to her. She begs Pauline to take Mary back to Walford with her. Pauline gets Sean drunk until he falls asleep and then helps Maggie pack Mary's clothes.\n\nAs Pauline, Mary and the family leave Kilmoneen, Sean staggers into the road to try to stop the car, and stop Mary from leaving. Mark (Todd Carty) gets out of the car and punches Sean in the groin, and they speed off in the car, leaving Sean doubled over in pain.\n\nConor Flaherty, played by Seán Gleeson, is Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard)'s nephew – the son of her long-lost sister Maggie and her husband Sean. Conor also has a daughter, Mary Flaherty (Melanie Clark Pullen), from his first marriage but he doesn't get on with her. When Mary decides she wants to move to Walford with Pauline, Conor also follows her.\n\nMary Flaherty, played by Melanie Clark Pullen, is the daughter of Conor Flaherty (Seán Gleeson). Mary is having an affair with an older married man, Gerry McCrae. She decides to move to Walford with the Fowlers to escape her alcoholic, violent grandfather, Sean, who finds out about her affair. Her father also follows her.\n\nEamonn Flaherty, portrayed by Maurice O'Donoghue, is Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard)'s nephew – the eldest son of her long-lost sister Maggie and her husband Sean.\n\nEamonn is unwelcoming to his long-lost relatives, and extremely loyal to his drunken father. He defends his father's bullying to his long-lost cousin Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), and they nearly come to blows because of this. According to the Kilmoneen hotelier, Patrick, Eamonn had been on the receiving end of his father's abuse as a child and was severely whipped with a belt for stealing chocolate. Patrick comments, \"you don't break the commandments, not in Sean's house\". Even though he is of aware of the potential repercussions, Eamonn informs his father that his niece Mary (Melanie Clark Pullen) has been having an affair with a married man, and Sean is furious. Maggie fears for her safety, so she sends her to London to live with Pauline.\n\nBrenda Flaherty, portrayed by Janet Behan, is Maggie's daughter-in-law, married to her son Eamonn, and mother to his children, Colette, Eamonn and Kylie.\n\nShe is sent to collect Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard) and her family and takes them to meet Maggie.\n\nShe is lazy and smelly; Mary (Melanie Clark Pullen) says she needs a bath. She is too lazy to collect her son, Eamonn, from choir practice, and sends Martin (James Alexandrou) and Colette to get him.\n\nColette Flaherty, portrayed by Shiona Redmond, is the eldest daughter of Eamonn and Brenda Flaherty.\n\nColette is the same age as her first cousin once removed, Martin Fowler (James Alexandrou), and the pair hit it off. This is only a holiday romance however, as Martin leaves with his family the following week. Colette hasn't been seen or heard from since.\n\nEamonn Flaherty, played by Seán Walsh, is the son of Eamonn (after whom he was named) and Brenda Flaherty. Eamonn is witness to the first kiss between his sister Colette and Martin Fowler (James Alexandrou), when they go to collect him from choir practice.\n\nGerry McCrae is the shopkeeper in Kilmoneen, the Irish village where the Flaherty family live.\n\nGerry is a married man, but is secretly having an affair with Mary Flaherty (Melanie Clark Pullen). He tells Mary he is leaving his wife to be with her, but Mary ends their relationship publicly, and the local bartender, Patrick, hears their argument and tells Mary's uncle, Eamonn. Eamonn cannot wait to tell his violent, alcoholic father Sean, which leads to Mary's departure from the village, scared of what Sean will do to her.\n"}

The film was shot primarily in the United Kingdom, Iceland, and Cádiz, Spain. Other locations included Pinewood Studios' historic 007 Stage, and scenes shot in Maui, Hawaii, in December 2001.\nLaird Hamilton, Dave Kalama, and Darrick Doerner performed the pre-title surfing scene at the surf break known as Jaws in Peahi, Maui, while the shore shots were taken near Cádiz and Newquay, Cornwall. Scenes inside Graves' diamond mine were also filmed in Cornwall, at the Eden Project. The scenes involving the Cuban locations Havana and the fictional Isla Los Organos were filmed at La Caleta, Spain.\n\nThe scenes featuring Berry in a bikini were shot in Cádiz; the location was reportedly cold and windy, and footage has been released of Berry wrapped in thick towels between takes to avoid catching a chill. Berry was injured during filming when debris from a smoke grenade flew into her eye. The debris was removed in a 30-minute operation.\n\nGadgets and other props from every previous Bond film and stored in Eon Productions' archives appear in Q's warehouse in the London Underground. Examples include the jetpack in \"Thunderball\" and Rosa Klebb's poison-tipped shoe in \"From Russia with Love\". Q mentions that the watch he issues Bond is \"your 20th, I believe\", a reference to \"Die Another Day\" being the 20th Eon-produced Bond film. In London, the Reform Club was used to shoot several places in the film, including the lobby at the Blades Club, MI6 Headquarters, Buckingham Palace, Green Park, and Westminster. Svalbard, Norway and Jökulsárlón, Iceland were used for the car chase on the ice with additional scenes filmed at Jostedalsbreen National Park, Norway and RAF Little Rissington, Gloucestershire.\n\nThe scene where Bond surfs the wave that Icarus created when Graves was trying to kill Bond was shot on the blue screen. The waves and all of the glaciers in the scene were digitally produced.\n\nThe hangar interior of the \"US Air Base in South Korea\", shown crowded with Chinook helicopters, was filmed at RAF Odiham in Hampshire, UK, as were the helicopter interior shots during the Switchblade sequence although this took place entirely on the ground with the sky background being added in post-production using blue screen techniques. Although in the plot the base is American, in reality all the aircraft and personnel in the shot are British. In the film, a Switchblade (one-man glider shaped like a fighter jet) is used by Bond and Jinx to enter North Korea undetected. The Switchblade was based on a workable model called \"PHASST\" (Programmable High Altitude Single Soldier Transport). Kinetic Aerospace Inc.'s lead designer, Jack McCornack was impressed by director Lee Tamahori's way of conducting the Switchblade scene and said, \"It's brief, but realistic. The good guys get in unobserved, thanks to a fast cruise, good glide performance, and minimal radar signature. It's a wonderful promotion for the PHASST.\" Also, Graves' plane was a model that was controlled by a computer. When the plane flew through the Icarus beam, engineers cut the plane away piece by piece so that it looked like it was burning and falling apart.\n\nThe sex scene between Bond and Jinx—the first time onscreen in the series in which Bond is depicted actually having sex as opposed to a post-coital scenario—had to be trimmed for the American market. An early cut of \"Die Another Day\" featured a brief moment—seven seconds in length—in which Jinx is heard moaning strongly. The MPAA ordered that the scene be trimmed so that \"Die Another Day\" could get the expected PG-13 rating. The scene was cut as requested, earning the film a PG-13 rating for \"action violence and sexuality.\"\n\nPrincipal photography for \"Casino Royale\" commenced on 3 January 2006 and concluded on 20 July 2006. The film was primarily shot at Barrandov Studios in Prague, with additional location shooting in the Bahamas, Italy and the United Kingdom. The shoot concluded at Pinewood Studios.\n\nInitially, Michael G. Wilson confirmed that \"Casino Royale\" would either be filmed or take place in Prague and South Africa. However, Eon Productions encountered problems in securing film locations in South Africa. After no other locations became available, the producers had to reconsider their options. In September 2005, Martin Campbell and director of photography Phil Meheux were scouting Paradise Island in the Bahamas as a possible location for the film. On 6 October 2005, Martin Campbell confirmed that \"Casino Royale\" would film in the Bahamas and \"maybe Italy\". In addition to the extensive location filming, studio work including choreography and stunt coordination practice was performed at the Barrandov Studios in Prague and at Pinewood Studios where the film used several stages as well as the paddock tank and the historic 007 Stage. Further shooting in the UK was scheduled for Dunsfold Aerodrome in Surrey, the cricket pavilion at Eton College (although that particular scene was cut from the completed movie) and the Millbrook Vehicle Proving Ground in Bedfordshire.\n\nAfter Prague, the production moved to the Bahamas. Several locations around New Providence were used for filming during February and March, particularly on Paradise Island. Footage set in Mbale, Uganda, was filmed at Black Park, a Country Park in Buckinghamshire, on 4 July 2006. Additional scenes took place at Albany House, an estate owned by golfers Ernie Els and Tiger Woods. The crew returned to the Czech Republic in April, and continued there, filming in Prague, Planá and Loket, before completing in the town of Karlovy Vary in May. A famous Czech spa, Karlovy Vary, in German known as the Karlsbad, was used as the exterior of the Casino Royale, with the Grandhotel Pupp serving as \"Hotel Splendide\". The main Italian location was Venice, where the majority of the film's ending is set. Other scenes in the latter half of the film were shot in late May and early June at the Villa del Balbianello on the shores of Lake Como. Further exterior shooting for the movie took place at properties such as the Villa la Gaeta, near the lakeside town of Menaggio.\n\nA recreation of the Body Worlds exhibit provided a setting for one scene in the film. Among the Body Worlds plastinates featured in that scene were the \"Poker Playing Trio\" (which plays a key role in one scene) and \"Rearing Horse and Rider\". The exhibition's developer and promoter, German anatomist Gunther von Hagens, also has a cameo appearance in the film, although only his trademark hat is actually visible on screen.\n\nOn 30 July 2006, a fire broke out at the 007 Stage. The damage was significant, but had no effect on the release of \"Casino Royale\" as the incident occurred one week after filming had been completed, and the sets were in the process of being dismantled. On 11 August 2006, Pinewood Studios confirmed that no attempt would be made to salvage the remains of the stage; instead it would be rebuilt from scratch.\n\n\"Quantum of Solace\" was shot in six countries. Second unit filming began in Italy at the Palio di Siena horse race on 16 August 2007: although at this point Forster was unsure how it would fit into the film. Some scenes were filmed also in Maratea and Craco, two small distinctive towns in Basilicata in southern Italy. Other places used for location shooting were Madrid in August 2007; Baja California, Mexico in early 2008, for shots of the aerial battle; Malcesine, Limone sul Garda and Tremosine in Italy during March, and at Talamone during the end of April. The main unit began on 3 January 2008, at Pinewood Studios. The 007 Stage was used for the fight in the art gallery, and an MI6 safehouse hidden within the city's cisterns, while other stages housed Bond's Bolivian hotel suite, and the MI6 headquarters. Interior and exterior airport scenes were filmed at Farnborough Airfield and the snowy closing scenes were filmed at the Bruneval Barracks in Aldershot.\n\nShooting in Panama City began on 7 February 2008 at Howard Air Force Base. The country doubled for Haiti and Bolivia, with the National Institute of Culture of Panama standing in for a hotel in the latter country. A sequence requiring several hundred extras was also shot at nearby Colón. Shooting in Panama was also carried out at Fort Sherman, a former US military base on the Colón coast. Forster was disappointed he could only shoot the boat chase in that harbour, as he had a more spectacular vision for the scene. Officials in the country worked with the locals to \"minimise inconvenience\" for the cast and crew, and in return hoped the city's exposure in the film would increase tourism. The crew was going to move to Cusco, Peru for ten days of filming on 2 March, but the location was cancelled for budget reasons. Twelve days of filming in Chile began on 24 March at Antofagasta. There was shooting in Cobija, the Paranal Observatory, and other locations in the Atacama Desert. Forster chose the desert and the observatory's ESO Hotel to represent Bond's rigid emotions, and being on the verge of committing a vengeful act as he confronts Greene in the film's climax.\n\nWhile filming in Sierra Gorda, Chile, the local mayor, Carlos Lopez, staged a protest because he was angry at the filmmakers' portrayal of the Antofagasta region as part of Bolivia. He was arrested, detained briefly, and put on trial two days later. Eon dismissed his claim that they needed his permission to film in the area. Michael G. Wilson also explained Bolivia was appropriate to the plot, because of the country's history of water problems, and was surprised the two countries disliked each other a century after the War of the Pacific. In a poll by Chilean daily newspaper \"La Segunda\", 75% of its readers disagreed with Lopez's actions, due to the negative image they felt it presented of Chile, and the controversy's potential to put off productions looking to film in the country in the future.\n\nFrom 4–12 April, the main unit shot on Sienese rooftops. Shooting on the real rooftops turned out to be less expensive than building them at Pinewood. The next four weeks were scheduled for filming the car chase at Lake Garda and Carrara. On 19 April, an Aston Martin employee driving a DBS to the set crashed into the lake. He survived, and was fined £400 for reckless driving. Another accident occurred on 21 April, and two days later, two stuntmen were seriously injured, with one, Greek stuntman Aris Comninos, having to be put in intensive care. Filming of the scenes was temporarily halted so that Italian police could investigate the causes of the accidents. Stunt co-ordinator Gary Powell said the accidents were a testament to the realism of the action. Rumours of a \"curse\" spread among tabloid media, something which deeply offended Craig, who disliked that they compared Comninos' accident to something like his minor finger injury later on the shoot (also part of the \"curse\"). Comninos recovered safely from his injury.\n\nFilming took place at the floating opera stage at Bregenz, Austria, from 28 April – 9 May 2008. The sequence, where Bond stalks the villains during a performance of \"Tosca\", required 1500 extras. The production used a large model of an eye, which Forster felt fitted in the Bond style, and the opera itself has parallels to the film. A short driving sequence was filmed at the nearby Feldkirch, Vorarlberg. The crew returned to Italy from 13–17 May to shoot a (planned) car crash at the marble quarry in Carrara, and a recreation of the Palio di Siena at the Piazza del Campo in Siena. 1000 extras were hired for a scene where Bond emerges from the \"Fonte Gaia\". Originally, he would have emerged from the city's cisterns at Siena Cathedral, but this was thought disrespectful. By June, the crew returned to Pinewood for four weeks, where new sets (including the interior of the hotel in the climax) were built. The wrap party was held on 21 June.\n"}

The IMS began in 1968 and now has over 41,000 members worldwide. It was created to help promote and preserve the art of magic and provide a format where magicians could share their secrets and ideas.\n\nThe IMS named Siegfried & Roy as the Magicians of the Century in 2000 and named David Copperfield, Doug Henning, Harry Blackstone, Jr., Criss Angel and David Blaine as the most influential magicians of the past 25 years. The organization awards the Merlin Awards, every three years. \"Every three years, the International Magicians Society hosts a banquet dinner, where those magicians who have achieved the highest level in their craft are awarded the coveted Merlin Award. The voting members begin with approximately one hundred names and narrows down to a handful. The criteria that the voting members consider are talent, showmanship, originality, skills, and above all the rare ability to entertain under any conditions.\"\n\nThe Merlin Award is given to magicians in recognition of their contributions to the performance and creation of magic around the world. While sometimes called the Academy Awards of magic, the Merlin Award lacks much of the oversight that enhance the credibility of awards in other industries.\n\nThe award was created by Tony Hassini and his International Magicians Society and is given out to invited guests at triennial banquets as well as in person by Hassini himself with greater frequency.\n\nThe award is intended to be a recognition for magicians who perform at the highest level of skills on national and international stages. Merlin award can be obtained in three ways.One is to attend Merlin Award banquet dinner on invitation, after being voted to receive the prize. Another is by participating and winning a Merlin Award competition organized by IMS and held in different countries. Third way is for the organizers to travel to the magician’s country to present the award there. The criteria considered are talent, showmanship, originality, skills, and an ability to entertain under any conditions.\n\nThe award statue was commissioned to over 100 art students in a nationwide search. The winning design was created by Carol Michaud, a New York University art student, in 1968.\n\nBelow are the list of past recipients of the award.\n\nBelow are the details of 2010 edition of Merlin Awards:\n\nPopular magicians & illusionists like Morgan Strebler, Dekhati Magin & Gopinath Muthukad are among the winners of 2011 awards announced recently.\n\nIn August 2013, several magicians were honored with the coveted Merlin Award in Las Vegas. Johnny Thompson, Paul Vigil, and Morgan Strebler, were among those that received the award. In November 2013 Luca Volpe was the first Italian Mentalist to receive the prestigious Merlin Award with the title of Mentalist of the Year Europe.\n\nIn May 2014, Romanos was the first Greek mentalist to receive the prestigious Merlin Award as “Mentalist of the Year Europe 2014”.\nin May 2014, Moustapha Berjaoui was the first Egyptian Illusionist ever to receive the Prestigious Merlin Award as \"Best Illusionist Egypt 2014\".\nIn November 2014 Antonio Arredondo A.K.A Tonny Poker was awarded with two Merlin Medals for his original performance, one of the awards he received was for \"Best close up magic\" and another for \"Best comedy magic\" he was the only double-recipient of this award in the Cali-magico competition held in Colombia.\n\nZenia Bhumgara. Her passion and enthusiasm for this offbeat career paid off on the third week of September when she was awarded the prestigious Merlin award by the International Magicians Association in Mumbai, India.\n\nHandy Altan. He is known for one of the outstanding close up magician in Indonesia. His passion and enthusiasm in teaching magic to the lay people, developing the art itself, and his art-movement to unite magic art enthusiast in Indonesia has been an excellent example. For this, on October 2015 he was awarded the prestigious Merlin Award by the International Magicians Society for the Best Magic Movement.\n\nin May 2016, Hany show received the Prestigious Merlin Award as \" Best Stage Magic Middle East 2016.\n\nMerlin Awards are not listed with either category or date:\n\n\"\"Sometimes, I am asked why don’t we publish the year and category for each magician’s Merlin Award on our website. The fact is that when the magician receives his award, during the press conference, we announce the category. Thereafter, it serves no purpose to publish the category or the year on our website. Because some categories might sound more glorious than the others, there’s no point of hyping or diminishing anyone’s award or the year they received it. And there’s no point in dating their awards either. The bottom line is everyone who received the Merlin Award is a Merlin Award Recipient period and is entitled to enjoy the glory for the rest of their life without dating or categorizing it.”\" - Tony Hassini\n\nIt has been suggested that the Merlin Awards exist purely to generate publicity for the artist and income for the IMS. Tony Hassini clarifies this in the FAQ page of The International Magicians Society.\n\n\"I’m also asked how do we consider a nominee for the Merlin Award? A magician must send to the IMS World Headquarters a videotape or DVD of his complete act for our Board of Directors to consider. (No promo DVD’s or online videos are accepted.) The other question I am asked is “Are there any costs to receive the Merlin Award?” First, I must say that the Merlin Award is not for sale at any cost. Regarding the actual out-of-pocket cost, this varies from situation to situation. There are three ways a magician can receive the Merlin Award. One is to attend our Merlin Award banquet dinner; this is by invitation only, after the recipient was voted to receive the Merlin Award. Two is to participate and win a Merlin Award competition in different countries, which is organized by IMS with the event and convention organizers. And three is for us to travel to the magician’s country and present the Merlin Award to them in their own country. So let’s look at the cost of the first scenario, which is where the magician must obtain a visa from the American embassy to travel to the USA. He must purchase airline tickets, other travel related costs and fees, hotels, meals, and $500 US dollars per plate at the Merlin Award banquet dinner. In the second scenario, again the magician must travel to the event where the Merlin Award competition is taking place. He pays all of the same travel expenses as mentioned in the first scenario and pays for the entrance fee to the convention or to the competition, whichever applies. In the third scenario, where we have to travel from the USA to the magician’s country, either the magician or the magician’s producer pays for all of the travel expenses, hotels, meals, airlines, and other related expenses. Within any of these three scenarios, it’s always a trade when it comes to the cost. Within any of the three scenarios, our main focus is to generate as much PR as possible with the general public. A good example of this is when we were going to present the Merlin Award to Louis Yan in Hong Kong, we could have presented the award to him in our Hong Kong IMS office. Or we could have had our IMS members meet at a nice Chinese restaurant and present the award to him there. Then we came up with an idea. We approached one of the largest shopping malls in Hong Kong. Not only did they build a custom stage and provided enough seating for the audience, they also provided guards for crowd control. The mall management, with their media contacts, were able to invite newspapers, radio, and television to cover the event. Both the mall and Louis Yan received tremendous PR and public awareness.\" - Tony Hassini\nThe distribution of Merlin Awards to virtually unknown magicians in countries like Thailand, India and Vietnam and unethical dealers like Tora Magic who received the \"First Producer and Best Designer of Magic Items\" Merlin Award has also caused many prominent magicians within the industry to question the authenticity of the award as well as industry journalists. \"A YouTube promotional video...also touts the Merlin Awards, which are handed out by a frizzy-haired Marty Allen look-alike named Tony Hassini. Casanova, meet every other magician in town!\" - Mike Weatherford, Las Vegas Review Journal \n\nTony Hassini visited Guam on January 4, 2018 to present magicians Chris & Ryan Zubrick the famed Merlin Award for “Best Family Magic Show” for their show “Zubrick”, currently running at the SandCastle Dinner Theater.\n\nDuring the presentation ceremony Toni Hassini was quoted saying, “We look for originality. We look for showmanship and above all we look for magicians who can perform under any circumstances. And for the first time we are presenting the Merlin Award on Guam and to very fine and very talented two magicians, [The] Zubricks,” said Hassini.\n\n"}

A lone gunman, David Katz, shot and killed two people and injured another ten before committing suicide.\n\nThe GLHF (Good Luck Have Fun) Game Bar, a video game venue in the Jacksonville Landing indoor marketplace, hosted a \"Madden NFL 19\" video gaming tournament on August 26, 2018, with around 130 to 150 participants and onlookers. After one of the participants, David Katz, lost a game, he refused to shake the hand of the winner and left the tournament. Soon after, he returned with one of the two handguns he had brought to the event.\n\nKatz fired 12 shots, killing two people and wounding ten others, then committed suicide. Two more sustained injuries while fleeing. A tournament announcer said that he had been interviewing the first victim before he was fatally shot, and that he had been intentionally targeted. The gunman then turned and began shooting indiscriminately.\n\nGunfire was first reported on social media at 1:34 pm EDT by tournament participants. The event's Twitch stream recorded footage of the shooting, which was later uploaded to YouTube.\n\nThe Jacksonville Sheriff's Office urged individuals to stay away from the location at 2:13 p.m. EDT, and SWAT officers evacuated and searched the area. First responders arrived on the scene within two minutes of the first 911 call, and arrived at 1:36 pm EDT. The president of the firefighters union told reporters that they were training in the area when victims had run up to them for help. Due to the location being next to the St. Johns River, the Coast Guard was called in to sweep the surrounding waterways.\n\n\nEleven people were taken to hospitals for treatment of their injuries. Some of the injured had been able to leave the bar and sought assistance from first responders. Two others had driven themselves to the emergency department. Of those injured, ten individuals were wounded by gunshot wounds and one person was injured attempting to flee from the location. The day after the incident Memorial Hospital released a statement that one individual had minor injuries, and three were in good condition, and UF Health announced that four victims had been released, with two still admitted.\n\nThe shooter, David Katz, was a 24-year-old professional \"Madden\" player from Baltimore, Maryland, who had been attending the Jacksonville tournament as a participant. Katz had lost a few rounds in the competition, which prevented him from reaching the finals. Fellow competitors reported that he had been \"acting weird\" and refused to shake hands with them after losing the competition. His pseudonyms included \"Bread\", \"mrslicedbread\", \"RavensChamp\",\"ravens2012champ\" and \"TREXHAVAHARTATAK\". He had previously won $10,000 in a 2017 \"Madden\" Tournament. Katz had a history of mental illness and was prescribed anti-psychotic medicine.\n\nThe Jacksonville Sheriff's Office used Twitter to announce that there were fatalities at the scene at 2:45 p.m. EDT, and that one suspect was dead at the scene at 2:53 p.m. EDT. Initially, it was unknown whether there were additional gunmen, but later, officials confirmed that there was only one suspect in the shooting. He was armed with a .45 caliber handgun and a 9mm handgun, with the Sheriffs Office stating that one of the weapons was equipped with an aftermarket laser sight attached to the trigger guard. The weapons had been stored in his vehicle, and purchased legally in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nThe Sheriff's Office issued an update at 7:37 p.m. EDT, indicating that the FBI were involved in the investigation, and that there was coordination with officers in the suspect's hometown, Baltimore, Maryland. Police and federal agents visited a house in South Baltimore, which was identified as Katz's father's home. They added that updates would be posted on their Twitter account. Electronic Arts, who published \"Madden NFL 19\" and had approved the competition, cooperated with the investigations.\n\nThe Sheriff's Office reported that the incident is being investigated as a criminal act and not as an act of terrorism.\n\nAs of August 30, at least one participant has filed a lawsuit against the tournament sponsor Electronic Arts, the game manufacturer, the mall, and the restaurant where the incident occurred. The lawsuit claims \"to hold those responsible accountable, and to ensure that gamers ... are able to get together to pursue their passion without having to fear for their lives\".\n\nParticipants and sponsors of participants took to social media to express safety, injuries, and recollections of the incident. Electronic Arts (EA) released a statement saying their \"most heartfelt sympathies\" went out to the families of the victims and those who were injured and that their focus was on those affected and aiding law enforcement. The publisher would later cancel the three remaining Madden Classic qualifier tournaments in order to reevaluate safety protocols for future live events. EA further donated as charity for the victims of the shooting and will set up a fund for others to be able to contribute.\n\nOrganizers of several video game-based exhibitions, including PAX, Game Developers Conference and Electronic Entertainment Expo, as well as other esports tournaments such as the League of Legends Championship Series and Evolution Championship Series (EVO) announced that they would take additional security measures at their upcoming events to protect the safety of their exhibitors and attendees in wake of the shooting. The event has also raised concern about increasing security at other esports events in the future to levels similarly seen in more professional sporting events.\n\nThe BBC initial coverage of the shooting compared it to other shootings in the state of Florida, including the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, the murders of Christina Grimmie, Trayvon Martin, and XXXTentacion, and the Orlando nightclub shooting. As the incident occurred 54 hours before the state polls closed in the gubernatorial primary elections, the political and gun law ramifications became political talking points.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump contacted Florida Governor Rick Scott, offering federal assistance in response to the shooting.\n\nVideo game developer Bungie issued a statement that all its \"Bungie and Destiny channels\" would observe a day of silence in memory of the victims on August 27, 2018. Bethesda, a major video game publisher, also issued its condolences, stating that they will \"support efforts from the @EA family however [they] can.\" OpTic Gaming announced shortly after that they will be holding a charity livestream on August 31, 2018, with all proceeds going towards the families of the victims. GLHF also hosted a vigil in front of the restaurant doors. Attendees left flowers, letters of condolence, and personal items at the front doors.\n"}
{"id": "34537118", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34537118", "title": "John Stromberg", "text": "John Stromberg\n\nJohn Stromberg (Prince Edward Island, Canada, 1853 - New York City, 1902), was an American songwriter, composer, and conductor born in Canada of Swedish ancestry (name originally \"Stramborg\"). He was best known for his work in collaboration with lyricist Edgar Smith on stage shows for the Weber and Fields comedy team.\n\nWeber and Fields began as a two-man show in the genre of ethnic (German) humor. They were a funny man/straight man comedy duo, a precursor to such famous acts as Abbott & Costello and Laurel & Hardy. They later expanded their act into the genre of vaudeville known as \"Burlesque\"—musical stage shows that broadly and somewhat raucously parodied other well-known contemporary Broadway shows, without the striptease acts with which the term was later associated.\n\nJohn \"Honey\" Stromberg, whose career began formally in Tin Pan Alley, where he worked as an arranger for the Witmark musical publishing house, was already the writer of a popular song hit (\"My Girl's a Corker, She's a New Yorker\") before becoming the principal composer and orchestra conductor (with Edgar Smith the principal writer) for these shows in 1896 with \"The Art of Maryland,\" with which Weber and Fields opened their Music Hall. Stromberg wrote the scores for ten productions, conducting nine of them. His most famous composition (the lyrics, however, credited to Robert B. Smith) was \"Come Down Ma Evenin' Star\" from \"Twirly Whirly,\" written for the great diva of the day Lillian Russell and (as the story goes) found in the pocket of Stromberg's coat after he had committed suicide in July 1902, having ingested Paris Green insecticide. Stromberg had suffered severely from debilitating (probably rheumatoid) arthritis for several years. Contributing heavily to his troubles was the failure of his investment in \"Stromberg Park,\" a real-estate development in Freeport, Long Island, with streets named after various Weber and Fields performers. He was greatly mourned on Broadway, and at his funeral the band struck up his famous \"Come Back Ma Honey Boy to Me.\" \n\"Come Down Ma Evenin' Star\"is the only song that Lillian Russell is known to have recorded. Stromberg also wrote \"Ma Blushin' Rosie\" (also sometimes called \"Rosie You Are My Posie\") which was part of the repertoire of the legendary Al Jolson, the theme song of the Rosemary Clooney TV variety show in the 1950s, and even performed in an Abbot and Costello film, The Naughty Nineties.\" He was one of the outstanding composers of the ragtime era, but his songs have been largely forgotten because most of the best ones were of the genre of so-called \"coon songs\"—the name itself contains a racial slur, and the genre consisted of songs containing the most blatant racial stereotypes expressed in a \"Negro dialect\" which makes them highly offensive to modern audiences. Although the offensive matter is entirely contained in Edgar Smith's lyrics, not in Stromberg's music, the music has suffered badly from \"guilt by association\" with the racist lyrics.\n\n"}

Snow has composed the music for all the franchise main releases (etc. television shows and films). Together with the show, the music was positively met by critics and viewers of the show alike. Snow has been nominated with over twenty awards and nominations for his music on the various franchise releases, but notably \"The X-Files\". Among the most famous compositions of the franchise is the theme song for \"The X-Files\". The theme was a top ten hit in the United Kingdom, peaking at number two on the UK Singles Chart.\n\nWith \"The X-Files\" peaking in popularity in the mid-to-late 1990s, the music did too. When the show was hitting its peak in popularity, Carter created a spin off to the series, entitled \"Millennium\" which aired from 1996–1999. While never gaining as much attention as \"The X-Files\", the show's theme song and soundtrack releases were well received by critics. \"The Lone Gunmen\" is the last television spin off of \"The X-Files\" which only aired for around two months. A soundtrack of the original music has been released in a set with music from Carter's other short lived Science Fiction series Harsh Realm. Snow returned to compose music for the franchise with the film, \"\".\n\nMark Snow got involved with \"The X-Files\", since he was a good friend of executive producer R.W. Goodwin. When the production staff was talking about who was going to take the composing duties for the series, Chris Carter didn't know who to ask, in total about \"10–15\" people were looked at. But Goodwin pressed for Snow being the show's composer. Snow auditioned around three times, but didn't get any signs from the production staff if they wanted him. One day, Snow's agent called talking about the pilot episode, and hinted that he had got the part. At first Snow wasn't sure if he wanted to work on \"The X-Files\", giving the reason that he felt they were \"weird\". So Snow eventually started to compose his music in Los Angeles, California, in which he would continue until the show's end.\n\nAt the start, Carter and the producers wanted Snow to heavily use synthesizers when composing his music, to sustain a \"type A atmosphere ambient sound design\". Snow had commented that after a while he got tired with this, and wanted to make a new musical direction for the show. He then started to do more \"musical\" work, such as creating more \"melodies\" for his songs. When composing the music for the show, the monster-of-the-week episodes, Snow got a lot more \"freedom\" when compared to the mytharc episodes which were much more \"traditional\" and conservative in its approach. Carter and the production crew gave Snow much freedom to compose his own music, rarely if ever giving him any notes on how he would record or compose his music for the series; when he was given notes they would be in a more basic form such as \"too much\" or \"too loud\", according to Snow.\n\nWhen creating the music for \"The X-Files\" film, Snow had a couple of months to write and to produce the music while he also created the music for the television show. The first film marked the first time the music for the franchise was composed and recorded with help from an orchestra. According to Snow, the recording and writing process didn't change during the making of the film. The biggest difference was that he used MIDI files to save his musical scores and pieces, which would go to a copyist who would take it through one of their programs and eventually give it to the orchestrators.\n\nThe sixth season episode \"The Unnatural\" marked the first time in the series that the show recorded the score with musicians rather than synthesizers. Slide guitar player Nick Kirgo and harmonica player Tommy Morgan assisted Snow with the score.\n\nFor the seventh season episode \"Closure\", Mark Snow's music was not used, being replaced by Moby's \"My Weakness\". Carter never told Snow about this change. While Snow has been confirmed to be more positive to it than negative, saying it fit \"perfect\", and further stating, \"Every once in a while, when Chris would pick out a pop song or whatever, he would always make really great choices and I thought that was a good one.\"\n\n\"Within\", the season eight premiere, was the first of six episodes to feature the song \"Scully's Theme\". The other five were \"Without\", \"Per Manum\", \"This Is Not Happening\", \"Deadalive\" and the season finale \"Existence\". The song features a solo female voice that repeats the distorted words \"We are near\" over and over. According to Carter, it is one of the greatest things that series composer Snow has ever done. Carter himself admitted to \"tweaking\" the song a little, adding the three words that are repeated over and over, with the idea to \"distort\" them.\n\nAfter \"The X-Files\" was cancelled in 2002, Chris Carter and his crew started working with a goal of releasing a second \"X-Files\" film. In 2003, Carter called Snow, who by that time lived in London, UK and said he wanted him to return for another film. Snow was positive to the idea, but filming got bogged down by contract issues between Fox and Carter. Once the contract issues were sorted out, Carter re-contacted Snow about the development and later on sent him the script for the film. Carter and his production crew wanted as much secrecy for the film as possible, forcing Snow to sign a contract when receiving the script. Snow wrote a couple of demos at the start, in which Carter and Frank Spotnitz were not to pleased about, but it eventually worked out when Snow re-recorded them.\n\nWhen composing the music for \"\", Snow said it was \"different\" from the previous film which followed the show's mytharc storyline about the government conspiracy with aliens. He said it was much \"more heart, warmth and tuneful music\" since this film was much more based around Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully's (Gillian Anderson) relationship.\n\nSnow recorded the score with the Hollywood Studio Symphony in May 2008 at the Newman Scoring Stage at 20th Century Fox in Century City, California. No music was written out during Snow's recording season with the symphony orchestra. When making the music, Snow used many instruments such as a \"battery of percussion\", taiko drums and whistle with live singers, among other things. It took four days to record and writing music for and with the orchestra. He used no trumpets and no high woodwinds when recording, but used up to eight french horns, five trombones, two piano, one harp, thirty-two violins, sixteen violas twelve cellos and eight basses.\n\nBritish performers UNKLE recorded a new version of the theme music for the end credits to the movie. Some of the unusual sounds were created by a variation of silly putty and dimes tucked in between and over the strings of the piano. Mark Snow also comments that the fast percussion featured in some tracks was inspired by the track 'Prospectors Quartet' from the \"There Will Be Blood\" soundtrack. UNKLE's song \"Broken\" was also included in the end credits.\n\nThe theme music for \"Millennium\" was created by Mark Snow. A popular belief amongst fans is that the theme song was inspired by Kylie Minogue's dance-pop song \"Confide In Me\". In reality, Chris Carter allegedly sent him a traditional Scottish céilidh song.\n\n\"The X-Files\" theme music went straight to #2 on March 30, 1996, on the UK Singles Chart and stayed there for three weeks, then kept on dropping. In France, the single entered the chart at #42 on April 6, 1996, climbed quickly until reaching #2 four weeks later. It remained blocked for five weeks at this position, behind Robert Miles's hit \"Children\", then topped the chart for a sole week, becoming the second instrumental number-one hit, before climbing. It totalled 1 weeks in the top ten and 30 weeks in the top 50. The single was re-charted from October 1998, but remained in low positions. It is the 754th best-selling single of all time in France.\n\n"}
{"id": "20295168", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20295168", "title": "Naturalism (theatre)", "text": "Naturalism (theatre)\n\nNaturalism is a movement in European drama and theatre that developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It refers to theatre that attempts to create an illusion of reality through a range of dramatic and theatrical strategies. Interest in naturalism especially flourished with the French playwrights of the time, but the most successful example is Strindberg’s play \"Miss Julie\", which was written with the intention to abide by both his own particular version of naturalism, and also the version described by the French novelist and literary theoretician, Émile Zola.\n\nZola’s term for naturalism is \"la nouvelle formule\". The three primary principles of naturalism (\"faire vrai, faire grand\" and \"faire simple\") are first, that the play should be realistic, and the result of a careful study of human behaviour and psychology. The characters should be flesh and blood; their motivations and actions should be grounded in their heredity and environment. The presentation of a naturalistic play, in terms of the setting and performances, should be realistic and not flamboyant or theatrical. The single setting of \"Miss Julie\", for example, is a kitchen. Second, the conflicts in the play should be issues of meaningful, life-altering significance — not small or petty. And third, the play should be simple — not cluttered with complicated sub-plots or lengthy expositions.\n\nDarwinian understandings pervade naturalistic plays, especially in the determining role of the environment on character, and as motivation for behavior. Naturalism emphasizes everyday speech forms, plausibility in the writing, (no ghosts, spirits or gods intervening in the human action), a choice of subjects that are contemporary and reasonable (no exotic, otherworldly or fantastic locales, nor historical or mythic time-periods); an extension of the social range of characters portrayed (not only the aristocrats of classical drama, to include bourgeois and working-class protagonists) and social conflicts; and a style of acting that attempts to recreate the impression of reality.\n\nNaturalism was first advocated explicitly by Émile Zola in his 1880 essay entitled \"Naturalism on the Stage\".\n\nNaturalistic writers were influenced by the theory of evolution of Charles Darwin. They believed that one's heredity and social environment determine one's character. Whereas realism seeks only to describe subjects as they really are, naturalism also attempts to determine \"scientifically\" the underlying forces (i.e. the environment or heredity) influencing the actions of its subjects. Naturalistic works are opposed to romanticism, in which subjects may receive highly symbolic, idealistic, or even supernatural treatment. They often include uncouth or sordid subject matter; for example, Émile Zola's works had a frankness about sexuality along with a pervasive pessimism. Naturalistic works exposed the dark harshness of life, including poverty, racism, sex, prejudice, disease, prostitution, and filth. As a result, Naturalistic writers were frequently criticized for being too blunt.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "101733", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=101733", "title": "Pay-per-view", "text": "Pay-per-view\n\nPay-per-view (PPV) is a type of pay television service by which a subscriber of a television service provider can purchase events to view via private telecast. The broadcaster shows the event at the same time to everyone ordering it (as opposed to video-on-demand systems, which allow viewers to see recorded broadcasts at any time). Events can be purchased using an on-screen guide, an automated telephone system, or through a live customer service representative. Events often include feature films, sporting events, and other entertainment programs. With the rise of the Internet, the term Internet pay-per-view (iPPV) has been used to describe pay-per-view services accessed online. PPV is most commonly used to distribute combat sports events, such as boxing and mixed martial arts, and sports entertainment such as professional wrestling.\n\nThe earliest form of pay-per-view was closed-circuit television, also known as theatre television, where professional boxing telecasts were broadcast live to a select number of venues, mostly theaters, where viewers paid for tickets to watch the fight live. The first fight with a closed-circuit telecast was Joe Louis vs. Jersey Joe Walcott in 1948. Closed-circuit telecasts peaked in popularity with Muhammad Ali in the 1960s and 1970s, with \"The Rumble in the Jungle\" fight drawing 50million buys worldwide in 1974, and the \"Thrilla in Manila\" drawing 100million buys worldwide in 1975. Closed-circuit television was gradually replaced by pay-per-view home television in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nThe Zenith Phonevision system became the first home pay-per-view system to be tested in the United States. Developed in 1951, it used telephone lines to take and receive orders, as well as to descramble a television broadcast signal. The field tests conducted for Phonevision lasted for 90 days and were tested in Chicago, Illinois. The system used IBM punch cards to descramble a signal broadcast during the broadcast station's \"off-time\". Both systems showed promise, but the Federal Communications Commission denied them the permits to operate.\n\nOne of the earliest pay-per-view systems on cable television, the Optical Systems-developed Channel 100, first began service in 1972 in San Diego, California through Mission Cable (which was later acquired by Cox Communications) and TheaterVisioN, which operated out of Sarasota, Florida. These early systems quickly went out of business, as the cable industry adopted satellite technology and as flat-rate pay television services such as Home Box Office (HBO) became popular.\n\nWhile most pay-per-view services were delivered via cable, there were a few over-the-air pay TV stations that offered pay-per-view broadcasts in addition to regularly scheduled broadcasts of movies and other entertainment. These stations, which operated for a few years in Chicago, Los Angeles and some other cities, broadcast \"scrambled\" signals that required descrambler devices to convert the signal into standard broadcast format. These services were marketed as \"ON-TV.\"\n\nThe first home pay-per-view cable television broadcast was the Floyd Patterson vs. Ingemar Johansson rematch in 1960, when 25,000 TelePrompTer subscribers mailed $2 to watch Patterson regain the heavyweight title. The third PattersonJohansson match in 1961 was later viewed by 100,000 paid cable subscribers. Muhammad Ali had several fights on early pay-per-view home television, including Cassius Clay vs. Doug Jones in 1963, and Muhammad Ali vs. Sonny Liston which drew 250,000 buys on cable television in 1964.\n\nProfessional boxing was largely introduced to pay-per-view cable television with the \"Thrilla in Manila\" fight between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier in September 1975. The fight sold 500,000 pay-per-view buys on HBO. There was also another major title fight aired on pay-per-view in 1980, when Roberto Durán defeated Sugar Ray Leonard. Cable companies offered the match for $10, and about 155,000 customers paid to watch the fight.\n\nA major pay-per-view event occurred on September 16, 1981, when Sugar Ray Leonard fought Thomas \"Hitman\" Hearns for the World Welterweight Championship. Viacom Cablevision in Nashville, Tennessee – the first system to offer the event – saw over 50 percent of its subscriber base purchase the fight. Leonard visited Nashville to promote the fight, and the event proved such a success that Viacom themed its annual report for that year around it. Viacom marketing director Pat Thompson put together the fight, and subsequently put together additional PPV fights, wrestling matches, and even a televised Broadway play.\n\nAfter leaving Viacom, Thompson became head of Sports View and produced the first pay-per-view football game on October 16, 1983, a college football game between the University of Tennessee and the University of Alabama from Birmingham, Alabama. Sports View played a role in building pay-per-view networks, and became the early pioneer in developing TigerVision for Louisiana State University, TideVision for Alabama and UT Vol Seat for Tennessee. Sports View also produced the Ohio State-Michigan football game for pay-per-view in November 1983.\n\nIn 1985, the first pay-per-view cable channels in the United States – Viewer's Choice (now In Demand), Cable Video Store, First Choice and Request TV – began operation within days of each other. Viewer's Choice serviced both home satellite dish and cable customers, while Request TV, though broadcasting to cable viewers, would not become available to satellite subscribers until the 1990s. First Choice PPV was available on Rogers Cablesystems in the United States and Canada. After Paragon Cable acquired the Rogers Cablesystems franchise in San Antonio, Texas, First Choice continued to be carried until Time Warner Cable bought Paragon in 1996. In the United States, pay-per-view broadcasters transmit without advertisements, similar to conventional flat-rate pay television services.\n\nThe term \"pay-per-view\" did not come into general use until the late 1980s when companies such as Viewer's Choice, HBO and Showtime started using the system to show movies and some of their productions. Viewer's Choice carried movies, concerts and other events, with live sporting events such as WrestleMania being the most predominant programming. Prices ranged from $3.99 to $49.99, while HBO and Showtime, with their event production legs TVKO and SET Pay Per View, would offer championship boxing matches ranging from $14.99 to $54.99.\n\nESPN later began to televise college football and basketball games on pay-per-view through its services ESPN GamePlan and ESPN Full Court, which were eventually sold as full-time out-of-market sports packages. The boxing undercard \"Latin Fury\", shown on June 28, 2003, became ESPN's first boxing card on pay-per-view and also the first pay-per-view boxing card held in Puerto Rico. Pay-per-view has provided a revenue stream for professional wrestling circuits such as WWE, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), Ring of Honor (ROH) and Lucha Libre AAA World Wide (AAA).\n\nWWE chairman and chief executive officer Vince McMahon is considered by many as one of the icons of pay-per-view promotion. McMahon owns the domain name payperview.com, which redirects to the WWE Network website.\n\nIn 2006, HBO generated 3.7 million pay-per-view buys with $177 million in gross sales. The only year with more buys previously, 1999, had a total of 4 million. The former record fell in 2007 when HBO sold 4.8 million PPV buys with $255 million in sales. In 2014, HBO generated 59.3 million buys and $3.1 billion in revenue since its 1991 debut with Evander Holyfield-George Foreman.\n\n1999 differed radically from 2006: 1999 saw four major fight cards: De La Hoya-Trinidad (1.4 million buys), Holyfield-Lewis I (1.2 million), Holyfield-Lewis II (850,000) and De La Hoya-Quartey (570,000). By contrast, only one pay-per-view mega-fight took place in 2006: De La Hoya-Mayorga (925,000 buys). Rahman-Maskaev bombed with under 50,000. The other eight PPV cards that year all fell in the 325,000–450,000 range. Pay-per-view fights in that range almost always generate more money for the promoter and fighters than HBO wants to pay for an HBO World Championship Boxing license-fee.\n\nIn May 2007, the super-welterweight boxing match between Oscar De La Hoya vs. Floyd Mayweather Jr. on HBO PPV became the biggest-selling non-heavyweight title fight, with a little more than 2.5 million buyers. The fight itself generated roughly in domestic PPV revenue, making it the most lucrative prizefight of that era. The record stood until 2015 before it was broken by Floyd Mayweather, Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao in a fight dubbed as the \"Fight of the Century\" on May 2, 2015 which generated 4.6 million ppv buys and a revenue of over $400 million.\n\nThe leading PPV attraction, Floyd Mayweather Jr. has generated approximately 24.8 million buys and $1.3 billion in revenue. Manny Pacquiao, ranked second, has generated approximately 19.2 million buys and $1.2 billion in revenue. Oscar De La Hoya, has \"sold\" approximately 14 million units in total, giving $700 million in domestic television receipts and stands third. In fourth place in buys, Evander Holyfield has achieved 12.6 million units ($550 million); and at fifth, Mike Tyson has reached 12.4 million units ($545 million).\n\nRoss Greenburg, then president of HBO Sports, called the expansion of pay-per-view \"the biggest economic issue in boxing\", stating \"I can't tell you that pay-per-view helps the sport because it doesn't. It hurts the sport because it narrows our audience, but it's a fact of life. Every time we try to make an HBO World Championship Boxing fight, we're up against mythical pay-per-view numbers. HBO doesn't make a lot of money from pay-per-view. There's usually a cap on what we can make. But the promoters and fighters insist on pay-per-view because that's where their greatest profits lie.\"\n\n\"It's a big problem,\" Greenburg continues. \"It's getting harder and harder to put fighters like Manny Pacquiao on HBO World Championship Boxing. If Floyd Mayweather beats Oscar, he might never fight on HBO World Championship Boxing again. But if HBO stopped doing pay-per-view, the promoters would simply do it on their own [like Bob Arum did with Cotto-Malignaggi in June 2006] or find someone else who will do it for them.\"\n\nFormer HBO Sports President Seth Abraham concurs, saying, \"I think, if Lou (DiBella) and I were still at HBO, we'd be in the same pickle as far as the exodus of fights to pay-per-view is concerned.\"\n\nUltimate Fighting Championship (UFC), a relative newcomer on the pay-per-view scene, matched the once-dominant World Wrestling Entertainment Inc. in pay-per-view revenues during 2006 and surpassed boxing titan HBO. The three companies make up the bulk of the pay-per-view business. According to Deana Myers, a senior analyst at Kagan Research LLC (which tracks the PPV industry), \"UFC has reinvigorated the pay-per-view category.\"\n\nProfessional wrestling has a long history of running pay-per-view events. WWE (then WWF) launched its first pay-per-view event in 1985 with The Wrestling Classic and has run numerous others throughout the years. Other major organisations such as WCW, ECW and TNA have also run pay-per-view events.\n\nAlthough it still offers its events via traditional pay-per-view outlets, since 2014 WWE has offered all of its PPV events at no additional charge as part of a subscription-based streaming service known as WWE Network—which features on-demand access to library content and other exclusive programming. Following WrestleMania 34, the service had 2.12 million subscribers.\n\nIn 2015, with the the pay-per-view set a new record for a music event with more than 400,000 subscriptions, surpassing a 1999 simulcast by the Backstreet Boys which drew 160,000 subscriptions.\n\nViewers in the United Kingdom and Ireland can access pay-per-view via satellite, cable and over-the-internet television services, mainly for films, boxing and American professional wrestling via services such as Sky Box Office and more recently ITV Box Office and BT Sport Box Office. The last couple of years has seen the number of pay-per-view boxing events significantly increase and currently all of the UK's top fights are only available via pay-per-view. Broadcasters (most notably PremPlus) have abandoned their aspirations to introduce PPV into other sports market due to poor take-up.\n\nIn Canada, most specialty television providers provide pay-per-view programming through one or more services. In all cases, prices typically range from around C$4.99 (for movies) up to $50 or more for special events.\n\nInitially, there were three major PPV providers in Canada; Viewers Choice Canada operated in Eastern Canada as a joint venture of Astral Media, Rogers Communications, and TSN, while Western International Communications operated a separate service also branded as Viewers Choice, which used the brand under licence after previously operating as Home Theatre.\n\nViewers Choice Canada was a partner in a French-language PPV service known as Canal Indigo, which is now entirely owned by Videotron. Bell Canada also launched a PPV service for its ExpressVu television provider known as Vu! in 1999.\n\nHome Theatre was later acquired by Shaw Communications; after gaining permission to operate nationally, it re-branded as a white-label PPV known internally as Shaw PPV in December 2007. In 2014, due to Bell Media's majority ownership of Viewers Choice because of its acquisition of Astral, and because both Bell and Rogers now ran their own in-house PPV operations (Vu! and Sportsnet PPV), Viewers Choice was shut down.\n\nIn Romania, cable communications operator UPC Romania has notified the National Audiovisual Council (CNA) on the intention to introduce in January, February 2014 at the latest, an on-demand audiovisual media service called Agerpres. According to the manager of UPC Romania-owned Smaranda Radoi UPC, will allow customers to watch movies on demand or live events; as well as broadcasts of performances, concerts and sporting events.\n\nIn November 2008, pay-per-view made its debut in Albania through Digitalb on terrestrial and satellite television, with the channel DigiGold.\n\nIn France, launched in the late 1990s, Canalsat (Ciné+) and TPS (Multivision) operate their own pay-per-view service. While CanalSat holds the rights to live soccer matches for France's Ligue 1, TPS had the rights for Boxe matches. In 2007, Multivision service ceased by the end of TPS service which merged with Canalsat. Nowadays, Ciné+ is the only existing pay-per-view service in France.\n\nIn Croatia, Fight Channel is broadcasting martial arts events organized by the world's most prominent fighting organizations, such as the UFC, K-1, HBO Boxing, Dream, Glory WS, World Series of Boxing etc. and its pay-per-view service covers the Balkans region.\n\nPer nations with Pay-Per-View or PPV system in South América:\n\nIn Argentina, Torneos y Competencias is a producer and sports events organization that broadcasts live main matches of Argentine Soccer in four categories on TyC Sports and TyC Max\n\nIn Brazil, in the soccer main matches of Serie A (Six games per matchday) and Serie B (Four games per matchday) in two categories of Brazilian Soccer are broadcast live on Premiere FC and SporTV.

Foxtel had Event TV (until it transformed into its current form; Main Event) while, Optus Vision had Main Attraction Pay-Per-View as its provider. As of 2005, Main Event is the current pay-per-view provider through Foxtel and Optus cable/satellite subscription.\n\nSky Pacific started a service in Fiji in 2005 and then expanded into American Samoa, Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati (East), Nauru, New Caledonia, Niue, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu, with one, out of their 25 channels, being Pay-Per-View.\n\nNetflix is available in Australia.\n\nIn Malaysia, Astro's \"Astro Box Office\" service launched in 2000 in the form of the free-to-air \"Astro Showcase\".\n\nIn Japan, SkyPerfecTV subscribers can receive one-click pay-per-view access to hundreds of channels supplying domestic and international sporting events (including WWE events), movies, and specialty programming, either live or later on continuous repeat on its channel.\n\nIn India a pay-per-view service operates; however, pay-per-view sports broadcasts are available.Now also live events like wwe. \n\nThe following is a list of boxing fights that have generated over 1million pay-per-view buys worldwide.

{"id": "25079", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25079", "title": "Pet", "text": "Pet\n\nA pet or companion animal is an animal kept primarily for a person's company, protection, or entertainment rather than as a working animal, livestock, or laboratory animal. Popular pets are often noted for their attractive appearances, intelligence, and relatable personalities.\n\nTwo of the most popular pets are dogs and cats. A cat lover is known as an ailurophile and a dog lover is known as a cynophile. Other animals commonly kept include: rabbits, ferrets, pigs; rodents, such as gerbils, hamsters, chinchillas, rats, and guinea pigs; avian pets, such as parrots, passerines, and fowl; reptile pets, such as turtles, lizards and snakes; aquatic pets, such as fish, freshwater and saltwater snails, and frogs; and arthropod pets, such as tarantulas and hermit crabs. Small pets may be grouped together as pocket pets, while the equine and bovine group include the largest companion animals.\n\nPets provide their owners (or \"guardians\") both physical and emotional benefits. Walking a dog can provide both the human and the dog with exercise, fresh air, and social interaction. Pets can give companionship to people who are living alone or elderly adults who do not have adequate social interaction with other people. There is a medically approved class of therapy animals, mostly dogs or cats, that are brought to visit confined humans, such as children in hospitals or elders in nursing homes. Pet therapy utilizes trained animals and handlers to achieve specific physical, social, cognitive or emotional goals with patients.\n\nSome scholars, ethicists and animal rights organizations have raised concerns over keeping pets because of the lack of autonomy and objectification of nonhuman animals.\n\nThere are approximately 86.4 million pet cats and approximately 78.2 million pet dogs in the United States, and a United States 2007–2008 survey showed that dog-owning households outnumbered those owning cats, but that the total number of pet cats was higher than that of dogs. The same was true for 2011. In 2013, pets outnumbered children four to one in the United States.\n\nFor a small to medium-size dog, the total cost over a dog's lifetime is about $7,240 to $12,700. For an indoor cat, the total cost over a cat's lifetime is about $8,620 to $11,275. People most commonly get pets for companionship, to protect a home or property, or because of the beauty or attractiveness of the animals. The most common reasons for not owning a pet are lack of time, lack of suitable housing, and lack of ability to care for the pet when traveling.\n\nAccording to the 2007-2008 Pet Owners survey:\nThe latest survey done by Colin Siren of Ipsos Reid estimates that there are 7.9 million cats and 5.9 million dogs in Canada. The survey also shows that 35% of Canadian households have a dog, while 38% have a cat, which is consistent with other surveys conducted around the world.\n\nIn China, spending on domestic animals has grown from and estimated $3.12 billion in 2010 to $25 billion in 2018. The Chinese people own 51 million dogs and 41 million cats, with pet owners often preferring to source pet food internationally.\n\nA 2007 survey by the University of Bristol found that 26% of UK households owned cats and 31% owned dogs, estimating total domestic populations of approximately 10.3 million cats and 10.5 million dogs in 2006. The survey also found that 47.2% of households with a cat had at least one person educated to degree level, compared with 38.4% of homes with dogs.\n\nAccording to a survey promoted by Italian family associations in 2009, it is estimated that there are approximately 45 million pets in Italy. This includes 7 million dogs, 7.5 million cats, 16 million fish, 12 million birds, and 10 million snakes.\n\nKeeping animals as pets may be detrimental to their health if certain requirements are not met. An important issue is inappropriate feeding, which may produce clinical effects. The consumption of chocolate or grapes by dogs, for example, may prove fatal.\n\nCertain species of houseplants can also prove toxic if consumed by pets. Examples include philodendrons and Easter lilies (which can cause severe kidney damage to cats) and poinsettias, begonia, and aloe vera (which can sicken or, in extreme cases, kill dogs).\n\nHousepets, particularly dogs and cats in industrialized societies, are also highly susceptible to obesity. Overweight pets have been shown to be at a higher risk of developing diabetes, liver problems, joint pain, kidney failure, and cancer. Lack of exercise and high-caloric diets are considered to be the primary contributors to pet obesity.\n\nIt is widely believed among the public, and among many scientists, that pets probably bring mental and physical health benefits to their owners; a 1987 NIH statement cautiously argued that existing data was \"suggestive\" of a significant benefit. A recent dissent comes from a 2017 RAND study, which found that at least in the case of children, having a pet \"per se\" failed to improve physical or mental health by a statistically significant amount; instead, the study found children who were already prone to be more healthy (such as white children living in homes rather than apartments) were more likely to get pets in the first place. Unfortunately, conducting long-term randomized trials to settle the issue would be costly or infeasible.\n\nPets might have the ability to stimulate their caregivers, in particular the elderly, giving people someone to take care of, someone to exercise with, and someone to help them heal from a physically or psychologically troubled past. Animal company can also help people to preserve acceptable levels of happiness despite the presence of mood symptoms like anxiety or depression. Having a pet may also help people achieve health goals, such as lowered blood pressure, or mental goals, such as decreased stress. There is evidence that having a pet can help a person lead a longer, healthier life. In a 1986 study of 92 people hospitalized for coronary ailments, within a year 11 of the 29 patients without pets had died, compared to only 3 of the 52 patients who had pets. Having pet(s) was shown to significantly reduce triglycerides, and thus heart disease risk, in the elderly. A study by the National Institute of Health found that people who owned dogs were less likely to die as a result of a heart attack than those who didn’t own one. There is some evidence that pets may have a therapeutic effect in dementia cases. Other studies have shown that for the elderly, good health may be a requirement for having a pet, and not a result. Dogs trained to be guide dogs can help people with vision impairment. Dogs trained in the field of Animal-Assisted Therapy (AAT) can also benefit people with other disabilities.\n\nPeople residing in a long-term care facility, such as a hospice or nursing home, may experience health benefits from pets. Pets help them to cope with the emotional issues related to their illness. They also offer physical contact with another living creature, something that is often missing in an elder's life. Pets for nursing homes are chosen based on the size of the pet, the amount of care that the breed needs, and the population and size of the care institution. Appropriate pets go through a screening process and, if it is a dog, additional training programs to become a therapy dog. There are three types of therapy dogs: facility therapy dogs, animal-assisted therapy dogs, and therapeutic visitation dogs. The most common therapy dogs are therapeutic visitation dogs. These dogs are household pets whose handlers take time to visit hospitals, nursing homes, detention facilities, and rehabilitation facilities. Different pets require varying amounts of attention and care; for example, cats may have lower maintenance requirements than dogs.\n\nIn addition to providing health benefits for their owners, pets also impact the social lives of their owners and their connection to their community. There is some evidence that pets can facilitate social interaction. Assistant Professor of Sociology at the University of Colorado at Boulder, Leslie Irvine has focused her attention on pets of the homeless population. Her studies of pet ownership among the homeless found that many modify their life activities for fear of losing their pets. Pet ownership prompts them to act responsibly, with many making a deliberate choice not to drink or use drugs, and to avoid contact with substance abusers or those involved in any criminal activity for fear of being separated from their pet. Additionally, many refuse to house in shelters if their pet is not allowed to stay with them.\n\nHealth risks that are associated with pets include:\n\nStates, cities, and towns in Western nations commonly enact local ordinances to limit the number or kind of pets a person may keep personally or for business purposes. Prohibited pets may be specific to certain breeds (such as pit bulls or Rottweilers), they may apply to general categories of animals (such as livestock, exotic animals, wild animals, and canid or felid hybrids), or they may simply be based on the animal's size. Additional or different maintenance rules and regulations may also apply. Condominium associations and owners of rental properties also commonly limit or forbid tenants' keeping of pets.\n\nThe keeping of animals as pets can cause concerns with regard to animal rights and welfare. Pets have commonly been considered private property, owned by individual persons. However, many legal protections have existed (historically and today) with the intention of safeguarding pets' (and other animals') well-being. Since the year 2000, a small but increasing number of jurisdictions in North America have enacted laws redefining pet's \"owners\" as \"guardians\". Intentions have been characterized as simply changing attitudes and perceptions (but not legal consequences) to working toward legal personhood for pets themselves. Some veterinarians and breeders have opposed these moves. The question of pets' legal status can arise with concern to purchase or adoption, custody, divorce, estate and inheritance, injury, damage, and veterinary malpractice.\n\nPets have a considerable environmental impact, especially in countries where they are common or held in high densities. For instance, the 163 million dogs and cats kept in the United States consume about 20% of the amount of dietary energy that humans do and an estimated 33% of the animal-derived energy. They produce about 30% ± 13%, by mass, as much feces as Americans, and through their diet, constitute about 25–30% of the environmental impacts from animal production in terms of the use of land, water, fossil fuel, phosphate, and biocides. Dog and cat animal product consumption is responsible for the release of up to 64 ± 16 million tons CO-equivalent methane and nitrous oxide, two powerful greenhouse gasses. Americans are the largest pet owners in the world, but pet ownership in the US has considerable environmental costs.\n\nWhile many people have kept many different species of animals in captivity over the course of human history, only a relative few have been kept long enough to be considered domesticated. Other types of animals, notably monkeys, have never been domesticated but are still sold and kept as pets. There are also inanimate objects that have been kept as \"pets\", either as a form of a game or humorously (e.g. the Pet Rock or Chia Pet).\n\nDomesticated pets are the most common types of pet. A \"domesticated animal\" is any animal that has been tamed and made fit for a human environment by being consistently kept in captivity and selectively bred over a long enough period of time that it exhibits marked differences in behavior and appearance from its wild relatives.\n\n\n\n\n\nWild animals are kept as pets. The term “wild” in this context specifically applies to any species of animal which has not undergone a fundamental change in behavior to facilitate a close co-existence with humans. Some species listed here may have been bred in captivity for a considerable length of time, but are still not recognized as domesticated. \n\nGenerally, wild animals are recognized as not suitable to keep as pets, and this practice is completely banned in many places. In other areas, certain species are allowed to be kept, and it is usually required for the owner to obtain a permit. It is considered animal cruelty by some, as most often, wild animals require precise and constant care that is very difficult to meet in captive conditions. Many large and instinctively aggressive animals are extremely dangerous, and numerous times have they killed their handlers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArchaeology suggests that dogs as pets may date back to at least 12,000 years ago.\n\nThroughout the seventeenth and eighteenth-century pet keeping in the modern sense gradually became accepted throughout Britain. Initially, aristocrats kept dogs for both companionship and hunting. Thus, pet keeping was a sign of elitism within society. By the nineteenth century, the rise of the middle class stimulated the development of pet keeping and it became inscribed within the bourgeois culture.\n\nAs the popularity of pet-keeping in the modern sense rose during the Victorian era, animals became a fixture within urban culture as commodities and decorative objects. Pet keeping generated a commercial opportunity for entrepreneurs. By the mid-nineteenth century, nearly twenty thousand street vendors in London dealt with live animals. Also, the popularity of animals developed a demand for animal goods such as accessories and guides for pet keeping. Pet care developed into a big business by the end of the nineteenth century.\n\nProfiteers also sought out pet stealing as a means for economic gain. Utilizing the affection owner’s had for their pets, professional dog stealers would capture animals and hold them for ransom. The development of dog stealing reflects the increased value of pets. Pets gradually became defined as the property of their owners. Laws were created that punished offenders for their burglary.\n\nPets and animals also had social and cultural implications throughout the nineteenth century. The categorization of dogs by their breeds reflected the hierarchical, social order of the Victorian era. The pedigree of a dog represented the high status and lineage of their owners and reinforced social stratification. Middle-class owners, however, valued the ability to associate with the upper-class through ownership of their pets. The ability to care for a pet signified respectability and the capability to be self-sufficient. According to Harriet Ritvo, the identification of “elite animal and elite owner was not a confirmation of the owner’s status but a way of redefining it.”\n\nThe popularity of dog and pet keeping generated animal fancy. Dog fanciers showed enthusiasm for owning pets, breeding dogs, and showing dogs in various shows. The first dog show took place on 28 June 1859 in Newcastle and focused mostly on sporting and hunting dogs. However, pet owners produced an eagerness to demonstrate their pets as well as have an outlet to compete. Thus, pet animals gradually were included within dog shows. The first large show, which would host one thousand entries, took place in Chelsea in 1863. The Kennel Club was created in 1873 to ensure fairness and organization within dog shows. The development of the \"Stud Book\" by the Kennel Club defined policies, presented a national registry system of purebred dogs, and essentially institutionalized dog shows.\n\n\n\n"}

Human trafficking and Child prostitution are problems in the country. Prostitutes are known locally as \"motyo\". UNAIDS estimate there to be 2,228 prostitutes in the country.\n\nAlthough prostitution is illegal, the country issues temporary work permits to migrant prostitutes travelling through Suriname en-route to another country.\n\nProstitutes often rent rooms in hotels and attract clients in the hotel's bar or outside the hotel.\n\nProstitution is generally tolerated and the laws forbidding it are not enforced. Laws that tend to be enforced, at least to some degree, are those prohibiting human trafficking, child prostitution and soliciting outside unofficially tolerated areas.\n\nBrothels are usually tolerated unless there is trouble or if women are working there against their will. Police regularly visit the brothels and may act as intermediaries in disputes between the prostitutes and brothel owners. The police sometimes work as 'advisors' to the brothels and assist in getting work visas for the women.\n\nIn the capital Paramaribo, the red-light district is located in the area of Watermolenstraat, Timmermanstraat, Hoek Hogestraat, Zwartenhovenbrugstraat and Crommelinstraat. These streets are known for their street walkers. The sex workers, mainly from Guyana are fully visible and practice their work relatively undisturbed.\n\nIn the interior of Suriname there are a number of official and unofficial gold mines. A lot of men work at the mines, especially Brazilians. In the mining areas there are a large number of prostitutes to service the needs of the miners. There are many foreign women who come to work in the gold fields (Brazilians, Dominicans, Guyanese and French) and well as native Surinamese prostitutes. Brazilian prostitutes can earn three times the amount in the mining area than they can at home. Some women will take payment in gold nuggets. There is evidence of Child prostitution in the area.\n\nProstitutes generally live in \"women's camps\", a series of huts, near the mining camps where the women live and receive their clients. There are also some bars around the mining camps, the prostitutes in these bars are generally recruited and employed by the owner. Some miners have a prostitute as a \"temporary wives\" for a period of 3 months. The women look after the miner's domestic needs as well as their sexual ones. This arrangement is usually made through a mining foreman who recruits and pays women from Brazil in return for 10% of the miner's wages.\n\nIn 2011, the government introduced a scheme to register all workers in the mining areas, including sex workers. The object was to enable the government to collect taxes from the workers.\n\nSuriname is principally a destination and transit country for men, women, and children trafficked transnationally for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor. It is also a source country for underage Surinamese girls, and increasingly boys, trafficked internally for sexual exploitation. Some of these children are trafficked into the sex trade surrounding gold mining camps in the country’s interior. Foreign girls and women from Guyana, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, and Colombia are trafficked into Suriname for commercial sexual exploitation; some transit Suriname en route to Europe.\n\nThe United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Suriname as a 'Tier 2 Watch List' country.\n\n"}
{"id": "32903764", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32903764", "title": "Ready Player One", "text": "Ready Player One\n\nReady Player One is a 2011 science fiction novel, and the debut novel of American author Ernest Cline. The story, set in a dystopia in 2044, follows protagonist Wade Watts on his search for an Easter egg in a worldwide virtual reality game, the discovery of which will lead him to inherit the game creator's fortune. Cline sold the rights to publish the novel in June 2010, in a bidding war to the Crown Publishing Group (a division of Random House). The book was published on August 16, 2011. An audiobook was released the same day; it was narrated by Wil Wheaton, who was mentioned briefly in one of the chapters. In 2012, the book received an Alex Award from the Young Adult Library Services Association division of the American Library Association and won the 2012 Prometheus Award.\n\nA film adaptation, screenwritten by Cline and Zak Penn and directed by Steven Spielberg, was released on March 29, 2018.\n\nIn the 2040s, the world has been gripped by an energy crisis from the depletion of fossil fuels and the consequences of global warming and overpopulation, causing widespread social problems and economic stagnation. To escape the decline their world is facing, people turn to the OASIS, a virtual reality simulator accessible by players using visors and haptic technology such as gloves. It functions both as an MMORPG and as a virtual world, with its currency being the most stable in the real world. It was created by James Halliday who, when he died, had announced in his will to the public that he had left an Easter egg inside OASIS, and the first person to find it would inherit his entire fortune and the corporation. The story follows the adventures of Wade Watts, starting about five years after the announcement, when he discovers one of the three keys pointing to the treasure.\n\nTeenager Wade Watts lives with his aunt in Oklahoma City in the \"stacks\", a poverty-stricken district constructed of trailer homes piled on top of each other. He spends his spare time as a \"gunter\" (\"egg hunter\"), logging on to the OASIS as an avatar under the moniker Parzival, reading Halliday's journal \"Anorak's Almanac\", and researching details of the 1980s pop culture, mainly classic video games and movies, that Halliday loved. One day, he realizes that the first key is located on Ludus, the same virtual world as his own online high school, in a re-creation of the \"Dungeons & Dragons\" module \"Tomb of Horrors\". He meets Art3mis, a famous female gunter and blogger who has been exploring the place, and advances further than she does when he defeats the AI Acererak at the video game \"Joust\". He is awarded the Copper Key, and Parzival appears on the \"Scoreboard\", attracting the world's attention.\n\nParzival completes the gate's puzzles by teleporting to planet Middletown, playing through the \"Dungeons of Daggorath\" video game in a recreation of Halliday's parents's house and then role-playing Matthew Broderick's character in the film \"WarGames\". Art3mis clears the gate shortly afterwards, as does Wade's friend Aech. Wade’s fame enables him to make a living by endorsing virtual products. It also brings him to the attention of Nolan Sorrento, head of operations at Innovative Online Industries (IOI), a multinational corporation bent on a well-funded effort to find the Easter egg in order to take control of the OASIS and monetize it. When Wade refuses to join IOI, Sorrento attempts to kill him by blowing up the stacks where Wade lives, killing his aunt and disguising the explosion as a meth lab accident.\n\nWade escapes and moves to Columbus, Ohio, where he lies low, assuming the pseudonym Bryce Lynch and living in an anonymous apartment designed for hardcore OASIS users. He considers an alliance with Aech, Art3mis, and Daito and Shoto, two Japanese gunters who have also earned the Copper Key. Instead, he and Art3mis begin a wary friendship, but when he asks her out, Art3mis declines. IOI operatives, called Sixers, attempt to assassinate Wade and Art3mis at the birthday party of OASIS co-founder Ogden Morrow. They are stopped by Morrow, who has special privileges and powers within the OASIS. Art3mis abandons Wade due to the competition being more personal for her. Five months pass. Neither Wade nor anyone else has found the next token, the Jade Key.\n\nWhen Art3mis finds the Jade Key, Parzival scrambles to planet Archaide, where he plays a perfect game of \"Pac-Man\", receiving only a quarter as a prize. Aech provides a hint leading him to the planet Frobozz where he solves the text adventure game \"Zork\". Sorrento, who had tracked Art3mis and Aech using a premium locator artifact, establishes a base there to farm their company's avatars with keys, and unlocks the second Gate and acquires the Jade Key. Shoto tells Parzival that the Sixers infiltrated Daito's real-life apartment and threw him out of the building, killing him.\n\nParzival unlocks the Jade Gate, a Voight-Kampff machine by entering a privately-owned \"Blade Runner\"-themed bulding, and completes the arcade game \"Black Tiger\" as a character from the first-person shooter perspective, being given a virtual mecha as the prize and another clue: a red star in a circle. Using his knowledge of Rush, he acquires the Crystal Key on planet Syrinx (the red star being the symbol of the Solar Federation in the song \"2112\"), and after playing \"Discovery\", the third movement of the song, finds a clue regarding the conditions to unlock the final gate. As he messages Art3mis, Aech, and Shoto with his solution, Sorrento ends their covert attempts to clear the third gate, Castle Anorak on planet Chthonia, and places a force field around it.\n\nWade manipulates his assumed identity in order to be arrested and placed in indentured servitude in IOI's tech support department. While inside IOI, he uses black market passwords and security exploits to hack into IOI's intranet: he acquires a wealth of information, including footage of Daito's murder. The information also includes the attempt on his own life, as well as plans to force Shoto and Art3mis to work for IOI in real life, and kill them at the end of the contest (IOI doesn't know who Aech is due to him using a pseudonym). After escaping the corporation, he shares his information with his friends and publicizes a gathering of avatars to storm the castle. They are interrupted by Ogden Morrow, who offers them a safe haven at his home in Oregon. Wade meets the real-life Aech and Ogden, but not Art3mis and Shoto, who are already hooked into Ogden's immersion pods.\n\nThe day of the battle, Wade uses his planted hack to bring down the barricade, and a massive fight among avatars ensues. After Parzival uses the mecha Leopardon (accompanied by Art3mis's Minerva X and Aech's Gundam) to fight against Sorrento's \"Mechagodzilla\" Kiryu, Parzival and friends unlock the gate, at which point the Sixers use an artifact called the Cataclyst to destroy the castle and all avatars over a large area. Parzival survives because having the \"Pac-Man\" quarter granted him an extra life. As he enters the Crystal Gate, he announces that if he wins he will share his fortune with his three friends. With Sorrento and his Sixers on his heels, Parzival plays \"Tempest,\" role-plays King Arthur and various characters in \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\", and retrieves the Easter egg in \"Adventure\". His victory grants him control of the OASIS, including wiping out his enemies' avatars, resurrecting his friends, and a Big Red Button that would wipe OASIS. Sorrento is arrested for the murder of Daito and for conspiring to kill Wade and the others. Back in Oregon, Wade and Art3mis, whose actual name is Samantha, meet in person and rekindle their relationship with a kiss.\n\n\n\"Ready Player One\" was a \"New York Times\" bestseller. Among those praising the book were \"Entertainment Weekly\", \"The Boston Globe\", \"The A.V. Club\", CNN.com, io9, and \"Boing Boing\". \"USA Today\" wrote that the novel \"undoubtedly qualifies Cline as the hottest geek on the planet right now.\" NPR said that the book was \"ridiculously fun and large-hearted\". Cline \"takes a far-out premise and engages the reader instantly\" with a \"deeply felt narrative [that] makes it almost impossible to stop turning the pages.\" Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" wrote that \"The book gets off to a witty start\" but noted that it lacks at least one dimension, stating that gaming had overwhelmed everything else about this book. Rebecca Serle of \"HuffPost\" described the book as \"the grown-up's \"Harry Potter\"\" and that it \"has it all – nostalgia, trivia, adventure, romance, heart and, dare I say it, some very fascinating social commentary.\"\n\nThe book has been translated into over 20 languages.\n\nIn an interview with \"Fortune\", Cline said that his book had inspired designers at companies such as Oculus VR which recommended the book for their new employees. Oculus has also invited Cline several times to sign books and demo hardware. The Ready Player One: Oasis beta, developed by Directive Games Limited, was released on March 23, 2018 alongside the Steven Spielberg movie and consists of four experiences made for virtual reality headsets. The game is currently available for free on Steam and Viveport. \n\n\"Lacero\", a fan-fiction story by Andy Weir, was published in the 2016 edition of \"Ready Player One\". It follows the story of Nolan Sorrento and functions as a precursor to the main novel, and is considered canonical to the \"Ready Player One\" fictional universe.\n\nIn 2015, in an interview with \"Den of Geek\", screenwriter Zak Penn reported that Cline was working on a sequel to the novel. In December 2017, Cline himself confirmed he is writing a sequel. Cline stated that the new sequel would not consist of a contest and would have a different type of storyline involving all of the characters while still exploring pop culture references like the first book.\n\nTen months after the first edition release, Cline revealed on his blog that \"Ready Player One\" itself contained an elaborately hidden Easter egg. This clue would form the first part of a series of staged video gaming tests, similar to the plot of the novel. Cline also revealed that the competition's grand prize would be a DeLorean. The Easter egg was a URL hidden in the book for anoraksalmanac.com. This was the first stage of the contest where the 2011 Atari 2600 game The Stacks by developers Mike Mika & Kevin Wilson was featured. The game \"Ultimate Collector: Garage Sale\" by Austin-based developer Portalarium was featured in the second stage of the contest. The final stage of the contest was announced on August 1, 2012, and was to set a world record on one of several classic arcade or Atari 2600 games. This was completed on August 9, 2012 by Craig Queen, who set a new world record in \"Joust\". He was awarded the DeLorean on the TV show \"X-Play\".\n\nThe film rights were purchased by Warner Bros. on the same day Cline finalized his publishing deal with Random House, one year prior to the novel's publication. Dan Farah brought the project into the studio and produced it with Donald De Line. Cline adapted his novel into a screenplay. Over the years, Eric Eason and Zak Penn assisted Cline with rewrites.\n\nSteven Spielberg signed on to direct in March 2015. Spielberg and Kristie Macosko Krieger of Amblin Partners also joined Deline and Farah as producers. Warner Bros. initially announced a release date of December 15, 2017. On February 9, 2016, the release date was pushed back to March 30, 2018, to avoid competition with \"\". The movie began production in the spring of 2016 and was filmed in both the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nOn June 9, 2016, \"Variety\" stated that Spielberg's regular collaborator John Williams was planning on composing the film's score. However, scheduling conflicts with another Spielberg film, \"The Post\", led to Spielberg signing Alan Silvestri for the score.\n\nThe film stars Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke, Ben Mendelsohn, Lena Waithe, Simon Pegg, Hannah John-Kamen and Mark Rylance. It premiered at South by Southwest on March 11, 2018, and was theatrically released by Warner Bros. in the United States on March 29, 2018. It received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its visuals and brisk pacing, and noted it as an improvement over the book. This film received criticism for its lack of character development and its \"achingly regressive\" view of pop culture fans.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "170593", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=170593", "title": "Stage management", "text": "Stage management\n\nStage management is a broad field that is generally defined as the practice of organization and coordination of an event or theatrical production. Stage management may encompass a variety of activities including the overseeing of the rehearsal process and  coordinating communications among various production teams and personnel. Stage management requires a general understanding of all aspects of production and offers organisational support to ensure the process runs smoothly and efficiently.\n\nA Stage Manager is an individual who has overall responsibility for stage management and the smooth execution of a theatrical production. Stage management may be performed by an individual in small productions, while larger productions typically employ a stage management team consisting of a head stage manager, or \"Production Stage Manager\", and one or more Assistant Stage Managers.\n\nThe title of Stage Manager was not used until the 18th century. Though the concept and need for someone to fill the area of stage management can be seen with the Ancient Greeks. The playwrights were usually responsible for production elements. Sophocles is the first known stage technician, supported by his employment as a scenic artist, playwright, musician, and producer.\n\nMoving into the Middle Ages there is evidence of a Conducteurs De Secrets, who oversaw collecting money at the door and serving as a prompter on stage. The prompter held the script and was prepared to feed performers their lines, this was a common practice of the time. \n\nBetween the Renaissance and 17th century the actors and playwright handled stage management aspects and stage crew. During the Elizabethan and Jacobean Theatre there were two roles that covered the stage management: Stage Keeper and Book Keeper. The Stage Keeper was responsible for the maintenance of the theater, taking props on and off stage, and security of performance space. The Book Keeper was responsible for the stage script, obtaining necessary licenses, copying/providing lines for the performers, marking entrances and exits, tracking props, marking when sound effects come in, and cueing props and sound effects. \n\nBetween the Renaissance and the 16th century, actors and playwrights took upon themselves the handling of finances, general directorial duties, and stage management. Stage management first emerged as a distinct role in the 17th century during Shakespeare's and Molière's time. During Shakespeare’s time the roles of stage management were left to apprentices, young boys learning the trade. There is still evidence of a prompter at this time.\n\nThough it wasn't until the 18th century in England that the term Stage Manager was used. This was the first time a person other than actors and playwright was hired to direct or manage the stage. Over time, with the rise in complexity of theatre due to advances such as mechanized scenery, quick costume changes, and controlled lighting, the stage manager's job was split into two positions—\"director\" and \"stage manager\".\n\nMany playwrights, directors, and actors have previously worked as an assistant stage manager. Writer and director Preston Sturges, for example, was employed as an ASM on Isadora Duncan's production of \"Oedipus Rex\" at the age of 16 and a half:\n\nWhen one is responsible for giving an offstage cue, even the simplest ones, like the ring of a telephone or a birdcall, demand considerable sangfroid, and the job is nervewracking. One is very much aware that everything depends on the delivery of the cue at exactly the right microsecond. One stands there, knees slightly bent, breathing heavily...\n\nSturges didn't last long in this job, due to his calling for thunder and then lightning instead of lightning and then thunder, but 16 years later Brock Pemberton hired him as an ASM on Antoinette Perry's production of \"Goin' Home\", which led to the first mounting of one of Sturges' plays on Broadway, \"The Guinea Pig\", in 1929.\n\n\n\nThe stage management kit can be as expansive as a huge tackle box, or a smaller bag containing only the absolute essentials. Some common items in a kit include:\n\n\n\nOther items may be needed specifically during the rehearsal period, such as:\n\nIt is important to keep lines of communication open between the stage manager and all other departments of the production.\n\nThe prompt book contains the script from which the SM calls the show, labeled with light and sound cues. It may also contain:\n\nIn the United States, \"Stage Manager\" is a generic title that may be applied to anyone who performs stage management functions. On small shows, one person typically performs all the tasks of stage management, and is simply referred to as \"the stage manager\". Larger shows often need two or more stage managers. In such cases the head stage manager is titled Production Stage Manager (commonly abbreviated PSM), and working under the PSM is one or more Assistant Stage Managers (commonly abbreviated ASM). Shows that employ three stage managers have a PSM and two ASMs, though the program credits may list them as \"Production Stage Manager\" (first or head stage manager), \"Stage Manager\" (second stage manager), and \"Assistant Stage Manager\" (third stage manager).\n\nSome professional stage managers on plays and musicals may choose to be represented by a union known as the Actors' Equity Association, which also represents performers. In addition to performing their typical stage management duties (e.g., maintaining the prompt book and calling performances), Equity stage managers are also required to uphold the union's rules and rights for Equity artists. Union stage managers for opera, ballet, and modern dance are represented by the American Guild of Musical Artists and perform most of the same duties as their counterparts in plays and musicals.\n\nIn the UK, the structure of a stage management team depends on the type and size of the production. It can consist of stage manager (overseeing the running of the show), deputy stage manager (commonly called DSM), and assistant stage manager (commonly called ASM). A fringe theatre show may employ one stage manager to carry out the tasks of an entire team, whereas a West End theatre show in London might employ multiple ASMs. Professional stage managers are represented by the British Actors' Equity Association, which also represents performers.\n\nThe DSM prompts actors and will usually cue technical crew members and sometimes cast, while following the orders of the director and stage manager. The DSM calls actors to hold while technical problems are sorted out during rehearsal, and determines where in the script to restart halted scenes. The deputy stage manager (DSM) is a separate position in some theatres, while in others the responsibilities of the DSM may be assumed by the stage manager or assistant stage manager.\n\nThe assistant stage manager (ASM) has varied responsibilities, which are assigned by the stage manager. The ASM assists in finding and maintaining props during rehearsals and the run of the show. The ASM may take attendance or estimate audience size, may manage the backstage technicians, may act as a liaison between crew, cast and management, and may call some cues. Mundane tasks such as mopping the stage and brewing coffee or tea may fall to the ASM. If the stage manager is unable to perform his or her duties, the ASM must be able to fill in. The assistant may also be in charge of one wing of the stage, while the stage manager is on the other wing.\n\nMany live shows around the world are produced with the forehand knowledge that they will have a very long run, often measured in years. These are usually known quantities that are very expensive productions and have a guaranteed audience because of their location. Often, they are on cruise ships, in theme parks, Las Vegas or at destination resorts. These shows warrant very long-range development and planning and use stage managers to run almost all technical elements in the show, without many of the other traditional crew members, such as sound, lighting and rigging operators. In these cases, show control systems are installed and connected to all other technical systems in the theatre, which are specifically designed to be controlled by show control and to operate safely with minimal supervision. Stage managers working these shows usually have the additional responsibility for programming the show control system, and often the other control systems as well.\n\nThe role of stage manager evolved from an amalgamation of various positions in theater over several centuries and is still generally known for its integral relationship with theater. Many other types of productions and events have incorporated the position of stage management, however. Some of the most common are Opera, Music and Dance concerts and, Film and Television.\n\nFor music concerts, stage management includes a large variety of responsibilities depending on both the venue and the size and expertise of the musical group coming into the venue. Some of the responsibilities of a concert stage manager include overseeing the schedule for load in and out of equipment, seeing to the comfort of the group which can include arranging refreshments and or transportation, sometimes arranging how and where merchandise is to be sold at the venue, and above all, as with all areas of stage management, watching out for the safety of all participants in the experience including performers, audience, and any crews required.\n\nWith being a Stage Manager you also need to know what unions you will be working with. Some of the things that a Stage Manager needs to know about working with a union is how often do they take breaks, and who is represented by which union. \nCommonly referred to as Actors Equity (AEA). Actors Equity represents the stage actors and stage managers in the live theatre industry. The AEA works to negotiate and provide performers and stage managers quality living conditions, livable wages, and benefits.\nInternational Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) represents the stage hands in the theatre.\nUnited Scenic Artist also known as United Scenic Artists of America. It organizes designers, artists and craftspeople in the entertainment and decorative arts industries.<ref>United Scenic Artists is affiliated with International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees since 1999.\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n"}
{"id": "39290801", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39290801", "title": "Tarot card games", "text": "Tarot card games\n\nTarot games, occasionally called tarock games, are card games played with tarot decks, also known as Tarock decks. The basic rules first appeared in the manuscript of Martiano da Tortona, written before 1425. The games, known as \"tarot\", \"tarock\", \"tarocco\" and other spellings, are known in many variations, mostly cultural and regional.\n\nThe deck which English-speakers call by the French name \"Tarot\" is called \"Tarocco\" in Italian, \"Tarock\" in German and various similar words in other languages. Tarot games originated in Italy, and spread to most parts of Europe, notable exceptions being the British Isles, the Iberian peninsula, and the Balkans. They are played with decks having four ordinary suits, and one additional, longer suit of tarots, which are always trumps. They are characterised by the rule that a player who cannot follow to a trick with a card of the suit led \"must\" play a trump to the trick if possible. Tarot games may have introduced the concept of trumps to card games. More recent tarot games borrowed features from other games like bidding from Ombre and winning the last trick with the lowest trump from Trappola.\n\nTarot decks did not precede decks having four suits of the same length, and they were invented not for occult purposes but purely for gaming. In 1781, Court de Gébelin published an essay associating the cards with ancient wisdom, the earliest record of this idea, subsequently debunked by Dummett. The cards have since been used for cartomancy and divination.\n\nDummett classified Tarot games into three distinct types:\n\n\nTarocchi (Italian, singular \"Tarocco\"), and similar names in other languages, is a specific form of playing card deck used for different trick-taking games. An earlier name of the game \"Trionfi\" is first recorded in the diary of Giusto Giusti in September 1440 (in other early documents also ludus triumphorum or similar). The name \"Tarochi\" was first used in Ferrara June 1505, the name \"Taraux\" appeared in Avignon in December of the same year. The names Tarocco, Tarocchi and Tarot developed in later times beside different writing forms. The poet Francesco Berni still mocked on this word in his \"Capitolo del Gioco della Primiera\" written in 1526. The name Trionfi developed later as a general term for trick-taking games (Triomphe in French, Trumpfen in German and Trump in English), although it has almost completely disappeared in its original function as deck name. Other different games claimed the name without any use of Tarocchi cards. The first basic rules for the game of \"Tarocco\" appear in the manuscript of Martiano da Tortona, the next are known from the year 1637.\n\nExcluding Piedmontese tarocchi, which is more closely related to French tarot, Italian tarocchi are all of Type I, i.e. they have trumps other than the I and XXI that are worth more than one card point. Winning the final trick (\"ultimo\") awards a set number of points. Sicilian tarocchi is played in only four towns with 63 cards from the Tarocco Siciliano deck. Tarocchini is confined to Bologna and uses the 62 card Tarocco Bolognese deck. These games have four face cards in each suit but dropped some of their pip cards early in their history. Both decks include 21 trumps and The Fool, a suitless card that excuses the player from following suit.\n\nThe French adopted tarot games after their occupation of Milan in the late 15th century. French tarot, known locally as \"Jeu de Tarot\", is one which uses the full 78-card Tarot deck. Originally played with the Italian-suited Tarot de Marseille, the game is now played with the French-suited Tarot Nouveau. The Tarot Nouveau, of Frankfurt origin, has trumps which depict scenes of traditional social activities; this differs from the Renaissance allegorical motifs found in Italian-suited Tarot decks such as the Tarot de Marseille, Tarocco Piemontese, the Tarocco Bolognese, or even the Rider-Waite well known in cartomancy. \"Jeu de Tarot\" is now the most popular card game in France after Belote and many tournaments are held by the Fédération Française de Tarot.\n\nA Tarot Nouveau deck consists of 56 cards of four suits and 22 emblematic cards called \"atouts\" (trumps). Each suit consists of fourteen cards: ten pip cards, and four face cards: the \"Roi\" (King), \"Dame\" (Queen), \"Cavalier\" (Knight), and \"Valet\" (Jack). Of the \"atouts\", 21 are numbered from 1 to 21, and a non-numbered card called \"Fou\" (\"Fool\", also called \"\"Mat\" or \"L'Excuse\"\" in play) which \"excuses\" the player from following suit. Of the \"atouts\", only the Fool and trumps 1 and 21 are considered to be \"counting\" cards because they are worth more than 1 point. Winning the last trick awards bonuses only if it is won with the lowest trump.\n\nTarot games from Piedmont, the Italian region bordering France, are more similar to French tarot than other Italian games as it was the French that (re-)introduced tarot to that region. These games use the 78-card Tarocco Piemontese deck which was derived from the Tarot de Marseille. The most common Piedmontese tarot games are Scarto, Mitigati, Chiamare il Re, and Partita which can be found in Pinerolo and Turin. Piedmontese games are also the simplest tarot games and can be used to introduce new players on basic rules and features. Troccas, a Swiss tarot game, is also related and is played with the 78-card Swiss 1JJ Tarot, another derivative of the Tarot de Marseille. Danish Grosstarok, which focuses on winning the final trick, also uses the Tarot Nouveau.\n\nTarock games, Dummett's Type III, differ from other forms in the function of the Fool which is now simply the highest trump. Games of this category include Cego, Zwanzigerrufen and Königrufen. These games use the 54 card French suited Cego or \"Industrie und Glück\" decks that strip certain pip cards. The games are widely played in the German region of Baden and the countries within the boundaries of the former Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, for which even the name \"Tarockanien\" has been coined: the Austrian variation of the game (and the variations thereof) is thus still widely popular among all classes and generations in Slovenia and Croatia, while in Hungary different rules are applied. The Swiss game of Troggu is believed to be an intermediary form linking the older tarot games to the Central European ones.\n\nThe individual tarock game variants differ too widely from one another to give a general description of play. However they can be grouped by sub-type:\n\n\nA few games use the German suited 36 card deck that lacks any dedicated trump suit. Instead, one of the existing suits, customarily the heart suit, is chosen as the trump suit. These include Württemberg Tarock, Bavarian Tarock, Bauerntarock, and Dobbm. They are Ace-Ten games that incorporate rules from Tapp Tarock, but are not true tarock games.\n\nThe following true tarock variants are known:\n\nA complete Tarot deck such as one for French Tarot contains the full 78-card complement and can be used to play any game in the family with the exception of Minchiate, an extinct game that used 97 cards. Austrian-Hungarian Tarock and Italian Tarocco decks, however, are a smaller subset (of 63, 54, 40, or even 36 cards) suitable only for games of a particular region. Regional tarot decks commonly feature culture-specific suits; the German suits of Hearts, Bells, Acorns and Leaves are used through most of Germanic Europe, the Latin suits of Cups, Coins, Clubs, and Swords are common in Italy and Spain, and the French suits familiar to most English speakers are seen in France, Quebec, West Germany and most of the English-speaking world. This trend continues even to non-Tarot decks such as for the German game of Skat (played with a deck of similar-value cards as in the French piquet deck used for Belote; players in most of western Germany use French suits while players in Bavaria and eastern Germany use German suits).\n\nThe 78-card tarot deck contains:\n\nThe 54-card 'tarock' deck contains:\n\nDue to the antiquity of tarot games, the cards are ordered in an archaic ranking. In the plain suits, Kings are always high. With the exception of modern French tarot and Sicilian tarocchi, the ranking in the Latin round suits (cups and coins) or the French red suits (diamonds and hearts) goes from King (high), Queen, Cavalier, Jack, 1, 2, 3 ... 10 (low).\n\n\n\nThe cards are usually counted in groups of two or three depending on the game. After the hand has been played, a score is taken based on the point values of the cards in the tricks each player has managed to capture.\n\nFor the purpose of the rules, the numbering of the trumps are the only thing that matters. The symbolic tarot images customary in non-gaming divinatory tarots have no effect in the game itself. The design traditions of these decks subsequently evolved independently and they often bear only numbers and whimsical scenes arbitrarily chosen by the engraver. However, there are still traditional sequences of images in which the common lineage is visible; e.g. the moon that is commonly visible at the bottom left corner of the trump card 21 stems from confusion of the German word \"Mond\", meaning Moon, with Italian \"mondo\" and French \"monde\", meaning \"world\", the usual symbol associated with the trump card 21 on Italian suited tarots and in non-gaming divinatory tarot.\n\n\n\n"}

Apprenticed to a printer (his cousin Cornelius Chapman) in Norwood, London, Thomas started his own printing firm in the same town after Chapman's business became bankrupt.\n\nIn 1846 he took over the publication of John Goodwyn Barmby's \"Communist Chronicle,\" a monthly paper which had been discontinued for financial reasons. Frost revived the Chronicle as a weekly publication and reduced the price from 3d. to 1d. with Barmby retaining editorial control. Differences between Barmby and Frost on their aims caused publication to cease. Frost then started a short-lived \"Communist Journal.\" From 1847 to 1848 he was associated with the Fraternal Democrats.\n\nFrom 1859 Frost was a leader writer for the Liverpool \"Albion\" weekly newspaper, on foreign politics and social questions. The newspaper maintained a political viewpoint independent of the main political parties until 1872, when a new proprietor, a member of the Conservative Party, recast the paper as a morning daily. Frost's terms of employment were now changed so that he was only paid for articles that were published; he was contracted to provide two articles per week, but many were not published, being politically incompatible. His income falling by one-third he left the \"Albion.\"\n\nFrost subsequently settled in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, and worked as a reporter for the \"Barnsley Times\" and the \"Barnsley Chronicle.\" He wrote a number of books, mostly by his own admission \"potboilers\". He estimated his annual income from journalism and other literary undertakings to have been less than £200 per year. He died in 1908.\n\nFrost claimed it was not until he read the poetry of Mary Shelley that he learned of \"the connexion between the influence of circumstances in the formation of character and the new organization which Owen desired to give society\". Frost became an active Chartist and Owenite and although he believed in revolution he stopped short of taking part in a revolutionary conspiracy to avoid arrest. He above all desired independence and wrote that \"the assumption by Mr. Gladstone of the leadership of the Liberal party in the House of Commons seemed to promise the inauguration of a new era\".\n\nFrost wrote three books on the history of magic. His \"Lives of the Conjurers\" (1876) is considered to be the first significant history of magic. M. Thomas Inge described the book as \"a full-fledged chronicle of magic and an invaluable reference work\". \n\nThe magician Harry Houdini wrote that they were the \"best books of their kind up to the time of their publication, but they are marked by glaring errors, showing that Frost compiled rather than investigated.\"\n\nFrost's book \"Lives of the Conjurers\" is said to contain errors in relation to the magician Wiljalba Frikell. Magic historian Walter B. Gibson noted that \"the information offered by Mr. Thomas Frost and his successors, concerning Frikell, is in the main incorrect and unreliable.\"\n\nThomas Frost died 16 July 1908.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Trick shots frequently involve the balls organized in ways that are unlikely or impossible to appear in normal play, such as balls being in a straight line, or use props such as extra cues or a triangle that would not be allowed on the table during a game. As an organized cue sports discipline, trick shot competition is known as artistic pool.\n\nBilliards trick shots are the subject of increasing international competition, both amateur and professional. There are world championships, such as the WPA Artistic Pool World Championships and the World Snooker Trickshot Championship (which has not been held since 2006), and made-for-TV events, such as \"Trick Shot Magic\" and the \"World Cup of Trick Shots\", often televised in both the US and the UK and providing enough prize money that some professional players specialize in the discipline.\n\nThe formats vary depending on the competition. Some, such as the World Snooker Trickshot Championship are purely exhibitions, with a panel of judges scoring subjectively to determine the winner.\n\nEvents such as Trick Shot Magic and the World Cup feature head-to-head competition where the players select shots that have strictly outlined requirements specified in a playbook. Each year, players are allowed to submit their own shot inventions, however, they are disclosed prior to the event to give all players an equal chance to practice them. Players or teams are given two attempts to complete a selected shot within the given parameters, and earn one point for each successful shot, either a first shot or follow-up shot. Each player or team gets to select a given number of shots, generally eight or ten, and a winner is declared when one side is mathematically eliminated. Trick Shot Magic, ESPN's annual artistic pool pro tournament, has been widely considered the televised version of the World Artistic Pool Championship, and it has held the highest ratings in televised cue sports competitions in the United States between 2000 and 2009.\n\nArtistic pool similarly \"(see below)\" has a (three attempts each, in a sliding-scale point system), with precisely outlined parameters requirements.\n\nThe Ultimate Trick Shot Tour features head-to-head competition between two players with no pre-defined shots. Players challenge each other with shots outlining the parameters of the shots just before shooting. Each player gets three attempts per shot, scoring one point per shot made. Each player gets to select a given number of shots, generally six to ten, and the winner is declared when one player is mathematically eliminated.\n\nArtistic pool trick shot competitions, inspired by the related discipline of artistic billiards, began in the 1970s with international pros and coordinated by world champion Paul Gerni, with the World Trick Shot Artists Association, and in 2000, in Las Vegas, formed a new group, again with an international cast. They feature a program of 160 tricks to attempt, many of which were used in the previous formats by the WTSAA, and include the BCA North American Championship, EPBF European Championship, and WPA World Championship, among others. The tricks are now divided into eight \"disciplines\", including trick/fancy, prop/novelty/special arts, and disciplines for extremes in each of the core cueing techniques. The current world governing body for this sport is the WPA Artistic Pool Division, while the current largest league and player organization is the US-based Artistic Pool & Trick Shot Association (APTSA), which organizes the World Artistic Pool Championship (WAPC) annually, held concurrently with the more general VNEA International Pool Championship. The greatest contemporary champions of artistic pool include 22-time World Champion Paul Gerni, and more recently, Mike Massey, Andy Segal, and Tom Rossman.\n\nIn WTSAA and APTSA competitions, competitors would have three chances to successfully perform each trick, earning full points if they are successful on their first attempts and incrementally reduced points for subsequent attempts. Each shot has an associated difficulty rating (also the point value) with a higher rating being more difficult. A preliminary round of 40 shots is performed, and the top players (the number varies depending on the number of competitors, but usually the top 12) proceed into a head-to-head playoff format to determine the winner. Proper and official artistic pool competitions feature equipment limitations, (one cue, one stroke per trick shot, one approved universal prop per shot per diagram if necessary, all shots on the bed of the table, etc.), and shot requirements (e.g., preclusion of any off-the-table tricks, such as are popular in events like Trick Shot Magic and World Cup of Trick Shots).\n\nAs with other pool and billiards games, trick shots usually utilize a , one or more , and a cue stick. However, many props can be used in trick shots including bottles, drinking glasses, baskets, coins, ball racks, cue tip chalk, and other billiards- and non-billiards-related equipment. Props are used to change the difficulty of the shot or add aesthetic value. As with artistic billiards pros, trick shot artists often have specialized cue sticks for performing particular types of shots, particularly and massés.\n\nThe APTSA trick shot disciplines are:\n\n\nWPA-APD Currently World Ranked at #26 Cary Wallace (thattrickshotguy)\n\n\nVarious trick shot competitions (sometimes with footage dating back years) remain among the most dominant of ESPN's pool-related programming, and the World Snooker Trickshot Championship has enjoyed notable popularity in the UK. The British TV game show \"Big Break\", which ran from 1991 to 2002, featured a round each week called \"Virgo's Trick Shot\". John Virgo would demonstrate a snooker trick shot which the contestant would then attempt to copy. The show also aired eight trick shot specials between 1995 and 1999.\n\nTrick shots appear frequently in films and television. Perhaps the most outlandish case would be in BBC Two's science fiction comedy TV series \"Red Dwarf\", episode \"White Hole\", in which the character Dave Lister uses his pool-playing skills to play a trick shot at an astronomical level in order to save the ship, using a thermonuclear device as a \"cue\" and planetary bodies as \"balls\". Most pool-themed films, such as \"Poolhall Junkies\" with a scene involving a high-stakes wager on a , include difficult shots that some might classify as trick shots. Another example might be the character Vince pocketing the nine-ball when asked to, in the film version of \"The Color of Money\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1179306", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1179306", "title": "White Hunter Black Heart", "text": "White Hunter Black Heart\n\nWhite Hunter Black Heart is a 1990 American adventure drama film directed by and starring Clint Eastwood and based on the 1953 book of the same name by Peter Viertel. Viertel also co-wrote the script with James Bridges and Burt Kennedy. The film is a thinly disguised account of writer Peter Viertel's experiences while working on the classic 1951 film \"The African Queen\", which was shot on location in Africa at a time when location shoots outside of the United States for American films were very rare. The main character, brash director John Wilson, played by Eastwood, is based on real-life director John Huston. Jeff Fahey plays Pete Verrill, a character based on Viertel. George Dzundza's character is based on \"African Queen\" producer Sam Spiegel. Marisa Berenson's character Kay Gibson and Richard Vanstone's character Phil Duncan, are based on Katharine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart, respectively. This was the last film that James Bridges worked on writing down a screenplay before dying in 1993.\n\nIn the early 1950s, world-renowned filmmaker John Wilson travels to Africa for his next film bringing with him a young writer chum named Pete Verrill. Part of his travel plans include hunting elephants and other game, which he prioritizes ahead of making the film. This leads to a conflict between the men on several levels, most notably over the idea of killing for sport such a grand animal. Even Wilson concedes that it is so wrong that it is not just a crime against nature, but a \"sin.\" Yet he cannot overcome his desire to bring down a giant bull, a \"tusker\" with massive ivory tusks. Wilson's final realization that his is a petty, ignoble pursuit comes at a late point and with a tragic price, as the local animal tracker Kivu is killed protecting him from an elephant Wilson decides not to shoot.\n\n\nAt times, Eastwood, as the John Huston-like character of John Wilson, can be heard drawing out his vowels, speaking in Huston's distinctive style.\n\nThe film was shot on location in Kariba, Zimbabwe and surrounds including at Lake Kariba, Victoria Falls and Hwange, over two months in the summer of 1989. Some interiors were shot in and around Pinewood Studios in England. The boat used in the film was constructed in England of glass fibre and shipped to Africa for filming. It was electrically powered, but was fitted with motors and engines by special effects expert John Evans to make the boat appear to be steam-powered. The elephant gun used in the film was a £65,000 double barrelled rifle of the type preferred by most professional hunters and their clients in this era. It was made by Holland & Holland, the gunmakers who also made the gun used by Huston when he was in Africa for \"The African Queen\" in 1951. The \"White Hunter Black Heart\" filmmakers took great care with the gun and sold it back to Holland & Holland after filming \"unharmed, unscratched, unused.\"\n\nActor Clive Mantle, who plays the racist bouncer Harry, has the distinction of being the only person to successfully beat up Clint Eastwood in a film (not counting \"Every Which Way But Loose\" when he intentionally loses). Mantle was roughly half Eastwood's age and reportedly had trouble keeping up with him during filming of the fight scene. Although Eastwood had suffered beatings in other films, most notably \"Dirty Harry\", its sequel \"Sudden Impact\" and later \"Unforgiven\", they usually involved him being outnumbered or outmatched; this was the first and only time he was defeated in a fair fight.\n\nThe film was entered into the 1990 Cannes Film Festival. The film received positive reviews with review tallying website Rotten Tomatoes reporting that 29 out of the 33 reviews they tallied were positive for a score of 88%. The consensus reads: \"\"White Hunter Black Heart\" is powerful, intelligent, and subtly moving, a fascinating meditation on masculinity and the insecurities of artists.\"\n\nThe film has grown significantly in critical stature, especially in light of the films Eastwood made immediately afterwards. Many of these, like \"White Hunter, Black Heart\", turned out to be self-reflexive and self-conscious works criticizing and deconstructing Eastwood's own iconography. Jim Hoberman of \"The Village Voice\" hailed it as \"Eastwood’s best work before \"Unforgiven\"...[an] underrated hall-of-mirrors movie about movie-inspired megalomania.\" Dave Kehr and Jonathan Rosenbaum consider it a masterpiece, with the latter pointing out the Brechtian nature of Eastwood's performance, as he never disappears into the role he is playing; instead, Eastwood is always recognizably his unique star persona while showing us what he imagines Huston (i.e. Wilson) to have been. The result is \"a running commentary on his two subjects, Huston and himself—the ruminations and questions of a free man.\"\n\n\"White Hunter Black Heart\"'s gross theatrical earnings reached just over $2 million, well below the film's $24 million budget.\n\n"}

Kevin Wilson using the Inform language. The game was released by Activision on August 28, 1997 for free to coincide with the release of \"Zork Grand Inquisitor\". \"ZUU\" can be seen as having two goals: promotion of the commercial title \"Zork Grand Inquisitor\", and an attempt to reconcile with die-hard Infocom fans who may have harbored resentment against Activision for their role in buying Infocom in 1985 and subsequent closure of the company in 1989.\n\n\"Zork: The Undiscovered Underground\", a prelude to \"Zork Grand Inquisitor\", is set in the year 1066 GUE. The game is played from the viewpoint of your character who is a private in the Inquisition Guard, tasked with exploring a recently discovered area of the Great Underground Empire. The game merges classic \"Zorkian\" references such as grues and zorkmids with elements created for the newer game, such as the Grand Inquisitor.\n\nThe purpose of the game is to explore and emerge successfully from the Undiscovered Underground. The player begins only with a low-quality Lantern and plastic imitation sword, a parody of the starting items from Zorks I, II and III. Upon entering the Undiscovered Underground, the adventurer is trapped by a freak avalanche. The only way to escape is to release the mutant Rat Ants (an echo from Starcross) and to direct them to the avalanche, which they dispatch in a manner reminiscent of Aesop's Fables. The player must demask a Grue vendor, killing it with light, to gain the four candy bars and place the relevant objects in the Mud Forum on the appropriate corresponding floor symbols. This unleashes a mutant chase reminiscent of Planetfall where the adventurer stays one step ahead of the Rat Ants because of the shrewdly placed candy bars. However, the escape comes at the cost of unleashing a Rat Ant epidemic onto the empire and forces the adventurer to flee from the wrath of the Grand Inquisitor.\n\nAlternatively, the player can solve the remainder of the puzzles for a slightly happier ending. Attaching the tinsel hidden in the tree in the Mud Forum to the zorkmid hidden in the trunk backstage allows the player to dupe the Implementers (named after the creators of the game) in the Museum of Illusion into revealing several hints. With the newfound information the player can use the clothes in the Changing Room (any matching combination works) to penetrate the Grue convention in the Convention Hall to obtain the glasses. The glasses can be combined with the coloured lenses on the Stage to decode the image in the Mud Forum (which allows the adventurer to order the objects without using guess and check). However, the Implementers also tell the adventurer which rib of the skeleton in the Museum of Adventure to pry. The low-quality sword snaps if the wrong rib is attempted, and the correct rib (which varies from game to game) does not exist until the adventurer is tipped off by the Implementers.\n\nPrying the rib gives the adventurer access to the Janitor's Closet, a room of global proportions that contains a spray can whose contents allow the adventurer to defeat the Rat Ants, earning an afternoon off from the Grand Inquisitor.\n\n"}
