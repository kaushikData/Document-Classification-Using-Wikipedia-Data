{"id": "2790", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2790", "title": "Air show", "text": "Air show\n\nAn air show, (or airshow, air fair, air tattoo) is a public event where aircraft are exhibited.\nThey often include aerobatics demonstrations, without they are called \"static air shows\" with aircraft parked on the ground.\n\nThe largest is Le Bourget followed by Farnborough, while Dubai air show and Singapore Air Show are both claiming the third place. The biggest military airshow in the world is the Royal International Air Tattoo, at RAF Fairford in England.\n\nSome airshows are held as a business venture or as a trade event where aircraft, avionics and other services are promoted to potential customers. Many air shows are held in support of local, national or military charities. Military air firms often organise air shows at military airfields as a public relations exercise to thank the local community, promote military careers and raise the profile of the military.\n\nAir \"seasons\" vary around the world. The United States enjoys a long season that generally runs from March to November, covering the spring, summer, and fall seasons. Other countries often have much shorter seasons. In Japan air shows are generally events held at Japan Self-Defense Forces bases regularly throughout the year. The European season usually starts in late April or Early May and is usually over by mid October. The Middle East, Australia and New Zealand hold their events between January and March. However, for many acts, the \"off-season\" does not mean a period of inactivity; pilots and performers use this time for maintenance and practice.\n\nThe type of displays seen at an are constrained by a number of factors, including the weather and visibility. Most aviation authorities now publish rules and guidance on minimum display heights and criteria for differing conditions. In addition to the weather, pilots and organizers must also consider local airspace restrictions. Most exhibitors will plan \"full,\" \"rolling\" and \"flat\" display for varying weather and airspace conditions.\n\nThe types of shows vary greatly. Some are large scale military events with large flying displays and ground exhibitions while others held at small local airstrips can often feature just one or two hours of flying with just a few stalls on the ground. Air Displays can be held during day or night with the latter becoming increasingly popular. Shows don't always take place over airfields; some have been held over the grounds of stately homes or castles and over the sea at coastal resorts.\n\nThe first public international airshow, at which many types of aircraft were displayed and flown, was the Grande Semaine d'Aviation de la Champagne, which was held Aug. 22-29, 1909 in Reims. This had been preceded by what may have been the first ever gathering of enthusiasts, June 28-July 19 of the same year at the airfield at La Brayelle, near Douai.\n\nBefore the Second World War, air shows were associated with long distance air races, often lasting many days and covering thousands of miles. While the Reno Air Races keep this tradition alive, most air shows today primarily feature a series of aerial demos of short duration.\n\nMost air shows feature warbirds, aerobatics, and demonstrations of modern military aircraft, and many air shows offer a variety of other aeronautical attractions as well, such as wing-walking, radio-controlled aircraft, water/slurry drops from firefighting aircraft, simulated helicopter rescues and sky diving.\n\nSpecialist aerobatic aircraft have powerful piston engines, light weight and big control surfaces, making them capable of very high roll rates and accelerations. A skilled pilot will be able to climb vertically, perform very tight turns, tumble his aircraft end-over-end and perform manoeuvres during loops.\n\nLarger airshows can be headlined by military jet demonstration teams.\nIn the United States, those are the U.S. Navy Blue Angels and USAF Thunderbirds.\nThe Canadian Forces Snowbirds will headline many airshows in Canada and the United States.\nMany airshows in the United Kingdom are headlined by the RAF's Red Arrows.\n\nSolo military jet demos, also known as tactical demo, feature one aircraft, usually a strike fighter or an advanced trainer. The demonstration focuses on the capabilities of modern aircraft used in combat operations. The display will usually demonstrate the aircraft's very short (and often very loud) rolls, fast speeds, slow approach speeds, as well as their ability to quickly make tight turns, to climb quickly, and their ability to be precisely controlled at a large range of speeds. Manoeuvres include aileron rolls, barrel rolls, hesitation rolls, Cuban-8s, tight turns, high-alpha flight, a high-speed pass, double Immelmans, and touch-and-gos. Tactical demos may include simulated bomb drops, sometimes with pyrotechnics on the ground for effect. Aircraft with special characteristics that give them unique capabilities will often display those in their demos; For example, Russian fighters with Thrust vectoring may be used to perform Pugachev's Cobra or the Kulbit, among other difficult manoeuvers that cannot be performed by other aircraft. Similarly, an F-22 pilot may hover his jet in the air with the nose pointed straight up, a Harrier or Osprey pilot may perform a vertical landing or vertical takeoff, and so on.\n\nAir shows may present some risk to spectators and aviators. Accidents have occurred, sometimes with a large loss of life, such as the 1988 disaster at Ramstein Air Base in Germany and the 2002 air show crash at Lviv, Ukraine. Because of these accidents, the various aviation authorities around the world have set rules and guidance for those running and participating in air displays. Air displays are often monitored by aviation authorities to ensure safe procedures.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, local authorities will first need to approve any application for an event to which the public is admitted. No approval, no event. The first priority must be to arrange insurance cover and details can be obtained from your local authority. An added complication is a whole new raft of legislation concerning Health & Safety in particular Corporate Manslaughter, which can involve the event organiser being charged with a criminal offence if any of the insurances and risk assessments are not fully completed well in advance of the event. If this very basic step isn't completed then any further activity should be halted until it is.\n\nRules govern the distance from the crowds that aircraft must fly. These vary according to the rating of the pilot/crew, the type of aircraft and the way the aircraft is being flown. For instance, slower lighter aircraft are usually allowed closer and lower to the crowd than larger, faster types. Also, a fighter jet flying straight and level will be able to do so closer to the crowd and lower than if it were performing a roll or a loop.\n\nPilots can get authorizations for differing types of displays (i.e. limbo flying, basic aerobatics to unlimited aerobatics) and to differing minimum base heights above the ground. To gain such authorizations, the pilots will have to demonstrate to an examiner that they can perform to those limits without endangering themselves, ground crew or spectators.\n\nDespite display rules and guidances, accidents have continued to happen. However, air show accidents are rare and where there is proper supervision air shows have impressive safety records. Each year, organizations such as International Council of Air Shows and European Airshow Council meet and discuss various subjects including air show safety where accidents are discussed and lessons learned.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1855828", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1855828", "title": "Australian Rules (film)", "text": "Australian Rules (film)\n\nAustralian Rules, is a 2002 drama film directed by Paul Goldman. The film was adapted from the novels \"Deadly, Unna?\" and \"Nukkin Ya\" by Phillip Gwynne. It stars Nathan Phillips, Luke Carroll, Tom Budge, Brian Torry and Lisa Flanagan. The film is about a young man experiencing the hardships of growing up in rural South Australia. In particular, it deals with the issue of racial relationships through the central characters, their involvement in local Australian rules football, and aboriginal players. The film was launched at the Adelaide Festival of Arts on 5 March 2002, and nationwide on 29 August 2002.\n\nIn the isolated and fictional South Australian fishing town of Prospect Bay, the only thing that connects the black and white communities is football. Gary \"Blacky\" Black (Nathan Phillips) and Dumby Red (Luke Carroll) are an exception; teenage best friends from different sides of the tracks. Dumby is the star of the football team and likely to become the next big Aboriginal star in the big leagues. Gary is the bookish son of hard-drinking and brutal white fisherman Bob Black (Simon Westaway). He is attracted to Dumby's beautiful sister, Clarence (Lisa Flanagan). Blacky's supportive mother helps him become a better player as he is chosen to be the ruckman in the teams upcoming grand final. Blacky has to overcome Thumper, the star player for the opposition. When gameday arrives Blacky at first struggles to make an impact on the game but Dumby inspires the team kicking several goals. When Dumby gets a mark near goals with the scores tied he hands it off to a team mate instead of taking the shot. The player kicks a point and Blacky has to run into Thumper to stop him from kicking the winning goal. Their team wins the premiership, but Dumby and Blacky's elation is short-lived. Dumby is passed over for the best-on-ground medal for the coach's son Simon Robertson. Dumby is disgusted and angered by the obvious racially motivated decision.\n\nDisgruntled, Dumby and his cousin Pretty (Tony Briggs) attempt to rob the bar where the celebrations were held, hoping to find the best-on-ground medal. After breaking into the bar, they meet the drunk owner, beat him into unconsciousness and proceed to the safe with the key found in his pocket. Bob, waking to find the owner unconscious with a head wound, heads to the office and loads a double-barrelled shotgun. Bob sneaks up behind Dumby and fires a shot into the figure in the darkness. Bob discovers he has killed Dumby. Pretty, who's been hiding behind the door, jumps him and points the gun at his neck. Pretty reveals himself by removing his makeshift balaclava. He doesn't shoot Bob but fires the remaining round into the ceiling and runs away into the darkness. Bob is questioned by police over the shooting but is let off on the grounds of self-defense. Blacky is devastated over Dumby's death and angrily tosses his premiership medal into the lake. Clarence and Blacky console each other and fall in love. Bob and the family are greeted with hostility and harassed by some local Aboriginal people which only further fuels Bob's violent temper and bigotry.\n\nClarence sneaks into Blacky's room one night and they make love. The next morning Bob discovers them in bed and beats Blacky. He racially insults Clarence and throws her out. Fed up with his father, Blacky leaves. Blacky meets with Dumby's family and attends his funeral. He acquires the best on ground medal and places it in Dumby's casket. After returning home he is confronted by Bob and is told he is no longer welcome in his house due to his relationship with Clarence. Blacky defiantly stands still even after Bob punches him repeatedly. Defeated and exhausted, Bob leaves the family never to come back. The football team is disbanded as no Aboriginal players show up to training or games. The film ends with Blacky and Clarence jumping into the lake and swimming in the water.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2529101", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2529101", "title": "Banzhaf power index", "text": "Banzhaf power index\n\nThe Banzhaf power index, named after John F. Banzhaf III (originally invented by Lionel Penrose in 1946 and sometimes called Penrose–Banzhaf index; also known as the Banzhaf–Coleman index after James Samuel Coleman), is a power index defined by the probability of changing an outcome of a vote where voting rights are not necessarily equally divided among the voters or shareholders.\n\nTo calculate the power of a voter using the Banzhaf index, list all the winning coalitions, then count the critical voters. A \"critical voter\" is a voter who, if he changed his vote from yes to no, would cause the measure to fail. A voter's power is measured as the fraction of all swing votes that he could cast. There are some algorithms for calculating the power index, e.g., dynamic programming techniques, enumeration methods and Monte Carlo methods.\n\nA simple voting game, taken from \"Game Theory and Strategy\" by Philip D. Straffin:\n\n[6; 4, 3, 2, 1]\n\nThe numbers in the brackets mean a measure requires 6 votes to pass, and voter A can cast four votes, B three votes, C two, and D one. The winning groups, with underlined swing voters, are as follows:\n\nAB, AC, ABC, ABD, ACD, BCD, ABCD\n\nThere are 12 total swing votes, so by the Banzhaf index, power is divided thus:\n\nA = 5/12, B = 3/12, C = 3/12, D = 1/12\n\nConsider the United States Electoral College. Each state has more or less power than the next state. There are a total of 538 electoral votes. A majority vote is considered 270 votes. The Banzhaf power index would be a mathematical representation of how likely a single state would be able to swing the vote. A state such as California, which is allocated 55 electoral votes, would be more likely to swing the vote than a state such as Montana, which has 3 electoral votes.\n\nAssume the United States is having a presidential election between a Republican (R) and a Democrat (D). For simplicity, suppose that only three states are participating: California (55 electoral votes), Texas (38 electoral votes), and New York (29 electoral votes).\n\nThe possible outcomes of the election are:\n\nThe Banzhaf power index of a state is the proportion of the possible outcomes in which that state could swing the election. In this example, all three states have the same index: 4/12 or 1/3.\n\nHowever, if New York is replaced by Georgia, with only 16 electoral votes, the situation changes dramatically.\n\nIn this example, the Banzhaf index gives California 1 and the other states 0, since California alone has more than half the votes.\n\nFive companies (A, B, C, D, E) sign an agreement for the creation of a monopoly. The size of the market is \"X\" = 54 million units per year (e.g. petroleum barrels) for a monopoly. The maximum production capacity of these companies is A = 44, B = 32, C = 20, D = 8 and E = 4 million units per year. Therefore, there is a set of coalitions able to provide the 54 million units necessary for the monopoly, and a set of coalitions unable to provide that number. In each of the sufficient coalitions one may have necessary members (for the coalition to provide the required production) and unnecessary members (underlined in the table below). Even when \"one\" of these unnecessary members goes out of the sufficient coalition that coalition is able to provide the required production. However, when \"one\" necessary member leaves, the sufficient coalition becomes insufficient. The monopoly's profit to be distributed among the coalition's members is 100 million dollars per year.\n\nThe Penrose–Banzhaf index may be applied to the calculation of the Shapley value, which provides a basis for a distribution of the profit for each player in the game in proportion to the number of sufficient coalitions in which that player is necessary. The player A is necessary for 10 of the 16 sufficient coalitions, B is necessary for 6, C also for 6, D for 2 and E for 2. Therefore, A is necessary in 38.5% of the total cases (26 = 10 + 6 + 6 + 2 + 2, so 10/26 = 0.385), B in 23.1%, C in 23.1%, D in 7.7% and E in 7.7% (these are the Banzhaf indexes for each company). The distribution of the 100 millions of monopoly profits under the Shapley value's criterion has to follow those proportions.\n\nWhat is known today as the Banzhaf power index was originally introduced by Lionel Penrose in 1946 and went largely forgotten. It was reinvented by John F. Banzhaf III in 1965, but it had to be reinvented once more by James Samuel Coleman in 1971 before it became part of the mainstream literature.\n\nBanzhaf wanted to prove objectively that the Nassau County board's voting system was unfair. As given in \"Game Theory and Strategy\", votes were allocated as follows:\n\n\nThis is 30 total votes, and a simple majority of 16 votes was required for a measure to pass.\n\nIn Banzhaf's notation, [Hempstead #1, Hempstead #2, North Hempstead, Oyster Bay, Glen Cove, Long Beach] are A-F in [16; 9, 9, 7, 3, 1, 1]\n\nThere are 32 winning coalitions, and 48 swing votes:\n\nAB AC BC ABC ABD ABE ABF ACD ACE ACF BCD BCE BCF ABCD ABCE ABCF ABDE ABDF ABEF ACDE ACDF ACEF BCDE BCDF BCEF ABCDE ABCDF ABCEF ABDEF ACDEF BCDEF ABCDEF\n\nThe Banzhaf index gives these values:\n\n\nBanzhaf argued that a voting arrangement that gives 0% of the power to 16% of the population is unfair.\n\nToday, the Banzhaf power index is an accepted way to measure voting power, along with the alternative Shapley–Shubik power index. Both measures have been applied to the analysis of voting in the Council of the European Union.\n\nHowever, Banzhaf's analysis has been critiqued as treating votes like coin-flips, and an empirical model of voting rather than a random voting model as used by Banzhaf brings different results.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11901968", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11901968", "title": "Big Money Rustlas", "text": "Big Money Rustlas\n\nBig Money Rustlas is an American Western comedy film directed by Paul Andresen. The film is the prequel to the 2001 film \"Big Money Hustlas\". Joseph Bruce wrote the story, and he, Andresen, and Studebaker Duchamp adapted the story into a screenplay. Their writing was influenced by classic Western films, classic Warner Bros. cartoons, and the film \"Blazing Saddles\".\n\nGambling tycoon Big Baby Chips (Joseph Bruce), along with his assistants Raw Stank (Jamie Spaniolo) and Dusty Poot (Monoxide), run the downtrodden town of Mud Bug through extortion and violence. Sheriff Sugar Wolf (Joseph Utsler) arrives in town to confront Big Baby Chips, redeem his family name, and save the town. The film's tagline is \"The Good, the Bad, and the ... Outrageous,\" a parody of the film \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\". \"Big Money Rustlas\" was released direct-to-video on August 17, 2010.\n\nSheriff Sugar Wolf (Utsler) returns to his hometown after many years to find that it has been taken over by Big Baby Chips (Bruce), a ruthless gambling tycoon who have run the downtrodden town of Mud Bug with his gang of thugs, which include Raw Stank (Jamie Madrox) and Dusty Poot (Monoxide), since killing Sugar Wolf's father, Grizzly Wolf (Ron Jeremy), and Sugar's brothers. Sugar decides to take over the position his father once held, leading Big Baby Chips to pit Sugar against a series of deadly assassins.\n\nSugar Wolf begins to successfully dispatch of his would-be assassins, winning the approval of the townfolk, begins a romance with Tink (Bridget Powerz), a little person and takes on a deputy, Bucky (Mewes). After Sugar Wolf jails Raw Stank and Dusty Poot, Big Baby Chips calls in his deadliest assassin, which turns out to be Tink, who, in reality, is a bearded man in drag, Tank (Jody Sadler), who cripples Sugar Wolf's shooting hand. Dirty Sanchez (Mark Jury), a former rival of Big Baby Chips, whose hands had been crippled by Big Baby Chips, trains Sugar Wolf to fight with his other hand. Sugar Wolf challenges Big Baby Chips to a showdown, and guns down the gambler, who reveals himself to be Grizzly Wolf.\n\n\nThe film's director, Paul Andresen, had previously worked with Joseph Bruce and Joseph Utsler on the long form music video \"Bowling Balls\". Andresen was enthusiastic to work on the film because of previous experiences with Psychopathic Records, and Bruce's sense of humor. Paul Methric described the production as being more organized than that of \"Big Money Hustlas\". According to Methric, \"The first one was, let's shoot it 45 times, then shoot it another 45 times, where this one the guys knew exactly what we needed, and we got in there and got it.\"\n\nIn an interview for Pro Wrestling Torch's \"Torch Daily Blitz\", Bruce stated that the release of \"Big Money Rustlas\" was delayed from its original 2009 release to early 2010 due to extra post-production. He said that the Psychopathic Video department was still trying to learn how to work in the film industry. To better improve the quality of the film, Bruce said that Psychopathic Video had hired people from within the film industry to help with production.\n\nBruce and Utsler had a negative experience with the New York style of production and \"asshole art film crews\" while filming of \"Big Money Hustlas\". Following the release of the movie, the two made plans to produce a Western prequel, which would be filmed in California in order to avoid the previous issues. In the packaging of their 2000 album \"Bizaar\", Insane Clown Posse released an image of what would later be the characters Raw Stank and Dusty Poot.\n\nBruce and Utsler continued to talk about the movie over the next eight years, though no actions were taken to start pre-production of the film. The two were encouraged to move forward with the production of \"Big Money Rustlas\" after starring in the 2008 film \"Death Racers\". According to Bruce, \"We knew we could do better and we'd have a way bigger budget. And we thought, 'We can pull this off.'\"\n\nIn 2008, Bruce wrote the original screenplay for \"Big Money Rustlas\" in a two-week span while touring in support of Dark Lotus' \"The Opaque Brotherhood\" album. Bruce's original screenplay was only 40 pages long; director Paul Andresen and screenwriter Studebaker Duchamp expanded the screenplay to 70 pages. Andresen states that the film was influenced by classic Western films and classic Warner Bros. cartoons. Bruce stated that he loved the Man with No Name Trilogy, as well as Mel Brooks' \"Blazing Saddles\", and that the latter was a strong influence on \"Big Money Rustlas\", due to its comedic anachronisms. Andresen and Bruce wanted the film to place more emphasis on humor than the over-the-top violence that Insane Clown Posse's music is known for.\n\nThe film follows a similar casting style to the first film \"Big Money Hustlas\". In addition to the main cast, cameos include musicians Blaze, Mike E. Clark, DJ Clay, Anybody Killa, Bonez Dubb and Otis of Axe Murder Boyz, Daddy X and Taxman of Kottonmouth Kings, Daddy Long Legs and Buddha of Wolfpac, Awesome Dre, The Jesus Lizard vocalist David Yow, and Vanilla Ice, professional wrestlers Corporal Robinson, Terry Brunk, Scott Hall, Scott D'Amore, Jimmy Hart, and Joe Doering. Established actors who appear include Jason Mewes, Dustin Diamond, Tom Sizemore, Todd Bridges, Jimmie Walker, and Brigitte Nielsen.\n\nViolent J, Shaggy 2 Dope, Jamie Madrox, Monoxide, and Jumpsteady were cast to reprise ancestral versions of their roles from \"Big Money Hustlas\". The role of Dirty Sanchez was originally written for Scott Hall. The part was later given to Mark Jury, who had worked with director Paul Andresen and Insane Clown Posse twice before. As with the first film, Wolf's love interest was played by a pornographic actress, Bridget Powerz, and his sidekick was played by an established actor, Jason Mewes.\n\nThe role of Sugar Wolf offered Shaggy 2 Dope much more room for improvisation than there had been in playing Sugar Bear in \"Big Money Hustlas\", where all of his dialogue had to be performed in Dolemite-style rhymes; Shaggy 2 Dope was unsatisfied that he was unable to improvise in that film for this reason.\n\nFilming began in mid-January 2009 at Paramount Ranch in the Santa Monica Mountains, California, and concluded on February 24, 2009. The film's budget was $1.5 million. During filming, Joseph Bruce was harassed by a police officer due to local law enforcement's classification of Juggalos as a gang.\n\nThe film's trailer premiered at the 10th annual Gathering of the Juggalos, where it was screened twice. Bruce and Utsler plan to tour theaters around the country to screen the film. Bruce also announced that the film would be sent in to multiple film festivals. The film premiered at The Fillmore Detroit on January 23, 2010. The DVD was released locally at the 11th annual Gathering of the Juggalos, and nationally on August 17, 2010.\n\n"}

It is the first of the Brian Lara Cricket series to be released on a portable console.\n\nGameplay is much the same as Brian Lara International Cricket 2007 but is lacking most game modes apart from the ICC Cricket World Cup 2007. As with Brian Lara International Cricket 2007, BLPP introduces a number of slight improvements over the previous version. Examples include the ability to return the ball to either end of the pitch, and the option to simulate an over, an innings, or an entire game. However, unlike Brian Lara International Cricket 2007, there is no ability to play sweep shots, or to charge down the wicket. It is thus impossible to be stumped while batting in this game.\nBLPP has a score of 68, \"mixed or average reviews\" on Metacritic. A GameSpot reviewer highlights the lack of gameplay modes causing the game to lack longevity. In the same review, the graphics are praised for having smooth and natural animations, but the closeups of the players look strange as their heads look oversized. Other critics brought attention to the AI, which they said is the same independent of the difficulty settings that the player puts the game in. Despite the mixed or average reviews, BLPP went into the game charts straight to position 1 in its first week. Also, reviewers cited long load times as there are loading times to enter a match, after the coin toss, after each over and bowling change.\n\nThe following are scores collected by GameRankings which give the game an average ratio of 71%.\n\nAlthough the game is made in Europe Brian Lara 2007 Pressure Play is able to be played on any region PSP.\n"}
{"id": "275882", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=275882", "title": "Cameo appearance", "text": "Cameo appearance\n\nA cameo role or cameo appearance (; often shortened to just cameo) is a brief appearance or voice part of a known person in a work of the performing arts. These roles are generally small, many of them non-speaking ones, and are commonly either appearances in a work in which they hold some special significance (such as actors from an original movie appearing in its remake) or renowned people making uncredited appearances. Short appearances by celebrities, film directors, politicians, athletes or musicians are common. A crew member of the movie or show playing a minor role can be referred to as a cameo as well, such as Alfred Hitchcock's frequently performed cameos.\n\nOriginally \"cameo role\" meant \"a small character part that stands out from the other minor parts\". The Oxford English Dictionary connects this with the meaning \"a short literary sketch or portrait\", which is based on the literal meaning of \"cameo\", a miniature carving on a gemstone. More recently, \"cameo\" has come to refer to any short appearances, as a character, such as the examples below.\n\nCameos are generally not credited because of their brevity, or a perceived mismatch between the celebrity's stature and the film or television series in which they are appearing. Many are publicity stunts. Others are acknowledgments of an actor's contribution to an earlier work, as in the case of many film adaptations of television series, or of remakes of earlier films. Others honour artists or celebrities known for work in a particular field.\n\nPossibly the best-known series of cameos was by Alfred Hitchcock, who made very brief appearances in most of his films.\n\nCameos also occur in novels and other literary works. “Literary cameos” usually involve an established character from another work who makes a brief appearance to establish a shared universe setting, to make a point, or to offer homage. Balzac often employed this practice, as in his \"Comédie humaine\". Sometimes a cameo features a historical person who \"drops in\" on fictional characters in a historical novel, as when Benjamin Franklin shares a beer with Phillipe Charboneau in \"The Bastard\" by John Jakes.\n\nA cameo appearance can be made by the author of a work to put a sort of personal \"signature\" on a story. Vladimir Nabokov often put himself in his novels; for instance, the very minor character Vivian Darkbloom (an anagram of the author's name) in \"Lolita\".\nQuentin Tarantino provides cameos or small roles in at least 10 of his movies.\n\nLikewise, Peter Jackson has made brief cameos in all of his movies, except for his first feature-length film \"Bad Taste\" in which he plays a main character, as well as \"\", though a portrait of him appears in the film. For example, he plays a peasant eating a carrot in \"\" and \"\"; a Rohan warrior in \"\" and a Corsair of Umbar boatswain in \"\". All four were non-speaking \"blink and you miss him\" appearances, although in the Extended Release of \"The Return of the King\", his character was given more screen time and his reprise of the carrot eating peasant in The Desolation of Smaug was featured in the foreground in reference to The Fellowship of the Ring - last seen twelve years earlier.\n\nDirector Martin Scorsese appears in the background of his films as a bystander or an unseen character. In \"Who's That Knocking at My Door\" (1967), he appears as one of the gangsters; he is a lighting crewman in \"After Hours\" (1985) and a passenger in \"Taxi Driver\" (1976). He opens up his film \"The Color of Money\" (1986) with a monologue on the art of playing pool. In addition, he appears with his wife and daughter as wealthy New Yorkers in \"Gangs of New York\", and he appears as a theatre-goer and is heard as a movie projectionist in \"The Aviator\" (2004).\n\nIn a same way, Roman Polanski appears as a hired hoodlum in his film \"Chinatown\" (1974), slitting Jack Nicholson's nose with the blade of his clasp knife.\nDirectors sometimes cast well-known lead actors with whom they have worked in the past in other films. Mike Todd's film \"Around the World in 80 Days\" (1956) was filled with cameo roles: John Gielgud as an English butler, Frank Sinatra playing piano in a saloon, and others. The stars in cameo roles were pictured in oval insets in posters for the film, and gave the term wide circulation outside the theatrical profession.\n\n\"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\" (1963), an \"epic comedy\", also features cameos from nearly every popular American comedian alive at the time, including The Three Stooges, Jerry Lewis, a silent appearance by Buster Keaton and a voice-only cameo by Selma Diamond.\n\nProlific writer Aaron Sorkin also have cameos in some films which he scribes. Like as a bar customer speaking about law in his debut film screenplay \"A Few Good Men\" (1992). As an advertising executive in the Fincher helmed The Social Network or as à guest at the inauguration of President Matt Santos in final episode \"Tomorrow\" of his created television series \"The West Wing\".\n\nFranco Nero, the actor who portrayed the Django character in the original 1966 film appears in a bar scene of the Tarantino film \"Django Unchained\"; where he asked Django (immaculately played by Jamie Foxx) to spell his name, which births the famous promotional tagline for the film - \"The 'D' is silent\"\n\nAmong the many cameos featured in \"Maverick\" (1994), (directed by Richard Donner), Danny Glover (Mel Gibson's co-star in the \"Lethal Weapon\" franchise of films also directed by Donner) appears as the lead bank robber. He and Maverick (Gibson) share a scene where they look as if they knew each other, but then shake it off. As Glover makes his escape with the money, he mutters \"I'm too old for this shit\", his character's catchphrase in the \"Lethal Weapon\" film series. In addition, a strain of the main theme from \"Lethal Weapon\" plays in the score when Glover is revealed. Actress Margot Kidder made a cameo appearance in the same film as a robbed villager, and the actress previously starred as Lois Lane in one of Donner's earlier films \"Superman\" (1978).\n\nBen Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson, Luke Wilson and Will Ferrell have made appearances in so many of the same films (whether as lead characters or cameos) \"USA Today\" coined the term the \"Frat Pack\" to name the group. Actor Adam Sandler is also known for frequently casting fellow \"Saturday Night Live\" performers (including Rob Schneider and David Spade) in various roles in his films (as well as making cameo appearances of his own in theirs, most of which he co-produces). Sam Raimi frequently uses his brother Ted and Bruce Campbell in his films.\n\nThe American singer/actress Cher has done a couple of cameos over the years. She did two cameos in \"Will & Grace\" and she even did a few in the 1990s.\n\nActor Edward Norton appears as himself in the satirical film \"The Dictator\" which stars Sacha Baron Cohen.\n\nAn extended cameo of ace actor Al Pacino is seen in the Adam Sandler starring film \"Jack and Jill\" where [Pacino] plays a fictionalised version of himself.\n\nThe mangaka Shotaro Ishinomori made many cameos in his Kamen Rider series.\n\nThe animated series \"Adventures of Tintin\" featured its author Hergé in all the episodes.\n\n\"An Adventure in Space and Time\", a drama about how the \"Doctor Who\" began, features many actors from the show's past, including two past companions in a party scene, another as a mother calling her children in for dinner and a fourth in a car park at the BBC.\nFilms based on actual events occasionally include cameo guest appearances by the people portrayed in them. In \"The Pursuit of Happyness\", Chris Gardner makes a cameo at the end. \"24 Hour Party People\", a film about Tony Wilson, has a cameo by the real Tony Wilson and many other notable people. In the film \"Apollo 13\", James Lovell (the real commander of that flight) and his wife Marilyn appear next to the actors playing them (Tom Hanks and Kathleen Quinlan respectively). Domino Harvey makes a short appearance in the credits of \"Domino\", while the real Erin Brockovich has a cameo appearance as a waitress named Julia in the eponymous movie (where her role is played by actress Julia Roberts). In a flashback sequence in \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\", Raoul Duke (played by Johnny Depp) runs into the real life Hunter S. Thompson, upon whom the character of Duke is based, leading him to remark \"There I was...mother of God, there I am! Holy fuck.\"\n\nTom Morello, American guitarist and musician, makes an appearance in the Marvel film \"Iron Man\" (2008), in which he also participated in the soundtrack.\n\nElon Musk and Larry Ellison, both founders of large technology companies, are featured in cameos in the blockbuster, \"Iron Man 2\" (2010).\n\nThe king of Sweden, Carl XVI Gustaf, was in the children's program \"Mika\" \"(Mika och renen Ossian på äventyr)\" when Mika was in Stockholm with his reindeer.\nIn \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" (2013), the real Jordan Belfort appears as an emcee to introduce Leonardo DiCaprio (who plays Belfort in the film) at the final scene.\n\n"}

{"id": "52813", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52813", "title": "Dialectic", "text": "Dialectic\n\nDialectic or dialectics (, \"dialektikḗ\"; related to dialogue), also known as the dialectical method, is at base a discourse between two or more people holding different points of view about a subject but wishing to establish the truth through reasoned arguments. Dialectic resembles debate, but the concept excludes subjective elements such as emotional appeal and the modern pejorative sense of rhetoric. Dialectic may be contrasted with the didactic method, wherein one side of the conversation teaches the other. Dialectic is alternatively known as minor logic, as opposed to major logic or critique.\n\nWithin Hegelianism, the word \"dialectic\" has the specialised meaning of a contradiction between ideas that serves as the determining factor in their relationship. Dialectic comprises three stages of development: first, a thesis or statement of an idea, which gives rise to a second step, a reaction or antithesis that contradicts or negates the thesis, and third, the synthesis, a statement through which the differences between the two points is resolved. Dialectical materialism, a theory or set of theories produced mainly by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, adapted the Hegelian dialectic into arguments regarding traditional materialism.\n\nDialectic tends to imply a \"process\" of evolution and so does not naturally fit within formal logic (see logic and dialectic). This process is particularly marked in Hegelian dialectic and even more so in Marxist dialectic which may rely on the evolution of ideas over longer time periods in the real world; dialectical logic attempts to address this.\n\nIn classical philosophy, dialectic () is a form of reasoning based upon dialogue of arguments and counter-arguments, advocating \"propositions\" (theses) and \"counter-propositions\" (antitheses). The outcome of such a dialectic might be the refutation of a relevant proposition, or of a synthesis, or a combination of the opposing assertions, or a qualitative improvement of the dialogue.\n\nMoreover, the term \"dialectic\" owes much of its prestige to its role in the philosophies of Socrates and Plato, in the Greek Classical period (5th to 4th centuries BCE). Aristotle said that it was the pre-Socratic philosopher Zeno of Elea who invented dialectic, of which the dialogues of Plato are the examples of the Socratic dialectical method.\n\nAccording to Kant, however, the ancient Greeks used the word \"dialectic\" to signify the logic of false appearance or semblance. To the Ancients, \"it was nothing but the logic of illusion. It was a sophistic art of giving to one's ignorance, indeed even to one's intentional tricks, the outward appearance of truth, by imitating the thorough, accurate method which logic always requires, and by using its topic as a cloak for every empty assertion.\"\n\nThe Socratic dialogues are a particular form of dialectic known as the method of elenchus (literally, \"refutation, scrutiny\") whereby a series of questions clarifies a more precise statement of a vague belief, logical consequences of that statement are explored, and a contradiction is discovered. The method is largely destructive, in that false belief is exposed and only constructive in that this exposure may lead to further search for truth. The detection of error does not amount to a proof of the antithesis; for example, a contradiction in the consequences of a definition of \"piety\" does not provide a correct definition. The principal aim of Socratic activity may be to improve the soul of the interlocutors, by freeing them from unrecognized errors; or indeed, by teaching them the spirit of inquiry.\n\nIn common cases, Socrates used enthymemes as the foundation of his argument.\n\nFor example, in the \"Euthyphro\", Socrates asks Euthyphro to provide a definition of piety. Euthyphro replies that the pious is that which is loved by the gods. But, Socrates also has Euthyphro agreeing that the gods are quarrelsome and their quarrels, like human quarrels, concern objects of love or hatred. Therefore, Socrates reasons, at least one thing exists that certain gods love but other gods hate. Again, Euthyphro agrees. Socrates concludes that if Euthyphro's definition of piety is acceptable, then there must exist at least one thing that is both pious and impious (as it is both loved and hated by the gods)—which Euthyphro admits is absurd. Thus, Euthyphro is brought to a realization by this dialectical method that his definition of piety is not sufficiently meaningful.\n\nFor example, in Plato's Gorgias, dialectic occurs between Socrates, the Sophist Gorgias, and two men, Polus and Callicles. Because Socrates' ultimate goal was to reach true knowledge, he was even willing to change his own views in order to arrive at the truth. The fundamental goal of dialectic, in this instance, was to establish a precise definition of the subject (in this case, rhetoric) and with the use of argumentation and questioning, make the subject even more precise. In the Gorgias, Socrates reaches the truth by asking a series of questions and in return, receiving short, clear answers.\nThere is another interpretation of the dialectic, as a method of intuition suggested in The Republic. Simon Blackburn writes that the dialectic in this sense is used to understand \"the total process of enlightenment, whereby the philosopher is educated so as to achieve knowledge of the supreme good, the Form of the Good\".\n\nAristotle stresses that rhetoric is closely related to dialectic. He offers several formulas to describe this affinity between the two disciplines: first of all, rhetoric is said to be a “counterpart” (antistrophos) to dialectic (Rhet. I.1, 1354a1); (ii) it is also called an “outgrowth” (paraphues ti) of dialectic and the study of character (Rhet. I.2, 1356a25f.); finally, Aristotle says that rhetoric is part of dialectic and resembles it (Rhet. I.2, 1356a30f.). In saying that rhetoric is a counterpart to dialectic, Aristotle obviously alludes to Plato's Gorgias (464bff.), where rhetoric is ironically defined as a counterpart to cookery in the soul. Since, in this passage, Plato uses the word ‘antistrophos’ to designate an analogy, it is likely that Aristotle wants to express a kind of analogy too: what dialectic is for the (private or academic) practice of attacking and maintaining an argument, rhetoric is for the (public) practice of defending oneself or accusing an opponent. The analogy to dialectic has important implications for the status of rhetoric. Plato argued in his Gorgias that rhetoric cannot be an art (technê), since it is not related to a definite subject, while real arts are defined by their specific subjects, as e.g. medicine or shoemaking are defined by their products, i.e., health and shoes.\n\nLogic, which could be considered to include dialectic, was one of the three liberal arts taught in medieval universities as part of the trivium; the other elements were rhetoric and grammar.\n\nBased mainly on Aristotle, the first medieval philosopher to work on dialectics was Boethius (480–524). After him, many scholastic philosophers also made use of dialectics in their works, such as Abelard, William of Sherwood, Garlandus Compotista, Walter Burley, Roger Swyneshed, William of Ockham, and Thomas Aquinas.\n\nThis dialectic (a \"quaestio disputata\") was formed as follows:\n\nThe concept of dialectics was given new life by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (following Johann Gottlieb Fichte), whose dialectically synthetic model of nature and of history made it, as it were, a fundamental aspect of the nature of reality (instead of regarding the contradictions into which dialectics leads as a sign of the sterility of the dialectical method, as Immanuel Kant tended to do in his \"Critique of Pure Reason\"). In the mid-19th century, the concept of \"dialectic\" was appropriated by Karl Marx (see, for example, \"Das Kapital\", published in 1867) and Friedrich Engels and retooled in a dynamic, nonidealistic manner. It would also become a crucial part of later representations of Marxism as a philosophy of dialectical materialism. These representations often contrasted dramatically and led to vigorous debate among different Marxist groupings, leading some prominent Marxists to give up on the idea of dialectics completely.\n\nHegelian dialectic, usually presented in a threefold manner, was stated by Heinrich Moritz Chalybäus as comprising three dialectical stages of development: a thesis, giving rise to its reaction; an antithesis, which contradicts or negates the thesis; and the tension between the two being resolved by means of a synthesis. In more simplistic terms, one can consider it thus: problem → reaction → solution. Although this model is often named after Hegel, he himself never used that specific formulation. Hegel ascribed that terminology to Kant. Carrying on Kant's work, Fichte greatly elaborated on the synthesis model and popularized it.\n\nOn the other hand, Hegel did use a three-valued logical model that is very similar to the antithesis model, but Hegel's most usual terms were: Abstract-Negative-Concrete. Hegel used this writing model as a backbone to accompany his points in many of his works.\n\nThe formula, thesis-antithesis-synthesis, does not explain why the thesis requires an antithesis. However, the formula, abstract-negative-concrete, suggests a flaw, or perhaps an incompleteness, in any initial thesis—it is too abstract and lacks the negative of trial, error, and experience. For Hegel, the concrete, the synthesis, the absolute, must always pass through the phase of the negative, in the journey to completion, that is, mediation. This is the essence of what is popularly called Hegelian dialectics.\n\nAccording to the German philosopher Walter Kaufmann: Fichte introduced into German philosophy the three-step of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis, using these three terms. Schelling took up this terminology. \"Hegel did not.\" He never once used these three terms together to designate three stages in an argument or account in any of his books. And they do not help us understand his \"Phenomenology\", his \"Logic\", or his philosophy of history; they impede any open-minded comprehension of what he does by forcing it into a scheme which was available to him and which he deliberately spurned [...] The mechanical formalism [...] Hegel derides expressly and at some length in the preface to the \"Phenomenology\".\n\nKaufmann also cites Hegel's criticism of the triad model commonly misattributed to him, adding that \"the only place where Hegel uses the three terms together occurs in his lectures on the history of philosophy, on the last page but one of the section on Kant—where Hegel roundly reproaches Kant for having 'everywhere posited thesis, antithesis, synthesis'\".\n\nTo describe the activity of overcoming the negative, Hegel also often used the term \"Aufhebung\", variously translated into English as \"sublation\" or \"overcoming,\" to conceive of the working of the dialectic. Roughly, the term indicates preserving the useful portion of an idea, thing, society, etc., while moving beyond its limitations. (Jacques Derrida's preferred French translation of the term was \"relever\".)\n\nIn the \"Logic\", for instance, Hegel describes a dialectic of existence: first, existence must be posited as pure Being (\"Sein\"); but pure Being, upon examination, is found to be indistinguishable from Nothing (\"Nichts\"). When it is realized that what is coming into being is, at the same time, also returning to nothing (in life, for example, one's living is also a dying), both Being and Nothing are united as Becoming.\n\nAs in the Socratic dialectic, Hegel claimed to proceed by making implicit contradictions explicit: each stage of the process is the product of contradictions inherent or implicit in the preceding stage. For Hegel, the whole of history is one tremendous dialectic, major stages of which chart a progression from self-alienation as slavery to self-unification and realization as the rational constitutional state of free and equal citizens. The Hegelian dialectic cannot be mechanically applied for any chosen thesis. Critics argue that the selection of any antithesis, other than the logical negation of the thesis, is subjective. Then, if the logical negation is used as the antithesis, there is no rigorous way to derive a synthesis. In practice, when an antithesis is selected to suit the user's subjective purpose, the resulting \"contradictions\" are rhetorical, not logical, and the resulting synthesis is not rigorously defensible against a multitude of other possible syntheses. The problem with the Fichtean \"thesis–antithesis–synthesis\" model is that it implies that contradictions or negations come from outside of things. Hegel's point is that they are inherent in and internal to things. This conception of dialectics derives ultimately from Heraclitus.\n\nHegel stated that the purpose of dialectics is \"to study things in their own being and movement and thus to demonstrate the finitude of the partial categories of understanding.\"\n\nOne important dialectical principle for Hegel is the transition from quantity to quality, which he terms the Measure. The measure is the qualitative quantum, the quantum is the existence of quantity. \n\nAs an example, Hegel mentions the states of aggregation of water: \"Thus the temperature of water is, in the first place, a point of no consequence in respect of its liquidity: still with the increase or diminution of the temperature of the liquid water, there comes a point where this state of cohesion suffers a qualitative change, and the water is converted into steam or ice\". As other examples Hegel mentions the reaching of a point where a single additional grain makes a heap of wheat; or where the bald tail is produced, if we continue plucking out single hairs.\n\nAnother important principle for Hegel is the negation of the negation, which he also terms \"Aufhebung\" (sublation): Something is only what it is in its relation to another, but by the negation of the negation this something incorporates the other into itself. The dialectical movement involves two moments that negate each other, something and its other. As a result of the negation of the negation, \"something becomes its other; this other is itself something; therefore it likewise becomes an other, and so on ad infinitum\". Something in its passage into other only joins with itself, it is self-related. In becoming there are two moments: coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be: by sublation, i.e., negation of the negation, being passes over into nothing, it ceases to be, but something new shows up, is coming to be. What is sublated (\"aufgehoben\") on the one hand ceases to be and is put to an end, but on the other hand it is preserved and maintained. In dialectics, a totality transforms itself; it is self-related, then self-forgetful, relieving the original tension.\n\nMarxist dialectic is a form of Hegelian dialectic which applies to the study of historical materialism. It purports to be a reflection of the real world created by man. Dialectic would thus be a robust method under which one could examine personal, social, and economic behaviors. Marxist dialectic is the core foundation of the philosophy of dialectical materialism, which forms the basis of the ideas behind historical materialism.\n\nKarl Marx and Friedrich Engels proposed that Hegel's dialectic is too abstract: \n\nIn contradiction to Hegelian idealism, Marx presented his own dialectic method, which he claims to be \"direct opposite\" of Hegel's method: \n\nIn Marxism, the dialectical method of historical study became intertwined with historical materialism, the school of thought exemplified by the works of Marx, Engels, and Vladimir Lenin. In the USSR, under Joseph Stalin, Marxist dialectics became \"diamat\" (short for dialectical materialism), a theory emphasizing the primacy of the material way of life; social \"praxis\" over all forms of social consciousness; and the secondary, dependent character of the \"ideal\". The term \"dialectical materialism\" was coined by the 19th-century social theorist Joseph Dietzgen who used the theory to explain the nature of socialism and social development. The original populariser of Marxism in Russia, Georgi Plekhanov used the terms \"dialectical materialism\" and \"historical materialism\" interchangeably. For Lenin, the primary feature of Marx's \"dialectical materialism\" (Lenin's term) was its application of materialist philosophy to history and social sciences. Lenin's main input in the philosophy of dialectical materialism was his theory of reflection, which presented human consciousness as a dynamic reflection of the objective material world that fully shapes its contents and structure. Later, Stalin's works on the subject established a rigid and formalistic division of Marxist–Leninist theory in the dialectical materialism and historical materialism parts. While the first was supposed to be the key method and theory of the philosophy of nature, the second was the Soviet version of the philosophy of history.\n\nA dialectical method was fundamental to Marxist politics, e.g., the works of Karl Korsch, Georg Lukács and certain members of the Frankfurt School. Soviet academics, notably Evald Ilyenkov and Zaid Orudzhev, continued pursuing unorthodox philosophic study of Marxist dialectics; likewise in the West, notably the philosopher Bertell Ollman at New York University.\n\nFriedrich Engels proposed that Nature is dialectical, thus, in Anti-Dühring he said that the negation of negation is: \n\nIn \"Dialectics of Nature\", Engels said: \n\nMarxist dialectics is exemplified in \"Das Kapital\" (Capital), which outlines two central theories: (i) surplus value and (ii) the materialist conception of history; Marx explains dialectical materialism: \n\nClass struggle is the primary contradiction to be resolved by Marxist dialectics, because of its central role in the social and political lives of a society. Nonetheless, Marx and Marxists developed the concept of class struggle to comprehend the dialectical contradictions between mental and manual labor, and between town and country. Hence, philosophic contradiction is central to the development of dialectics the progress from quantity to quality, the acceleration of gradual social change; the negation of the initial development of the \"status quo\"; the negation of that negation; and the high-level recurrence of features of the original \"status quo\". In the USSR, Progress Publishers issued anthologies of dialectical materialism by Lenin, wherein he also quotes Marx and Engels: \n\nLenin describes his dialectical understanding of the concept of \"development\": \n\nDialectical naturalism is a term coined by American philosopher Murray Bookchin to describe the philosophical underpinnings of the political program of social ecology. Dialectical naturalism explores the complex interrelationship between social problems, and the direct consequences they have on the ecological impact of human society. Bookchin offered dialectical naturalism as a contrast to what he saw as the \"empyrean, basically antinaturalistic dialectical idealism\" of Hegel, and \"the wooden, often scientistic dialectical materialism of orthodox Marxists\".\n\nNeo-orthodoxy, in Europe also known as theology of crisis and dialectical theology, is an approach to theology in Protestantism that was developed in the aftermath of the First World War (1914–1918). It is characterized as a reaction against doctrines of 19th-century liberal theology and a more positive reevaluation of the teachings of the Reformation, much of which had been in decline (especially in western Europe) since the late 18th century. It is primarily associated with two Swiss professors and pastors, Karl Barth (1886–1968) and Emil Brunner (1899–1966), even though Barth himself expressed his unease in the use of the term.\n\nIn dialectical theology the difference and opposition between God and human beings is stressed in such a way that all human attempts at overcoming this opposition through moral, religious or philosophical idealism must be characterized as 'sin'. In the death of Christ humanity is negated and overcome, but this judgment also points forwards to the resurrection in which humanity is reestablished in Christ. For Barth this meant that only through God's 'no' to everything human can his 'yes' be perceived. Applied to traditional themes of Protestant theology, such as double predestination, this means that election and reprobation cannot be viewed as a quantitative limitation of God's action. Rather it must be seen as its \"qualitative definition\". As Christ bore the rejection as well as the election of God for all humanity, every person is subject to both aspects of God's double predestination.\n\nDialectics has become central to continental philosophy, but it plays no part in Anglo-American philosophy. In other words, on the continent of Europe, dialectics has entered intellectual culture as what might be called a legitimate part of thought and philosophy, whereas in America and Britain, the dialectic plays no discernible part in the intellectual culture, which instead tends toward positivism. A prime example of the European tradition is Jean-Paul Sartre's \"Critique of Dialectical Reason\", which is very different from the works of Popper, whose philosophy was for a time highly influential in the UK where he resided (see below). Sartre states:\n\nKarl Popper has attacked the dialectic repeatedly. In 1937, he wrote and delivered a paper entitled \"What Is Dialectic?\" in which he attacked the dialectical method for its willingness \"to put up with contradictions\". Popper concluded the essay with these words: \"The whole development of dialectic should be a warning against the dangers inherent in philosophical system-building. It should remind us that philosophy should not be made a basis for any sort of scientific system and that philosophers should be much more modest in their claims. One task which they can fulfill quite usefully is the study of the critical methods of science\" (Ibid., p. 335).\n\nIn chapter 12 of volume 2 of \"The Open Society and Its Enemies\" (1944; 5th rev. ed., 1966), Popper unleashed a famous attack on Hegelian dialectics in which he held that Hegel's thought (unjustly in the view of some philosophers, such as Walter Kaufmann) was to some degree responsible for facilitating the rise of fascism in Europe by encouraging and justifying irrationalism. In section 17 of his 1961 \"addenda\" to \"The Open Society\", entitled \"Facts, Standards and Truth: A Further Criticism of Relativism\", Popper refused to moderate his criticism of the Hegelian dialectic, arguing that it \"played a major role in the downfall of the liberal movement in Germany [...] by contributing to historicism and to an identification of might and right, encouraged totalitarian modes of thought. [...] [And] undermined and eventually lowered the traditional standards of intellectual responsibility and honesty\".\n\nThe philosopher of science and physicist Mario Bunge repeatedly criticized Hegelian and Marxian dialectics, calling them \"fuzzy and remote from science\" and a \"disastrous legacy\". He concluded: \"The so-called laws of dialectics, such as formulated by Engels (1940, 1954) and Lenin (1947, 1981), are false insofar as they are intelligible.\"\n\nIn the past few decades, European and American logicians have attempted to provide mathematical foundations for dialectical logic or argument. There had been pre-formal and partially-formal treatises on argument and dialectic, from authors such as Stephen Toulmin (\"The Uses of Argument\"), Nicholas Rescher (\"Dialectics\"), and van Eemeren and Grootendorst (pragma-dialectics). One can include the communities of informal logic and paraconsistent logic. However, building on theories of defeasible reasoning (see John L. Pollock), systems have been built that define well-formedness of arguments, rules governing the process of introducing arguments based on fixed assumptions, and rules for shifting burden. Many of these logics appear in the special area of artificial intelligence and law, though the computer scientists' interest in formalizing dialectic originates in a desire to build decision support and computer-supported collaborative work systems.\n\n\n\n"}

In World War II he became a Flakhelfer of the Luftwaffe but after four months was conscripted to the German Wehrmacht, in the same role.\n\nIn June 2007, a year after the Günter Grass Waffen-SS revelations, documents were released which showed that some prominent German intellectuals like Siegfried Lenz, Martin Walser and Dieter Hildebrandt had been members of the Nazi Party. For all three the documents showed their membership at a young age, during a late stage of the fascist regime in Germany – Hildebrandt's application was dated 19 February 1944 (when Hildebrandt was still 16) and he was admitted on 20 April 1944, Hitler's 55th birthday. Both Lenz and Hildebrandt said they were unaware of having written an application, and unaware that they became a member of the Nazi Party in 1944. Historians like Norbert Frei and Götz Aly said in that context that some local Nazi party leaders might have written mass applications to the party without the knowledge of the supposed applicants.\n\nOn 8 May 1945, Hildebrandt was taken captive by the United States Army, but was released a few months later.\n\nIn the years after the war, Hildebrandt finished his schooling and moved to Windischeschenbach in Bavaria. In 1948 he started studying theatre sciences in Munich. During that time he founded a student-performed cabaret show,\"Die Namenlosen\", in Schwabing. After finishing his studies Hildebrandt worked with Sammy Drechsel to found and develop the \"Münchner Lach und Schießgesellschaft\", a successful cabaret venue where he worked alongside cabaret artists such as Klaus Havenstein and Bruno Jonas. He stopped working with Drechsel in 1972, to work for radio and TV stations.\n\nFrom 1973 until 1979 Hildebrandt was the presenter and author of the cabaret show \"Notizen aus der Provinz\" (Notes From The Province), which was broadcast by ZDF. In 1980 his show \"Scheibenwischer\" (Windscreen Wiper) first aired on the SFB, and remained on the air until 2003.

Her husband departs with his young secretary, and her accompanist dies. Her fierce desire to be alone in her pain alienates everybody except her faithful maid. She gives all her musical effects to a totter (an itinerant scrap merchant), who she asks into her bed as well. Watching a videotape of a concert triumph, she takes an overdose but the maid breaks in to try and save her. In an epilogue, which may be a dream, the psychiatrist has become a friend while her ex-husband and former pupil come back to see her, as does the ghost of her accompanist.\n\n\nThe movie gained positive reviews.\n\nGolden Globe for Best Actress in a Drama Role: Julie Andrews (Nominated)\n\n\"Duet for One\" premiered at the Bush Theatre in 1980 with Frances de la Tour and David de Keyser in the leading roles. Kempinski and de la Tour were married at the time, and he wrote the role with her in mind. It had successful runs in the West End and on Broadway. A major revival was staged by the Almeida Theatre in 2009, starring Juliet Stevenson and Henry Goodman. This revival too was lauded by the critics, and it subsequently transferred to the Vaudeville Theatre in the West End.\n\n"}

{"id": "18976382", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18976382", "title": "Fetaix", "text": "Fetaix\n\nFetaix is a two-player abstract strategy board game from Morocco. It is very similar to Alquerque. The only difference is that pieces cannot move backwards until they are promoted to Mullah which is the equivalent of King in draughts. Furthermore, Mullahs can move any number of vacant points on the board, and capture enemy pieces from any distance similar to the Kings in International draughts. Another name for the game is qireq.\n\nThe player who captures all of their opponent's pieces is the winner.\n\nThe board used is an Alquerque board. Each player has 12 pieces as in Alquerque. One player plays the black pieces, and the other player plays the white pieces.\n\n1. Players decide what color pieces to play.\n\n2. The board is initially set up exactly as in Alquerque. Each player's pieces are set up in the first two ranks (two rows) of their side, and also on the two right-most points of the third rank (center row of the board). The only point vacant on the board is the middle point.\n\n3. Players alternate their turns. A player on their turn may either move one of their pieces, or use one of their pieces to capture the other player's piece(s).\n\n4. A piece can only move one space onto a vacant point forward (straight forward, diagonally forward) or sideways (left and right) following the pattern on the board until promoted to Mullah.\n\nMullahs can move in any direction following the pattern on the board. Mullahs can also move any number of vacant points in a straight line.\n\n5. A non-Mullah piece may capture an enemy piece by the short leap method. The non-Mullah piece leaps over the adjacent enemy piece in a straight line following the pattern on the board, and landing on a vacant point on the other side. Captures are compulsory. Captured pieces are removed from the board. Multiple captures are allowed and must be taken if possible, and provided there exist exactly one vacant point in between the enemy pieces, and a vacant point beyond. \"It is unknown, however, if non-Mullah pieces can capture in the backward direction (straight back or diagonally back)\".\n\nMullahs can capture in any direction. They can also capture enemy pieces from any distance, and land any distance beyond provided there is no other pieces (friendly or not) within the path of the (straight) leap. Mullahs are also capable of multiple captures. Captures are compulsory for Mullahs.\n\n6. A non-Mullah piece is promoted to Mullah when it reaches the last rank (the other player's first rank or row). \"It is uncertain whether a piece can be promoted to Mullah when it reaches the last rank as one of its intermediary steps of a capturing sequence\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1588525", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1588525", "title": "Fog machine", "text": "Fog machine\n\nA fog machine, fog generator, or smoke machine is a device that emits a dense vapor that appears similar to fog or smoke. This artificial fog is most commonly used in professional entertainment applications, but smaller, more affordable fog machines are becoming common for personal use. Fog machines can also be found in use in a variety of industrial, training, and some military applications. Typically, fog is created by vaporizing proprietary water and glycol-based or glycerin-based fluids or through the atomization of mineral oil. This fluid (often referred to colloquially as \"fog juice\") vaporizes or atomizes inside the fog machine. Upon exiting the fog machine and mixing with cooler outside air the vapor condenses, resulting in a thick visible fog.\n\nHeated fog machines use either an inert gas or an electric pump to propel mineral oil, propylene glycol, or glycerin and water mixture into a heat exchanger, where the solution is vaporized. Propylene glycol is used rather than ethylene glycol (ie antifreeze), as the latter is toxic.\nThe most commonly encountered form of heated fog machine is the pump machine. Very basic models of this type of machine consist of a fluid reservoir, an electric pump to move the fog fluid and heat exchanger which vaporizes the fluid. More complex models may include a variety of other features, including variable speed pumps to control the output of fog, timer modules, or components for remote operation and monitoring of the fog machines' status. Some manufacturers have produced accessories and fluids that when combined with an ordinary heated pump machine, create fog effects similar to chilled fog machines.\nGas propelled fog machines use an inert gas (most commonly CO or nitrogen) to propel either mineral oil or a glycol based fluid into a heat exchanger where it is vaporized into particles, creating a fog. Some models of gas propelled fog machine provide control over the output of fog by varying the volume of gas used to propel the fluid.\n\nChilled fog machines are designed to create thick clouds of fog that lie close to the ground and dissipate as they rise. They are typically created by using either dry ice, liquid nitrogen, or more recently liquid air.\n\nDry Ice (solid carbon dioxide) effects are produced by heating water to or near boiling in a suitable container (for example: a 55-gallon drum with water heater coils in it), and then dropping in one or more pieces of dry ice. Because at standard temperature and pressure carbon dioxide is a gas, the carbon dioxide sublimates and instantly produces a gas, condensing water vapor and creating a thick white fog. A fan placed at the top of the container directs the fog where it is needed.\nLiquid nitrogen (N) is used to create low lying fog effects in a manner similar to dry ice. A machine heats water to at or near the boiling point, creating steam and increasing the humidity in a closed container. When liquid nitrogen is pumped into the container, the moisture rapidly condenses, creating a thick white fog. A fan placed at the output of the container directs the fog where it is needed, creating a rolling fog that lies low to the ground.\nLiquid air is an alternative to using liquid nitrogen in generating low lying fog effects. Liquid air is composed of N and O mixed in a ratio of 79% nitrogen and 21% oxygen stored as a liquid in insulated cylinders. This ratio of nitrogen to oxygen is the same as that of atmospheric air, and indeed liquid air may be fabricated by simply liquefying atmospheric air. Liquid air can be used as a direct replacement for liquid nitrogen in chilled-fog effects and is intended to be used in the same manner in the same equipment. Its key advantage over liquid nitrogen is that it presents no asphyxiation hazard, since it contains oxygen. A disadvantage is that it supports combustion, whereas liquid nitrogen inhibits combustion.\n\nThe versatility of fog machines make them appropriate for a wide variety of applications:\nFog readily assists in creating a specific mood or feeling for a theatrical moment, and is often used in plays, such as \"Dracula\", \"A Christmas Carol\" and \"Macbeth\". Fog machines are also frequently used in Halloween displays such as haunted houses or forests. Because of greater availability and reductions in prices between 2003 and 2005, fog machines have become widely used for domestic Halloween presentations.\nFog machines are also useful for industrial applications including visualizing the flow of air, such highlighting drag over a surface in a wind tunnel or testing for leaks or filter effectiveness in air conditioning installations.\nEmergency and military services also use fog machines in their training regimens.\nBecause of the reflective and refractive qualities of the smoke created by fog machines, they are often used in nightclubs and other entertainment venues to enhance the effects of lighting and laser arrangements, although they are being superseded by haze machines (see also light beam).\nSeveral companies in Europe and Canada have developed rapid deployment fog machines for use as intrusion and hold-up security systems, intended to disorient an intruder by filling a room with fog when triggered by a panic button or other security device. These Security Smoke devices can produce between 300 and 1,000 cubic meters of smoke in 30 seconds and have been utilized in a wide variety of industries, including buildings requiring a high level of security, such as banks and jewelers, but also warehouses, offices, retail premises and in cash-handling chains. Concerns have been raised, that these devices may cause criminals to panic, causing them to become violent to customers or staff, however Security Smoke now has its own European Standard EN-8 which specifically states that it must not be installed in such a way as to create a mantrap.\n\nUltra Low Volume (UNLV) fogging is used by pest control industry and cleaning companies. UNLV refers to the droplet size (between 20-30 micrometers) generated by these fog machines. This fine droplet size is known as the optimum size for pest control. Traditional thermal fog machine technology has difficulty reaching crawling pests such as roaches, flea and rodents due to the droplet size being too fine (less than 10 micrometers). It is often found that small droplets are blocked by the \"air-curtain\" of insects and rodents.\nCold Fogging, in contrast, is heavy enough to penetrate these \"air-curtains\" as well as light enough to be evenly distributed within a room.\n\nAtmospheric effects generated using water and dry ice or liquid nitrogen can present asphyxiation or breathing hazards. Both carbon dioxide and nitrogen displace ordinary air and the oxygen it contains, creating a risk of subtle anoxia (lack of oxygenation) for people working in these atmospheres. Adequate ventilation is essential to ensure that artists and technicians are surrounded by breathable air. Carbon dioxide has the added hazard of interfering with the normal breathing reflex, which is sensitive to carbon dioxide levels in the air. Nitrogen has no effect on the breathing reflex, but this creates its own hazard in that a person breathing pure nitrogen can lose consciousness from lack of oxygen without any warning signs.\n\nFog produced with liquid air does not present the hazards of carbon dioxide or liquid nitrogen because the liquid air has the same composition as ordinary atmospheric air (including the same level of breathable oxygen).\n\nFog machines which generate their effects solely using water, such as ultrasonic or pressurized technology, pose no special health risks, however it should be noted that \"water based\" fog fluid does contain glycol.\n\nA number of studies have been published on the potential health effects presented by exposure to glycol based theatrical fogs and artificial mists.\n\nTwo studies, a Health Hazard Evaluation completed in 1994 by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, and another one in 2000 by the Department of Community and Preventative Medicine at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine and ENVIRON; both prepared for Actors Equity and the League of American Theaters and Producers, focused on the effects on actors and performers in Broadway musicals. The conclusion of both studies was that there was irritation of mucous membranes such as the eyes and the respiratory tract associated with extended peak exposure to theatrical fog. Exposure guidelines were outlined in the 2000 study that, it was determined, should prevent actors from suffering adverse impact to their health or vocal abilities.\n\nAnother study focused on the use of theatrical fog in the commercial aviation industry for emergency training of staff in simulated fire conditions. This study also found eye and respiratory tract irritation.\n\nIn May 2005, a study published in the American Journal of Industrial Medicine, conducted by the School of Environment and Health at the University of British Columbia, looked at adverse respiratory effects in crew members on a wide variety of entertainment venues ranging from live theaters, concerts, television and film productions to a video arcade. This study determined that cumulative exposure to mineral oil and glycol-based fogs were associated with acute and chronic adverse effects on respiratory health. This study found that short-term exposure to glycol fog was associated with coughing, dry throat, headaches, dizziness, drowsiness, and tiredness. This study also found long-term exposure to smoke and fog was associated with both short-term and long-term respiratory problems such as chest tightness and wheezing. Personnel working closest to the fog machines had reduced lung function results.\n\nThe Professional Lighting and Sound Association has compiled a standard for theatrical fogs or artificial mists compositions for use in entertainment venues that \"are not likely to be harmful to otherwise healthy performers, technicians, or audience members of normal working age, which is 18 to 64 years of age, inclusive.\" This standard was based primarily (though not exclusively) upon the findings of a report commissioned for them by the Cohen Group and applies to only those fog fluid compositions that consist of a mixture of water and glycol (so-called \"water based\" fog fluid).\n\nShort term exposure to glycol fog can be associated with headaches, dizziness, drowsiness and tiredness. Long term exposure to smoke and fog can be related to upper airway and voice symptoms. Extended (multi-year) exposure to smoke and fog has been associated with both short-term and long-term respiratory health problems. Efforts should be made to reduce exposure to theatrical smoke to as low a level as possible. The use of digital effects in post production on film and television sets can be considered a safer practise than using theatrical smoke and fog during filming, although this is not always practical.\n\nHaze machines, also called haze generators or hazers, produce atmospheric effects (haze) which tend to be less dense than that of fog machines, allowing them to be used in creating more subtle looks. Depending on a venue's or location's ventilation, this haze can stay in the air for hours.\nBecause of the small particle size of the output from hazers, under 5 micrometres, a hazer typically takes longer to fill the same volume of space with a visible effect relative to a fog machine.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2678683", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2678683", "title": "Harpsichordist", "text": "Harpsichordist\n\nA harpsichordist is a person who plays the harpsichord.\n\nMany baroque composers played the harpsichord, including Johann Sebastian Bach, Domenico Scarlatti, George Frideric Handel, François Couperin and Jean-Philippe Rameau. At this time, it was common for such musicians also to play the organ, and all keyboard instruments, and to direct orchestral music while playing continuo on the instrument.\n\nModern harpsichord playing can be roughly divided into three eras, beginning with the career of the influential reviver of the instrument, Wanda Landowska. At this stage of the 'harpsichord revival', players generally used harpsichords of a heavy, piano-influenced type made by makers such as Pleyel; the revival of the instrument also led some composers to write specifically for the instrument, often on the request of Landowska. An influential later group of English players using post-Pleyel instruments by Thomas Goff and the Goble family included George Malcolm and Thurston Dart. Beginning in the 1920s, Gavin Williamson and Philip Manuel also helped popularize the harpsichord through concert tours, and were, in fact, the world's only full-time harpsichord duo, known as Manuel and Williamson, performing throughout North American and Europe. They had studied for many years with Wanda Landowska both in France and in New York. In the 1930s Manual and Williamson made the first recordings of the Bach multiple keyboard concerti with members of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, and the duo also gave the American premiere performance of Bach's Concerto in C major for two harpsichords. In addition, they gave American premieres of many works of Couperin and Rameau, among other composers. \n\nThe next generation of harpsichordists were pioneers of modern performance on instruments built according to the authentic practices of the earlier period, following the research of such scholar-builders as Frank Hubbard and William Dowd. This generation of performers included such players as Isohlde Ahlgrimm, Ralph Kirkpatrick, Igor Kipnis, and Gustav Leonhardt. More recently, many outstanding harpsichordists have appeared, such as Scott Ross, Trevor Pinnock, Kenneth Gilbert, Christopher Hogwood, Jos van Immerseel, Ton Koopman, Gary Cooper and David Schrader, with many of them also directing a baroque orchestra from the instrument.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "48653076", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48653076", "title": "Heavy metal bass", "text": "Heavy metal bass\n\nHeavy metal bass is the use of the bass guitar (also called \"electric bass\") in the rock music genres of heavy metal and hard rock. The bassist is part of the rhythm section in a heavy metal band, along with the drummer, rhythm guitarist and, in some bands, a keyboard player. The prominent role of the bass is key to the metal sound, and the interplay of bass and distorted electric guitar is a central element of metal. The bass guitar provides the low-end sound crucial to making the music \"heavy\". The bass plays a \"... more important role in heavy metal than in any other genre of rock.\"\n\nMetal bassists play many different types of basslines, depending on the subgenre they are playing in and their personal playing style. Metal bass lines vary in complexity, from holding down a low pedal point as a foundation for the band's sound to doubling complex riffs and licks along with the lead guitar and/or rhythm guitars. Some bands feature the bass as a lead instrument, an approach popularized by Metallica's Cliff Burton with his emphasis on bass guitar solos and use of chords while playing bass in the early 1980s. Some metal bassists sing lead vocals while they play bass, such as Lemmy Kilmister of Motörhead and Tom Araya of Slayer. Some metal bassists sing backup vocals while they play bass.\n\nMost metal bassists play by plucking the strings with their fingers or by picking with a plectrum, often known as a pick. Using a pick enables bassists to play rapid repeated notes and fast basslines. While the types of bass lines vary in different metal subgenres, the bassist usually fulfills a similar role: anchoring the harmonic framework with bass notes that emphasize the roots of the chords and, along with the drums and rhythm guitar, establishing the beat. The bass is also used a solo instrument in some metal styles. While four-string basses (tuned E, A, D, G from lowest string to highest string) are the most common, since the 1990s, some metal bassists have used five-string basses for added lower range—a low \"B\". Five string basses are used in nu metal, to complement the downtuned guitars use by the rhythm guitarists. Most metal bassists play with fretted instruments, which have metal frets on the fingerboard. However, there are a few bassists such as Steve DiGiorgio who use fretless basses.\n\nMost of the time, metal bass players play basslines which consist of a single note played at a time; that is, without playing multiple notes at the same time to form chords, the way a rhythm guitarist would on an electric guitar. There are, however, a few metal bassists who play chords. Robert Trujillo of Metallica is known for playing \"massive chords\" and \"chord-based harmonics\" on the bass. Lemmy of Motörhead often played power chords in his bass lines. When asked about whether he had begun as a rhythm guitarist, he stated:\nNo, I play a lot of notes, but I also play a lot of chords. And I play a lot of open strings. I just don't play like a bass player. There are complaints about me from time to time. It's not like having a bass player; it's like having a deep guitarist.\n\nWhile bass guitar solos are much less common in metal than guitar solos for electric guitar, some metal bassists do play solos. Bass guitar solos are structured and performed in a similar fashion as rock guitar solos, often with the musical accompaniment from the verse or chorus sections. Bass solos are performed using a range of different techniques, such as plucking or fingerpicking. A small number of metal bassists do two-handed tapping styles in which they use both hands to play notes on the fretboard by rapidly pressing and holding the string to the fret. Players noted for this soloing technique include Cliff Burton and shred guitar-style bassist Billy Sheehan. Led Zeppelin's \"Good Times Bad Times\", the first song on their first album, contains two brief bass solos, occurring after the song's first and third choruses. Queen's bassist, John Deacon, occasionally played bass solos, such as on the song \"Liar\". Metallica's 1983 debut \"Kill Em All\" includes the song \"(Anesthesia) Pulling Teeth,\" consisting entirely of a bass solo played by Cliff Burton. Manowar's bassist Joey DeMaio uses special piccolo bass for his extremely fast bass solos like \"Sting of the Bumblebee\" and \"William's Tale\".\n\nHeavy metal bass players such as Geezer Butler (Black Sabbath), Alex Webster (Cannibal Corpse), Cliff Burton (Metallica), and Les Claypool (Primus, Blind Illusion) have used chime-like harmonics and rapid plucking techniques in their bass solos. In both published Van Halen concert videos, Michael Anthony performs unique maneuvers and actions during his solos. When playing bass solos, rock and metal bassists sometimes use effects such as fuzz bass or a wah-wah pedal to produce a more pronounced sound. Notably, Cliff Burton of Metallica used both effects. Due to the lower range of the bass, bass guitar solos usually have a much lighter accompaniment than solos for other instruments. In some cases, the bass guitar solo is unaccompanied, or accompanied only by the drums.\n\nThere is much less formal training available in college and university for metal bass, the way there is for bass guitarists learning jazz and the mainstream commercial genres (rock, R&B, etc.). Many metal bass players learn by ear, by copying bass lines from records and CDs, and by playing in a number of bands, which may include cover bands and tribute bands. Metal bassists may be able to take lessons from expert metal players or teachers. They may also be able to adapt techniques from other genres to the metal genre. As well, there are a range of books, playing methods, and, since the 1990s and 2000s, instructional DVDs and YouTube videos on how to play metal bass.\n\nMetal bassists play in groups ranging in size from the power trio (guitar, bass and drums, with one or more of the members singing) to larger bands with multiple guitarists, keyboards, a bassist, a drummer and a vocalist. Some metal bassists sing lead vocals while they play bass, a role that Lemmy Kilminster of Motörhead did, and which Tom Araya of Slayer and Grutle Kjellson of Enslaved continue to do. Some metal bassists sing backup vocals while they play bass. Some metal bassists are also bandleaders or songwriters for their bands examples being Steve Harris and Nikki Sixx. In a few cases, traditional metal group bass players have also played another instrument, such as Led Zeppelin's John Paul Jones, who played Hammond organ on some songs or the bassists from mainstream metal bands such as Styx and the Scorpions who use a pedal keyboard, which is played with the feet.\n\nProfessional metal bassists may have a bass technician who tunes their basses before and during a performance, sets up the speaker cabinets, amplifiers and effects units, and performs routine maintenance on the instruments and equipment (e.g., changing strings, replacing speakers, replacing amplifier tubes, etc.).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn relation to the gender composition of heavy metal bands, it has been said that \"[h]eavy metal performers are almost exclusively male\" \"... [a]t least until the mid-1980s\" apart from \"... exceptions such as Girlschool.\" However, \"... now [in the 2010s] maybe more than ever–strong metal women have put up their dukes and got down to it\",\"carv[ing] out a considerable place for [them]selves.\" Given that most heavy metal musicians are male, most metal bassists are male. Almost all of the most well-known metal bassists are male.\n\nWomen have less roles in rock music genres like metal because the \"... rebellion of rock music was largely a male rebellion.\" Philip Auslander says that \"Although there were many women in rock by the late 1960s, most performed only as singers, a traditionally feminine position in popular music\". Though some women played instruments in American all-female garage rock bands, none of these bands achieved more than regional success. So they \"did not provide viable templates for women's on-going participation in rock\". When the female bassist and singer Suzi Quatro emerged in 1973, \"no other prominent female musician worked in rock simultaneously as a singer, instrumentalist, songwriter, and bandleader\". She was \"kicking down the male door in rock and roll and proving that a female \"musician\" ... and this is a point I am extremely concerned about ... could play as well if not better than the boys\".\n\nNotable women metal bassists include:\n\nSome metal bassists use unusually-shaped instruments, such as Gene Simmons from Kiss, who had an instrument custom made in the shape of an axe, or those who use instruments like ES Guitars' Avenger, which has a jagged design. Many metal bassists use electric basses that are used in other rock genres, such as the Fender Precision bass.\n\nHeavy metal bassists use many different brands of bass amplifiers and speaker cabinets to make the instrument sound loud enough on stage. Bass players also use their amplifier's preamp, gain, overdrive (if present) and tone controls to create their unique personal bass sound. In some genres of music, such as folk and small combo jazz, the other instruments are often acoustic and so bass players in these styles may not need large, powerful bass amps. However, in heavy metal live performances, loudness—an \"onslaught of sound,\" in sociologist Deena Weinstein's description—is considered vital. The need for a loud volume in metal bands is even more paramount in large performance venues, such as stadiums. To get a loud enough bass sound to compete with the loudly amplified electric guitars and the large drum kits used in metal, metal bassists typically use large bass speaker cabinets stacked on top of each other–\"bass stacks\"–powered by high-wattage amplifiers. Traditional heavy metal bands were early users of \"bass stacks\". Bassist Alex Webster from the death metal band Cannibal Corpse plays with two 8x10 speaker cabinets (each cabinet contains eight 10\" speakers).\n\nOne early bass stack was the 300-watt Super Vacuum Tube (SVT) amplifier head, which was intended for large performance venues. The SVT was intended for use with one or two speaker cabinets containing eight 10\" speakers. Some metal bassists use vacuum tube amplifiers, which were the dominant active electronic components in bass amplifiers manufactured until the early 1970s. Many bass players believe that tube amplifiers produce a \"warmer\" or more \"natural\" sound than solid state amplifiers when lightly or moderately overdriven, and more pleasing distortion characteristics when heavily overdriven.\n\nSome metal bassists play with a fuzz bass tone, which is obtained by overdriving the bass signal. Cliff Burton of Metallica used fuzz bass. Lemmy Kilmister, the bassist for Motörhead, obtains a natural fuzz bass tone by overdriving his twin 100 watt Marshall Bass stacks. Fuzz bass can also be obtained with a bass overdrive pedal or an \"overdrive\" or distortion effect built into their bass amp. The Peavey Century 200 has an onboard \"distortion\" effect on the second channel. The Peavey VB-2 also has built-in overdrive. Aguilar Amplification's AG 500 bass head is a two-channel amplifier, one of which offers a \"saturation\" control for overdrive. Metal bassists may also use other effects to alter their bass sound, such as a wah pedal (e.g., Cliff Burton) or an audio compressor to smooth out the sound.\n\n"}
{"id": "52692524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52692524", "title": "Heavy metal drumming", "text": "Heavy metal drumming\n\nHeavy metal drumming is a style of rock music drum kit playing that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock drum playing, heavy metal drummers play with emphatic beats, and overall loudness using an aggressive performing style. Heavy metal (or \"metal\") drumming is traditionally characterized by emphatic rhythms and dense bass guitar-and-drum sound. The essence of metal drumming is creating a loud, constant beat for the band using the \"trifecta of speed, power, and precision\".\n\nMetal drumming \"requires an exceptional amount of endurance\", and drummers have to develop \"considerable speed, coordination, and dexterity ... to play the intricate patterns\" used in metal. A characteristic metal drumming technique is the cymbal choke, which consists of striking a cymbal and then immediately silencing it by grabbing it with the other hand (or, in some cases, the same striking hand), producing a burst of sound. The metal drum setup is generally much larger than those employed in other forms of rock music. Black metal, death metal and some \"mainstream metal\" bands \"all depend upon double-kicks and blast beats\".\n\nThe rhythm in metal songs is emphatic, with deliberate stresses on beats by the drummer and other rhythm section players. Weinstein observes that the wide array of sonic effects available to metal drummers enables the \"rhythmic pattern to take on a complexity within its elemental drive and insistency\". In many heavy metal songs, the main groove is characterized by short, two-note or three-note rhythmic figures—generally made up of 8th or 16th notes.\n\nBrief, abrupt, and detached rhythmic cells are joined into rhythmic phrases with a distinctive, often jerky texture. Heavy metal songs also use longer rhythmic figures such as whole note- or dotted quarter note-length chords in slow-tempo power ballads. The tempos in early heavy metal music tended to be \"slow, even ponderous\". By the late 1970s, however, metal bands were employing a wide variety of tempos. In the 2000s decade, metal tempos range from slow ballad tempos (quarter note = 60 beats per minute) to extremely fast blast beat tempos (quarter note = 350 beats per minute).\n\nLike drummers from other rock music genres, metal drummers use a drum kit, a collection of drums and other percussion instruments, typically cymbals, which are set up on stands to be played by a single player with drumsticks held in both hands and the feet operating pedals that control the hi-hat cymbal and the beater for the bass drum. \nMany metal drummers extend their kits from the basic \"snare drum, bass drum, toms and cymbals\" pattern, adding more drums, more cymbals, and many other instruments. In some styles of music particular extensions are normal, for example double bass drums in heavy metal music.\nCommon extensions beyond these standard configurations include:\n\nLess common extensions found particularly, but not exclusive to very large kits, include:\n\nWhile some quieter, acoustic genres of music, such as jazz and traditional blues may not use microphones (\"mics\") in club gigs, in metal, the very loud stage volume from the huge guitar speaker stacks and powerful bass amplifiers means that drums are usually miked. In \"miking\" a drum kit in metal, dynamic microphones, which can handle high sound-pressure levels, are usually used to close-mic drums, which is the predominant way to mic drums for live shows. Condenser microphones are used for overheads and room mics, an approach which is more common with sound recording applications. Close miking of drums may be done using stands or by mounting the microphones on the rims of the drums, or even using microphones built into the drum itself, which eliminates the need for stands for these microphones, reducing both clutter and set-up time, as well as isolating them.\n\nIn metal, drummers use noise gates that mute the attached microphone when the signal is below a threshold volume. This allows the sound engineer to use a higher overall volume for the drum kit by reducing the number of \"active\" mics which could produce unwanted feedback at any one time. When a drumkit is entirely miked and amplified through the sound reinforcement system, the drummer or the sound engineer can add other electronic effects to the drum sound, such as reverb or digital delay.\n\nMetal drumming, whether playing accompaniment of singers or guitar solos and other instruments or doing a drum solo, consists of two elements:\n\nA \"fill\" is a departure from the repetitive rhythm pattern in a song. A drum fill is used to \"fill in\" the space between the end of one verse and the beginning of another verse or chorus. Fills vary from a simple few strokes on a tom or snare, to a distinctive rhythm played on the hi-hat, to sequences several bars long that are short virtuosic drum solos. As well as adding interest and variation to the music, fills serve an important function in preparing and indicating significant changes of sections in songs and linking sections. A \"vocal cue\" is a short drum fill that introduces a vocal entry. A fill ending with a cymbal crash on beat one is often used to lead into a chorus or verse.\n\nA drum solo is an instrumental section that highlights the virtuosity, skill and musical creativity of the drummer. While other instrument solos such as guitar solos are typically accompanied by the other rhythm section instruments (e.g., bass guitar and electric guitar), for most drum solos, all the other band members stop playing so that all of the audience's focus will be on the drummer. In some drum solos, the other rhythm section instrumentalists may play \"punches\" at certain points–sudden, loud chords of a short duration. Drum solos are common in heavy metal. During drum solos, drummers have a great deal of creative freedom, and drummers often use the entire drum kit. In live concerts, drummers may be given long drum solos, even in genres where drum solos are rare on singles.\n\nWhere the blues rock drumming style started out largely as simple shuffle beats on small kits, drummers began using a more muscular, complex, and amplified approach to match and be heard against the increasingly loud guitar.\n\nThrash metal emerged in the early 1980s under the influence of hardcore punk and the new wave of British heavy metal, particularly songs in the revved-up style known as speed metal. The movement began in the United States, with Bay Area thrash metal being the leading scene. The drumming sound developed by thrash groups was faster and more aggressive than that of the original metal bands and their glam metal successors.\n\nThrash soon began to evolve and split into more extreme metal genres. Death metal utilizes the speed and aggression of both thrash and hardcore. Death metal uses extremely fast drumming, often with rapid double bass drumming and \"wall of sound\"–style blast beats. Frequent tempo and time signature changes and syncopation are also typical.\n\nThe first wave of black metal emerged in Europe in the early and mid-1980s use blast beats.\n\nEmerging in the mid-1980s, the doom metal movement rejected other metal styles' emphasis on speed, slowing its music to a crawl and using melancholy tempos.\n\nIn the mid- and late 1990s came a new wave of U.S. metal groups inspired by the alternative metal bands and their mix of genres. Dubbed \"nu metal\", bands such as Slipknot, Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit, Papa Roach, P.O.D., Korn and Disturbed incorporated elements ranging from death metal to hip hop beats. Nu metal gained mainstream success through heavy MTV rotation and Ozzy Osbourne's 1996 introduction of Ozzfest, which led the media to talk of a resurgence of heavy metal.\n\nSome of the most notable metal drummers include:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "42142", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42142", "title": "Historical fiction", "text": "Historical fiction\n\nHistorical fiction is a literary genre in which the plot takes place in a setting located in the past. Although the term is commonly used as a synonym for the historical novel, it can also be applied to other types of narrative, including theatre, opera, cinema and television, as well as video games and graphic novels.\n\nAn essential element of historical fiction is that it is set in the past and pays attention to the manners, social conditions and other details of the period depicted. Authors also frequently choose to explore notable historical figures in these settings, allowing readers to better understand how these individuals might have responded to their environments. Some subgenres such as alternate history and historical fantasy insert speculative or ahistorical elements into a novel.\n\nWorks of historical fiction are sometimes criticized for lack of authenticity because of readerly or genre expectations for accurate period details. This tension between historical authenticity, or historicity, and fiction frequently becomes a point of comment for readers and popular critics, while scholarly criticism frequently goes beyond this commentary, investigating the genre for its other thematic and critical interests.\n\nHistorical fiction, as a contemporary Western literary genre, has its foundations in the early 19th century works of Sir Walter Scott and his contemporaries in other national literatures such as the Frenchman Honoré de Balzac, the American James Fenimore Cooper, and a later Russian, Leo Tolstoy. However, the melding of \"historical\" and \"fiction\" in individual works of literature has a long tradition in most cultures; both western traditions (as early as Ancient Greek and Roman literature) as well as Eastern, in the form of oral and folk traditions (see mythology and folklore), which produced epics, novels, plays and other fictional works describing history for contemporary audiences.\n\nDefinitions differ as to what constitutes a historical novel. On the one hand the Historical Novel Society defines the genre as works \"written at least fifty years after the events described\", while critic Sarah Johnson delineates such novels as \"set before the middle of the last [20th] century […] in which the author is writing from research rather than personal experience.\" Then again Lynda Adamson, in her preface to the bibliographic reference work \"World Historical Fiction\", states that while a \"generally accepted definition\" for the historical novel is a novel \"about a time period at least 25 years before it was written\", she also suggests that some people read novels written in the past, like those of Jane Austen (1775–1817), as if they were historical novels.\n\nHistorical fiction sometimes encouraged movements of romantic nationalism. Walter Scott's Waverley novels created interest in Scottish history and still illuminate it. A series of novels by Józef Ignacy Kraszewski on the history of Poland popularized the country's history after it had lost its independence in the Partitions of Poland. Henryk Sienkiewicz wrote several immensely popular novels set in conflicts between the Poles and predatory Teutonic Knights, rebelling Cossacks and invading Swedes. He won the 1905 Nobel Prize in literature. He also wrote the popular novel, \"Quo Vadis\", about Nero's Rome and the early Christians, which has been adapted several times for film, in 1913, 1924, 1951, 2001 to only name the most prominent. Sigrid Undset's \"Kristin Lavransdatter\" fulfilled a similar function for Norwegian history; Undset later won a Nobel Prize for Literature (1928).\n\nMany early historical novels played an important role in the rise of European popular interest in the history of the Middle Ages. Victor Hugo's \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" often receives credit for fueling the movement to preserve the Gothic architecture of France, leading to the establishment of the \"Monuments historiques\", the French governmental authority for historic preservation. Rita Monaldi and Francesco Sorti's historical mystery saga \"Imprimateur Secretum Veritas Mysterium\" has increased interest in European history and features famous castrato opera singer Atto Melani as a detective and spy. Although the story itself is fiction, many of the persona and events are not. The book is based on research by Monaldi and Sorti, who researched information from 17th-century manuscripts and published works concerning the siege of Vienna, the plague and papacy of Pope Innocent XI.\n\nThe genre of the historical novel has also permitted some authors, such as the Polish novelist Bolesław Prus in his sole historical novel, \"Pharaoh\", to distance themselves from their own time and place to gain perspective on society and on the human condition, or to escape the depredations of the censor.\n\nIn some historical novels, major historic events take place mostly off-stage, while the fictional characters inhabit the world where those events occur. Robert Louis Stevenson's \"Kidnapped\" recounts mostly private adventures set against the backdrop of the Jacobite troubles in Scotland. Charles Dickens's \"Barnaby Rudge\" is set amid the Gordon Riots, and \"A Tale of Two Cities\" in the French Revolution.\n\nIn some works, the accuracy of the historical elements has been questioned, as in Alexandre Dumas' \"Queen Margot\". Postmodern novelists such as John Barth and Thomas Pynchon operate with even more freedom, mixing historical characters and settings with invented history and fantasy, as in the novels \"The Sot-Weed Factor\" and \"Mason & Dixon\" respectively. A few writers create historical fiction without fictional characters. One example is the historical mystery series \"Masters of Rome\" by Colleen McCullough.\n\nHistorical prose fiction has a long tradition in world literature. Three of the Four Classics of Chinese literature were set in the distant past: Shi Nai'an's 14th-century \"Water Margin\" concerns 12th-century outlaws; Luo Guanzhong's 14th-century \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\" concerns the 3rd-century wars which ended the Han Dynasty; Wu Cheng'en's 16th-century \"Journey to the West\" concerns the 7th-century Buddhist pilgrim Xuanzang.\n\nClassical Greek novelists were also \"very fond of writing novels about people and places of the past\". \"The Iliad\" has been described as historic fiction, since it treats historic events, although its genre is generally considered epic poetry. \"The Tale of Genji\" (c. 1000 AD) is a fictionalized account of Japanese court life and its author asserted that her work could present a \"fuller and therefore 'truer'\" version of history.\n\nOne of the earliest examples of the historical novel in Europe is \"La Princesse de Clèves\", a French novel which was published anonymously in March 1678. It is regarded by many as the beginning of the modern tradition of the psychological novel, and as a great classic work. Its author is generally held to be Madame de La Fayette. The action takes place between October 1558 and November 1559 at the royal court of Henry II of France. The novel recreates that era with remarkable precision. Nearly every character – except the heroine – is a historical figure. Events and intrigues unfold with great faithfulness to documentary record. In the United Kingdom the historical novel \"appears to have developed\" from \"La Princesse de Clèves\", \"and then via the Gothic novel\".\n\nHistorical fiction rose to prominence in Europe during the early 19th century as part of the Romantic reaction to the Enlightenment, especially through the influence of the Scottish writer Sir Walter Scott, whose works were immensely popular throughout Europe. Jane Porter's 1803 novel \"Thaddeus of Warsaw\" is one of the earliest examples of the historical novel in English and went through at least 84 editions. including translation into French and German, The first true historical novel in English was in fact Maria Edgeworth's \"Castle Rackrent\" (1800).\n\nIn the 20th century György Lukács argued that Scott was the first fiction writer who saw history not just as a convenient frame in which to stage a contemporary narrative, but rather as a distinct social and cultural setting. Scott's Scottish novels such as \"Waverley\" (1814) and \"Rob Roy\" (1817) focused upon a middling character who sits at the intersection of various social groups in order to explore the development of society through conflict. \"Ivanhoe\" (1820) gained credit for renewing interest in the Middle Ages.\n\nMany well-known writers from the United Kingdom published historical novels in the mid 19th century, the most notable include Thackeray's \"Vanity Fair\", Charles Dickens's \"A Tale of Two Cities\", George Eliot's \"Romola\" and Charles Kingsley's \"Westward Ho!\" and \"Hereward the Wake\". \"The Trumpet-Major\" (1880) is Thomas Hardy's only historical novel, and is set in Weymouth during the Napoleonic wars; when the town was then anxious about the possibility of invasion by Napoleon.\n\nIn the United States, James Fenimore Cooper was a prominent author of historical novels who was influenced by Scott. His most famous novel is \"\" (1826), the second book of the \"Leatherstocking Tales\" pentalogy. \"The Last of the Mohicans\" is set in 1757, during the French and Indian War (the Seven Years' War), when France and Great Britain battled for control of North America. \"The Scarlet Letter\" (1850) by Nathaniel Hawthorne, is perhaps the most famous 19th-century American historical novel. Set in 17th-century Puritan Boston, Massachusetts during the years 1642 to 1649, it tells the story of Hester Prynne, who conceives a daughter through an affair and struggles to create a new life of repentance and dignity.\n\nIn French literature, the most prominent inheritor of Scott's style of the historical novel was Balzac. In 1829 Balzac published \"Les Chouans\", a historical work in the manner of Sir Walter Scott. This was subsequently incorporated into La Comédie Humaine. The bulk La Comédie Humaine, however, takes place during the Bourbon Restoration and the July Monarchy, though there are several novels which take place during the French Revolution and others which take place of in the Middle Ages or the Renaissance, including \"About Catherine de Medici\" and \"The Elixir of Long Life\". Victor Hugo's \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" (1831) furnishes another 19th-century example of the romantic-historical novel. Victor Hugo began writing \"The Hunchback of Notre-Dame\" in 1829, largely to make his contemporaries more aware of the value of the Gothic architecture, which was neglected and often destroyed to be replaced by new buildings, or defaced by replacement of parts of buildings in a newer style. The action takes place in 1482 and the title refers to the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, on which the story is centred. Alexandre Dumas also wrote several popular historical fiction novels, including \"The Count of Monte Cristo\" and \"The Three Musketeers\". George Saintsbury stated: \"\"Monte Cristo\" is said to have been at its first appearance, and for some time subsequently, the most popular book in Europe.\" This popularity has extended into modern times as well. The book was \"translated into virtually all modern languages and has never been out of print in most of them. There have been at least twenty-nine motion pictures based on it ... as well as several television series, and many movies [have] worked the name 'Monte Cristo' into their titles.\"\n\nTolstoy's \"War and Peace\" offers an example of 19th-century historical fiction used to critique contemporary history. Tolstoy read the standard histories available in Russian and French about the Napoleonic Wars, and used the novel to challenge those historical approaches. At the start of the novel's third volume he describes his work as blurring the line between fiction and history, in order to get closer to the truth. The novel is set 60 years before it was composed, and alongside researching the war through primary and secondary sources, he spoke with people who had lived through war during the French invasion of Russia in 1812; thus, the book is also, in part, ethnography fictionalized.\n\n\"The Betrothed\" (1827) by Alessandro Manzoni has been called the most famous and widely read novel of the Italian language. \"The Betrothed\" was inspired by Walter Scott's \"Ivanhoe\" but, compared to its model, shows some innovations (two member of the lower class as principal characters, the past described without romantic idealization, an explicitly Christian message), somehow forerunning the realistic novel of the following decades. Set in northern Italy in 1628, during the oppressive years under Spanish rule, it is sometimes seen as a veiled attack on Austria, which controlled the region at the time the novel was written.\n\nThe critical and popular success of \"The Betrothed\" gave rise to a crowd of imitations and, in the age of unification, almost every Italian writer tried his hand at the genre; novels now almost forgotten, like \"Marco Visconti\" by Tommaso Grossi (Manzoni’s best friend) or \"Ettore Fieramosca\" by Massimo D’Azeglio (Manzoni’s son in law), were the best-sellers of their time. Many of these authors (like Niccolò Tommaseo, Francesco Domenico Guerrazzi and D’Azeglio himself) were patriots and politicians too, and in their novels the veiled politic message of Manzoni became explicit (the hero of \"Ettore Fieramosca\" fights to defend the honor of the Italian soldiers, mocked by some arrogant Frenchmen). Unfortunately, in them the narrative talent not equaled the patriotic passion, and their novels, full of rhetoric and melodramatic excesses, are today barely readable as historical documents. A significant exception is \"The Confessions of an Italian\" by Ippolito Nievo, an epic about the Venetian republic's fall and the Napoleonic age, told with satiric irony and youthful brio (Nievo wrote it when he was 26 years old).\n\nA major 20th-century example of this genre is the German author Thomas Mann's \"Buddenbrooks\" (1901). This chronicles the decline of a wealthy north German merchant family over the course of four generations, incidentally portraying the manner of life and mores of the Hanseatic bourgeoisie in the years from 1835 to 1877. Mann drew deeply from the history of his own family, the Mann family of Lübeck, and their milieu. This was Mann's first novel, and with the publication of the 2nd edition in 1903, \"Buddenbrooks\" became a major literary success. The work led to a Nobel Prize in Literature for Mann in 1929; although the Nobel award generally recognises an author's body of work, the Swedish Academy's citation for Mann identified \"his great novel \"Buddenbrooks\"\" as the principal reason for his prize. Mann also wrote, between 1926 and 1943, a four-part novel \"Joseph and His Brothers\". In it Mann retells the familiar biblical stories of Genesis, from Jacob to Joseph (chapters 27–50), setting it in the historical context of the reign of Akhenaten (1353–1336 BC) in ancient Egypt.\n\nRobert Graves of Britain wrote several popular historical novels, including \"I, Claudius\", \"King Jesus\", \"The Golden Fleece\" and \"Count Belisarius\". John Cowper Powys wrote two historical novels set in Wales, \"Owen Glendower\" (1941) and \"Porius\" (1951). The first deals with the rebellion of the Welsh Prince Owen Glendower (A.D.1400–16), while \"Porius\" takes place during the Dark Ages, in A.D. 499, just before the Anglo-Saxon Invasion of Britain. Powys suggests parallels with these historical periods and Britain in the late 1930s and during World War II.\n\nOther significant British novelists include Georgette Heyer, Naomi Mitchison, and Mary Renault. Heyer essentially established the historical romance genre and its subgenre Regency romance, which was inspired by Jane Austen. To ensure accuracy, Heyer collected reference works and kept detailed notes on all aspects of Regency life. While some critics thought the novels were too detailed, others considered the level of detail to be Heyer's greatest asset; Heyer even recreated William the Conqueror's crossing into England for her novel \"The Conqueror\". Naomi Mitchison's finest novel \"The Corn King and the Spring Queen\" (1931) is regarded by some as the best historical novel of the 20th century. Mary Renault is best known for her historical novels set in Ancient Greece. In addition to fictional portrayals of Theseus, Socrates, Plato and Alexander the Great, she wrote a non-fiction biography of Alexander. The Siege of Krishnapur (1973) by J. G. Farrell has been described as an \"outstanding novel\". Inspired by events such as the sieges of Cawnpore and Lucknow, the book details the siege of a fictional Indian town, Krishnapur, during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 from the perspective of the British residents. The main characters find themselves subject to the increasing strictures and deprivation of the siege, which reverses the \"normal\" structure of life where Europeans govern Asian subjects. The absurdity of the class system in a town no one can leave becomes a source of comic invention, though the text is serious in intent and tone.\n\nThough the genre has evolved since its inception, the historical novel remains popular with authors and readers to this day and bestsellers include Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey–Maturin series, Ken Follett's \"Pillars of the Earth\", and Neal Stephenson's \"Baroque Cycle\". A development in British and Irish writing in the past 25 years has been the renewed interest in the First World War. Works include William Boyd's \"An Ice-Cream War\"; Sebastian Faulks' \"Birdsong\" and \"The Girl at the Lion d'Or\" (concerned with the War's consequences); Pat Barker's \"Regeneration Trilogy\" and Sebastian Barry's \"A Long Long Way\". William Golding wrote a number of historical novels. \"The Inheritors\" (1955) is set in prehistoric times and shows \"new people\" (generally identified with \"Homo sapiens sapiens\"), triumphing over a gentler race (generally identified with Neanderthals) by deceit and violence. \"The Spire\" (1964) follows the building (and near collapse) of a huge spire onto a medieval cathedral (generally assumed to be Salisbury Cathedral); the spire symbolizing both spiritual aspiration and worldly vanity. \"The Scorpion God\" (1971) consists of three novellas, the first set in a prehistoric African hunter-gatherer band ('Clonk, Clonk'), the second in an ancient Egyptian court ('The Scorpion God') and the third in the court of a Roman emperor ('Envoy Extraordinary'). The trilogy \"To the Ends of the Earth\", which includes the \"Rites of Passage\" (1980), \"Close Quarters\" (1987), and \"Fire Down Below\" (1989), describes sea voyages in the early 19th century.\n\nAmerican Nobel laureate William Faulkner's novel \"Absalom, Absalom\" (1936) is set before, during, and after the American Civil War. Kenneth Roberts wrote several books set around the events of the American Revolution, of which Northwest Passage (1937), Oliver Wiswell (1940), and Lydia Bailey (1947) all became best-sellers in the 1930s and 1940s. The following American authors have also written historical novels in the 20th century: Gore Vidal, John Barth, Norman Mailer, E.L. Doctorow, William Kennedy.\n\nIn Italy, the tradition of the historical fiction has flourished also in the contemporary age, and moreover the Nineteenth century has caught the writers’ interest. Southern novelists like Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa (The leopard), Francesco Iovine (\"Lady Ava\"), Carlo Alianello (\"The heritage of the prioress\") and, more recently, Andrea Camilleri (\"The Preston brewer\") have retold the events of the Italian Unification, often overturning their traditional image, heroic and progressive. The conservative Riccardo Bacchelli in \"The devil at the long point\" and the communist Vasco Pratolini in \"Metello\" had described, by two ideologically opposite points of view, the birth of the Italian Socialism. Bacchelli is also the author of \"The mill on the Po\", the powerful, also if a little farraginous, saga of a family of millers, from Napoleon to the First World War, one of the most epic novels of the last century.\n\nIn 1980, Umberto Eco achieved international success with \"The name of the rose\", a novel set in an Italian abbey in 1327 and readable both as a historical mystery, as an allegory of the Italy in the “plumber years” and as an erudite joke. The Eco’s example, like the one of Manzoni before it, relaunched the interest of Italian public and writers for the genre and many novelists who till then had cultivated the contemporary novel, turned their hand to the stories set in the far centuries. So it was for Fulvio Tomizza (\"The evil coming from North\", about the Reformation), Dacia Maraini (\"The silent duchess\", about the female condition in the Eighteenth century) and Sebastiano Vassalli (\"The chimera\", about the witch hunt). Among the writers emerged in the last years, Ernesto Ferrero (\"N\") and Valerio Manfredi (\"The last legion\") worth a mention.\n\nFani Popova–Mutafova (1902-1977) was a Bulgarian author who is considered by many to have been the best-selling Bulgarian historical fiction author ever. Her books sold in record numbers in the 1930s and the early 1940s. However, she was eventually sentenced to seven years of imprisonment by the Bulgarian communist regime because of some of her writings celebrating Hitler, and though released after only eleven months for health reasons, was forbidden to publish anything between 1943 and 1972.\n\nA 20th-century variant of the historical novel is documentary fiction, which incorporates \"not only historical characters and events, but also reports of everyday events\" found in contemporary newspapers. Examples of this variant form of historical novel include \"U.S.A.\" (1938), and \"Ragtime\" (1975) by E.L. Doctorow.\n\n\"Memoirs of Hadrian\" by the Belgian-born French writer Marguerite Yourcenar is about the life and death of Roman Emperor Hadrian. First published in France in French in 1951 as \"Mémoires d'Hadrien\", the book was an immediate success, meeting with enormous critical acclaim. Margaret George has written fictional biographies about historical persons in \"The Memoirs of Cleopatra\" (1997) and \"Mary, called Magdalene\" (2002). An earlier example is \"Peter I\" (1929–34) by Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy, and \"I, Claudius\" (1934) and \"King Jesus\" (1946) by Robert Graves. Other recent biographical novel series, include \"Conqueror\" and \"Emperor\" by Conn Iggulden and \"Cicero Trilogy\" by Robert Harris.\n\nHistorical mysteries or \"historical whodunits\" are set by their authors in the distant past, with a plot that which involves the solving of a mystery or crime (usually murder). Though works combining these genres have existed since at least the early 1900s, many credit Ellis Peters's \"Cadfael Chronicles\" (1977–1994) with popularizing them. These are set between 1137 and 1145 A.D. The increasing popularity of this type of fiction in subsequent decades has created a distinct subgenre recognized by both publishers and libraries.\n\nRomantic themes have also been portrayed, such as \"Gone with the Wind\" by Margaret Mitchell. One of the first popular historical romances appeared in 1921, when Georgette Heyer published \"The Black Moth\", which is set in 1751. It was not until 1935 that she wrote the first of her signature Regency novels, set around the English Regency period (1811–1820), when the Prince Regent ruled England in place of his ill father, George III. Heyer's Regency novels were inspired by Jane Austen's novels of the late 18th and early 19th century. Because Heyer's writing was set in the midst of events that had occurred over 100 years previously, she included authentic period detail in order for her readers to understand. Where Heyer referred to historical events, it was as background detail to set the period, and did not usually play a key role in the narrative. Heyer's characters often contained more modern-day sensibilities, and more conventional characters in the novels would point out the heroine's eccentricities, such as wanting to marry for love.\n\nSome historical novels explore life at sea, including C.S. Forester's Hornblower series, Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin series, Alexander Kent's The Bolitho Novels, Dudley Pope's Lord Ramage's series, all of which all deal with the Napoleonic Wars. There are also adventure novels with pirate characters like Robert Louis Stevenson's \"Treasure Island\" (1883), Emilio Salgari's Sandokan (1895–1913) and \"Captain Blood\" (1922) by Rafael Sabatini. Recent examples of historical novels about pirates are \"The Adventures of Hector Lynch\" by Tim Severin, \"The White Devil (Белият Дявол)\" by Hristo Kalchev and \"The Pirate Devlin\" novels by Mark Keating.\n\n\"The Plot Against America\" is a novel by Philip Roth published in 2004. It is an alternative history in which Franklin Delano Roosevelt is defeated in the presidential election of 1940 by Charles Lindbergh and a fascist, anti-semitic government is established. There are other examples, such as Robert Silverberg's \"Roma Eterna\", in which the Roman Empire survives to the present day and time travel to the past, such as the \"Company\" stories of Kage Baker. There are authors who write in both subgenres, like Harry Turtledove in his Timeline 191 series and \"The Guns of the South\" novel, respectively. Isaac Asimov's short story \"What If--\" is about a couple who can explore alternate realities by means of a television-like device. This idea can also be found in Asimov's 1955 novel \"The End of Eternity\". In that novel, the \"Eternals\" can change the realities of the world, without people being aware of it.\n\nThere is also a historical fantasy subgenre. Poul Anderson has a number of historical fantasy novels set in Viking times including The Broken Sword and \"Hrolf Kraki's Saga\". Otherwise space opera author C. J. Cherryh has a whole historical fantasy series \"The Russian Stories\" set in Medieval Kievan Rus times. Guy Gavriel Kay has number of historical fantasy novels as \"The Lions of Al-Rassan\" set in Renaissance Spain and \"The Sarantine Mosaic\" in Ancient Greece. David Gemmel has only two historical fantasy series. The first is the \"Greek series\", which are about Parmenion, a general of Alexander the Great. The story is loosely based on historic events, but adds fantasy elements such as supernatural creatures and sorcery. His posthumous \"Troy Series\" features a fictional version of the Trojan War. \"The Sevenwaters Trilogy\" (later expanded) by Juliet Marillier is set in 9th-century Ireland.\n\nA prominent subgenre within historical fiction is the children's historical novel. Often following a pedagogical bent, children's historical fiction may follow the conventions of many of the other subgenres of historical fiction. A number of such works include elements of historical fantasy or time travel to facilitate the transition between the contemporary world and the past in the tradition of children's portal fiction. Sometimes publishers will commission series of historical novels that explore different periods and times. Among the most popular contemporary series include the American Girl novels and the Magic Tree House series. A prominent award within children's historical fiction is the Scott O'Dell Award for Historical Fiction.\n\nHistorical narratives have find their way also in comics and graphic novels. There are Prehistorical elements in jungle comics like Akim and Rahan. Ancient Greece inspired graphic novels are \"300\" created by Frank Miller, centered around Battle of Thermopylae, and \"Age of Bronze series\" by Eric Shanower, that retells Trojan War. Historical subjects can also be found in manhua comics like \"Three Kingdoms\" and \"Sun Zi's Tactics\" by Lee Chi Ching, \"Weapons of the Gods\" by Wong Yuk Long as well as \"The Ravages of Time\" by Chan Mou. There are also straight series like \"Path of the Assassin\", \"Vagabond\", \"Rurouni Kenshin\" and \"Azumi\". Several comics and graphic novels have been produced into anime series or a movie adaptations like \"Azumi\" and \"300\".\n\nHistorical drama film stories are based upon historical events and famous people. Some historical dramas are docudramas, which attempt an accurate portrayal of a historical event or biography, to the degree that the available historical research will allow. Other historical dramas are fictionalized tales that are based on an actual person and their deeds, such as \"Braveheart\", which is loosely based on the 13th-century knight William Wallace's fight for Scotland's independence. For films pertaining to the history of East Asia, Central Asia, and South Asia, there are historical period drama films set in Asia, also known as Jidaigeki in Japan. like \"The Hidden Power of the Dragon Sabre\" (1984) and \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" (2000), based on novels by Jin Yong and Wang Dulu, have also been produced. Zhang Yimou has directed several acclaimed wuxia films like \"Hero\" (2002), \"House of Flying Daggers\" (2004) and \"Curse of the Golden Flower\" (2006). Although largely fictional some wuxia films are considered historical drama. Samurai films like Zatoichi and Lone Wolf and Cub series also fall under historical drama umbrella. Peplum films also known as sword-and-sandal, is a genre of largely Italian-made historical or biblical epics (costume dramas) that dominated the Italian film industry from 1958 to 1965. Most pepla featured a superhumanly strong man as the protagonist, such as Hercules, Samson, Goliath, Ursus or Italy's own popular folk hero Maciste. These supermen often rescued captive princesses from tyrannical despots and fought mythological creatures. Not all the films were fantasy-based, however. Many featured actual historical personalities such as Julius Caesar, Cleopatra, and Hannibal, although great liberties were taken with the storylines. Gladiators, pirates, knights, Vikings, and slaves rebelling against tyrannical kings were also popular subjects. There are also films based on Medieval narratives like Ridley Scott's historical epics \"Robin Hood\" (2010) and \"Kingdom of Heaven\" (2005) and the subgenred films based on the Arthurian legend such as \"\" (2008) and \"King Arthur\" (2004).\n\nMany historical narratives have been expanded into television series. Notable ancient history inspired TV series include: \"Rome\", \"Spartacus\", \"Egypt\", \"The Last Kingdom\" and \"I Claudius\". Tudor England is also a very prominent subject in television series like \"The Tudors\", \"The Virgin Queen\" and \"Elizabeth I\". Programs about the Napoleonic Wars have also been produced, like \"Sharpe\" and \"Hornblower\". Historical soap operas have also been popular, including the Turkish TV series \"The Magnificent Century\" and \"\". Chinese studios have also produced television series like \"The Legend and the Hero\", its \"sequel series\", \"King's War\" and \"The Qin Empire\". There have also been produced pure , many based on works by Jin Yong like \"Condor Trilogy\" and \"Swordsman\", also \"Lu Xiaofeng\" and \"Chu Liuxiang\" by Gu Long. They have been very popular in China, but largely unnoticed in Western media.\n\nHistory is one of the three main genres in Western theatre alongside tragedy and comedy, although it originated, in its modern form, thousands of years later than the other primary genres. For this reason, it is often treated as a subset of tragedy. A play in this genre is known as a history play and is based on a historical narrative, often set in the medieval or early modern past. History emerged as a distinct genre from tragedy in Renaissance England. The best known examples of the genre are the history plays written by William Shakespeare, whose plays still serve to define the genre. Shakespeare wrote numerous history plays, some included in the First Folio as histories, and other listed as tragedies, or Roman plays. Among the most famous histories are \"Richard III\", and \"Henry IV, Part 1\", \"Henry IV, Part 2\", and \"Henry V\". Other plays that feature historical characters, are the tragedy \"Macbeth\", set in the mid-11th century during the reigns of Duncan I of Scotland and Edward the Confessor, and the Roman plays \"Coriolanus\", \"Julius Caesar\", and \"Antony and Cleopatra\". Another tragedy \"King Lear\", is based on British legend, as is the romanc \"Cymbeline, King of Britain\", which is set in Ancient Britain.\n\nOther playwrights contemporary to Shakespeare, such as Christopher Marlowe, also dramatized historical topics. Marlowe wrote \"Edward the Second\" which deals with the deposition of King Edward II by his barons and the Queen, who resent the undue influence the king's favourites have in court and state affairs, and \"The Massacre at Paris\", which dramatizes the events of the Saint Bartholomew's Day Massacre in France in 1572. Marlowe's \"Tamburlaine the Great\" (1587 or 1588) is a play in two parts, loosely based on the life of the Central Asian emperor, Timur \"the lame\".\n\nHistory plays also appear elsewhere in other western literature. The German authors Goethe and Schiller wrote a number of historical plays, including Goethe's \"Egmont\" (1788), which is set in the 16th century, and is heavily influenced by Shakespearean tragedy, and Schiller's \"Mary Stuart\", which depicts the last days of Mary, Queen of Scots (1800). This play formed the basis for Donizetti's opera \"Maria Stuarda\" (1834). Beethoven wrote incidental music for \"Egmont\".\n\nLater Irish author George Bernard Shaw wrote several histories, including \"Caesar and Cleopatra\" (1898) and \"Saint Joan\", which based on the life and trial of Joan of Arc. Published in 1924, not long after the canonization of Joan of Arc by the Roman Catholic Church, the play dramatises what is known of her life based on the substantial records of her trial. One of the most famous 20th-century history plays is \"The Life of Galileo\" by Bertolt Brecht which dramatises the latter period of the life of Galileo Galilei, the great Italian natural philosopher, who was persecuted by the Roman Catholic Church for the promulgation of his scientific discoveries; for details, see Galileo affair. The play embraces such themes as the conflict between dogmatism and scientific evidence, as well as interrogating the values of constancy in the face of oppression.\n\nMore recently British dramatist Howard Brenton has written several histories. He gained notoriety for his play \"The Romans in Britain\", first staged at the National Theatre in October 1980, which drew parallels between the Roman invasion of Britain in 54BC and the contemporary British military presence in Northern Ireland. Its concerns with politics were, however, overshadowed by controversy surrounding a rape scene. Brenton also wrote \"Anne Boleyn\" a play on the life of Anne Boleyn, which premiered at Shakespeare's Globe in 2010. Anne Boleyn is portrayed as a significant force in the political and religious in-fighting at court and a furtherer of the cause of Protestantism in her enthusiasm for the Tyndale Bible.\n\nOne of the first operas to use historical events and people is Claudio Monteverdi's L'incoronazione di Poppea, which was first performed in Venice during the 1643 carnival season. it describes how Poppaea, mistress of the Roman emperor Nero, is able to achieve her ambition and be crowned empress. The opera was revived in Naples in 1651, but was then neglected until the rediscovery of the score in 1888, after which it became the subject of scholarly attention in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1960s, the opera has been performed and recorded many times. George Frederick Handel also wrote several operas based on historical characters, including \"Giulio Cesare\" (1724), \"Tamerlano\" (1724) and \"Rodelinda\" (1725).\n\nHistorical subjects for operas also developed during the 19th century. Usually with 4 or 5 acts, they are large-scale casts and orchestras, and spectacular staging. Several operas by Gaspare Spontini, Luigi Cherubini, and Gioachino Rossini can be regarded as precursors to French grand opera. These include Spontini's \"La vestale\" (1807) and \"Fernand Cortez\" (1809, revised 1817), Cherubini's \"Les Abencérages\" (1813), and Rossini's \"Le siège de Corinthe\" (1827) and \"Moïse et Pharaon\" (1828). All of these have some of the characteristics of size and spectacle that are normally associated with French grand opera. Another important forerunner was \"Il crociato in Egitto\" by Meyerbeer, who eventually became the acknowledged king of the grand opera genre. Amongst the most important opera composers on historical topics are Giuseppe Verdi, and Richard Wagner.\n\nRussian composers also wrote operas based on historical figures, including \"Boris Godunov\" by Modest Mussorgsky (1839–1881), which was composed between 1868 and 1873, and is considered his masterpiece. Its subjects are the Russian ruler Boris Godunov, who reigned as Tsar (1598 to 1605). Equally famous is Alexander Borodin's \"Prince Igor\", the libretto for which the composer developed from the Ancient Russian epic \"The Lay of Igor's Host\", which recounts the campaign of Rus prince Igor Svyatoslavich against the invading Cuman (\"Polovtsian\") tribes in 1185.\n\nHistorical reenactment is an educational or entertainment activity in which people follow a plan to recreate aspects of a historical event or period. This may be as narrow as a specific moment from a battle, such as the reenactment of Pickett's Charge presented during the Great Reunion of 1913, or as broad as an entire period, such as Regency reenactment or The 1920s Berlin Project.\n\nThe Marxist literary critic, essayist, and social theorist György Lukács wrote extensively on the aesthetic and political significance of the historical novel. In 1937's \"Der historische Roman\", published originally in Russian, Lukács developed critical readings of several historical novels by various authors, including Gottfried Keller, Charles Dickens, and Gustave Flaubert. He interprets the advent of the \"genuinely\" historical novel at the beginning of the 19th century in terms of two developments, or processes. The first is the development of a specific genre in a specific medium—the historical novel's unique stylistic and narrative elements. The second is the development of a representative, organic artwork that can capture the fractures, contradictions, and problems of the particular productive mode of its time (i.e., developing, early, entrenched capitalism).\n\n\n\n\n"}

It evolved in the 1980s to meet increasing efficiency requirements for high-power RF amplifiers in radio transmitters. The primary commercial use of IOTs is in UHF television transmitters, where they have mostly replaced klystrons because of their higher efficiencies (35% to 40%) and smaller size. IOTs are also used in particle accelerators. They are capable of producing power output up to about 30 kW continuous and 7 MW pulsed and gains of 20–23 dB at frequencies up to about a gigahertz.\n\nThe inductive output tube (IOT) was invented in 1938 by Andrew V. Haeff. A patent was later issued for the IOT to Andrew V. Haeff and assigned to the Radio Corporation of America (RCA). During the 1939 New York World's Fair the IOT was used in the transmission of the first television images from the Empire State Building to the fair grounds. RCA sold a small IOT commercially for a short time, under the type number 825. It was soon made obsolete by newer developments, and the technology lay more or less dormant for years.\n\nThe inductive output tube has re-emerged within the last twenty years after having been discovered to possess particularly suitable characteristics (broadband linearity) for the transmission of digital television and high-definition digital television.\n\nThe power output of the modern 21st century IOTs is orders of magnitude higher than the first IOTs produced by the RCA in 1940–1941 but the fundamental principle of operation basically remains the same. IOTs since the 1970s have been designed with electromagnetic modeling computer software that has greatly improved their electrodynamic performance.\n\nIOTs have been described as a cross between a klystron and a triode, hence Eimac's trade name for them, Klystrode. They have an electron gun like a klystron, but with a control grid in front of it like a triode, with a very close spacing of around 0.1 mm. The high frequency RF voltage on the grid allows the electrons through in bunches. High voltage DC on a cylindrical anode accelerates the modulated electron beam through a small drift tube like a klystron. This drift tube prevents backflow of electromagnetic radiation. The bunched electron beam passes through the hollow anode into a resonant cavity, similar to the output cavity of a klystron, and strikes a collector electrode. As in a klystron, each bunch passes into the cavity at a time when the electric field decelerates it, transforming the kinetic energy of the beam into potential energy of the RF field, amplifying the signal. The oscillating electromagnetic energy in the cavity is extracted by a coaxial transmission line. An axial magnetic field prevents space charge spreading of the beam. The collector electrode is at a lower potential than the anode (depressed collector) which recovers some of the energy from the beam, increasing efficiency.\n\nTwo differences from the klystron give it a lower cost and higher efficiency. First, the klystron uses \"velocity modulation\" to create bunching; its beam current is constant. It requires a drift tube several feet in length to allow the electrons to bunch. In contrast the IOT uses \"current modulation\" like an ordinary triode; most of the bunching is done by the grid, so the tube can be much shorter, making it less expensive to build and mount, and less bulky. Secondly, since the klystron has beam current throughout the RF cycle, it can only operate as an inefficient class-A amplifier, while the grid of the IOT allows more versatile operating modes. The grid can be biased so the beam current can be cut off during part of the cycle, enabling it to operate in the more efficient class B or AB mode.\n\nThe highest frequency achievable in an IOT is limited by the grid-to-cathode spacing. The electrons must be accelerated off the cathode and pass the grid before the RF electric field reverses direction. The upper limit on frequency is approximately . The gain of the IOT is 20–23 dB versus 35–40 dB for a klystron. The lower gain is usually not a problem because at 20 dB the requirements for drive power (1% of output power) are within the capabilities of economical solid state UHF amplifiers.\n\nThe latest versions of IOTs achieve even higher efficiencies (60%-70%) through the use of a Multistage Depressed Collector (MSDC). One manufacturer's version is called the Constant Efficiency Amplifier (CEA), while another manufacturer markets their version as the ESCIOT (Energy Saving Collector IOT). The initial design difficulties of MSDCIOTs were overcome through the use of recirculating high dielectric transformer oil as a combined coolant and insulation medium to prevent arcing and erosion between the closely spaced collector stages and to provide reliable low-maintenance collector cooling for the life of the tube. Earlier MSDC versions had to be air cooled (limited power) or used de-inonized water that had to be filtered, regularly exchanged and provided no freezing or corrosion protection.\n\nThermal radiation from the cathode heats the grid. As a result, low-work-function cathode material evaporates and condenses on the grid. This eventually leads to a short between cathode and grid, as the material accreting on the grid narrows the gap between it and the cathode. In addition, the emissive cathode material on the grid causes a negative grid current (reverse electron flow from the grid to the cathode). This can swamp the grid power supply if this reverse current gets too high, changing the grid (bias) voltage and, consequently, the operating point of the tube. Today's IOTs are equipped with coated cathodes that work at relatively low operating temperatures, and hence have slower evaporation rates, minimizing this effect.\n\nLike most linear beam tubes having external tuning cavities, IOTs are vulnerable to arcing, and must be protected with arc detectors located in the output cavities that trigger a crowbar circuit based on a hydrogen thyratron or a triggered spark gap in the high-voltage supply. The purpose of the crowbar circuit is to instantly dump the massive electrical charge stored in the high voltage beam supply before this energy can damage the tube assembly during an uncontrolled cavity, collector or cathode arc.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1702542", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1702542", "title": "Jueteng", "text": "Jueteng\n\nJueteng ( or ) is an illegal numbers game played in the Philippines. Jueteng comes from the root word \"waiting\", waiting for a numbers to come. Although illegal, it is a widely popular game with participation that crosses most, if not all social and economic boundaries. With long odds and no limits on minimum or maximum bets, the lure of quick riches through a lucrative payout is by far its strongest appeal.\n\nThe Spanish government sponsored gambling as a franchise of the governor-general in Manila. \"Juéteng\" () was introduced by Spanish colonizers, dating back to the 1800s. Tickets were even sold in ferries or boats to the Visayas and Mindanao. During the bulk of the 20th century, jueteng operations were primarily conducted and financed by Chinese migrants, until the locals ultimately took over.\n\nBefore the game, the bankers, colloquially known as \"cobradors\" or \"cabo\", usually solicit peoples' houses for potential bettors. Some cobradors may also erect stalls or kiosks on the street to attract bettors. Once a bettor is found, the game begins. The bettor picks two digits from 1 to 37. Bets can be as low as 25 cents. A bet of one peso can win from ₱ 400.00 to ₱ 1,000.00, depending on the location.\n\nAlthough much has been done to curtail or eradicate this form of unregulated gambling by government and community leaders, such efforts have fallen by the wayside due to the game's vast popularity and the poverty in the country. In the 1980s, the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office sanctioned and operated a similar game, called \"Small Town Lottery,\" which raised the popularity of the game. The number that bettors have to choose from has been increased from 37 to 40. This has been made to seemingly detach its identity from that of jueteng and increase the odds of winning.\n\nJueteng was brought to notoriety in 2000 during the impeachment proceedings of deposed Philippine President Joseph Estrada, who was eventually found guilty of plunder on 12 September 2007 after receiving millions in illegal payoffs, including from gambling profits. Another political scandal erupted in June 2005 involving allegations that relatives of Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo received payouts from jueteng operators.\n\nThe 2006 film \"Kubrador\" by Jeffrey Jeturian centers on an aging bet collector (played by Gina Pareño) who finds her mundane existence suddenly transformed by an unforeseen series of events and \"jueteng\", the game of numbers that dates back to the Philippines' Spanish colonial period.\n"}
{"id": "473273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=473273", "title": "Jurassic Park III", "text": "Jurassic Park III\n\nJurassic Park III is a 2001 American science fiction adventure film and the third installment in the \"Jurassic Park\" film series. The film stars Sam Neill, William H. Macy, Téa Leoni, Alessandro Nivola, Trevor Morgan, and Michael Jeter. It is the first film in the series Steven Spielberg did not direct; neither was it based on a book by Michael Crichton, although numerous scenes in the film were taken from Crichton's novels \"Jurassic Park\" and \"The Lost World\". Events depicted in the film take place on Isla Sorna, an island off Central America's Pacific coast, where a divorced couple have tricked Dr. Alan Grant into helping them find their son.\n\nAfter the success of Spielberg's film \"Jurassic Park\", Joe Johnston expressed interest in directing a sequel. Spielberg gave Johnston permission to direct a third film in the series, if there was to be one. Production of \"Jurassic Park III\" began on August 30, 2000. Despite mixed reviews from critics, the film was successful at the box office, grossing $368 million worldwide. A sequel, \"Jurassic World\", was released on June 12, 2015.\n\nBen Hildebrand and 12-year-old Eric Kirby go parasailing, tethered to a boat, in the waters around Isla Sorna. The boat's crew mysteriously disappears, forcing Ben to detach the line. He and Eric drift towards the island.\n\nIn the United States, paleontologist and Jurassic Park survivor Dr. Alan Grant has made a new discovery about the intelligence of \"Velociraptors\", but struggles to secure funding for his research because of that has revealed the existence of the de-extinct dinosaurs. Grant discusses his discovery of a resonating larynx on a fossilized raptor remains with his former lover and colleague Dr. Ellie Sattler. This, and his experience at Jurassic Park, leads him to believe the original \"Velociraptors\" were socially sophisticated. He hypothesizes that if they had not gone extinct and continued to evolve, their descendants—rather than humans— would have become Earth's dominant species. His assistant Billy Brennan uses a 3D printer to replicate the \"Velociraptor\" larynx.\n\nPaul and Amanda Kirby offer funding for Grant's research if he will fly them around Isla Sorna. Grant reluctantly agrees and flies there with Paul, Amanda, Billy, and the Kirbys' mercenary associates Udesky, Cooper, and their pilot Nash. During the flight, Grant learns that the Kirbys plan to land on the island; he protests but Cooper knocks him unconscious.\n\nGrant awakens to discover they have landed. A \"Spinosaurus\" approaches the group, who board the plane to escape without Cooper. The \"Spinosaurus\" devours Cooper on the runway and the plane crashes into the forest. The \"Spinosaurus\" destroys the plane, killing Nash. Fleeing, the survivors briefly lose the \"Spinosaurus\" but encounter a \"Tyrannosaurus rex\". The \"Spinosaurus\" returns but the group escapes while the two dinosaurs fight. The \"Spinosaurus\" breaks the \"T. rex\"s neck.\n\nGrant learns the Kirbys are a middle-class, divorced couple who are looking for their son Eric and Amanda's boyfriend Ben, who are missing on the island. The group finds the parasail attached to Ben's corpse. They take the parasail and then encounter raptor nests, and find an abandoned InGen compound. A raptor chases them and summons the rest of its pack. The humans flee into a herd of \"Corythosaurus\" and \"Parasaurolophus\", causing a stampede, and separating Grant and Udesky from the others. Raptors attack Udesky in an attempt to lure the others out of a tree. The raptors almost kill Amanda when she tries to descend to help Udesky. The raptors' trap fails and they kill Udesky before departing.\n\nElsewhere, Grant watches the raptors communicating and suspects they are searching for something. They corner him but is rescued by Eric, who survives in an overturned water truck. The next day, Grant and Eric hear Paul's satellite telephone ringing, and are reunited with Billy and the Kirbys. The group is then chased by the \"Spinosaurus\" that killed Nash.\n\nAfter the group escapes, Grant discovers Billy has taken two raptor eggs to use for funding, which provoked the raptor attacks. Grant decides to keep the eggs to ensure the group's survival. The group unknowingly enters a large aviary used to house \"Pteranodons\", which attack the group and fly away with Eric. Billy rescues Eric using Ben's parasail, but is then attacked and apparently killed by the \"Pteranodons\". The rest of the group escapes the aviary, leaving the door unlocked. They find a boat and make their way down a river.\n\nThat night, the group retrieves the ringing telephone, which is buried in the feces of the \"Spinosaurus\". Grant tries to contact Sattler but the \"Spinosaurus\" attacks the boat. Grant ignites the boat's fuel and burns the \"Spinosaurus\", causing it to flee. The next day, the group makes its way towards the coast but are surrounded by the raptors. They surrender the eggs to the raptors while Grant uses the replica raptor larynx to confuse the pack, which runs off with the eggs.\n\nThe group reach the coast and find that Sattler had called in the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Navy to rescue them. They discover that Billy, while seriously injured, is still alive and has also been rescued. As they leave the island, they see the \"Pteranodons\" flying free.\n\nIn a deviation from the previous films, the \"Spinosaurus\" is considered the primary antagonist; Johnston stated, \"A lot of dinosaurs have a very similar silhouette to the \"T-Rex\" ... and we wanted the audience to instantly recognize this as something else\". The silhouette of the \"Spinosaurus\" is shown behind that of the \"Pteranodon\"on the film's promotional poster, taking the place of the \"Tyrannosaurus\" that had been used in the previous films' posters. \"Baryonyx\" was originally considered to be the \"big bad\" before \"Spinosaurus\" was chosen, and early concept posters reflected this. Within the film's dialogue, Billy interprets the animal he encounters as a \"Baryonyx\" or a \"Suchomimus\", but Dr. Grant corrects his analysis based on its size and its sail.\n\nBecause of new discoveries and theories in the field of paleontology, several dinosaurs are portrayed differently in this film than in previous ones. Discoveries suggesting \"Velociraptor\" were feathered prompted the addition of quill-like structures on the head and neck of the males in the film. \"We've found evidence that \"Velociraptors\" had feathers, or feather-like structures, and we've incorporated that into the new look of the raptor\", said paleontologist Jack Horner, the film's technical adviser.\n\nSpielberg insisted that Johnston include \"Pteranodons\", which were removed from the previous films for budget reasons, in \"Jurassic Park III\". An aquatic reptile was also featured in the first draft but was removed from the final script. The creatures were depicted using a combination of animatronics and CGI special effects. The following creatures appear in the film:\n\nJoe Johnston had been interested in directing the sequel to \"Jurassic Park\"; he approached Spielberg, a friend of his, about the project. While Spielberg wanted to direct the first sequel, he agreed Johnston could direct a possible third film. The second film, entitled \"\", includes a scene showing a \"Tyrannosaurus\" rampaging through San Diego; Spielberg had intended to use this scene for a third film but later decided to add it into the second film after realizing he probably would not direct another film in the series. After the release of the second film in May 1997, Spielberg was busy with other projects; when asked about the possibility of a third \"Jurassic Park\" film, he responded, \"It would give me a tremendous ... headache just to think about it\".\n\nUniversal Pictures announced the film on June 29, 1998, with Spielberg as a producer. Michael Crichton was reportedly going to collaborate with Spielberg to create a storyline and write a script. The film was set for release in mid-2000. Spielberg initially devised a story involving Dr. Alan Grant, who was discovered to have been living on one of InGen's islands. According to Johnston, \"He'd snuck in, after not being allowed in to research the dinosaurs, and was living in a tree like Robinson Crusoe. But I couldn't imagine this guy wanting to get back on any island that had dinosaurs in it after the first movie.\"\n\nIn June 1999, Craig Rosenberg began writing the first draft of the script, which involved teenagers becoming marooned on Isla Sorna. Johnston was announced as the film's director in August 1999, with Rosenberg still attached. Production was expected to begin in early 2000. Rosenberg's draft about teenagers on Isla Sorna was rejected in September 1999. According to Johnston it was \"not a badly written script\"; he also said, \"It read like a bad episode of \"Friends\"\". By December 1999, new writers had been hired to devise a better story for the film.\n\nThe film's second script involved a \"Pteranodon\" escaping from Isla Sorna and causing a spate of mysterious killings on the mainland, which was to be investigated by Alan Grant and other characters including Billy Brennan, a naturalist named Simone, a tough military attaché, and wealthy Paul Roby and his teenage son Miles. Grant's group crash-lands on the island while a parallel investigation is done on the mainland. The aviary sequence and laboratory set piece were initially much longer and more complex, and included a \"Velociraptor\" stealthily entering a hatchery where the team spends the night. Sets, costumes, and props were built for this script.\n\nIn February 2000, filming was reportedly set to begin in Fiordland, New Zealand, around the end of the month. Scenes were originally planned to be filmed there for \"\". In March 2000, Maui, Hawaii, was reportedly chosen instead of New Zealand. Sam Neill signed to the project in June 2000; the 18-week filming schedule was expected to begin by August that year, with a projected release in July 2001. Macy originally turned down his role due to scheduling conflicts. Trevor Morgan and Téa Leoni were cast in August 2000. Utah's Dinosaur National Monument and a military base at Oahu were being considered as filming locations. During the pre-production phase, concept artists created advertising for the film using a working titles including \"Jurassic Park: Extinction\" and \"Jurassic Park: Breakout\".\n\nFive weeks before filming began, Johnston and Spielberg rejected the entire script because they were dissatisfied with it; $18 million had already been spent on the film. Johnston felt the script's story was too complicated. The simpler \"rescue mission\" plot, which had been suggested by David Koepp, was used for the film instead. Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor began rewriting the script in July 2000.\n\nJohnston said the script was never finished during production: \"We shot pages that eventually went into the final script but we didn't have a document\". Principal photography began on August 30, 2000, at Dillingham Airfield in Mokulēia, Hawaii. Macy, commenting on the slow pace of filming the script, said \"we would do a quarter-page–some days, an eighth of a page. And that would be a full 12-hour day.\"\n\nFilming continued on Oahu until September 9. Aerial footage of Molokai's North Shore cliffs was then filmed over the next two days, which was followed by a week of filming in Kauai. Filming in Hawaii concluded on September 20, 2000. Production then moved to California; John August was hired to do uncredited work on the script in September 2000. Scenes were filmed at Occidental College in Los Angeles on October 10, 2000.\n\nScenes were filmed at Center Bay Studios in Los Angeles at the end of October. Other filming locations in California included South Pasadena and a rock quarry in Irwindale. Filming also took place at Universal Studios' backlot in Los Angeles. Production returned to Hawaii in January 2001 to film the movie's ending, which had not be written at the time of the previous Hawaiian shoot. The ending was filmed on Kauai's Pila'a Beach.\n\nThe storyline contains minor scenes taken from Crichton's novels \"Jurassic Park\" and \"The Lost World\", such as the \"Pteranodon\" aviary and the use of a boat, that did not appear in these books' film adaptations.Laura Dern's cameo was filmed in a day. In an earlier draft, Neill and Dern's characters were a couple in the process of splitting up. Johnston said, \"I didn't want to see them as a couple anymore. For one thing, I don't think they look like a couple. It would be uncomfortable to still see them together. And Laura Dern doesn't look like she's aged for the past fifteen years!\" The film's longest rough cut without credits was approximately 96 minutes long; According to Johnston, \"We lost maybe 8 minutes, so it was never really that long\".\n\nComposer John Williams was busy writing the music for Spielberg's film \"A.I. Artificial Intelligence\"; he recommended Don Davis to write the \"Jurassic Park III\" score. Williams' original themes and several new ones—such as one for the \"Spinosaurus\" that focused on low sounds, with tubas, trombones, and timpani—were integrated into the score. The fight between the \"Spinosaurus\" and the \"Tyrannosaurus\", which Davis compared to King Kong's fight with dinosaur in the 1933 film, juxtaposes the \"Spinosaurus\" theme with the one Williams wrote for the \"T. rex\". In addition, \"Big Hat, No Cattle\", a song by Randy Newman, was used in a restaurant scene.\n\n\"Jurassic Park III\" premiered at the Universal Amphitheater in Los Angeles, California, on July 16, 2001; two days later the film was released in the United States and other countries. The film earned $181,171,875 in the United States and $368,780,809 worldwide, making it the eighth-highest-grossing film of the year worldwide. It is the lowest-grossing \"Jurassic Park\" film in the series. The soundtrack was released in July 2001.\n\nThe film was released on VHS and DVD on December 11, 2001. It was re-released with both sequels in December 2001 as the \"Jurassic Park Trilogy\", and as the \"Jurassic Park Adventure Pack\" in November 2005. It has also been released as a two-disc DVD set alongside \"Hulk\". In 2011, the film was released on Blu-ray as part of the \"Jurassic Park: Ultimate Trilogy\" Blu-ray collection. \"Jurassic Park III\" is also included in the \"Jurassic Park\" 4K UHD Blu-Ray collection, which was released on May 22, 2018.\n\n\"Jurassic Park III\" has received mixed reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 50% rating based on 162 reviews, with an average rating of 5.2/10. The site's consensus states; \"\"Jurassic Park III\" is darker and faster than its predecessors, but that doesn't quite compensate for the franchise's continuing creative decline\". It has a score of 42 out of 100 on Metacritic, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". On both sites, it is the lowest-rated film of the \"Jurassic Park\" franchise.\n\n\"Entertainment Weekly\"s Owen Gleiberman, who praised the previous \"Jurassic Park\" films, awarded the third film a C grade, writing \"\"Jurassic Park III\" has no pretensions to be anything more than a goose-bumpy fantasy theme-park ride for kids, but it's such a routine ride. Spielberg's wizardry is gone, and his balletic light touch as well, and that gives too much of this 90-minute movie over to the duller-than-dull characters.\" Derek Elley of \"Variety Reviews\" called the film \"an all-action, helter-skelter, don't-forget-to-buy-the-computer-game ride that makes the two previous installments look like models of classic filmmaking\". Ben Varkontine of PopMatters called it \"not as good a ride as the first, but a damn sight better than the second\". Much of the criticism was leveled at the plot as being simply a chase movie with no character development; \"Apollo Movie Guide\" panned the film as being \"almost the same as the first movie\" with \"no need for new ideas or even a script\". \"Empire\" magazine gave the film 3 stars out of 5, calling it \"short, scrappy and intermittently scary\".\n\nOn \"Ebert and Roeper\", Richard Roeper gave it a Thumbs Down while Roger Ebert awarded a Thumbs Up. In a subsequent review, Ebert called it \"the best blockbuster of the Summer\". In his review, Ebert gave the film three stars and said it \"is not as awe-inspiring as the first film or as elaborate as the second, but in its own B-movie way it's a nice little thrill machine\". He also wrote, \"I can't praise it for its art, but I must not neglect its craft, and on that basis I recommend it\". Paleontologist Robert T. Bakker, an early pioneer of the dinosaur-bird connection, said the feathers quills added to the \"Velociraptor\" for \"Jurassic Park III\" \"looked like a roadrunner's toupee\", but conceded that feathers are difficult subjects for computer animation and speculated that \"Jurassic Park IV\"'s raptors would have more realistic with plumage. In 2002, Crichton said he had not watched the film.\n\nA teaser trailer was released online in September 2000. Universal avoided excessive early marketing to prevent a possible backlash; the studio believed awareness of the film was already sufficient. Marketing began in April 2001, three months before the film's release. The first footage from the film was aired during the second-season finale of \"Survivor\" in May 2001. Promotional partners included Kodak and The Coca-Cola Company. No fast-food promotions took place in the United States, although children's meal toys based on the film were offered in Canadian Burger King outlets.\n\nSeven video games were released to coincide with the film, and a novelization by Scott Ciencin that was aimed at young children was published. Ciencin also wrote three children's books to tie in with the film's events: \"\", the first book, detailed the eight weeks Eric spent alone on Isla Sorna; \"\" had Eric and Alan returning to Isla Sorna to rescue a group of teenage filmmakers; and \"\" involved Eric and Alan leading the \"Pteranodon\" home after they nest in a Universal Studios theme park.\n\nIn early 2001, Hasbro released a line of 3.75\" action figures including electronic dinosaurs, humans, and vehicles, to coincide with the film's release. The figures were scaled down from the original Kenner action figures from the pre-\"Jurassic Park III\" toy lines. A line of toys were also released through the Lego Studios brand. Playskool released a line of toys called Jurassic Park Junior, which were aimed at young children. A smaller line of die-cast toys and a range of clothes were also produced. In November 2001, to promote the film's impending home media release, Universal launched a viral marketing website for Isla Travel, a fictional Isla Sorna travel agency.\n\nFor the film's home media release, Universal partnered with cell-phone company Hop-On to produce \"the world's first-disposable cell phone\", which would have been available through an in-package offer upon purchase of the film. The telephones were to be delivered free to customers who responded to a winning promotional card that was supplied with selected copies of the film. Approximately 5,000 copies of the film contained a winning promotional card; approximately 1,000 of them were redeemed.\n\nThe promotion was canceled because the handsets could not be finished on time. An investigation by the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" revealed that sample versions of Hop-On's cell phones were actually modified Nokia handsets; Hop-On was having problems with its own design. Customers who were to receive the cell phones received a $30 check and a free DVD instead.\n\n\n"}

Hempelmann and Sean Harrigan from καταγελαστής (\"katagelastēs\"), Ancient Greek for \"mocker\"). Katagelasticists actively seek and establish situations in which they can laugh at others (at the expense of these people). There is a broad variety of things that katagelasticists would do—starting from harmless pranks or word plays to truly embarrassing and even harmful, mean-spirited jokes. They would be of the opinion that laughing at others is part of the daily life and if others do not like being laughed at, they should just fight back. For the katagelasticists it is fun laughing at others and there is almost nothing that might hinder them from doing so. For them, some people even might provoke getting laughed at (and surely deserve being laughed at). This condition often makes it difficult for sufferers to gain and maintain acquaintances and romantic partners. \n\nThe first academic paper to investigate this phenomenon was published in 2009. Along with gelotophobia and gelotophilia it can be measured through a questionnaire that consists of 45 questions (the PhoPhiKat-45; the PhoPhiKat-30 is a short form that consists of 30 items). This is a reliable and valid instrument that has been used in a variety of studies. The questionnaire is also online for a free self-assessment in German here. \n\nGelotophobia, gelotophilia, and katagelasticism describe three different stances towards laughter and laughing at. Empirical studies with the PhoPhiKat-45 show that, of course, people can not at the same time fear and like being laughed at (i.e., be gelotophobes and gelotophiles at the same time). However, there is at least a subgroup of gelotophobes that enjoys laughing at others, despite knowing how harmful this can be. Finally, gelotophilia and katagelasticism are positively related; i.e., those who enjoy being laughed at might also enjoy laughing at others.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1190561", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1190561", "title": "Kitchen sink realism", "text": "Kitchen sink realism\n\nKitchen sink realism (or kitchen sink drama) is a British cultural movement that developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s in theatre, art, novels, film, and television plays, whose protagonists usually could be described as \"angry young men\" who were disillusioned with modern society. It used a style of social realism, which depicted the domestic situations of working class Britons, living in cramped rented accommodation and spending their off-hours drinking in grimy pubs, to explore controversial social and political issues ranging from abortion to homelessness. The harsh, realistic style contrasted sharply with the escapism of the previous generation's so-called \"well-made plays\".\n\nThe films, plays and novels employing this style are often set in poorer industrial areas in the North of England, and use the accents and slang heard in those regions. The film \"It Always Rains on Sunday\" (1947) is a precursor of the genre, and the John Osborne play \"Look Back in Anger\" (1956) is thought of as the first of the genre. The gritty love-triangle of \"Look Back in Anger\", for example, takes place in a cramped, one-room flat in the English Midlands. Shelagh Delaney's 1958 play \"A Taste of Honey\" (which was made into a film of the same name in 1961), is about a teenage schoolgirl who has an affair with a black sailor, gets pregnant, and then moves in with a gay male acquaintance; it raises issues such as class, race, gender and sexual orientation. The conventions of the genre have continued into the 2000s, finding expression in such television shows as \"Coronation Street\" and \"EastEnders\".\n\nIn art, \"Kitchen Sink School\" was a term used by critic David Sylvester to describe painters who depicted social realist–type scenes of domestic life.\n\nThe cultural movement was rooted in the ideals of social realism, an artistic movement, expressed in the visual and other realist arts, which depicts working class activities. Many artists who subscribed to social realism were painters with socialist political views. While the movement has some commonalities with Socialist Realism, another style of realism which was the \"official art\" advocated by the governments of the Soviet Union and other Eastern Bloc countries, the two had several differences. While social realism is a broader type of art that realistically depicts subjects of social concern, Socialist realism is characterized by the glorified depiction of socialist values, such as the emancipation of the proletariat, in a realistic manner.\n\nUnlike Socialist realism, social realism is not an official art produced by, or under the supervision of the government. The leading characters are often 'anti-heroes' rather than part of a class to be admired, as in Socialist realism. Typically, protagonists in social realism are dissatisfied with their working class lives and the world, rather than being idealised workers who are part of a Socialist utopia in the process of creation. As such, social realism allows more space for the subjectivity of the author to be displayed.\n\nPartly, social realism developed as a reaction against Romanticism, which promoted lofty concepts such as the \"ineffable\" beauty and truth of art and music, and even turned them into spiritual ideals. As such, social realism focused on the \"ugly realities of contemporary life and sympathized with working class people, particularly the poor.\" (The quotation is from George Shi, of the University of Fine Arts, Valencia).\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the term \"kitchen sink\" derived from an expressionist painting by John Bratby, which contained an image of a kitchen sink. Bratby did various kitchen and bathroom-themed paintings, including three paintings of toilets. Bratby's paintings of people often depicted the faces of his subjects as desperate and unsightly. Kitchen sink realism artists painted everyday objects, such as trash cans and beer bottles. The critic David Sylvester wrote an article in 1954 about trends in recent English art, calling his article \"The Kitchen Sink\" in reference to Bratby's picture. Sylvester argued that there was a new interest among young painters in domestic scenes, with stress on the banality of life. Other artists associated with the kitchen sink style include Derrick Greaves, Edward Middleditch and Jack Smith.\n\nBefore the 1950s, the United Kingdom's working class were often depicted stereotypically in Noël Coward's drawing room comedies and British films. Kitchen sink realism was also seen as being in opposition to the \"well-made play\", the kind which theatre critic Kenneth Tynan once denounced as being set in \"Loamshire\", of dramatists like Terence Rattigan. \"Well-made plays\" were a dramatic genre from nineteenth-century theatre which found its early 20th-century codification in Britain in the form of William Archer's \"Play-Making: A Manual of Craftmanship\" (1912), and in the United States with George Pierce Baker's \"Dramatic Technique\" (1919). Kitchen sink works were created with the intention of changing all that. Their political views were initially labeled as radical, sometimes even anarchic.\n\nJohn Osborne's play \"Look Back In Anger\" (1956) depicted young men in a way that is similar to the then-contemporary \"Angry Young Men\" movement of film and theatre directors. The \"angry young men\" were a group of mostly working and middle class British playwrights and novelists who became prominent in the 1950s. Following the success of the Osborne play, the label \"angry young men\" was later applied by British media to describe young writers who were characterised by a disillusionment with traditional British society. The hero of \"Look Back In Anger\" is a graduate, but he is working in a manual occupation. It dealt with social alienation, the claustrophobia and frustrations of a provincial life on low incomes.\n\nThe impact of this work inspired Arnold Wesker and Shelagh Delaney, among numerous others, to write plays of their own. The English Stage Company at the Royal Court Theatre, headed by George Devine and Theatre Workshop organised by Joan Littlewood were particularly prominent in bringing these plays to public attention. Critic John Heilpern wrote that \"Look Back in Anger\" expressed such \"immensity of feeling and class hatred\" that it altered the course of English theatre. The term \"Angry theatre\" was coined by critic John Russell Taylor.\n\nThis was all part of the British New Wave—a transposition of the concurrent \"nouvelle vague\" film movement in France, some of whose works, such as \"The 400 Blows\" of 1959, also emphasised the lives of the urban proletariat. British filmmakers such as Tony Richardson and Lindsay Anderson (see also Free Cinema) channelled their vitriolic anger into film making. Confrontational films such as \"Saturday Night and Sunday Morning\" (1960) and \"A Taste of Honey\" (1961) were noteworthy movies in the genre. \"Saturday Night and Sunday Morning\" is about a young machinist who spends his wages at weekends on drinking and having a good time, until his affair with a married woman leads to her getting pregnant and him being beaten by her husband to the point of hospitalization. \"A Taste of Honey\"\nis about a 17-year old schoolgirl with an abusive, alcoholic mother. The schoolgirl starts a relationship with a black sailor and gets pregnant. After the sailor leaves on his ship, Jo moves in with a homosexual acquaintance, Geoffrey, who assumes the role of surrogate father. \"A Taste of Honey\" raises the issues of class, race, gender and sexual orientation.\n\nLater, as many of these writers and directors diversified, kitchen sink realism was taken up by television directors who produced television plays. The single play was then a staple of the medium, and \"Armchair Theatre\" (1956–68), produced by the ITV contractor ABC, \"The Wednesday Play\" (1964–70) and \"Play for Today\" (1970–84), both BBC series, contained many works of this kind. Jeremy Sandford's television play \"Cathy Come Home\" (1966, directed by Ken Loach for \"The Wednesday Play\" slot) for instance, addressed the then-stigmatised issue of homelessness.\n\nKitchen sink realism was also used in the novels of Stan Barstow, John Braine, Alan Sillitoe and others.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "188773", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=188773", "title": "Mountain biking", "text": "Mountain biking\n\nMountain biking is a sport of riding bicycles off-road, often over rough terrain, using specially designed mountain bikes. Mountain bikes share similarities with other bikes but incorporate features designed to enhance durability and performance in rough terrain. Mountain biking can generally be broken down into multiple categories: cross country, trail riding, all mountain (also referred to as \"Enduro\"), downhill, freeride and dirt jumping. However, the majority of mountain biking falls into the categories of Trail and Cross Country riding styles.\n\nThis non-sport requires endurance, core strength and balance, bike handling skills, and self-reliance. Advanced riders pursue both steep technical descents and high incline climbs. In the case of freeride, downhill, and dirt jumping, aerial maneuvers are performed off both natural features and specially constructed jumps and ramps.\n\nMountain bikers ride on off-road trails such as singletrack, back-country roads, fire roads, and often venture to ski resorts that stay open in the summer for such activities. Because riders are often far from civilization, there is a strong ethic of self-reliance in the sport. Riders learn to repair broken bikes and flat tires to avoid being stranded. Many riders carry a backpack, including water, food, tools for trailside repairs, and a first aid kit in case of injury. Group rides are common, especially on longer treks. Mountain bike orienteering adds the skill of map navigation to mountain biking.\n\nOne of the first examples of bicycles modified specifically for off-road use is the expedition of Buffalo Soldiers from Missoula, Montana to Yellowstone in August 1896.\n\nThe Swiss military had its first bike regiment in 1891.\nBicycles were ridden off-road by road racing cyclists who used cyclocross as a means of keeping fit during the winter. Cyclo-cross eventually became a sport in its own right in the 1940s, with the first world championship taking place in 1950.\nBetween 1951 and 1956, the French \"Velo Cross Club Parisien\" (VCCP), comprising about twenty-one young cyclists from the outskirts of Paris where they were born, developed a sport that was remarkably akin to present-day mountain biking.\n\nThe Rough Stuff Fellowship was established in 1955 by off-road cyclists in the United Kingdom. In Oregon, one Chemeketan club member, D. Gwynn, built a rough terrain trail bicycle in 1966. He named it a \"mountain bicycle\" for its intended place of use. This may be the first use of that name.\n\nIn England in 1968, Geoff Apps, a motorbike trials rider, began experimenting with off-road bicycle designs. By 1979 he had developed a custom-built lightweight bicycle which was uniquely suited to the wet and muddy off-road conditions found in the south-east of England. They were designed around 2 inch x 650b Nokian snow tires though a 700x47c (28 in.) version was also produced. These were sold under the Cleland Cycles brand until late 1984. Bikes based on the Cleland design were also sold by English Cycles and Highpath Engineering until the early 1990s.\n\nThere were several groups of riders in different areas of the U.S.A. who can make valid claims to playing a part in the birth of the sport. Riders in Crested Butte, Colorado and Cupertino, California tinkered with bikes and adapted them to the rigors of off-road riding. Modified heavy cruiser bicycles, old 1930s and '40s Schwinn bicycles retrofitted with better brakes and fat tires, were used for freewheeling down mountain trails in Marin County, California in the mid-to-late 1970s. At the time, there were no mountain bikes. The earliest ancestors of modern mountain bikes were based around frames from cruiser bicycles such as those made by Schwinn. The Schwinn Excelsior was the frame of choice due to its geometry. Riders used balloon-tired cruisers and modified them with gears and motocross or BMX-style handlebars, creating \"klunkers\". The term would also be used as a verb since the term \"mountain biking\" was not yet in use. Riders would race down mountain fireroads, causing the hub brake to burn the grease inside, requiring the riders to repack the bearings. These were called \"Repack Races\" and triggered the first innovations in mountain bike technology as well as the initial interest of the public (on Mt. Tamalpais in Marin CA, there is still a trail titled \"Repack\"- in reference to these early competitions). The sport originated in California on Marin County's Mount Tamalpais.\n\nIt was not until the late 1970s and early 1980s that road bicycle companies started to manufacture mountain bicycles using high-tech lightweight materials. Joe Breeze is normally credited with introducing the first purpose-built mountain bike in 1978. Tom Ritchey then went on to make frames for a company called MountainBikes, a partnership between Gary Fisher, Charlie Kelly, John Frey (Marin County mountain biking innovator) and Tom Ritchey. Tom Ritchey, a welder with skills in frame building, also built the original bikes. The company's three partners eventually dissolved their partnership, and the company became Fisher Mountain Bikes, while Tom Ritchey started his own frame shop. The first mountain bikes were basically road bicycle frames (with heavier tubing and different geometry) with a wider frame and fork to allow for a wider tire. The handlebars were also different in that they were a straight, transverse-mounted handlebar, rather than the dropped, curved handlebars that are typically installed on road racing bicycles. Also, some of the parts on early production mountain bicycles were taken from the BMX bicycle. Other contributors were Otis Guy and Keith Bontrager.\n\nTom Ritchey built the first regularly available mountain bike frame, which was accessorized by Gary Fisher and Charlie Kelly and sold by their company called MountainBikes (later changed to Fisher Mountain Bikes then bought by Trek, still under the name Gary Fisher, currently sold as Trek's \"Gary Fisher Collection\"). The first two mass-produced mountain bikes were sold in the early 1980s: the Specialized Stumpjumper and Univega Alpina Pro. In 1988 \"The Great Mountain Biking Video\" was released, soon followed by others. In 2007 \"\" was released, documenting mountain bike history during the formative period in Northern California. Additionally, a group of mountain bikers called the Laguna Rads formed a club during the mid eighties and began a weekly ride, exploring the uncharted coastal hillsides of Laguna Beach, Ca. Industry insiders suggest that this was the birth of the freeride movement, as they were cycling up and down hills and mountains where no cycling specific trail network prexisted. The Laguna Rads also hold the longest running dowhill race once a year since 1986.\n\nAt the time, the bicycle industry was not impressed with the mountain bike, which many regarded as a short-term fad. In particular, large manufacturers such as Schwinn and Fuji failed to see the significance of an all-terrain bicycle and the coming boom in 'adventure sports'. Instead, the first mass-produced mountain bikes were pioneered by new companies such as MountainBikes (later, Fisher Mountain Bikes), Ritchey, and Specialized. Specialized was an American startup company that arranged for production of mountain bike frames from factories in Japan and Taiwan. First marketed in 1981, Specialized's mountain bike largely followed Tom Ritchey's frame geometry, but used TiG welding to join the frame tubes instead of fillet-brazing, a process better suited to mass production and which helped to reduce labor and manufacturing cost. The bikes were configured with 15 gears using derailleurs, a triple chainring, and a cogset with five sprockets.\n\nThroughout the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, mountain biking moved from a little-known sport to a mainstream activity. Mountain bikes and mountain bike gear, that was once only available at specialty shops or via mail order, became available at standard bike stores. By the mid-first decade of the 21st century, even some department stores began selling inexpensive mountain bikes with full-suspension and disc brakes. In the first decade of the 21st century, trends in mountain bikes included the \"all-mountain bike\", the 29er and the one by drive train. \"All-mountain bikes\" were designed to descend and handle well in rough conditions, but still pedal efficiently for climbing, and were intended to bridge the gap between cross-country bikes and those built specifically for downhill riding. They are characterized by of travel. 29er bikes are those using 700c sized rims (as do most road bikes), but wider and suited for tires of two inches (50mm) width or more; the increased diameter wheel is able to roll over obstacles better and offers a greater tire contact patch, but also results in a longer wheelbase, making the bike less agile, and in less travel space for the suspension. The single-speed is considered a return to simplicity with no drivetrain components or shifters but thus requires a stronger rider.\n\nFollowing the growing trend in 29-inch bikes (29ers as stated above), there have been other trends in the mountain biking community involving tire size. One of the more prevalent is the new, somewhat esoteric and exotic 650B (27.5 inch) wheelsize, based on the obscure wheel size for touring road bikes. Another interesting trend in mountain bikes is outfitting dirt jump or urban bikes with rigid forks. These bikes normally use 4–5\" travel suspension forks. The resulting product is used for the same purposes as the original bike. A commonly cited reason for making the change to a rigid fork is the enhancement of the rider's ability to transmit force to the ground, which is important for performing tricks. In the mid-first decade of the 21st century, an increasing number of mountain bike-oriented resorts opened. Often, they are similar to or in the same complex as a ski resort or they retrofit the concrete steps and platforms of an abandoned factory as an obstacle course, as with Ray's MTB Indoor Park. Mountain bike parks which are operated as summer season activities at ski hills usually include chairlifts which are adapted to bikes, a number of trails of varying difficulty, and bicycle rental facilities.\n\n\n\nThe level of protection worn by individual riders varies greatly and is affected by speed, trail conditions, the weather, experience, fitness, desired style and numerous other factors, including personal choice. Protection becomes more important where these factors may be considered to increase the possibility or severity of a crash.\n\nA helmet and gloves are usually regarded as sufficient for the majority of non-technical riding. Full-face helmets, goggles and armored suits or jackets are frequently used in downhill mountain biking, where the extra bulk and weight may help mitigate the risks of bigger and more frequent crashes.\n\nProtective gear cannot provide immunity against injuries. For example, concussions can still occur despite the use of helmets, and spinal injuries can still occur with the use of spinal padding and neck braces. The use of high-tech protective gear can result in a revenge effect, whereupon some cyclists feel safe taking dangerous risks. Because the key determinant of injury risk is kinetic energy, and because kinetic energy increases with the square of speed, effectively each doubling of speed quadruples the injury risk. Higher speeds of travel also add danger due to reaction time. Because higher speeds mean that the rider travels further during his/her reaction time, this leaves less travel distance within which to react safely. This, in turn, further multiplies the risk of an injurious crash.\n\nCross-Country (XC) generally means riding point-to-point or in a loop including climbs and descents on a variety of terrain. A typical XC bike weighs around 9-13 kilos (20-30 lbs), and has of suspension travel front and sometimes rear. Cross country mountain biking focuses on physical strength and endurance more than the other forms, which require greater technical skill. Cross country mountain biking is the only mountain biking discipline in the Summer Olympic Games.\n\nAll-mountain/Enduro uses bikes with a moderate-travel suspension systems and components that are usually stronger than XC models, but a weight still suitable for climbing and descending. While traditionally called All-mountain riding, this style has been adopted to the Enduro World Series.\n\nThere are two formats of Enduro racing. \"Big-Mountain\" Enduro is similar to a DH course, but is much longer, sometimes taking a full day to complete and often incorporates climbing sections. \"Gravity\" enduro uses roughly equal amounts uphill and downhill, but the uphill segments are not timed. Typically, there is a maximum time limit on how long a rider has to reach the top of the climb. There is also a third category called \"super-D\" which is similar to XC, but has sustained climbs followed by sustained descents, with the climbs less technical than the descents.\n\nEnduro racing is seen as the \"everyman's\" race in North America, and while there are still extremely high level riders such as Jérôme Clémentz that race enduro full-time, most enduro racers compete for fun.\n\nDownhill (DH) is, in the most general sense, riding mountain bikes downhill. Courses include large jumps (up to and including ), drops of 3+ meters (10+ feet), and are generally rough and steep from top to bottom. The rider commonly travels to the point of descent by other means than cycling, such as a ski lift or automobile, as the weight of the downhill mountain bike often precludes any serious climbing.\n\nDownhill racers must possess a unique combination of total body strength, aerobic and anaerobic fitness, mental control, as well as the acceptance of a relatively high risk of incurring serious injury.\n\nBecause of their extremely steep terrain (often located in summer at ski resorts), downhill is one of the most extreme and dangerous cycling disciplines. Minimum body protection in a true downhill setting entails wearing knee pads and a full-face helmet with goggles, albeit riders and racers commonly wear full-body suits that include padding at various locations.\n\nDownhill-specific bikes are universally equipped with front and rear suspension, large disc brakes, and use heavier frame tubing than other mountain bikes. Downhill bicycles now weigh around , while the most expensive professional downhill mountain bikes can weigh as little as , fully equipped with custom carbon fiber parts, air suspension, tubeless tires and more. Downhill frames have anywhere from of travel and are usually equipped with a travel dual-crown fork.\n\nFour-cross/Dual Slalom (4X) is a discipline in which riders compete either on separate tracks, as in Dual Slalom, or on a short slalom track, as in 4X. Most bikes used are light hard-tails, although the last World Cup was actually won on a full suspension bike. The tracks have dirt jumps, berms, and gaps.\n\nProfessionals in \"\" tend to concentrate either on downhill mountain biking or 4X/dual slalom because they are very different. However, some riders, such as Cedric Gracia, still do 4X and DH, although that is becoming more rare as 4X takes on its own identity.\n\nFreeride / Big Hit / Hucking, as the name suggests, is a 'do anything' discipline that encompasses everything from downhill racing without the clock to jumping, riding 'North Shore' style (elevated trails made of interconnecting bridges and logs), and generally riding trails and/or stunts that require more skill and aggressive techniques than XC.\n\n\"Slopestyle\" type riding is an increasingly popular genre that combines big-air, stunt-ridden freeride with BMX style tricks. Slopestyle courses are usually constructed at already established mountain bike parks and include jumps, large drops, quarter-pipes, and other wooden obstacles. There are always multiple lines through a course and riders compete for judges' points by choosing lines that highlight their particular skills.\n\nA \"typical\" freeride bike is hard to define, but typical specifications are 13-18 kilos (30-40 lbs) with of suspension front and rear. Freeride bikes are generally heavier and more amply suspended than their XC counterparts, but usually retain much of their climbing ability. It is up to the rider to build his or her bike to lean more toward a preferred level of aggressiveness.\n\nDirt Jumping (DJ) is the practice of riding bikes over shaped mounds of dirt or soil and becoming airborne. The goal is that after riding over the 'take off' the rider will become airborne, and aim to land on the 'landing'. Dirt jumping can be done on almost any bicycle, but the bikes chosen are generally smaller and more maneuverable hardtails so that tricks e.g. backflips, are easier to complete. The bikes are simpler so that when a crash occurs there are fewer components to break or cause the rider injury. Bikes are typically built from sturdier materials such as steel to handle repeated heavy impacts of crashes and bails.\n\nTrials riding consists of hopping and jumping bikes over obstacles, without touching a foot onto the ground. It can be performed either off-road or in an urban environment. This requires an excellent sense of balance. The emphasis is placed on techniques of effectively overcoming the obstacles, although street-trials (as opposed to competition-oriented trials) is much like Street and DJ, where doing tricks with style is the essence. Trials bikes look almost nothing like mountain bikes. They use either 20\", 24\" or 26\" wheels and have very small, low frames, some types without a saddle.\n\nUrban/Street is essentially the same as urban BMX (or Freestyle BMX), in which riders perform tricks by riding on/over man made objects. The bikes are the same as those used for Dirt Jumping, having 24\" or 26\" wheels. Also, they are very light, many in the range of , and are typically hardtails with between 0-100 millimeters of front suspension. As with Dirt Jumping and Trials, style and execution are emphasized.\nTrail riding or trail biking is recreational mountain biking on recognised, and often waymarked, trails; unpaved tracks, forest paths, etc. Trails may take the form of single routes or part of a larger complexes, known as trail centres. There are \"trail bike\" designs for this activity.\n\nMountain Bike Touring or Marathon is long-distance touring on dirt roads and single track with a mountain bike.\n\nWith the popularity of the Great Divide Trail, the Colorado Trail and other long-distance off-road biking trails, specially outfitted mountain bikes are increasingly being used for touring. Bike manufacturers like Salsa have even developed MTB touring bikes like the Fargo model.\n\nMixed Terrain Cycle-Touring or rough riding is a form of mountain-bike touring but involves cycling over a variety of surfaces and topography on a single route, with a single bicycle that is expected to be satisfactory for all segments. The recent surge in popularity of mixed-terrain touring is in part a reaction against the increasing specialization of the bicycle industry. Mixed-terrain bicycle travel has a storied history of focusing on efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and freedom of travel over varied surfaces.\n\nBikepacking is a self-supported style of lightly-loaded single or multiple night mountain biking. Bikepacking is similar to bike touring, however the two sports generally use different bikes and the main difference is the method of carrying gear. Bikepacking generally involves carrying less gear and using smaller frame bags while bike touring will use panniers.\n\nA typical bikepacking set-up includes a frame bag, handlebar roll, seat pack and backpack and typical gear includes lightweight and basic camping gear, and a bike repair kit.\n\nMountain bikes are generally used as many bike packing destinations are reached via forest-service roads or singletrack trails. Mountain bikes specific to bike-packing use a slightly taller frame to get the maximum framebag capacity. This is achieved by using a longer headtube, a more horizontal top tube and a reduced stem degree.\n\nGenerally, bikepackers tend to cover anywhere from 25 to 75 miles (40 – 120 km) in a given day as the riding can be technical.\n\nInjuries are a given factor when mountain biking, especially in the more extreme disciplines such as downhill biking. Injuries range from minor wounds, such as cuts and abrasions from falls on gravel or other surfaces, to major injuries such as broken bones, head or spinal injuries resulting from impacts with rocks, trees or the terrain being ridden on. Another risk factor is that mountain biking takes places in wilderness area so emergency response will be delayed in case of injury. \n\nProtective equipment can protect against minor injuries and reduce the extent or seriousness of major impacts, but may not protect a rider from major impacts or accidents. To reduce the risk of injury, a rider must also take steps to minimize the risk of accidents, and thus the potential for injury; by choosing trails which fall within the range of their experience level, ensuring that they are fit enough to deal with the trail they have chosen, and keeping their bike in top mechanical condition.\n\nIf a mountain biker wishes to explore more dangerous trails or disciplines, such as downhill riding, they must learn new skills, such as jumping and avoiding obstacles.\n\nWhere a rider lacks the fitness required to ride a particular class of trail, they may become fatigued, putting themselves at an increased risk of having an accident.\n\nLastly, maintenance of the rider's bike needs to be carried out more frequently for mountain biking than for casual commuter biking. Mountain biking places higher demands on every part of the bike. Jumps and impacts can crack the frame or damage components or the tire rims, and steep, fast descents can quickly wear out brake pads. Since the widespread adoption of hydraulic and mechanical disk brakes on most mountain bikes from the late 1990's, the issues of brake pad wear, misalignment with, or slippage of rim brake pads on rims designed for rim brakes or \"V brakes\", has become a non issue. Thus, whereas a casual rider may only check over and maintain their bike every few months,a mountain biker should check and properly maintain the bike before and after every ride.\n\nMountain bikers have faced land access issues from the beginnings of the sport. Some areas where the first mountain bikers have ridden have faced extreme restrictions or elimination of riding.\n\nOpposition to the sport has led to the development of local, regional, and international mountain bike groups. The different groups that formed generally work to create new trails, maintain existing trails, and help existing trails that may have issues. Groups work with private and public entities from the individual landowner to city parks departments, on up through the state level at the DNR, and into the federal level. Different groups will work individually or together to achieve results.\n\nAdvocacy organizations work through numerous methods such as education, trail work days, and trail patrols. Examples of the education an advocacy group can provide include: Educate local bicycle riders, property managers, and other user groups on the proper development of trails, and on the International Mountain Bicycling Association's (IMBA), \"Rules of the Trail.\" Examples of trail work days can include: Flagging, cutting, and signing a new trail, or removing downed trees after a storm. A trail patrol is a bike rider who has had some training to help assist other (including non-cyclists) trail users.\n\nThe IMBA is a non-profit advocacy group whose mission is to create, enhance and preserve trail opportunities for mountain bikers worldwide. IMBA serves as an umbrella organization for mountain biking advocacy worldwide, and represents more than 700 affiliated mountain biking groups. The group was originally formed to fight widespread trail closures. In 1988, five California mountain bike clubs linked to form IMBA. The founding clubs were: Concerned Off Road Bicyclists Association, Bicycle Trails Council East Bay, Bicycle Trails Council Marin, Sacramento Rough Riders, and Responsible Organized Mountain.\n\nAccording to a review published by the International Mountain Bicycling Association, the environmental impact of mountain biking, as a relatively new sport, is poorly understood. The review notes that \"as with all recreational pursuits, it is clear that mountain biking contributes some degree of environmental degradation\". Mountain biking can result in both soil and vegetation damage, which can be caused by skidding, but also by the construction of unauthorised features such as jumps and bridges, and trails themselves. Several studies have reported that a mountain bike's impact on a given length of trail surface is comparable to that of a hiker, and substantially less than that of an equestrian or motorized off-road vehicle.\n\nA critical literature review by Jason Lathrop on the ecological impact of mountain biking notes that while recreational trail use in general is well studied, few studies explore the specific impact of mountain biking. He quotes the Bureau of Land Management: \"An estimated 13.5 million mountain bicyclists visit public lands each year to enjoy the variety of trails. What was once a low use activity that was easy to manage has become more complex\".\n\nThe environmental impacts of mountain biking can be greatly reduced by not riding on wet or sensitive trails, keeping speeds modest so as to minimize cornering forces and braking forces, not skidding, and by staying on the trail.\n\nMountain biking has been demonstrated to act as a human-mediated form of seed dispersal. Due to advancements in technology mountain bikers have begun to move onto trail networks once only accessible by hikers. The nature of their movement patterns also plays an important role as a vector for seed dispersal. Mountain bikes are not bound to any specific type of infrastructure and can therefore move freely between ecological environments acting as a connecting dispersal vector between habitats. Combined with their relatively long range and speeds they also contribute to long-range dispersal. In an effort to understand and assess the socio-ecological consequences of mountain bikes as a vector for seed dispersal Fabio Weiss, Tyler J. Brummer, and Gesine Pufal conducted an environmental impact study on forest trails in Freiburg, Germany. The results of the study found that although the majority of seeds detached from tires within the first 5–20 meters; small portions of seeds were still present after 200–500 meters contributing to moderate dispersal. The potential for long-distance dispersal was found through the transport of seeds on areas of the bike that did not come into frequent contact with the ground. The study also found that the majority of participants only cleaned their bikes on average every 70 km or every two rides. Rides executed in two different areas have the potential to connect previously unconnected habitats creating the potential for unwanted plant invasions.<br>\n<br>\nTo mitigate the accidental dispersal of an unwanted invasive species, the authors of the study proposed the following measures to support conservation:\n\na) Clean the bike between rides in different habitats, before traveling and especially before entering sensitive natural areas and regions.<br>\nb) Control weeds and non-native species at trailheads and trail margins.<br>\nc) Educate mountain bike riders about the potential dispersal of different species (good stewardship begets riding privileges).<br>\nd) Encourage cooperation between mountain bikers and managing authorities (avoid condescending regulations, establishment of monitored designated riding areas).<br>\n\n"}

The film's story is a follow-up to \"Ong Bak 2\", where Tien (Tony Jaa) is put to be brutally beaten by Lord Rajasena (Sarunyu Wongkrajang)'s men. He is helped to recover by Master Bua (Nirut Sirijanya), and when Tien returns to his village, he finds it taken over by Bhuti Sangkha (Dan Chupong).\n\nIn the year 1431 in Thailand, Tien (Tony Jaa) is held captive being beaten with wooden staves. On the orders of Lord Rajasena (Sarunyu Wongkrajang), his elbows and knees are snapped. As Lord Rajasena sleeps, Tien's guerilla fighters attempt to free Tien, but Bhuti Sangkha (Dan Chupong) appears and kills them. Lord Rajasena offers to hire Bhuti, but he refuses and gives the offer to remove the curse which has been placed on Rajasena before leaving. Rajasena orders his men to kill Tien, but before this can be carried out, a man arrives with a pardon from the king, indicating that he will take Tien, much to Rajasena's ire. The messenger returns Tien to the Kana Khone villagers. After fending off the village from invaders who are after Tien, Master Bua (Nirut Sirijanya) feels guilty over Tien's imprisonment and becomes a Buddhist monk. Pim (Primrata Det-Udom) heals Tien to life, but finds that Tien is still crippled from his beatings. Tien then embarks on a rehabilitation regimen with the help of Master Bua.\n\nRajasena visits Bhuti at his temple to remove his curse, but Bhuti reveals his true motive of usurping Rajasena and becoming the new king. After a battle, Bhuti decapitates Rajasena, but his severed head curses Bhuti. After meditating, Tien returns to his village to find it in ruins, and the surviving villagers kidnapped and enslaved by Bhuti. Bhuti uses his magic to summon an eclipse. When Pim reveals herself as Tien's companion, she is taken to Bhuti's palace, where she is killed. Tien witnesses this killing from a statue and fights his way through the guards before confronting Bhuti, who launches a spear at Tien's chest. As he falls to his knees, defeated, he remembers Bua's words, and finds himself again atop the statue. Overcoming Bhuti's illusion, lightning strikes and Bhuti's eclipse magic is dispelled. Bhuti attempts to escape but is confronted by Tien. Bhuti attempts again to throw a spear at Tien, who catches and throws it aside. On the royal ledge above the arena, Tien's upright finger tips hold Bhuti aloft by his chin. Suddenly an elephant's trunk butts the doors below the ledge, causing Bhuti to fall from Tien's grasp. Bhuti falls, over the elephant's tusks. The camera pans as we watch Bhuti dying on the ground, pierced by the elephant's broken tusk. As he breaths his last breath, the elephant, now resembling the one tusk Ganesha, raises his head in a victorious trumpet. Beginning life anew, with good having triumphed over evil, the final scene opens as Tien, Pim and the remaining villagers, pray before the statue of Ong Bak.\n\n\nAfter the first two weeks of \"Ong Bak 2\" theatrical release, the president of Sahamongkol Film announced their intention of a sequel. Filming of new footage for the follow-up was to begin before the end of the year and was to incorporate unused footage from \"Ong Bak 2\".\n\n\"Ong Bak 3\" was released in Thailand on May 5, 2010. On its first week it played in 135 theaters in Thailand and was the second highest grossing film in the Thai box office, earning $555,823. \"Ong Bak 3\" earned $1,335,646 during its theatrical run in Thailand and grossed a total of $2,325,473 with foreign markets. \nThis was less successful than \"Ong Bak 2\", which had made $8,936,663 in total. \"Ong Bak 3\" had its North American premiere at Fantastic Fest on September 23, 2010.\nThe film was released on DVD and Blu-ray in Australia on November 8, 2010, and in the United States on February 8, 2011.\n\nThe film has received generally negative reviews. Both \"Empire\" and Film Business Asia praised the action scenes but pointed out the weak story. Film Business Asia gave the film a five out of ten rating praising the action sequences but finding that it made \"Ong Bak 2\" \"look like a masterpiece of character development.\" \"Variety\" and \"Total Film\" found the film spent too much focus on Buddhist philosophy that left not enough time for the action scenes. \"Total Film\" awarded the film two stars out of five, stating that \"a greater focus on Buddhist philosophy...leaves little room for the sort of bone-crunching, no-frills set-pieces that first brought Jaa to our attention.\" \"Slant Magazine\" gave the film three stars out of four praising it as \"easily the most brutal of all the contemporary Thai martial arts films that have come to the U.S. thus far. But that's what characterizes the Thai style of fighting films: inspired excess and decadence.\"\n\n\"Ong Bak Tri\" is being developed by Studio Hive and will be published worldwide by Immanitas Entertainment for PC, smartphones, PlayStation Network, and Xbox Live Marketplace. It will be a 2.5D side-scrolling brawler with \"intense fighting action, impressive free-running sequences, and highly cinematic quick-time action events,\" according to the press release. The game, like the second and third films, is set in ancient Thailand. No official release date has been announced.\n\n"}

It was directed by Alexandre Aja and has an ensemble cast featuring Elisabeth Shue, Adam Scott, Jerry O'Connell, Ving Rhames, Steven R. McQueen, Jessica Szohr, Christopher Lloyd, Richard Dreyfuss, Dina Meyer, Kelly Brook, Riley Steele and Eli Roth. A sequel, Piranha 3DD, was released in 2012.\n\nFisherman Matt Boyd (Richard Dreyfuss) is fishing in Lake Victoria when a small earthquake hits, splitting the lake floor and causing a whirlpool. Boyd falls in, and is ripped apart by a school of piranhas that emerge from the chasm.\n\nJake Forester (Steven R. McQueen) is admiring attractive tourists as spring break begins. He reunites with his old crush Kelly Driscoll (Jessica Szohr) and meets her arrogant boyfriend who soaks Jake with a slush drink. Jake then meets Derrick Jones (Jerry O'Connell), a sleazy pornographer, as well as Danni Arslow (Kelly Brook), one of his actresses. Derrick convinces Jake to show him good spots on the lake for filming a pornographic movie. That night, Jake's mother, Sheriff Julie Forester (Elisabeth Shue), searches for the missing Matt Boyd with Deputy Fallon (Ving Rhames). They find his mutilated body and contemplate closing the lake. However, this decision is made difficult as two-thousand partying college students are on spring break, which is important for bringing revenue to the small town. The next morning, a lone cliff diver is attacked and consumed by the vicious, marauding piranhas.\n\nJake bribes his sister, Laura (Brooklynn Proulx), and brother, Zane (Sage Ryan), to stay home alone so that he can show Derrick around the lake. After Jake leaves, Zane convinces Laura to go fishing on a small sandbar island. They forget to tie the boat down and are stranded in the middle of the lake. Meanwhile, Jake goes to meet with Derrick and runs into Kelly, who accepted Derrick's invitation on board his boat, \"The Barracuda\". Jake meets Crystal Shepard (Riley Steele), another one of Derrick's actresses, and cameraman Andrew Cunningham (Paul Scheer).\n\nJulie takes a team of seismologist divers—Novak Radzinsky (Adam Scott), Sam Montez (Ricardo Chavira), and Paula Montellano (Dina Meyer) to the fissure. Novak speculates that the rift leads to a buried prehistoric lake. Paula and Sam scuba dive to the bottom and discover a large cavern filled with large piranha egg stocks. Both are killed by the piranhas before they can alert the others to the discovery. Novak and Julie find Paula's corpse and pull it onto the boat, capturing a lone piranha, which they take to Carl Goodman (Christopher Lloyd), a retired marine biologist who runs a pet store and aquarium shop. He explains that it is a highly aggressive prehistoric species, long believed to be extinct, and that the piranhas have survived through cannibalism. The species is able to vigorously devour its prey in seconds.\n\nJulie, Novak, Fallon, and Deputy Taylor Roberts try to evacuate the lake, but their warnings are ignored, until the piranhas begin to fiercely attack the tourists. Novak boards a jet-ski with a shotgun to help while Fallon drags people to shore, and Julie and Taylor try to get swimmers into the police boat. Almost everyone, in the lake is either wounded, dismembered, or killed by the piranhas altogether, including Kelly's boyfriend. The remaining tourists escape as the party spot rapidly turns into a bloodbath.\n\nMeanwhile, Jake spots Laura and Zane on the island and forces Derrick to rescue them. Derrick crashes the boat into some rocks, flooding the boat's lower deck and causing the boat to begin sinking. Kelly is trapped in the kitchen while Derrick, Crystal and Andrew fall overboard from the impact of the collision. Crystal is eaten, and Andrew escapes to shore unharmed. Meanwhile, Danni manages to get a partially eaten Derrick back on board, where he then dies.\n\nDeputy Fallon makes a last stand, taking a boat motor and using its propeller to shred many piranhas, though he is presumed to be killed by the piranhas. After the chaos settles, Julie receives a call from Jake pleading for help. Julie and Novak steal a speedboat and head off towards the kids. They reach Jake and attach a rope to his boat. Julie, Danni, Laura and Zane start crossing the rope, but the piranhas latch onto Danni's hair, causing her to lose her grip on the rope and fall into the water, where she is quickly devoured. The others make it across safely, but the rope comes loose. Using Derrick's corpse as a distraction, Jake ties the line to himself and goes to save Kelly. He ties Kelly to him and lights a flare after releasing the gas from a pair of stored propane tanks. Novak starts the boat and speeds away just as the piranhas surround Kelly and Jake. They are dragged to safety as the propane tanks explode, destroying the boat and killing most of the piranhas.\n\nMr. Goodman calls Julie on the radio, and Julie tells him that they seem to have killed the majority of the piranhas. A horrified Goodman tells her that the reproductive glands on the piranha they obtained were not mature, which means that the fish they have killed were only the babies. As Novak wonders aloud where the parents are, the human sized-piranha queen leaps out of the water and eats him.\n\n\nRichard Dreyfuss said that he accepted the role after Bob Weinstein persuaded him by offering him a larger salary, which Dreyfuss later donated to charity. Dreyfuss also stated that the ill-fated character he plays is a parody and a near-reincarnation of Matt Hooper, the character he portrayed in the film \"Jaws\" (1975), with whom his character shares the same first name. \"Jaws\" later served as inspiration for the parody film entitled \"Piranha\". The song the character in \"Piranha 3D\" listens to on the radio on his boat is \"Show Me the Way to Go Home\", which Richard Dreyfuss, Roy Scheider and Robert Shaw sing together aboard Quint's boat the \"Orca\" in \"Jaws\".\n\nEli Roth, Ashlynn Brooke, Bonnie Morgan, Genevieve Alexandra and Gianna Michaels appear as spring breakers who meet gruesome demises, while Franck Khalfoun and Jason Spisak portray deputies.\n\nChuck Russell was originally scheduled to direct the film, and made uncredited rewrites to the script by Josh Stolberg and Peter Goldfinger, as well as incorporating the original John Sayles script that Joe Dante directed the first time around. Alexandre Aja was selected to direct the film instead.\n\nProduction on the film was scheduled to begin late 2008, but was delayed until March 2009. In October 2008, Aja stated filming would begin in the spring. He further stated \"It's such a difficult movie, not only because of the technicality of it and the CGI fish, but also because it all happens in a lake. We were supposed to start shooting now, but the longer to leave it the colder the water gets. The movie takes place during Spring Break and, of course, the studio wanted it ready for the summer, but if you've got 1,000 people who need to get murdered in the water, you have to wait for the right temperature for the water, for the weather, for everything.\"\n\nShooting took place in June 2009 at Bridgewater Channel in Lake Havasu, located in Lake Havasu City, Arizona. The water was also dyed red for the shooting.\n\nCiting constraints with 3D camera rigs, Aja shot \"Piranha\" in 2D and converted to 3D in post production using a 3D conversion process developed by Michael Roderick and used by the company, Inner-D. Unlike some other 3D converted films released in 2010, \"Piranha\"'s conversion was not done as an afterthought, and it was one of the first post-conversion processes to be well received by critics.\n\n\"Piranha 3D\"s theatrical release date had been set for April 16, 2010, but was delayed. The film was planned to premiere on August 27, 2010, but in June 2010 was moved to August 20, 2010. The film's first trailer debuted with \"Avatar\". A second trailer was shown in prints of \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" and \"Inception\". It was set to have a panel on 24 July 2010 as part of the San Diego Comic-Con International but was cancelled after convention organizers decided the footage that was planned to be shown was not appropriate. Nine minutes of footage, with some unfinished effects, were leaked onto websites. The clip used in promotional TV ads and the trailer that shows Jessica Szohr's character, Kelly, face to face with a pack of piranhas was not used in the movie, and was used for promotion only.\n\nThe official poster was released June 22, 2010.\n\n\"Piranha 3D\" grossed $10,106,872 in its first 3 days, opening at #6 in the United States box office. In the United Kingdom, \"Piranha 3D\" opened at #4 at the box office, earning £1,487,119. As of May 16, 2011, Piranha 3D has made $83,188,165 worldwide.\n\n\"Piranha 3D\" received generally positive reviews. It is certified \"fresh\" on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes with an approval rating of 73% and an average score of 6.2 out of 10, based on 120 reviews. The consensus reads \"Playing exactly to expectations for a movie about killer fish run amok, \"Piranha 3-D\" dishes out gore, guffaws and gratuitous nudity with equal glee.\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film has received a score of 53, based on 20 reviews, which indicates \"mixed or average reviews\". A tongue-in-cheek scholarly review of the movie was written for the journal \"Copeia\" (Chakrabarty & Fink 2011), which reviewed the movie as if it were a documentary film.\n\n\"Empire\" gave the film three out of five stars, saying \"Remember the film you hoped \"Snakes on a Plane\" would be – this is it! By any sane cinematic standards, meretricious trash ... but thrown at you with such good-humoured glee that it's hard to resist. It's a bumper-sticker of a movie: honk if you love tits and gore! Honk honk honk.\" Christy Lemire, film critic for the Associated Press, said \"Run, don't walk: \"Piranha 3D\" is hilariously, cleverly gory. Mere words cannot describe how awesomely gnarly \"Piranha 3D\" is, how hugely entertaining, and how urgently you must get yourself to the theatre to see it. Like, now.\" HollywoodLife.com called the film \"a campy masterpiece of a movie\", adding \"If you have an ounce of fun in your body, you will love this movie about killer piranhas that overtake a town of hottiesin 3D!\" Peter Hall of Cinematical.com said \"The gore, the nudity, the language, the gags, the charactersit's all always on the rise. Just when you think things could not possibly get more ridiculous, that the film has peaked, Aja and screenwriters Pete Goldfinger and Josh Stolberg manage to ram another syringe of adrenaline into its heart.\" \"The Hollywood Reporter\" referred to the film as \"a pitch-perfect, guilty-pleasure serving of late-summer schlock that handily nails the tongue-in-cheek spirit of the Roger Corman original\" while stating \"\"Jaws\" it ain'tAja exhibits little patience for such stuff as dramatic tension and tautly coiled suspense, and there are some undeniable choppy bits...but he never loses sight of the potential fun factor laid out in Pete Goldfinger and Josh Stolberg's script.\" The \"Orlando Sentinel\" gave the film one and a half stars out of four, stating that \"\"Piranha 3D\" goes for the jugular. And generally misses, but generally in an amusing way.\"\n\nThe film was released on DVD, Blu-ray, and Blu-ray 3D formats on Tuesday, January 11, 2011. The \"3D\" part of the title was taken off the 2D releases to prevent confusion of the two formats. The film was released in Australia on Thursday, December 30, 2010. The film was shown on British television on Channel 5 on February 10, 2013 for the first time, and in 2D format.\n\nLakeshore Records released the soundtrack album of Piranha 3D which included mostly rap, dance, hip-hop and R&B music. Artists include Shwayze, Envy, Flatheads, Amanda Blank, Public Enemy, Dub Pistols, and Hadouken!.\n\n\n\nDimension Films announced a sequel shortly after the first film was released. The film is \"Piranha 3DD\" and is directed by John Gulager with Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan writing. It was released on June 1, 2012. It stars Danielle Panabaker, Matt Bush, David Koechner, Chris Zylka, Katrina Bowden and Gary Busey, with Ving Rhames, Paul Scheer and Christopher Lloyd reprising their roles from \"Piranha 3D\". \"Piranha 3DD\" is set at a waterpark where the piranhas find a way through the pipes.\n\nFollowing its release, it failed to generate the positive critical reaction of its predecessor and grossed only $8,493,728.\n\n"}

{"id": "10643346", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10643346", "title": "Prostitution in Italy", "text": "Prostitution in Italy\n\nIn Italy, prostitution (), defined as the exchange of sexual acts for money, is legal, although organized prostitution, whether indoors in brothels or controlled by third parties, is prohibited. Brothels were banned in 1958. A euphemism often used to refer to street prostitutes in Italy is \"Lucciole\" (lit. \"fireflies\"), while escorts are referred to as \"Squillo\" (onomatopoeia referring to the sound of a ringing telephone, making it analogous to \"call girl\").\n\nProstitution thrived in Italy in the Middle Ages. The city of Venice declared in 1358 that brothels were indispensable, and courtesans achieved high social status in Venice, particularly in the 17th century.\n\nThe \"Regolamentazione\", or the \"regulation system of prostitution\", was established in 1861, with Italian unification, modeled on the French Napoleonic system of \"Réglementation\" and the Bureau des Moeurs (a government office tasked with regulating vice, which included officially registering prostitutes). An 1859 decree, by Count Camillo Benso di Cavour to aid the French army which supported the Piedmontese in their fight against Austria, authorized the opening of houses controlled by the state for the exercise of prostitution in Lombardy. On 15 February 1860, the decree was signed into law (referred to as \"Legge Cavour\") with the enactment of the \"Regulations of the Security Service on Prostitution\".\n\nA further law (\"Legge Crispi\"), adopted on 29 March 1888, prohibited the selling of food and drinks, and parties, dances, and songs in brothels, and banned such establishments near places of worship, schools, and kindergartens. It also provided that the shutters should always remain closed, which is the origin of the Italian expression \"closed houses\" (\"case chiuse\"). A further amendment was the \"Legge Nicotera\" of 1891. Under this system, prostitution in Italy was fully legal in private houses. A system of \"sifilicomi\" (hospitals for sex workers) was also set up, under the belief that they were the main sources of spreading venereal diseases. Although prostitutes found this regulated system oppressive, they developed ways to resist it. During the Fascist rule (1922–1943), more restrictive measures were gradually introduced in 1923, 1933, and 1940.\nOverall, the system was considered a failure, and as in other European countries with \"Réglementation\", movement for its abolition started to grow from the late 19th century, supported by leftist and feminist groups. This \"abolitionism\" of the time is often considered confusing, since it has been applied to both the abolition of regulations restricting prostitution and the abolition of prostitution itself. However, these forces led to the introduction of a new system in Italy that abolished regulation, but not prostitution as such.\n\nThe \"Legge Merlin\" (L75/1958)\n(the Merlin Law, named after its main author, the Socialist Party member of parliament Lina Merlin), came into power on 20 September 1958. This law, still in force today with very little changes, revoked the regulation system, banned brothels, and established a new criminal offence called \"exploitation of prostitution\" (\"sfruttamento della prostituzione\") with the aim to punish procuring of sexual services. Specifically, article 3.8 provides penalties for \"any person who in any way promotes or exploits the prostitution of others\" (\"chiunque in qualsiasi modo favorisca o sfrutti la prostituzione altrui\"). Article 3.3 lists a number of public places where prostitution is prohibited, such as houses, hotels, dance halls, and entertainment clubs. Article 5 prohibits solicitation (\"libertinaggio\") \"in a public place, or place open to the public, or soliciting in a scandolous or disturbing manner, or follows a person and invites them by acts or words\".\nArticle 7 prohibited registration and mandatory health checks for prostitutes.\n\nThe Merlin Law follows the standard abolitionist (abolishing regulation) view of prostitution control policy, prohibiting trafficking, exploitation, and aiding and abetting of prostitution. What remained legal was street prostitution, or independent prostitution done by a prostitute in their own home. The law was promoted as an equality measure liberating women, but despite its good intentions to give more rights to prostitutes otherwise dependent on pimps, it was and still remains to this day a subject of intense debate. Among other controversial points, the text of the law specifically refers to women (\"donne\").\n\nThe effect of the law was to push women out into the streets, which made them more visible, and into private homes.\nThe law remained a subject of intense debate, with its defence being seen as a feminist issue, though both Marxists and Catholics support it. The Christian Democrats repeatedly sought the repeal of the law since 1973, and they were joined in 1998 by the Democrats of the Left. Repeal of the law would have re-opened brothels. At the same time, conservative women's groups such as Federcasalinghe\npushed for more regulation, including as health checks, but these propositions were generally opposed by feminists. However, surveys consistently suggest that there is considerable public support for re-opening the \"case chiuse\".\n\nFollowing the founding of the \"Comitato\" (see Advocacy, below), attempts to change the law continued, with 22 bills introduced in the 1996-2001 legislative assembly.\n\nProstitution in Italy became much more visible in the early 1990s with the increase of migration from Eastern Europe and Western Africa which had begun in the 1970s. The dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Yugoslav Wars, and new immigration policies (such as \"Legge Martelli\" of 1990) contributed to a rapid influx of sex workers in 1989-1990 originating from former Soviet bloc countries, giving rise to the colloquial term \"Polish Girls\" (\"ragazze polacche\"). A second wave of immigrant sex workers from Nigeria and Peru, arriving to Italy using tourist visas and staying in the country after they had expired (the so-called \"clandestini\") ensued, followed by a third wave from Albania in 1993-1994. The fourth wave in 1995 also came from Nigeria and Albania, while in 1996-1998, even more migrants came from Moldova, Lithuania, and Albania. Italian immigration laws became much more restrictive in 1998, with the enactment of the \"Legge Turco-Napolitano\" (40/98).\n\nAmong these migrants were women who took up prostitution with varying degrees of voluntarity, with some suffering coercion and debt bondage (human trafficking), including under-aged girls. These issues of foreign nationals, coerced prostitution, and under-aged prostitutes have re-shaped the prostitution debate in Italy, as elsewhere around Europe, in recent years. Descriptions of the conditions of migrant women, particularly young women, on the streets, shifted the debate in the 1990s from the \"Comitato\"'s perception of prostitutes as independent and assertive women to that of victims of male violence. One response of the local authorities in dealing with the problem was rescinding residence permits issued to foreign women found in the streets, and increased deportations of the \"clandestini\".\n\nWith migration, street prostitution became more visible, the prostitutes being considered to now be mainly foreigners. In turn, this created another force driving public attitudes, which were community groups from urban neighbourhoods where street prostitution was most visible, particularly since the mid-1990s.\nMunicipalities have also tried to police sex work themselves since 1994, which included targeting sex work clients by sending notices to their home addresses and confiscating their vehicles, although outright charging clients with aiding and abetting was blocked by a tribunal in Perugia in September 2000. Continuing police activity became a national focus following the suicide of a client that year.\n\nAnother initiative was to create tolerance zones, such as in Mestre, the mainland of Venice, in 1995.\nA more tolerant approach has emerged from local authorities, based on the principle of \"harm reduction\" (\"riduzione del danno\").\n\nSome municipal authorities have created confusion by erecting signs drawing attention to prostitution occurring in the neighbourhood.\n\nOriginally proposed by international agencies, and approved by the European Union in 1996, the cause of protecting migrant prostitutes was taken up in Italy by Maria Paola Colombo Svevo (PPI), President of Irene, an NGO, and by other Catholic and lay NGOs such as Caritas.\n\nWhile it was always possible to request a residency permit on humanitarian grounds, this was not well known or utilized by foreign sex workers. In 1996, Livia Turco, the Minister of Social Affairs, introduced the first \"Justice Permit\" for trafficking victims who renounced their traffickers, as part of the Prime Minister Lamberto Dini's immigration decree. However, Catholic organizations opposed the denunciation clause. The political initiative to address the situation of women migrant workers came from Anna Finocchiaro (Democratic Party), the Minister of Equal Opportunities. Giorgio Napolitano (Democrats of the Left), the Interior Minister, announced new measures in 1997 to deal with prostitution as an issue of urban safety, and there was little debate over his proposals, given widespread concerns over human trafficking. The main opposing viewpoint was that residence permits should be granted only on the condition of victims denouncing traffickers.\nWhat debate there was, was essentially confined to the position of women. The resulting legislation was the \"Legge Turco-Napolitano\" of 1998 (40/98). The position of the relatively weak and scattered women's movement was that victims should not be further victimized by having them expelled to their home country, or by putting them in a possibly life-threatening situation.\n\nMeasures adopted by the law included increased penalties for recruiting and trafficking, and allowing victims of trafficking to stay in the country under a \"protection permit\". The law envisioned that these permits would be administered by local police chiefs (\"questori\") on humanitarian grounds, but this concerned NGOs because of the complexity of the procedures involved and the potential for abuse. The law also required the victim to enroll in training courses organized and by approved NGOs. The law also allocated funds for associations assisting these victims, but did require them to exit sex work, although they were supposed to denounce it. The requirement for denuciation in the original Dini decree was removed. In advocating this, Turco was influenced by the Commission for Equal Opportunities, whose first president, Elena Marinucci (PSI), had embraced the aims of the Comitato and attempted to legislate this in 1987.\n\nAmongst critics were the \"Comitato\" who objected to prostitution as something that women required to be protected from, without addressing stigmatization. However, Catholic organizations dominated the list of approved agencies, and followed this belief. However, the debates did distinguish between forced prostitution and a \"free and conscious choice of the individual\".\n\nAlthough the law was not explicitly targeted at sex work, its implementation was. Despite gender neutral language, the implementation focused on young female victims of trafficking, which was driven by populist media imagery. The new law did little to stem the debate. When the government led by Massimo D'Alema was elected later that year in October 1998 three women ministers from three political parties (Federation of the Greens, Italian People's Party, and Democrats of the Left) - Laura Balbo (Equal Opportunities), Rosa Russo Jervolino (Internal Affairs) and Livia Turco (Social Affairs) announced they would look at new proposals on battling trafficking and defending the dignity of women.\n\nThe result was a new prominence for Anna Finocchiaro's consultative body, the Inter-ministerial Table for the Fight against Trafficking (in February 1998) with wide representation. Finocchiaro had declared \"Trafficking in women is a new and very serious problem that we have to combat primarily with the punishment for reduction into slavery, instead of using the Merlin law\". In March 1999, the ministers announced new, more severe, penalties for exploitation, and new rules for protecting those who renounced prostitution. Available statistics for 1998 reported 342 known victims, 37 percent of whom were minors, predominantly originating from Albania, Nigeria and FR Yugoslavia. A total of 242 permits were granted in 1999 and 600 in 2000.\n\nUntil 2008, although there were no laws against street prostitution, other laws concerning public order and decency could be used to regulate it, and some places had local ordinances enacted against street prostitution. Attempts were regularly made to criminalize outdoor sex work.\n\nIn 2008, a new bill outlawing street prostitution was introduced by Mara Carfagna,\nMinister for Equal Opportunities,\nand approved by the Consiglio dei ministri on 11 September.\n\nThe bill is framed as an amendment to the Legge Merlin of 20 February 1958, No 75 by providing for penalties for the act of prostitution, solicitation, or availing oneself of sexual services in a place open to the public (Art. 1). Article 2 amends article 600 bis of the penal code to provide penalties for recruiting, inducing, promoting, using, managing, organizing, controlling, or profiting from the sexual services of a person under 18, or for those promising any kind reward for a sexual act with a person between 14 and 18. It also provides for repatriation of foreign minors engaging in prostitution. Article 3 deals with organized crime, penalizing conspiracy to exploit prostitution via article 416 of the penal code. Article 4 provides no new resources and repeals article 5 of the Legge Merlin, which it replaces, prohibiting \"libertinaggio\" (solicitation constituting offence or harassment) subject to up to 15 days imprisonment.\n\nThe bill (S.1079) was introduced into the Senate,\nwhere it has been debated in committee in conjunction with a group of related bills (19 March 2009).\nIn interviews with and , Carafagna stated that she was declaring war on prostitution\nand criticised opponents who proposed \"quartieri a luci rosse\" (red light districts).\nIt remains firmly on the agenda of the Berlusconi government, despite the sex work scandals that continue to be associated with him.\nThis has been achieved by packaging anti-prostitution measures into security packages, frustrated by the slow passage of the actual legislation. As with previous attempts this has attracted much criticism.\n\nThe bill is opposed by the Catholic Church, sex workers\nharm reduction advocates\nfeminist groups,\nhuman rights and immigrant groups,\nand lawyers\nand continues to be a matter of both popular and academic debate.\nCarfagna believes it is necessary to combat trafficking.\n\nThe Domestic Security regulations of 24 July 2008 (L.125/08) gave mayors judicial power to declare anything that might endanger the security and decorum of their cities an emergency. Under these powers, sex workers and clients have been subjected to ordinances that permit municipal police to administer fines. The Public Security Law enables police chiefs to expel persons from a city in which they do not officially reside. EU citizens are subject to fines while non-EU citizens may be placed in detention centres and deported. The Comitato reports a breakdown in relationships between NGOs and authorities and between NGOs and workers, an avoidance of health services and an increase in criminal activity. While enforcement varies by region and over time, the immediate effect has been the expected and desired one of clearing the streets (at least temporarily) and displacing workers to remote areas. Indoors work has increased, and quality of life in general has deteriorated. Unprotected sex has increased due to reduced ability to negotiate. Stigmatization and vulnerability have increased, as has a greater reliance on social services. As noted in other countries, as soon as police activity is reduced, older work patterns reappear.\nOn April 7, 2011, the Italian Constitutional Court with the Sentence n. 115/2011 decided that this kind of Mayors' Ordinances must have time and space limits and urgent conditions to be issued. So, the simple exercise of street prostitution could be no more persecuted by this kind of local bills.\n\nProstitution is legal (it is not mentioned in the Penal Code as such), brothels and pimping are illegal. Single sex workers working from apartments are \"tolerated\". Loitering is permitted, but soliciting (\"unabashedly inviting clients on the street\") is illegal. Migrants with work or residence permits may work in sex work, and police cannot revoke residence permits and begin deportation procedures, as they tried failing by the Italian laws.\n\nWork permits can be issued to migrant dancers in entertainment clubs for one year in a single workplace. Sex work is forbidden, but nude dancing is tolerated. Suspicions of sexual encounters lead to club closures.\nBy a fiscal law in 2006 (art. 36 paragraph 34 bis of Law 248/2006), prostitution has got taxed on the same way for every legal money earned, as the Highest Court has declared many times. The last one of these Judgments has carried out in 2016 (n. 22413/2016) and sex workers must have their activity registered, paying taxes as all free professionists.\n\nA 2010 court decision created a new precedent, that clients who did not pay the worker would be considered guilty of rape.\nThis was considered a major breakthrough for prostitutes' rights.\n\nThe three main debates which have occupied the public, media, and policy makers are\n\nAccording to a TAMPEP report on the legislations and policies regarding prostitution in Europe, in Italy, the dominant frames are sex work as violence, force, organized crime, a threat to public security and order, and driving demand for migration and trafficking.\n\nAmongst the political actors were the \"Centri antiviolenza\" (Anti-violence centres), and women's shelters who advocated for victims of trafficking to stay in the country even if they did not denounce their exploiters, in keeping with their vision that women are best empowered by allowing them to determine their own course of action.\n\nThe women's movement has been divided between those who saw prostitution as exploitation and those who saw it as work. In general,\nthe movement has not prioritized prostitution, giving it mid-level importance, and saw it as a cultural issue, and did not trust the State as an intervenor. On this issue, Catholic organizations have been part of a hostile backlash to feminism, as is the fascist right. For example, the mayor of Bologna cut all funding to women's shelters.\n\nThe women's movement denounced prostitution.\n\nThe policy of fining clients of street prostitutes, which has started to be implemented in the early 1990s, by city mayors, has been approved by part of the feminist movement (blaming clients for the existence of prostitution is a common discourse among both feminists and Catholics), but opposed by other women who felt this policy further victimized the women.\n\nAmongst the ongoing debates surrounding prostitution in Italy are the legal scholars who advocate \"diritto leggero\", the concept that the State should intervene only minimally in matters considered the free choice of the individual. There was a trend towards supporting normalization. A prominent advocate for this position has been Roberta Tatafiore, chief editor of \"Noidonne\" (\"Us Women\").\n\nIn regard to legal issues, feminists in general have supported the Merlin law, which banned brothels and regulation; and stood for decriminalization, with the exception of exploitation by third parties (pimps).\n\nIn the centre-left government of Prodi, the policy system was reasonably open, and the dominant approach matched that of the women's movement, in moving ahead with \"protection\".\n\nThe shift in emphasis from workers to clients in 1994, when mayors ordered police to fine clients, was welcomed by Catholics and feminists. In Bologna in 1998, the \"Case delle donne per non-subire violenze\", the \"Comitato\", and MIT, a trans-sexual organization, left the city's co-ordinating committee on prostitution in protest, believing that any repression worsened workers' working conditions. There was also a feeling that criminalizing clients prevented them reporting abuse of workers or collaborating with authorities.\n\nThe issue was raised again in 1999 by Jervolino, proposing amending the Merlin Law to stiffen penalties for exploitation. Giuliano Amato, Minister of Institutional Reforms, suggested that instead the client should be penalized, and Antonio Di Pietro (Lista Di Pietro) introduced a bill into the Senate, but raised the ire of politicians, in particular Livia Turco, who emphasised that prostitution should be decriminalized, and only \"true abuse\" be penalized. She and Laura Balbo also received representation from the \"Comitato\" against this. This debate occurred during meetings of a parliamentary commission into prostitution, where there were frequent references to under-age foreign prostitutes.\n\nPartly connected to this was the emergence of a need to criminalize clients using under-age workers. Engaging in sexual activity with someone under 14 was already classified as statutory rape, but that still left many under-age workers. While the age of consent is 14, paying to engage in sexual activities with teenagers between 14 and 17 years old, regardless of consent, is a crime punished with imprisonment from one to six years. Publicity around underage workers has been a persistent concern in Italy as elsewhere, although in Italy it often appeared framed as homosexual molestation of male minors.\n\nIn 1996, two female politicians, Anna Serafini and Daria Bonfietti (DS), introduced legislation to penalize the use of under-age workers, responding to a series of international forces, including Programme of Action Against Sexual Exploitation of Children for Commercial Purposes (Stockholm 1996), UNESCO, and ECPAT. They received the support of Rosa Russo Jervolino, Minister of Internal Affairs. This initiative unified a number of legislative proposals.\n\nThe media reported abuse and murders (particularly an 8-year-old boy in Ostia in 1998,)\ninternet child pornography and sex tourism, with the terminology shifting from 'teenager' to 'child', and frequently conflated 'women and children' as equally vulnerable. Parliament responded rapidly and the Penal Code was amended\nto deal with sexual contact with minors or possession of child pornography with no opposition.\n\nThere was, however, division over the issue of the defence of ignorance, the final decision being it was not a defence. One feminist MP, Ersilia Salvato (RC), complained about the rushed legislation, and abstained. Because Italian law prohibits gender discrimination (another legacy of Lina Merlin), the language was neutral, although not the effect. It was, however, considered impossible to enforce, since it would require the worker to lay the complaint. The issue was never on the agenda of the women's movement, not even by the shelters, and who played no part in the debate, nor did the Equal Opportunities Minister (Anna Finocchiaro). Nor was the policy environment receptive to feminist input, since the Government was anxious to be seen to be responding to media and moral panic on pedophilia.\n\nIn 1998, the Chamber of Deputies ordered an \"Inquiry to increase knowledge about the social and sanitary aspects of prostitution\" in response to concerns about foreign workers on the streets. Anna Finocchiaro, the Minister of Equal Opportunities, was a key player in this, as was the Justice Commission President Marida Bolognesi (DS). The Inquiry interviewed many stakeholders during six hearings, but there was relatively little representation from the women's movement. The main framework was the idea that foreigners were \"invading\" the streets of Italy, as a public order issue. This was a heavily gendered debate. In the end, the commission adopted three principles – harm reduction, education of clients, and the importance of upholding the Merlin law. The deliberations included proposing a law to finance local government programmes to assist sex workers with protection permits. At the same time, the three women ministers were promoting education campaigns in the countries of origin of migrant sex workers (e. g., Nigeria, Eastern Europe), while other programmes assisted police in their responsibilities regarding permits were initiated, and help lines set up, while 8 million euros were allocated to NGOs to carry out their responsibilities under article 18 of the Turco-Napolitano Act.\n\nThere was little feminist input into this discussion, with the exception of Elsa Antonioni of the Anti-violence shelter, who stressed the continuity between sex for money and sex for free, pointing to the vulnerability of sex workers' civil rights (e. g., their children could be taken into care). This was not pursued, although the strong role of the Equal Opportunities Ministry can be seen as an insider women's voice.\n\nAn influential group of sex workers is the \"Comitato\" – Committee for the Civil Rights of Prostitutes (Comitato per i Diritti Civili delle Prostitute, or CDCP), formed in 1983 in response to violent attacks on sex workers and run by Carla Corso and Pia Covre from their national offices in Pordenone.\nTheir campaigns include trafficking prevention, sex worker rights, and campaigning for decriminalization and an end to stigmatization. Their demands saw a number of bills introduced in parliament, which, despite support from three leftist parties, were unsuccessful. However, attempts to change the law continue in parliament. The Comitato has been one of the major women's voices in sex work debates in Italy, at least in comparison with the women's movement overall, and worked closely with the women's shelters. Their position of minimum interference was shared with both the women's movement and the policy agencies. This has only been partially successful. A frequent target has been the provisions of the Merlin Law that punish those involved, of which Livia Turco was a prominent political voice. Positioned against this cause has been the law-and-order agenda of both centre-left and centre-right coalitions.\n\nAccurate estimates of the numbers of workers in any particular country are hard to obtain, and prone to error and bias.\n\nA 2008 report stated that were some 100,000 prostitutes in Italy.\nIn 2007 it was stated that the total number of workers was 70,000.\nThe Italian Statistics Institute stated the number of street workers in 1998 was 50,000.\n\nA 2009 report from TAMPEP estimated that the percentage of foreign sex workers in Italy had reached 90%, an increase from previous years.\nIn that report only Spain was found to have such a high percentage of migrants in the trade, although most Western European countries reported a majority of workers were migrants. This was in contrast with the former Communist countries, where the reverse is true – most workers being of national origin.\n\nClaims about trafficking vary widely and are difficult to verify. Estimates vary from 7%\nto 100%\nof migrant workers. The 2009 US State Department report on Human Rights states \"In 2008, according to the Ministry of Interior, 4,350 persons were charged with trafficking in persons and pandering.\"\n\nClampdowns by authorities often result in displacement of the trade across borders, such as that with Austria and Switzerland where brothels are legal.\n\nIn 2008, it was estimated that 65% of workers are on the streets and 35% in private residences or clubs. 20% were stated to be minors and 10% to have been forced into prostitution by criminal gangs.\nHowever lines between street and indoor work are often blurred, for instance by street workers using vans.\n\nA 1997/1998 study of 142 street prostitutes from Rome (102 women, 40 transsexual women) showed that most respondents (95%) reported always using condoms with clients. 8% of the women and 2% of the transsexual women reported injectable drug use. 38% of the women with a stable partner used contraceptives, while 33% of them had had a voluntary abortion in the previous year. 38% of the women and 80% of the transsexual women had had checks for STDs in the last year. HIV-prevalence was 6% among women, and 20% amongst transsexual women. 4/6 positive women and 1/8 of the positive transsexual women used injectable drugs. 5/6 HIV-positive women were Italian.\n\nHowever, of 558 workers attending a STD clinic in Bologna between 1995 and 1999, only 1.6% tested positive for HIV. The authors concluded that \"prostitutes do not have a prominent role in the transmission and diffusion of STDs\"\nDespite this opponents of prostitution continue to claim they are sources of disease.\n\n\n\nIndagine conoscitiva sugli aspetti sociali e sanitari della prostituzione, Camera dei deputati, Commissione XII (affari sociali) 1999, pp. VIII-160, Euro 6,71 (IC13022)\n\n"}
{"id": "1671672", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1671672", "title": "Retrospective", "text": "Retrospective\n\nA retrospective (from Latin \"retrospectare\", \"look back\"), generally, is a look back at events that took place, or works that were produced, in the past. As a noun, \"retrospective\" has specific meanings in medicine, software development, popular culture and the arts. It is applied as an adjective, synonymous with the term \"retroactive\", to laws, standards, and awards.\n\nA medical retrospective is an examination of a patient's medical history and lifestyle.\n\nA retrospective exhibition presents works from an extended period of an artist's activity. Similarly, a retrospective compilation album is assembled from a recording artist's past material, usually their greatest hits. A television or newsstand special about an actor, politician, or other celebrity will present a retrospective of the subject's career highlights. A leading (usually elderly) academic may be honored with a Festschrift, an honorary book of articles or a lecture series relating topically to a retrospective of the honoree's career. Celebrity roasts good-naturedly mock the career of the guest of honor, often in a retrospective format.\n\nA retrospective or retroactive award is one which is created and then awarded to persons who would have received it before. Alternatively, a slight change to the criteria of an existing award may result in retrospective awards being presented to persons who would have won the award under present rules. Comparatively few awards are presented retrospectively.\n\nThe term is used in situations where the law (statutory, civil, or regulatory) is changed or reinterpreted, affecting acts committed before the alteration. When such changes make a previously committed lawful act now unlawful in a retroactive manner, this is known as an \"ex post facto\" law or retroactive law. Because such laws punish the accused for acts that were not unlawful when committed, they are rare, and not permissible in most legal systems. More commonly, changes retroactively worsen the legal consequences (or status) of actions that were committed, or relationships that existed, by bringing it into a more severe category than it was in when it was committed; by changing the punishment or recompense prescribed, as by adding new penalties, extending sentences, or increasing fines and damages payable; or it may alter the rules of evidence in order to make exoneration more difficult than it would have been.\n\nConversely, a form of retrospective law commonly called an amnesty law may decriminalize certain acts. A pardon has a similar effect, in a specific case instead of a class of cases. An \"in mitius\" change may alleviate possible consequences for unlawful acts (for example by replacing the death sentence with lifelong imprisonment) retroactively. Finally, when a previous law is repealed or otherwise nullified, it is no longer applicable to situations to which it had been, even if such situations arose before the law was voided; this principle is known as \"nullum crimen, nulla poena sine praevia lege poenali\".\n\nThe term is also used in software engineering, where a retrospective is a meeting held by a project team at the end of a project or process (often after an iteration) to discuss what was successful about the project or time period covered by that retrospective, what could be improved, and how to incorporate the successes and improvements in future iterations or projects. Retrospective can be done in many different ways.\n\nIn agile development, retrospectives play a very important role in iterative and incremental development. At the end of every iteration a retrospective is held to look for ways to improve the process for the next iteration. Scrum call this the Sprint Retrospective.\n\nIn the context of scientific and technical standards, retrospectivity applies current norms to material that pre-dates new rules. An example of a retrospective or retroactive standard is the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN Code), a convention which governs the formal scientific naming of animals, of which the 4th edition is effective since 2000. All previous editions of the ICZN Code, or previous other rules and conventions are disregarded today, and the scientific names published in former times are to be evaluated only under the present edition of the ICZN Code.\n\n"}

{"id": "38243", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38243", "title": "Suspension of disbelief", "text": "Suspension of disbelief\n\nThe term suspension of disbelief or willing suspension of disbelief has been defined as a willingness to suspend one's critical faculties and believe something surreal; sacrifice of realism and logic for the sake of enjoyment. The term was coined in 1817 by the poet and aesthetic philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who suggested that if a writer could infuse a \"human interest and a semblance of truth\" into a fantastic tale, the reader would suspend judgement concerning the implausibility of the narrative. Suspension of disbelief often applies to fictional works of the action, comedy, fantasy, and horror genres. Cognitive estrangement in fiction involves using a person's ignorance to promote suspension of disbelief.\n\nThe phrase \"suspension of disbelief\" came to be used more loosely in the later 20th century, often used to imply that the burden was on the reader, rather than the writer, to achieve it. This might be used to refer to the willingness of the audience to overlook the limitations of a medium, so that these do not interfere with the acceptance of those premises. These premises may also lend to the engagement of the mind and perhaps proposition of thoughts, ideas, art and theories.\n\nSuspension of disbelief is often an essential element for a magic act or a circus sideshow act. For example, an audience is not expected to actually believe that a woman is cut in half or transforms into a gorilla in order to enjoy the performance.\n\nAccording to the theory, suspension of disbelief is an essential ingredient for any kind of storytelling. With any film, the viewer has to ignore the reality that they are viewing a staged performance and temporarily accept it as their reality in order to be entertained. Black-and-white films provide an obvious early example that audiences are willing to suspend disbelief, no matter how implausible the images appear, for the sake of entertainment. With the exception of totally color blind people (achromats), no person viewing these films sees the real world without color, but some are still willing to suspend disbelief and accept the images in order to be entertained. Suspension of disbelief is also supposed to be essential for the enjoyment of many films and television shows involving complex stunts, special effects, and seemingly unrealistic plots and characterizations.\n\nColeridge coined the phrase in his \"Biographia Literaria\", published in 1817, in the context of the creation and reading of poetry. Chapter XIV describes the preparations with Wordsworth for their revolutionary collaboration \"Lyrical Ballads\" (first edition 1798), for which Coleridge had contributed the more romantic, gothic pieces including \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\". Poetry and fiction involving the supernatural had gone out of fashion to a large extent in the 18th century, in part due to the declining belief in witches and other supernatural agents among the educated classes, who embraced the rational approach to the world offered by the new science. Alexander Pope, notably, felt the need to explain and justify his use of elemental spirits in \"The Rape of the Lock\", one of the few English poems of the century that invoked the supernatural. Coleridge wished to revive the use of fantastic elements in poetry. The concept of \"willing suspension of disbelief\" explained how a modern, enlightened audience might continue to enjoy such types of story.\n\nColeridge recalled:\n\nThe notion of such an action by an audience was however recognized in antiquity, as seen particularly in the Roman theoretical concerns of Horace, who also lived in an age of increasing skepticism about the supernatural, in his \"Ars Poetica\" (with the quotation \"Ut pictura poesis\").\n\nSuspension of disbelief is sometimes said to be an essential component of live theater, where it was recognized by Shakespeare, who refers to it in the Prologue to \"Henry V\":\n\nPsychological critic Norman Holland points to a neuroscientific explanation. When we hear or watch any narrative, our brains go wholly into perceiving mode, turning off the systems for acting or planning to act, and with them go our systems for assessing reality. We have, in Coleridge's second, more accurate phrase, \"poetic faith\". That's why humans have such trouble recognizing lies: they first believe, then have to make a conscious effort to disbelieve.\n\nOnly when we stop perceiving to think about what we have seen or heard, only then do we assess its truth-value. If we are really \"into\" the fiction – \"transported\", in the psychologists' term – we are, as Immanuel Kant pointed out long ago, \"disinterested\". We respond aesthetically, without purpose. We don't judge the truth of what we're perceiving, even though if we stop being transported and think about it, we know quite well it's a fiction.\n\nSuspension of disbelief has also been used within a mental health context by Frank DeFulgentis in his book \"Flux\". It is an attempt to describe the phenomenon of forgetting irrational thoughts associated with cases of OCD. In the book, the author suggests 'suspending disbelief' as opposed to forcing ourselves to forget; similar to how one would put a virus in quarantine. We can thereby allow ourselves to be absorbed in the activities around us until these irrationalities vanish on their own accord.\n\nAesthetic philosophers generally reject claims that suspension of disbelief accurately characterizes the relationship between people and \"fictions.\" Kendall Walton notes that, if viewers were to truly suspend disbelief at a horror movie and accept its images as absolute fact, they would have a true-to-life set of reactions. For instance, audience members would cry out, \"Look behind you!\" to an endangered on-screen character or call the police when they witnessed an on-screen murder.\n\nHowever, many of these criticisms simply fail to notice that Coleridge's original statement came in a restrictive clause. The formulation \"...that willing suspension of disbelief for the moment which constitutes poetic faith,\" of necessity implies that there are different sorts of suspension of disbelief and specifies that poetic faith is one instance of a larger class. One need not choose to believe that a character in a horror film is a real person in order, for example, to choose to believe that the character is looking at the building seen in the following reverse-shot.\n\nNot all authors believe that suspension of the disbelief adequately characterizes the audience's relationship to imaginative works of art. J. R. R. Tolkien challenges this concept in his essay \"On Fairy-Stories\", choosing instead the paradigm of secondary belief based on inner consistency of reality. Tolkien says that, in order for the narrative to work, the reader must believe that what he reads is true within the secondary reality of the fictional world. By focusing on creating an internally consistent fictional world, the author makes secondary belief possible. Tolkien argues that suspension of disbelief is only necessary when the work has failed to create secondary belief. From that point the spell is broken, and the reader ceases to be immersed in the story and must make a conscious effort to suspend disbelief or else give up on it entirely.\n\n\n"}

It is a prequel to \"The Mysterious Benedict Society\", taking place during the troubled childhood of Nicholas Benedict, a nine-year-old orphan and genius, and his friend, John Cole.\n\nNicholas Benedict, a nine-year-old orphan and genius, moves to the Rothschild Manor orphanage after being removed from his previous orphanage, Littleview, because of his narcolepsy, a condition that sends him into deep sleep at unexpected moments, and, in Nicholas' case, often whilst he is laughing or experiences strong emotion. Because of his condition, he is forced to sleep in a room all by himself that is locked each night by the director, Mr. Collum, instead of in the dormitory with all the other boys. The room had a window that was blocked up to prevent Nicholas from sneaking about through it. Nicholas, however, is able to remove the mortar as it had not dried properly.

{"id": "13575607", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13575607", "title": "Timothy of the Cay", "text": "Timothy of the Cay\n\nTimothy of the Cay is a book written by Theodore Taylor. It is a prequel for Timothy and a sequel for Phillip to \"The Cay.\"\n\nThe book discusses Timothy's life before the events of \"The Cay,\" when he was living in \"Back O' All,\" the poorest section of what was then the squatter's village of Charlotte Amalie, on the then Danish-held United States Virgin Island of St. Thomas (of which Virgin Island it is now the capital), and Phillip Enright's life after the same events. The theme to this story is making dreams a reality.\n\nAccording to \"Timothy of the Cay,\" Timothy had been abandoned as a baby at the residence in Back O' All where Hannah Gumbs, a former coal carrier turned washer-woman who reared him, was a squatter. As a boy, he formed a dream of one day being captain of his own schooner, which he meant to name after the woman he called \"Tante Hannah.\" Even though she was not Timothy's biological aunt, Timothy still referred to her as this. When he tried to become a cabin boy on one ship, its captain took on a \"bukra\" boy instead because he was a negro. A \"bukra\" was a white boy in the richer part of St. Thomas. When he finally got a job on another ship, the \"Gertrude Theismann,\" he believed he was only fourteen, but he claimed an age of sixteen. He later claimed to be sixty, younger than the more than seventy years of age he guesstimated he actually was, so he could become part of the crew on the \"Hato.\"\n\nHannah Gumbs died during the second of Timothy's first four years at sea. Timothy came back home with clothes for her only to find that she was dead. Timothy worked long enough and hard enough, both at sea and on land, to be able to afford a schooner originally named the \"Tessie Crabb\" by what he guesstimated were his forties. Holding a master's license in the name of \"Timothy Gumbs\" (he would think of himself simply as Timothy, without a family name, for his entire life) by this time, he renamed this schooner the \"Hannah Gumbs,\" as he had always intended. Making his living as its \"captain,\" Timothy gleaned an extensive enough knowledge of the sea to be able, in his last months, to help Phillip Enright survive on a cay in \"La Boca del Diablo,\" \"the Devil's Mouth.\"\n\nThe story describes how, after the captain of the \"Hettie Redd\" died, Timothy was asked to bring his body back for burial as temporary captain of the \"Hettie Redd.\" He did so reluctantly, suspecting that a violent storm, or \"tempis',\" might strike. And one did, sinking the \"Hettie Redd\" with all hands let alone him and drowning all its passengers in spite of all he did to ensure their survivals. Though he was absolved in the inquiry, Timothy carried the guilt for the rest of his days and often wished that he too had drowned in the storm.\n\nAt over seventy years of age, and two years after he had sold the \"Hannah Gumbs\" and retired from the sea, Timothy signed aboard the S.S. \"Hato,\" the Dutch-registered freighter that, according to \"The Cay,\" was sunk on April 9, 1942, as an able-bodied seaman, in response to a call for volunteers that had been placed early in 1942. The cause was that of a German U-boat that had torpedoed the S.S. \"Hato.\" When it picked up Phillip Enright and his mother in Curaçao, of what were then the Netherlands Antilles, they were fleeing to their native Virginia. Instead the \"Hato\" was torpedoed; as it sank, Phillip was struck on the back of the head by a piece of loose timber just as he was being thrown aboard a raft, which blinded him two days later. Most of the events in \"The Cay\" follow the sinking of the \"Hato.\" Timothy later taught Phillip Enright to survive on his own. Approximately three months after the \"Hato's\" shipwreck, give or take a few days, another \"tempis'\" struck in July. Timothy let Phillip live by shielding him from the storm with his back. The wind and the flying debris from the storm eventually beat and killed Timothy. Before his death, he had provided Phillip with enough preparation to survive alone, which Phillip did for almost two months after Timothy's death.\n\nAfter his rescue from the Cay in \"La Boca del Diablo,\" Phillip was reunited with his parents. (His mother had likewise survived the sinking of the \"Hato.\") His mother, Grace Enright, continued to think of him as a child of age 10 for a long while, even after he was told that an operation could be performed that might restore his vision, but her husband, Peter, endorsed their son's decision to have that surgery. Phillip had come, since Timothy's life, to consider Timothy a guardian angel with whom he could sometimes speak, but his mother thought this idea was foolish.\n\nThey flew to New York, where the surgeon from New York Presbyterian who could perform the operation was based. The operation was a success, restoring most of Phillip's vision, though he would always need eyeglasses from that day forward. He and his father made plans to visit the cay where he and Timothy had survived for just over three months, until Timothy had been killed in a hurricane that had struck the cay when flying debris had severely lacerated him; he had given his life to protect Phillip's, using his body to shield Phillip from the debris. Philip had survived alone for almost two months afterwards, thanks to Timothy's having prepared him for just that.\n\nThis book was named \"one of the greatest books for children\" by Students Across America (SAA) in 2011. They said of it: \"This novel is about the life of Timothy and Philip after their ordeal on the cay. In order to make sense of this story you must first read \"The Cay\".\"\n"}
