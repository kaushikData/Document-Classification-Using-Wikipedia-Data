M. in the Subway is a one shot, 53 second-long comedy filmed, and probably directed, by Billy Bitzer on 5 June 1905 at the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company's (AM&B) studio on 14th Street (Manhattan) in New York City. Likely intended as a slightly racy, and therefore rather typical, subject for AM&B's peepshow machine, The Mutoscope, \"2 A. M. in the Subway\" is a vignette of New York City's night life that still resonates with New Yorkers more than a century later.\n\nA tired cop and a subway conductor are seen waiting at a subway platform, late at night. The conductor opens the doors to the train at left, and out steps an obviously drunk man carried between two women in fancy dress. The cop begins to mix it up with the three of them, and they are interrupted by another man in a bowler hat; he is carrying a large package and steps onto the train to the right after greeting the two women and the drunk man. One of the women steps forward into the frame and lifts up her skirt so that the drunk man can tie her shoe. This gets the attention of the cop, who hustles the three of them onto the train; meanwhile what appears to be a pair of bare legs stick out from a window of a train car and are quickly withdrawn. The cop just manages to notice this, and calls all parties back out to the platform where it is revealed that the man in the bowler hat has a pair of department store mannequin's legs with him.\n\nOn May 21, 1905, Billy Bitzer had made his film \"Interior N.Y. subway, 14th St. to 42nd St.\" from the front of a New York City Subway car; at that point the Subway itself had been open only seven months. The very day that subject was submitted for copyright, this one was made at the Biograph studio; it was copyrighted on 20 June. Although the six actors involved are unidentified, the action is obviously tightly coordinated in order to get all of the action into such a short subject.\nAM&B sent two paper prints of this film for copyright, and the better of the two copies was rephotographed for preservation.\n"}

In November 2008, the company acquired Santiago-based Wanako Games from Activision Blizzard, which was the first and largest South American game studio.

In the story, a group of children rehearses a Christmas song in July, to which a character responds: \"When you sing Christmas in July, you rush the season.\" It is a translation of the French: \"vous chantez Noël en juillet... c'est s'y prendre à l'avance.\" This opera is based on Goethe's \"The Sorrows of Young Werther\". Christmas features in the book, but July does not.\n\nIn 1935, the National Recreation Association's journal \"Recreation\" described what a Christmas in July was like at a girl's camp, writing that \"all mystery and wonder surround this annual event.\"\n\nThe term, if not the exact concept, was given national attention with the release of the Hollywood movie comedy \"Christmas in July\" in 1940, written and directed by Preston Sturges. In the story, a man is fooled into believing he has won $25,000 in an advertising slogan contest. He buys presents for family, friends, and neighbors, and proposes marriage to his girlfriend.\n\nIn 1942, the Calvary Baptist Church in Washington, D.C. celebrated Christmas in July with carols and the sermon \"Christmas Presents in July\". They repeated it in 1943, with a Christmas tree covered with donations. The pastor explained that the special service was patterned after a program held each summer at his former church in Philadelphia, when the congregation would present Christmas gifts early to give ample time for their distribution to missions worldwide. It became an annual event, and in 1945, the service began to be broadcast over local radio.\n\nThe U.S. Post Office and U.S. Army and Navy officials, in conjunction with the American advertising and greeting card industries, threw a Christmas in July luncheon in New York in 1944 to promote an early Christmas mailing campaign for service men overseas during World War II. The luncheon was repeated in 1945.\n\nAmerican advertisers began using Christmas in July themes in print for summertime sales as early as 1950. In the United States, it is more often used as a marketing tool than an actual holiday. Television stations may choose to re-run Christmas specials, and many stores have Christmas in July sales. Some individuals choose to celebrate Christmas in July themselves, typically as an intentionally transparent excuse to have a party. This is in part because most bargainers tend to sell Christmas goods around July to make room for next year's inventory.\n\nIn the Southern Hemisphere, seasons are in reverse to the Northern Hemisphere, with summer falling in December, January, and February, and with winter falling in June, July, and August. Therefore, in some southern hemisphere countries, such as Comoros, Madagascar, Bolivia, Angola, French Polynesia, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Samoa, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, Christmas in July or Midwinter Christmas events are undertaken in order to have Christmas with a winter feel in common with the northern hemisphere. These countries still celebrate Christmas on December 25, in their summer, like the northern hemisphere.\n\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, a Christmas in July celebration is deliberately ironic; the July climate is typically hot and either sunny or rainy, as opposed to the cold and snowy conditions traditionally associated with Christmas celebrations in the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. Some people throw parties during July that mimic Christmas celebrations, bringing the atmosphere of Christmas but with warmer temperatures. Parties may include Santa Claus, ice cream and other cold foods, and gifts. Nightclubs often host parties open to the public. Christmas in July is usually recognized as July 12 but also sometimes celebrated on July 25.\n\nThe Hallmark Channel and its companion outlets (Hallmark Drama and Hallmark Movies & Mysteries) run blocks of their original Christmas television films in July to coincide with the release of the Keepsake Ornaments in stores, thus literally making the event a Hallmark holiday (an accusation that Hallmark Cards officially denies).\n\nEvery July, the television home shopping channel QVC has Christmas in July sales, mostly decor and early gift ideas for children. What was once a 24-hour block of holiday shopping every July 25 (or the closest weekend day to it) has become a month-long event: generally, the sales begin on July 1 and are showcased throughout the day, with various blocks of holiday sale programming sales throughout the month. Generally during the last week of July, QVC will dedicate entire days to holiday sales.\n\nThere is also Christmas in June. In some western countries, July has a limited number of marketing opportunities. In the United States and Canada, for example, there are no national holidays between the first week of July (Canada Day on July 1 in Canada and American Independence Day on July 4 in the United States) and Labor/Labour Day (the first Monday in September for both the US and Canada), leaving a stretch of about two months with no holidays (some Canadian provinces hold a Civic Holiday, but neither Canada nor the United States has ever recognized a national holiday during that month). The late July period provides relatively few opportunities for merchandising, since it is typically after the peak of summer product sales in June and early July, but before the \"back to school\" shopping period begins in August. Therefore, to justify sales promotions, shops (such as Leon's in Canada) will sometimes announce a \"Christmas in July\" sale.\n\nIn parts of Denmark people may have small Christmas celebrations and put up decorations for what is known as 'Jul i Juli' (translated as 'Christmas in July'). It is a simple play on words that has come to be celebrated by some, although it is not an official holiday.\n\nIn the 1950s, the Christmas in July celebration became a Christmas in August celebration at Yellowstone National Park, to accommodate ACMNP's annual performance of Handel's \"Messiah\".\n"}
{"id": "37168138", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37168138", "title": "Circe in the arts", "text": "Circe in the arts\n\nThe sorceress Circe is a figure from Greek mythology whose father was the sun (Helios) and whose mother was an ocean nymph. She appears in three separate stories. The best known is when Odysseus visits her island of Aeaea on the way back from the Trojan War and she changes most of his crew into swine. He forces her to return them to human shape, lives with her for a year and has a child called Telegonus by her. Her ability to change others into animals is further highlighted by the story of Picus, an Italian king whom she turns into a woodpecker for resisting her advances. Another story makes her fall in love with the sea-god Glaucus, who prefers the nymph Scylla to her. In revenge, Circe poisoned the water where her rival bathed and turned her into a monster.\n\nIn the eyes of those from a later age, this behaviour made her notorious both as a magician and as a type of the sexually free woman. As such she has been frequently depicted in all the arts from the Renaissance down to modern times. Among women she has been portrayed more sympathetically.\n\nOne of the most enduring literary themes connected with the figure of Circe was her ability to change men into animals. There was much speculation concerning how this could be, whether the human consciousness changed at the same time, and even whether it was a change for the better. In the 1st century, Plutarch took up the theme in a lively dialogue that was later to have several imitators. Contained in his \"Moralia\" is the Gryllus episode in which Circe allows Odysseus to interview a fellow Greek turned into a pig. There his interlocutor informs Odysseus that his present existence is preferable to the human. They then engage in a philosophical dialogue in which every human value is questioned and beasts are proved to be of superior wisdom and virtue.\n\nThe Gryllus dialogue was taken up by another Italian writer, Giovan Battista Gelli, in his \"La Circe\" (1549). This is a series of ten philosophical and moral dialogues between Ulysses and the humans transformed into various animals, ranging from an oyster to an elephant, in which Circe sometimes joins. Most argue against changing back; only the last animal, a philosopher in its former existence, wants to. The English poet Edmund Spenser also makes reference to Plutarch's dialogue in the section of his \"Faerie Queene\" (1590) based on the Circe episode which appears at the end of Book II. Sir Guyon changes back the victims of Acrasia's erotic frenzy in the Bower of Bliss, most of whom are abashed at their fall from chivalric grace,\n\nTwo other Italians wrote rather different works that centre on the animal within the human. One was Niccolò Machiavelli in his unfinished long poem, \"L'asino d'oro\" (The golden ass, 1516). The author meets a beautiful herdswoman surrounded by Circe's herd of beasts. After spending a night of love with him, she explains the characteristics of the animals in her charge: the lions are the brave, the bears are the violent, the wolves are those forever dissatisfied, and so on (Canto 6). In Canto 7 he is introduced to those who experience frustration: a cat that has allowed its prey to escape; an agitated dragon; a fox constantly on the look-out for traps; a dog that bays the moon; Aesop's lion in love that allowed himself to be deprived of his teeth and claws. There are also emblematic satirical portraits of various Florentine personalities. In the eighth and last canto he has a conversation with a pig that, like the Gryllus of Plutarch, does not want to be changed back and condemns human greed, cruelty and conceit.\n\nThe other Italian author was the esoteric philosopher Giordano Bruno, who wrote in Latin. His \"Cantus Circaeus\" (The Incantation of Circe) was the fourth work on memory and the association of ideas by him to be published in 1582. It contains a series of poetic dialogues, in the first of which, after a long series of incantations to the seven planets of the Hermetic tradition, most humans appear changed into different creatures in the scrying bowl. The sorceress Circe is then asked by her handmaiden Moeris about the type of behaviour with which each is associated. According to Circe, for instance, fireflies 'are the learned, wise, and illustrious amidst idiots, asses, and obscure men' (Question 32). In later sections different characters discuss the use of images in the imagination in order to facilitate use of the art of memory, which is the real aim of the work.\n\nFrench writers were to take their lead from Gelli in the following century. Antoine Jacob wrote a one-act social comedy in rhyme, \"Les Bestes raisonnables\" (The Reasoning Beasts, 1661) which allowed him to satirise contemporary manners. On the isle of Circe, Ulysses encounters an ass that was once a doctor, a lion that had been a valet, a female doe and a horse, all of whom denounce the decadence of the times. The ass sees human asses everywhere,\n\nTo drive the point home, in the end it is only the horse, formerly a courtesan, who wants to return to her former state.\n\nThe same theme occupies La Fontaine's late fable, \"The Companions of Ulysses\" (XII.1, 1690), that also echoes Plutarch and Gelli. Once transformed, every animal (which include a lion, a bear, a wolf and a mole) protest that their lot is better and refuse to be restored to human shape. Charles Dennis shifted this fable to stand at the head of his translation of La Fontaine, \"Select Fables\" (1754), but provides his own conclusion that\n\nLouis Fuzelier and Marc-Antoine Legrand titled their comic opera of 1718 \"Les animaux raisonnables\". It had more or less the same scenario transposed into another medium and set to music by Jacques Aubert. Circe, wishing to be rid of the company of Ulysses, agrees to change back his companions, but only the dolphin is willing. The others, who were formerly a corrupt judge (now a wolf), a financier (a pig), an abused wife (a hen), a deceived husband (a bull) and a flibbertigibbet (a linnet), find their present existence more agreeable.\n\nThe Venetian Gasparo Gozzi was another Italian who returned to Gelli for inspiration in the 14 prose \"Dialoghi dell'isola di Circe\" (Dialogues from Circe's Island) published as journalistic pieces between 1760 and 1764. In this moral work, the aim of Ulysses in talking to the beasts is to learn more of the human condition. It includes figures from fable (The fox and the crow, XIII) and from myth to illustrate its vision of society at variance. Far from needing the intervention of Circe, the victims find their natural condition as soon as they set foot on the island. The philosopher here is not Gelli's elephant but the bat that retreats from human contact into the darkness, like Bruno's fireflies (VI). The only one who wishes to change in Gozzi's work is the bear, a satirist who had dared to criticize Circe and had been changed as a punishment (IX).\n\nThere were two more satirical dramas in later centuries. One modelled on the Gryllus episode in Plutarch occurs as a chapter of Thomas Love Peacock's late novel, \"Gryll Grange\" (1861), under the title \"Aristophanes in London\". Half Greek comedy, half Elizabethan masque, it is acted at the Grange by the novel's characters as a Christmas entertainment. In it Spiritualist mediums raise Circe and Gryllus and try to convince the latter of the superiority of modern times, which he rejects as intellectually and materially regressive. An Italian work drawing on the transformation theme was the comedy by , \"La figlia del Sole\" (The Daughter of the Sun, 1919). Hercules arrives on the island of Circe with his servant Cercopo and has to be rescued by the latter when he too is changed into a pig. But, since the naturally innocent other animals had become corrupted by imitating human vices, the others who had been changed were refused when they begged to be rescued.\n\nAlso in England, Austin Dobson engaged more seriously with Homer's account of the transformation of Odysseus' companions when, though\n\nDobson's \"\" depicts the horror of being imprisoned in an animal body in this way with the human consciousness unchanged. There appears to be no relief, for only in the final line is it revealed that Odysseus has arrived to free them.\n\nBut in Matthew Arnold's dramatic poem \"The Strayed Reveller\" (1849), in which Circe is one of the characters, the power of her potion is differently interpreted. The inner tendencies unlocked by it are not the choice between animal nature and reason but between two types of impersonality, between divine clarity and the poet's participatory and tragic vision of life. In the poem, Circe discovers a youth laid asleep in the portico of her temple by a draught of her ivy-wreathed bowl. On awaking from possession by the poetic frenzy it has induced, he craves for it to be continued.\n\nWith the Renaissance there began to be a reinterpretation of what it was that changed the men, if it was not simply magic. For Socrates, in Classical times, it had been gluttony overcoming their self-control. But for the influential emblematist Andrea Alciato, it was unchastity. In the second edition of his \"Emblemata\" (1546), therefore, Circe became the type of the prostitute. His Emblem 76 is titled \"Cavendum a meretricibus\"; its accompanying Latin verses mention Picus, Scylla and the companions of Ulysses, and concludes that 'Circe with her famous name indicates a whore and any who loves such a one loses his reason'. His English imitator Geoffrey Whitney used a variation of Alciato's illustration in his own \"Choice of Emblemes\" (1586) but gave it the new title of \"Homines voluptatibus transformantur\", men are transformed by their passions. This explains her appearance in the Nighttown section named after her in James Joyce's novel \"Ulysses\". Written in the form of a stage script, it makes of Circe the brothel madam, Bella Cohen. Bloom, the book's protagonist, fantasizes that she turns into a cruel man-tamer named Mr Bello who makes him get down on all fours and rides him like a horse.\n\nBy the 19th century, Circe was ceasing to be a mythical figure. Poets treated her either as an individual or at least as the type of a certain kind of woman. The French poet Albert Glatigny addresses \"Circé\" in his \"Les vignes folles\" (1857) and makes of her a voluptuous opium dream, the magnet of masochistic fantasies. Louis-Nicolas Ménard\"'s sonnet in \"Rêveries d'un païen mystique\" (1876) describes her as enchanting all with her virginal look, but appearance belies the accursed reality. Poets in English were not far behind in this lurid portrayal. Lord de Tabley\"'s \"Circe\" (1895) is a thing of decadent perversity likened to a tulip, A flaunting bloom, naked and undivine... With freckled cheeks and splotch'd side serpentine, A gipsy among flowers. That central image is echoed by the blood-striped flower of T.S.Eliot's student poem \"Circe's Palace\" (1909) in the Harvard Advocate. Circe herself does not appear, her character is suggested by what is in the grounds and the beasts in the forest beyond: panthers, pythons, and peacocks that 'look at us with the eyes of men whom we knew long ago'. Rather than a temptress, she has become an emasculatory threat.\n\nSeveral women poets make Circe stand up for herself, using the soliloquy form to voice the woman's position. The 19th-century English poet Augusta Webster, much of whose writing explored the female condition, has a dramatic monologue in blank verse titled \"Circe\" in her volume \"Portraits\" (1870). There the sorceress anticipates her meeting with Ulysses and his men and insists that she does not turn men into pigs—she merely takes away the disguise that makes them seem human.\n\nThe mythological character of the speaker contributes at a safe remove to the Victorian discourse on women's sexuality by expressing female desire and criticizing the subordinate role given to women in heterosexual politics.\n\nTwo American poets also explored feminine psychology in poems ostensibly about the enchantress. Leigh Gordon Giltner's \"Circe\" was included in her collection \"The Path of Dreams\" (1900), the first stanza of which relates the usual story of men turned to swine by her spell. But then a second stanza presents a sensuous portrait of an unnamed woman, very much in the French vein; once more, it concludes, 'A Circe's spells transform men into swine'. This is no passive victim of male projections but a woman conscious of her sexual power. So too is Hilda Doolittle's \"Circe\", from her collection \"Hymen\" (1921). In her soliloquy she reviews the conquests with which she has grown bored, then mourns the one instance when she failed. In not naming Ulysses himself, H.D. universalises an emotion with which all women might identify. At the end of the century, the British poet Carol Ann Duffy wrote a monologue entitled \"Circe\" which pictures the goddess addressing an audience of 'nereids and nymphs'. In this outspoken episode in the war between the sexes, Circe describes the various ways in which all parts of a pig could and should be cooked.\n\nAnother indication of the progression in interpreting the Circe figure is given by two poems a century apart, both of which engage with paintings of her. The first is the sonnet that Dante Gabriel Rossetti wrote in response to Edward Burne-Jones' \"The Wine of Circe\" in his volume \"Poems\" (1870). It gives a faithful depiction of the painting's Pre-Raphaelite mannerism but its description of Circe's potion as 'distilled of death and shame' also accords with the contemporary (male) identification of Circe with perversity. This is further underlined by his statement (in a letter) that the black panthers there are 'images of ruined passion' and by his anticipation at the end of the poem of 'passion's tide-strown shore Where the disheveled seaweed hates the sea'. The Australian A. D. Hope's \"Circe - after the painting by Dosso Dossi\", on the other hand, frankly admits humanity's animal inheritance as natural and something in which even Circe shares. In the poem, he links the fading rationality and speech of her lovers to her own animal cries in the act of love.\n\nThere remain some poems that bear her name that have more to do with their writers' private preoccupations than with reinterpreting her myth. The link with it in Margaret Atwood's \"Circe/Mud Poems\", first published in \"You Are Happy\" (1974), is more a matter of allusion and is nowhere overtly stated beyond the title. It is a reflection on contemporary gender politics that scarcely needs the disguises of Augusta Webster's. With two other poems by male writers it is much the same: Louis Macneice's, for example, whose \"Circe\" appeared in his first volume, \"Poems\" (London, 1935); or Robert Lowell's, whose \"Ulysses and Circe\" appeared in his last, \"Day by Day\" (New York, 1977). Both poets have appropriated the myth to make a personal statement about their broken relationships.\n\nSeveral Renaissance epics of the 16th century include lascivious sorceresses based on the Circe figure. These generally live in an isolated spot devoted to pleasure, to which lovers are lured and later changed into beasts. They include the following:\n\nIn addition, it has been argued that Titania in William Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" (1600) is an inversion of Circe. Titania (daughter of the Titans) was a title by which the sorceress was known in Classical times. In this case the tables are turned on the character, who is queen of the fairies. She is made to love an ass after, rather than before, he is transformed into his true animal likeness.\n\nIt has further been suggested that John Milton's \"Mask Presented at Ludlow Castle\" (1634) is a sequel to \"Tempe Restored,\" a masque in which Circe had figured two years earlier, and that the situation presented there is a reversal of the Greek myth. At the start of the masque, the character Comus is described as the son of Circe by Bacchus, god of wine, and the equal of his mother in enchantment. He too changes travelers into beastly forms that 'roll with pleasure in a sensual sty'. Having waylaid the heroine and immobilized her on an enchanted chair, he stands over her, wand in hand, and presses on her a magical cup (representing sexual pleasure and intemperance), which she repeatedly refuses, arguing for the virtuousness of temperance and chastity. The picture presented is a mirror image of the Classical story. In place of the witch who easily seduces the men she meets, a male enchanter is resisted by female virtue.\n\nIn the 20th century, the Circe episode was to be re-evaluated in two poetic sequels to the Odyssey. In the first of these, Giovanni Pascoli's \"L'Ultimo Viaggio\" (The Last Voyage, 1906), the aging hero sets out to rediscover the emotions of his youth by retracing his journey from Troy, only to discover that the island of Eea is deserted. What in his dream of love he had taken for the roaring of lions and Circe's song was now no more than the sound of the sea-wind in autumnal oaks (Cantos 16-17).\n\nThis melancholy dispelling of illusion is echoed in \"\" (1938) by Nikos Kazantzakis. The fresh voyage in search of new meaning to life recorded there grows out of the hero's initial rejection of his past experiences in the first two sections. The Circe episode is viewed by him as a narrow escape from death of the spirit.\n\nHis escape from this mire of sensuality comes one day when the sight of some fishermen, a mother and her baby enjoying the simple comforts of food and drink, recalls him to life, its duties and delights. Where the attempt by Pascoli's hero to recapture the past ended in failure, Kazantzakis' Odysseus, already realising the emptiness of his experiences, journeys into what he hopes will be a fuller future.\n\nAfter classical ballet separated from theatrical spectacle into a wordless form in which the story is expressed solely through movement, the subject of Circe was rarely visited. It figured as the first episode of three with mythological themes in \"Les Fêtes Nouvelles\" (New shows), staged by Sieur Duplessis le cadet in 1734, but the work was taken off after its third performance and not revived. The choreographer Antoine Pitrot also staged \"Ulysse dans l'isle de Circée\", describing it as a \"ballet sérieux, heroï-pantomime\" in 1764. Thereafter there seems to be nothing until the revival of ballet in the 20th century.\n\nIn 1963 the American choreographer Martha Graham created her \"Circe\" with a score by Alan Hovhaness. Its theme is psychological, representing the battle with animal instincts. The beasts portrayed extend beyond swine and include a goat, a snake, a lion and a deer. The theme has been described as one of 'highly charged erotic action', although set in 'a world where sexual frustration is rampant'. In that same decade Rudolf Brucci composed his \"Kirka\" (1967) in Croatia.\n\nThere is a Circe episode in John Harbison's \"Ulysses\" (Act 1, scene 2, 1983) in which the song of the enchantress is represented by ondes Martenot and tuned percussion. After the sailors of Ullyses are transformed into animals by her spell, a battle of wills follows between Circe and the hero. Though the men are changed back, Ulysses is charmed by her in his turn. In 1993, a full scale treatment of the story followed in 's 2-act \"Circe und Odysseus\". Also psychological in intent, it represents Circe's seduction of the restless hero as ultimately unsuccessful. The part played by the geometrical set in its Berlin production was particularly notable.\n\nBeside the verse dramas, with their lyrical interludes, on which many operas were based, there were poetic texts which were set as secular cantatas. One of the earliest was Alessandro Stradella's \"La Circe\", in a setting for three voices that bordered on the operatic. It was first performed at Frascati in 1667 to honour Cardinal Leopoldo de Medici and contained references to its surroundings. In the opening recitative, Circe explains that it was her son Telegonus who founded Frascati. The other characters with whom she enters into dialogue are the south wind (Zeffiro) and the local river Algido. In the following century, Antonio Vivaldi's cantata \"All'ombra di sospetto\" (In the shadow of doubt, RV 678) is set for a single voice and depicts Circe addressing Ulysses. The countertenor part is accompanied by flute, harpsichord, cello, and theorbo and features two recitatives and two arias. The piece is famous for the dialogue created between flute and voice, conjuring the moment of flirtation before the two become lovers.\n\nThe most successful treatment of the Ulysses episode in French was Jean-Baptiste Rousseau's poem \"Circé\" (1703), that was specifically written to be a cantata. The different verse forms employed allow the piece to be divided by the musicians that set it in order to express a variety of emotions. The poem opens with the abandoned Circe sitting on a high mountain and mourning the departure of Ulysses. The sorceress then calls on the infernal gods and makes a terrible sacrifice:\n\nBut though the earth is shaken to its core, Love is not to be commanded in this way and the wintery fields come back to life.\n\nThe earliest setting was by in 1706 and was popular for most of the rest of the century. One of its final moralising minuets, \"Ce n'est point par effort qu'on aime\" (Love won't be forced) was often performed independently and the score reprinted in many song collections. The flautist Michel Blavet arranged the music for this and the poem's final stanza, \"Dans les champs que l'Hiver désole\" (In the fields that Winter wastes), for two flutes in 174.The new setting of the cantata three years later by was equally successful and made the name of its nineteen-year-old composer. Originally for voice and bass continuo, it was expanded and considerably revised in 1729, with parts for flute, violin and viol added. Towards the end of the century, the choral setting by Georges Granges de Fontenelle (1769–1819) was equally to bring its young composer fame.\n\nRousseau's poem was also familiar to composers of other nationalities. Set for mezzo-soprano and full orchestra, it was given almost operatic treatment by the court composer Luigi Cherubini in 1789. set it for soprano and full orchestra in Dresden in 1787 at the request of the Russian ambassador to the Saxon Court, Prince Alexander Belosselsky. Although he spoke highly of Seydelmann's work, it is now judged grandiloquent and banal. The later setting by the Austrian composer Sigismond von Neukomm for soprano and full orchestra (Op. 4 1810) is better regarded.\n\nRecent treatments of the Circe theme include the Irish composer Gerald Victory's radio cantata \"Circe 1991\" (1973–75), David Gribble's \"A Threepenny Odyssey\", a fifteen-minute cantata for young people which includes the episode on Circe's Isle, and Malcolm Hayes' \"Odysseus remembers\" (2003–04), which includes parts for Circe, Anticleia and Tiresias. 's song cycle \"Circe\" (1998) grew out of his work on his 1993 ballet with Thomas Höft. The latter subsequently wrote seven poems in German featuring Circe's role as seductress in a new light: here it is to freedom and enlightenment that she tempts her hearers. Another cycle of \"Seven Songs for High Voice and Piano\" (2008) by the American composer Martin Hennessey includes the poem \"Circe's Power\" from Louise Glück's \"Meadowlands\" (1997).\n\nThere have also been treatments of Circe in popular music, in particular the relation of the Odysseus episode in Friedrich Holländer's song of 1958. In addition, text in Homeric Greek is included in the \"Circe's Island\" episode in David Bedford's \"The Odyssey\" (1976). This was the ancestor of several later electronic suites that reference the Odysseus legend, with \"Circe\" titles among them, having little other programmatic connection with the myth itself.\n\nWhile operas on the subject of Circe did not cease, they were overtaken for a while by the new musical concept of the symphonic poem which, whilst it does not use a sung text, similarly seeks a union of music and drama. A number of purely musical works fall into this category from the late 19th century onwards, of which one of the first was Heinrich von Herzogenberg's \"Odysseus\" (Op.16, 1873). A Wagnerian symphony for large orchestra, dealing with the hero's return from the Trojan war, its third section is titled \"Circe's Gardens\" (\"Die Gärten der Circe\").\n\nIn the 20th century, 's cycle \"Aus Odysseus Fahrten\" (From Odysseus'Voyage, Op.6, 1903) was equally programmatic and included the visit to Circe's Isle (\"Die Insel der Circe\") as its second long section. After a depiction of the sea voyage, a bass clarinet passage introduces an ensemble of flute, harp and solo violin over a lightly orchestrated accompaniment, suggesting Circe's seductive attempt to hold Odysseus back from traveling further. Alan Hovhaness' Circe Symphony (No.18, Op.204a, 1963) is a late example of such programmatic writing. It is, in fact, only a slightly changed version of his ballet music of that year, with the addition of more strings, a second timpanist and celesta.\n\nWith the exception of 's prelude for orchestra (1972), most later works have been for a restricted number of instruments. They include Hendrik de Regt's \"Circe\" (Op.44, 1975) for clarinet, violin and piano; Christian Manen's \"Les Enchantements De Circe\" (Op.96, 1975) for bassoon and piano; and Jacques Lenot's \"Cir(c)é\" (1986) for oboe d'amore. The German experimental musician Dieter Schnebel's \"Circe\" (1988) is a work for harp, the various sections of which are titled \"Signale\" (signals), \"Säuseln\" (whispers), \"Verlockungen\" (enticements), \"Pein\" (pain), \"Schläge\" (strokes) and \"Umgarnen\" (snare), which give some idea of their programmatic intent.\n\nMichael Amann (born 1964) provides notes for his \"Kirke\" for voice, violin, piano and percussion (1995). It is based on four excerpts from Homer's \"Odyssey\" and emphasises a variety of vocal uses for the mezzo-soprano part. He explains that 'the play between the foreseeable (deep structure) and the unexpected (surface) is for me an analogy of Ulysses (who realises Circe is a sorceress, so that the consequence of her magic is ineffective) and Odysseus' companions, whom Circe's enchantments take by surprise'. Questioned in an interview about how this worked in terms of his composition, he explained that this meant disrupting the musical structure once it was established and that the singer's shift between voice tones, singing and non-communicative vocalisation equates to the movement from solitude to self-expression. Dominique Lemaitre's \"Circé\" for soprano and eight cellos (1998) is equally programmatic. In it the singer's voice floats over the instruments, creating much the same the successive emotional effects as those in settings of Rousseau's poem.\n\nThea Musgrave's \"Circe\" for three flutes (1996) was eventually to become the fourth piece in her six-part \"Voices from the Ancient World\" for various combinations of flute and percussion (1998). Her note on these explains that their purpose is to 'describe some of the personages of ancient Greece' and that Circe was 'the enchantress who changed men into beasts'. The most recent reference is the harpsichordist Fernando De Luca's Sonata II for viola da gamba, which is titled \"Circe's cave\" (\"L'antro della maga Circe\").\n\nScenes from the \"Odyssey\" are common on Greek pottery, the Circe episode among them. The two most common representations have Circe surrounded by the transformed sailors and Odysseus threatening the sorceress with his sword. In the case of the former, the animals are not always boars but also include, for instance, the ram, dog and lion on the 6th century BC Boston kylix. Often the transformation is only partial, involving the head and perhaps a sprouting tail, while the rest of the body is human. In describing an otherwise obscure 5th-century Greek bronze in the Walters Art Museum that takes the form of a man on all fours with the foreparts of a pig, the commentator asks in what other way could an artist depict someone bewitched other than as a man with an animal head. In these scenes Circe is shown almost invariably stirring the potion with her wand, although the incident as described in Homer has her use the wand only to bewitch the sailors after they have refreshed themselves. One exception is the Berlin amphora on which the seated Circe holds the wand towards a half transformed man.\n\nIn the second scene, Odysseus threatens the sorceress with a drawn sword, as Homer describes it. However, he is sometimes depicted carrying spears as well, as in the Athens lekythos, while Homer reports that it was a bow he had slung over his shoulder. In this episode Circe is generally shown in flight, and on the Erlangen lekythos can clearly be seen dropping the bowl and wand behind her. Two curiously primitive wine bowls incorporate the Homeric detail of Circe's handloom, at which the men approaching her palace could hear her singing sweetly as she worked. In the 5th century skyphos from Boeotia an apparently crippled Odysseus leans on a crutch while a woman with negroid features holds out a disproportionately large bowl. In the other, a pot-bellied hero brandishes a sword while Circe stirs her potion. Both these may depict the scene as represented in one or other of the comic satyr plays which deal with their encounter. Little remains of these now beyond a few lines by Aeschylus, Ephippus of Athens and Anaxilas. Other vase paintings from the period suggest that Odysseus' half-transformed animal-men formed the chorus in place of the usual satyrs. The reason that it should be a subject of such plays is that wine drinking was often central to their plot. Later writers were to follow Socrates in interpreting the episode as illustrating the dangers of drunkenness.\n\nOther artefacts depicting the story include the chest of Cypselus described in the travelogue by Pausanias. Among its many carvings \"there is a grotto and in it a woman sleeping with a man upon a couch. I was of opinion that they were Odysseus and Circe, basing my view upon the number of the handmaidens in front of the grotto and upon what they are doing. For the women are four, and they are engaged on the tasks which Homer mentions in his poetry. The passage in question describes how one of them \"threw linen covers over the chairs and spread fine purple fabrics on top. Another drew silver tables up to the chairs, and laid out golden dishes, while a third mixed sweet honeyed wine in a silver bowl, and served it in golden cups. The fourth fetched water and lit a roaring fire beneath a huge cauldron.\" This suggests a work of considerable detail, while the Etruscan coffin preserved in Orvieto's archaeological museum has only four figures. At the centre Osysseus threatens Circe with drawn sword while an animal headed figure stands on either side, one of them laying his hand familiarly on the hero's shoulder. A bronze mirror relief in the Fitzwilliam Museum is also Etruscan and is inscribed with the names of the characters. There a pig is depicted at Circe's feet, while Odysseus and Elpenor approach her, swords drawn.\n\nDuring the 18th century painters began to portray individual actors in scenes from named plays. There was also a tradition of private performances, with a variety of illustrated works to help with stage properties and costumes. Among these was Thomas Jefferys' \"A Collection of the Dresses of Different Nations, Antient and Modern\" (1757–72) which included a copperplate engraving of a crowned Circe in loose dress, holding a goblet aloft in her right hand and a long wand in her left. Evidence of such performances during the following decades is provided by several portraits in character, of which one of the earliest was the pastel by Daniel Gardner (1750–1805) of \"Miss Elliot as Circe\". The artist had been a pupil of both George Romney and Joshua Reynolds, who themselves were soon to follow his example. On the 1778 engraving based on Gardner<nowiki>'s portrait appear the lines from Milton's ‘'Comus\"</nowiki>\n\nin compliment to the charm of this marriageable daughter of a country house. As in the Jefferys' plate, she wears a silver coronet over tumbled dark hair, with a wand in the right hand and a goblet in the left. In hindsight the frank eyes that look directly at the viewer and the rosebud mouth are too innocent for the role Miss Elliot is playing.\n\nThe subjects of later paintings impersonating Circe have a history of sexual experience behind them, starting with \"Mary Spencer in the character of Circe\" by William Caddick, which was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1780. The subject here was the mistress of the painter George Stubbs. A portrait of \"Mrs Nesbitt as Circe\" by Joshua Reynolds followed in 1781. Though this lady's past was ambiguous, she had connections with those in power and was used by the Government as a secret agent. In the painting she is seated sideways, wearing a white, loose-fitting dress, with a wand in her right hand and a gilded goblet near her left. A monkey is crouching above her in the branches of a tree and a panther fraternizes with the kitten on her knee. While the painting undoubtedly alludes to her reputation, it also places itself within the tradition of dressing up in character.\n\nSoon afterwards, the notorious Emma Hamilton was to raise this to an art form, partly by the aid of George Romney's many paintings of her impersonations. Romney's preliminary study of Emma's head and shoulders, at present in the Tate Gallery, with its piled hair, expressive eyes and mouth, is reminiscent of Samuel Gardener's portrait of Miss Elliot. In the full-length \"Lady Hamilton as Circe\" at Waddesdon Manor, she is placed in a wooded landscape with wolves snarling to her left, although the tiger originally there has now been painted out. Her left arm is raised to cast a spell while the wand points downward in her right. After Emma moved to Naples and joined Lord Hamilton, she developed what she called her \"Attitudes\" into a more public entertainment. Specially designed, loose-fitting tunics were paired with large shawls or veils as she posed in such a way as to evoke figures from Classical mythology. These developed from mere poses, with the audience guessing the names of the classical characters and scenes that she portrayed, into small, wordless charades.\n\nThe tradition of dressing up in character continued into the following centuries. One of the photographic series by Julia Margaret Cameron, a pupil of the painter George Frederic Watts, was of mythical characters, for whom she used the children of friends and servants as models. Young Kate Keown sat for the head of \"Circe\" in about 1865 and is pictured wearing a grape and vineleaf headdress to suggest the character's use of wine to bring a change in personality. The society portrait photographer Yevonde Middleton, also known as Madame Yevonde, was to use a 1935 aristocratic charity ball as the foundation for her own series of mythological portraits in colour. Its participants were invited to her studio afterwards to pose in their costumes. There Baroness Dacre is pictured as Circe with a leafy headdress about golden ringlets and clasping a large Baroque porcelain goblet.\n\nA decade earlier, the illustrator Charles Edmund Brock extended into the 20th century what is almost a pastiche of the 18th-century conversation piece in his \"Circe and the Sirens\" (1925). In this the Honourable Edith Chaplin (1878–1959), Marchioness of Londonderry, and her three youngest daughters are pictured in a garden setting grouped about a large pet goat. Three women painters also produced portraits using the convention of the sitter in character. The earliest was Beatrice Offor (1864–1920), whose sitter's part in her 1911 painting of Circe is suggested by the vine-leaf crown in her long dark hair, the snake-twined goblet she carries and the snake bracelet on her left arm. Mary Cecil Allen was of Australian origin but was living in the United States at the time \"Miss Audrey Stevenson as Circe\" was painted (1930). Though only a head and shoulders sketch, its colouring and execution suggest the sitter's lively personality. Rosemary Valodon (born 1947), from the same country, painted a series of Australian personalities in her goddess series. \"Margarita Georgiadis as Circe\" (1991) is a triptych, the central panel of which portrays an updated, naked femme fatale reclining in tropical vegetation next to a pig's head.\n\nOne painting at least depicts an actress playing the part of Circe. This is Franz von Stuck's striking portrait of \" as Circe\" (1913). She played this part in a Viennese revival of Calderon's play in 1912 and there is a publicity still of her by Isidor Hirsch in which she is draped across a sofa and wearing an elaborate crown. Her enticing expression and the turn of her head there is almost exactly that of Van Stuck's enchantress as she holds out the poisoned bowl. It suggests the use of certain posed publicity photos in creating the same iconic effect as had paintings in the past. A nearly contemporary example was the 1907 photo of Mme Geneviève Vix as Circe in the light opera by Lucien Hillenacher at the Opéra-Comique in Paris. The posing of the actress and the cropping of the image so as to highlight her luxurious costume demonstrates its ambition to create an effect that goes beyond the merely theatrical. A later example is the still of Silvana Mangano in her part as Circe in the 1954 film \"Ulysses\", which is as cunningly posed for effect.\n\n"}

The film was directed by John Gulager and written by Marcus Dunstan and Patrick Melton.\n\nThe film was followed by \"\" (2009).\n\nBiker Queen, twin sister of Harley Mom, discovers the severed arm of her sister from the previous film. Upon discovering the surviving Bartender, she tortures him into telling her who killed Harley Mom. He reveals that it was Bozo and points her to a town where he lives. She knocks Bartender out and takes him with her to the town.\n\nPrior to the events of the first film, the town was overrun by the monsters. A pair of small Mexican wrestlers named Thunder and Lightning were attacked by the monsters and Lightning's girlfriend was killed. Inside the jail, a \"Hobo\" was in a cell for dealing methamphetamine and questioned where his school bus (makeshift meth lab) is at. The Sheriff taunted him before being killed. A car salesman named Slasher found evidence of his wife cheating with one of his employees and barely escaped the monsters.\n\nBiker Queen and four of her friends arrive in the deserted town with the Bartender, ignoring the dead bodies as they look for Bozo and cross paths with Slasher, his wife Secrets and the man she has an affair with, Greg. The group is attacked by a monster, which kills one of the biker girls, Tot Girl. The others and the Bartender make their way to Bozo's apartment, where they encounter Honey Pie, the girl who left the group from the first movie behind at the bar. Bartender brutally attacks her and knocks Honey Pie out of the window and onto the street. Honey Pie survives the fall and goes into hiding.\n\nSlasher, Greg and Secrets receive a call from the wrestlers, but before they find them they are ambushed by the bikers. Both groups get to a garage where the brothers and their grandmother are hiding. The group then tries to make it to the jail, but the hobo has sealed himself in.\n\nAs the wrestlers try to fashion a skeleton key for the jail house, Greg dissects one of the monsters, gravely injuring the wrestlers' grandmother when the creature vomits. They discover an eye in the creature's intestines that acts like an alarm system, and cause it to make a terrifying howl in the process. As a result, more monsters swarm the garage. The brothers return with the key but the group must go to the roof to escape the monsters. The survivors on the roof hears a baby crying, trapped inside a station wagon Slasher sold prior to the attack. The next morning, Greg tries to save the baby, but when he encounters a monster and his plan backfires, he throws the baby to the air, leaving him to the monster to eat as a distraction when he has trouble escaping.\n\nMeanwhile, Honey Pie, who has spent the night trapped in a store, is ambushed by one of the monsters. She manages to knock it out and uses its claws to make a hole in the bullet-proof glass of the store's door. As she is getting out, the monster regains consciousness and starts to chase her down the street.\n\nTrapped on the roof, the group sacrifices Splat Girl to the monsters and fashion a catapult with Biker Queen's motorcycle and the biker girls' clothes. Using the wrestlers' gravely injured grandmother to test it, they cause her to smash into a wall and die. Thunder gets onto the catapult but is thrown into the street where he is quickly attacked by the monsters and disemboweled. Greg is then severely injured when the bike's tailpipe flies into his head. Meanwhile, Lightning crosses the street under the protection of a trash can. Thunder, missing his legs, crawls away while Lightning picks up the key he had dropped. Lightning reaches the jail house, but as he opens the door the hobo throws a stick of dynamite out. Lightning ducks down in the trashcan to protect himself from the explosion and is launched across the street.\n\nHoney Pie, who made it to the border of the town, is injured by flying shrapnel from the trashcan and falls to the floor, apparently dead. The others watch as the monsters begin breaking onto the rooftop. Suddenly, Honey Pie gets up, grabs her gun and screams in anguish.\n\n"}
{"id": "46433479", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46433479", "title": "Feminist children's literature", "text": "Feminist children's literature\n\nFeminist children's literature is the writing of children's literature through a feminist lens. Children's literature and women's literature have many similarities. Both often deal with being weak and placed towards the bottom of a hierarchy. In this way feminist ideas are regularly found in the structure of children's literature. Feminist criticism of children's literature is therefore expected, since it is a type of feminist literature. Feminist children's literature has played a critical role for the feminist movement, especially in the past half century. In her book \"Feminism Is for Everybody: Passionate Politics\", bell hooks states her belief that all types of media, including writing and children's books, need to promote feminist ideals. She argues \"Children's literature is one of the most crucial sites for feminist education for critical consciousness precisely because beliefs and identities are still being formed\". The cover of hooks' book, drawn by Laura DeSantis, depicts children alongside adults, showing the importance of the youth. The presence of feminism in children's literature has evolved over the years, but the overall message and goals have remained consistent.\n\nDuring the second half of the twentieth century, children's literature and the feminist movement made many improvements together. A currently accepted method of thought for children's literature criticism in the academic world came to life during the 1970s, the same time that the second wave of feminist theory became popular. Early in the decade, feminist critics like Kate Millett explained how good writing was based on a belief that being a white male was normal and anyone else was a deviation from the normal. At this time, many female characters in children's books \"play dead or doormats (as in 'Snow White', 'Cinderella', and 'Sleeping Beauty') or are severely mutilated (as in 'The Little Mermaid')\". Due to the second wave of feminism, gender roles in all of the classic fairy tales (such as those by Grimm, Andersen, and Perrault) were starting to be questioned. Female heroes of the time were also inadequate. The women were simply \"men tricked out in drag\" and had the same exact plotlines as the male heroes. The only difference was that instead of needing to be rescued, the heroines did the rescuing.<ref name=\"Taylor & Francis Ltd / Books\"></ref> More and more studies began emerging from children's literature. All the findings agreed that women were drastically underrepresented and given few options. Boys were overwhelmingly shown to be much more active and have adventures more frequently, while girls were passive and remained in the home with the adult women. Countless studies conducted over the years all had the same or similar results.\n\nA study conducted in 1976 by the Feminist Press examined picture books for children between the ages of four and eight published from 1972. Books were chosen if they contained the following themes: an active and adventurous girl protagonist, boys expressing multiple emotions and being sensitive, and non-traditional families that reflect multiple aspects of society. The picture books were then examined for gender stereotypes in primary and secondary characterizations, illustrations, and language. The results showed many instances of sexism. Out of a few thousand picture books published in the five-year span, fewer than 200 met the qualities needed. Although 35 publishers were represented by the books, only about six publishing houses made up the majority. Furthermore, most of the stories only had the first quality, which was a girl as an active protagonist. However, there was a problem in these stories as well. While the young main character could go out on adventures, the mother and grandmother characters were stuck in traditional roles. The study found limited examples of books that showed men as nurturing or of characters in non-traditional families. Only 143 books in the study were decided to be recommendable, 28 were somewhat recommendable, and 22 were not recommendable at all.\n\nIn 1989 a study was done in which the number of female and male characters in children's books was measured. It found that books from 1972 had female characters only 25% of the time, while in 1989 female characters were shown just as frequently as male characters. It also discovered that Caldecott winners and honor books were becoming more likely to have female characters, and that they were not given stereotyped roles as they were in the 1960s. In the late 1960s, only 1% of animal illustrations in Caldecott books were females. However, by the late 80s that number increased to 22%, and by the late 90s it was at about 72%.\n\nThree studies done in the late 1970s and early 80s yielded interesting results about what children like to have in their books. In 1975 Sally Jennings completed a study that found that kids around the age of four remember stories where characters do reversed-stereotyped things more than they remember stories where characters act according to classic gender roles. In 1978, a study by Sally Koblinksky found that by the age of 10 children better remember stories with stereotyped characters. A study done by Jerri Kropp and Charles Halverston in 1983 showed that children in preschool dislike hearing stories in which characters of the opposite gender act along gender stereotypes more than they dislike stories that have characters that do reverse-stereotyped things.\n\nIn the early 1990s several studies were carried out that showed an increase in equality in award-winning children's literature. The research found that only 11.1% of Caldecotts during 1967 to 1971 had female protagonist. During the years 1987 to 1991, however, 43.2% had main characters that were female. By the start of the twenty-first century, reverse-stereotyped roles in the protagonist were as popular as stereotyped roles during the late 1960s.\n\nBy 1992 only 32% of Pulitzer Prizes for fiction writing, and a mere 8% of Nobel Prizes in literature, were awarded to women. However, women had won 66% of Newbery Medals. The number of female authors producing children's literature was a strong factor in these statistics.\n\nWhile it is important for females and males to be depicted equally in children's books, that is not the main purpose of feminist children's literature. Children's books often focus on people or animals who do not have power because they are placed at the bottom of a hierarchy. Therefore, it is the goal of feminists to promote children's literature that gives children autonomy and the authority to speak and be heard. Books for children need to show how important it is to be able to listen and hear the accounts of others' stories. Furthermore, feminist theory gives children the right to be included in the literary community, to no longer be oppressed by a hierarchical order of power. A final goal of feminists is to create non-sexist books that show what society is becoming. Promoting feminist theory without being labeled as a \"message book\" is crucial to the cause. By focusing on these goals, feminist authors hope to get their message across while still producing quality books for children.\n\nBeginning in the 1960s, feminism began to appear in many forms of media because of the social changes taking place at the time. Feminists began to use children's books to spread a better understanding of feminism and the stereotypes of women. As children are a main target of the influential stereotypes of patriarchal mass media and important receptors of literature, they can be influenced by feminist literature to help abandon any learned stereotypes. Since second-wave feminism, children's literature has been influenced by feminist theory and ideals, and is still growing as an influential media source in literature in today's society.\n\nIn \"Feminism is for Everybody\", bell hooks expresses her enthusiasm for spreading feminist ideals to everyone to prevent stereotypes and give people new perspectives on feminism. She argues that feminism needs to be shared through many sources of media so that its ideals are easily accessible to everyone. Feminist theory can be found in children's literature. Hooks states, \"There should be so many little feminist primers, easy to read pamphlets and books, telling us all about feminism, that this book would be just another passionate voice speaking out on behalf of feminist politics\". Feminist children's literature provides one form of this easy-to-read media. It either acts to highlight women and educate people about their history, or it subtly shares ideas of reversed gender roles where a female character might have more power.\n\nChildren's literature can be a valuable media source to influence children's views as they learn gender stereotypes and stereotypes about women in society. Feminism began to have an increasing presence in children's literature after second-wave feminism. According to Kinga Varga-Dobai, second-wave feminist research had a huge impact on media such as children's literature. An article by Abigail Feely states, \"Children's books published during and after the second-wave feminists movement provide unique clues into the gradual normalization of feminist rhetoric into broader cultural context\". Varga-Dobai also states that the 1960s brought about the ideas of multicultural literature because of \"shifting social and political perspectives on race, class, and gender.\" People began to pay more attention to the degree that children were being influenced by any ideologies embedded in children's books. Many feminists noticed that traditional folktales contained female characteristics that feminists did not agree with. Varga-Dobai says that female characters in children's novels began to be portrayed as more daring, active, and independent, in order to provide girls with a new image of an ideal female.\n\nThe idea of a strong, independent female character in children's books plays into the topic of gender representation. According to Varga-Dobai, \"The study of gender portrayals in children's literature has been closely informed by both cultural and feminist studies because women, as members of culture, have often been represented as the \"other\" in literature\". Therefore, feminists work to overcome any misrepresentations or stereotypes of gender in children's literature. Feminists want children to be educated through a feminist view so that their opinions are not as skewed when it comes to gender stereotypes and education of influential women. Also according to Varga-Dobai, \"From a postconstructural feminist perspective, gender representations should allow for a more complex portrayal of subject positions available for female characters\". As second-wave feminism brought social change in women's positions in society, female characters also began to take on a social change, moving away from the traditional female characters.\n\nOne example of a children's book that includes feminist ideals that highlight females is \"Rad American Women A-Z\" by Kate Shatz. Inspired by her two-year-old daughter, Schatz wanted to create a book that educates children on women's history and also teaches them the alphabet. She noticed the gap in feminist-inspired children's literature. The book features inspirational women of different races whose names start with each letter of the alphabet. It highlights influential women, or \"feminist heroes,\" who have made important accomplishments but may not be well known. This book not only intends to fill a hole in feminist literature for children, but also to address and represent race through the women that Schatz includes. This book begins to fulfill the need of \"easy to read pamphlets and books\" that hooks discusses.\n\nA prominent example of a feminist children's story that subtly speaks out about the issues of gender stereotypes is \"The Paper Bag Princess\" by Robert Munsch. Some consider this story to be the birth of feminist literature. It is a fairytale that has a strong female character and a feminist ending rather than a traditional story ending. The princess wears a paper bag and puts herself in danger to rescue the prince. However, the prince is ungrateful because she does not look like a real princess in her paper bag. Like many children's books, this story shows reversed roles of male and female characters, which reveals that feminist ideals are seeping into children's literature.\n\nChildren's literature can have a significant impact in the classroom. As children learn about issues of culture, feminist lenses are encouraging students to take on different perspectives. Learning through a feminist lens also encourages different views not only about gender representations, but also about race and class. It is believed that feminist theory can transform students' readings by how much they recognize the different gender patterns throughout literature. An article by Feely suggests, \"Many radical and incorrect images of feminism persist in the popular imagination. At the same time, ironically, feminism has become so ingrained into mainstream culture that many students don't recognize it\". Feminism is sometimes skewed in the popular media, but it is also subtly fixed into culture in different ways such as through children's literature. As students learn, they are heavily influenced by mainstream culture, but incorporating children's literature into classroom settings can help expand opinions.\n\nFeminist children's books are becoming more prevalent, but we are still in need of more female children's authors and books, according to hooks. In hooks' opinion, \"We are not there yet. But this is what we must do to share feminism, to let the movement into everybody's mind and heart\". She believes that there is still much to be done to spread the correct image of feminism, whether it is done through children's literature or through mainstream media sources. Feminism has become more prevalent in children's books since second-wave feminism, but there is still a gap in children's feminist literature that can continue to be filled.\n\nHistorically children’s books were written to entertain and educate children. However, new readings of children’s books reveal unethical concepts towards racism, gender and colonialism. New gender and feminist studies endeavour to right these wrongs. The goal is to unlearn previous negative attitudes of race and gender. Children’s learning is to be moulded in diversity and inclusivity is a moral principle and mutual obligation by parents, educators and the community. The ethics in children’s books guide the young reader to form basic concepts and fundamental principles of decent human conduct and essential equality. Ethics help children to shape the way they live, what they do, and how they make choices and values in their world. \nSince the mid -50s it has become vogue to reread and reinterpret classic children’s books. As to what children’s books should accomplish trouble cultural observers. However, they agree that the narratives in children’s books must delete unequal social arrangements: and instead of identifying inequality, describe, challenge, and subvert systems of inequality.\n\nGender stereotypes found in innocent characters in fairy tales and racism and sexism found in the simplistic adventures of Thomas the Tank Engine do not give children positive role models.\n\nThe message in the Little Red Hen, teamwork and hard work, is overlooked and its main character has become a racist capitalist who refused to feed the poor.\n\nPeter Pan saves Tiger Lilly, and his heroic gesture is indicative of her as uneducated and savage because she is a female.\n\nA picture book Rosie’s Walk, written by Pat Hutchinson, about a hen who is unaware that a fox is hunting her in the farmyard is seen as a symbol of ‘stupid womanhood.’ However, critics overlook the humours musings of Rosie’s walk around the farmyard.\n\nCritics in America suggest a rewriting of Cinderella in a ‘less sexist vein.’ Cinderella is too pretty; she has dishpan hands and flat feet because she does too much housework and Cinderella dances with too many men in one night.\n\nThe Famous Five, critics accuse Enid Blyton’s depiction of boys and girls as sexist. It is not enough for Georgina to be a leader if she looks like a girl. The character has to take on the persona of a boy by having short hair and demanding to be called George.\n\nThe independent, self-assertive, supergirl, Pippi Longstocking is but a boy in disguise.\n\nThese generalizations are counter-productive and divert from the more overtly severe cases, such as Little Black Sambo (1899). However, the author, Helen Bannerman had no obnoxious intentions; by default, she did not have a talent for drawing. Polar, written by Elaine Moss, about a polar bear, was rejected by an American publisher because the bear is ‘explicitly white.’\n\nIn an attempt to avoid stereotypes, girls are shown as strong, brave and resourceful, mothers go out to work, boys knit, and fathers cook cakes. Authors write, and editors publish in fear in absurd efforts to avoid giving offence. Another implication of these attitudes is a reverse gender stratification: girls cannot wear pink as it sets a gender norm of the feminine and boys must not wear blue as it sets a gender norm of masculine traits. However, because the unrealistic generalizations of gender representation in the debate on rewriting classic books, stripping them of all negative gender, sexism and racial bias continues.  Sarah Begley, Time (2017), advises parents to read with their children, ‘children are going to encounter it, and a safer way to learn how to counter it is via fiction. If you are reading a sexist/racist children’s book with a child, you can help them read it critically.’ Another critic, Malcolm Jones, cites from the National Coalition Against Censorship, PEN American Center, and the First Amendment Committee of American Society of Journalists and Authors who argued ‘while it is perfectly valid for critics to dispute a book’s historical accuracy and literary merits, the appropriate response is not to withdraw the volume and deprive readers of a chance to evaluate the book and the controversy for themselves.’\n\nAmy Singer suggests children are deprived of great literature, exciting stories, mystery, and adventure in the rewriting of classical children’s books. Furthermore, these books are useful as historical evidence of how and what shaped people’s attitude in the time they were written and supply a source of debate of right and wrong and how we acknowledge that there is a better way to live. Moreover, studies by sociologists focus on the behaviour of boys and girls in books as an ideological reality of individual ability and character. In\"Novel Readings\"(1990) Marjorie DeVault suggests, ‘readers of a single novel create an individual understanding of that novel, alongside the meanings that the novel’s creator might have intended.’\n\nHowever, Amy Singer, claims that ‘a subversive story for children will include not only strong role models at an individual level but also connections between social power and inequality.’ The questions Singer asks are how connected are the narratives of the protagonists to the social structures in which they live and do they implicate a subversive representation of the cultural stratification. The questionnaire that Singer developed in her analysis of children’s books takes into consideration the:\n\nBook publication date, publisher, author and the elements of narrative texts. What is the books setting, who is the primary character, is there an implied reader and what is her/his implied body of knowledge?\n\nMoreover, Ewick and Silbey suggest that children’s narratives can ‘support challenges to the status quo by illuminating a set of tactics for future use.' Children’s narratives can inspire change and can provide the exposure of power as a means to reverse that power. When children read books, they look for role models with leadership qualities. Due to the lack of female representation, girls are being denied positive role models to emulate. In order to dispel the belief there is only one way to identify as male or female in children’s books, a variety of characters, personality traits and behaviours are paramount in the writing of children’s books.\n\nMore important, children’s narratives can teach children how social arrangements are gendered and how they may determine their fates. The role model that characters play out and their narratives can draw attention to social relationships and teach young readers to think critically about what they read. Furthermore, to expose young readers to social systems and inequality will teach them how the world is organised and how they might be negotiated or challenged. \n"}
{"id": "23854860", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23854860", "title": "Fight Club (novel)", "text": "Fight Club (novel)\n\nFight Club is a 1996 novel by Chuck Palahniuk. It follows the experiences of an unnamed protagonist struggling with insomnia. Inspired by his doctor's exasperated remark that insomnia is not suffering, the protagonist finds relief by impersonating a seriously ill person in several support groups. Then he meets a mysterious man named Tyler Durden and establishes an underground fighting club as radical psychotherapy.\n\nIn 1999, director David Fincher adapted the novel into a film of the same name, starring Brad Pitt and Edward Norton. The film acquired a cult following despite lower than expected box-office results. The film's prominence heightened the profile of the novel and that of Palahniuk. The sequel \"Fight Club 2\" was released in comic book form in May 2015.\n\n\"Fight Club\" centers on an anonymous narrator, who works as a product recall specialist for an unnamed car company. Because of the stress of his job and the jet lag brought upon by frequent business trips, he begins to suffer from recurring insomnia. When he seeks treatment, his doctor advises him to visit a support group victims to \"see what real suffering is like\". He finds that sharing the problems of others—despite not having testicular cancer himself—alleviates his insomnia.\n\nThe narrator's unique treatment works until he meets Marla Singer, another \"tourist\" who visits the support group under false pretenses. The possibly disturbed Marla reminds the narrator that he is a faker who does not belong there. He begins to hate Marla for keeping him from crying, and, therefore, from sleeping. After a confrontation, the two agree to attend separate support group meetings to avoid each other. The truce is uneasy, and the narrator's insomnia returns.\n\nWhile on a nude beach, the narrator meets Tyler Durden, a charismatic extremist of mysterious means. After an explosion destroys the narrator's condominium, he asks to stay at Tyler's house. Tyler agrees, but asks for something in return: \"I want you to hit me as hard as you can.\" Both men find that they enjoy the ensuing fistfight. They subsequently move in together and establish a \"fight club\", drawing numerous men with similar temperaments into bare-knuckle fighting matches, set to the following rules:\n\nLater in the book, a mechanic tells the narrator about two new rules of the fight club: nobody is the center of the fight club except for the two men fighting, and the fight club will always be free.\n\nMarla, noticing that the narrator has not recently attended his support groups, calls him to claim that she has overdosed on Xanax in a half-hearted suicide attempt. Tyler returns from work, picks up the phone to Marla's drug-induced rambling, and rescues her. Tyler and Marla embark on an uneasy affair that confounds the narrator and confuses Marla. Throughout this affair, Marla is unaware both of fight club's existence and the interaction between Tyler and the narrator. Because Tyler and Marla are never seen at the same time, the narrator wonders whether Tyler and Marla are the same person.\n\nAs fight club attains a nationwide presence, Tyler uses it to spread his anti-consumerist ideas, recruiting fight club's members to participate in increasingly elaborate pranks on corporate America. He eventually gathers the most devoted fight club members and forms \"Project Mayhem\", a cult-like organization that trains itself as an army to bring down modern civilization. This organization, like fight club, is controlled by a set of rules:\n\nWhile initially a loyal participant in Project Mayhem, the narrator becomes uncomfortable with the increasing destructiveness of its activities. He resolves to stop Tyler and his followers when Bob, a friend from the testicular cancer support group, is killed during one of Project Mayhem's sabotage operations. \n\nThe narrator then learns that he himself is Tyler Durden.\n\nAs the narrator's mental state deteriorated, his mind formed a new personality that was able to escape from the problems of his life. Marla inadvertently reveals to the narrator that he and Tyler are the same person. Tyler's affair with Marla—whom the narrator professes to dislike—was the narrator's own affair with Marla. The narrator's bouts of insomnia had been Tyler's personality surfacing; Tyler was active whenever the narrator was \"sleeping\". The Tyler personality not only created fight club, he also blew up the Narrator's condo.\n\nTyler plans to blow up a skyscraper using homemade bombs created by Project Mayhem; the target of the explosion is the nearby national museum. Tyler plans to die as a martyr during this event, taking the narrator's life as well. Realizing this, the narrator sets out to stop Tyler, although Tyler is always thinking ahead of him. The narrator makes his way to the roof of the building, where Tyler holds him at gunpoint. When Marla comes to the roof with one of the support groups, Tyler vanishes, as Tyler \"was his hallucination, not hers.\"\n\nWith Tyler gone, the narrator waits for the bomb to explode and kill him. The bomb malfunctions because Tyler mixed paraffin into the explosives. Still alive and holding Tyler's gun, the narrator makes the first decision that is truly his own: he puts the gun in his mouth and shoots himself. Some time later, he awakens in a mental hospital, believing he is in Heaven, and imagines an argument with God over human nature. The book ends with the narrator being approached by hospital employees who reveal themselves to be Project members. They tell him their plans still continue, and that they are expecting Tyler to come back.\n\nPalahniuk once had an altercation while camping, and though he returned to work bruised and swollen, his co-workers avoided asking him what had happened on the camping trip. Their reluctance to know what happened in his private life inspired him to write \"Fight Club\".\n\nIn 1995, Palahniuk joined a Portland-based writing group that practiced a technique called \"dangerous writing\". This technique, developed by American author Tom Spanbauer, emphasizes the use of minimalist prose, and the use of painful, personal experiences for inspiration. Under Spanbauer's influence, Palahniuk produced an early draft of what would later become his novel \"Invisible Monsters\" (1999), but it was rejected by all publishers he submitted it to. Palahniuk then decided to write an even darker novel, by expanding upon his short story, \"Fight Club\". Initially \"Fight Club\" was published as a seven-page short story in the compilation \"Pursuit of Happiness\" (1995), but Palahniuk expanded it to novel length (in which the original short story became chapter six); \"Fight Club: A Novel\" was published in 1996.\n\n\"Fight Club: A Novel\" was re-issued in 1999 and 2004; the latter edition includes the author's introduction about the conception and popularity of the novel and movie, in which Palahniuk states: \n\n...bookstores were full of books like \"The Joy Luck Club\" and \"The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood\" and \"How to Make an American Quilt\". These were all novels that presented a social model for women to be together. But there was no novel that presented a new social model for men to share their lives.\n\nHe later explains: \n\nReally, what I was writing was just \"The Great Gatsby\" updated a little. It was 'apostolic' fiction—where a surviving apostle tells the story of his hero. There are two men and a woman. And one man, the hero, is shot to death.\n\nOne critic has noted that this essay can be seen as Palahniuk's way of interpreting his own novel. According to this critic, Palahniuk's essay emphasizes the communicative and romantic elements of the novel while it deemphasizes its transgressive elements.\n\nIn interviews, the writer has said he is still approached by people wanting to know the location of the nearest fight club. Palahniuk insists there is no such real organization. He has heard of real fight clubs, some said to have existed before the novel. Project Mayhem is lightly based on The Cacophony Society, of which Palahniuk is a member, and other events derived from stories told to him.\n\n\"Fight Club\"s cultural impact is evidenced by the establishment of fight clubs by teenagers and \"techies\" in the United States. Pranks, such as food-tampering, have been repeated by fans of the book, documented in Palahniuk's essay \"Monkey Think, Monkey Do\", in the book \"\" (2004) and in the introduction to the 2004 re-issue of \"Fight Club.\" Other fans have been inspired to prosocial activity, telling Palahniuk the novel had inspired them to return to college.\n\nIn addition to the feature film, a stage adaptation by Dylan Yates has been performed in Seattle and in Charlotte, North Carolina. In 2004, work began on a musical theater adaptation by Palahniuk, Fincher, and Trent Reznor, to premiere on the film's 10th anniversary. In 2015 the project was still in development, with Julie Taymor having been added to the creative team.\n\nA modern-day everyman figure as well as an employee specializing in recalls for an unnamed car company, the Narrator—who remains unnamed throughout the novel—is extremely depressed and suffers from insomnia. Some readers call him \"Joe\", because of his constant use of the name in such statements as, \"I am Joe's boiling point\". The quotes, \"I am Joe's [blank]\", refer to the Narrator's reading old \"Reader's Digest\" articles in which human organs write about themselves in the first person, with titles such as \"I Am Joe's Liver\". The film adaptation replaces \"Joe\" with \"Jack\", inspiring some fans to call the Narrator \"Jack\". In the novel and film, the Narrator uses various aliases in the support groups. His subconscious is in need of a sense of freedom, he inevitably feels trapped within his own body, and when introduced to Tyler Durden, he begins to see all of the qualities he lacks in himself: \"I love everything about Tyler Durden, his courage, his smarts, and his nerve. Tyler is funny and forceful and independent, and men look up to him and expect him to change their world. Tyler is capable and free, and I am not.\" In the official sequel comic book series also penned by Palahniuk (with art by Cameron Stewart), \"Fight Club 2\", it is revealed that the Narrator has chosen to be identified by the name of Sebastian.\n\n\"Because of his nature\", Tyler works night jobs where he sabotages companies and harms clients. He also steals left-over drained human fat from liposuction clinics to supplement his income through soap making and to create the ingredients for bomb manufacturing, which will be put to work later with his fight club. He is the co-founder of Fight Club, as it was his idea to instigate the fight that led to it. He later launches Project Mayhem, from which he and the members commit various attacks on consumerism. Tyler is blond, according to the Narrator's comment \"in his everything-blond way\". The unhinged but magnetic Tyler becomes the \"villain\" of the novel later in the story. The Narrator refers to Tyler as a free spirit who says, \"Let that which does not matter truly slide.\"\n\nA woman whom the Narrator meets during a support group. The Narrator no longer receives the same release from the groups when he realizes Marla is faking her problems just as he is. After he leaves the groups, he meets her again when she becomes Tyler's lover. Marla is shown to be extremely unkempt, uncaring, and sometimes even suicidal. At times, she shows a softer, more caring side.\n\nThe Narrator meets Bob at a support group for testicular cancer. A former bodybuilder, Bob lost his testicles to cancer caused by the steroids he used to bulk up his muscles. He had to undergo testosterone injections, resulting in increased estrogen. The increased estrogen levels caused him to grow large breasts and to develop a softer voice. Because of his \"bitch tits\", Bob is the only known member who is allowed to wear a shirt. The Narrator befriends Bob and, after leaving the groups, meets him again in fight club. Bob's death later in the story, while carrying out an assignment for Project Mayhem, causes the Narrator to turn against Tyler because the members of Project Mayhem treat it as a trivial matter instead of a tragedy.\nA man who joins Fight Club. He is very loyal to Project Mayhem, laughing at the vandalism he and a group of \"space monkeys\" have caused as their crimes appear on the evening news. Angel Face is considered very beautiful, hence his name. The blond-haired beauty suffers a savage beating at the Narrator's hands during a Fight Club session; the Narrator states that he \"wanted to destroy something beautiful.\" The next time Angel Face is heard of in the novel, he is described as not being quite as beautiful anymore. Whereas in the book it is that excessive beating which triggers the foundation of Project Mayhem (Fight Club no longer being a sufficient outlet), in the movie the beating seems to be caused primarily by the Narrator's jealousy.\n\nAt two points in the novel, the Narrator claims he wants to \"wipe [his] ass with the Mona Lisa\"; a mechanic who joins fight club repeats this to him in one scene. This motif shows his desire for chaos, later explicitly expressed in his urge to \"destroy something beautiful\". Additionally, he mentions at one point, \"Nothing is static. Even the Mona Lisa is falling apart.\" This is most explicitly stated in the scene the mechanic appears in:\n\nKennett further argues that Tyler wants to use this chaos to change history so that \"God's middle children\" will have some historical significance, whether or not this significance is \"damnation or redemption\". This will figuratively return their absent fathers, as judgment by future generations will replace judgment by their fathers.\n\nAfter seeing \"Reader's Digest\" articles written from the perspective of the organs of a man named Joe, the Narrator begins using similar quotations to describe his feelings. He often replaces organs with feelings and things involved in his life (such as \"I am Joe's smirking revenge\").\n\nThe color cornflower blue first appears as the color of the Narrator's boss's tie and later is requested as an icon color by the same boss. Later, it is mentioned that his boss has eyes the same color. These mentions of the color are the first of many uses of cornflower blue in Palahniuk's books.\n\nIsolationism, specifically directed towards material items and possessions, is a common theme throughout the novel. Tyler acts as the major catalyst behind the destruction of our vanities, which he claims is the path to finding our inner selves. \"I'm breaking my attachment to physical power and possessions,\" Tyler whispered, \"because only through destroying myself can I discover the greater power of my spirit.\"\n\nJesse Kavadlo, a professor at Maryville University of St. Louis, argues that the Narrator's opposition to emasculation is a form of projection, and the problem that he fights is himself. He also argues that Palahniuk uses existentialism in the novel to conceal subtexts of feminism and romance, in order to convey these concepts in a novel that is mainly aimed at a male audience. In an essay titled \"\"Fight Club\" and the Disneyfication of Manhood,\" Cameron White and Trenia Walker suggest that Project Mayhem's ultimate goal, through the destruction of financial institutions, is to shatter what society deems \"real\" manhood, reducing manhood to survival instincts. Paul Skinner has also echoed this sentiment, stating, \"the anger and dissatisfaction of the male characters is against one type of masculinity being suppressed by post-industrial consumerist society\". Palahniuk gives a simpler assertion about the theme of the novel, stating \"all my books are about a lonely person looking for some way to connect with other people.\"\n\nPaul Kennett argues that because the Narrator's fights with Tyler are fights with himself, and because he fights himself in front of his boss at the hotel, the Narrator is using the fights as a way of asserting himself as his own boss. These fights are a representation of the struggle of the proletarian at the hands of a higher capitalist power; by asserting himself as capable of having the same power he thus becomes his own master. Later when fight club is formed, the participants are all dressed and groomed similarly, allowing them to symbolically fight themselves at the club and gain the same power.\n\nTyler becomes nostalgic for patriarchal power giving him control and creates Project Mayhem to achieve this. Through this proto-fascist power structure, the Narrator seeks to learn \"what, or rather, who, he might have been under a firm patriarchy.\" Through his position as leader of Project Mayhem, Tyler uses his power to become a \"God/Father\" to the \"space monkeys\" (the other members of Project Mayhem), although by the end of the novel his words hold more power than he does, as is evident in the space monkeys' threat to castrate the Narrator when he contradicts Tyler's rule. According to Kennett, this creates a paradox in that Tyler pushes the idea that men who wish to be free from a controlling father-figure are only self-actualized once they have children and become a father themselves, thus becoming controllers themselves in an endless cycle of patriarchal repression.\n\nJohannes Hell argues that Palahniuk's use of the Narrator's somnambulism is a simple attempt at emphasizing the dangerous yet daring possibilities of life. Hell enforces the importance of the Narrator's sleepwalking and intense deprivation, for they have a firm influence on suffering readers,\" from a twisted perspective this is solace for everybody who suffers from somnambulism in a sense, that things could be worse, much worse in fact.\n\nProject Mayhem's terrorism in \"Fight Club\" has been analyzed within the context of the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001. In 2007, Ruth Quiney examined this link, stating that \"Fight Club\"'s depiction of disaffected Western men joining a homegrown terrorist group anticipated some aspects of the War on Terror\".\" Jesse Kavadlo, in his essay \"With Us or Against Us: Chuck Palahniuk's 9/11,\" claims that Palahniuk was almost prophetic in predicting future acts of terror. He writes, \"Palahniuk's work demonstrates the disturbing intersections between the multiple meanings of the word \"plot\": narrative, conspiratorial, and funereal, the word reminding us of the linguistic connections between our stories, our secrets, and our entombment.\"\n\nAt the time of its publication, \"Fight Club\" was well-received critically. It was called \"brilliantly creepy\" by \"The Washington Post,\" and \"unsettling and nerve-chafing\" by \"The Seattle Times. The Baltimore Sun\" commended its very publication, stating, \"bravo to Norton for having the courage to publish it.\" For many critics, \"Fight Club\" is considered the embodiment of Palahniuk's writing style and thematic concerns.\n\nThe \"forecasts\" section of a 1996 \"Publishers Weekly\" praised the novel: \n\nWriting in an iconic deadpan and including something to offend everyone, Palahniuk is a risky writer who takes chances galore, especially with a particularly bizarre plot twist he throws in late in the book. Caustic, outrageous, bleakly funny, violent, and always unsettling, Palahniuk's utterly original creation will make even the most jaded reader sit up and take notice. \n\nSome critics have condemned \"Fight Club\" because of its violent, heteronormative themes and cult philosophy. Peter Matthews, however, argues that these critics often overlook the novel's ironic critique of its characters' violent worldview.\n\nThe book received critical interest and eventually generated cinematic-adaptation interest. In 1999, screenwriters Jim Uhls, August Olsen, and co-producers Conor Strait and Aaron Curry joined director David Fincher. The film \"failed\" at the box office, but a cult following emerged with the DVD edition and as a result, an original, hardcover edition of the novel is now a collector's item.\n\nFollowing its film adaptation, the novel gained popularity among young, male American readers. Critics have attributed \"Fight Club\"'s popularity with this audience to its critique of an emasculating consumerist culture, and to the implied message that modern men need revert to their primal, aggressive nature. \"The Evening Standard\" said the novel was the origin of the term \"snowflake\". \"I coined 'snowflake' and I stand by it\", Palahniuk said in 2017. \"Every generation gets offended by different things but my friends who teach in high school tell me that their students are very easily offended ... The modern Left is always reacting to things. Once they get their show on the road culturally they will stop being so offended.\"\n\nThe novel won the following awards:\n\nPalahniuk was convinced to continue \"Fight Club\" in comics form by fellow novelist Chelsea Cain and comic writers Brian Michael Bendis, Matt Fraction and Kelly Sue DeConnick.\n\nAt the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con International, Palahniuk announced that a sequel to \"Fight Club\" is in the works and will take the form of a serialized graphic novel. According to Palahniuk, \"It will likely be a series of books that update the story ten years after the seeming end of Tyler Durden. Nowadays, Tyler is telling the story, lurking inside Sebastian, and ready to launch a come-back. Sebastian is oblivious. Marla is bored. Their marriage has run aground on the rocky coastline of middle-aged suburban boredom. It's only when their little boy disappears, kidnapped by Tyler, that Sebastian is dragged back into the world of Mayhem.\" Dark Horse Comics is publishing this new story in a 10-issue maxi series, written by Palahniuk and illustrated by Cameron Stewart, starting in 2015. Artist David W. Mack, who is friends with Palahniuk, will be illustrating the covers for the series and has said of the material, \"The twists and turns are just primo artifacts of Chuck Palahniuk's brain material.\"\n\nA teaser was released by Dark Horse Comics for Free Comic Book Day 2015, with \"Fight Club 2\" #1 following in late May of that year. The series explores Joseph Campbell's concept of the 'second father' as being vital to the hero's journey, which is something that has always fascinated Palahniuk.\n\nOn the \"Orbital In Conversation\" podcast, Chuck stated that he is already working on \"Fight Club 3\", which will also be in comic form. He also confirmed that he is working on a series of original short stories for comics which will appear as one-shots before eventually being collected into a single book.\n\n\"Excursion\" is a short-story prequel to \"Fight Club\", released in Palahniuk's \"Make Something Up: Stories You Can't Unread\".\n\n\n\nFollowing editions of the novel were used as references for this article:\n\n"}
{"id": "406271", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=406271", "title": "Filmi", "text": "Filmi\n\nFilmi (\"of films\") music soundtracks are produced for India's mainstream motion picture industry and written and performed for Indian cinema. In cinema, music directors make up the main body of composers; the songs are performed by playback singers and the genre represents 72% of the music sales market in India.\n\nFilmi music tends to have appeal across India, Nepal and overseas, especially among the Indian diaspora. Songs are often in different languages depending on the target audience, for example in Hindi or Tamil. Playback singers are usually more noted for their ability to sing rather than their charisma as performers. Filmi playback singers level of success and appeal is tied to their involvement with film soundtracks of cinema releases with the highest box office ratings.\n\nAt the \"Filmi Melody: Song and Dance in Indian Cinema\" archive presentation at UCLA, filmi was praised as a generally more fitting term for the tradition than 'Bombay melody' \" suggesting that the exuberant music and melodrama so closely identified with the Hindi commercial cinema produced in Bombay (Mumbai) is truly pan-Indian.\"\n\nIn the earliest years, filmi music was generally Indian (classical Carnatic, Hindustani, and village folk) in inspiration; over the years, Western elements have increased significantly. However, film soundtracks continue to be very diverse, sometimes fusing genres or reverting to entirely classical music. Examples of this can be found throughout the history of filmi music.\n\nR. C. Boral, Harishchandra Bali, Pankaj Mullick, Anil Biswas, Naushad Ali, Khwaja Khurshid Anwar and S. Rajeswara Rao were noteworthy music directors of the 1940s. Rao, who scored the 1948 Tamil \"Chandralekha\", the first all-India hit, continued music directing in Chennai until the 1980s. The 1950s and 1960s, included music composers like Shankar Jaikishan, S. D. Burman, O. P. Nayyar, Madan Mohan, Hemant Kumar, C. Ramchandra, Roshan, Vasant Desai, Kalyanji–Anandji and Khayyam in Hindi film music. K. V. Mahadevan, Vishwanathan-Ramamoorthy, Laxmikant–Pyarelal, G. Devarajan, V. Dakshinamoorthy and M. S. Viswanathan were active music directors for more than 35 years from the 1950s.\n\nAs Indian cinema segued into the 1960s and 1970s, pop artists like R. D. Burman, Bappi Lahiri and duos like Nadeem–Shravan and Jatin–Lalit gave filmi a stronger western flavor with composers Ilaiyaraaja and Raveendran who rose to fame during the 1970s and 1980s in Tamil film music.\n\nMajor musical forces in the 1990s and 2000s have included A. R. Rahman, Nadeem–Shravan, Pritam, Himesh Reshammiya, Harris Jayaraj, Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy, Vishal–Shekhar, Vidyasagar, M. Jayachandran, Yuvan Shankar Raja, Deepak Dev, Johnson, Anu Malik, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Salim–Sulaiman, Devi Sri Prasad etc. A. R. Rahman, who was described by \"Time\" magazine as \"India's most prominent movie songwriter,\" is widely accepted to be the most internationally recognized Indian musician.\n\nA playback singer is a singer who pre-records songs for use in films. The singer records the song and the actors or actresses lip-sync the song in front of the cameras, a form of singing that is characteristic of the Indian subcontinent. The songs of a film, the quality of the music and its music director (composer), lyricist and singer have often determined the success of a film. Film soundtracks are sometimes released before the film itself, resulting in a disparity between the soundtrack and the songs appearing in the film.\n\nKundan Lal Saigal was one of the earliest playback singers in the Indian music industry. Notable playback singers include Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhosle, Mohammed Rafi, Kishore Kumar, Mukesh, S. P. Balasubrahmanyam, K. J. Yesudas, S. Janaki, P. Susheela, K. S. Chithra, Udit Narayan, Alka Yagnik, Kumar Sanu, Sonu Nigam, Shaan, KK , Shreya Ghoshal, Arijit Singh, Mohit Chauhan,Javed Ali and many others.\n\nIn the 1950s and '60s, lyricists like Shailendra, Hasrat Jaipuri, Sahir Ludhianvi, Raja Mehdi Ali Khan, Rajendra Krishan, Majrooh Sultanpuri, Bharat Vyas, Shakeel Badayuni, Qamar Jalalabadi, Anand Bakshi, Jan Nisar Akhtar and S. H. Bihari wrote lyrics of many classic filmi songs. Lyrics tended towards the literary and drew heavily on contemporary Urdu and Hindi poetry. The south has seen poets like Kannadasan, Vairamuthu and Vaali rise to prominence, in Tamil poetry and literature alongside Vayalar Ramavarma, P. Bhaskaran, O. N. V. Kurup in the Malayalam music industry.\n\nBinaca Geetmala, Ameen Sayani's popular Hindi language radio show before satellite television took over in India sometime in the 1990s, gave weekly popularity ratings of Hindi film songs (akin to the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 list of songs). It ran in various incarnations from 1952 to 1993, and annual lists of the most popular songs were played at year-end. The list was compiled on the basis of record sales in India. Currently, Hindi filmi songs are sold on tape and CD compilations, played as promos and in programs on various television channels and radio stations, with different popularity ratings claiming different songs as being on the top. In an annual exercise, a net-based effort RMIM Puraskaar lists all important Hindi film songs of the year, in addition to awarding songs for various categories.\n\nBecause popular music directors score a great many films over the course of a year, accusations of plagiarizing abound. For example, one production number in \"Dil\" (1990) is based on Carl Perkins' \"Blue Suede Shoes\", sung with Hindi lyrics. Of late the Indian film industry has been gaining visibility outside India, and the legal risks of plagiarism have been gaining importance. Some producers have actually paid for the musical rights to popular Western songs, as in \"Kal Ho Naa Ho\"'s (2003) song, \"Oh, Pretty Woman\". Plagiarism has also existed within India, with several music directors in Bombay cinema lifting tunes from other \"regional\" industries.\n\nThere have also been accusations of plagiarism against foreigner musicians borrowing from Hindi filmi songs. For example, \"Don't Phunk with My Heart\" by The Black Eyed Peas was largely based on two 1970s filmi songs: \"Ye Mera Dil Yaar Ka Diwana\" from \"Don\" (1978) and \"Ae Naujawan Hai Sab Kuchh Yahan\" from \"Apradh\" (1972). Both songs were originally composed by Kalyanji Anandji and sung by Asha Bhosle. Another example is \"Addictive\" sung by Truth Hurts, which is lifted from Lata Mangeshkar's \"Thoda Resham Lagta Hai\" from \"Jyoti\" (1981). This led to the copyright holders of the original song filing a lawsuit against DJ Quik and Dr. Dre, the producers of \"Addictive\". \"Filmi\" music composed by A. R. Rahman (who would later win two Academy Awards for the \"Slumdog Millionaire\" soundtrack) has frequently been sampled by musicians elsewhere in the world, including the Singaporean artist Kelly Poon, the Uzbek artist Iroda Dilroz, the French rap group La Caution, the American artist Ciara, and the German band Löwenherz, among others.\n\nFilmi is also making converts and exerting influence beyond the usual Desi audiences, with many Western music stores today carrying Indian music compilations. As early as 1978, the synthpop pioneers Haruomi Hosono and Ryuichi Sakamoto of the Yellow Magic Orchestra produced an electronic album \"Cochin Moon\" based on an experimental fusion between electronic music and Bollywood-inspired Indian music. Later in 1988, Devo's hit song \"Disco Dancer\" was inspired by the song \"I am a Disco Dancer\" from the Bollywood film \"Disco Dancer\" (1982).\n\nBaz Luhrmann showcases the song \"Chamma Chamma\" from \"China Gate\" (1998) in his 2001 movie \"Moulin Rouge\". Another 2001 film \"Ghost World\" featured Mohammed Rafi's song \"Jaan Pehechan Ho\" from the 1965 film \"Gumnaam\". The 2002 song \"Addictive\", sung by Truth Hurts and produced by DJ Quik and Dr. Dre, was lifted from Lata Mangeshkar's \"Thoda Resham Lagta Hai\" from \"Jyoti\" (1981). The Black Eyed Peas' Grammy Award winning 2005 song \"Don't Phunk with My Heart\" was inspired by two 1970s Bollywood songs: \"Ye Mera Dil Yaar Ka Diwana\" from \"Don\" (1978) and \"Ae Naujawan Hai Sab Kuchh Yahan\" from \"Apradh\" (1972). Both songs were originally composed by Kalyanji Anandji, sung by Asha Bhosle, and featured the dancer Helen. The songs \"Mera Man Tera Pyasa\" from the movie \"Gambler\" (1971) performed by Mohammed Rafi, \"Tere Sang Pyar Main\" from the movie \"Nagin\" (1976) performed by Lata Mangeshkar, and \"Wada Na Tod\" also by Lata Mangeshkar from the movie \"Dil Tujhko Diya\" (1987) were featured in \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" (2004). Scores from Chennai Tamil films have appeared in productions such as \"Lord of War\" (2005) and \"The Accidental Husband\" (2008). Ilaiyaraaja won the Gold Remi Award for Best Music Score jointly with film composer M. S. Viswanathan at the WorldFest-Houston Film Festival for the Tamil film \"Vishwa Thulasi\" (2005).\n\nA. R. Rahman rose to fame from the Chennai film industry to become one of the most popular international music directors and has had a musical\"Bombay Dreams\", playing in London and New York, and scored several projects outside India. He has won two Academy awards and two Grammy awards, even numerous international awards and accolades. The song \"Chaiyya Chaiyya\", originally composed by A. R. Rahman for \"Dil Se..\" (1998), has also been well received around the world, making several top 10 world music lists and has even been featured in several American movies. The song was in both the opening scene and credits of Spike Lee's \"Inside Man\". Rahman's earlier soundtrack for \"Roja\" (1991) was included in TIME's 10 Best Soundtracks of all time in 2005. He has been regarded as the only composer from India to attain massive popularity and fame in the international arena. Hindi filmi music has reached an even wider global audience due to the success of the \"Slumdog Millionaire\" soundtrack, also composed by Rahman.\n\nThe first domain name ever registered related to Filmi Music and Indian Entertainment media was indiamusic.com. The site further put Filmi music on the map. Thereafter followed a flood of Indian and Filmi Music sites.\n\n"}
{"id": "45049304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45049304", "title": "Fire Emblem Fates", "text": "Fire Emblem Fates\n\nFire Emblem Fates is a tactical role-playing video game for the Nintendo 3DS handheld video game console, developed by Intelligent Systems and Nintendo SPD and published by Nintendo. It was released in June 2015 in Japan, then released internationally in 2016. It is the fourteenth game in the \"Fire Emblem\" series, and the second to be developed for Nintendo 3DS after \"Fire Emblem Awakening\". \"Fates\" was released in three versions, each following a different storyline centered around the same characters: Birthright and Conquest as physical releases, and Revelation as downloadable content.\n\nThe overarching story follows the protagonist, a customizable Avatar created by the player, as they are unwillingly drawn into a war between the Kingdoms of Hoshido (their birthplace) and Nohr (their adopted home), and must choose which side to support. In \"Revelation\", the Avatar rallies both sides against the true mastermind behind the war. The gameplay, which revolves around tactical movement of units across a grid-based battlefield, shares many mechanics with previous \"Fire Emblem\" games, although some elements are unique to each scenario.\n\nAfter the critical and commercial success of \"Awakening\", development began on \"Fates\", with the staff of \"Awakening\" returning to their previous roles. The team's main concern was adding new features and refinements to the original gameplay, and improving the story, which had received criticism from some fans. To this end, writer Shin Kibayashi was brought in. To show all sides of the story and provide players with different \"Fire Emblem\" experiences, the game was split up into multiple versions. Upon release, it met with highly positive reviews: \"Birthright\" was generally seen as a good starting place for new players, \"Conquest\" was praised for its challenge, while \"Revelation\" was noted as a good middle ground between the two releases.\n\nIn \"Fire Emblem Fates\", the player begins by customizing the main character. Their gender, appearance, and name can be changed to the player's preference. At the game's beginning, there are three difficulties: Normal, Hard, and Lunatic. There are also modes that dictate the fate of characters in battle should they be defeated. In Classic Mode, a fallen unit is subject to permanent death, a recurring mode in the \"Fire Emblem\" series that removes fallen characters from the rest of the game. Casual Mode enables units to be revived at the end of a battle. The new Phoenix mode revives units on the following player turn. Each version of \"Fates\" is focused around a different gameplay style. The gameplay of \"Birthright\" is similar to the prior installment \"Fire Emblem Awakening\" and features opportunities to gain extra gold and experience. In contrast, \"Conquest\" rewards players limited experience and currency per completed map. Also included are additional objectives in battle such as defending a base or suppressing enemy forces, and some levels have a limited number of turns. \"Revelation\" uses a mixture of elements from \"Birthright\" and \"Conquest\": while offering opportunities for gold and experience as with \"Birthright\", it provides varied objectives and strategic elements similar to \"Conquest\".\n\nA new feature introduced to the series is \"My Castle\", in which the player is able to create a base for their army, where they can establish shops, buy weapons and items, and interact with allied characters. Shops can be leveled up, which allows the player to choose from a wider range of items to buy. Players can run a farm in their base, allowing them to make food. At the restaurant in the base, they can serve food, which will grant characters who eat it positive effects; however, some foods can also have negative effects. The player's personal quarters are also located here; the player can use them to interact with detailed models of other characters and the Avatar's spouse (if applicable). Players are able to visit other players' bases using the StreetPass functionality of the Nintendo 3DS. During a visit, they can fight the other player's army, buy items, and recruit characters. As different items are available in the two versions of the game, this allows players access to items that normally would be unavailable.\n\nBattles take place on a grid-based battlefield, with turns being given for players and enemies. During an attack, the view transitions from a top-down perspective to a third-person view. Environments and terrain vary between levels, ranging from mountainous regions to flatlands. A unique ability members of each kingdom's royal family have is the ability to use Dragon Veins, which are special map tiles that enable them to alter the environment in favor of their side. Like previous games in the series, \"Fire Emblem Fates\" features a \"weapon triangle\" – a system where certain weapons have advantages over others. However, in \"Fates\" the triangle differs from previous installments, with swords and magic defeating axes and bows, axes and bows besting lances and hidden weapons, and lances and hidden weapons overpowering swords and magic. Weapons in \"Fates\" do not have a limited number of uses before they break; instead, stronger weapons will lower some of the user's abilities. For instance, while the Brave Sword allows its user to attack twice, it also lowers their defense and magic defense stats.\n\nUnits are assigned a unique character class: in battle, each unit's usable weapon types and range of movement are pre-determined by their class. Each character begins the game with a starting class: the main protagonist begins as a Nohr Prince/Princess, while Azura begins as a Songstress. The classes of each version of \"Fates\" are also distinct from each other, drawing from their respective nation's aesthetics. Using special items known as \"Seals\", classes can be evolved or changed: effects of various Seals range from upgrading a character's class, changing class completely, raising their experience level, or altering their stats. Character relationships are developed during and between battle, also known as Support, which can be viewed in conversations via the Support menu outside of battle. Battling with an adjacent or paired-up unit gives advantages, such as blocking an attack or attacking alongside the currently controlled unit. Outside battle, relationships between characters can be fostered to the point of marriage and children. These children's appearance and abilities are determined by their parents. Using a particular Seal, child characters can also take on additional skills from parents.\n\nThe game features online multiplayer. Having five maps as standard, matches can be carried out with select players, random players, or through local multiplayer. Random battles are played either with standard rules, or with special limitations. The Fog of War environmental effect is removed, and turns have limits of five minutes. In addition, \"Fates\" features Amiibo support, with compatible figurines being characters from earlier \"Fire Emblem\" games: when scanned, the character represented by a figurine will appear within My Castle, and after talking with them three times they can be fought in battle. When defeated, they become allies that join the main campaign. Talking with them prior to the fight gives the Avatar themed items, such as the mask of \"Fire Emblem Awakening\"s Lucina. Amiibo functions are unlocked after the narrative splits and My Castle is unlocked.\n\n\"Fates\" is primarily set in the territories of the kingdoms of Hoshido and Nohr. Their royalty share a similar line of descent from ancient dragons, but each kingdom worships different dragon deities, and so exist in a state of war. Little do they know that there is also another dragon deity; the dragon Anankos, ruler of the kingdom of Valla. This realm is located under the Bottomless Canyon which separates Hoshido and Nohr. Anankos has usurped the throne of Valla and is intentionally provoking war between the two kingdoms. In the \"Hidden Truths\" DLC, it is revealed that Anankos was formerly a kind dragon who gave wisdom to humanity, but his growing power and inability to ascend to the spirit realm with the world's other dragons began corrupting him. After he killed Valla's king in an uncontrolled fit of bestial rage, he finally went mad: his remaining sanity and kindness took temporary shelter in a human form and fathered the Avatar before dying, while his dragon self began an insane crusade to destroy humanity.\n\nThe central character is the Avatar, named Corrin by default, (voiced by Cam Clarke, Yuri Lowenthal, Stephanie Lemelin, Marcella Lentz-Pope or Danielle Judovits), whose name, gender, and appearance can be customized by the player. A member of the Hoshidan royal family, they were captured by Nohr at a young age. They have the unique ability of transforming into a dragon. The other central character is Azura (voiced by Rena Strober), a member of the Nohrian royal family who was kidnapped by Hoshido as part of their efforts to rescue the Avatar. Holding power over water, she is one of the companions to join the Avatar in whichever story route they choose. The main characters among the Hoshidan royal family include the Avatar's siblings Ryoma (voiced by Matthew Mercer), Takumi (voiced by Roger Rose), Hinoka (voiced by Elizabeth Daily), and Sakura (voiced by Brianna Knickerbocker). Ryoma and Takumi wield the Legendary Weapons of Hoshido, the Raijinto katana and the Fujin Yumi. The main characters from the Nohrian kingdom include the Avatar's guardian, Gunter (voiced by D. C. Douglas), and their adoptive siblings Xander (voiced by David Stanbra), Camilla (voiced by Paula Tiso), Leo (voiced by Max Mittelman), and Elise (voiced by Natalie Lander). Xander and Leo respectively wield the Legendary Weapons of Nohr: the sword Siegfried and the tome Brynhildr. Other characters include the Avatar's mother, Queen Mikoto of Hoshido (voiced by Marisha Ray); King Garon of Nohr (voiced by Travis Willingham); Sumeragi (voiced by David Stanbra), the former king of Hoshido and husband of Mikoto; and Anankos (voiced by Travis Willingham in his dragon form and Cam Clarke in human form), the dragon ruler of Valla and blood father of the Avatar.\n\nSeveral years prior to the start of the game, Hoshido's King Sumeragi is ambushed by Nohr's King Garon during a fake peace treaty talk between the nations and is killed. King Garon kidnaps Sumeragi's young child, the Avatar, and decides to raise them to serve his purposes. Meanwhile, back in Hoshido, without their king, Sumeragi's wife Mikoto becomes the new ruler of the kingdom.\n\nAfter coming of age, the Avatar is sent by Garon to inspect a Hoshidan fortress above the Bottomless Canyon. However, one of Garon's men, Hans, provokes a battle with the Hoshidans and throws the Avatar's mentor Gunter into the Canyon. The Avatar is found and captured by Hoshidan soldiers, who recognize them as a long-lost member of the Hoshidan royal family. The Avatar is brought to meet their blood relatives and Azura at the capital city. However, soldiers attack the city and a hooded assassin attempts to kill the Avatar. Mikoto shields them at the cost of her life. In the aftermath, the Avatar comes into possession of a legendary sword called Yato, said to belong to the one who will save the world. In the opening battle between the two kingdoms, the Avatar's two families meet, and the Avatar is forced to choose between siding with Hoshido and Nohr. In the \"Birthright\" and \"Conquest\" routes, the Avatar chooses either their biological or adopted family, respectively. This causes them to be denounced by the other side, and they are gradually forced to fight them.\n\nIn the \"Birthright\" route, the Avatar helps their Hoshidan kin defend their country from invasion by Nohr. After confrontations with the Avatar, Camilla and Leo's lives are spared. With the help of Elise and Shura, the man who kidnapped Azura from Nohr, the Avatar and their company invade the Nohrian capital. Elise is killed when she attempts to stop the Avatar and Xander from fighting, and Xander falls into despair and forces the Avatar to kill him. The Avatar then faces Garon, killing him with the Yato after it is infused with added power from Ryoma and Takumi's Legendary Weapons. However, Azura dies after having overused her singing powers to weaken Garon. In the epilogue, Ryoma is crowned king of Hoshido and Leo is crowned king of Nohr, and peace is forged between the two kingdoms.\n\nIn the \"Conquest\" route, the Avatar both fights in the war against Hoshido, and works with their adoptive family to change Nohr's brutal reputation from within. After Azura reveals that King Garon has been replaced by an impostor, the Avatar decides to have Garon sit upon the magical throne of Hoshido, which will remove the false Garon's disguise. During the invasion of Hoshido, the Nohrians spare Hinoka and capture Sakura, while Takumi, whose behavior has become increasingly erratic and violent throughout the war, apparently dies by jumping off of a rampart. Garon orders the Avatar to kill Ryoma. After their fight, Ryoma spares the Avatar the pain of killing their own brother by killing himself. Infusing the Yato with the power of Xander and Leo's Legendary Weapons, the Avatar confronts and kills the false Garon. However, a crazed Takumi suddenly appears and attacks them, and it is revealed he has been long dead and his body is possessed. The Avatar destroys Takumi's body to free his soul. Azura overuses her powers as in the \"Birthright\" route, but her death is not seen and she is instead marked as missing. In the epilogue, Hinoka is crowned queen of Hoshido and Xander is crowned king of Nohr, and a peaceful alliance between the two kingdoms is formed.\n\nIn the \"Revelation\" route, the Avatar rejects both Hoshido and Nohr, and is denounced as a traitor by both. They flee with Azura and one of their retainers through the Bottomless Canyon to the kingdom of Valla. Azura explains that the king of Valla, the dragon Anankos, has plans for humanity's destruction; he is the one who killed and replaced Garon, and he is responsible for Takumi's descent into madness in the \"Conquest\" route. Azura also reveals her history as the daughter of the king Anankos usurped, and that a curse placed by Anankos will kill them if they reveal Valla's existence to anyone outside its borders. The two decide to kill Anankos. Fleeing Valla with Gunter, who survived his fall into the chasm, Azura reveals that they must unite the Avatar's twin families before a natural event which will seal the passage for decades. The Avatar travels through Hoshido and Nohr, gradually gaining the trust and allegiance of their hereditary and adopted families. They also learn that their sword Yato is the \"Seal of Flames\", which when combined with the other families' Legendary Weapons will become the Fire Emblem, capable of killing Ananakos. Once the group enter Valla, the party heads to confront Anankos. During their journey, they battle the resurrected bodies of Mikoto, Azura's mother Arete, and Sumeragi, the latter of whom is revealed to be Mikoto's assassin. During their battle with Mikoto, the Avatar learns that they and Azura are maternal cousins, making the Avatar heir to Valla's throne. The group is eventually betrayed by Gunter, who was possessed by Anankos since first coming to Valla, but the Avatar succeeds in freeing Gunter from Anankos' control. When they face Anankos, they are initially helpless, but Ryoma, Takumi, Xander, and Leo feed the power of their Legendary Weapons into Yato, transforming it into the Fire Emblem. Near death after being defeated, Anankos summons and eats the impostor Garon to regain his strength, but is finally destroyed with the Fire Emblem. In the aftermath, Valla is reestablished on the surface, Azura crowns the Avatar its new ruler, and an everlasting peace is established between the three kingdoms.\n\nPaid additional content was released alongside the games, in the form of extra levels used to improve the units' strength or gather exclusive resources. A series of additional storylines were also released to expand on the main narrative. The first is \"Before Awakening\", in which the Avatar is transported to Ylisse, the setting of \"Fire Emblem Awakening\", and aids its heroes Chrom, Frederick, and Lissa in fighting off the forces of Valla. The second, \"Hidden Truths\", centers around \"Awakening\" characters Owain, Inigo, and Severa as they are contacted by a mysterious figure who asks for their help in saving Valla. To this end, they are given new powers and names: Odin, Laslow, and Selena. The trio ultimately join with the kingdom of Nohr as retainers.\n\nThe \"Heirs of Fate\" saga, released after the rest of the DLC, focuses around the game's child units. Two separate versions of the Avatar's child Kana, one male and one female, each journey with members of each version's cast to discover why a group of mysterious soldiers attacked their homes. It is revealed that they were never truly in their homes, as Anankos had transported them to Valla and attempted to trick them into killing each other. However, Azura's son, Shigure, breaks the illusion and bands the two Kanas' armies together, only to leave them to face Anankos alone with the hidden verse of his mother's song. However, the army finds a way back, and helps to defeat Anankos one final time.\n\nThe previous title in the series, \"Fire Emblem Awakening\", was planned to be the last in the series due to decreasing sales. The game was a worldwide commercial success, prompting Nintendo to greenlight a new entry. \"Fates\" was co-developed by regular \"Fire Emblem\" developer Intelligent Systems and Nintendo SPD, with the main staff of \"Awakening\" returning to their respective roles for \"Fates\": they were Intelligent Systems's Kouhei Maeda as director, Nintendo SPD director Genki Yokota, Nintendo producer Hitoshi Yamagami, art director Toshiyuki Kusakihara, and character designer Yūsuke Kozaki. Yokota's work on the game ran parallel with his work on \"Xenoblade Chronicles X\". Masahiro Higuchi, \"Awakening\"s project manager, came on board as a producer. According to the original staff, the request for a sequel was a shock as they had all developed \"Awakening\" assuming it would be the last in the series. During its early design stages, \"Fates\" was given the working title \"Fire Emblem 3DS II\". The game's cutscenes were animated by Studio Anima, while storyboarding was handled by Spooky Graphic. To develop the multiple versions, one core team worked on the game's shared assets, while additional teams handled individual level design.\n\nThe gameplay was refined and expanded from the version they used in \"Awakening\". The My Castle feature was suggested by Maeda as an alternative activity for players, and to provide a means for getting to know the main characters outside battle. The amount of content included in the feature made some staff comment that it could be its own game. The social elements of My Castle were originally going to be exclusive to StreetPass, but it was suggested that players in areas with low StreetPass activity should be able to access the functions through a normal Internet connection. Some ideas thought up by Maeda for earlier titles, such as the Dragon Vein ability and the way skills were inherited by second generation characters, were also implemented. Due to the necessity for multiple versions, map designing became a larger task than anticipated, with very few maps being shared between versions. The Phoenix Mode was included to bring new fans into the series, a philosophy that they had neglected up until \"Awakening\" and improved for \"Fates\". For the first time in the \"Fire Emblem\" series, the option for the main character to marry a character of the same sex was included: the potential male and female partners respectively appear in \"Conquest\" and \"Birthright\", and both appear in \"Revelation\". According to Nintendo, this move was done to reflect the diversity of their player base.\n\nThe two kingdoms were based upon different cultures: Hoshido was themed after Japan, while Nohr used a Medieval European setting similar to earlier \"Fire Emblem\" games. The kingdoms of Hoshido and Nohr were designed to contrast each other in a variety of ways, with the most obvious being its architecture: Hoshido was themed around light and air, while Nohr was themed around darkness and stone. When development first started, the team unanimously decided to ask Kozaki to return as character designer, as he had been for \"Awakening\". The sheer number of characters this approach entailed made the staff worry about whether Kozaki would be willing to return. The Hoshido characters' clothing were influenced by Japanese culture and character designs drew inspiration from well-known people in Japan: a main instance was Ryoma, whose clothing was based on samurai, including historical figures such as Takeda Shingen, along with incorporating animal motifs such as lions. The colors used in their clothing were varied and mainly bright to emphasize the country's focus on light. For Nohr, a \"vampire-like taste\" equivalent to dark fantasy was used to highlight it as a kingdom where the sun did not shine. Kozaki used black and purple as key colors in character designs to create a cold and unified image. The nobility of Nohr were given similar design elements to represent their familial connections. The first character Kozaki designed was the Avatar. Kozaki did not put much thought into their general appearance, but took care about their clothing so that it was not overtly styled after either Hoshido or Nohr, keeping the neutrality of the player up to the main story decision point. They were given bare feet due to the animalistic impression Kozaki had after hearing of their strong ties to dragons, along with creating a \"hook\" for players equivalent to other characters in the game. The main key artwork, showing the two families together, was described by Kozaki as \"a pain to draw\" due to their clashing designs, and was the point of much discussion by staff before it was finalized. Azura was not included in artwork for the two physical editions, but she was more prominently presented in artwork surrounding \"Revelation\" as she played a much larger role in the story.\n\nDuring the initial planning stage, the team reviewed how fans and critics had responded to \"Awakening\". While the gameplay and graphics were positively received, the story had been criticized for being too simple by some long-time fans, even though new players approved of it. To that end, they decided to write a story that would appeal to series veterans as well as newcomers. The concept of the story changing depending on which protagonists the main character sided with, originated from Yamagami's memories of the , which allowed for choosing different protagonists but did not change the story. Wanting to play from both sides of a conflict and show both sides as neither good nor evil, the team decided to create multiple versions of the game. Initially, the plan was just for a choice between one kingdom or the other, but Yamagami wanted a neutral path where neither side was chosen, so a third version of the game was planned. The game's Japanese title, \"\"If\", came from the sheer number of choices featured for players in the game. The English title \"Fates\"\" referred to the concept of the main character shaping and changing their fate by choosing a side. After the creation of the three storylines, the team needed to make the decision to divide \"Birthright\" and \"Conquest\" into separate physical releases. This was because packaging them as a single release would have necessitated raising the game's price to the equivalent of a two-game bundle, which would not benefit people who wanted to play one single version. Another reason for this decision was how easy it had become to add the other versions on as cheaper downloadable content (DLC). This opened up the option for players to run through the game until the crucial decision point in Chapter 6, then buy the alternate routes as downloadable content so they had different choices. Each route was estimated to have the same amount of gameplay and story content as \"Awakening\".\n\nAs the plans for three different versions of the game appeared, the staff realized that it was impossible to write three storylines in-house. After searching through known video game writers, they decided to consider writers in other fields. The writer suggested by Maeda was Shin Kibayashi, who was famous in Japan for his work on multiple manga and television series. Kibayashi was initially approached by Kozaki through their shared editor, and was pitched the project by the staff in December 2012. Kibayashi was going to refuse the project as he had a tight work schedule, but after both he and his daughter played through a copy of \"Awakening\" provided by staff, Kibayashi decided to accept and wrote an initial draft story. Despite his initial minimal commitment of a ten-page summary for each storyline, he became fond of the characters and felt that 10 pages were not enough, and thus the full summary for \"Birthright\" extended to about 500 pages. After delivering his work, he then wrote summaries of equal length for \"Conquest\" and \"Revelation\", driven by the need to create a high-quality story, partially to surpass his daughter's pressuring expectations, and ended up writing enough script to fill two books. While the Japanese titles for \"Birthright\" and \"Conquest\" were written in kanji, the third storyline's title was written in katakana to distinguish it from the other two. A great deal of the character traits for the royals of Hoshido and Nohr were contributed by Kibayashi. After he had done his work on the storylines, other writers took over much of the rest of the work. The main scenario writer for the \"Revelation\" storyline was Yukinori Kitajima, a writer associated with the \"Senran Kagura\" series. He and other staff from his company Synthese also wrote the support conversations for \"Birthright\" and \"Conquest\". One of the principal writers for all three story routes was Nami Komuro, who had previously worked on \"Awakening\".\n\nThe game's soundtrack was created by multiple composers. Intelligent System's Hiroki Morishita and T's Music's Rei Kondoh previously worked on \"Awakening\", while \"WarioWare\" composers Takeru Kanazaki and Yasuhisa Baba of Intelligent Systems, and \"Monster Hunter\" composer Masato Kouda of Design Wave joined the team as newcomers. Longtime series composer Yuka Tsujiyoko acted as a supervisor. Morishita and Kanazaki wrote the majority of the game's tracks. Arrangements were handled by Morishita, Kanazaki, Kondoh and Kouda. Many of Tsujiyoko's tracks for earlier \"Fire Emblem\" titles were remixed for use in \"Fates\".\n\nThe game's theme song, \"Lost in Thoughts All Alone\", was written by Morishita, with lyrics by Maeda, and sung by Japanese pop singer Renka, who also provided Azura's in-game singing voice. The developers were looking for a singer who could do justice to their vision for the character, and when they heard Renka's audition, they instantly decided that she was right for the role. According to music personnel, several among them cried when they first heard her performance. Multiple versions were used throughout the soundtrack. Azura's normal voice work is performed by Japanese voice actress Lynn. In the English version, Azura's speaking and singing voice were provided by Rena Strober. The lyrics were adapted into English by Audrey Drake.\n\nAn official soundtrack album, \"Fire Emblem if Official Soundtrack\", released on April 27, 2016 through the Symphony No. 5 label of Tablier Communications. The album contains seven discs of music from all three versions of \"Fates\", and a booklet featuring commentary from the composers. Also included is a special DVD containing remixes of tracks from both \"Fates\" and previous \"Fire Emblem\" games, high-definition versions of the three opening cinematics, and cutscenes from \"Birthright\" and \"Conquest\" featuring alternate versions of a dance sequence with Azura. The soundtrack, having eight disks in total, is one of the largest single game official soundtracks ever released. \"Lost in Thoughts All Alone\", Renka's debut single, was released as a regular CD edition and a special DVD edition featuring a music video on July 1, 2015. It was also included as part of the main soundtrack release.\n\n\"Fates\" was announced for all regions via a Nintendo Direct broadcast in January 2015. It was announced in Japan as \"Fire Emblem if\". Its English title was revealed during Electronic Entertainment Expo 2015. \"Fates\" was released in multiple versions. \"Birthright\" and \"Conquest\" both received a physical release on June 25, 2015 in Japan, which was announced for a 2016 release in the west. Players who purchase a physical copy of either version can download the other version as DLC for a smaller price. \"Revelation\" was released exclusively as downloadable content on July 9, two weeks after the physical release of \"Fates\". In addition to the standard releases was a special edition giving access to \"Conquest\", \"Birthright\" and \"Revelation\". The western release also follows the release pattern used in Japan. In North America, the physical versions were released first in February, with the third storyline coming later as DLC in March. In Europe, the physical editions were released on May 20, with \"Revelation\" following as DLC on June 9. A special edition, containing all three storylines and an art book, was made available in both regions alongside the initial physical releases. In Australia, the physical versions launched on May 21, while \"Revelation\" launched on June 10.\n\nThe Japanese release was promoted by a \"Fire Emblem\" themed trading card game and a \"Awakening\" themed manga. Two \"starter packs\" for the trading cards come with codes that allow players access to the characters Marth and Lucina in the game in the form of DLC. Similarly, the \"booster box\" will come with a code for the character Minerva. The game also supports \"Fire Emblem\" amiibo created for \"Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U\", with the characters associated with the figures appearing in the game as combatants in My Castle. Defeating them enables them to be recruited as characters. A special New Nintendo 3DS changeable cover based on \"Fates\" was released in Japan alongside the game's physical release. After release, a manga based on the game was announced, beginning serialization in the September issue of \"Monthly Young Magazine\". It is written by Kibayashi and illustrated by Kozaki. To promote the game internationally, the Avatar of \"Fates\", under the name Corrin, was added as a playable character via downloadable content to \"Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U\" in February 2016. After release, multiple DLC maps were released between July and September 2015: these ranged from story-related maps to optional maps featuring characters from other \"Fire Emblem\" games. This DLC was released between February and April 2016 in North America. In Europe, the DLC launched between mid May and late July.\n\nThe game's localization was done by Nintendo's localization branch Nintendo Treehouse. The game underwent alterations for its western release: in the Japanese version, a support conversation between the male avatar and a character named Soleil was criticized for elements some deemed similar to gay conversion therapy. In the western release, these elements were removed from the characters' support conversations to avoid causing controversy. Elements of a mini-game exclusive to the My Castle area, involving \"petting\" a chosen character's face on the lower touch screen to build up affection, was also removed from the western versions. While the 2D interactions and the support increases were present, the stylus-based touch screen element was removed. The option for Japanese voiceovers, present in \"Awakening\", was also removed from \"Fates\". According to an official statement by Nintendo, other unspecified changes were also made where it was deemed necessary. These changes, among others pointed out through comparisons by fans between the English and Japanese versions, generated controversy over the Internet in the wake of the game's release, culminating in complaints being sent directly to Nintendo. It also prompted a group dubbed \"Team If\" to start work on a more faithful fan translation, though it was ultimately cancelled shortly after the game's official release.\n\nThe different versions of \"Fates\" received high scores on aggregate site Metacritic. \"Birthright\" scored 86/100 based on sixteen critic reviews. \"Conquest\" received a slightly higher score of 88/100, again based on sixteen reviews. \"Revelation\" scored 89/100 based on five reviews. Reviews for all versions of \"Fates\" generated a score of 88/100 based on seventeen reviews. \"Famitsu\", which reviewed both physical versions in tandem, praised them for their drama and characters, despite noting that the inter-character relations of the two versions were complicated, and only playing one side of the story might leave players unsatisfied. They praised the various battle functions, relationship mechanics and easy-to-use interface. The \"My Castle\" feature, while starting out as feeling incomplete, was a satisfying experience. Martin Robinson of Eurogamer praised the game as a sound continuation of the mechanical improvements of \"Awakening\": he positively noted the grey morality of the characters and story, and singled out \"Conquest\" as the \"cooler\" of the two physical versions due to its challenge and cast. His main criticism was its multi-part release, which he called \"needlessly convoluted\" and stated might alienate fans attracted to the series by \"Awakening\". He also faulted Nintendo's translation work as less \"characterful\" than the localization of \"Awakening\" by 8-4, along with the \"clumsy\" removal of the Japanese original's petting mechanic.\n\nChris Carter of Destructoid called \"Birthright\"s story \"relatively open and shut\" despite keeping complex character relationships intact, while generally citing it as the best starting place for series newcomers. Javy Gwaltney of \"Game Informer\" called the story of \"Birthright\" \"a surprisingly dark tale\", praised the improvements made to the gameplay over \"Awakening\", and was overall positive despite some criticism of its poor tutorial systems. He also liked the game's music and graphics, although he critiqued the latter a little due to low-res battle models. Meghan Sullivan of IGN called the story, music and visuals \"great\", and greatly enjoyed the gameplay systems despite mission repetition and a slow online interface. Alexa Ray Corriea of GameSpot greatly enjoyed the changes to gameplay and its strategy despite little variation in playable maps, and enjoyed the character interactions while noting that the dialogue became overly melodramatic in places. Kimberley Keller of Nintendo World Report, reviewing all versions of the game, generally praised the game as a whole while calling \"Birthright\" the \"perfect way to start [\"Fates\"]\" due to its traditional \"Fire Emblem\" elements. Griffin McElroy and Allegra Frank of Polygon, reviewing all versions of the game, were generally positive about the gameplay and the interplay between versions, while criticizing the overly complicated character class system. They referred to \"Birthright\" as a \"straightforward march for vengeance, where victory almost always entails defeating an entire platoon or its leader\". Both Connor Sheridan of GamesRadar and Ray Carsillo of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" shared many points of praise with other reviewers about the general gameplay: Sheriden called \"Birthright\" a familiar experience when compared to the other titles, while Carsillo recommended it as a good starting point.\n\nCarter found \"Conquest\" a much tougher experience from a gameplay perspective, being geared towards dedicated tactical battles within pre-set limits, while finding its story more intriguing than that of \"Birthright\". Gwaltney called \"Conquest\" a \"dark fantasy epic\" that asked difficult moral questions, and generally cited the gameplay as harder and consequently more rewarding than that of its counterparts despite sharing tutorial deficiencies with \"Birthright\". He also shared his opinions on the music and graphics with \"Birthright\". Jose Otero, writing for IGN, frequently noted the game's challenge, while generally sharing his praises with Sullivan's review of \"Birthright\", including slow online elements. A point of praise not shared with \"Birthright\" was its mission variety. Peter Brown, reviewing the game for GameSpot, praised the gameplay variety and the characters' development and meaningful use in battle, while critiquing the plot for being \"fairly middle of the road\" and did not like the lack of optional side missions. Keller noted the harder gameplay structure of \"Conquest\", while noting that its story had a far more comedic tone with its characters. McElroy and Frank referred to \"Conquest\" as the more challenging of the two physical releases, an opinion shared by Carsillo and Sheridan: the latter added that the game would not make players feel like a hero. Robinson called \"Conquest\" the \"cooler\" of the two physical releases, noting its steeper challenge and more engaging cast.\n\nCarter considered \"Revelation\" to be a good middle ground between \"Birthright\" and \"Conquest\", and praised its story after moving beyond the conceit of its premise. Corriae was highly positive about the game: while finding the initial premise rather contrived, she greatly enjoyed the resultant drama and found the story better than that of \"Birthright\" and \"Conquest\". She also praised the game for its gameplay and variety. Keller said the story of \"Revelation\" \"keeps players on their toes\", while praised the gameplay for finding a middle ground between the two physical releases. She called it \"a fulfilling conclusion\" to \"Fates\". While generally positive about the game as a whole, Sheridan was rather critical of the fact that players needed to buy \"Revelation\" as DLC to get the whole story. Gwaltney was less favorable than he was about \"Birthright\" and \"Conquest\": while he enjoyed the early tension of a limited party, the ability to expand and strengthen the party sapped away the tension, while he found the story \"rather ho-hum and generic\" after the more impactful stories of the first two versions. Sullivan of IGN greatly enjoyed the combination of characters and gameplay from \"Birthright\" and \"Conquest\", but shared her opinion of the central plot device with Corriae. Carsillo found \"Revelation\" the most satisfying due to the obscuring of key plot points in the other versions despite \"Birthright\" and \"Conquest\" offering greater character insight, along with positively noting its gameplay balance between the two physical releases.\n\nShortly after pre-orders for the special edition were announced, it sold out within a day. Following complaints from fans, Nintendo created a second run for the edition. In its week of release, \"Fates\" topped sales charts, with initial sales of both versions totaling 260,675 copies. The game's special edition sold a further 42,991 copies, bringing total sales to 303,666 copies. \"Birthright\" was the better-selling of the physical versions, with \"Conquest\" coming in second place. It remained at the top of the charts the following week, selling a further 54,896 copies. \"Birthright\" remained at the top, while \"Conquest\" dropped to fourth place. By the third week, both versions of \"Fates\" had dropped to fourth place, selling a further 29,682 copies and bringing total sales to 345,253 copies. \"Famitsu\"s sales estimates were slightly higher, with their sales figures for the game totaling 353,201 copies, and going on to sell 71,550 and 41,400 copies over the next two weeks, bringing total recorded sales to 456,274 copies. In July, Kibayashi reported via Twitter that \"Fates\" was the current best-selling video game on Amazon Japan. By the end of 2015, according to \"Famitsu\", both physical versions had sold a combined total of 538,669 units, coming in at No. 10 of the year's top-selling video games.\n\nPrior to its western release, pre-orders for the Special Edition holding all three versions were high, resulting in it selling out by December 2015. After this, a glitch in GameStop's ordering system meant that copies of the Special Edition were reserved after stocks were empty, and they gave orders the option of cancelling or transferring their order to a different Special Edition offer. On release in North America, the game became the fastest-selling game in the series' history, selling over 300,000 units during its opening weekend: this was estimated as being five times the debut sales of \"Awakening\" during a similar period. \"Birthright\" was the better-selling of the two versions, with \"Conquest\" said to be \"close behind\". According to the February NPD Group report, \"Fates\" sold nearly 400,000 copies across physical and digital versions, with both versions reaching places in the top ten gaming chart. In addition, combined sales of all versions including the Special Edition placed the game third overall in software sales, tripling the equivalent first-month sales of \"Awakening\". When the physical versions released in the UK, \"Birthright\" was the better-selling edition, coming in at No. 5 in the all-format charts behind multi-platform releases \"Doom\", \"\" and \"\". \"Conquest\" came in at No. 11 in the all-format charts. In platform-specific charts, \"Birthright\" and \"Conquest\" reached No. 6 and No. 8 respectively. In a financial briefing at the end of the 2015–2016 fiscal year, the physical versions were said to have sold a combined total of 1.84 million copies. The title's DLC sales were also strong, coming in fifth in the top-five best-selling DLC content for Nintendo products. As of March 2017, the game's total physical and download sales across all regions have come to 1.6 million copies: sales of 500,000 units were recorded for Japan, while the remaining 1.1 million were recorded overseas.\n"}

Robert Bianco of \"USA Today\" wrote that \"the seven-part \"Generation Kill\" is what you'd hope for from the people behind \"The Wire\": an honest, barely adorned, sometimes painfully vivid representation of life as we live it now.

It was released as the band's second single and was later included on their only album, \"Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols\". The song was released during Queen Elizabeth II's Silver Jubilee in 1977. The record's lyrics, as well as the cover, were controversial at the time, and both the BBC and the Independent Broadcasting Authority refused to play the song. The original title for the song was \"No Future\", with the lyrics themselves being a general expression of the band's view of the Monarchy or any individual or establishment commanding general obligation.\n\nThe song reached No.1 on the \"NME\" charts in the United Kingdom, and made it to No. 2 on the official UK Singles Chart as used by the BBC. This led to accusations by some that the charts had been \"fixed\" to prevent the song from reaching No.1.\n\nThe single was released on 27 May 1977, and was regarded by many of the general public as an assault on Queen Elizabeth II and the monarchy. The title is taken directly from \"God Save the Queen\", the national anthem of the United Kingdom. At the time it was highly controversial, firstly for its equation of the Queen with a \"fascist regime\", and secondly for the lyric \"there is no future in England's dreaming\". According to Glen Matlock, who had co-written the song—although he was no longer a member of the band by the time it was released—the bass was inspired by The Move's \"Fire Brigade\".\n\nAlthough many believe it was created because of the Silver Jubilee, the band have denied it, with Paul Cook saying that \"it wasn't written specifically for the Queen's Jubilee. We weren't aware of it at the time. It wasn't a contrived effort to go out and shock everyone.\" Johnny Rotten has explained the lyrics as follows: \"You don't write 'God Save The Queen' because you hate the English race. You write a song like that because you love them, and you're fed up with them being mistreated.\" He intended to evoke sympathy for the English working class, and a general resentment towards the monarchy.\n\nOn 7 June 1977—the Jubilee holiday itself—the band attempted to play the song from a boat named the \"Queen Elizabeth\" on the River Thames, near the Palace of Westminster. After a scuffle involving attendee Jah Wobble and a cameraman, eleven people, including Malcolm McLaren, the man who organised the concert, and several other members of the band's entourage, were arrested when the boat docked.\n\nThe song peaked at No. 2 (below Rod Stewart's \"I Don't Want to Talk About It\" released as a double A-side budget single along with \"The First Cut Is the Deepest\") on the official UK Singles Chart used by the BBC, though there have been persistent rumours that it was actually the biggest-selling single in the UK at the time, and was kept off No. 1 because it was felt that it might cause offence.\n\nVarious sources state that it was indeed the highest-selling single of the week, despite a ban by the BBC and some major retailers and, in order to prevent it from reaching the top of the \"official\" BMRB chart, for one week compilers \"decreed that shops which sold their own records could not have those records represented in the chart\", and thus sales from Virgin Megastores were not counted. \n\nIn addition to the BBC, the single was also banned by the Independent Broadcasting Authority which regulated Independent Local Radio. On at least one singles chart for the period, TOP 20 POPS, the song's position at No. 2 was represented by a blank line. In March 2001, the BBC published an article that said \"God Save The Queen reached number one in the UK in 1977 despite being banned by the BBC and marked a defining moment in the punk revolution.\" The \"NME\" magazine chart did in fact place the single at number-one during the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II.\n\nThe phrase \"no future\", the song's closing refrain, became emblematic of the punk rock movement. The lyric provided the title of Jon Savage's 1991 history of the Sex Pistols and punk rock, \"England's Dreaming\".\n\nBefore the group signed to Virgin, a small number of copies of \"God Save the Queen\" had been pressed on the A&M label. These are now among the most valuable records ever pressed in the UK, with a resale value as of 2006 of between £500 to £13,000 a copy, depending on condition of the disc. The highest recorded sale price of £13,000 was achieved in 2006 by UK collector Marshal Peters who sold a copy of the single complete with its A&M card envelope, of which only nine copies are known to exist. The B-side of the A&M single was \"No Feeling\", an early rough mix or performance of \"No Feelings\". (A later version was released on the Pistols' debut album.) \"Record Collector\" magazine named the A&M single the most collectable record of all time.\n\n\"God Save the Queen\" was featured on the band's only album, \"Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols\", and several compilation albums.\n\n\"Rolling Stone\" ranked \"God Save the Queen\" number 175 on its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and it is also one of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. It was \"Sounds\" magazine's Single of the Year in 1977. In 1989, it was eighteenth in the list of \"NME\" writers' all-time top 150 singles. \"Q\" magazine in 2002 ranked it first on its list of \"The 50 Most Exciting Tunes Ever...\" and third on its list of \"100 Songs That Changed The World\" in 2003. In 2007, \"NME\" launched a campaign to get the song to number 1 in the British charts and encouraged readers to purchase or download the single on 8 October. However, it only made number 42. In 2010, the \"New Statesman\" listed it as one of the \"Top 20 Political Songs\".\n\nIn 2010, the song was ranked amongst the top 10 most controversial songs of all time, in a poll conducted by PRS for Music.\n\nIn 2002, the song was re-released to coincide with the Queen's Golden Jubilee, whereupon the single charted in the top 20. In 2012, it was announced that the single would be re-released on 28 May 2012, coinciding with the 35th anniversary of the original release and the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II. Lydon has voiced his disapproval over the re-release and the campaign, saying in a statement: \"I would like to very strongly distance myself from the recent stories and campaign to push 'God Save The Queen' for the number one spot. This campaign totally undermines what The Sex Pistols stood for. It is certainly not my personal plan or aim. I am proud of what The Sex Pistols achieved and always will be but this campaign totally undermines what The Sex Pistols stood for. This is not my campaign. I am pleased that the Sex Pistols recordings are being put out there for a new generation, however, I wish for no part in the circus that is being built up around it.\" The 2012 re-release peaked at no. 80 in the singles chart.\n\nThe song could be heard during \"Journey along the Thames\", a two-minute film directed by Danny Boyle and played at the beginning of the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, an event opened by the Queen, and held during her Diamond Jubilee. A camera traverses the route the band took in the boat the \"Queen Elizabeth\", between Tower Bridge and Westminster, as the song plays.\n\nOn 3 November 2016, Andrew Rosindell, a right-wing Conservative MP, argued in an early day motion for a return to the broadcasting of the national anthem (named \"God Save the Queen\") at the end of BBC One transmissions each day (The practice was dropped in 1997, ostensibly due to BBC One adopting 24-hour broadcasting by simulcasting BBC News 24 overnight, rendering closedown obsolete), to commemorate the Brexit vote and Britain's subsequent withdrawing from the European Union. At the evening of the same day, BBC Two's \"Newsnight\" programme ended its nightly broadcast with a statement that it was happy to accede to Rosindell's request, before playing out to a clip of the Sex Pistols' similarly named song, much to Rosindell's discontent.\n\nThe single's picture sleeve, featuring a defaced image of Queen Elizabeth II, was designed by Jamie Reid and in 2001 was ranked No. 1 in a list of the 100 greatest record covers of all time by \"Q\" magazine.\n\nA cover version by the English heavy metal band Motörhead was released as a single in 2000 to promote their album, \"We Are Motörhead\".\n\nThe cover art gives further reference to the Sex Pistols by using the same cut-out words to form the title as the Sex Pistols' single cover.\n\nA performance of the song recorded during the band's twenty-fifth anniversary concert at Brixton Academy, on 22 October 2000, appears on their 25 & Alive Boneshaker DVD.\n\n\n\nOn the 18 March 1983 episode of \"SCTV\" in the \"Mel's Rock Pile\" segment, Mel Slirrup (Eugene Levy) has a tribute to punk rock featuring a number by the band The Queenhaters—Martin Short (lead singer), Andrea Martin (lead guitarist/back-up vocals), Eugene Levy (secondary guitarist), Joe Flaherty (bass), and John Candy (drummer)—performing \"I Hate The Bloody Queen\", a sound-alike song that almost matches the original it is spoofing, with references to the Falklands War (\"I'd like to drown the Queen/Off the coast of Argentine/Throw her off a battleship/With her Falkland war machine!\") and the problems that Princess Diana was, and would be soon having with her in-laws (\"I feel sorry for you, Lady Di/Having a mother-in-law like that!\"). This spoof of The Sex Pistols' \"God Save the Queen\" even has its own cover version by Mudhoney on the tribute album \"Oh Canaduh! 2\".\n\n\n"}

The project was announced on 8 October 2012 and it is estimated to open by around 2023.\n\nThe proposed plan for London Resort included an entertainment street, a water park, a theme park, approximately 5,000 hotel rooms and a monorail service linking the resort to Ebbsfleet International station.\n\nThe site straddles the border of the Dartford and Gravesham boroughs and both authorities have pledged their support. In July 2014 the first community consultation was held with a short series of exhibitions in the area around the peninsula.\n\nThe timetable for delivery, including the planning application process and construction timetable, is geared towards completion and opening in 2019. A planning application to Dartford Borough Council is expected to be made in 2015. The project leader is Tony Sefton of London Resort Company Holdings.\n\nIn April 2013 newspaper reports claimed development may be delayed by the discovery of a rare species of spider. Mr. Sefton pledged to remove the colony of distinguished jumping spiders (Sitticus distinguendus) to another suitable site.\n\nThe following month, the \"Kent Messenger\" reported that plans for the theme park could be endangered if a new lower Thames road crossing is sited over the Swanscombe Peninsula and quoted Mr. Sefton as saying \"It could really scupper plans. We are in the final throes of negotiating a very large investment and this makes it very difficult.\" However, the proposal was rejected in December of that year.\n\nThe park may spur the development of a new Garden City development at nearby Ebbsfleet.\nThe closest station to the proposed site is served by Southeastern services from London Charing Cross via and to . A short distance away, is a High Speed 1 station. Trains run from London St Pancras (17 minutes), Paris Gare du Nord (North), and in the future, ; London Resort Company holdings predict the park will add two to three million passengers a year to the HS1 line. A new monorail may take passengers from Ebbsfleet International station to the New Paramount resort. A further 250,000 people may travel directly to the park from central London by 'water taxis' along the River Thames; project leader Tony Sefton has said he aims for the park to have the \"lowest modal mix\" of car park spaces of any similar resort in the world.\n\nChanges to local infrastructure will be necessary to accommodate millions of additional visitors annually to North West Kent, though it is possible the route of a planned new Thames road crossing may have been in part decided as a result of this development.\n\nCrossrail's route may be altered to run as far east as Hoo Junction, just beyond Gravesend, Kent; there are no firm plans to run trains beyond in south east London. It is not known if the plans for Paramount London will create a viable case for Crossrail services to serve the park. The Hoo Peninsula was also one of the proposed Thames Estuary airport sites, although this was rejected in 2014 in favour of expansion at either Heathrow or Gatwick airports. There are also plans to create a road joining the theme park onto the A2 in Kent.\n\nThe development would be built on 872 acres of mostly saltmarsh (and a small amount of brownfield land) on the Swanscombe peninsula, part of the Environmentally Sensitive Area known as North Kent Marshes, and be twice the size of the Olympic Park in East London. The development would lie in the floodplain of the Inner Thames, using up one of the few remaining patches of the floodplain that is wild and undeveloped, and which is also used to accept floodwaters in order to reduce the pressure on the critical flood defences of the river. There is also concern given the marshland in question is home to several species which are endangered in the UK, including; the Distinguished Jumping Spider, Water Vole, and Marsh Harrier.\n\nAfter Paramount withdrew from the project, London Resort Company Holdings insisted the project would continue as planned but without the Paramount brand.\n"}

New faces such as Glen Keane, Ron Clements, John Musker, Andreas Deja, and others came to the studio in the late 1970s and early 1980s, a period that produced such features as \"The Rescuers\", \"Pete's Dragon\" (a live-action/animation hybrid), and \"The Fox and the Hound\", as well as the featurettes \"The Small One\" (Bluth's only Disney-directed credit) and \"Mickey's Christmas Carol\" (the first screen appearance of Mickey Mouse since 1953).\n\nAt the same time, animator Steven Lisberger brought to the studio a concept about a computer programmer who is launched into a computerized world. The film would mix live action sequences with computer animation, which had not yet been used to such an extent. The studio was impressed with the idea; the result was an ambitious $17 million film ($ in today's dollars) entitled \"Tron\". While Disney's stock dropped four percent after a screening for unenthusiastic investment analysts,\nand in spite of only moderate grosses at the box office,\n\"Tron\" received enthusiastic praise from film critic Roger Ebert, became a cult favorite and turned out—many years later—to have a greater influence on animation (at Disney and elsewhere) than expected.\n\nIn 1984, Disney became the target of a corporate raid by Saul Steinberg, who intended to break up the company piece by piece. At the same time, Roy E. Disney, who had already resigned as President in 1977, relinquished his spot on the Board of Directors in order to use his clout to change the status quo and improve the company's declining fortune. Disney escaped Steinberg's attempt by paying him greenmail, but in its aftermath CEO Ron W. Miller resigned, to be replaced by Michael Eisner. Roy Disney, now back on the Board as its Vice-Chairman, convinced Eisner to let him supervise the animation department, whose future was in doubt after the disappointing box office performance of its big-budget PG-rated feature, \"The Black Cauldron\". The studio's next release, \"The Great Mouse Detective\", fared better in relation to its significantly smaller budget, but it was overshadowed by Don Bluth's \"An American Tail\", another film featuring mice characters that competed directly with \"Mouse Detective\" in theaters.\n\nIn 1988, the studio collaborated with Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis, producing \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\", a comedic detective caper that mixed live action and animation while paying homage to the Golden Age of Cartoons. Disney characters appeared with characters from Warner Bros., Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Universal Pictures and other rival studios for the first time in animation history. The film was a huge box-office success, winning four Academy Awards, reviving interest in animation made for theaters, and popularizing the in-depth study of the history and techniques of animation. Several aging legends in the business, such as Chuck Jones and Friz Freleng, suddenly found themselves the center of attention, receiving acclaim and accolades after decades of being virtually ignored by audiences and industry professionals alike. Additionally, the release of many older Disney features and short cartoons on home video, and the 1983 launch of the Disney Channel, renewed interest in the studio.\n\nDisney followed up \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" and its commercially successful 1988 fully animated feature \"Oliver & Company\" with \"The Little Mermaid\", an adaptation of the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale with songs by Broadway composers Alan Menken and Howard Ashman. \"Mermaid\" was a huge critical and commercial success, won two Academy Awards for its song score, and became the first of a series of highly successful new Disney animated features.\n\nThe studio invested heavily in new technology, creating the Computer Animation Production System to be used in tandem with traditional animation techniques. The first film to use this technology, \"The Rescuers Down Under\", only grossed $27,931,461 ($ in today's dollars), not even equalling the take of the original 1977 film.\n\nHowever, the films that followed it, \"Beauty and the Beast\" and \"Aladdin\", won rave reviews, received multiple Oscars, and topped the box office charts. \"Beauty and the Beast\" would eventually become the first animated feature to win the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy and the first animated feature to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, followed by 2009's \"Up\".\n\nIn 1993, Disney released \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\", the first feature-length stop-motion animated film. Disney's success peaked in 1994, when \"The Lion King\" grossed $328,541,776 ($ in today's dollars). As of 2010, \"The Lion King\" ranked as the 22nd highest grossing motion picture of all time in the United States. Subsequent Disney films such as \"Pocahontas\", \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\", \"Hercules\", \"Mulan\" and \"Tarzan\" were box office and critical successes as well, albeit modestly so when compared to Disney's early-1990s releases.\n\nIn 1994, the death of Disney President and Chief Operating Officer Frank Wells, and the departure of studio chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg to co-found DreamWorks, left Michael Eisner in full control of the company. At the turn of the century, films such as \"\", \"Treasure Planet\", and \"Home on the Range\" failed to meet the critical and commercial expectations set by the 1990s phenomena, in spite of exceptions such as \"Lilo & Stitch\" and \"The Emperor's New Groove\". At the same time, the high level of popular acclaim bestowed upon \"Toy Story\", the first film animated entirely using computer-generated imagery (CGI), sparked an industry trend. Based on the commercial success of Pixar's computer-generated animated films and other CGI fare (especially DreamWorks' \"Shrek\", which contained numerous jabs at Katzenberg's former workplace and boss), Disney came to believe that CGI was what the public wanted—so it ceased producing traditional two-dimensional animation after \"Home on the Range\", and switched exclusively to CGI starting with 2005's \"Chicken Little\".\n\nPublic rifts grew between the animation staff and management, as well as between Michael Eisner and Roy E. Disney. Roy resigned from the board of directors in 2003 with a scathing letter that called the company \"rapacious and soulless\", adding that he considered it to be \"always looking for the quick buck.\" He then launched the internet site SaveDisney.com in an attempt to preserve the integrity of the company and to oust Eisner, who resigned in 2005 after public opinion turned against him.\nRobert Iger succeeded Eisner; one of his first acts as CEO was to regain the rights to Walt Disney's first star Oswald the Lucky Rabbit from NBCUniversal (Iger did so by offering NBC the services of Al Michaels, a play-by-play host then under contract to Disney subsidiary ABC Sports, as a trade). After Disney's acquisition of Pixar in 2006, Pixar executive producer John Lasseter became Chief Creative Officer at both Pixar and Disney, with a plan to reintroduce two-dimensional animation, starting with \"The Princess and the Frog\" in 2009.\n\nAfter 30 years of resisting offers to produce television animation, Disney finally relented once Michael Eisner, who had a background in TV, took over. The first TV cartoons to carry the Disney name, CBS' \"The Wuzzles\" and NBC's \"Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears\", both premiered in the fall of 1985. Breaking from standard practice in the medium, the productions enjoyed substantially larger production budgets than average, allowing for higher-quality writing and animation, in anticipation of recouping profitably in rerun syndication. While \"The Wuzzles\" only lasted a season, \"The Gummi Bears\" was a sustained success with a six-season run.\n\nIn 1987, the TV animation division adapted Carl Barks' Scrooge McDuck comic books for the small screen with the syndicated hit \"DuckTales\". Its success spawned a 1990 theatrical film entitled \"\" and an increased investment in syndicated cartoons. The result of this investment was \"The Disney Afternoon\" in 1990, a two-hour syndicated television programming block of such animated shows as \"Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers\" (1989–91), \"TaleSpin\" (1990–91), \"Darkwing Duck\" (1991–93, also airing on ABC), \"Goof Troop\" (1992–94, also airing on ABC), \"Bonkers\" (1993–94), and \"Gargoyles\" (1994-96). TV animation also brought some animated feature film characters to Saturday morning, including \"The Little Mermaid\" and \"Aladdin\" both on CBS.\n\nDisneyToon Studios was founded in Paris in the late 1980s to produce \"DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp\", which is not considered by the studio to be part of the Disney animated \"canon\". The practice of making non-canon direct-to-video sequels to canon films began in 1994 with \"The Return of Jafar\", a sequel to \"Aladdin\". This was a reversal of the long-standing studio policy against sequels to animated films (which did not apply to live-action films); Walt Disney has often been quoted on the subject as saying \"you can't top pigs with pigs\", a reference to how the \"Three Little Pigs\" short managed to get more than three sequels. Because of strong video sales, the studio continued to make these films in spite of negative critical reaction; 2002's \"\" received a rare 11% rating from the review-aggregating website Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nUnder John Lasseter, the studio has brought this practice to an end.\n\nDisneyToon also produced several non-canon entries that \"did\" receive theatrical releases, such as \"A Goofy Movie\" and \"The Tigger Movie\". The latter brought the Sherman Brothers back to the studio for their first Disney feature film score since \"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\" in 1971.\n\nDon Bluth's company had been driven to bankruptcy twice: once, as Don Bluth Productions, after the disappointing box office take of \"The Secret of NIMH\" coincided with an animator's strike; and again, as the Bluth Group, after the Video game crash of 1983—when Cinematronics, in an attempt to cut its losses, charged fees and royalties of over $3 million ($ adjusted for inflation) to Bluth's company while it was working on a sequel to the laserdisc-based animated arcade videogame \"Dragon's Lair\".\n\nBluth formed Sullivan Bluth Studios with backing from businessman Morris Sullivan, while film director Steven Spielberg—a long-time animation fan who was interested in producing theatrical animation—helped Bluth to produce 1986's \"An American Tail\". The film was a hit, grossing $47,483,002 ($ in today's dollars). During its production, the studio relocated to Ireland, taking advantage of government tax breaks for film production. Bluth's 1988 follow-up \"The Land Before Time\" was a slightly bigger hit, grossing $48,092,846 ($ in today's dollars) and spawning 12 sequels and a TV series. Neither Bluth nor Spielberg were involved with any of the \"Land Before Time\" sequels; Spielberg produced the 1991 sequel \"\" without Bluth.\n\nIn order to gain more creative control, Bluth parted company with Spielberg on his next film, the 1989 release \"All Dogs Go to Heaven\". While the film had the misfortune of opening the same day as Disney's \"The Little Mermaid\", it fared much better on home video.\n\nThe early 1990s were difficult for the studio; it released several box office failures. In 1992, \"Rock-a-Doodle\" was panned by critics and ignored by audiences; its dismal box-office performance of $11,657,385 ($ in today's dollars) contributed to Sullivan Bluth's bankruptcy. Bluth's next feature, 1994's \"Thumbelina\" fared a little better critically but even worse commercially, while \"A Troll in Central Park\", also released in 1994, barely got a theatrical release, grossing $71,368 against a budget of $23,000,000 (or $ against $ in current terms). Bluth and his partner Gary Goldman pulled out of 1995's \"The Pebble and the Penguin\" before it was completed due to disagreements with its distributor, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The remaining work needed to complete the film—thirty percent of the total—was finished by a Hungarian studio, and Bluth and Goldman took their names off the film.\n\nSullivan Bluth Studios closed in 1995. Bluth and Goldman returned to the United States a year earlier to discuss the creation of a feature-animation division at 20th Century Fox; the studio's three previous animated films (\"\", \"Once Upon a Forest\", and the live-action/animation combo \"The Pagemaster\") had all failed. \"Anastasia\", a musical remake of the 1956 film with Ingrid Bergman, did far better than any Bluth film since \"All Dogs Go To Heaven\", but the 2000 release of \"Titan A.E.\", a film far different from the ones Bluth had been making up until then, was a flop. Fox Animation Studios closed soon afterwards; nearly all Fox feature animation was produced by its Blue Sky Studios unit until the Fox Animation Studios imprint was revived, without Bluth or Goldman, in 2009.\n\nAfter parting ways with Bluth, Spielberg turned to television animation, working with the Warner Bros. Entertainment Co. to bring back its animation department, which it had abandoned in the 1960s. A team of former Hanna-Barbera employees led by Tom Ruegger formed a new studio, Warner Bros. Animation, to produce \"Tiny Toon Adventures,\" an animated series that paid homage to the Warner Bros. cartoons of Termite Terrace. The popularity of \"Tiny Toon Adventures\" among young TV viewers made the studio a contender once again in the field of animated cartoons. \"Tiny Toon Adventures\" was followed by \"Steven Spielberg Presents Animaniacs\" and its spinoff \"Pinky and the Brain\". Not only did these cartoons bring in new viewers to Warner Bros., they also captured the attention of older viewers. Warner Bros., minus Spielberg, continued with work such as \"\". \"Batman\" quickly received wide acclaim for its animation and mature writing, and it also inspired . Combined, these four Warner Bros. series won a total of 17 Daytime Emmy Awards.\n\nWhen Disney's feature animation surged in the 1990s, Warner Bros. tried to capitalize on their rival's success with animated feature films of their own, without the assistance of Spielberg. Their films—\"Cats Don't Dance\", \"Quest for Camelot\" and \"The Iron Giant\"—failed to come close to Disney's success, although \"Cats Don't Dance\" and \"The Iron Giant\" both received critical praise and developed cult followings. The 2001 live action/animation hybrid \"Osmosis Jones\", starring Bill Murray, was a costly commercial failure, although its home video performance proved successful enough for the studio's TV animation department to produce a short-lived spin-off series called \"Ozzy and Drix\".\n\nThe perennially-popular \"Looney Tunes\" characters made a comeback. While the older shorts continued to enjoy countless reruns and compilation specials (and a few compilation films), new \"Looney Tunes\" short features were made in the 1990s. Inspired by the success of Disney's \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" and a series of Nike and McDonald's commercials teaming the characters with basketball superstar Michael Jordan, the studio produced the live-action/animation combo \"Space Jam\" in 1996. The film received mixed reviews, but was a major commercial success. However, another 2003 feature, \"\", was a box-office flop, grossing about three-quarter of its $80 million budget worldwide ($ in current terms), but received more positive critical reviews. Other modern \"Looney Tunes\" projects were in a different vein. Unlike the original shorts, \"Taz-Mania\" (1991-1995) and \"Baby Looney Tunes\" (2001-2006) were aimed primarily at young children, while \"Loonatics Unleashed\" (2005-2007) was a controversial revamping of the characters in the distant future. \"The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries\" (1995-2000) and \"Duck Dodgers\" (2003-2005) were very well received shows and were relatively more faithful to the original shorts. \"The Looney Tunes Show\" (2011-2014) was a modern more adult-oriented sitcom and \"\" (2015-) was a modernized series of Bugs Bunny shorts in the \"Looney Tunes\" tradition, but both shows still got a slightly better reception from audiences than \"Baby Looney Tunes\" or \"Loonatics Unleashed\".\n\nRalph Bakshi, director of ground-breaking animated films like \"Fritz the Cat\" and the original \"Lord of the Rings\" film, returned to animation after taking a short break in the mid-1980s. In 1985, he teamed up with young Canadian-born-and-raised animator John Kricfalusi to make a hybrid live-action/animated music video for The Rolling Stones' \"The Harlem Shuffle\", which was released in early 1986.\n\nThe music video put together a production team at Bakshi Animation whose next project was the short-lived TV series \"\". Bakshi and company worked on several other projects in the late 1980s, but his biggest project, 1992's \"Cool World\", was a critically panned commercial disappointment. In 2005, Bakshi announced that he would begin working on another feature film, \"Last Days of Coney Island\", which he is financing himself and producing independently. Bakshi suspended production on the film in 2008, but resumed in 2013 after a successful Kickstarter campaign.\n\nThe major reason for the increase in the quantity of American animation was the ability to outsource the actual physical animation work to cheaper animation houses in countries in South and Southeast Asia. Writing, character design, and storyboarding would be done in American offices. Storyboards, model sheets, and color guides would then be mailed overseas. This would sometimes cause troubles as none of the final product would be seen until the completed cels were mailed back to the United States.\n\nWhile budget became much less of an issue, overseas production houses would be chosen on a per-episode—or even per-scene—basis depending on the amount of money that was available at the moment. This resulted in obviously different levels of quality from episode to episode. This was particularly noticeable in shows like \"Gargoyles\" and \"\", where at times characters would appear wildly off-model, requiring scenes to be redone to the dismay of their directors.\n\nThe older Bugs Bunny and Popeye cartoons made way for first-run syndicated cartoons such as \"He-Man and the Masters of the Universe\", \"\", \"ThunderCats\", \"Dennis the Menace\", \"My Little Pony\", \"The Transformers\", \"\", \"Voltron\", and reruns of \"Scooby-Doo\", \"Garfield and Friends\" and \"The Pink Panther\", among many others.\n\nIn 1987, The Walt Disney Company tried its luck at syndication; \"DuckTales\" went on the air that September and lasted 100 episodes. The success of \"DuckTales\" paved the way for a second series two years later, \"Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers\". The following year, the two shows aired together under the umbrella title \"The Disney Afternoon\". In 1991, Disney added another hour; the block aired in syndication until 1999.\n\nThese cartoons initially competed with the nationally broadcast ones. In the 1980s, national TV only aired Saturday mornings, not competing with the weekday and Sunday blocks of syndication aired by local independent stations but; however, by the 1990s, Fox and then WB started airing weekday afternoon blocks. By the end of the 1990s, both syndicated and national TV ended up losing most of its children's market to the rise of cable TV channels like Nickelodeon, Disney Channel and Cartoon Network which provided appealing children's entertainment throughout the week at nearly all hours.\n\nThe late 1980s and 1990s saw huge changes in the Saturday-morning landscape. By now, the once-prosperous Hanna-Barbera Productions was beleaguered by several factors. First of all, its dominance over the networks' schedules was broken by other studios' shows. Second, when \"The Smurfs\" was cancelled by NBC in 1990, Hanna-Barbera had no other hits on the air. Finally, its ability to successfully exploit older characters like \"The Flintstones\" and \"Scooby-Doo\" with new shows was coming to an end; \"Scooby-Doo\" would end a near-continuous 22-year first-run after its most recent juniorized version, \"A Pup Named Scooby-Doo\", ended its run in 1991. The 1990 theatrical release of \"\" was a success for the fading studio and earned $20 million ($ in today's dollars). In 1987, Great American Insurance Company owner Carl Lindner, Jr. became the majority shareholder of Hanna-Barbera's parent company, Taft Broadcasting, renaming it Great American Communications.\n\nGreat American wanted out of the entertainment business, and Hanna-Barbera was sold to the Turner Broadcasting System in 1991. Ted Turner had expressed that he mainly wanted ownership of the studio's back catalog; its launch of Cartoon Network on October 1, 1992 provided a new audience for Hanna-Barbera cartoons, both old and new.\n\nIn 1989, producer Tom Ruegger had led an exodus of Hanna-Barbera staffers to restart Warner Bros. Animation. At first, the studio was constantly under threat of closure. However, under Fred Seibert's guidance, Hanna-Barbera's new staff (whose ranks included Seth MacFarlane, Butch Hartman, and Genndy Tartakovsky) created a new generation of Hanna-Barbera cartoons in the 1990s such as \"2 Stupid Dogs\", \"Dexter's Laboratory\", \"Johnny Bravo\", \"Cow and Chicken\", \"I Am Weasel\" and \"The Powerpuff Girls\". Alongside these Hanna-Barbera cartoons, shows from other companies also premiered on the channel such as \"Space Ghost Coast to Coast\", \"Ed, Edd 'n' Eddy\" and \"Courage the Cowardly Dog\". These shows were designed to appeal to adults as well as children, and thus incorporated plenty of \"adult humor\", such as pop-culture references and veiled sexual innuendos.\n\nTime Warner acquired Turner in 1996, and thus inherited the rights to all of Hanna-Barbera's creative properties. This allowed Cartoon Network to begin airing all of the classic \"Looney Tunes\" shorts as well (previously, Turner had owned only the \"Looney Tunes\" shorts produced before August 1948, which had become part of the MGM/UA library). Cartoon Network's success with original programming lead them to move the reruns of old Hanna-Barbera and \"Looney Tunes\" cartoons to their spin-off channel Boomerang.\n\nIn 1997, Fred Seibert left Hanna-Barbera to found his own studio. In 1998, Hanna-Barbera moved to the same building as Warner Bros. Animation; the use of the Hanna-Barbera name for new productions ended with William Hanna's death in 2001. Hanna and Barbera continued to work as Time Warner employees and consultants until their respective deaths in 2001 and 2006; the name is still used for productions based on properties originally created during the Hanna-Barbera era. Cartoon Network Studios now handles most original animation for the network.\n\nIn 1991, Nickelodeon introduced \"The Ren & Stimpy Show\". \"Ren & Stimpy\" was a wild and off-beat series that violated all the restrictions of Saturday morning cartoons, instead favoring the outrageous style of the shorts from the Golden Age period. The series' creator, John Kricfalusi—a Ralph Bakshi protege—was largely influenced by the classic works of Bob Clampett. In spite of the show's popularity, the show was beset with production delays and censorship battles with Nickelodeon, which fired Kricfalusi in 1992. The show continued under the production of the network-owned Games Animation company until 1996, though many animators departed with Kricfalusi. TNN revived the show in a more risqué form in 2003, with Kricfalusi receiving more creative freedom, but it only lasted ten episodes.\n\nNickelodeon also gave birth to hit shows such as \"Doug\", \"Rugrats\", \"Rocko's Modern Life\", \"Hey Arnold!\", \"The Angry Beavers\", \"CatDog\", \"SpongeBob SquarePants\", \"The Fairly OddParents\" and \"\". Many of these shows spawned successful theatrical films as well, most notably \"Rugrats\" (which garnered 3 films), \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" (which has garnered 2 theatrical films and several TV movies) and \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" (which garnered both a sequel series and a live action film.)\n\nThe Disney Channel switched from pay-cable to basic cable in the late 1990s, and launched a number of successful animated shows such as \"The Proud Family\" and \"Kim Possible\". Around the same time, it launched Toon Disney, a channel specifically intended for animation (which has since been replaced by Disney XD). Their current most successful series are \"Phineas and Ferb\", \"Gravity Falls\", \"Wander Over Yonder\", and \"Star vs. the Forces of Evil\".\n\nOn cable TV, Nickelodeon, the Disney Channel, and the Cartoon Network grew to a point where they were competitive with the broadcast networks.\n\nAs the 1990s began, the \"Big Three\" networks (ABC, NBC, and CBS) were no longer a three-way oligopoly. The fledgling Fox network launched their Fox Kids programming block on weekdays and Saturdays in 1990, while The WB joined the competition with a kid's programming block shortly after the network's 1995 launch.\n\nWhen NBC compared the success of the live-action youth sitcom \"Saved by the Bell\" to the paucity of their animated hits, they gave up on cartoons in 1992, instead concentrating on live-action teenage shows with their Saturday-morning TNBC block. ABC was purchased by Disney in 1996, and Disney transformed ABC's Saturday schedule into a series of Disney-produced animated cartoons collectively named One Saturday Morning. CBS was simply never able to come up with any new hits once the shows that anchored its late 1980s/early 1990s Saturday morning lineup—\"Muppet Babies\", \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\", \"Garfield and Friends\", etc.—ran their respective courses. When CBS was purchased by Viacom, which also owned Nickelodeon, Viacom simply repurposed much of the Nick Jr. lineup—in addition to adding a Saturday edition of the CBS morning-news program \"The Early Show\".\n\nAs a result of years of activism by Action for Children's Television and others against shows they believed blurred the line between entertainment and advertising, the Children's Television Act was passed in 1990. It began to be strictly enforced in 1996. The Federal Communications Commission began requiring three hours a week of educational and informational program intended explicitly for children, at times when children were awake. Since this required three hours to be \"off limits\" to programs aimed at the general public, the networks naturally chose to air them on Saturday morning, when children were already watching. As a result, almost every Saturday-morning network show is required to contain some educational content. Fox and The WB worked around this problem by airing short one-hour weekday children's blocks instead of morning news shows, but those weekday blocks no longer exist (with the notable exception of PBS, which continues to have large weekday children's programming blocks as of 2010). Nonetheless, there were still a few toy-based children's programs in the 1990s, particularly \"Power Rangers\" and \"Pokémon\".\n\nCable networks were not subject to these—or most other—FCC requirements, which allowed their series to have more leeway with content than network shows. The impact of the new regulations was almost instantaneous: by 1997, Nickelodeon had rocketed past its broadcast competitors to become the most-watched network on Saturday mornings.\n\nThe 1990s saw the beginnings of a new wave of animated series targeted primarily to adults and sometime teens, after a lack of such a focus for over a decade.\n\nIn 1987, \"The Simpsons\", an animated short cartoon segment of \"The Tracey Ullman Show\", debuted. Matt Groening's creation gained its own half-hour series in 1989, the first prime-time animated series since \"The Flintstones\". Although 70 percent of the first episode's animation had to be redone, pushing the series premiere back three months, it became one of the first major hit series for the fledgling Fox network. \"The Simpsons\" caused a sensation, entering popular culture and gaining wide acclaim for its satirical handling of American culture, families, society as a whole, and the human condition.\n\nThe show has won dozens of awards, including 24 Emmy Awards, 26 Annie Awards and a Peabody Award. \"Time\" magazine's December 31, 1999 issue named it the 20th century's best television series. A film version grossed over half a billion dollars worldwide. On February 26, 2009, Fox renewed \"The Simpsons\" for an additional two years, \"...which will secure its place as TV's longest-running prime-time series.\" Its 21st season began on September 27, 2009, breaking the 20-season record it once shared with \"Gunsmoke\".\n\nThe success of \"The Simpsons\" led Fox to develop other animated series aimed at adults, including \"King of the Hill\" (created by Mike Judge), \"Futurama\" (also by Groening), \"Family Guy\", \"American Dad!\" and \"The Cleveland Show\" (all created by Seth MacFarlane). \"King of the Hill\" was an instant success, running 13 seasons. Both \"Futurama\" and \"Family Guy\" were cancelled by the network; after strong DVD sales and ratings in re-runs, both returned to the air—\"Family Guy\" on Fox, and \"Futurama\" on Comedy Central.\n\nIn 1989, a festival of animation shorts, organized by Craig \"Spike\" Decker and Mike Gribble (known as \"Spike & Mike\") and originally based in San Diego, began showcasing a collection of short subject animated films. Known as the \"Classic Festival of Animation\", it played in theatrical and non-theatrical venues across the country.\n\nThe collections were largely made up of Oscar-nominated shorts, student work from the California Institute of the Arts, and experimental work funded by the National Film Board of Canada. Early festivals included work by John Lasseter, Nick Park, Mike Judge, and Craig McCracken. Judge's piece, \"Frog Baseball\", marked the first appearance of his dimwitted trademark characters Beavis and Butt-head, while McCracken's short \"The Whoopass Girls in A Sticky Situation\" featured the introduction of the trio of little girl superheroes that would later gain popularity under their new moniker \"The Powerpuff Girls\".\n\nThe festival gradually turned into a program of films called \"Spike and Mike's Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation\", an underground movement for adult humor and subject matter.\n\nIn 1994, the U.S. cable television network Cartoon Network approved a new series entitled \"\". In a particularly postmodern twist, this show featured live-action celebrity interviews mixed with animation from the original \"Space Ghost\" cartoon. It was the beginning of the now common practice of using old Hanna-Barbera cartoon characters for new edgier productions, such as the surrealistic \"Sealab 2021\", based on the short-lived early 1970s environmentally themed cartoon \"Sealab 2020\". \"Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law\" was about a lackluster superhero, Birdman—originally the star of \"Birdman and the Galaxy Trio\"—who has become a lawyer. His clientele, as well as most of the other characters on the show, are made up entirely of old Hanna-Barbera characters.\n\nAdult Swim, a scheduling block of adult-oriented cartoons appearing on Cartoon Network beginning after primetime, premiered in 2001. Originally limited to Sunday nights, as of 2018, Adult Swim now remains on the air every night until 6:00 a.m. Eastern time. Animated series produced exclusively for Adult Swim include \"The Brak Show\", \"Aqua Teen Hunger Force\", \"Sealab 2021\", \"\", \"The Venture Bros.\", \"Perfect Hair Forever\", \"Stroker and Hoop\", \"Tom Goes to the Mayor\", \"Robot Chicken\", \"Rick and Morty\" and \"Metalocalypse\". In addition to western animation, Adult Swim also runs popular anime series such as \"Cowboy Bebop\", \"Ghost in the Shell\", \"Eureka Seven\", the \"Fullmetal Alchemist\" series, \"Bleach\", and \"InuYasha\".\n\nOther TV networks also experimented with adult-oriented animation. MTV produced several successful animated series especially for its young adult audience, including \"Liquid Television\", \"The Brothers Grunt\", \"Æon Flux\", \"Beavis and Butt-head\" (and its spin-off \"Daria\"), and \"Celebrity Deathmatch\". USA Network's \"Duckman\", starring the voice of Jason Alexander, found a cult following.\n\nAnother successful adult-oriented animated series was Comedy Central's \"South Park\", which saw its beginnings in 1995 with the short cartoon \"The Spirit of Christmas\". Like \"The Simpsons\", \"Beavis and Butt-head\" and \"South Park\" were given the big screen treatment as \"Beavis and Butt-head Do America\" and \"\" both of which met with box office success.\n\nThe 1990s saw major growth in the use of computer-generated imagery to enhance both animated sequences and live-action special effects, allowing elaborate computer-animated sequences to dominate both. This new form of animation soon dominated Hollywood special effects; the films \"\" and \"Jurassic Park\" included Oscar-winning special effects sequences which made extensive use of CGI. After decades of existing as related-but-separate industries, the barrier between \"animation\" and \"special effects\" was shattered by the popularization of computerized special effects—to the point where computer enhancement of Hollywood feature films became second-nature and often went unnoticed. The Academy Award-winning \"Forrest Gump\" (1994) depended heavily on computerized special effects to create the illusion of Tom Hanks shaking hands with Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, and to make Gary Sinise convincingly appear to be a double amputee, winning a special-effects Oscar. The film \"Titanic\" used computer effects in nearly every scene of its three-hour running time; one of the film's 11 Oscars was for special effects.\n\nWhile Disney had made the film \"Tron\"—which extensively mixed live action, traditional animation, and CGI—in 1982, and introduced the CAPS system to enhance traditional animation in 1990s \"The Rescuers Down Under\", a completely computer-animated feature film had yet to be made. In 1995, Disney partnered with Pixar to produce \"Toy Story\", the first feature film made entirely using CGI. The film's success was so great that other studios looked into producing their own CGI films. Computer-animated films turned out to be wildly popular, and animated films returned the highest gross margins (around 52%) of all film genres in the 2004-2013 timeframe.\n\nComputer animation also made inroads into television. The Saturday morning animated series \"ReBoot\" won a large cult following among adults; it was the first of a number of CGI-generated animated series, including \"Beast Wars\", \"War Planets\", and \"Roughnecks\". The quality of the computer animation improved considerably with each successive series. Many live-action TV series (especially science fiction TV series such as \"Babylon 5\") invested heavily in CGI production, creating a heretofore-unavailable level of special effects for a relatively low price.\n\nThe most popular and successful competitor in the CGI race turned out to be Pixar. It originated in 1979 when George Lucas' Lucasfilm was able to recruit Edwin Catmull from the New York Institute of Technology to start the Graphics Group of its special-effects division. In late 1983, Catmull was able to bring in as a freelance independent contractor a Disney animator, John Lasseter, not long after Lasseter (then unbeknownst to Catmull) had been fired by the Walt Disney Company for his vigorous advocacy of computer animation; Lasseter was hired as a full-time employee about a year later.\n\nLucas experienced cash flow issues after his 1983 divorce, and in 1986 Pixar was spun off from Lucasfilm as a separate corporation with $10 million in capital from Apple Computer co-founder Steve Jobs. At that time, Pixar primarily developed computer animation hardware, but Lasseter helped the company make a name for itself by creating acclaimed CGI short films such as \"The Adventures of André and Wally B.\" (1984). After the spin-off, he would go on to produce \"Tin Toy\" (1988), which won an Oscar. The company transitioned into TV commercial production and projects such as the Computer Animation Production System for Disney. After the success of \"Tin Toy\", Pixar made a deal with Disney to produce feature films. The first of these films, 1995's \"Toy Story\", was a smash hit, which in turn led to additional successful films such as \"A Bug's Life\" and \"Toy Story 2\". By then, Jobs had become the owner of Pixar by keeping it alive with additional investments over the years; he had often considered selling it but changed his mind after \"Toy Story\".\n\nPixar's string of critical and box-office successes continued with \"Monsters, Inc.\", \"Finding Nemo\", \"The Incredibles\", \"Cars\", \"Ratatouille\", \"WALL-E\", \"Up\" and \"Toy Story 3\" all receiving rave reviews, earning huge profits, winning awards, and overshadowing Disney's in-house offerings until \"Cars 2\" in 2011 ended the streak when it proved a critical disappointment, albeit still a commercial success. Disney produced a CGI/live action feature film of its own without Pixar (\"Dinosaur\"), but the film received a mixed reaction, even though it was a financial success. During the later years of Michael Eisner's management, friction between Disney and Pixar grew to a point that Pixar considered finding another partner when they could not reach an agreement over profit sharing. When Eisner stepped down in 2005, his replacement, Robert Iger, arranged for Disney to buy Pixar in a $7.4 billion all-stock deal ($ in today's dollars) that turned Steve Jobs into Disney's largest individual shareholder. The deal was structured so that Disney Animation and Pixar Animation would continue to operate as completely separate studios under the Disney corporate umbrella; Lasseter was placed in charge of greenlighting all new animated films for both studios in his new role as Chief Creative Officer.\n\nWhen Jeffrey Katzenberg left Disney to become a co-partner of Steven Spielberg and David Geffen in the new studio DreamWorks, the studio naturally became interested in animation. Its first film, \"Antz\", did not do as well as the Disney-Pixar releases but was a critical success. However, DreamWorks succeeded in its partnership with the British stop motion animation studio Aardman Animations with \"Chicken Run\" in 2000, and later the Oscar-winning \"\" in 2006.\n\nFurthermore, DreamWorks finally had their own success in 2001 with the computer animated feature film \"Shrek\", a gigantic box-office hit that overpowered Disney's summer release for that year, \"\". \"Shrek\" established DreamWorks as Disney's first major competitor in feature-film animation. DreamWorks' commercial success continued with three \"Shrek\" sequels, \"Shark Tale\", \"Madagascar\", \"Bee Movie\", \"Kung Fu Panda\", \"Monsters vs. Aliens\", \"How to Train Your Dragon\" and \"The Croods\". DreamWorks Animation eventually became a separate company from its parent; it is now owned by Universal Studios through its parent company NBCUniversal/Comcast as of 2016.\n\nIn 2003, noting the growing success of studios that relied on computer animation, executive Bob Lambert announced Walt Disney Feature Animation would be converted into a CGI studio.\n\nTwo years later, \"Chicken Little\", the first computer-animated film from the studio, was released to moderate success in the box office and mixed critical reception. On January 24, 2006, Disney announced that it would be acquiring Pixar (the deal successfully closed that May), and as part of the acquisition, executives Edwin Catmull and John Lasseter assumed control of Walt Disney Feature Animation as President and Chief Creative Officer, respectively. Lasseter later acknowledged that there had been discussions back in 2006 about closing Feature Animation as redundant since Disney now owned Pixar, which he and Catmull flatly rejected (\"Not on our watch. We will never allow that to happen.\"); they resolved to try to save Walt Disney's creative legacy by bringing his animation studio \"back up to the creative level it had to be\".\n\nTo maintain the separateness of Disney and Pixar (even though they share common ownership and senior management), it was outlined that each studio is to remain solely responsible for its own projects and is not allowed to borrow personnel from or lend tasks out to the other.\n\nIn 2007, the studio released \"Meet the Robinsons\", which experienced a poor response at the box office despite the lukewarm critical and audience reception. The following film, 2008's \"Bolt\", had the best critical reception of any Disney animated feature since \"Lilo & Stitch\", and became a moderate success. An adaptation of the Brothers Grimm's \"Rapunzel\" tale entitled \"Tangled\" was released in 2010, earning $591 million in worldwide box office revenue, and signified a return by the studio to fairytale-based features common in the traditional animation era. This trend was followed in 2013's global blockbuster hit \"Frozen\", a film inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's \"The Snow Queen\" tale, which released to widespread acclaim and was the first Disney animated film to earn over $1 billion in worldwide box office revenue and is currently the highest-grossing animated film of all time, surpassing Pixar's \"Toy Story 3\". \"Frozen\" also became the first film from Walt Disney Animation Studios to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Film. They also had critical and commercial success with Oscar winner \"Big Hero 6\", \"Zootopia\" and \"Moana\" alongside (following in Pixar's footsteps) their own animated shorts \"Feast\" and \"Paperman\"; the latter shown before \"Wreck It Ralph\".\n\nOther studios attempted to get into the CGI game. After ending its relationship with Don Bluth, 20th Century Fox released a hugely successful CGI-animated feature in early 2002 entitled \"Ice Age\". Also in 2002, Paramount offered \"\", TWC offered \"Hoodwinked!\" in 2005, and Columbia produced \"Open Season\" in 2006. Warner Brothers had a major success in 2006 with the Oscar winning feature film, \"Happy Feet\", while Universal Studios attempted several times to become a viable participant in the market, finally achieving the goal in 2010 with \"Despicable Me\". STX Entertainment will offer Uglydolls in 2019.\n\nIn spite of all its success, computer animation still relies on cartoon and stylized characters. 2001 saw the first attempt to create a fully animated world using photorealistic human actors in \"\", which met with moderate critical success but did not do well at the box office.\n\nIn 2004, the live-action film \"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\" was released. It was notable for being filmed entirely in front of a bluescreen, with the background being completely computer generated; only the actors and some props were real. Robert Zemeckis' film \"The Polar Express\", starring Tom Hanks in five roles, was completely CGI animation, but used performance capture technology to animate the characters. Zemeckis followed \"The Polar Express\" with two other motion capture films: \"Beowulf\" and Disney's \"A Christmas Carol\".\n\nThe use of CGI special effects in live-action film increased to the point where George Lucas considered his 2002 film \"\" to be primarily an animated film that used real-life actors. A growing number of family-oriented films began to use entirely computer-generated characters that interacted on the screen with live-action counterparts, such as Jar-Jar Binks in \"\", Gollum in \"\" and the title character of \"Hulk\". While computer generated characters have become acceptable to moviegoers, there have yet to be any fully animated films featuring virtual human actors, or \"synthespians\".\n\nThe late 1990s saw the rise of Flash animation—animated films created using the Adobe Flash animation software—produced in the U.S. and elsewhere, and distributed through the Internet. The term \"Flash animation\" refers not only to the file format, but to a certain kind of movement and visual style that is seen in many circles as simplistic or unpolished. There are dozens of Flash-animated television series, countless more Flash animated television commercials, and award-winning online shorts in circulation.\n\nSome popular Flash animated cartoons include \"Joe Cartoons\", \"Weebl and Bob\", \"Happy Tree Friends\", \"Homestar Runner\", the \"Brackenwood\" Series, \"Making Fiends\" and \"Salad Fingers\".\n\nAt the start of the 2000s, traditionally animated feature-films were starting to fall from favor from audiences as a result of the increasing successes of computer animated CG movies. In 2000, Fox Animation Studios closed down due to the box office failure of \"Titan A.E.\" which cost between $75 and $90 million, but only earned $38.8 million worldwide. As a result, Fox cut ties with Don Bluth and Gary Goldman, and moved animation services to Blue Sky Studios, where they worked on their first feature, \"Ice Age\" in 2002. \n\nAround 2001, the notable successes of computer-animated films from Pixar and DreamWorks such as \"Monsters, Inc.\" and, \"Shrek\", respectively, against Disney's lesser returns for \"The Emperor's New Groove\" and \"\" led to a growing perception that hand-drawn animation was becoming outdated and falling out of fashion. In 2002, even with the box office success of Disney's \"Lilo & Stitch\", the failure of their much-hyped \"Treasure Planet\" seemed to ensure that there would be major cutbacks at Disney's animation studio. In March of that year, Disney laid off most of the employees at the Feature Animation studio in Burbank, closed down the Disney Animation France studio in 2003 and then the Walt Disney Feature Animation Florida in 2004; downsizing it to one unit and beginning plans to move into fully computer animated films. In 2004, Disney released what it announced to be its last traditionally animated film, \"Home on the Range\". The film received mixed reviews and was not successful at the box office. After the failure of the film, Disney officially abandoned traditional animation altogether, and moved on to work on computer animated films starting with \"Chicken Little\" in 2005.\n\nIn 2003, DreamWorks Animation also stopped working on traditional animated features after the domestic failure of \"\", and the studio moved on to only work on CGI features since then.\n\nHowever, the release of \"The Princess and the Frog\" and \"The Secret of Kells\" in 2009, both nominated for an Academy Award, marked a renewed interest in traditional animation. In the same year, \"Coraline\" and Wes Anderson's \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" (also Academy Award nominated) renewed interest in stop motion animation.\n\nHowever, in 2011, Disney's \"Winnie the Pooh\", while critically acclaimed, was only a moderate success in the box office, and as of now, there are no traditionally animated films planned for Walt Disney Animation Studios for the foreseeable future.\n\nToday, traditionally animated feature films are rare in America, but is still widespread all around the world, from Europe to Japan. In recent years, there are some traditional animated features released later in the 2010s, with \"\" in 2015, \"\" in 2017, and \"Teen Titans Go! To the Movies\" in 2018, coincidentally all based on animated TV shows.\n\nHistorically, despite the continuation of the Best Animated Short Subject category, animated feature films seldom received much recognition from the Academy Awards for anything other than musical scores. The unprecedented nomination of Disney's \"Beauty and the Beast\" for Best Picture and five other awards changed things, even though it only won two Oscars for its song score. Animation had become so widely accepted by the beginning of the 21st century that, in 2001, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences introduced a new Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.\n\nThe three contenders for first honoree in this award were both CGI feature films: \"Shrek\", by DreamWorks, \"Monsters, Inc.\", by Disney and Pixar, and \"\", by Nickelodeon and Paramount. The award that year went to \"Shrek\". Films that year which were passed up included the acclaimed adult oriented film \"Waking Life\" and the photorealistic CGI film \"\".\n\nHayao Miyazaki's critically acclaimed \"Spirited Away\" won the Oscar in 2002. Disney/Pixar's \"Finding Nemo\" received the 2003 award, defeating nominees \"The Triplets of Belleville\" and \"Brother Bear\". Since then, Pixar has won the most awards in this category with the current exceptions being \"\" in 2005, \"Happy Feet\" in 2006, \"Rango\" in 2011, \"Frozen\" in 2013, \"Big Hero 6\" in 2014, and \"Zootopia\" in 2016.\n\nIn 2013, the March 7 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine published the ballots of eight different Oscar voters in the Academy. Of those eight, four voters abstained in the Best Animated Feature category due to inadequate knowledge of the subject. They admitted to not having seen all of the nominations, one person stating “that ended when I was 6.” Such disregard for animated films is often criticized by American animators, who claim that “Hollywood doesn’t care or know the first thing about animated films.”\n\nThe Annie Awards are presented each February by the Hollywood branch of the International Animated Film Association for achievements in the fields of film and television animation in the United States. Formed in 1972 to celebrate lifetime contributions to the various fields within animation, the awards started to honor animation as a whole, including current offerings.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3720684", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3720684", "title": "Murderers' Row (film)", "text": "Murderers' Row (film)\n\nMurderers' Row (sometimes incorrectly punctuated \"Murderer's Row\") is a 1966 American comedy spy-fi film starring Dean Martin as Matt Helm. It is the second of four films in the Matt Helm series, and is very loosely based upon the spy novel \"Murderers' Row\" by Donald Hamilton, which was published in 1962.\n\nAnn-Margret and Karl Malden co-star in this sequel to \"The Silencers\".\n\nThe film begins with a shot of the United States Capitol being destroyed. It is actually a scale model being used in the demonstration of a heliobeam weapon in the headquarters of the Bureau of International Government and Order (\"BIG O\"). BIG O is a secret organization with the goal of world domination that previously appeared in \"The Silencers\".\n\nWith the aid of a mole, BIG O conducts a worldwide assassination campaign against various secret agents working for ICE (Intelligence Counter Espionage). Matt Helm fakes his own death in preparation for investigating the scheme undetected.\n\nHelm meets his boss, Mac, for a mission briefing. Helm is to track down the missing Dr. Solaris, who has developed the powerful heliobeam weapon, a device that uses the concentrated power of sunlight for mass destruction. Helm is told if he can not rescue Solaris he is to kill him, and if captured to kill himself, lest BIG O brainwash him.\n\nPosing as a Chicago gangster named Jim Peters, an alias of \"Lash\" Petroni, Helm travels to the French Riviera to follow his only lead, Solaris's daughter, Suzie. Concerned about her father's disappearance, Suzie helps Matt infiltrate the island lair of the diabolical Julian Wall, blow it up, and thereby save Washington, D.C. from being destroyed.\n\n\nThe film was the second of four produced by Albert R. Broccoli's former partner Irving Allen and Martin's Meadway-Claude Production company for Columbia Pictures in the mid-1960s starring Martin as secret agent Matt Helm. Euan Lloyd, a former Warwick Films publicity specialist and producer of \"The Poppy Is Also a Flower\", assisted Allen in production chores.\n\nLike its predecessor \"The Silencers\", it took a much more light-hearted approach to the source material, treating it more as a gadget-laden spoof of James Bond films than Hamilton's original serious spy story. Unlike Hamilton's world weary professional, Martin plays Helm with his own persona, a fun-loving, wise-cracking alcoholic playboy.\n\nCo-starring is Karl Malden as Dr. Julian Wall, whom \"New York Times\" film critic Bosley Crowther describes as a \"Kansas type Dr. No\". Malden had the idea that his character speaking in a different accent every time he spoke would be amusing.\n\nAlso in the film are Tom Reese as his Oddjob-type henchman named \"Ironhead\" and Beverly Adams returns as secretary Lovey Kravezit, as do the Slaygirls, a group of beautiful and dangerous women. Columbia starlet Camilla Sparv plays Malden's assistant Coco Duquette and Soon Tek-Oh makes a brief appearance as a Japanese agent killed in his bath.\n\nThe first script was by Oscar Saul, who had written \"The Silencers\". Herbert Baker, who had received a screen credit after he wrote the final version of \"The Silencers\" script, was brought in to rewrite Saul's first draft of \"Murderers' Row\" and received sole credit. Baker had written several Martin and Lewis screenplays and was a writer for \"The Dean Martin Show\".\n\nFilming began 18 July 1966.\n\nThe film was originally intended to be shot totally on location, but Martin, who also co-produced the film, refused to go to Europe. Second unit teams shot sequences in Villefranche-sur-Mer, Monte Carlo and the Isle of Wight for the hovercraft and helicopter sequences instead. The then new Saunders-Roe SR.N6 hovercraft appearing in the film's sea sequences (with the land chase through the streets of Monte Carlo and scenes with Martin using a mock up) was provided by Hoverwork Hovercraft as their first assignment with a Cushioncraft CC5 appearing as well.\n\nHenry Levin had previously directed the Dino DeLaurentiis superspy film \"Kiss the Girls and Make Them Die\" for Columbia. He would also direct the following Matt Helm film, \"The Ambushers\". The titles are again by Wayne Fitzgerald, and James Curtis Havens continued in the series as second unit director.\n\nLike its predecessor, the film is full of jokes, bizarre secret weapons like a Hy Hunter Bolomauser modified AR-7 pistol configuration that only fires ten seconds after the trigger is pulled, plenty of beautiful women, and fashionable mod 1966 costumes by Moss Mabry. Karl Malden's character uses a Gyrojet spearfiring pistol and a volley gun type pistol. Helm kills a guard with a dart fired out of a cigarette; a weapon also used in \"You Only Live Twice\". Martin's Helm drove a 1966 Ford Thunderbird landau.\n\nReleased only ten months after \"The Silencers\", \"Murderers' Row\" was the eleventh highest-grossing film of the year. The film received 1967 second place Laurel Awards for Best Action Drama and Best Action Performance for Martin.\n\n\"Murderers' Row\" was followed by \"The Ambushers\" (1967) and \"The Wrecking Crew\" (1969). A fifth film, \"The Ravagers\" with Sharon Tate reprising her \"Wrecking Crew\" character and Dean Martin doing a dual role, was announced but never produced. Martin refused to make \"The Ravagers\" so Columbia reportedly held up Martin's share of the profits on \"Murderers' Row\".\n\nThe 1960s Helm spoofs (as well as the two Derek Flint movies with James Coburn, the first of which came out the same year as the first Helm feature) seemed to become the template of the 1970s Bond films and in some cases Helm film setpieces were copied by the later Bonds. In \"Diamonds Are Forever\", SPECTRE threatens the world with a heliobeam device from an orbiting satellite. The electromagnetic demise of Ironhead in the film happens to the giant \"Jaws\" villain in \"The Spy Who Loved Me\", the hovercraft chase on sea and land reoccurs with a gadget-filled gondola in \"Moonraker\" with that film's evil mastermind Hugo Drax making jokes similar to Julian Wall.\n\nThe film score is by Lalo Schifrin, replacing Elmer Bernstein. In addition to the driving main theme and spy time score, Schifrin includes some jazz pieces, with one having a cover version by Bud Shank, as well as a song with lyrics by Howard Greenfield (\"I'm Not the Marrying Kind\") for Martin that, due to contractual rights, didn't appear on the soundtrack album. It did, however, appear on Martin's LP, \"Happiness is Dean Martin\".\n\nBilly Strange slightly changed Schifrin's main title to be an \"original\" composition entitled \"Spanish Spy\" on his \"James Bond Double Feature\" album.\n\nThe pop group Dino, Desi & Billy (which featured Martin's son, Dean Paul Martin, who calls Helm \"Dad\" in the film) makes an appearance and sings the Boyce & Hart song, \"If You're Thinkin' What I'm Thinkin'\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "454024", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=454024", "title": "Paracosm", "text": "Paracosm\n\nA paracosm is a detailed imaginary world. Paracosms are thought generally to originate in childhood and to have one or numerous creators. The creator of a paracosm has a complex and deeply felt relationship with this subjective universe, which may incorporate real-world or imaginary characters and conventions. Commonly having its own geography, history, and language, it is an experience that is often developed during childhood and continues over a long period of time, months or even years, as a sophisticated reality that can last into adulthood. \n\nThe concept was first described by a researcher for the BBC, Robert Silvey, with later research by British psychiatrist Stephen A. MacKeith and British psychologist David Cohen. The term \"paracosm\" was coined by Ben Vincent, a participant in Silvey's 1976 study and a self-professed paracosmist.\n\nPsychiatrists Delmont Morrison and Shirley Morrison mention paracosms and \"paracosmic fantasy\" in their book \"Memories of Loss and Dreams of Perfection\", in the context of people who have suffered the death of a loved one or some other tragedy in childhood. For such people, paracosms function as a way of processing and understanding their early loss. They cite James M. Barrie, Isak Dinesen and Emily Brontë as examples of people who created paracosms after the deaths of family members.\n\nMarjorie Taylor is another child development psychologist who explores paracosms as part of a study on imaginary friends. In Adam Gopnik's essay, \"Bumping Into Mr. Ravioli\", he consults his sister, a child psychologist, about his three-year-old daughter's imaginary friend. He is introduced to Taylor's ideas and told that children invent paracosms as a way of orienting themselves in reality. Similarly, creativity scholar Michele Root-Bernstein discusses her daughter's invention of an imaginary world, one that lasted for over a decade, in the 2014 book, \"Inventing Imaginary Worlds: From Childhood Play to Adult Creativity\".\n\nParacosms are also mentioned in articles about types of childhood creativity and problem-solving. Some scholars believe paracosm play indicates high intelligence. A Michigan State University study undertaken by Root-Bernstein revealed that many MacArthur Fellows Program recipients had paracosms as children, thus engaging in what she calls worldplay. Sampled MacArthur Fellows were twice as likely to have engaged in childhood worldplay as MSU undergraduates. They were also significantly more likely than MSU students to recognize aspects of worldplay in their adult professional work. Indeed, paracosm play is recognized as one of the indicators of a high level of creativity, which educators now realize is as important as intelligence. In an article in the \"International Handbook on Giftedness\", Root-Bernstein writes about paracosm play in childhood as an indicator of considerable creative potential, which may \"supplement objective measures of intellectual giftedness ... as well as subjective measures of superior technical talent.\" There is also a chapter on paracosm play in the 2013 textbook \"Children, Childhood and Cultural Heritage\", written by Christine Alexander. She sees it, along with independent writing, as attempts by children to create agency for themselves.\n\nParacosms are one of the subjects of interest to the emerging field of literary juvenilia, studying the childhood writings of well-known and lesser-known authors. Joetta Harty in her essay \"Imagining the Nation, Imagining an Empire: A Tour of Nineteenth-Century British Paracosms\" contextualizes the paracosms of 19th-century British children, including the Brontë family, Thomas De Quincey's Gombroon and Hartley Coleridge's Ejuxria, with then-current events. Nike Sulway in \"'A Date with Barbara': Paracosms of the Self in Biographies of Barbara Newhall Follett\" explores adult reaction to children perceived as prodigies or geniuses, focusing on how their biographies often focus on their imaginations and paracosmic creations rather than on their daily lives, citing as an example adult reactions to child author Barbara Newhall Follett. \n\nExamples of paracosms include:\n\n\n\n"}

To find out who murdered them, he sets out to 'spy' the girl's chats and whereabouts.\n\nHe finds that a guy followed her at a cafe. Through technology, he finds someone who knows the guy. He then travels to the village where the guy grew up, through the person who knew the guy. From an elderly villager, he learns the past about the guy, Bhairavudu/Sudalai (S. J. Surya). He suffers from sadistic personality disorder and has an unusual desire to kill people and see the victims' family grieving. One day, a village kid sees him killing a person and tells the other villagers. They decide to burn Bhairavudu/Sudalai's house, which his parents died from. Angry, he left the village to continue his killing spree with his younger brother (Bharath). Shiva manages to catch him, but instead he reveals to be his brother. Bhairavudu/Sudalai reveals he killed 23 people and hid their bodies in 23 pillars of a bridge and threatens the citizens to leave his brother unscathed. He also reveals that he plans to destroy a hospital. Shiva kills Bharaivadu’s/Sudalai’s brother in front of the 40 people's families, including an angry Bhairavudu/Sudalai.\n\nBhairavudu/Sudalai plans to kill Shiva's family. Shiva finds out when his mother (Dheepa Ramanujam) calls him and tells him she is scared because there is no current in their house whilst everyone else on the street does, exactly the same as what the girl had said earlier. Shiva manages to save his family. Bhairavudu/Sudalai tries to kill Shiva on his way home, and Shiva gets impaled on a truck. He slowly recovers and gets back on getting Bhairavadu/Sudalai. Because Shiva had shot him before he fell unconscious, he thinks Bhairavudu/Sudalai has hidden himself in a house where he can heal, but he has imprisoned the owners. Shiva finds Bhairavudu/Sudalai and arrests him, but Bhairavudu/Sudalai tells him that he had already planned a big rock fall in the city. Shiva manages to stop the big rock. Meanwhile, Bhairavudu/Sudalai escapes from police and continues with his plan on destroying a hospital. Charlie/Shalini finds out which hospital but refuses to tell Shiva. Shiva tracks down her taxi, and she tells him which hospital it is, and he rushes there and starts evacuating everyone. He saved as many as he could but could not save some patients, which he feels heartbroken over. Shiva finally kills Bhairavudu/Sudalai and tells the media, \"We have only killed the patient but not the disease. Helping people you don’t know is the greatest happiness in the world. We shouldn’t use technology all the time because we don’t have time to spend with others.\" He also tells them that there are other people who may have the same exact disease. The movie ends with Shiva walking with Charlie/Shalini out of the crowd.\n\nS. J. Surya was cast as antagonist for the film. This film marks second collaboration between S. J. Surya, who directed \"Naani\" starring Mahesh Babu as the lead actor, marks his second collaboration. AR Murugadoss was a former assistant of S. J. Surya in the films \"Vaali\" and \"Kushi\". Parineeti Chopra was approached for the film, which she declined citing dates issue. Later, the role went to Rakul Preet Singh. Bharath was signed on to play a negative role.\n\nThe film's principal photography commenced in July 2016. 98% of the film was mainly shot in Chennai itself, with the backdrop being changed as Hyderabad through computer graphics for the Telugu version. The film's first look was released in April 2017. Mahesh has done the film's stunts by himself. Final stage of filming started in Chennai on 16 May 2017. In June 2017, it was reported that, all the talkie portions has been filmed and only two songs were pending. Shooting mainly took place in Chennai, with some portions in and around Hyderabad and Vizag, while the songs were filmed overseas.\n\nThe music is composed by Harris Jayaraj. He has composed for a Telugu film after 7 years. With the project, he also marks his fourth collaboration with AR Murugadoss after \"Ghajini\", \"7aum Arivu\" and \"Thuppakki\" and his second with Mahesh Babu, 11 years after \"Sainikudu\". The audio rights for the soundtrack were bagged by Zee Music Company. The lyrics for the Tamil version of the songs were written by Madhan Karky.\n\nThe film was released on 27 September 2017. Following \"\", \"Spyder\" was also planned to have a simultaneous release in both Telugu and Tamil and also with a Malayalam dubbed version with the same name. Tamil Nadu rights have been acquired by Lyca Productions. The film was described by India Today as \"a failure\". \n\n"}
{"id": "31597516", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31597516", "title": "St. Germain (Theosophy)", "text": "St. Germain (Theosophy)\n\nSt. Germain (also sometimes referred to as Master Rakoczi or Master R) is a legendary spiritual master of the ancient wisdom in various Theosophical and post-Theosophical teachings, responsible for the New Age culture of the Age of Aquarius and identified with the Count of St. Germain (\"fl.\" 1710–1784), who has been variously described as a courtier, adventurer, charlatan, inventor, alchemist, pianist, violinist and amateur composer.\n\nSome write that his name St. Germain was invented by him as a French version of the Latin \"Sanctus Germanus\", meaning \"Holy Brother\". In the Ascended Master Teachings (but not in traditional Theosophy), the \"Master R\", or the \"Master Rakóczi\", is a separate and distinct being from St. Germain.\n\nThere are several \"authoritative\" biographers who usually do not agree with one another. Probably the two best-known biographies are Isabel Cooper-Oakley's \"The Count of St. Germain\" (1912) and Jean Overton-Fuller's \"The Comte de Saint-Germain: Last Scion of the House of Rakoczy\" (1988). The former is a compilation of letters, diaries and private records written about the Count by members of the French aristocracy who knew him in the 18th century. Dr. Raymond Bernard's book \"The Great Secret – St. Germain\" is biographical and covers many aspects of the Count's life including his conflation with Sir Francis Bacon and the author of the Shakespearean opus. Manly Palmer Hall in his \"The Secret Teachings of All Ages\", describes some of the same attributes as Dr. Bernard, including the attribution of the writings of Shakespeare to a great adept like Francis Bacon, who could be amalgamated with the Count of St. Germain.\n\nThere have also been numerous French and German biographies, among them \"Der Wiedergänger: Das zeitlose Leben des Grafen von Saint-Germain\" by Peter Krassa, \"Le Comte de Saint-Germain\" by Marie-Raymonde Delorme and \"L'énigmatique Comte De Saint-Germain\" by Pierre Ceria and François Ethuin.\n\nA book titled \"The Great Secret, Count St. Germain\", by Dr. Raymond Bernard purports that St. Germain was actually Francis Bacon by birth, and later authored the complete Plays attributed to Shakespeare. He also contends, as does the Saint Germain Foundation in Schaumburg, Illinois, that Francis Bacon was the child of Queen Elizabeth and Lord Dudley but that it was kept quiet. According to the theory, Francis was raised by the Bacon family. Yet, throughout the Shakespearean canon, there are numerous hints that the author knows of his true birth, as revealed in the explicit clues in the text of the plays themselves, in pictures, as well as the cipher code that he employed.\n\nSaint Germain is the central figure in the Saint Germain Series of Books published by the Saint Germain Press (the publishing arm of the Saint Germain Foundation). The first two volumes, \"Unveiled Mysteries\" and \"The Magic Presence\", written by Guy Ballard as \"Godfré Ray King\" describe Saint Germain as an Ascended Master, like Jesus, who is assisting humanity. In these first two books, he discusses his personal experiences with Saint Germain and reveals many teachings that are in harmony with Theosophy and some other works referenced above. The third volume, \"The 'I AM' Discourses\", contains material that is foundational to the sacred scriptures of the \"I AM\" Religious Activity, founded in 1930, the first of the Ascended Master Teachings religions.\n\nThere are 20 Volumes in the Saint Germain Series of Books, which are also referred to as the \"Green Books.\" Another work of great importance, the \"Comte de Gabalis\", is said to be from the hand of Sir Francis Bacon before he Ascended and returned as Sanctus Germanus or Saint Germain. First printed in 1670, the book includes a picture of the Polish Rider, Rembrandt's famous painting at the Frick Collection in New York City, which is said to be of Sir Francis Bacon, \"a.k.a.\" the Comte de Gabalis, or the Count of the Cabala. Lotus Ray King (Edna Ballard's pen name), wife of Guy Ballard, talked about this book having been authored by the Ascended Master Saint Germain in the Round Table Talks of the \"I AM\" Religious Activity.\n\nSeveral Theosophists and practitioners of alternate esoteric traditions have claimed to have met Saint Germain in the late 19th or early 20th centuries: \n\nMany groups honor Saint Germain as a supernatural being called a Master of the Ancient Wisdom or an Ascended master. In the Ascended Master Teachings he is referred to simply as Saint Germain, or as the Ascended Master Saint Germain. As an Ascended Master, Saint Germain is believed to have many magical powers such as the ability to teleport, levitate, walk through walls, and to inspire people by telepathy, among others.\n\nThe Theosophical Society after Blavatsky's death considered him to be a Mahatma, Masters of the Ancient Wisdom or Adept. Helena Blavatsky said that he was one of her Masters of Wisdom and hinted that he had given her secret documents. Some esoteric groups credit him with inspiring the Founding Fathers to draft the United States Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, as well as providing the design of the Great Seal of the United States. (See Manly Palmer Hall's \"Secret Teachings of All Ages.\") In New Age beliefs, Saint Germain is always associated with the color violet, the jewel amethyst, and the \"Maltese cross\" rendered in violet (usually the \"iron cross style cross patee\" version). He is also regarded as the \"Chohan of the Seventh Ray\" According to The Theosophical Society, the Seven Rays are seven metaphysical principles that govern both individual souls and the unfolding of each 2,158-year-long Astrological Age. Since according to Theosophy the next Astrological Age, the Age of Aquarius, will be governed by the Seventh (Violet) Ray (the Ray of Ceremonial Order), Saint Germain is sometimes called \"The Hierarch of the Age of Aquarius\". According to the Ascended Master Teachings, Saint Germain is \"The God of Freedom for this system of worlds.\" According to the Ascended Master Teachings, the preliminary lead-up to the beginning of the Age of Aquarius began on 1 July 1956, when Ascended Master Saint Germain became the Hierarch of the Age of Aquarius, replacing the former Astrological Age Hierarch, the Ascended Master Jesus, who had been for almost 2,000 years the \"Hierarch of the Age of Pisces\".\n\nIn the works authored by Alice A. Bailey, Saint Germain is called \"Master Rakóczi\" or the \"Master R.\" (In the Ascended Master Teachings, the Master Rakoczi [ otherwise known as the Great Divine Director ] is regarded as Saint Germain's teacher in the Great White Brotherhood of Ascended Masters.) Alice A. Bailey's book \"The Externalisation of the Hierarchy\" (a compilation of earlier revelations published posthumously in 1957) gives the most information about his reputed role as a Spiritual Master. Saint Germain's spiritual title is said to be \"Lord of Civilization,\" and his task is the establishment of the new civilization of the Age of Aquarius. He is said to telepathically influence people who are seen by him as being instrumental in bringing about the new civilization of the Age of Aquarius. Alice A. Bailey stated that \"sometime after AD 2025,\" the Jesus, the Master Rakóczi (Saint Germain), Kuthumi, and others in the Spiritual Hierarchy would \"externalise\", i.e., descend from the spiritual worlds, and interact in visible tangible bodies on the Earth in ashrams, surrounded by their disciples. Alice A. Bailey said that St. Germain is the \"manager of the executive council of the Christ\"(Theosophists regard \"the Master Jesus\" and \"Christ\" as two separate and distinct beings. They believe in the Gnostic Christology espoused by Cerinthus (\"fl.\" c. 100 AD), according to which \"Christ\" is a being who was incarnated in Jesus only during the three years of the ministry of Jesus). According to certain Theosophists, \"Christ\" is identified as being a highly developed spiritual entity whose actual name is Maitreya. This Maitreya is the same being known in Buddhism as the Bodhisattva Maitreya, who is in training to become the next Buddha on Earth. According to Alice A. Bailey, the \"executive council of the Christ\" is a specific subgroup of the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom, charged with preparing the way for the Second Coming of Christ and the consequent inauguration of the Age of Aquarius.\n\nAccording to The Theosophical Society (not to be confused with the United Lodge of Theosophists) and the Ascended Master Teachings, Saint Germain was incarnated as: (see notes 1, 2, and 3 for sources): (Note: Not all Theosophical and Ascended Master Teaching groups accept all of these incarnations as valid. St. Germain's incarnations as St. Alban, Proclus, Roger Bacon and Sir Francis Bacon are universally accepted.)\n\n\nAccording to the Ascended Master Teachings, Francis Bacon made it appear that he died on Easter Sunday, 9 April 1626, and he even attended his own \"funeral\" in disguise. It is believed by the adherents of the Ascended Master Teachings that he then traveled secretly to Transylvania (then part of Hungary, now part of Romania) to the Rakoczy Mansion of the royal family of Hungary. Finally on 1 May 1684 he is believed to have attained (by his knowledge of alchemy) his physical Ascension (attaining immortality and eternal youth [ the sixth level of Initiation]) at which time Francis Bacon adopted the name \"Saint Germain.\"\n\nThe scholar K. Paul Johnson maintains that the \"Masters\" that Madame Blavatsky wrote about and produced letters from were actually idealizations of people who were her mentors.\n\nAlso see the article \"Talking to the Dead and Other Amusements\" by Paul Zweig \"New York Times\" 5 October 1980, which maintains that Madame Blavatsky's revelations were fraudulent.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "22381411", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22381411", "title": "The Narrative Corpse", "text": "The Narrative Corpse\n\nThe Narrative Corpse is a chain story, or comic jam, by 69 all-star cartoonists based on \"Le Cadavre Exquis\" (see Exquisite corpse), a popular game played by André Breton and his Surrealist friends to break free from the constraints of rational thought.\n\nEdited by Art Spiegelman and Robert Sikoryak, \"The Narrative Corpse\" features contributions from some of the most notable cartoonists of its time from the worlds of underground comix, alternative comics, and European comics (as well as Will Eisner and Mort Walker).\n\nThe \"Narrative Corpse\" graphic novel, co-published by Gates of Heck and Raw Books, had a limited run in 1995 of 9,500 copies. It was the winner of the 1996 Firecracker Alternative Book Award for Best Graphic Novel.\n\nThe creative process was designed as follows: a cartoonist would begin the story with three black-and-white comic-book panels, starring an innocent stick figure named \"Sticky.\" This cartoonist passes his or her three panels on to the next cartoonist, who continues the story in any manner he or she wants with three more panels. The next cartoonist receives only the previous cartoonists's part of the story, and so on.\n\nAlthough the \"story\" oscillates without beginning or end, it can be said to start (after some creative editing by Spiegelman and Sikoryak) with the panels done by Drew Friedman, and end with the ones done by Richard McGuire:\n\nSome contributors featured cameos by their own well-established characters (for example Mort Walker's Sarge, S. Clay Wilson's the Checkered Demon, Will Eisner's Spirit, Matt Groening's Akbar & Jeff, and Bill Griffith's Zippy the Pinhead). It is also of interest that background or guest characters seldom last more than three contributions in a row.\n\nThe idea was first conceived of in May 1990, as a project for \"Raw\" magazine. To expedite the project, two strands were started simultaneously, one in New York City by project co-editor R. Sikoryak, the second in London by Savage Pencil. Nevertheless, the project kept growing (outliving \"RAW\" itself, which ceased publication in 1991) until it was forcibly brought to an end five years after its inception.\n\nIn order to bridge the two strands, R. Sikoryak's original opening panels were cut, although he later drew the oddly-shaped \"splash panel\" that now begins the narrative. Spiegelman himself drew the three panels that link Strand 1 to Strand 2 (bridging the contributions of Joe Sacco and Savage Pencil), while Richard McGuire was brought in to link Strand 2 back to Strand 1 (bridging the contributions of Carol Swain and Drew Friedman).\nThe following is a list of contributors in the order their work appears in \"The Narrative Corpse\":\nR. Sikoryak > Mark Beyer > Gilbert Hernandez > Mary Fleener > M. K. Brown > David Mazzucchelli > Mort Walker > S.

They were founded in 1998 by Tony Chu and Kerry Wong. Their first performance was in the Specialties Act division of the 1998 Pinnacle Fantasy Productions Talent Spokesmodel Showcase and continued to perform martial arts stage shows for several years. ZeroGravity is also known for their independent martial arts films and being the motion capture actors for \"The Matrix Online\" and \"Devil May Cry 3\".\n\nZeroGravity began by performing martial arts stage shows at various cultural festivals, talent showcases, and import car shows. In 2000, they branched into the indie film genre by making short martial arts, action films. At this point, their focus began to shift more from stage shows to their film projects. Other early projects included stunt work in an indie martial arts film starring Ho Sung Pak titled \"Epoch of the Lotus\". In 2001, Kerry Wong moved to Los Angeles and founded a new division of the stunt group named ZeroGravity South. At that time The original group was renamed ZeroGravity North. Shortly after, Kerry Wong established relationships with ACT, an action stunt training group in Los Angeles. Through this new relationship Reuben Langdon and other members of ACT joined ZeroGravity South. After the release of Title Pending 2 and Damn 3, the group began devoting their efforts to breaking into the film business as stunt performers. Several members have also done motion capture for some well known video games, like \"The Matrix Online\" and \"Devil May Cry 3\". Some members even provided voice overs for characters in Devil May Cry 3, with Reuben Langdon returning as the voice of Dante in \"Devil May Cry 4\". In addition, Langdon was featured in the tokusatsu \"B-Fighter Kabuto\", as well as stunt work for \"Power Rangers\". Lateef Crowder was also a villain in the 2005 Tony Jaa film, Tom-Yum -Goong. Other works include small bit parts (mostly martial arts or fighting oriented) in the TV series \"Monk\" and \"Entourage\". Reuben Langdon and Aaron Toney are planned to be villains in the American TV series Kamen Rider Dragon Knight. The team was also featured on Animal Planet's Most Extreme.\n\nTheir first film, \"Title Pending\", featured no dialogue or sound effects but instead played music, much like silents films from the early 20th century. The films run from 10 to 20 minutes in length and had many lengthy fight sequences. They were distributed largely over the internet where they gained popularity. Other early films included a series called \"Damn\", \"Kid Gusto vs The Matrix\", and \"US vs HK\". After producing their earlier films, the group began to release films less frequently but increased the production level by using higher-quality cameras, adding more dialogue and incorporating more plot elements than before.\n\n\nZeroGravity has had numerous members join since its inception. Some members joined for single projects and left shortly afterwards. Members also sometimes participate in other projects and collaborations with other stunt groups. With a large influx of members interested in their film projects, ZeroGravity began a screening process which consisted of a 3-hour test of stunt work, acrobatics, and fight choreography. This screening process is no longer in use.\n"}
