In urban areas, the 4G uses a frequency band located between 2500 MHz and 2600 MHz, and therefore is quite far from the TV band for causing any type of interference problem.\n\nIn rural areas, however, the major operators have asked to use part of the UHF band. Since the UHF frequency band is not expandable, it was agreed that television broadcasting should limit its number of channels. Thus, the frequency band dedicated to the TV will be between 470 MHz and 790 MHz (channels 21-60), and the 4G LTE will use the frequency band between 790 and 860 MHz (former TV channels 61 to 69) being the interval separating the two bands (DTT and 4G) of only 1 MHz, so that there is a risk of interferences in the areas close to the 4G-LTE transmitting towers. In practice, the band used (790 to 862 MHz), called Digital dividend, this will not become a real problem until 2015 (or the start of the 4G deployment in these areas).\n\nDigital dividend to frequency 06 MHz (TV Channels 61 to 69) assigned by the plan for the New UHF Frequency Band distribution agreed in \"The World Radio Congress (WRC-07)\" which identified 108 MHz of Digital Dividend Spectrum from 698 to 806 MHz for ITU-R Regions 2-1 and nine countries in Regions 3-2, including China, India, Japan and Rep. of Korea.\n\nThis Digital dividend is used to improve the coverage of the 4G-LTE new standard in rural areas, needed with the arrival of 4G-LTE and requires therefore the redistribution of UHF frequency band. Starting from January 2015 (in some countries), the main mobile operators will begin to deploy their networks of very high band width \"True 4G\" or LTE using the frequency previously attributed to TV Channels 61 to 69, which is known as \"digital dividend\".\n\n\n"}

The film, based on the novel \"Heroic Measures\" by Jill Ciment, was released on May 8, 2015, by Focus World.\n\nAlex and Ruth Carver, an older couple, want to move because living in a 5-story walk-up is too difficult without an elevator. Alex is a painter and uses one of the rooms as his studio. Ruth is a retired school teacher. They have lived there so many years that it and the neighborhood have become intertwined with their lives. Their niece Lilly is their broker who believes the apartment is worth up to $1M.\n\nThree other plot lines develop simultaneously with the sale of the apartment. One is the problem with the Carvers' old dog Dorothy who gets a ruptured disc and the issue of how much money to spend to help her. The second is an ongoing news story about a driver of a disabled tanker truck, a supposed terrorist, on the bridge near the Carvers' apartment. The third is the Carvers looking at new apartments.\n\nThe vet tells them that an operation costing $10,000 might fix Dorothy's ruptured disk. Alex is against it at first but later agrees with Ruth that they have to do whatever it takes to save Dorothy. After the operation, Dorothy is still unable to move her legs. Toward the end of the movie, while still under the care of the vet, Dorothy starts walking again.\n\nIn their search for a replacement apartment, Ruth finds one she really likes, and their offer is accepted. However, the sellers' agent wants a deposit check that evening or it will go back out to bid. When Alex, Ruth, and Lilly arrive at the apartment to write the deposit, the owners tell them it's not enough. Meanwhile, the news reports that the driver of the tanker has been apprehended. Alex is startled that the driver is \"just a kid\".\n\nAlex does not like the owners' attitude and refuses to write a deposit check. Alex and Ruth leave. As they are leaving, Lilly finds out that the Carvers are no longer interested in selling their apartment. She flips them off and walks away.\n\nThe film ends with Alex walking Dorothy up the stairs to their apartment in the winter. He sees a young couple moving into their building, similar to when he and Ruth first moved in 40 years ago.\n\n\nOn September 25, 2013, production was still in progress with some scenes being shot outdoor near the Myrtle Ave Subway Station in Brooklyn with both Freeman and Keaton. On September 27–28, Freeman and Keaton filmed a scene at BluePearl Veterinary Partners specialty and emergency hospital for pets in Midtown Manhattan.\n\n\"5 Flights Up\" premiered at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival on September 5, 2014.\n\nThe film received mixed to positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 52%, based on 44 reviews, with an average rating of 5.7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"\"5 Flights Up\" is a bit of a narrative fixer-upper, but when it comes to watching Diane Keaton and Morgan Freeman share screen time, you really can't beat the view.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 55 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\n"}

The complete station was designed to be transported by an individual soldier.\n\nThe A-7 is a portable man-pack, radio transceiver with narrow-band frequency modulation. The set can be used as a radio telephone in a wired network and managed remotely. Setting the frequency of the receiver and transmitter circuits is adjusted in tandem by one control handle. The antenna and buffer oscillator circuits are common for the receiving and transmitting circuits.\n\nThe receiver section is a superheterodyne design with a single frequency conversion, consisting of 8 identical 2K2M valves. A regenerative detector with adjustable feedback is used. The transmitter section includes a 2K2M modulator valve, a CO-257 buffer amplifier valve, and a CO-257 power amplifier valve. Switching from reception to transmission is achieved by switching the power from the heater circuits of the receiver and transmitter valves, alternately.\n\nThe transceiver with power supplies and accessories is housed in a wooden box with shoulder straps for carrying as a backpack. For long distances, the set is carried by two soldiers. The set only requires one radio operator. The deployment time is typically not more than 5 minutes.\n\n\nA-7a is a simplified version of the A-7. The total number of valves was reduced to 9. In the transmitter section, the functions of the modulator and power amplifier were combined into one valve, and in the receiver section one valve was used to simultaneously perform the functions of a high-frequency and low-frequency amplifier (the so-called reflex circuit). The ability to work by telegraph was removed. Energy consumption was decreased by about 30%, other main characteristics were not changed. The A-7a set was manufactured by various factories in several different variants: with and without a tone button, with one or two measuring instruments, etc.\n\nA-7b is a 10 valve version introduced in 1945. In the transmitter section two output valves are used in parallel. The transmitting range was increased by around 50%. The frequency range is 24-28 MHz. There is no feedback adjustment in the detector circuit.\n\nThe A-7b was also manufactured from 1950 to 1956 in Pardubice, Czechoslovakia by the Tesla company.\n\n"}

Aguinaldo music is often performed by \"parrandas\" - a casual group of people, often family or friends, who merrily go from house to house taking along their singing.\n\nIn Venezuela, \"aguinaldo\" is a genre of Christmas music and generally have six verses. Played by \"parranderos\" or \"aguinalderos\" that announce their arrival in song and seek to gain entry to the community houses to relate the story of the birth of Christ, and to share in the joy of the message of Peace on Earth and to all People of Good Will. Aguinaldos are played with typical instruments such as the cuatro (a small, four-string guitar), furruco, and maracas. Other instruments often used are violin, guitar, tambourine, mandolin, bandol, caja (a percussive box instrument), and marímbula (an Afro-Venezuelan instrument). In exchange for the entertainment, \"parranderos\" are traditionally given food and drink: hallacas, panettone, rum and \"Ponche Crema\" (a form of alcoholic eggnog). Aguinaldos are also played at Christmas church celebrations.\n\nIn Puerto Rico, the \"aguinaldo\" is a musical gift offered during the Christmas season and is a tradition inherited from the island's Spanish colonizers. As a musical gift, aguinaldos are mostly played by \"parranderos\" or \"trullas\" during the Christmas holidays. This is a practice that is slowly being lost.\n\nOriginally, \"aguinaldos\" were \"villancicos\" with strong religious connotations but soon evolved to \"coplas\" (quartets) and \"decimas\" (ten-verses compositions) about all kinds of everyday topics. Aguinaldos were played with typical instruments such as the bordonúa, a tiple, a cuatro, a carracho or güiro, a cowbell, barriles de bomba, an accordion, and maracas. With bordonua players becoming more difficult to find, the guitar became a staple accompanying the cuatro. Today, panderos (also known as \"pleneras\"), brass instruments and whatever makes noise, are used.\n\nAs a genre, the \"aguinaldo\" is played mostly on the radio on key Christmas holidays in Puerto Rico; the day before Christmas and in Christmas, on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day, and the day before Three Kings Day and on Three King's Day (January 6). Aguinaldos are also played at Christmas church celebrations.\n\nIn the Philippines, the word \"aguinaldo\" has come to refer instead to the gift—usually cash or coins—collected by small groups of children that go carolling. A traditional instrument used is a makeshift tambourine made of several \"tansan\" (aluminium bottle caps) strung on some wire. Carollers solicit homeowners with the chant \"Namamasko po!\" (approx. \"wassailing!\"), and after singing wait to be rewarded with \"aguinaldo\".\n\nAguinaldo or Serenal is a music genre used in Parang (Parranda) a type of Christmas music that came to Trinidad and Tobago from Venezuela. Singers and instrumentalists (collectively known as \"parranderos\") travel from house to house in the community, often joined by friends and neighbours family, using whatever instruments are to hand. Popular parang instruments include the cuatro and maracas (locally known as chac-chacs).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "387230", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=387230", "title": "Beat (music)", "text": "Beat (music)\n\nIn music and music theory, the beat is the basic unit of time, the pulse (regularly repeating event), of the \"mensural level\" (or \"beat level\"). The beat is often defined as the rhythm listeners would tap their toes to when listening to a piece of music, or the numbers a musician counts while performing, though in practice this may be technically incorrect (often the first multiple level). In popular use, \"beat\" can refer to a variety of related concepts including: pulse, tempo, meter, specific rhythms, and groove.\n\nRhythm in music is characterized by a repeating sequence of stressed and unstressed beats (often called \"strong\" and \"weak\") and divided into bars organized by time signature and tempo indications.\n\nMetric levels faster than the beat level are division levels, and slower levels are multiple levels. Beat has always been an important part of music. Some music genres such as funk will in general de-emphasize the beat, while other such as disco emphasize the beat to accompany dance.\n\nAs beats are combined to form measures, each beat is divided into parts. The nature of this combination and division is what determines meter. Music where two beats are combined is in duple meter, music where three beats are combined is in triple meter. Music where the beat is split in two are in simple meter, music where the beat is split in three are called compound meter. Thus, simple duple (2/4, 4/4, 2/2, etc.), simple triple (3/4), compound duple (6/8), and compound triple (9/8). Divisions which require numbers, tuplets (for example, dividing a quarter note into five equal parts), are irregular divisions and subdivisions. Subdivision begins two levels below the beat level: starting with a quarter note or a dotted quarter note, subdivision begins when the note is divided into sixteenth notes.\n\nThe \"downbeat\" is the first beat of the bar, i.e. number 1. The \"upbeat\" is the last beat in the previous bar which immediately precedes, and hence anticipates, the downbeat. Both terms correspond to the direction taken by the hand of a conductor.\n\nAn anticipatory note or succession of notes occurring before the first barline of a piece is sometimes referred to as an upbeat figure, section or phrase. Alternative expressions include \"pickup\" and \"anacrusis\" (the latter ultimately from Greek \"ana\" [\"up towards\"] and \"krousis\" [\"strike\"/\"impact\"] through French \"anacrouse\"). In English, \"anákrousis\" translates literally as \"pushing up\". The term anacrusis was borrowed from the field of poetry, in which it refers to one or more unstressed extrametrical syllables at the beginning of a line.\n\nIn typical Western music time, counted as \"1 2 3 4, 1 2 3 4...\", the first beat of the bar (downbeat) is usually the strongest accent in the melody and the likeliest place for a chord change, the third is the next strongest: these are \"on\" beats. The second and fourth are weaker—the \"off-beats\". Subdivisions (like eighth notes) that fall between the pulse beats are even weaker and these, if used frequently in a rhythm, can also make it \"off-beat\".\n\nThe effect can be easily simulated by evenly and repeatedly counting to four. As a background against which to compare these various rhythms a bass drum strike on the downbeat and a constant eighth note subdivision on ride cymbal have been added, which would be counted as follows (bold denotes a stressed beat):\n\nSo \"off-beat\" is a musical term, commonly applied to syncopation that emphasizes the weak even beats of a bar, as opposed to the usual on-beat. This is a fundamental technique of African polyrhythm that transferred to popular western music. According to Grove Music, the \"Offbeat is [often] where the downbeat is replaced by a rest or is tied over from the preceding bar\". The downbeat can never be the off-beat because it is the strongest beat in time. Certain genres tend to emphasize the off-beat, where this is a defining characteristic of rock'n'roll and Ska music.\n\nA back beat, or backbeat, is a syncopated accentuation on the \"off\" beat. In a simple rhythm these are beats 2 and 4.\n\n\"A big part of R&B's attraction had to do with the stompin' backbeats that make it so eminently danceable,\" according to the \"Encyclopedia of Percussion\". An early record with an emphasised back beat throughout was \"Good Rockin' Tonight\" by Wynonie Harris in 1948. Although drummer Earl Palmer claimed the honor for \"The Fat Man\" by Fats Domino in 1949, which he played on, saying he adopted it from the final \"shout\" or \"out\" chorus common in Dixieland jazz, urban contemporary gospel was stressing the back beat much earlier with hand-clapping and tambourines. There is a hand-clapping back beat on \"Roll 'Em Pete\" by Pete Johnson and Big Joe Turner, recorded in 1938. A distinctive back beat can be heard on \"Back Beat Boogie\" by Harry James And His Orchestra, recorded in late 1939. Other early recorded examples include the final verse of \"Grand Slam\" by Benny Goodman in 1942 and some sections of The Glenn Miller Orchestra's \"(I've Got A Gal In) Kalamazoo\", while amateur direct-to-disc recordings of Charlie Christian jamming at Minton's Playhouse around the same time have a sustained snare-drum back-beat on the hottest choruses.\n\nOutside U.S. popular music, there are early recordings of music with a distinctive backbeat, such as the 1949 recording of Mangaratiba by Luiz Gonzaga in Brazil.\n\nSlap bass executions on the backbeat are found in styles of country western music of the 1930s, and the late '40s early '50s music of Hank Williams reflected a return to strong backbeat accentuation as part of the honky tonk style of country.\nIn the mid-1940s \"hillbilly\" musicians the Delmore Brothers were turning out boogie tunes with a hard driving back beat, such as the No. 2 hit \"Freight Train Boogie\" in 1946, as well as in other boogie songs they recorded. Similarly Fred Maddox's characteristic backbeat, a slapping bass style, helped drive a rhythm that came to be known as rockabilly, one of the early forms of rock and roll. Maddox had used this style as early as 1937.\n\nIn today's popular music the snare drum is typically used to play the backbeat pattern. Early funk music often delayed one of the backbeats so as \"to give a 'kick' to the [overall] beat\".\n\nSome songs, such as The Beatles' \"Please Please Me\" and \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\", The Knack's \"Good Girls Don't\" and Blondie's cover of The Nerves' \"Hanging on the Telephone\", employ a double backbeat pattern. In a double backbeat, one of the off beats is played as two eighth notes rather than one quarter note.\n\nCross-rhythm. A rhythm in which the regular pattern of accents of the prevailing meter is contradicted by a conflicting pattern and not merely a momentary displacement that leaves the prevailing meter fundamentally unchallenged—\"New Harvard Dictionary of Music\" (1986: 216).\n\nA hyperbeat is one unit of hypermeter, generally a measure. \"Hypermeter is meter, with all its inherent characteristics, at the level where measures act as beats.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Betty Lou had one brother, Jim. She graduated from Austin High School in 1952. In school she sang in the choir, and performed in the drama club \"Dirk & Bobble\", appearing in productions like \"You Can't Take It with You\".\n\nThe summer after graduation, Bredemus joined a stock company and performed in several plays, and then returned to Austin, where she studied dramatic arts at the local junior college. She was forced to leave school after her father became ill. Her brother had his education paid for by joining the Navy, which gave Bredemus the idea to join the United States Air Force. She signed up for two years, and started basic training in Texas in 1953. She spent her service at Keesler Air Force Base, Biloxi, Mississippi.\n\nBredemus met her husband Walter Grady Roberts (1933-1977) while performing in the play \"George Washington Slept Here\" together, which was directed by Rance Howard, father of director Ron Howard. Howard and his wife Jean, Roberts and Bredemus became close friends, and decided to tour to a couple of USO bases performing plays. Bredemus and Roberts were married in 1955, and soon after their first child was born, actor Eric Roberts in April 1956.\n\nAfter the army, Walter decided to pursue a career as a playwright, so he moved the family to Louisiana so he could attend Tulane University. The family lived on campus in family housing. Walter left school just shy of graduating, and he moved the family to Decatur, Georgia in 1960. Bredemus soon began working at Emory University in the public relations area, while Walter worked in various theatrical jobs.\n\nIn 1965, Bredemus and Roberts created a children's show for the local network titled \"Bum Bum and His Buddies\". In the first episode, Bredemus played the role of Bum Bum the clown. Betty and Walter had previously created a short-lived series titled \"Creole Capers\". After 15 episodes of \"Buddies\", Bredemus and Roberts moved on to create the Atlanta Actors and Writers Workshop, teaching classes to youth ages five to eighteen. Also in 1965 Bredemus gave birth to their daughter Lisa. The workshop became a huge success and popular among the children of Atlanta.\n\nAmong the children that enrolled were the children of Martin Luther King, Jr. and his wife, Coretta. Their eldest daughter Yolanda King took acting classes taught by Walter. In 1967, their daughter Julia Roberts was born. Bredemus' pregnancy caused commotion within the workshop community as she temporarily had to stop performing the various tasks needed to put on a show. When Julia was born Betty and Walter were experiencing financial difficulty, and Coretta Scott King offered to pay the hospital bill. The King children were taking classes at the workshop when their father was assassinated.\n\nThe workshop eventually closed, and Roberts and Bredemus divorced in 1972. She married Michael Motes and gave birth to their daughter, Nancy, in 1976. Motes was abusive and often unemployed. In 1983, Bredmus divorced Motes, citing cruelty and stating that marrying him was the biggest mistake of her life. She went back to using her maiden name of Bredemus.\n\nBredemus encouraged her children's acting careers through the 1980s and 1990s but largely stayed out of the limelight. Her daughter Nancy Motes died on February 9, 2014 at age 37.\n\nBredemus died on February 19, 2015, in Los Angeles after a battle with lung cancer. She was 80 years old, and is survived by her three children and six grandchildren.\n"}
{"id": "766887", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=766887", "title": "Bring It On (film)", "text": "Bring It On (film)\n\nBring It On is a 2000 American teen comedy film directed by Peyton Reed and written by Jessica Bendinger. The film stars Kirsten Dunst, Eliza Dushku, Jesse Bradford, and Gabrielle Union. It was the first of the \"Bring It On\" film series and was followed by five direct-to-video sequels, none of which contain any of the original cast members: \"Bring It On Again\" (2004), which shared producers with the original, \"\" (2006), \"\" (2007), \"\" (2009) and \"\" (2017). The plot of the film centers around a team's preparation for and participation in cheerleading competitions.\n\n\"Bring It On\" was released in theaters in the North America on August 25, 2000. \"Bring It On\" earned a worldwide gross of approximately $90 million. Since its release, the film has become a cult classic.\n\nTorrance Shipman, an 11th grade student at Rancho Carne High School in San Diego, anxiously dreams about her first day of senior year. Her boyfriend, Aaron has gone to college, and her cheerleading squad, the Toros, is aiming for a sixth consecutive national title. Torrance is elected to replace the team captain, \"Big Red\" who is graduating. Soon, however, teammate Carver is injured and can no longer compete with her broken leg. Torrance holds an audition for Carver's replacement and gains Missy Pantone, a gymnast who recently transferred from Los Angeles to the school for senior year with her twin brother Cliff, with whom Torrance develops a flirtatious friendship. While watching the Toros practice, Missy recognizes their routines from a rival squad that her previous high school used to compete against. After accusing Torrance of being a liar and stealing the routine, she learns from Torrance's offended and passionately defensive reaction that she was completely unaware. So Missy drives Torrance to her hometown of Los Angeles, where they watch an African American and Latino/Hispanic team, the East Compton Clovers, perform routines that are virtually identical to their own team's. Isis, the Clovers' team captain, angrily confronts the two. Torrance learns that \"Big Red\" regularly attended the Clovers' practices to videotape and steal their routines. In the meantime, Missy is seen as a threat by the other female members of the squad (because of her outstanding gymnastic abilities), but she ends up becoming Torrance's best friend and de facto co-captain.\n\nIsis informs Torrance of her plans to defeat the Toros at the regional and national championships, which the team has never attended due to their economic hardship. When Torrance tells the Toros about the routines, the team still votes in favor of using the current routine to win; Torrance reluctantly agrees. At the Toros' next home game, Isis and her teammates show up and perform the Toros' routine in front of the whole school, humiliating them. The Toros realize that they have no choice but to learn a different routine. In desperation, they employ a professional choreographer named Sparky Polastri to provide one, as suggested by Aaron. But at the Regionals, the team scheduled immediately ahead of the Toros performs the exact routine they had been practicing. The Toros have no choice but to perform the very same routine. After the debacle that ensues, Torrance speaks to a competition official and is told Polastri provided the routine to several other teams in California. As the defending champions, the Toros are nevertheless granted their place in Nationals, but Torrance is warned that a new routine will be expected. Torrance, crushed by her failure to lead the team successfully, considers quitting.\n\nCliff encourages and supports her, intensifying their growing attraction. Aaron, however, suggests that she is not leadership material and recommends that she step down from her position, selling her out in the process to Courtney and Whitney who have set themselves up as Torrance's rivals. When Cliff sees Torrance and Aaron together, he angrily severs his friendship with Torrance, to her distress. But her confidence is renewed by Cliff's encouragement and she convinces her unhappy team to create an innovative, new routine instead. She breaks up with Aaron, realizing his infidelity and his inability to be supportive, but Cliff still refuses to forgive her. Meanwhile, the Clovers are initially unable to compete at Nationals due to financial problems. This prompts Torrance to get her dad's company to sponsor the Clovers, but Isis rejects the money and gets her team to Nationals by appealing to a talk show host who grew up in their area. In the finals, the Toros place second, while the Clovers win. However, at the end of the movie, Torrance and Isis find respect in each other. Cliff and Torrance share a romantic kiss.\n\nBloopers run alongside the end credits, as the characters dance and lip-sync to B*Witched's cover of \"Mickey\".\n\n\"Bring It On\" was produced by Marc Abraham and Thomas Bliss. It was the debut film of director Peyton Reed. His major concern with the film was pushing the sexual aspects of cheerleading without losing a PG-13 rating. Roger Ebert from the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" argued that this agenda followed a trend of films at the time that watered down material in order to avoid an R rating and increase box office gross.\n\nPrior to auditioning for the film, actors were expected to have a cheer prepared. In order to avoid the use of stunt doubles, Reed required all the actors to undergo a four-week cheerleading camp. Reed and Gabrielle Union met numerous times to discuss the best way to approach her character. \"I think she was able to find what was cool about that character that in a way I doubt other actresses could have,\" Reed explained in an interview, \"Whenever she's on the screen she has this charisma.\" When editing the film, Reed and editor Larry Bock watched cheerleading exploitation films from the 1970s.\n\n\"Bring It On\" was released in North America on August 25, 2000. The film grossed $17,362,105 in 2,380 theaters during its opening weekend, ranking first at the North American box office. Although it experienced an 18% decline in gross earnings, the film held the top position for a second consecutive week, and later on a third. The film went on to gross $68,379,000 in North America and an additional $22,070,929 overseas for a total gross of $90,449,929.\n\nThe film received a 63% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on a total of 117 compiled reviews; the site's consensus reads: \"Despite the formulaic, fluffy storyline, this movie is surprisingly fun to watch, mostly due to its high energy and how it humorously spoofs cheerleading instead of taking itself too seriously.\" In comparison, Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, gave the film an average score of 52 based on 31 reviews, indicating \"Mixed or average reviews\".\n\nA. O. Scott from \"The New York Times\" commended the film for being able to \"gesture toward serious matters of race and economic inequality\", as well as for its \"occasional snarl of genuine satire\". Kevin Thomas of \"The Los Angeles Times\" also favored the film, calling it a \"Smart and sassy high school movie that's fun for all ages.\" Steven Rae from \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" found it to be a \"likable, low-budget high school comedy\". Meanwhile, Kim Morgan of \"The Oregonian\" dubbed it the \"newest, and probably first, true cheerleading movie.\"\n\nHowever, some reviewers criticized the plot of the film. Although David Sterritt of \"The Christian Science Monitor\" gave praise for the writing, he likened the storyline's simplicity to that of \"the average football cheer\". Kim Edwards from the \"Chicago Tribune\", in a negative review, found the film \"Absurdly unrealistic at times.\" The \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\"s Paula Nechak concluded that the film was \"predictable and surprisingly confusing in its ultimate message. \"\n\nMany critics reserved praise for Kirsten Dunst's performance. In his review, A. O. Scott called her \"a terrific comic actress, largely because of her great expressive range, and the nimbleness with which she can shift from anxiety to aggression to genuine hurt.\" Charles Taylor of \"Salon\" noted that \"among contemporary teenage actresses, Dunst has become the sunniest imaginable parodist.\" Jessica Winter from \"The Village Voice\" shared this sentiment, commenting that \"[Dunst] provides the only major element of \"Bring It On\" that plays as tweaking parody rather than slick, strident, body-slam churlishness.\" Peter Stack of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", despite giving the film an unfavorable review, commended Dunst for her willingness \"to be as silly and cloyingly agreeable as it takes to get through a slapdash film.\"\n\nCultural historian Maud Lavin says that despite \"Bring It On\"s predictable plot, its depiction of aggressive and competitive women, the differences shown between class and race, and the playful way it deals with homophobia gives it deeper cultural clout and meaning. In particular, Lavin says that the film suggests race relations could be \"smoothed and transcended through level-playing-field sports competitiveness.\"\n\nThe film ranked #30 on \"Entertainment Weekly\"s list of the 50 Best High School Movies. Initially unimpressed with the film and giving it 2 of 4 stars, Roger Ebert later referred to it as the \"\"Citizen Kane\" of cheerleader movies.\"\n\nSeveral of cast members from the \"Bring It On\" film franchise have gone on to greater fame or notoriety. Kirsten Dunst, Eliza Dushku, Gabrielle Union, Jesse Bradford, Clare Kramer, Lindsay Sloane, and several others from the original film were already notable entertainers and television actors or have grown into such roles since their participation in the original film. Ryan Drummond voiced Sonic the Hedgehog from 1999 through 2004. Felicia Day, who appeared in \"Bring It On Again\", became a highly respected actress in Joss Whedon's projects such as \"Dollhouse\" and \"Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog\", as well as a screenwriter (\"The Guild\"), entrepreneur and web content creator. Bree Turner, who starred in \"Bring It On Again\", would go on to star in NBC's \"Grimm\". Joshua Gomez, also from \"Bring It On Again\", was going to be well known as \"Chuck\" regular Morgan Grimes. Bethany Joy Lenz and Hayden Panettiere, who appeared in \"Bring It On Again\" and \"Bring It On: All or Nothing\", went on to find sizable television audiences due to their roles on the television programs \"One Tree Hill\" and \"Heroes\"/\"Nashville\", respectively. Lenz also appeared with Michael Copon (who co-starred in \"Bring It On: In It to Win It\") during \"One Tree Hill\"s second season. Copon also starred in \"Power Rangers Time Force\", Ashley Benson from \"In It to Win It\", became known as Hanna Marin in the Freeform television series \"Pretty Little Liars\" and Cassandra Scerbo from \"In It to Win It\", who later known as Nova Clarke in Syfy's \"Sharknado\" film series. The R&B/Pop trio Blaque have a recurring role in \"Bring It On\". Noteworthy R&B singer and film actress Christina Milian, also appears as the main character in \"Bring It On: Fight to the Finish\". Brittany Anne Pirtle from \"Fight to the Finish\", went on to star as the Yellow Power Ranger in Nickelodeon's \"Power Rangers Samurai\" and Holland Roden from \"Fight to the Finish\", became known as Lydia Martin in the MTV supernatural-drama \"Teen Wolf\". Finally, Cristine Prosperi from \"Bring It On: Worldwide Cheersmack\", who star as Imogen Moreno in \"\".\n\n\"Bring It On\" has so far spawned a total of five direct-to-video sequels:\n\nThe only sequel to feature any of the original crew from \"Bring It On\" was 2004's \"Bring It On Again\", which shared the film's same producers. These producers did not return for the subsequent sequels, and none of the films share recurring cast members. Original star Eliza Dushku has even been quoted in interviews as never even having been invited to participate in the sequels. Steve Rash directed two of the sequels and Alyson Fouse has written four. Otherwise, none of the films in the \"Bring It On\" franchise share any personnel whatsoever.\n\nThe five films that follow \"Bring It On\" share only tenuous links with one another. The plot of each film typically follows that of the one originally laid out in the first film - a competitive cheerleading team who has to change routines or other elements they have grown accustomed to in order to win.\n\nA stage version of the film premiered at the Alliance Theatre, Atlanta, Georgia on January 16, 2011. The musical has music by Lin-Manuel Miranda and Tom Kitt, lyrics by Amanda Green, and a book by Jeff Whitty. The director and choreographer is Andy Blankenbuehler, with a cast that includes Amanda LaVergne as Campbell, Adrienne Warren as Danielle, and Nick Blaemire as Randall and \"award-winning competitive cheerleaders from across the country\".\n\nThe Alliance Theatre production was nominated for eight Suzi Bass Awards, winning awards for Choreography (Andy Blankenbuehler), Sound Design (Brian Ronan) and World Premiere Play or Musical. Additionally, the production was nominated for ten Atlanta Theater Fan Awards from www.AtlantaTheaterFans.com, more than any other production in 2011. The production won for Best Musical and Best Choreography (Andy Blankenbuehler).\n\nA national tour of the musical started at the Ahmanson Theatre, Los Angeles, in November 2011 through December 10, 2011 and then travels to San Francisco, Denver, Houston, and Toronto. The national tour stars Taylor Louderman as Campbell and Jason Gotay as Randall. The cast took part in a special celebration kicking off the national tour of the musical on October 22, 2011, which featured performances from the show.\n\nThe \"New York Times\" reviewer wrote of the Ahmanson Theatre production: \"After an opening number that truly dazzles as it reveals the cast’s impressive gymnastic prowess, the score hits its stride only when Campbell transfers to Jackson High. Driven by surging R&B grooves and churning lyrics that suggest the fingerprints of Mr. Miranda ... the dance numbers for the Jackson crowd kick the musical into high gear for most of the first act... Like most entertainments about the trials and triumphs of the teenage years, 'Bring It On' has as much sap as it does pep in its DNA. It’s distinguished primarily by the electrifying dance routines and the elaborate cheer-squad performances.\"\n\nThe musical opened on Broadway at the St. James Theatre, in a limited run, starting on July 12, 2012, in previews, officially on August 1 through December 30, 2012.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "39500244", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39500244", "title": "Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller", "text": "Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller\n\nCognition: An Erica Reed Thriller is a 4-part episodic point-and-click graphic adventure game released by Phoenix Online Studios for multiple platforms. Funded through Kickstarter in 2011, four episodes were released on the PC and Mac, with the first two on the iPad. Jane Jensen, creator of the Sierra On-Line Gabriel Knight series, was a story consultant for the development of the game.\n\nThe first episode, \"The Hangman\", was released on October 30, 2012 and the final episode, \"The Cain Killer\", was released on September 19, 2013.\n\nThe story of \"Cognition\" revolves around Boston FBI agent Erica Reed, who has the unusual ability of postcognition, the ability to see into the past of any object that she touches. At first this power can’t be controlled, but, after training with an antique shop owner named Rose, Erica is not only able to control her power, but use it in different ways. From seeing brief glimpses of the past on an object to helping someone regain lost memories to combining objects to see a vision of a scene where they were together, each ability is useful to help solve each murder mystery. The only person who knows her secret is her partner, John McCoy.\n\nEach episode focuses on a different serial killer and covers a contained story arc while continuing the overarching story of the entire game: Erica's search for the Cain Killer, who murdered her brother Scott but was never caught. After losing her brother three years previous to the start of the game, Erica is determined to track down his killer to the point of obsession. She gets taken off the case by her boss, and is moved onto others under their jurisdiction. But as the game progresses, it becomes clear that these seemingly unrelated killings all have clues that only Erica can find, meaning that someone else knows her secret and wants something from her—someone who has a grudge with the FBI. As Erica gets closer to the truth, with people around her dying and being hurt, she also gets closer to her goal of finding the Cain Killer. But she must make her choice between justice and revenge when the moment comes.\n\nEach episode provides around 3–6 hours of gameplay.\n\nIt is three years after the death of Scott Reed, FBI agent Erica Reed's brother, and she is still on the case of his killer. Unfortunately, the director of the Boston branch, Madison Davies, has closed the file on his murder, despite Erica's protest. In the middle of the night, just as she was finishing up, her partner, John McCoy, tells her that the FBI has been called in to investigate the hanging of an unknown man.\n\nLooking over the scene, taking evidence, and talking to other agents, Erica is able to deduce how the man died. But not everything is as it seems. Using her unstable cognitive powers, she manages to find a piece of a child's wooden toy. Urged by her partner to seek out an antiques dealer by the name of Rose, Erica begins her journey to unlocking more mysteries of her latent abilities. And finding out that the item is one part of a French toy called a Le Pendu, and that other parts are left behind by the killer as clues.\n\nAs she gathers these pieces to unlock another clue, a mysterious text is sent to her cell phone that brings to her attention an old case of a similar style. Following this trail leads Erica to Robert Goodman, the husband of the previously hanged victim. Trying to bring forth a long forgotten memory about the day she died, Erica learns her second power of regression. After sorting out the memory fragments, she uncovers the name of the murderer: Antony Longmore.\n\nUnfortunately, it is found out that the body discovered WAS Longmore. Erica soon discovers that the next victim is her boss, Davies. After an intense shootout in a church, Davies ends up dead, her neck snapped by a noose. Erica is left wondering why she was targeted and by whom.\n\nRight after Davies’ tragic death, Erica and other agents involved are brought in to be debriefed by the new director of the Boston branch, Samuel McAdams. McAdams was the Director there years ago, and is returning now to act as the interim director. During her grilling, both Erica and McAdams hear a noise coming from the main office and go out to investigate. Jared “Sully” Sullivan, a fellow agent with whom Erica has an on-again/off-again relationship, is seen dragged off by the new office assistant, who leaves behind Sully's ear and a silver musical charm.\n\nThe current case being handled by Sully, \"The Wise Monkey\", is now tossed into Erica's lap. The serial killer is named such due to her MO of cutting out the eyes, ears, and tongues of her victims. She also leaves small musical charms on their bodies. The lead suspect is a student at the Berklee College of Music, Kelsey Gardner, and the investigation revolves around trying to learn her whereabouts and what motive she could possibly have for killing the victims.\n\nErica goes to see the dean of the college, Kelsey's apartment, Kelsey's former roommate, and her boyfriend's (Joey Goethals) place of work and residence. During her investigation, Erica discovers that the dean is secretly using loan money to fund extravagant purchases and that Kelsey confronted him about it whereupon her life was turned upside down because of his embezzlement.\n\nThrough the use of another ability gained thanks to Rose's help, called “synergy”, Erica is able to use the six charms that she has collected up to this point together to get a vision of the same alley where “The Hangman” was killed. Seeing the past brought on by these charms, she realizes that Joey is the killer, not Kelsey. Kelsey was in fact, Joey's first victim and he was cutting out his other victims' sense organs to make her perfect again, after feeling remorse over killing her. However, we also find out that he became a victim of his own modus operandi.\n\nThe final confrontation takes place at Joey's hideout, where Erica has to figure out the way to rescue Sully who's trapped and next in line to be killed. Thankfully, she manages to get inside quickly enough to save him. The end of the episode shows Joey being tossed off a balcony of the Enthon Towers apartments.\n\nThroughout the first two episodes, Erica is introduced to Cordelia Smith. She also lost a brother six years ago and is first seen confronting Erica about stealing a rose for Scott's grave at the cemetery. Getting over this quickly, they hit it off from the start and talk about their brothers. It is also discovered that Cordelia lives at the Enthon Towers and that she was afraid that someone was out to get her. Through subterfuge, Erica manages to send a police car to keep tabs on the place.\n\nThe entirety of \"The Oracle\" takes place at the Towers and the player is constantly shifting between Cordelia's past and Erica's present. It is revealed very early on in the episode that Cordelia is also a psion, with the power of precognition (she can see the future). It is also revealed that she is the one that killed off Longmore, Davies, Goethals, and kidnapped Sully.\n\nErica tries to enter the Towers, but is blocked from doing so by McAdams and an elderly man by the name of Skorobeus. Managing to sneak in, she goes looking for McCoy who went investigating the death of Joey Goethals. From this point forward the episode has many flashbacks of what happened six years ago to the Smith family. For they owned the Towers and this tells the tale of how Max Smith died at the hands of Cordelia.\n\nIn her visions of the future, Cordelia saw herself shooting and killing her brother. She goes to the FBI and begs John McCoy to help because the agents investigating Max, Davies and McAdams, don’t believe her. Through a series of four flashbacks where the player controls Cordelia and investigates the penthouse in the present as Erica, we discover that Skorobeus and Max are involved in some financial disputes. It is eventually revealed that Cordelia's other brother, Keith, is in fact elder gentleman's son, though he does not know this.\n\nFollowing a hidden pathway to a sub-basement level, Erica confronts John who admits to knowing everything that happened leading up to her brother's death at the hands of the killer and demands to know why he didn’t say anything. Discovering Keith's heavily injured and bandaged body (from the confrontation three years ago during a struggle with Erica) chained up in the room, they find out that Cordelia had kept him down there to do her dirty work to get Erica involved. After releasing him, Erica finds out that Keith is the Cain Killer that Erica has been searching for the past three years (and three episodes).\n\nThe episode ends as Erica accidentally shoots John, caught in the fear that her vision of herself getting shot by an shadowy figure was coming true.\n\nThe series finale starts off with a flashback set three years ago, prior to Scott's abduction and subsequent death. On the trail of the Cain Killer, Erica and John have arrived at a warehouse and she is preparing to infiltrate a contact of Cain's to find out information on the serial killer's whereabouts. Her cover is eventually blown and she discovers, much to her horror, that Scott has been taken by Cain and is waiting for her arrival to complete his macabre scene. She rushes to the cemetery, and since what follows has already been dealt with at the beginning of the first episode, the scene fades to Scott's funeral.\n\nFade to Cordelia's point-of-view. She tracks Keith to an old family lake house and tries to figure out how to confront him for she knows what he's done and will do. Having already met his flaming fate at the hands of Erica, burn scars are all over him and he's in the bathroom trying to clean up. Cordelia looks around and finds implements of his MO and grabs some powder to subdue him. Knocking him out, she takes him away.\n\nIn the present day and we see Erica and Cordelia talking. After a brief kiss, Cordelia tells Erica to ask Rose about Bao Thanh. Arriving at the antique shop, Erica uses her regression ability to help solidify this memory and reveal that not only was Bao Thanh as psion but so is Rose—she can read minds. That is why she was helping both Erica and Cordelia with their abilities.\n\nMoving on, Erica returns to the FBI station and is pulled from duty by McAdams because of what she did to John at the end of the previous episode. Furious, she nonetheless sneaks into the interrogation room and roughs up Skorobeus to find out that Keith used to work out of the Smith family lake house. Rushing over there, she meets up with Cordelia and after a tense conversation the two agree to work together to take down Keith.\n\nDiscovering his room of horrors in the basement, the two use their combined abilities of being able to see the past and future to uncover his next target: Erica's father. Before they can leave, McAdams shows up and takes Erica into custody while Cordelia gets away. Whether she can convince the director to help her or not, they end up back at the cemetery where it all started and Erica has to work with Cordelia again to save her father. In one final epic confrontation with the Cain Killer, Cordelia sacrifices her own life to take out Cain, and to save Erica from choosing revenge over justice as she once did. In the epilogue, it is revealed that Erica is leaving the FBI to look for and help other psions, and that John died after the shooting in Episode 3, though Erica appears to use her powers to talk to an image of him. She goes to see Sully in the hospital, bringing him the lunch he asked her out for back in the first episode.\n\nPhoenix Online Studios ran a Kickstarter campaign from October 29, 2011 through December 10, 2011 to fund for Cognition. Their goal was $25,000 and they brought in $34,247 by November 21. Following the campaign, the team began developing the game, using the Unity engine.\n\nSkype and Dropbox were used for inter-team communication. The script was written by Cesar Bittar, Katie Hallahan and Nick Bryan, and music composed by Austin Haynes. Jane Jensen acted as a story consultant, to help streamline the story, with Robert Holmes composing a song for the game. Raleigh Holmes was selected to voice Erica Reed and sing the song, “The Taking”, with the Scarlet Furies.\n\nOverall, \"Cognition\" has been viewed positively, with praise given to the story, production values, audio and music. Upon release, reviewers commented on graphical issues, such as clipping issues and erratic walking animations, but these have since been patched. Erica's use of cognitive powers as a gameplay mechanic was positively received by fans and reviewers.\n\nCritical reception generally increased as the series continued, excepting the final episode which received mixed reviews. During the online release party for the final episode, \"The Cain Killer\", Phoenix suggested that a second season is planned.\n"}

Lhamon, in connection with the development of blackface minstrelsy as well as African-American music and African-American dance performances.\n\nAccording to Thomas de Voe’s description, dancing for eels was a popular practice at Catherine Market, which in the 19th century was a destination place for African-American slaves from Long Island who would bring to the market berries, herbs, fish, clams and oysters in order to make a few shillings. Originally those African-Americans would be hired by the market people to dance for money or for fish (hence dancing for eels).\n\nThe Catherine Market in the 19th century was a mixed meeting place for people of various backgrounds, and white working-class people were frequent spectators of the dancing contests. According to W. T. Lhamon, blackface performance was strongly influenced by Catherine Market dancing elements. Modern rap and hip-hop performance also contain traces of gestural continuity from the New York street dancers, which, for example, can be observed in MC Hammer’s using the Market Step in his video U Can't Touch This: a knees open, heel-to-toe rock, often accompanied by one or both hands overhead. This move traces back to \"Dancing for Eels 1820 Catherine Market\", one of the folk drawings depicting the old competition. This drawing is supposedly the source for a later painting, which dates to 1880-1890s. This painting is oil paint on canvas, laid over a tin backing. The subject and composition has a long popularity in American culture.\n\nAccording to an 1849 fishing manual, black men still would meet at the market at dawn to skin eels and engage in dance competition for bundles of fish. The audience would vote for the winner through making noises and cheering for their most favorited performance. This style of completion carried on throughout African American culture all the way to modern day freestyle rap competing. These forms of entertainment grew into routines that featured singing, dancing, and humor for more on stage acts performed by professions.\n\n"}

The editing process can involve correction, condensation, organization, and many other modifications performed with an intention of producing a correct, consistent, accurate and complete work.\n\nThe editing process often begins with the author's idea for the work itself, continuing as a collaboration between the author and the editor as the work is created. Editing can involve creative skills, human relations and a precise set of methods.\nThere are various editorial positions in publishing. Typically, one finds editorial assistants reporting to the senior-level editorial staff and directors who report to senior executive editors. Senior executive editors are responsible for developing a product for its final release. The smaller the publication, the more these roles overlap.\n\nThe top editor at many publications may be known as the chief editor, executive editor, or simply the editor. A frequent and highly regarded contributor to a magazine may acquire the title of editor-at-large or contributing editor. Mid-level newspaper editors often manage or help to manage sections, such as business, sports and features. In U.S. newspapers, the level below the top editor is usually the managing editor.\n\nIn the book publishing industry, editors may organize anthologies and other compilations, produce definitive editions of a classic author's works (scholarly editor), and organize and manage contributions to a multi-author book (symposium editor or volume editor). Obtaining manuscripts or recruiting authors is the role of an \"acquisitions editor\" or a \"commissioning editor\" in a publishing house. Finding marketable ideas and presenting them to appropriate authors are the responsibilities of a sponsoring editor.\n\nCopy editors correct spelling, grammar and align writings to house style. Changes to the publishing industry since the 1980s have resulted in nearly all copy editing of book manuscripts being outsourced to freelance copy editors.\n\nAt newspapers and wire services, copy editors write headlines and work on more substantive issues, such as ensuring accuracy, fairness, and taste. In some positions, they design pages and select news stories for inclusion. At U.K. and Australian newspapers, the term is \"sub-editor\". They may choose the layout of the publication and communicate with the printer. These editors may have the title of \"layout or design editor\" or (more so in the past) \"makeup editor\".\n\nWithin the publishing environment, editors of scholarly books are of three main types, each with particular responsibilities:\n\n\nIn the case of multi-author edited volumes, before the manuscript is delivered to the publisher it has undergone substantive and linguistic editing by the volume's editor, who works independently of the publisher.\n\nAs for scholarly journals, where spontaneous submissions are more common than commissioned works, the position of \"journal editor\" or editor-in-chief replaces the acquisitions editor of the book publishing environment, while the roles of production editor and copy editor remain. However, another editor is sometimes involved in the creation of scholarly research articles. Called the authors' editor, this editor works with authors to get a manuscript fit for purpose before it is submitted to a scholarly journal for publication.\n\nThe primary difference between copy editing scholarly books and journals and other sorts of copy editing lies in applying the standards of the publisher to the copy. Most scholarly publishers have a preferred style that usually specifies a particular dictionary and style manual—for example, \"the Chicago Manual of Style\", the \"MLA Style Manual\" or the \"APA Publication Manual\" in the US, or the New Hart's Rules in the U.K.\n\nTechnical editing involves reviewing text written on a technical topic, identifying usage errors and ensuring adherence to a style guide.\n\nTechnical editing may include the correction of grammatical mistakes, misspellings, mistyping, incorrect punctuation, inconsistencies in usage, poorly structured sentences, wrong scientific terms, wrong units and dimensions, inconsistency in significant figures, technical ambivalence, technical disambiguation, statements conflicting with general scientific knowledge, correction of synopsis, content, index, headings and subheadings, correcting data and chart presentation in a research paper or report, and correcting errors in citations.\n\nLarge companies dedicate experienced writers to the technical editing function. Organizations that cannot afford dedicated editors typically have experienced writers peer-edit text produced by less experienced colleagues.\n\nIt helps if the technical editor is familiar with the subject being edited. The \"technical\" knowledge that an editor gains over time while working on a particular product or technology does give the editor an edge over another who has just started editing content related to that product or technology. But essential general skills are attention to detail, the ability to sustain focus while working through lengthy pieces of text on complex topics, tact in dealing with writers, and excellent communication skills.\n\nEditing is a growing field of work in the service industry. Paid editing services may be provided by specialized editing firms or by self-employed (freelance) editors.\n\nEditing firms may employ a team of in-house editors, rely on a network of individual contractors or both. Such firms are able to handle editing in a wide range of topics and genres, depending on the skills of individual editors. The services provided by these editors may be varied and can include proofreading, copy editing, online editing, developmental editing, editing for search engine optimization (SEO), etc.\n\nSelf-employed editors work directly for clients (e.g., authors, publishers) or offer their services through editing firms, or both. They may specialize in a type of editing (e.g., copy editing) and in a particular subject area. Those who work directly for authors and develop professional relationships with them are called authors' editors.\n\n\n\n"}

First performed on 7 June 1995 at Vienna Festwochen in Vienna, Austria, the piece initially toured around the UK and Europe in 1995, before moving to Australia in early 1996. The performance was later revived and toured in 1997, visiting Europe and North America, and again in 1998, where it toured Europe and Japan.\n\nThe performance, with a run time of 75 minutes, explores masculinity and our perception of the stereotypical 'bloke'. Set in a dark, dusty, British pub, a group of men gather around the blasting jukebox, a pint in one hand and a cigarette in the other. Movement and dance based, this physical theatre performance uncovers the men's insecurities and vulnerability. The concept of gender is investigated through the understanding of what we deem as 'unmanly' and this is closely represented through the gestures, action and movement of the performers, a technique which is often associated with the work of Lloyd Newson and DV8. Looking at conformity regarding male relationships, friendships and identity the performance attempts to realise the struggle of being a 'real' man. The piece is an exploration, concentrating on the complications of existence within a mans world. After receiving its world premiere in Vienna in 1995, the piece went on to tour extensively, and was critically acclaimed, with Rupert Christiansen in The Observer stating that it was 'heartening to find DV8 blazing a fresh, dangerous trail'.\n\nin 1995, Newson collaborated with the director Clara Van Gool to adapt the stage piece for film. The resulting piece, which was screened at numerous film festivals around the world, received numerous awards, including an Emmy Award for the Performing Arts in 1997.\n\n"}

She later took up painting herself.\n\nDewey married her first husband, Orin Zoline, in the later 1930s, approximately the same time that she retired from entertaining. Zoline died in the 1950s. She married her second husband, Morton Wormser, during the same decade. They lived in Sarasota, Florida, for over 25 years. Morton Wormser was an avid tennis player and supporter of the sport. As a result of this interest, professional tennis player Martina Navratilova lived with Frances and Morton when she first arrived in the United States in the early 1970s.\n\nFrances and Morton Wormser traveled \"around the world\" on their honeymoon. She took her last major trip to visit friends in Maui when she was 100 years old. She was a major contributor to the Aviation Museum of Santa Paula, which she supported in honor of her brother, pilot Jim Dewey.\n\nDewey spent more than a decade in showbusiness during the 1920s and 1930s. She played the lead role in a number of shows, including the 1925 revival of \"Sally, Irene & Mary\". It was her performance in \"The Girl Friend\" in 1926, which caught the attention of producer Lew Fields. Fields created the \"Dewey and Gold Revue\", specifically for Dewey and her professional performing partner, Al Gold. Dewey and Gold toured together on the Pantages Circuit in 1927 and 1928. She toured in \"Good Boy\" in 1929.\n\nWormser also performed with Cary Grant in an out-of-town tryout of \"Boom Boom\" in late 1928, which was one of Grant's earliest roles. She later appeared in \"Shoot the Works\", a 1931 revue on Broadway by Heywood Broun. Dewey was also featured in the very first franchised list of Leonard Sillman's \"New Faces\" in 1934. Silman's \"New Faces\" introduced audiences to new up-and-coming Broadway actors, such as Wormser. The 1934 first edition of New Faces also included Henry Fonda and Imogene Coca. Coca became a lifelong friend of Frances Wormser, who also counted Leo Lerman, the former editor of Vogue Magazine and editor-in-chief of \"Vanity Fair\", to be her professional \"soul mate\". He died in 1994.\n\nDewey officially retired from the entertainment industry during the 1930s. She was a buyer for Jane Engel, a women's clothing company, around this time.\n\nFrances Dewey Wormser died on January 28, 2008, from natural causes in Santa Paula, California. She was 104 years old. She had no children.\n\n"}

Norsk Tipping and Norsk Rikstoto are the 2 only companies allowed to offer gambling services to Norwegian citizens. Norsk Tipping offers games like lotteries, sports betting, Keno and several others. Norsk Tipping is wholly state-owned company under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Culture and Church affairs, with rules about what times of day, and how much money players can bet. As of January 2011 all players have to be over 18 years of age to play all games of Norsk Tipping, except scratch tickets. Norsk Rikstoto is also state-owned and is the only company authorised to arrange horse race betting.\n\nIt is legal to arrange gambling parties at home, as long as these parties are not organised as a business. Except games offered by Norsk Tipping, all other forms of online gambling are illegal, with the government working towards stopping foreign companies from operating in Norway. In June 2010 the Norwegian Government passed a law that forced all banks in Norway to deny the customers the use of credit and debit cards at land and online casinos all over the world.\n\nNorwegian citizens are also required to declare tax winnings made in another country.\n\nLotteries and games have always been strictly controlled by the Norwegian government. According to §§ 298 and 299 of the Norwegian Penal Code of 1902, only those games of chance that were offered by special license holders were legal. Only the authority of a legal statute could grant such permission. Thus, all other games, where the main factor affecting the win was luck, were prohibited. Unauthorized gaming operators were punished.\n\nThree acts that were introduced later in the 20th century, offered some exceptions from the strict ban. These were the 1927 Totalisator Act, the 1992 Gaming Act, and the 1995 Lottery Act. In general, they established the state monopoly in the industry. The 1927 Act provided the basis for giving the Norsk Riksoto Foundation the right to offer horse-race betting services. The supervision of their activity was the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture.\n\nThe 1992 Gaming Act granted the state owned Norsk Tipping AS exclusive rights to operate the number game Lotto and football betting, with the Ministry of Culture and Church Affairs tasked to supervise them. The 1995 Lottery Act was more comprehensive as it defined and described all forms of lotteries and other games. It also allowed socially oriented organizations to run such games, because the money collected could be used for the benefit of society.\n\nIn the late 1990s, operation of slots fell under the regulation of the Lottery Act 1995. That was a piece of legislation prepared at the beginning of the last decade of the 20th century. While at the dawn of slot technology, that legislation was sufficient, but it didn't foresee significant technological advances and the subsequent social reaction.\n\nIn 2001 and 2004, the gross turnover from slot machines was NOK 9 billion and NOK 26 billion. That was a tremendous growth comparing to the NOK 200 million in 1990, when slots accounted for a marginal part of the gross turnover of the gaming and lottery sector. In 2004, slot machines brought 64% of gross turnover and 43% of net turnover.\n\nBeing poorly regulated and possessing a serious market potential, slot machines industry grew very fast. The Lottery Act granted licenses only to charitable organizations, but it also didn't prohibit private companies to run slots on behalf of such organizations and share the profit. \nIn 2002 the authorities started working towards restricting slots. One of the officially named reasons for limiting the number of slot machines and introducing various strict requirements was that the number of problem gamblers grew almost proportionally to the number of slot machines. The draft legislation was introduced in March 2003, but the interested commercial companies attempted to legally challenge the new rules.\n\nEventually, in July 2007, slot machines were banned in Norway. In 2009 IVTs (interactive video terminals) were introduced. The players required to have a special card to play on them.\n"}

He was skilled in a style of dancing that he performed in a wooden sandbox of his own construction, and acquired his nickname from the sand he sprinkled to alter and amplify the sound of his dance steps. \"They called the board my Stradivarius,\" Sims said of his sandbox.\n\nFrom the 1950s to the year 2000, Sims was a regular attraction—a \"fixture\"—at Harlem's noted Apollo Theater, comedically ushering failed acts offstage with a hook, broom or other prop. He was also involved in New York City's Hoofers Club, a venue primarily for black tap dancers.\n\nAs part of the resurgence of interest in tap dancing in the 1980s, Sandman Sims served as a cultural ambassador, representing the United States with dance performances around the world. He was featured in the 1989 dance film \"Tap\", along with Sammy Davis Jr., Gregory Hines and Savion Glover, demonstrating classic challenge dancing. Sims also appeared in a 1990 episode of \"The Cosby Show\" as Rudy's tap dancing teacher, facing off against Cliff (Bill Cosby) in a good-natured tap challenge.\n\nIn her review of the play based on his life, \"New York Times\" critic Anna Kisselgoff wrote, \"Sims is a virtuoso among virtuosos—in a class by himself. To say Mr. Sims dances on sand is like saying Philippe Petit is a tightrope walker.\"\n\nBorn in Fort Smith, Arkansas on January 24, 1917, Sims was one of 12 children. The family soon relocated to Los Angeles, California, where he was raised. Describing his childhood, Sims said, \"It was just a whole big dancing family.\" He learned to dance from his father, and said he was dancing as soon as he could walk. He began tap-dancing at the age of 3. He attributed some of his early love for tap dancing in particular to his mother, exasperated that he kept wearing out the toes of his shoes, putting steel taps on the shoes. Along with his brothers, Sims was dancing on the sidewalks of Los Angeles from a young age. At the age of 14, peeping in the windows of a dance school got Sims arrested for loitering, but he was able to dance his way to freedom, convincing a judge that his reason for being on that street was legitimate.\n\nAs a young man, despite his dance talent, Sims aspired to be not a professional dancer, but a professional boxer. After twice breaking his hand, he decided he needed a different means of making a living. Sims had noticed that boxing audiences reacted positively to the way he would dance in the rosin box before getting into the ring, and especially to the distinctive sound his dancing made moving the rosin granules around the wooden box. He began to consider dancing as a career alternative. Sims experimented with several different methods of reproducing the rosin box effect, gluing sandpaper to either his shoes or his dancing mat, but the sandpaper created too much wear on the other surface. Finally he found the solution: loose sand in a low-lipped box. \"People went for the scraping sound ... So I made a sound board by sprinkling sand on a flat platform. That was in 1935.\" His sandbox remained his trademark throughout his career, with some venues even telling Sims, \"If you don't bring your sandbox, don't come at all.\"\n\nDuring this period, it was common for dancers to carry tap shoes with them and, when they encountered another dancer on the street, throw down their shoes by way of challenge. The culture of street dancing in the 1920s has been compared to the rise of break dancing six decades later. As the journal \"Jump Cut\" described it, \"'challenge dancing,' in which each performer tries to outdo the other, is part of tap dancing's heritage, something like the jazz solos in which musicians try to outshine one another.\" Sims later described how the atmosphere of these dance challenges was at least as much collegial as combative, and how dancers learned from one another in what became essentially \"open air dance schools\". Despite performing at various vaudeville venues, Sims found neither fame nor success as a dancer in Los Angeles. In 1947, he tagged along on one of his professional-boxer friend Archie Moore's cross-country drives, and settled in New York City.\n\nAfter arriving in Harlem, Sims began performing on the street as he had done in California, but faced stiff competition from other innovative dancers: \"I knew people who danced on dinner plates. ... There was a man who could dance on newspapers without tearing them. And another who constructed a gigantic xylophone to tap on.\" He performed on corners in between working whatever jobs he could find, and then discovered the \"Amateur Night\" stage on Wednesdays at the Apollo Theater, where he soon gained local notoriety. He eventually won the Amateur Night competition a record-breaking 25 times, after which a rule was instituted that performers could no longer compete once they had earned four first prizes.\n\nWhen big name dancers played The Apollo, there was nothing in the audience but dancers with their shoes,\" said Sandman Sims. \"Up in the balcony dancers, and the first six rows, you saw nothing but tap-dancers, want-to-be tap-dancers, gonna-be tap-dancers, tried-to-be tap-dancers. That's the reason a guy would want to dance at The Apollo.\n\nBy the mid-1950s, he had been hired as the Apollo's stage manager, and soon began his role as the Apollo's famed \"executioner\", chasing Amateur Night contestants the crowd disapproved of off the stage with a shepherd's crook (known since vaudeville times as \"the hook\") a broom, or other props, while dressed in a variety of wacky costumes, whether long underwear, a clown suit, or even a diaper. Backstage, however, he would console defeated contestants with the story of his having been booed off ten times before he finally got to finish his own act. Sims would play \"executioner\" until shortly after Time Warner took over the Apollo in 1999.\n\nHaving found work dancing did not stop him from dancing on the street, however. \"If I saw a dancer, I'd challenge him. I didn't care who it was. The way to get known in New York was to be the best. That's what I strived to be.\" Part of the culture of street challenges, as in Los Angeles, was that competing dancers would also learn from one another.\n\nA significant change to Sims's dancing style came about as a result of his interaction with Harlem's hoofers, practitioners of a variation on the tap he had learned on the west coast. Sims would later define the main difference between tap and hoofing as being that tap focuses on the heel and toe whereas hoofers \"use the whole foot\". As a result of the synergy between hoofing technique and his unique use of a sandbox, his routines were described as being \"as rich in sounds and textures as they were in steps.\" Sims himself put it, \"The feet are a set of drums.\"\n\nConstance Valis Hill, in her 2009 survey \"Tap Dancing America: A Cultural History\", described the hoofers' mecca thusly:\n\nAt the Hoofers Club, rookie and veteran, mostly [B]lack male tap dancers assembled to share with, steal from, and challenge each other; there, new standards were set for competition. These were nothing like the formalized buck-dancing competitions of Tammany Hall, where judges sat beside, before, and beneath the stage to evaluate the [dancers'] clarity, speed, and presentation. The Hoofers Club comprised a more informal panel of peers, whose judgments could be cruel and mocking and were driven by an insistence on innovation. \"Survive or die\" was the credo. In an eccentric fusion of imitation and innovation, young dancers were forced to find their style and rhythmic voice. It was said that on the wall of the Hoofers Club was written: \"Thou shalt not copy each other's steps — Exactly.\"\n\nThough he frequently took opportunities to explain the difference between tap and hoofing to the press in later years, and tended to refer to himself as a hoofer rather than a tap dancer, Sims did practice both forms of dance. In 1949, motivated by the death of Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson, Sims became a founding member of the Original Copasetics, another fellowship of tap dancers that became a source of mentor-student relationships and would help bring about the revival of tap in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nTap dancing lost popularity with audiences beginning in the late 1940s. A number of causes factored into this decline, among them the going out of style of vaudeville-style variety shows; a new tax that forced many ballrooms to close and thus closed venues to the big bands with whom tap dancers had used to perform; trends in music that favored smaller, more intimate groups of performers; and concomitant increases in interest among audiences in watching formal modern dance and ballet performances. Sims was quoted as having said of the period that \"[t]ap didn't die ... It was just neglected.\"\n\nWith paying gigs harder to find and paying less, Sims turned to other sources of income. Despite not having had any formal instruction himself, he taught dance, including to such later stars as Gregory Hines and Ben Vereen. He also taught footwork to boxing greats Sugar Ray Robinson and Muhammad Ali. Less glamorously, he ran a café, and even worked as a carpenter and a mechanic. Despite the lean times for hoofers, Sims was always able to put food on the table for his family, having married in 1959.\n\nThe late 1960s brought the beginning of a wave of nostalgia for tap, and Sims found his dance skills in demand again. In 1969, he was part of the all-star cast of \"Tap Happening\", a revue that played Off-Broadway. \"Tap Happening\" was popular enough to run for several years.\n\nThe crescendo of interest in tap dancing continued, and in 1972, Sims danced in the production \"Best of the Hoofers\" at the Orpheum Theatre. \"Hoofing is not a dying art form,\" he asserted in 1977, and subsequent events would prove him right.\n\n1979 saw the release of \"No Maps on My Taps\", which featured Sims facing off against fellow tap stars Chuck Green—who had served as Sims's mentor during his early years in New York—and Bunny Briggs, in a three-way dance challenge. The documentary also reunited him with bandleader Lionel Hampton, whom he had toured with in years past.\n\nIn 1980, a far cry from the tiny venues he had been lucky to play just a few years earlier, Sims performed before a crowd of 2,600 fans at the Lincoln Center during the Newport Jazz Festival. Later that year, Sims was one of the instructor-performers of the \"By Word of Foot\" \"teach-in\" series, spending a week demonstrating his hoofing techniques for a new generation of tap enthusiasts.\n\nAs part of New York's leg of the 1981 Newport Jazz Festival (which spanned both NYC and its home city of Newport, Rhode Island, that year), he performed with former Cotton Club bandleader Cab Calloway in a production called \"Stompin' at the Savoy\". A few weeks later, Sims was on stage at the American Dance Festival, dancing both with and without his sandbox.\n\nBy 1982, Sims was part of a promotional tour reviving interest in \"No Maps on My Taps\" with co-stars Bunny Briggs and Chuck Green, their pre-screening performances backed by Cab Calloway. Even as booked performances were coming more regularly, Sims never stopped participating in street-corner challenges, encouraging younger generations of dancers and inviting them to learn his moves.\n\nThe National Endowment for the Arts granted Sims a $5,000 National Heritage Fellowship in 1984. \"I thought I was making noise all these years,\" Sims said of the award. \"Now they're calling it culture.\" He used the funds to teach dance to children in Harlem, using a parking lot in lieu of a formal dance studio, drawing on his own youth learning dance on the street. Sims would later explain, \"most people wait [to study dance] until after they've grown up—and then it's too late.\" That same year, clogger Ira Bernstein received an NEA Folk Arts Apprenticeship grant \"[t]o study traditional [B]lack tap dance with master dancer Howard 'Sandman' Sims.\" Sims loved to teach; his son recounted how Sandman would \"stop every kid he saw and show them a step and get them to copy a step. He enjoyed that more than performing in front of an audience.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Harlem's Apollo Theater, where Sims had served for years as Amateur Night's \"executioner\", had been closed for most of a decade. Then, following an extensive renovation, the venue reopened in 1985, bringing increased attention to both the Apollo and his role there. \"I'm their protector, not the executioner,\" he explained to \"The Washington Post\". \"Because that audience can get really hostile.\" Sims described seeing displeased audiences throw bottles and even horseshoes at performers who he did not hustle off stage fast enough. When \"The New York Times\" interviewed him about his \"executioner\" role, he said of the acts that got booed off, \"I tell them to work on their act and come back,\" encouraging them to try again.\n\nIn 1986, Sims starred in \"The Tap Tradition\" at Symphony Space New York (which also hosted a showing of \"No Maps on My Taps\"), earning a rave review from \"The New York Times\". He also made a brief appearance in a play based on his life, \"The Sand Dancer\", which was written by poet Sandra Hochman and starred LeLand Gantt, and which received another rave review: \"Sims is a virtuoso among virtuosos—in a class by himself. To say Mr. Sims dances on sand is like saying Philippe Petit is a tightrope walker.\" And he traveled to Los Angeles to perform in a production called \"Essence of Rhythm\" with fellow tap stars including Charles \"Honi\" Coles and Jimmy Slyde.\n\nSandman Sims was the guest star of \"Late Night with David Letterman\" on May 14, 1987. \"It's Showtime at the Apollo\", a TV broadcast of the Apollo Theater's Amateur Night performances, began broadcasting in September 1987 on NBC stations, bringing awareness of Sims's \"executioner\" role to a wider audience.\n\nA particularly busy year, 1988 saw Sims tour the world as a cultural ambassador on behalf of the U.S. State Department, traveling to over 50 countries in a span of 11 months.\n\nBy 1989, Sims's popularity was at an all-time high, and he told the Associated Press, \"I can't fulfill all the work they give me. ... I can't walk out on the street without somebody showing me a time step.\" Tap dancing's popularity was nearing a new peak as well, with three major American cities (Houston, Texas; Portland, Oregon; Washington, D.C.) hosting tap-dance festivals. In movie theaters, the dance drama \"Tap\" was introducing Sims's footwork (and that of his former student Gregory Hines) to audiences who had never had the opportunity to see him perform before.\n\nPlaying a thinly-fictionalized version of himself named \"Mr. Sims\", Sims made a 1990 appearance on \"The Cosby Show\", then one of the most popular programs on television. \"Mr. Sims\" was the dance instructor the Huxtables signed their young daughter Rudy up with in order to help her prepare for a class assignment about the Harlem Renaissance. During the episode, Cliff Huxtable (Bill Cosby) challenged \"Mr. Sims\" to a dance-off, part tribute to and part parody of Sims's real-life tap challenges, which Sims won handily. Later that same year, the Apollo Theater played host to Rat-a-Tat-Tap, another tap-dance festival, and the Sandman, \"always a deserved audience favorite at tap festivals,\" was a featured performer there alongside his \"Tap\" co-stars Savion Glover and Gregory Hines.\n\nSims was a featured performer at the third annual celebration of National Tap Dance Day on May 30, 1993.\n\nIn 1998, the New York Committee to Celebrate National Tap Dance Day and the Young People's Tap Conference honored Sandman Sims for his contributions to the art of hoofing.\n\nSandman Sims, particularly in his role as Apollo Theater executioner, has been referenced frequently in African-American culture.\n\nWhile Sims had a first marriage which produced his first child Diane Sims, he later married his second wife, Solange. They would have 1 son together, Howard Sims Jr., as well as 5 grandchildren and 1 great-grandchild.\n\nParticularly in later years, Sims sometimes claimed not to be certain of his birth year, at times saying it was \"a matter of opinion.\" Asked by a fan how old he was, Sims once replied, \"Any number can play.\"\n\nSims died on May 20, 2003 in New York City. He had suffered from Alzheimer's disease.\n\nA memorial service for Sims was held May 28, 2003 at the Apollo Theater.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1222519", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1222519", "title": "Illustrated fiction", "text": "Illustrated fiction\n\nIllustrated fiction is a hybrid narrative medium in which images and text work together to tell a story. It can take various forms, including fiction written for adults or children, magazine fiction, comic strips, and picture books.\n\nApart from an occasional portrait or map, 18th century fiction was not usually illustrated, as publishers did not commission illustrations for new novels. In the novel \"The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling\", the author Henry Fielding refers to paintings by William Hogarth in order to explain what some of his characters look like.\nIllustrations were commissioned for already successful books. These illustrated versions were usually published as limited editions and sold through prior subscription. Henry Fuseli created a single frontispiece for the fourth edition of Tobias Smollett's \"The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle\". Thomas Stothard provided several illustrations for an edition of \"The Vicar of Wakefield\" published 30 years after its first publication in 1766.\n\nNear the end of the 18th century, new mechanical techniques allowed pictures to be printed cheaply. Illustrated classics became cheaply available, and were strongly remembered by their readers. John Ruskin was moved by illustrations of Robinson Crusoe crashing into rocks and escaping his wreck. Charles Dickens remembered the illustrations in many books more than the prose itself.\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, illustration increased the sales of previously published fiction. In 1836, the publication of Charles Dickens's \"The Pickwick Papers\" in an illustrated serialized format revolutionised the publication of new fiction. The popularity of the original illustrations in Dickens's novels was unprecedented, and helped to popularize the use of illustrations in serious fiction. This revolution lasted until 1870, as other authors and published attempted to emulate Dickens's success. Illustrations became common in the period. For publishers, new fiction with illustrations published serially was less of a commercial risk than the traditional unillustrated three-volume sets. Illustrations attracted readers and increased advertising revenue. Illustrations were used as advertisement's in booksellers windows.\nDuring the 19th century, the use of photomechanical techniques decreased the cost of reproducing illustrations. Both colour and black and white illustrations were increasingly used in daily, weekly, and monthly publications. Publishers sold a great deal of one-volume hardcovers and periodical serials.\n\nDickens's novels were well-suited to graphic representation. Dickens believed that the drawings that illustrated his fiction were valuable, despite some critics urging him not to use them. Most of his major works were originally published with illustrations. He was intensely involved in the creation of most of the 900 original illustrations of his writing. These illustrations were produced by 18 artists, including George Cruikshank and Robert Seymour.\n\nMost of William Ainsworth's, Charles Lever's, William Thackeray's, and Anthony Trollope's major works were initially published in illustrated monthly parts. Later, novelists preferred to publish their writing in illustrated magazines. Thomas Hardy often did this. George Meredith did this twice, and George Eliot once. 19th century author artists included William Makepeace Thackeray and George du Maurier.\n\nMany artists began their careers illustrating fiction. Illustrating was a difficult and badly paid job. Hablot Knight Browne was one of the few very talented artists to pursue illustrating full-time. Most artists, such as Marcus Stone and Luke Fildes, used illustrating as a stepping-stone to a career in painting. Other artists like George Cattermole and Daniel Maclise supplemented their income by providing illustrations.\n\nThe popularity of illustrated fiction began to decline in the late 19th century, as illustrations lost their novelty and no longer guaranteed that a novel would sell well. Technological improvements in printing flooded the market with affordable novels with illustrations of high quality. Prestigious artists including John Everett Millais, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Edward Burne-Jones, and Frederick Leighton started to illustrate books. Illustrations challenged the novel's prose, implying a failure in prose's self-sufficiency. Prose frequently took second place to illustration.\n\nThe amount of illustrated fiction that was published declined from the beginning of the 20th century to the 1930s. By the 1930s, illustrations were rarely used in adult's novels. Illustrated serious fiction was not popular over the rest of the century. The decline in the publication of serials, rise in labour costs, and competition from film, television, and photojournalism contributed to its decline. There was also less demand from readers. Historians of Western illustrated fiction mostly agree that film replaced the illustrated book. A review of the 1915 film adaptation of \"Vanity Fair\" said that \"the reels make a set of illustrations superior to the conventional pen-pictures of a deluxe edition.\"\n\nModern literary fiction was often not well-suited to illustration, for example the introspective novels of E. M. Forster and Virginia Woolf. Illustrations were used on book covers to attract buyers, but not used within the novel. Similar to the period before 1836, illustrations were not commissioned for new books, but were commissioned for established classics, usually for a limited luxury edition. Serious novels are not illustrated, and illustrated fiction is generally associated with serialized or short fiction that is published in popular but not intellectually prestigious magazines. Children and comics readers became the only fiction readers whose fiction was generally illustrated.\n\nSome authors were concerned that illustrations would date or misinterpret their prose. Henry James disliked illustrations, claiming that illustrations were not needed because prose was sufficiently pictorial. He thought that illustrations and prose were in competition with one another. He permitted his travel books, but not his mature fiction, to be illustrated. Alvin Langdon Coburn's photographs were used in the New York edition of his works only as frontispieces, and only after James reassured himself that they did not compete or make a reference to his prose. Similar to James, Thomas Hardy increasingly excluded illustrations from the collected editions of his novels, with the exception of maps that he had drawn and photographic frontispieces.\n\nNone of the first or standard editions of James Joyce's novels were illustrated during his lifetime, except for an edition of \"Ulysses\" published by the Limited Editions Club in 1935, which included drawings and etchings by Henri Matisse. Pearl Buck's husband Richard J. Walsh, as editor of Asia, included illustrations with Buck's work that was published there in serial or complete form. However, as editor and later president of the John Day Company, he did not include illustrations in the subsequent hardcover editions of these novels. When Ernest Hemingway's novella \"The Old Man and the Sea\" was first published in \"Life\" magazine in 1952, it was illustrated with blue-tinted drawings by Noel Sickles. These illustrations were not included in its first publication in volume form, published by Charles Scribner's Sons. \nIn the middle of the 20th century, the comic strip using visual images to convey action were a great influence on children and young people. Comic books had a unique storytelling potential.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1841430", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1841430", "title": "Narrative film", "text": "Narrative film\n\nNarrative film, fictional film or fiction film is a film that tells a fictional or fictionalized story, event or narrative. In this style of film, believable narratives and characters help convince the audience that the unfolding fiction is real. Lighting and camera movement, among other cinematic elements, have become increasingly important in these films. Great detail goes into the screenplays of narratives, as these films rarely deviate from the predetermined behaviours and lines of the classical style of screenplay writing to maintain a sense of realism. Actors must deliver dialogue and action in a believable way, so as to persuade the audience that the film is real life.\n\nProbably the first fictional film ever made was the Lumière's \"L'Arroseur arrosé\", which was first screened at the Grand Café Capucines on December 28, 1895. A year later in 1896, Alice Guy-Blaché directed the fictional film \"La fee aux choux\". Yet perhaps the best known of early fictional films is Georges Méliès’s \"A Trip to the Moon\" from 1902. Most films previous to this had been merely moving images of everyday occurrences, such as \"L'Arrivée d'un train en gare de La Ciotat\" by Auguste and Louis Lumière. Méliès was one of the first directors to progress cinematic technology, which paved the way for narratives as style of film. Narrative films have come so far since their introduction that film genres such as comedy or Western films, were, and continue to be introduced as a way to further categorize these films.\n\nNarrative cinema is usually contrasted to films that present information, such as a nature documentary, as well as to some experimental films (works such as \"Wavelength\" by Michael Snow, \"Man with a Movie Camera\" by Dziga Vertov, or films by Chantal Akerman). In some instances pure documentary films, while nonfiction, may nonetheless recount a story. As genres evolve, from fiction film and documentary a one emerged, docufiction.\n\nMany films are based on real occurrences, however these too fall under the category of a “narrative film” rather than a documentary. This is because films based on real occurrences are not simply footage of the occurrence, but rather hired actors portraying an adjusted, often more dramatic, retelling of the occurrence (such as \"21\" by Robert Luketic).\n\nUnlike literary fiction, which is typically based on characters, situations and events that are entirely imaginary/fictional/hypothetical, cinema always has a real referent, called the \"pro-filmic\", which encompasses everything existing and done in front of the camera.\n\nSince the emergence of classical Hollywood style in the early 20th century, during which films were selected to be made based on the popularity of the genre, stars, producers, and directors involved, narrative, usually in the form of the feature film, has held dominance in commercial cinema and has become popularly synonymous with \"the movies.\" Classical, invisible filmmaking (what is often called realist fiction) is central to this popular definition. This key element of this invisible filmmaking lies in continuity editing.\n\n\n"}

After Mason's client is charged with murder, during the preliminary hearing for the trial Mason would establish his client's innocence by dramatically demonstrating the guilt of another character. The real murderer would nearly always break down and confess to the crime in the courtroom, often while on the witness stand.\n\nThe Perry Mason syndrome purports that, due to the oversimplified manner in which trial proceedings were presented on the popular crime drama \"Perry Mason\", jurors who watched the program would enter trials with misconceptions about how the legal process works. Some argue that the Perry Mason syndrome greatly reinforced the presumption of innocence of the defendant, which may have been problematic when the defendant was guilty. Others argue that, because Perry Mason was often able to cause witnesses to confess, jurors would expect similar \"Perry Mason moments\" to occur in real trials as well. This shifted the burden of proof from the prosecution to the defense. In one case, a juror told the defense attorney that the jury had voted to convict the defendant because the prosecution's key witness did not confess during cross-examination.\n\nThe Perry Mason syndrome has been cited as a reason some defendants would choose to appear \"pro se\"—representing oneself in court rather than being represented by a lawyer. The simplified portrayals of trials on the television series led some defendants to underestimate the seriousness of their predicaments. Consistent viewers of the show may have also believed that they had gained an intimate understanding of the United States legal system and would be able to represent themselves better than an attorney could. This effect may have been exacerbated by the tendency for news media to oversimplify their coverage of trial proceedings.\n\n"}
{"id": "274834", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=274834", "title": "Pin-up model", "text": "Pin-up model\n\nA pin-up model (known as a pin-up girl for a female and less commonly male pin-up for a male) is a model whose mass-produced pictures see wide appeal as popular culture. Pin-ups are intended for informal display, i.e. meant to be \"pinned-up\" on a wall. Pin-up models may be glamour models, fashion models, or actors. These pictures are also sometimes known as cheesecake photos. Cheesecake was an American slang word, that was considered a publicly acceptable term for seminude women because pin-up was considered taboo in the early twentieth century.\n\nThe term \"pin-up\" may refer to drawings, paintings, and other illustrations as well as photographs (see the list of pin-up artists). The term was first attested to in English in 1941; however, the practice is documented back at least to the 1890s. Pin-up images could be cut out of magazines or newspapers, or on a postcard or lithograph. Such pictures often appear on walls, desks, or calendars. Posters of pin-ups were mass-produced, and became popular from the mid 20th century.\n\nMale pin-ups were less common than their female counterparts throughout the 20th century, although a market for homoerotica has always existed as well as pictures of popular male celebrities targeted at women or girls. Examples include James Dean and Jim Morrison.\n\nBeginning in the early nineteenth century, pin-up modeling had \"theatrical origins\", burlesque performers and actresses sometimes used photographic advertisement as business cards to advertise shows. These adverts and business cards could often be found backstage in almost every theater's green room, pinned-up or stuck into \"frames of the looking-glasses, in the joints of the gas-burners, and sometimes lying on-top of the sacred cast-case itself.\" Understanding the power of photographic advertisements to promote their shows, burlesque women self-constructed their identity to make themselves visible. Being recognized not only within the theater itself but also outside challenged the conventions of women's place and women's potential in the public sphere. \"To understand both the complicated identity and the subversive nature of the 19th-century actress, one must also understand that the era's views on women's potential were inextricably tied to their sexuality, which in turn was tied to their level of visibility in the public sphere: regardless of race, class or background, it was generally assumed that the more public the woman, the more 'public,' or available, her sexuality, according to historian Maria Elena Buszek. Being sexually fantasized, famous actresses in early 20th-century film were both drawn and photographed and put on posters to be sold for personal entertainment. Among the celebrities who were considered sex symbols, one of the most popular early pin-up girls was Betty Grable, whose poster was ubiquitous in the lockers of G.I.s during World War II.\n\nIn Europe, prior to the First World War, the likes of Fernande Barrey (aka \"Miss Fernande\"), were arguably the world's first pin-ups as is known in the modern sense. Miss Barrey displayed ample cleavage and full frontal nudity. Her pictures were cherished by soldiers on both sides of the First World War conflict.\nOther pin-ups were artwork depicting idealized versions of what some thought a particularly beautiful or attractive woman should look like. An early example of the latter type was the Gibson girl, a representation of the New Woman drawn by Charles Dana Gibson. \"Because the New Woman was symbolic of her new ideas about her sex, it was inevitable that she would also come to symbolize new ideas about sexuality.\" Unlike the photographed actresses and dancers generations earlier, fantasy gave artists the freedom to draw women in many different ways. The 1932 Esquire \"men's\" magazine featured many drawings and \"girlie\" cartoons but was most famous for its \"Vargas girls\". Prior to World War II they were praised for their beauty and less focus was on their sexuality. However, during the war, the drawings transformed into women playing dress-up in military drag and drawn in seductive manners, like that of a child playing with a doll. The Vargas girls became so popular that from 1942–46, owing to a high volume of military demand, \"9 million copies of the magazine-without adverts and free of charge was sent to American troops stationed overseas and in domestic bases.\" The Vargas Girls were adapted as nose art on many World War II bomber and fighter aircraft; Generally, they were considered inspiring, and not seen negatively, or as prostitutes, but mostly as inspiring female patriots that were helpful for good luck.\n\nAmong the other well-known artists specializing in the field were Earle K. Bergey, Enoch Bolles, Gil Elvgren, George Petty, Rolf Armstrong, Zoë Mozert, Duane Bryers and Art Frahm. Notable contemporary pin-up artists include Olivia De Berardinis, known for her pin-up art of Bettie Page and her pieces in \"Playboy\".\n\nMany people believe that since its beginnings the pin-up “...has presented women with models for expressing and finding pleasure in their sexual subjectivity”.\n\nAccording to Joanne Meyerowitz in \"Women, Cheesecake, and Borderline Material\" an article in \"Journal of Women's History\", \"As sexual images of women multiplied in the popular culture, women participated actively in constructing arguments to endorse as well as protest them.\"\n\nAs early as 1869, women have been supporters and protesters of the pin-up. Female supporters of early pin-up content considered these to be a \"positive post-Victorian rejection of bodily shame and a healthy respect for female beauty.\"\n\nAdditionally, pin-up allows for women to change the everyday culture. The models “...succeed in the feminist aim of changing the rigid, patriarchal terms”.\n\nIt has further been argued by some critics that in the early 20th century, these drawings of women helped define certain body images—such as being clean, being healthy, and being wholesome—and were enjoyed by both men and women; as time progressed these images changed from respectable to illicit.\n\nConversely, female protesters argued that these images were corrupting societal morality and saw these public sexual displays of women as lowering the standards of womanhood, destroying their dignity, reducing them to mere objects to pleasure men and therefore harmful to both women and young adolescents.\n\nPin-up modeling is a subculture that is invested in promoting positive body images and a love for one's sexuality, “...pin-up would also find ways to… encourage the erotic self-awareness and self expression of real women\".\n\nThe classic style of the pin-up originates back from the 1940s. Due to the shortages of materials during WWII, this period of makeup is considered the \"natural beauty\" look. The US was immersed in war-time economy, which put distribution restrictions on consumer goods. General rationing was supported; women applied mild amounts of products. Despite the rations, \"Women were encouraged to keep buying lipstick and to send letters to the front covered in 'lipstick kisses' to boost the morale of the soldiers.\"\n\nThe products consisted of:\n\n\n\"having a sun-kissed glow was popular among white women.\n\n\n\nLipstick \"turned into a symbol of resilient femininity in the face of danger\" and was seen as a way to boost morale during the war. The shape of the lip was also iconic of the 1940s. The lips were painted on to look plumper, a broad outline of the lip was added for roundness. This fuller look is known as the \"Hunter’s Bow\", invented by Max Factor.\n\nThe pin curl is a staple of the pin-up style, \"women utilized pin curls for their main hair curling technique\". Originating in the 1920s from the \"water-waving technique\", the hair style of the 1940s consisted of a fuller, gentle curl. The drying technique consists of curling a damp piece of hair, from the end to the root and pin in place. Once the curl is dry, it is brushed through to create the desired soft curl, with a voluminous silhouette.\n\nVictory rolls are also a distinctive hairstyle of the pin-up. The Victory roll is curled inward and swept off the face and pinned into place on the top of the head. Soft curls, achieved through the pin curl technique, finish off the look of pin-up.\n\nAs a makeup style, the classic pin-up underwent a revival in modern fashion. The red lip and winged eyeliner made a re-emergence in 2010, with singer, Katy Perry being the most accessible example of modern pin-up makeup.\n\nThere is a lack of representation in the media of women of color as pin-up models, even though they were influential to the construction of the style and were just as glamorous.\n\nAs a makeup style, it is simple and sleek makeup, that is noticeable and glamorous.\n\nAlthough pin-up modeling is associated with World War II and the 1950s, it has developed more recently into a subculture which can be seen represented in the styles of some celebrities and public figures. Pamela Anderson was considered the \"perennial pin-up\" due to decades worth of modeling for Hugh Hefner's Playboy Magazine. The American singer Lana Del Rey, whose style is comparable to that of the classic pin-up model, has performed a song called \"Pin Up Galore\". Beyoncé has recorded a song titled \"Why Don’t You Love Me\" which pays tribute to the pin-up queen of the 1950s, Bettie Page. The burlesque performer Dita Von Teese is often referred to as a modern pin-up. She has appeared in a biographical film about Bettie Page, \"Bettie Page Reveals All,\" in which Von Teese helps to define pin-up. Katy Perry makes use of the ideas associated with pin-up modeling, and has included these in music videos and costumes. The Victoria's Secret Fashion Show can be comparable to burlesque show, whereas their yearly advent calendar can compare to pin-up in general. \n\nThe pin-up modeling subculture has produced magazines and forums dedicated to its community. \"Delicious Dolls\", a magazine that began in 2011 and has both a print and digital version, was described in 2015 as \"the most-liked\" pin-up magazine in the world. One of the magazine's mission statements is \"to promote and showcase retro and modern pin up girls\". The magazine supports pin-up-related events throughout the United States and allows anyone to be featured in the magazine as long as they have worked with an approved photographer. Within this subculture there are opportunities to perform in pin-up contests, including one which takes place during the Viva Las Vegas rockabilly festival. The goal of the contest is \"not one that is based solely on popularity or cosmetic appeal, but one that includes inner beauty as well\". Women of \"all shapes and sizes\" are encouraged to participate, and winners are judged on their biographies, pastimes, and work they do outside of the pin-up hobby. They do not perform, but rather are judged on their authenticity, originality, overall styling presentation, crowd appeal, and stage presence.\n\nThough Marilyn Monroe and Bettie Page are often cited as the classic pin-up, there were many women of color who were also considered to be impactful. In the 1920s two of the most notable Black burlesque dancers were Josephine Baker and Lottie Graves. Despite the little history on Black burlesque dancers, Josephine Baker and Lottie Graves are a good starting point for evaluating women of color in pin-up. Dorothy Dandridge and Eartha Kitt also added to the pin-up style of their time, using their looks, fame, and personal success. African-American pin-up finally had a platform when the magazine, Jet, was created in 1951. Jet supported pin-up as they had a full page feature called, \"Beauty of the Week\", where African-American women posed in a swimsuits and such. This was intended to showcase the beauty these women possessed as they lived in a world where their skin color was under constant scrutiny. It was not until 1965 that Jennifer Jackson became the first African American to be published in \"Playboy\" as Playmate of the Month. And it was not until 1990 that \"Playboy\"’s Playmate of the Year was an African-American woman, Renee Tennison. Historically, women of color in pin-up are still not as common as their white counterparts. However, the recent revival of pin-up style has propelled many women of color today to create and dabble with the classic pin-up look to create their own standards of beauty. In Jim Linderman’s self-published book, \"Secret History of the Black Pin Up\", he describes the lives and experiences of African-American pin-up models.\n\nNotes\nCitations\nBibliography\n\n"}
{"id": "11124922", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11124922", "title": "ROCKRGRL", "text": "ROCKRGRL\n\nROCKRGRL was the first national publication for female musicians in the United States. Created by Carla DeSantis, the magazine purely focused on women in music and highlighted the artistic diversity of women musicians, often overlooked in mainstream culture. The magazine ran for eleven years, and the strength of its message inspired two pioneering \"ROCKRGRL\" conferences that showcased, celebrated, and addressed the state of the music industry for female artists.\n\nIn December 2008, the ROCKRGRL Magazine and conference archives were acquired by Schlesinger Library at the Radcliffe Institute, Harvard University, to be included in their collection of American Women’s History artifacts.\n\n\"ROCKRGRL\" was started by Carla DeSantis (aka Carla DeSantis Black) in 1994 in San Mateo, California as part of the zine movement to provide a third-wave feminist perspective on women in music.\n\nCommenting on the magazine’s founding, DeSantis recalled, “One issue of \"Rolling Stone\" was about Women Who Rock, and the writer asked everyone what their favorite perfume was, not music. Women were really shut out of music magazines like they didn’t exist.”\n\n\"ROCKRGRL\" started out as a 14-page, black-and-white photocopied zine. Its first issue, which hit stands in 1995, featured Gretchen Seager on the cover along with articles about that dog., the Go-Go's, Queen Latifah, and Au Pairs. In 1999, \"ROCKRGRL\" became a full-color glossy bi-monthly magazine.\n\nThroughout its lifespan, many famous and influential women appeared on the cover, including Justine Frischmann, Shirley Manson, Veruca Salt, Tori Amos, Johnette Napolitano, Courtney Love, Kathleen Hanna, Joan Jett, Kat Bjelland, Samantha Maloney, Tegan and Sara, Jessicka, Aimee Mann, Sleater-Kinney and Marianne Faithfull.\n\nIn the fall of 2005, DeSantis announced that issue number 57 would be the final issue of \"ROCKRGRL\". Although single issues, merchandise and Discoveries CDs could be purchased through the site, they were no longer accepting subscriptions. However, full sets, all 57 issues of ROCKRGRL are now part of the collection at The Smithsonian in Washington, D.C. and other prestigious colleges and institutions including Harvard, Duke, Cornell, UCLA, University of Washington, Radcliffe Institute, Smith, Oberlin, Rutgers, University of Texas Austin, the New York Public Library.\n\n\"ROCKRGRL\" billed itself as, \"a real departure from the condescending and patronizing tone found in other \"women in music\" magazines and web sites. No beauty tips or guilt trips here — just shop talk with fascinating artists.\"\n\nFrom its inception, \"ROCKRGRL\" created an atmosphere for women to address music industry sexism head-on. Here is an example from Gretchen Seager of Mary's Danish who appeared on the magazine's first cover:\nDeSantis recalled:So many of the stories that women were able to tell in ROCKRGRL were stories they weren’t able to tell in any place else. What was different about ROCKRGRL was that a lot of the artists we talked to had cautionary tales. My favorite artists to talk to are the ones who can talk honestly about what happened. They were dropped by their label – why did that happen? Bands broke up, why did that happen? In ROCKRGRL, what I was looking for were career arcs and career stories – how people got started, what their career was like, how it went for them, and what unusual things they did to be successful.\n\nROCKRGRL peaked at roughly 20,000 in circulation, domestic and international, during the years of 2002 and 2003. The magazine was carried by most major retail chains, including Virgin Records, Tower Records, Barnes & Noble, Borders, and Hastings Entertainment. \"ROCKRGRL\" could also be found in most feminist bookstores. During 2005, the cost for a yearly subscription was $14.95.\n\nDeSantis explained:\nI wanted ROCKRGRL to be in the hands of musicians. It was important to me that it found women who were playing music.\n\nDeSantis, one of the nation's leading advocates for women in rock, has also produced two highly successful and critically acclaimed \"ROCKRGRL\" Music Conferences which took place in Seattle in 2000 and 2005 respectively.\nBased on the business model of SXSW, the goal of the ROCKRGRL Music Conferences was to give women working in the music industry an opportunity to network and allow those who were just starting out an opportunity to meet those who influenced them. With three nights of music showcases featuring female artists in all styles, a special Woman of Valor award dinner, two full days of panels, workshops and an artist-friendly trade show, the ROCKRGRL Music Conferences was an opportunity for women working in music to meet, mix and mingle in the city of Seattle.\n\n“We had 250 female bands perform in clubs and coffeeshops and all kinds of places in downtown Seattle. We had really A-list artists come and speak and perform. And all levels performed, actually. It was eclectic and interesting. It was a really big deal because for me all the people I admired were in the same room,” said DeSantis.\n\nThe diverse line-up of speakers and performers at the ROCKRGRL Music Conference included such musical luminaries as Patti Smith, Bonnie Raitt, Courtney Love, Ronnie Spector (The Ronettes), Amy Ray (Indigo Girls), Ann Wilson, Johnette Napolitano (Concrete Blonde), Kathy Valentine (The Go-Go's), Wanda Jackson, The Gossip, Jessicka (Scarling. / Jack Off Jill), Exene Cervenka, Eliza Gilkyson, Rosie Flores, Carol Kaye, Wanda Jackson and hundreds more. During the 2005 conference, keynote speaker Patti Smith received the Woman of Valor award on the 30th anniversary of the release of her debut album, \"Horses\". The previous recipient of this award was Heart. \nBy 2005, sponsorship for the second ROCKRGRL Music Conference had diminished due emerging economic downturn. Despite this, conference attendance remained high.\n\nDaisy Rock Guitars, a subsidiary of Schecter Guitars, is company that makes guitars for girls exclusively. Its first three prototype models debuted in November 2000 at Seattle’s first \"ROCKRGRL\" Conference.\n\n\"ROCKRGRL\" Magazine has been lauded in feature articles in \"The LA Times\", \"New York Times\", \"Seventeen\", \"Jane\", \"Seattle Times\", \"Mercer Island Reporter\", \"Village Voice\", \"San Francisco Chronicle\", \"Boston Rock\", \"Asbury Park Press\", \"Chicago Tribune\", \"The Stranger\", \"Bitch\", and \"Bust\".\n\nDeSantis furthers:\nWomen’s voices have been repressed for many years in music. Most of the pop stars we see are singing songs written by men, or written for them. My day, in the 80’s, there were lots of women in music who were writing their own material...What the magazine provided was an opportunity for women who weren’t only singers to find their voices through the magazine. When there aren’t many women doing something, it’s hard to have them as role models. Different ages, different styles of music – they demonstrate that women have a lot to say, and because mainstream music magazines weren’t exploring that, it needed to be explored in some way. The more we see woman musicians, the less of a novelty they will be.\nA ‘’ROCKRGRL Day’’ was held at Musicians’ Institute in Los Angeles in 2003.\n\n"}

{"id": "43954668", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43954668", "title": "Soggade Chinni Nayana", "text": "Soggade Chinni Nayana\n\nSoggade Chinni Nayana () is a 2016 Indian Telugu-language supernatural drama film directed by Kalyan Krishna Kurasala. In addition to producing the film under his Annapurna Studios banner, Akkineni Nagarjuna played dual roles. Ramya Krishnan and Lavanya Tripathi were the film's female leads. Nassar, Pithamagan Mahadevan, Sampath Raj and Brahmanandam played key supporting roles.\n\nWritten by Ram Mohan P, \"Soggade Chinni Nayana\" revolves around the soul of Bangarraju, a flirtatious zamindar whom Yama (the god of the underworld) sends back to earth to reconcile his son (Ram \"Ramu\" Mohan) and his wife Seetha; they are on the brink of divorce. In the process, he learns about his death and its connection with a local Shiva temple.\n\nP. S. Vinod and Siddhardh Ramaswami provided the cinematography, and Anup Rubens composed the film's soundtrack and background score. Prawin Pudi edited the film. Principal photography for the film began on 19 November 2014 after it was launched in Hyderabad, and wrapped on 4 October 2015. Most of the film was shot in and around Rajahmundry and Mysore.\n\nProduced on a budget of 150200 million, \"Soggade Chinni Nayana\" was released worldwide on 15 January 2016 during the Makar Sankranti festival season in 800-900 screens. It received positive reviews from critics and was commercially successful, earning 750 million globally. The film was remade in Kannada as \"Upendra Matte Baa\" (2017), starring Upendra, Prema and Sruthi Hariharan in the lead roles.\n\nRam \"Ramu\" Mohan is a socially-inept cardiologist practicing in the United States. His wife, Seetha, feels lonely since Ramu pays very little attention to her because of his work. They decide to divorce and leave for Sivapuram, Rajahmundry, where Ramu's mother Satyabhama lives. Satyabhama, shocked to learn that Ramu and Seetha are divorcing, shouts at a portrait of her deceased husband Bangarraju (a benevolent, flirtatious zamindar who died nearly 30 years ago in an accident).\n\nBangarraju's soul is in Naraka, where he continues to flirt. Yama, at Shiva's command, sends him back to earth because there is a mission only he can fulfil. Bangarraju, who can be seen and heard only by Satyabhama, tries to solve his family's problems. After several unsuccessful attempts, Bangarraju possesses Ramu's body on his birthday. He meets Ramu's young female cousins, and invites them to his home. On his way back Ramu meets Suri, a frightened drunk who runs away as Ramu and Bangarraju look identical. To free himself from guilt, Suri later admits that he murdered Bangarraju with a lorry after he was bribed. Before he can disclose more details, Suri dies in an accident and Bangarraju learns that his family is in danger. Ramu spends quality time with his cousins, making Seetha jealous.\n\nBangarraju is confronted by Satyabhama, who is unaware of recent events. He suggests that she help Seetha impress Ramu. At Satyabhama's suggestion, Ramu and Seetha go to a theatre to watch a film. When she is taunted, Ramu (possessed by Bangarraju) overpowers her tormenters. Seetha is pleasantly surprised, since Ramu failed to confront the same group earlier in a similar situation. The couple slowly grow closer, and Seetha realises that Ramu does love her. Bangarraju learns from Athmanandam, a godman who can communicate with souls, that his uncle Rudraraju masterminded his murder. Rudraraju and his cousin, Veerababu, wanted to steal jewellery from a 1,000-year old temple to Shiva. They murdered Bangarraju, bribing Suri to silence him.\n\nAfter Rudraraju's son dies when he is bitten by a divine snake, a tantrik warns that only Bangarraju's descendants can open the lock; others would be killed by the snake. The tantrik captures Bangarraju's soul and gives a few threads to Sampath, Rudraraju's grandson, telling him to tie them to the hands of every member of Bangarraju's family to keep his soul from communicating with them. After Sampath and the others leave, the snake kills the tantrik and saves Bangarraju's soul.\n\nBangarraju reaches the temple, where Satyabhama can neither see nor hear him and he cannot possess Ramu. Rudraraju and Sampath attack Ramu and Seetha after the jewellery is removed from the treasury. Rudraraju tells his henchmen to put the couple in a car with the jewellery, which will make the villagers think that they are the thieves. The thread to Ramu's hand comes loose, and Bangarraju possesses him. Bangarraju fights them and retrieves the jewellery before leaving Ramu, who operates on an injured Seetha in a nearby hospital. Satyabhama removes the thread and can see Bangarraju. Ramu and Seetha reconcile, and Yama orders Bangarraju to come back in accordance with Shiva's instructions. When Satyabhama begs Bangarraju to stay, Yama gives him a chance to wipe away her tears. He asks her to keep smiling and live happily for his sake, and returns to Naraka.\n\nDuring the production of \"Manam\" (2014), producer and lead actor Akkineni Nagarjuna liked the portions which were set against a village backdrop. He developed an interest in making a film based on Indian village life, feeling that audiences would see a \"new, yet traditional lifestyle, something fresh and interesting\". After sketching the basic idea, Ram Mohan P approached Virinchi Varma to direct the film; Mohan produced Varma's directorial debut, \"Uyyala Jampala\" (2013). Varma declined the offer, since he wanted to film his own script. Nagarjuna then gave the synopsis to Kalyan Krishna Kurasala, who completed the script within a month. Kurasala was confirmed as director, marking his directorial debut in Telugu cinema. Nagarjuna approved the inclusion of supernatural elements, such as the ghost of Bangarraju and the divine snake guarding his family, on the condition that they be positive and not frightening.\n\nHe played two roles: Bangarraju, a flirtatious zamindar, and his son Ramu (a socially-inept doctor, born the day after Bangarraju's death). Ramu's character was based on Umakanth, a contestant on \"Meelo Evaru Koteeswarudu\" (a game show hosted by Nagarjuna). As Bangarraju, Nagarjuna wore a dhoti and a 1959 watch; both were worn by his father, Akkineni Nageswara Rao, in his many village-film starring roles. Ramya Krishnan and Lavanya Tripathi were the female leads; Pranitha Subhash and Sonal Chauhan were considered before Tripathi was cast. Initially skeptical about playing a married woman, Tripathi agreed after listening to a script reading at the Annapurna Studios office. In a January 2016 interview with \"The Hindu\", Nagarjuna mentioned that Bangarraju and Satyabhama (played by Ramya) would be a \"hot, romantic\" couple, in contrast to the \"innocent, cute\" Ramu and Seetha (played by Tripathi). After being cast, Tripathi said that her character, a traditional Indian girl, would have a romantic touch.\n\nL. Satyanand wrote \"Soggade Chinni Nayana\" screenplay, and Anup Rubens composed its soundtrack and score. P. S. Vinod and Siddhardh Ramaswami were the cinematographers. Prawin Pudi and Ravinder Reddy were in charge of the film's editing and art direction respectively. A launch ceremony was held on 19 November 2014 at Annapurna Studios in Hyderabad, and principal photography began several hours later on a set erected in the Studios' premises. Anushka Shetty made a cameo appearance in the film. Hamsa Nandini confirmed her inclusion in the cast in December 2014; she played a supporting role and participated in a song with Nagarjuna. Raju Sundaram, Vishwa and Raghu choreographed the songs. Television presenter Anasuya Bharadwaj played Nagarjuna's cousin after Swati Reddy backed out, citing scheduling conflicts. Diksha Panth also made a cameo appearance; her inclusion was confirmed in August 2015.\n\nNagarjuna had to simultaneously complete his portions of \"Oopiri\" (2016) and \"Meelo Evaru Koteeswarudu\" during 2015. Filming resumed on 11 February 2015 after completion of two schedules. Principal photography continued in Mysore on 10 March 2015 after key sequences were filmed in and around Rajahmundry. Several scenes were filmed at a 1,500-year-old Vishnu temple in Mysore. In September 2015, with \"Soggade Chinni Nayana\" nearing completion, its film unit told Indo-Asian News Service that a few key scenes would be re-filmed on the advice of writer Sai Madhav Burra (who changed some scenes to suit the story). The re-filming delayed its release. Principal photography wrapped on 4 October 2015 in Mysore, and post-production began shortly afterwards. \"Soggade Chinni Nayana\" was produced on a budget of 150200 million.\n\n\"Soggade Chinni Nayana\" was released worldwide on 15 January 2016 in 800-900 screens. Three other Telugu films (\"Nannaku Prematho\", \"Express Raja\" and \"Dictator\") were released at the same time, which affected its distribution. Nagarjuna defended his release decision, saying that the film's rural backdrop made it suitable for the Makar Sankranti season (a harvest festival). He added, \"I announced the date two and a half months ago and blocked the theatres. There’s nothing I can do now ...\" Global Cinema acquired the film's theatrical rights for the Nizam region.\n\nThe film received positive reviews from critics. Suresh Kavirayani of \"Deccan Chronicle\" gave \"Soggade Chinni Nayana\" four out of five stars, praising Kurasala's narrative clarity and calling it \"wonderful overall\" for its consistent tempo. Sangeetha Devi Dundoo, in \"The Hindu\", gave the film 3.5 stars out of five and said it was set in a \"familiar, comfort zone\" which \"guarantees a lot of fun\". Dundoo found the temple-and-snake subplot engaging. Pranita Jonnalagedda of \"The Times of India\" also gave the film 3.5 stars out of five, calling it \"so uncomplicated, unfussy and unpretentious\" that viewers \"get hooked to its simplicity\".\n\nSify gave \"Soggade Chinni Nayana\" three stars out of five, comparing the film to Nageswara Rao's 1978 film \"Sri Rama Raksha\". The reviewer praised Nagarjuna's performance and Kurasala's narrative clarity. L. Ravichander of \"The Hans India\" gave it a negative review, calling it an obsolete film with crass humor. Ravichander called Ramya's performance the \"lone bright spot ... all grace, charm and vigour.\"\n\n\"Soggade Chinni Nayana\" had an average 70-percent theatre occupancy rate and grossed 55 million (with a distributor share of 39 million) at the AP-Nizam box office on its first day. In three days, the film grossed 130 million and collected a distributor share of 85 million at the AP-Nizam box office. The three-day global gross passed 200 million, with a distributor share of 141 million. According to trade analyst Taran Adarsh, \"Soggade Chinni Nayana\" grossed US$535,183 (362 million) at the United States box office in its first weekend and was Nagarjuna's second-highest-grossing film in India (after \"Manam\"). In five days, the film grossed $629,303 (42.9 million) at the U.S. box office after a significant decline. In its first week, \"Soggade Chinni Nayana\" grossed 347.4 million globally. With a distributor share of 228.3 million, it became profitable.\n\nAfter losing 30 screens to \"Airlift\", \"Soggade Chinni Nayana\" grossed $776,940 (52.7 million) in ten days at the U.S. box office. By the end of its second week, the film grossed 559.6 million globally and had a distributor share of 357.3 million. In its third week, after losing many screens due to new releases, the film retained 19 screens in the U.S. and grossed $827,918 (53.2 million) in 17 days. With a distributor share of 38 million on an investment of 6.5 million, \"Soggade Chinni Nayana\" became Nagarjuna's highest-grossing film in India. In 20 days, the film grossed 638.8 million globally and collected a distributor share of 404.8 million; it became one of the few Telugu films to cross the 40-crore (400 million) mark.\n\n\"Soggade Chinni Nayana\" retained seven screens in its fourth week in the U.S., grossing $837,089 (56.9 million) in 24 days. The film completed a 50-day-run in more than 75 theatres on 4 March 2016, a record for a Nagarjuna film. The global gross and distributor-share figures stood at 700 million and 440 million, respectively. It was estimated to have grossed over 750 million globally in its theatrical run.\n\nThe film was remade in Kannada as \"Upendra Matte Baa\" (2017), with Upendra, Prema and Sruthi Hariharan in the lead roles.\n\nThe six-song \"Soggade Chinni Nayana\" soundtrack was composed by Anup Rubens; however, its initial release had only five songs. Ramajogayya Sastry wrote the lyrics for two songs: \"Vasthane Vasthane\" and \"Untale\". Bhaskarabhatla, Balaji and Krishna Kanth wrote the lyrics of one song each. The title song was written by Anantha Sreeram and performed by Satya Yamini, Nuthana and Vinayak. The soundtrack, on Aditya Music, was released on 25 December 2015 with a promotional event at Shilpakala Vedika, Hyderabad.\n\nAccording to Karthik Srinivasan of \"The Hindu\", the hook of \"Dikka Dikka Dum Dum\" resembles one written by A. R. Rahman for the Tamil song \"Kaatre En Vasal\" from \"Rhythm\" (2000): \"Thulli varum kaatre, thulli varun kaatre, thaaimozhi pesu\". Srinivasan called its melody \"heady, raucous and very rhythmic\". Sangeetha Devi Dundoo from \"The Hindu\" wrote that Rubens' music complemented the film's rural backdrop. Sify called Rubens' music one of the film's biggest strengths, which \"perfectly gelled with the rustic storyline\".\n"}

{"id": "974312", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=974312", "title": "Ssireum", "text": "Ssireum\n\nSsireum (Hangul: 씨름) or Korean wrestling is a folk wrestling style and traditional national sport of Korea since the fourth century.\n\nIn the modern form each contestant wears a belt (satba) that wraps around the waist and the thigh. The competition employs a series of techniques, which inflict little harm or injury to the opponent: opponents lock on to each other's belt, and one achieves victory by bringing any part of the opponent's body above the knee to the ground.\n\nHistorically, with the introduction of Chinese culture, there have been other terms for \"wrestling\" in Korean used alongside \"ssireum\", such as \"gakjeo\" (각저:角抵), \"gakhui\" (각희:角戱), \"gakryeok\" (각력:角力), \"gakji\" (각지:角支), \"chiuhui\" (치우희:蚩尤戱), \"sangbak\" (상박:相撲), \"jaenggyo\" (쟁교:爭交). \n\"Gak\" (각:角), a commonly used prefix, seems to have originated from the combative act performed by horned animals such as oxen when competing against one another for the superiority of physical strength.\n\nThe earliest evidence of \"ssireum\", or \"Korean wrestling\", dates back to the Goguryeo period. Originally used in military applications, \"ssireum\" became a popular pastime of the people, including many Korean kings, during the Goryeo and Joseon periods.\n\nIn traditional life, Ssireum was a popular activity on the Korean holiday of Dano, the fifth day of the fifth lunar month, and tournaments are held in the summer and autumn. Ssireum competitions were also held on other days such as the Third Day of the Third Moon, the Eighth day of the Fourth Moon, Buddhist All Souls’ Day, etc.. The traditional prize for winning a tournament was an ox, a valuable commodity in agriculturally-oriented society, which symbolized the strength of the contestant.\n\nIn the 20th century, \"ssireum\" became a nationally televised sport in South Korea.\nThe first modern competition was held in 1912 at the Dansongsa theater in Seoul. \nKorean wrestling has been referred to as \"ssireum\" since the 1920s. The Pan Chosun Ssireum Federation was founded in 1927. Since 1947 the competition organised by the Ssireum Federation has been called the National Ssireum Championship Contest. Weight classes were introduced at the 12th National Ssireum Championship Contest, and revised in 1967. There are two traditional styles of Ssireum: a \"right sided\" style predominant in parts of the Gyunggi province, and Honam province of southern Korea, and a \"left side\" style favoured in Hamgyung province, Gyungsang province and Choonchong province. The difference depended on the way the \"satba\" was fastened. In 1994, the Korean Ssireum federation, chaired by Hong sup Kim, proposed the unification of Ssireum in a single style and left sided Ssireum was adopted as the official style to be used by all competitors.\n\nOn November 26, 2018, the Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Unesco inscribed traditional Korean wrestling, (ssirum/ssireum) following an unprecedented joint application by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea.\n\nSsireum is conducted within a circular ring, measuring approximately 7 meters in diameter, which is covered with mounded sand. The two contestants begin the match by kneeling on the sand in a grappling position (\"baro japki\"), each grabbing a belt—known as a \"satba\" (샅바)—which is wrapped around his opponent's waist and thigh. The wrestlers then rise while retaining their hold on the other's 'satba.' The match is awarded to the wrestler who forces the other contestant to touch the ground with any part of his body at knee level or higher. Unlike sumo, pushing your opponent outside of the ring does not warrant a win, just a restart. Normally, professional ssireum is contested in a best-out-of-three style match.\n\nThere are 3 judges, a chief referee and three sub referees. The chief judge is positioned inside the ring, whereas the sub referees are located on the outside of the ring, one to the right and others to the left. If an unfair judgment is called or the chief referee is unable to render a decision, the sub referees can request a revocation of the decision or a rematch. In addition, they can recommend the cessation of the match when an injury occurs. The referees’ decisions throughout the competition are absolute and held in the highest regard, meaning that athletes cannot challenge any judgments declared during the match.\n\nToday there are also women Ssireum wrestlers. Women wrestle only among themselves but follow the same rules (except that men are topless whereas women wear tops).\n\nThere are 4 weight classes in professional wrestling: flyweight (Taebaek, 75 kg), lightweight (Geumgang, 90 kg), middleweight (Halla, 105 kg), and heavyweight (Baekdu, under 160 kg), named after the four famous peaks in Korea.\n\nTraditionally Ssireum was contested with the top portion of the trousers rolled down to provide grip. The use of \"satba\" was invented with the birth of professional Ssireum in the mid-20th century. There is a movement to restore this traditional method of grip, in the spirit of maintaining its cultural and traditional roots, but it has met with some resistance as the use of \"satba\" has become entrenched in the modern form.\n\nThe professional league is dwindling in popularity and many wrestlers have turned their attention to mixed martial arts fighting, even though Ssireum involves no striking or submissions of any kind, as a means of making a living. Choi Hong-man, former champion of Ssireum, is enjoying notable success in the K-1 scene. Unfortunately, the future of professional Ssireum remains bleak, with only one team remaining. However, it can also be argued that Ssireum is beginning to undergo global expansion as a popular martial arts sport, alongside taekwondo and hapkido.\n\nIt is important to note the differences between Ssireum and sumo. Ssireum has remained largely a national/traditional sport. Physical hits such as slaps and blows are not permitted in Ssireum, though they are in sumo. In both sports, the competitors are often quite large, though Korean wrestlers tend to be leaner. However, size does not guarantee success in either sport. Although both sports are quite similar, they differ in characteristics as well as values.\n\nThe national governing body of the sport in Korea, Korean Ssireum Organization, has made a claim that Ssireum is characterized as a \"peaceful competition focusing on harmony and unison\", reflecting the \"philosophical outlook of the Korean Race\".\n\n1st Asia Ssireum Championship and 5th World Ssireum Championship, which took place simultaneously at Thuwana National Indoor Stadium in Yangon, Myanmar, from September 18 to 23 of 2015. \nThe second World Ssireum Championships are set to take place in Siauliai, Lithuania Friday, where a total of 120 wrestlers and 80 representatives and officials from 40 countries will participate in the two-day event, according to the World Ssireum Federation (WSF). The first championships were held in September 2008 during the Busan World TreX-Games. (2008 is unofficial)\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1424086", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1424086", "title": "Theater in the United States", "text": "Theater in the United States\n\nTheater in the United States is part of the European theatrical tradition that dates back to ancient Greek theatre and is heavily influenced by the British theatre. The central hub of the US theater scene is New York City, with its divisions of Broadway, Off-Broadway, and Off-Off-Broadway. Many movie and television stars got their big break working in New York productions. Outside New York, many cities have professional regional or resident theater companies that produce their own seasons, with some works being produced regionally with hopes of eventually moving to New York. US theater also has an active community theatre culture, which relies mainly on local volunteers who may not be actively pursuing a theatrical career.\n\nBefore the first English colony was established in 1607, there were Spanish dramas and Native American tribes that performed theatrical events.\n\nAlthough a theater was built in Williamsburg, Virginia in 1716, and the original Dock Street Theatre opened in Charleston, South Carolina in 1736, the birth of professional theater in America may have begun when Lewis Hallam arrived with his theatrical company in Williamsburg in 1752. Lewis and his brother William, who arrived in 1754, were the first to organize a complete company of actors in Europe and bring them to the colonies. They brought a repertoire of plays popular in London at the time, including \"Hamlet\", \"Othello\", \"The Recruiting Officer\", and \"Richard III\". \"The Merchant of Venice\" was their first performance, shown initially on September 15, 1752. Encountering opposition from religious organizations, Hallam and his company left for Jamaica in 1754 or 1755. Soon after, Lewis Hallam, Jr., founded the American Company, opened a theater in New York, and presented the first professionally mounted American play—\"The Prince of Parthia\", by Thomas Godfrey—in 1767.\n\nIn the 18th century, laws forbidding the performance of plays were passed in Massachusetts in 1750, in Pennsylvania in 1759, and in Rhode Island in 1761, and plays were banned in most states during the American Revolutionary War at the urging of the Continental Congress. In 1794, president of Yale College, Timothy Dwight IV, in his \"Essay on the Stage\", declared that \"to indulge a taste for playgoing means nothing more or less than the loss of that most valuable treasure: the immortal soul.\"\n\nIn spite of such laws, however, a few writers tried their hand at playwriting. Most likely, the first plays written in America were by European-born authors—we know of original plays being written by Spaniards, Frenchmen and Englishmen dating back as early as 1567—although no plays were printed in America until Robert Hunter's \"Androboros\" in 1714. Still, in the early years, most of the plays produced came from Europe; only with Godfrey's \"The Prince of Parthia\" in 1767 do we get a professionally produced play written by an American, although it was a last-minute substitute for Thomas Forrest's comic opera \"The Disappointment; or, The Force of Credulity\", and although the first play to treat American themes seriously, \"Ponteach; or, the Savages of America\" by Robert Rogers, had been published in London a year earlier. 'Cato', a play about revolution, was performed for George Washington and his troops at Valley Forge in the winter of 1777–1778.\n\nThe Revolutionary period was a boost for dramatists, for whom the political debates were fertile ground for both satire, as seen in the works of Mercy Otis Warren and Colonel Robert Munford, and for plays about heroism, as in the works of Hugh Henry Brackenridge. The post-war period saw the birth of American social comedy in Royall Tyler's \"The Contrast\", which established a much-imitated version of the \"Yankee\" character, here named \"Jonathan\". But there were no professional dramatists until William Dunlap, whose work as playwright, translator, manager and theater historian has earned him the title of \"Father of American Drama\"; in addition to translating the plays of August von Kotzebue and French melodramas, Dunlap wrote plays in a variety of styles, of which \"André\" and \"The Father; or, American Shandyism\" are his best.\n\nAt 825 Walnut Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is the Walnut Street Theatre, or, \"The Walnut.\" Founded in 1809 by the Circus of Pepin and Breschard, \"The Walnut\" is the oldest theater in America. The Walnut's first theatrical production, \"The Rivals\", was staged in 1812. In attendance were President Thomas Jefferson and the Marquis de Lafayette.\n\nProvincial theaters frequently lacked heat and minimal theatrical property (\"props\") and scenery. Apace with the country's westward expansion, some entrepreneurs operated floating theaters on barges or riverboats that would travel from town to town. A large town could afford a long \"run\"—or period of time during which a touring company would stage consecutive multiple performances—of a production, and in 1841, a single play was shown in New York City for an unprecedented three weeks.\n\nWilliam Shakespeare's works were commonly performed. American plays of the period were mostly melodramas, a famous example of which was \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\", adapted by George Aiken, from the novel of the same name by Harriet Beecher Stowe.\n\nIn 1821, William Henry Brown established the African Grove Theatre in New York City. It was the third attempt to have an African-American theater, but this was the most successful of them all. The company put on not only Shakespeare, but also staged the first play written by an African-American, \"The Drama of King Shotaway\". The theater was shut down in 1823. African-American theater was relatively dormant, except for the 1858 play \"The Escape; or, A Leap for Freedom\" by William Wells Brown, who was an ex-slave. African-American works would not be regarded again until the 1920s Harlem Renaissance.\n\nA popular form of theater during this time was the minstrel show, which featured white (and sometimes, especially after the Civil War, black) actors dressed in \"blackface (painting one's face, etc. with dark makeup to imitate the coloring of an African or African American).\" The players entertained the audience using comic skits, parodies of popular plays and musicals, and general buffoonery and slapstick comedy, all with heavy utilization of racial stereotyping and racist themes.\n\nThroughout the 19th century, theater culture was associated with hedonism and even violence, and actors (especially women), were looked upon as little better than prostitutes. Jessie Bond wrote that by the middle of the 19th century, \"The stage was at a low ebb, Elizabethan glories and Georgian artificialities had alike faded into the past, stilted tragedy and vulgar farce were all the would-be playgoer had to choose from, and the theatre had become a place of evil repute\". On April 15, 1865, less than a week after the end of the United States Civil War, Abraham Lincoln, while watching a play at Ford's Theater in Washington, D.C., was assassinated by a nationally popular stage-actor of the period, John Wilkes Booth.\n\nVictorian burlesque, a form of bawdy comic theater mocking high art and culture, was imported from England about 1860 and in America became a form of farce in which females in male roles mocked the politics and culture of the day. Criticized for its sexuality and outspokenness, this form of entertainment was hounded off the \"legitimate stage\" and found itself relegated to saloons and barrooms. The female producers, such as Lydia Thompson were replaced by their male counterparts, who toned down the politics and played up the sexuality, until the burlesque shows eventually became little more than pretty girls in skimpy clothing singing songs, while male comedians told raunchy jokes.\n\nThe drama of the pre-war period tended to be a derivative in form, imitating European melodramas and romantic tragedies, but native in content, appealing to popular nationalism by dramatizing current events and portraying American heroism. But playwrights were limited by a set of factors, including the need for plays to be profitable, the middle-brow tastes of American theater-goers, and the lack of copyright protection and compensation for playwrights. During this time, the best strategy for a dramatist was to become an actor and/or a manager, after the model of John Howard Payne, Dion Boucicault and John Brougham. This period saw the popularity of certain native character types, especially the \"Yankee\", the \"Negro\" and the \"Indian\", exemplified by the characters of Jonathan, Sambo and Metamora. Meanwhile, increased immigration brought a number of plays about the Irish and Germans, which often dovetailed with concerns over temperance and Roman Catholic. This period also saw plays about American expansion to the West (including plays about Mormonism) and about women's rights. Among the best plays of the period are James Nelson Barker's \"Superstition; or, the Fanatic Father\", Anna Cora Mowatt's \"Fashion; or, Life in New York\", Nathaniel Bannister's \"Putnam, the Iron Son of '76\", Dion Boucicault's \"The Octoroon; or, Life in Louisiana\", and Cornelius Mathews's \"Witchcraft; or, the Martyrs of Salem\". At the same time, America had created new dramatic forms in the Tom Shows, the showboat theater and the minstrel show.\n\nIn the postbellum North, theater flourished as a post-war boom allowed longer and more-frequent productions. The advent of American rail transport allowed production companies, its actors, and large, elaborate sets to travel easily between towns, which made permanent theaters in small towns feasible. The invention and practical application of electric lighting also led to changes to and improvements of scenery styles and the designing of theater interiors and seating areas.\n\nIn 1896, Charles Frohman, Al Hayman, Abe Erlanger, Mark Klaw, Samuel F. Flenderson, and J. Fred Zimmerman, Sr. formed the Theatrical Syndicate, which established systemized booking networks throughout the United States, and created a management monopoly that controlled every aspect of contracts and bookings until the turn of the 20th century, when the Shubert brothers founded rival agency, The Shubert Organization.\n\nFor playwrights, the period after the War brought more financial reward and aesthetic respect (including professional criticism) than was available earlier. In terms of form, spectacles, melodramas and farces remained popular, but poetic drama and romanticism almost died out completely due to the new emphasis upon realism, which was adopted by serious drama, melodrama and comedy alike. This realism was not quite the European realism of Ibsen's \"Ghosts\", but a combination of scenic realism (e.g., the \"Belasco Method\") with a less romantic view of life that accompanied the cultural turmoil of the period. The most ambitious effort towards realism during this period came from James Herne, who was influenced by the ideas of Ibsen, Hardy and Zola regarding realism, truth, and literary quality; his most important achievement, \"Margaret Fleming\", enacts the principles he expounded in his essay \"Art for Truth's Sake in the Drama\". Although \"Fleming\" did not appeal to audiences—critics and audiences felt it dwelt too much on unseemly topics and included improper scenes, such as Margaret nursing her husband's bastard child onstage—other forms of dramatic realism were becoming more popular in melodrama (e.g., Augustin Daly's \"Under the Gaslight\") and in local color plays (Bronson Howard's \"Shenandoah\"). Other key dramatists during this period are David Belasco, Steele MacKaye, William Dean Howells, Dion Boucicault, and Clyde Fitch.\n\nVaudeville was common in the late 19th and early 20th century, and is notable for heavily influencing early film, radio, and television productions in the country. (This was born from an earlier American practice of having singers and novelty acts perform between acts in a standard play.) George Burns was a very long-lived American comedian who started out in the vaudeville community, but went on to enjoy a career running until the 1990s.\n\nSome vaudeville theaters built between about 1900 and 1920 managed to survive as well, though many went through periods of alternate use, most often as movie theaters until the second half of the century saw many urban populations decline and multiplexes built in the suburbs. Since that time, a number have been restored to original or nearly-original condition and attract new audiences nearly one hundred years later.\n\nBy the beginning of the 20th century, legitimate 1752 (non-vaudeville) theater had become decidedly more sophisticated in the United States, as it had in Europe. The stars of this era, such as Ethel Barrymore and John Barrymore, were often seen as even more important than the show itself. The advance of motion pictures also led to many changes in theater. The popularity of musicals may have been due in part to the fact the early films had no sound, and could thus not compete, until \"The Jazz Singer\" of 1927, which combined both talking and music in a moving picture. More complex and sophisticated dramas bloomed in this time period, and acting styles became more subdued. Even by 1915, actors were being lured away from theater and to the silver screen, and vaudeville was beginning to face stiff competition.\n\nWhile revues consisting of mostly unconnected songs, sketches, comedy routines, and dancing girls (Ziegfeld girls) dominated for the first 20 years of the 20th century, musical theater would eventually develop beyond this. One of the first major steps was \"Show Boat\", with music by Jerome Kern and lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein. It featured songs and non-musical scenes which were integrated to develop the show's plot. The next great step forward was \"Oklahoma!\", with lyrics by Hammerstein and music by Richard Rodgers. Its \"dream ballets\" used dance to carry forward the plot and develop the characters.\n\nAmateur performing groups have always had a place alongside professional acting companies. The Amateur Comedy Club, Inc. was founded in New York City on April 18, 1884. It was organized by seven gentlemen who broke away from the Madison Square Dramatic Organization, a socially prominent company presided over by Mrs. James Brown Potter and David Belasco. The ACC staged its first performance on February 13, 1885. It has performed continuously ever since, making it the oldest, continuously performing theatrical society in the United States. Prominent New Yorkers who have been members of the ACC include Theodore, Frederick and John Steinway of the piano manufacturing family; Gordon Grant, the marine artist; Christopher La Farge, the architect; Van H. Cartmell, the publisher; Albert Sterner, the painter; and Edward Fales Coward, the theater critic and playwright. Elsie De Wolfe, Lady Mendl, later famous as the world's first professional interior decorator, acted in Club productions in the early years of the 20th Century, as did Hope Williams, and Julie Harris in the 1940s.\n\nEarly 20th century theater was dominated by the Barrymores—Ethel Barrymore, John Barrymore, and Lionel Barrymore. Other greats included Laurette Taylor, Jeanne Eagels, and Eva Le Gallienne.\nThe massive social change that went on during the Great Depression also had an effect on theater in the United States. Plays took on social roles, identifying with immigrants and the unemployed. The Federal Theatre Project, a New Deal program set up by Franklin D. Roosevelt, helped to promote theater and provide jobs for actors. The program staged many elaborate and controversial plays such as \"It Can't Happen Here\" by Sinclair Lewis and \"The Cradle Will Rock\" by Marc Blitzstein. By contrast, the legendary producer Brock Pemberton (founder of the Tony Awards) was among those who felt that it was more than ever a time for comic entertainment, in order to provide an escape from the prevailing harsh social conditions: typical of his productions was Lawrence Riley's comedy \"Personal Appearance\" (1934), whose success on Broadway (501 performances) vindicated Pemberton.\n\nThe years between the World Wars were years of extremes. Eugene O'Neill's plays were the high point for serious dramatic plays leading up to the outbreak of war in Europe. \"Beyond the Horizon\" (1920), for which he won his first Pulitzer Prize; he later won Pulitzers for \"Anna Christie\" (1922) and \"Strange Interlude\" (1928) as well as the Nobel Prize in Literature. Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne remained a popular acting couple in the 1930s.\n\n1940 proved to be a pivotal year for African-American theater. Frederick O'Neal and Abram Hill founded ANT, or the American Negro Theater, the most renowned African-American theater group of the 1940s. Their stage was small and located in the basement of a library in Harlem, and most of the shows were attended and written by African-Americans. Some shows include Theodore Browne's \"Natural Man\" (1941), Abram Hill's \"Walk Hard\" (1944), and Owen Dodson's \"Garden of Time\" (1945). Many famous actors received their training at ANT, including Harry Belafonte, Sidney Poitier, Alice and Alvin Childress, Osceola Archer, Ruby Dee, Earle Hyman, Hilda Simms, among many others.\n\nMid-20th century theater saw a wealth of Great Leading Ladies, including Helen Hayes, Katherine Cornell, Tallulah Bankhead, Judith Anderson, and Ruth Gordon. Musical theater saw stars such as Ethel Merman, Beatrice Lillie, Mary Martin, and Gertrude Lawrence.\n\nAfter World War II, American theater came into its own. Several American playwrights, such as Arthur Miller and Tennessee Williams, became world-renowned.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, experimentation in the Arts spread into theater as well, with plays such as \"Hair\" including nudity and drug culture references. Musicals remained popular as well, and musicals such as \"West Side Story\" and \"A Chorus Line\" broke previous records. At the same time, shows like Stephen Sondheim's \"Company\" began to deconstruct the musical form as it has been practiced through the mid-century, moving away from traditional plot and realistic external settings to explore the central character's inner state; his \"Follies\" relied on pastiches of the Ziegfeld Follies-styled revue; his \"Pacific Overtures\" used Japanese kabuki theatrical practices; and \"Merrily We Roll Along\" told its story backwards. Similarly, Bob Fosse's production of Chicago returned the musical to its vaudeville origins.\n\nFacts and figures of the post-war theater\n\nThe post-war American theater audiences and box offices constantly diminished, due to the undeclared \"offensive\" of television and radio upon the classical, legitimate theater. According to James F. Reilly, executive director of the League of New York Theatres, between 1930 and 1951 the number of legitimate theaters in New York City dwindled from 68 to 30. Besides of that, the admissions tax, has been a burden on the theater since 1918. It was never relaxed ever since, and was doubled in 1943. Total seating capacity of thirty most renown legitimate theaters amounted 35,697 seats in 1951. Since 1937 in New York City alone, 14 former legitimate theaters with a normal seating capacity of 16,955, have been taken over for either radio broadcasts or television performances.\n\nIn the late 1990s and 2000s, American theater began to borrow from cinema and operas. For instance, Julie Taymor, director of \"The Lion King\" directed \"Die Zauberflöte\" at the Metropolitan Opera. Also, Broadway musicals were developed around Disney's \"Mary Poppins\", \"Tarzan\", \"The Little Mermaid\", and the one that started it all, \"Beauty and the Beast\", which may have contributed to Times Square's revitalization in the 1990s. Also, Mel Brooks's \"The Producers\" and \"Young Frankenstein\" are based on his hit films.\n\nThe early years of the 20th century, before World War I, continued to see realism as the main development in drama. But starting around 1900, there was a revival of poetic drama in the States, corresponding to a similar revival in Europe (e.g. Yeats, Maeterlinck and Hauptmann). The most notable example of this trend was the \"Biblical trilogy\" of William Vaughn Moody, which also illustrate the rise of religious-themed drama during the same years, as seen in the 1899 production of \"Ben-Hur\" and two 1901 adaptations of \"Quo Vadis\". Moody, however, is best known for two prose plays, \"The Great Divide\" (1906, later adapted into three film versions) and \"The Faith Healer\" (1909), which together point the way to modern American drama in their emphasis on the emotional conflicts that lie at the heart of contemporary social conflicts. Other key playwrights from this period (in addition to continued work by Howells and Fitch) include Edward Sheldon, Charles Rann Kennedy and one of the most successful women playwrights in American drama, Rachel Crothers, whose interest in women's issues can be seen in such plays as \"He and She\" (1911).\n\nDuring the period between the World Wars, American drama came to maturity, thanks in large part to the works of Eugene O'Neill and of the Provincetown Players. O'Neill's experiments with theatrical form and his combination of Naturalist and Expressionist techniques inspired other playwrights to use greater freedom in their works, whether expanding the techniques of Realism, as in Susan Glaspell's \"Trifles\", or borrowing more heavily from German Expressionism (e.g., Elmer Rice's \"The Adding Machine\"), Other distinct movements during this period include folk-drama/regionalism (Paul Green's Pulitzer-winning \"In Abraham's Bosom\"), \"pageant\" drama (Green's \"The Lost Colony\", about the mysterious Roanoke Colony), and even a return to poetic drama (Maxwell Anderson's \"Winterset\"). At the same time, the economic crisis of the Great Depression led to the growth of protest drama, as seen in the Federal Theatre Project's Living Newspaper productions and in the works of Clifford Odets (e.g., \"Waiting for Lefty\") and of moralist drama, as in Lillian Hellman's \"The Little Foxes\" and \"The Children's Hour\". Other key figures of this era include George S. Kaufman, George Kelly, Langston Hughes, S. N. Behrman, Sidney Howard, Robert E. Sherwood, and a set of playwrights who followed O'Neill's path of philosophical searching, Philip Barry, Thornton Wilder (\"Our Town\") and William Saroyan (\"The Time of Your Life\"). Theater criticism kept pace with the drama, such as in the work of George Jean Nathan and in the numerous books and journals on American theater that were published during this time.\n\nThe stature that American drama had achieved between the Wars was cemented during the post-World War II generation, with the final works of O'Neill and his generation being joined by such towering figures as Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller, as well as by the maturation of the musical theatre form. Other key dramatists include William Inge, Arthur Laurents and Paddy Chayefsky in the 1950s, the \"avant garde\" movement of Jack Richardson, Arthur Kopit, Jack Gelber and Edward Albee the 1960s, and the maturation of black drama through Lorraine Hansberry, James Baldwin and Amiri Baraka. In the musical theater, important figures include Rodgers and Hammerstein, Lerner and Loewe, Betty Comden and Adolph Green, Richard Adler and Jerry Ross, Frank Loesser, Jule Styne, Jerry Bock, Meredith Willson and Stephen Sondheim.\n\nThe period beginning in the mid-1960s, with the passing of Civil Rights legislation and its repercussions, came the rise of an \"agenda\" theater comparable to that of the 1930s. Many of the major playwrights from the mid-century continued to produce new works, but were joined by names like Sam Shepard, Neil Simon, Romulus Linney, David Rabe, Lanford Wilson, David Mamet, and John Guare. Many important dramatists were women, including Beth Henley, Marsha Norman, Wendy Wasserstein, Megan Terry, Paula Vogel and María Irene Fornés. The growth of ethnic pride movements led to more success by dramatists from racial minorities, such as black playwrights Douglas Turner Ward, Adrienne Kennedy, Ed Bullins, Charles Fuller, Suzan-Lori Parks, Ntozake Shange, George C. Wolfe and August Wilson, who created a dramatic history of United States with his cycle of plays, \"The Pittsburgh Cycle\", one for each decade of the 20th century. Asian-American theater is represented in the early 1970s by Frank Chin and achieved international success with David Henry Hwang's \"M. Butterfly\". Latino theater grew from the local activist performances of Luis Valdez's Chicano-focused \"Teatro Campesino\" to his more formal plays, such as \"Zoot Suit\", and later to the award-winning work of Cuban Americans Fornés (multiple Obies) and her student Nilo Cruz (Pulitzer), to Puerto Rican playwrights José Rivera and Miguel Piñero, and to the Tony Award-winning musical about Dominicans in New York City, \"In the Heights\". Finally, the rise of the gay rights movement and of the AIDS crisis led to a number of important gay and lesbian dramatists, including Christopher Durang, Holly Hughes, Karen Malpede, Terrence McNally, Larry Kramer, Tony Kushner, whose \"Angels in America\" won the Tony Award two years in a row, and composer-playwright Jonathan Larson, whose musical \"Rent\" ran for over twelve years.\n\nEarlier styles of theater such as minstrel shows and Vaudeville acts have disappeared from the landscape, but theater remains a popular American art form. Broadway productions still entertain millions of theater-goers as productions have become more elaborate and expensive. At the same time, theater has also served as a platform for expression, and a venue for identity exploration for under-represented, minority communities, who have formed their own companies and created their own genres of works, notably East West Players, founded in 1965 as the first Asian-American theatre group. Notable contemporary American playwrights include Edward Albee, August Wilson, Tony Kushner, David Henry Hwang, John Guare, and Wendy Wasserstein. Smaller urban theaters have stayed a source of innovation, and regional theaters remain an important part of theater life. Drama is also taught in high schools and colleges, which was not done in previous eras, and many become interested in theater through this.\n\n\"The Faster Times\", an online newspaper that ran from 2009 to 2013, featured a weekly column that discussed issues and trends in American theater.\n\nHowlRound, an online \"commons\", features opinions and essays by artists and academics in American Theater today.\n\n\n\n"}

The show's original hosts were Stan Rhoads and former Bigfoot driver Rich Hooser, along with pit reporter Mike Goss. Gary Lee replaced Stan Rhoads. Army Armstrong later joined as a pit reporter, and later, when Hooser left the show, became color commentator. The show initially began in 1989 as a vehicle for TNT Motorsports events, complimenting their ESPN show Powertrax and syndicated show Tuff Trax, and would typically alternate between truck and tractor pulls and monster trucks, with National Mud Racing Organization mud races intermittently. After TNT was bought out by the United States Hot Rod Association in 1991, the show began primarily airing the Pendaliner Monster Truck Series and NMRO mud races held at Special Events' 4-Wheel and Off-Road Jamborees. A frequent feature of these shows was a highlight segment of \"Tough Truck\" amateur off-road races near the end of the monster truck episodes. The final season of Trucks and Tractor Power had Gary Lee as the host at the Monster Truck Thunder Drags, with Dave Rief, and later Tom Rivers, for the Jamborees. At the end of the 1996 season, the Pendaliner cancelled their sponsorship of the monster truck series, causing the show to be subsequently cancelled.\n"}

{"id": "19810565", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19810565", "title": "Whitehall farce", "text": "Whitehall farce\n\nThe Whitehall farces were a series of five long-running comic stage plays at the Whitehall Theatre in London, presented by the actor-manager Brian Rix, in the 1950s and 1960s. They were in the low comedy tradition of British farce, following the Aldwych farces, which played at the Aldwych Theatre between 1924 and 1933.\n\nThe five farces were as follows:\nRix built a company of regular players who appeared in some or all of these shows. They included Leo Franklyn, Larry Noble, Dennis Ramsden and Derek Royle, and members of Rix's family: his wife, Elspet Gray, his sister, Sheila Mercier and his brother-in-law, Peter Mercier. Others who appeared in one or more of the Whitehall farces include Terry Scott and Andrew Sachs. Rix starred in all five plays, in a range of roles: a \"gormless recruit\" to the army in \"Reluctant Heroes\"; a timidly crooked bookie's runner in \"Dry Rot\"; a street musician recruited as a secret agent in \"Simple Spymen\"; four identical brothers in \"One For the Pot\"; and a harassed civil servant in \"Chase Me, Comrade\". From \"Dry Rot\" onwards, Rix and his authors developed a double act for the Rix characters and those played by Leo Franklyn, in which the two performers played off one another rather as Ralph Lynn and Tom Walls had done in the Aldwych farces of the previous generation.\n\nAlthough the five plays had long runs and packed houses, most London critics were snobbishly dismissive of them. Looking back in 1980, Michael Coveney wrote of the Whitehall farces, \"A tradition of critical snobbery has grown up around these plays, partly because they were so blatantly popular but chiefly because of our conviction that farce, unless written by a Frenchman, is an inferior theatrical species. Once the National Theatre has done its duty by Priestley and Rattigan and others teetering on the brink of theatrical respectability I suggest they employ Mr. Rix … to investigate the ignored riches of English farce between Travers and Ayckbourn.\" The few London critics of the 1950s and 1960s who did not take a lofty view included Harold Hobson, Ronald Bryden, J. W. Lambert and Alan Dent.\n\nIn addition to the five long-running farces, Rix presented a series of more than eighty one-off televised comedies, some of them farces, for the BBC. The first was transmitted live from the Whitehall Theatre in January 1956. There were also film versions of \"Reluctant Heroes\" (1951), \"Dry Rot\" (1956), and \"Chase Me, Comrade\", which was renamed \"Not Now, Comrade\" (1976).\n\nIn 1966, having been unable to secure the lease of the Whitehall Theatre, Rix took his company on tour in \"Chase Me, Comrade\" and \"Bang, Bang Beirut\" (later retitled \"Stand By Your Bedouin\"), by Cooney and Hilton. Later productions by the Rix company at the Garrick Theatre and elsewhere included \"Uproar in the House\", by Anthony Marriott and Alistair Foot (1967); \"Let Sleeping Wives Lie\" by Harold Brooke and Kay Bannerman (1967); \"She's Done It Again\", by Michael Pertwee (1969); \"Don't Just Lie There, Say Something\" (Pertwee, 1971); and \"A Bit Between the Teeth\" (Pertwee, 1974). According to Leslie Smith in a study of modern British farce, although some of the Rix productions after \"Chase Me, Comrade\" achieved substantial success, none of them had the conspicuously long runs of the five Whitehall farces. In 1976 Rix returned to the Whitehall with Fringe Benefits (Churchill and Cooney) which ran until 1977 when he retired from the stage.\n\n"}
